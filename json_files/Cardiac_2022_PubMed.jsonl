{"title": "Molecular and cellular pathophysiology of circulating cardiomyocyte-specific cell free DNA (cfDNA): Biomarkers of heart failure and potential therapeutic targets.", "abstract": "Pathological cardiac damage during heart failure is associated with cell death and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) release which triggers a viscous cycle of sterile inflammation to mediate maladaptive cardiac tissue remodelling during the progression to heart failure. DAMPs like cytokines, chemokines, and nuclear or mitochondrial genomic fragments are released in the pathological myocardium. Interestingly, circulating or cytosolic DNA fragments can play a role in the disease by interaction with nucleic acid sensors expressed in cardiomyocyte and non-myocyte neighbouring cells. The circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) fragments have been clinically reported as markers for various diseases including cardiovascular pathophysiology. Such cfDNA within the DAMP pool can mediate intra- and inter-cellular signalling cascade to upregulate transcriptional expression of inflammatory mediators and trigger oxidative stress within cells. The cellular role of such genomic equivalents varying with chronic or acute stress might be correlated with the cell death forms encountered in myocardium during disease progression. Thus, cfDNA can be phenotypically correlated as a critical player towards upregulation of pathological processes like interstitial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction and cell death. Herein, we review the association of cfDNA with heart failure and analyse their potential usage as novel and effective therapeutic targets towards augmentation of cardiac function.", "journal": "Genes & diseases", "date": "2023-07-03", "authors": ["AbhiDutta", "MoumitaDas", "AnkitaGhosh", "SantanuRana"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gendis.2022.08.008"}

While the elastic properties of cardiac tissue have been extensively studied, its viscous properties remain an issue of ongoing debate. Here we adopt a viscoelastic version of the classical Holzapfel Ogden model to study the viscous timescales of human cardiac tissue. We perform a series of simulations and explore stress-relaxation curves, pressure-volume loops, strain profiles, and ventricular wall strains for varying viscosity parameters. We show that the time window for model calibration strongly influences the parameter identification. Using a four-chamber human heart model, we observe that, during the physiologically relevant time scales of the cardiac cycle, viscous relaxation has a negligible effect on the overall behavior of the heart. While viscosity could have important consequences in pathological conditions with compromised contraction or relaxation properties, we conclude that, for simulations within the physiological range of a human heart beat, we can reasonably approximate the human heart as hyperelastic.", "journal": "Computational mechanics", "date": "2023-06-05", "authors": ["O\u011fuz ZiyaTikeno\u011fullar\u0131", "Francisco SahliCostabal", "JiangYao", "AlisonMarsden", "EllenKuhl"], "doi": "10.1007/s00466-022-02180-z\n10.1007/s00466-022-02146-1"}

Cardiac markers in serum like creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponins T (cTn T) and I (cTn I) increased in ISO-induced rats. Moreover, lipid peroxidative markers like thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) were raised, and the activities/level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were diminished in ISO-treated heart tissue. In addition, inflammatory and nuclear respiratory factor (Nrf)-2 signalling molecules were upregulated in ISO-induced ischemic rats. 6-Shogaol pretreatment decreased the activities of cardiac and lipid peroxidative markers and enhanced the antioxidant status in ISO-induced cardiac injury rats. Further, 6-Shogaol pretreatment inhibited serum inflammatory markers: tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), Nrf-2 molecule and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in ISO-induced cardial damage rats. We noticed the effect of 6-Shogaol inhibited pro-apoptotic genes like B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax), Fas, caspase-3, -8, -9, cytochrome C, and inflammatory genes and increased Bcl-2 expression in ISO-treated rats. The cardioprotective activity of 6-Shogaol in rats with ISO-induced myocardial damage may be due to its ability to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, perhaps via the Nrf-2/HO-1 signalling pathway.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society", "date": "2023-04-23", "authors": ["HLi", "JShen", "YZhang", "LHu", "WLuo"], "doi": "10.26402/jpp.2022.6.06"}

{"title": "Potential cardioprotective effects of Amentoflavone in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an available chemotherapeutic drug for treating various tumors. However, its effectiveness is limited by cardiotoxicity. Amentoflavone (AMF), a natural biflavonoid separated from Cycas thouarsii ethyl acetate fraction, displays promising anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Thus, our research aims to explore whether AMF could boost cardioprotective effects against DOX cardiotoxicity and reveal the potential underlying mechanisms of cardioprotection. Mice were classified into four groups; Normal control, Untreated DOX group, and DOX groups treated with AMF (40 and 80\u00a0mg/kg, respectively) intraperitoneal injection daily for four days before doxorubicin administration and for additional three days following DOX administration to assess cardiotoxicity. Echocardiography showed that AMF 80 treated group was protected from DOX cardiotoxicity. Additionally, it alleviated histopathological structural alterations and effectively restored heart weight and body weight ratio. These effects were confirmed biochemically by a substantially reduced serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. AMF effectively restored nuclear respiratory factor-1(NRF-1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and normalized heat shock protein -\u00a027(HSP-27) expression levels compared to the DOX group. Moreover, AMF mitigated oxidative stress conditions and significantly suppressed NADPH oxidase (NOX) expression levels. It also showed significant anti-inflammatory effects via suppressing interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression and decreasing nuclear factor Kabba B (NF-\u03bab) immune-staining. In addition, AMF markedly reduced FAS ligand (FASL) expression and p53 immune staining in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Integrated landscape of cardiac metabolism in end-stage human nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality. Failing hearts undergo profound metabolic changes, but a comprehensive evaluation in humans is lacking. We integrate plasma and cardiac tissue metabolomics of 678 metabolites, genome-wide RNA-sequencing, and proteomic studies to examine metabolic status in 87 explanted human hearts from 39 patients with end-stage HF compared with 48 nonfailing donors. We confirm bioenergetic defects in human HF and reveal selective depletion of adenylate purines required for maintaining ATP levels. We observe substantial reductions in fatty acids and acylcarnitines in failing tissue, despite plasma elevations, suggesting defective import of fatty acids into cardiomyocytes. Glucose levels, in contrast, are elevated. Pyruvate dehydrogenase, which gates carbohydrate oxidation, is de-repressed, allowing increased lactate and pyruvate burning. Tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates are significantly reduced. Finally, bioactive lipids are profoundly reprogrammed, with marked reductions in ceramides and elevations in lysoglycerophospholipids.

{"title": "The role of major immune cells in myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a cardiovascular disease (CVD) with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, often leading to adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure, which is a serious threat to human life and health. The immune system makes an important contribution to the maintenance of normal cardiac function. In the disease process of MI, necrotic cardiomyocytes release signals that activate nonspecific immunity and trigger the action of specific immunity. Complex immune cells play an important role in all stages of MI progression by removing necrotic cardiomyocytes and tissue and promoting the healing of damaged tissue cells. With the development of biomaterials, cardiac patches have become an emerging method of repairing MI, and the development of engineered cardiac patches through the construction of multiple animal models of MI can help treat MI. This review introduces immune cells involved in the development of MI, summarizes the commonly used animal models of MI and the newly developed cardiac patch, so as to provide scientific reference for the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of MI.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2023-02-07", "authors": ["QiangFeng", "QirongLi", "HengzongZhou", "LiqunSun", "ChaoLin", "YeJin", "DongxuWang", "GongliangGuo"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2022.1084460\n10.1161/circresaha.114.300639\n10.1016/s0735-1097(00)00804-4\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.09.011\n10.1016/s0140-6736(00)04904-7\n10.1038/s41577-018-0065-8\n10.1056/nejm200007063430107\n10.1016/j.jaci.2009.09.017\n10.1161/circresaha.116.303577\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.02.016\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.04.018\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c00454\n10.1089/ars.2006.8.1907\n10.1097/fjc.0000000000000876\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.01.001\n10.1093/cvr/cvz050\n10.1186/s12929-017-0322-3\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.04.023\n10.1161/circresaha.111.243162\n10.1038/nri3712\n10.1084/jem.20070885\n10.1096/fj.12-214049\n10.1161/circulationaha.109.916346\n10.1161/circresaha.115.303567\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173090\n10.1161/circresaha.114.303204\n10.1152/ajpheart.00595.2019\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.06.006\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa598\n10.1161/circresaha.118.314357\n10.1161/circresaha.118.314028\n10.1007/s00395-011-0221-9\n10.1161/circulationaha.111.052126\n10.1161/jaha.114.000839\n10.1161/circulationaha.116.023106\n10.1161/jaha.116.004406\n10.1093/cvr/cvw024\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw002\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz461\n10.7554/eLife.66808\n10.1172/jci151268\n10.1038/s41467-020-19297-5\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.05.005\n10.1093/cvr/cvab237\n10.1172/jci136778\n10.1172/jci150555\n10.1146/annurev-immunol-100219-020937\n10.1038/nri778\n10.1161/circresaha.116.304072\n10.1155/2013/635672\n10.1155/2019/9515346\n10.4067/s0716-97602012000200012\n10.7150/thno.68437\n10.1161/circulationaha.120.046789\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.11.078\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv639\n10.1161/circulationaha.111.044164\n10.7150/thno.42943\n10.1038/s41467-021-21737-9\n10.1007/s00395-011-0232-6\n10.1172/jci152418\n10.1161/circulationaha.118.036053\n10.7150/thno.32734\n10.1038/nm.3284\n10.1007/s12325-017-0612-x\n10.1093/cvr/cvab113\n10.1007/s00395-021-00886-4\n10.1007/s00395-022-00956-1\n10.1161/circulationaha.116.024590\n10.1007/s003950200046\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.030\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003551\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.02.079\n10.7150/thno.63642\n10.1093/cvr/cvy200\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9683\n10.1038/s41419-021-03610-1\n10.1002/jbm.a.36464\n10.7150/thno.7188\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00033.2003\n10.1038/nprot.2012.075\n10.1007/s003300050545\n10.7150/thno.72289\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa791\n10.1126/science.1139247\n10.1001/jama.1994.03510280051032\n10.1007/s12012-011-9129-8\n10.1007/s12012-022-09754-6\n10.1038/ncomms11138\n10.1093/bmb/ldn026\n10.1089/ten.2006.0110\n10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00339-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.01.002\n10.1002/adhm.202001175\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.03.073\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.03.015\n10.1002/adhm.202201856\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.05.044\n10.1002/adhm.202101855\n10.1016/j.actbio.2022.09.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0165255\n10.1038/s41551-020-00613-9"}

{"title": "Statins change the cytokine profile in ", "abstract": "Chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC), caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most severe manifestation of Chagas disease.CCC is characterized by cardiac inflammation and fibrosis caused by a persistent inflammatory response. Following infection, macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 to control parasitemia. Although this response contains parasite infection, it causes damage to the heart tissue. Thus, the use of immunomodulators is a rational alternative to CCC. Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2 are RhoA-activated serine/threonine kinases that regulate the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Both ROCKs have been implicated in the polarization of macrophages towards an M1 (pro-inflammatory) phenotype. Statins are FDA-approved lipid-lowering drugs that reduce RhoA signaling by inhibiting geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthesis. This work aims to identify the effect of statins on U937 macrophage polarization and cardiac tissue inflammation and its relationship with ROCK activity during T. cruzi infection.\nPMA-induced, wild-type, GFP-, CA-ROCK1- and CA-ROCK2-expressing U937 macrophages were incubated with atorvastatin, or the inhibitors Y-27632, JSH-23, TAK-242, or C3 exoenzyme incubated with or without T. cruzi trypomastigotes for 30 min to evaluate the activity of ROCK and the M1 and M2 cytokine expression and secretion profiling. Also, ROCK activity was determined in T. cruzi-infected, BALB/c mice hearts.\nIn this study, we demonstrate for the first time in macrophages that incubation with T. cruzi leads to ROCK activation via the TLR4 pathway, which triggers NF-\u03baB activation. Inhibition of ROCKs by Y-27632 prevents NF-\u03baB activation and the expression and secretion of M1 markers, as does treatment with atorvastatin.

However, its potential role in diabetes, especially in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), remains largely unexplored. In this study, using affinity enrichment and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, we quantitatively analyze the kbhb residues on heart tissues of a DCM model rat. A total of 3,520 kbhb sites in 1,089 proteins were identified in this study. Further analysis showed that 336 kbhb sites in 143 proteins were differentially expressed between the heart tissues of DCM and wild-type rats. Among them, 284 kbhb sites in 96 proteins were upregulated, while 52 kbhb sites in 47 proteins were downregulated. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteomic results revealed that these kbhb-modified proteins were widely distributed in various components and involved in a wide range of cellular functions and biological processes (BPs). Functional analysis showed that the kbhb-modified proteins were involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and propanoate metabolism. Our findings demonstrated how kbhb is related to many metabolic pathways and is mainly involved in energy metabolism.

{"title": "Increased Myosin light chain 9 expression during Kawasaki disease vasculitis.", "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that predominantly afflicts children. KD development is known to be associated with an aberrant immune response and abnormal platelet activation, however its etiology is still largely unknown. Myosin light chain 9 (Myl9) is known to regulate cellular contractility of both non-muscle and smooth muscle cells, and can be released from platelets, whereas any relations of Myl9 expression to KD vasculitis have not been examined.\nPlasma Myl9 concentrations in KD patients and children with febrile illness were measured and associated with KD clinical course and prognosis. Myl9 release from platelets in KD patients was also evaluated in vitro. Myl9 expression was determined in coronary arteries from Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE)-injected mice that develop experimental KD vasculitis, as well as in cardiac tissues obtained at autopsy from KD patients.\nPlasma Myl9 levels were significantly higher in KD patients during the acute phase compared with healthy controls or patients with other febrile illnesses, declined following IVIG therapy in IVIG-responders but not in non-responders. In vitro, platelets from KD patients released Myl9 independently of thrombin stimulation. In the LCWE-injected mice, Myl9 was detected in cardiac tissue at an early stage before inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. In tissues obtained at autopsy from KD patients, the highest Myl9 expression was observed in thrombi during the acute phase and in the intima and adventitia of coronary arteries during the chronic phase. Thus, our studies show that Myl9 expression is significantly increased during KD vasculitis and that Myl9 levels may be a useful biomarker to estimate inflammation and IVIG responsiveness to KD.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2023-01-24", "authors": ["HironobuKobayashi", "Motoko YKimura", "IchitaHasegawa", "EisukeSuganuma", "YuzuruIkehara", "KazuhikoAzuma", "ToshihiroIto", "RyotaEbata", "YosukeKurashima", "YoheiKawasaki", "YukiShiko", "NaokiSaito", "HirotaroIwase", "YounghoLee", "MagaliNoval Rivas", "MosheArditi", "MasahikoZuka", "HiromichiHamada", "ToshinoriNakayama"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2022.1036672\n10.1016/s0140-6736(04)16814-1\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000484\n10.1253/circj.CJ-19-1094\n10.1056/nejm198608073150601\n10.1586/1744666x.2015.1044980\n10.1093/cei/uxac046\n10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.006\n10.1002/art.37815\n10.1038/s41467-022-30357-w\n10.1128/cmr.11.3.405\n10.1038/ng.2007.59\n10.1038/tpj.2011.45\n10.1016/s0140-6736(18)32003-8\n10.1111/imr.12559\n10.1007/s00281-019-00734-7\n10.4049/jimmunol.0900646\n10.1126/sciimmunol.aaf9154\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.594297\n10.1016/j.immuni.2019.05.021\n10.1111/j.1442-200x.2003.01810.x\n10.1253/circj.cj-12-1037\n10.3346/jkms.2017.32.7.1147\n10.1038/s41598-019-54113-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.592865\n10.1111/ped.14326\n10.1038/nrrheum.2015.54\n10.1016/j.echo.2016.03.017\n10.1161/circulationaha.111.072769\n10.1538/expanim.19-0124\n10.2144/000112517\n10.1016/s1074-7613(03)00177-8\n10.1097/inf.0000000000002563\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04073.x\n10.1111/ped.12120\n10.1038/ng.2220\n10.4049/jimmunol.1600388\n10.1161/circresaha.121.319153\n10.1111/j.1442-200x.2005.02049.x\n10.1073/pnas.2203437119\n10.1016/s2665-9913(20)30420-3\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.05.007"}

Pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death) has gradually gained attention in the context of Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) has been shown to contribute to the pathological process of pyroptosis, but whether it is related to the potential role of ticagrelor is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of ticagrelor on Dox-induced pyroptosis in cardiomyocytes.

M1-type macrophages are closely associated with inflammation and sympathetic remodeling after MI. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for the regulation of cardiovascular disease development. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the lncRNAs involved in MI and reveal a possible regulatory mechanism.\nM0- and M1-type macrophages were selected for sequencing and screened for differentially expressed lncRNAs. The data revealed that lncRNA LOC100911717 was upregulated in M1-type macrophages but not in M0-type macrophages. In addition, the lncRNA LOC100911717 was upregulated in heart tissues after MI. Furthermore, an RNA pull-down assay revealed that lncRNA LOC100911717 could interact with growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43). Essentially, immunofluorescence assays and programmed electrical stimulation demonstrated that GAP43 expression was suppressed and VA incidence was reduced after lncRNA LOC100911717 knockdown in rat hearts using an adeno-associated virus.\nWe observed a novel relationship between lncRNA LOC100911717 and GAP43. After MI, lncRNA LOC100911717 was upregulated and GAP43 expression was enhanced, thus increasing the extent of sympathetic remodeling and the frequency of VA events.

Rats were then administered saline solution (model and sham operation control groups) or drugs by oral gavage for 28 d. Echocardiography was performed and serum creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponin I levels were monitored to examine the cardiac function. Inflammation was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining of heart tissue, and serum interleukin-2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurements.

{"title": "Electrically conductive carbon-based (bio)-nanomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "A proper self-regenerating capability is lacking in human cardiac tissue which along with the alarming rate of deaths associated with cardiovascular disorders makes tissue engineering critical. Novel approaches are now being investigated in order to speedily overcome the challenges in this path. Tissue engineering has been revolutionized by the advent of nanomaterials, and later by the application of carbon-based nanomaterials because of their exceptional variable functionality, conductivity, and mechanical properties. Electrically conductive biomaterials used as cell bearers provide the tissue with an appropriate microenvironment for the specific seeded cells as substrates for the sake of protecting cells in biological media against attacking mechanisms. Nevertheless, their advantages and shortcoming in view of cellular behavior, toxicity, and targeted delivery depend on the tissue in which they are implanted or being used as a scaffold. This review seeks to address, summarize, classify, conceptualize, and discuss the use of carbon-based nanoparticles in cardiac tissue engineering emphasizing their conductivity. We considered electrical conductivity as a key affecting the regeneration of cells. Correspondingly, we reviewed conductive polymers used in tissue engineering and specifically in cardiac repair as key biomaterials with high efficiency. We comprehensively classified and discussed the advantages of using conductive biomaterials in cardiac tissue engineering. An overall review of the open literature on electroactive substrates including carbon-based biomaterials over the last decade was provided, tabulated, and thoroughly discussed. The most commonly used conductive substrates comprising graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanofibers in cardiac repair were studied.", "journal": "Bioengineering & translational medicine", "date": "2023-01-24", "authors": ["NeginJalilinejad", "MohammadRabiee", "NafisehBaheiraei", "RaminGhahremanzadeh", "RezaSalarian", "NavidRabiee", "OmidAkhavan", "PayamZarrintaj", "AleksanderHejna", "Mohammad RezaSaeb", "AliZarrabi", "EsmaeelSharifi", "SatarYousefiasl", "Ehsan NazarzadehZare"], "doi": "10.1002/btm2.10347\n10.1016/j.mtchem.2022.100780\n10.1016/j.trac.2021.116455\n10.1021/acsabm.1c00932\n10.2217/nnm-2020-0353\n10.1007/s40097-022-00491-4\n10.2147/ijn.s353062\n10.1021/acsabm.1c01311\n10.1002/jmr.2927\n10.1016/j.microc.2021.106610\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153902\n10.1039/d1ra06030a\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.116277\n10.1177/0885328219839037\n10.1016/j.trac.2021.116279\n10.1039/d1ra06437a\n10.1039/d0cc03061a\n10.1002/jmr.2928\n10.1039/d0py00787k"}
{"title": "Effect of in ovo creatine monohydrate on hatchability, post-hatch performance, breast muscle yield and fiber size in chicks from young breeder flocks.", "abstract": "Younger broiler breeder flocks produce smaller eggs containing smaller yolks, with potentially lower energy reserves for the developing chick. Creatine is a naturally occurring energy source and is abundant in metabolically active tissues; providing this to chicks in ovo should provide additional energy to improve hatchability and post-hatch growth. Thus, post-hatch performance of male and female chicks hatched from younger breeder flocks supplemented with creatine monohydrate (CrM) in ovo was investigated. Four hundred eggs from Ross 308 breeder hens aged 27 to 29 wk were collected and at d 14 assigned to a treatment group and received 1) no injection, 2) 0.75% saline injection, or 3) 8.16 mg creatine monohydrate in 0.75% saline. At hatch 72 birds (24/treatment) were euthanized and BW, breast muscle, heart and liver weight were obtained, and breast muscle tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin. Birds were then placed in raised metal pens (24 pens; 10-11 birds/pen; 8 replicates/treatment) and grown to d 42 with BW and pen feed intake measured once a week. At d 42, ninty-six birds were euthanized (2 male and 2 female/pen) and the process occurred as at hatch. Body composition was obtained for 48 birds (2/pen; 1 male,1 female) with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner. Breast muscle tissue was processed for histological analysis and breast muscle fiber parameters were analyzed by ImageJ. While not statistically significant, the CrM treatment group saw an improved hatch rate (CrM: 93.5%, Saline: 88.6%, Control: 88.8%) and reduced early post hatch mortality. Chicks given in ovo CrM had significantly increased creatine concentrations in both liver and heart tissue at hatch compared to those in the saline and control groups. BW, BW gain, and final body composition parameters were not statistically different between treatments and in ovo CrM did not affect breast muscle fiber number or area. The creatine injection likely improved the energy status of the growing embryo resulting in the improved hatch rate but leaving little reserves for post-hatch growth.", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors": ["Corey-Ann BFirman", "VivienneInhuber", "David JCadogan", "William H E JVan Wettere", "Rebecca E AForder"], "doi": "10.1016/j.psj.2022.102447"}
{"title": "Myocardial Cell Preservation from Potential Cardiotoxic Drugs: The Role of Nanotechnologies.", "abstract": "Cardiotoxic therapies, whether chemotherapeutic or antibiotic, represent a burden for patients who may need to interrupt life-saving treatment because of serious complications. Cardiotoxicity is a broad term, spanning from forms of heart failure induction, particularly left ventricular systolic dysfunction, to induction of arrhythmias. Nanotechnologies emerged decades ago. They offer the possibility to modify the profiles of potentially toxic drugs and to abolish off-target side effects thanks to more favorable pharmacokinetics and dynamics. This relatively modern science encompasses nanocarriers (e.g., liposomes, niosomes, and dendrimers) and other delivery systems applicable to real-life clinical settings. We here review selected applications of nanotechnology to the fields of pharmacology and cardio-oncology. Heart tissue-sparing co-administration of nanocarriers bound to chemotherapeutics (such as anthracyclines and platinum agents) are discussed based on recent studies. Nanotechnology applications supporting the administration of potentially cardiotoxic oncological target therapies, antibiotics (especially macrolides and fluoroquinolones), or neuroactive agents are also summarized. The future of nanotechnologies includes studies to improve therapeutic safety and to encompass a broader range of pharmacological agents.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether increased circulating immunoglobulin levels prior to transplantation are associated with poor post-HTx survival. Pre-and post-HTx plasma samples of 36 cardiac transplant recipient patients were used to determine circulating immunoglobulin levels. In addition, epicardial tissue was collected to determine immunoglobulin deposition in cardiac tissue and assess signs and severity of graft rejection. High levels of IgG1 and IgG2 prior to HTx were associated with a shorter survival post-HTx. Immunoglobulin deposition in cardiac tissue was significantly elevated in patients with a survival of less than 3 years. Patients with high plasma IgG levels pre-HTx also had significantly higher plasma levels after HTx. Furthermore, high pre-HTX levels of IgG1 and IgG2 levels were also significantly increased in patients with inflammatory infiltrate in CAV lesions.

Heat shock protein-derived peptide (HSP-17) is a peptide which is low-expressed in DOX treated mouse heart tissue. It has high bioactivity and interspecies sequence consistency, and is predicted to have myocardial protective effect.\nFirstly, we added 1 \u00b5M DOX to H9c2 cell culture medium for 24 hours to construct the myocardial cytotoxicity model. Then we detected the effect of HSP-17 on DOX induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury by measuring cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide kits are used to evaluate the effect of the HSP-17 peptide on DOX-induced oxidative stress injury to cardiomyocytes, and the detection of apoptosis related proteins and flow cytometry were applied to detect the level of apoptosis. Furthermore, the protein expression levels [phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K)] of the PI3K/Akt pathway were also detected by western blotting.\nWe found that the HSP-17 peptide can increase cell viability, protect mitochondrial potential, reduce LDH levels, and reduce ROS and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In addition, we also observed that HSP-17 upregulated the expression level of p-Akt, and LY294002, a typical inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, was found to eliminate the protective roles of HSP-17.\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated that the HSP-17 peptide protected H9c2 cells against oxidative stress and apoptosis via PI3K/Akt pathway activation, which provides a new idea for the treatment of DOX-induced myocardial injury.", "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "date": "2023-01-21", "authors": ["XiaofangChen", "HaoZhang", "MengwenFeng", "ZhongqingXu", "LingmeiQian"], "doi": "10.21037/atm-22-6007\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.172818\n10.1016/j.drudis.2016.11.005\n10.1007/s12012-007-0008-2\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.102089\n10.2174/1381612827666210125155048\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.001\n10.7150/ijbs.35630\n10.1007/s10495-018-1485-4\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00821\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.09.035\n10.1002/ctm2.124\n10.1002/jcb.29316\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.08.033\n10.1074/jbc.M113.508143\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00815\n10.1371/journal.pone.0045012\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000160851.41872.C6\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.09.013\n10.1080/15548627.2017.1392420\n10.1152/physrev.00023.2010\n10.1016/j.tcm.2005.05.004\n10.1002/stem.230\n10.1038/s41392-020-00257-w\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.08.032\n10.1038/emm.2017.278\n10.1016/j.abb.2021.109050\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101636\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111708\n10.1016/j.biocel.2017.05.006\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.01.013\n10.1038/s41418-019-0372-z\n10.21037/cdt-20-490\n10.1111/jcmm.13012\n10.3892/ijmm.2016.2563"}

{"title": "Toll-like receptor 9 signaling after myocardial infarction: Role of p66ShcA adaptor protein.", "abstract": "During myocardial infarction, cellular debris is released, causing a sterile inflammation via pattern recognition receptors. These reactions amplify damage and promotes secondary heart failure. The pattern recognition receptor, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) detects immunogenic fragments of endogenous DNA, inducing inflammation by NF\u03baB. The p66ShcA adaptor protein plays an important role in both ischemic myocardial damage and immune responses. We hypothesized that p66ShcA adaptor protein promotes DNA-sensing signaling via the TLR9 pathway after myocardial infarction. TLR9 protein expression increased in cardiac tissue from patients with end-stage heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia in mice in\u00a0vivo induced gene expression of key TLR9 pathway proteins (MyD88 and Unc93b1). In this model, a functional link between TLR9 and p66ShcA was revealed as; (i) ischemia-induced upregulation of TLR9 protein was abrogated in myocardium of p66ShcA knockout mice; (ii) when p66ShcA was overexpressed in NFkB reporter cells stably expressing TLR9, NFkB-activation increased during stimulation with the TLR9 agonist CpG B; (iii) in cardiac fibroblasts, p66ShcA overexpression caused TLR9 upregulation. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that ShcA proteins and TLR9 may be found in the same protein complex, which was dissipated upon TLR9 stimulation in\u00a0vivo. A proximity assay confirmed the co-localization of TLR9 and ShcA proteins. The systemic immune response after myocardial ischemia was dampened in p66ShcA knockout mice as interleukin-4, -17 and\u00a0-22 expression in mononuclear cells isolated from spleens was reduced. In conclusion, p66ShcA adaptor may be an interaction partner and a regulator of the TLR9 pathway post-infarction.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2023-01-13", "authors": ["AntonBaysa", "Azzam AMaghazachi", "Kristin LarsenSand", "MarikaCampesan", "TaniaZaglia", "MarcoMongillo", "MarcoGiorgio", "FabioDi Lisa", "LarsGullestad", "Lars HMariero", "JarleVaage", "GuroValen", "K\u00e5re-OlavStensl\u00f8kken"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.12.085"}
{"title": "New insights of necroptosis and immune infiltration in sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction from bioinformatics analysis through RNA-seq in mice.", "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host immune response to infection. Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is a common complication in patients with severe sepsis and is associated with increased mortality. The molecular mechanisms underlying SIMD are complex and not well characterized. Excessive inflammation due to impaired regulation of immune response is one of the major causes of SIMD. Necroptosis is a novel type of cell death that is closely related to tissue injury and inflammation. However, the role of necroptosis in SIMD is not known. Therefore, in this study, we performed an in-depth bioinformatics analysis to investigate the relationship between necroptosis and SIMD using a mouse model generated by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the underlying mechanisms. Myocardial function was assessed by echocardiography. Histopathological changes in SIMD were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Gene expression profiles of the heart tissues from the SIMD and control mice were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis. Transcriptome sequencing demonstrated significant differences in the expression levels of 3654 genes in the heart tissues of SIMD mice including 1810 up-regulated and 1844 down-regulated genes. The necroptosis pathway genes were significantly enriched in the heart tissues from the SIMD group mice. We identified 35 necroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (NRDEGs) including MLKL and RIPK3. Cardiomyocyte necroptosis was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. The expression levels of most NRDEGs showed positive correlation with the infiltration levels of mast cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, and negative correlation with the infiltration levels of B cells and plasma cells in the heart tissues of the SIMD group mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that necroptosis was associated with changes in the infiltration levels of several immune cell types in the heart tissues of the SIMD model mice. This suggested that necroptosis influenced SIMD development by modulating the immune microenvironment.

We examined the role of ATGL in metabolic cardiomyopathy by developing an Atgl knockout (ALKO) zebrafish model of metabolic cardiomyopathy disease by continuously expressing CRISPR/Cas9 protein and ", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-01-09", "authors": ["Hsin-HungLai", "Kun-YunYeh", "Hung-MingHsu", "Guor MourHer"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24010117\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192575\n10.1016/j.pcad.2015.12.003\n10.1038/s42255-020-0183-z\n10.1093/cvr/cvr038\n10.1007/s10741-020-09997-x\n10.1074/jbc.272.2.971\n10.1016/j.jhep.2009.03.008\n10.1515/hsz-2012-0192\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.07.150\n10.1093/cvr/cvx012\n10.1126/science.1100747\n10.1126/science.1123965\n10.1074/jbc.M115.645341\n10.1074/jbc.M710566200\n10.1194/jlr.M000729\n10.1038/nm.2439\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.02.022\n10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100001\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1001239\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01490.x\n10.1016/j.nmd.2017.01.011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.248260\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.05.011\n10.3791/57567\n10.1038/nm.2037\n10.1038/ncomms11303\n10.3390/jcdd8040046\n10.4070/kcj.2017.0080\n10.1093/nar/gkab228\n10.1161/CIRCGEN.118.002135\n10.3389/fendo.2016.00159\n10.3389/fendo.2018.00366\n10.3389/fcell.2020.620984\n10.1016/j.drudis.2020.09.036\n10.1073/pnas.1523918113\n10.1038/s41598-019-46378-3\n10.1242/dev.00844\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098282\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.10.004\n10.3892/mmr.2018.9497\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.215814\n10.1194/jlr.M052613\n10.1074/jbc.M109.006650\n10.1186/s12944-019-1151-z\n10.1172/jci.insight.129781\n10.1146/annurev-immunol-031210-101322\n10.1016/j.phrs.2006.03.009\n10.1016/j.jaccas.2020.03.021\n10.1038/s41598-020-75321-0\n10.1042/BCJ20190468\n10.5414/NPP29351\n10.1016/j.nmd.2014.04.001\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.10.008\n10.1128/MCB.06470-11\n10.2337/db12-0927\n10.1038/ijo.2013.103\n10.1155/2019/6428924\n10.1161/01.ATV.20.7.1777\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.03.015\n10.1056/NEJMra0800028\n10.1007/s11886-021-01492-5\n10.2217/nnm-2018-0023\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.05.013\n10.1093/cvr/cvab182\n10.1007/s10565-022-09699-0\n10.1038/ncomms14859\n10.1152/ajpheart.00737.2020\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.01.137\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1459-3_5\n10.1007/s12020-017-1494-z\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.04.009\n10.3390/inventions3020021"}

The patient was started on appropriate guideline-directed medical therapy with only mild improvement in his EF. Upon further investigation, echocardiogram, technetium pyrophosphate scan (Tc PYP), and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) suggested a diagnosis of amyloidosis, and ATTRwt was subsequently confirmed with native heart tissue biopsy, congo red staining, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and genetic testing.

{"title": "Soluble ACE2 Is Filtered into the Urine.", "abstract": "ACE2 is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) capable of balancing the RAS by metabolizing angiotensin II (AngII). First described in cardiac tissue, abundance of ACE2 is highest in the kidney, and it is also expressed in several extrarenal tissues. Previously, we reported an association between enhanced susceptibility to hypertension and elevated renal AngII levels in global ACE2-knockout mice.\nTo examine the effect of ACE2 expressed in the kidney, relative to extrarenal expression, on the development of hypertension, we used a kidney crosstransplantation strategy with ACE2-KO and WT mice. In this model, both native kidneys are removed and renal function is provided entirely by the transplanted kidney, such that four experimental groups with restricted ACE2 expression are generated: WT\u2192WT (WT), KO\u2192WT (KidneyKO), WT\u2192KO (SystemicKO), and KO\u2192KO (TotalKO). Additionally, we used nanoscale mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify ACE2 fragments in early glomerular filtrate of mice.\nAlthough significant differences in BP were not detected, a major finding of our study is that shed or soluble ACE2 (sACE2) was present in urine of KidneyKO mice that lack renal ACE2 expression. Detection of sACE2 in the urine of KidneyKO mice during AngII-mediated hypertension suggests that sACE2 originating from extrarenal tissues can reach the kidney and be excreted in urine. To confirm glomerular filtration of ACE2, we used micropuncture and nanoscale proteomics to detect peptides derived from ACE2 in the Bowman's space.\nOur findings suggest that both systemic and renal tissues may contribute to sACE2 in urine, identifying the kidney as a major site for ACE2 actions. Moreover, filtration of sACE2 into the lumen of the nephron may contribute to the pathophysiology of kidney diseases characterized by disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier.", "journal": "Kidney360", "date": "2023-01-03", "authors": ["Jonathan WNelson", "David IOrtiz-Melo", "Natalie KMattocks", "Jacqueline MEmathinger", "JessicaPrescott", "KatherineXu", "Robert CGriffiths", "RumieWakasaki", "Paul DPiehowski", "Michael PHutchens", "Thomas MCoffman", "Susan BGurley"], "doi": "10.34067/KID.0001622022\n10.1161/01.RES.87.5.e1\n10.1073/pnas.1432869100\n10.1074/jbc.M002615200\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.060977\n10.1038/sj.ki.5002373\n10.1016/j.tem.2004.03.001\n10.1073/pnas.2003138117\n10.1126/science.abb2762\n10.2215/CJN.03530320\n10.1172/JCI16980\n10.1002/phy2.264\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000259942.38108.20\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.114322\n10.2119/molmed.2010.00111\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000205833.89478.5b\n10.1021/bi200525y\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301811\n10.1681/ASN.2012050493\n10.1172/jci.insight.122130\n10.1172/JCI23378\n10.1681/ASN.2016060675\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.03.001\n10.4049/jimmunol.1502234\n10.1073/pnas.0605545103\n10.1681/ASN.2009121306\n10.1152/ajprenal.00305.2011\n10.1074/jbc.M505111200\n10.1681/ASN.2006050423\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.119.14079\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033942\n10.1152/ajpcell.00036.2009\n10.1152/ajplung.00071.2009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0085958\n10.1152/ajprenal.00516.2013\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01274"}

Cultured rat cardiomyocytes (H9c2) and human cardiac fibroblasts (HCF) were stimulated with hypoxia or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to observe the release of sTEM1 into culture media. The conditioned media of hypoxia-stimulated H9c2 cells was harvested and added into cultured cardiac fibroblast to evaluate its biological effect.\nImmunofluorescence study of biopsy specimens from three HF patients showed TEM1 expression in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts.

{"title": "Delineation of the healthy rabbit heart by immunohistochemistry - A technical note.", "abstract": "Heart failure poses a big health problem and may result from obesity, smoking, alcohol and/or growing age. Studying pathological heart tissue demands accurate histological and immunohistochemical stainings in animal models, including chromogenic and fluorescent approaches. Moreover, a reliable set of healthy heart stainings and labeling are required, in order to provide a reference for the pathological situation. Heart and brain tissue of a healthy rabbit were collected, and different histological key steps were compared, such as paraffin embedding after formalin fixation versus cryopreservation; an antigen retrieval (AR) step in processing paraffin sections versus the same procedure without AR; or a chromogenic with a fluorescent detection system, respectively. Using serial sections, we stained the same morphological structure with classic approaches (HE, Masson Goldner Trichrome (GT) and Elastica van Gieson (EL)) and with different markers, including collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, \u03b1-SMA, protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) which is an inflammation-related marker, and ki67 for proliferating cells. Differences between conditions were quantitatively assessed by measuring the color intensity. Generally, cryosections exhibited a more prominent signal intensity in immunohistochemically labeled sections than in paraffin sections, but the strong staining was slurry, which sometimes impeded proper identification of morphological structures, particularly at higher magnifications. In addition, the advantage of an AR step was observed when compared to the condition without AR, where signal intensities were significantly lower. Different stainings of the heart arteries and the myocardium revealed a clear distribution of extracellular matrix components, with prominent collagen III in the artery wall, but an absence of collagen III in the myocardium. Moreover, paraffin-embedded sections provided more distinct structures compared to cryosections after collagen III, ki67, fibronectin, and \u03b1-SMA labeling. As for the Purkinje cells that were depicted in the heart and the cerebellum (Purkinje neurons), we found GT staining most suitable to depict them in the heart, while HE as well as EL staining was ideal to depict Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. In sum, we provide useful reference images with different stainings for researchers using the rabbit heart or brain model. Such images can help to decide which of the immunohistochemical protocols are valuable to reach a specific aim.

However, PVDFs' hydrophobic nature requires modifications by incorporating natural polymers. In this study, we focussed on the hybrid electrospinning of PVDF and gelatine and the further introduction of graphene oxide nanoparticles to investigate either hydrophilicity or piezoelectricity enhancement and its impact on mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes. The results revealed a nanofibre diameter of 379\u2009\u00b1\u200973\u2009nm for the PVDF/gelatine/graphene oxide (PVDF-GO-CG) platform, providing excellent tensile strength. Additionally, hydrophilicity was improved by gelatine and GO incorporation compared with pure PVDF. Cellular studies also showed an elongated morphology of cardiomyocytes, similar to the myocardial tissue, as well as high viability and non-toxicity in the PVDF-GO-CG scaffold according to the average survival rate. Furthermore, the expression of connexin 43 and troponin T genes underwent an increment of 41 and 35% in the PVDF-GO-CG compared with the PVDF-CG sample.

{"title": "RADIATION-INDUCED DAMAGE TO THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM AFTER RADIATION THERAPY IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER.", "abstract": "Despite current research in the development of drugbased cytostatic and targeted therapies in the treatment of breast cancer, radiation therapy (RT) is an important component in the treatment of this pathology in the postoperative period. At the same time, an important problem is the development of pathological changes in the heart in the longterm period, which worsen the quality of life and increase the risk of cardiac death 10 or more years after RT The problem of heart damage due to RT is gaining new significance due to the existing increase in the number of cancer patients requiring radiation exposure in the modern world. RT of malignant tumors of the breast and organs of the chest cavity causes damage to all structures of the heart, including the coronary arteries, valves, conducting system, pericardium. The frequency of heart damage increases in proportion to the time that has passed after RT. According to some authors, the prevalence of clinically significant radiationinduced heart diseases 5-10 years after RT is 10-30%, and the frequency of asymptomatic lesions is 88%. The duration of the latent period can reach 15-20 years. The work has an analysis of longterm studies of the presence of pathological changes that are found in the heart tissues of patients with breast cancer, as a result of radiation therapy.\nNezvazhaiuchy na suchasni doslidzhennia v rozvytku medykamentozno\u00ef tsytostatychno\u00efi targetno\u00efterapi\u00ef v likuvanniraku molochno\u00ef zalozy, promeneva terapiia (PT) ie vazhlyvym komponentom u likuvanni dano\u00ef patologi\u00ef v pisliaoperatsi\u012dnomu periodi.

We have previously developed a chemically crosslinked shape memory elastomer, poly (glycerol dodecanedioate) (PGD), exhibiting tunable transition temperatures around body temperature (34-38\u00a0\u00b0C), exhibiting nonlinear elastic properties approximating cardiac tissues, and favorable degradation rates in vitro. Degree of tissue coverage, degradation and consequent changes in polymer thermomechanical properties, and inflammatory response in preclinical animal models are unknown material attributes required for translating this material into cardiovascular devices. This study investigates changes in the polymer structure, tissue coverage, endothelialization, and inflammation of percutaneously implanted PGD patches (20\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a09\u00a0mm x 0.5\u00a0mm) into the branch pulmonary arteries of Yorkshire pigs for three months. After three months in vivo, 5/8 samples exhibited (100%) tissue coverage, 2/8 samples exhibited 85-95% tissue coverage, and 1/8 samples exhibited limited (<20%) tissue coverage with mild-moderate inflammation. PGD explants showed a (60-70%) volume loss and (25-30%) mass loss, and a reduction in polymer crosslinks. Lumenal and mural surfaces and the cross-section of the explant demonstrated evidence of degradation.

The present research was designed to determine the protective action of vitamins (Vits) A, C and E on the heart toxicity induced by ZnO NPs.\nFifty-four male Wistar rats were allocated into 9 groups of 6 and then exposed to ZnO NPs (200\u00a0mg/kg), water (Control1), olive oil (Control2), Vit A (1000 IU/kg), Vit C (200\u00a0mg/kg), Vit E (100 IU/kg) and three groups were co-treated with ZnO and one of the Vits A, C or E. The oxidative stress situation was evaluated by measuring oxidative stress markers and the tissue antioxidant enzyme activity. Besides, the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and Bax and caspase 3,7 activity were assessed. A histopathological examination was also performed to determine the rate of cardiac injury.\nThe results indicated that co-administration of ZnO NPs and the aforementioned Vits significantly reduced the total oxidant status and lipid peroxidation relative to the ZnO group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, the supplementation of vitamins, notably Vit E, decreased the ZnO NPs-induced oxidative damage by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes compared to the ZnO NPs-fed rats (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Data also showed the mitigating effects of Vits against ZnO NPs-mediated apoptosis by suppressing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 expression and caspase 3,7 activity.\nThis study highlights the protective role of Vits A, C and E against ZnO NPs cardiotoxicity, though at different levels of effectiveness.", "journal": "Molecular biology reports", "date": "2022-12-30", "authors": ["AlirezaEkhlasian", "EbrahimEftekhar", "SajedehDaei", "RoghayehAbbasalipourkabir", "AlirezaNourian", "NasrinZiamajidi"], "doi": "10.1007/s11033-022-08103-8\n10.1289/ehp.1306957\n10.1007/s10534-018-0113-7\n10.1007/s10311-020-01033-6\n10.1080/01480545.2018.1491987\n10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109719\n10.1055/s-0033-1334923\n10.3897/folmed.64.e66784\n10.1007/s12011-020-02487-z\n10.3390/nu14112214\n10.2147/IJN.S171931\n10.1016/j.fct.2015.08.019\n10.1111/j.1478-3231.2008.01745.x\n10.1159/000374041\n10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.11.007\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1016/j.fct.2016.02.002\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119823\n10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101357\n10.2147/IJN.S192740\n10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103290\n10.1007/s12011-021-02774-3\n10.1007/s12011-021-02606-4\n10.1016/j.fct.2018.01.055\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.11.128\n10.1016/j.procbio.2020.01.010\n10.1007/s11356-020-08919-6"}

{"title": "The potential mechanism of histamine-inducing cardiopulmonary inflammation and apoptosis in a novel oral model of rat intoxication.", "abstract": "Histamine (HIS) is a potent vasodilator that contributes to anaphylactic reactions. Our investigation aims to study the possible toxic impact of repeated oral administration of histamine on the target organs of HIS poisoning (lung & heart) in rats as a model of scombroid poisoning. We used 15 rats that were separated into three groups with 5 rats in each. All rats received the treatments orally for 14 days as follows; (1): distilled water, (2) HIS at a dosage level of 250\u00a0mg/kg BWT daily and (3) HIS at a dosage level of 1750\u00a0mg/kg BWT weekly. Our results revealed that the consumption of HIS either daily or weekly could cause marked cardiopulmonary toxicity in rats. HIS can trigger inflammatory reactions in the cardiopulmonary tissues and induce oxidative stress damage along with apoptosis of such organs. HIS was markedly increase the MDA levels and decrease the CAT and GSH activity in both lung and heart tissues. The main pathological lesion observed is inflammation which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and demonstrated strong iNOS and TNF-\u03b1 protein expressions. Cardiac muscles showed extensive degeneration and necrosis and displayed strong casp-3 protein expression. Additionally, all HIS receiving groups noticed marked elevation of the pulmonary transcription levels of Cox2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL1\u03b2 along with substantial elevation of casp-3 and bax genes and downregulation of Bcl2 gene in the cardiac tissue. We concluded that the oral administration of HIS either daily or weekly can induce cardiopulmonary toxicity via the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in ROS overgeneration and inducing both oxidative stress and apoptosis.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2022-12-25", "authors": ["Eman IHassanen", "ShaimaaKamel", "Wafaa AMohamed", "Hayam AMansour", "Mahmoud AMahmoud"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2022.153410"}
{"title": "Administration of Huperzine A microspheres ameliorates myocardial ischemic injury via \u03b17nAChR-dependent JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor (AChEI) is well established as \ufb01rst-line agents for relieving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Injectable sustained-release formulation of AChEI may be suitable for treating AD patients. However, it needs to know whether continuous inhibition of AChE could deteriorate or attenuate myocardial damage if myocardial ischemia (MI) occurs. Huperzine A microspheres (HAM) are a sustained-release formulation releasing sustainably huperzine A (an AChEI) for more than 7 days after a single dose of HAM. This study aimed to investigate the myocardial damage in an isoprenaline (ISO)-induced MI mice model during HAM treatment. The heart injury was evaluated by assaying serum CK-MB, Tn-I and observing histopathological changes. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines in serum were detected. The level of p-P65 and the expression of proteins in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway were assayed with Western blot. Administration with a single dose of HAM resulted in inhibiting the MI-induced increases of CK-MB and Tn-I, alleviating the damage of heart tissue, and decreasing the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. In addition, HAM decreased the levels of p-P65, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 in heart tissue. The effects of HAM could be weakened or abolished by the specific \u03b17nAChR antagonist.

This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of TRZ-induced cardiotoxicity based on RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bioinformatics analysis. Kunming mice were exposed to 10\u00a0mg/kg TRZ for 6 and 10\u00a0days, followed by echocardiography, histopathology and serum biochemical analysis to evaluate the cardiotoxicity model. The results showed no significant changes after 6\u00a0days administration of TRZ. After 10\u00a0days administration of TRZ, the mice showed cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury and fibrosis, and the serum levels of LDH, CK, CK-MB and cTnI were increased compared to the control [CON (Day 10)] group, indicating the cardiotoxicity model was successfully established.

Results based on Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and RT-PCR revealed that the CD74/STAT1 signaling pathway might play an important role in TRZ-induced cardiotoxicity.

Even if it has been deeply studied, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is still a side-effect of the clinical treatment for several heart diseases: ischemia process itself leads to temporary damage to heart tissue and obviously the recovery of blood flow is promptly required even if it worsens the ischemic injury. There is no doubt that mitochondria play a key role in pathogenesis of IRI: dysfunctions of these important organelles alter cell homeostasis and survival. It has been demonstrated that during IRI the system of mitochondrial quality control undergoes alterations with the disruption of the complex balance between the processes of mitochondrial fusion, fission, biogenesis and mitophagy. The fundamental role of mitochondria is carried out thanks to the finely regulated connection to other organelles such as plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus, therefore impairments of these inter-organelle communications exacerbate IRI.

{"title": "Synergistic Effects of Ginsenoside Rb3 and Ferruginol in Ischemia-Induced Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Previous research shows that ginsenoside Rb3 (G-Rb3) exhibit significant protective effects on cardiomyocytes and is considered a promising treatment for myocardial infraction (MI). However, how to improve its oral bioavailability and reduce its dosage remains to be studied. Previous studies suggest that Ferruginol (FGL) may have synergistic effects with G-Rb3. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. In this study, left anterior descending branch (LAD) coronary artery ligation or oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD/R) were used to establish MI models in vivo and in vitro. Subsequently, the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of G-Rb3-FGL were explored by in vitro studies. The results showed that the G-Rb3-FGL co-treatment improved heart functions better than the G-Rb3 treatment alone in MI mice models. Meanwhile, the G-Rb3-FGL co-treatment can upregulate fatty acids oxidation (FAO) and suppress oxidative stress in the heart tissues of MI mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that the synergistic effect of G-Rb3-FGL on FAO, oxidation and inflammation was abolished by RXR\u03b1 inhibitor HX531 in the H9C2 cell model. In summary, we revealed that G-Rb3 and FGL have a synergistic effect against MI. They protected cardiomyocytes by promoting FAO, inhibiting oxidative stress, and suppressing inflammation through the RXR\u03b1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["XuChen", "TiantianLiu", "QiyanWang", "HuiWang", "SimingXue", "QianqianJiang", "JunjunLi", "ChunLi", "WeiWang", "YongWang"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms232415935\n10.1016/j.jchf.2017.09.015\n10.1093/cvr/cvz053\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.01.001\n10.1002/ejhf.592\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32279-7\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.012\n10.1126/sciadv.aay2939\n10.1074/jbc.M208173200\n10.1073/pnas.0504343102\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000023531.22727.C1\n10.1111/bph.14682\n10.1038/aps.2014.109\n10.1038/nature07413\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3386\n10.1016/j.arr.2020.101250\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.190\n10.3389/fphar.2021.682273\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109487\n10.3390/ijms18071364\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.002\n10.1155/2019/3714508\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.07.004\n10.1007/s11010-012-1265-3\n10.1538/expanim.16-0121\n10.3892/mmr.2015.3394\n10.1016/j.jgr.2018.09.001\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01414\n10.1038/aps.2017.210\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00458\n10.1186/s12906-019-2458-z\n10.3389/fphar.2021.773834\n10.1126/science.1168750\n10.1002/cphy.c150006\n10.1016/j.jep.2020.112859\n10.1111/cns.12350\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01209\n10.1002/adhm.202001571\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318241\n10.1007/s00011-016-0922-5\n10.1002/jcp.22457\n10.1038/s41392-022-00925-z\n10.1007/s12035-017-0389-6\n10.3390/antiox9040285\n10.1007/s00259-021-05411-2\n10.1007/s40262-020-00867-1\n10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153617\n10.1016/j.phymed.2019.152949\n10.1016/j.jep.2021.113823\n10.1016/j.jep.2021.114841"}
{"title": "Quo Vadis? Immunodynamics of Myeloid Cells after Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI), a major contributor to worldwide morbidity and mortality, is caused by a lack of blood flow to the heart. Affected heart tissue becomes ischemic due to deficiency of blood perfusion and oxygen delivery. In case sufficient blood flow cannot be timely restored, cardiac injury with necrosis occurs. The ischemic/necrotic area induces a systemic inflammatory response and hundreds of thousands of leukocytes are recruited from the blood to the injured heart. The blood pool of leukocytes is rapidly depleted and urgent re-supply of these cells is needed. Myeloid cells are generated in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen, released into the blood, travel to sites of need, extravasate and accumulate inside tissues to accomplish various functions. In this review we focus on the \"leukocyte supply chain\" and will separately evaluate different myeloid cell compartments (BM, spleen, blood, heart) in steady state and after MI. Moreover, we highlight the local and systemic kinetics of extracellular factors, chemokines and danger signals involved in the regulation of production/generation, release, transportation, uptake, and activation of myeloid cells during the inflammatory phase of MI.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["AldoMoggio", "HeribertSchunkert",

However, current differentiation systems still rely on static culture conditions and specialized commercial microwells for aggregation, which hinders the full potential of hiPSC-derived cardiac tissues. Herein, we integrate cost-effective and reproducible manual aggregation of hiPSC-derived cardiac progenitors with Matrigel encapsulation and a dynamic culture to support hiPSC cardiac differentiation and self-organization. Manual aggregation at day 7 of cardiac differentiation resulted in 97% of beating aggregates with 78% of cTnT-positive cells. Matrigel encapsulation conjugated with a dynamic culture promoted cell migration and the creation of organized structures, with observed cell polarization and the creation of lumens. In addition, encapsulation increased buoyancy and decreased coalescence of the hiPSC-derived cardiac aggregates. Moreover, VEGF supplementation increased over two-fold the percentage of CD31-positive cells resulting in the emergence of microvessel-like structures. Thus, this study shows that the explored culture parameters support the self-organization of hiPSC-derived cardiac microtissues containing multiple cardiac cell types. Additional stimuli (e.g., BMP) in long-term scalable and fully automatized cultures can further potentiate highly structured and mature hiPSC-derived cardiac models, contributing to the development of reliable platforms for high-throughput drug screening and disease modeling.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["Tiago PDias", "Sandra NPinto", "SandraCarvalho", "Tiago GFernandes", "F\u00e1bioFernandes", "Maria MargaridaDiogo", "Maria CPeleteiro", "ManuelPrieto", "Joaquim M SCabral"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms232415785\n10.1038/nrd3252\n10.1038/nrd4609\n10.1016/j.drudis.2013.11.014\n10.1126/science.1247125\n10.1038/nature12517\n10.1038/nature12271\n10.1038/nature09691\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.082\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601896\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1126/science.aaw7567\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0183\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0563\n10.1002/bit.22065\n10.1038/s41598-019-45047-9\n10.1073/pnas.1311120110\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.06.002\n10.1242/dev.143966\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.03.009\n10.1016/j.stem.2021.11.007\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.1038/s41467-021-25329-5\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.034\n10.1002/bit.27797\n10.1186/s13036-019-0204-1\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.11.033\n10.1007/7651_2020_336\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.11.013\n10.1038/nature07935\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.008\n10.1038/nature11826\n10.1038/nature09941\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.12.039\n10.1242/dev.096628\n10.1002/jctb.5074\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.198\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018293\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.09.017\n10.1038/nrc1478\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.11.004\n10.1016/j.mex.2016.10.005\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.06.001\n10.1016/j.bmc.2022.116782\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c01800\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1038/nmeth.2019"}
{"title": "A Study on the Protective Effect of sRAGE-MSCs in a Rodent Reperfusion Model of Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the major leading causes of death in humans globally. Recently, increased levels of recruited macrophages and AGE-albumin were observed in the hearts of humans and animals with acute myocardial infarction. Thus, the purposes of this study were to investigate whether the elevated levels of AGE-albumin from activated macrophage cells are implicated in ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death and to develop therapeutic strategies for AMI based on its underlying molecular mechanisms with respect to AGEs. The present study demonstrated that activated macrophages and AGE-albumin were observed in heart tissues obtained from humans and rats with AMI incidences. In the cellular model of AMI, it was found that increased expression of AGE-albumin was shown to be co-localized with macrophages, and the presence of AGE-albumin led to increased expression of RAGE through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. After revealing cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by toxicity of the AGE-RAGE system, sRAGE-secreting MSCs were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 platform to investigate the therapeutic effects of sRAGE-MSCs in an AMI rat model. Gene-edited sRAGE-MSCs showed greater therapeutic effects against AMI pathogenesis in rat models compared to mock MSCs, and promising results of the functional improvement of stem cells could result in significant improvements in the clinical management of cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["DelgerBayarsaikhan", "GovigerelBayarsaikhan", "JaewonLee", "BongheeLee"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms232415630\n10.2147/IPRP.S133088\n10.1016/j.carpath.2005.03.006\n10.1177/1089253211436350\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1186/s13287-020-01762-z\n10.1002/jcb.26169\n10.3390/ijms20061420\n10.1159/000492704\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.2225\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.982777\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00107\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00434-5\n10.1042/CS20080581\n10.1161/01.RES.0000246113.82111.2d\n10.1038/s41598-017-11773-1\n10.3390/antiox11050936\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037917\n10.1038/s12276-021-00561-7\n10.3390/antiox10030434\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.02.030\n10.1007/s10719-016-9679-x\n10.3390/ijms14022242\n10.1186/s40035-018-0106-z\n10.1152/ajpheart.01210.2007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.212217\n10.1074/jbc.M110.117457\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010092\n10.3390/ijms21072346\n10.1161/01.RES.0000189270.72915.D1\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101151\n10.5115/acb.2012.45.1.47\n10.1371/journal.pone.0104699\n10.1016/j.mam.2018.07.001\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.818188\n10.3390/ijms21239263\n10.1038/s41419-021-03750-4\n10.1155/2017/1428537\n10.3389/fgene.2017.00187\n10.1038/s41598-017-14667-4\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2014.12.022\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000829\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.312319\n10.1155/2021/9570971\n10.1080/08820139.2021.1928183\n10.1055/s-0039-3400541\n10.1194/jlr.M038968\n10.1155/2013/129360\n10.15283/ijsc18110\n10.1038/srep35933\n10.1186/s13063-022-06594-1\n10.1186/s13287-021-02667-1\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.08.026\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088259\n10.1038/srep42027\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00033.2007"}
{"title": "Modified mRNA Therapeutics for Heart Diseases.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a substantial global health problem and the leading cause of death worldwide. Although many conventional small-molecule treatments are available to support the cardiac function of the patient with CVD, they are not effective as a cure. Among potential targets for gene therapy are severe cardiac and peripheral ischemia, heart failure, vein graft failure, and some forms of dyslipidemias. In the last three decades, multiple gene therapy tools have been used for heart diseases caused by proteins, plasmids, adenovirus, and adeno-associated viruses (AAV), but these remain as unmet clinical needs. These gene therapy methods are ineffective due to poor and uncontrolled gene expression, low stability, immunogenicity, and transfection efficiency. The synthetic modified mRNA (modRNA) presents a novel gene therapy approach which provides a transient, stable, safe, non-immunogenic, controlled mRNA delivery to the heart tissue without any risk of genomic integration, and achieves a therapeutic effect in different organs, including the heart. The mRNA translation starts in minutes, and remains stable for 8-10 days (pulse-like kinetics). The pulse-like expression of modRNA in the heart induces cardiac repair, cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival, and inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis post-myocardial infarction (MI). Cell-specific (cardiomyocyte) modRNA translation developments established cell-specific modRNA therapeutics for heart diseases. With these laudable characteristics, combined with its expression kinetics in the heart, modRNA has become an attractive therapeutic for the treatment of CVD. This review discusses new developments in modRNA therapy for heart diseases.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["AjitMagadum"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms232415514\n10.2165/00129784-200505060-00002\n10.1136/hrt.2005.062018\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.18632/aging.100526\n10.1101/gad.1306705\n10.1038/nature22978\n10.1038/nature15372\n10.1038/nm1619\n10.1038/nature11739\n10.1016/j.omtn.2018.08.021\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043067\n10.1126/science.1199010\n10.1038/mt.2015.193\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3006681\n10.1101/cshperspect.a014035\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311311\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315856\n10.1097/HCO.0000000000000724\n10.1016/j.bcp.2021.114432\n10.1056/NEJMoa2035389\n10.1038/d41573-020-00078-0\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-060614-034316\n10.1038/190576a0\n10.1073/pnas.86.16.6077\n10.1126/science.1690918\n10.1038/mt.2008.200\n10.1016/j.immuni.2005.06.008\n10.1038/nbt.1733\n10.1038/mt.2011.67\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022064\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.03.016\n10.1021/mp5006239\n10.1038/nbt.2682\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041882\n10.1016/j.omtm.2020.03.019\n10.1002/cpz1.39\n10.26508/lsa.201900424\n10.1016/j.omtm.2018.04.003\n10.1016/j.omtm.2019.07.006\n10.1089/ten.tea.2017.0445\n10.1007/978-1-4939-6588-5_8\n10.1007/978-1-4939-6588-5_10\n10.1038/cr.2013.112\n10.1016/j.str.2004.03.015\n10.1038/nbt.3301\n10.1038/nrd3864\n10.1016/j.ceb.2009.01.029\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00130.2010\n10.1038/nature08804\n10.1002/jez.1401870208\n10.1038/nature12054\n10.1038/cr.2017.84\n10.1038/ncb3149\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.060\n10.1016/j.canlet.2013.06.008\n10.1186/s13578-019-0317-8\n10.1073/pnas.1108559108\n10.1155/2016/9583268\n10.1186/1476-511X-9-15\n10.1016/j.cjca.2014.12.007\n10.1007/s00395-016-0533-x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.02.019\n10.1074/jbc.271.51.33110\n10.33594/000000107\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000003\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.033\n10.1038/nature24045\n10.1089/ars.2012.5149\n10.1093/cvr/cvn335\n10.1096/fj.09-145508\n10.5114/aoms.2016.63259\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000061911.47710.8A\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.2.118\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)01144-X\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302802\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.25.2800\n10.1038/mt.2009.70\n10.1038/s41467-019-08852-4\n10.1038/s41598-018-35570-6\n10.1002/psp4.12516\n10.1093/nar/gkq347"}
{"title": "Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy and Tissue Regeneration: A Literature Survey.", "abstract": "By addressing the mechanisms involved in transcription, signaling, stress reaction, apoptosis and cell-death, cellular structure and cell-to-cell contacts, adhesion, migration as well as inflammation; HBO upregulates processes involved in repair while mechanisms perpetuating tissue damage are downregulated. Many experimental and clinical studies, respectively, cover wound healing, regeneration of neural tissue, of bone and cartilage, muscle, and cardiac tissue as well as intestinal barrier function. Following acute injury or in chronic healing problems HBO modulates proteins or molecules involved in inflammation, apoptosis, cell growth, neuro- and angiogenesis, scaffolding, perfusion, vascularization, and stem-cell mobilization, initiating repair by a variety of mechanisms, some of them based on the modulation of micro-RNAs. HBO affects the oxidative stress response via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) or c-Jun N-terminal peptide and downregulates inflammation by the modulation of high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB-1), toll-like receptor 4 and 2 (TLR-4, TLR-2), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF\u03baB), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1) and nitric oxide (NO\u2022). HBO enhances stem-cell homeostasis via Wnt glycoproteins and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and improves cell repair, growth, and differentiation via the two latter but also by modulation of extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. The HBO-induced downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 (MMP-2/-9), rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and integrins improve healing by tissue remodeling. Interestingly, the action of HBO on single effector proteins or molecules may involve both up- or downregulation, respectively, depending on their initial level. This probably mirrors a generally stabilizing potential of HBO that tends to restore the physiological balance rather than enhancing or counteracting single mechanisms.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["JLindenmann", "LKamolz", "WGraier", "JSmolle", "F-MSmolle-Juettner"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines10123145\n10.3390/ijms222111754\n10.28920/dhm47.2.131-132\n10.1111/febs.15646\n10.1002/wdev.361\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.01.056\n10.1016/j.arr.2019.100942\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173395\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.830574\n10.4238/gmr.15016933\n10.1155/2022/2949824\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.04.031\n10.1007/s12192-009-0159-0\n10.1002/adhm.201801210\n10.1007/s10753-021-01615-8\n10.1186/rr14\n10.1097/01.prs.0000225430.42531.c2\n10.1038/s41598-020-59615-x\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0010\n10.1007/s00421-011-2027-8\n10.1097/01.ASW.0000280198.81130.d5\n10.1016/j.bbi.2004.09.003\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.10.014\n10.1111/wrr.12108\n10.1016/j.jss.2013.01.004\n10.3390/ijms22168992\n10.1038/s41467-021-23448-7\n10.1152/ajpgi.00192.2020\n10.1111/wrr.12708\n10.1111/wrr.12253\n10.22462/01.03.2019.4\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118246\n10.1038/jid.2008.53\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.005116\n10.3390/biom10060958\n10.1002/jor.22443\n10.1155/2021/6645766\n10.1371/journal.pone.0198464\n10.1002/stem.1553\n10.3390/ph12020079\n10.1111/wrr.12782\n10.1016/j.lfs.2013.10.015\n10.22462/3.4.2017.5\n10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120393\n10.3390/ijms21082718\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.117170\n10.1038/s41392-020-00312-6\n10.1097/BRS.0000000000000005\n10.1016/j.neulet.2018.10.059\n10.1097/WNR.0000000000000901\n10.2147/NDT.S183632\n10.1007/s00221-021-06249-8\n10.3109/03008201003746679\n10.18632/oncotarget.19294\n10.1080/21541248.2020.1822721\n10.3389/fneur.2020.563281\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.012\n10.1038/s41392-021-00762-6\n10.1186/1471-2474-15-56\n10.1055/s-0034-1397344\n10.1155/2022/9030771\n10.1186/s13075-019-1830-1\n10.1016/j.joca.2019.05.011\n10.1186/s13018-020-02114-6\n10.1111/jcmm.15889\n10.5483/BMBRep.2014.47.12.241\n10.1371/journal.pone.0237746\n10.1097/ACO.0000000000000773\n10.3390/biom11081210\n10.3390/biom11101520\n10.3390/biom11070925\n10.3390/medicina57090864\n10.3390/medicina57010049\n10.1007/s10571-020-00921-3\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr304\n10.3390/ijms19103217\n10.1124/pharmrev.121.000349"}
{"title": "Differentiating Human Pluripotent Stem Cells to Cardiomyocytes Using Purified Extracellular Matrix Proteins.", "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated into cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs, respectively), which hold great promise for cardiac regenerative medicine and disease modeling efforts. However, the most widely employed differentiation protocols require undefined substrates that are derived from xenogeneic (animal) products, contaminating resultant hESC- and iPSC-CM cultures with xenogeneic proteins and limiting their clinical applicability. Additionally, typical hESC- and iPSC-CM protocols produce CMs that are significantly contaminated by non-CMs and that are immature, requiring lengthy maturation procedures. In this review, we will summarize recent studies that have investigated the ability of purified extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to support hESC- and iPSC-CM differentiation, with a focus on commercially available ECM proteins and coatings to make such protocols widely available to researchers. The most promising of the substrates reviewed here include laminin-521 with laminin-221 together or Synthemax (a synthetic vitronectin-based peptide coating), which both resulted in highly pure CM cultures. Future efforts are needed to determine whether combinations of specific purified ECM proteins or derived peptides could further improve CM maturation and culture times, and significantly improve hESC- and iPSC-CM differentiation protocols.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["Ashlynn MBarnes", "Tessa BHolmstoen", "Andrew JBonham", "Teisha JRowland"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering9120720\n10.1126/science.282.5391.1145\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1126/science.1151526\n10.7554/eLife.69028\n10.1039/C9BM00817A\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.1253/circj.CJ-12-0987\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.198\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.083\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1038/nbt1102\n10.1021/bi00267a025\n10.1038/nbt1001-971\n10.1038/nbt1177\n10.1002/term.1458\n10.1016/j.exer.2008.03.014\n10.18240/ijo.2021.08.04\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0049\n10.1242/jcs.023820\n10.1038/nrm3904\n10.1038/s42003-021-02910-8\n10.1007/s10439-019-02337-7\n10.3390/molecules25215189\n10.1002/mabi.201800079\n10.3390/bioengineering7030105\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.04.006\n10.1088/1758-5090/ac1257\n10.1007/s12015-020-10061-2\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00133\n10.3390/ijms21093404\n10.1007/s00441-021-03414-x\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.12.002\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.831300\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.273144\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00019\n10.1038/s41467-021-23329-z\n10.1172/JCI200112131\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2016.09.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1038/cr.2011.195\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.12.008\n10.1038/s41598-019-45047-9\n10.3390/bioengineering7030092\n10.1016/0014-4827(92)90397-Q\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.003638\n10.1016/S0955-0674(97)80124-X\n10.1002/path.1416\n10.1172/JCI114957\n10.1089/scd.2009.0328\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00643.x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.07.111\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0352\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0291\n10.1016/j.tcb.2019.10.001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306874\n10.1089/scd.2012.0586\n10.1080/03008200591008527\n10.1242/jcs.108.6.2321\n10.1242/jcs.03098\n10.1247/csf.24.19\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.01.005\n10.1101/2022.05.15.491904\n10.1007/s00018-009-0179-z\n10.1038/ncomms4195\n10.1007/s12265-012-9407-2\n10.1038/s41598-021-87186-y\n10.1039/D0BM01247E\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01112\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.058\n10.3390/ijms23031312\n10.1007/7651-2013-64\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.01.005\n10.1016/j.vascn.2021.107083\n10.1016/0014-4827(92)90173-6\n10.1016/0955-0674(93)90036-P\n10.1016/S1357-2725(99)00005-9\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.05.007"}
{"title": "Succinate level is increased and succinate dehydrogenase exerts forward and reverse catalytic activities in lipopolysaccharides-stimulated cardiac tissue: The protective role of dimethyl malonate.", "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the alterations of myocardial succinate and fumarate levels with or without succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitor dimethyl malonate during 24\u00a0h of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) challenge, as well as the effects of dimethyl malonate on the impaired cardiac tissue. Myocardial succinate and fumarate levels were increased in the initial 9\u00a0h of LPS challenge. During this time, dimethyl malonate increased the succinate level, decreased the fumarate level, aggravated the cardiac dysfunction, reduced the oxidative stress, had little effect on interleukin-1\u03b2 production, promoted interleukin-10 production and bothered the ATP production. Co-treatment with exogenous succinate significantly increased interleukin-1\u03b2 production in this period. After 12\u00a0h of LPS challenge, myocardial the succinate level increased sharply, while the fumarate level gradually decreased. During 12-24\u00a0h of LPS challenge, dimethyl malonate effectively reduced the succinate level, increased the fumarate level, improved cardiac dysfunction, inhibited interleukin-1\u03b2 production, and had little effect on oxidative stress, interleukin-10 production, and ATP production. LPS challenge also significantly increased the myocardial succinate receptor 1 expression and circulating succinate level. Inhibition of succinate receptor 1 significantly reduced the mRNA expression of interleukin-1\u03b2. In conclusion, the current study suggests that myocardial succinate accumulates during LPS challenge, and that SDH activity may be transformed (from forward to reversed) and involved in a line of stress response. Dimethyl malonate inhibits SDH and, depending on the time of treatment, reduces LPS-induced cardiac impairment. Furthermore, accumulated succinate exerts pro-inflammatory effects partly via succinate receptor 1 signaling.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2022-12-23", "authors": ["YuWang", "HongmeiTao", "WenjingTang", "SiqiWu", "YinTang", "LingLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.175472"}
{"title": "Effects of Thymoquinone Alone or in Combination with Losartan on the Cardiotoxicity Caused by Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Hypercholesterolemia.", "abstract": "Dietary cholesterol accelerates oxidative and pro-inflammatory processes, causing hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the purpose of the current study is to compare the protective effects of thymoquinone (TQ) alone or in combination with losartan (LT) against the heart damage caused by a high-cholesterol diet (HCD). HCD-fed rat groups revealed an elevated activity of indicators of cardiac enzymes in the serum. Serum and cardiac lipids were also found to be significantly higher in HCD-fed rat groups. Cardiac pro-inflammatory and oxidative markers were also increased in HCD-fed rat groups, whereas antioxidant indicators were decreased. However, all of these biochemical, inflammatory, antioxidant, and oxidative change indicators returned to levels similar to those of normal rats after treatment with TQ alone or in combination with LT administered to HCD-fed rat groups. Hypercholesterolemia considerably induced the lipid peroxidation product, thiobarbituric acid reaction substances (TBARs), and oxidative radicals in cardiac cells, which were attenuated by QT and LT treatments, particularly when combined. Finally, QT, LT, and their combination were able to reduce the histological changes changes brought on by cholesterol excess in cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Combination of ", "abstract": "Anthracyclines are essential adjuvant therapies for a variety of cancers, particularly breast, gastric and esophageal cancers. Whilst prolonging cancer-related survival, these agents can induce drug-related cardiotoxicity. Spirulina, Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and Moringa are three nutraceuticals with anti-inflammatory effects that are currently used in cancer patients as complementary and alternative medicines to improve quality of life and fatigue. We hypothesize that the nutraceutical combination of Spirulina, Reishi and Moringa (Singo) could reduce inflammation and cardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines. Female C57Bl/6 mice were untreated (Sham, n = 6) or treated for 7 days with short-term doxorubicin (DOXO, n = 6) or Singo (Singo, n = 6), or pre-treated with Singo for 3 days and associated with DOXO for remaining 7 days (DOXO\u2212Singo, n = 6). The ejection fraction and radial and longitudinal strain were analyzed through transthoracic echocardiography (Vevo 2100, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The myocardial expressions of NLRP3, DAMPs (galectin-3 and calgranulin S100) and 13 cytokines were quantified through selective mouse ELISA methods. Myocardial fibrosis, necrosis and hypertrophy were analyzed through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Human cardiomyocytes were exposed to DOXO (200 nM) alone or in combination with Singo (at 10, 25 and 50 \u00b5g/mL) for 24 and 48 h. Cell viability and inflammation studies were also performed. In preclinical models, Singo significantly improved ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Reduced expressions of myocardial NLRP3 and NF-kB levels in cardiac tissues were seen in DOXO\u2212Singo mice vs. DOXO (p < 0.05). The myocardial levels of calgranulin S100 and galectin-3 were strongly reduced in DOXO\u2212Singo mice vs. DOXO (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry analysis indicates that Singo reduces fibrosis and hypertrophy in the myocardial tissues of mice during exposure to DOXO.

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Bio-Printed Cardiac Patch for Sustained Delivery of Extracellular Vesicles from the Interface.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering has emerged as a promising strategy to treat infarcted cardiac tissues by replacing the injured region with an ex vivo fabricated functional cardiac patch. Nevertheless, integration of the transplanted patch with the host tissue is still a burden, limiting its clinical application. Here, a bi-functional, 3D bio-printed cardiac patch (CP) design is proposed, composed of a cell-laden compartment at its core and an extracellular vesicle (EV)-laden compartment at its shell for better integration of the CP with the host tissue. Alginate-based bioink solutions were developed for each compartment and characterized rheologically, examined for printability and their effect on residing cells or EVs. The resulting 3D bio-printed CP was examined for its mechanical stiffness, showing an elastic modulus between 4-5 kPa at day 1 post-printing, suitable for transplantation. Affinity binding of EVs to alginate sulfate (AlgS) was validated, exhibiting dissociation constant values similar to those of EVs with heparin.

Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism leads to raised blood total cholesterol levels, a clinical condition called hypercholesterolemia. Evidence has shown that hypercholesterolemia is associated with the development of liver and heart disease. One of the mechanisms underlying heart and liver alterations induced by hypercholesterolemia is oxidative stress. In this regard, in several experimental studies, gold nanoparticles (AuNP) displayed antioxidant properties. We hypothesized that hypercholesterolemia causes redox system imbalance in the liver and cardiac tissues, and AuNP treatment could ameliorate it. Young adult male Swiss mice fed a regular rodent diet or a high cholesterol diet for eight weeks and concomitantly treated with AuNP (2.5 \u03bcg/kg) or vehicle by oral gavage. Hypercholesterolemia increased the nitrite concentration and glutathione (GSH) levels and decreased the liver's superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Also, hypercholesterolemia significantly enhanced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and GSH levels in cardiac tissue. Notably, AuNP promoted the redox system homeostasis, increasing the SOD activity in hepatic tissue and reducing ROS levels in cardiac tissue. Overall, our data showed that hypercholesterolemia triggered oxidative stress in mice's liver and heart, which was partially prevented by AuNP treatment.", "journal": "Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias", "date": "2022-12-22", "authors": ["Matheus SRodrigues", "Julia NMartins", "Gabriela C DEPaula", "Ligia MVenturini", "Gustavo DE BSilveira", "Em\u00edlio LStreck", "JosianiBudni", "Ricardo A Machado DE\u00c1vila", "Andreza F DEBem", "Paulo C LSilveira", "Jade DEOliveira"], "doi": "10.1590/0001-3765202220211081"}

{"title": "Bergenin alleviates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury via SIRT1 signaling.", "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. At present, reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis is a crucial therapeutic strategy for ameliorating MI/R injury. However, there is a lack of drugs targeting oxidative stress and apoptosis for the clinical therapy of MI/R. Bergenin is a reportedly effective agent with antioxidative and antiapoptotic activity against acute injury. Nevertheless, the roles and potential mechanisms of bergenin against MI/R injury remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that bergenin attenuated MI/R-induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via SIRT1. Mice were subjected to MI/R and treated with bergenin, after which the cardiac function, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, LDH release, and MDA content were evaluated. In vitro, myocardial injury model of H9c2 cells was induced by simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SI/R), apoptosis and oxidative stress was decreased after treated with bergenin. Bergenin significantly reduced myocardial apoptosis and ROS generation in vitro and improved cardiac function in vivo. Intriguingly, bergenin remarkably decreased apoptosis in cardiac tissue accompanied by SIRT1 upregulation following MI/R injury. Further studies showed that inhibiting SIRT1 blocked bergenin's beneficial impact against apoptosis following SI/R injury through excessive oxidative stress and depression of the Bcl2 to Bax ratio. Collectively, these findings indicate that bergenin alleviates MI/R injury by ameliorating myocardial apoptosis and oxidative damage via the SIRT1 signaling pathway.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2022-12-21", "authors": ["YingyingLiu", "YanzhenTan", "GuojieCao", "LeiShi", "YujieSong", "WenjuShan", "MiaoZhang", "PanpanLi", "HaitaoZhou", "BingZhang", "YangSun", "WeiYi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114100"}

{"title": "Nanomaterial-Based Electrically Conductive Hydrogels for Cardiac Tissue Repair.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is one of major causes of deaths, and its incidence has gradually increased worldwide. For cardiovascular diseases, several therapeutic approaches, such as drugs, cell-based therapy, and heart transplantation, are currently employed; however, their therapeutic efficacy and/or practical availability are still limited. Recently, biomaterial-based tissue engineering approaches have been recognized as promising for regenerating cardiac function in patients with cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI). In particular, materials mimicking the characteristics of native cardiac tissues can potentially prevent pathological progression and promote cardiac repair of the heart tissues post-MI. The mechanical (softness) and electrical (conductivity) properties of biomaterials as non-biochemical cues can improve the cardiac functions of infarcted hearts by mitigating myocardial cell death and subsequent fibrosis, which often leads to cardiac tissue stiffening and high electrical resistance. Consequently, electrically conductive hydrogels that can provide mechanical strength and augment the electrical activity of the infarcted heart tissue are considered new functional materials capable of mitigating the pathological progression to heart failure and stimulating cardiac regeneration. In this review, we highlight nanomaterial-incorporated hydrogels that can induce cardiac repair after MI. Nanomaterials, including carbon-based nanomaterials and recently discovered two-dimensional nanomaterials, offer great opportunities for developing functional conductive hydrogels owing to their excellent electrical conductivity, large surface area, and ease of modification.

{"title": "Evolution of myocardial oedema and fibrosis in HIV infected persons after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy: a prospective cardiovascular magnetic resonance study.", "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been shown to have functionally and structurally altered ventricles and may be related to cardiovascular inflammation. Mounting evidence suggests that the myocardium of HIV infected individuals may be abnormal before ART is initiated and may represent subclinical HIV-associated cardiomyopathy (HIVAC). The influence of ART on subclinical HIVAC is not known.\nNewly diagnosed, ART na\u00efve persons with HIV infection were enrolled along with HIV uninfected, age- and sex-matched controls. All participants underwent comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, including contrasted cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with multiparametric mapping on a 1.5T CMR\u00a0system. The HIV group was started on ART (tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir) and prospectively evaluated 9\u00a0months later. Cardiac tissue characterisation was compared in, and between groups using the appropriate statistical tests for the cross sectional data and the paired, prospective data respectively.\nSeventy-three ART na\u00efve HIV infected individuals (32\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0years, 45% female) and 22 healthy non-HIV subjects (33\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0years, 50% female) were enrolled. Compared with non-HIV healthy subjects, the global native T1 (1008\u2009\u00b1\u200931\u00a0ms vs 1032\u2009\u00b1\u200944\u00a0ms, p\u2009=\u20090.02), global T2 (46\u2009\u00b1\u20092 vs 48\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0ms, p\u2009=\u20090.006), and the prevalence of pericardial effusion (18% vs 67%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly higher in the HIV infected group at diagnosis. Global native T1 (1032\u2009\u00b1\u200944 to 1014\u2009\u00b1\u200934\u00a0ms, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and extracellular volume (ECV) (26\u2009\u00b1\u20094% to 25\u2009\u00b1\u20093%, p\u2009=\u20090.001) decreased significantly after 9\u00a0months on ART and were significantly associated with a decrease in the HIV viral load, decreased high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and improvement in the CD4 count (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Replacement fibrosis was significantly higher in the HIV infected group than controls (49% vs 10%, p\u2009=\u20090.02). The prevalence of late gadolinium enhancement did not change significantly over the 9-month study period (49% vs 55%, p\u2009=\u20090.4).\nSubclinical HIVAC may already be present at the time of HIV diagnosis, as suggested by the combination of subclinical myocardial oedema and fibrosis found to be present before administration of ART. Markers of myocardial oedema on tissue characterization improved on ART in the short term, however, it is unclear if the underlying pathological mechanism is halted, or merely slowed by ART.

Autophagy played a key role in MI through affecting the survival of cardiomyocytes. LncRNA-MHRT (myosin heavy-chain-associated RNA transcripts) was specific to the heart and cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of lncRNA-MHRT transcription under pathological stimuli could cause cardiac hypertrophy and even heart failure (HF). Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new and developing medical technique that utilizes low-intensity ultrasound to locally activate a preloaded sonosensitizer. Our group previously reported that SDT could regulate autophagy. In this study, we investigated whether SDT could reduce MI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activating autophagy pathway. SDT improved cardiac function and suppresses MI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. SDT alleviated MI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by improving autophagy. MHRT mediated the inhibiting effect of SDT on cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activating autophagy pathway. Our data reveal a novel effect that SDT protects against MI and confirm that SDT reduces MI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activating MHRT-mediated-autophagy.

KXS is widely used for the treatment of emotion-thought disease, such as settling fright, quieting the spirit and nourishing the heart. However, whether KXS benefits hippocampal neurons and myocardial cells of mice impaired by paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) and its mechanism remains unclear.\nThis study was aimed to investigate the effect of KXS on hippocampal neuron and cardiac ferroptosis in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep deprived mice and clarify its potential mechanism.\nPSD was induced by a modified multi-platform method. Morris water maze (MWM) was used to detect the ability of learning and memory. Cardiac morphological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Heart rate was detected by a PowerLab multichannel physiological recorder. Serum levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured with biochemical kits. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescent, and Western blotting analysis were used to observe the process and pathway of ferrotosis in hippocampus tissue and heart tissue of PSD mice.\nKXS administration improved the impaired learning and memory of PSD mice. It prevented the damage of mitochondria in the hippocampus and heart of PSD mice. KXS also alleviated the myocardial injury, such as morphological damage, abnormal heart rate, serum ANP, and serum LDH induced by PSD. Further study disclosed that KXS reversed the expressions of proteins involved in ferroptosis such as TFRC, SLC7A11/xCT, GPX-4, ACSL4, and FTH1 in hippocampus and heart tissues.\nKXS improved learning and memory of mice with REM sleep deprivation, which was closely associated with suppressed ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons and myocardiocytes.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2022-12-19", "authors": ["YinCao", "MingruiLi", "LihuaGu", "XinZhao", "AnZhou", "YupingMiao", "YiWu", "ZunjiKe", "RongfengHu", "ZhengtaoWang", "XiaojunWu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2022.116034"}

Our previous studies found that disorders of lipid metabolism were reversed by LGZGD in heart failure (HF) mice. This study aimed to reveal the regulation of lipid metabolism of LGZGD. A mice model of HF was established by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin. The components of LGZGD were identified with the UHPLC-QTOF-MS method. The regulation of lipid metabolism by LGZGD was detected by serum lipidomics and heart tissue proteomics. Molecular docking was further performed to screen active components. A total of 78 compounds in LGZGD were identified. Results of lipidomics showed that 37 lipids illustrated a significant recovery trend to normal after the treatment of LGZGD. Results of proteomics demonstrated that 55 proteins were altered by the administration of LGZGD in HF mice. After enrichment analysis, the Prakg2/Ucp2/Plin1 axis on the Apelin pathway plays a vital role in HF treatment by LGZGD. Nine active components exhibited the outstanding ability of binding to the apelin receptor with MM-GBSA value lower than -60 Kcal/mol.

Thus, we aimed to characterize the biophysical properties of cardiac myosin in IHF. Cardiac tissue was harvested from 10 age-matched males, either with a history of IHF or nonfailing (NF) controls that had no history of structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. Clinical measures before cardiac biopsy demonstrated significant differences in measures of ejection fraction and left ventricular dimensions. Myofibrils and myosin were extracted from left ventricular free wall cardiac samples. There were no changes in myofibrillar ATPase activity or calcium sensitivity between groups. Using isolated myosin, we found a 15% reduction in the IHF group in actin sliding velocity in the in vitro motility assay, which was observed in the absence of a myosin isoform shift. Oxidative damage (carbonylation) of isolated myosin was compared, in which there were no significant differences between groups. Synthetic thick filaments were formed from purified myosin and the ATPase activity was similar in both basal and actin-activated conditions (20 \u00b5M actin). Correlation analysis and Deming linear regression were performed between all studied parameters, in which we found statistically significant correlations between clinical measures of contractility with molecular measures of sliding velocity and ELC carbonylation.

{"title": "Sinapic Acid Attenuated Cisplatin-Induced Cardiotoxicity by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and \u0130nflammation with GPX4-Mediated NF-kB Modulation.", "abstract": "The use of cisplatin is severely limited by the risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Sinapic acid may reduce cisplatin's side effects. The anti oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and peroxynitrite-scavenging properties of sinapic acid could provide protection against the cardiotoxicity caused by cisplatin. To induce toxicity in rats, cisplatin was administered for a period of 5\u00a0weeks. Animal electrocardiograms were obtained after cisplatin toxicity had taken effect. Blood samples and heart tissues were then harvested from the anesthetized animals. The ELISA technique was used to evaluate the level of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative and nitrosative stress indicators in the heart tissue and serum. A real-time PCR was used to analyze GPX4 and NF-\u03baB expression in the heart tissue. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome were also utilized. Electrocardiograms data showed an increase in QRS and QT intervals. Biochemically, cisplatin increased oxidative, nitrosative, and proinflammatory cytokine levels. Animals exposed to cisplatin had histopathological findings in the heart tissue, according to the results of histological assessment. Sinapic acid reduced TNF-alpha, interleukin-6, malondialdehyde, and ischemia-modified albumin. Sinapic acid also reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress. Furthermore, Sinapic acid restored lengthy QT and QRS. Cisplatin-treated rats had higher NF-\u03baB activation than controls. This effect was successfully inhibited by sinapic acid. Histopathologically, tissues treated with sinapic acid were less damaged than tissues treated with cisplatin. In conclusion, our results suggest that sinapic acid exhibited a protective effect against the cardiotoxicity induced by cisplatin. These effects may be caused by the overexpression of GPX4 and the downregulation of NF-KB, as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2022-12-16", "authors": ["CanerYildirim", "SibelCangi", "MustafaOrkmez", "Senay GorucuYilmaz", "Mehmet AkifBozday\u0131", "HaticeYamaner", "SenaCevik"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-022-09773-3\n10.1620/tjem.219.177\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2244\n10.1080/02841860902806609\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.09.085\n10.1016/j.phrs.2005.12.005\n10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154331\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042\n10.1007/s11033-021-06367-0\n10.1155/2016/3571614\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.06.085\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112412\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.014\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.12.022\n10.4103/jpbs.JPBS_220_19\n10.3389/fphar.2020.01119\n10.3389/fphar.2017.00196\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112412\n10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.08.026\n10.1007/s11356-016-7168-1\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2003.11.015\n10.1016/j.tjog.2020.10.004\n10.1042/bj3300719\n10.2337/diab.38.12.1539\n10.1016/0003-2697(87)90021-2\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.18632/oncotarget.25008\n10.1002/jbt.22556\n10.1371/journal.pone.0115682\n10.3390/antiox9111163\n10.1155/2020/3921796\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2009.05.003\n10.1016/j.cbi.2013.11.008\n10.1021/jf020496z\n10.1152/physrev.00029.2006\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705384\n10.1124/jpet.102.047522\n10.1016/j.tox.2016.10.001\n10.1172/JCI200215606\n10.1080/0886022X.2016.1229996\n10.1007/s12272-018-1006-6\n10.1097/MD.0000000000007681\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.11.028\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079426\n10.1074/jbc.M115.680090\n10.1016/S0891-5849(03)00466-0\n10.1038/s41419-019-2061-8\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.006\n10.1002/cbin.11121\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226928"}

{"title": "TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis of the effects of Jiawei Danshen decoction myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Every year, approximately 17 million people worldwide die due to coronary heart disease, with China ranking second in terms of the death toll. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) significantly influences cardiac function and prognosis in cardiac surgery patients. Jiawei Danshen Decoction (JWDSD) is a traditional Chinese herbal prescription that has been used clinically for many years in China to treat MIRI. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain unknown. To investigate the proteomic changes in myocardial tissue of rats given JWDSD for MIRI therapy-based proteomics.\nMIRI rat model was created by ligating/releasing the left anterior descending coronary artery. For seven days, the drugs were administered twice daily. The model was created following the last drug administration. JWDSD's efficacy in improving MIRI was evaluated using biochemical markers and cardiac histology. Tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics (TMT) technology was also used to detect proteins in the extracted heart tissue. To analyze differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), bioinformatics analysis, including gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways, were employed. Furthermore, western blotting confirmed the potential targets regulated by JWDSD.\nThe histopathologic characteristics and biochemical data showed JWDSD's protective effects on MIRI rats. A total of 4549 proteins were identified with FDR (false discovery rate) \u22641%. Twenty overlapping were identified (162 DEPs and 45 DEPs in Model/Control or JWDSD/Model group, respectively). Of these DEPs, 16 were regulated by JWDSD. GO analysis provided a summary of the deregulated protein expression in the categories of biological process (BP), cell component (CC), and molecular function (MF). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the signaling pathways of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, RNA polymerase, serotonergic synapse, and linoleic acid metabolism are all closely related to JWDSD effects in MIRI rats. Furthermore, T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1) was validated using western blotting, and the results were consistent with proteomics data.\nOur study suggests that JWDSD may exert therapeutic effects through multi-pathways regulation in MIRI treatment.

{"title": "An efficient combination immunotherapy for antitumor immunity without accelerating cardiac allograft rejection.", "abstract": "Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including antibodies against programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its receptor programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), represents a promising systematic treatment for advanced human malignancies. Transplantation remains the ultimate therapy for end-stage organ diseases. However, the efficacy of ICI treatment in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients remains controversial. We established a transgenic primary liver cancer mouse model and performed allogeneic heterotopic heart transplantation. Different treatments were performed and survival curves were calculated. Graft samples were collected, and immune cells and the cell surface expression of PD-L1 were analysed by flow cytometry. Inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum were measured by an inflammatory array. The specificity of the histochemical techniques was tested by staining sections. A combination immunotherapy comprising a BET protein inhibitor (JQ1) and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 antibody) was administered to primary liver cancer model mice bearing cardiac allografts. Interestingly, the combination immunotherapy effectively suppressed the progression of primary liver cancer but did not accelerate allograft rejection. In accordance with our previous findings, BET protein inhibition enhances the expression of a putative membrane transporter (Rab8A), which upregulates the expression of PD-L1 on the plasma membrane in a transgenic primary liver cancer mouse model. This may be a crucial mechanism of tumour progression arrest. Our data showed that heart transplantation upregulated the expression of the proinflammatory factor IFN-\u03b3 and suggested that BET protein inhibition (with JQ1) decreased PD-L1 expression in heart tissues after cardiac transplantation. This phenomenon was accompanied by enhanced infiltration of inflammatory IFN-\u03b3.

{"title": "Stem cell laden nano and micro collagen/PLGA bimodal fibrous patches for myocardial regeneration.", "abstract": "Although the use of cardiac patches is still controversial, cardiac patch has the significance in the field of the tissue engineered cardiac regeneration because it overcomes several shortcomings of intra-myocardial injection by providing a template for cells to form a cohesive sheet. So far, fibrous scaffolds fabricated using electrospinning technique have been increasingly explored for preparation of cardiac patches. One of the problems with the use of electrospinning is that nanofibrous structures hardly allow the infiltration of cells for development of 3D tissue construct. In this respect, we have prepared novel bi-modal electrospun scaffolds as a feasible strategy to address the challenges in cardiac tissue engineering\u2009.\nNano/micro bimodal composite fibrous patch composed of collagen and poly (D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (Col/PLGA) was fabricated using an independent nozzle control multi-electrospinning apparatus, and its feasibility as the stem cell laden cardiac patch was systemically investigated.\nNano/micro bimodal distributions of Col/PLGA patches without beaded fibers were obtained in the range of the 4-6% collagen concentration. The poor mechanical properties of collagen and the hydrophobic property of PLGA were improved by co-electrospinning. In vitro experiments using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) revealed that Col/PLGA showed improved cyto-compatibility and proliferation capacity compared to PLGA, and their extent increased with increase in collagen content. The results of tracing nanoparticle-labeled as well as GFP transfected BMSCs strongly support that Col/PLGA possesses the long-term stem cells retention capability, thereby allowing stem cells to directly function as myocardial and vascular endothelial cells or to secrete the recovery factors, which in turn leads to improved heart function proved by histological and echocardiographic findings.\nCol/PLGA bimodal cardiac patch could significantly attenuate cardiac remodeling and fully recover the cardiac function, as a consequence of their potent long term stem cell engraftment capability.", "journal": "Biomaterials research", "date": "2022-12-14", "authors": ["Jung HeeWee", "Ki-DongYoo", "Sung BoSim", "Hyun JooKim", "Han JoonKim", "Kyu NamPark", "Gee-HeeKim", "Mi HyoungMoon", "Su JungYou", "Mi YeonHa", "Dae HyeokYang", "Heung JaeChun", "Jae HoonKo", "Chun HoKim"], "doi": "10.1186/s40824-022-00319-w\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32279-7\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303595\n10.1001/archinte.167.10.989\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.05.009\n10.1161/01.RES.0000155333.69009.63\n10.1038/clpt.2008.295\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn017\n10.1080/15583724.2010.537800\n10.1039/D0BM00588F\n10.3390/ma3031863\n10.1002/term.1944\n10.1016/j.matdes.2021.110049\n10.1007/s40005-019-00439-x\n10.1016/j.jiec.2018.06.010\n10.1039/C9BM00101H\n10.3390/polym8020042\n10.22203/eCM.v031a06\n10.1186/s40824-021-00242-6\n10.1016/j.jiec.2020.01.001\n10.1038/nm1105\n10.1016/j.legalmed.2021.101997\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223172\n10.1111/bcpt.13398\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131446\n10.1038/s41536-021-00140-4\n10.1002/adfm.201502142\n10.3390/ijms19030745\n10.1016/j.nantod.2021.101196\n10.1049/iet-nbt.2011.0028\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.006\n10.1074/jbc.M412921200\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00419\n10.1021/acsami.2c07326\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120594\n10.1186/s40824-021-00239-1\n10.1002/adhm.201700556\n10.1186/s40824-022-00260-y\n10.1186/s40824-021-00240-8"}

We present an unusual case of a middle-aged woman with primary adrenal insufficiency who presented paradoxically with TCM.\nA 50-year-old woman with past history of hypothyroidism presented to emergency department with history of acute chest pain and syncope.

Steroid hormones not only potentiate the actions of catecholamines, but they also regulate and channelize catecholaminergic actions preventing their deleterious effects on the cardiac tissue.

{"title": "A smart adhesive Janus hydrogel for non-invasive cardiac repair and tissue adhesion prevention.", "abstract": "Multifunctional hydrogel with asymmetric and reversible adhesion characteristics is essential to handle the obstructions towards bioapplications of trauma removal and postoperative tissue synechia. Herein, we developed a responsively reversible and asymmetrically adhesive Janus hydrogel that enables on-demand stimuli-triggered detachment for efficient myocardial infarction (MI) repair, and synchronously prevents tissue synechia and inflammatory intrusion after surgery. In contrast with most irreversibly and hard-to-removable adhesives, this Janus hydrogel exhibited a reversible adhesion capability and can be noninvasively detached on-demand just by slight biologics. It is interesting that the adhesion behaves exhibited a molecularly encoded adhesion-adaptive stiffening feature similar to the self-protective stress-strain effect of biological tissues. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Janus hydrogel can promote the maturation and functions of cardiomyocytes, and facilitate MI repair by reducing oxidative damage and inflammatory response, reconstructing electrical conduction and blood supply in infarcted area. Furthermore, no secondary injury and tissue synechia were triggered after transplantation of Janus hydrogel.

All training protocols were carried out for 4 weeks, 3 times/week. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the gastrocnemius muscle cells and the areas of the cardiomyocytes were measured.\nIn the fast-twitch fibers, there was an increase in CSA in the RTW and RTC groups compared to the ATW (p<0.01 and p<0.01) and ATT groups (p<0.01 and p<0.01). In the slow-twitch fibers, the ATW and ATT groups demonstrated a lower CSA compared to the RTW (p=0.03 and p<0.00) and RTC groups (p<0.01 and p<0.01).

{"title": "SNP and DNA methylation analyses of a monozygotic twins discordant for complete endocardial cushion defect: a case report.", "abstract": "The exact cause of complete endocardial cushion defect (ECD) is still unknown. This report describes a unique pair of monozygotic twins (MZ twins) discordant for ECD. The chromosome karyotyping analysis revealed normal karyotype of 46, XY, 16qh+ and mat in both MZ twins. A genome-wide analysis of DNA using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 revealed identical genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs). An extensive methylation assay was carried out by NimbleGen 3 \u00d7 720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays to analyze the potential epigenetic differences. The DNA methylation profiles of the affected twin seemed increased compared with that of the unaffected twin. However, further validation of Notch1 promoter hypermethylation and six top-ranked differentially methylated CpG sites by sodium bisulfate modification and methylation-specific PCR, failed to reveal consistent methylation differences between the twins. Other relevant factors, such as heritability and penetrance of the condition that place the MZ twins near to a threshold for ECD or variations in local epigenetic events in the twins' heart tissues, are probably responsible for the phenotypic discordance.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2022-12-13", "authors": ["BihuiBao", "HuaHu", "LimeiChen", "ShiyongLu", "QifengTang", "ZhiqingLiang"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Persistent viral infections and their role in heart disease.", "abstract": "Viral infections are the culprit of many diseases, including inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis. Acute myocarditis cases have been described in scientific literature, and viruses, such as parvovirus B19, coxsackievirus B3, or more recently, SARS-CoV-2, were the direct cause of cardiac inflammation. If not treated, myocarditis could progress to dilated cardiomyopathy, which permanently impairs the heart and limits a person's lifespan. Accumulated evidence suggests that certain viruses may persist in cardiac tissue after the initial infection, which could open up the door to reactivation under favorable conditions. Whether this chronic infection contributes to, or initiates, cardiac damage over time, remains a pressing issue in the field of virus-induced heart pathology, and it is directly tied to patients' treatment. Previously, large case studies found that a few viruses: parvovirus B19, coxsackievirus, adenovirus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, are most commonly found in human endomyocardial biopsy samples derived from patients experiencing cardiac inflammation, or dilated cardiomyopathy. SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been shown to have cardiovascular consequences. This review examines the role of viral persistence in cardiac inflammation and heart disease, and discusses its implications for patients' outcomes.", "journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "date": "2022-12-13", "authors": ["AshwinBadrinath", "SagarBhatta", "AnnaKloc"], "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2022.1030440\n10.1038/s41577-020-0346-x\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa092\n10.1155/2012/180871\n10.1093/cid/ciw802\n10.1155/2018/3625139\n10.1177/0267659115618460\n10.1371/journal.pone.0176311\n10.1101/2020.11.04.364315\n10.1371/journal.pone.0054008\n10.1016/j.drudis.2020.06.021\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035966\n10.3201/eid2208.160186\n10.1203/00006450-199704001-00118\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00648-X\n10.1016/j.ajog.2005.01.022\n10.5152/akd.2014.5731\n10.24953/turkjped.2020.3664\n10.1016/j.virol.2008.02.030\n10.1038/s41598-021-90351-y\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000148823.08092.0E\n10.3390/ijms22147722\n10.1016/j.ijid.2021.10.046\n10.1056/NEJMra0800028\n10.1038/s41591-020-1051-9\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn296\n10.1128/CVI.00281-12\n10.15420/cfr.2020.33\n10.1002/jmv.26549\n10.1128/JVI.00891-08\n10.1016/j.jcv.2018.03.001\n10.1016/j.idcr.2021.e01187\n10.3390/v14020299\n10.1016/j.jcv.2014.11.026\n10.5935/abc.20190187\n10.1172/jci.insight.148980\n10.26502/acmcr.96550342\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.049465\n10.2169/internalmedicine.39.632\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2578\n10.1136/bmj.2.5163.1379\n10.1016/j.medcle.2020.06.010\n10.1111/j.1462-5822.2012.01774.x\n10.1089/vbz.2015.1769\n10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107300\n10.1038/s41374-021-00669-4\n10.1007/s12471-013-0499-3\n10.1128/jvi.69.11.6720-6728.1995\n10.1093/eurheartj/12.suppl_D.134\n10.1128/mBio.01119-14\n10.1007/s00705-018-3942-3\n10.1099/0022-1317-74-7-1381\n10.1007/s00414-005-0540-1\n10.1136/bcr-2013-010410\n10.1155/2022/1639990\n10.1016/j.carpath.2022.107447\n10.1016/j.jcv.2012.10.005\n10.1055/s-2004-831863\n10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205822\n10.1128/JVI.79.11.7024-7041.2005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.769489\n10.1007/s00508-010-1456-4\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000155616.07901.35\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.548156\n10.1186/s12872-022-02534-8\n10.1097/01.inf.0000132280.36984.a9\n10.1016/j.jcv.2011.06.017\n10.1097/MD.0000000000004051\n10.1186/s40249-020-00662-x\n10.3389/fcimb.2021.701278\n10.1177/000331978503600208\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.606509\n10.1161/01.CIR.90.1.330\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.09.136\n10.1161/01.RES.0000156077.54903.67\n10.1155/2018/4258296\n10.1155/2017/7074508\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1001311\n10.1016/j.hrtlng.2009.12.012\n10.1097/COH.0000000000000416\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.115.004430\n10.1007/s00428-004-1173-3\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.11.032\n10.1007/s10741-012-9357-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.307708\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.10.1348\n10.1038/s41423-021-00728-2\n10.1038/s41598-020-78597-4\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.108\n10.1155/2015/458056\n10.3389/fmicb.2021.698169\n10.1007/s12288-011-0112-0\n10.4103/apc.APC_54_17\n10.1007/s15010-012-0321-y\n10.1155/2018/8026314\n10.1007/s00134-020-06028-z\n10.1086/513874\n10.1016/j.idcr.2018.02.008\n10.1128/JCM.01672-08\n10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06807-6\n10.1080/14779072.2021.1844005\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.10.064\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.001\n10.1128/JVI.01308-15\n10.1111/j.1651-2227.1989.tb10905.x\n10.1128/JCM.00815-09\n10.1038/s41569-020-00435-x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000155615.68924.B3\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313578\n10.1155/2012/351979\n10.1080/AC.67.2.2154221\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.821162\n10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2017.8170\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103230\n10.1016/j.carpath.2004.07.002\n10.1099/jmmcr.0.005139\n10.1128/JCM.00270-13\n10.1038/s41591-022-01689-3\n10.2217/fmb.11.40\n10.1186/s12872-018-0869-2\n10.7150/ijbs.45134\n10.1136/hrt.2007.131383\n10.1136/jcp.54.10.792\n10.1016/0140-6736(90)92486-2"}
{"title": "Experimental heart failure models in small animals.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the most critical health and economic burdens worldwide, and its prevalence is continuously increasing. HF is a disease that occurs due to a pathological change arising from the function or structure of the heart tissue and usually progresses. Numerous experimental HF models have been created to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that cause HF. An understanding of the pathophysiology of HF is essential for the development of novel efficient therapies. During the past few decades, animal models have provided new insights into the complex pathogenesis of HF. Success in the pathophysiology and treatment of HF has been achieved by using animal models of HF. The development of new in vivo models is critical for evaluating treatments such as gene therapy, mechanical devices, and new surgical approaches. However, each animal model has advantages and limitations, and none of these models is suitable for studying all aspects of HF. Therefore, the researchers have to choose an appropriate experimental model that will fully reflect HF. Despite some limitations, these animal models provided a significant advance in the etiology and pathogenesis of HF. Also, experimental HF models have led to the development of new treatments.

{"title": "Cardioprotective Effects of 6-Gingerol against Alcohol-Induced ROS-Mediated Tissue Injury and Apoptosis in Rats.", "abstract": "The present study investigated the cardioprotective properties of 6-gingerol against alcohol-induced ROS-mediated cardiac tissue damage in rats. Experiments were conducted on 4 groups of rats, orally treated with control, 6-gingerol (10 mg/kg body weight), alcohol (6 g/kg body weight) and combination of 6-gingerol plus alcohol for two-month. In the results, we found 6-ginger treatment to alcohol-fed rats substantially suppressed ROS production in cardiac tissue. Alcohol-induced elevated 8-OHDG and protein carbonyls which represent oxidative modification of DNA and proteins were completely reversed by 6-gingerol. This was further endorsed by restored superoxide dismutase and catalase activities with 6-gingerol against alcohol-induced loss. The elevated cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB, cTn-T, cTn-I) and dyslipidemia in alcohol-intoxicated rats was significantly reversed by 6-gingerol. Furthermore, alcohol-induced apoptosis characterized by overexpression of cytochrome C, caspase-8 and caspase-9 was diminished with 6-gingerol treatment. Transmission electron microscope images conferred the cardioprotective properties of 6-gingerol as we have seen less structural derangements in mitochondria and reappearance of myofilaments. Our findings conclude that 6-ginger effectively protect alcohol-induced ROS-mediated cardiac tissue damage, which may be due to its potent antioxidant efficacy. Therefore, 6-gingerol could be a potential therapeutic molecule that can be used in the treatment of alcohol-induced myocardial injury.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-12-12", "authors": ["Venkata SubbaiahGanjikunta", "Ramana ReddyMaddula", "ShanmugamBhasha", "RaviSahukari", "ShanmugamKondeti Ramudu", "VenkatrayuluChenji", "Sathyavelu ReddyKesireddy", "ZheZheng", "MallikarjunaKorivi"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules27238606\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.03.060\n10.2310/6650.2005.53506\n10.1016/j.alcohol.2010.07.004\n10.1007/s11883-008-0017-z\n10.1016/j.biocel.2017.06.009\n10.1016/j.jep.2021.114140\n10.1016/j.jfda.2013.08.001\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2015.06.013\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.12.012\n10.1177/1934578X1400900736\n10.1007/s10616-008-9121-8\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.09.073\n10.1007/s00280-012-1975-y\n10.1002/mnfr.202000003\n10.1096/fj.07-9574LSF\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2934\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.12.006\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.05.005\n10.1007/BF02255972\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2011.11.001\n10.1155/2021/6661937\n10.1128/AAC.02431-13\n10.4103/pm.pm_387_17\n10.3389/fphar.2022.868393\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117958\n10.1152/ajpheart.00554.2015\n10.1177/0960327116681650\n10.1016/j.phrs.2017.01.026\n10.1007/s12272-012-0119-6\n10.1186/s12944-019-1171-8\n10.1002/jsfa.6642\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa953\n10.14740/jmc1895w\n10.1080/21691401.2019.1610415\n10.1155/2018/6209679\n10.1097/01.ALC.0000163493.45344.7A\n10.1074/jbc.M604298200\n10.1196/annals.1427.015\n10.1038/cdd.2009.59\n10.1016/S0024-3205(00)00759-1\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.10.015\n10.1016/S0024-3205(01)01551-X\n10.1016/j.crfs.2019.09.001\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb16965.x\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)45228-9\n10.5858/arpa.2014-0056-RA\n10.1679/aohc.46.173"}
{"title": "Farnesol Protects against Cardiotoxicity Caused by Doxorubicin-Induced Stress, Inflammation, and Cell Death: An In Vivo Study in Wistar Rats.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOXO) is an antineoplastic drug that is used extensively in managing multiple cancer types. However, DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity is a limiting factor for its widespread use and considerably affects patients' quality of life.

{"title": "Advances in Cellular Reprogramming-Based Approaches for Heart Regenerative Repair.", "abstract": "Continuous loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs) is one of the fundamental characteristics of many heart diseases, which eventually can lead to heart failure. Due to the limited proliferation ability of human adult CMs, treatment efficacy has been limited in terms of fully repairing damaged hearts. It has been shown that cell lineage conversion can be achieved by using cell reprogramming approaches, including human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), providing a promising therapeutic for regenerative heart medicine. Recent studies using advanced cellular reprogramming-based techniques have also contributed some new strategies for regenerative heart repair. In this review, hiPSC-derived cell therapeutic methods are introduced, and the clinical setting challenges (maturation, engraftment, immune response, scalability, and tumorigenicity), with potential solutions, are discussed. Inspired by the iPSC reprogramming, the approaches of direct cell lineage conversion are merging, such as induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) and induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs) derived from fibroblasts, without induction of pluripotency. The studies of cellular and molecular pathways also reveal that epigenetic resetting is the essential mechanism of reprogramming and lineage conversion. Therefore, CRISPR techniques that can be repurposed for genomic or epigenetic editing become attractive approaches for cellular reprogramming. In addition, viral and non-viral delivery strategies that are utilized to achieve CM reprogramming will be introduced, and the therapeutic effects of iCMs or iCPCs on myocardial infarction will be compared. After the improvement of reprogramming efficiency by developing new techniques, reprogrammed iCPCs or iCMs will provide an alternative to hiPSC-based approaches for regenerative heart therapies, heart disease modeling, and new drug screening.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2022-12-12", "authors": ["XingyuHe", "JialiangLiang", "ChristianPaul", "WeiHuang", "SuchandrimaDutta", "YigangWang"], "doi": "10.3390/cells11233914\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1242/bio.20133830\n10.1172/JCI17664\n10.1038/cddis.2011.130\n10.1186/s13578-020-00480-6\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000000446\n10.1017/S1462399409001124\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227512\n10.1038/nature09005\n10.1038/nm.4238\n10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.09.003\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2016.09.041\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.04.056\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.05.001\n10.1038/nprot.2008.42\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016734\n10.1038/s41598-018-24954-3\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.273144\n10.1002/stem.3027\n10.1172/jci.insight.99941\n10.15252/emmm.201404757\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.751412\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e74a14\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.08.012\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.07.004\n10.1089/ars.2016.6766\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044205\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.01.033\n10.3389/fmolb.2020.00014\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112875\n10.1002/adfm.201908612\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306985\n10.3390/ani10091561\n10.2174/1566523216666160119094143\n10.1093/stcltm/szac061\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.015231\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aax2992\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.03.003\n10.1038/srep06716\n10.1016/j.nano.2021.102367\n10.7150/thno.56757\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.01.034\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.01.012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0165748\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1186/s41232-020-00132-9\n10.1038/mt.2013.59\n10.1073/pnas.1902566116\n10.1186/s41232-020-00145-4\n10.1038/s41598-020-58126-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019012\n10.1038/s41598-019-55620-x\n10.3390/cells8091095\n10.1038/s41598-018-38325-5\n10.1038/nm.3267\n10.5732/cjc.012.10065\n10.1126/sciadv.aay7629\n10.1172/jci.insight.142000\n10.1002/sctm.16-0484\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.053563\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316958\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269035\n10.3390/cells8070679\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.12.001\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.118.005425\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304510\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.11.010\n10.1021/acsomega.8b00904\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024692\n10.1002/stem.248\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011373\n10.1089/cell.2010.0027\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300556\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002\n10.1016/j.xpro.2019.100010\n10.1016/j.molmed.2019.06.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.320496\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.08.104\n10.2147/IJN.S75124\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121028\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.034\n10.1038/cr.2015.99\n10.1126/science.aaf1502\n10.1038/s41598-020-63992-8\n10.1186/s13287-017-0569-3\n10.1038/s41422-018-0036-4\n10.1038/ncomms9243\n10.3390/cells10071572\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.07.063\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.09.010\n10.1126/sciadv.abj6621\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308679\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.02.001\n10.1073/pnas.1120299109\n10.1016/j.apsb.2019.09.003\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2021.10.015\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0136\n10.1038/s41551-022-00865-7\n10.1038/nrm3543\n10.1038/labinvest.2017.56\n10.3390/cells10112888\n10.1038/s41580-021-00335-z\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.08.004\n10.1073/pnas.1016959108\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.271148\n10.2147/IJN.S304873\n10.1007/s12265-009-9123-8\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.87\n10.1136/hrt.2008.155077\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.131581\n10.1021/acsnano.1c00628\n10.1007/s12928-020-00669-z\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.110037\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aan6205"}

Minocycline (Min) is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. Here, the cardioprotective effects of Min against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity in adult male rats were evaluated.\nForty-two adult male rats were divided into six groups including control group (normal saline), Dox group, Min groups (Min 45\u00a0mg/kg and Min 90\u00a0mg/kg), and treatment groups (Dox\u00a0+\u00a0Min 45\u00a0mg/kg and Dox\u00a0+\u00a0Min 90\u00a0mg/kg). Dox (2.5\u00a0mg/kg) was administered three times a week for two weeks, and Min once a day for three weeks via intraperitoneal route. Cardiac tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) in serum as well as the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in cardiac tissue were measured. Cardiac tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 were also measured using ELISA.\nCompared with the Dox group, treatment with Min significantly decreased the activity of LDH and CK-MB. Min also increased the activity of catalase and SOD in the tissue samples. The results showed that the levels of MDA, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in cardiac tissue samples were significantly lower in the Min groups compared with the Dox group.

{"title": "Metabolomic and transcriptomic studies of improvements in myocardial infarction due to Pycr1 deletion.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major challenge to cardiovascular health worldwide, with poor healing leaving a direct impact on patients' quality of life and survival. Metabolic abnormalities after MI are receiving increasing attention. Our previous studies showed that enhancing proline catabolism ameliorates hypoxic damage to myocardial cells; therefore, we sought to determine whether reducing the synthesis of endogenous proline also affects MI. We analysed GEO datasets associated with MI and western blot of mouse heart tissue in an MI model to demonstrate pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (Pycr1) expression level after MI. We constructed Pycr1 KO mice by CRISPR/Cas9 technology to explore the effect of Pycr1 gene KO after MI using transcriptomic and metabolomic techniques. In this study, we found reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of Pycr1 in the hearts of mice after MI. We observed that Pycr1 gene KO has a protective effect against MI, reducing the area of MI and improving heart function. Using transcriptomics approaches, we found 215 upregulated genes and 247 downregulated genes after KO of the Pycr1 gene, indicating that unsaturated fatty acid metabolism was affected at the transcriptional level. Metabolomics results revealed elevated content for 141 metabolites and decreased content for 90 metabolites, among which the levels of fatty acids, glycerol phospholipids, bile acids, and other metabolites increased significantly. The changes in these metabolites may be related to the protective effect of Pycr1 KO on the heart after MI. Pycr1 gene KO has a protective effect against MI and our research will lay a solid foundation for the development of future Pycr1-related drug targets.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2022-12-11", "authors": ["ZhiminXue", "YiwenPan", "XugangKong", "JiefangZhang", "DanyuWu", "BinquanZhou"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.17637"}

Although several pharmacological interventions, including melatonin and metformin, have been reported to protect against various cardiovascular diseases, their potential roles in trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity remain elusive. We hypothesized that either melatonin or metformin co-treatment effectively attenuates trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity through attenuating the impaired mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dynamics. Male Wistar rats were divided into control (normal saline, n\u00a0=\u00a08) and trastuzumab group (4\u00a0mg/kg/day for 7\u00a0days, n\u00a0=\u00a024).

Cardiac parameters were determined, and biochemical investigations were carried out on blood and heart tissues. Trastuzumab induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction by increasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. It also impaired cardiac mitochondrial function, dynamics, and autophagy. Treatment with either melatonin or metformin equally attenuated trastuzumab-induced cardiac injury, indicated by a marked reduction in inflammation, oxidative damage, cardiac mitochondrial injury, mitochondrial dynamic imbalance, autophagy dysregulation, and apoptosis, leading to improved LV function, as demonstrated by increased LV ejection fraction.

Children referring to three Italian tertiary pediatric centers between February 2020 and November 2021 with a diagnosis of MIS-C, who underwent CMR during a follow-up visit, were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected. Twenty MIS-C patients (aged 9-17, median 12\u00a0years) were included in the study. Heart involvement at onset was testified by hypotension/shock (55%), laboratory evidence of myocardial involvement (100%), reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiography (83%), and/or need for inotrope agents (40%); they all presented good clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic response to treatment. CMR was performed after a median interval of 3\u00a0months from discharge. Pericardial effusion and myocardial edema were found in 5% of patients. Mild residual left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was found in 20% of patients, all showing normal echocardiographic LVEF at discharge.

{"title": "Placental Inflammation Leads to Abnormal Embryonic Heart Development.", "abstract": "Placental heart development and embryonic heart development occur in parallel, and these organs have been proposed to exert reciprocal regulation during gestation. Poor placentation has been associated with congenital heart disease, an important cause of infant mortality. However, the mechanisms by which altered placental development can lead to congenital heart disease remain unresolved.\nIn this study, we use an in vivo neutrophil-driven placental inflammation model through antibody depletion of maternal circulating neutrophils at key stages during time-mated murine pregnancy: embryonic days 4.5 and 7.5. Pregnant mice were culled at embryonic day 14.5 to assess placental and embryonic heart development. A combination of flow cytometry, histology, and bulk RNA sequencing was used to assess placental immune cell composition and tissue architecture. We also used flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing to assess embryonic cardiac immune cells at embryonic day 14.5 and histology and gene analyses to investigate embryonic heart structure and development. In some cases, offspring were culled at postnatal days 5 and 28 to assess any postnatal cardiac changes in immune cells, structure, and cardiac function, as measured by echocardiography.\nIn the present study, we show that neutrophil-driven placental inflammation leads to inadequate placental development and loss of barrier function. Consequently, placental inflammatory monocytes of maternal origin become capable of migration to the embryonic heart and alter the normal composition of resident cardiac macrophages and cardiac tissue structure. This cardiac impairment continues into postnatal life, hindering normal tissue architecture and function. Last, we show that tempering placental inflammation can prevent this fetal cardiac defect and is sufficient to promote normal cardiac function in postnatal life.\nTaken together, these observations provide a mechanistic paradigm whereby neutrophil-driven inflammation in pregnancy can preclude normal embryonic heart development as a direct consequence of poor placental development, which has major implications on cardiac function into adult life.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2022-12-10", "authors": ["Eleanor JWard", "SerenaBert", "SilviaFanti", "Kerri MMalone", "Robert TMaughan", "ChristinaGkantsinikoudi", "FabricePrin", "Lia KarinaVolpato", "Anna PaulaPiovezan", "Gerard JGraham", "Neil PDufton", "MauroPerretti", "Federica MMarelli-Berg", "SuchitaNadkarni"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061934"}
{"title": "Protective effect of adenosine triphosphate and benidipine separately or together against cardiotoxicity caused by bevacizumab.", "abstract": "Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody whose adverse effects include cardiotoxicity. We investigated whether using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or benidipine either separately or together protects against cardiac damage induced by bevacizumab in rats. Forty Wistar albino male rats were allocated to five groups of eight: bevacizumab (Bv), ATP\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (ABv), benidipine\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (BBv), ATP\u2009+\u2009benidipine\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (ABBv) and untreated controls. Rats in the ABv group were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2\u2009mg/kg ATP. The BBv group was given 4 mg/kg benidipine by oral gavage. The ABBv group was injected i.p. with 2\u2009mg/kg ATP and simultaneously administered 4\u2009mg/kg benidipine orally. One hour after administration of ATP, benidipine or normal saline, the Bv, ABv, BBv and ABBv groups were injected i.p. with 10\u2009mg/kg bevacizumab. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and total glutathione (tGSH) levels were measured in cardiac tissue, and troponin I (TP I) and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) levels were measured in blood samples. Tissue samples were examined for histopathology. We found the lowest TP I, CK-MB and MDA levels and the highest tGSH level in the ABBv group; these results were similar to the control group. Nuclei of cardiomyocytes in the BV group were misshapen and shrunken, and myofibers were disrupted; we also observed eosinophilic degeneration and interstitial edema. Blood capillaries were dilated and congested. We observed amelioration of these findings in the ABBv group. We found that ATP and benidipine alone or in combination reduced cardiac damage associated with the use of bevacizumab.

{"title": "Exploring the cardiac ECM during fibrosis: A new era with next-gen proteomics.", "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in maintaining elasticity in cardiac tissues. Elasticity is required in the heart for properly pumping blood to the whole body. Dysregulated ECM remodeling causes fibrosis in the cardiac tissues. Cardiac fibrosis leads to stiffness in the heart tissues, resulting in heart failure. During cardiac fibrosis, ECM proteins get excessively deposited in the cardiac tissues. In the ECM, cardiac fibroblast proliferates into myofibroblast upon various kinds of stimulations. Fibroblast activation (myofibroblast) contributes majorly toward cardiac fibrosis. Other than cardiac fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, epithelial/endothelial cells, and immune system cells can also contribute to cardiac fibrosis. Alteration in the expression of the ECM core and ECM-modifier proteins causes different types of cardiac fibrosis. These different components of ECM culminated into different pathways inducing transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblast into myofibroblast. In this review, we summarize the role of different ECM components during cardiac fibrosis progression leading to heart failure. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of applying mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to understand the key changes occurring in the ECM during fibrotic progression. Next-gen proteomics studies will broaden the potential to identify key targets to combat cardiac fibrosis in order to achieve precise medicine-development in the future.", "journal": "Frontiers in

Yet, the impact of an oxygen gradient on cardiac tissue function is poorly understood, largely due to limitations of existing experimental models. Here, we engineered a microphysiological system to controllably expose engineered cardiac tissue to an oxygen gradient that mimics the border zone and measured the effects of the gradient on electromechanical function and the transcriptome. The gradient delayed calcium release, reuptake, and propagation; decreased diastolic and peak systolic stress; and increased expression of inflammatory cascades that are hallmarks of myocardial infarction. These changes were distinct from those observed in tissues exposed to uniform normoxia or hypoxia, demonstrating distinct regulation of cardiac tissue phenotypes by an oxygen gradient.

{"title": "Enterovirus-Cardiomyocyte Interactions: Impact of Terminally Deleted Genomic RNAs on Viral and Host Functions.", "abstract": "Group B enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), can persistently infect cardiac tissue and cause dilated cardiomyopathy. Persistence is linked to 5' terminal deletions of viral genomic RNAs that have been detected together with minor populations of full-length genomes in human infections. In this study, we explored the functions and interactions of the different viral RNA forms found in persistently infected patients and their putative role(s) in pathogenesis. Since enterovirus cardiac pathogenesis is linked to the viral proteinase 2A, we investigated the effect of different terminal genomic RNA deletions on 2A activity. We discovered that 5' terminal deletions in CVB3 genomic RNAs decreased the levels of 2A proteinase activity but could not abrogate it. Using newly generated viral reporters encoding nano-luciferase, we found that 5' terminal deletions resulted in decreased levels of viral protein and RNA synthesis in singly transfected cardiomyocyte cultures. Unexpectedly, when full-length and terminally deleted forms were cotransfected into cardiomyocytes, a cooperative interaction was observed, leading to increased viral RNA and protein production. However, when viral infections were carried out in cells harboring 5' terminally deleted CVB3 RNAs, a decrease in infectious particle production was observed. Our results provide a possible explanation for the necessity of full-length viral genomes during persistent infection, as they would stimulate efficient viral replication compared to that of the deleted genomes alone. To avoid high levels of viral particle production that would trigger cellular immune activation and host cell death, the terminally deleted RNA forms act to limit the production of viral particles, possibly as ", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2022-12-09", "authors": ["AlexisBouin", "Michelle NVu", "AliAl-Hakeem", "Genevieve PTran", "Joseph H CNguyen", "Bert LSemler"], "doi": "10.1128/jvi.01426-22\n10.1016/j.meegid.2012.10.016\n10.1099/jgv.0.000911\n10.1016/0300-9084(88)90166-6\n10.1038/291547a0\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004825\n10.3390/jcm10040603\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.108\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn296\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035966\n10.1161/01.cir.101.3.231\n10.1128/JCM.00820-13\n10.1128/JVI.79.11.7024-7041.2005\n10.1016/j.virol.2008.02.030\n10.1016/j.virol.2016.05.021\n10.1128/JVI.01774-07\n10.1038/6543\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.631093\n10.1016/0092-8674(90)90170-J\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.766022\n10.1073/pnas.89.1.314\n10.1172/JCI1972\n10.1128/JVI.00423-17\n10.1038/s41598-020-67648-5\n10.1017/s1355838201010044\n10.1128/JVI.01513-07\n10.1007/s40588-020-00138-4\n10.1016/S0065-3527(08)60279-1\n10.1038/s41467-019-11428-x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.06.026\n10.1128/JVI.01049-13"}
{"title": "[Effect and mechanism of Huangqi Shengmai Decoction in treatment of joint rat model of fatigue and myocardial injury].", "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effects and the underlying mechanism of Huangqi Shengmai Decoction(HQSMD) in the treatment of fatigue and myocardial injury in a joint rat model. Wistar rats were assigned into 4 groups: sham, model, diltiazem hydrochloride(positive control), and HQSMD. The joint model of fatigue and myocardial injury was established by 14-day exhausted swimming followed by high ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The rats in the sham group underwent a sham operation without coronary artery ligation or swimming. Since the fourth day after the ligation, swimming was continued in the model group and the drug-treated groups for the following 4 weeks. Meanwhile, the rats in the positive control group and the HQSMD group were respectively administrated intragastrically with diltiazem hydrochloride(20 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)\u00b7d~(-1)) and HQSMD(0.95 g\u00b7kg~(-1)\u00b7d~(-1)) for 4 weeks, while the shams and the models were given the same volume of normal saline. The left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF), left ventricular fractional shortening(LVFS), grip strength, and myocardial pathophysiological changes were measured to evaluate the anti-fatigue and cardioprotective effects of HQSMD. The protein levels of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1(PINK1) and parkin in the myocardium were measured by Western blot to preliminarily elucidate the mechanism of HQSMD in ameliorating myocardial injury by suppressing mitochondrial autophagy. Compared with the shams, the models showed weakened heart function(LVEF and LVFS, P&lt;0.01), decreased grasping ability(P&lt;0.05), elevated blood urea nitrogen(BUN) and aldosterone(ALD) levels(P&lt;0.01), aggravated myocardial fibrosis and connective tissue hyperplasia(P&lt;0.01), and up-regulated protein levels of PINK1(P&lt;0.01) and parkin(P&lt;0.05). Four-week treatment with HQSMD increased the LVEF and LVFS levels(P&lt;0.01), enhanced the grip strength(P&lt;0.01), reduced the serum levels of BUN(P&lt;0.01) and ALD(P&lt;0.05), alleviated the pathological injury and fibrosis in the myocardium(P&lt;0.01), and down-regulated the protein levels of PINK1(P&lt;0.01) and parkin(P&lt;0.05) in heart tissue. The results demonstrate that HQSMD may alleviate myocardial fibrosis and protect myocardium by suppressing the excessive mitochondrial auto-phagic activity and reducing the excessively elevated ALD level, thereby ameliorating fatigue and myocardial injury.", "journal": "Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica", "date": "2022-12-07", "authors": ["Ya-HuiYuan", "RongYuan", "YuMiao", "YaWang", "Peng-QiLi", "Jia-QiHui", "Yu-FanPan", "Zi-HanLi", "Qi-QiXin", "Wei-HongCong"], "doi": "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220325.702"}

The rat model of chronic heart failure was established using isoproterenol. The modeled rats were divided into three groups by random number table: the model group, Shenfu group and glycopyrrolate group, and the normal group was also set. The rats were administrated for 15 consecutive days, and on the following day after the last administration, they were sacrificed for sample collection. The cardiac mass index and left ventricular mass index of the rats in each group were measured, and the echocardiogram was used to analyze the cardiac function indices, and ELISA to test the inflammatory indices in rat serum. The pathological morphology and fibrosis status of rat heart tissues were observed by HE staining and Masson staining, respectively. The content of HMGB1 was determined by immunofluorescence staining. The protein and mRNA expression of HMGB1/TLR4/TLR4 signaling pathway was detected by Western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively. The results showed that the chronic heart failure rat model was successfully prepared. The rats in the model group had reduced cardiac function, increased levels of HMGB1 and inflammatory factors(P&lt;0.05), and elevated protein and mRNA expression of HMGB1, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-\u03baB P65 in myocardial tissue(P&lt;0.05), with fibrous connective tissue hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration and severe fibrosis. Shenfu Injection improved cardiac function, decreased the levels of HMGB1 and inflammatory factors(P&lt;0.05) and the protein and mRNA expression of HMGB1, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-\u03baB P65 in myocardial tissue(P&lt;0.05), ameliorated interstitial fibrous connective tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced fibrosis.

Mitochondrial damage-induced cardiomyocyte death is considered an essential cue for DOX cardiotoxicity. FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1) is a mitochondrial membrane protein participating in the regulation of mitochondrial integrity in multiple diseases although its role in DOX cardiomyopathy remains elusive. Here, we examined whether PANoptosis, a novel type of programmed cell death closely associated with mitochondrial damage, was involved in DOX-induced heart injury, and FUNDC1-mediated regulation of cardiomyocyte PANoptosis, if any. FUNDC1 was downregulated in heart tissues in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and DOX-challenged mice. FUNDC1 deficiency aggravated DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, mitochondrial injury, and cardiomyocyte PANoptosis. Further examination revealed that FUNDC1 countered cytoplasmic release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and activation of PANoptosome through interaction with mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), a key factor in the translational expression and repair of mitochondrial DNA, via its 96-133 amino acid domain. TUFM intervention reversed FUNDC1-elicited protection against DOX-induced mtDNA cytosolic release and cardiomyocyte PANoptosis.

Finally, validation analysis was performed using animal models.\nEight immune-related core genes were identified. GO and KEGG showed that core genes were mainly enriched in angiogenesis and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Immune infiltration results showed that activated dendritic cells, central memory CD4 T cells, central memory CD8 T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), neutrophils, and regulatory T cells may be involved in DHF.

{"title": "Segmentation of human aorta using 3D nnU-net-oriented deep learning.", "abstract": "Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has become the main imaging technique for cardiovascular diseases. Before performing the transcatheter aortic valve intervention operation, segmenting images of the aortic sinus and nearby cardiovascular tissue from enhanced images of the human heart is essential for auxiliary diagnosis and guiding doctors to make treatment plans. This paper proposes a nnU-Net (no-new-Net) framework based on deep learning (DL) methods to segment the aorta and the heart tissue near the aortic valve in cardiac CTA images, and verifies its accuracy and effectiveness. A total of 130 sets of cardiac CTA image data (88 training sets, 22 validation sets, and 20 test sets) of different subjects have been used for the study. The advantage of the nnU-Net model is that it can automatically perform preprocessing and data augmentation according to the input image data, can dynamically adjust the network structure and parameter configuration, and has a high model generalization ability. Experimental results show that the DL method based on nnU-Net can accurately and effectively complete the segmentation task of cardiac aorta and cardiac tissue near the root on the cardiac CTA dataset, and achieves an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9698 \u00b1 0.0081. The actual inference segmentation effect basically meets the preoperative needs of the clinic.

This epidemic-driven detrimental events in the cardiac tissues start with the altered distribution and metabolism pattern of high-density lipoprotein\u00a0and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leading to cholesterol (oxidized LDL) deposition on the arterial wall and atherosclerotic plaque generation, followed by vascular spasms and infarction. Subsequently, obesity-triggered metabolic malfunctions induce free radical generation which may further trigger pro-inflammatory signaling and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells\u00a0transcriptional factor, thus inducing interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. This terrifying cardiomyopathy can be further aggravated in type 2 diabetes mellitus, thereby making\u00a0obese diabetic patients prone toward\u00a0the development of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in comparison to their nondiabetic counterparts. The accelerated oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, followed by apoptosis in obese diabetic individuals, causing progression of athero-thrombotic vascular disease. Being an efficient antioxidative and anti-inflammatory indolamine, melatonin effectively inhibits lipid peroxidation, pro-inflammatory reactions, thereby resolving free radical-induced myocardial damages along with maintaining antioxidant reservoir to preserve cardiovascular integrity. Prolonged melatonin treatment maintains balanced body weight and serum total cholesterol\u00a0concentration by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and promoting cholesterol catabolism. Additionally, melatonin promotes macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory state, providing a proper shield during the recovery period. Therefore, the protective role of melatonin in maintaining the lipid metabolism homeostasis and blocking the atherosclerotic plaque rupture could be targeted as the possible therapeutic strategy for the management of obesity-induced acute MI.

{"title": "Effects of Semaglutide on Cardiac Protein Expression and Cardiac Function of Obese Mice.", "abstract": "Using proteomics to study the effect of semaglutide on cardiac protein expression in obese mice. Assessment of the effect of semaglutide on cardiac function in obese mice.\nThe mice were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (WC), the high-fat group (WF), and the high-fat diet with semaglutide intervention group (WS). Serum samples were collected, and lipids, blood glucose, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, and cardiac ultrasound, were examined. The cardiac weight of each group of mice was measured, and pathological alterations were examined. Inflammation and oxidative stress levels in heart tissue were evaluated. The labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform was used to find differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and screen for related pathways and key proteins in a proteomics study.\nSemaglutide greatly alleviated obesity-induced lipid metabolism abnormalities, improved cardiac ventricular wall thickening, and significantly reduced myocardial collagen content in obese mice. Semaglutide significantly reduces obesity-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. There were 64 DEPs in the WF/WC group, with 39 upregulated proteins and 25 downregulated proteins. The WS/WC group, on the other hand, had 83 DEPs, including 57 upregulated and 26 downregulated proteins. Following functional analysis, DEPs were shown to be largely associated with lipid metabolism and peroxisomes. Apolipoprotein A-II, catalase, diazepam-binding inhibitor, paraoxonase-1, and hydroxysteroid 17-dehydrogenase-4 were all upregulated in the WF group but significantly downregulated in the WS group.

{"title": "Melatonin Attenuates Extracellular Matrix Accumulation and Cardiac Injury Manifested by Copper.", "abstract": "Copper-induced cardiac injury is not widely reported in spite of its ability to cause oxidative damage and tissue injury. Structural and morphological changes in the cardiac tissue are triggered via oxidative stress and inflammatory responses following copper exposure. The varied and unavoidable exposure of copper through contaminated food and water warrants a safe and effective agent against its harmful effects. Since the heart is highly sensitive to changes in the redox balance, the present study was undertaken to examine the protective effects of melatonin against copper-induced cardiac injury. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to 100\u00a0ppm of elemental copper via drinking water for 4\u00a0months. The cardiac tissue was evaluated for various biochemical, histological, and protein expression studies. Animals exposed to copper exhibited induced oxidative stress and cardiac injury compared to normal control. To this end, we found that melatonin treatment ameliorated copper-induced alterations in tissue oxidative variables like ROS, nitrate, MDA, and GSH. In addition, histological examinations unravelled decreased cardiac muscle dilation, atrophy, and cardiomyopathy in melatonin-treated rats. Furthermore, melatonin-treated rats were associated with reduced tissue copper levels, collagen deposition, \u03b1-SMA, and increased HO-1 expression as compared to rats exposed exclusively to copper. Moreover, the levels of NF-\u03baB and cardiac markers such as CK-MB, cTnI, and cTnT were found to be decreased in the melatonin-treated animals. Altogether, melatonin-triggered increase in antioxidant capacity resulting in reduced aggregation of ECM components demonstrates the therapeutic potential of melatonin in the treatment of cardiac injury and tissue fibrosis.", "journal": "Biological trace element research", "date": "2022-12-01", "authors": ["Syed AfrozAli", "SumadhuraBommaraju", "JayantPatwa", "PujaKhare", "MaheshRachamalla", "SomNiyogi", "Ashok KumarDatusalia"], "doi": "10.1007/s12011-022-03509-8"}
{"title": "Distinct Transcriptomic and Proteomic Profile Specifies Patients Who Have Heart Failure With Potential of Myocardial Recovery on Mechanical Unloading and Circulatory Support.", "abstract": "Extensive evidence from single-center studies indicates that a subset of patients with chronic advanced heart failure (HF) undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support show significantly improved heart function and reverse structural remodeling (ie, termed \"responders\"). Furthermore, we recently published a multicenter prospective study, RESTAGE-HF (Remission from Stage D Heart Failure), demonstrating that LVAD support combined with standard HF medications induced remarkable cardiac structural and functional improvement, leading to high rates of LVAD weaning and excellent long-term outcomes. This intriguing phenomenon provides great translational and clinical promise, although the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this recovery are largely unknown.\nTo identify changes in signaling pathways operative in the normal and failing human heart and to molecularly characterize patients who respond favorably to LVAD unloading, we performed global RNA sequencing and phosphopeptide profiling of left ventricular tissue from 93 patients with HF undergoing LVAD implantation (25 responders and 68 nonresponders) and 12 nonfailing donor hearts. Patients were prospectively monitored through echocardiography to characterize their myocardial structure and function and identify responders and nonresponders.\nThese analyses identified 1341 transcripts and 288 phosphopeptides that are differentially regulated in cardiac tissue from nonfailing control samples and patients with HF. In addition, these unbiased molecular profiles identified a unique signature of 29 transcripts and 93 phosphopeptides in patients with HF that distinguished responders after LVAD unloading. Further analyses of these macromolecules highlighted differential regulation in 2 key pathways: cell cycle regulation and extracellular matrix/focal adhesions.\nThis is the first study to characterize changes in the nonfailing and failing human heart by integrating multiple -omics platforms to identify molecular indices defining patients capable of myocardial recovery.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and genistein (G) supplementation on oxidative stress, apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart tissue of elderly rats.\nIn this experimental study, 40 elderly female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0months and weighing 250\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0g were randomly divided into five groups of eight animals, including: (1) control (C), (2) sham (Sh), (3) HIIT, (4) HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0G and (5) G. Also, to evaluate the effect of time passage on the variables, 8 healthy young rats were included in the healthy young control group. HIIT protocol was performed for eight weeks, three sessions with an intensity of 95-90\u00a0% VO\nIn the HIIT and HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0G groups, levels of Bax, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, MDA, PAB, GSSG were lower and levels of PGC-1\u03b1, TFAM, GSH, GSH/GSSG ratio and NDUFS7 were higher than the control and sham groups (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). In the HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0G group, levels of Bcl-2 were significantly higher than the control group (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). In the HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0G group, levels of Bax, GSSG, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and PAB were lower, and levels of GSH/GSSG ratio, Bcl-2, PGC-1\u03b1, TFAM and NDUFS7 were higher than the G consumption group (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). In the HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0G group, levels of PGC-1\u03b1 and TFAM were significantly higher and levels of MDA and PAB were lower than the HIIT group (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).\nBoth HIIT and G consumption seem to have beneficial effects on reducing oxidative stress; in addition, the interaction of these two variables on the improvement of apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis is more favorable than the effect of either one alone. However, more studies are needed on different pathways of apoptosis following G administration.", "journal": "Experimental gerontology", "date": "2022-11-29", "authors": ["RostamAlizadeh", "OmidrezaSalehi", "NajmehRezaeinezhad", "Seyed AliHosseini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.exger.2022.112039"}

{"title": "A soft and ultrasensitive force sensing diaphragm for probing cardiac organoids instantaneously and wirelessly.", "abstract": "Time-lapse mechanical properties of stem cell derived cardiac organoids are important biological cues for understanding contraction dynamics of human heart tissues, cardiovascular functions and diseases. However, it remains difficult to directly, instantaneously and accurately characterize such mechanical properties in real-time and in situ because cardiac organoids are topologically complex, three-dimensional soft tissues suspended in biological media, which creates a mismatch in mechanics and topology with state-of-the-art force sensors that are typically rigid, planar and bulky. Here, we present a soft resistive force-sensing diaphragm based on ultrasensitive resistive nanocracked platinum film, which can be integrated into an all-soft culture well via an oxygen plasma-enabled bonding process. We show that a reliable organoid-diaphragm contact can be established by an 'Atomic Force Microscope-like' engaging process. This allows for instantaneous detection of the organoids' minute contractile forces and beating patterns during electrical stimulation, resuscitation, drug dosing, tissue culture, and disease modelling.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2022-11-27", "authors": ["QuanxiaLyu", "ShuGong", "Jarmon GLees", "JialiangYin", "Lim WeiYap", "Anne MKong", "QianqianShi", "RunfangFu", "QiangZhu", "AshDyer", "Jennifer MDyson", "Shiang YLim", "WenlongCheng"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-022-34860-y\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.03.013\n10.1002/smll.202005828\n10.21037/jtd.2016.12.37\n10.1089/ten.tec.2014.0283\n10.1038/s41598-018-28393-y\n10.3390/bios7030024\n10.1038/ncomms10312\n10.1038/nnano.2011.160\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1038/nprot.2018.006\n10.1038/s41467-019-14019-y\n10.1038/nmat4782\n10.1038/s41565-018-0331-8\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02512\n10.1126/sciadv.aax0729\n10.1038/nnano.2016.96\n10.1038/nmat4590\n10.1002/adma.202100026\n10.1038/s41467-020-19659-z\n10.1038/s41378-020-00234-x\n10.1159/000443124\n10.1016/j.vascn.2020.106892\n10.1038/nature14002\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.04.011\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112468\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.02.015\n10.1038/415198a\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.09.016\n10.1124/jpet.109.153304\n10.1159/000188069\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.315913\n10.1089/ten.tea.2020.0078\n10.1126/science.1151526\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.05.067\n10.1046/j.1542-474X.2003.08413.x"}

{"title": "Design and Fabrication of Mature Engineered Pre-Cardiac Tissue Utilizing 3D Bioprinting Technology and Enzymatically Crosslinking Hydrogel.", "abstract": "The fabrication of mature engineered cardiac tissue is one of the major challenges in cardiac tissue engineering. For this purpose, we attempted to apply the 3D bioprinting approach. Aiming to construct an oriented tissue, a fine fiber-shaped scaffold with a support structure was first designed using CAD software. Then, a 3D bioprinter and cell-adhesive bio-inks were utilized to fabricate this structure. The cell-adhesive bio-inks were synthesized by combining sodium alginate and gelatin with tyramine, respectively, to form pre-gel materials that allow enzymatic crosslinking by horseradish peroxidase. By absorbance measurements, we confirmed that the tyramine modification rate of each polymer was 0.535 mmol/g-alginate and 0.219 mmol/g-gelatin. The width of the fiber-shaped scaffold was 216.8 \u00b1 24.3 \u03bcm for the fabricated scaffold, while the design value was 200 \u03bcm. After 3D printing and adhesion-adding treatment of the scaffold with these bio-ink materials, cardiomyocytes were seeded and cultured. As a result, the cells spread onto the scaffold, and the entire pre-tissue contracted synchronously by day 6 of culture, showing a greater pulsatility than in the early days. Video analysis showed that the beating rate of pre-myocardial tissue on day 6 was 31 beats/min. In addition, we confirmed that the cardiomyocytes partially elongated along the long axis of the fiber-shaped scaffold in the pre-tissue cultured for 15 days by staining actin, suggesting the possibility of cell orientation. Furthermore, treatment with adrenaline resulted in a 7.7-fold increase in peak beating rate compared to that before treatment (from 6 beats/min to 46 beats/min), confirming the responsiveness of the pre-tissues to the drug.

{"title": "A Bionic Testbed for Cardiac Ablation Tools.", "abstract": "Bionic-engineered tissues have been proposed for testing the performance of cardiovascular medical devices and predicting clinical outcomes ex vivo. Progress has been made in the development of compliant electronics that are capable of monitoring treatment parameters and being coupled to engineered tissues; however, the scale of most engineered tissues is too small to accommodate the size of clinical-grade medical devices. Here, we show substantial progress toward bionic tissues for evaluating cardiac ablation tools by generating a centimeter-scale human cardiac disk and coupling it to a hydrogel-based soft-pressure sensor. The cardiac tissue with contiguous electromechanical function was made possible by our recently established method to 3D bioprint human pluripotent stem cells in an extracellular matrix-based bioink that allows for in situ cell expansion prior to cardiac differentiation. The pressure sensor described here utilized electrical impedance tomography to enable the real-time spatiotemporal mapping of pressure distribution. A cryoablation tip catheter was applied to the composite bionic tissues with varied pressure. We found a close correlation between the cell response to ablation and the applied pressure. Under some conditions, cardiomyocytes could survive in the ablated region with more rounded morphology compared to the unablated controls, and connectivity was disrupted. This is the first known functional characterization of living human cardiomyocytes following an ablation procedure that suggests several mechanisms by which arrhythmia might redevelop following an ablation. Thus, bionic-engineered testbeds of this type can be indicators of tissue health and function and provide unique insight into human cell responses to ablative interventions.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-11-27", "authors": ["Wei-HanLin", "ZhijieZhu", "VasanthRavikumar", "VinodSharma", "Elena GTolkacheva", "Michael CMcAlpine", "Brenda MOgle"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms232214444\n10.1371/journal.pone.0219442\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1038/s41551-018-0271-5\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.1038/s41467-019-13868-x\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.08.079\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2008.01335.x\n10.1056/NEJMoa050955\n10.1016/j.eupc.2005.05.016\n10.1046/j.1460-9592.2002.00463.x\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2008.01355.x\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.07.011\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2009.01693.x\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2005.40571.x\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31277-6\n10.1093/europace/euq434\n10.4022/jafib.1620\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970350\n10.1155/2015/909012\n10.1111/jce.14911\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00043\n10.3389/fphys.2020.572874\n10.1038/s41551-018-0282-2\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2297380\n10.1038/nmat2971\n10.1088/0967-3334/27/5/S03\n10.1038/s41598-019-45484-6\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2375346\n10.1145/3264955\n10.1108/02602281211257542\n10.2459/JCM.0000000000000633\n10.1126/science.1240228\n10.1126/sciadv.aba5575\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316155\n10.1038/srep29933\n10.1016/j.eml.2018.02.002\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.02.007\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1126/sciadv.1500758\n10.1007/s12265-011-9304-0\n10.1038/srep18705\n10.3390/ijms221910430\n10.1203/01.PDR.0000148066.34743.10\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000058706.82623.A1\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2007.00975.x\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2007.00726.x\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.010\n10.1038/srep06716\n10.1016/j.jvir.2009.05.038\n10.1161/CIRCEP.119.008251\n10.1177/2050312118769797\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2008.00989.x\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1111/jce.12200\n10.1002/btpr.2087"}
{"title": "Scalable Generation of Nanovesicles from Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Cardiac Repair.", "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from stem cells have shown significant therapeutic potential to repair injured cardiac tissues and regulate pathological fibrosis. However, scalable generation of stem cells and derived EVs for clinical utility remains a huge technical challenge. Here, we report a rapid size-based extrusion strategy to generate EV-like membranous nanovesicles (NVs) from easily sourced human iPSCs in large quantities (yield 900\u00d7 natural EVs). NVs isolated using density-gradient separation (buoyant density 1.13 g/mL) are spherical in shape and morphologically intact and readily internalised by human cardiomyocytes, primary cardiac fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. NVs captured the dynamic proteome of parental cells and include pluripotency markers (LIN28A, OCT4) and regulators of cardiac repair processes, including tissue repair (GJA1, HSP20/27/70, HMGB1), wound healing (FLNA, MYH9, ACTC1, ILK), stress response/translation initiation (eIF2S1/S2/S3/B4), hypoxia response (HMOX2, HSP90, GNB1), and extracellular matrix organization (ITGA6, MFGE8, ITGB1). Functionally, NVs significantly promoted tubule formation of endothelial cells (angiogenesis) (p < 0.05) and survival of cardiomyocytes exposed to low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) (p < 0.0001), as well as attenuated TGF-\u03b2 mediated activation of cardiac fibroblasts (p < 0.0001). Quantitative proteome profiling of target cell proteome following NV treatments revealed upregulation of angiogenic proteins (MFGE8, MYH10, VDAC2) in endothelial cells and pro-survival proteins (CNN2, THBS1, IGF2R) in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, NVs attenuated TGF-\u03b2-driven extracellular matrix remodelling capacity in cardiac fibroblasts (ACTN1, COL1A1/2/4A2/12A1, ITGA1/11, THBS1).

{"title": "AIBP Regulates Metabolism of Ketone and Lipids but Not Mitochondrial Respiration.", "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the APOA1 binding protein (AIBP)-a secreted protein-plays a profound role in lipid metabolism. Interestingly, AIBP also functions as an NAD(P)H-hydrate epimerase to catalyze the interconversion of NAD(P)H hydrate [NAD(P)HX] epimers and is renamed as NAXE. Thus, we call it NAXE hereafter. We investigated its role in NAD(P)H-involved metabolism in murine cardiomyocytes, focusing on the metabolism of hexose, lipids, and amino acids as well as mitochondrial redox function. Unbiased metabolite profiling of cardiac tissue shows that NAXE knockout markedly upregulates the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3-HB) and increases or trends increasing lipid-associated metabolites cholesterol, \u03b1-linolenic acid and deoxycholic acid. Paralleling greater ketone levels, ChemRICH analysis of the NAXE-regulated metabolites shows reduced abundance of hexose despite similar glucose levels in control and NAXE-deficient blood. NAXE knockout reduces cardiac lactic acid but has no effect on the content of other NAD(P)H-regulated metabolites, including those associated with glucose metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, or Krebs cycle flux.

{"title": "Unveiling Human Proteome Signatures of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.", "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a highly prevalent but still poorly understood clinical entity. Its current pathophysiological understanding supports a critical role of comorbidities and their chronic effect on cardiac function and structure. Importantly, despite the replication of some HFpEF phenotypic features, to this day, experimental models have failed to bring new effective therapies to the clinical setting. Thus, the direct investigation of HFpEF human myocardial samples may unveil key, and possibly human-specific, pathophysiological mechanisms. This study employed quantitative proteomic analysis by advanced mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) to investigate signaling pathways and pathophysiological mechanisms in HFpEF. Protein-expression profiles were analyzed in human left ventricular myocardial samples of HFpEF patients and compared with a mixed control group. Functional analysis revealed several proteins that correlate with HFpEF, including those associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Despite the known disease heterogeneity, proteomic profiles could indicate a reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and fatty-acid oxidation capacity in HFpEF patients with diabetes. The proteomic characterization described in this work provides new insights. Furthermore, it fosters further questions related to HFpEF cellular pathophysiology, paving the way for additional studies focused on developing novel therapies and diagnosis strategies for HFpEF patients.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2022-11-27", "authors": ["Maria JSebasti\u00e3o", "Henrique VAlmeida", "MargaridaSerra", "NazhaHamdani", "FranciscaSaraiva", "Andr\u00e9 PLouren\u00e7o", "Ant\u00f3nio SBarros", "FranciscoVasques-N\u00f3voa", "AdelinoLeite-Moreira", "Paula MAlves", "In\u00easFalc\u00e3o-Pires", "Patr\u00edciaGomes-Alves"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines10112943\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.056824\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.045810\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.932996\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024593\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.11.040\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.076075\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.193326\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.025270\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.120.007421\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.11.011\n10.1161/JAHA.116.004382\n10.1002/ejhf.414\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.12.045\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001633\n10.1093/EURHEARTJ/EHW128\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.06.020\n10.1016/j.trsl.2019.09.001\n10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037\n10.1038/nmeth.3901\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.02.092\n10.1002/ejhf.2332\n10.1007/s12471-016-0810-1\n10.1042/BJ20150019\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.09.008\n10.1186/s12967-020-02304-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302095\n10.1002/ehf2.13405\n10.1073/pnas.1113987109\n10.1002/ana.21332\n10.1016/j.molmet.2018.05.002\n10.1016/j.bj.2021.11.012\n10.1093/cvr/cvp261\n10.1083/jcb.137.3.685\n10.1074/jbc.M505061200\n10.1074/jbc.M703510200\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.5.736\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.08.061\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.01.013\n10.2337/db14-0874\n10.1016/j.cjca.2017.03.009\n10.3389/fendo.2021.642857\n10.2337/db17-1195\n10.1097/00005344-199600003-00003\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2009\n10.1016/j.nuclcard.2006.01.021\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01967-8\n10.1007/s00592-013-0498-2\n10.1038/s41598-017-07958-3\n10.3389/fgene.2021.652315"}
{"title": "Versatility of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in tissue repair and regenerative applications.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent somatic cells that have been widely explored in the field of regenerative medicine. MSCs possess the ability to secrete soluble factors as well as lipid bound extracellular vesicles (EVs). MSCs have gained increased interest and attention as a result of their therapeutic properties, which are thought to be attributed to their secretome. However, while the use of MSCs as whole cells pose heterogeneity concerns and survival issues post-transplantation, such limitations are absent in cell-free EV-based treatments. EVs derived from MSCs are promising therapeutic agents for a range of clinical conditions and disorders owing to their immunomodulatory, pro-regenerative, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic activity. Recent successes with preclinical studies using EVs for repair and regeneration of damaged tissues such as cardiac tissue, lung, liver, pancreas, bone, skin, cornea, and blood diseases are discussed in this review. We also discuss delivery strategies of EVs using biomaterials as delivery vehicles through systemic or local administration. Despite its effectiveness in preclinical investigations, the application of MSC-EV in clinical settings will necessitate careful consideration surrounding issues such as: i) scalability and isolation, ii) biodistribution, iii) targeting specific tissues, iv) quantification and characterization, and v) safety and efficacy of dosage. The future of EVs in regenerative medicine is promising yet still needs further investigation on enhancing the efficacy, scalability, and potency for clinical applications.", "journal": "Biochimie", "date": "2022-11-26", "authors": ["TaylorWilliams", "GhazalehSalmanian", "MorganBurns", "VitaliMaldonado", "EmmaSmith", "Ryan MPorter", "Young HyeSong", "Rebekah MargaretSamsonraj"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biochi.2022.11.011"}

Three specimens, DNA isolated from scrappings of wax surface, from the surface of a wooden plate, and from the linen cloth that have had contact with the object were subjected to nanosequencing. From the first two, among all reads identified, only one classified as Propionibacterium acnes (synonymous current name Cutibacterium acnes), had a purported clinical significance.

{"title": "How can the adult zebrafish and neonatal mice teach us about stimulating cardiac regeneration in the human heart?", "abstract": "The proliferative capacity of mammalian cardiomyocytes diminishes shortly after birth. In contrast, adult zebrafish and neonatal mice can regenerate cardiac tissues, highlighting new potential therapeutic avenues. Different factors have been found to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in zebrafish and neonatal mice;\u00a0these include maintenance of mononuclear and diploid cardiomyocytes and upregulation of the proto-oncogene c-Myc. The growth factor NRG-1 controls cell proliferation and interacts with the Hippo-Yap pathway to modulate regeneration. Key components of the extracellular matrix such as Agrin are also crucial for cardiac regeneration. Novel therapies explored in this review, include intramyocardial injection of Agrin or zebrafish-ECM and NRG-1 administration. These therapies may induce regeneration in patients and should be further explored.\nThe heart pumps blood across the body carrying nutrients and oxygen where they are needed. If the heart is damaged\u00a0(e.g., after a heart attack), it may lose its ability to pump blood, and this can lead to heart failure, where the heart cannot meet the body's needs, leaving the affected person tired and breathless. This occurs because the human heart unfortunately has a limited ability to heal and regain function. Current therapies for heart injuries focus on minimizing the problems resulting from the injury but cannot recover damaged heart tissue. Scientists have found that in contrast to adult human hearts, the hearts of baby mice and zebrafish can repair themselves after injuries and recover normal function. This review highlights some important mechanisms that occur in the hearts of baby mice and zebrafish, which may help contribute to their regenerative abilities. These mechanisms involve small messenger chemicals that stimulate heart cells to replicate and reform normal heart tissues. Further research into these pathways may help develop new therapies for damaged human hearts and help them regain function.", "journal": "Regenerative medicine", "date": "2022-11-24", "authors": ["MichelaSorbini", "SammyArab", "TaraSoni", "AngelosFrisiras", "SamayMehta"], "doi": "10.2217/rme-2022-0161"}

Parthanatos is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death. Here, we aimed to explore whether DEX protects cardiomyocytes from parthanatos in chronic heart failure (CHF). The levels of malondialdehyde (MAD), total superoxide dismutase (SOD), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured by corresponding detection kits. CHF mice model was established by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). PARP-1 expression in cardiac tissues of wild-type CHF mice was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) on cell death. Masson trichrome staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining were conducted in cardiac tissues to evaluate the histological changes. TUNEL and caspase-1 double-staining and caspase-1 and NLRP3 double-staining were conducted in cardiac tissues to evaluate the effect of DEX on cell death in vivo. The relative expression of parthanatos and NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins was evaluated by western blotting. MNNG induced parthanatos in mouse HL-1 cardiomyocytes. MNNG-induced parthanatos was promoted by ROS production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. DEX treatment suppressed MNNG-induced parthanatos via NLRP3 inflammasome activation mediated by ROS. Importantly, DEX inhibited pathological changes and parthanatos in CHF mice. DEX suppressed the ROS/NLRP3 signaling pathway in CHF mice. DEX inhibited parthanatos in cardiomyocytes and in CHF mice by regulating the ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

{"title": "Differential effects of age, sex and dexamethasone therapy on ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "abstract": "ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are crucial for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell. Although ACE2 facilitates viral entry, its loss leads to promoting the devastating clinical symptoms of COVID-19 disease. Thus, enhanced ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression is likely to increase predisposition of target cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little evidence existed about the biological kinetics of these two enzymes and whether dexamethasone treatment modulates their expression. Here, we show that the expression of ACE2 at the protein and mRNA levels was significantly higher in the lung and heart tissues of neonatal compared to adult mice. However, the expression of TMPRSS2 was developmentally regulated. Our results may introduce a novel concept for the reduced susceptibility of the young to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, ACE2 expression but not TMPRSS2 was upregulated in adult female lungs compared to their male counterparts. Interestingly, the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions were upregulated by dexamethasone treatment in the lung and heart tissues in both neonatal and adult mice. Furthermore, our findings provide a novel mechanism for the observed differential therapeutic effects of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients. As such, dexamethasone exhibits different therapeutic effects depending on the disease stage. This was supported by increased ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently enhanced infection of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 once pre-treated with dexamethasone. Therefore, our results suggest that individuals who take dexamethasone for other clinical conditions may become more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2022-11-22", "authors": ["ShimaShahbaz", "OlaideOyegbami", "SuguruSaito", "MohammedOsman", "WendySligl", "ShokrollahElahi"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2022.1021928\n10.1001/jama.2020.2648\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6914e4\n10.4049/jimmunol.2000710\n10.1542/peds.2020-0702\n10.1128/mBio.00907-20\n10.1172/JCI140766\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052\n10.1038/s41564-020-0688-y\n10.1038/nm1267\n10.1152/ajplung.00498.2016\n10.1038/srep19840\n10.1038/srep07027\n10.1074/jbc.RA120.015303\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.042\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa311\n10.1001/jamacardio.2021.2065\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.3551\n10.1056/NEJMoa2002032\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.05.012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0247060\n10.1016/j.lfs.2006.09.028\n10.1073/pnas.2012358117\n10.1056/NEJMoa2021436\n10.1001/jama.2020.17023\n10.1007/s00262-020-02555-2\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1008696\n10.4049/jimmunol.1901481\n10.1002/cti2.1289\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.04.001\n10.4049/jimmunol.2100446\n10.1128/MCB.26.3.965-975.2006\n10.1038/s41420-020-0276-1\n10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00216-0\n10.3389/fgene.2020.607479\n10.1038/s41598-020-79595-2\n10.1007/s00134-020-05985-9\n10.1172/JCI137244\n10.1126/sciadv.abf8609\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.06.007\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.07.005\n10.1503/cmaj.201686\n10.1111/ijcp.14470\n10.15585/mmwr.mm7035e5\n10.1038/nature12675\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.597433\n10.1128/mBio.00384-21\n10.1164/rccm.201706-1172OC\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000004093\n10.1016/j.jcv.2004.07.006\n10.1371/journal.pmed.0030343\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16255-7\n10.1038/s41591-020-0869-5\n10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30196-1\n10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x\n10.1007/s00018-022-04220-6\n10.1128/spectrum.01730-22\n10.1124/dmd.118.080697\n10.1211/0022357055380\n10.1007/s11095-019-2745-x\n10.1038/s41587-021-01155-4"}

{"title": "Intracoronary transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes: Inefficient procedure for cardiac regeneration.", "abstract": "Advances in stem cell biology have facilitated cardiac regeneration, and many animal studies and several initial clinical trials have been conducted using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs). Most preclinical and clinical studies have typically transplanted PSC-CMs via the following two distinct approaches: direct intramyocardial injection or epicardial delivery of engineered heart tissue. Both approaches present common disadvantages, including a mandatory thoracotomy and poor engraftment. Furthermore, a standard transplantation approach has yet to be established. In this study, we tested the feasibility of performing intracoronary administration of PSC-CMs based on a commonly used method of transplanting somatic stem cells. Six male cynomolgus monkeys underwent intracoronary administration of dispersed human PSC-CMs or PSC-CM aggregates, which are called cardiac spheroids, with multiple cell dosages. The recipient animals were sacrificed at 4\u00a0weeks post-transplantation for histological analysis. Intracoronary administration of dispersed human PSC-CMs in the cynomolgus monkeys did not lead to coronary embolism or graft survival. Although the transplanted cardiac spheroids became partially engrafted, they also induced scar formation due to cardiac ischemic injury. Cardiac engraftment and scar formation were reasonably consistent with the spheroid size or cell dosage. These findings indicate that intracoronary transplantation of PSC-CMs is an inefficient therapeutic approach.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2022-11-21", "authors": ["HidekiKobayashi", "ShugoTohyama", "HideakiKanazawa", "HajimeIchimura", "ShujiChino", "YukiTanaka", "YotaSuzuki", "JianZhao", "NaokoShiba", "ShinKadota", "KazumasaNarita", "TakafumiNaito", "TatsuichiroSeto", "KoichiroKuwahara", "YujiShiba", "KeiichiFukuda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.11.004"}
{"title": "Melt electrowriting of PLA, PCL, and composite PLA/PCL scaffolds for tissue engineering application.", "abstract": "Fabrication of well-ordered and bio-mimetic scaffolds is one of the most important research lines in tissue engineering. Different techniques have been utilized to achieve this goal, however, each method has its own disadvantages. Recently, melt electrowriting (MEW) as a technique for fabrication of well-organized scaffolds has attracted the researchers' attention due to simultaneous use of principles of additive manufacturing and electrohydrodynamic phenomena. In previous research studies, polycaprolactone (PCL) has been mostly used in MEW process. PCL is a biocompatible polymer with characteristics that make it easy to fabricate well-arranged structures using MEW device. However, the mechanical properties of PCL are not favorable for applications like bone tissue engineering. Furthermore, it is of vital importance to demonstrate the capability of MEW technique for processing a broad range of polymers. To address aforementioned problems, in this study, three ten-layered box-structured well-ordered scaffolds, including neat PLA, neat PCL, and PLA/PCL composite are fabricated using an MEW device. Printing of the composite PLA/PCL scaffold using the MEW device is conducted in this study for the first time. The MEW device used in this study is a commercial fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer which with some changes in its setup and configuration becomes prepared for being used as an MEW device. Since in most of previous studies, a setup has been designed and built for MEW process, the use of the FDM device can be considered as one of the novelties of this research. The printing parameters are adjusted in a way that scaffolds with nearly equal pore sizes in the range of 140\u00a0\u00b5m to 150\u00a0\u00b5m are fabricated. However, PCL fibers are mostly narrower (diameters in the range of 5\u00a0\u00b5m to 15\u00a0\u00b5m) than PLA fibers with diameters between 15 and 25\u00a0\u00b5m. Unlike the MEW process of PCL, accurate positioning of PLA fibers is difficult which can be due to higher viscosity of PLA melt compared to PCL melt. The printed composite PLA/PCL scaffold possesses a well-ordered box structure with improved mechanical properties and cell-scaffold interactions compared to both neat PLA and PCL scaffolds. Besides, the composite scaffold exhibits a higher swelling ratio than the neat PCL scaffold which can be related to the presence of less hydrophobic PLA fibers. This scaffold demonstrates an anisotropic behavior during uniaxial tensile test in which its Young's modulus, ultimate tensile stress, and strain to failure all depend on the direction of the applied tensile force. This anisotropy makes the composite PLA/PCL scaffold an exciting candidate for applications in heart tissue engineering.

{"title": "Research Progress of Three-Dimensional Bioprinting Artificial Cardiac Tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the main diseases that endanger human life and health, and heart failure often occurs when the cardiovascular disease develops to the end-stage. Heart transplantation is the most effective treatment. However, there has always been a shortage of living heart organs. With the development of regenerative medicine, researchers have turned to bioprinting technology that can build tissues and organs in vitro. A large number of relevant literature on three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted hearts were searched and screened in Google Scholar. 3D bioprinting technology can accurately print biomaterials containing living cells into 3D functional living tissues, providing a feasible solution to the shortage of transplantable organs. As one of the most important organs in the human body, the research on 3D bioprinting of the heart has currently become a hot topic. This paper briefly overviews 3D bioprinting technology and the progress in bioprinting cardiac tissue.

{"title": "MiR-144-5p/CCL12 Signaling Axis Modulates Ischemic Preconditioning-Mediated Cardio-protection by Reducing Cell Viability, Enhancing Cell Apoptosis, Fibrosis, and Pyroptosis.", "abstract": "Ischemic postconditioning (IPost) represents short periods of nonlethal ischemia-reperfusion performed at the onset of reperfusion. Studies have shown that IPost involves various biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and pyroptosis and can activate complex signaling pathways. CCL12 is a critical mediator in the inflammatory process after tissue injury. In the present study, we examined the potential actions of CCL12-mediated signaling pathways in cardioprotection after IPost using a cardiomyocyte model. By applying the bioinformatics analysis, we found that CCL12 was upregulated in the rat heart tissues after I/R injury, and the expression level of CCL12 was restored in rats with IPost. The in vitro studies showed that CCL12 and CCR2 expression levels were upregulated in the hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9C2 cells, which was attenuated in the H/R\u2009+\u2009hypoxia post-conditioning (PostC) group. The functional assays showed that H/R treatment reduced cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, and promoted fibrosis and pyroptosis of H9C2 cells, which was attenuated in the H/R\u2009+\u2009PostC group. Overexpression of CCL12 impaired the protective action of hypoxia post-conditioning in the H9C2 cells. Further mechanistic studies showed that miR-144-5p could directly target the 3'\u00a0untranslated region of CCL12. Overexpression of miR-144-5p markedly repressed the expression levels of CCL12 and CCR2 in H9C2 cells, while miR-144-5p inhibition had the opposite effects. Furthermore, the inhibition of miR-144-5p reduced the cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, and enhanced fibrosis and pyroptosis of H9C2 cells after H/R or H/R\u2009+\u2009PostC treatment. In conclusion, CCL12 was downregulated in cardiomyocytes following ischemic postconditioning, and CCL12 overexpression impaired the cardioprotective actions of ischemic postconditioning by reducing cell viability, enhancing cell apoptosis, fibrosis, and pyroptosis. Further mechanistic evidence revealed that CCL12 was a direct target of miR-144-5p, and miR-144-5p/CCL12/CCR2 signaling may represent a critical pathway in mediating the cardioprotective effects of ischemic postconditioning.", "journal": "Applied biochemistry and biotechnology", "date": "2022-11-20", "authors": ["Jun-YuChen", "Huan-JunRuan", "Shi-YuChen", "Xiao-QingWang", "Jun-MinWen", "Zan-XinWang"], "doi": "10.1007/s12010-022-04208-9\n10.1056/NEJMe2000239\n10.3390/ijms21218118\n10.1016/B978-0-12-394309-5.00006-7\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118628\n10.1038/s41419-020-2686-7\n10.1038/nm.2507\n10.2174/1871525714666161216100553\n10.1165/rcmb.2005-0239OC\n10.14336/AD.2019.1229\n10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101671\n10.3233/HAB-2007-163-406\n10.3389/fncel.2015.00357\n10.1371/journal.pone.0221111\n10.1038/cddis.2016.223\n10.3892/ijmm.2016.2702\n10.3858/emm.2011.43.8.049\n10.1155/2019/8151836\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314028\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311327\n10.1038/s41590-018-0272-2\n10.1080/21655979.2022.2038448\n10.1016/j.jep.2021.114773\n10.3390/cells8020152\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110419\n10.1113/JP270318\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.06.044\n10.1371/journal.pone.0075872\n10.1093/cvr/cvy231\n10.1093/cvr/cvs096\n10.1007/s13577-020-00482-z\n10.1080/21655979.2021.2018093\n10.1111/jcmm.16072"}
{"title": "Cellular electrophysiological effects of botulinum toxin A on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and on cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Botulinum toxin A is a well-known neurotransmitter inhibitor with a wide range of applications in modern medicine. Recently, botulinum toxin A preparations have been used in clinical trials to suppress cardiac arrhythmias, especially in the postoperative period. Its antiarrhythmic action is associated with inhibition of the nervous system of the heart, but its direct effect on heart tissue remains unclear. Accordingly, we investigate the effect of botulinum toxin A on isolated cardiac cells and on layers of cardiac cells capable of conducting excitation. Cardiomyocytes of neonatal rat pups and human cardiomyocytes obtained through cell reprogramming were used. A patch-clamp study showed that botulinum toxin A inhibited fast sodium currents and L-type calcium currents in a dose-dependent manner, with no apparent effect on potassium currents. Optical mapping showed that in the presence of botulinum toxin A, the propagation of the excitation wave in the layer of cardiac cells slows down sharply, conduction at high concentrations becomes chaotic, but reentry waves do not form. The combination of botulinum toxin A with a preparation of chitosan showed a stronger inhibitory effect by an order of magnitude. Further, the inhibitory effect of botulinum toxin A is not permanent and disappears after 12\u00a0days of cell culture in a botulinum toxin A-free medium. The main conclusion of the work is that the antiarrhythmic effect of botulinum toxin A found in clinical studies is associated not only with depression of the nervous system but also with a direct effect on heart tissue. Moreover, the combination of botulinum toxin A and chitosan reduces the effective dose of botulinum toxin A.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2022-11-19", "authors": ["AygulNizamieva", "SheidaFrolova", "MihailSlotvitsky", "SandaaraKovalenko", "ValeriyaTsvelaya", "AnnaNikitina", "DavidSergeevichev", "KonstantinAgladze"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-022-02332-1\n10.3390/microorganisms10050886\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.12.004\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.09.001\n10.1016/j.toxicon.2017.08.014\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.275.1.H301\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2021.01.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0152018\n10.1152/physrev.00025.2003\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.01.030\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00007\n10.1016/j.tiv.2014.11.010\n10.4070/kcj.2010.40.8.387\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1007/s12012-019-09532-x\n10.1038/s41598-020-64581-5\n10.1248/bpb.b12-00002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1254/jjp.89.249"}

{"title": "Cardiotoxicity of pyrethroids: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic options for acute and long-term toxicity.", "abstract": "Pyrethroids (PY) are synthetic pesticides used in many applications ranging from large-scale agriculture to household maintenance. Their classical mechanisms of action are associated with binding to the sodium channel of insect neurons, disrupting its inactivation, ensuring their use as insecticides. However, PY can also lead to toxicity in vertebrates, including humans. In most toxicological studies, the impact of PY on heart function is neglected. Acute exposure to a high dose of PY causes enhancement of the late sodium current (INaL), which impairs the action potential waveform and can cause severe cardiac arrhythmias. Moreover, long-term, low-dose exposure to PY displays oxidative stress in the heart, which could induce tissue remodeling and impairment. Isolated and preliminary evidence supports that, for acute exposure to PY, an antiarrhythmic therapy with ranolazine (an INaL blocker), can be a promising therapeutic approach. Besides, heart tissue remodeling associated with low doses and long-term exposure to PY seems to benefit from antioxidant therapy. Despite significant leaps in understanding the mechanical details of PY intoxication, currently, few studies are focusing on the heart.

{"title": "Enhancing iPSC-CM Maturation Using a Matrigel-Coated Micropatterned PDMS Substrate.", "abstract": "Cardiac myocytes isolated from adult heart tissue have a rod-like shape with highly organized intracellular structures. Cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs), on the other hand, exhibit disorganized structure and contractile mechanics, reflecting their pronounced immaturity. These characteristics hamper research using iPSC-CMs. The protocol described here enhances iPSC-CM maturity and function by controlling the cellular shape and environment of the cultured cells. Microstructured silicone membranes function as a cell culture substrate that promotes cellular alignment. iPSC-CMs cultured on micropatterned membranes display an in-vivo-like rod-shaped morphology. This physiological cellular morphology along with the soft biocompatible silicone substrate, which has similar stiffness to the native cardiac matrix, promotes maturation of contractile function, calcium handling, and electrophysiology. Incorporating this technique for enhanced iPSC-CM maturation will help bridge the gap between animal models and clinical care, and ultimately improve personalized medicine for cardiovascular diseases. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

In China, it is widely used in prevention and treatment of various diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), traumatic injury, and fracture. However, its cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity seriously restrict its clinical application. Traditionally, Hezi (HZ, dry ripe fruit of Terminalia chebula Retz. and Terminalia chebula Retz. var. tomentella Kurt.) is generally used in combination with TBC for the purpose of toxicity reducing and efficacy enhancing, but so far we still can't clearly elucidate the compatibility effect and mechanism of the classical herbal pair.\nTo investigate the compatibility effect and mechanism of TBC co-administered with HZ.\nIn the present study, we clarified the cardioprotective role of HZ on the cardiotoxicity induced by TBC. The electrocardiogram, the levels of serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT), the activities of cardiac superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonaldehyde (MDA), and histopathology of heart tissue have been determined in each group.

{"title": "Inflammation and vascular remodeling in COVID-19 hearts.", "abstract": "A wide range of cardiac symptoms have been observed in COVID-19 patients, often significantly influencing the clinical outcome. While the pathophysiology of pulmonary COVID-19 manifestation has been substantially unraveled, the underlying pathomechanisms of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are largely unknown. In this multicentre study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of heart samples from 24 autopsies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared them to samples of age-matched Influenza H1N1 A (n\u2009=\u200916), lymphocytic non-influenza myocarditis cases (n\u2009=\u20098), and non-inflamed heart tissue (n\u2009=\u20099). We employed conventional histopathology, multiplexed immunohistochemistry (MPX), microvascular corrosion casting, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray phase-contrast tomography using synchrotron radiation, and direct multiplexed measurements of gene expression, to assess morphological and molecular changes holistically. Based on histopathology, none of the COVID-19 samples fulfilled the established diagnostic criteria of viral myocarditis. However, quantification via MPX showed a significant increase in perivascular CD11b/TIE2\u2009+\u2009-macrophages in COVID-19 over time, which was not observed in influenza or non-SARS-CoV-2 viral myocarditis patients. Ultrastructurally, a significant increase in intussusceptive angiogenesis as well as multifocal thrombi, inapparent in conventional morphological analysis, could be demonstrated. In line with this, on a molecular level, COVID-19 hearts displayed a distinct expression pattern of genes primarily coding for factors involved in angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), changes not seen in any of the other patient groups. We conclude that cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is an angiocentric macrophage-driven inflammatory process, distinct from classical anti-viral inflammatory responses, and substantially underappreciated by conventional histopathologic analysis. For the first time, we have observed intussusceptive angiogenesis in cardiac tissue, which we previously identified as the linchpin of vascular remodeling in COVID-19 pneumonia, as a pathognomic sign in affected hearts.

Cell therapy is a potential treatment but is usually limited by poor survival and retention of donor cells injected at the target site. Since much of the therapeutic effects occur via cell-secreted paracrine factors, including extracellular vesicles (EVs), we developed a porous material for cell encapsulation which would improve donor cell retention and survival, while allowing EV secretion. Human donor cardiac mesenchymal cells were used as a model therapeutic cell and the encapsulation system could sustain three-dimensional cell growth and secretion of therapeutic factors. Secretion of EVs and protective growth factors were increased by encapsulation, and secreted EVs had hypoxia-protective, pro-angiogenic activities in in vitro assays. In a mouse model of limb ischemia the implant improved angiogenesis and blood flow, and in an MI model the system preserved ejection fraction %. In both instances, the encapsulation system greatly extended donor cell retention and survival compared to directly injected cells.

The virus enters cells via its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Myocardial ACE2 expression is increased in structural heart disease (SHD). We, therefore, aimed to analyze correlations between structural heart disease and cardiac SARS-CoV-2 manifestation.\nThe clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with structural heart disease was assessed in a prospective cohort of 152 patients. The primary endpoints consisted of hospitalization and survival. Cardiac tissue of 23 autopsy cases with lethal COVID-19 course was obtained and analyzed for (a) the presence of SHD, (b) myocardial presence of SARS-CoV-2 via RT,-PCR, and (c) levels of ACE2 expression using immunofluorescence staining.\nStructural heart disease is found in 67 patients, of whom 56 (83.60%) are hospitalized. The myocardium is positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 15 patients (65%) in 23 autopsy cases of lethal COVID-19.

The ACE2 receptor is a cell surface protein found in many tissues, including the heart.

In this study, we identified heart disease as a risk factor for hospitalization in 152 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart was associated with altered levels of ACE2 receptors and with a shortened survival time in patients.

However, it is not clear how they kill cells and tissues that do not have the agonist peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on their surface, as in the settings of MHC class I deficient tumors and indirect rejection of MHC-mismatched transplants. CD8 T cells might respond to agonist antigen cross-presented on hematopoietic cells, leading to a \"bystander\" rejection. Alternatively, they may recognize agonist antigen cross-presented on recipient endothelial cells and kill the tissue's vital blood supply. The latter mechanism predicts that all non-vascularized grafts, grafts dependent on in-growth of recipient blood vessels, will be susceptible to CD8 T cell mediated indirect rejection. In contrast, we show here that non-vascularized transplants, bearing the same agonist antigen, are not universally susceptible to this rejection pathway. Non-vascularized skin, but not islet or heart tissue transplants were indirectly rejected by CD8 T cells. Furthermore, CD8 T cells were able to indirectly reject skin grafts when recipient MHC class I expression was restricted to bone marrow derived cells but not when it was restricted to radioresistant cells (e.g. endothelial cells). These findings argue against a major role for endothelial cell cross-presentation in killing of tissue that does not present the agonist peptide-MHC class I.

Cardiac tissue engineering aims to re-engineer the infarcted myocardium using tissues made from human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to regenerate heart muscle and restore contractile function via an implantable epicardial patch. The current limitations of this technology include both biomanufacturing challenges in maintaining tissue integrity during implantation and biological challenges in inducing cell alignment, maturation, and coordinated electromechanical function, which, when overcome, may be able to prevent adverse cardiac remodeling through mechanical support in the injured heart to facilitate regeneration. Polymer scaffolds serve to mechanically reinforce both engineered and host tissues. Here, we introduce a novel biodegradable, customizable scaffold composed of wet-spun polycaprolactone (PCL) microfibers to strengthen engineered tissues and provide an anisotropic mechanical environment to promote engineered tissue formation. We developed a wet-spinning process to produce consistent fibers which are then collected on an automated mandrel that precisely controls the angle of intersection of fibers and their spacing to generate mechanically anisotropic scaffolds. Through optimization of the wet-spinning process, we tuned the fiber diameter to 339 \u00b1 31 \u00b5m and 105 \u00b1 9 \u00b5m and achieved a high degree of fidelity in the fiber structure within the scaffold (fiber angle within 1.8\u00b0 of prediction).

Further, we embedded the fibrous PCL scaffolds in a collagen hydrogel mixed with hiPSC-CMs to form engineered cardiac tissue with high cell survival, tissue compaction, and active contractility of the hiPSC-CMs. Through this work, we develop and optimize a versatile biomanufacturing process to generate customizable PCL fibrous scaffolds which can be readily utilized to guide engineered tissue formation and function.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["Phillip RSchmitt", "Kiera DDwyer", "Alicia JMinor", "Kareen L KCoulombe"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14214571\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.12.015\n10.1002/clc.20922\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.610364\n10.1002/mabi.201200483\n10.1016/j.scr.2016.04.014\n10.1152/ajpheart.00799.2013\n10.1021/acsami.9b02446\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1529/biophysj.107.124545\n10.1007/s12265-010-9241-3\n10.1089/ten.tea.2018.0258\n10.1053/j.semtcvs.2005.09.006\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00255-2\n10.1016/j.jobcr.2019.10.003\n10.1021/acsabm.2c00174\n10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2005.10.016\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.933960\n10.1002/jbm.b.33966\n10.1088/1758-5090/ac0fc9\n10.3390/jfb10030030\n10.1089/ten.tec.2018.0379\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018293\n10.1016/j.xpro.2021.100334\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1080/09205063.2017.1354671\n10.1002/term.310\n10.3390/polym10040391\n10.1371/journal.pone.0180584\n10.3390/membranes8010012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.795732\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.09.019\n10.1038/s41551-019-0380-9\n10.1016/j.mtcomm.2020.101211\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.730-732.56\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.038\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.06.021\n10.3791/57239\n10.1113/jphysiol.1914.sp001669\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01112\n10.1002/jbm.a.33010\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2016.07.001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.05.048\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.12.003\n10.1115/1.4044030"}

Major mechanisms of DIC involve oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes and hyperactivated immune response. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate cell-cell communication during oxidative stress. However, functions of circulating EVs released after chronic DOXO exposure on cardiomyocytes and immune cells are still obscured. Herein, we developed a DIC in vivo model using male Wistar rats injected with 3 mg/kg DOXO for 6 doses within 30 days (18 mg/kg cumulative dose). One month after the last injection, the rats developed cardiotoxicity evidenced by increased BCL2-associated X protein and cleaved caspase-3 in heart tissues, along with N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide in sera. Serum EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography. EV functions on H9c2 cardiomyocytes and NR8383 macrophages were evaluated. EVs from DOXO-treated rats (DOXO_EVs) attenuated ROS production via increased glutathione peroxidase-1 and catalase gene expression, and reduced hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, DOXO_EVs induced ROS production, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while suppressing arginase-1 gene expression in macrophages. These results suggested the pleiotropic roles of EVs against DIC, which highlight the potential role of EV-based therapy for DIC with a concern of its adverse effect on immune response.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["ChontidaYarana", "PanjareeSiwaponanan", "ChayodomManeechote", "ThawatchaiKhuanjing", "BenjaminOngnok", "NanthipPrathumsap", "Siriporn CChattipakorn", "NiponChattipakorn", "KovitPattanapanyasat"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms232113465\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.09.1096\n10.1200/JCO.2001.19.13.3163\n10.1097/CAD.0b013e32803d36fe\n10.1038/s41419-021-03614-x\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.02.013\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2011.09.002\n10.1177/1535370217746383\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-3034\n10.1016/j.blre.2012.12.002\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2021.05.006\n10.3389/fnmol.2021.767219\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2804\n10.1007/s12265-016-9682-4\n10.1007/s12020-012-9839-0\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.09.021\n10.1016/j.cmet.2020.06.004\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.752019\n10.1080/20013078.2019.1626654\n10.3389/fcell.2020.620603\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-2046\n10.3389/fonc.2019.01113\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101237\n10.1186/s13287-015-0142-x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0240994\n10.1021/ja1014103\n10.3390/biom11111725\n10.1007/s10741-020-10063-9\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00533\n10.3402/jev.v4.27066\n10.1111/tra.12687\n10.1038/s41580-019-0158-7\n10.3390/cells10071763\n10.3390/ijms20153649\n10.1016/S0378-4274(01)00329-0\n10.3390/cells9020422\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.309417\n10.1038/srep33641\n10.2147/DMSO.S32923\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2021.01.051\n10.1083/jcb.201102095\n10.1126/science.270.5234.296\n10.1074/jbc.272.1.217\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.08.010\n10.1159/000047804\n10.3390/ijms21176105\n10.1080/08820139.2021.1882486\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.03.004\n10.4161/cbt.11.12.15540\n10.3390/ijms21041279\n10.3892/mmr.2020.11752\n10.1016/j.cyto.2014.12.024\n10.1007/s13277-016-5098-7\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2018.8\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.01818\n10.1042/CS20190960\n10.1111/bph.12176"}

{"title": "Apelin-13 Increases Functional Connexin-43 through Autophagy Inhibition via AKT/mTOR Pathway in the Non-Myocytic Cell Population of the Heart.", "abstract": "Studies have shown a link between the downregulation of connexin 43 (Cx43), the predominant isoform in cardiac gap junctions, and high susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyocyte death. Non-myocytic cells (NMCs), the most abundant component of the heart, exert multiple cardiac functions and represent an important therapeutic target for diseased cardiac tissue. A few studies have investigated the effect of Apelin-13, an endogenous peptide with a key role in various cardiovascular functions, on Cx43 expression in cardiomyocytes. However, it remained unknown whether Apelin-13 influences Cx43 expression in NMCs. Here, we found that in NMCs, Cx43 protein expression increased after Apelin-13 treatment (100 nM for 48 h). Furthermore, dye transfer assays proved that Apelin-13-treated NMCs had a greater ability to communicate with surrounding cardiomyocytes, and this effect was abrogated by carbenoxolone, a gap junction inhibitor. Interestingly, we showed that Apelin-13 increased Cx43 through autophagy inhibition, as proved by the upregulation of p62 and LC3I, acting as 3-MA, a well-known autophagy inhibitor.

{"title": "Electrophilic Aldehyde 4-Hydroxy-2-Nonenal Mediated Signaling and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a by-product of aerobic life, are highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons. The excess of ROS leads to oxidative stress, instigating the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the lipid membrane through a free radical chain reaction and the formation of the most bioactive aldehyde, known as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). 4-HNE functions as a signaling molecule and toxic product and acts mainly by forming covalent adducts with nucleophilic functional groups in proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. The mitochondria have been implicated as a site for 4-HNE generation and adduction. Several studies clarified how 4-HNE affects the mitochondria's functions, including bioenergetics, calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial dynamics. Our research group has shown that 4-HNE activates mitochondria apoptosis-inducing factor (AIFM2) translocation and facilitates apoptosis in mice and human heart tissue during anti-cancer treatment.

{"title": "Cardioprotective Effect of Taxifolin against Isoproterenol-Induced Cardiac Injury through Decreasing Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Cell Death, and Activating Nrf2/HO-1 in Mice.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation are key components in cardiovascular diseases and heart dysfunction. Herein, we evaluated the protective effects of (+)-taxifolin (TAX), a potent flavonoid with significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, on myocardial oxidative tissue injury, inflammation, and cell death, using a mouse model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced acute myocardial injury. Mice were given TAX (25 and 50 mg/kg, orally) for 14 days before receiving two subsequent injections of ISO (100 mg/kg, s.c.) at an interval of 24 h on the 15th and 16th days. The ISO-induced cardiac tissue injury was evidenced by increased serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), along with several histopathological changes. The ISO also induced increased malondialdehyde (MDA) with concomitant declined myocardial glutathione level and antioxidant enzymes activities. Moreover, ISO-induced heart injury was accompained with elevated cardiac NF-\u03baB p65, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, Bax, and caspase-3, as well as decreased Bcl-2, Nrf2, and HO-1. Remarkably, TAX reduced the severity of cardiac injury, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death, while enhancing antioxidants, Bcl-2, and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in ISO-injected mice. In conclusion, TAX protects against ISO-induced acute myocardial injury via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and attenuating the oxidative tissue injury and key regulators of inflammatory response and apoptosis. Thus, our findings imply that TAX may constitute a new cardioprotective therapy against acute MI, which undoubtedly deserves further exploration in upcoming human trials.", "journal": "Biomolecules", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["Heba MObeidat", "Osama YAlthunibat", "Manal AAlfwuaires", "Saleem HAladaileh", "Abdulmohsen IAlgefare", "Afaf FAlmuqati", "FawazAlasmari", "Hammad KhalifehAldal'in", "Abdulkareem AAlanezi", "BaderAlsuwayt", "Mohammad HAbukhalil"], "doi": "10.3390/biom12111546\n10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30318-3\n10.23736/S2724-5683.21.05538-9\n10.7150/thno.60143\n10.15386/mpr-1348\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.08.009\n10.3923/jpt.2011.1.17\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.22.2934\n10.1080/13880209.2019.1649436\n10.3389/fphar.2021.669679\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.120071\n10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112900\n10.1155/2020/9568278\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00068\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101212\n10.1093/jpp/rgab083\n10.1002/ddr.21495\n10.1248/bpb.b20-00783\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112004\n10.1016/j.phytochem.2019.112066\n10.1590/1678-9865202235e210079\n10.3389/fphar.2020.608511\n10.7717/peerj.6383\n10.2147/DDDT.S281369\n10.3390/life12081150\n10.1016/0003-2697(79)90738-3\n10.1016/0003-2697(80)90139-6\n10.1016/S0006-291X(72)80218-3\n10.4132/jptm.2016.08.08\n10.1211/jpp.62.04.0015\n10.1007/BF02912874\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.06.065\n10.1039/C8FO01256C\n10.1016/j.fct.2013.11.013\n10.1093/cvr/21.4.248\n10.1080/14786419.2022.2041632\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.11.014\n10.21037/atm-20-3134\n10.1089/ars.2011.4313\n10.1152/physrev.00029.2006\n10.5620/eaht.2022002\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111660\n10.1080/15569527.2019.1637348\n10.1002/ptr.6152\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.3390/nu11092090\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106508\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000164237.58200.5A\n10.1007/s11033-018-04575-9\n10.1007/s12551-020-00742-0\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.09.051\n10.3390/ijms140510465\n10.1155/2017/9237263\n10.1042/BST20150014\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.005\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.189480\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00662"}

{"title": "Gelatin coating enhances therapeutic cell adhesion to the infarcted myocardium via ECM binding.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) results in weakening of the heart muscle and an increased risk for chronic heart failure. Therapeutic stem cells have been shown to reduce inflammatory signaling and scar tissue expansion, despite most of these studies being limited by poor retention of cells. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) coatings have been shown to increase the retention of these therapeutic cells near the infarct. In this work, we evaluate two different potential binding partners for GelMA-coated bone marrow cells (BMCs) and myocardial tissue: the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interstitial non-cardiomyocytes. While cells containing \u03b21 integrins mediate cell-ECM adhesion in vivo, these cells do not promote binding to our collagen-degraded, GelMA coating. Specifically, microscopic imagining shows that even with high integrin expression, GelMA-coated BMCs do not bind to cells within the myocardium. Alternatively, BMC incubation with decellularized heart tissue results in higher adhesion of coated cells versus uncoated cells supporting our GelMA-ECM binding mode. To further evaluate the ECM binding mode, cells were incubated on slides modified with one of three different major heart ECM components: collagen, laminin, or fibronectin. While all three components promoted higher adhesion than unmodified glass, collagen-coated slides resulted in a significantly higher adhesion of GelMA-coated BMCs over laminin and fibronectin. Incubation with unmodified BMCs confirmed that without a GelMA coating minimal adhesion of BMCs occurred. We conclude that GelMA cellular coatings significantly increase the binding of cells to collagen within the ECM. Our results provide progress towards a biocompatible and easily translatable method to enhance the retention of transplanted cells in human studies.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2022-11-11", "authors": ["Kara ADavis", "AnuhyaGottipatti", "HsuanPeng", "ReneeDonahue", "LakshmanChelvarajan", "CalvinCahall", "HimiTripathi", "AhmedAl-Darraji", "ShaojingYe", "AhmedAbdel-Latif", "Brad JBerron"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0277561\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000485\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.304792\n10.1073/pnas.0903201106\n10.1161/hc0102.101442\n10.1186/s13036-018-0131-6\n10.1007/s12015-018-9870-5\n10.1007/s00441-009-0834-6\n10.1016/j.lfs.2010.07.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223925\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0273\n10.1021/bm700672z\n10.1021/acsabm.0c01473\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.01.002\n10.1172/JCI114957\n10.1016/s0092-8674(02)00971-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.265066\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052209\n10.1002/adfm.201101662\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.04.023\n10.1021/acsabm.9b01198\n10.1007/s11357-017-9959-9\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.07.023\n10.1161/01.RES.0000085580.45279.60"}

We propose an innovative approach aiming to elicit bioelectrical information from the cell membrane using an integrated circuit (IC) bearing a coating of nanowires on the chip surface. Nanowires grow directly on the backend of the ICs, thus allowing on-site amplification of bioelectric signals with uniform and controlled morphology and growth of the NWs on templates. To implement this technology, we evaluated the biocompatibility of silicon and zinc oxide nanowires (NWs), used as a seeding substrate for cells in culture, on two different primary cell lines. Human cardiac stromal cells were used to evaluate the effects of ZnO NWs of different lengths on cell behavior, morphology and growth, while BV-2 microglial-like cells and GH4-C1 neuroendocrine-like cell lines were used to evaluate cell membrane-NW interaction and contact when cultured on Si NWs. As the optimization of the contact between integrated microelectronics circuits and cellular membranes represents a long-standing issue, our technological approach may lay the basis for a new era of devices exploiting the microelectronics' sensitivity and \"smartness\" to both improve investigation of biological systems and to develop suitable NW-based systems available for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-11-11", "authors": ["RobertoGaetani", "YuriyDerevyanchuk", "AndreaNotargiacomo", "MarialiliaPea", "MassimilianoRenzi", "ElisaMessina", "FabrizioPalma"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering9110621\n10.1152/ajpheart.00941.2020\n10.1007/s11886-022-01683-8\n10.1089/ten.teb.2021.0088\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.07.009\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1038/s41596-019-0189-8\n10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00276\n10.1016/j.addr.2019.06.001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.06.036\n10.1002/1439-7641(20020315)3:3<276::AID-CPHC276>3.0.CO;2-A\n10.1038/nnano.2012.8\n10.1109/JSSC.2003.819174\n10.1038/nnano.2012.265\n10.1021/nl900096z\n10.1038/nnano.2011.223\n10.1186/s12951-021-00841-4\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.024\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021119-034527\n10.1038/s41569-018-0077-x\n10.1016/j.mee.2014.04.045\n10.1088/2053-1591/ab20f8\n10.1161/01.RES.0000147315.71699.51\n10.5395/rde.2020.45.e54\n10.3390/ijms21176305\n10.3390/nano7040080\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.05.029\n10.1080/15548627.2021.1911016\n10.1038/srep43661\n10.1021/jp808878p\n10.1038/srep40685\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.07.023\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.12.055\n10.18433/J3GP6G\n10.2147/NSA.S99747\n10.1371/journal.pone.0232729\n10.3390/nano11112922\n10.3727/096368915X689794\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00334\n10.3389/fcell.2020.559032\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.05.028\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.050409\n10.1016/j.nano.2015.03.004\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109770\n10.3390/ma14247610\n10.1038/nnano.2017.3\n10.1002/adfm.202108378\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.01.029"}

H9c2 cells were used to explore the mechanism of complement factor D (CFD) regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\nMyocardial apoptosis were observed in MI rat, and more EAT was found in the MI group in vivo. The conditioned medium prepared by EAT (EAT-CM) significantly reduced the activity of H9c2 cells. The content of CFD in EAT was significantly increased, and CFD promoted cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro and CFD-IN1 (a selective inhibitor of CFD) could revised this effect. CFD induced poly ADP-ribosepolymerase-1 (PARP-1) overactivation. Furthermore, the addition of pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD in the SAT-CM\u00a0+\u00a0CFD group couldn't affect H9c2 cell apoptosis. CFD induced cell apoptosis via PARP-1 activation and PARP-1 inhibitor 3-Aminobenzamide could revise this effect. The injection of CFD-IN1 in MI rat model confirmed that inhibition of CFD activity alleviated cardiomyocytes apoptosis.\nOur findings indicate that EAT mediating cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI through secretion of CFD and activation of PARP-1 activity.", "journal": "Cellular signalling", "date": "2022-11-10", "authors": ["ShuangHao", "JingchaoZhang", "YuPei", "LonghuiGuo", "ZhenxingLiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2022.110518"}

Calsyntenin-1(CLSTN1) plays a critical role in the nervous system, but its relevance in cardiovascular diseases is unknown. We investigated the significance of CLSTN1 in doxorubicin-induced DCM.\nCLSTN1 expression in doxorubicin-induced DCM rats and H9c2 cells was determined using western blotting. To further explore the functions of CLSTN1, a cardiac-specific CLSTN1 overexpression rat model was constructed. The rats were subjected to analysis using echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and electrocardiographic parameters. Potential downstream molecules in CLSTN1 overexpression heart tissue were investigated using proteomics and western blotting. Finally, a knockdown of CLSTN1 was constructed to investigate the rescue function on doxorubicin-induced cell toxicity.\nCLSTN1 protein expression increased drastically in doxorubicin-induced DCM rats and H9c2 cells. Under doxorubicin treatment, CLSTN1 protein-specific overexpression in the heart muscle promoted cardiac chamber enlargement and heart failure, while the knockdown of CLSTN1 reduced doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity in vitro. At the mechanistic level, overexpression of CLSTN1 downregulated SERCA2 expression and increased the phosphorylation levels of PI3K-Akt and CaMK2.\nOur findings demonstrated that CLSTN1 promotes the pathogenesis of doxorubicin-induced DCM.

Mitochondrial dysfunction occurring during sepsis is a vital contributor to the pathogenesis of myocardial damage. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural poly-phenolic compound, has showed cardio-protective and mitochondrial protective effect. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of RA on sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Adult mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of saline (control) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5\u00a0mg/kg) to mimic sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Immediately after LPS challenge, vehicle or RA (100\u2009mg/kg/day) was administrated via gavage. Cardiac function was examined with echocardiographic analyses 12\u2009hours after LPS challenge and cumulative survival of mice was recorded for 8\u2009days. Heart tissues were harvested 12\u2009hours after LPS challenge to perform histological analyses and determine mitochondrial function. We found RA significantly improved cardiac function and survival of LPS-injected mice. Histologically, RA attenuated LPS-mediated cardiomyocyte damage, indicated by decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved myocardial swollen and disarrangement. Moreover, RA attenuated LPS-mediated myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction, indicated by improved mitochondrial ultrastructure, increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), markedly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and alleviated oxidative stress in heart tissues. RA treatment downregulated protein expression of Sirt1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), and Sirt1 inhibition blocked protective effect of RA on LPS-induced myocardial damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Collectively, RA attenuates LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction via activating Sirt1/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway to alleviate mitochondrial impairment.

{"title": "Plasma exosomes generated by ischaemic preconditioning are cardioprotective in a rat heart failure model.", "abstract": "Exosomes released into the plasma after brief cardiac ischaemia mediate subsequent cardioprotection. Whether donor exosomes can provide cardioprotection to recipients with chronic heart failure, which confers the highest perioperative risk, is unknown. We examined whether ischaemic preconditioning (IPC)-induced plasma exosomes exerted cardioprotection after their transfer from normal donors to post-infarcted failing hearts.\nPlasma exosomes were obtained from adult rats after IPC or sham. An exosome inhibitor GW4869 was administrated before IPC in an in\u00a0vivo model of ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in normal rats. The IPC exosomes or control exosomes from normal donor rats were perfused to the normal or post-infarcted failing rat hearts before ischaemia in Langendorff perfusion experiments. Infarct size, cardiac enzymes, cardiac function, and pro-survival kinases were quantified.\nThe IPC stimulus increased the release of exosomes, whereas GW4869 inhibited the rise of plasma exosomes. Pre-treatment with GW4869 reversed IPC-mediated cardioprotection against in\u00a0vivo I/R injury. In the Langendorff perfusion experiments, IPC exosomes from normal donor rats reduced mean infarct size from 41.05 (1.87)% to 31.43 (1.81)% and decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity in the post-infarcted failing rat hearts. IPC exosomes but not control exosomes activated pro-survival kinases in the heart tissues.\nIschaemic preconditioning-induced exosomes from normal rats can restore cardioprotection in heart failure after myocardial infarction, which is associated with activation of pro-survival protein kinases.

{"title": "Embedded 3D printing of dilute particle suspensions into dense complex tissue fibers using shear thinning xanthan baths.", "abstract": "In order to fabricate functional organoids and microtissues, a high cell density is generally required. As such, the placement of cell suspensions in molds or microwells to allow for cell concentration by sedimentation is the current standard for the production of organoids and microtissues. Even though molds offer some level of control over the shape of the resulting microtissue, this control is limited as microtissues tend to compact towards a sphere after sedimentation of the cells. 3D bioprinting on the other hand offers complete control over the shape of the resulting structure. Even though the printing of dense cell suspensions in the ink has been reported, extruding dense cellular suspensions is challenging and generally results in high shear stresses on the cells and a poor shape fidelity of the print. As such, additional materials such as hydrogels are added in the bioink to limit shear stresses, and to improve shape fidelity and resolution. The maximum cell concentration that can be incorporated in a hydrogel-based ink before the ink's rheological properties are compromised, is significantly lower than the concentration in a tissue equivalent. Additionally, the hydrogel components often interfere with cellular self-assembly processes. To circumvent these limitations, we report a simple and inexpensive xanthan bath based embedded printing method to 3D print dense functional linear tissues using dilute particle suspensions consisting of cells, spheroids, hydrogel beads, or combinations thereof. Using this method, we demonstrated the self-organization of functional cardiac tissue fibers with a layer of epicardial cells surrounding a body of cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2022-11-09", "authors": ["Vasileios DTrikalitis", "Niels J JKroese", "MertKaya", "CarlaCofi\u00f1o-Fabres", "SimoneTen Den", "Islam S MKhalil", "SarthakMisra", "Bart F J MKoopman", "RobertPassier", "VerenaSchwach", "JeroenRouwkema"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aca124"}
{"title": "Origins and Evolution of Human Tandem Duplicated Exon Substitution Events.", "abstract": "The mutually exclusive splicing of tandem duplicated exons produces protein isoforms that are identical save for a homologous region that allows for the fine tuning of protein function. Tandem duplicated exon substitution events are rare, yet highly important alternative splicing events. Most events are ancient, their isoforms are highly expressed, and they have significantly more pathogenic mutations than other splice events. Here, we analyzed the physicochemical properties and functional roles of the homologous polypeptide regions produced by the 236 tandem duplicated exon substitutions annotated in the human gene set. We find that the most important structural and functional residues in these homologous regions are maintained, and that most changes are conservative rather than drastic. Three quarters of the isoforms produced from tandem duplicated exon substitution events are tissue-specific, particularly in nervous and cardiac tissues, and tandem duplicated exon substitution events are enriched in functional terms related to structures in the brain and skeletal muscle. We find considerable evidence for the convergent evolution of tandem duplicated exon substitution events in vertebrates, arthropods, and nematodes. Twelve human gene families have orthologues with tandem duplicated exon substitution events in both Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Six of these gene families are ion transporters, suggesting that tandem exon duplication in genes that control the flow of ions into the cell has an adaptive benefit. The ancient origins, the strong indications of tissue-specific functions, and the evidence of convergent evolution suggest that these events may have played important roles in the evolution of animal tissues and organs.", "journal": "Genome biology and evolution", "date": "2022-11-09", "authors": ["LauraMartinez-Gomez", "DanielCerd\u00e1n-V\u00e9lez", "FedericoAbascal", "Michael LTress"], "doi": "10.1093/gbe/evac162\n10.1038/s41580-022-00545-z"}

Previous studies have shown that neural component contributes to arterial hypertension etiology, maintenance, and progression and leads to brain damage, peripheral neuropathy, and remodeling of intrinsic cardiac neural plexus. Recently, significant structural changes of the intracardiac neural plexus were demonstrated in young prehypertensive and adult hypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), yet structural alterations of intracardiac neural plexus that occur in the aged SHR remain undetermined. Thus, we analyzed the impact of uncontrolled arterial hypertension in old (48-52\u2009weeks) SHR and the age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Intrinsic cardiac neural plexus was examined using a combination of immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy in cardiac sections and whole-mount preparations. Our findings demonstrate that structural changes of intrinsic cardiac neural plexus caused by arterial hypertension are heterogeneous and may support recent physiological implications about cardiac denervation occurring together with the hyperinnervation of the SHR heart. We conclude that arterial hypertension leads to (i) the decrease of the neuronal body area, the thickness of atrial nerves, the number of myelinated nerve fibers, unmyelinated axon area and cumulative axon area in the nerve, and the density of myocardial nerve fibers, and (ii) the increase in myelinated nerve fiber area and density of neuronal bodies within epicardiac ganglia. Despite neuropathic alterations of myelinated fibers were exposed within intracardiac nerves of both groups, SHR and WKY, we consider that the determined significant changes in structure of intrinsic cardiac neural plexus were predisposed by arterial hypertension.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2022-11-08", "authors": ["NeringaPauziene", "DaliaRanceviene", "KristinaRysevaite-Kyguoliene", "HermanasInokaitis", "IngaSaburkina", "KhrystynaPlekhanova", "DeimanteSabeckiene", "IgnasSabeckis", "RugileMartinaityte", "ErnestaPilnikovaite", "Dainius HPauza"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.25109"}

However, in pathologic conditions, the epicardial adipose tissue can present a potent cardiac risk factor that is capable of impairing heart function through several pathways, increasing the risk of dysrhythmia and creating an inflammatory milieu around the heart tissues. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are a relatively newly introduced class of antidiabetes drugs which effectively normalize blood glucose via overt glycosuria. Some recent reports suggest that these drugs are able to modulate epicardial adiposity and decrease the risk of cardiac complications in diabetic patients who are at higher risk of epicardial adiposity-dependent cardiac disorders. If proven to be true, these antidiabetic drugs can provide dual benefits as both hypoglycemic agents and as epicardial adiposity normalizing agents, thus providing cardiac benefits.

{"title": "Systematic dissection, preservation, and multiomics in whole human and bovine hearts.", "abstract": "We sought to develop a rigorous, systematic protocol for the dissection and preservation of human hearts for biobanking that expands previous success in postmortem transcriptomics to multiomics from paired tissue.\nExisting cardiac biobanks consist largely of biopsy tissue or explanted hearts in select diseases and are insufficient for correlating whole organ phenotype with clinical data.\nWe demonstrate optimal conditions for multiomics interrogation (ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, untargeted metabolomics) in hearts by evaluating the effect of technical variables (storage solution, temperature) and simulated postmortem interval (PMI) on RNA and metabolite stability. We used bovine (n=3) and human (n=2) hearts fixed in PAXgene or snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen.\nUsing a paired Wald test, only two of the genes assessed were differentially expressed between left ventricular samples from bovine hearts stored in PAXgene at 0 and 12 hours PMI (FDR q<0.05). We obtained similar findings in human left ventricular samples, suggesting stability of RNA transcripts at PMIs up to 12 hours. Different library preparation methods (mRNA poly-A capture vs. rRNA depletion) resulted in similar quality metrics with both library preparations achieving >95% of reads properly aligning to the reference genomes across all PMIs for bovine and human hearts. PMI had no effect on RNA Integrity Number or quantity of RNA recovered at the time points evaluated. Of the metabolites identified (855 total) using untargeted metabolomics of human left ventricular tissue, 503 metabolites remained stable across PMIs (0, 4, 8, 12 hours). Most metabolic pathways retained several stable metabolites.\nOur data demonstrate a technically rigorous, reproducible protocol that will enhance cardiac biobanking practices and facilitate novel insights into human CVD.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Current biobanking practices insufficiently capture both the diverse array of phenotypes present in CVDs and the spatial heterogeneity across cardiac tissue sites.

Ferroptosis plays a key role in DOX-induced cardiac damage and cardiomyocyte cell death. The inhibition of ferroptosis reverses DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). LCZ696, a first-in-class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, protects against DIC. However, the mechanism of action of LCZ696, especially its effect on ferroptosis, is incompletely understood. This study investigates the cardioprotective effects of LCZ696 on DIC in vivo and in vitro.Cardiotoxicity was induced in Wistar rats by tail intravenous injection of 2.5\u00a0mg/kg DOX once a week for six weeks. Rats and H9c2 cells were treated with or without LCZ696 to determine the cardioprotective role and underlying mechanisms of LCZ696 against DIC. To assess the role of SIRT3 and correlated pathways in ferroptosis, SIRT3 knockout was performed using lentiviral vectors, and AKT was inhibited with LY294002. LCZ696 significantly attenuated DIC by decreasing the concentrations of lipid reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde and increasing the levels of glutathione peroxidase-4 and reduced glutathione in cells and heart tissues. Moreover, LCZ696 remodeled myocardial structures and improved heart ventricular function in DOX-treated rats. LCZ696 treatment increased SIRT3 expression and deacetylated its target gene SOD2, and these changes were mediated by AKT activation. SIRT3 knockdown and AKT inhibition induced lipid peroxidation and reduced the protective effect of LCZ696 in H9c2 cells. Collectively,LCZ696 prevents DIC by inhibiting ferroptosis via AKT/SIRT3/SOD2 signaling pathway activation. Thus, LZC696 is a potential therapeutic strategy for DIC.", "journal": "International immunopharmacology", "date": "2022-11-05", "authors": ["XiaomanLiu", "DanleiLi", "WenhuPi", "BinWang", "ShashaXu", "LeiYu", "LeiYao", "ZhenzhuSun", "JianjunJiang", "YafeiMi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109379"}

MIRI severity varies along the day-night cycle and is molecularly linked to components of the cellular clock including the nuclear receptor REV-ERB\u03b1, a transcriptional repressor. Here we show that digoxin administration in mice is cardioprotective when timed to trigger REV-ERB\u03b1 protein degradation. In cardiomyocytes, digoxin increases REV-ERB\u03b1 ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation, which depend on REV-ERB\u03b1 ability to bind its natural ligand, heme. Inhibition of the membrane-bound Src tyrosine-kinase partially alleviated digoxin-induced REV-ERB\u03b1 degradation. In untreated cardiomyocytes, REV-ERB\u03b1 proteolysis is controlled by known (HUWE1, FBXW7, SIAH2) or novel (CBL, UBE4B) E3 ubiquitin ligases and the proteasome subunit PSMB5. Only SIAH2 and PSMB5 contributed to digoxin-induced degradation of REV-ERB\u03b1. Thus, controlling REV-ERB\u03b1 proteostasis through the ubiquitin-proteasome system is an appealing cardioprotective strategy.

{"title": "Cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were attenuated by olive leaf extract treatment in a rat model of diabetes.", "abstract": "The key role of fibrosis and hypertrophy processes in developing diabetes-induced heart injury has been demonstrated. Considering the known hypoglycemic effects of olive leaf extract (OLE), we decided to investigate its potential effect and associated mechanisms on cardiac fibrosis and myocardial hypertrophy in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Eight groups were included in this study: control, diabetic, diabetic-OLEs (100, 200 and 400\u2009mg/kg), diabetic-metformin (300\u2009mg/kg), diabetic-valsartan (30\u2009mg/kg), and diabetic-metformin/valsartan (300/30\u2009mg/kg). After a treatment period of 6\u2009weeks, echocardiography was used to assess cardiac function. Heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) were measured. Myocardial histology was examined by Masson's trichrome staining. Gene expressions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MHC), TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b23, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and collagen were evaluated by the quantitative real-time PCR in heart tissue. A reduction in the FBS level and HW/BW ratio in the extract groups was obvious. The improvement of left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac myocytes hypertrophy, and myocardial interstitial fibrosis was also observed in treated groups. A lowering trend in the expression of all hypertrophic and fibrotic indicator genes was evident in the myocardium of OLE treated rats. Our data indicated that OLE could attenuate fibrosis and reduce myocardial hypertrophy markers, thus improving the cardiac function and structure in the STZ-induced diabetic rats. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that olive leaf extract in addition to lowering blood glucose levels and the heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) may also improve cardiac function and reduce cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in cardiac tissue, which leads to inhibition of diabetic heart damage. Thus it is possible that including olive leaf extracts in the diets of individuals with diabetes may assist in lowering cardiovascular disease risk factors.", "journal": "Journal of food biochemistry", "date": "2022-11-03", "authors": ["Ali AkbarAsghari", "MaryamMahmoudabady", "ZahraMousavi Emadi", "Seyed JavadHosseini", "HosseinSalmani"], "doi": "10.1111/jfbc.14494"}

{"title": "RNA-Binding Protein LIN28a Regulates New Myocyte Formation in the Heart Through Long Noncoding RNA-H19.", "abstract": "Developmental cardiac tissue holds remarkable capacity to regenerate after injury and consists of regenerative mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes. On maturation, mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes become binucleated or polyploid and exit the cell cycle. Cardiomyocyte metabolism undergoes a profound shift that coincides with cessation of regeneration in the postnatal heart. However, whether reprogramming metabolism promotes persistence of regenerative mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes enhancing cardiac function and repair after injury is unknown. Here, we identify a novel role for RNA-binding protein LIN28a, a master regulator of cellular metabolism in cardiac repair after injury.\nLIN28a overexpression was tested using mouse transgenesis on postnatal cardiomyocyte numbers, cell cycle, and response to apical resection injury. With the use of neonatal and adult cell culture systems and adult and Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers myocardial injury models in mice, the effect of LIN28a overexpression on cardiomyocyte cell cycle and metabolism was tested. Last, isolated adult cardiomyocytes from LIN28a and wild-type mice 4 days after myocardial injury were used for RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing.\nLIN28a was found to be active primarily during cardiac development and rapidly decreases after birth. LIN28a reintroduction at postnatal day (P) 1, P3, P5, and P7 decreased maturation-associated polyploidization, nucleation, and cell size, enhancing cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in LIN28a transgenic pups compared with wild-type littermates. Moreover, LIN28a overexpression extended cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity beyond P7 concurrent with increased cardiac function 30 days after apical resection. In the adult heart, LIN28a overexpression attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, enhanced cell cycle activity, cardiac function, and survival in mice 12 weeks after myocardial infarction compared with wild-type littermate controls. Instead, LIN28a small molecule inhibitor attenuated the proreparative effects of LIN28a on the heart. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing LIN28a mechanistically showed increased glycolysis, ATP production, and levels of metabolic enzymes compared with control. LIN28a immunoprecipitation followed by RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing in cardiomyocytes isolated from LIN28a-overexpressing hearts after injury identified long noncoding RNA-H19 as its most significantly altered target. Ablation of long noncoding RNA-H19 blunted LIN28a-induced enhancement on cardiomyocyte metabolism and cell cycle activity.\nCollectively, LIN28a reprograms cardiomyocyte metabolism and promotes persistence of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes in the injured heart, enhancing proreparative processes, thereby linking cardiomyocyte metabolism to regulation of ploidy/nucleation and repair in the heart.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2022-11-01", "authors": ["Vagner Oliveira CarvalhoRigaud", "Robert CHoy", "JustinKurian", "ClareZarka", "MichaelBehanan", "IsabellaBrosious", "JenniferPennise", "TejPatel", "TaoWang", "JaslynJohnson", "Lindsay MKraus", "SadiaMohsin", "Steven RHouser", "MohsinKhan"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.059346\n10.1038/s41598-017-15656-3\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.032\n10.1126/science.aar2038\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043067\n10.15252/embr.201949752\n10.7554/eLife.50163\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.12.017\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0163\n10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.5.H2183\n10.1073/pnas.1214608110\n10.1038/ng.3929\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1161/01.RES.0000259560.39234.99\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314223\n10.1002/stem.591\n10.1126/science.1154040\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.059\n10.1021/acschembio.6b00232\n10.1186/s12943-017-0699-3\n10.1038/onc.2017.368\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.014\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.102162\n10.1126/science.6494891\n10.1038/ng.593\n10.7150/thno.47354\n10.7554/eLife.53071\n10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4\n10.3389/fcell.2021.645276\n10.3390/cells9051144\n10.1038/s41586-018-0590-4\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.11.006\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.033\n10.15252/embr.201949752\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa519"}

As a member of the Rab family, Rab10 has multiple subcellular localizations and carries out a wide variety of functions. Here, we explored the role of Rab10 on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiac-specific Rab10 transgenic mice were constructed and treated with DOX or saline. We found that cardiac-specific overexpression of Rab10 alleviated cardiac dysfunction and attenuated cytoplasmic vacuolization and mitochondrial damage in DOX-treated mouse heart tissues. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis showed that Rab10 alleviated DOX-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes in mouse heart tissues. We demonstrated that DOX mediated apoptosis, oxidative stress and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential in H9c2 cells, while overexpression and knockdown of Rab10 attenuated and aggravated these effects, respectively. Furthermore, we found that Mst1, a serine-threonine kinase, was cleaved and translocated into the nucleus in H9c2 cells after DOX treatment, and knockdown of Mst1 alleviated DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Overexpression of Rab10 inhibited the cleavage of Mst1 mediated by DOX treatment in vivo and in vitro. Together, our findings demonstrated that cardiac-specific overexpression of Rab10 alleviated DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction and injury via inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, which may be partially ascribed to the inhibition of Mst1 activity.", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2022-10-30", "authors": ["ChenZhang", "QinghuaDan", "SongLai", "YutongZhang", "ErerGao", "HaiyanLuo", "LipingYang", "XiaoboGao", "CailingLu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxlet.2022.10.005"}

Accumulating evidence reveals the essential roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of AVMC. Here, we aimed to evaluate the biological functions of a novel lncRNA guanylate-binding protein 9 (lncGBP9) in AVMC progression and further explore its underlying mechanisms.\nInitially, mouse models of AVMC were constructed by CVB3 infection. The expression and localization of lncGBP9 in heart tissues were analyzed using RT-qPCR and FISH. Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated lncGBP9 knockdown was then employed to clarify its roles in survival, cardiac function, and myocardial inflammation and apoptosis. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2) were detected by RT-qPCR and ELISA, and the regulation of lncGBP9 knockdown on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was investigated by Western blotting. Using an in vitro model of HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to CVB3 infection, the effects of lncGBP9 knockdown on cell viability, inflammation, and apoptosis were further evaluated in vitro.\nIncreased lncGBP9 expression was detected in the heart tissues of AVMC mice and CVB3-infected HL-1 cells, and was mainly located in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of lncGBP9 remarkably alleviated the severity of AVMC in CVB3-infected mice, as verified by improved cardiac function, and reduced myocardial inflammation and apoptosis. Additionally, lncGBP9 knockdown suppressed the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and consequently reduced productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo. In vitro functional assays further confirmed that lncGBP9 knockdown promoted cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines release in CVB3-infected HL-1 cells through suppressing NF-\u03baB activation.\nCollectively, lncGBP9 knockdown exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in CVB3-induced AVMC, which may be mediated in part via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

{"title": "HIV-1 Tat Upregulates the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products and Superoxide Dismutase-2 in the Heart of Transgenic Mice.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disorder (CVD) is a common comorbidity in people living with HIV (PLWH). Although the underlying mechanisms are unknown, virotoxic HIV proteins, such as the trans-activator of transcription (Tat), likely contribute to CVD pathogenesis. Tat expression in mouse myocardium has been found to induce cardiac dysfunction and increase markers of endothelial toxicity. However, the role that Tat may play in the development of CVD pathogenesis is unclear. The capacity for Tat to impact cardiac function was assessed using AC16 human cardiomyocyte cells and adult male and female transgenic mice that conditionally expressed Tat [Tat(+)], or did not [Tat(-)]. In AC16 cardiomyocytes, Tat increased intracellular calcium. In Tat(+) mice, Tat expression was detected in both atrial and ventricular heart tissue. Tat(+) mice demonstrated an increased expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2) in ventricular tissues compared to Tat(-) controls. No changes in SOD-1 or \u03b1-smooth muscle actin were observed. Despite Tat-mediated changes at the cellular level, no changes in echocardiographic measures were detected. Tat(+) mice had a greater proportion of ventricular mast cells and collagen; however, doxycycline exposure offset the latter effect.

Sodium/hydrogen exchanger (NHE) has been proposed as the mechanism of action, but there are controversies related to its function and expression in heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that sodium transported-related molecules could be altered in HF and modulated through SGLT2i. Transcriptome alterations in genes involved in sodium transport in HF were investigated in human heart samples by RNA-sequencing.

This study investigates a novel IRE protocol with high-frequency pulsed electric field (HF-PEF) of 500 Hz repetition to ablate the prostate tissue in beagles for treatment of prostate cancer. A finite element analysis was performed to validate optimal electrical field strength for the procedure. In total, 12 beagles received HF-PEF of 500 Hz and were sacrificed at 4 h, 4 days, and 28 days (3 each). The remaining three beagles underwent sham procedure. The outcomes of HF-PEF were assessed by histological responses. HF-PEF successfully decellularized the prostate tissues 4 h after the treatment. The prostate glands, duct, and urethra were well preserved after IRE with HF-PEF. The ablated prostatic tissues were gradually regenerated and appeared similar to the original tissues 28 d after IRE with HF-PEF. Moreover, electrocardiography and hematology demonstrated that IRE with HF-PEF did not seriously affect the cardiac tissue.

{"title": "A Systematic Review of miRNA and cfDNA as Potential Biomarkers for Liquid Biopsy in Myocarditis and Inflammatory Dilated Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Myocarditis and inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy are cardiac diseases leading to heart failure. Liquid biopsy is a concept of replacing traditional biopsy with specialized blood tests. The study aim was to summarize and assess the usefulness of microRNAs and circulating free DNA as biomarkers of myocardial inflammation. For this systematic review, we searched Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed. All studies measuring microRNAs in serum/plasma/cardiac tissue or circulating free DNA during myocarditis and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in humans in which healthy subjects or another cardiac disease served as a comparator were included. Data were extracted and miRNAs were screened and assessed using a scale created in-house. Then, highly graded miRNAs were assessed for usability as liquid biopsy biomarkers. Of 1185 records identified, 56 were eligible and 187 miRNAs were found. We did not identify any studies measuring circulating free DNA. In total, 24 of the screened miRNAs were included in the final assessment, 3 of which were selected as the best and 3 as potential candidates.

This study assessed whether a muscadine grape skin/seed extract supplement (MGES) prevents hypertension-induced cardiac damage and oxidative stress. Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated for four weeks with drinking water, angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce hypertension, MGES, or both Ang II and MGES. Cardiac function assessed by echocardiography showed that Ang II increased systolic blood pressure while MGES alone or in combination with Ang II had no effect. Ang II increased E/e', an indicator of left ventricular filling pressure and diastolic dysfunction, by 41% compared to Control and co-treatment with MGES prevented the Ang II-mediated increase, suggesting that the extract attenuated hypertension-induced diastolic function. Ang II infusion increased urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and cardiac 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde, which were prevented by the extract. The antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase 1 activity and mRNA were increased significantly in animals treated with MGES alone or in combination with Ang II, suggesting that the extract upregulates oxidative stress defense mechanisms in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Engineering Spatiotemporal Control in Vascularized Tissues.", "abstract": "A major challenge in engineering scalable three-dimensional tissues is the generation of a functional and developed microvascular network for adequate perfusion of oxygen and growth factors. Current biological approaches to creating vascularized tissues include the use of vascular cells, soluble factors, and instructive biomaterials. Angiogenesis and the subsequent generation of a functional vascular bed within engineered tissues has gained attention and is actively being studied through combinations of physical and chemical signals, specifically through the presentation of topographical growth factor signals. The spatiotemporal control of angiogenic signals can generate vascular networks in large and dense engineered tissues. This review highlights the developments and studies in the spatiotemporal control of these biological approaches through the coordinated orchestration of angiogenic factors, differentiation of vascular cells, and microfabrication of complex vascular networks. Fabrication strategies to achieve spatiotemporal control of vascularization involves the incorporation or encapsulation of growth factors, topographical engineering approaches, and 3D bioprinting techniques. In this article, we highlight the vascularization of engineered tissues, with a focus on vascularized cardiac patches that are clinically scalable for myocardial repair. Finally, we discuss the present challenges for successful clinical translation of engineered tissues and biomaterials.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["AsthaKhanna", "Beu POropeza", "Ngan FHuang"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering9100555\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000001052\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.933060\n10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9\n10.1002/term.3225\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00188\n10.1002/stem.2846\n10.1007/s10456-021-09824-3\n10.3390/cells11030587\n10.3390/cells9112467\n10.1093/rb/rbz003\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.01.017\n10.4414/smw.2019.20011\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00552\n10.1016/j.cyto.2017.03.004\n10.1097/BCR.0b013e3181c7ed82\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.12.022\n10.1161/01.ATV.17.4.605\n10.1063/5.0044027\n10.1074/jbc.M114.634154\n10.1089/ten.teb.2017.0127\n10.1186/s13287-021-02349-y\n10.1089/scd.2021.0006\n10.3390/cells10061338\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00469\n10.4155/tde.12.50\n10.1016/j.reth.2020.10.002\n10.1038/am.2017.171\n10.3389/fbioe.2015.00045\n10.1098/rsif.2015.0254\n10.3390/bioengineering9010037\n10.3390/ijms22041843\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.07.050\n10.1080/09205063.2017.1354672\n10.1080/09205063.2022.2069398\n10.3390/ph15020190\n10.1080/17425247.2017.1297794\n10.1177/2041731415624668\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.05.001\n10.1016/j.reth.2021.05.006\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab402c\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab2b4d\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.031\n10.5758/vsi.2019.35.2.77\n10.1038/s41598-018-29968-5\n10.1088/1758-5082/2/1/014111\n10.2217/nnm.10.12\n10.22203/eCM.v033a05\n10.1007/s10856-012-4684-5\n10.1007/s10856-019-6230-1\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.003\n10.1115/1.4031230\n10.1002/jbm.b.33768\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.034\n10.1002/bit.25493\n10.1088/1758-5090/aaf7c7\n10.1021/acsabm.8b00230\n10.18063/ijb.v5i2.202\n10.1073/pnas.1521342113\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.1002/adma.201305506\n10.1002/adhm.201600505\n10.1002/adhm.201801019\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045008\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.664188\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.03.036\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119734\n10.1021/acsami.8b17410\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab7e76\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.071\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.042\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00593\n10.3390/molecules24050834\n10.3389/fbioe.2017.00040\n10.1007/s12195-017-0502-y\n10.1039/C7BM00323D\n10.1016/j.msec.2018.12.011\n10.1039/C6RA26931A\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.07.002\n10.3390/pharmaceutics13060779\n10.1007/s00441-013-1781-9\n10.1002/jbm.a.35843\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.11.018\n10.1038/nprot.2009.234\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0584\n10.1073/pnas.1217796110\n10.3389/fbioe.2016.00045\n10.3390/nano10081609\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041163\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.002\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.01.017\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.04.017\n10.3390/jcdd8110137\n10.1002/jbm.b.34197\n10.1002/slct.201903981\n10.1177/2041731420942903\n10.1002/adhm.201801044\n10.1038/s41536-021-00133-3\n10.2217/rme-2016-0132\n10.1089/ten.2006.0096\n10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00423\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034106\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.05.004\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00147\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.230938\n10.1093/cvr/cvs315\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00651\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.097\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00126\n10.1089/ten.teb.2019.0252\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.006\n10.1016/j.mser.2017.07.001\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.621781\n10.1186/scrt156\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120204\n10.1016/j.bprint.2019.e00050\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316155\n10.1186/s40824-018-0122-1\n10.1063/5.0030353\n10.1002/adfm.201700798\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00208\n10.1002/adhm.201500168\n10.1002/term.1944\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00027\n10.3390/ma12172701\n10.1002/anie.202105404\n10.1016/j.stem.2018.02.009\n10.3390/polym12081717\n10.1093/cvr/cvz010"}

Vagal nerve stimulation can reduce myocardial injury in sepsis and improve survival rates. However, the potential impact of low-level tragus stimulation and disparate cell populations on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction remains undetermined.\nA cardiac single-cell transcriptomic approach was used for characterizing cardiac cell populations that form the heart. Single-cell mRNA sequencing data were used for selecting all cardiac macrophages from CD45\nUsing single-cell mRNA sequencing data, we uncovered the multiple cell populations contributing to myocardial injury in sepsis under low-level tragus stimulation, thereby illustrating a comprehensive map of the cardiac cellular landscape. Pseudotiming analysis in single-cell sequencing showed that low-level vagal nerve stimulation played an anti-inflammatory role by promoting cardiac monocytes into M2 macrophages, which significantly increased \nLow-level tragus stimulation could improve sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction by promoting cardiac monocytes to M2 macrophages.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2022-10-27", "authors": ["YufanYang", "LonglongXie", "YinghuiPeng", "HaipengYan", "JiaotianHuang", "ZhenghuiXiao", "XiulanLu"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/3327583\n10.1016/j.chest.2018.08.1037\n10.1590/1678-4685-gmb-2020-0009\n10.1038/nrd1797\n10.1111/epi.13678\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001564\n10.1016/j.jcin.2017.04.036\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002\n10.1093/nar/gku555\n10.1016/j.smim.2015.01.002\n10.1093/cvr/cvz336\n10.1038/nprot.2008.214\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.11.019\n10.1002/advs.202103675\n10.1016/j.jacep.2017.02.019\n10.1113/EP087351\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.01084\n10.1002/phy2.189\n10.3390/biomedicines9091150\n10.1038/s41598-019-41698-w\n10.1155/2012/786839\n10.1007/BF00317941\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.01.004\n10.1054/jpai.2003.434\n10.1016/j.autneu.2007.10.003"}
{"title": "Danlou Tablet May Alleviate Vascular Injury Caused by Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia through Regulating FIH-1, HIF-1, and Angptl4.", "abstract": "Danlou tablet (DLT), the traditional Chinese medicine has been commonly used for dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease. Whether it was effective against vascular injury caused by CIH has remained unknown. The aim of the current study was to observe the effects of DLT on chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)-induced vascular injury via regulation of blood lipids and to explore potential mechanisms.\nSixteen 12-week-old male ApoE\nCIH exposure increases serum lipid levels, decreases serum LPL activity, and exacerbates atherosclerosis. Both Angptl4-ab and DLT treatment reversed the changes in lipid concentration, LPL activity, and atherosclerosis caused by CIH. In the epididymal fat pad, CIH exposure decreased the expression of FIH-1 and increased the expression of HIF-1, whereas DLT treatment increased the expression of FIH-1 and LPL and inhibited the expression of HIF-1 and Angptl4. In heart tissue, the expression levels of LPL and Angptl4 were not affected by modeling or treatment.\nDLT improved vascular damage by improving the increase in blood lipids induced by CIH, potentially by upregulating FIH-1 and downregulating HIF-1 and Angptl4 in adipose tissue. Therefore, DLT may be a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of CIH-induced vascular injury.", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "date": "2022-10-27", "authors": ["YiRong", "QianWu", "JingjingTang", "ZhiguoLiu", "QianyuLv", "XuejiaoYe", "YuDong", "YueboZhang", "GuangxiLi", "ShihanWang"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/4463108\n10.1007/s00408-021-00426-w\n10.1183/13993003.00959-2019\n10.1111/imm.13379\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2020.08.006\n10.1155/2022/1438470\n10.3389/fcimb.2021.560201\n10.1007/s11655-020-3255-8\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000770\n10.1016/S2352-4642(19)30402-X\n10.1126/science.1411543\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.07.024\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr097\n10.1164/rccm.201209-1688OC\n10.1194/jlr.M034272\n10.1002/jgm.1318\n10.1016/j.mvr.2017.12.002\n10.3390/ijerph2005010010\n10.1096/fj.14-252379\n10.18632/oncotarget.27780\n10.3389/fendo.2017.00080\n10.3892/ol.2015.4011\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.151894\n10.1155/2016/7960503\n10.1097/md.0000000000023416\n10.1080/02713683.2017.1355467\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.217380\n10.1073/pnas.0705041104\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.10.017\n10.1007/s00405-022-07382-y\n10.3389/fphar.2021.730525\n10.1016/j.jep.2020.113158\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00590\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.301698\n10.1056/NEJMoa1510926\n10.1016/j.metabol.2008.06.016\n10.1253/circj.CJ-18-0442\n10.1096/fj.10-162230\n10.1002/hep.24479\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.022\n10.1038/ki.2010.284\n10.1101/gad.239681.114\n10.1038/srep12495\n10.3390/cells8050384\n10.1152/ajpgi.00293.2012\n10.1038/pr.2012.76\n10.2174/1573403x12666160126115317\n10.1007/s12026-015-8703-8\n10.1139/H07-083\n10.1161/01.RES.0000256090.42690.05\n10.1007/s11325-012-0760-9\n10.1186/s13063-016-1419-9\n10.1159/000453151\n10.1371/journal.pone.0173984"}
{"title": "Passive and Flexible Wireless Electronics Fabricated on Parylene/PDMS Substrate for Stimulation of Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "In this paper, we report the development of a wireless, passive, biocompatible, and flexible system for stimulation of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMS). Fabricated on a transparent parylene/PDMS substrate, the proposed stimulator enables real-time excitation and characterization of hiPSC-CMs cultured on-board. The device comprises a rectenna operating at 2.35 GHz which receives radio frequency (RF) energy from an external transmitter and converts it into DC voltage to deliver monophasic stimulation. The operation of the stimulator was primarily verified by delivering monophasic voltage pulses through gold electrodes to hiPSC-CMs cultured on the Matrigel-coated substrates. Stimulated hiPSC-CMs beat in accordance with the monophasic pulses when delivered at 0.5, 1, and 2 Hz pulsing frequency, while no significant cell death was observed. The wireless stimulator could generate monophasic pulses with an amplitude of 8 V at a distance of 15 mm. These results demonstrated the proposed wireless stimulator's efficacy for providing electrical stimulation to engineered cardiac tissues. The proposed stimulator will have a wide application in tissue engineering where a fully wireless stimulation of electroconductive cells is needed. The device also has potential to be employed as a cardiac stimulator by delivering external stimulation and regulating the contractions of cardiac tissue.", "journal": "ACS sensors", "date": "2022-10-26", "authors": ["Ahmed AbedBenbuk", "HamidEsmaeili", "ShiyiLiu", "AlejandraPatino-Guerrero", "Raymond QMigrino", "JunseokChae", "MehdiNikkhah", "JenniferBlain Christen"], "doi": "10.1021/acssensors.2c00794\n10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2018.04.002\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht511\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.12.014\n10.1016/S0022-0736(70)80059-0\n10.1186/s12872-018-0849-6\n10.1111/pace.13522\n10.1177/2041731412455354\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1186/s13036-019-0155-6\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1038/s41467-019-13637-w\n10.1038/s41587-021-00948-x\n10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2396574\n10.1109/TBCAS.2021.3097058\n10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2802443\n10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2852680\n10.1109/TMTT.2021.3065560\n10.1109/TMTT.2020.2965938\n10.1021/acssensors.7b00279\n10.1371/journal.pone.0186698\n10.1109/TAP.2019.2927879\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3032848\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2477403\n10.1109/TAP.2018.2874681\n10.1109/LAWP.2017.2732460\n10.1155/2018/4095765\n10.3390/app8020213\n10.1109/LAWP.2016.2598729\n10.1007/s11277-021-09095-7\n10.1016/j.aeue.2020.153455\n10.12693/APhysPolA.135.938\n10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2799623\n10.1038/s41598-018-24465-1\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.110682\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c01141\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1109/ISABEL.2008.4712623\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120195\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121336\n10.1016/S0022-0728(84)80324-1\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.003638\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.08.031\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.05.027\n10.1039/D0TB01528H\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.11.026\n10.1093/europace/eup328\n10.1109/LAWP.2018.2874099\n10.3390/s130607546"}
{"title": "Hydrogen sulfide protects against ischemic heart failure by inhibiting RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to explore whether hydrogen sulfide (H2S) protects against ischemic heart failure (HF) by inhibiting the necroptosis pathway. Mice were randomized into Sham, myocardial infarction (MI), MI + propargylglycine (PAG) and MI + sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) group, respectively. The MI model was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. PAG was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, and NaHS at a dose of 4 mg/kg/day for the same period. At 4 weeks after MI, the following were observed: A significant decrease in the cardiac function, as evidenced by a decline in ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS); an increase in plasma myocardial injury markers, such as creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (cTNI); an increase in myocardial collagen content in the heart tissues; and a decrease of H2S level in plasma and heart tissues. Furthermore, the expression levels of necroptosis-related markers such as receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) were upregulated after MI. NaHS treatment increased H2S levels in plasma and heart tissues, preserving the cardiac function by increasing EF and FS, decreasing plasma CK-MB and cTNI and reducing collagen content. Additionally, NaHS treatment significantly downregulated the RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway. While, PAG treatment aggravated cardiac function by activated the RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway. Overall, the present study concluded that H2S protected against ischemic HF by inhibiting RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis which could be a potential target treatment for ischemic HF.", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2022-10-26", "authors": ["FMa", "YZhu", "LChang", "JGong", "YLuo", "JDai", "HLu"], "doi": "10.33549/physiolres.934905\n10.1007/s11897-012-0107-7\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.10.045\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315806\n10.1080/10715762.2020.1862827\n10.1089/ars.2011.4349\n10.3390/antiox10020247\n10.1155/2021/8841575\n10.1002/cphy.c160023\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.920991\n10.1038/srep22363\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003551\n10.1152/ajpheart.00004.2019\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.313640\n10.1111/apha.13541\n10.1038/s41419-020-02770-w\n10.1093/cvr/cvu146\n10.1186/s12967-017-1189-5\n10.1111/eci.12391\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044914\n10.1038/srep46278\n10.1016/j.pathophys.2018.04.003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00131.2018\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.582239\n10.1038/s41440-018-0185-3\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.009480\n10.1042/BSR20140185\n10.1016/j.niox.2017.04.010\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.01.011\n10.1089/ars.2015.6577\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.11.020\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00598\n10.1016/j.phrs.2016.06.028\n10.1152/ajpheart.00259.2019\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2019.10.012\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.04.010\n10.1111/jcmm.14536\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.026240\n10.1016/j.bcp.2020.113915\n10.1007/s00395-012-0270-8\n10.1155/2019/6173685\n10.3892/ijmm.2017.3330\n10.1155/2019/8061823"}

{"title": "Metal accumulation in juvenile and sub-adult loggerhead and green turtles in northern Cyprus.", "abstract": "Sea turtles are considered pollution bioindicators due to their tendency to accumulate high metal levels in their tissues during their long lifespans. In this context, we aimed to analyse the concentrations of 12 elements in liver, kidney, heart and muscle samples from green turtles (Chelonia mydas; n\u00a0=\u00a041) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta; n\u00a0=\u00a014) found stranded in Northern Cyprus. The samples were collected between 2019 and 2021, stored in sterile Eppendorf tubes at -20\u00a0\u00b0C until metal analysis, and analysed with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. With this study, we contribute to the limited number of studies on metal accumulation in heart tissue and present the first data for Mg accumulation in the heart, liver, muscle and kidney tissues of both species. We found that metal accumulation levels differed among the two study species' tissues, with some elements in the same tissue (Al", "journal": "Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)", "date": "2022-10-25", "authors": ["Sude\u00c7elik", "DamlaBeton", "Burak Ali\u00c7i\u00e7ek", "Robin T ESnape", "EyupBa\u015fkale"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120482"}
{"title": "SIRT6 Mitigates Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Diabetes.", "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing health problem without effective therapies. Epidemiological studies indicate that diabetes is a strong risk factor for HFpEF, and about 45% of patients with HFpEF are suffering from diabetes, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.\nUsing a combination of echocardiography, hemodynamics, RNA-sequencing, molecular biology, in vitro and in vivo approaches, we investigated the roles of SIRT6 (sirtuin 6) in regulation of endothelial fatty acid (FA) transport and HFpEF in diabetes.\nWe first observed that endothelial SIRT6 expression was markedly diminished in cardiac tissues from heart failure patients with diabetes.

It is critical to develop pharmacological intervention to scavenge ROS and inhibit NLRP3 activation to have a double benefit against MI/R injury. Cinnamamide derivatives have been demonstrated to possess anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. Previously, we have reported that a cinnamamide derivative 2 exerts excellent cardioprotective effect via mediation of intracellular oxidative stress via Nrf2 up-regulation against MI/R. In the present study, seventeen compounds have been optimized using cinnamamide-barbiturate hybrid 2 as the lead compound and their cardioprotective activities against MI/R were further determined in vitro and in vivo. Among them, compound 7 showed the most potent cardioprotective effect and low cytotoxicity. While cardiomyocytes were invased by hydrogen peroxide, compound 7 exhibited more excellent cardioprotective effect than that of luteolin and metoprolol, the positive control employed in the present study, as demonstrated by dramatically elevated cell survival rate and decreased LDH leakage rate. Moreover, compound 7 markedly inhibited cardiac expressions of inflammasome activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines release (i.e. NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18), simultaneouly increasing endogenous antioxidative proteins (i.e. Nrf2, HO-1 and SOD) in vitro. In the rat MI/R model, compound 7 pretreatment profoundly reduced cardiac infarct size in MI/R rats and reversed abnormal changes in myocardial enzymes and lipid peroxidation levels in heart tissues. Mechanistically, compound 7 revealed significant cardioprotective effects by inhibiting NLRP3 and its downstream inflammatory chemokine IL-1\u03b2, as well as up-regulating Nrf2 in vivo. Furthermore, at the active site of the co-crystal of NLRP3 and Nrf2, compound 7 exhibited higher binding force in the molecular docking study, which was consistent with the in vitro results. Therefore, compound 7 is expected to be a potential cardioprotective agent possessing dual anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities.

{"title": "Importance of beating rate control for the analysis of drug effects on contractility in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Cardiac contractility evaluation using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has recently attracted much attention as a clinical cardiotoxicity predictive model. Most studies on this were conducted under spontaneous beating conditions and involved video-based analyses. Cardiac contractility is known to be influenced by beating rates; accordingly, beating rate control is recommended to accurately analyze the effects of drugs on cardiac contractility. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between contraction parameters and beating rates of cardiac cell sheet tissues by directly measuring the contraction force and compared the effects of ion channel drugs (mexiletine, ranolazine, and dofetilide) on contraction parameters under spontaneous beating conditions with those under pacing (1\u00a0Hz) conditions. To characterize the contraction/relaxation kinetics, we introduced a novel analysis tool, called a \"C-V loop,\" a plot of contraction force versus force-changing rate (\"velocity\"). When we increased the beating rate, the contraction force, force-changing rate, and relaxation time markedly decreased. The occurrence frequencies of beating arrest and irregular beats at high concentration ranges of mexiletine and ranolazine were more suppressed in paced samples than in spontaneously beating ones. We also found that relaxation time increased by treatment with dofetilide and contraction amplitude decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by mexiletine treatment only in the samples under pacing. These drug responses were consistent with the previous reports using human samples. These results indicated that beating rate control is necessary to stably evaluate the effects of drugs on contractility and that tests under 1-Hz pacing are more relevant to clinical settings.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods", "date": "2022-10-24", "authors": ["YutoHinata", "YukiKagawa", "HirotsuguKubo", "ErikoKato", "AtsushiBaba", "DaisukeSasaki", "KatsuhisaMatsuura", "KoheiSawada", "TatsuyaShimizu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vascn.2022.107228"}

{"title": "Alternation of heart microRNA-mRNA network by high-intensity interval training and proanthocyanidin in myocardial ischemia rats: Artificial intelligence and validation experimental.", "abstract": "Heart ischemia is an irreversible condition that occurs via decreased blood flow in vessels by genetic factors, molecular regulators, and environmental conditions. The microRNAs binding to 3\u00b4UTR of target genes can influence gene expression and play pivotal roles in several mechanisms identified as a potential biomarker to the pathogenesis. We have screened a pool of microRNAs and mRNAs according to their potential correlation to myocardial ischemia based on artificial intelligence. We constructed the hub genes and mRNA-microRNA networks by R programing language and in silico analysis. Moreover, we calculated the binding affinity of the 3D structure of proanthocyanidin on VEGF\u03b1 and GATA4 to ameliorate heart tissue after ischemia. Then we treated rats with 300\u2009mg/kg proanthocyanidins and exercised in different intensity and duration times (low, moderate, and high-intensity interval training) for 14\u2009weeks. In the second step, after 14\u2009weeks, isoproterenol hydrochloride was injected into the rats, and myocardial ischemia was induced. We indicated that VEGF\u03b1, GATA4, and GJA1 axis associated with miR-27a-3p, miR-499-5p, miR-206-3p, miR-208a-3p are regulatable after 14\u2009weeks of exercise training and proanthocyanidin extract consumption and could prevent myocardial injuries in ischemia. Moreover, we revealed different intensity and duration times, and proanthocyanidin modulated the microRNA-mRNA interaction in rats with myocardial ischemia. Proanthocyanidin consumption as a bioactive compound may significantly ameliorate myocardial dysfunction and offset pathological hallmarks of myocardial ischemia. Moreover, exercise has protective effects on myocardial tissue by reprograming genes and genetic regulator factors. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Complimentary medicine identified Proanthocyanidin and exercise are recognized as effective methods to prevent and improve Myocardial ischemia. According to medical biology servers, we explored the VEGF\u03b1, GATA4, and GJA1 axis associated with miR-27a-3p, miR-499-5p, miR-206-3p, miR-208a-3p as a vital pathomechanism of myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, proanthocyanidin extract is the effective compound that could has protective effects on myocardial tissue by reprograming genes and genetic regulator factors. Furthermore, proanthocyanidin and swimming training might recover myocardial dysfunction and regulate the hub genes and mRNA-microRNA networks.", "journal": "Journal of food biochemistry", "date": "2022-10-23", "authors": ["SafarZarei", "FarzanehTaghian", "GholamrezaSharifi", "HassanaliAbedi"], "doi": "10.1111/jfbc.14488"}
{"title": "Targeted pharmacokinetics and bioinformatics screening strategy reveals JAK2 as the main target for Xin-Ji-Er-Kang in treatment of MIR injury.", "abstract": "Xin-Ji-Er-Kang (XJEK) is traditional Chinese formula presented excellent protective effects on several heart diseases, but the potential components and targets are still unclear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effective components of XJEK and reveal its potential mechanism of cardioprotective effect in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) injury.\nFirstly, the key compounds in XJEK, plasma and heart tissue were analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry. Bioinformatics studies were also involved to disclose the potential targets and the binding sites for the key compounds. Secondly, to study the protective effect of XJEK on MIR injury and related mechanism, mice subjected to MIR surgery and gavage administered with XJEK for 6 weeks. Cardiac function parameters and apoptosis level of cardiac tissue were assessed. The potential mechanism was further verified by knock down of target protein in vitro.\nPharmacokinetics studies showed that Sophora flavescens alkaloids, primarily composed with matrine, are the key component of XJEK. And, through bioinformatic analysis, we speculated JAK2 could be the potential target for XJEK, and could form stable hydrogen bonds with matrine. Administration of XJEK and matrine significantly improved heart function and reduced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by increasing the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. The anti-apoptosis effect of XJEK and matrine was also observed on AC16 cells, and could be reversed by co-treatment with JAK2 inhibitor AG490 or knock-down of JAK2.\nXJEK exerts cardioprotective effect on MIR injury, which may be associated with the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2022-10-23", "authors": ["KaiZhou", "HuaChen", "Xiao-YuWang", "Yan-MeiXu", "Yu-FengLiao", "Yuan-YuanQin", "Xue-WanGe", "Ting-TingZhang", "Zhong-LinFang", "Bei-BeiFu", "Qing-ZhongXiao", "Feng-QinZhu", "Si-RuiChen", "Xue-ShengLiu", "Qi-ChaoLuo", "ShanGao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113792"}
{"title": "Role of Scl39a13/ZIP13 in cardiovascular homeostasis.", "abstract": "Zinc plays a critical role in many physiological processes, and disruption of zinc homeostasis induces various disorders, such as growth retardation, osteopenia, immune deficiency, and inflammation. However, how the imbalance in zinc homeostasis leads to heart disease is not yet fully understood. Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death worldwide, and the development of novel therapeutic targets to treat it is urgently needed. We report that a zinc transporter, ZIP13, regulates cardiovascular homeostasis. We found that the expression level of Zip13 mRNA was diminished in both primary neonatal cardiomyocytes and mouse heart tissues treated with the cardiotoxic agent doxycycline. Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes from Zip13 gene-knockout (KO) mice exhibited abnormal irregular arrhythmic beating. RNA-seq analysis identified 606 differentially expressed genes in Zip13-KO mouse-derived primary neonatal cardiomyocytes and Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that both inflammation- and cell adhesion-related genes were significantly enriched. In addition, telemetry echocardiography analysis suggested that arrhythmias were likely to occur in Zip13-KO mice, in which elevated levels of the cardiac fibrosis marker Col1a1, vascular inflammation-related gene eNOS, and Golgi-related molecule GM130 were observed. These results indicate the physiological importance of ZIP13-it maintains cardiovascular homeostasis by resolving inflammation and stress response. Our findings suggest that optimizing ZIP13 expression and/or function may improve cardiovascular disease management.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2022-10-22", "authors": ["TakafumiHara", "IkukoYamada", "TakutoOhashi", "MasaruTamura", "AtsushiHijikata", "TakashiWatanabe", "MinghaoGao", "KanaIto", "SaekoKawamata", "ShioriAzuma", "EmiYoshigai", "YukikoSumiyoshi", "NatsumiYasuhiro", "OsamuOhara", "Helo\u00edsa G DosSantos", "ToshiyukiFukada"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0276452\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61752-3\n10.1038/nrcardio.2010.166\n10.1007/s12576-017-0521-4\n10.1016/j.jphs.2021.11.007\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.05.001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0003642\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.12.002\n10.1073/pnas.1710726114\n10.1038/s41587-019-0201-4\n10.1186/s13059-019-1910-1\n10.1093/nar/gks042\n10.1016/s0888-7543(02)00021-6\n10.1038/aps.2018.25\n10.1016/j.nut.2010.03.007\n10.1007/s12011-019-01671-0\n10.1111/jcmm.13480\n10.1074/jbc.M115.661280\n10.1007/s00441-018-2977-9\n10.1159/000265166\n10.1073/pnas.1904979116\n10.2147/IPRP.S133088\n10.1042/BST20140285\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.310082\n10.3390/ijms18112395\n10.1093/cvr/cvq352\n10.1093/hmg/11.15.1775\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa090\n10.1172/JCI96993\n10.1038/emm.2006.63\n10.1111/j.1751-1097.1989.tb04175.x\n10.1186/s10020-018-0037-2\n10.1074/jbc.M803514200\n10.1038/srep38894\n10.1038/s41467-019-14038-9\n10.1002/1873-3468.13554\n10.1159/000510576\n10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00031-4"}
{"title": "Role of AMPK in Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury-Induced Cell Death in the Presence and Absence of Diabetes.", "abstract": "Recent studies indicate cell death is the hallmark of cardiac pathology in myocardial infarction and diabetes. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway is considered a putative salvaging phenomenon, plays a decisive role in almost all cellular, metabolic, and survival functions, and therefore entails precise regulation of its activity. AMPK regulates various programmed cell death depending on the stimuli and context, including autophagy, apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis. There is substantial evidence suggesting that AMPK is down-regulated in cardiac tissues of animals and humans with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome compared to non-diabetic control and that stimulation of AMPK (physiological or pharmacological) can ameliorate diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore, AMPK is an exciting therapeutic target for developing novel drug candidates to treat cell death in diabetes-associated myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, in this review, we summarized how AMPK regulates autophagic, apoptotic, necroptotic, and ferroptosis pathways in the context of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in the presence and

{"title": "Grass-roots optimization of coupled oscillator networks.", "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of biological and physical systems for which synchronization is critical, existing theory for optimizing synchrony depends on global information and does not sufficiently explore local mechanisms that enhance synchronization. Thus, there is a lack of understanding for the self-organized, collective processes that aim to optimize or repair synchronous systems, e.g., the dynamics of paracrine signaling within cardiac cells. Here we present \"grass-roots\" optimization of synchronization, which is a multiscale mechanism in which local optimizations of smaller subsystems cooperate to collectively optimize an entire system. Considering models of cardiac tissue and a power grid, we show that grass-roots-optimized systems are comparable to globally optimized systems, but they also have the added benefit of being robust to targeted attacks or subsystem islanding. Our findings motivate and support further investigation into the physics of local mechanisms that can support self-optimization for complex systems.", "journal": "Physical review.

{"title": "Electroconductive scaffolds based on gelatin and PEDOT:PSS for cardiac regeneration.", "abstract": "Electroconductive biomaterials have been emerged to support the recovery of the degenerated electrically conductive tissues, especially the cardiac ones after myocardial infarction. This work describes the development of electroconductive scaffolds for cardiac tissue regeneration by using a biocompatible and conductive polymer - i.e. poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) - combined with a biomimetic polymer network of gelatin. Our approach involves the use of dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment in vacuum conditions to fabricate suitably stable scaffolds without using any additional crosslinking agent. The resulting scaffolds mimic the Young modulus - an essential mechanical performance - of native cardiac tissue and are endowed with a well-interconnected porosity coupled with a good swelling ability and stability in physiological conditions. Additionally, the presence of PEDOT:PSS is able to enhance the electroconductivity of resulting materials. All the scaffolds are non-cytotoxic towards H9C2 cardiomyoblasts and the presence of PEDOT:PSS enhances cell adhesion - especially at early timeframes, an essential condition for a successful outcome after the implantation - proliferation, and spreading on scaffolds. Considering the permissive interaction of scaffolds with cardiomyoblasts, the present biomimetic and electroconductive scaffolds display potential applications as implantable biomaterials for regeneration of electroconductive tissues, especially cardiac tissue, and as a promising 3D tissue model for in vitro biomolecules screening.", "journal": "International journal of biological macromolecules", "date": "2022-10-21", "authors": ["FrancoFurlani", "ElisabettaCampodoni", "NicolaSangiorgi", "MonicaMontesi", "AlessandraSanson", "MonicaSandri", "SilviaPanseri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.10.122"}

{"title": "Characterization of the pace-and-drive capacity of the human sinoatrial node: A 3D in\u00a0silico study.", "abstract": "The sinoatrial node (SAN) is a complex structure that spontaneously depolarizes rhythmically (\"pacing\") and excites the surrounding non-automatic cardiac cells (\"drive\") to initiate each heart beat. However, the mechanisms by which the SAN cells can activate the large and hyperpolarized surrounding cardiac tissue are incompletely understood. Experimental studies demonstrated the presence of an insulating border that separates the SAN from the hyperpolarizing influence of the surrounding myocardium, except at a discrete number of sinoatrial exit pathways (SEPs). We propose a highly detailed 3D model of the human SAN, including 3D SEPs to study the requirements for successful electrical activation of the primary pacemaking structure of the human heart. A total of 788 simulations investigate the ability of the SAN to pace and drive with different heterogeneous characteristics of the nodal tissue (gradient and mosaic models) and myocyte orientation. A sigmoidal distribution of the tissue conductivity combined with a mosaic model of SAN and atrial cells in the SEP was able to drive the right atrium (RA) at varying rates induced by gradual If block. Additionally, we investigated the influence of the SEPs by varying their number, length, and width. SEPs created a transition zone of transmembrane voltage and ionic currents to enable successful pace and drive. Unsuccessful simulations showed a hyperpolarized transmembrane voltage (-66\u2009mV), which blocked the L-type channels and attenuated the sodium-calcium exchanger. The fiber direction influenced the SEPs that preferentially activated the crista terminalis (CT). The location of the leading pacemaker site (LPS) shifted toward the SEP-free areas. LPSs were located closer to the SEP-free areas (3.46 \u00b1 1.42\u2009mm), where the hyperpolarizing influence of the CT was reduced, compared with a larger distance from the LPS to the areas where SEPs were located (7.17\u00b1 0.98\u2009mm).

{"title": "Theranostic magnetic nanoparticles enhance DNA damage and mitigate doxorubicin-induced cardio-toxicity for effective multi-modal tumor therapy.", "abstract": "The chemo-therapeutic efficacy of Doxorubicin (Dox), a potent anti-cancer drug used in the treatment of several solid tumors, is severely compromised by its cardio-toxicity. To overcome this shortcoming and exploit the utmost theranostic potential of nano-formulations, magnetic nanoparticles co-encapsulated with Dox and indocyanine green (ICG) in a liposomal carrier and tagged with cyclic RGD peptide were rationally designed and synthesized. These magneto-liposomes (T-LMD) showed \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin receptor targeting and higher cyto-toxicity in several cancer cell lines (i.e. lung, breast, skin, brain and liver cancer) in combination with or without gamma radiation or magnetic hyperthermia therapy as compared to clinical liposomal nano-formulation of Dox (Lippod\u2122). Mechanism of chemo-radio-sensitization was found to involve activation of JNK mediated pro-apoptotic signaling axis and delayed repair of DNA double strand breaks. Real time imaging of ICG labeled T-LMD suggested ~6-18 fold higher tumor accumulation of T-LMD as compared to off-target organs (kidney, liver, spleen, intestine, lungs and heart) and resulted in its higher combinatorial (chemo-radio-hyperthermia) tumor therapy efficacy as compared to Lippod\u2122. Moreover, T-LMD showed insignificant toxicity to the heart tissue as suggested by serum levels of CK-MB, histo-pathological analysis, anti-oxidant enzyme activities (Catalase and GST) and markers of cardiac fibrosis, suggesting its potential for targeted multi-modal therapy of cancer.", "journal": "Biomaterials advances", "date": "2022-10-20", "authors": ["Neena GShetake", "ManjoorAli", "AmitKumar", "JayeshBellare", "Badri NPandey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioadv.2022.213147"}
{"title": "Generation and maturation of human iPSC-derived 3D organotypic cardiac microtissues in long-term culture.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide; hence there is an increasing focus on developing physiologically relevant in vitro cardiovascular tissue models suitable for studying personalized medicine and pre-clinical tests. Despite recent advances, models that reproduce both tissue complexity and maturation are still limited. We have established a scaffold-free protocol to generate multicellular, beating human cardiac microtissues in vitro from hiPSCs-namely human organotypic cardiac microtissues (hOCMTs)-that show some degree of self-organization and can be cultured for long term. This is achieved by the differentiation of hiPSC in 2D monolayer culture towards cardiovascular lineage, followed by further aggregation on low-attachment culture dishes in 3D. The generated hOCMTs contain multiple cell types that physiologically compose the heart and beat without external stimuli for more than 100\u00a0days. We have shown that 3D hOCMTs display improved cardiac specification, survival and metabolic maturation as compared to standard monolayer cardiac differentiation. We also confirmed the functionality of hOCMTs by their response to cardioactive drugs in long-term culture. Furthermore, we demonstrated that they could be used to study chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Due to showing a tendency for self-organization, cellular heterogeneity, and functionality in our 3D microtissues over extended culture time, we could also confirm these constructs as human cardiac organoids (hCOs). This study could help to develop more physiologically-relevant cardiac tissue models, and represent a powerful platform for future translational research in cardiovascular biology.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-10-19", "authors": ["EceErgir", "JorgeOliver-De La Cruz", "SoraiaFernandes", "MarcoCassani", "FrancescoNiro", "DanielPereira-Sousa", "JanVrbsk\u00fd", "Vladim\u00edrVinarsk\u00fd", "Ana RubinaPerestrelo", "DorianaDebellis", "Nat\u00e1liaVadovi\u010dov\u00e1", "StjepanUldrijan", "FrancescaCavalieri", "StefaniaPagliari", "HeinzRedl", "PeterErtl", "GiancarloForte"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-22225-w\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30925-9\n10.2147/IPRP.S133088\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.1161/HHF.0b013e318291329a\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0124\n10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004221\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.01.011\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.04.006\n10.1038/s41580-020-0259-3\n10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146427\n10.1002/prp2.863\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305374\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1007/7651_2015_196\n10.1038/nm.4087\n10.1038/s41596-018-0076-8\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.10.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303810\n10.1002/stem.532\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.06.002\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.07.021\n10.1161/hh0202.103644\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310738\n10.1038/s41551-018-0253-7\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300522\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.1101/cshperspect.a014076\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.1038/ncomms8413\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.05.004\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.068\n10.1038/s41467-021-26496-1\n10.1039/c1lc20557a\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.11.024\n10.1038/nm.3545\n10.1039/C5LC01356A\n10.1002/bit.25847\n10.1002/adhm.201601170\n10.1039/C7IB00199A\n10.1089/ten.tea.2019.0002\n10.1007/s10544-006-9013-7\n10.1038/s41598-017-08879-x\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034006\n10.1126/science.1247125\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.082\n10.1242/dmm.039347\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.04.009\n10.1038/nature11859\n10.1146/annurev-pathmechdis-012419-032611\n10.1152/ajpcell.00120.2020\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.034\n10.1038/s41467-018-05604-8\n10.1038/s41467-020-18031-5\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.1038/s41467-021-25329-5\n10.1016/j.stem.2021.11.007\n10.1038/s41596-021-00629-8\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.04.019\n10.1155/2016/4081638\n10.1002/stem.1289\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00087\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00178\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1093/cvr/cvr038\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.055\n10.1093/toxsci/kfr158\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.04.011\n10.1038/6553\n10.1097/00005344-199006000-00006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312067\n10.1038/s41598-020-62955-3\n10.1097/FPC.0b013e32833ffb56\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.006\n10.1016/j.pcad.2006.10.002\n10.1002/ehf2.12616\n10.1016/j.hlc.2018.08.003\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000426\n10.1038/ncomms6288\n10.1038/s41598-021-94732-1\n10.1038/s41569-018-0086-9\n10.1016/j.ceca.2015.02.003\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1161/01.RES.56.3.377\n10.1096/fj.03-0520fje\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.05.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317685\n10.1152/ajpheart.00401.2018\n10.1309/AJCPB66LRIIVMQDR\n10.3390/ijms19040936\n10.1007/s00246-019-02165-5\n10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00305\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.03.013\n10.1038/s41418-020-00643-5\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.03.009\n10.1186/1471-2105-14-128\n10.1093/nar/gkw377\n10.1002/cpz1.90\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1016/j.cels.2018.10.007"}
{"title": "The extended analogy of extraembryonic development in insects and amniotes.", "abstract": "It is fascinating that the amnion and serosa/chorion, two extraembryonic (EE) tissues that are characteristic of the amniote vertebrates (mammals, birds and reptiles), have also independently evolved in insects. In this review, we offer the first detailed, macroevolutionary comparison of EE development and tissue biology across these animal groups. Some commonalities represent independent solutions to shared challenges for protecting the embryo (environmental assaults, risk of pathogens) and supporting its development, including clear links between cellular properties (e.g. polyploidy) and physiological function. Further parallels encompass developmental features such as the early segregation of the serosa/chorion compared to later, progressive differentiation of the amnion and formation of the amniotic cavity from serosal-amniotic folds as a widespread morphogenetic mode across species. We also discuss common developmental roles for orthologous transcription factors and BMP signalling in EE tissues of amniotes and insects, and between EE and cardiac tissues, supported by our exploration of new resources for global and tissue-specific gene expression.

{"title": "Long-term intake of aspartame-induced cardiovascular toxicity is reflected in altered histochemical parameters, evokes oxidative stress, and trigger P53-dependent apoptosis in a mouse model.", "abstract": "Aspartame (ASP) is probably the best known artificial sugar substitute that is used widely in food. Many experimental studies have reported the toxicity of long-term administration of ASP in various organ tissues. However, there is little evidence available about the nature and mechanisms of the adverse effects of long-term consumption of ASP on the cardiovascular system. This study was conducted to evaluate the possible effects of ASP on heart tissue. For this study 36 mature male mice were divided into one control group and three groups which received respectively 40\u2009mg/kg, 80\u2009mg/kg and 160\u2009mg/kg ASP orally, for 90\u2009days. ASP at the doses of 80 and 160\u2009mg/kg increased the serum content of malondialdehyde (MDA), but decreased serum nitric oxide (NO), creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB, as well as blood superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Serum level of total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) in blood was also reduced in serum at the dose of 80\u2009mg/kg. Histochemical staining, including Periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson staining, indicated that ASP at doses of 80 and 160\u2009mg/kg reduced glycogen deposition and decreased the number of collagen and elastic fibres in the cardiac tissue. The cardiac expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including P53, Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3, was modulated at the dose of 160\u2009mg/kg. Moreover, transcription of Caspase-3 was up-regulated at the dose of 80\u2009mg/kg. In conclusion, long-term consumption of ASP any higher than the acceptable daily intake (40\u2009mg/kg) appears to act by promoting oxidative stress, has the potential to alter both histopathological and biochemical parameters, and induces P53-dependent apoptosis in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "International journal of experimental pathology", "date": "2022-10-18", "authors": ["HojatAnbara", "MehdiKian", "Gholam-HosseinDarya", "Mohammad TaghiSheibani"], "doi": "10.1111/iep.12458\n10.1093/nutrit/nux035\n10.3390/nu13061957\n10.1016/j.fct.2013.07.040\n10.1016/j.tiv.2010.09.002\n10.1016/j.jfda.2017.11.001\n10.1080/15287397609529445\n10.1016/s2222-1808(14)60478-3\n10.1016/0278-6915(86)90227-9\n10.1515/jbcpp-2014-0130\n10.1016/j.jnim.2017.06.002\n10.1016/j.nutres.2017.04.002\n10.1016/j.jfda.2014.07.011\n10.7324/jabb.2016.40207\n10.2174/1573401310666141024215431\n10.29252/qums.12.12.2\n10.22074/ijfs.2020.6065\n10.1002/tox.23028\n10.1038/ijir.2017.17\n10.1007/s11011-017-0052-y\n10.1007/s00580-014-2013-8\n10.7555/JBR.30.20140097\n10.1016/j.biomag.2014.03.001\n10.2174/1381612825666190925163827\n10.3390/nu11092090\n10.1155/2020/5732956\n10.1016/j.nupar.2016.01.071\n10.1016/j.nlm.2016.12.021\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.01.019\n10.1016/0003-2697(82)90118-x\n10.22038/IJBMS.2018.26023.6397\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1016/s0024-3205(98)00282-3\n10.1007/s12038-014-9487-z\n10.1038/scientificamerican0592-68\n10.1136/hrt.2005.068270\n10.1016/j.ddstr.2013.11.003\n10.3923/ijp.2019.336.342\n10.1055/s-0039-1679104\n10.1042/0300-5127:0290684\n10.1016/s0065-230x(01)82002-9\n10.9790/3013-32203033\n10.1371/journal.pone.0204913\n10.2337/dc12-9002"}

In this case, stem cell treatment holds a promising challenge. Stem cells are the cells that are capable of differentiating into many cells according to their needs. So, it is assumed that these cells can distinguish into many cells and if these cells can be individualized into cardiac cells then they can be used to replace the damaged tissues of the heart.

{"title": "Blood DNA methylation marks discriminate Chagas cardiomyopathy disease clinical forms.", "abstract": "Chagas disease is a parasitic disease from South America, affecting around 7 million people worldwide. Decades after the infection, 30% of people develop chronic forms, including Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC), for which no treatment exists. Two stages characterized this form: the moderate form, characterized by a heart ejection fraction (EF) \u2265 0.4, and the severe form, associated to an EF < 0.4. We propose two sets of DNA methylation biomarkers which can predict in blood CCC occurrence, and CCC stage. This analysis, based on machine learning algorithms, makes predictions with more than 95% accuracy in a test cohort. Beyond their predictive capacity, these CpGs are located near genes involved in the immune response, the nervous system, ion transport or ATP synthesis, pathways known to be deregulated in CCCs. Among these genes, some are also differentially expressed in heart tissues. Interestingly, the CpGs of interest are tagged to genes mainly involved in nervous and ionic processes.

{"title": "Development of appropriate fatty acid formulations to raise the contractility of constructed myocardial tissues.", "abstract": "Heart disease is a major cause of mortality worldwide, and the annual number of deaths due to heart disease has increased in recent years. Although heart failure is usually managed with medicines, the ultimate treatment for end-stage disease is heart transplantation or an artificial heart. However, the use of these surgical strategies is limited by issues such as thrombosis, rejection and donor shortages. Regenerative therapies, such as the transplantation of cultured cells and tissues constructed using tissue engineering techniques, are receiving great attention as possible alternative treatments for heart failure. Research is ongoing into the potential clinical use of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). However, the energy-producing capacity of cardiomyocytes maintained under previous culture conditions is lower than that of adult primary cardiomyocytes due to immaturity and a reliance on glucose metabolism. Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare the types of fatty acids metabolized between cardiomyocytes in culture and heart cells \nA fatty acid-containing medium was developed based on an analysis of fatty acid consumption by rat primary cardiomyocytes (rat-CMs), and the effects of this medium on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were investigated through bioluminescence imaging of luciferase-expressing rat-CMs. Next, the fatty acid content of the medium was further adjusted based on analyses of fatty acid utilization by porcine hearts and hiPSC-CMs. Oxygen consumption analyses were performed to explore whether the fatty acid-containing medium induced hiPSC-CMs to switch from anaerobic metabolism to aerobic metabolism. Furthermore, the effects of the medium on contractile force generated by hiPSC-CM-derived tissue were evaluated.\nRat serum, human serum and porcine plasma contained similar types of fatty acid (oleic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid and arachidonic acid). The types of fatty acid consumed were also similar between rat-CMs, hiPSC-CMs and porcine heart. The addition of fatty acids to the culture medium increased the bioluminescence of luciferase-expressing rat-CMs (an indirect measure of ATP level), oxygen consumption by hiPSC-CMs, and contractile force generated by cardiac tissues constructed from hiPSC-CMs.\nhiPSC-CMs metabolize similar types of fatty acid to those consumed by rat-CMs and porcine hearts. Furthermore, the addition of these fatty acids to the culture medium increased energy production by rat-CMs and hiPSC-CMs and enhanced the contractility of myocardial tissue generated from hiPSC-CMs. These findings suggest that the addition of fatty acids to the culture medium stimulates aerobic energy production by cardiomyocytes through \u03b2-oxidation. Since cardiomyocytes cultured in standard media rely primarily on anaerobic glucose metabolism and remain in an immature state, further research is merited to establish whether the addition of fatty acids to the culture medium would improve the energy-producing capacity and maturity of hiPSC-CMs and cardiac tissue constructed from these cells. It is possible that optimizing the metabolism of cultured cardiomyocytes, which require high energy production to sustain their contractile function, will improve the properties of hiPSC-CM-derived tissue, allowing it to be better utilized for disease modeling, drug screening and regenerative therapies for heart failure.", "journal": "Regenerative therapy", "date": "2022-10-18", "authors": ["AzumiYoshida", "WakiSekine", "JunHomma", "HidekazuSekine", "Yu YamasakiItoyama", "DaisukeSasaki", "KatsuhisaMatsuura", "EijiKobayashi", "TatsuyaShimizu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.reth.2022.09.006\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.1007/978-3-030-18512-1_3-1\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa159\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.039\n10.1038/s41598-021-87186-y\n10.1038/s41467-021-23329-z\n10.3390/cells8091095\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1186/s13287-021-02252-6\n10.1038/ncomms2406\n10.1038/srep09563\n10.1038/srep21747"}
{"title": "Defective efferocytosis of vascular cells in heart disease.", "abstract": "The efficient phagocytic clearance of dying cells and apoptotic cells is one of the processes that is essential for the maintenance of physiologic tissue function and homeostasis, which is termed \"efferocytosis.\" Under normal conditions, \"find me\" and \"eat me\" signals are released by apoptotic cells to stimulate the engulfment and efferocytosis of apoptotic cells. In contrast, abnormal efferocytosis is related to chronic and non-resolving inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. In the initial steps of atherosclerotic lesion development, monocyte-derived macrophages display efficient efferocytosis that restricts plaque progression; however, this capacity is reduced in more advanced lesions. Macrophage reprogramming as a result of the accumulation of apoptotic cells and augmented inflammation accounts for this diminishment of efferocytosis. Furthermore, defective efferocytosis plays an important role in necrotic core formation, which triggers plaque rupture and acute thrombotic cardiovascular events. Recent publications have focused on the essential role of macrophage efferocytosis in cardiac pathophysiology and have pointed toward new therapeutic strategies to modulate macrophage efferocytosis for cardiac tissue repair. In this review, we discuss the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate efferocytosis in vascular cells, including macrophages and other phagocytic cells and detail how efferocytosis-related molecules contribute to the maintenance of vascular hemostasis and how defective efferocytosis leads to the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-10-18", "authors": ["BandanaSingh", "KathrynLi", "KuiCui", "QianmanPeng", "Douglas BCowan", "Da-ZhiWang", "KaifuChen", "HongChen"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2022.1031293\n10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.058\n10.1007/s10495-010-0516-6\n10.1038/nri2214\n10.1189/jlb.0209115\n10.1042/bse0390105\n10.1093/molbev/msx102\n10.1101/cshperspect.a008748\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.08.032\n10.1038/nature08296\n10.1080/08916930701356911\n10.1096/fj.08-107169\n10.1182/blood-2008-06-162404\n10.1038/cdd.2016.13\n10.1002/jcp.22815\n10.1074/jbc.M003649200\n10.1016/j.immuni.2007.11.011\n10.1038/nature06329\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4402242\n10.1242/jcs.049569\n10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00903.x\n10.1073/pnas.1114799108\n10.1083/jcb.200108080\n10.1242/jcs.113.17.2955fcvm-09-1031293\n10.1073/pnas.0803677105\n10.1038/35046549\n10.1038/ncb3192\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2012.01153.x\n10.1038/nature05245\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.179739\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64641-X\n10.1007/s00395-011-0192-x\n10.1038/nm0711-791\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000166517.18801.a7\n10.1016/j.cub.2006.09.043\n10.1172/JCI70391\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.04.005\n10.1189/jlb.0307192\n10.1172/JCI1112\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.09.005\n10.1016/j.immuni.2011.09.004\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.3.348\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000148548.47755.22\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.806158\n10.1111/jcmm.12689\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.237198\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304029\n10.1189/jlb.0410220\n10.1074/jbc.M111.263020\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.202051\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313028\n10.1007/s00018-020-03642-4\n10.3389/fcell.2020.624159\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031702\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.068\n10.1111/joim.12406\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.02.002\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.116.308036\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.300156\n10.1038/nri3520\n10.1093/intimm/dxt043\n10.1093/cvr/cvv218\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000229218.97976.43\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306256\n10.3389/fimmu.2015.00059\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.10.014\n10.1182/blood-2008-07-170787\n10.1172/JCI75005\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000105054.43931.f0\n10.1097/00062752-200201000-00006\n10.1253/circj.CJ-16-0924\n10.1038/nri2675\n10.1159/000097815\n10.3892/ijmm.2011.693\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4401444\n10.1016/j.cjca.2016.12.010\n10.1038/nature18935\n10.1038/s41419-019-1409-4\n10.1152/ajpcell.00152.2010\n10.1038/srep30889\n10.1016/j.immuni.2009.06.018\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.027844\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304723\n10.1242/jcs.02314\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300399"}
{"title": "Targeting DNA methylation can reduce cardiac injury associated with ischemia reperfusion: One step closer to clinical translation with blood-borne assessment.", "abstract": "Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is one of the main clinical challenges for cardiac surgeons. No effective strategies or therapy targeting the molecular and cellular mechanisms to reduce I/R exists to date, despite altered gene expression and cellular metabolism/physiology. We aimed to identify whether DNA methylation, an unexplored target, can be a potential site to curb I/R-associated cell death by using the left anterior descending artery occlusion model in male Wistar rats. I/R rat heart exhibited global DNA hypermethylation with a corresponding decline in the mitochondrial genes (PGC-1\u03b1, TFAM, POLG, ND1, ND3, ND4, Cyt B, COX1, and COX2), antioxidant genes (SOD2, catalase, and Gpx2) and elevation in apoptotic genes (Casp3, Casp7, and Casp9) expression with corresponding changes in their activity, resulting in injury. Targeting global DNA methylation in I/R hearts by using its inhibitor significantly reduced the I/R-associated infarct size by 45% and improved dysferlin levels via modulating the genes involved in cell death apoptotic pathway (Casp3, Casp7, and PARP), inflammation (IL-1\u03b2, TLR4, ICAM1, and MyD88), oxidative stress (SOD1, catalase, Gpx2, and NFkB) and mitochondrial function and its regulation (MT-ND1, ND3, COX1, ATP6, PGC1\u03b1, and TFAM) in the cardiac tissue. The corresponding improvement in the genes' function was reflected in the respective hearts via the reduction in apoptotic TUNEL positive cells and ROS levels, thereby improving myocardial architecture (H&E staining), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase activity) and mitochondrial electron transport chain activities and ATP levels. The analysis of blood from the I/R animals in the presence and absence of methylation inhibition exhibited a similar pattern of changes as that observed in the cardiac tissue with respect to global DNA methylation level and its enzymes (DNMT and TET) gene expression, where the blood cardiac injury markers enzymes like LDH and CK-MB were elevated along with declined tissue levels. Based on these observations, we concluded that targeting DNA methylation to reduce the level of DNA hypermethylation can be a promising approach in ameliorating I/R injury. Additionally, the blood-borne changes reflected I/R-associated myocardial tissue alteration, making it suitable to predict I/R-linked pathology.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-10-18", "authors": ["Sri RahaviBoovarahan", "Abdullah FAlAsmari", "NematAli", "RehanKhan", "Gino AKurian"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2022.1021909\n10.1002/cphy.c160006\n10.1016/b978-0-12-394309-5.00006-7\n10.1172/jci62874\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.956839\n10.1152/ajpheart.00016.2019\n10.1186/s13643-018-0708-7\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2022.148566\n10.1002/jbt.22911\n10.3892/ijmm.2017.3220\n10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.006\n10.1093/icb/icaa123\n10.1080/15592294.2014.1003744\n10.1007/BF00269099\n10.1016/j.jcrc.2010.09.001\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.2144/02334bm03\n10.3791/53207\n10.1007/s00109-014-1233-3\n10.1002/0471142905.hg1903s63\n10.1007/s00216-006-0375-8\n10.1007/BF02712155\n10.3390/ijms20194749\n10.1126/sciadv.aau6986\n10.1128/mcb.22.7.2124-2135.2002\n10.1186/s13072-021-00429-0\n10.3390/cells2030545\n10.3389/fcell.2021.696428\n10.1089/ars.2014.6186\n10.1093/nar/gks770\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.03.006\n10.1101/sqb.2009.74.031\n10.3390/ijms23031659\n10.1161/circresaha.119.314817\n10.1155/2019/6019637\n10.1186/s13148-021-01175-6\n10.1161/circulationaha.118.039357\n10.1073/pnas.1121249109\n10.1016/j.lab.2005.10.005\n10.1373/clinchem.2010.144121"}

{"title": "Fabrication, characterization and in vivo assessment of cardiogel loaded chitosan patch for myocardial regeneration.", "abstract": "Cell therapy is one of the promising approaches for cardiac repair, subsequently after infarction or injury. However, contemporary mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSCs) delivery strategies result in low retention and poor engraftment of donor cells, thus limiting the therapeutic efficacy. Here, we developed an engineered biomimetic cardiogel patch (EBCP) comprising of the native decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) \"cardiogel\" and chitosan, leading to the efficient regeneration of injured myocardium. We also developed novel bio-adhesive that is capable of suture-free epicardial placement of EBCP to injured myocardium. We have illustrated the potential of the mussels-inspired bioadhesive system, which comprises gelatin catechol and partially oxidized chitosan, which relies on self-crosslinking capability, to promote wet adhesion. In vitro studies with isolated cardiogel promoted cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration while aiding cardiomyogenic differentiation. The EBCP's ability to protect cells from abrasion due to surrounding tissues in the myocardial infarction (MI) rat model makes it more desirable. Furthermore, the epicardial implantation of the EBCP loaded with MSCs improves the initial retention of cells and subsequent functional cardiac recovery with enhanced myocardial tissue restoration. Histological examination showed the presence of EBCP and infiltration of cells to the infarcted heart tissue. The fast and facile synthesis of bioadhesive and major therapeutic benefits of EBCP make it a potential candidate for recuperating the ailing heart.", "journal": "International journal of biological macromolecules", "date": "2022-10-16", "authors": ["VineetaSharma", "AmitManhas", "SantoshGupta", "MadhuDikshit", "KumaraveluJagavelu", "Rama ShankerVerma"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.10.079"}
{"title": "Effect of high-fat diet and empagliflozin on cardiac proteins in mice.", "abstract": "Using proteomic techniques the impact of the sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitor empagliflozin on cardiac protein expression in a mouse model was assessed under normal and high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. We examined the effect of obesity on serological markers and heart function in obese mice treated with or without empagliflozin and used proteomic techniques to investigate alterations in cardiac protein expression. Using bioinformatic techniques, data were screened for differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) implicated in the putative mechanism of empagliflozin's cardioprotective effects. In C57BL/6 mice, HFD increased body weight, blood lipid, and glucose levels and was associated with structural damage to the heart. Empagliflozin reduces body weight, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, alleviates obesity-induced cardiac ventricular wall thickening, and lowers cardiac tissue collagen. The expression of several proteins was altered in the heart, mainly related to lipid metabolism. Following empagliflozin treatment, the expression of several lipid metabolism-related proteins was considerably reduced. Further examination of DEPs revealed that following empagliflozin treatment, the expressions of Apoe, Apoc1, Saa2, Apoa2, and Pon1 altered dramatically, suggesting that these proteins may be the main proteins that empagliflozin uses to treat obesity-induced aberrant lipid metabolism. Empagliflozin may protect the heart by altering the expression of genes including Apoe, Apoc1, Saa2, Apoa2, and Pon1, which are all involved in lipid metabolism disturbance in obesity.", "journal": "Nutrition & metabolism", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["XiaoyuPan", "ShuchunChen", "XingChen", "QingjuanRen", "LinYue", "ShuNiu", "ZelinLi", "RuiyiZhu", "XiaoyiChen", "ZhuoyaJia", "RuoxiZhen", "JiangliBan"], "doi": "10.1186/s12986-022-00705-0\n10.1056/NEJMoa1515920\n10.1056/NEJMoa2022190\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.037778\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028268\n10.2337/dc17-1096\n10.1210/clinem/dgaa577\n10.2337/db19-0991\n10.1186/s12933-014-0148-1\n10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1768_17\n10.1016/j.hfc.2020.02.004\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab518\n10.7554/eLife.70784\n10.1074/mcp.RA119.001878\n10.3389/fendo.2021.568197\n10.1002/emmm.201100198\n10.1093/nar/gkn176\n10.1093/nar/gkr988\n10.1038/nmeth.1322\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.051685\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa968\n10.1016/S2213-8587(20)30344-2\n10.2174/1573399812666160613113556\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa123\n10.1016/j.jchf.2018.01.009\n10.2174/1871529X20999201231205504\n10.1186/s12933-020-00997-7\n10.1038/s41598-019-54522-2\n10.1007/s00109-018-1632-y\n10.1016/j.nbd.2020.104809\n10.1007/s10238-007-0142-y\n10.1152/ajpendo.00408.2004\n10.1016/j.metabol.2010.01.015\n10.1161/01.ATV.19.3.472\n10.3389/fonc.2020.01436\n10.21037/atm.2019.07.59\n10.1111/1759-7714.12117\n10.3390/ijms20235939\n10.1194/jlr.M400301-JLR200\n10.3920/BM2015.0074\n10.1074/jbc.M202993200\n10.1194/jlr.M300240-JLR200\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.026\n10.1371/journal.pmed.0030287\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.207373\n10.1210/edrv.23.2.0461\n10.1126/science.8332912\n10.1002/ajmg.10364"}

{"title": "Silencing the Adipocytokine NOV: A Novel Approach to Reversing Oxidative Stress-Induced Cardiometabolic Dysfunction.", "abstract": "NOV/CCN3 is an adipocytokine recently linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiometabolic dysfunction. NOV is manufactured and secreted from adipose tissue, with blood levels highly correlated with BMI. NOV levels are increased in obesity and a myriad of inflammatory diseases. Elevated NOV levels cause oxidative stress by increasing free radicals, decreasing antioxidants, and decreasing heme oxygenase (HO-1) levels, resulting in decreased vascular function. Silencing NOV in NOV knockout mice improved insulin sensitivity. We wanted to study how suppressing NOV expression in an obese animal model affected pathways and processes related to obesity, inflammation, and cardiometabolic function. This is the first study to investigate the interaction of adipose tissue-specific NOV/CCN3 and cardiometabolic function.\nWe constructed a lentivirus containing the adiponectin-promoter-driven shNOV to examine the effect of NOV inhibition (shNOV) in adipose tissue on the heart of mice fed a high-fat diet. Mice were randomly divided into three groups (five per group): (1) lean (normal diet), (2) high-fat diet (HFD)+ sham virus, and (3) HFD + shNOV lentivirus. Blood pressure, tissue inflammation, and oxygen consumption were measured. Metabolic and mitochondrial markers were studied in fat and heart tissues.\nMice fed an HFD developed adipocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and decreased mitochondrial respiration. Inhibiting NOV expression in the adipose tissue of obese mice by shNOV increased mitochondrial markers for biogenesis (PGC-1\u03b1, the nuclear co-activator of HO-1) and functional integrity (FIS1) and insulin signaling (AKT). The upregulation of metabolic and mitochondrial markers was also evident in the hearts of the shNOV mice with the activation of mitophagy. Using RNA arrays, we identified a subgroup of genes that highly correlated with increased adipocyte mitochondrial autophagy in shNOV-treated mice. A heat map analysis in obese mice confirmed that the suppression of NOV overrides the genetic susceptibility of adiposity and the associated detrimental metabolic changes and correlates with the restoration of anti-inflammatory, thermogenic, and mitochondrial genes.\nOur novel findings demonstrate that inhibiting NOV expression improves adipose tissue function in a positive way in cardiometabolic function by inducing mitophagy and improving mitochondrial function by the upregulation of PGC-1\u03b1, the insulin sensitivity signaling protein. Inhibiting NOV expression increases PGC-1, a key component of cardiac bioenergetics, as well as key signaling components of metabolic change, resulting in improved glucose tolerance, improved mitochondrial function, and decreased inflammation. These metabolic changes resulted in increased oxygen consumption, decreased adipocyte size, and improved cardiac metabolism and vascular function at the structural level. The crosstalk of the adipose tissue-specific deletion of NOV/CCN3 improved cardiovascular function, representing a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity-related cardiometabolic dysfunction.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["MaayanWaldman", "Shailendra PSingh", "Hsin-HsuehShen", "RaginAlex", "RitaRezzani", "GaiaFavero", "EdithHochhauser", "RanKornowski", "MichaelArad", "Stephen JPeterson"], "doi": "10.3390/cells11193060\n10.1093/carcin/bgt103\n10.1186/1478-811X-4-1\n10.1111/jcmm.14621\n10.18632/oncotarget.15439\n10.1007/s12079-015-0281-y\n10.1038/ijo.2008.277\n10.2337/db15-0617\n10.1371/journal.pone.0066788\n10.1515/hmbci-2017-0029\n10.1155/2021/7138800\n10.3390/antiox9060489\n10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00317-8\n10.1042/BCJ20160503C\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.02.002\n10.1007/978-3-319-48382-5_12\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv350\n10.1016/j.rec.2013.10.011\n10.1152/ajpregu.00125.2018\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000099542.57313.C5\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2021.107975\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2009.09.014\n10.1667/RR1950.1\n10.1002/path.4113\n10.1172/JCI1324\n10.1016/j.tips.2015.09.003\n10.3390/antiox9010040\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.193805\n10.1152/ajpheart.00093.2017\n10.5551/jat.7401\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2016.07.004\n10.1089/scd.2016.0072\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2018.05.008\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2019.04.029\n10.1172/JCI11218\n10.1016/j.cmet.2007.06.003\n10.1155/2018/3484107\n10.4172/2329-6607.1000233\n10.1155/2016/9039754\n10.1515/hmbci-2017-0027\n10.1002/oby.22608\n10.3390/ijms18081770\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.05.060\n10.1002/oby.22629\n10.1038/s41591-020-1126-7\n10.1136/gutjnl-2017-313884\n10.1016/j.cmet.2005.03.002\n10.1073/pnas.0603615103\n10.2337/dc09-1305\n10.1186/s12933-018-0754-4\n10.7554/eLife.24071\n10.1016/j.phrs.2012.09.003\n10.1016/j.jhep.2013.01.011\n10.1080/15548627.2017.1356977\n10.1101/cshperspect.a011072\n10.3389/fphar.2019.01193"}

The rats received intragastric GDL (400 mg/kg body weight) once per day for 42 consecutive days after 56 days of CuSO4 exposure, and penicillamine was used as a positive control. The levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines (IMA, hFABP, cTn-I and BNP) were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The histopathological symptoms were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. To determine the underlying mechanism, Western blotting was conducted for the detection of the heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression. The results revealed that GDL supplementation alleviated the histopathological symptoms of the rat heart tissue, promoted Cu excretion to attenuate impairment, and significantly decreased inflammatory cytokine levels in the plasma (p < 0.01). In addition, GDL increased the HO-1 expression in the rat hepatic tissue. The protective effect of GDL on the heart was superior to that of penicillamine.

{"title": "Therapeutic study of hyperbaric oxygen on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning and myocardial injury.", "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning causes myocardial injury, which is attenuated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). During CO poisoning, the body increases anti-inflammatory proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), in response to oxidative stress. Considering the myocardial injury resulting from CO poisoning and the lack of sufficient information about the effect of HBOT on HO-1, the present study evaluated the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning and myocardial injury. In this regard, in a before-after Quasi-Experimental study, 20 patients with carbon monoxide poisoning and myocardial injury were studied. All patients underwent 40 daily hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions for 90 minutes at a pressure of 2.4 ATA. Also, 20 healthy individuals, as a control group, were participated. To evaluate and compare the mRNA level of the HO-1 gene, the Real-time PCR technique was used. Paired t-test was used to compare the two indices of 6min walking distance and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) before and after the intervention. The results showed that the difference during 12 weeks was 8.65 \u00b1 4.91 for PAP, and this reduction in pressure was statistically significant (P = 0.0092). The distance traveled increased by 28 \u00b1 10.88 m in 6 minutes at the end of the study (P = 0.0084). Regarding the expression level of HO-1, the results showed that the expression level in the intervention group before the test had a significant increase compared to the control group (p = 0.0004). However, after hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the expression of this gene decreased significantly, and there was no statistically significant difference with the control group (p = 0.062). Overall, the results showed that HBOT significantly decreased HO-1 gene expression in CO poisoning and myocardial injury patients.

Group I (control) animals were orally treated with olive oil. Group II (scopoletin) animals were pre-treated orally with a 50-mg dosage of scopoletin for 28 days. Group III (ISO-treated) animals were treated with 85\u00a0mg/kg of ISO subcutaneously for 2 consecutive days (29th and 30th day). Group IV (scopoletin and ISO) animals were pre-treated orally with 25\u00a0mg of scopoletin for 28 days before exposure to ISO. Group V (scopoletin and ISO) animals were pre-treated with 50\u00a0mg of scopoletin for 28 days before exposure to ISO. In the ISO-administered animals, a wider heart-to-body weight ratio, a higher heart weight, higher cardiac diagnostic markers, higher MDA levels and related antioxidant levels, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers were observed. Scopoletin pre-treatment with ISO (25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg b.wt) significantly reduced heart-to-body weight ratio, cardiac diagnostic markers, MDA, inflammatory markers, and apoptotic markers. Meantime, a pre-treatment with scopoletin increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes. Inflammation and necrosis were observed in the histopathology of heart tissue of ISO-treated animals and these histopathological conditions were reversed by scopoletin pretreatment. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of ISO-treated rats were shown to be increased by scopoletin, showing its therapeutic potential against cardiovascular diseases.

RVH becomes a significant and nonnegligible public health issue in the world. In our study, we successfully established the HPH rat model and found that RVH happened in HPH, and then we observed an increased inflammation response in the heart tissue of HPH-induced RVH rats. Moreover, increased N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase-1 (NDST1) and decreased nuclear localized protein 1 (NULP1) were found in the heart tissue of HPH-induced RVH rats. An in vitro cell experiment showed that inhibition of NDST1 expression enhanced cell viability, reduced cell apoptosis, alleviated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, decreased inflammation and increased phosphorylated AKT level, however, over-expression of NDST1 had opposite effects on these aspects. NULP1 reversed the effects of NDST1 on these regulations. Finally, we found that up-regulated NDST1 reduced NULP1 expression and down-regulated NDST1 increased NULP1 expression. Our study confirmed that inhibition of the NDST1/NULP1 pathway might contribute to the attenuation of HPH-induced RVH, and the mechanism may be related to the reduction of inflammation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and AKT phosphorylation.", "journal": "General physiology and biophysics", "date": "2022-10-13", "authors": ["HaixiaSun", "JunlingLiu", "YuxinSu", "FangLi", "MingyueZhang", "JiaLi", "MeilingSong"], "doi": "10.4149/gpb_2022032"}

Fibrosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular disorders, including heart failure and myocardial infarction. Several studies have identified fibroblasts, which are induced to differentiate into myofibroblasts in response to various types of damage, as the most important cell types involved in the fibrotic process. Some drugs, such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiac fibrosis. There are currently no drugs with primarily anti-fibrotic action approved for clinical use, as well as the evidence of a clinical efficacy of these drugs is extremely limited, despite the numerous encouraging results from experimental studies. A new approach is represented by the use of CAR-T cells engineered in vivo using lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA coding for a receptor directed against the FAP protein, expressed by cardiac myofibroblasts.

In this study, we induced a model of MI by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and we surprisingly found that BBR significantly improved ventricular remodeling, with a minor inflammatory and oxidative stress injury, and stronger angiogenesis. Moreover, BBR inhibited the secretion of Wnt5a/\u03b2-catenin pathway in macrophages after MI, thus promoting the differentiation of macrophages into M2 type. In summary, BBR effectively improved cardiac function of mice after MI, and the potential protective mechanism was associated with the regulation of inflammatory responses and the inhibition of macrophage Wnt5a/\u03b2-catenin pathway in the infarcted heart tissues.

Nowadays, there are no pharmacological treatments to directly ameliorate the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), given its relevance for both cognitive and cardiovascular function, could be a potential druggable target in this syndrome. We analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation in key phenotypes relevant for WBS. CD mice showed the characteristic hypersociable phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor short-term object-recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoid signaling modulation with subchronic (10 days) JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice. Notably, JZL184 treatment improved cardiovascular function and restored gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue. These results reveal the modulation of the ECS as a promising novel therapeutic approach to improve key phenotypic alterations in WBS.\nWilliams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare disorder that causes hyper-social behavior, intellectual disability, memory problems, and life-threatening overgrowth of the heart. Behavioral therapies can help improve the cognitive and social aspects of the syndrome and surgery is sometimes used to treat the effects on the heart, although often with limited success. However, there are currently no medications available to treat WBS. The endocannabinoid system \u2013 which consists of cannabis-like chemical messengers that bind to specific cannabinoid receptor proteins \u2013 has been shown to influence cognitive and social behaviors, as well as certain functions of the heart. This has led scientists to suspect that the endocannabinoid system may play a role in WBS, and drugs modifying this network of chemical messengers could help treat the rare condition. To investigate, Navarro-Romero, Galera-L\u00f3pez et al. studied mice which had the same genetic deletion found in patients with WBS. Similar to humans, the male mice displayed hyper-social behaviors, had memory deficits and enlarged hearts. Navarro-Romero, Galera-L\u00f3pez et al. found that these mutant mice also had differences in the function of the receptor protein cannabinoid type-1 (CB1).

{"title": "Allele-specific differential regulation of monoallelically expressed autosomal genes in the cardiac lineage.", "abstract": "Each mammalian autosomal gene is represented by two alleles in diploid cells. To our knowledge, no insights have been made in regard to allele-specific regulatory mechanisms of autosomes. Here we use allele-specific single cell transcriptomic analysis to elucidate the establishment of monoallelic gene expression in the cardiac lineage. We find that monoallelically expressed autosomal genes in mESCs and mouse blastocyst cells are differentially regulated based on the genetic background of the parental alleles. However, the genetic background of the allele does not affect the establishment of monoallelic genes in differentiated cardiomyocytes.

The study of ECC regulation has primarily been limited to cardiomyocytes (CMs), which conduct voltage waves via calcium fluxes from one cell to another, eliciting contraction of the atria followed by the ventricles. CMs rapidly transmit ionic flux via gap junction proteins, predominantly connexin 43. While the expression of connexin isoforms has been identified in each of the individual cell populations comprising the heart, the formation of gap junctions with nonmuscle cells (i.e., macrophages and Schwann cells) has gained new attention. Evaluating nonmuscle contributions to ECC in vivo or in situ remains difficult and necessitates the development of simple, yet biomimetic in vitro models to better understand and prevent physiological dysfunction. Standard 2D cell culture often consists of homogenous cell populations and lacks the dynamic mechanical environment of native tissue, confounding the phenotypic and proteomic makeup of these highly mechanosensitive cell populations in prolonged culture conditions.

{"title": "Therapeutic overexpression of miR-92a-2-5p ameliorated cardiomyocyte oxidative stress injury in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) results from pathological changes in cardiac structure and function caused by diabetes. Excessive oxidative stress is an important feature of DCM pathogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of oxidative stress in the cardiovascular system. In the present study, we screened for the expression of oxidative stress-responsive miRNAs in the development of DCM. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the mechanism and therapeutic potential of miR-92a-2-5p in preventing diabetes-induced myocardial damage.\nAn experimental type 2 diabetic (T2DM) rat model was induced using a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (30\u00a0mg/kg). Oxidative stress injury in cardiomyocytes was induced by high glucose (33\u00a0mmol/L). Oxidative stress-responsive miRNAs were screened by quantitative real-time PCR. Intervention with miR-92a-2-5p was accomplished by tail vein injection of agomiR in vivo or adenovirus transfection in vitro.\nThe expression of miR-92a-2-5p in the heart tissues was significantly decreased in the T2DM group. Decreased miR-92a-2-5p expression was also detected in high glucose-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of miR-92a-2-5p attenuated cardiomyocyte oxidative stress injury, as demonstrated by increased glutathione level, and reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation, malondialdehyde and apoptosis levels. MAPK interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MKNK2) was verified as a novel target of miR-92a-2-5p. Overexpression of miR-92a-2-5p in cardiomyocytes significantly inhibited MKNK2 expression, leading to decreased phosphorylation of p38-MAPK signaling, which, in turn, ameliorated cardiomyocyte oxidative stress injury. Additionally, diabetes-induced myocardial damage was significantly alleviated by the injection of miR-92a-2-5p agomiR, which manifested as a significant improvement in myocardial remodeling and function.\nmiR-92a-2-5p plays an important role in cardiac oxidative stress, and may serve as a therapeutic target in DCM.", "journal": "Cellular & molecular biology letters", "date": "2022-10-09", "authors": ["ManliYu", "YangyongSun", "XinghuaShan", "FanYang", "GuojunChu", "QianChen", "LinHan", "ZhifuGuo", "GuokunWang"], "doi": "10.1186/s11658-022-00379-9\n10.1016/0002-9149(72)90595-4\n10.1186/s12933-017-0506-x\n10.1007/s00125-017-4390-4\n10.1016/j.diabres.2013.11.002\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfq110\n10.1016/j.jchf.2014.08.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024593\n10.1016/j.tips.2018.02.010\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.102140\n10.1016/j.jcjd.2015.08.012\n10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311448\n10.1007/s00125-014-3171-6\n10.1155/2014/676758\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq013\n10.1186/s11658-022-00317-9\n10.3390/cells11060983\n10.1007/s00018-022-04177-6\n10.1038/s41467-021-25211-4\n10.1161/JAHA.121.023472\n10.1089/ars.2017.7328\n10.3390/ijms21010358\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.07.739\n10.1186/s12933-019-0964-4\n10.1002/jcp.30248\n10.1007/s12192-018-00957-x\n10.1093/nar/gkz757\n10.1126/science.aav1741\n10.1261/rna.5248604\n10.1155/2017/9308310\n10.1089/ars.2017.7005\n10.1089/hum.2018.059\n10.1002/jcp.27191\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv599\n10.3390/ijms20071635\n10.1186/s12872-021-01980-0\n10.1016/j.carpath.2015.06.003\n10.1093/nar/gky921\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.041\n10.1152/ajpcell.00137.2012\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.06.013\n10.1155/2021/8889195\n10.7554/eLife.54298\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.11.029\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.047\n10.1172/JCI140752\n10.1038/s41388-021-01661-4\n10.1007/s00018-020-03491-1\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00368\n10.1016/j.molmet.2020.101054\n10.1038/srep23476\n10.1186/s13046-021-01877-y\n10.1038/s41569-022-00718-5\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.11.013"}
{"title": "Epicardial delivery of a conductive membrane synchronizes conduction to reduce atrial fibrillation.", "abstract": "Conductive polymers have been investigated as a medium for the transmission of electrical signals in biological tissues, but their capacity to rewire cardiac tissue has not been evaluated. Myocardial tissue is unique in being able to generate an electrical potential at a fixed rate; this potential spreads rapidly among cells to trigger muscle contractions. Tissue injuries result in myocardial fibrosis and subsequent non-uniform conductivity, leading to arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, associated with disruption of atrial electrical signaling, which can potentially be restored by the epicardial delivery of conductive polymers. In this work, poly-3-amino-4-methoxybenzoic acid, conjugated to gelatin, is fabricated as a membrane (PAMB-G) to support conductive velocities that are close to that of the myocardium. A cross-linked gelatin membrane (Gelatin) is used as a control. The as-fabricated PAMB-G has similar tensile elasticities, determined using the Young's modulus, as contracting myocardium; it can also transmit electrical signals to initiate cardiac cell and tissue excitation. Delivering PAMB-G onto the atrium of a rat AF model shortens AF duration and improves post-AF recovery for the duration of a 28-day-long study. Atrial tissue in the PAMB-G-implanted group has lower impedance, higher conduction velocity, and higher field potential amplitude than that in the Gelatin-implanted group. Therefore, the as-proposed PAMB-G is a suitable medium for restoring proper cardiac electrical signaling in AF hearts.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2022-10-08", "authors": ["Yi-ChongZhang", "Min-YaoWang", "Chong-YuZhang", "Yun-FeiFan", "JunWu", "Shu-HongLi", "AnneFu", "YuSun", "Terrance MYau", "Ting-HsuanLu", "Hsing-WenSung", "Ren-KeLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.09.062"}
{"title": "Eicosapentaenoic Acid Ameliorates Cardiac Fibrosis and Tissue Inflammation in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats.", "abstract": "Hypertension affects 1 in 3 adults in the United States and leads to left ventricular (LV) concentric hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and increased stiffness. The treatment of cardiac fibrosis remains challenging and empiric. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that is highly effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients and cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy in animals when administered before pressure overload by promoting the increase of anti-inflammatory M1 macrophages. In this study, we investigated whether EPA mitigates the exacerbation of cardiac remodeling and fibrosis induced by established hypertension, a situation that closely recapitulates a clinical scenario. Twelve-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomized to eat an EPA-enriched or control diet for 20\u00a0weeks. We report that rats eating the EPA-enriched diet exhibited a reduction of interstitial cardiac fibrosis and ameliorated LV diastolic dysfunction despite the continuous increase in blood pressure. However, we found that EPA did not have an impact on cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, the EPA diet increased mRNA expression of M2 macrophage marker Mrc1 and interleukin-10 in cardiac tissue. These findings indicated that the antifibrotic effects of EPA are mediated in part by phenotypic polarization of macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages and increases of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10. In summary, EPA prevents the exacerbation of cardiac fibrosis and LV diastolic dysfunction during sustained pressure overload.

This research is aimed at examining the effects of lcz696 and its target molecules on myocardial infarction (MI). A rat model of MI was induced by left anterior descending artery ligation and treated with lcz696. Lcz696 treatment significantly reduced cardiac injury and heart failure, restored the left ventricular fractional shortening and ejection fraction, and reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in rat myocardium. By analyzing the heart failure-related GSE47495 dataset and performing gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis, we obtained histone lysine methyltransferase SUV39H1 and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) as two molecules implicated in the oxidative stress and inflammation processes. An elevation of SUV39H1 whereas a decline of SPP1 were detected in cardiac tissues after lcz696 treatment. Enrichments of SUV39H1 and H3K9me3 at the SPP1 promoter were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. SUV39H1 catalyzed H3K9me3 modification to suppress the expression of SPP1. Preconditioning of SUV39H1 silencing blocked the protective roles of lcz696, but SPP1 silencing alleviated the myocardial injury.

In our experiments, we performed label-free quantitative SWATH-MS proteomic analysis of the adult myocardial slices in vitro after biomimetic electromechanical stimulation. Rat myocardial slices were stretched to sarcomere lengths (SL) within the physiological range of 1.8-2.2\u00a0\u03bcm.

Several qualitative and quantitative techniques are used to determine the subcellular localization of proteins. One of the emerging techniques in determining the subcellular localization of a protein is quantum dots (QD)-mediated immunolabeling of a protein followed by imaging them with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). QD is a semiconductor nanocrystal with a dual property of crystalline structure and high electron density, which makes them applicable to electron microscopy. This current method visualized the subcellular localization of Sigma 1 receptor (Sigmar1) protein using QD-TEM in the heart tissue at ultrastructural level. Small cubes of the heart tissue sections from a wild-type mouse were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, subsequently osmicated, stained with uranyl acetate, followed by sequential dehydration with ethanol and acetone. These dehydrated heart tissue sections were embedded in low-viscosity epoxy resins, cut into thin sections of 500 nm thickness, put on the grid, and subsequently subjected to antigen unmasking with 5% sodium metaperiodate, followed by quenching of the residual aldehydes with glycine. The tissues were blocked, followed by sequential incubation in primary antibody, biotinylated secondary antibody, and streptavidin-conjugated QD. These stained sections were blot dried and imaged at high magnification using TEM. The QD-TEM technique allowed the visualization of Sigmar1 protein's\u00a0subcellular localization at the ultrastructural level in the heart.

When processing is perturbed, nuclear accumulation of prelamin A is toxic and causes laminopathic diseases such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and cardiomyopathy. However, the physiological role of prelamin A is largely unknown and we sought to identify novel insights about this. Using rodent heart tissue, primary cells and the C2C12 model of myofibrillogenesis, we investigated the expression and localization patterns of prelamin A in heart and skeletal muscle cells. We found that endogenous prelamin A was detectable in mouse heart localized to the sarcomere in both adult mouse heart and isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. We investigated the regulation of prelamin A in C2C12 myofibrillogenesis and found it was dynamically regulated and organized into striations upon myofibril formation, colocalizing with the Z-disc protein \u03b1-actinin. These data provide evidence that prelamin A is a component of the sarcomere, underpinning a physiological purpose for unprocessed prelamin A.

{"title": "Stochastic termination of spiral wave dynamics in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Rotating spiral waves are self-organized features in spatially extended excitable media and may play an important role in cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation (AF). In homogeneous media, spiral wave dynamics are perpetuated through spiral wave breakup, leading to the continuous birth and death of spiral waves, but have a finite probability of termination. In non-homogeneous media, however, heterogeneities can act as anchoring sources that result in sustained spiral wave activity. It is thus unclear how and if AF may terminate following the removal of putative spiral wave sources in patients. Here, we address this question using computer simulations in which a stable spiral wave is trapped by an heterogeneity and is surrounded by spiral wave breakup.

This study aims to analyze the biomaterials thermal properties with different thicknesses, by testing the response to bipolar and unipolar RFA on porcine muscle samples (PMS), expressed in temperature. For the materials evaluation, the tissue temperature during RFA applications was recorded, firstly without (control) and after with the biomaterials in position. The biomaterials were considered suitable for the RFA treatment if: (1) the PMS temperatures with the samples were not statistically different compared with the control; (2) the temperatures never reached the threshold; (3) no geometrical changes after RFA were observed.\nBased on these criteria, none of the tested biomaterials resulted appropriate for unipolar RFA and the TPU95A failed almost all thermal tests also with the bipolar RFA. The 1.0 mm MED625FLX was modified by bipolar RFA in shape, losing its function. Instead, the 2.5 mm MED625FLX was considered suitable for bipolar RFA catheter use only.\nThe 2.5 mm MED625FLX could be used, in the design of surgical guides for RFA bipolar catheter only, because of mechanical, geometrical, and thermal properties.

{"title": "The Genetics of Neurodevelopment in Congenital Heart Disease.", "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth anomaly, affecting almost 1% of infants. Neurodevelopmental delay is the most common extracardiac feature in people with CHD. Many factors may contribute to neurodevelopmental risk, including genetic factors, CHD physiology, and the prenatal/postnatal environment. Damaging variants are most highly enriched among individuals with extracardiac anomalies or neurodevelopmental delay in addition to CHD, indicating that genetic factors have an impact beyond cardiac tissues in people with CHD. Potential sources of genetic risk include large deletions or duplications that affect multiple genes, such as 22q11 deletion syndrome, single genes that alter both heart and brain development, such as CHD7, and common variants that affect neurodevelopmental resiliency, such as APOE. Increased use of genome-sequencing technologies in studies of neurodevelopmental outcomes in people with CHD will improve our ability to detect relevant genes and variants.

There is currently a clear need to identify novel mediators of cardiac fibrosis to facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies targeting cardiac fibrosis. Integrin subunit \u03b2-like 1 (ITGBL1), an extracellular matrix protein, has previously been implicated in various fibrotic diseases. However, the precise role of ITGBL1 in regulating myocardial fibrosis remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether ITGBL1 regulates angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced myocardial fibrosis in vitro and in vivo and the possible mechanism of action. It was found that the protein expressions of ITGBL1, Forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), and Snail were all increased significantly in fibrotic heart tissues from Ang II-infused mice and Ang II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts, all of which were inhibited by the Ang II type I (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan. Silencing the ITGBL1/FOXQ1/Snail axis with specific siRNAs reversed Ang II-induced fibrotic effects and upregulation of FOXQ1 and Snail expressions in cardiac fibroblasts. FOXQ1 siRNA inhibited Snail expression in Ang II-induced cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, ITGBL1/FOXQ1 interacted with the TGF-\u03b21 signaling to form a positive feedback loop. Our findings suggest that the extracellular matrix protein ITGBL1 mediates Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis via the FOXQ1/Snail axis, which identifies ITGBL1 as a novel mediator of cardiac fibrosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2022-10-03", "authors": ["HuiZhu", "HongxueJi", "WeimingChen", "LuHan", "LiangzhuYu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2022.109422"}

This work studied the function of IRX2 and its related molecules in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\nA GEO dataset GSE32453 was analyzed to identify aberrantly expressed genes in HCM. Altered expression of IRX2 was induced in mice by lentivirus injection, followed by angiotensin II (Ang II) treatment to induce HCM. The function of IRX2 knockdown in ventricular dysfunction, heart volume and pathological changes in mice, and in surface area, oxidative stress and apoptosis of isolated cardiomyocytes were examined. Binding relationship between jumonji domain-containing protein 2A (JMJD2A) and IRX2 was predicted by online tools and validated. The interaction between JMJD2A and IRX2 in HCM development was examined by joint interventions.\nIRX2 was highly expressed in heart tissues with HCM. IRX2 knockdown prevented mice from Ang II-induced ventricular dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation and fibrosis in mouse heart, and it decreased the levels of cardiac hypertrophy-related markers, oxidative stress response, and apoptosis of Ang II-treated cardiomyocytes. JMJD2A catalyzed demethylation of H3K9me3 near the IRX2 promoter to activate its transcription. JMJD2A knockdown similarly exerted protective functions against cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro, but the protection was blocked upon further IRX2 upregulation.

However, the clinical usage of doxorubicin has been hampered by its severe cardiotoxic side effects leading to heart failure. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the major aetiologies of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The morphology of mitochondria is highly dynamic, governed by two opposing processes known as fusion and fission, collectively known as mitochondrial dynamics. An imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics is often reported in tumourigenesis which can lead to adaptive and acquired resistance to chemotherapy. Drp1 is a key mitochondrial fission regulator, and emerging evidence has demonstrated that Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is upregulated in both cancer cells to their survival advantage and injured heart tissue in the setting of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

Recent advances in TE have led to the development of suitable scaffold architecture for various tissue defects.\nGiven the importance of cellular therapy, it was the aim of the present study to differentiate cardio myocyte cells from human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) using suitable induction reagents (namely, 5-azacytidine and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2)) on poly-caprolactone (PCL)/Poly aniline (PANI) Nano fibrous scaffolds prepared by electrospinning.\nFor this purpose, the adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) were initially isolated and characterized before cultivation on the PCL/PANI Nano fibrous scaffold to be treated for 21 days with 5-azacytidine either singly or in combination with TGF-\u03b2 in medium. The scaffold's morphological and cell attachment properties were investigated using electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, the cardio myocyte differentiation of Ad-MSCs on the scaffold was studied using both quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) and flow-cytometry while the expression rates of the cardio myocytes' specific genes (Gata4, NKX2.5, MYH-7, and Troponin I) were also determined.\nThe results of Ad-MSCs culture, MTT assay, and SEM indicated that the cells had well proliferated on the PCL/PANI scaffolds, showing the biocompatibility of the nanofibers for cellular growth and adhesion. After 21 days of induced cardio myocyte differentiation by both agents, Real-time PCR revealed increases in the expressions of Gata4, Troponin I, MYH-7, and NKX2.5 genes in the cells cultured on the PCL/PANI scaffolds while the flow-cytometry test approved the expression of troponin I.\nThe data obtained showed that the PCL/PANI Nano fibrous scaffolds were able to promote and support mesenchymal stem cell transformation to cardio myocyte cells. Generally speaking, the results of the study might be exploited in future ", "journal": "Iranian journal of biotechnology", "date": "2022-10-01", "authors": ["ParastooTambrchi", "MortezaDaliriJoupari", "Amir HosseinMahdavi", "LeilaSoltani"], "doi": "10.30498/ijb.2022.316370.3205\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.191261\n10.1038/s41598-020-70547-4\n10.1007/s10856-020-06425-2\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1007/s12015-013-9487-7\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.08.003\n10.1016/j.arr.2010.08.005\n10.1186/s40001-017-0258-9\n10.1016/s0003-4975(02)04568-x\n10.1080/14653240600621125\n10.1091/mbc.e02-02-0105\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2007.09.003\n10.1038/s41598-018-22301-0\n10.3892/br.2013.70\n10.1002/jbm.a.36501\n10.1002/cbf.3187\n10.1155/2016/3816256\n10.1021/acsami.6b15271\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.06.036\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.065\n10.1039/C3TB00151B\n10.1007/s10856-011-4259-x\n10.1016/0092-8674(84)90274-5\n10.1111/j.1423-0410.2008.01076.x\n10.5405/jmbe.1356\n10.1007/s40846-015-0054-3\n10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.044\n10.1089/scd.2010.0519\n10.1126/science.3487831\n10.1002/cbf.1547\n10.1007/s11626-013-9597-1\n10.15406/jsrt.2017.03.00088\n10.3892/etm.2018.6105"}

The presence of virus in cardiac tissue of patients with COVID-19 suggests this is a direct, rather than secondary, effect of infection. Here, by expressing individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the Drosophila heart, we demonstrate interaction of virus Nsp6 with host proteins of the MGA/MAX complex (MGA, PCGF6 and TFDP1). Complementing transcriptomic data from the fly heart reveal that this interaction blocks the antagonistic MGA/MAX complex, which shifts the balance towards MYC/MAX and activates glycolysis-with similar findings in mouse cardiomyocytes. Further, the Nsp6-induced glycolysis disrupts cardiac mitochondrial function, known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in heart failure; this could explain COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology. Inhibiting the glycolysis pathway by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) treatment attenuates the Nsp6-induced cardiac phenotype in flies and mice.

Disease-causing factors include metabolic risk, notably obesity. However, proteomic changes in HFpEF are poorly understood, hampering therapeutic strategies. We sought to elucidate how metabolic syndrome affects cardiac protein expression, phosphorylation and acetylation in the Zucker diabetic fatty/Spontaneously hypertensive heart failure F1 (ZSF1) rat HFpEF model, and to evaluate changes regarding their potential for treatment.\nZSF1 obese and lean rats were fed a Purina diet up to the onset of HFpEF in the obese animals. We quantified the proteome, phosphoproteome and acetylome of ZSF1 obese versus lean heart tissues by mass spectrometry and singled out targets for site-specific evaluation.\nThe acetylome of ZSF1 obese versus lean hearts was more severely altered (21\u00a0% of proteins changed) than the phosphoproteome (9\u00a0%) or proteome (3\u00a0%). Proteomic alterations, confirmed by immunoblotting, indicated low-grade systemic inflammation and endothelial remodeling in obese hearts, but low nitric oxide-dependent oxidative/nitrosative stress. Altered acetylation in ZSF1 obese hearts mainly affected pathways important for metabolism, energy production and mechanical function, including hypo-acetylation of mechanical proteins but hyper-acetylation of proteins regulating fatty acid metabolism. Hypo-acetylation and hypo-phosphorylation of elastic titin in ZSF1 obese hearts could explain myocardial stiffening.\nCardiometabolic syndrome alters posttranslational modifications, notably acetylation, in experimental HFpEF.

However, it is challenging due to the complex distribution of various tissues and organs in cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) slices, low discriminative and large spanning organs. To handle these problems, a two-stage CNN (convolutional neural network) segmentation method based on the combination of Log-Gabor filter attention mechanism and metric classification is proposed. The Log-Gabor filterbank is applied to selectively enhance the texture information and contour information of each tissue and organ, and the spatial and channel attention mechanism jointly with the varying kernel size of Log-Gabor filterbank is incorporated into the codec structure to adaptively extract target features of different sizes and focus on the discriminative features in the network. To solve the problem of insufficient segmentation on subtle and adherent edges involving different tissues, a metric classification network is incorporated to finely optimize the hard-to-be-segmented boundaries. The proposed method was tested on cardiac MRI data set to segment 7 cardiac tissues, and the rationality and effectiveness of the method were verified.

{"title": "Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Encapsulation Geometry Impacts Three-Dimensional Developing Human Engineered Cardiac Tissue Functionality.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering has been working to alleviate the immense burden of cardiovascular disease for several decades. To improve cardiac tissue homogeneity and cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation, in this study, we investigated altering initial encapsulation geometry in a three-dimensional (3D) direct cardiac differentiation platform. Traditional engineered cardiac tissue production utilizes predifferentiated CMs to produce 3D cardiac tissue and often involves various cell selection and exogenous stimulation methods to promote CM maturation. Starting tissue formation directly with human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), rather than predifferentiated CMs, simplifies the engineered cardiac tissue formation process, making it more applicable for widespread implementation and scale-up. In this study, hiPSCs were encapsulated in poly (ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen in three tissue geometries (disc-shaped microislands, squares, and rectangles) and subjected to established cardiac differentiation protocols. Resulting 3D engineered cardiac tissues (3D-ECTs) from each geometry displayed similar CM populations (\u223c65%) and gene expression over time. Notably, rectangular tissues displayed less tissue heterogeneity and suggested more advanced features of maturing CMs, including myofibrillar alignment and Z-line formation. In addition, rectangular tissue showed significantly higher anisotropic contractile properties compared to square and microisland tissues (MI 0.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03, SQ 0.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, RT 0.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04). This study demonstrates a straightforward method for simplifying and improving 3D-ECT production without the use of exogenous mechanical or electrical pacing and has the potential to be utilized in bioprinting and drug testing applications. Impact statement Current methods for improving cardiac maturation postdifferentiation remain tedious and complex. In this study, we examined the impact of initial encapsulation geometry on improvement of three-dimensional engineered cardiac tissue (3D-ECT) production and postdifferentiation maturation for three tissue geometries, including disc-shaped microislands, squares, and rectangles.

{"title": "Isoginkgetin, a bioactive constituent from Ginkgo Biloba, protects against obesity-induced cardiomyopathy via enhancing Nrf2/ARE signaling.", "abstract": "Obesity-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy (MC), characterized by lipotoxicity and excessive oxidative stress, emerges as the leading cause of heart failure in the obese patients. Yet, its therapy remains very limited. Here, we demonstrated that isoginkgetin (IGK), a bioactive biflavonoid isolated from medicinal herb Ginkgo Biloba, protected against obesity-induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction and adverse remodeling. Transcriptomics profiling revealed that IGK activated Nrf2 signaling in the heart tissues of the obese mice. Consistent with this observation, IGK treatment increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which in turn trigger the activation of its downstream target genes (e. g. HO-1 and NQO1). In addition, IGK significantly rejuvenated mitochondrial defects in obese heart tissues as evidenced by enhancing mitochondrial respiratory capacity and resisting the collapse of mitochondrial potential and oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, IGK stabilized Nrf2 protein via inhibiting the proteasomal degradation, independent of transcription regulation. Moreover, molecular docking and dynamics simulation assessment demonstrated a good binding mode between IGK and Nrf2/Keap1. Of note, the protective effects conferred by IGK against obesity-induced mitochondrial defects and cardiac dysfunction was compromised by Nrf2 gene silencing both in vitro and in vivo, consolidating a pivotal role of Nrf2 in IGK-elicited myocardial protection against MC. Thus, the present study identifies IGK as a promising drug candidate to alleviate obesity-induced oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte damage through Nrf2 activation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of IGK in ameliorating obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2022-09-27", "authors": ["XiaoqianWu", "JianrongHuang", "JunyuanTang", "YulingSun", "GuojunZhao", "CuishiYan", "ZhenghongLiu", "WeiYi", "SuowenXu", "XiyongYu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2022.102485\n10.1080/21655979.2021.1997564"}

Biological sex is a critical determinant of the occurrence, progression and overall outcome of CVD. However, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. A hallmark of CVD is cell death. Based on the inability of the human heart to regenerate, loss of functional cardiac tissue can lead to irreversible detrimental effects. Here, we summarize current knowledge on how biological sex affects cell death-related mechanisms in CVD. Initially, we discuss apoptosis and necrosis, but we specifically focus on the relatively newly recognized programmed necrosis-like processes: pyroptosis and necroptosis. We also discuss the role of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) in these processes, particularly in terms of inhibiting pyroptotic and necroptotic signaling.

{"title": "Diabetes disturbs functional adaptation of the remote myocardium after ischemia/reperfusion.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus type 2 is associated with adverse clinical outcome after myocardial infarction. To better understand the underlying causes we here investigated sarcomere protein function and its calcium-dependent regulation in the non-ischemic remote myocardium (RM) of diabetic mice (db/db) after transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Before and 24\u00a0h after surgery db/db and non-diabetic db/+ underwent magnetic resonance imaging followed by histological and biochemical analyses of heart tissue. Intracellular calcium transients and sarcomere function were measured in isolated cardiomyocytes. Active and passive force generation was assessed in skinned fibers and papillary muscle preparations. Before ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), beat-to-beat calcium cycling was depressed in diabetic cardiomyocytes. Nevertheless, contractile function was preserved owing to increased myofilament calcium sensitivity and higher responsiveness of myocardial force production to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation in db/db compared to db/+. In addition, protein kinase C activity was elevated in db/db hearts leading to strong phosphorylation of the titin PEVK region and increased titin-based tension of myofilaments. I/R impaired the function of whole hearts and RM sarcomeres in db/db to a larger extent than in non-diabetic db/+, and we identified several reasons. First, the amplitude and the kinetics of cardiomyocyte calcium transients were further reduced in the RM of db/db. Underlying causes involved altered expression of calcium regulatory proteins. Diabetes and I/R additively reduced phospholamban S16-phosphorylation by 80% (P\u00a0<\u00a0000.1) leading to strong inhibition of the calcium ATPase SERCA2a. Second, titin stiffening was only observed in the RM of db/+, but not in the RM of db/db. Finally, db/db myofilament calcium sensitivity and force generation upon \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation were no longer enhanced over db/+ in the RM. The findings demonstrate that impaired cardiomyocyte calcium cycling of db/db hearts is compensated by increased myofilament calcium sensitivity and increased titin-based stiffness prior to I/R. In contrast, sarcomere function of the RM 24\u00a0h after I/R is poor because both these compensatory mechanisms fail and myocyte calcium handling is further depressed.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["FlorianFunk", "AnnetteKronenbitter", "MalgorzataIsi\u0107", "VeraFlocke", "SimoneGorre\u00dfen", "DominikSemmler", "MaximilianBrinkmann", "KatharinaBeck", "OliverSteinhoff", "TanuSrivastava", "David MonteiroBarbosa", "KatharinaVoigt", "LuzhouWang", "KatharinaBottermann", "SebastianK\u00f6tter", "MariaGrandoch", "UlrichFl\u00f6gel", "MartinaKr\u00fcger", "Joachim PSchmitt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.09.002"}

The pathophysiological interplay between the heart and kidneys is defined as the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), in which worsening of kidney function is represented by increased plasma concentrations of uremic toxins (UTs), culminating in dialysis patients. As there is a high incidence of CVD in CKD patients, accompanied by arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, knowledge on electrophysiological remodeling would be instrumental for understanding the CRS. While the interplay between both organs is clearly of importance in CRS, the involvement of UTs in pro-arrhythmic remodeling is only poorly investigated, especially regarding the mechanistic background. Currently, the clinical approach against potential arrhythmic events is mainly restricted to symptom treatment, stressing the need for fundamental research on UT in relation to electrophysiology. This review addresses the existing knowledge of UTs and cardiac electrophysiology, and the experimental research gap between fundamental research and clinical research of the CRS. Clinically, mainly absorbents like ibuprofen and AST-120 are studied, which show limited safe and efficient usability. Experimental research shows disturbances in cardiac electrical activation and conduction after inducing CKD or exposure to UTs, but are scarcely present or focus solely on already well-investigated UTs. Based on UTs data derived from CKD patient cohort studies, a clinically relevant overview of physiological and pathological UTs concentrations is created.

Molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from acute VMC (aVMC), to chronic VMC (cVMC) and finally to DCM, are still unclear. Here, we established mouse models of VMC and DCM with Coxsackievirus B3 infection and conducted NMR-based metabolomic analysis of aqueous metabolites extracted from cardiac tissues of three histologically classified groups including aVMC, cVMC and DCM. We showed that these three pathological groups were metabolically distinct from their normal counterparts and identified three impaired metabolic pathways shared by these pathological groups relative to normal controls, including nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; and D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism. We also identified two extra impaired metabolic pathways in the aVMC group, including glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism Furthermore, we identified potential cardiac biomarkers for metabolically distinguishing these three pathological stages from normal controls.

{"title": "Fucoidan Protects against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity by Reducing Oxidative Stress and Preventing Mitochondrial Function Injury.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOXO) is a potent chemotherapeutic drug widely used to treat various cancers. However, its clinical application is limited due to serious adverse effects on dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Although the underlying mechanism has not been fully clarified, DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity has been mainly attributed to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes. Fucoidan, as a kind of sulphated polysaccharide existing in numerous brown seaweed, has potent anti-oxidant, immune-regulatory, anti-tumor, anti-coagulate and anti-viral activities. Here, we explore the potential protective role and mechanism of fucoidan in DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Our results show that oral fucoidan supplement exerts potent protective effects against DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress and preventing mitochondrial function injury. The improved effect of fucoidan on DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity was evaluated by echocardiography, cardiac myocytes size and cardiac fibrosis analysis, and the expression of genes related to cardiac dysfunction and remodeling. Fucoidan reduced the ROS content and the MDA levels but enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes GSH-PX and SOD in the mouse serum in a DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity model. In addition, fucoidan also increased the ATP production capacity and restored the levels of a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex in heart tissue.

{"title": "Identification of Adipose Tissue as a Reservoir of Macrophages after Acute Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Medullary and extra-medullary hematopoiesis has been shown to govern inflammatory cell infiltration and subsequently cardiac remodeling and function after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Emerging evidence positions adipose tissue (AT) as an alternative source of immune cell production. We, therefore, hypothesized that AT could act as a reservoir of inflammatory cells that participate in cardiac homeostasis after MI. To reveal the distinct role of inflammatory cells derived from AT or bone marrow (BM), chimeric mice were generated using standard repopulation assays. We showed that AMI increased the number of AT-derived macrophages in the cardiac tissue. These macrophages exhibit pro-inflammatory characteristics and their specific depletion improved cardiac function as well as decreased infarct size and interstitial fibrosis. We then reasoned that the alteration of AT-immune compartment in type 2 diabetes could, thus, contribute to defects in cardiac remodeling. However, in these conditions, myeloid cells recruited in the infarcted heart mainly originate from the BM, and AT was no longer used as a myeloid cell reservoir. Altogether, we showed here that a subpopulation of cardiac inflammatory macrophages emerges from myeloid cells of AT origin and plays a detrimental role in cardiac remodeling and function after MI. Diabetes abrogates the ability of AT-derived myeloid cells to populate the infarcted heart.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["IngridGomez", "VirginieRobert", "PaulAlayrac", "Ad\u00e8leArlat", "VincentDuval", "Marie-LaureRenoud", "Jos\u00e9Vilar", "MathildeLemitre", "Jean-S\u00e9bastienSilvestre", "B\u00e9atriceCousin"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms231810498\n10.1182/blood-2009-05-219923\n10.1182/blood-2012-01-406959\n10.1016/j.biochi.2015.06.012\n10.1038/s41536-021-00151-1\n10.1002/stem.523\n10.1084/jem.20160081\n10.7554/eLife.23194\n10.1093/cvr/cvz336\n10.1084/jem.20070885\n10.1126/science.1175202\n10.1084/jem.20111009\n10.1172/JCI59643\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020857\n10.1371/journal.pone.0120739\n10.1007/s00125-013-2918-9\n10.1124/jpet.112.200808\n10.1016/j.cmet.2013.04.001\n10.1002/0471142735.im22b02s80\n10.1152/ajpendo.00332.2001\n10.1016/j.coi.2020.09.005\n10.1016/j.immuni.2020.02.015\n10.1093/cvr/cvu025\n10.1038/s41591-018-0059-x\n10.1126/sciimmunol.abf7777\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.01.006\n10.1038/s41586-022-05060-x\n10.1038/s41467-017-02425-z\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00528\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.315913\n10.1023/A:1015328625394\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034545\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa028"}

There is currently no approved treatment for CCC; however, omics technologies have enabled significant progress to be made in the search for new therapeutic targets. The metabolic alterations associated with pathogenic mechanisms of CCC and their relationship to cellular and immunopathogenic processes in cardiac tissue remain largely unknown.

{"title": "Cell-Based and Selected Cell-Free Therapies for Myocardial Infarction: How Do They Compare to the Current Treatment Options?", "abstract": "Because of cardiomyocyte death or dysfunction frequently caused by myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in modern society. Paradoxically, only limited and non-curative therapies for heart failure or MI are currently available. As a result, over the past two decades research has focused on developing cell-based approaches promoting the regeneration of infarcted tissue. Cell-based therapies for myocardial regeneration include powerful candidates, such as multipotent stem cells (mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), bone-marrow-derived stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and hematopoietic stem cells) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These possess unique properties, such as potency to differentiate into desired cell types, proliferation capacity, and patient specificity. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated modest improvement in the myocardial regeneration and reduced infarcted areas upon transplantation of pluripotent or multipotent stem cells. Another cell population that need to be considered as a potential source for cardiac regeneration are telocytes found in different organs, including the heart. Their therapeutic effect has been studied in various heart pathologies, such as MI, arrhythmias, or atrial amyloidosis. The most recent cell-free therapeutic tool relies on the cardioprotective effect of complex cargo carried by small membrane-bound vesicles-exosomes-released from stem cells via exocytosis. The MSC/iPSC-derived exosomes could be considered a novel exosome-based therapy for cardiovascular diseases thanks to their unique content. There are also other cell-free approaches, e.g., gene therapy, or acellular cardiac patches. Therefore, our review provides the most recent insights into the novel strategies for myocardial repair based on the regenerative potential of different cell types and cell-free approaches.",

Atherosclerosis and prothrombotic states involve inflammation and non-cardiac tissue damage that may play active roles in SCD development. Therefore, we hypothesized that circulating proteins implicated in inflammation and tissue damage are linked to the future risk of SCD. We conducted a prospective nested case-control study of SCD cases with verified myocardial infarction (N = 224) and matched controls without myocardial infarction (N = 224), aged 60 \u00b1 10 years time and median time to event was 8 years. Protein concentrations (N = 122) were measured using a proximity extension immunoassay. The analyses revealed 14 proteins significantly associated with an increased risk of SCD, from which two remained significant after adjusting for smoking status, systolic blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, and glucose levels.

{"title": "Addition of oh8dG to Cardioplegia Attenuated Myocardial Oxidative Injury through the Inhibition of Sodium Bicarbonate Cotransporter Activity.", "abstract": "The biomarker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (oh8dG) is derived from oxidized nucleic acids or products of oxidant-mediated DNA damage. Enhanced sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) activity is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in ventricular myocytes. Thus, we hypothesized that cardioplegia-solution-mediated ROS generation may be involved in the regulation of NBC activity in cardiomyocytes and that oh8dG treatment may modulate ROS and associated NBC activity. Langendorff-free cardioplegia-arrested cardiac strips and cardiomyocytes were isolated to determine the NBC activity and effects of oh8dG on oxidative-stress-mediated cardiac damage markers. We first determined the histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution mediated NBC activity in cardiac strips and cells. The oh8dG treatment attenuated NBC activity in the electroneutral or electrogenic form of NBC. Additionally, exposure to HTK solution induced ROS, whereas co-administration of oh8dG attenuated ROS-mediated NBC activity, reduced ROS levels, and decreased the expression of apoptotic markers and fibrosis-associated proteins in cardiac cells.

{"title": "Synergetic Effect of Lupeol and Naringin Against Bile Duct Ligation Induced Cardiac Injury in Rats via Modulating Nitrite Level (eNos) and NF-kB /p65 Expression.", "abstract": "Cardiac dysfunction such as cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is more common in liver cirrhosis related disorders including primary biliary cholangitis or biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Bile duct ligation (BDL) is an effective model of biliary cholestasis, producing oxidative damage and fibrosis. This research was designed to evaluate the effect of Lupeol and Naringin and its combination on bile duct ligation induced cardiac injury in rats. For pharmacological evaluation, rats were randomly divided into seven groups; intrahepatic cholestasis induced by ligation of the bile duct might lead to cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. The results were analyzed by physical, biochemical and histological examination. The Lupeol (100\u2009mg/kg, p.o.), Naringin (100\u2009mg/kg, p.o.) and its combination (100\u2009mg/kg each) treated group significantly improved physical infarct size, biochemical (Nitrite, SOD, CAT, and GSH) and histological (heart tissue- mitochondrial function/integrity and fibrosis) alterations occurs due to BDL-ligation. This study was concluded that oral administration of Lupeol, Naringin, and its combination has a curative potential against BDL-induced cardiac injury in rats by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions, resulting in reduced heart necrosis/myocardial infarction and increased myocardial activity. It also inhibits cardiac damage in the rat heart, these effects may be linked to the NO level (eNOS) is increased and the inactivation of the NF-kB-p65 expression pathways.This study also provides new insights into the development of lupeol and Naringin combination that can be used as supportive therapy for cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Drug research", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["FirojAlam", "Anil KumarKharya", "Ritesh KumarSrivastav", "JuberAkhtar", "Mohammad IrfanKhan", "MohammadAhmad"], "doi": "10.1055/a-1879-2944"}

{"title": "Topographic Orientation of Scaffolds for Tissue Regeneration: Recent Advances in Biomaterial Design and Applications.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering to develop alternatives for the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of injured tissues and organs is gaining more and more attention. In tissue engineering, the scaffold used is one of the most critical elements. Its characteristics are expected to mimic the native extracellular matrix and its unique topographical structures. Recently, the topographies of scaffolds have received increasing attention, not least because different topographies, such as aligned and random, have different repair effects on various tissues. In this review, we have focused on various technologies (electrospinning, directional freeze-drying, magnetic freeze-casting, etching, and 3-D printing) to fabricate scaffolds with different topographic orientations, as well as discussed the physicochemical (mechanical properties, porosity, hydrophilicity, and degradation) and biological properties (morphology, distribution, adhesion, proliferation, and migration) of different topographies. Subsequently, we have compiled the effect of scaffold orientation on the regeneration of vessels, skin, neural tissue, bone, articular cartilage, ligaments, tendons, cardiac tissue, corneas, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle. The compiled information in this review will facilitate the future development of optimal topographical scaffolds for the regeneration of certain tissues. In the majority of tissues, aligned scaffolds are more suitable than random scaffolds for tissue repair and regeneration.

In this review, we examine the important role of PAK1 in the programmed death (apoptosis, autophagy, and pyroptosis) of cardiomyocytes, and its involvement in oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, which are based on mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium homeostasis imbalance. We also summarize the related signaling pathways through which PAK1 may cause oxidative stress and inflammatory response in cardiotoxicity, and discuss the PAK1-mediated contributions of the gut microbiome and micro RNAs to cardiotoxicity.

Potassium oxonate suppresses uric acid degradation to increase extracellular concentration, while hypoxanthine is the catalytic substrate of XO. We aimed to observe cardiac damage in a chronic HUA mouse model induced by potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine. The mouse model was established by the co-administration of potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine for eight\u2009weeks. Then, left ventricular parameters were examined by echocardiographic evaluation, and the heart tissues were harvested for further histopathological analysis. The results showed that plasma uric acid was persistently elevated in the model mice, which demonstrated the stable establishment of chronic HUA. The left ventricular anterior wall was significantly thickened in the model group compared with the blank control group. After the end of modeling, the left ventricular anterior wall thickness of the hyperuricemic mice increased compared with that of blank group. The histological analysis showed and myocardial structure disorganization in the model group compared with the blank control. The above cardiac impairment changes could be attenuated by allopurinol pretreatment. This study systematically assessed cardiac damage in a chronic HUA mouse model.

{"title": "Lipid-independent activation of a muscle-specific PKC\u03b1 splicing variant.", "abstract": "Protein kinase C-\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) plays a major role in a diverse range of cellular processes. Studies to date have defined the regulatory controls and function of PKC\u03b1 entirely based upon the previously annotated ubiquitously expressed prototypical isoform. From RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis in murine heart, we identified a previously unannotated PKC\u03b1 variant produced by alternative RNA splicing. This PKC\u03b1 transcript variant, which we named PKC\u03b1-novel exon (PKC\u03b1-NE), contains an extra exon between exon 16 and exon 17, and is specifically detected in adult mouse cardiac and skeletal muscle, but not other tissues; it is also detected in human hearts. This transcript variant yields a PKC\u03b1 isoform with additional 16 amino acids inserted in its COOH-terminal variable region. Although the canonical PKC\u03b1 enzyme is a lipid-dependent kinase, in vitro kinase assays show that PKC\u03b1-NE displays a high level of basal lipid-independent catalytic activity. Our unbiased proteomic analysis identified a specific interaction between PKC\u03b1-NE and eukaryotic elongation factor-1\u03b1 (eEF1A1). Studies in cardiomyocytes link PKC\u03b1-NE expression to an increase in eEF1A1 phosphorylation and elevated protein synthesis.

{"title": "Spiral wave drift under optical feedback in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Spiral waves occur in various types of excitable media and their dynamics determine the spatial excitation patterns. An important type of spiral wave dynamics is drift, as it can control the position of a spiral wave or eliminate a spiral wave by forcing it to the boundary. In theoretical and experimental studies of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, it was shown that the most direct way to induce the controlled drift of spiral waves is by application of an external electric field. Mathematically such drift occurs due to the onset of additional gradient terms in the Laplacian operator describing excitable media. However, this approach does not work for cardiac excitable tissue, where an external electric field does not result in gradient terms. In this paper, we propose a method of how to induce a directed linear drift of spiral waves in cardiac tissue, which can be realized as an optical feedback control in tissue where photosensitive ion channels are expressed. We illustrate our method by using the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for cardiac tissue and the generic model of photosensitive ion channels. We show that our method works for continuous and discrete light sources and can effectively move spiral waves in cardiac tissue, or eliminate them by collisions with the boundary or with another spiral wave. We finally implement our method by using a biophysically motivated photosensitive ion channel model included to the Luo-Rudy model for cardiac cells and show that the proposed feedback control also induces directed linear drift of spiral waves in a wide range of light intensities.", "journal": "Physical review.

Membrane potential depolarization brings in calcium (Ca) through the Ca channels to trigger intracellular Ca release for contraction of the heart. Ca also affects voltage via Ca-dependent ionic currents, and thus, voltage and Ca are bidirectionally coupled. It has been shown that the voltage subsystem or the Ca subsystem can generate its own dynamical instabilities which are affected by their bidirectional couplings, leading to complex dynamics of action potential and Ca cycling. Moreover, the dynamics become spatiotemporal in tissue in which cells are diffusively coupled through voltage. A widely investigated spatiotemporal dynamics is spatially discordant alternans (SDA) in which action potential duration (APD) or Ca amplitude exhibits temporally period-2 and spatially out-of-phase patterns, i.e., APD-SDA and Ca-SDA patterns, respectively. However, the mechanisms of formation, stability, and synchronization of APD-SDA and Ca-SDA patterns remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we use cardiac tissue models described by an amplitude equation, coupled iterated maps, and reaction-diffusion equations with detailed physiology (the ionic model) to perform analytical and computational investigations. We show that, when the Ca subsystem is stable, the Ca-SDA pattern always follows the APD-SDA pattern, and thus, they are always synchronized. When the Ca subsystem is unstable, synchronization of APD-SDA and Ca-SDA patterns depends on the stabilities of both subsystems, their coupling strengths, and the spatial scales of the initial Ca-SDA patterns. Spontaneous (initial condition-independent) synchronization is promoted by enhancing APD instability and reducing Ca instability as well as stronger Ca-to-APD and APD-to-Ca coupling, a pattern formation caused by dynamical instabilities. When Ca is more unstable and APD is less unstable or APD-to-Ca coupling is weak, synchronization of APD-SDA and Ca-SDA patterns is promoted by larger initially synchronized Ca-SDA clusters, i.e., initial condition-dependent synchronization. The synchronized APD-SDA and Ca-SDA patterns can be locked in-phase, antiphase, or quasiperiodic depending on the coupling relationship between APD and Ca. These theoretical and simulation results provide mechanistic insights into the APD-SDA and Ca-SDA dynamics observed in experimental studies.", "journal": "Physical review.

{"title": "Transcriptomic profiling of cardiac tissues from SARS-CoV-2 patients identifies DNA damage.", "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is known to present with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary organ complications. In comparison with the 2009 pandemic (pH1N1), SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to lead to more severe disease, with multi-organ effects, including cardiovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with acute and long-term cardiovascular disease, but the molecular changes that govern this remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the host transcriptome landscape of cardiac tissues collected at rapid autopsy from seven SARS-CoV-2, two pH1N1, and six control patients using targeted spatial transcriptomics approaches. Although SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in cardiac tissue, host transcriptomics showed upregulation of genes associated with DNA damage and repair, heat shock, and M1-like macrophage infiltration in the cardiac tissues of COVID-19 patients. The DNA damage present in the SARS-CoV-2 patient samples, were further confirmed by \u03b3-H2Ax immunohistochemistry. In comparison, pH1N1 showed upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, in particular interferon and complement pathways, when compared with COVID-19 patients. These data demonstrate the emergence of distinct transcriptomic profiles in cardiac tissues of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 influenza infection supporting the need for a greater understanding of the effects on extra-pulmonary organs, including the cardiovascular system of COVID-19 patients, to delineate the immunopathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and long term impact on health.", "journal": "Immunology", "date": "2022-09-16", "authors": ["AruthaKulasinghe", "NingLiu", "Chin WeeTan", "JamesMonkman", "Jane ESinclair", "Dharmesh DBhuva", "DavidGodbolt", "LiuliuPan", "AndyNam", "HabibSadeghirad", "KeiSato", "Gianluigi LiBassi", "KenO'Byrne", "CamilaHartmann", "Anna Flavia RibeiroDos Santos Miggiolaro", "Gustavo LenciMarques", "Lidia ZytynskiMoura", "DerekRichard", "MarkAdams", "Luciade Noronha", "Cristina PellegrinoBaena", "Jacky YSuen", "RakeshArora", "Gabrielle TBelz", "Kirsty RShort", "Melissa JDavis", "Fernando Souza-FonsecaGuimaraes", "John FFraser"], "doi": "10.1111/imm.13577"}

In this work, carbon fibers (CFs) and co-axial fibrous mesh were integrated which combined the high modulus and excellent electrical conductivity of CFs and the fibrous and porous structures of the electrospun fibers. The scaffold was fabricated by simply integrating coaxial electrospun fibers and carbon fibers through a freeze-drying procedure. It was shown that the integration of carbon fibers have the conductivity and Young's modulus of the fibrous mesh increased significantly, meanwhile, upregulated the expression of CX43, \u03b1-actinin, RhoA of the neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and promoted the secretion of VEGF of HUVECs. Moreover, the cardiomyocytes grown on the scaffolds increased the ability of HUVECs migration. When implanted to the injury area post myocardial infraction, the scaffolds were able to effectively enhance the tissue regeneration and new vessel formation, which rescued the heart dysfunction induced by the myocardial infraction, evidenced by the results of echocardiography and histochemical analysis. In conclusion, the composite scaffolds could promote the myocardium regeneration and function's recovery by enhancing cardiomyocytes maturation and angiogenesis and establishing the crosstalk between the cardiomyocytes and the vascular endothelial cells.", "journal": "Materials today.

ILK overexpression or TRPV4 agonist promoted the angiogenesis in HUVEC co-cultured with CACs. ILK overexpression or activation upregulated TRPV4 expression in CACs, while TRPV4 agonist stimulation also regulated ILK expression. TRPV4 agonist effectively improved the myocardial function of AMI rats. Moreover, this effect could be strengthened when combined with CAC transplantation, as CAC transplantation dramatically upregulated the expression of ILK and TRPV4 in heart tissues of AMI rats.

{"title": "Roles of Natriuretic Peptides and the Significance of Neprilysin in Cardiovascular Diseases.", "abstract": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) activate the guanylyl cyclase A receptor (GC-A), which synthesizes the second messenger cGMP in a wide variety of tissues and cells. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) activates the cGMP-producing guanylyl cyclase B receptor (GC-B) in chondrocytes, endothelial cells, and possibly smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and cardiac fibroblasts. The development of genetically modified mice has helped elucidate the physiological roles of natriuretic peptides via GC-A or GC-B. These include the hormonal effects of ANP/BNP in the vasculature, autocrine effects of ANP/BNP in cardiomyocytes, and paracrine effects of CNP in the vasculature and cardiomyocytes. Neprilysin (NEP) is a transmembrane neutral endopeptidase that degrades the three natriuretic peptides. Recently, mice overexpressing NEP, specifically in cardiomyocytes, revealed that local cardiac NEP plays a vital role in regulating natriuretic peptides in the heart tissue. Since NEP inhibition is a clinically accepted approach for heart failure treatment, the physiological roles of natriuretic peptides have regained attention. This article focuses on the physiological roles of natriuretic peptides elucidated in mice with GC-A or GC-B deletion, the significance of NEP in natriuretic peptide metabolism, and the long-term effects of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) on cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Biology", "date": "2022-09-15", "authors": ["HitoshiNakagawa", "YoshihikoSaito"], "doi": "10.3390/biology11071017\n10.1016/0024-3205(81)90370-2\n10.1016/0006-291X(83)91675-3\n10.1016/0006-291X(84)91077-5\n10.1038/332078a0\n10.1016/0006-291X(90)92401-K\n10.1016/0006-291X(85)90170-6\n10.1161/01.RES.69.2.491\n10.1007/978-94-009-0083-7_9\n10.1172/JCI115146\n10.1161/01.CIR.90.1.195\n10.1161/01.CIR.76.1.115\n10.1152/physrev.00022.2015\n10.1038/s41569-020-0381-0\n10.1126/science.1672777\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.200\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.04.060\n10.1161/01.RES.75.4.770\n10.1177/0091270009343932\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.013748\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.01.018\n10.1056/NEJMoa1409077\n10.1111/jch.13153\n10.1126/science.7839143\n10.1038/378065a0\n10.1073/pnas.102650499\n10.1172/JCI23360\n10.1002/gene.20056\n10.1093/cvr/cvr279\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.08219\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.033383\n10.1172/JCI113872\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000029923.57048.61\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.732990\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.208314\n10.1172/JCI17061\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000885\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.011\n10.1172/jci.insight.139910\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000173420.31354.ef\n10.1172/JCI12088\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147829.78357.C5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307196\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.11.029\n10.2169/internalmedicine.40.232\n10.1007/s00018-008-8112-4\n10.1042/bj1340043\n10.1042/bj1370477\n10.1096/fasebj.3.2.2521610\n10.1038/nm0897-904\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000029801.86489.50\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08082.x\n10.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.025\n10.1007/s00228-007-0309-1\n10.1210/jcem.78.6.8200946\n10.1210/jcem.76.1.8380606\n10.1016/j.jchf.2020.09.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0053233\n10.1001/jama.2019.12821\n10.1002/ehf2.12627\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.16445\n10.1371/journal.pone.0104001\n10.1042/bj2910083\n10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61634-1\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001785\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.08.001\n10.1056/NEJMoa2104508\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.057429\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.08484\n10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61966-8\n10.1038/s41440-021-00819-7"}

{"title": "Vaccine-linked chemotherapy with a low dose of benznidazole plus a bivalent recombinant protein vaccine prevents the development of cardiac fibrosis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi in chronically-infected BALB/c mice.", "abstract": "Chagas disease (CD) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and affects 6-7 million people worldwide. Approximately 30% of chronic patients develop chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) after decades. Benznidazole (BNZ), one of the first-line chemotherapy used for CD, induces toxicity and fails to halt the progression of CCC in chronic patients. The recombinant parasite-derived antigens, including Tc24, Tc24-C4, TSA-1, and TSA-1-C4 with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) agonist-adjuvants reduce cardiac parasite burdens, heart inflammation, and fibrosis, leading us to envision their use as immunotherapy together with BNZ. Given genetic immunization (DNA vaccines) encoding Tc24 and TSA-1 induce protective immunity in mice and dogs, we propose that immunization with the corresponding recombinant proteins offers an alternative and feasible strategy to develop these antigens as a bivalent human vaccine. We hypothesized that a low dose of BNZ in combination with a therapeutic vaccine (TSA-1-C4 and Tc24-C4 antigens formulated with a synthetic TLR-4 agonist-adjuvant, E6020-SE) given during early chronic infection, could prevent cardiac disease progression and provide antigen-specific T cell immunity.\nWe evaluated the therapeutic vaccine candidate plus BNZ (25 mg/kg/day/7 days) given on days 72 and 79 post-infection (p.i) (early chronic phase). Fibrosis, inflammation, and parasite burden were quantified in heart tissue at day 200 p.i. (late chronic phase). Further, spleen cells were collected to evaluate antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune response, using flow cytometry. We found that vaccine-linked BNZ treated mice had lower cardiac fibrosis compared to the infected untreated control group. Moreover, cells from mice that received the immunotherapy had higher stimulation index of antigen-specific CD8+Perforin+ T cells as well as antigen-specific central memory T cells compared to the infected untreated control.\nOur results suggest that the bivalent immunotherapy together with BNZ treatment given during early chronic infection protects BALB/c mice against cardiac fibrosis progression and activates a strong CD8+ T cell response by in vitro restimulation, evidencing the induction of a long-lasting T. cruzi-immunity.", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "date": "2022-09-13", "authors": ["Victor ManuelDzul-Huchim", "Maria JesusRamirez-Sierra", "Pedro PabloMartinez-Vega", "Miguel EnriqueRosado-Vallado", "Victor ErmiloArana-Argaez", "JaimeOrtega-Lopez", "FabianGusovsky", "EricDumonteil", "Julio VladimirCruz-Chan", "PeterHotez", "Mar\u00eda ElenaBottazzi", "Liliana EstefaniaVillanueva-Lizama"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0010258\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0005423\n10.1161/01.CIR.14.6.1035\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60061-X\n10.1016/s1471-4922(02)02283-3\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.109\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0000899\n10.1084/jem.20161791\n10.1586/14787210.7.2.157\n10.1056/NEJMoa1507574\n10.7326/0003-4819-144-10-200605160-00006\n10.1128/AAC.00832-18\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.03.006\n10.1017/S0031182017001469\n10.4269/ajtmh.13-0690\n10.1645/GE-2396.1\n10.1590/s0074-02762012000200010\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.08.104\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004594\n10.1093/infdis/jiu418\n10.1080/21645515.2015.1119346\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0007413\n10.1586/erv.12.85\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.165658\n10.3390/tropicalmed6010016\n10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.00183.x\n10.1007/s00281-015-0481-9\n10.1016/j.coi.2009.07.006\n10.1016/j.coi.2007.04.011\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.26.021607.090404\n10.1016/j.pt.2019.08.006\n10.1126/science.290.5489.92\n10.4049/jimmunol.174.3.1594\n10.4049/jimmunol.181.4.2644\n10.1038/nm1744\n10.1128/IAI.01190-10\n10.1080/21645515.2016.1242540\n10.1016/j.xphs.2017.12.014\n10.1080/21645515.2018.1520581\n10.1128/IAI.00127-17\n10.1128/IAI.00876-17\n10.1111/pim.12769\n10.1038/s41598-021-82930-w\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.05.010\n10.1196/annals.1428.098\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.08.002\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002367\n10.1093/infdis/jit420\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.106334\n10.1586/14760584.6.5.773\n10.1128/iai.72.1.46\u201353.2004\n10.1128/JCM.27.7.1477\u20131482.1989\n10.1016/S0166-6851(03)00093-8\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.07.017\n10.1161/JAHA.119.013365\n10.1128/IAI.67.1.308\u2013318.1999\n10.1016/j.imlet.2005.11.015\n10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00251.x\n10.1586/erv.10.48\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1007410\n10.1038/s41598-018-29564-7\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0001644\n10.1590/0074-0276140033\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002658\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02347\n10.1046/j.1365-3024.1998.00154.x\n10.1128/IAI.01459-08\n10.1084/jem.162.1.171\n10.4049/jimmunol.173.3.1834\n10.1182/blood-2003-08-2765\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.00194"}

Elevated angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can lead to hypertension and its complications.\nIn this study, we addressed the cardiac-injury effects of Ang II and investigated the signaling mechanism induced by Ang II. Both H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to Ang II to observe hypertension-related cardiac apoptosis.\nThe results of western blotting revealed that Ang II significantly attenuated the IGF1R-PI3K-AKT pathway via the Ang II-AT1 receptor axis and phosphatase and tensin homolog expression. Furthermore, real-time PCR showed that Ang II also activated miR-320-3p transcription to repress the PI3K-Akt pathway. In the heart tissue of spontaneously hypertensive rats, activation of the IGF1R survival pathway was also reduced compared with that in Wistar-Kyoto rats, especially in aged spontaneously hypertensive rats.\nHence, we speculate that the Ang II-AT1 receptor axis induces both phosphatase and tensin homolog and miR-320-3p expression to downregulate the IGF1R-PI3K-AKT survival pathway and cause cell apoptosis in the heart.", "journal": "Journal of hypertension", "date": "2022-09-13", "authors": ["Shang-YehLu", "Wei-ZhiHong", "Bruce Chi-KangTsai", "Yu-ChunChang", "Chia-HuaKuo", "Thomas GMhone", "Ray-JadeChen", "Wei-WenKuo", "Chih-YangHuang"], "doi": "10.1097/HJH.0000000000003285"}
{"title": "Myocardial infarction from a tissue engineering and regenerative medicine point of view: A comprehensive review on models and treatments.", "abstract": "In the modern world, myocardial infarction is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, which are responsible for around 18 million deaths every year or almost 32% of all deaths. Due to the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, this rate is expected to increase in the coming years. Although there has been some progress in myocardial infarction treatment, translating pre-clinical findings to the clinic remains a major challenge. One reason for this is the lack of reliable and human representative healthy and fibrotic cardiac tissue models that can be used to understand the fundamentals of ischemic/reperfusion injury caused by myocardial infarction and to test new drugs and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we first present an overview of the anatomy of the heart and the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction, and then discuss the recent developments on pre-clinical infarct models, focusing mainly on the engineered three-dimensional cardiac ischemic/reperfusion injury and fibrosis models developed using different engineering methods such as organoids, microfluidic devices, and bioprinted constructs. We also present the benefits and limitations of emerging and promising regenerative therapy treatments for myocardial infarction such as cell therapies, extracellular vesicles, and cardiac patches. This review aims to overview recent advances in three-dimensional engineered infarct models and current regenerative therapeutic options, which can be used as a guide for developing new models and treatment strategies.", "journal": "Biophysics reviews", "date": "2022-09-13", "authors": ["GozdeBasara", "GokhanBahcecioglu", "S GulberkOzcebe", "Bradley WEllis", "GeorgeRonan", "PinarZorlutuna"],

{"title": "Protective effects of silver nanoparticles in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.", "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in the medical field, including cardiovascular. However, limited research has investigated the effect of AgNPs on the protection of myocardial infarction (MI).\nIsoproterenol (Iso)-induced MI and the cardiac protection offered by AgNPs were investigated in the present study. Additionally, we characterized the profile of Ag in the form of nanoparticles.\nTwenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows: normal, Iso, Iso + AgNO\nThe silver was confirmed in the form of nanoparticles by its size at intervals of 8.72-37.84 nm.

{"title": "Analysis of the potential ferroptosis mechanism and multitemporal expression change of central ferroptosis-related genes in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infraction is the most severe type of coronary artery disease and remains a substantial burden to the health care system globally. Although myocardial reperfusion is critical for ischemic cardiac tissue survival, the reperfusion itself could cause paradoxical injury. This paradoxical phenomenon is known as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and the exact molecular mechanism of IRI is still far from being elucidated and is a topic of controversy. Meanwhile, ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of cell death that has been reported to be associated with various cardiovascular diseases. Thus, we explored the potential ferroptosis mechanism and target in cardiac IRI via bioinformatics analysis and experiment. GSE4105 data were obtained from the GEO database and consist of a rat IRI model and control. After identifying differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) and hub genes of cardiac IRI, we performed enrichment analysis, coexpression analysis, drug-gene interaction prediction, and mRNA-miRNA regulatory network construction. Moreover, we validated and explored the multitemporal expression of hub genes in a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9C2 cell injury model under different conditions via RT-qPCR. A total of 43 DEFRGs and 7 hub genes (tumor protein p53 [Tp53], tumor necrosis factor [Tnf], hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha [Hif1a], interleukin 6 [Il6], heme oxygenase 1 [Hmox1], X-box binding protein 1 [Xbp1], and caspase 8 [Casp8]) were screened based on bioinformatics analysis. The functional annotation of these genes revealed apoptosis, and the related signaling pathways could have association with the pathogenesis of ferroptosis in cardiac IRI. In addition, the expression of the seven hub genes in IRI models were found higher than that of control under different H/R conditions and time points. In conclusion, the analysis of 43 DEFRGs and 7 hub genes could reveal the potential biological pathway and mechanism of ferroptosis in cardiac IRI. In addition, the multitemporal expression change of hub genes in H9C2 cells under different H/R conditions could provide clues for further ferroptosis mechanism exploring, and the seven hub genes could be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in cardiac IRI.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2022-09-13", "authors": ["ZuoxiangWang", "ZhisongHe", "QinkaoXuan", "YueZhang", "JialiangXu", "JiaLin", "HongxiaLi", "WeixiangChen", "TingboJiang"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2022.934901\n10.1016/s0065-2776(08)60532-5\n10.1001/jama.299.15.joc80027\n10.1152/ajpheart.00452.2017\n10.1093/nar/gks1193\n10.1016/s0962-8924(01)02064-5\n10.1053/j.jvca.2008.08.005\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2020.104570\n10.1161/01.cir.97.14.1375\n10.1186/1752-0509-8-s4-s11\n10.1165/ajrcmb.15.1.8679227\n10.1093/nar/gkx1143\n10.1038/s41417-020-0170-2\n10.3390/biomedicines9091144\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042\n10.7554/eLife.02523\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2006.01478.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.758516\n10.1093/nar/30.1.207\n10.3389/fphar.2021.628988\n10.1073/pnas.1821022116\n10.1146/annurev-arplant-050312-120132\n10.1016/j.tibs.2005.06.009\n10.1093/nar/gks1094\n10.2174/138161206777947614\n10.1002/gcc.22449\n10.1136/ard.2009.119388\n10.1161/circulationaha.109.888784\n10.18632/oncotarget.23046\n10.1159/000368202\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.032\n10.1016/0022-2828(92)91042-4\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.05.074\n10.1124/mol.106.027029\n10.1097/01.asn.0000040596.23073.01\n10.1007/s10741-010-9180-8\n10.1016/j.meomic.2020.100001\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.065\n10.1007/s10495-020-01627-z\n10.3389/fcell.2021.799499\n10.1038/s41420-021-00656-0\n10.1038/s41418-020-0528-x\n10.3390/antiox10050667\n10.1001/jama.286.17.2107\n10.1016/j.patbio.2015.07.010\n10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.37.1.517\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2020.188357\n10.1007/s00018-020-03694-6\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119935\n10.1681/ASN.2008111204\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.278.4.H1049\n10.1093/cvr/cvu172\n10.1517/14656566.2016.1115015\n10.1016/s0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.1016/j.ahj.2015.08.005\n10.1038/s41418-021-00907-8\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00013.2006\n10.1093/database/baq020\n10.1002/path.5677\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2004.tb00467.x\n10.1161/circulationaha.108.846105\n10.1016/j.semnephrol.2018.10.006\n10.1152/ajprenal.00591.2010\n10.1161/hc3401.093154\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btq675\n10.1038/2063\n10.1371/journal.pone.0206239\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.021\n10.1016/j.canlet.2010.07.022\n10.1152/ajprenal.90304.2008\n10.1007/s00210-020-01932-z\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31826e1058\n10.1097/01.mot.0000125488.13679.cd\n10.1016/s0735-1097(97)00494-4\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu268\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.905471\n10.3892/or.2021.8191\n10.1093/nar/gkq537\n10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61237-4\n10.1093/nar/gkl167\n10.1002/cbin.11533\n10.1161/01.cir.91.5.1520\n10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.042\n10.1126/sciadv.aaw2238\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.1161/hh1401.093314\n10.1681/ASN.2013121270\n10.1007/s11010-011-0979-y\n10.1097/01.tp.0000250764.17636.ba\n10.1021/acsami.1c18061\n10.1093/database/baaa021\n10.1038/s41467-019-09234-6"}

Current cardiac microphysiological devices and organs-on-chips consist of several layers prepared with complex, multi-step processes. Incorporating inorganic photonic crystals may cause long-term biocompatibility issues. Herein, micropatterned hydrogels with anisotropic structural colors are prepared by locking shear-oriented tunicate cellulose nanocrystals (TCNCs) in hydrogel networks through in situ polymerization, allowing the visualization and monitoring of cardiomyocytes. The anisotropic hydrogels are composed of highly ordered TCNCs with bright interference color and micro-grooved methacrylated gelatin with excellent biocompatibility. The microgroove patterns induce cardiomyocyte alignment and the autonomous beating of cardiomyocytes causes the hydrogels to deform, dynamically shifting the interference color. These micropatterned hydrogels could noninvasively monitor real-time changes of cardiomyocytes under pharmaceutical treatment and electrical stimulation through wavelength shifts in the transmittance spectra.

{"title": "Automated 3D Whole-Heart Mesh Reconstruction From 2D Cine MR Slices Using Statistical Shape Model.", "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the one of the gold standard imaging modalities for the diagnosis and characterization of cardiovascular diseases. The clinical cine protocol of the CMR typically generates high-resolution 2D images of heart tissues in a finite number of separated and independent 2D planes, which are appropriate for the 3D reconstruction of biventricular heart surfaces. However, they are usually inadequate for the whole-heart reconstruction, specifically for both atria. In this regard, the paper presents a novel approach for automated patient-specific 3D whole-heart mesh reconstruction from limited number of 2D cine CMR slices with the help of a statistical shape model (SSM). After extracting the heart contours from 2D cine slices, the SSM is first optimally fitted over the sparse heart contours in 3D space to provide the initial representation of the 3D whole-heart mesh, which is further deformed to minimize the distance from the heart contours for generating the final reconstructed mesh. The reconstruction performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a cohort of 30 subjects randomly selected from the UK Biobank study, demonstrating the generation of high-quality 3D whole-heart meshes with average contours to surface distance less than the underlying image resolution and the clinical metrics within acceptable ranges reported in previous literature. Clinical Relevance- Automated patient-specific 3D whole-heart mesh reconstruction has numerous applications in car-diac diagnosis and multimodal visualization, including treatment planning, virtual surgery, and biomedical simulations.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Biomimetic cardiac tissue culture model (CTCM) to emulate cardiac physiology and pathophysiology ex vivo.", "abstract": "There is need for a reliable in vitro system that can accurately replicate the cardiac physiological environment for drug testing. The limited availability of human heart tissue culture systems has led to inaccurate interpretations of cardiac-related drug effects. Here,\u00a0we developed a cardiac tissue culture model (CTCM) that can electro-mechanically stimulate heart slices with physiological stretches in systole and diastole during the cardiac cycle. After 12 days in culture, this approach partially improved the viability of heart slices but did not completely maintain their structural integrity. Therefore, following small molecule screening, we found that the incorporation of 100\u2009nM tri-iodothyronine (T3) and 1\u2009\u03bcM dexamethasone (Dex) into our culture media preserved the microscopic structure of the slices for 12 days. When combined with T3/Dex treatment, the CTCM system maintained the transcriptional profile, viability, metabolic activity, and structural integrity for 12 days at the same levels as the fresh heart tissue. Furthermore, overstretching the cardiac tissue induced cardiac hypertrophic signaling in culture, which provides a proof of concept for the ability of the CTCM to emulate cardiac stretch-induced hypertrophic conditions.

{"title": "Cell therapy attenuates endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive rats with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.", "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is defined by increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, impaired vascular compliance, and fibrosis. Although systemic inflammation, driven by comorbidities, has been proposed to play a key role, the precise pathogenesis remains elusive. To test the hypothesis that inflammation drives endothelial dysfunction in HFpEF, we used cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), which reduce inflammation and fibrosis, improving function, structure, and survival in HFpEF rats. Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high-salt diet developed HFpEF, as manifested by diastolic dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and accelerated mortality. Rats were randomly allocated to receive intracoronary infusion of CDCs or vehicle. Two weeks later, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function were analyzed. Single-cell RNA sequencing of heart tissue was used to assay transcriptomic changes. CDCs improved endothelial-dependent vasodilation while reducing oxidative stress and restoring endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. RNA sequencing revealed CDC-induced attenuation of pathways underlying endothelial cell leukocyte binding and innate immunity. Exposure of endothelial cells to CDC-secreted extracellular vesicles in vitro reduced VCAM-1 protein expression and attenuated monocyte adhesion and transmigration.

{"title": "Misuse of Cardiac Lipid upon Exposure to Toxic Trace Elements-A Focused Review.", "abstract": "Heavy metals and metalloids like cadmium, arsenic, mercury, and lead are frequently found in the soil, water, food, and atmosphere; trace amounts can cause serious health issues to the human organism. These toxic trace elements (TTE) affect almost all the organs, mainly the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, and the nervous system, through increased free radical formation, DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein sulfhydryl depletion. This work aims to advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind lipid accumulation via increased free fatty acid levels in circulation due to TTEs. The increased lipid level in the myocardium worsens the heart function. This dysregulation of the lipid metabolism leads to damage in the structure of the myocardium, inclusive fibrosis in cardiac tissue, myocyte apoptosis, and decreased contractility due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, it is discussed herein how exposure to cadmium decreases the heart rate, contractile tension, the conductivity of the atrioventricular node, and coronary flow rate. Arsenic may induce atherosclerosis by increasing platelet aggregation and reducing fibrinolysis, as exposure interferes with apolipoprotein (Apo) levels, resulting in the rise of the Apo-B/Apo-A1 ratio and an elevated risk of acute cardiovascular events. Concerning mercury and lead, these toxicants can cause hypertension, myocardial infarction, and carotid atherosclerosis, in association with the generation of free radicals and oxidative stress.

{"title": "Monoamine Oxidase-Dependent Pro-Survival Signaling in Diabetic Hearts Is Mediated by miRNAs.", "abstract": "Diabetes leads to cardiomyopathy and heart failure, the leading cause of death for diabetic patients. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition in diabetic cardiomyopathy prevents oxidative stress, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress and the development of diastolic dysfunction. However, it is unclear whether, in addition to the direct effects exerted on the mitochondria, MAO activity is able to post-transcriptionally regulate cardiomyocyte function and survival in diabetes. To this aim, we performed gene and miRNA expression profiling in cardiac tissue from streptozotocin-treated mice (model of type 1 diabetes (T1D)), administered with either vehicle or MAOs inhibitor pargyline for 12 weeks. We found that inhibition of MAO activity in T1D hearts leads to profound transcriptomic changes, affecting autophagy and pro-survival pathways activation. MAO activity in T1D hearts increased miR-133a-3p, -193a-3p and -27a-3p expression.

{"title": "Distress-Mediated Remodeling of Cardiac Connexin-43 in a Novel Cell Model for Arrhythmogenic Heart Diseases.", "abstract": "Gap junctions and their expression pattern are essential to robust function of intercellular communication and electrical propagation in cardiomyocytes. In healthy myocytes, the main cardiac gap junction protein connexin-43 (Cx43) is located at the intercalated disc providing a clear direction of signal spreading across the cardiac tissue. Dislocation of Cx43 to lateral membranes has been detected in numerous cardiac diseases leading to slowed conduction and high propensity for the development of arrhythmias. At the cellular level, arrhythmogenic diseases are associated with elevated levels of oxidative distress and gap junction remodeling affecting especially the amount and sarcolemmal distribution of Cx43 expression. So far, a mechanistic link between sustained oxidative distress and altered Cx43 expression has not yet been identified. Here, we propose a novel cell model based on murine induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to investigate subcellular signaling pathways linking cardiomyocyte distress with gap junction remodeling. We tested the new hypothesis that chronic distress, induced by rapid pacing, leads to increased reactive oxygen species, which promotes expression of a micro-RNA, miR-1, specific for the control of Cx43. Our data demonstrate that Cx43 expression is highly sensitive to oxidative distress, leading to reduced expression.

Moreover, Cx43 expression is tightly regulated by miR-1, which is activated by tachypacing-induced oxidative distress.

This structure is composed of several myofibril proteins, isoforms of which are encoded by genes specific to either the heart or skeletal muscle. The chromatin remodeler complex Chd4/NuRD regulates the transcriptional expression of these specific sarcomeric programs by repressing genes of the skeletal muscle sarcomere in the heart. Aberrant expression of skeletal muscle genes induced by the loss of Chd4 in the heart leads to sudden death due to defects in cardiomyocyte contraction that progress to arrhythmia and fibrosis. Identifying the transcription factors (TFs) that recruit Chd4/NuRD to repress skeletal muscle genes in the myocardium will provide important information for understanding numerous cardiac pathologies and, ultimately, pinpointing new therapeutic targets for arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. Here, we sought to find Chd4 interactors and their function in cardiac homeostasis. We therefore describe a physical interaction between Chd4 and the TF Znf219 in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Prazosin improves neurogenic acute heart failure through downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 23 in rat hearts.", "abstract": "Bilateral nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) lesions, possibly caused by enterovirus 71 infection, cause severe neurogenic hypertension, leading to acute heart failure (HF), pulmonary edema, and death within hours. Alpha-adrenergic blockers attenuate blood pressure and ameliorate HF and pulmonary edema, thereby prolonging survival time. However, the molecular mechanisms of these blockers are not clear. In this study, we investigated these mechanisms in a rat model of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced HF. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with prazosin 10 min after the microinjection of 6-OHDA into the NTS. Immunohistochemistry and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining were used for analysis. In the cardiac tissue of 6-OHDA-induced HF, in situ expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) increased, but in situ expression of Vitamin D receptor (VDR) decreased. DHE staining revealed several heart cells with high reactive oxygen species production. Prazosin treatment decreased TNF-\u03b1, FGF23, and FGFR1 expression in the heart of rats with 6-OHDA-induced HF. It also prevented cardiomyopathy caused by 6-OHDA-induced bilateral NTS lesions by inhibiting the FGF23-FGFR1 pathway and downregulating TNF-\u03b1 expression. In situ, FGF23, FGFR1, VDR, superoxide, and TNF-\u03b1 in the heart were found to be involved in acute HF in our rat model of 6-OHDA-induced bilateral NTS lesions.

We therefore performed bioinformatics analysis to screen for key genes of SM in MI immune cells.\nThree matrix files including GSE61145, GSE23294, and GSE71906 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GSE61145 was a human peripheral blood database, and GSE23294 and GSE71906 were 2 mouse myocardial tissue databases. R and annotation packages were used to screen for differentially-expressed genes (DEGs). Datasets of human and mouse cardiac tissues were downloaded from the GEO database for subsequent validation. The downloaded platform and matrix files were processed using R language and annotation packages. Key targets and enrichment pathways were identified using Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. The Wilcoxon test was performed on the genes involved in SM pathways in neutrophils.\nA total of 261 DEGs were obtained from human peripheral blood datasets, among which 101 were immune-related.

Cardiac dysfunction is an established serious outcome of multiorgan failure associated with this condition. Therefore, it is important to develop drugs targeting sepsis-induced cardiac damage and inflammation. Thymoquinone (TQ) has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-fibrotic, anti-tumor, and anti-apoptotic effects. This study examined the effects of thymoquinone on sepsis-induced cardiac damage.\nMale BALB/c mice were randomly segregated into four groups: control, TQ, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and CLP\u2009+\u2009TQ groups. CLP was performed after gavaging the mice with TQ for 2 weeks. After 48 hours, we estimated the histopathological changes in the cardiac tissue and the serum levels of cardiac troponin-T. We evaluated the expression of factors associated with inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the PI3K/AKT pathway.\nTQ significantly reduced intestinal histological alterations and inhibited the upregulation of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Bax, NOX4, p-PI3K, and p-AKT.

{"title": "LincRNA RMRP Regulates Phenylephrine-induced Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy by Means of Targeting miR-1.", "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which could lead to heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (CH) is the primary characteristic of cardiac hypertrophy. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA, lincRNA) plays an important role in CH. In this study, the expression of linc-RMRP and its correlation with cardiac hypertrophy were analyzed in cardiac tissues of patients with HCM. Real-time qPCR and western blotting measured the expressions of lincf-RMRP, miR-1, and hypertrophic marker genes. RNA pulldown and luciferase reporter gene assays were performed to validate the combination between linc-RMRP and miR-1. We confirmed that Linc-RMRP was upregulated in both cardiac hypertrophy tissues and phenylephrine (PE)-induced CH cells, and the cells presented hypertrophic features, enlarged cell surface area and volume, elevated total protein contents, and increased expressions of ANP, BNP, \u03b2-MHC, and activated p70S6K and 4EBP1. Bioinformatic analysis found that linc-RMRP directly bonds to miR-1. RNA pulldown, mutation, and luciferase reporter gene assays verified this combination. Silencing linc-RMRP significantly attenuated hypertrophic responses induced by PE while the expression of miR-1 was released. However, the transfection of miR-1 inhibitor reversed the effects of linc-RMRP knockdown exerted on PE-treated cardiomyocytes. In summary, our study identified the modulatory role linc-RMRP played in regulating PE-induced CH by means of binding miR-1, and this might provide a new target for cardiac hypertrophy therapy.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2022-09-08", "authors": ["JingChen", "JiaLi", "XuyanWang", "ZhuZeng", "HuifangZhang", "ZongyiZou", "NinaHuang", "XiaohuaSun"], "doi": "10.1097/FJC.0000000000001366"}

Raman microscopy, one of the label-free vibrational imaging techniques, has been employed for chemical characterization of tissues. However, the low sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy often requires a long acquisition time of Raman measurement or a high laser power, or both, which prevents one from investigating large-area tissues in a nondestructive manner. In this work, we demonstrated chemical imaging of heart tissues using mid-infrared photothermal (MIP) microscopy that simultaneously achieves the high sensitivity benefited from IR absorption of molecules and the high spatial resolution down to a few micrometers. We successfully visualized the distributions of different biomolecules, including proteins, phosphate-including proteins, and lipids/carbohydrates/amino acids. Further, we experimentally compared MIP microscopy with Raman microscopy to evaluate the sensitivity and photodamage to tissues. We proved that MIP microscopy is a highly sensitive technique for obtaining vibrational information of molecules in a broad fingerprint region, thereby it could be employed for biological and diagnostic applications, such as live-tissue imaging.", "journal": "Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry", "date": "2022-09-08", "authors": ["RyoKato", "Taka-AkiYano", "TakeoMinamikawa", "TakuoTanaka"], "doi": "10.1007/s44211-022-00182-8\n10.1038/s41598-019-53428-3\n10.1038/s41598-020-75604-6\n10.1007/s00418-012-1015-3\n10.1039/D0AN02077J\n10.1038/s41598-018-33025-6\n10.1364/BOE.8.000524\n10.1364/BOE.445640\n10.1371/journal.pone.0110295\n10.1364/OE.14.003942\n10.1021/acsphotonics.8b00398\n10.1038/71286\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b05330\n10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02913\n10.1021/acssensors.8b00115\n10.1038/s41592-020-0883-z\n10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02286\n10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b06065\n10.1039/D0AN02198A\n10.1038/s41467-020-20314-w\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02489\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03967\n10.1177/00037028211063513\n10.1016/S1381-1177(99)00030-2\n10.1039/c0an00542h\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.11.033\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2009.02.016\n10.1016/j.abb.2012.02.012\n10.1007/s12038-011-9090-5\n10.1021/ja8094922\n10.1016/j.molcel.2011.07.039\n10.7150/thno.37623\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b02426\n10.1063/1.5080255"}

This pathology is driven by the dysregulated proliferation of vascular fibroblasts, which can lead to coronary artery aneurysms, stenosis, and myocardial ischemia. We undertook this study to investigate whether inhibiting fibroblast proliferation might be an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent coronary artery remodeling in KD.\nWe used a murine model of KD (induced by the injection of the Candida albicans water-soluble complex [CAWS]) and analyzed patient samples to evaluate potential antifibrotic therapies for KD.\nWe identified the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as a potential therapeutic target in KD. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin potently inhibited cardiac fibroblast proliferation in vitro, and vascular fibroblasts up-regulated mTOR kinase signaling in vivo in the CAWS mouse model of KD. We evaluated the in vivo efficacy of mTOR inhibition and found that the therapeutic administration of rapamycin reduced vascular fibrosis and intimal hyperplasia of the coronary arteries in CAWS-injected mice. Furthermore, the analysis of cardiac tissue from KD fatalities revealed that vascular fibroblasts localizing with inflamed coronary arteries up-regulate mTOR signaling, confirming that the mTOR pathway is active in human KD.\nOur findings demonstrate that mTOR signaling contributes to coronary artery remodeling in KD, and that targeting this pathway offers a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or restrict this pathology in high-risk KD patients.", "journal": "Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)", "date": "2022-09-04", "authors": ["Angus TStock", "SarahParsons", "Damian BD'Silva", "Jacinta AHansen", "Varun JSharma", "FionaJames", "GrahamStarkey", "RohitD'Costa", "Claire LGordon", "Ian PWicks"], "doi": "10.1002/art.42340"}

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which majorly binds to the host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry, is used by most of the vaccine as antigen. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart and has been reported to be protective in multiple organs. Interaction of spike with ACE2 is known to reduce ACE2 expression and affect ACE2-mediated signal transduction. However, whether a spike-encoding vaccine will aggravate myocardial damage after a heart attack via affecting ACE2 remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that cardiac ACE2 is up-regulated and protective after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Infecting human cardiac cells or engineered heart tissues with a spike-based adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (AdSpike) does not affect their survival and function, whether subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation injury or not. Furthermore, AdSpike vaccination does not aggravate heart damage in wild-type or humanized ACE2 mice after I/R injury, even at a dose that is ten-fold higher as used in human.

Given the urgent need for effective treatments, many clinical trials are ongoing through repurposing approved drugs. However, clinical data regarding the cardiotoxicity of these drugs are limited. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hCMs) represent a powerful tool for assessing drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, by using hCMs, it is demonstrated that four antiviral drugs, namely, apilimod, remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, exhibit cardiotoxicity in terms of inducing cell death, sarcomere disarray, and dysregulation of calcium handling and contraction, at clinically relevant concentrations. Human engineered heart tissue (hEHT) model is used to further evaluate the cardiotoxic effects of these drugs and it is found that they weaken hEHT contractile function. RNA-seq analysis reveals that the expression of genes that regulate cardiomyocyte function, such as sarcomere organization (TNNT2, MYH6) and ion homeostasis (ATP2A2, HCN4), is significantly altered after drug treatments. Using high-throughput screening of approved drugs, it is found that ceftiofur hydrochloride, astaxanthin, and quetiapine fumarate can ameliorate the cardiotoxicity of remdesivir, with astaxanthin being the most prominent one. These results warrant caution and careful monitoring when prescribing these therapies in patients and provide drug candidates to limit remdesivir-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2022-09-03", "authors": ["HeXu", "GeLiu", "JixingGong", "YingZhang", "ShanshanGu", "ZhongjunWan", "PengchengYang", "YageNie", "YinghanWang", "Zhan-PengHuang", "GuanzhengLuo", "ZhongyanChen", "DonghuiZhang", "NanCao"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202203388\n10.1093/cvr/cvab311/6381566"}
{"title": "Mechanical response of cardiac microtissues to acute localized injury.", "abstract": "After a myocardial infarction (MI), the heart undergoes changes including local remodeling that can lead to regional abnormalities in mechanical and electrical properties, ultimately increasing the risk of arrhythmias and heart failure. Although these responses have been successfully recapitulated in animal models of MI, local changes in tissue and cell-level mechanics caused by MI remain difficult to study in vivo. Here, we developed an in vitro cardiac microtissue (CMT) injury system that through acute focal injury recapitulates aspects of the regional responses seen following an MI. With a pulsed laser, cell death was induced in the center of the microtissue causing a loss of calcium signaling and a complete loss of contractile function in the injured region and resulting in a 39% reduction in the CMT's overall force production. After 7 days, the injured area remained void of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and showed increased expression of vimentin and fibronectin, two markers for fibrotic remodeling. Interestingly, although the injured region showed minimal recovery, calcium amplitudes in uninjured regions returned to levels comparable with control. Furthermore, overall force production returned to preinjury levels despite the lack of contractile function in the injured region. Instead, uninjured regions exhibited elevated contractile function, compensating for the loss of function in the injured region, drawing parallels to changes in tissue-level mechanics seen in vivo. Overall, this work presents a new in vitro model to study cardiac tissue remodeling and electromechanical changes after injury.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Brown adipose tissue dysfunction promotes heart failure via a trimethylamine N-oxide-dependent mechanism.", "abstract": "Low body temperature predicts a poor outcome in patients with heart failure, but the underlying pathological mechanisms and implications are largely unknown. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) was initially characterised as a thermogenic organ, and recent studies have suggested it plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic metabolic health. While these reports suggest a potential link between BAT and heart failure, the potential role of BAT dysfunction in heart failure has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that alteration of BAT function contributes to development of heart failure through disorientation in choline metabolism. Thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) or myocardial infarction (MI) reduced the thermogenic capacity of BAT in mice, leading to significant reduction of body temperature with cold exposure. BAT became hypoxic with TAC or MI, and hypoxic stress induced apoptosis of brown adipocytes. Enhancement of BAT function improved thermogenesis and cardiac function in TAC mice. Conversely, systolic function was impaired in a mouse model of genetic BAT dysfunction, in association with a low survival rate after TAC. Metabolomic analysis showed that reduced BAT thermogenesis was associated with elevation of plasma trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels. Administration of TMAO to mice led to significant reduction of phosphocreatine and ATP levels in cardiac tissue via suppression of mitochondrial complex IV activity. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of flavin-containing monooxygenase reduced the plasma TMAO level in mice, and improved cardiac dysfunction in animals with left ventricular pressure overload. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, body temperature was low along with elevation of plasma choline and TMAO levels. These results suggest that maintenance of BAT homeostasis and reducing TMAO production could be potential next-generation therapies for heart failure.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-09-02", "authors": ["YohkoYoshida", "IppeiShimizu", "AtsuhiroShimada", "KeitaNakahara", "SachikoYanagisawa", "MinoruKubo", "ShinjiFukuda", "ChiharuIshii", "HiromitsuYamamoto", "TakamasaIshikawa", "KuniyukiKano", "JunkenAoki", "GoroKatsuumi", "MasayoshiSuda", "KazuyukiOzaki", "YutakaYoshida", "ShujiroOkuda", "ShigeoOhta", "ShikiOkamoto", "YasuhikoMinokoshi", "KanakoOda", "ToshikuniSasaoka", "ManabuAbe", "KenjiSakimura", "YoshiakiKubota", "NorihikoYoshimura", "ShingoKajimura", "MariaZuriaga", "KennethWalsh", "TomoyoshiSoga", "TohruMinamino"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-19245-x\n10.1253/circj.CJ-17-1184\n10.1111/joim.12328\n10.1038/nm.3145\n10.1016/j.tem.2018.01.001\n10.2337/db12-1430\n10.1172/JCI68993\n10.1172/JCI71643\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2008.02.008\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.115.002724\n10.1056/NEJMra063052\n10.1038/nature05602\n10.1152/physrev.1984.64.1.1\n10.1126/science.1186034\n10.1038/nrm.2016.62\n10.1056/NEJM198409273111303\n10.1056/NEJM199908193410806\n10.1016/j.tem.2016.10.005\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2015.10.108\n10.1016/j.fct.2009.06.040\n10.1016/j.neulet.2013.11.036\n10.1016/j.bcp.2007.09.006\n10.1016/j.bcp.2004.02.036\n10.1007/s10741-022-10254-6\n10.1016/j.jchf.2015.10.009\n10.1038/s41598-017-18756-2\n10.1253/circj.CJ-18-0468\n10.1074/jbc.R117.779678\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa241\n10.1172/JCI62308\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.07.004\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.04.049\n10.1161/Circresaha.112.274142\n10.1074/jbc.274.49.34795\n10.1128/MCB.21.1.319-329.2001\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4806\n10.1073/pnas.1710366114\n10.1007/978-1-60761-322-0_15\n10.1371/journal.pone.0021746\n10.1038/nprot.2006.478\n10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00216\n10.1093/nar/gkw1080"}

Injection of myocardial matrix hydrogels into the heart post-myocardial infarction (MI) has demonstrated increased cardiac muscle and promotion of pathways associated with cardiac development, suggesting potential promotion of cardiomyocyte turnover. In this study, the myocardial matrix hydrogel was shown to have native capability as an effective reactive oxygen species scavenger and protect against oxidative stress induced cell cycle inhibition in vitro. Encapsulation of cardiomyocytes demonstrated an enhanced turnover in in vitro studies, and in vivo assessments of myocardial matrix hydrogel treatment post-MI showed increased thymidine analog uptake in cardiomyocyte nuclei compared to saline controls. Overall, this study provides evidence that properties of the myocardial matrix material provide a microenvironment mitigating oxidative damage and supportive of cardiomyocytes undergoing DNA synthesis, toward possible DNA repair or cell cycle activation.

Injection of a myocardial matrix hydrogel into the heart post-MI previously demonstrated increased cardiac muscle and promotion of pathways associated with cardiac development, suggesting potential in promoting proliferation of cardiomyocytes. In this study, the myocardial matrix hydrogel was shown to protect cells from oxidative stress and increase proliferation in vitro. In a rat MI model, greater presence of tissue free thiol content spared from oxidative damage, lesser mitochondrial superoxide content, and increased thymidine analog uptake in cardiomyocytes was found in matrix injected animals compared to saline controls.

Thus, dopamine receptor antagonist antipsychotic drugs are commonly used to treat multiple psychiatric disorders.

Consequently, therapies for certain psychiatric disorders which target dopamine receptors could have unidentified consequences on certain functions of these peripheral tissues. The existence of an intrinsic dopaminergic system in the human heart remains controversial and debated within the literature. Therefore, this review focuses on literature related to dopamine receptors within cardiac tissue, specifically dopamine receptor 3 (D3R), and summarizes the current state of knowledge while highlighting areas of research which may be lacking.

There is still debate regarding whether SBRT has a predominant effect in the early or late period after the procedure. We sought to assess the time course of SBRT's efficacy as well as the value of using a blanking period following a SBRT session.\nEight patients (mean age 58\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u00a0years) underwent eight SBRT sessions for refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). SBRT was given using a linear accelerator device with a total dose of 25\u00a0Gy to the targeted area.\nDuring a median follow-up of 8\u00a0months, all patients demonstrated VT recurrences; however, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and anti-tachycardia pacing therapies were significantly reduced with SBRT (8.46 to 0.83/per month, p\u2009=\u20090.047; 18.50 to 3.29/per month, p\u2009=\u20090.036, respectively). While analyzing the temporal SBRT outcomes, the 2\u00a0weeks to 3\u00a0months period demonstrated the most favorable outcomes. After 6\u00a0months, one patient was ICD therapy-free and the remaining patients demonstrated VT episodes.\nOur findings showed that the SBRT was associated with a marked reduction in the burden of VT and ICD interventions especially during first 3\u00a0months.

{"title": "Irisin Regulates Cardiac Responses to Exercise in Health and Diseases: a Narrative Review.", "abstract": "Exercise has been recognized as an important non-pharmacological approach for the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanisms of exercise in promoting cardiovascular health remain unclear. Exercise generates cardiac benefits via stimulating muscle to secret hundreds of myokines that directly enter circulation and target heart tissue. Therefore, inter-organ communication between skeletal muscle and heart may be one important regulating pattern, and such communication can occur through secretion of molecules, frequently known as myokines. Irisin, a newly identified myokine, is cleaved from fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) and secreted by the stimulation of exercise. Recently, accumulating evidence focusing on the interaction between irisin and cardiac function has been reported. This review highlights the molecular signaling by which irisin regulates the benefits of exercise on cardiac function both in physiological and pathological process, and discusses the clinical potential of irisin in treating heart diseases. Exercise generates various cardiovascular benefits through stimulating skeletal muscle to secrete irisin. The exercise \"hormone\" irisin, both produced by exercise or recombinant form, exerts therapeutic effects in a group of cardiovascular disorders including heart failure, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis and hypertension. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain ambiguous.This review highlights the most up-to-date findings to bridge the gap between exercise, irisin and cardiovascular diseases, and discusses the potential clinical prospect of irisin.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular translational research", "date": "2022-08-30", "authors": ["BaishuZhu", "BinWang", "ChenZhao", "YuanxinWang", "YalanZhou", "JunjieLin", "RenqingZhao"], "doi": "10.1007/s12265-022-10310-4\n10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02144-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9\n10.1177/2050312119860401\n10.1016/S0735-1097(85)80165-0\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz859\n10.1097/00005768-200106001-00007\n10.1001/jama.281.4.327\n10.1001/jama.1996.03540030039029\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60749-6\n10.1002/dvdy.10099\n10.1016/S0378-1119(02)00828-4\n10.1038/nature10777\n10.1016/j.metabol.2012.09.002\n10.1155/2020/1949415\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.08.001\n10.1016/j.numecd.2019.09.025\n10.1111/febs.12619\n10.1186/s12986-018-0298-3\n10.1016/j.metabol.2015.05.010\n10.1016/j.diabres.2013.01.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094235\n10.1111/cen.12658\n10.1002/cbin.11441\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.077\n10.3399/bjgp10X502137\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000350\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs215\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61340-X\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.02.050\n10.1080/10520295.2017.1303194\n10.1371/journal.pone.0181461\n10.1002/jcp.27037\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2014.04.025\n10.1016/j.metabol.2017.05.002\n10.1111/jcmm.15180\n10.18632/aging.102899\n10.1038/s41401-019-0230-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166182\n10.1016/S0005-2728(98)00120-0\n10.1089/ars.2010.3363\n10.1074/jbc.M702294200\n10.1111/jcmm.15127\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.265819\n10.1080/15548627.2019.1591672\n10.1111/bph.12516\n10.1113/JP271301\n10.1083/jcb.200809125\n10.1016/j.febslet.2010.02.017\n10.1002/ctm2.166\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31071-1\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.07.250\n10.1042/CS20190016\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.01.031\n10.1152/ajpheart.00554.2011\n10.1007/s11010-008-9803-8\n10.1152/ajpcell.2001.280.1.C53\n10.1038/nm1574\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.01.001\n10.1007/s11897-012-0102-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311147\n10.1201/9781315151311\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.637793\n10.1001/jama.2009.1063\n10.1002/path.1711710311\n10.1172/JCI116670\n10.1371/journal.pone.0158038\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2015.10.020\n10.1161/JAHA.116.004031\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32225-6\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00240.x\n10.1016/j.tips.2008.05.003\n10.1111/j.1524-6175.2006.06032.x\n10.1002/j.1932-8737.1997.tb00009.x\n10.1139/apnm-2019-0602\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003433\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0706639\n10.1016/S0272-6386(96)90519-3\n10.1038/srep22780\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.09767\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.160\n10.1007/s10557-015-6580-y\n10.1093/cvr/cvy023\n10.1590/S0100-879X1997000300004\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.040\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.155663\n10.1097/01.psy.0000116719.95524.e2\n10.1038/ajh.2010.154\n10.1016/0006-8993(92)90282-E\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.1998.tb02235.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvp160\n10.1007/s12012-012-9184-9\n10.1016/j.taap.2020.114953\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.002\n10.1161/01.RES.68.6.1560\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.010908.163111\n10.1126/science.1077857\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136816\n10.1186/s13287-020-01746-z\n10.1109/RBME.2015.2431681\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2019.05.009\n10.1515/jbcpp-2018-0090\n10.1152/ajpheart.00443.2015\n10.2337/diacare.26.10.2947\n10.1038/nutd.2017.3\n10.1185/030079903125003008\n10.1038/nutd.2014.7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.06.013\n10.1007/s11883-017-0678-6\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000608\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.06.038\n10.26402/jpp.2018.1.13\n10.1620/tjem.233.135\n10.7717/peerj.3669\n10.1016/S0899-9007(96)00000-8\n10.1093/cvr/cvq076\n10.1007/s10753-017-0685-3\n10.4161/adip.26082\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.025"}
{"title": "Perspectives for Forkhead box transcription factors in diabetic cardiomyopathy: Their therapeutic potential and possible effects of salvianolic acids.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic cardiovascular complications, which initially manifests as cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, dysfunctional remodeling, and diastolic dysfunction, followed by systolic dysfunction, and eventually end with acute heart failure. Molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological changes in diabetic hearts are complicated and multifactorial, including but not limited to insulin resistance, oxidative stress, lipotoxicity, cardiomyocytes apoptosis or autophagy, inflammatory response, and myocardial metabolic dysfunction. With the development of molecular biology technology, accumulating evidence illustrates that members of the class O of Forkhead box (FoxO) transcription factors are vital for maintaining cardiomyocyte metabolism and cell survival, and the functions of the FoxO family proteins can be modulated by a wide variety of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, arginine methylation, and O-glycosylation. In this review, we highlight and summarize the most recent advances in two members of the FoxO family (predominately FoxO1 and FoxO3a) that are abundantly expressed in cardiac tissue and whose levels of gene and protein expressions change as DCM progresses, with the goal of providing valuable insights into the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular complications and discussing their therapeutic potential and possible effects of salvianolic acids, a natural product.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-08-30", "authors": ["RonghuiHan", "HemengHuang", "WeiyiXia", "JingjinLiu", "HuiLuo", "JingTang", "ZhengyuanXia"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2022.951597\n10.2337/dbi17-0013\n10.1007/BF00421230\n10.1097/00019501-199602000-00002\n10.1155/2012/939751\n10.1038/nrendo.2015.216\n10.1007/s00125-019-4959-1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.315913\n10.1186/s13578-021-00700-7\n10.1089/ars.2010.3419\n10.1155/2014/925350\n10.1111/jdi.12651\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135931\n10.1111/jcmm.15935\n10.1111/jcmm.15418\n10.1186/s40779-021-00353-0\n10.7150/thno.48561\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079739\n10.1111/febs.16221\n10.1007/978-1-4939-8900-3_1\n10.1038/onc.2008.20\n10.1007/s10555-020-09883-w\n10.1089/ars.2005.7.752\n10.1093/cvr/cvs426\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600279\n10.1042/bst0310292\n10.1042/BJ20040167\n10.4161/cc.4.7.1796\n10.1073/pnas.1915719117\n10.1111/acel.12120\n10.1895/wormbook.1.164.1\n10.1016/s1534-5807(04)00095-4\n10.1038/s41419-020-03244-9\n10.1186/bcr3039\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.03.001\n10.1093/jmcb/mjr013\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.01.014\n10.1073/pnas.0502738102\n10.1016/j.tibs.2004.12.002\n10.1126/science.1094637\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.04.013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227371\n10.1007/s10753-020-01242-9\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.03.012\n10.1016/j.tcb.2004.07.006\n10.3390/cells10123577\n10.1073/pnas.0406789102\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002819\n10.1038/ncb1676\n10.1038/ncb1469\n10.1002/clc.4960211205\n10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2022.101156\n10.1113/JP276747\n10.1038/s41569-020-0339-2\n10.3389/fmed.2021.695792\n10.2337/dc13-2116\n10.1007/s11684-021-0881-2\n10.3390/cells10113259\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01514\n10.1155/2013/461967\n10.1016/j.plefa.2011.04.018\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00639\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.613979\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.837237\n10.1016/0033-0620(72)90029-1\n10.1016/j.hfc.2012.06.008\n10.4330/wjc.v6.i1.8\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.2012.05738.x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.01.038\n10.1093/cvr/26.4.409\n10.1530/EC-14-0092\n10.1152/ajpheart.00520.2017\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.025\n10.4093/dmj.2019.0185\n10.1002/jcp.27217\n10.1111/apha.13430\n10.1007/s00424-021-02650-y\n10.1007/s00424-021-02651-x\n10.1152/ajpcell.00248.2010\n10.3389/fcell.2021.750382\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2014.05.020\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.08.021\n10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2009.02.005\n10.1900/RDS.2013.10.58\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00042\n10.1007/s00018-020-03587-8\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.707336\n10.1385/ct:3:3:219\n10.2337/diabetes.51.6.1938\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111410\n10.1038/labinvest.3780057\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00833.x\n10.1186/s12933-021-01245-2\n10.1007/s11010-019-03604-w\n10.1007/s00592-021-01713-x\n10.1155/2019/1957920\n10.1038/s41419-022-04587-1\n10.1016/j.mam.2019.09.006\n10.3390/cells10082114\n10.4093/dmj.2020.0049\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.014\n10.1161/01.res.87.12.1123\n10.1038/s41401-020-0490-7\n10.1155/2021/6617816\n10.1371/journal.pone.0104771\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00519\n10.1111/jcmm.15318\n10.3389/fphys.2021.791848\n10.1080/15384101.2020.1831245\n10.1016/j.bcp.2020.114246\n10.1152/ajpheart.00151.2016\n10.1038/s41419-021-04484-z\n10.1007/s00018-016-2194-1\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.710963\n10.3389/fcell.2021.701788\n10.2337/db19-1176\n10.1016/j.apsb.2021.10.005\n10.1016/j.biocel.2019.105659\n10.1172/JCI60329\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.01.018\n10.1073/pnas.0400093101\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.163428\n10.1172/JCI23126\n10.1016/j.acvd.2021.08.004\n10.1016/j.arr.2021.101338\n10.1080/15548627.2017.1378838\n10.3892/ijmm.2018.3832\n10.1016/j.apsb.2015.07.009\n10.2147/DMSO.S325030\n10.1093/cvr/cvz014\n10.3390/ijms221050940\n10.1111/jcmm.15725\n10.1155/2015/184938\n10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00005\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.06.019\n10.1007/s12265-020-09984-5\n10.3892/ijmm.2017.3101\n10.1016/j.molmet.2018.09.011\n10.26508/lsa.201900356\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111872\n10.1016/j.gene.2021.145968\n10.1073/pnas.1918673117\n10.4161/auto.21830\n10.1038/aps.2017.193\n10.1155/2020/5472096\n10.14670/HH-18-048\n10.1007/s11655-016-2747-z\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31822de355\n10.1007/s00210-019-01755-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166560\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.01.009\n10.1007/s11655-012-1052-8\n10.1016/j.apsb.2019.01.010\n10.1155/2022/8332825\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2017.11.016\n10.1139/y07-092\n10.1016/s0022-5223(03)00970-x\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2007.01.004"}
{"title": "Cmarr/miR-540-3p axis promotes cardiomyocyte maturation transition by orchestrating Dtna expression.", "abstract": "The immature phenotype of embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs) limits their application. However, the molecular mechanisms of cardiomyocyte maturation remain largely unexplored. This study found that overexpression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-Cmarr, which was highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, promoted the maturation change and physiological maturation of mouse ESC-CMs (mESC-CMs). Moreover, transplantation of cardiac patch overexpressing Cmarr exhibited better retention of mESC-CMs, reduced infarct area by enhancing vascular density in the host heart, and improved cardiac function in mice after myocardial infarction. Mechanism studies identified that Cmarr acted as a competitive endogenous RNA to impede the repression of miR-540-3p on Dtna expression and promoted the binding of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and yes-associated protein (YAP), which in turn reduced the proportion of nuclear YAP and the expression of YAP target genes. Therefore, this study revealed the function and mechanism of Cmarr in promoting cardiomyocyte maturation and provided a lncRNA that can be used as a functional factor in the construction of cardiac patches for the treatment of myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Molecular therapy.

{"title": "ANGPTL8 promotes adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells: potential role in ectopic lipid deposition.", "abstract": "Ectopic lipid deposition plays a promoting role in many chronic metabolic diseases. Abnormal adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is an important cause of lipid deposition in organs. Studies have shown that serum angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) levels are increased in patients with many chronic metabolic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hepatic steatosis), while the role of ANGPTL8 in ectopic lipid accumulation has not been reported.\nWe used the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to analyze the expression of ANGPTL8 in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients and qPCR to analyze the expression of ANGPTL8 in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. To explore the potential roles of ANGPTL8 in the progression of ectopic lipid deposition, ANGPTL8 knockout (KO) mice were constructed, and obesity models were induced by diet and ovariectomy (OVX). We analyzed lipid deposition (TG) in the liver, kidney, and heart tissues of different groups of mice by Oil Red O, Sudan black B staining, and the single reagent GPO-PAP method. We isolated and characterized MSCs to analyze the regulatory effect of ANGPTL8 on Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin, a key pathway in adipogenic differentiation. Finally, we used the pathway activator LiCl and a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor (i.e., CHIR99021) to analyze the regulatory mechanism of this pathway by ANGPTL8.\nANGPTL8 is highly expressed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients and the liver of HFD-induced obese mice. Both normal chow diet (NCD)- and HFD-treated ANGPTL8 KO male mice gained significantly less weight than wild-type (WT) male mice and reduced ectopic lipid deposition in organs. However, the female mice of ANGPTL8 KO, especially the HFD group, did not show differences in body weight or ectopic lipid deposition because HFD could induce estrogen overexpression and then downregulate ANGPTL8 expression, thereby counteracting the reduction in HFD-induced ectopic lipid deposition by ANGPTL8 deletion, and this result was also further proven by the OVX model. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ANGPTL8 could promote the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin pathway and upregulating PPAR\u03b3 and c/EBP\u03b1 mRNA expression.\nANGPTL8 promotes the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes, suggesting that ANGPTL8 may be a new target for the prevention and treatment of ectopic lipid deposition in males.", "journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "date": "2022-08-30", "authors": ["JianTang", "ShinanMa", "YujiuGao", "FanZeng", "YingFeng", "ChongGuo", "LinHu", "LinglingYang", "YanghuiChen", "QiufangZhang", "YahongYuan", "XingrongGuo"], "doi": "10.3389/fendo.2022.927763\n10.1186/s12986-019-0336-9\n10.1016/j.cmet.2014.05.002\n10.3390/ijms20092358\n10.1038/s41591-018-0104-9\n10.3390/cells8080784\n10.1038/ijo.2012.171\n10.1096/fj.10-171439\n10.3109/13813455.2011.571700\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010818-021304\n10.1097/MOL.0000000000000600\n10.1016/j.plipres.2020.101067\n10.1210/jc.2016-2084\n10.1016/j.gene.2019.04.048\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2019.112965\n10.1093/nar/gks1193\n10.4252/wjsc.v12.i10.1152\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2014.05.017\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7163-3_16\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106632\n10.1053/j.gastro.2021.05.008\n10.1016/j.canlet.2021.01.003\n10.1186/s13287-021-02250-8\n10.3390/jcm10061326\n10.2337/db21-0050\n10.1038/s41430-018-0323-7\n10.7326/M15-1774\n10.1056/NEJMoa060326\n10.1007/s00204-016-1737-4\n10.1007/s00125-019-05040-3\n10.1210/clinem/dgab120\n10.1210/clinem/dgab120\n10.1098/rsob.210106\n10.1038/srep24013\n10.1073/pnas.1315292110\n10.1002/dc.21390\n10.1006/eesa.2001.2135\n10.1080/10495398.2020.1845711\n10.1080/10495398.2020.1845711\n10.4252/wjsc.v11.i3.147\n10.1016/j.mce.2008.05.005"}

Likewise, conductive polymers (CP) appear promising electroactive biomaterial for proliferation of cells. Herein, we have investigated CNT blends with two different conductive polymers, polypyrrole/CNT (PPy/CNT) and PEDOT/CNT to evaluate the growth, survival, and beating behavior of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM). The combination of CP/CNT not only shows excellent biocompatibility on NRVM, after 2\u00a0weeks of culture, but also exerts functional effects on networks of cardiomyocytes. NRVMs cultured on CNT-based substrates exhibited improved cellular function, i.e., homogeneous, non-arrhythmogenic, and more frequent spontaneous beating; particularly PEDOT/CNT substrates, which yielded to higher beating amplitudes, thus suggesting a more mature cardiac phenotype. Furthermore, cells presented enhanced structure: aligned sarcomeres, organized and abundant Connexin 43 (Cx43). Finally, no signs of induced hypertrophy were observed. In conclusion, the combination of CNT with CP produces high viability and promotes cardiac functionality, suggesting great potential to generate scaffolding supports for cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Cell biology and toxicology", "date": "2022-08-28", "authors": ["NuriaAlegret", "AntonioDominguez-Alfaro", "DavidMecerreyes", "MaurizioPrato", "LuisaMestroni", "BrisaPe\u00f1a"], "doi": "10.1007/s10565-022-09753-x\n10.1021/acsami.8b16462\n10.1002/jbm.a.36894\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00239\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300282\n10.1016/j.polymer.2022.124952\n10.1021/acsapm.1c01929\n10.1021/acscentsci.1c00712\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b01316\n10.1021/acsami.0c16645\n10.1002/marc.202100100\n10.1038/nnano.2010.246\n10.1021/cn300048q\n10.1371/journal.pone.0073621\n10.1039/C9LC00636B\n10.1039/c2jm32165c\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1038/s41427-018-0014-9\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.010\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121008\n10.1021/nl802855c\n10.1126/science.aan1227\n10.1021/nn4002193\n10.1021/nl204064s\n10.1126/sciadv.1601007\n10.1016/j.nano.2017.01.020\n10.1021/acsabm.1c00133\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.005\n10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01734\n10.1021/acsami.7b11438\n10.1038/nmat2441\n10.1002/adfm.201803951\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.007\n10.1038/nrn1827\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209809\n10.1021/acsmaterialslett.1c00146\n10.1021/acsami.1c04631\n10.1021/acsami.9b21066"}

However, the poor water solubility of many HP constituents limits their therapeutic effectiveness. Self-nanoemulsifying self-nanosuspension loaded with HP (HP.SNESNS) was formulated to improve the bioefficacy of HP. It was prepared using 10% triacetin, 57% Tween 20, and 33% PEG 400 and then incorporated with HP extract (100\u00a0mg/mL). HP.SNESNS demonstrated a bimodal size distribution (258.65\u2009\u00b1\u200929.35 and 9.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0nm) corresponding to nanosuspension and nanoemulsion, respectively, a zeta potential of -8.03\u00a0mV, and an enhanced dissolution profile. Compared to the unformulated HP (100\u00a0mg/kg), HP.SNESNS significantly improved cardiac functions by decreasing the serum myocardial enzymes, nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) as well as restoring the heart tissue's normal architecture. Furthermore, it ameliorates anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and cognitive dysfunction by decreasing brain TNF-\u03b1, elevating neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and serotonin), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition, HP.SNESNS augmented the immunohistochemical expression of cortical and hippocampal glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels while downregulating the cortical Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression levels. Surprisingly, these protective activities were comparable to the HP (300\u00a0mg/kg).

Then, an aqueous biocompatible hydrazided hyaluronic acid (HHA) solution encapsulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is impregnated into the anchored carpet to form HHA@ODS@HP-\u03b2-CD@Res hydrogel in situ via click reaction, thus prolonging the in vivo retention time of therapeutic drug and cells. Importantly, the HHA added to outer surface consumes the remaining aldehydes to contribute to nonsticky top surface, avoiding adhesion to other tissues.

In the present work, different scaffolds prepared with sodium alginate and chitosan (alginate/chitosan) were fabricated with and without the addition of metal nanoparticles and how their fabrication affects cardiomyocyte growth was evaluated. The scaffolds (hydrogels) were dried by freeze drying using calcium gluconate as a crosslinking agent, and two types of metal nanoparticles were incorporated, gold (AuNp) and gold plus sodium alginate (AuNp+Alg). A physicochemical characterization of the scaffolds was carried out by swelling, degradation, permeability and infrared spectroscopy studies. The results show that the scaffolds obtained were highly porous (>90%) and hydrophilic, with swelling percentages of around 3000% and permeability of the order of 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 m2. In addition, the scaffolds proposed favored adhesion and spheroid formation, with cardiac markers expression such as tropomyosin, troponin I and cardiac myosin.

{"title": "Mutational Assessment in ", "abstract": "(1) Background globe. The etiology of CHDs is complex and involves both genetic and non-genetic factors. Although, significant progress has been made in deciphering the genetic components involved in CHDs, recent reports have revealed that mutations in Nk2 homeobox5 (NKX2-5) and actin alpha cardiac muscle1 (ACTC1) genes play a key role in CHDs such as atrial and ventricular septum defects. Therefore, the present study evaluates the role of key hotspot mutations in NKX2-5 and ACTC1 genes of congenital cardiac septal defect (CCSD) in ethnic Kashmiri population. (2) Methods: A total of 112 confirmed CHD patients were included in the current study, of which 30 patients were evaluated for mutational analysis for hotspot mutations of NKX2-5 and ACTC1 genes. The total genomic DNA was extracted from the samples (cardiac tissue/blood) and were subjected to amplification for NKX2-5 (exon 1 and 2), and ACTC1 (exon 2) genes by using PCR specific primers to analyze the hotspot mutations in respective exons. The amplified products obtained were sent to Macrogen Korea for sequencing by Sanger\u2019s method. (3) Results: Our results confirmed that not a single mutation was found in either hotspot exon 1 and 2 of NKX2-5 and exon 2 of ACTC1 in the patients included in the current study. Interestingly, a novel synonymous nucleotide variation leading to G > C transversion (GCG > GCC) was found in exon 2 of NKX2-5 gene of CCSD patient. (4) Conclusions: The current findings demonstrated the role of NKX2-5 and ACTC1 in cardiac development. The study will provide an insight in understanding the genetic etiology and highlights the role of newly identified mutations in patients with CDS\u2019s in ethnic Kashmiri population. In silico findings revealed amino acid changes, splice site variation and the creation of new site.

{"title": "The heart of cardiac reprogramming: The cardiac fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, outpacing pulmonary disease, infectious disease, and all forms of cancer. Myocardial infarction (MI) dominates cardiovascular disease, contributing to four out of five cardiovascular related deaths. Following MI, patients suffer adverse and irreversible myocardial remodeling associated with cardiomyocyte loss and infiltration of fibrotic scar tissue. Current therapies following MI only mitigate the cardiac physiological decline rather than restore damaged myocardium function. Direct cardiac reprogramming is one strategy that has promise in repairing injured cardiac tissue by generating new, functional cardiomyocytes from cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). With the ectopic expression of transcription factors, microRNAs, and small molecules, CFs can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) that display molecular signatures, structures, and contraction abilities similar to endogenous cardiomyocytes. The in vivo induction of iCMs following MI leads to significant reduction in fibrotic cardiac remodeling and improved heart function, indicating reprogramming is a viable option for repairing damaged heart tissue. Recent work has illustrated different methods to understand the mechanisms driving reprogramming, in an effort to improve the efficiency of iCM generation and create an approach translational into clinic.

{"title": "Bioactive Extract of Morel Mushroom, Morchella esculenta (Ascomycota) Attenuates Doxorubicin-Induced Oxidative Stress Leading to Myocardial Injury.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an extensively used anticancer drug for chemotherapy. Cardiotoxicity induced by DOX is an impediment in its clinical use. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of a bioactive extract of an excellently edible morel mushroom, Morchella esculenta (ME) to attenuate DOX - induced cardiotoxicity. Protective effect of ME against DOX-induced cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro by MTT assay using H9C2 cardiomyoblast cells. Intracellular free radical generation and mitochondrial membrane damage caused by DOX were detected by DCF-DA and rhodamine-123 dyes. Elevation of activities of creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase and troponin I level consequent to the administration of DOX were determined using diagnostic kits. Depletion of endogenous antioxidant levels in myocardium was determined by spectrophotometric assays. Cardiac tissue damage caused by DOX was assessed by histopathological examination. ME reduced cytotoxicity caused by DOX at concentrations of 150 and 200 \u03bcg (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Cardiac injury marker levels elevated by DOX were significantly down regulated by ME (p < 0.01). Endogenous antioxidants such as SOD, GPx, and GSH depleted by DOX administration were restored to almost normal level by ME. This indicated the effect of ME to ameliorate oxidative stress caused by DOX administration leading to myocardial injury. Histopathological observation supported the finding. Being an excellently edible mushroom, current study indicates the potential therapeutic use of M. esculenta to prevent DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The findings also suggest the clinical use of this medicinal mushroom to prevent chemo drug-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "International journal of medicinal mushrooms", "date": "2022-08-24", "authors": ["SnehaDas", "Kainoor KrishnankuttyJanardhanan", "B S HarikumaranThampi"], "doi": "10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2022044516"}
{"title": "Engineering approaches for cardiac organoid formation and their characterization.", "abstract": "Cardiac organoids are 3-dimensional (3D) structures composed of tissue or niche-specific cells, obtained from diverse sources, encapsulated in either a naturally derived or synthetic, extracellular matrix scaffold, and include exogenous biochemical signals such as essential growth factors. The overarching goal of developing cardiac organoid models is to establish a functional integration of cardiomyocytes with physiologically relevant cells, tissues, and structures like capillary-like networks composed of endothelial cells. These organoids used to model human heart anatomy, physiology, and disease pathologies in vitro have the potential to solve many issues related to cardiovascular drug discovery and fundamental research. The advent of patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiovascular cells provide a unique, single-source approach to study the complex process of cardiovascular disease progression through organoid formation and incorporation into relevant, controlled microenvironments such as microfluidic devices. Strategies that aim to accomplish such a feat include microfluidic technology-based approaches, microphysiological systems, microwells, microarray-based platforms, 3D bioprinted models, and electrospun fiber mat-based scaffolds. This article discusses the engineering or technology-driven practices for making cardiac organoid models in comparison with self-assembled or scaffold-free methods to generate organoids. We further discuss emerging strategies for characterization of the bio-assembled cardiac organoids including electrophysiology and machine-learning and conclude with prospective points of interest for engineering cardiac tissues in vitro.", "journal": "Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine", "date": "2022-08-23", "authors": ["BinataJoddar", "Sylvia LNatividad-Diaz", "Andie EPadilla", "Aibhlin AEsparza", "Salma PRamirez", "David RChambers", "HakimaIbaroudene"], "doi": "10.1016/j.trsl.2022.08.009"}

Insight into oxido-inflammatory and apoptosis modulation.", "abstract": "The prevalence of cardiovascular complications in diabetes has become one of the major cause of diabetes related morbidity/mortality. The onset and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been majorly linked to lipid alterations, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. This present study investigated the cardioprotective role of Lycium chinense leaf extract (LCME) in fructose/streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Diabetic animals were orally gavaged with LCME (100 and 400\u00a0mg/kg) for five weeks. The results indicated that diabetic rats showed increased blood glucose concentration, serum cardiac function markers (troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase) and lipid profile (triglycerides and cholesterol). In addition, the cardiac tissues of diabetic rats showed increased levels of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 beta (IL 1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), caspase-3 and malondialdehyde as well as significantly reduced activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase. LCME significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and markedly decreased serum concentrations of troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, triglycerides and cholesterol. Furthermore, LCME notably suppressed cardiac oxido-inflammatory mediators and boosted cardiac antioxidant defense. Histopathologically, LCME restored cardiac structural alterations and also suppressed the immunohistochemical expression of collagen IV, smooth muscle alpha-actin (\u03b1-SMA) and p53, while Bcl2 expression was significantly increased. In conclusion, our result indicated that LCME protected against diabetic cardiomyopathy suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2022-08-23", "authors": ["ChaolingWen", "ChunhongLiu", "YetianLi", "TaibaoXia", "XiaohaiZhang", "ShuangtaoXue", "Opeyemi JoshuaOlatunji"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113583"}

{"title": "Sustained over-expression of calpain-2 induces age-dependent dilated cardiomyopathy in mice through aberrant autophagy.", "abstract": "Calpains have been implicated in heart diseases. While calpain-1 has been detrimental to the heart, the role of calpain-2 in cardiac pathology remains controversial. In this study we investigated whether sustained over-expression of calpain-2 had any adverse effects on the heart and the underlying mechanisms. Double transgenic mice (Tg-Capn2/tTA) were generated, which express human CAPN2 restricted to cardiomyocytes. The mice were subjected to echocardiography at age 3, 6, 8 and 12 months, and their heart tissues and sera were collected for analyses. We showed that transgenic mice over-expressing calpain-2 restricted to cardiomyocytes had normal heart function with no evidence of cardiac pathological remodeling at age 3 months. However, they exhibited features of dilated cardiomyopathy including increased heart size, enlarged heart chambers and heart dysfunction from age 8 months; histological analysis revealed loss of cardiomyocytes replaced by myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in transgenic mice from age 8 months. These cardiac alterations closely correlated with aberrant autophagy evidenced by significantly increased LC3BII and p62 protein levels and accumulation of autophagosomes in the hearts of transgenic mice. Notably, injection of 3-methyladenine, a well-established inhibitor of autophagy (30\u2009mg/kg, i.p. once every 3 days starting from age 6 months for 2 months) prevented aberrant autophagy, attenuated myocardial injury and improved heart function in the transgenic mice. In cultured cardiomyocytes, over-expression of calpain-2 blocked autophagic flux by impairing lysosomal function. Furthermore, over-expression of calpain-2 resulted in lower levels of junctophilin-2 protein in the heart of transgenic mice and in cultured cardiomyocytes, which was attenuated by 3-methyladenine. In addition, blockade of autophagic flux by bafilomycin A (100\u2009nM) induced a reduction of junctophilin-2 protein in cardiomyocytes. In summary, transgenic over-expression of calpain-2 induces age-dependent dilated cardiomyopathy in mice, which may be mediated through aberrant autophagy and a reduction of junctophilin-2. Thus, a sustained increase in calpain-2 may be detrimental to the heart.", "journal": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "date": "2022-08-20", "authors": ["Xiao-YunJi", "DongZheng", "RuiNi", "Jin-XiWang", "Jian-QiangShao", "ZerVue", "AntentorHinton", "Long-ShengSong", "Guo-ChangFan", "SubrataChakrabarti", "Zhao-LiangSu", "Tian-QingPeng"], "doi": "10.1038/s41401-022-00965-9\n10.1152/physrev.00029.2002\n10.1093/cvr/cvs157\n10.1074/jbc.M112.358929\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2015.01.019\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.08.005\n10.2337/db15-0963\n10.1128/MCB.05189-11\n10.1186/1471-213X-6-3\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.037\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.06.010\n10.1074/jbc.M114.567206\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.115.002383\n10.1093/cvr/cvp100\n10.1093/jb/mvab100\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2018.05.004\n10.1007/s00395-019-0726-1\n10.1007/s00204-019-02405-w\n10.1002/jcp.24999\n10.1002/jcp.27750\n10.1002/jcb.25176\n10.1007/s00395-019-0730-5\n10.1152/ajpcell.00190.2019\n10.15252/emmm.201708237\n10.1042/BCJ20210629\n10.1161/01.RES.0000065442.64694.9F\n10.2337/db09-1800\n10.3390/cells11010065\n10.3390/cells10092177\n10.1074/jbc.M207288200\n10.1083/jcb.200601024\n10.4161/auto.3661\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1063871\n10.1074/jbc.M109.080796\n10.1074/jbc.M115.652396\n10.1093/cvr/cvp189\n10.1152/ajpheart.00748.2015\n10.2337/db10-1333\n10.1155/2016/4639654\n10.1007/s00395-020-0807-1\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.09.022\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020502\n10.1161/01.RES.0000261924.76669.36\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.041814\n10.1016/j.virusres.2013.10.014\n10.1111/jcmm.15577\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.110.958694\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.212324\n10.1073/pnas.1412729111\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.10.021"}

Unavailability of cardiac tissue has hindered the comprehensive exploration of gene regulatory networks and nodal players in DCM. In this study, we carried out integrated analysis of transcriptome and methylome data using non-negative matrix factorization from a cohort of DCM patients to uncover underlying latent factors and covarying features between whole-transcriptome and epigenome omics datasets from tissue biopsies of living patients. DNA methylation data from Infinium HM450 and mRNA Illumina sequencing of n = 33 DCM and n = 24 control probands were filtered, analyzed and used as input for matrix factorization using R NMF package. Mann-Whitney U test showed 4 out of 5 latent factors are significantly different between DCM and control probands (P<0.05). Characterization of top 10% features driving each latent factor showed a significant enrichment of biological processes known to be involved in DCM pathogenesis, including immune response (P = 3.97E-21), nucleic acid binding (P = 1.42E-18), extracellular matrix (P = 9.23E-14) and myofibrillar structure (P = 8.46E-12).

{"title": "Disease-associated inosine misincorporation into RNA hinders translation.", "abstract": "Failure to prevent accumulation of the non-canonical nucleotide inosine triphosphate (ITP) by inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) during nucleotide synthesis results in misincorporation of inosine into RNA and can cause severe and fatal developmental anomalies in humans. While the biochemical activity of ITPase is well understood, the pathogenic basis of ITPase deficiency and the molecular and cellular consequences of ITP misincorporation into RNA remain cryptic. Here, we demonstrate that excess ITP in the nucleotide pool during in vitro transcription results in T7 polymerase-mediated inosine misincorporation in luciferase RNA. In vitro translation of inosine-containing luciferase RNA reduces resulting luciferase activity, which is only partly explained by reduced abundance of the luciferase protein produced. Using Oxford Nanopore Direct RNA sequencing, we reveal inosine misincorporation to be stochastic but biased largely towards misincorporation in place of guanosine, with evidence for misincorporation also in place of cytidine, adenosine and uridine. Inosine misincorporation into RNA is also detected in Itpa-null mouse embryonic heart tissue as an increase in relative variants compared with the wild type using Illumina RNA sequencing. By generating CRISPR/Cas9 rat H9c2 Itpa-null cardiomyoblast cells, we validate a translation defect in cells that accumulate inosine within endogenous RNA. Furthermore, we observe hindered cellular translation of transfected luciferase RNA containing misincorporated inosine in both wild-type and Itpa-null cells. We therefore conclude that inosine misincorporation into RNA perturbs translation, thus providing mechanistic insight linking ITPase deficiency, inosine accumulation and pathogenesis.", "journal": "Nucleic acids research", "date": "2022-08-19", "authors": ["Jacob HSchroader", "Lindsey AJones", "RyanMeng", "Hannah KShorrock", "Jared IRichardson", "Sharon MShaughnessy", "QishanLin", "Thomas JBegley", "J AndrewBerglund", "GabrieleFuchs", "Mark THandley", "KaalakReddy"], "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkac709"}

This study was carried out to investigate the protective effects of ethanolic leaf extract of Gongronema latifolium (GL) in dexamethasone (DEX)-induced myocardial injury. Wistar rats were assigned to 4 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06) namely, control, GL, DEX, and DEX+GL groups. DEX (35\u2009\u03bcg/kg body weight) was administered subcutaneously to induce myocardial injury, while GL leaf extract (200\u2009mg/kg body weight) was administered orally. Both agents were administered to their respective groups for 14\u2009days. DEX (p\u2009<\u2009.05) decreased nitric oxide and increased angiotensin-converting enzyme activity compared with the control. Serum superoxide dismutase activity and bilirubin level were decreased (p\u2009<\u2009.05), while malondialdehyde level was increased (p\u2009<\u2009.05) in the DEX group. Serum liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6), and cardiac injury biomarkers (creatinine kinase, cardiac troponin-T, and lactate dehydrogenase) were significantly (p\u2009<\u2009.05) increased in the DEX group relative to the control. Administration of GL leaf extract attenuated these changes significantly. The study therefore suggests that GL is beneficial in the treatment of myocardial injury via the downregulation of high serum concentration of cardiac biomarkers, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory biomarkers released as a result of the insult caused by glucocorticoid administration. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that prolonged use of dexamethasone resulted in myocardial cell injury via increased production of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory biomarkers, and inhibition of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. The leaves extract of Gongronema latifolium elicits the anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective potential as an efficient inhibitor of free radicals with good antioxidant properties.

The Western Blot, qRT-PCR and TUNEL staining were used to explore the function of hub gene in hypoxia-induced cardiomyocytes in vitro.\nA total of 235 DEGs were identified in GSE71906 dataset. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were primarily associated with the inflammatory response and apoptosis. 20 hub genes were identified in PPI network, and the early growth response 2 (EGR2) was highlighted. In vitro. We confirmed the EGR2 was upregulated induced by hypoxia and revealed the upregulated EGR2 aggravates pro-inflammation and pro-apoptotic genes expression. In addition, EGR2 knockout mitigates hypoxia-induced inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.\nThe present study identified the EGR2 was a hub gene in myocardial damage during MI process, the excessive EGR2 aggravates hypoxia-induced myocardial damage by accelerating inflammation and apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, targeting EGR2 offers a potential pharmacological strategy for myocardial cell rescue in MI.", "journal": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "date": "2022-08-16", "authors": ["ZhixiangBo", "ShuwenHuang", "LiLi", "LinChen", "PingChen", "XiaoyiLuo", "FangShi", "BingZhu", "LinShen"], "doi": "10.1186/s12872-022-02814-3\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.01.001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307961\n10.1517/14728222.2016.1088005\n10.1038/cddis.2017.268\n10.2174/1871525713666150123152131\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174403\n10.5114/ceji.2017.69363\n10.26508/lsa.202000766\n10.1016/j.prp.2020.153259\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206222\n10.1186/s12885-020-07474-0\n10.1093/cvr/cvv121\n10.18632/aging.202785\n10.1038/nm.2507\n10.1152/ajpregu.00200.2016\n10.1038/ni.3153\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.001032\n10.1186/s12967-021-02932-0\n10.1111/eos.12650\n10.1038/39899\n10.1038/363079a0\n10.18632/aging.103072\n10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.02022.x\n10.1002/path.2991\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174470\n10.1007/s00395-019-0768-4\n10.18632/aging.101616\n10.3389/fgene.2021.690196\n10.1371/journal.pone.0177843\n10.1007/s00383-020-04686-0\n10.23736/S1824-4785.20.03232-X\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01721-1\n10.1093/cvr/cvx049\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.111.967596\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.880187\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.02.043\n10.1038/nm.3806"}

{"title": "ECM roles and biomechanics in cardiac tissue decellularization.", "abstract": "Natural biomaterials hold enormous potential for tissue regeneration. The rapid advance of several tissue-engineered biomaterials, such as natural and synthetic polymer-based scaffolds, has led to widespread application of these materials in the clinic and in research. However, biomaterials can have limited repair capacity; obstacles result from immunogenicity, difficulties in mimicking native microenvironments, and maintaining the mechanical and biochemical (i.e., biomechanical) properties of native organs/tissues. The emergence of decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived biomaterials provides an attractive solution to overcome these hurdles since decellularized ECM provides a nonimmune environment with native three-dimensional structures and bioactive components. More importantly, decellularized ECM can be generated from the tissue of interest, such as the heart, and keep its native macro- and microstructure and tissue-specific composition. These decellularized cardiac matrices/scaffolds can then be reseeded using cardiac cells, and the resulting recellularized construct is considered an ideal choice for regenerating functional organs/tissues. Nonetheless, the decellularization process must be optimized and depends on tissue type, age, and functional goal. Although most decellularization protocols significantly reduce immunogenicity and deliver a matrix that maintains the tissue macrostructure, suboptimal decellularization can change ECM composition and microstructure, which affects the biomechanical properties of the tissue and consequently changes cell-matrix interactions and organ function. Herein, we review methods of decellularization, with particular emphasis on cardiac tissue, and how they can affect the biomechanics of the tissue, which in turn determines success of reseeding and in vivo viability. Moreover, we review recent developments in decellularized ECM-derived cardiac biomaterials and discuss future perspectives.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Ischemia-Selective Cardioprotection by Malonate for Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.", "abstract": "Inhibiting SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), with the competitive inhibitor malonate, has shown promise in ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, key for translation to the clinic is understanding the mechanism of malonate entry into cells to enable inhibition of SDH, its mitochondrial target, as malonate itself poorly permeates cellular membranes. The possibility of malonate selectively entering the at-risk heart tissue on reperfusion, however, remains unexplored.\nC57BL/6J mice, C2C12 and H9c2 myoblasts, and HeLa cells were used to elucidate the mechanism of selective malonate uptake into the ischemic heart upon reperfusion. Cells were treated with malonate while varying pH or together with transport inhibitors. Mouse hearts were either perfused ex vivo (Langendorff) or subjected to in vivo left anterior descending coronary artery ligation as models of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Succinate and malonate levels were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS, in vivo by mass spectrometry imaging, and infarct size by TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride) staining.\nMalonate was robustly protective against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury, but only if administered at reperfusion and not when infused before ischemia. The extent of malonate uptake into the heart was proportional to the duration of ischemia. Malonate entry into cardiomyocytes in vivo and in vitro was dramatically increased at the low pH (\u22486.5) associated with ischemia. This increased uptake of malonate was blocked by selective inhibition of MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1). Reperfusion of the ischemic heart region with malonate led to selective SDH inhibition in the at-risk region. Acid-formulation greatly enhances the cardioprotective potency of malonate.\nCardioprotection by malonate is dependent on its entry into cardiomyocytes. This is facilitated by the local decrease in pH that occurs during ischemia, leading to its selective uptake upon reperfusion into the at-risk tissue, via MCT1. Thus, malonate's preferential uptake in reperfused tissue means it is an at-risk tissue-selective drug that protects against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["Hiran APrag", "DunjaAksentijevic", "AndreasDannhorn", "Abigail VGiles", "John FMulvey", "OlgaSauchanka", "LupingDu", "GeorginaBates", "JohannesReinhold", "DuvarakaKula-Alwar", "ZhelongXu", "LucPellerin", "Richard J AGoodwin", "Michael PMurphy", "ThomasKrieg"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.320717"}
{"title": "Graph-based homogenisation for modelling cardiac fibrosis.", "abstract": "Fibrosis, the excess of extracellular matrix, can affect, and even block, propagation of action potential in cardiac tissue. This can result in deleterious effects on heart function, but the nature and severity of these effects depend strongly on the localisation of fibrosis and its by-products in cardiac tissue, such as collagen scar formation. Computer simulation is an important means of understanding the complex effects of fibrosis on activation patterns in the heart, but concerns of computational cost place restrictions on the spatial resolution of these simulations. In this work, we present a novel numerical homogenisation technique that uses both Eikonal and graph approaches to allow fine-scale heterogeneities in conductivity to be incorporated into a coarser mesh. Homogenisation achieves this by deriving effective conductivity tensors so that a coarser mesh can then be used for numerical simulation. By taking a graph-based approach, our homogenisation technique functions naturally on irregular grids and does not rely upon any assumptions of periodicity, even implicitly. We present results of action potential propagation through fibrotic tissue in two dimensions that show the graph-based homogenisation technique is an accurate and effective way to capture fine-scale domain information on coarser meshes in the context of sharp-fronted travelling waves of activation. As test problems, we consider excitation propagation in tissue with diffuse fibrosis and through a tunnel-like structure designed to test homogenisation, interaction of an excitation wave with a scar region, and functional re-entry.", "journal": "Journal of computational physics", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["Megan EFarquhar", "KevinBurrage", "RodrigoWeber Dos Santos", "AlfonsoBueno-Orovio", "Brodie A JLawson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111126\n10.1007/s10741-016-9528-9\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa159\n10.1098/rsta.2011.0127\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.09.019\n10.1152/ajpheart.00785.2011\n10.1088/0031-9155/51/23/014\n10.1002/cnm.2467\n10.1007/3-540-33437-8\n10.1109/tbme.2006.879425\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006276\n10.1093/europace/eum206\n10.1109/tbme.2013.2256359\n10.1093/cvr/cvw073\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.04.015\n10.1007/bf00163916\n10.1007/bf00163143\n10.1016/0025-5564(93)90001-q\n10.1103/physreve.55.7656\n10.1002/advs.201500122\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.07.046\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120811\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.07.012\n10.1097/fjc.0b013e318207a35f\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv233\n10.3389/fbioe.2017.00029\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.018\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01114\n10.1029/92wr00541\n10.1109/iembs.2010.5627817\n10.3934/nhm.2019009\n10.1007/s11538-009-9421-y\n10.1007/978-0-387-75847-3\n10.1137/090777165\n10.1007/978-3-319-59448-4_25\n10.1109/tbme.2006.873750\n10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109810\n10.1007/s10439-010-0119-y\n10.1088/0266-5611/31/11/115001\n10.1016/j.media.2015.05.007\n10.1016/j.jcp.2014.11.043\n10.1093/europace/euw346\n10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109700\n10.1155/2015/713058\n10.1109/tbme.2012.2193398\n10.1109/tbme.2010.2051156\n10.1016/j.jcp.2017.06.020\n10.1007/978-3-642-21028-0_9\n10.1007/11566489_75\n10.1007/978-3-540-72907-5_17\n10.1126/science.220.4598.671\n10.1137/1.9780898719635\n10.1007/978-94-017-3389-2\n10.3934/dcdsb.2002.2.185\n10.1016/j.apm.2020.09.022\n10.1038/s41598-018-34304-y\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.275.1.h301\n10.1126/sciadv.1701676\n10.1073/pnas.090060097\n10.1002/cnm.3505\n10.1016/j.addr.2019.05.011"}

The exosome and Exo-Dox were examined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The antitumor activity, targeting capability, and mechanism of the developed Exo-Dox were evaluated by cell viability assay, histological and immunofluorescence analysis and in vivo imaging system.\nNTA results showed the size of the exosomes had increased from 141.6 nm to 178.1 nm after loading with doxorubicin. Compared with free Dox, the Exo-Dox exhibited higher cytotoxicity against osteosarcoma MG63 cells, HOS cells, and 143B cells than free Dox, the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of Dox, Exo-Dox were calculated to be 0.178 and 0.078 \u03bcg mL\nOur results suggested that MSC-derived Exo could be excellent nanocarriers used to deliver chemotherapeutic drug Dox specifically and efficiently in osteosarcoma, resulting in enhanced toxicity against osteosarcoma and less toxicity in heart tissue. We further demonstrated the targeting capability of Exo was due to the chemotaxis of MSC-derived exosomes to osteosarcoma cells via SDF1-CXCR4 axis.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["HongxiangWei", "FeiChen", "JinyuanChen", "HuangfengLin", "ShenglinWang", "YunqingWang", "ChaoyangWu", "JianhuaLin", "GuangxianZhong"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S372851\n10.1097/MOP.0000000000000298\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00662\n10.3390/cells9040976\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-17-1152\n10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2020.151654\n10.1002/pbc.28352\n10.3892/ol.2018.9434\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2016.41\n10.2165/10489100-000000000-00000\n10.2217/fon-2021-0427\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.09.017\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.11.007\n10.1016/j.cbi.2017.09.006\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.06.027\n10.1002/adhm.201801137\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.02.031\n10.1039/c7bm00008a\n10.1080/1061186X.2017.1401078\n10.3390/pharmaceutics9020012\n10.2147/IJN.S150017\n10.2174/1568026616666161222110600\n10.1039/C5BM00532A\n10.3390/molecules22091401\n10.1002/pmic.200800109\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4455\n10.1038/nbt.1807\n10.2147/IJN.S218988\n10.1002/stem.187\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2006.02402.x\n10.1002/ijc.25697\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166500\n10.3390/ijms23116222"}
{"title": "Effects of fibroblast on electromechanical dynamics of human atrial tissue-insights from a 2D discrete element model.", "abstract": "Roughly 75% of normal myocardial tissue volume is comprised of myocytes, however, fibroblasts by number are the most predominant cells in cardiac tissue. Previous studies have shown distinctive differences in cellular electrophysiology and excitability between myocytes and fibroblasts. However, it is still unclear how the electrical coupling between the two and the increased population of fibroblasts affects the electromechanical dynamics of cardiac tissue. This paper focuses on investigating effects of fibroblast-myocyte electrical coupling (FMEC) and fibroblast population on atrial electrical conduction and mechanical contractility by using a two-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM) model of cardiac tissue that is different to finite element method (FEM). In the model, the electro-mechanics of atrial cells are modelled by a biophysically detailed model for atrial electrical action potentials and myofilament kinetics, and the atrial fibroblasts are modelled by an active model that considers four active membrane ionic channel currents. Our simulation results show that the FMEC impairs myocytes' electrical action potential and mechanical contractibility, manifested by reduced upstroke velocity, amplitude and duration of action potentials, as well as cell length shortening. At the tissue level, the FMEC slows down the conduction of excitation waves, and reduces strain of the tissue produced during a contraction course. These findings provide new insights into understandings of how FMEC impairs cardiac electrical and mechanical dynamics of the heart.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["PaulBrocklehurst", "HengguiZhang", "JianqiaoYe"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2022.938497\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.10.014\n10.1152/ajpheart.00023.2006\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.08.003\n10.1155/2015/854953\n10.1371/journal.pone.0176607\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.08.020\n10.1161/01.RES.0000122382.19400.14\n10.1113/jphysiol.2007.135038\n10.1113/jphysiol.2013.254987\n10.1016/j.humpath.2005.07.018\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.275.1.H301\n10.1016/0148-9062(88)92293-0\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.12.040\n10.1161/01.RES.0000089258.40661.0C\n10.1002/dvdy.20095\n10.1016/0148-9062(88)92294-2\n10.1152/ajpheart.01298.2007\n10.1103/PhysRevE.74.011908\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2005.06.096\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.12.024\n10.1113/expphysiol.1994.sp003819\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001067\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.004665\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.1.87\n10.1529/biophysj.106.101410\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.054\n10.1152/ajpheart.00411.2009\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2009.01.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.160549\n10.1038/s41598-019-45078-2\n10.1093/cvr/cvy003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072950\n10.1093/cvr/cvr292\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.01.010\n10.1529/biophysj.107.119487\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.957647\n10.1007/BF00585633\n10.1152/ajpcell.1992.263.5.C959\n10.1007/s10439-007-9405-8\n10.1007/s10439-009-9667-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.153858\n10.14814/phy2.12711\n10.1109/CIC.2004.1442944\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a059928\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2007.00858.x\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.08.003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00341.2009\n10.1155/2013/238676\n10.1631/jzus.B1300156\n10.1088/1367-2630/18/12/123014\n10.1529/biophysj.108.136473"}

{"title": "Paracrine IGF-1 Activates SOD2 Expression and Regulates ROS/p53 Axis in the Treatment of Cardiac Damage in D-Galactose-Induced Aging Rats after Receiving Mesenchymal Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Aging is one of the causative agents associated with heart failure. Cell-based therapies show potential in the treatment of cardiac aging due to the characteristics of stem cells, including differentiation and the paracrine effect. This study aimed to investigate in detail the mechanism related to biomolecules released from mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of cardiac aging. In vitro and in vivo models were designed to explore the above hypothesis. Experimental results from the in vitro model indicated that the elevation of oxidative stress, the expression of aging marker p53, and the suppression of antioxidant marker SOD2 could be found in D-galactose-stressed H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. The co-culture of D-galactose-stressed H9c2 with mesenchymal stem cells significantly improved the above pathological signaling. An animal model revealed that the change in cardiac structure, the accumulation of fibrotic collagen, and the activation of the above pathological signaling could be observed in heart tissues of D-galactose-stressed rats. After the rats had received mesenchymal stem cells, all the pathological conditions were significantly improved in D-galactose-stressed hearts. Further evidence indicated that the release of the survival marker IGF-1 was detected in a stem-cell-conditioned medium. Significant increases in cell viability and the expression of SOD2, as well as a reduction in oxidative stress and the suppression of p53, were found in D-galactose-stressed H9c2 cells cultured with a stem-cell-conditioned medium, whereas the depletion of IGF-1 in stem-cell-conditioned medium diminished the antiaging effect on H9c2 cells. In conclusion, the paracrine release of IGF-1 from mesenchymal stem cells increases the expression of antioxidant marker SOD2, and the expression of SOD2 reduces oxidative stress as well as suppresses p53, leading to a reduction in cardiac senescence in D-galactose-stressed rats.", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["Wei-SyunHu", "Wei-YuLiao", "Chin-HsienChang", "Tung-ShengChen"], "doi": "10.3390/jcm11154419\n10.1016/j.cger.2009.07.007\n10.1007/s11357-017-9959-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.638569\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.09.064\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246876\n10.4330/wjc.v4.i4.90\n10.1042/CS20160823\n10.1007/s11357-014-9728-y\n10.1155/2017/5707830\n10.3390/ijms17040466\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000034046.87607.1C\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311080\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3008921\n10.1007/s12265-012-9376-5\n10.1159/000113407\n10.1021/pr900898n\n10.1038/sj.mt.6300374\n10.1089/ars.2011.4179\n10.1038/nature06800\n10.2217/rme.09.74\n10.1155/2019/7838754\n10.1038/s41419-019-1670-6"}
{"title": "Regulation of APD and Force by the Na", "abstract": "The physiological importance of NCX in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is not well characterized but may depend on the relative strength of the current, compared to adult cardiomyocytes, and on the exact spatial arrangement of proteins involved in Ca2+ extrusion. Here, we determined NCX currents and its contribution to action potential and force in hiPSC-CMs cultured in engineered heart tissue (EHT). The results were compared with data from rat and human left ventricular tissue. The NCX currents in hiPSC-CMs were larger than in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from human left ventricles (1.3 \u00b1 0.2 pA/pF and 3.2 \u00b1 0.2 pA/pF for human ventricle and EHT, respectively, p < 0.05).

{"title": "Prediction of Tissue Exposures of Meropenem, Colistin, and Sulbactam in Pediatrics Using Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling.", "abstract": "The combination of polymyxins, meropenem, and sulbactam demonstrated efficacy against multi-drug-resistant bacillus Acinetobacter baumannii. These three antibiotics are commonly used against major blood, skin, lung, and heart muscle infections.\nThe objective of this study was to predict drug disposition and extrapolate the efficacy in these tissues using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling approach that linked drug exposures to their target pharmacodynamic indices associated with antimicrobial activities against A. baumannii.\nAn adult physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed for meropenem, colistin, and sulbactam and scaled to pediatrics accounting for both renal and non-renal clearances. The model reliability was evaluated by comparing simulated plasma and tissue drug exposures to observed data. Target pharmacodynamic indices were used to evaluate whether pediatric and adult dosing regimens provided sufficient coverage.\nThe modeled plasma drug exposures in adults and pediatric patients were consistent with reported literature data.

(SP), analyzed the SP ingredients absorbed into the rats blood, and evaluated its anti-myocardial ischemic effect to provide a scientific basis for the follow-up development and research of SP and lay a foundation for its clinical application using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-Q Exactive-mass spectrometry and GC-MS. Myocardial infarction was induced in rat by ligating the left anterior descending branch of the rat coronary artery, and SP alcohol extract was administered to evaluate its anti-myocardial ischemic effect. We analyzed the SP ingredients absorbed into the rats blood, screened the active compounds, established a database of SP anti-myocardial ischemic targets, and explored the possible mechanism of SP in treating myocardial infarction using bioinformatics. The rats were examined using echocardiography, serum biomarkers were determined, and pathological changes were observed by histopathological examination. TUNEL staining was performed to detect the apoptotic level of cells, and Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to detect the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase-3 in heart tissues. In the fingerprint of SP, 24 common peaks were established, and the similarity evaluation results of 10 batches of SP were all >0.9. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-Q Exactive-mass spectrometry and GC-MS detected 17 active ingredients in the drug-containing serum, including terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, phenylpropanoids, and phenolic acids, the most abundant of which was resveratrol. Enrichment analysis of SP targets against myocardial ischemia revealed that key candidate targets of SP were significantly enriched in multiple pathways associated with apoptosis. Resveratrol was administered to the successfully modeled rats, and the results showed that the resveratrol group significantly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter and significantly increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening in all groups compared with the model group. Resveratrol significantly decreased the levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase in serum compared to the model group (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Hematoxylin-eosin staining of rat myocardial tissue showed that all lesions were reduced under microscopic observation in the resveratrol group compared with the model group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot results showed that the resveratrol group downregulated the expression of the proapoptotic factor Bax, upregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, and decreased the expression of Caspase-3. The established fingerprints are accurate, reliable, and reproducible and can be used as an effective method for quality control of the herbs. The anti-myocardial ischemia effect of SP is that resveratrol improves cardiac function and inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis to protect cardiomyocytes. The present study provides ample evidence for the clinical use of SP, suggesting that this drug has great potential in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.", "journal": "Biomedical chromatography : BMC", "date": "2022-08-11", "authors": ["YeZhang", "JingkunLu", "YuhengMa", "LijunSun", "SuweiWang", "XinYue", "JiuwangYu", "PeifengXue"], "doi": "10.1002/bmc.5475"}

The experimental design includes the administration of the tested drugs (Crocin, Dapagliflozin) solely and with Lactobacillus, or in combination therapy with and without Lactobacillus to the diabetic rats for six weeks. Clinical and microscopic evaluation scoring for cardiac tissues were determined. Biochemical markers including blood glucose level, adiponectin, resistin, cardiac injury markers, lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes, pro and anti-inflammatory markers were assessed. In addition, quantitative relative expression of PPAR\u03b3 and TXINP genes and capsase-3 levels were measured. The change in the microbiota abundance was investigated using real-time PCR.\nThis study demonstrated the synergistic effect of the triple combination; dapagliflozin, crocin prebiotic, and Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii probiotic in treating diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats.

{"title": "Detection of Anticancer Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity Using VCAM1-Targeted Nanoprobes.", "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity is an undesirable yet very common effect that increases the risk of death and reduce the quality of life of individuals undergoing chemotherapy. However, no feasible methods and techniques are available to monitor and detect the degree of cardiotoxicity at an early stage. Therefore, in this project, we aim to develop a fluorescent nanoprobe to image the toxicity within the cardiac tissue induced by an anticancer drug. We have observed that vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) protein alone with collagen was overly expressed within the heart, when an animal was treated with doxorubicin (DOX), because of inflammation in the epithelial cells. We hypothesize that developing a VCAM1-targeted peptide-based (VHPKQHRGGSKGC) fluorescent nanoprobe can detect and visualize the affected heart. In this regard, we prepared a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle linked with VCAM1 peptide and rhodamine B (PLGA-VCAM1-RhB). Selective binding and higher accumulation of the PLGA-VCAM1-RhB nanoprobes were detected in DOX-treated human cardiomyocyte cells (HCMs) compared to the untreated cells. For in vivo studies, DOX (5 mg/kg) was injected via the tail vein once in two weeks for 6 weeks (3 injection total). PLGA-VCAM1-RhB and PLGA-RhB were injected via the tail vein after 1 week of the last dose of DOX, and images were taken 4 h after administration. A higher fluorescent signal of PLGA-RhB-VCAM-1 (48.62% \u00b1 12.79%) was observed in DOX-treated animals compared to the untreated control PLGA-RhB (10.61% \u00b1 4.90) within the heart, indicating the specificity and targeting ability of PLGA-VCAM1-RhB to the inflamed tissues. The quantified fluorescence intensity of the homogenized cardiac tissue of PLGA-RhB-VCAM1 showed 156% higher intensity than the healthy control group. We conclude that PLGA-VCAM1-RhB has the potential to bind inflamed cardiac cells, thereby detecting DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and damaged heart at an early stage.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-08-09", "authors": ["HumayraAfrin", "Md NurulHuda", "TamannaIslam", "Beu POropeza", "EfrenAlvidrez", "Muhammad IAbir", "ThomasBoland", "DavidTurbay", "MdNurunnabi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c13019"}

{"title": "Harm of circadian misalignment to the hearts of the adolescent wistar rats.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to observe the harm of circadian misalignment (CM), caused by an inverted photoperiod (IP), on the hearts of the adolescent Wistar rats, and to explore the mechanisms leading to harm.\nAn IP was used to create a CM model. A total of 174 Wistar rats were randomly divided into circadian alignment (CA) and CM groups (87 rats per group). The different activity rhythms of the two groups of rats were adjusted through different light/dark cycles for 90\u00a0days. We recorded the rhythmic activity trajectory and sleep time of the rats. After 90\u00a0days of modeling, we performed various analyses (i.e., blood pressure, weight, cardiac ultrasound tests, serological tests, cardiac tissue immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy on myocardial mitochondria, western blotting, and quantitative polymerase chain reactions).\n(1) The IP protocol caused CM in rats. (2) CM rats showed significantly higher blood pressure during the day (resting phase). They also showed significantly higher serum levels of angiotensin II and epinephrine during the day compared to the CA rats. (3) CM caused up-regulation of gene expression of adrenergic receptors \u03b11 (\u03b11-AR) and \u03b21 (\u03b21-AR) and down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) gene expression in rat hearts. It also caused downregulation of Bmal1 expression. In addition, the changes in Bmal1 and Per2 correlated with the changes in \u03b21-AR and \u03b11-AR. (4) CM had adverse effects on multiple molecular proteins of the heart. (5) CM increased the collagen fibers in the rat heart and increased the destruction of mitochondria. (6) Eventually, CM caused a decrease in the pumping function of the heart and decreased the coronary blood flow rate.\n(1) CM significantly affected the cardiac structure and function in the adolescent rats through a variety of mechanisms.

{"title": "Electrospun piezoelectric scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The use of smart materials in tissue engineering is becoming increasingly appealing to provide additional functionalities and control over cell fate. The stages of tissue development and regeneration often require various electrical and electromechanical cues supported by the extracellular matrix, which is often neglected in most tissue engineering approaches. Particularly, in cardiac cells, electrical signals modulate cell activity and are responsible for the maintenance of the excitation-contraction coupling. Addition of electroconductive and topographical cues improves the biomimicry of cardiac tissues and plays an important role in driving cells towards the desired phenotype. Current platforms used to apply electrical stimulation to cells in vitro often require large external equipment and wires and electrodes immersed in the culture media, limiting the scalability and applicability of this process. Piezoelectric materials represent a shift in paradigm in materials and methods aimed at providing electrical stimulation to cardiac cells since they can produce and deliver electrical signals to cells and tissues by mechanoelectrical transduction. Despite the ability of piezoelectric materials to mimic the mechanoelectrical transduction of the heart, the use of these materials is limited in cardiac tissue engineering and methods to characterise piezoelectricity are often built in-house, which poses an additional difficulty when comparing results from the literature. In this work, we aim at providing an overview of the main challenges in cardiac tissue engineering and how piezoelectric materials could offer a solution to them.

{"title": "Modulation of blood pressure regulatory genes in the Agtrap-Plod1 locus associated with a deletion in Clcn6.", "abstract": "The AGTRAP-PLOD1 locus is a conserved gene cluster containing several blood pressure regulatory genes, including CLCN6, MTHFR, NPPA, and NPPB. Previous work revealed that knockout of Clcn6 on the Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rat background (SS-Clcn6) resulted in lower diastolic blood pressure compared to SS-WT rats. Additionally, a recent study found sickle cell anemia patients with mutations in CLCN6 had improved survival and reduced stroke risk. We investigated whether loss of Clcn6 would delay the mortality of Dahl SS rats on an 8% NaCl (HS) diet. No significant difference in survival was found. The ability of Clcn6 to affect mRNA expression of nearby Mthfr, Nppa, and Nppb genes was also tested. On normal salt (0.4% NaCl, NS) diets, renal Mthfr mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in the SS-Clcn6 rats. MTHFR reduces homocysteine to methionine, but no differences in circulating homocysteine levels were detected. Nppa mRNA levels in cardiac tissue from SS-Clcn6 rat in both normotensive and hypertensive conditions were significantly reduced compared to SS-WT. Nppb mRNA expression in SS-Clcn6 rats on a NS diet was also substantially decreased. Heightened Mthfr expression would be predicted to be protective; however, diminished Nppa and Nppb expression could be deleterious and by preventing or blunting vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis that ought to normally occur to offset blood pressure increases. The conserved nature of this genetic locus in humans and rats suggests more studies are warranted to understand how mutations in and around these genes may be influencing the expression of their neighbors.", "journal": "Physiological reports", "date": "2022-08-06", "authors": ["Christine AKlemens", "Lashodya VDissanayake", "VladislavLevchenko", "AdrianZietara", "OlegPalygin", "AlexanderStaruschenko"], "doi": "10.14814/phy2.15417"}

Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and tissues fabricated from these cells are promising as screening tools for early identification of these potential cardiac liabilities. In this study, we describe an automated, open-source MATLAB-based analysis software for calculating cardiac action potentials and calcium transients from fluorescent reporters. We first identified the most robust manner in which to automatically identify the initiation point for action potentials and calcium transients in a user-independent manner, and used this approach to quantify the duration and morphology of these signals. We then demonstrate the software by assessing changes to action potentials and calcium transients in our micro-heart muscles after exposure to hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug with known cardiac liability. Consistent with clinical observations, our system predicted mild action potential prolongation. However, we also observed marked calcium transient suppression, highlighting the advantage of testing multiple physiologic readouts in cardiomyocytes rather than relying on heterologous overexpression of single channels such as the human ", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "SR9009 improves heart function after pressure overload independent of cardiac REV-ERB.", "abstract": "The core clock component REV-ERB is essential for heart function. Previous studies show that REV-ERB agonist SR9009 ameliorates heart remodeling in the pressure overload model with transverse aortic constriction (TAC). However, it is unknown whether SR9009 indeed works through cardiac REV-ERB, given that SR9009 might target other proteins and that REV-ERB in non-cardiac tissues might regulate cardiac functions indirectly. To address this question, we generated the REV-ERB\u03b1/\u03b2 cardiac-specific double knockout mice (cDKO). We found that REV-ERB cardiac deficiency leads to profound dilated cardiac myopathy after TAC compared to wild-type (WT) control mice, confirming the critical role of REV-ERB in protecting against pressure overload. Interestingly, the cardioprotective effect of SR9009 against TAC retains in cDKO mice. In addition, SR9009 administered at the time points corresponding to the peak or trough of REV-ERB expression showed similar cardioprotective effects, suggesting the REV-ERB-independent mechanisms in SR9009-mediated post-TAC cardioprotection. These findings highlight that genetic deletion of REV-ERB in cardiomyocytes accelerates adverse cardiac remodeling in response to pressure overload and demonstrated the REV-ERB-independent cardioprotective effect of SR9009 upon pressure overload.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-08-02", "authors": ["HuiLi", "ShiyangSong", "Chih-LiangTien", "LeiQi", "AndreaGraves", "EleniNasiotis", "Thomas PBurris", "YuanbiaoZhao", "ZhengSun", "LileiZhang"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2022.952114\n10.1016/s0002-9149(97)00181-1\n10.1152/ajpheart.00608.2015\n10.1177/0748730414543141\n10.1038/nsmb1344\n10.1016/j.molcel.2015.10.024\n10.1126/science.aab3021\n10.1172/jci.insight.95177\n10.1038/s42003-019-0595-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0189330\n10.1038/s44161-021-00001-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.056076\n10.1073/pnas.1904226116\n10.1016/s1097-2765(00)80084-2\n10.1172/JCI93910\n10.7554/eLife.63324"}
{"title": "Fasudil Protects Against Adriamycin-induced Acute Heart Injury by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress, Apoptosis, and Cellular Senescence.", "abstract": "The clinical utility of Adriamycin (ADR) is limited due to its toxicity, particularly cardiotoxicity. Therefore, effective cardioprotective adjuvants to minimize ADR-induced acute cardiotoxicity are urgently needed. Our previous studies have demonstrated the protective roles of fasudil on tissue injury. Here, we further explore whether inhibition of Rho-kinase could alleviate the acute heart injury induced by ADR.\nC57BL6 mice were randomly divided into the following four groups: \u2460 ADR group; \u2461 low-dose fasudil (ADR+L); \u2462 high-dose fasudil (ADR+H); and \u2463 control group (CON). Animals were injected i.p 20 mg/kg ADR once in group \u2460~\u2462. Animals were injected i.p fasudil (2 or 10 mg/kg/day) daily for consecutive 6 days in groups \u2461 and \u2462, respectively. Blood samples and heart tissues were collected for assays. H9C2 cells were treated with fasudil for 30 mins and then incubated with ADR for 24 hours. Cells were collected for immunohistochemistry and western blot study, respectively.\nIn the mouse model, administration of fasudil significantly ameliorated ADR-induced cardiac damage, suppressed cell apoptosis and senescence, and ameliorated redox imbalance and DNA damage. In vitro, fasudil treatment ameliorated ADR-induced immunofluorescence reaction of 8-OHdG, decreased the expression of TUNEL cells and proteins of Bax, Caspase-3 and p53, and increased the expression of proteins of Bcl-2 and SIRT 1.\nFasudil has a protective effect on ADR induced acute cardiotoxicity, which is partially attributed to its antioxidant, anti-senescence, and anti-apoptotic effects.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2022-08-02", "authors": ["YiYan", "ChengyuXiang", "DingguoZhang"], "doi": "10.2174/1381612828666220729103430"}
{"title": "Full-length transcriptomic analysis in murine and human heart reveals diversity of PGC-1\u03b1 promoters and isoforms regulated distinctly in myocardial ischemia and obesity.", "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) acts as a transcriptional coactivator and regulates mitochondrial function. Various isoforms are generated by alternative splicing and differentially regulated promoters. In the heart, total PGC-1\u03b1 deficiency knockout leads to dilatative cardiomyopathy, but knowledge on the complexity of cardiac isoform expression of PGC-1\u03b1 remains sparse. Thus, this study aims to generate a reliable dataset on cardiac isoform expression pattern by long-read mRNA sequencing, followed by investigation of differential regulation of PGC-1\u03b1 isoforms under metabolic and ischemic stress, using high-fat-high-sucrose-diet-induced obesity and a murine model of myocardial infarction.\nMurine (C57Bl/6J) or human heart tissue (obtained during LVAD-surgery) was used for long-read mRNA sequencing, resulting in full-length transcriptomes including 58,000 mRNA isoforms with 99% sequence accuracy. Automatic bioinformatic analysis as well as manual similarity search against exonic sequences leads to identification of putative coding PGC-1\u03b1 isoforms, validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Thereby, 12 novel transcripts generated by hitherto unknown splicing events were detected. In addition, we postulate a novel promoter with homologous and strongly conserved sequence in human heart. High-fat diet as well as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury transiently reduced cardiac expression of PGC-1\u03b1 isoforms, with the most pronounced effect in the infarcted area. Recovery of PGC-1\u03b1-isoform expression was even more decelerated when I/R was performed in diet-induced obese mice.\nWe deciphered for the first time a complete full-length transcriptome of the murine and human heart, identifying novel putative PGC-1\u03b1 coding transcripts including a novel promoter. These transcripts are differentially regulated in I/R and obesity suggesting transcriptional regulation and alternative splicing that may modulate PGC-1\u03b1 function in the injured and metabolically challenged heart.", "journal": "BMC biology", "date": "2022-07-31", "authors": ["DanielOehler", "Andr\u00e9Spychala", "AxelG\u00f6decke", "AlexanderLang", "NorbertGerdes", "JorgeRuas", "MalteKelm", "JuliaSzendroedi", "RalfWestenfeld"], "doi": "10.1186/s12915-022-01360-w\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.10.050\n10.1074/jbc.M115.705822\n10.1007/s00125-015-3671-z\n10.1074/jbc.EC118.002682\n10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.004\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.08.043\n10.1016/j.molmet.2017.11.001\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2012.01.007\n10.1186/s13395-020-00231-8\n10.1093/ajh/hpx162\n10.1016/j.tem.2015.03.010\n10.1097/MOL.0b013e3282efe49d\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.166\n10.1152/ajpendo.00578.2013\n10.1038/nature06613\n10.1074/jbc.M114.554394\n10.1007/s00421-020-04467-6\n10.1016/j.tem.2011.09.007\n10.21775/cimb.028.029\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223818\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.045104\n10.1046/j.1440-1681.2002.03655.x\n10.1016/j.tcm.2012.07.003\n10.1093/cvr/cvy155\n10.1113/JP272847\n10.3904/kjim.2016.208\n10.1186/s12933-018-0754-4\n10.1007/s00394-017-1472-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.10.010\n10.1038/s41467-021-24484-z\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.1007/978-1-4939-3578-9_15\n10.1074/jbc.M111.227496\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.02.022\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00013.2006\n10.1161/JAHA.119.015502\n10.2337/db18-0449\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.10.020\n10.1101/gr.222976.117\n10.1093/nar/gkw1129\n10.1093/nar/gkx922\n10.1093/nar/gky1100\n10.1101/gad.1295005\n10.1074/jbc.M109.052506\n10.1074/jbc.M801920200\n10.1016/j.addr.2010.08.007\n10.1042/BJ20061526\n10.1080/21541264.2015.1067286\n10.1142/S0219720010004963\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.10.009"}
{"title": "The generation of a lactate-rich environment stimulates cell cycle progression and modulates gene expression on neonatal and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "In situ tissue engineering strategies are a promising approach to activate the endogenous regenerative potential of the cardiac tissue helping the heart to heal itself after an injury. However, the current use of complex reprogramming vectors for the activation of reparative pathways challenges the easy translation of these therapies into the clinic. Here, we evaluated the response of mouse neonatal and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to the presence of exogenous lactate, thus mimicking the metabolic environment of the fetal heart. An increase in cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity was observed in the presence of lactate, as determined through Ki67 and Aurora-B kinase. Gene expression and RNA-sequencing data revealed that cardiomyocytes incubated with lactate showed upregulation of BMP10, LIN28 or TCIM in tandem with downregulation of GRIK1 or DGKK among others. Lactate also demonstrated a capability to modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines on cardiac fibroblasts, reducing the production of Fas, Fraktalkine or IL-12p40, while stimulating IL-13 and SDF1a. In addition, the generation of a lactate-rich environment improved ex vivo neonatal heart culture, by affecting the contractile activity and sarcomeric structures and inhibiting epicardial cell spreading. Our results also suggested a common link between the effect of lactate and the activation of hypoxia signaling pathways. These findings support a novel use of lactate in cardiac tissue engineering, modulating the metabolic environment of the heart and thus paving the way to the development of lactate-releasing platforms for in situ cardiac regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials advances", "date": "2022-07-31", "authors": ["Jes\u00fasOrdo\u00f1o", "SoledadP\u00e9rez-Amodio", "KristenBall", "AitorAguirre", "ElisabethEngel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioadv.2022.213035"}
{"title": "Differential contributions of cardiac, coronary and pulmonary artery vagal mechanoreceptors to reflex control of the circulation.", "abstract": "Distinct populations of stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors attached to myelinated vagal afferents are found in the heart and adjoining coronary and pulmonary circulations. Receptors at atrio-venous junctions appear to be involved in control of intravascular volume. These atrial receptors influence sympathetic control of the heart and kidney, but contribute little to reflex control of systemic vascular resistance. Baroreceptors at the origins of the coronary circulation elicit reflex vasodilatation, like feedback control from systemic arterial baroreceptors, as well as having characteristics that could contribute to regulation of mean pressure. In contrast, feedback from baroreceptors in the pulmonary artery and bifurcation is excitatory and elicits a pressor response. Elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure resets the vasomotor limb of the systemic arterial baroreflex, which could be relevant for control of sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow during exercise and other states associated with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Ventricular receptors, situated mainly in the inferior posterior wall of the left ventricle, and attached to unmyelinated vagal afferents, are relatively inactive under basal conditions. However, a change to the biochemical environment of cardiac tissue surrounding these receptors elicits a depressor response. Some ventricular receptors respond, modestly, to mechanical distortion. Probably, ventricular receptors contribute little to tonic feedback control; however, reflex bradycardia and hypotension in response to chemical activation may decrease the work of the heart during myocardial ischaemia. Overall, greater awareness of heterogeneous reflex effects originating from cardiac, coronary and pulmonary artery mechanoreceptors is required for a better understanding of integrated neural control of circulatory function and arterial blood pressure.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2022-07-30", "authors": ["Jonathan PMoore", "Lydia LSimpson", "Mark JDrinkhill"], "doi": "10.1113/JP282305"}
{"title": "Protective Effects and Mechanisms of Melatonin on Stress Myocardial Injury in Rats.", "abstract": "Prolonged and intense stress can exceed the body's normal self-regulation and limited compensatory and repair capacity, resulting in pathological damage to the body. In this study, we established a rat stress myocardial injury (SMI) model to explore the protective effect of melatonin (MLT) on SMI and its possible mechanisms of action. Adult female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: blank control group (NC), SMI group, MLT low-dose group, MLT medium-dose group, and MLT high-dose group, and 10 rats in each group were used to establish a SMI model by the water immersion restraint method. We observed the changes in body weight and tail vein glucose of each group. Serum levels of corticosterone (Cort), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), and Troponin \u2160 (Tn-\u2160) and activity of lactic acid dehydrogenase were measured by ELISA. Transcriptome sequencing was used to find differentially expressed genes in the control and model groups, and the results were verified by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). HE staining was used to visualize the pathological changes in the heart tissue of each group, and Western blot was used to study the differences in protein expression in the cardiomyocytes of each group to further corroborate the results. The body weight growth rate of rats in the SMI group was significantly lower than that of the NC group ( P < 0.01), and the body weight growth rate of rats in the MLT high-dose group was significantly higher than that of the SMI group ( P < 0.05) with no significant difference compared with the NC group rats. The mean blood glucose of rats in the SMI group was significantly higher compared with the NC group ( P < 0.001), while the mean blood glucose of rats in the MLT administration groups was dose-dependently reduced compared with the SMI group. By RNA-seq and bioinformatics tools such as KEGG and Gene ontology, we found that the circadian clock-related genes Ciart , Arnt1 , Per1 , and Dbp were significantly downregulated in the SMI group during water immersion stress, and differentially expressed genes were enriched in the p38MAPK signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway. Moreover, genes related to inflammation and apoptosis were differentially expressed. ELISA results showed that Cort, CK-MB, and Tn-\u2160 levels were significantly higher in the SMI group compared with the NC group ( P < 0.01) and melatonin reduced the levels of Cort, CK-MB, and Tn-\u2160 and decreased lactic acid dehydrogenase activity in rat serum. HE staining results showed that melatonin could attenuate stress-generated myocardial injury. Western blot showed that melatonin reduced the expression of p38MAPK, p53, Bax, and caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 protein in rat heart. Melatonin can inhibit myocardial injury caused by water immersion, and its mechanism of action may be related to the regulation of the expression of circadian clock genes such as Ciart , Arnt1 , Per1 , and Dbp ; the inhibition of the expression of proapoptotic proteins such as p38MAPK, p53, Bax, and caspase-3; and the increase of the expression of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2022-07-29", "authors": ["Jia-YaoChen", "TingLi", "Jiao-LingWang", "Zhan-leWang", "YunZhang", "Lin-QuanZang"], "doi": "10.1097/FJC.0000000000001312"}

Pregnant rats were received ethanol 4.5\u00a0g/kg BW once per day from the 7th day of pregnancy (GD7) throughout lactation. Our findings demonstrated that, area of fibrosis increased in cardiac tissue in the pups on both postnatal day twenty one (PN21) and postnatal day ninety (PN90) after prenatal and early postnatal period ethanol treatment compared with the controls.

Injectable hydrogels with the ability to locally deliver drugs or cells to the damaged area can revolutionize the treatment of heart diseases. Herein, we formulate a thermo-responsive and injectable hydrogel based on conjugated chitosan/poloxamers for cardiac repair. To tailor the mechanical properties and electrical signal transmission, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with an average diameter of 50 nm were physically bonded to oxidized bacterial nanocellulose fibers (OBC) and added to the thermosensitive hydrogel at the ratio of 1% w/v. The prepared hydrogels have a porous structure with open pore channels in the range of 50\u2212200 \u00b5m. Shear rate sweep measurements demonstrate a reversible phase transition from sol to gel with increasing temperature and a gelation time of 5 min. The hydrogels show a shear-thinning behavior with a shear modulus ranging from 1 to 12 kPa dependent on gold concentration. Electrical conductivity studies reveal that the conductance of the polymer matrix is 6 \u00d7 10\u22122 S/m at 75 mM Au. In vitro cytocompatibility assays by H9C2 cells show high biocompatibility (cell viability of >90% after 72 h incubation) with good cell adhesion.

In this systematic review, we examined the literature and consolidated available evidence for the \"paracrine hypothesis\". Two Ovid SP databases were searched using a strategy encompassing paracrine mediated MSC therapy in the context of ischemic heart disease. This yielded 86 articles which met the selection criteria for inclusion in this study. We found that the MSCs utilized in these articles were primarily derived from bone marrow, cardiac tissue, and adipose tissue. We identified 234 individual protective factors across these studies, including VEGF, HGF, and FGF2; which are proposed to exert their effects in a paracrine manner. The data collated in this systematic review identifies secreted paracrine factors that could decrease apoptosis, and increase angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and cell viability. These included studies have also demonstrated that the administration of MSCs and indirectly, their secreted factors can reduce infarct size, and improve left ventricular ejection fraction, contractility, compliance, and vessel density.

{"title": "Nicorandil Suppresses Ischemia-Induced Norepinephrine Release and Ventricular Arrhythmias in Hypertrophic Hearts.", "abstract": "Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are a common cause of sudden death in acute myocardial infarction (MI), for which hypertension is a major risk factor. Nicorandil opens ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, which are expressed by nerve terminals and cardiomyocytes and regulate the release of norepinephrine (NE). However, the effects of nicorandil on ischemic NE release in cardiac tissue remain unclear. Therefore, we herein investigated whether nicorandil suppressed interstitial NE concentrations and VAs during acute MI in pressure overload-induced hypertrophic hearts.\nRats were divided into two groups: an abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) group and sham-operated (Sham) group. Four weeks after constriction, cardiac geometry and functions were examined using echocardiography and hemodynamic analyses. Myocardial ischemia was induced by coronary artery occlusion for 100\u00a0min with or without the administration of nicorandil. VAs were assessed by electrocardiography, and NE concentrations in the ischemic region were measured using a micro-dialysis method.\nAAC induced left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction. VAs markedly increased in the early phase (0-20\u00a0min) of ischemia in both groups and were more frequent in the AAC group. Cardiac interstitial NE concentrations were higher in the AAC group before ischemia and significantly increased during ischemia in both groups. Nicorandil significantly suppressed ischemia-induced VAs and NE increases in the AAC group.\nIschemia-induced VAs were more frequent in hypertrophic hearts and associated with high interstitial concentrations of NE. The attenuation of ischemia-induced increases in NE through neuronal KATP opening by nicorandil may suppress ischemia-induced VAs in hypertrophic hearts.", "journal": "Cardiovascular drugs and therapy", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["MiyukiKobara", "ToshihiroAmano", "HiroeToba", "TetsuoNakata"], "doi": "10.1007/s10557-022-07369-1\n10.1016/S0735-1097(98)00407-0\n10.1016/0002-9149(87)90305-5\n10.1016/S0002-8703(05)80050-X\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl218\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.09.016\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.06.036\n10.1016/S0022-2828(88)80029-4\n10.1093/emboj/19.24.6644\n10.1152/ajpheart.00903.2008\n10.1074/jbc.271.15.8796\n10.1253/circj.CJ-08-0212\n10.1177/0300060520967856\n10.3233/CH-200998\n10.1016/S1043-6618(02)00335-3\n10.1016/S0008-6363(96)88523-3\n10.1016/S0014-2999(02)01277-3\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705475\n10.1161/hc3501.093800\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00052-8\n10.1097/01.WCB.0000122742.72175.1B\n10.1111/1440-1681.13329\n10.1038/s41598-019-42209-7\n10.1007/s00247-017-3918-6\n10.1016/j.echo.2009.05.004\n10.2147/DDDT.S213910\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00073-4\n10.1093/cvr/cvp068\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000166850.80344.cf\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.03.057\n10.1124/jpet.103.059832\n10.1161/01.CIR.84.1.350\n10.1161/01.RES.60.2.194\n10.1161/01.RES.55.5.689\n10.1002/mus.25098\n10.1152/ajpcell.00052.2012\n10.1023/B:CARD.0000025751.82774.a9"}
{"title": "Artificial Scaffolds in Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide. Current treatments directed at heart repair have several disadvantages, such as a lack of donors for heart transplantation or non-bioactive inert materials for replacing damaged tissue. Because of the natural lack of regeneration of cardiomyocytes, new treatment strategies involve stimulating heart tissue regeneration. The basic three elements of cardiac tissue engineering (cells, growth factors, and scaffolds) are described in this review, with a highlight on the role of artificial scaffolds. Scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering are tridimensional porous structures that imitate the extracellular heart matrix, with the ability to promote cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and proliferation. In the heart, there is an important requirement to provide scaffold cellular attachment, but scaffolds also need to permit mechanical contractility and electrical conductivity. For researchers working in cardiac tissue engineering, there is an important need to choose an adequate artificial scaffold biofabrication technique, as well as the ideal biocompatible biodegradable biomaterial for scaffold construction. Finally, there are many suitable options for researchers to obtain scaffolds that promote cell-electrical interactions and tissue repair, reaching the goal of cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Life (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["Jorge ARoacho-P\u00e9rez", "Elsa NGarza-Trevi\u00f1o", "Nidia KMoncada-Saucedo", "Pablo ACarriquiry-Chequer", "Laura EValencia-G\u00f3mez", "Elizabeth ReneeMatthews", "V\u00edctorG\u00f3mez-Flores", "MarioSimental-Mend\u00eda", "PaulinaDelgado-Gonzalez", "Juan LuisDelgado-Gallegos", "Gerardo RPadilla-Rivas", "Jose FranciscoIslas"], "doi": "10.3390/life12081117\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1038/s42003-018-0202-8\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1111/j.1447-0594.2010.00603.x\n10.1152/physrev.00047.2009\n10.3390/ijms21218118\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.637538\n10.1242/dev.198937\n10.7554/eLife.05871\n10.2174/1389450119666180801122551\n10.2174/1573403X14666180222102312\n10.1093/eurheartj/I158\n10.1113/JP270538\n10.1007/978-3-319-77932-4_27\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.11.028\n10.1159/000492704\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.03.011\n10.1093/cvr/cvab200\n10.1242/dev.143966\n10.1242/dev.143438\n10.1016/j.stem.2021.05.008\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111425\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318183\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00955\n10.2147/SCCAA.S54204\n10.1155/2015/975302\n10.1016/j.gendis.2014.07.003\n10.3389/fcell.2021.704903\n10.1155/2018/9847015\n10.1038/srep28739\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00036\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.599928\n10.2217/rme.10.65\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.12.013\n10.1038/srep31457\n10.1083/jcb.201505082\n10.1038/nature11139\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.01.025\n10.1038/srep19386\n10.1161/JAHA.119.015686\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269035\n10.1038/s41467-021-25211-4\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.11.007\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.118631\n10.1007/s10741-020-09953-9\n10.1089/ten.teb.2012.0437\n10.3390/pharmaceutics13071038\n10.1039/D0TB01605E\n10.1002/btpr.2262\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2019.121882\n10.3390/gels7040253\n10.3390/bioengineering7040122\n10.1021/bm401679q\n10.1007/s12010-019-02967-6\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.08.030\n10.1088/1748-6041/11/2/022003\n10.1093/rb/rbz017\n10.1007/s40778-017-0075-7\n10.1007/978-3-319-97421-7_5\n10.1038/s41598-020-66327-9\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102729\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.001065\n10.2147/IJN.S38635\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.118682\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00593\n10.3934/bioeng.2021011\n10.3390/jfb3040799\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2020.123842\n10.1515/revce-2021-0003\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2020.100721\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103472\n10.1007/978-981-16-4420-7_18\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.119077\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.117768\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.05.040\n10.1002/pat.5273\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00875\n10.3390/ijms22168657\n10.3390/coatings10100925\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034004\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.05.012\n10.1161/01.cir.0000087450.34497.9a\n10.1002/adfm.201601146\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.072\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.11.042\n10.1053/j.semtcvs.2018.02.002\n10.1097/MAT.0000000000000486\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2399437\n10.1177/0003489419836667\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2019.04.044\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.12.040\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.554597\n10.1088/1748-605X/ab452d\n10.1534/genetics.118.300731\n10.1007/s13346-019-00627-0\n10.1517/17425247.2013.739156\n10.3727/096368907783338217\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.031\n10.1007/s42242-022-00194-3\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.112\n10.1002/jbm.a.36555\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.09.015\n10.1002/term.2994\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.09.024\n10.1097/01.ju.0000052663.84060.ea\n10.1007/s13239-019-00451-0\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034105\n10.1002/adhm.202000735\n10.1002/term.1739\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121008\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab331e\n10.1007/978-1-0716-0845-6_13\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.07.134\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0143\n10.1016/j.msec.2020.111403\n10.3892/etm.2019.8349\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.032\n10.1016/j.carrev.2018.11.026\n10.1002/ccd.29578\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.03.032\n10.4236/jbnb.2012.34044\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.001\n10.4236/ojrm.2016.51002\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.05.101\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.04.196\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.021\n10.4236/jbnb.2013.42025\n10.1038/s41598-018-33144-0\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.797340"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective Effect of Acetylsalicylic Acid in the Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Model on Oxidative Stress Markers Levels in Heart Muscle and Serum.", "abstract": "Heart failure occurs in increased oxidative stress conditions, which contribute to the progression of pathological changes. Orally or intravenously administered acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) is typically used in human patients with acute myocardial ischemia. The study used an experimental porcine ischemia-reperfusion model to evaluate the potential cardioprotective effect of intracoronary administered ASA on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. The cardioprotective effect of ASA was evaluated by measuring selected oxidative stress markers levels in infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium 14 days after the procedure, and three times in serum, before the procedure, during the reperfusion process, and after 14-day recovery. The results showed that intracoronary administrated ASA reduced the oxidative stress. The level of oxidative stress, measured with the non-enzymatic markers total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidative status (TOS), and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the enzymatic markers glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), in heart tissue was significantly higher in a control group injected with saline. The level of oxidative stress in serum, measured with TAC, TOS, oxidative stress index (OSI), and lipofuscin (LF), was also higher in the control group than in animals injected with ASA. The confirmed cardioprotective effect of intracoronary administered ASA provides the foundation for further studies on ASA intracoronary application, which may lead to the development of a new therapy for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion complications in humans.", "journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["PiotrFrydrychowski", "MarcinMicha\u0142ek", "IwonaBil-Lula", "El\u017cbietaChe\u0142mecka", "AlinaKafel", "AgnieszkaNoszczyk-Nowak", "DominikaStygar"], "doi": "10.3390/antiox11081432\n10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3182249fcd\n10.1089/ars.2007.2013\n10.3389/fcvm.2015.00029\n10.1016/0021-9150(94)05558-Z\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.05.001\n10.2174/092986707781058959\n10.1093/cvr/cvn335\n10.1093/cvr/cvz070\n10.1253/jcj.60.961\n10.1161/01.RES.62.4.668\n10.1016/j.carrev.2012.12.006\n10.1093/cvr/cvr113\n10.30802/AALAS-JAALAS-19-000137\n10.1152/ajpheart.00335.2017\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw145\n10.1097/01.rli.0000179524.58411.a2\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2003.11.015\n10.1016/0003-2697(79)90738-3\n10.1161/01.RES.85.2.147\n10.1016/S0022-2828(03)00084-1\n10.1152/ajpcell.2001.280.1.C53\n10.1161/hh1701.096615\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00275-2\n10.1161/01.RES.83.4.345\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.306842\n10.1177/0960327110371257\n10.1080/14017430600855077\n10.21037/apm-20-1681\n10.3390/antiox9020183\n10.1046/j.1365-2168.1998.00542.x\n10.1536/jhj.42.677\n10.1080/10715760410001688339\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.02.012\n10.1159/000365512\n10.5603/CJ.2012.0069\n10.1196/annals.1297.015\n10.1016/j.ab.2016.10.021\n10.1016/j.hjc.2018.04.003\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2019.02.012\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2003.11.004\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2004.05.005\n10.1136/hrt.2003.018226\n10.1093/ehjci/jes094\n10.2143/AC.59.6.2005242\n10.2174/092986707780831078"}

{"title": "Intracellular Toxic Advanced Glycation End-Products May Induce Cell Death and Suppress Cardiac Fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a lifestyle-related disease (LSRD) induced by the dysfunction and cell death of cardiomyocytes. Cardiac fibroblasts are activated and differentiate in response to specific signals, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 released from injured cardiomyocytes, and are crucial for the protection of cardiomyocytes, cardiac tissue repair, and remodeling. In contrast, cardiac fibroblasts have been shown to induce injury or death of cardiomyocytes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy. We designated glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) as toxic AGEs (TAGE) due to their cytotoxicity and association with LSRD. Intracellular TAGE in cardiomyocytes decreased their beating rate and induced cell death in the absence of myocardial ischemia. The TAGE levels in blood were elevated in patients with CVD and were associated with myocardial ischemia along with increased risk of atherosclerosis in vascular endothelial cells in vitro. The relationships between the dysfunction or cell death of cardiac fibroblasts and intracellular and extracellular TAGE, which are secreted from certain organs, remain unclear. We examined the cytotoxicity of intracellular TAGE by a slot blot analysis, and TAGE-modified bovine serum albumin (TAGE-BSA), a model of extracellular TAGE, in normal human cardiac fibroblasts (HCF). Intracellular TAGE induced cell death in normal HCF, whereas TAGE-BSA did not, even at aberrantly high non-physiological levels. Therefore, only intracellular TAGE induced cell death in HCF under physiological conditions, possibly inhibiting the role of HCF.", "journal": "Metabolites", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["TakanobuTakata", "AkikoSakasai-Sakai", "MasayoshiTakeuchi"], "doi": "10.3390/metabo12070615\n10.3390/metabo12040312\n10.3390/diagnostics6020023\n10.3389/fphys.2021.716721\n10.1152/ajpheart.01021.2013\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109824\n10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153481\n10.3390/metabo12040316\n10.1038/s41598-019-39202-5\n10.1096/fj.04-2780fje\n10.1042/bj2300053\n10.1007/s11897-012-0089-5\n10.3390/nu14020332\n10.1186/s13098-020-00561-z\n10.3892/br.2020.1368\n10.1124/jpet.107.124123\n10.3390/nu11071612\n10.3390/ijms21144861\n10.3748/wjg.v23.i27.4910\n10.3390/nu12102958\n10.3892/br.2021.1422\n10.1073/pnas.1304053110\n10.2337/dc14-1435\n10.1248/bpb.b20-00708\n10.1007/BF03401779"}
{"title": "Effectual Endeavors of Silk Protein Sericin against Isoproterenol Induced Cardiac Toxicity and Hypertrophy in Wistar Rats.", "abstract": "The silkworm cocoon has been used in the treatment of various ailments in different Asian countries. This research was designed to evaluate the effect of sericin on myocardial necrosis and hypertrophy in isoproterenol-challenged rats. The rats were administered with sericin (500 and 1000 mg/kg, p.o.) for 28 days, followed by administration of isoprenaline (85 mg/kg, s.c.) on the 29th and 30th days. The cardioprotective activity was assessed by various physical, enzymatic, and histopathological parameters along with apoptotic marker expression. The cardioprotective effect showed that pre-treatment of rats with sericin significantly increased the non-enzymatic antioxidants marker in serum and heart tissue (glutathione, vitamin E, and vitamin C). The results were the same in enzymatic antioxidant marker, mitochondrial enzymes, and protein. The grading of heart, heart/body weight ratio, gross morphology, cardiac markers, oxidative stress markers in serum and heart tissue, glucose, serum lipid profiling and Lysosomal hydrolases, heart apoptotic markers such as MHC expression by western blot, apoptosis by flow cytometry, total myocardial collagen content, fibrosis estimation, myocyte size were significantly decreased when compared with isoproterenol (ISG) group however histopathological studies showed normal architecture of heart in both control and treated rats. The pharmacological study reflects that sericin on both doses i.e., 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg have potent cardioprotective action against the experimental model which was confirmed by various physical, biochemical, and histopathological parameters evaluated further research is required to examine the molecular mechanism of cardioprotective effect of sericin.", "journal": "Life (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["FaroghAhsan", "TariqueMahmood", "Tanveer AWani", "SeemaZargar", "Mohammed HarisSiddiqui", "ShaziaUsmani", "ArshiyaShamim", "MuhammadWahajuddin"], "doi": "10.3390/life12071063\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.09.083\n10.3390/metabo2020303\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.1155/2017/3920195\n10.1590/s2175-97902019000418365\n10.1055/s-0043-121464\n10.22038/ajp.2013.422\n10.1186/S40816-020-00228-2\n10.1016/0002-8703(63)90271-0\n10.30750/ijpbr.2.1.3\n10.1161/01.HYP.33.1.396\n10.1016/S0076-6879(78)52032-6\n10.1016/0003-2697(79)90738-3\n10.1016/0003-2697(92)90122-N\n10.1016/0014-4800(68)90041-5\n10.1016/0009-8981(78)90128-6\n10.1016/0003-9861(59)90090-6\n10.1016/0003-2697(72)90335-1\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1974.tb03714.x\n10.1016/S0076-6879(84)05016-3\n10.1111/j.1753-4887.1980.tb05961.x\n10.1016/S0076-6879(85)13062-4\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)42083-8\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)57021-6\n10.1093/clinchem/20.4.470\n10.1093/clinchem/19.3.338\n10.1093/clinchem/18.6.499\n10.1016/S0022-2275(20)42943-8\n10.1016/0009-8981(73)90016-8\n10.5555/uri:pii:0022214350903623\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)64849-5\n10.1042/bj1030609\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1968.tb19570.x\n10.1016/0003-2697(72)90302-8\n10.1016/0009-8981(60)90017-6\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)57306-3\n10.1016/0076-6879(69)13016-5\n10.1042/bj0520185\n10.1080/00032710903060750\n10.1007/s11010-010-0577-4\n10.1002/bem.22255\n10.1016/0022-1759(95)00072-I\n10.3892/mmr.2015.4466\n10.1016/0003-9861(61)90291-0\n10.1161/01.RES.65.3.657\n10.4103/2231-4040.104709\n10.1016/j.apsb.2017.05.001\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.008729\n10.13040/IJPSR.0975-8232.5(4).1525-32\n10.1161/01.HYP.6.3.437\n10.1161/01.CIR.91.10.2642\n10.1016/j.febslet.2013.04.018\n10.3109/10408369709038215\n10.1016/S0009-8981(00)00223-0\n10.1177/0192623309357948\n10.1016/S0928-4680(99)00013-9\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.07.108\n10.1016/0955-2863(94)90010-8\n10.1016/S8755-9668(86)80021-7\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1980.tb21324.x\n10.1179/174329210X12650506623168\n10.1080/10496475.2019.1679692\n10.1016/0020-711X(84)90167-8\n10.1016/0022-2828(80)90081-4\n10.1016/j.jep.2004.04.029\n10.1078/0944711041495146\n10.1111/j.1742-7843.2004.pto940405.x\n10.1016/J.PHRS.2004.03.004\n10.3389/fphar.2016.00319\n10.1111/j.1742-7843.2008.00244.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.17.1695\n10.1007/s00392-011-0290-7\n10.5958/0974-360X.2019.00207.5\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00509-6\n10.1016/0304-4157(85)90011-5\n10.1002/jbt.20136\n10.1016/0885-4505(91)90003-4\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.11.067\n10.1016/S0022-2828(85)80017-1\n10.1016/0002-9149(72)90039-2\n10.1080/10408398509527408\n10.1016/0005-2795(77)90102-7\n10.1016/S0022-2836(83)80326-X\n10.1038/aps.2017.58\n10.1016/j.cmet.2007.09.009\n10.1083/jcb.200901052\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.10.027\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.05.039\n10.1016/0009-9120(96)00003-6\n10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05310.x\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00777\n10.3969/J.ISSN.1672-7347.2013.06.001\n10.1007/BF02869912"}
{"title": "Exploring the Mutational Landscape of Isolated Congenital Heart Defects: An Exome Sequencing Study Using Cardiac DNA.", "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common congenital anomalies in liveborn children. In contrast to syndromic CHD (SCHD), the genetic basis of isolated CHD (ICHD) is complex, and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms appear intricate and are incompletely understood. Next to rare Mendelian conditions, somatic mosaicism or a complex multifactorial genetic architecture are assumed for most ICHD. We performed exome sequencing (ES) in 73 parent-offspring ICHD trios using proband DNA extracted from cardiac tissue. We identified six germline de novo variants and 625 germline rare inherited variants with 'damaging' in silico predictions in cardiac-relevant genes expressed in the developing human heart. There were no CHD-relevant somatic variants. Transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) and association testing (AT) yielded no statistically significant results, except for the AT of missense variants in cilia genes. Somatic mutations are not a common cause of ICHD. Rare de novo and inherited protein-damaging variants may contribute to ICHD, possibly as part of an oligogenic or polygenic disease model. TDT and AT failed to provide informative results, likely due to the lack of power, but provided a framework for future studies in larger cohorts. Overall, the diagnostic value of ES on cardiac tissue is limited in individual ICHD cases.", "journal": "Genes", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["IlseMeerschaut", "WouterSteyaert", "ThierryBov\u00e9", "KatrienFran\u00e7ois", "ThomasMartens", "KatyaDe Groote", "HansDe Wilde", "LauraMui\u00f1o Mosquera", "JosephPanzer", "KristofVandekerckhove", "LaraMoons", "PetraVermassen", "SofieSymoens", "Paul JCoucke", "Dani\u00eblDe Wolf", "BertCallewaert"], "doi": "10.3390/genes13071214\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.025\n10.1093/ije/dyz009\n10.1016/j.ejmg.2014.12.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300853\n10.1007/s00018-013-1430-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035954\n10.1002/humu.9255\n10.1136/jmg.2003.017483\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63770-4\n10.1136/jmg.2008.060277\n10.1016/j.ejmg.2011.01.004\n10.1097/PAT.0b013e32834635a9\n10.1002/ajmg.a.34187\n10.3892/ijmm.2012.1188\n10.3892/ijmm.2014.1674\n10.7150/ijms.11700\n10.1007/s00246-017-1650-5\n10.1007/s00246-018-1955-z\n10.1007/s00246-019-02099-y\n10.1186/s13073-020-00738-1\n10.1371/journal.pgen.0020190\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324\n10.1101/gr.107524.110\n10.1038/ng.806\n10.1186/s13059-016-0974-4\n10.1038/s41586-020-2308-7\n10.1186/s13073-021-00835-9\n10.1093/nar/gkx024\n10.1002/1098-2272(2000)19:1+<::AID-GEPI6>3.0.CO;2-M\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.029\n10.1038/75556\n10.1038/s41586-019-1338-5\n10.1002/acn3.51059\n10.1242/dev.129.7.1705\n10.1002/dvdy.10283\n10.1161/01.RES.0000154912.08695.88\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2017-104611\n10.1016/j.ejmg.2017.10.008\n10.1101/gad.13.3.295\n10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80342-1\n10.1093/nar/gkg807\n10.1055/s-0039-1694985\n10.1126/science.aac9396\n10.1038/ng.3627\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.649038\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269795\n10.1093/hmg/ddw155\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.04.017\n10.2174/1389202915666140716175634"}

{"title": "Uterus: A Unique Stem Cell Reservoir Able to Support Cardiac Repair via Crosstalk among Uterus, Heart, and Bone Marrow.", "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests that the prevalence of cardiac disease is lower in premenopausal women compared to postmenopausal women and men. Although multiple factors contribute to this difference, uterine stem cells may be a major factor, as a high abundance of these cells are present in the uterus. Uterine-derived stem cells have been reported in several studies as being able to contribute to cardiac neovascularization after injury. However, our studies uniquely show the presence of an \"utero-cardiac axis\", in which uterine stem cells are able to home to cardiac tissue to promote tissue repair. Additionally, we raise the possibility of a triangular relationship among the bone marrow, uterus, and heart. In this review, we discuss the exchange of stem cells across different organs, focusing on the relationship that exists between the heart, uterus, and bone marrow. We present increasing evidence for the existence of an utero-cardiac axis, in which the uterus serves as a reservoir for cardiac reparative stem cells, similar to the bone marrow. These cells, in turn, are able to migrate to the heart in response to injury to promote healing.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["AnaLudke", "KotaHatta", "AlinaYao", "Ren-KeLi"], "doi": "10.3390/cells11142182\n10.1001/jama.283.14.1845\n10.1001/jama.2019.19191\n10.1001/jama.288.3.321\n10.1056/NEJMoa030808\n10.1001/jama.291.14.1701\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.002\n10.1016/0090-8258(78)90050-1\n10.3390/cells10030595\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb37849.x\n10.1093/humupd/dmy028\n10.1093/humrep/del332\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0411\n10.1089/scd.2014.0225\n10.1177/1933719111414207\n10.1095/biolreprod.112.099309\n10.1093/molehr/gav076\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040691\n10.4161/cc.25917\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044285\n10.1177/1933719110369180\n10.1095/biolreprod.103.024109\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.003\n10.1080/14653240600855905\n10.1007/3-7643-7311-3_8\n10.1095/biolreprod.111.095885\n10.3390/jpm11060477\n10.1093/humrep/deaa261\n10.3727/096368911X637362\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010964\n10.1371/journal.pone.0021221\n10.1093/humrep/det285\n10.1093/humrep/dex289\n10.1002/path.5478\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.11.012\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.016\n10.1186/s13287-021-02526-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010387\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.08.005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050749\n10.1177/1933719118766251\n10.1001/jama.292.1.81\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030260\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3000421\n10.1002/stem.2706\n10.1042/BSR20150025\n10.7326/0003-4819-89-2-157\n10.1016/0039-128X(90)90058-J\n10.7326/0003-4819-85-4-447\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116513\n10.1001/jama.1963.03700080040013\n10.1001/jama.1973.03230060030009\n10.1038/aja.2012.89\n10.1161/01.CIR.75.6.1102\n10.1056/NEJM198704303161801\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.1992.tb14414.x\n10.1093/qjmed/93.3.135\n10.1001/jama.280.7.605\n10.1056/NEJM198510243131702\n10.1016/S0015-0282(16)49942-5\n10.1016/j.bcp.2013.09.024\n10.1016/0002-9378(81)90412-9\n10.1016/S0895-4356(00)00187-6\n10.1242/dmm.009902\n10.4049/jimmunol.173.9.5343\n10.1038/sj.leu.2404132\n10.1038/leu.2014.346\n10.1016/S0010-7824(78)80015-8\n10.1182/blood-2010-01-266882\n10.1089/scd.2014.0478\n10.1172/JCI27019\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.708107\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs072\n10.1038/srep41756\n10.1111/acel.13026\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0828\n10.1073/pnas.0510997103\n10.1152/ajpcell.00013.2010\n10.1242/dev.199906\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.01.024\n10.1371/journal.pone.0068528\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.04.019\n10.3727/096368915X690206\n10.1186/s13287-021-02423-5\n10.1186/1479-5876-5-57\n10.1007/s00018-019-03019-2\n10.1152/ajpheart.00494.2006\n10.1186/1479-5876-11-56\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.03.126\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0386\n10.5966/sctm.2016-0206\n10.1002/sctm.17-0091\n10.1177/1933719118786461\n10.1111/jcmm.15800\n10.1186/s13287-020-01985-0\n10.1002/sctm.20-0154\n10.1038/leu.2011.184\n10.1016/j.cjca.2012.08.009\n10.1093/humupd/dml045\n10.1093/biolre/ioac029\n10.1007/s43032-021-00738-5\n10.5653/cerm.2018.45.4.149\n10.1002/stem.3431\n10.1111/jog.14888\n10.3390/cells11040714\n10.1038/gim.2013.181\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.590653\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300219\n10.1096/fj.07-8636com\n10.1517/14712598.2013.826187\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0826\n10.1371/journal.pone.0175986\n10.1016/j.molmed.2010.02.005\n10.1096/fj.05-5211com\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01068.x\n10.1038/mt.2011.173\n10.1186/1479-5876-6-45\n10.1096/fj.03-0256com\n10.18632/aging.102737\n10.1177/09636897211020734\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.035\n10.1038/nrm3495\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.02.017\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315408\n10.1530/REP-08-0539\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.11.016\n10.1016/S0925-4773(01)00614-1\n10.1006/dbio.1999.9206\n10.2741/s347\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00431\n10.1039/D0NR08942G\n10.1155/2019/4506303"}

In this study the imaging method fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy is adopted for visualization with high spatial resolution and quantification of ultrafine PM particles in mouse lung and heart tissues. The results showed that the median numbers of particles in lung of mice exposed to ultrafine particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m was about 2.0 times more than that in the filtered air (FA)-treated mice, and about 1.3 times more in heart of ultrafine PM-treated mice than in FA-treated mice. Interestingly, ultrafine PM particles were more abundant in heart than lung, likely due to how ultrafine PM particles are cleared by phagocytosis and transport via circulation from lungs. Moreover, heart tissues showed inflammation and amyloid deposition. The component analysis of concentrated airborne ultrafine PM particles suggested traffic exhausts and industrial emissions as predominant sources. Our results suggest association of ultrafine PM exposure to chronic lung and heart tissue injuries. The current study supports the contention that industrial air pollution is one of the causative factors for rising levels of chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Particle and fibre toxicology", "date": "2022-07-27", "authors": ["SairaHameed", "KunPan", "WenhuaSu", "MilesTrupp", "LanMi", "JinzhuoZhao"], "doi": "10.1186/s12989-022-00493-8\n10.1038/s41598-018-37704-2\n10.1038/s41569-020-0371-2\n10.1073/pnas.1818134116\n10.1016/j.talo.2020.100013\n10.1055/s-0040-1708059\n10.3233/jad-2008-13105\n10.1098/rsbl.2003.0012\n10.1038/s41467-019-11654-3\n10.1073/pnas.1605941113\n10.1021/nn403256v\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b00502\n10.1021/ja073527l\n10.1021/nl400368v\n10.1016/0030-4018(80)90336-3\n10.1038/nrd2153\n10.1080/08958370490443079\n10.1111/jcmm.15475\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101645\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101161\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.04.017\n10.3390/ijerph19042297\n10.1038/341226a0\n10.1007/s11356-020-09042-2\n10.1016/j.chest.2018.10.042\n10.1038/s41598-020-61003-4\n10.1016/j.envint.2020.105594\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2018.03.022\n10.1136/oem.37.4.337\n10.1161/hc0402.104118\n10.1002/tox.23035\n10.1007/s00011-018-1191-2\n10.1164/rccm.201203-0455PP\n10.3390/cells10010051\n10.1016/j.mam.2018.07.001\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa324\n10.1097/01.JAA.0000697236.11386.3a\n10.1186/s12940-019-0506-2\n10.1093/ije/dyz114\n10.3109/08958371003599037\n10.1093/toxsci/64.2.243\n10.1289/ehp.112-1241994\n10.1007/s11356-019-07584-8\n10.1007/s11356-020-11034-1\n10.5194/acp-18-5467-2018\n10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114870\n10.1289/ehp.1307776\n10.1038/s12276-020-0394-0\n10.1080/08958370590912743\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.02.064\n10.5194/acp-19-5973-2019"}

This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of circ_Ddx60 in the mouse model of I/R injury. Cardiac tissues were used to extract RNA for subsequent RNA sequencing analysis. Bioinformatic analysis was performed and circ_Ddx60 and Bcl2a1a (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 related protein A1a) were selected for further validation. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the gene expression level. The effect of circ_Ddx60 on cardiac cell apoptosis was examined. The function of miR-302a-3p in cell apoptosis was further explored in circ_Ddx60-overexpressed HL-1 cells under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment. We have revealed a number of differentially expressed circRNAs and mRNAs between the I/R group and sham groups, with circ_Ddx60 being among them. Treatment of HL-1 cells with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) led to an overexpression of circ_Ddx60, which then inhibited apoptosis and promoted the Bcl2a1a expression. Furthermore, circ_Ddx60 directly binds with miR-302a-3p, which could reverse the effect of circ_Ddx60 overexpression on cellular apoptosis and Bcl2a1a expression. Our study revealed that circ_Ddx60 inhibits apoptosis in myocardial cells by regulating the miR-302a-3p/Bcl2a1a axis, which provides novel insights into the prevention of myocardial I/R injury.", "journal": "Discovery medicine", "date": "2022-07-27", "authors": ["YuSun", "YuanmeiZhang", "ZebingYe", "YanWang", "YuLao", "JuhongZhang", "MingFang", "JieHe", "HaoYin", "WenYan", "WenJin"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Cardiotoxicity of Chemical Substances: An Emerging Hazard Class.", "abstract": "(1) Background: Human health risks and hazards from chemical substances are well regulated internationally. However, cardiotoxicity, is not defined as a stand-alone hazard and therefore there are no defined criteria for the classification of substances as cardiotoxic. Identifying and regulating substances that cause cardiovascular adverse effects would undoubtedly strengthen the national health systems. (2) Methods: To overcome the aforementioned gap, a roadmap is proposed for identifying regulatory criteria from animal studies and endorse legislation in order to classify substances as cardiotoxic. The roadmap consists of: (i) the identification of the appropriate animal species and strains; (ii) the identification of the lines of scientific evidence (e.g., histopathological, biochemical and echocardiographic indices etc.) from animal studies with relevance to humans; (iii) the statistical analysis and meta-analysis for each line of scientific evidence after exposure to well-established cardiotoxicants to humans (e.g., anthracyclines) in order to identify threshold values or range of normal and/ or altered values due to exposure; (iv) validation of the above described lines of evidence in animals exposed to other alleged cardiotoxic substances (e.g., anabolic androgen steroids (AAS) and pesticides); (v) establishment of mechanisms of action based on information of either known or alleged cardiotoxicants; and (vi) introduction of novel indices and in silico methods. (3) Results: Preliminary results in rats indicate a clear distinction from normal values to values measured in rats exposed to anthracyclines regarding left ventricle (LV) fractional shortening (FS) and LV ejection fraction (EF). A distinctive pattern is similarly observed for Creatine Kinase-Myocardial Band isoenzyme (CK-MB) and cardiac tissue glutathione (GSH). These findings are encouraging and indicate that there is room for targeted research to this end, and that these specific indices and biochemical markers should be further investigated in order to be developed to regulatory criteria.

Previous studies have shown the importance of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in reducing indices of cardiac tissue apoptosis in different patients, but in the field of sports science, the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in methamphetamine-dependent rats are still unclear. The present article aimed to investigate the changes in cardiac apoptosis markers in methamphetamine-dependent rats in response to HIIT. Left ventricular tissue was used to evaluate caspase-3, melusin, FAK, and IQGAP1 gene expression. Rats were divided into four groups: sham, methamphetamine (METH), METH-control, and METH-HIIT. METH was injected for 21 days and then the METH-HIIT group performed HIIT for 8 weeks at 5 sessions per week. The METH groups showed increased caspase-3 gene expression and decreased melusin, FAK, and IQGAP1 when compared to the sham group. METH-HIIT showed decreased caspase-3 and increased melusin and FAK gene expression compared with the METH and METH-control groups. The IQGAP1 gene was higher in METH-HIIT when compared with METH, while no difference was observed between METH-HIIT and METH-control.

The number of studies evaluating the relationship between changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiac biomarkers following an endurance event is limited. We hypothesized that there would be a time-dependent correlation between biomarkers of cardiac damage and the reduction in parasympathetic indices of HRV within 24\u00a0h after 60\u00a0min of running in middle-aged recreational runners.\nThe trained, middle-aged runners who participated in this study ran 60\u00a0min at a half-marathon pace on a treadmill. Blood samples (before and 0, 4, and 24\u00a0h after the running test) and HRV data (before and 0, 1, 4, and 24\u00a0h after the running test) were obtained.\nAfter running, cardiac biomarkers (total creatine kinase, cardiac isoform of creatine kinase, creatine kinase-index [CK-Index], cardiac troponin [cTnI]) increased significantly, and HRV measures related to parasympathetic nervous system activity decreased significantly; these measures returned to baseline levels within 24\u00a0h. Finally, there were significant correlations (all p\u2009<\u20090.05) between the change (4\u00a0h post-running vs. pre-running) in the CK-Index and the changes (post- vs pre-running) in time-domain and nonlinear measures of HRV (r -\u00a00.61 to -\u00a00.67). In addition, significant correlations (all p\u2009<\u20090.05) were found between the area under the cTnI curve and change (1-h post- and pre-running) in time-domain and nonlinear measures of HRV (r -\u00a00.48 to -\u00a00.51).\nThe correlation between HRV and cardiac biomarkers indicates that HRV analysis may be an alternative approach to determine the magnitude of cardiac stress after endurance exercises.", "journal": "Clinical autonomic research : official journal of the Clinical Autonomic Research Society", "date": "2022-07-26", "authors": ["Kerem\u00d6zg\u00fcnen", "\u00d6zg\u00fcrG\u00fcna\u015ft\u0131", "\u00c7i\u011fdem\u00d6zdemir", "SelcenKorkmaz Ery\u0131lmaz", "Ertu\u011frulGezgin", "CumhurBoyraz", "AbdullahK\u0131lc\u0131", "\u00dcmitAda\u015f", "Sadi SKurdak"], "doi": "10.1007/s10286-022-00878-x\n10.1038/s41569-020-0354-3\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab095\n10.1249/MSS.0000000000000270\n10.1373/clinchem.2015.240796\n10.1007/s11897-018-0385-9\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr397\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2009.01.294\n10.1002/clc.23459\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000749\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw340\n10.1007/s40279-013-0083-4\n10.1249/MSS.0b013e31818313ff\n10.23736/S0022-4707.20.11657-8\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e3181e52e69\n10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602118\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.3.h1145\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2013.07.024\n10.3389/fpubh.2017.00258\n10.1123/ijspp.2014-0235\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a014868\n10.3390/s21123998\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00025-4\n10.1007/s00421-019-04187-6\n10.5507/ag.2017.021\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00301\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034655\n10.1111/jch.12591\n10.1001/jama.1981.03320180041027\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01913\n10.5604/20831862.1163384\n10.5604/20831862.1150300\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01267\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000617\n10.21037/jlpm.2019.01.04\n10.3389/fphys.2021.651851\n10.1007/BF03256230\n10.1249/mss.0b013e318060f17d\n10.1136/hrt.2010.213462"}

Despite several advances that have been made in the treatment of MI, current strategies are still far from satisfactory. Nanomaterials devote considerable contribution to tackling the drawbacks of conventional therapy of MI by improving the homeostasis in the cardiac microenvironment via targeting, immune modulation, and repairment. This review emphasizes the strategies of nanomaterials-based MI treatment, including cardiac targeting drug delivery, immune-modulation strategy, antioxidants and antiapoptosis strategy, nanomaterials-mediated stem cell therapy, and cardiac tissue engineering. Furthermore, nanomaterials-based diagnosis strategies for MI was presented in term of nanomaterials-based immunoassay and nano-enhanced cardiac imaging.

This study sought to clarify the pathogenesis of ATTRv amyloidosis, specifically, how transthyretin (TTR) amyloid begins to deposit in cardiomyocytes and how this deposition progresses in these cells.\nWe analyzed autopsy cardiac tissues from five patients with ATTRv amyloidosis by using confocal microscopy with thioflavin S staining and immunofluorescence and electron microscopy to demonstrate the pattern of TTR amyloid deposition in cardiomyocytes.\nWe demonstrated predominant amyloid deposition in the transverse tubules (t-tubules) of cardiomyocytes at the early stage of TTR amyloid deposition. Also, a pattern of the progression of amyloid deposition from deeply invaginated extracellular matrix, that is, t-tubules, to cell surface extracellular matrix, that is, basement membrane, was noted. Three-dimensional confocal microscopic images revealed the abnormal architecture of the t-tubules with nodular swelling, branching, and confluence in the cardiomyocytes with amyloid deposition. Double immunofluorescence staining with anti-TTR antibody and CACNA1C antibody demonstrated reduced voltage-dependent calcium channels around amyloid deposition.\nOur pathological study demonstrated that t-tubule involvement is an early event in cardiomyocytes in the pathogenesis of ATTRv amyloidosis.

{"title": "LMISA: A lightweight multi-modality image segmentation network via domain adaptation using gradient magnitude and shape constraint.", "abstract": "In medical image segmentation, supervised machine learning models trained using one image modality (e.g. computed tomography (CT)) are often prone to failure when applied to another image modality (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) even for the same organ. This is due to the significant intensity variations of different image modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep neural network to achieve multi-modality image segmentation, where image labels of only one modality (source domain) are available for model training and the image labels for the other modality (target domain) are not available. In our method, a multi-resolution locally normalized gradient magnitude approach is firstly applied to images of both domains for minimizing the intensity discrepancy. Subsequently, a dual task encoder-decoder network including image segmentation and reconstruction is utilized to effectively adapt a segmentation network to the unlabeled target domain. Additionally, a shape constraint is imposed by leveraging adversarial learning. Finally, images from the target domain are segmented, as the network learns a consistent latent feature representation with shape awareness from both domains. We implement both 2D and 3D versions of our method, in which we evaluate CT and MRI images for kidney and cardiac tissue segmentation. For kidney, a public CT dataset (KiTS19, MICCAI 2019) and a local MRI dataset were utilized. The cardiac dataset was from the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MMWHS) challenge 2017. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance with a much lower model complexity in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our method is also capable of producing superior segmentation results than other methods for images of an unseen target domain without model retraining.

{"title": "Synonymous mutation rs1129293 is associated with PIK3CG expression and PI3K\u03b3 activation in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that do not change the composition of amino acids and cause synonymous mutations (sSNPs) were previously considered to lack any functional roles. However, sSNPs have recently been shown to interfere with protein expression owing to a myriad of factors related to the regulation of transcription, mRNA stability, and protein translation processes. In patients with Chagas disease, the presence of the synonymous mutation rs1129293 in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase gamma (PIK3CG) gene contributes to the development of the chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), instead of the digestive or asymptomatic forms. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether rs1129293 is associated with the transcription of PIK3CG mRNA and its activity by quantifying AKT phosphorylation in the heart samples of 26 chagasic patients with CCC. Our results showed an association between rs1129293 and decreased PIK3CG mRNA expression levels in the cardiac tissues of patients with CCC. The phosphorylation levels of AKT, the protein target of PI3K, were also reduced in patients with this mutation, but were not correlated with PI3KCG mRNA expression levels. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis showed that rs1129293 and other SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) were associated with the transcriptional regulatory elements, post-transcriptional modifications, and cell-specific splicing expression of PIK3CG mRNA. Therefore, our data demonstrates that the synonymous SNP rs1129293 is capable of affecting the PIK3CG mRNA expression and PI3K\u03b3 activation.", "journal": "Immunobiology", "date": "2022-07-24", "authors": ["Maria Cl\u00e1udiaSilva", "Carlos AlessandroFuzo", "IsadoraMarques Paiva", "NairaLopes Bib\u00f3", "MaykonTavares de Oliveira", "Hellen Anast\u00e1ciada Silva Soares", "ChristopheChevillard", "JorgeKalil", "EdecioCunha-Neto", "Thiago MattarCunha", "Jo\u00e3o SantanaSilva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.imbio.2022.152242"}

{"title": "Role of Biomaterials in Cardiac Repair and Regeneration: Therapeutic Intervention for Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Heart failure or myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the world's leading causes of death. Post MI, the heart can develop pathological conditions such as ischemia, inflammation, fibrosis, and left ventricular dysfunction.

Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches have shown promising effects in the repair and replacement of injured cardiomyocytes. Additionally, biomaterial scaffolds with or without stem cells are established to provide an effective environment for cardiac regeneration. Excipients loaded with growth factors, cytokines, oligonucleotides, and exosomes are found to help in such cardiac eventualities by promoting angiogenesis, cardiomyocyte proliferation, and reducing fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis.

The in vivo studies showed that circulating exosomes reduced the infarcted size, improved the morphology of heart tissues and also reduced apoptosis of the heart tissues. In addition, the model mice showed an increase in the CD34\u2009+\u2009/VEGFR2\u2009+\u2009cell population and CD31, CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression after exosomes treatment.

Further analysis revealed that miR-190a-3p could physically interact with CXCR4/CXCL12 by targeting the respective 3'UTRs. These exosomes could up-regulated CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression in the EPCs; in addition, miR-190a-3p mimics repressed CXCR4/CXCL12 expression in EPCs, while its inhibitor had opposite effects. The in vitro functional assays showed that miR-190a-3p overexpression suppressed the cell viability, proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation of EPCs; while miR-190a-3p inhibitor had the opposite effects; exosomes derived from the culture medium of hypoxia-treated HCMs exhibited similar actions of miR-190a-3p inhibitor. Moreover, miR-190a-3p was down-regulated in exosomes from serum in the AMI group when compared to that from sham group. Treatment with exosomes from serum in the AMI group promoted cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation of EPCs when compared to that in the sham group. More importantly, IT1t attenuated the enhanced effects of miR-190a-3p inhibition on EPC proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation. In conclusion, circulating exosomes exerted protective effects on myocardial injury in the AMI mice model, and down-regulation of miR-190a-3p in the circulating exosomes may exert protective effects against myocardial injury. Hypoxia induced the downregulation of miR-190a-3p in the culture medium of HCMs, and the mechanistic investigations indicated that exosomes of hypoxia-conditioned HCM culture medium promoted the cell viability, proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation of EPCs via regulating miR-190a-3p/CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway.", "journal": "Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes", "date": "2022-07-23", "authors": ["Chun-YuanJiang", "Ting-TingZhong", "Lu-WenQiu", "Yan-FengLiu", "Hui-HuaZuo", "Xiao-FeiHuang"], "doi": "10.1007/s10863-022-09944-5\n10.1007/s00296-010-1377-6\n10.1056/NEJMra1606915\n10.1097/jim.0000000000000232\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.08.004\n10.1111/jcmm.16202\n10.1016/j.tcm.2017.07.011\n10.7150/thno.43163\n10.1038/s41467-019-08895-7\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00212\n10.1161/01.res.0000205765.28940.93\n10.1186/s13287-019-1353-3\n10.1016/j.scr.2009.12.003\n10.1089/jir.2014.0004\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.615850\n10.1186/s13287-019-1377-8\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.018\n10.1007/s00109-016-1432-1\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-013118-111902\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2017.02.005\n10.1083/jcb.201211138\n10.1016/s0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.3892/etm.2020.8599\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.09.008\n10.1089/scd.2015.0290\n10.1161/jaha.118.008737\n10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61237-4\n10.1089/scd.2020.0132\n10.7150/thno.53326\n10.1155/2021/3010548\n10.1093/cvr/cvz040\n10.1038/s41598-020-61098-9\n10.1186/s12951-021-00808-5"}

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathological mechanism of CRS-3, and empagliflozin can improve mitochondrial biology by promoting mitophagy.

Empagliflozin stabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential, suppressed mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, increased mitochondrial respiratory complex activity and restored the oxygen consumption rate in cardiomyocytes from CRS-3 model mice. Empagliflozin also normalized the mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening rate in cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific ablation of FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1) in mice abolished the protective effects of empagliflozin on mitochondrial homeostasis and myocardial performance.

The biological mechanisms that elicit wildfire-associated toxicity remain largely unknown. The potential involvement of cross-tissue communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a new mechanism that has yet to be evaluated.\nFemale CD-1 mice were exposed to smoke condensate samples collected from the following biomass burn scenarios: flaming peat; smoldering peat; flaming red oak; and smoldering red oak, representing lab-based simulations of wildfire scenarios. Lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, peripheral blood, and heart tissues were collected 4 and 24\u00a0h post-exposure. Exosome-enriched EVs were isolated from plasma, physically characterized, and profiled for microRNA (miRNA) expression. Pathway-level responses in the lung and heart were evaluated through RNA sequencing and pathway analyses.\nMarkers of cardiopulmonary tissue injury and inflammation from BALF samples were significantly altered in response to exposures, with the greatest changes occurring from flaming biomass conditions. Plasma EV miRNAs relevant to cardiovascular disease showed exposure-induced expression alterations, including miR-150, miR-183, miR-223-3p, miR-30b, and miR-378a. Lung and heart mRNAs were identified with differential expression enriched for hypoxia and cell stress-related pathways. Flaming red oak exposure induced the greatest transcriptional response in the heart, a large portion of which were predicted as regulated by plasma EV miRNAs, including miRNAs known to regulate hypoxia-induced cardiovascular injury. Many of these miRNAs had published evidence supporting their transfer across tissues. A follow-up analysis of miR-30b showed that it was increased in expression in the heart of exposed mice in the absence of changes to its precursor molecular, pri-miR-30b, suggesting potential transfer from external sources (e.g., plasma).\nThis study posits a potential mechanism through which wildfire exposures induce cardiopulmonary responses, highlighting the role of circulating plasma EVs in intercellular and systems-level communication between tissues.", "journal": "Environment international", "date": "2022-07-22", "authors": ["Celeste KCarberry", "Lauren EKoval", "AlexisPayton", "HadleyHartwell", "YongHo Kim", "Gregory JSmith", "David MReif", "IlonaJaspers", "MIan Gilmour", "Julia ERager"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envint.2022.107419\n10.15139/S3/QNTVKJ&version=DRAFT\n10.15139/S3/QNTVKJ\n10.1038/s41370-022-00417-w\n10.15139/S3/KKQ9NE"}
{"title": "Age-Independent Cardiac Protection by Pharmacological Activation of Beclin-1 During Endotoxemia and Its Association With Energy Metabolic Reprograming in Myocardium-A Targeted Metabolomics Study.", "abstract": "Background We showed that Beclin-1-dependent autophagy protects the heart in young and adult mice that underwent endotoxemia. Herein, we compared the potential therapeutic effects of Beclin-1 activating peptide, TB-peptide, on endotoxemia-induced cardiac outcomes in young adult and aged mice. We further evaluated lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide)-induced and TB-peptide treatment-mediated alterations in myocardial metabolism. Methods and Results C57BL/6J mice that were 10\u2009weeks and 24 months old were challenged by lipopolysaccharide using doses at which cardiac dysfunction occurred. Following the treatment of TB-peptide or control vehicle, heart contractility, circulating cytokines, and myocardial autophagy were evaluated. We detected that TB-peptide boosted autophagy, attenuated cytokines, and improved cardiac performance in both young and aged mice during endotoxemia. A targeted metabolomics assay was designed to detect a pool of 361 known metabolites, of which 156 were detected in at least 1 of the heart tissue samples. Lipopolysaccharide-induced impairments were found in glucose and amino acid metabolisms in mice of all ages, and TB-peptide ameliorated these alterations. However, lipid metabolites were upregulated in the young group but moderately downregulated in the aged by lipopolysaccharide, suggesting an age-dependent response. TB-peptide mitigated lipopolysaccharide-mediated trend of lipids in the young mice but had little effect on the aged. (Study registration: Project DOI: https://doi.org/10.21228/M8K11W). Conclusions Pharmacological activation of Beclin-1 by TB-peptide is cardiac protective in both young and aged population during endotoxemia, suggest a therapeutic potential for sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.

{"title": "Investigating the influence of the viscoelastic material as a heart muscle simulator on the powering leadless pacemaker from heartbeats by using a piezoelectric beam.", "abstract": "This paper studies experimentally and analytically the influence of the viscoelastic cardiac muscle on the energy harvesting from heartbeats for powering the leadless pacemakers by using a piezoelectric beam. An appropriate representative gel-type viscoelastic material that mimics the heart tissue is used in the tests. The piezoelectric beam coupled with a gel-type material is analytically modeled, and experimentally tested. By considering a combination of the translational standard linear solid model and a rotational spring component for the gel-type material, the analytical model of the coupled system is developed utilizing the generalized Hamilton's principle. The system is attached on top of a shaker and excited harmonically, and the time history of output voltage and accelerations are measured. The analytical model is verified by experimental results for the tip displacement, voltage, generated power, phase-portraits histories, and voltage FRF with harmonic base excitations. Transmissibility analysis by the analytical model shows that for excitation frequencies beyond a specific frequency, the viscoelastic material can magnify the amplitude of the excitation and incredibly improve the power generation. Experimental results demonstrate that by coupling the gel into the harvester, oscillations of the tip are increased into high energy orbits and large tip deflections around the resonance frequency. The significantly widened frequency bandwidth and the increased power output at specific input frequencies are the other results of considering the viscoelastic characteristics of the heart wall in the dynamic investigations. By simulating the response of the energy harvesting system to the heartbeat impulsive rhythm, when the energy harvesting system is attached to the viscoelastic material, the output power is increased from 18 to 55\u2009\u00b5W. The obtained results reveal that influence of the viscoelastic properties of the heart muscle is crucial in the accurate design of the energy harvesting system for the self-powered medical leadless pacemaker.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

{"title": "Evaluation of Cardiovascular Concerns of Intravenous Lacosamide Therapy in Epilepsy Patients.", "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play an important role in neuronal excitability and epilepsies. In addition to the brain, VGSCs are also abundant enriched in cardiac tissues and are responsible for normal cardiac rhythm. Theoretically, sodium channel blocking antiseizure medications (SCB-ASMs) may have unwanted cardiac side effects. Lacosamide (LCM) is increasingly used in patients with status epilepticus (SE) due to the availability of intravenous formula. The concerns about the proarrhythmic effect are even higher due to the need for rapid administration of LCM. There were limited data on the cardiac safety of intravenous LCM. Hereby, we performed a study to observe the effect of intravenous loading of LCM in patients with seizures in our Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU).\nWe retrospectively reviewed the patients using parenteral LCM for seizures in NICU. A routine infusion time of 30 min was performed. The electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure were recorded before and after LCM injection.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 38 patients using LCM for treating seizures. Two patients had cardiac side effects after LCM loading, one (3.0%) with new-onset first-degree AV block and the other (3.0%) with atrial premature complex. For the quantitative changes of ECG parameter analysis, there was no change in QRS complex, corrected QT intervals, and heart rate except that the PR interval was mildly increased. A mild decrease in the diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were also observed. None of the above-mentioned parameter alterations required clinical intervention.\nWe evaluated the cardiac safety concern in real-world epilepsy patients requiring intravenous LCM. Near half of this cohort responded to LCM therapy and there was no life-threatening cardiac adverse effect. Intravenous LCM does have some effects on the ECG parameters and blood pressure but without clinical relevance.

JQ1 was preprotected for 1\u00a0h, and LPS was stimulated for 12\u00a0h, mouse survival and cardiac function were observed, and histopathological, serum myocardial injury markers, and inflammatory indicators, and oxidative stress levels in heart tissue were examined. The experiment found that the cardiac BRD4 levels were upregulated and the heart severe damage in the LPS group compared with the control group. While compared with the LPS group, JQ1 preprotected increased survival rate and cardiac function, reducated cardiomypathological injury and CD45 infiltration, and reduced the release of LDH, CK-MB, IL-1, IL-18, reduced MDA generation, and increased SOD viability. In addition, JQ1 preprotected also upregulated SIRT1, and inhibited the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1p20, and GSDMD.

{"title": "Compatibility and function of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes on an electrospun nanofibrous scaffold, generated from an ionomeric polyurethane composite.", "abstract": "Synthetic scaffolds are needed for generating organized neo-myocardium constructs to promote functional tissue repair. This study investigated the biocompatibility of an elastomeric electrospun degradable polar/hydrophobic/ionic polyurethane (D-PHI) composite scaffold with human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). The composite material was electrospun to generate scaffolds, with nanofibres oriented in aligned or random directions. These features enabled the authors to evaluate the effect of characteristic elements which mimic that of the native extracellular matrix (alignment, chemical heterogeneity, and fiber topography) on hiPSC-CMs activity. The functional nature of the hiPSC-CM cultured on gelatin and Matrigel-coated scaffolds were assessed, investigating the influence of protein interactions with the synthetic substrate on subsequent cell phenotype. After 7\u2009days of culture, high hiPSC-CM viability was observed on the scaffolds. The cells on the aligned scaffold were elongated and demonstrated aligned sarcomeres that oriented parallel to the direction of the fibers, while the cells on random scaffolds and a tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) control did not exhibit such an organized morphology. The hiPSC-CMs cultured on the scaffolds and TCPS expressed similar levels of cardiac troponin-T, but there was a higher expression of ventricular myosin light chain-2 on the D-PHI composite scaffolds versus TCPS, indicating a higher proportion of hiPSC-CM exhibiting a ventricular cardiomyocyte like phenotype. Within 7\u2009days, the hiPSC-CMs on aligned scaffolds and TCPS beat synchronously and had similar conductive velocities. These preliminary results show that aligned D-PHI elastomeric scaffolds allow hiPSC-CMs to demonstrate important cardiomyocytes characteristics, critical to enabling their future potential use for cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

FTIR analysis of M.\u00a0nigra fruit extract revealed the presence of alcohols (O-H), alkanes (C-H stretch), alkenes (C=C), and alkynes (C\u2261C). The HPLC analysis quantified the quercetin, gallic acid, vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, cinnamic acid, sinapic acid, and kaempferol. Furthermore, the cardioprotective activity of ethanolic extract of M.\u00a0nigra fruit was investigated. Cholesterol supplementation (2%) in the daily diet and exposure to cigarette smoke (2 cigarettes twice a day) were to induce hypertension in rats. The experimental animals were categorized into four groups: G0 (negative control), G1 (positive control), G2 (standard drug), and G3 (M.\u00a0nigra fruit). The fruit extract administration at 300\u2009mg/kg BW/day orally for 2\u2009months significantly (p\u2009<\u2009.001) enhanced the activities of serum and cardiac tissue antioxidants in hypertensive rats. Meanwhile, the fruit extract reduced the elevated serum lipid profile while significantly increasing the high-density lipoproteins in G3 than G1 and G2. The increase in blood pressure, liver transaminases, and serum lactate dehydrogenase also reduced significantly in M.\u00a0nigra fruit extract-treated rats. Histopathological findings revealed mild normalization of cardiac myocytes with central nuclei, branching, and cross-striations. Consequently, the M.\u00a0nigra fruit extract exerted the cardioprotective potential via increasing the antioxidant enzymes and reducing the lipids, lactate dehydrogenase, liver transaminases, and blood pressure. The therapeutic potential of M.\u00a0nigra fruit can be due to flavonols and phenolic acids.

{"title": "Excessive Sodium Intake Leads to Cardiovascular Disease by Promoting Sex-Specific Dysfunction of Murine Heart.", "abstract": "Globally, a high-salt diet (HSD) has become a threat to human health as it can lead to a high risk of cardiac damage. Although some studies investigating HSD have been carried out, the majority has been conducted in males, and there are few female-specific studies, thereby ignoring any effects of sex-specific damage on the heart. In this study, we determined how HSD induces different pathways of cardiovascular diseases through sex-specific effects on cardiac damage in mice.\nAn HSD murine model of male and female C57BL/6J mice was fed with sodium-rich chow (4% NaCl). After 8 weeks, cardiac tissues were collected, and the whole gene transcriptome of the hearts of male and female mice was characterized and analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Immunohistochemistry staining was used to further assess the harmful effects of HSD on protein expression of genes associated with immunity, fibrosis, and apoptosis in male and female mice.\nHSD drastically altered the cardiac transcriptome compared to that of the normal heart in both male and female mice and had a sex-specific effect on the cardiac composition in the transcriptome. HSD produced various differentially expressed genes and affected different KEGG pathways of the transcriptome in male and female mice. Furthermore, we found that HSD induced different pathways of cardiovascular disease in the male mice and female mice. The pathway of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is significantly enriched in HSD-treated male mice, while the pathway of dilated cardiomyopathy is significantly enriched in HSD-treated female mice. Finally, metabolism, immunity, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the mouse heart showed sex-specific changes predicting cardiac damage.\nOur results demonstrate that HSD adversely impacts cardiac structure and function by affecting the metabolism, immunity, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the murine heart and induces the mouse to suffer from sex-specific cardiovascular disease. This study provides a new perspective and basis for the differences in the pharmacology and interventional treatment of sex-specific cardiovascular diseases induced by HSD in men and women.", "journal": "Frontiers in nutrition", "date": "2022-07-19", "authors": ["XiuliChen", "HaiyingWu", "ShenzhenHuang"], "doi": "10.3389/fnut.2022.830738\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31376-X\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aay3850\n10.3390/nu6125534\n10.1056/NEJMra1212606\n10.1126/science.288.5470.1319\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31909-2\n10.1093/ije/dyp139\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000001836\n10.1056/NEJMoa1304127\n10.1002/14651858.CD004937.pub2\n10.1093/rheumatology/keu330\n10.1136/jnnp-2014-307928\n10.1038/s41586-019-1688-z\n10.1111/jhn.12761\n10.1016/j.clnu.2012.01.003\n10.3390/ijms20030590\n10.1152/ajpregu.2001.281.1.R352\n10.1093/ajh/hpv155\n10.1677/JOE-07-0130\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00285.2005\n10.1111/iep.12318\n10.1056/NEJMoa1311989\n10.1056/NEJMoa1311889\n10.3389/fnut.2021.667130\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.701745\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037159\n10.1186/s12864-018-5213-9\n10.1038/s41598-017-01047-1\n10.1038/75556\n10.1093/nar/gky1055\n10.1093/nar/gky1131\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e32833fc8b0\n10.1186/1471-2105-16-S18-S7\n10.1038/srep32249\n10.1016/j.tig.2006.08.008\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw549\n10.1001/jama.2017.0947\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.23.2621\n10.1093/cvr/cvy252\n10.1152/ajpregu.00392.2009\n10.1016/j.nut.2018.07.002\n10.3390/nu11051013\n10.1177/1933719113488447\n10.1002/tox.22676\n10.1038/nrg2415\n10.1126/science.aba3066\n10.1200/JCO.2009.27.0579\n10.1016/S1550-8579(07)80054-4\n10.1093/hmg/ddz074\n10.1001/archpsyc.55.5.405\n10.1212/WNL.53.9.1992\n10.1001/archpsyc.60.6.565\n10.1136/jnnp.2003.020982\n10.1002/cncr.22008\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.112894\n10.1681/ASN.2020081112\n10.1186/2042-6410-4-21\n10.1186/s12915-017-0352-z\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2014.12.002\n10.1016/j.gene.2018.07.069\n10.1073/pnas.1713837115\n10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05897\n10.1038/s41467-018-05249-7\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.009\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2019.04.018\n10.3389/fendo.2020.570846\n10.1371/journal.pone.0110501\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00009.2012\n10.1172/jci.insight.131092\n10.1111/acel.12344\n10.1038/s41422-020-00412-6\n10.1038/s41588-018-0133-9\n10.1093/hmg/ddy432\n10.1093/cvr/cvy277\n10.1007/s11906-020-01113-6\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr194\n10.1172/JCI88532\n10.1007/s10741-015-9478-7\n10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.04.384\n10.3390/ani10040590\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00777\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.02.047\n10.1016/j.tcm.2017.01.011\n10.1016/S0895-7061(02)03268-5\n10.1155/2014/491963\n10.1007/s00726-018-2615-6\n10.3390/nu13113920\n10.1038/nrg2918\n10.3389/fnut.2018.00001\n10.1093/ajh/hpy023\n10.3945/ajcn.116.150136\n10.1186/s12876-021-01912-4\n10.1172/JCI80919\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11128\n10.1152/ajprenal.00258.2014\n10.3390/nu13103577\n10.1038/nature11868\n10.1186/s12974-017-0954-y\n10.1016/j.exer.2019.107784"}

Thus, this study sought to elucidate the mechanisms of cardioprotection of s-limonene in an isoproterenol-induced MI animal model.\nWistar rats were treated with 1\u00a0mg/kg s-limonene (SL) or 100\u00a0mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (NAC, positive control) once, 30\u00a0min after isoproterenol-induced MI (applied in two doses with a 24\u00a0h interval). The protective effects of SL in the heart were examined via the serum level of creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), electrocardiographic profile, infarct size and histological parameters. Using isolated cardiomyocytes, we also assessed calcium transient amplitude, cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress and the expression of proteins related to oxidative stress.\nSL at a concentration of 1\u00a0mg/kg attenuated isoproterenol-induced MI injury, by preventing ST-segment elevation and QTc prolongation in the ECG.

{"title": "Ferulic acid mitigates diabetic cardiomyopathy via modulation of metabolic abnormalities in cardiac tissues of diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular abnormalities have been reported as a major contributor of diabetic mortality. The protective effect of ferulic acid on diabetic cardiomyopathy in fructose-streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes (T2D) rat model was elucidated in this study. Type 2 diabetic rats were treated by oral administration of low (150\u2009mg/kg b.w) and high (300\u2009mg/kg b.w) doses of ferulic acid. Metformin was used as the antidiabetic drug. Rats were humanely euthanized after 5\u00a0weeks of treatment, and their blood and hearts were collected. Induction of T2D depleted the levels of reduced glutathione, glycogen, and HDL-cholesterol and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ENTPDase, and 5'nucleotidase. It simultaneously triggered increase in the levels of malondialdehyde, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, creatinine kinase-MB as well as activities of acetylcholinesterase, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ATPase, glucose-6-phopsphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphophatase, glycogen phosphorylase, and lipase. T2D induction further revealed an obvious degeneration of cardiac muscle morphology. However, treatment with ferulic acid markedly reversed the levels and activities of these biomarkers with concomitant improvement in myocardium structural morphology, which had favorable comparison with the standard drug, metformin. Additionally, T2D induction led to the depletion of 40%, 75%, and 33% of fatty acids, fatty esters, and steroids, respectively, with concomitant generation of eicosenoic acid, gamolenic acid, and vitamin E.

{"title": "One-Week Dynamic Changes in Cardiac Proteomes After Cardiac Radioablation in Experimental Rat Model.", "abstract": "Recently, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has been adopted to non-invasively treat catheter ablation-refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). VT episodes have been dramatically reduced after SABR, within weeks; however the underlying mechanisms of these clinical effects and potential mediators of early anti-arrhythmic effect remain unclear.\nIn this study, cardiac tissue was harvested from non-irradiated control (0 Gy), conventional irradiated control (2 Gy), and radioablative test (25 Gy) rat groups after 3 and 7 days of irradiation. The samples were proteomically analyzed to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEP) between different groups. Validation experiments were performed similar to validation in profiling where Data independent acquisition and parallel reaction monitoring methods were used. Data are available \nFunctional enrichment analysis of 25 Gy sample showed that among the downregulated proteins, \"intracellular signal transduction\" and \"cell to cell adhesion\" proteins were significantly affected at day 3 while \"Ras protein signal transduction,\" \"GTPase regulation,\" and \"actin filament-based process\" proteins were majorly affected at day 7. GO analysis demonstrated that most of the upregulated proteins belonged to the classes \"cellular stress response,\" \"endomembranal organization,\" or \"endoplasmic reticulum stress response\" at day 3. At day 7, 42 proteins, mainly associated with response to drug, organic substance, or radiation, were specifically upregulated in 25 Gy. DEP analysis of cardiac conduction showed Ryr2 and Cav1 upregulation and Cacna2d2, Gja3, Scnb2, and Kcnn3 downregulation in the 25 Gy group compared to 0 Gy. In validation experiments, four proteins (Gsta1, Myot, Ephx1, and Capg) were repeatedly detected with 25 Gy-specific patterns at day 7.\n25 Gy single fractional irradiation induces considerable cardiac proteome changes within the first 7 days, distinct from 2 Gy. Several candidate proteins displayed 25 Gy-specific changes and were related to oxidative stress-induced innate response or cardiac remodeling processes.

Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) serve vital roles in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis. The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-146a-5p in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that miR-146a-5p expression was downregulated in ISO-treated rat heart tissue and ISO-induced cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Conversely, the expression levels of basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), collagen I and smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (\u03b1-SMA) were upregulated in ISO-treated rat cardiac tissue and CFs. Furthermore, viability and differentiation were inhibited in ISO-induced CFs transfected with miR-146a-5p mimics. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-146a-5p targeted FGF2. Notably, FGF2 expression was suppressed following overexpression of miR-146a-5p, while FGF2 expression increased following miR-146a-5p knockdown. In addition, FGF2 knockdown suppressed the expression levels of FGF2, collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels in CFs.

{"title": "A Comparative Modeling Study of Thermal Mitigation Strategies in Irreversible Electroporation Treatments.", "abstract": "Irreversible electroporation (IRE), also referred to as nonthermal pulsed field ablation (PFA), is an attractive focal ablation modality for solid tumors and cardiac tissue due to its ability to destroy aberrant cells with limited disruption of the underlying tissue architecture. Despite its nonthermal cell death mechanism, application of electrical energy results in Joule heating that, if ignored, can cause undesired thermal injury. Engineered thermal mitigation (TM) technologies including phase change materials (PCMs) and active cooling (AC) have been reported and tested as a potential means to limit thermal damage. However, several variables affect TM performance including the pulsing paradigm, electrode geometry, PCM composition, and chosen active cooling parameters, meaning direct comparisons between approaches are lacking. In this study, we developed a computational model of conventional bipolar and monopolar probes with solid, PCM-filled, or actively cooled cores to simulate clinical IRE treatments in pancreatic tissue. This approach reveals that probes with integrated PCM cores can be tuned to drastically limit thermal damage compared to existing solid probes. Furthermore, actively cooled probes provide additional control over thermal effects within the probe vicinity and can altogether abrogate thermal damage. In practice, such differences in performance must be weighed against the increased time, expense, and effort required for modified probes compared to existing solid probes.", "journal": "Journal of heat transfer", "date": "2022-07-15", "authors": ["Kenneth NAycock", "Sabrina NCampelo", "Rafael VDavalos"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4053199\n10.1148/radiol.2020192190\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2019.01.012\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2012.02.007\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071813-104622\n10.3389/fonc.2020.01235\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2021.107871\n10.1177/153303460700600407\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018831\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166987\n10.1007/s00270-014-0988-9\n10.1111/jce.13484\n10.1016/j.jvir.2012.09.012\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000001441\n10.1007/s10439-005-8981-8\n10.1186/1475-925X-10-34\n10.1109/TBME.2021.3075772\n10.1371/journal.pone.0076260\n10.1080/02656736.2020.1753828\n10.1080/00365521.2017.1346705\n10.1002/bjs.9536\n10.1016/j.jvir.2016.06.001\n10.1093/europace/euaa280\n10.1080/02656736.2019.1657187\n10.1080/02656736.2019.1646928\n10.1115/1.4038791\n10.1080/02656736.2018.1539253\n10.1038/s41467-019-08782-1\n10.1038/s41598-019-53974-w\n10.1080/02656736.2018.1473893\n10.1063/1.4747332\n10.1115/1.4025334\n10.1063/5.0019743\n10.1371/journal.pone.0103083\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2008.04.046\n10.3390/s21124236\n10.1115/1.3138423\n10.1109/TBME.2020.3013572\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.02.082\n10.13099/VIP21000-04-0.itis.swiss/database\n10.1115/IHTC14-23018\n10.1016/j.gii.2014.02.002\n10.1007/s10439-020-02524-x\n10.1038/s41598-017-12227-4\n10.5152/dir.2017.16276\n10.1002/pros.22760\n10.1063/1.5005828\n10.23736/S0393-2249.19.03365-4\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.044\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.08.026\n10.1016/S1359-4311(02)00192-8\n10.1016/j.jvir.2019.05.009\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104870"}

{"title": "Genetic characterization of Toxoplasma gondii in meat-producing animals in Iran.", "abstract": "The consumption of uncooked or undercooked food from infected intermediate hosts can result in Toxoplasma gondii infection in humans. However, few studies have investigated the genetic diversity of this protozoan parasite in Iran. The aim of the present study was to genetically characterize isolates of T. gondii from intermediate host animals in Mazandaran Province, Iran.\nBlood and heart tissue samples were collected from 204 ruminants, and brain tissue was collected from 335 birds. The prevalence of T. gondii infection in these samples was determined serologically using the modified agglutination test and by conventional PCR assays. Those PCR samples positive for T. gondii DNA and 13 DNA samples extracted from aborted fetuses in a previous study were genotyped with 12 genetic markers using the multilocus-nested PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (Mn-PCR-RFLP) technique.\nAntibodies for parasites were found in 35.7% of the ruminant (39.1% of sheep and 26.4% of goats) samples and in 51.3% of the bird (100% of geese, 52.3% of free-range chickens and 46% of ducks) samples. Molecular detection by PCR of the repetitive 529-bp DNA fragment revealed contamination of 13.2% of ruminant (14.6% of sheep and 9.4% of goats) samples and of 9.6% of bird (11.1% of chickens, 5.7% of ducks and 0% of geese samples). The results from 30 DNA samples revealed five ToxoDB (genome database for the genus Toxoplasma) PCR-RFLP genotypes, including #1 (Type II), #2 (Type III), #10 (Type I), #27 and #48, with genotype #1 the most predominant.\nAs evidenced by the results of this study, ruminants and birds are infected with T. gondii in the region, suggesting that they are likely to be involved in the transmission of T. gondii to humans through meat consumption. The identification of different genotypes may suggest a higher genetic diversity of this parasite in Mazandaran, reflecting local environmental contamination.

Fenofibrate, which is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1, has been used primarily in hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Recent studies found that fenofibrate could alleviate energy metabolism and inflammation caused by cardiac damage during sepsis, and thus it had been paid great attention. This study was to investigate the possible protective roles of fenofibrate against cardiac damage in septic BALB/c mice. Methods: Forty male BALB/c mice aged 8 weeks old were divided randomly into four groups: control group; fenofibrate group; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) group; and fenofibrate + CLP group. After administering fenofibrate or saline for 2 weeks, CLP was performed. Cardiac tissue and plasma were obtained 48 hours later. Plasma Troponin-T (Tnt), ATP, ADP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined. PPAR\u03b1 and 53 protein levels were detected using western blotting. IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) were also assayed. We found that fenofibrate decreased plasma cTnT, ROS and increased the ratio of ATP/ADP. The elevations of IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and P53 induced by sepsis were significantly suppressed by fenofibrate.

{"title": "Protective effect of green synthesized Selenium Nanoparticles against Doxorubicin induced multiple adverse effects in Swiss albino mice.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used drug against multiple cancers. However, its clinical Use is often restricted due to multiple adverse effects. Recently, Selenium Nanoparticles (SeNPs) are gaining attention due to their low toxicity and higher biocompatibility, making them attractive nanoparticles (NPs) in medical and pharmaceutical sciences. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess if our biosynthesized SeNP from the endophytic fungus Fusarium oxysporum conjugated with DOX could alleviate the DOX-induced adverse effects.\nFor this purpose, we investigated various genotoxic, biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical parameters and finally analyzed the metabolite profile by LC-MS/MS.\nWe observed that DOX causes an increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS), 8-OHdG, and malondialdehyde (MDA), decreases antioxidant defense systems and reduces BCL-2 expression in cardiac tissue. In addition, a significant increase in DNA damage and alteration in the cytoarchitecture of the liver, kidney, and heart tissues was observed by Comet Tail Length and histopathological studies, respectively. Interestingly, the DOX-SeNP conjugate reduced ROS/RNS, 8-OHdG, and MDA levels in the liver, kidney, and heart tissues. It also restored the antioxidant enzymes and cytoarchitectures of the examined tissues, reduced genotoxicity, and increased the BCL-2 levels. Finally, metabolic profiling showed that DOX reduced the number of cardioprotective metabolites, which DOX-SeNP restored.\nCollectively, the present results describe the protective effect of DOX-conjugated SeNP against DOX-induced toxicities.

Baicalin (BA) is a flavonoid, extracted from the medicinal plant Scutellariae baicalensis Georgi. BA is well known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Our study investigated the potential effect of BA in attenuating Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. To this end, male Swiss albino mice were given BA (100 mg/kg/d, orally) for 4 wk and were challenged with Dox (six intraperitoneal doses, each 2.5 mg/kg, every other day with a final cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg). Serum activities of cardiac biomarkers (cardiac troponin-I, creatine kinase-membrane bound, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase) were assessed along with the histopathological examination of the heart tissues. Gene expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction.

{"title": "Isolating Nuclei From Frozen Human Heart Tissue for Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing.", "abstract": "Heart disease is the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. This is in part because, despite an abundance of animal and in vitro models, it has been a challenge to date to study human heart tissue with sufficient depth and resolution to develop disease-modifying therapies for common cardiac conditions. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool capable of analyzing cellular function and signaling in health and disease, and has already contributed to significant advances in areas such as oncology and hematology. Employing snRNA-seq technology on flash-frozen human tissue has the potential to unlock novel disease mechanisms and pathways in any organ. Studying the human heart using snRNA-seq is a key priority for the field of cardiovascular sciences; however, progress to date has been slowed by numerous barriers. One key challenge is the fact that the human heart is very resistant to shearing and stress, making tissue dissociation and nuclear isolation difficult. Here, we describe a tissue dissociation method allowing the efficient and cost-effective isolation of high-quality nuclei from flash-frozen human heart tissue collected in surgical operating rooms. Our protocol addresses the challenge of nuclear isolation from human hearts, enables snRNA-seq of the human heart, and paves the way for an improved understanding of the human heart in health and disease. Ultimately, this will be key to uncovering signaling pathways and networks amenable to therapeutic intervention and the development of novel biomarkers and disease-modifying therapies. \u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The main purpose of this study is to assess the cardiopreventive effects of BeG (50\u2009mg/kg) in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MI in Wistar rats. The increased infarct size after ISO induction was reduced simultaneously on treatment with BeG. Similarly, augmented levels of cardiac biomarkers, namely cardiac troponin T, creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin I, and CK-MB were also suppressed by BeG. The increased rate of lipid hydroperoxides\u00a0and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances owing\u00a0to the oxidative stress caused by free radical generation in ISO-induced\u00a0rats were also inhibited by BeG.

{"title": "Electroconductive Photo-Curable PEGDA-Gelatin/PEDOT:PSS Hydrogels for Prospective Cardiac Tissue Engineering Application.", "abstract": "Electroconductive hydrogels (ECHs) have attracted interest for tissue engineering applications due to their ability to promote the regeneration of electroactive tissues. Hence, ECHs with tunable electrical and mechanical properties, bioactivity, biocompatibility and biodegradability are demanded. In this work, ECHs based on photo-crosslinked blends of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and gelatin with different PEGDA:gelatin ratios (1:1, 1.5:1 and 2:1 wt./wt.), and containing poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (0.0, 0.1, 0,3 and 0.5% w/v%) were prepared. Main novelty was the use of gelatin as bioactive component and co-initiator in the photo-crosslinking process, leading to its successful incorporation in the hydrogel network. Physical properties could be modulated by the initial PEGDA:gelatin weight ratio.

{"title": "Analysis of Time Series Gene Expression and DNA Methylation Reveals the Molecular Features of Myocardial Infarction Progression.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, and the changes at the molecular level after MI and the DNA methylation features are not clear. Understanding the molecular characteristics of the early stages of MI is of significance for the treatment of the disease. In this study, RNA-seq and MeDIP-seq were performed on heart tissue from mouse models at multiple time points (0 h, 10 min, 1, 6, 24, and 72 h) to explore genetic and epigenetic features that influence MI progression. Analysis based on a single point in time, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) increased with the time of myocardial infarction, using 0 h as a control group. Moreover, within 10 min of MI onset, the cells are mainly in immune response, and as the duration of MI increases, apoptosis begins to occur. Analysis based on time series data, the expression of 1012 genes was specifically downregulated, and these genes were associated with energy metabolism. The expression of 5806 genes was specifically upregulated, and these genes were associated with immune regulation, inflammation and apoptosis. Fourteen transcription factors were identified in the genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation, which may be potential drug targets. Analysis based on MeDIP-seq combined with RNA-seq methodology, focused on methylation at the promoter region. GO revealed that the downregulated genes with hypermethylation at 72 h were enriched in biological processes such as cardiac muscle contraction. In addition, the upregulated genes with hypomethylation at 72 h were enriched in biological processes, such as cell-cell adhesion, regulation of the apoptotic signaling pathway and regulation of angiogenesis. Among these genes, the Tnni3 gene was also present in the downregulated model. Hypermethylation of Tnni3 at 72 h after MI may be an important cause of exacerbation of MI.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-07-12", "authors": ["YuruHan", "BaoyuDuan", "JingWu", "YanjunZheng", "YinchenGu", "XiaomengCai", "ChanglianLu", "XuboWu", "YanfeiLi", "XuefengGu"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2022.912454\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.1126/science.1230719\n10.1253/circj.70.222\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.08.037\n10.1136/bmj.d8059\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61237-4\n10.1517/14728220903099668\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.1016/j.micinf.2012.10.012\n10.1007/s00109-014-1176-8\n10.1186/s12938-019-0625-6\n10.1038/srep43485\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.039357\n10.12669/pjms.36.3.1406\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00118\n10.14806/ej.17.1.200\n10.1038/nmeth.3317\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt656\n10.3389/fgene.2021.798612\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1186/1471-2105-7-191\n10.1038/nmeth.1923\n10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt650\n10.1038/nrg2847\n10.1038/npp.2012.112\n10.1177/2047487316663873\n10.2147/VHRM.S166157\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.023937\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.09.006\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1159/000488230\n10.1093/cvr/cvz165\n10.1159/000357662\n10.1053/euhj.1999.1874\n10.1002/jcb.25605\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312497\n10.1155/2015/503692\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2010.01.006\n10.1038/s41467-021-24215-4\n10.3389/fonc.2013.00269\n10.1002/gcc.21943\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.04.139\n10.21037/jtd.2016.11.19\n10.26355/eurrev_202006_21688\n10.4103/0366-6999.245271\n10.1016/S0022-5223(96)70279-9\n10.1016/S1054-8807(02)00188-6\n10.1016/S0736-4679(02)00463-8"}

Accidental ingestion is the putative worst hazard scenario associated with mouthwash use; therefore, here we investigated the safety of MA-T ingestion in mice. Mice were provided drinking water containing 0-3000\u00a0\u03bcg/ml MA-T for 7 days followed by non-spiked drinking water for an additional 14 days. At day 7, mice ingesting 1000 or 3000\u00a0\u03bcg/ml MA-T showed significantly decreased body weight and significantly increased liver, kidney, and heart tissue injury biomarkers compared with control. However, at 14 days after stopping MA-T ingestion, body weight and tissue injury biomarkers had returned to normal. Histological analysis revealed that MA-T-induced injuries in liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, duodenum, colon, and rectum had also recovered at 14 days after stopping MA-T ingestion; however, mild vascular endothelial injuries remained in heart, jejunum, and ileum in the worst-case scenario.

For this purpose, forty 24-week-old male SPF SHR rats were selected as the experimental group, and 10 age and sex-matched Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were selected as the control group. Cardiac tissues were collected for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemical staining. Following tail vein injection of recombinant lentiviral vectors, the experimental groups were constructed as the control group (SHR rats without any treatment), Empty vector group (Empty Vector transfection), shRNA negative control (NC) group (LV-shRNA-NRG-4 NC transfection to silence the expression of NRG-4), shRNA group (LV-shRNA-NRG-4 transfection), pcDNA3.1(-) NC group (pcDNA3.1(-)-NRG-4 empty vector transfection) and pcDNA3.1(-) group (pcDNA3.1(-)-NRG-4 transfection to overexpress NRG-4). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels In addition, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay and flow cytometry were performed to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, respectively. Results showed that in the SHR group, the cardiomyocytes showed hypertrophy, disordered arrangement, hyperchromatic nucleus, irregular shape, obvious rupture of myocardial fibers, and obvious proliferation of fibrous stroma; obvious myocardial fibrosis, and there were more blue collagen fibers around cardiomyocytes and myocardial arterioles; cardiomyocytes were swollen, muscle fibers arranged disorderly, collagen around the coronary artery and myocardial interstitium increased significantly with a cross-linking appearance; besides, compared with WKY group, the apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes in SHR group was significantly increased (P<0.05). The expression of NRG-4 protein was decreased in the SHR group compared with the WKY group (P<0.05). In vitro, there was no difference in the mRNA expression of NRG-4, ErbB2 and ErbB4, MMP2, TGF\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA, as well as Caspase3, Bax and Bcl-2 among the control group, Empty vector group, shRNA NC group and pcDNA3.1(-) NC group (P>0.05). While shRNA group showed decreased expressions of NRG-4, ErbB2, ErbB4, MMP2, TGF\u03b21, \u03b1-SMA and Bcl-2, while increased Caspase3 and Bax expressions, as well as promoted cell proliferation and cell apoptosis when compared with the shRNA NC group (P<0.05); while compared with pcDNA3.1(-) NC group, pcDNA3.1(-) group had highly increased expressions of NRG-4, ErbB2, ErbB4, MMP2, TGF\u03b21, \u03b1-SMA and Bcl-2, while decreased Caspase3 and Bax expressions, inhibited cell proliferation and cell apoptosis (all P<0.05).

For this purpose, SPF male SD rats were used for IRI modeling. Experimental animals were subjected to specimen sampling and myocardial HE staining. The relative expression of miR-145-5p was detected by qRT-PCR; the protein expressions of GIGYF1, p-AKT, p53, Bax, p38MAPK, and ERK1/2 were detected by Western blot. Mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes H9C2 were used for H/R modeling, which was then subjected to cell transfection according to different grouping protocols. The target of miR-145-5p was confirmed to be GIGYF1 by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Further experiments were performed to detect the survival rate of transfected cells, the apoptosis of transfected cells, SOD activity determination, as well as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 concentrations. The results showed that the expression level of miR-145-5p was downregulated in H2C2 cells (P < 0.05). After 24h of transfection, there was a significant increase in the expression of miR-145-5p in the H/R+miR-145-5p mimic group (P < 0.05), but an evident decrease in the H/R+miR-145-5p inhibitor group (P > 0.05). Compared with the H/R+NC inhibitor group, the H/R+miR-145-5p mimic group had significantly increased cell proliferation, improved release of SOD, and upregulated expressions of ERK1/2 and p-AKT; but downregulated concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and decreased expressions of P38MAPK, p53, and Bax (all P < 0.05). Also, the IRI+miR-145-5p agomir group had significantly upregulated expression of miR-145-5p and improved injury degree of heart tissue improved; a significant increase in the protein expressions ERK1/2 and p-AKT, but downregulated protein expressions of P38MAPK, p53, and Bax (all P < 0.05). Dual-luciferase reporter assay identified that GIGYF1 was the target gene of miR-145-5p. Furthermore, through the stimulated overexpression of miR-145-5p, there were significantly increased cell proliferation, improved release of SOD, and upregulated expressions of ERK1/2 and p-AKT; but downregulated concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and decreased expressions of P38MAPK, p53, and Bax (all P < 0.05), while the above trends were reversed following the simultaneous upregulation of miR-145-5p and GIGYF1 (all P < 0.05). In general, our study confirmed a decreased expression of miR-145-5p and increased expression of GIGYF1 in the IRI or H/R model in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of miR-145-5p can downregulate the expression of GIGYF1, further promote cell proliferation, inhibit cell apoptosis, alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress, and hence exert a protective role in myocardial infarction IRI.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)", "date": "2022-07-10", "authors": ["ChangzaiLiang", "ShenWang", "LijingZhao", "YaleiHan", "MengZhang"], "doi": "10.14715/cmb/2022.68.1.19"}

L-arginine coated with chitosan nanoparticles was given to L-ACN groups via gavage at 500\u00a0mg/kg/day. SE groups performed a swimming exercise program 5 days per week for 6 weeks. The exercise program started with 20\u00a0min, gradually increasing to 60\u00a0min after four sessions, which was then constant until the completion of the training period. After the protocol completion, the rats were sacrificed, and the heart was fixed and frozen to carry out histological, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and gene expression analyses. The expression of HAND2 protein, HAND2 mRNA, and TBX5 mRNA of the heart tissue was significantly higher in the young group than in all older groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The old\u2009+\u2009L-ACN, old\u2009+\u2009SE, and old\u2009+\u2009L-ACN\u2009+\u2009SE groups showed a significant increase in these factors compared to the old group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Nano-L-arginine supplement, along with swimming exercises, seems to have cardioprotective potential and improve cardiac function in old age by strengthening cardiomyocyte signaling, especially HAND2 and TBX5.

Whether activated B cells participate in the development and progression of hyperthyroid heart disease, and what induces B cells activation in hyperthyroidism are unknown. The present study aimed to determine the roles of BAFF overexpression induced by high concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3) in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroid heart disease. Female C57BL/6J mice were subcutaneously injected with T3 for 6\u2009weeks, and BAFF expression was inhibited using shRNA. Protein and mRNA expression of BAFF in mouse heart tissues evaluated via immunohistochemistry, western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Proportions of B cells in mouse cardiac tissue lymphocytes were quantified via flow cytometry. Morphology and left ventricle function were assessed using pathological sections and echocardiography, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that compared with the control group, the proportion of myocardial B cells was larger in the T3 group; immunohistochemistry, western blotting and PCR analyses revealed increased protein and mRNA expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and BAFF in heart tissues of the T3 group. Compared with the normal controls group, in the T3 group, the diameter of myocardial cells and some echocardiographic values significantly increased and hypertrophy and structural disorder were noticeable. Our results revealed that elevated levels of circulating T3 can promote the expression of BAFF in myocardial cells and can lead to B-cell activation, an elevated inflammatory response and ventricular remodelling.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2022-07-10", "authors": ["Guo-QingLi", "Xiao-MeiLiu", "Bing-LiLiu", "YiZhong", "Qing-WeiGu", "Jing-JingMiao", "JieWang", "ShuLiu", "Xiao-MingMao"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.17470"}

However, specific markers for the isolation and analysis of cardiac EVs are missing, imposing limitation on understanding their function in heart tissue. For this, we performed multiple proteomic approaches to compare EVs isolated from neonate rat cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts by ultracentrifugation, as well as EVs isolated from minced cardiac tissue and plasma by EVtrap. We identified Ldb3, a cytoskeletal protein which is essential in maintaining Z-disc structural integrity, as enriched in cardiac EVs. This result was validated using different EV isolation techniques showing Ldb3 in both large and small EVs. In parallel, we showed that Ldb3 is almost exclusively detected in the neonate rat heart when compared to other tissues, and specifically in cardiomyocytes compared to cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, Ldb3 levels, specifically higher molecular weight isoforms, were decreased in the left ventricle of ischemic heart failure patients compared to control groups, but not in the corresponding EVs.

{"title": "Effect of Fraxetin on Oxidative Damage Caused by Isoproterenol-Induced Myocardial Infarction in Rats.", "abstract": "At present, cardiovascular disorders are the most prominent factors for the high morbidity rate globally. The occurrence of myocardial infarction followed by myocardial ischemia is the important cause of high death rates. Various medical treatments are available, yet the mortality and morbidity rate is high. In the present investigation, the cardioprotective property of fraxetin (Fx) is evaluated in myocardial infarction-induced experimental rats. Fraxetin, a phytochemical known as coumarin isolated from Fraxinus rhynchophylla. Fraxetin has numerous pharmacological activities including antioxidant, apoptosis inhibitor, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial agent. The experimental mice were split into 4 groups each comprising six animals. Group I was considered the control group; 0.1% NaCl solution was given as dosage. Group II received only Fx; group III was treated with ISO. Group IV was treated with Fx followed by ISO to induce myocardial infarction. In ISO administrated rats, there were changes in the heart weight, activities of cardiac markers, transmembrane protein activity, antioxidant enzymes, pro-inflammatory proteins, lipid profile, and myocardial structures. Pre-treatment of fraxetin in group IV experimental rats resulted in decreased cardiac weight, diminished level of cardiac markers (cardiac troponin T (cTnT), creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI)), reduced level of oxidative stress biomarkers (LOOH and TBARS) in the plasma and cardiac tissue, amplified level of enzymes in antioxidant defense system (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) in the plasma and heart tissue, and elevated level of ATPase activities. The histopathological studies also revealed the potent activity of fraxetin in protecting the cardiac tissues from inflammation and damage. ISO-administrated experimental rats treated with fraxetin exhibit increased antioxidants activity and decreased free radicals. Our study revealed that the administration of fraxetin significantly reduced the extent of myocardial damage during myocardial infarction in rats caused by isoproterenol.

However, the function of SIRT6 in the process of cardiac pathogenesis caused by obesity-associated lipotoxicity remains to be unveiled. This study was designed to elucidate the role of SIRT6 in the pathogenesis of cardiac injury due to nutrition overload-induced obesity and explore the downstream signaling pathways affecting oxidative stress in the heart. In this study, we used Sirt6 cardiac-specific knockout murine models treated with a high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to explore the function and mechanism of SIRT6 in the heart tissue during HFD-induced obesity. We also took advantage of neonatal cardiomyocytes to study the role and downstream molecules of SIRT6 during HFD-induced injury in vitro, in which intracellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial content were assessed. We observed that during HFD-induced obesity, Sirt6 loss-of-function aggravated cardiac injury including left ventricular hypertrophy and lipid accumulation. Our results evidenced that upon increased fatty acid uptake, SIRT6 positively regulated the expression of endonuclease G (ENDOG), which is a mitochondrial-resident molecule that plays an\u00a0important role in mitochondrial biogenesis and redox homeostasis. Our results also showed that SIRT6 positively regulated superoxide dismutase 2\u00a0(SOD2) expression post-transcriptionally via ENDOG.

{"title": "A Nutraceutical Product Based on a Mixture of Algae and Extra Virgin Olive Oils and Olive Leaf Extract Attenuates Sepsis-Induced Cardiovascular and Muscle Alterations in Rats.", "abstract": "Nutraceuticals are products of natural origin widely used for the treatment and/or prevention of some chronic diseases that are highly prevalent in Western countries, such as obesity or type II diabetes, among others. However, its possible use in the prevention of acute diseases that can put life at risk has been poorly studied. Sepsis is an acute condition that causes cardiovascular and skeletal muscle damage due to a systemic inflammatory state. The aim of this work was to evaluate the possible beneficial effect of a new nutraceutical based on a mixture of algae oil (AO) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) supplemented with an olive leaf extract (OLE) in the prevention of cardiovascular alterations and skeletal muscle disorders induced by sepsis in rats. For this purpose, male Wistar rats were treated with the nutraceutical or with water p.o. for 3 weeks and after the treatment they were injected with 1mg/kg LPS twice (12 and 4 h before sacrifice). Pretreatment with the nutraceutical prevented the LPS-induced decrease in cardiac contractility before and after the hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. At the vascular level, supplementation with the nutraceutical did not prevent hypotension in septic animals, but it attenuated endothelial dysfunction and the increased response of aortic rings to the vasoconstrictors norepinephrine and angiotensin-II induced by LPS. The beneficial effects on cardiovascular function were associated with an increased expression of the antioxidant enzymes SOD-1 and GSR in cardiac tissue and SOD-1 and Alox-5 in arterial tissue. In skeletal muscle, nutraceutical pretreatment prevented LPS-induced muscle proteolysis and autophagy and significantly increased protein synthesis as demonstrated by decreased expression of MURF-1, atrogin-1, LC3b and increased MCH-I and MCH -IIa in gastrocnemius muscle.

However, cardiomyocytes are crucial cell types that are considered hard-to-transfect. The entrapment of nucleic acids in non-viral vectors, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), is an attractive approach for safe and effective delivery.\nHere, a mini-library of engineered LNPs was developed for pDNA delivery in cardiomyocytes. LNPs were characterized and screened for pDNA delivery in cardiomyocytes and identified a lead LNP formulation with enhanced transfection efficiency.\nBy varying lipid molar ratios, the LNP formulation was optimized to deliver pDNA in cardiomyocytes with enhanced gene expression in vitro and in vivo, with negligible toxicity. In vitro, our lead LNP was able to reach a gene expression greater than 80%. The in vivo treatment with lead LNPs induced a twofold increase in GFP expression in heart tissue compared to control. In addition, levels of circulating myeloid cells and inflammatory cytokines remained without significant changes in the heart after LNP treatment. It was also demonstrated that cardiac cell function was not affected after LNP treatment.\nCollectively, our results highlight the potential of LNPs as an efficient delivery vector for pDNA to cardiomyocytes.

Antibodies against GAS M proteins cross-react with host tissue proteins in the heart and brain leading to the symptomatology observed in ARF/RHD. As throat carriage of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis (SDSE) has been reported to be relatively high in some ARF/RHD endemic regions compared with GAS, and both SDSE and GAS express coiled-coil surface protein called M protein, we hypothesized that streptococci other than GAS can also associated with ARF/RHD and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Neurobehavioral assessments and electrocardiography were performed on Lewis rats before and after exposure to recombinant GAS and SDSE M proteins. Histological assessments were performed to confirm inflammatory changes in cardiac and neuronal tissues. ELISA and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the cross-reactivity of antibodies with host connective, cardiac and neuronal tissue proteins. Lewis rats injected with M proteins either from GAS or SDSE developed significant cardiac functional and neurobehavioral abnormalities in comparison to control rats injected with phosphate-buffered saline.

However, the accompanying myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) would aggravate myocardial damage. Previous studies have confirmed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is closely correlated to kidney and intestinal IRI. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between AhR and myocardial IRI.\nAn oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model of H9c2 cells and an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model of Sprague-Dawley rat myocardium were established. OGD/R cells and myocardial IRI rats were treated with different concentrations of the AhR antagonist CH-223191 or agonist 6-formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ). Under the conditions of normoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation, the activity of cardiomyocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and cell reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected. In rats, myocardial pathological damage and markers of myocardial injury were detected.\nAccording to the results of the cell viability, LDH and ROS tests in vitro, both CH-223191 and FICZ showed no myocardial protection under OGD/R conditions. However, the histological staining and analysis of myocardial injury marker LDH in vitro revealed that CH-223191 could significantly reduce the myocardial IRI.\nAhR exhibited a different effect on myocardial IRI in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, CH-223191 could significantly alleviate the myocardial IRI, suggesting that inhibition of AhR may play a role in myocardial protection, and AhR may serve as a potential treatment target for myocardial IRI.", "journal": "Current medical science", "date": "2022-07-06", "authors": ["Jin-XuWang", "Bei-BeiWang", "Shu-ZhangYuan", "KeXue", "Jin-ShengZhang", "Ai-JunXu"], "doi": "10.1007/s11596-022-2601-9\n10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.116.003480\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.012\n10.1007/s00395-019-0773-7\n10.1016/j.abb.2004.04.021\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03054.x\n10.1016/j.bmcl.2020.126959\n10.1007/s00428-002-0659-0\n10.4062/biomolther.2016.066\n10.1111/jphp.12484\n10.1385/CT:2:4:263\n10.1385/CT:3:2:153\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs211\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.08.012\n10.1016/j.bja.2019.08.026\n10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00310-X\n10.1016/j.neulet.2017.04.011\n10.1155/2014/520763\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.11.017\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00033-9\n10.1007/s10456-020-09720-2\n10.1016/j.apsb.2020.03.004\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.09.013\n10.1124/mol.105.021832\n10.1152/ajpregu.00315.2012\n10.1002/ptr.4637\n10.1590/1414-431X20133036\n10.1080/03602530600632063\n10.1289/ehp.6322\n10.23736/S0392-0488.18.06132-1\n10.1016/j.jflm.2014.09.011\n10.1155/2016/8194690\n10.1007/s11010-005-0551-8\n10.1038/nrm3801\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101777"}
{"title": "Effectiveness of exosome mediated miR-126 and miR-146a delivery on cardiac tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Despite advances in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, due to the non-proliferative nature of adult cardiomyocytes, the injured myocardium is mainly replaced by fibrotic tissue, which ultimately causes heart failure. To prevent heart failure, particularly after myocardial infarction, exosome-based therapy has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to regenerate cardiac function. Exosomes can carry microRNAs in support of neovascularization, anti-inflammatory, and endogenous cardiac regeneration. This study demonstrated that animal rat models' combination treatment with microRNA-126 and microRNA-146a mimics in exosomes is desirable for cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction. The exosomes isolated from stem cells and loaded with microRNAs were characterized their impacts in cell migration, tube formation, and vascular endothelial growth factor degree. In the following, the usefulness of loaded microRNAs in exosomes and their encapsulation within alginate derivative hydrogel was analyzed in myocardial infarction for an animal model. Exosomes isolated and loaded with microRNAs showed the synergetic impact on cell migration, tube formation, and promoted vascular endothelial growth factor folding. Moreover, microRNAs loaded exosomes and encapsulated them in alginate hydrogel could help in reducing infarct size and improving angiogenesis in myocardial infarction. The angiogenesis markers including CD31 and connexion 43 upregulated for myocardial infarction models treated with alginate-based hydrogels loaded with exosomes and microRNAs-exosomes. Histological analysis indicated that myocardial infarction model rats treated with alginate hydrogel loaded with microRNAs-exosomes possessed lower and higher degrees of fibrosis and collagen fiber, respectively.

We observed that IGF1R is overexpressed in cardiac tissues from patients with end-stage non-ischemic heart failure, coupled to the activation of the IGF1R downstream effector AKT/protein kinase B and inhibition of ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1). Transgenic overexpression of human IGF1R in cardiomyocytes from mice initially induces physiological cardiac hypertrophy and superior function, but later in life confers a negative impact on cardiac health, causing macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition as well as impaired oxidative phosphorylation, thus reducing life expectancy. Treatment with the autophagy inducer and caloric restriction mimetic spermidine ameliorates most of these IGF1R-induced cardiotoxic effects in vivo. Moreover, inhibition of IGF1R signaling by means of a dominant-negative phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) mutant induces cardioprotective autophagy, restores myocardial bioenergetics and improves late-life survival. Hence, our results demonstrate that IGF1R exerts a dual biphasic impact on cardiac health, and that autophagy mediates the late-life geroprotective effects of IGF1R inhibition in the heart.", "journal": "Autophagy", "date": "2022-07-06", "authors": ["MahmoudAbdellatif", "FrankMadeo", "GuidoKroemer", "SimonSedej"], "doi": "10.1080/15548627.2022.2095835"}

Cardiac oxidative and nitrative stress are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of HFpEF. Herein, we present a unique three-channel fluorescent probe for evaluating cardiac oxidative and nitrative stress in HFpEF by simultaneous detection of NO and GSH. The probe exhibits a native green fluorescence (probe channel), while the presence of GSH and NO can sensitively turn the native green fluorescence into red fluorescence (GSH channel) and near-infrared fluorescence (NO channel), respectively. The probe clearly reveals that both GSH and NO levels are upregulated in cardiomyocytes and heart tissue with HFpEF. Moreover, it uncovers that the enhancement in NO and GSH levels are closely associated with increased level of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and activation of the Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1)/Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)/ARE (antioxidant response element) signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes, respectively.

The immune response has been reported to be an important process in septic cardiomyopathy and is present in the cardiac tissue of patients with sepsis, suggesting that the immune response may be an underlying mechanism of myocardial injury in SCM. Therefore, we explored the role of immune-related genes (IRGs) in SCM and aimed to identify pivotal immune-related targets with the aim of identifying key immune-related targets in SCM and potential therapeutic mechanisms involved in the pathological process of SCM.

{"title": "Acute Mitral Regurgitation Due to Chordae Tendineae Rupture: A Rare Presentation of Cardiac Amyloidosis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND In cardiac amyloidosis (CA), misfolded proteins deposit in the extracellular space of cardiac tissue. These deposits classically cause restrictive cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction. Although there are at least 30 proteins known to cause amyloid aggregates, 2 main types make up most diagnosed cases: light chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). Since CA is considered a rare condition, it is often underdiagnosed or recognized in the advanced stages. Once amyloid deposits involve the heart tissue, they are associated with a worse outcome and higher mortality rates, especially in patients presenting symptoms of heart failure. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 22-year-old man presenting with acute severe mitral regurgitation, secondary to posterior mitral leaflet chordae tendineae rupture (CTR). Surgical mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis was performed, and cardiac tissue biopsy samples were obtained. After surgery, the patient improved significantly but suddenly presented with hemodynamic deterioration, until he died due to severe hemodynamic compromise and multiorgan failure. Although the etiology of the CTR was not established before surgical intervention, the histopathological analysis suggested CA. CONCLUSIONS CA diagnosis can be complex, especially in a 22-year-old-man with atypical clinical and imaging manifestations. In this patient, other differential diagnoses were considered, since CA presenting in a young patient is a rare phenomenon and acute mitral regurgitation secondary to CTR presents more frequently in other heart conditions. Furthermore, rapid postoperative deterioration resulted in the patient's death before biopsy samples were available because suspicion of amyloidosis had not been raised until that point.", "journal": "The American journal of case reports", "date": "2022-07-06", "authors": ["ReginaAguilar-L\u00f3pez", "Cristopher C\u00e1ndidoS\u00e1nchez-Rodr\u00edguez", "DanielManzur-Sandoval", "Mar\u00edaFlores Calvo", "AlbertoAranda-Fraustro", "AntonioJord\u00e1n-R\u00edos", "AlejandroFrancisco-Cruz", "GustavoRojas-Velasco"], "doi": "10.12659/AJCR.936545"}

It is found that overexpression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a main receptor for bile acids, improves the retention and cardioprotection of adipose tissue-derived MSC (ADSC) administered by intramyocardial injection in mice with myocardial infarction (MI), which shows enhanced antiapoptotic, proangiogenic, and antifibrotic effects. RNA sequencing, LC-MS/MS, and loss-of-function studies reveal that FXR overexpression promotes ADSC paracrine angiogenesis via Angptl4. FXR overexpression improves ADSC survival in vivo but fails in vitro. By performing bile acid-targeted metabolomics using ischemic heart tissue, 19 bile acids are identified. Among them, cholic acid and deoxycholic acid significantly increase Angptl4 secretion from ADSC overexpressing FXR and further improve their proangiogenic capability. Moreover, ADSC overexpressing FXR shows significantly lower apoptosis by upregulating Nqo-1 expression only in the presence of FXR ligands. Retinoid X receptor \u03b1 is identified as a coactivator of FXR. It is first demonstrated that there is a bile acid pool in the myocardial microenvironment.

According to in silico language processing and high throughput raw data analysis, we recognized hub molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic hearts and suggested a new pharmaceutical approach for declining myocardial programed cell death. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were classified into five groups: healthy rats as control, diabetic rats, diabetic combined resistance/endurance training, diabetic rats which consumed supplementation vitamins E and C, and the combined supplementation and training. Here, we calculated changes in gene expression based on artificial intelligence methods and evaluated gene expression in apoptotic influencing combined training and antioxidants vitamins consumption in heart injured models by streptozotocin via Real-Time PCR. Moreover, we assessed the binding affinity of the 3D structure of small molecules on macromolecule SIRT3 to a new compound pharmaceutical suggesting the decline in cell death program. The computational intelligence surveys revealed that the apoptosis process was a remarkable pathomechanism in the abnormality function of heart tissue in diabetic conditions. Furthermore, we showed that synchronizing antioxidant vitamin consumption and regular combined training could significantly decrease irreversible myocardial cell death in diabetic myocardiopathy. Hence, levels of antiapoptotic mRNA were modified in the combined training/vitamin consumption group compared with other classifications. We found that regular combined exercise and vitamin consumption could reverse the apoptosis process to enhance the survival of cardiac muscle cells in diabetes conditions. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Machine learning and system biology indicated that the apoptosis process is a vital pathomechanism of hyperglycemia-induced heart failure. Sirt3/Fas/Bcl-2/Cycs and Bax, as a critical network of apoptosis, play an essential role in heart failure induced by hyperglycemia. Moreover, Type 2 diabetes and obesity increase the risk of heart failure by increasing high blood sugar levels.

Troponin I is a widespread marker in clinical use that possesses almost 100% specificity for myocardial tissue and is used as a highly sensitive marker even in the case of microscopically small lesions of cardiac tissue necrosis.\nTo investigate the association of inflammatory and hemostatic parameters with values of high sensitive troponin I (hsTnI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\nThe prospective study included 82 patients with a clinical condition of acute coronary heart disease (stable angina pectoris 23, acute coronary syndrome 59, of which 35 had non-STEMI elevation infarction and 24 had ST-segment elevation infarction (STEMI). The values of hsTnI had been measured in all patients and correlated with values of inflammatory (c reactive protein-CRP, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) and hemostatic (platelet counts, mean platelet volume-MPV) parameters.\nPatients with acute coronary syndrome had significantly higher values of hsTnI, and inflammatory parameters: CRP, leukocytes and neutrophils (absolute number and percentage) as well as the neutrophil /lymphocyte ratio compared to patients with stable angina pectoris.

Neonates with CHD are more likely to be born prematurely, and a higher proportion of preterm neonates have CHD than their term counterparts. The implications of preterm birth on the cardiac and noncardiac organ systems are vast and require special management considerations. The feasibility of surgical interventions in preterm neonates is frequently limited by patient size and delicacy of immature cardiac tissues. Thus, special care must be taken when considering the appropriate timing and type of cardiac intervention. Despite improvements in neonatal cardiac surgical outcomes, preterm and early term gestational ages and low birthweight remain important risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Understanding the risks of early delivery of neonates with prenatally diagnosed CHD may help guide perioperative management in neonates who are born preterm.

{"title": "UCP2 modulates cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity, acetyl-CoA, and histone acetylation in response to moderate hypoxia.", "abstract": "Developmental cardiac tissue is regenerative while operating under low oxygen. After birth, ambient oxygen is associated with cardiomyocyte cell cycle exit and regeneration. Likewise, cardiac metabolism undergoes a shift with cardiac maturation. Whether there are common regulators of cardiomyocyte cell cycle linking metabolism to oxygen tension remains unknown. The objective of the study is to determine whether mitochondrial UCP2 is a metabolic oxygen sensor regulating cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) under moderate hypoxia showed increased cell cycle activity and UCP2 expression. NRVMs exhibited a metabolic shift toward glycolysis, reducing citrate synthase, mtDNA, mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), and DNA damage/oxidative stress, while loss of UCP2 reversed this phenotype. Next, WT and mice from a global UCP2-KO mouse line (UCP2KO) kept under hypoxia for 4 weeks showed significant decline in cardiac function that was more pronounced in UCP2KO animals. Cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity was reduced, while fibrosis and DNA damage was significantly increased in UCP2KO animals compared with WT under hypoxia. Mechanistically, UCP2 increased acetyl-CoA levels and histone acetylation, and it altered chromatin modifiers linking metabolism to cardiomyocyte cell cycle under hypoxia.

Nanoneedles and high-aspect ratio nanostructures are unconventional but interesting delivery systems, in which delivery is mediated by surface interactions. Herein, nanoneedles are synergistically combined with polysaccharide-polyplex nanofilms and enhanced transfection efficiency is observed, compared to polyplexes in suspension. Different polyplex-polyelectrolyte nanofilm combinations are assessed and it is found that transfection efficiency is enhanced when using polysaccharide-based polyanions, rather than being only specific for hyaluronic acid, as suggested in earlier studies. Moreover, results show that enhanced transfection is not mediated by interactions with the CD44 receptor, previously\u00a0hypothesized as a major mechanism mediating enhancement via hyaluronate. In cardiac tissue, nanoneedles are shown to increase the transfection efficiency of nanofilms compared to flat substrates; while in vitro, high transfection efficiencies are observed in nanostructures where cells present large interfacing areas with the substrate. The results of this study demonstrate that surface-mediated transfection using this system is efficient and safe, requiring amounts of nucleic acid with an order of magnitude lower than standard culture transfection.

In this study, the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice model was successfully established. Moreover, HFD induced a fat mass and cardiac injury in mice. More importantly, wogonin treatment reduced fat mass and improved cardiac function of HFD mice. Consistently, wogonin ameliorated myocardial lipid metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice by reducing triglyceride (TC), total cholesterol (TG), and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels in serum, as well as the TG and free fatty acids (FFA) levels in heart tissues. Interestingly, wogonin treatment alleviated myocardial pyroptosis in HFD-induced obese mice. Through bioinformatic analysis, the IL-17 signaling pathway was predicted to be modulated by wogonin. Results showed that wogonin deactivated the IL-17 signaling pathway in HFD mice.

This study developed a microfluidic-based encapsulation process for biomimetic hydrogel microcapsule fabrication. The hydrogel microcapsule was produced through a coaxial double orifice microfluidic technique and a water-in-oil emulsion system in two sequential processes. The phenol (Ph) substituted Gela (Gela-Ph) and CNT (CNT-Ph), respectively as cell-adhesive and electrically conductive substrates were incorporated in hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel through laccase-mediated crosslinking. The Cardiomyocyte-enclosing microcapsule fabricated and cellular survival, function, and possible difference in the biological activity of encapsulated cells within micro vehicles were investigated. The coaxial microfluidic method and Lac-mediated crosslinking reaction resulted in spherical vehicle production in 183\u2009\u03bcm diameter at 500 capsules/min speed. The encapsulation process did not affect cellular viability and harvested cells from microcapsule proliferated well likewise subcultured cells in tissue culture plate. The biophysical properties of the designed hydrogel, including mechanical strength, swelling, biodegradability and electroconductivity upregulated significantly for hydrogels decorated covalently with Gela-Ph and CNT-Ph. The tendency of the microcapsule for the spheroid formation of cardiomyocytes inside the proposed microcapsule occurred 3\u2009days after encapsulation.

It is the leading reason for death and disability worldwide. This study aimed to search potential biomarkers related to the progression of AMI and identify the related immune-related pathways, as also examine their association with the immune cell infiltration and diagnostic value for AMI.\nDatasets of gene microarray were extracted from (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and AMI-related biomarkers were obtained by differential expression analysis and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses were used to mine AIM-related hub markers. For the assessment of the diagnostic value of these markers for AMI, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. Additionally, the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was performed to determine the immune cell infiltration.\nA total of 1273 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. Nine co-expression modules were obtained after WGCNA. Among them, the brown-colored module was identified as the hub for AMI (correlation [cor]\u00a0=\u00a00.73, P\u00a0=\u00a01.1e-87), and intersected with the DEGs yielded a total of 88 shared genes. Subsequently, five hub genes were obtained from the analysis of the LASSO regression and SVM-RFE algorithm. Ultimately, using the ROC curves, the diagnostic values of these genes for AMI were confirmed. The five hub genes were also found to be significantly associated with the infiltration levels of multiple immune cells. Moreover, the DEGs were mainly enriched in the inflammatory and immune-related gene sets evidenced by the functional enrichment analysis.\nThe five hub genes may serve as potential markers for AMI diagnosis and the findings have implications for further investigations on the molecular mechanisms underlying AMI.", "journal": "Transplant immunology", "date": "2022-06-29", "authors": ["ZhenyuLin", "HaiyanXu", "YuChen", "XiwenZhang", "JingYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.trim.2022.101652"}
{"title": "Induction of P-glycoprotein expression by dandelion in tumor and heart tissues: Impact on the anti-tumor activity and cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin.", "abstract": "Previously, we have investigated the anti-tumor activity and mechanism through which dandelion acts against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, traditional Chinese medicine is mostly accepted as an adjunct therapy during chemotherapy in clinical practice. So far, little is known about the effects of dandelion in conjunction with chemotherapeutic drugs.\nTo investigate the effects of dandelion on the anti-tumor activity and cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), and to further explore the molecular mechanisms through which these effects occur.\nAt the beginning of this study, dandelion was observed to alleviate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and reduce the anti-tumor activity of DOX. Subsequently, we investigated whether the resistance to DOX mediated by P-glycoprotein was involved in the above effects.\nThe cardioprotective effect of dandelion was investigated on DOX-treated mice by histological analysis, myocardial enzyme assays, and an untargeted metabolomics study based on LC-Q-TOF/MS. TNBC cell lines and 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were employed to investigate the combined anti-tumor activity. Laser scanning confocal microscope and a flow cytometry analysis were employed to measure the intracellular accumulation of DOX. A specific, sensitive, and rapid LC-MS/MS method was developed to detect the efflux of DOX from cells. Expression of P-glycoprotein in mouse tumor and heart tissues was detected via Western blotting analysis.\nDandelion was found to significantly alleviate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, as was evidenced by improved cardiomyocyte morphology, decreased LDH and CK-MB release, and adjusted metabolic biomarker levels. However, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that dandelion could reduce the anti-tumor activity of DOX. This counteraction was achieved by activating of the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, thereby promoting the efflux of DOX from cells and reducing the intracellular accumulation of DOX. Moreover, the activation of P-glycoprotein by dandelion in mouse heart tissue was also observed, thus suggesting that the decrease of cardiac DOX accumulation plays an important role in the cardioprotective effect of dandelion.\nDandelion can activate the P-glycoprotein in heart and tumor tissues, which ameliorates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity but attenuates DOX cytotoxicity toward TNBC.

{"title": "Imaging Scheme for 3-D High-Frame-Rate Intracardiac Echography: A Simulation Study.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is normally treated by RF ablation. Intracardiac echography (ICE) is widely employed during RF ablation procedures to guide the electrophysiologist in navigating the ablation catheter, although only 2-D probes are currently clinically used. A 3-D ICE catheter would not only improve visualization of the atrium and ablation catheter, but it might also provide the 3-D mapping of the electromechanical wave (EW) propagation pattern, which represents the mechanical response of cardiac tissue to electrical activity. The detection of this EW needs 3-D high-frame-rate imaging, which is generally only realizable in tradeoff with channel count and image quality. In this simulation-based study, we propose a high volume rate imaging scheme for a 3-D ICE probe design that employs 1-D micro-beamforming in the elevation direction. Such a probe can achieve a high frame rate while reducing the channel count sufficiently for realization in a 10-Fr catheter. To suppress the grating-lobe (GL) artifacts associated with micro-beamforming in the elevation direction, a limited number of fan-shaped beams with a wide azimuthal and narrow elevational opening angle are sequentially steered to insonify slices of the region of interest. An angular weighted averaging of reconstructed subvolumes further reduces the GL artifacts. We optimize the transmit beam divergence and central frequency based on the required image quality for EW imaging (EWI). Numerical simulation results show that a set of seven fan-shaped transmission beams can provide a frame rate of 1000 Hz and a sufficient spatial resolution to visualize the EW propagation on a large 3-D surface.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-06-28", "authors": ["MehdiSoozande", "Boudewine WOssenkoppele", "YannickHopf", "Michiel A PPertijs", "Martin DVerweij", "Nicode Jong", "Hendrik JVos", "Johan GBosch"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3186487"}

{"title": "Loss of Lipocalin 10 Exacerbates Diabetes-Induced Cardiomyopathy ", "abstract": "Metabolic disorders (i.e., hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia) cause increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, leading to gradual loss of cardiac resident macrophage population and increased accumulation of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages in the heart. Such self-perpetuating effect may contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy during diabetes. Recent meta-analysis data reveal that lipocalin 10 (Lcn10) is significantly downregulated in cardiac tissue of patients with heart failure but is increased in the blood of septic patients. However, the functional role of Lcn10 in cardiac inflammation triggered by metabolic disorders has never been investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of Lcn10 in macrophages was significantly decreased under multiple metabolic stress conditions. Furthermore, Lcn10-null macrophages exhibited pro-inflammatory phenotype in response to inflammation stimuli. Next, using a global Lcn10-knockout (KO) mouse model to induce type-2 diabetes (T2D), we observed that loss of Lcn10 promoted more pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration into the heart, compared to controls, leading to aggravated insulin resistance and impaired cardiac function. Similarly, adoptive transfer of Lcn10-KO bone marrow cells into X-ray irradiated mice displayed higher ratio of pro-/anti-inflammatory macrophages in the heart and worsened cardiac function than those mice received wild-type (WT) bone marrows upon T2D conditions. Mechanistically, RNA-sequencing analysis showed that Nr4a1, a nuclear receptor known to have potent anti-inflammatory effects, is involved in Lcn10-mediated macrophage activation. Indeed, we found that nuclear translocation of Nr4a1 was disrupted in Lcn10-KO macrophages upon stimulation with LPS + IFN\u03b3. Accordingly, treatment with Cytosporone B (CsnB), an agonist of Nr4a1, attenuated the pro-inflammatory response in Lcn10-null macrophages and partially improved cardiac function in Lcn10-KO diabetic mice. Together, these findings indicate that loss of Lcn10 skews macrophage polarization to pro-inflammatory phenotype and aggravates cardiac dysfunction during type-2 diabetes through the disruption of Nr4a1-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling pathway in macrophages. Therefore, reduction of Lcn10 expression observed in diabetic macrophages may be responsible for the pathogenesis of diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction. It suggests that Lcn10 might be a potential therapeutic factor for diabetic heart failure.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2022-06-28", "authors": ["QianqianLi", "YutianLi", "WeiHuang", "XiaohongWang", "ZhenlingLiu", "JingChen", "YanboFan", "TianqingPeng", "SakthivelSadayappan", "YigangWang", "Guo-ChangFan"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2022.930397\n10.1016/j.diabet.2018.09.005\n10.1007/s00125-009-1573-7\n10.1038/nrendo.2017.151\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000691\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311586\n10.1253/circj.cj-11-0754\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.11.024\n10.1038/s41569-020-0339-2\n10.1186/s12967-019-1999-8\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01547\n10.1038/s41591-018-0059-x\n10.1038/nri3800\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.013\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001625\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.648539\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00470\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.191163\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.676644\n10.1042/BCJ20190253\n10.1021/ja208199h\n10.1074/jbc.M502606200\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2018.10.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.253377\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.260760\n10.1038/nchembio.1788\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000238346.84458.5d\n10.1016/j.gene.2004.06.027\n10.1038/nature14475\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2015.02.005\n10.3390/genes11010060\n10.1038/s41435-020-00110-8\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa067\n10.3791/50323\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.647070\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.12.001\n10.3390/cells9010120\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2010.05.030\n10.1126/scitranslmed.abe2587\n10.2337/db15-1563\n10.1111/sji.12245\n10.1096/fj.12-222257\n10.1371/journal.pone.0096997\n10.1042/bj3180001\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135846\n10.3727/096368911X603611\n10.1152/ajplung.00409.2000\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.07.065\n10.1073/pnas.2002997117\n10.1016/j.arr.2021.101414\n10.1371/journal.pone.0137924\n10.1096/fj.11-202457\n10.1186/s13073-014-0111-5\n10.1155/2021/6616270\n10.1093/cvr/cvz336\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3001902\n10.1186/1475-2840-8-58\n10.1016/s0167-4838(00)00169-2\n10.1186/s40246-019-0191-9"}

{"title": "MicroRNAs Promote the Progression of Sepsis-Induced Cardiomyopathy and Neurovascular Dysfunction Through Upregulation of NF-kappaB Signaling Pathway-Associated HDAC7/ACTN4.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the NF-kappaB pathway, hub genes, and transcription factors (TFs) in monocytes implicated in the progression of neurovascular-related sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) as well as potential miRNAs with regulatory functions.\n: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy-and heart failure (HF)-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SIC and HF groups were identified separately by differential analysis. In addition, DEGs and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) in monocytes between sepsis and the HC group were identified. Then, common DEGs in SIC, HF, and monocyte groups were identified by intersection analysis. Based on the functional pathways enriched by these DEGs, genes related to the NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK)/NF-kappaB signaling pathway were selected for further intersection analysis to obtain hub genes. These common DEGs, together with sepsis-related DEmiRNAs, were used to construct a molecular interplay network and to identify core TFs in the network.\n: A total of 153 upregulated genes and 25 downregulated genes were obtained from SIC-, HF-, and monocyte-related DEGs. Functional pathway analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were enriched in NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. A total of eight genes associated with NF-\u03baB signaling pathway were then further identified from the 178 DEGs. In combination with sepsis-related DEmiRNAs, HDAC7/ACTN4 was identified as a key transcriptional regulatory pair in the progression of SIC and in monocyte regulation. hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR-3175, and hsa-miR-23b-3p can regulate the progression of SIC through the regulation of HDAC7/ACTN4. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that HDAC7/ACTN4 may be associated with apoptosis in addition to the inflammatory response.\n: hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR-3175, and hsa-miR-23b-3p are involved in SIC progression by regulating NF-\u03baB signaling signaling pathway-related HDAC7/ACTN4 in monocytes and cardiac tissue cells.

{"title": "Bicyclol Attenuates Obesity-Induced Cardiomyopathy via Inhibiting NF-\u03baB and MAPK Signaling Pathways.", "abstract": "Schisandra is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine in East Asia. As a traditional Chinese medicine derivative with Schisandra chinensis as raw material, bicyclol is well known for its significant anti-inflammatory effect. Chronic inflammation plays a significant part in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. Our purpose was to explore the effect and mechanism of bicyclol on obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.\nMice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) and cardiomyocytes stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) were used as models of obesity-related cardiomyopathy in vivo and in vitro, respectively. The therapeutic effect of bicyclol on pathological changes such as myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis was evaluated by staining cardiac tissue sections. PCR was used to detect inflammatory factors in H9c2 cells and animal heart tissue after bicyclol treatment. Then, we used western blotting to detect the expression levels of the myocardial hypertrophy related protein, myocardial fibrosis related protein, NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways.\nOur results indicated that bicyclol treatment significantly alleviates HFD-induced myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways. Similar to animal level results, bicyclol could significantly inhibit PA-induced inflammation and prevent NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways from being activated.\nOur results showed that bicyclol has potential as a drug to treat obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular drugs and therapy", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["YanghaoChen", "WanteLin", "LingfengZhong", "ZiminFang", "BozhiYe", "ZheWang", "NiponChattipakorn", "WeijianHuang", "GuangLiang", "GaojunWu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10557-022-07356-6\n10.1038/nrendo.2017.157\n10.1016/j.pcad.2018.07.011\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.11.006\n10.5114/aoms.2016.58928\n10.1016/j.mam.2018.07.001\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173796\n10.1016/j.psychres.2016.06.037\n10.1002/ptr.4640\n10.1248/bpb.b18-00915\n10.1186/s12906-018-2331-5\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107308\n10.1002/jcb.29310\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.05.041\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.02.059\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01438\n10.1016/j.brainres.2013.06.032\n10.1631/jzus.B1200263\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111874\n10.3390/ijms21197165\n10.1038/s41401-020-0410-x\n10.1684/ecn.2018.0415\n10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70134-2\n10.1172/JCI92035\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.111.964627\n10.1016/j.tcm.2014.09.005\n10.2174/157340609787049316\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2013.11.001\n10.1016/j.pupt.2010.12.005\n10.1007/s00216-012-6658-3\n10.2337/db08-0038\n10.1016/j.taap.2017.11.003\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01286\n10.1038/ncomms13997\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111361\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112121\n10.1111/jfbc.12952"}
{"title": "Altered heart cytokine profile and action potential modulation in cardiomyocytes from Mas-deficient mice.", "abstract": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key hormonal system. In recent years, the functional analysis of the novel axis of the RAS (ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor) revealed that its activation can become protective against several pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases. Mas knockout mice (Mas-KO) represent an important tool for new investigations. Indeed, extensive biological research has focused on investigating the functional implications of Mas receptor deletion. However, although the Mas receptor was identified in neonatal cardiomyocytes and also in adult ventricular myocytes, only few reports have explored the Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling directly in cardiomyocytes to date. This study investigated the implication of Mas receptor knockout to the cytokine profile, energy metabolism, and electrical properties of mice-isolated cardiomyocytes. Here, we demonstrated that Mas-KO mice have modulation in some cytokines, such as G-CSF, IL-6, IL-10, and VEGF in the left ventricle. This model also presents increased mitochondrial number in cardiomyocytes and a reduction in the myocyte diameter. Finally, Mas-KO cardiomyocytes have altered action potential modulation after diazoxide challenge. Such electrical finding was different from the data showed for the TGR(A1-7)3292 (TGR) model, which overexpresses Ang-(1-7) in the plasma by 4.5, used by us as a control. Collectively, our findings exemplify the importance of understanding the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway in cardiomyocytes and heart tissue. The Mas-KO mice model can be considered an important tool for new RAS investigations.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["Danielle Carvalho OliveiraCoutinho", "Julliane VJoviano-Santos", "ArturSantos-Miranda", "Paulo Ant\u00f4nioMartins-J\u00fanior", "AnalinaDa Silva", "Robson Augusto SouzaSantos", "Anderson Jos\u00e9Ferreira"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.06.014"}
{"title": "Epirubicin Alters DNA Methylation Profiles Related to Cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Epirubicin (EPI) is an important anticancer drug that is well-known for its cardiotoxic side effect. Studying epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation can help to understand the EPI-related toxic mechanisms in cardiac tissue. In this study, we analyzed the DNA methylation profile in a relevant human cell model and inspected the expression of differentially methylated genes at the transcriptome level to understand how changes in DNA methylation could affect gene expression in relation to EPI-induced cardiotoxicity.\nHuman cardiac microtissues were exposed to either therapeutic or toxic (IC20) EPI doses during 2 weeks. The DNA and RNA were collected from microtissues in triplicates at 2, 8, 24, 72, 168, 240, and 336 hours of exposure. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) analysis was used to detect DNA methylation levels in EPI-treated and control samples. The MeDIP-seq data were analyzed and processed using the QSEA package with a recently published workflow. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to measure global gene expression in the same samples.\nAfter processing the MeDIP-seq data, we detected 35, 37, 15 candidate genes which show strong methylated alterations between all EPI-treated, EPI therapeutic and EPI toxic dose-treated samples compared to control, respectively. For several genes, gene expressions changed compatibly reflecting the DNA methylation regulation.\nThe observed DNA methylation modifications provide further insights into the EPI-induced cardiotoxicity.

The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) has accelerated research in human heart regeneration and physiology. Nevertheless, due to the immaturity of iPSC-CMs, they are far from being an representative model of the adult heart physiology. Therefore, number of laboratories strive to obtain a heart tissues by engineering methods by structuring iPSC-CMs into complex and advanced platforms. By using the iPSC-CMs and arranging them in 3D cultures it is possible to obtain a human heart muscle with physiological capabilities potentially similar to the adult heart, while remaining in vitro. Here, we attempt to describe existing examples of heart muscle either in vitro or ex vivo models and discuss potential options for the further development of such structures. This will be a crucial step for ultimate derivation of complete heart tissue-mimicking organs and their future use in drug development, therapeutic approaches testing, pre-clinical studies, and clinical applications.

{"title": "Age and Chronodisruption in Mouse Heart: Effect of the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Melatonin Therapy.", "abstract": "Age and age-dependent inflammation are two main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Aging can also affect clock gene-related impairments such as chronodisruption and has been linked to a decline in melatonin synthesis and aggravation of the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 innate immune response known as inflammaging. The molecular drivers of these mechanisms remain unknown. This study investigated the impact of aging and NLRP3 expression on the cardiac circadian system, and the actions of melatonin as a potential therapy to restore daily rhythms by mitigating inflammaging. We analyzed the circadian expression and rhythmicity of clock genes in heart tissue of wild-type and NLRP3-knockout mice at 3, 12, and 24 months of age, with and without melatonin treatment. Our results support that aging, NLRP3 inflammasome, and melatonin affected the cardiac clock genes expression, except for ", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["MarisolFern\u00e1ndez-Ortiz", "Ramy K ASayed", "YolandaRom\u00e1n-Montoya", "Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles Rolde Lama", "Jos\u00e9Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez", "YolandaRam\u00edrez-Casas", "JavierFlorido-Ruiz", "IrynaRusanova", "GermaineEscames", "Dar\u00edoAcu\u00f1a-Castroviejo"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23126846\n10.1046/j.1444-2892.2002.00126.x\n10.1016/j.hfc.2011.08.011\n10.1007/s10522-018-9750-z\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135821\n10.1016/B978-0-12-387690-4.00006-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209957\n10.1073/pnas.0808180106\n10.1038/s41569-019-0167-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.313349\n10.1007/s00114-013-1026-5\n10.1007/s00018-017-2610-1\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06651.x\n10.1038/s41569-018-0064-2\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.311916\n10.1007/s00380-015-0723-8\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000247\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.11.161\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2015.01.002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00441.2014\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002469\n10.1371/journal.pone.0104771\n10.1517/14728222.2016.1088005\n10.3390/antiox9121187\n10.3390/antiox10081269\n10.1016/0303-7207(91)90087-9\n10.1007/s00018-014-1579-2\n10.1159/000156470\n10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.02938.x\n10.1053/euhj.1999.1527\n10.1155/2012/670294\n10.1080/10715760600936359\n10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00800.x\n10.1096/fj.15-273656\n10.1111/jpi.12303\n10.1038/ncomms5753\n10.1101/gad.319228.118\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1009933\n10.1073/pnas.1812405116\n10.1038/s41401-018-0064-0\n10.1038/s41467-018-06568-5\n10.1093/abbs/gmz078\n10.7150/thno.43834\n10.1097/MOL.0b013e3280464ef6\n10.1074/jbc.M004982200\n10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01420.x\n10.1038/s42003-019-0595-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0189330\n10.1172/jci.insight.95177\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.01.008\n10.1152/ajpheart.01291.2007\n10.1152/ajpheart.00608.2015\n10.1152/ajpheart.00238.2012\n10.1177/0748730414543141\n10.1016/j.exger.2014.03.011\n10.1007/s11010-006-9294-4\n10.1161/hh1101.091190\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3559-12.2012\n10.1073/pnas.152318499\n10.1177/0748730413478552\n10.1016/j.exger.2011.09.003\n10.1073/pnas.1008882108\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00205-1\n10.1053/j.gastro.2007.07.009\n10.1038/npjamd.2016.30\n10.1073/pnas.1508249112\n10.1023/A:1010091829946\n10.1161/01.RES.0000204504.25798.a8\n10.1038/s41598-018-30323-x\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63598-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.01280.2008\n10.1038/nm.2728\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.653303\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.790469\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000358833.41181.f6\n10.1016/S0197-4580(01)00344-X\n10.1126/science.186.4163.548\n10.1016/0197-4580(82)90018-5\n10.3109/07420529409055896\n10.1111/jpi.12189\n10.1016/j.joca.2019.01.012\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1001839\n10.1128/MCB.00781-10\n10.1126/science.aao0318\n10.1186/1471-2199-9-41\n10.3390/ijms21072469\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00095.2018\n10.1111/jpi.12312\n10.1016/j.cmet.2016.03.007\n10.1016/j.neuron.2004.07.018\n10.1111/jpi.12581\n10.1111/jpi.12410\n10.3109/07420528.2011.553016\n10.1523/ENEURO.0064-15.2015\n10.3109/07420528.2011.635237\n10.1016/j.smrv.2007.07.005\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.035\n10.1111/gtc.12633\n10.1007/s00335-016-9639-6\n10.1080/07420520902924939\n10.1177/0748730404269169\n10.1177/0748730406299078\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.056076\n10.1080/15548627.2021.1938913\n10.1016/j.arr.2019.04.006\n10.1007/s11010-010-0636-x\n10.1093/gerona/glu315\n10.1093/gerona/glu161\n10.1093/gerona/gly059\n10.1093/gerona/glz079\n10.1126/science.3941912\n10.1016/S0169-328X(98)00273-3\n10.1159/000048238\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183090\n10.1016/0006-8993(84)91045-X\n10.1083/jcb.17.1.208"}

{"title": "Cardioprotective Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms Induced by Intermittent Hypobaric Hypoxia.", "abstract": "More than 80 million people live and work (in a chronic or intermittent form) above 2500 masl, and 35 million live in the Andean Mountains. Furthermore, in Chile, it is estimated that 100,000 people work in high-altitude shifts, where stays in the lowlands are interspersed with working visits in the highlands. Acute exposure to high altitude has been shown to induce oxidative stress in healthy human lowlanders due to increased free radical formation and decreased antioxidant capacity. However, intermittent hypoxia (IH) induces preconditioning in animal models, generating cardioprotection. Here, we aim to describe the responses of a cardiac function to four cycles of intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IHH) in a rat model. The twelve adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into two equal groups, a four-cycle of IHH and a normobaric hypoxic control. Intermittent hypoxia was induced in a hypobaric chamber in four continuous cycles (1 cycle = 4 days of hypoxia + 4 days of normoxia), reaching a barometric pressure equivalent to 4600 m of altitude (428 Torr). At the end of the fourth cycle, cardiac structural and functional variables were also determined by echocardiography; furthermore, cardiac oxidative stress biomarkers (4-Hydroxynonenal, HNE; nitrotyrosine, NT), antioxidant enzymes, and NLRP3 inflammasome panel expression are also determined. Our results show a higher ejection and a shortening fraction of the left ventricle function by the end of the fourth cycle. Furthermore, cardiac tissue presented a decreased expression of antioxidant proteins. However, a decrease in IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1n, and oxidative stress markers is observed in IHH compared to normobaric hypoxic controls. Non-significant differences were found in protein levels of NLRP3 and caspase-1. IHH exposure determines structural and functional heart changes.

Early embryogenesis is vital for organ formation and subsequent development. The developmental toxicity of TBBPA in aquatic animals has been extensively reported. However, few studies have assessed the toxic effects of TBBPA in the early embryonic development. In this work, we found that TBBPA perturbed cell fate decisions along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis during gastrulation, further disrupting early organogenesis in the entire embryo. TBBPA exposure increased the number of embryonic cells that acquired a ventral cell fate, which formed epidermis, blood and heart tissues. In return, the number of embryonic cells that acquired a dorsal cell fate was greatly decreased, causing the TBBPA-exposed embryos to develop a small brain and small eyes. We revealed that TBBPA elevated the activity gradient of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling which is responsible for cell fate specification along the DV axis, with up-regulation of BMP ligands (bmp4, bmp7a) and target genes (szl) and promotion signal transduction through phosphorylation of Smad1/5. As the function of BMP signaling in embryogenesis is highly conserved among many vertebrates, these findings highlight the ecological and health risks of TBBPA.", "journal": "Journal of hazardous materials", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["ShaochenPang", "YueGao", "YanwuWang", "XingleiYao", "MengxiCao", "YongLiang", "MaoyongSong", "GuibinJiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128512"}

{"title": "Ascorbic Acid Ameliorates Cardiac and Hepatic Toxicity Induced by Azithromycin-Etoricoxib Drug Interaction.", "abstract": "The complexity of prescribing safe and effective drug therapy is still challenging. Due to the increased number of medications taken by patients, the potential for drug-drug interactions has clinically important consequences. This study focuses on the potential drug-drug interaction between azithromycin and etoricoxib and the possibility of counteracting this adverse reaction by giving ascorbic acid intraperitoneally to male albino rats. Sixty adult male albino rats weighing 150-180 g were used. The rats were allocated into six equal groups. One group was a control, and the others were given azithromycin, etoricoxib, either alone or combination, with one group treated with ascorbic acid and the last group treated with the drug combination and ascorbic acid. Blood samples were collected for measuring AST, ALT, LDH, CK-MB, and troponin alongside antioxidant enzymes and histopathological examination for both liver and heart tissue. The results showed both hepatic and cardiac damage in azithromycin and etoricoxib groups represented by increasing levels of heaptoc enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH, CK-MB, and troponin) with declining antioxidant enzymes and elevation of malondialdehyde and the appearance of hepatic and cardiac toxicities. Upon administration, ascorbic acid ameliorated all the mentioned biochemical parameters.

{"title": "Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) Protects the Heart From Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Cellular Apoptosis in Mice.", "abstract": "Strategies for treating myocardial ischemia in the clinic usually include re-canalization of the coronary arteries to restore blood supply to the myocardium. However, myocardial reperfusion insult often leads to oxidative stress and inflammation, which in turn leads to apoptosis and necrosis of myocardial cells, for which there are no standard treatment methods. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacological effect of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a phytochemical found in most cruciferous vegetables, in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI). Our results showed that I3C pretreatment (100\u00a0mg/kg, once daily, i. p.) prevented the MIRI-induced increase in infarct size and serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in mice. I3C pretreatment also suppressed cardiac apoptosis in MIRI mice by increasing the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreasing the expression levels of several apoptotic proteins, including Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9. In addition, I3C pretreatment was found to reduce the levels of parameters reflecting oxidative stress, such as dihydroethidium (DHE), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO), while increasing the levels of parameters reflecting anti-oxidation, such as total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and glutathione (GSH), in MIRI-induced ischemic heart tissue. I3C pretreatment was also able to remarkably decrease the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA in ischemic heart tissue. These results demonstrate that administration of I3C protects the heart from MIRI through its anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2022-06-24", "authors": ["QiLi", "BoyuXia", "JingjingWu", "XiaomeiYuan", "XuLu", "ChaoHuang", "HongchengGu", "KoulongZheng", "QingshengYou", "KunLiu"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2022.924174\n10.1016/j.jss.2017.03.019\n10.2174/1389557518666180313100144\n10.1080/15216549600201302\n10.1002/bdrb.20046\n10.1093/cvr/cvr034\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.12.005\n10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.41.1.203\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.01.066\n10.1002/mnfr.201300012\n10.1096/fj.13-235440\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09255.x\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.02.088\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1016/j.canlet.2008.03.024\n10.1007/s00395-016-0549-2\n10.1016/s0022-2828(87)80563-1\n10.1186/s12974-020-01999-8\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2004.10.007\n10.1016/j.biopen.2018.05.001\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.020\n10.3892/mmr.2017.7788\n10.1002/ctm2.166\n10.1101/cshperspect.a008656\n10.1080/10799893.2017.1360351\n10.1080/08916934.2018.1494161\n10.1016/s0008-6363(98)00033-9\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2017.06.002\n10.1080/14786419.2022.2041632\n10.1016/j.bbi.2012.11.011\n10.1172/JCI19297\n10.1002/advs.202102919\n10.1038/s41590-018-0107-1\n10.1093/carcin/bgv054\n10.1093/aje/kwm263\n10.1182/blood-2004-12-4589\n10.1155/2016/1015390\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.04.019\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.114702"}

Firstly, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in heart tissues of obese and normal mice. Then, we analyzed DEGs using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Thirdly, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and key modules and searched hub genes. Finally, we observed the pathological changes associated with obesity through histopathology.\nA total of 763 DEGs were discovered, including 629 upregulated and 134 downregulated genes. GO enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly related to the regulation of transcription, DNA-templated, nucleic acid binding, and metal ion binding. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were enriched in long-term depression, gap junction, and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, we identified UTP14A, DKC1, DDX10, PinX1, and ESF1 as the hub genes. Histopathologic analysis showed that obesity increased the number of collagen fibers and decreased the number of microvessels and proliferation of the endothelium and increased endothelial cell damage which further leads to dysfunction of cardiac microcirculation.\nUTP14A, DKC1, DDX10, PinX1, and ESF1 have been identified as hub genes in obesity-induced pathological changes in the heart and may be involved in obesity-induced cardiac injury by affecting cardiac microcirculatory function.", "journal": "Journal of diabetes research", "date": "2022-06-24", "authors": ["XiaoyuPan", "ShuchunChen", "XingChen", "QingjuanRen", "LinYue", "ShuNiu", "ZelinLi", "RuiyiZhu", "XiaoyiChen", "ZhuoyaJia", "RuoxiZhen", "JiangliBan"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/2923291\n10.1155/2021/6702767\n10.1530/EC-21-0360\n10.5534/wjmh.190160\n10.3390/cells10092435\n10.1016/j.hfc.2020.02.004\n10.1186/s12877-021-02393-6\n10.1177/2047487320935550\n10.1016/j.jchf.2013.01.006\n10.1038/s41598-019-54522-2\n10.3390/nu11010051\n10.3389/fendo.2021.568197\n10.1186/s12929-017-0357-5\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.03.509\n10.1590/S0001-37652007000400005\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110103\n10.1007/s11154-015-9310-7\n10.1038/s41388-018-0592-6\n10.3390/nu12030814\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316101\n10.1038/nature05487\n10.1093/cvr/cvx093\n10.1007/s11906-019-0930-2\n10.1007/s00109-020-01993-w\n10.1186/s12885-020-07415-x\n10.14715/cmb/2017.63.2.15\n10.1371/journal.pone.0081798\n10.1023/A:1024196504666\n10.1111/1759-7714.13176\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.142\n10.1016/j.canlet.2018.10.010\n10.7150/jca.44649\n10.1007/s10456-019-09675-z\n10.1007/s10637-019-00748-w\n10.14670/HH-28.365\n10.1016/j.chest.2020.07.025\n10.1038/s41416-019-0695-z\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2020.118845\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.12.069"}

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using antibodies against CACNA1G, KCNJ2, KCNQ1, KCNH2 and KCNE1. The cardiac conduction system in samples stained with MT and EVG could not be identified. Therefore, the levels of immunoperoxidase staining were quantified using QuPath software.\nThe nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin was higher for the hypoxia group (hypoxia median 0.13 vs. 0.04 unexplained, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

In particular, we focus on the statistical analysis of innovative high-dimensional spatial transcriptomic data while incorporating external multiomics data that provide distinct but complementary information to the detection of spatial expression patterns. We extend OrderShapeEM, an efficient covariate-assisted multiple testing procedure that incorporates one auxiliary study, to make it permissible to incorporate multiple external omics studies, to boost statistical power of spatial expression pattern detection. Specifically, we first use a recently proposed computationally efficient statistical analysis method, spatial pattern recognition via kernels, to produce the primary test statistics for spatial transcriptomic data. Afterwards, we construct the auxiliary covariate by combining information from multiple external omics studies, such as bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data using the Cauchy combination rule. Finally, we extend and implement the integrative analysis method OrderShapeEM on the primary P-values along with auxiliary data incorporating multiomics information for efficient covariate-assisted spatial expression analysis. We conduct a series of realistic simulations to evaluate the performance of our method with known ground truth. Four case studies in mouse olfactory bulb, mouse cerebellum, human breast cancer, and human heart tissues further demonstrate the substantial power gain of our method in detecting genes with spatial expression patterns compared to existing classic approaches that do not utilize any external information.", "journal": "Genetics", "date": "2022-06-23", "authors": ["YanLi", "XiangZhou", "HongyuanCao"], "doi": "10.1093/genetics/iyac095"}

Doxorubicin (Dox)-induced HF model was constructed in rats and cardiomyocytes H9C2, and the cardiac function was determined using ultrasound cardiogram. Morphology of cardiac tissue was observed using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The viability and apoptosis of Dox-treated and transfected cardiomyocytes were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry. Relative expressions of the HF-associated miRs (including miR-144-3p), suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), apoptosis- and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway-related factors (B-cell lymphoma 2, Bcl-2; Bcl-2 associated X protein, Bax; cleaved [C] capsase-3; phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PI3K; phosphorylated-PI3K, p-PI3K; p-AKT; AKT) were measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes exert critical roles in the treatment of multiple diseases through transferring non-coding RNAs. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel form of functional RNAs that involves in the progression of multiple cardiac pathological condition. Nevertheless, the function of MSCs-derived exosomal circRTN4 in sepsis-induced myocardial injury is still obscure. Significantly, FISH assay demonstrated the location of circRTN4 in cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. The expression of circRTN4 was reduced in the cardiac tissues from caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rats and LPS-treated cardiomyocytes. CircRTN4 could be delivered to cardiomyocytes cells via MSCs-derived exosomes. The cardiac injury and apoptosis were induced in the CLP rats and the treatment of MSCs-derived exosomal circRTN4 relieved the phenotypes. MSCs-derived exosomal circRTN4 notably suppressed the upregulated ROS level in the CLP rats. The activity of SOD and GSH was repressed in CLP rats, in which MSCs-derived exosomal circRTN4 rescued the activity in the rats. The upregulated IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels in CLP rats were reduced by the treatment of MSCs-derived exosomal circRTN4. MSCs-derived exosomal circRTN4 improved cell survival and suppressed apoptosis of LPS-treated cardiomyocytes. CircRTN4 direct interact with miR-497-5p to upregulate MG53 expression in cardiomyocytes. MSCs-derived exosomal circRTN4 relieves LPS-stimulated cardiomyocyte damage via targeting miR-497-5p/MG53 axis. Therefore, we determine that MSCs-derived exosomes prevent sepsis-induced myocardial injury by a circRTN4/miR-497-5p/MG53 pathway.

{"title": "Proteomics Reveals Long-Term Alterations in Signaling and Metabolic Pathways Following Both Myocardial Infarction and Chemically Induced Denervation.", "abstract": "Myocardial infraction (MI) is the principal risk factor for the onset of heart failure (HF). Investigations regarding the physiopathology of MI progression to HF have revealed the concerted engagement of other tissues, such as the autonomic nervous system and the medulla oblongata (MO), giving rise to systemic effects, important in the regulation of heart function. Cardiac sympathetic afferent denervation following application of resiniferatoxin (RTX) attenuates cardiac remodelling and restores cardiac function following MI. While the physiological responses are well documented in numerous species, the underlying molecular responses during the initiation and progression from MI to HF remains unclear. We obtained multi-tissue time course proteomics with a murine model of HF induced by MI in conjunction with RTX application. We isolated tissue sections from the left ventricle (LV), MO, cervical spinal cord and cervical vagal nerves at four time points over a 12-week study. Bioinformatic analyses consistently revealed a high statistical enrichment for metabolic pathways in all tissues and treatments, implicating a central role of mitochondria in the tissue-cellular response to both MI and RTX. In fact, the additional functional pathways found to be enriched in these tissues, involving the cytoskeleton, vesicles and signal transduction, could be downstream of responses initiated by mitochondria due to changes in neuronal pulse frequency after a shock such as MI or the modification of such frequency communication from the heart to the brain after RTX application.

Geniposide was reported to show potential therapeutic use for MI/RI with its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, research on the specific mechanism of geniposide has not been reported.\nThe MIRI model of animal was created in male C57BL/6J mice and the hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) model was established for the in vitro experiments. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and H9c2 cells with knockdown of TXNIP or NLRP3 were used. Geniposide was administered to mice before vascular ligation. HE staining, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, echocardiography, oxidative stress and myocardial enzyme detection were used to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of geniposide. Meanwhile, pharmacological approaches of agonist and inhibitor were used to observe potential pathway for geniposide cardioprotective in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ELISA kits were adopted to detect the levels of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. The gene and protein expression of NLRP3 and pyroptosis-related factors in heart tissue were performed by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence in vivo and in vitro, respectively.\nOur results indicate that geniposide can reduce the area of myocardial infarction, improve heart function, and inhibit the inflammatory response in mice after MI/RI. In addition, RT-PCR and western blotting shown geniposide promoting AMPK phosphorylation to activate myocardium energy metabolism and reducing the levels of genes and proteins expression of NLRP3, ASC, N-GSDMD and cleaved caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18. Meanwhile, geniposide improved NRVMs energy metabolism, which decreased ROS levels and the protein expression of TXNIP and thus suppressed the expression of NLRP3. AMPK antagonist or agonist and siRNA downregulation of TXNIP or NLRP3 were also verify the effect of geniposide against H/R injury. Further research found that geniposide promoted the translocation of TXNIP and reduce the binding of TXNIP and NLRP3.\nIn our study, geniposide can significantly inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the AMPK signaling pathway and inhibit pyroptosis of cardiomyocytes in myocardial tissues.", "journal": "Chinese medicine", "date": "2022-06-18", "authors": ["HaiyanLi", "Dong-HuaYang", "YanmeiZhang", "FuchunZheng", "FenfeiGao", "JiajiaSun", "GanggangShi"], "doi": "10.1186/s13020-022-00616-5\n10.1016/j.apsb.2020.09.006\n10.1016/j.ceb.2017.01.005\n10.1016/j.cmet.2004.12.003\n10.3390/ijms21144987\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.787440\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000696\n10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153798\n10.3389/fphar.2020.607813\n10.1093/cvr/cvy304\n10.3389/fphar.2021.671318\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.768594\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.09.086\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.161\n10.1038/ni.1831\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.005\n10.1134/S0006297908130099\n10.1111/bph.12535\n10.1089/ars.2012.4757\n10.1074/jbc.M109.034421\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.244681\n10.1111/bph.13449\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.06.039\n10.2147/DDDT.S292107\n10.1016/j.jchemneu.2019.101687\n10.1111/bph.13397\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00105\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.02.011\n10.1016/j.retram.2019.03.002\n10.1038/ncomms8619\n10.1038/s41418-018-0206-4\n10.1038/s41419-018-0805-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00227.2007\n10.1152/ajpheart.00346.2014\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.04.023\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.863\n10.1016/0022-2828(89)90774-8\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106609\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.102114\n10.1038/nrd.2018.97\n10.1093/cvr/cvy033\n10.4161/auto.4281\n10.1172/JCI19297\n10.1089/ars.2014.6120\n10.1016/j.intimp.2016.09.024\n10.1016/j.jhep.2017.01.022\n10.7150/ijbs.29680\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.10.023\n10.4049/jimmunol.1301490\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2021.02.047\n10.1111/imr.12285\n10.1083/jcb.202006194\n10.1093/cvr/cvz152\n10.1016/j.molimm.2018.10.001"}

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), an emerging class of non-protein-coding transcripts, are involved in regulation of multiple cardiac diseases through diverse molecular mechanism, whereas the role of cytoplasmic lncRNAs in regulating cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. In this study, we identified a novel and functional long noncoding RNA Gm17501, which was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. The expression level of lncRNA Gm17501 was altered in cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and phenylephrine treatment. Moreover, lncRNA Gm17501 expression was decreased in the heart tissue of patients with heart failure. Silencing lncRNA Gm17501 aggravated cardiac hypertrophy under pathological stress. Inhibition of lncRNA Gm17501 did not alter the expression of nearby genes but decreased mRNA level of calcium handling proteins which were involved in cardiac contraction.

Whether sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), as a new hypoglycemic drug, benefits ACM remains unclear. Cardiomyocyte-specific Dsg2 exon-11 knockout and wild-type (WT) littermate mice were used as the animal model of ACM and controls, respectively. Mice were administered by gavage with either SGLT2i dapagliflozin (DAPA, 1\u00a0mg/kg/day) or vehicle alone for 8\u2009weeks. HL-1 cells were treated with DAPA to identify the molecular mechanism in vitro. All mice presented normal glucose homeostasis. DAPA not only significantly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction, adverse remodeling, and ventricular dilation in ACM but also attenuated ACM-associated cardiac fibrofatty replacement, as demonstrated by the echocardiography and histopathological examination. The protein expressions of HIF-2\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b1 were decreased and increased respectively in cardiac tissue of ACM, which were compromised after DAPA treatment. Additionally, NF-\u03baB P65 and I\u03baB phosphorylation, as well as fibrosis indicators (including TGF-\u03b2, \u03b1-SMA, Collagen I, and Collagen III) were increased in ACM. However, these trends were markedly suppressed by DAPA treatment. Consistent with these results in vitro, DAPA alleviated the I\u03baB phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB p65 transcriptional activity in DSG2-knockdown HL-1 cells. Interestingly, the elective HIF-2\u03b1 inhibitor PT2399 almost completely blunted the DAPA-mediated downregulation of indicators concerning cardiac fibrosis and inflammation.

HA\u2009+\u2009GA treatment down-regulated serum isonicotinic acid, phosphatidylcholine, cardiolipin, estrogen glucuronide, and glycocholic acid, up-regulated serum sphingosine and deoxycholic acid in the CHF rats.\nIn conclusion, HA\u2009+\u2009GA showed protective effects on CHF in the rats, and the HA\u2009+\u2009GA may exert protective effects by reducing lipid levels, up-regulating the expression of FGF2 and VEGFA proteins, attenuating eNOS protein expression, and modulating metabolic pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HA\u2009+\u2009GA-mediated effects still require further examination.", "journal": "BMC complementary medicine and therapies", "date": "2022-06-17", "authors": ["LiqinWang", "HaimingDeng", "TengyuWang", "YunQiao", "JianbingZhu", "MingfengXiong"], "doi": "10.1186/s12906-022-03632-y\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.25\n10.1038/nm.2538\n10.1007/s00395-019-0722-5\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00753\n10.1139/cjpp-2017-0092\n10.1371/journal.pone.0150447\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.2012.01532.x\n10.1016/j.jep.2015.03.023\n10.1177/1535370216685433\n10.1159/000430134\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.08.009\n10.1016/S0140-6736(60)90680-2\n10.1172/JCI131838\n10.1002/ejhf.640\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246819\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.906818\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000065220.70220.F7\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.235390\n10.1056/NEJMoa1109400\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.08.010\n10.1105/tpc.113.118018"}

Thus, exploring protection measures and underlying mechanisms appear to be particularly important. In this study, we investigated the cardioprotection of wogonoside against I/R injury in mice and further uncovered its mechanism.\nMice model of myocardial I/R injury was established by left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Before modeling, mice were administered the wogonoside (10, 20, and 40\u2009mg/kg) for 7\u2009d. To evaluate the effect of wogonoside through nuclear factor E2-associated factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) pathway, sh-Nrf2 was transfected into wogonoside-treated I/R mice. Subsequently, echocardiography detection, HE staining, western blotting, ELISA, TUNEL assay, and MASSON assay were utilized to evaluate the degree of myocardial injury.\nIn I/R group, mice had severe myocardial injury, however, pretreatment of wogonoside at doses of 20 and 40\u2009mg/kg ameliorated the cardiac function, as evidenced by improving hemodynamic parameters. Besides, wogonoside could relieved the abnormality of cardiomyocytes structure, inflammatory reaction, apoptosis, and myocardial fibrosis. Importantly, wogonoside activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, as demonstrated by increasing Nrf2 expression in nucleus and its downstream genes including HO-1 and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). However, effects of wogonoside on cardioprotection were abolished by sh-Nrf2.\nWogonoside exerted the protective role against I/R-induced myocardial injury by suppression of apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis ", "journal": "Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology", "date": "2022-06-17", "authors": ["BingshanZhang", "DiXu"], "doi": "10.1080/08923973.2022.2090955"}

Because ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, SARS-CoV-2 can severely infect heart tissue and arteries, causing acute and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Therefore, special attention should be paid to finding appropriate agents to protect this vital system during COVID-19 treatment. Papaverine is a unique vasodilator alkaloid that is clinically used in the treatment of vasospasm. Interestingly, this compound has potent and direct effects on a wide range of viruses, and could also prevent viral exploitation mechanisms of the host cell facilities by inhibiting some cellular signaling pathways such as p38 MAPK. This pathway was recently introduced as a promising target for the treatment of COVID-19. Papaverine also has anti-inflammatory effects which is useful in combating the hyper-inflammatory phase of the COVID-19. Unlike some medications that have severe dosage-restrictions in the treatment of COVID-19 due to cardiac side effects, papaverine is recommended for use in many heart disorders. The ability of papaverine to treat COVID-19 has become more promising when the results of some extensive screenings showed the strong ability of this compound to inhibit the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 with EC", "journal": "Drug development research", "date": "2022-06-17", "authors": ["MehdiValipour", "HamidIrannejad", "SaeedEmami"], "doi": "10.1002/ddr.21961\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa106"}
{"title": "Interaction of multiple spiral rotors in a reaction-diffusion system.", "abstract": "Rotors of reaction and diffusion are phase singularities that give rise to spiral waves of chemical activity, which are very similar to spatiotemporal patterns observed across several excitable media. Here we carry out experiments with the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction system and numerical simulations based on a reaction-diffusion model to show the possible interactions of multiple spiral rotors. When the cores of two spirals come very close to each other, they could either repel, attract, or remain stationary, depending on their relative chirality, phase, and distance separating them. Multiple pairs of spiral waves, in proximity to each other, could alter the paths of the individual rotors. A spiral core will be influenced most by the rotor that is closest to it, depending on the nature of the corresponding spiral wave arm. We observed rotors lying within a limiting distance of each other attract and annihilate. Otherwise, they push each other away until they reach a critical distance, beyond which all interactions seem to cease. We have established a relationship of this critical distance to the properties of the spiral wave. We also observed spontaneous symmetry-breaking instability for a system of up to eight rotors. Our experiments with the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction have successfully demonstrated the validity of the numerical results. A thorough understanding of the dynamics of several spiral rotors within a small area could help us perceive the nature of such excitation waves in cardiac tissue and cell membranes.", "journal": "Physical review.

{"title": "Surgical Ablation of Cardiac Tissue with Nanosecond Pulsed Electric Fields in Swine.", "abstract": "Myocardial tissue can be ablated by the application nanosecond pulsed fields (nsPEFs). The applied electric fields irreversibly permeabilize cell membranes and thereby kill myocytes while leaving the extracellular matrix intact.\nIn domestic pigs (n = 10), hearts were exposed via sternotomy and either ablated in vivo ([Formula: see text] = 5) or in excised, Langendorff-perfused hearts ([Formula: see text] = 5). The nsPEFs consisted of 6-36 pulses of 300 ns each, delivered at 3-6 Hz; the voltage applied varied from 10 to 12 kV. Atrial lesions were either created after inserting the bottom jaw of the bipolar clamp into the atrium via a purse string incision (2-3 lesions per atrium) or by clamping a double layer of tissue at the appendages (one lesion per atrium). Ventricular lesions were created after an incision at the apex. The transmurality of each lesion was determined at three points along the lesion using a triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain.\nAll 27 atrial lesions were transmural. This includes 13/13 purse string lesions (39/39 sections, tissue thickness 2.5-4.5 mm) and 14/14 appendage lesions (42/42 sections, tissue thickness 8-12 mm). All 3 right ventricular lesions were transmural (9/9 sections, 18 pulses per lesion). Left ventricular lesions were always transmural for 36 pulses (3/3 lesions, 9/9 sections). All lesions have highly consistent width across the wall. There were no pulse-induced arrhythmias or other complications during the procedure.\nnsPEF ablation reliably created acute lesions in porcine atrial and ventricular myocardium.

{"title": "Therapeutic Strategies Targeting Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Sepsis-induced Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Sepsis is an increasingly worldwide problem; it is currently regarded as a complex life-threatening dysfunction of one or more organs as a result of dysregulated host immune response to infections. The heart is one of the most affected organs, as roughly 10% to 70% of sepsis cases are estimated to turn into sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC). SIC can be defined as a reversible myocardial dysfunction characterized by dilated ventricles, impaired contractility, and decreased ejection fraction. Mitochondria play a critical role in the normal functioning of cardiac tissues as the heart is highly dependent on its production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), its damage during SIC includes morphology impairment, mitophagy, biogenesis disequilibrium, electron transport chain disturbance, molecular damage from the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and many other different impairments that are major contributing factors to the severity of SIC. Although mitochondria-targeted therapies usage is still inadequate in clinical settings, the preclinical study outcomes promise that the implementation of these therapies may effectively treat SIC. This review summarizes the different therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria structure, quality, and quantity abnormalities for the treatment of SIC.", "journal": "Cardiovascular drugs and therapy", "date": "2022-06-16", "authors": ["Oluwabukunmi ModupeSalami", "OliveHabimana", "Jin-FuPeng", "Guang-HuiYi"], "doi": "10.1007/s10557-022-07354-8\n10.3390/ijerph18147598\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000001572\n10.1001/jama.2016.0287\n10.1097/MCC.0000000000000507\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000002851\n10.1016/j.chest.2018.08.1037\n10.1177/0300060518765896\n10.3389/fmed.2021.628302\n10.1089/sur.2006.033\n10.1038/s41569-020-00492-2\n10.1097/MD.0000000000005031\n10.1097/MD.0000000000010263\n10.1007/s11886-020-01277-2\n10.1007/s00134-014-3428-z\n10.1097/01.CCM.0000114827.93410.D8\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2003.02.005\n10.1007/s00392-011-0292-5\n10.1186/s40560-015-0112-5\n10.1016/j.jcrc.2015.05.017\n10.1097/BCR.0000000000000237\n10.1038/srep25984\n10.1016/j.ajem.2021.11.003\n10.1016/j.biocel.2016.07.032\n10.1016/S0300-9084(02)01375-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.09.023\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05213.x\n10.1016/j.abb.2007.03.034\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.069\n10.3390/molecules23030675\n10.1164/ajrccm.165.4.2105084\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2003\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2803\n10.1164/rccm.201106-1152OC\n10.1038/s41598-020-78195-4\n10.1164/rccm.201003-0326OC\n10.4049/jimmunol.171.10.5188\n10.1124/pr.115.011502\n10.1124/jpet.108.148049\n10.7150/ijbs.9220\n10.1242/jcs.03318\n10.1210/me.2007-0029\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101771\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.01.092\n10.1016/j.bcp.2020.114005\n10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.045\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.11.013\n10.18632/aging.103644\n10.1161/01.RES.0000117088.36577.EB\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.10.011\n10.1016/j.redox.2014.11.006\n10.1007/s10741-016-9530-2\n10.1038/s41401-020-00518-y\n10.1128/MCB.01054-14\n10.1083/jcb.201507035\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000461\n10.1111/jpi.12413\n10.1111/jcmm.15384\n10.1152/ajpheart.00203.2011\n10.1007/s00109-019-01756-2\n10.3109/10715762.2014.906592\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060967\n10.1096/fj.201901467R\n10.1007/s12192-019-00992-2\n10.1080/10799893.2019.1641822\n10.1093/cvr/cvt224\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303356\n10.1016/j.apsb.2020.03.004\n10.1091/mbc.e09-03-0252\n10.1038/s41467-018-08276-6\n10.1126/science.1231031\n10.2174/1389450116666150102113648\n10.1074/jbc.M501599200\n10.1128/MCB.00911-10\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.236745\n10.1161/JAHA.112.003012\n10.1101/gad.460708\n10.1111/jpi.12542\n10.1042/CS20190014\n10.1074/jbc.M702657200\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.906610\n10.1016/j.molmed.2019.10.007\n10.1007/s11908-003-0015-9\n10.21037/jtd.2016.05.37\n10.1177/0884533614561790\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05755.x\n10.1111/jpi.12134\n10.1172/jci.insight.99292\n10.1056/NEJM199211263272204\n10.1186/s40635-021-00384-w\n10.1186/s12872-021-02301-1\n10.3390/metabo11020124\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136816\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011707\n10.3390/cells8080795\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01060\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2177\n10.1166/mex.2020.1642\n10.2174/092986705774370646\n10.1016/j.tem.2012.06.002\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.01.008\n10.1080/09674845.2018.1543160\n10.1016/S0009-9120(99)00075-2\n10.1164/rccm.200410-1346OC\n10.1007/s10753-019-01081-3\n10.1126/science.1095569\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.09.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.12.016\n10.1161/JAHA.120.019877\n10.3390/jpm11070610\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000261\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181844276\n10.1172/jci.insight.94248\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000002236\n10.12659/MSM.918369\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e31824e1370\n10.1097/MCC.0000000000000427\n10.1038/nature14156\n10.1186/1479-5876-10-130\n10.1152/ajplung.00400.2014\n10.1038/nrm3028\n10.1038/nature10992\n10.1371/journal.pone.0139416\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.039\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01071\n10.1371/journal.pone.0167678\n10.1371/journal.pone.0147792\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.030\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.036\n10.1038/ncb2012\n10.1016/j.molcel.2014.09.007\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2018.12.012\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.042\n10.7554/eLife.01958\n10.1038/ncb2422\n10.1038/cdd.2009.16\n10.1038/ncomms8527\n10.1038/ncb2837\n10.1007/s10495-019-01521-3\n10.1007/s00011-019-01292-2\n10.1089/ars.2013.5416\n10.1111/jcmm.13802\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e318214b67e\n10.1080/10715762.2017.1414949\n10.1074/jbc.M112.363747\n10.3389/fphar.2021.641058\n10.1371/journal.pone.0253849\n10.1177/2048872617710789\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004389\n10.1056/NEJMoa067373\n10.1097/00000542-200203000-00011\n10.1001/jama.2013.278477\n10.1016/j.chest.2016.11.036\n10.1007/s00134-019-05731-w\n10.21037/jtd.2016.12.10\n10.1007/s00134-013-2982-0\n10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02750.x"}

Female Wistar Albino rats, whose hair of the dorsal skin was shaved, were exposed to a combined UVA\u2009+\u2009B radiation for 2 h/day, for 4\u2009weeks in order to be compared with the control group. Histopathological findings in vital organs (liver and heart) were evaluated. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (pH\u2009=\u20097.2) and embedded in paraffin. The histopathological findings were examined on the H&E stained sections with light microscopy. The results show that the liver and the heart were injured in the UVA\u2009+\u2009B group. Liver tissue in the UVA\u2009+\u2009B group showed minimal vacuolation, enlargement of hepatocytes and bile duct proliferation, and the heart tissue showed hibernomas; uniform large cells resembling brown fat with coarsely granular to multivacuolated cytoplasm that is eosinophilic or pale with a small central nucleus. The number of hibernoma cases was significantly higher in the UVA\u2009+\u2009B group compared with the control group (P\u2009=\u20090.021). The control group showed normal liver and heart histology with normal adipose tissue in the pericardium. As a result, UVA\u2009+\u2009B exposure has toxic effects, especially on the liver and the heart of Wistar albino rats. UV radiation may cause such adverse effects in humans. Therefore, protection against the harmful effects of UV radiation is of significant importance for skin and organs.", "journal": "Photochemistry and photobiology", "date": "2022-06-16", "authors": ["SedaKeskin", "EdaAcikgoz", "Fatma YilmazErt\u00fcrk", "Murat CetinRagbetli", "HalilOzkol"], "doi": "10.1111/php.13664"}
{"title": "Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms Involved in Adipose-derived stem cell and their extracellular vesicles in an Experimental Model of Cardio- renal Syndrome type 3: Histological and Biochemical Study.", "abstract": "A cardio-renal syndrome (CRS) is a medical condition in which kidney problems are accompanied by heart problems and diagnosed when acute kidney injury contributes to the development of acute cardiac injury. Regenerative medicine is becoming increasingly interested in adipose stem cells. We evaluated the effect of both adipose-derived stem cell extracellular vesicles (ADSCs-EVs) and adipose stem cells (ADSCs) on an experimental model of CRSIII. In this study, isolation, and further identification of ADSCs and ADSCs-EVs by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. Cardio-renal syndrome in rats was induced by renal artery ligation RAL followed by a single dose injection of both ADSCs and ADSCs-EVs in separate groups. The effects of ADSCs-EVs and ADSCs against induced CRSIII were evaluated by both renal and cardiac oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers, renal function, and mRNA gene expression quantitation for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), p300, and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2C and MEF2A), as well as myocardin (MYOCD), as molecules associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, histological and immunohistochemical studies of cardiac and renal tissues were done. ADSCs-EVs were effectively isolated and characterized. ADSCs-EVs and ADSCs reversed induced CRSIII, evidenced by considerably decreased serum urea and creatinine levels. Returned oxidant/antioxidant stability, and decreased caspase 3-mediated apoptotic programmed cell death in cardiac and renal tissues. Additionally, they led to successful down-regulation of hypertrophic cardiac genes levels and reversed histopathological cardiac and renal injures. ADSCs-derived extracellular vesicles and ADSCs injection restored damaged cardiac and renal tissue and improved its function greatly following induced CRSIII. They could therefore be useful as a means of protecting the heart from the deleterious effects of acute renal injury and reprogramed injured cardiac cells by activating regenerative processes. SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) type III is a subcategory of CRS whereby acute kidney injury (AKI) could contribute to the development of acute cardiac dysfunction. This study provided innovatory data regarding the role of adipose-derived stem cell extracellular vesicles ADSCs-EVs and adipose stem cells (ADSCs) in acute renal and cardiac dysfunction and renal biopsy specimens in the form of interstitial inflammation/tubular degeneration. The main cause of renal and cardiac dysfunction is identified to be the activation and accumulation of inflammatory cells and oxidants in the interstitium, surrounded by increased amounts of extracellular matrix, and ADSCs-EVs have been proposed as a contributor factor. The study has evidenced that both ADSCs-EVs and adipose stem cells display beneficial effects on renal and cardiac tissues survival in terms of the frequent occurrence of cardio-renal syndrome, ADSC-EVs treatment repaired damaged renal and cardiac tissues and recovered their function. ADSC-EVs reversed the effects of cardio-renal syndrome and reprogramed injured cells by activating regenerative processes. The clinical significance of the results presented in future studies needs to be investigated further.", "journal": "Tissue & cell", "date": "2022-06-15", "authors": ["Wardah AbdullahAlasmari", "SomayaHosny", "HananFouad", "Khalid AlQuthami", "Essa Abdulaziz MohammedAlthobiany", "Eman MohamedFaruk"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tice.2022.101842"}

{"title": "Time course of pulmonary inflammation and trace element biodistribution during and after sub-acute inhalation exposure to copper oxide nanoparticles in a murine model.", "abstract": "It has been shown that copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) induce pulmonary toxicity after acute or sub-acute inhalation exposures. However, little is known about the biodistribution and elimination kinetics of inhaled CuO NPs from the respiratory tract. The purposes of this study were to observe the kinetics of pulmonary inflammation during and after CuO NP sub-acute inhalation exposure and to investigate copper (Cu) biodistribution and clearance rate from the exposure site and homeostasis of selected trace elements in secondary organs of BALB/c mice.\nSub-acute inhalation exposure to CuO NPs led to pulmonary inflammation represented by increases in lactate dehydrogenase, total cell counts, neutrophils, macrophages, inflammatory cytokines, iron levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and lung weight changes. Dosimetry analysis in lung tissues and BAL fluid showed Cu concentration increased steadily during exposure and gradually declined after exposure. Cu elimination from the lung showed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 6.5\u00a0days. Total Cu levels were significantly increased in whole blood and heart indicating that inhaled Cu could be translocated into the bloodstream and heart tissue, and potentially have adverse effects on the kidneys and spleen as there were significant changes in the weights of these organs; increase in the kidneys and decrease in the spleen. Furthermore, concentrations of selenium in kidneys and iron in spleen were decreased, pointing to disruption of trace element homeostasis.\nSub-acute inhalation exposure of CuO NPs induced pulmonary inflammation, which was correlated to Cu concentrations in the lungs and started to resolve once exposure ended. Dosimetry analysis showed that Cu in the lungs was translocated into the bloodstream and heart tissue.

{"title": "PI3K/Akt pathway mediates the positive inotropic effects of insulin in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts.", "abstract": "Insulin exerts positive inotropic effects on cardiac muscle; however, the relationship between cardiac contractility and phosphoinositol-3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) activation remains unclear. We hypothesized that the positive inotropic effects of insulin are dose-dependent and mediated via the PI3K/Akt pathway in isolated normal rat hearts. The Institutional Animal Investigation Committee approved the use of hearts excised from rats under pentobarbital anesthesia. The hearts were perfused at a constant pressure using the Langendorff technique. After stabilization (baseline), the hearts were randomly divided into the following four insulin (Ins) groups: 1) Ins0 (0\u00a0IU/L), 2) Ins0.5 (0.5\u00a0IU/L), 3) Ins5 (5\u00a0IU/L), and 4) Ins50 (50\u00a0IU/L) (n\u2009=\u20098 in each group). To clarify the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in insulin-dependent inotropic effects, we also treated the insulin groups with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (InsW): 5) InsW0 (0\u00a0IU/L), 6) InsW0.5 (0.5\u00a0IU/L), 7) InsW5 (5\u00a0IU/L), and 8) InsW50 (50\u00a0IU/L). Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution with or without wortmannin for 10\u00a0min, followed by 20\u00a0min perfusion with the solution containing each concentration of insulin. The data were recorded as the maximum left ventricular derivative of pressure development (LV dP/dt max). Myocardial p-Akt levels were measured at 3\u00a0min, 5\u00a0min, and at the end of the perfusion. In the Ins groups, LV dP/dt max in Ins5 and Ins50 increased by 14% and 48%, respectively, 3\u00a0min after insulin perfusion compared with the baseline. Tachyphylaxis was observed after 10\u00a0min in the Ins5 and Ins50 treatment groups. Wortmannin partially inhibited the positive inotropic effect of insulin; although insulin enhanced p-Akt levels at all time points compared with the control group, this increase was suppressed in the presence of wortmannin. The positive inotropic effect of insulin is dose-dependent and consistent with Akt activation. This effect mediated by high doses of insulin on cardiac tissue was temporary and caused tachyphylaxis, potentially triggered by Akt overactivation, which leads beta 1 deactivation.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-06-14", "authors": ["YosukeNakadate", "AkikoKawakami", "HiroakiSato", "TamakiSato", "TakeshiOguchi", "KeisukeOmiya", "ToruMatsuoka", "ThomasSchricker", "TakashiMatsukawa"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-14092-2\n10.1016/1053-0770(93)90094-2\n10.1093/bja/56.7.767\n10.1016/0014-2999(72)90137-9\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1976.230.5.1360\n10.1007/BF03091759\n10.1152/physrev.00024.2010\n10.1016/S0168-8227(11)70019-5\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302589\n10.1016/j.vascn.2006.05.006\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1967.212.4.804\n10.1155/2014/536510\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00229-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.497461\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1107\n10.1083/jcb.200805063\n10.1074/jbc.RA120.014054\n10.1016/j.lfs.2012.07.026\n10.1007/s00395-002-0350-2\n10.1016/0167-5273(93)90170-L\n10.7554/eLife.26896\n10.1093/cvr/cvp014\n10.1161/01.RES.0000150049.74539.8a\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2019.08.013\n10.1085/jgp.201812293"}

The hearts and aortic arteries of male Wistar rats were removed for use in biochemical analysis and vascular reactivity. Both tissues were exposed to P. albidus extract at different concentrations for 30 min and were then exposed to a free radical generation system for 30 min. The extract reduced lipid peroxidation levels and increased catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity in cardiac tissue. In the aorta, P. albidus extract demonstrated a direct vasodilatory effect, which was associated with a reduction in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) activity and an increase in sulfhydryl levels and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Our findings suggest that P. albidus extract has regulatory potential on aorta arteries, regulating the balance of NOX/NOS enzymes and then influencing vessel tone.

Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-protein-coding RNAs. Many miRNAs have been reported to play a key role in the progression of myocardial hypertrophy. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether lncRNA reprogramming regulators (ROR) promotes hypoxic injury in cardiomyocytes by targeting and regulating the miR-145/HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) axis.\nA mouse model of myocardial hypertrophy was established by conventional TAC method, and the cardiomyocytes were isolated. We transfected pcDNA3.0-ROR vector, pcDNA3.0-HAX-1 vector plasmid, and miR-145 simulant into cardiomyocytes with Lipofectamine 2000. Luciferase reporter gene was used to analyze the targeting relationship between genes.\nThe expression of ROR in hypertrophic myocardium was significantly increased after phenylephrine (PE) intervention. After transfection with si-ROR, the ROR expression in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes treated with PE decreased significantly. Levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), creatine kinase (CK) decreased and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased. The expression of miR-145 in cardiomyocytes was significantly down-regulated after PE treatment. In hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, after up-regulating the expression of miR-145, the relative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expressions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) induced by PE decreased. Compared with the miR-NC group, wild type (WT)-ROR activity in the miR-145 group was significantly inhibited (P<0.05), and mutant (MUT)-ROR activity had no significant change (P>0.05). When cardiomyocytes were transfected with HAX-1 3'URT WT vector along with miR-145 simulant, miR-145 inhibitor, and their respective controls. Compared with the control groups, the luciferase activity of cells transfected with simulant was significantly decreased (P<0.05), and increased in inhibitor group (P<0.05).

Finally, RT-PCR, immunofluorescence double and immunohistochemistry were conducted to analyze the expression level of the identification of featured immune-related genes and localization relationship in heart tissue of AMI mouse model.\nA total of 496 immune-related DEGs were obtained between AMI and normal samples. WGCNA finally determined the co-expression modules that showed the most significantly positively associated with AMI (r=0.41; P<0.001). Among the five ML models, XGBoost had the highest AUC (0.849) and accuracy (0.812) to discriminate patients with AMI from normal in the validation sets. Furthermore, we found that the proportion of chemokine receptor (CCR), macrophages, neutrophils, and Treg cells in the AMI groups was significantly higher than that in the normal groups. In vitro RT-PCR verification revealed that \nImmune-related genes and immune cells are intimately related to AMI.

Ideally, the differentiation protocol avoids animal-derived components such as fetal serum and yields ECs at efficiencies that make further sorting obsolete for most applications.\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are cultured under serum-free conditions and induced into mesodermal progenitor cells via stimulation of Wnt signaling for 24\u00a0h.

Cell sheet technology is a tissue engineering methodology requiring scaffolds free, and it provides an effective method for cell transplantation. To improve the therapeutic efficacy, we combined hUC-MSCs with cell sheet technology to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSC sheets in preclinical studies using appropriate animal models.\nhUC-MSC sheets were fabricated by hUC-MSCs from a cell bank established by a standard operation process and quality control. Cytokine secretion, immunoregulation, and angiopoiesis were evaluated in vitro. Oncogenicity and cell diffusion assays of hUC-MSC sheets were conducted to verify the safety of hUC-MSCs sheet transplantation in mice. To provide more meaningful animal experimental data for clinical trials, porcine myocardial infarction (MI) models were established by constriction of the left circumflex, and hUC-MSC sheets were transplanted onto the ischemic area of the heart tissue. Cardiac function was evaluated and compared between the experimental and MI groups.\nThe in vitro results showed that hUC-MSC sheets could secrete multiple cellular factors, including VEGF, HGF, IL-6, and IL-8. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells had a lower proliferation rate and lower TNF-\u03b1 secretion when co-cultured with hUC-MSC sheets. TH1 cells had a smaller proportion after activation. In vivo safety results showed that the hUC-MSCs sheet had no oncogenicity and was mainly distributed on the surface of the ischemic myocardial tissue. Echocardiography showed that hUC-MSC sheets effectively improved the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and the LVEF significantly changed (42.25\u2009\u00b1\u20091.23% vs. 66.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.10%) in the hUC-MSC transplantation group compared with the MI group (42.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.65% vs. 39.55\u2009\u00b1\u20091.97%) at 9\u00a0weeks.

{"title": "LSD1 regulates the expressions of core cardiogenic transcription factors and cardiac genes in oxygen and glucose deprivation injured mice fibroblasts in vitro.", "abstract": "Cardiac reprogramming has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to regenerating the damaged heart by directly converting endogenous cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Cardiac reprogramming requires the activation of the cardiogenic transcriptional program in concert with the repression of the fibroblastic transcriptional program. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays an instrumental role in many physiological processes such as cell growth, differentiation and metabolism. The epigenetic modifications of histones are essential for the accurate expression of genes in cardiomyocytes and the normal functioning of the heart. However, the effect of LSD1 in regulating the cardiogenic transcriptional program under myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unclear. Thus, mice I/R injury was induced by 4 and 24\u00a0h reperfusion after 1-h occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The primary CFs and CMs were exposed under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic I/R injury. The expression of LSD1 significantly decreased in I/R injured heart tissue and OGD-injured primary CFs and CM, and methylated histone presented a notable increase in OGD-injured primary CFs. Overexpression of LSD1 inhibited the injury of primary CFs induced by OGD, but showed limited inhibition on injured primary CMs. Under the OGD condition, LSD1 overexpression significantly increased cell viability, decreased cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of primary CFs. The expression of core cardiogenic transcription factors and cardiac genes were significantly decreased in OGD injured primary CFs, whereas LSD1 overexpression reversed the decrease of transcription factors and cardiac genes under the OGD condition. In conclusion, the overexpression of LSD1 has a protective role in I/R injury by inhibiting the histone methylation of primary CFs and regulates the expressions of core cardiogenic transcription factors and cardiac genes, which can prove to be a potential approach for direct cardiac reprogramming.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["YiqiuCao", "ZhuDong", "DongpengYang", "XimiaoMa", "XiaowuWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2022.113228"}

Whether and how asthma causes heart failure is the subject of debate. Here, we aimed to investigate the possibility of cardiomyocyte mitophagy in a rat model of asthma. Twelve mature Wistar rats were randomly allocated into the Control and Asthmatic rats (n\u2009=\u20096). To induce asthma, ovalbumin was injected intraperitoneally on days 1 and 8 and procedure followed by nebulization from days 14 to 32. After 2 weeks, we performed the pathological examination of both lungs and heart using Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. Real-time PCR analysis was used to measure the expression of mitophagic factors, such as Optineurin, Pink1, and mitofusin 1 and 2. Typical changes like increased inter-alveolar septa thickness and interstitial pneumonia were evident in asthmatic lungs. In cardiac tissue, slight inflammatory response, and hydropic degeneration with an eosinophilic appearance were detected in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. Real-time PCR analysis showed mitophagic response in pulmonary and cardiac tissues via upregulation of mitophagy-related genes like Optineurin and Pink-1 in asthmatic lungs and hearts compared to the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Likewise, asthmatic changes increased the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial fusion in the lungs and heart.

{"title": "Real-Time Optical Mapping of Contracting Cardiac Tissues With GPU-Accelerated Numerical Motion Tracking.", "abstract": "Optical mapping of action potentials or calcium transients in contracting cardiac tissues are challenging because of the severe sensitivity of the measurements to motion. The measurements rely on the accurate numerical tracking and analysis of fluorescence changes emitted by the tissue as it moves, and inaccurate or no tracking can produce motion artifacts and lead to imprecise measurements that can prohibit the analysis of the data. Recently, it was demonstrated that numerical motion-tracking and -stabilization can effectively inhibit motion artifacts, allowing highly detailed simultaneous measurements of electrophysiological phenomena and tissue mechanics. However, the field of electromechanical optical mapping is still young and under development. To date, the technique is only used by a few laboratories, the processing of the video data is time-consuming and performed offline post-acquisition as it is associated with a considerable demand for computing power. In addition, a systematic review of numerical motion tracking algorithms applicable to optical mapping data is lacking. To address these issues, we evaluated 5 open-source numerical motion-tracking algorithms implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU) and compared their performance when tracking and compensating motion and measuring optical traces in voltage- or calcium-sensitive optical mapping videos of contracting cardiac tissues. Using GPU-accelerated numerical motion tracking, the processing times necessary to analyze optical mapping videos become substantially reduced. We demonstrate that it is possible to track and stabilize motion and create motion-compensated optical maps in real-time with low-resolution (128 x 128 pixels) and high resolution (800 x 800 pixels) optical mapping videos acquired at 500 and 40 fps, respectively. We evaluated the tracking accuracies and motion-stabilization capabilities of the GPU-based algorithms on synthetic optical mapping videos, determined their sensitivity to fluorescence signals and noise, and demonstrate the efficacy of the Farneb\u00e4ck algorithm with recordings of contracting human cardiac cell cultures and beating hearts from 3 different species (mouse, rabbit, pig) imaged with 4 different high-speed cameras. GPU-accelerated processing provides a substantial increase in processing speed, which could open the path for more widespread use of numerical motion tracking and stabilization algorithms during routine optical mapping studies.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["JanLebert", "NamitaRavi", "GeorgeKensah", "JanChristoph"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2022.787627\n10.1152/ajpheart.1987.252.2.H384\n10.1038/355349a0\n10.1161/01.CIR.90.3.1469\n10.1038/32170\n10.1038/32164\n10.1038/nature26001\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00344\n10.7554/eLife.28307\n10.3390/hearts1030018\n10.1016/S0006-3495(94)80602-2\n10.1073/pnas.95.17.10283\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2005.10.003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.247494\n10.1152/ajpheart.01415.2006\n10.1109/TBME.2004.840464\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01483\n10.1152/ajpheart.00477.2021\n10.1016/j.bpj.2016.03.043\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.09.015\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00464\n10.1038/srep43217\n10.3389/fphys.2021.696270\n10.1038/s41566-019-0474-7\n10.1016/j.bpr.2022.100046\n10.4249/scholarpedia.30724\n10.1016/j.cviu.2015.02.008\n10.1016/j.image.2018.12.002\n10.1007/0-387-28831-7_15\n10.1177/1535370219894942\n10.1117/1.3630115\n10.1111/nmo.13449\n10.1007/s10439-014-1172-8\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2364959\n10.7150/thno.53883\n10.1016/0004-3702(81)90024-2\n10.5201/ipol.2013.26\n10.1109/TBME.2011.2148719\n10.1117/12.408594"}
{"title": "Biomedical Applications of Polyhydroxyalkanoate in Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering technology aids in the regeneration of new tissue to replace damaged or wounded tissue. Three-dimensional biodegradable and porous scaffolds are often utilized in this area to mimic the structure and function of the extracellular matrix. Scaffold material and design are significant areas of biomaterial research and the most favorable material for seeding of in vitro and in vivo cells. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biopolyesters (thermoplastic) that are appropriate for this application due to their biodegradability, thermo-processability, enhanced biocompatibility, mechanical properties, non-toxicity, and environmental origin. Additionally, they offer enormous potential for modification through biological, chemical and physical alteration, including blending with various other materials. PHAs are produced by bacterial fermentation under nutrient-limiting circumstances and have been reported to offer new perspectives for devices in biological applications. The present review discusses PHAs in the applications of conventional medical devices, especially for soft tissue (sutures, wound dressings, cardiac patches and blood vessels) and hard tissue (bone and cartilage scaffolds) regeneration applications. The paper also addresses a recent advance highlighting the usage of PHAs in implantable devices, such as heart valves, stents, nerve guidance conduits and nanoparticles, including drug delivery. This review summarizes the in vivo and in vitro biodegradability of PHAs and conducts an overview of current scientific research and achievements in the development of PHAs in the biomedical sector. In the future, PHAs may replace synthetic plastics as the material of choice for medical researchers and practitioners.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors":

{"title": "Isogenic GAA-KO Murine Muscle Cell Lines Mimicking Severe Pompe Mutations as Preclinical Models for the Screening of Potential Gene Therapy Strategies.", "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene. Most gene therapies (GT) partially rely on the cross-correction of unmodified cells through the uptake of the GAA enzyme secreted by corrected cells. In the present study, we generated isogenic murine GAA-KO cell lines resembling severe mutations from Pompe patients. All of the generated GAA-KO cells lacked GAA activity and presented an increased autophagy and increased glycogen content by means of myotube differentiation as well as the downregulation of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPRs), validating them as models for PD. Additionally, different chimeric murine GAA proteins (IFG, IFLG and 2G) were designed with the aim to improve their therapeutic activity. Phenotypic rescue analyses using lentiviral vectors point to IFG chimera as the best candidate in restoring GAA activity, normalising the autophagic marker p62 and surface levels of CI-MPRs. Interestingly, in vivo administration of liver-directed AAVs expressing the chimeras further confirmed the good behaviour of IFG, achieving cross-correction in heart tissue. In summary, we generated different isogenic murine muscle cell lines mimicking the severe PD phenotype, as well as validating their applicability as preclinical models in order to reduce animal experimentation.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["AraceliAguilar-Gonz\u00e1lez", "Juan El\u00edasGonz\u00e1lez-Correa", "ElianaBarriocanal-Casado", "IrisRamos-Hern\u00e1ndez", "Miguel ALerma-Ju\u00e1rez", "SaraGreco", "Juan Jos\u00e9Rodr\u00edguez-Sevilla", "Francisco JavierMolina-Est\u00e9vez", "ValleMontalvo-Romeral", "GiuseppeRonzitti", "Rosario Mar\u00edaS\u00e1nchez-Mart\u00edn", "FranciscoMart\u00edn", "PilarMu\u00f1oz"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23116298\n10.1007/s13311-018-0655-y\n10.4161/auto.2984\n10.1093/hmg/ddn292\n10.3390/biomedicines10020302\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.02.004\n10.1097/01.gim.0000218152.87434.f3\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)53985-5\n10.1074/jbc.M404008200\n10.1007/s11626-008-9138-5\n10.2174/1566524024605789\n10.1126/science.162.3853.570\n10.1002/humu.23878\n10.3390/genes11020135\n10.3389/fnagi.2014.00177\n10.1136/jmg.32.10.836-a\n10.1002/humu.23854\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2009.08.003\n10.1097/GIM.0b013e3182174703\n10.1212/WNL.0000000000004711\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.01.012\n10.1038/mt.2009.305\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.04.024\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aam6375\n10.1038/mtm.2015.7\n10.1002/jgm.1305\n10.1073/pnas.94.8.4080\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30374-9\n10.21037/atm.2019.04.18\n10.1073/pnas.88.12.5096\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2008.12.012\n10.1016/j.scr.2019.101435\n10.3389/fcell.2019.00316\n10.3390/cells8050403\n10.1002/stem.2112\n10.1002/emmm.201202176\n10.1074/jbc.M112.438663\n10.1002/humu.20745\n10.5414/CPP47042\n10.1016/j.cmet.2009.10.008\n10.1038/cdd.2012.52\n10.1186/1755-8417-1-6\n10.1042/bj2930713\n10.1093/nar/gky571\n10.1073/pnas.0308728100\n10.1016/0022-2836(82)90515-0\n10.1101/2021.12.28.474352\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.05.020\n10.1016/j.medcle.2019.03.034\n10.1186/s13023-021-01864-8\n10.15252/emmm.202114434\n10.1038/s41598-017-14063-y\n10.1074/jbc.M114.628628\n10.1146/annurev.bi.61.070192.001515\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.08.009\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.09.015\n10.1007/s00415-016-8219-8\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2016.03.006\n10.1089/hum.2018.197\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.02.006\n10.1242/dev.110.1.151\n10.1093/nar/gky354\n10.1101/251082\n10.1002/psc.2430\n10.1093/nar/gky1049\n10.1093/nar/gks400\n10.1038/srep37289\n10.1038/mtm.2016.49\n10.1016/j.omtm.2018.12.011\n10.1074/jbc.273.30.19086\n10.15252/emmm.202113968\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2005.10.016\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.05.025"}

{"title": "Circulating miRNA Fingerprint and Endothelial Function in Myocardial Infarction: Comparison at Acute Event and One-Year Follow-Up.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNA) are major regulators of intercellular communication and key players in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to determine the miRNA fingerprint in a cohort of 53 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTEMI) relative to miRNA expression in healthy controls (n = 51). miRNA expression was initially profiled by miRNA array in the serum of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization during NSTEMI (n = 8) and 1 year past the event (follow-up, n = 8) and validated in the entire cohort. In total, 58 miRNAs were differentially expressed during AMI (p < 0.05), while 36 were modified at follow-up (Fisher\u2019s exact test: p = 0.0138). Enrichment analyses revealed differential regulation of biological processes by miRNA at each specific time point (AMI vs. follow-up). During AMI, the miRNA profile was associated mainly with processes involved in vascular development. However, 1 year after AMI, changes in miRNA expression were partially related to the regulation of cardiac tissue morphogenesis. Linear correlation analysis of miRNA with serum levels of cytokines and chemokines revealed that let-7g-5p, let-7e-5p, and miR-26a-5p expression was inversely associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, and the chemokines MCP-3 and MDC. Transient transfection of human endothelial cells (HUVEC) with let-7e-5p inhibitor or mimic demonstrated a key role for this miRNA in endothelial function regulation in terms of cell adhesion and angiogenesis capacity.

{"title": "Cellular and Engineered Organoids for Cardiovascular Models.", "abstract": "An ensemble of in vitro cardiac tissue models has been developed over the past several decades to aid our understanding of complex cardiovascular disorders using a reductionist approach. These approaches often rely on recapitulating single or multiple clinically relevant end points in a dish indicative of the cardiac pathophysiology. The possibility to generate disease-relevant and patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells has further leveraged the utility of the cardiac models as screening tools at a large scale. To elucidate biological mechanisms in the cardiac models, it is critical to integrate physiological cues in form of biochemical, biophysical, and electromechanical stimuli to achieve desired tissue-like maturity for a robust phenotyping. Here, we review the latest advances in the directed stem cell differentiation approaches to derive a wide gamut of cardiovascular cell types, to allow customization in cardiac model systems, and to study diseased states in multiple cell types. We also highlight the recent progress in the development of several cardiovascular models, such as cardiac organoids, microtissues, engineered heart tissues, and microphysiological systems. We further expand our discussion on defining the context of use for the selection of currently available cardiac tissue models.

Our results indicated that dapagliflozin significantly alleviated the severity of viral myocarditis, elevated the survival rate, and ameliorated cardiac function. Besides, dapagliflozin can decrease the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, dapagliflozin can inhibit macrophages differentiate to classically activated macrophages (M1) in cardiac tissue and activate the Stat3 signal pathway which is reported to promote polarization of the alternatively activated macrophage (M2).

{"title": "[Fucoxanthin regulates Nrf2/Keap1 signaling to alleviate myocardial hypertrophy in diabetic rats].", "abstract": "To investigate the protective effect of fucoxanthin (FX) against diabetic cardiomyopathy and explore the underlying mechanism.\nRat models of diabetes mellitus (DM) induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) were randomized into DM model group, fucoxanthin treatment (DM+FX) group and metformin treatment (DM+ Met) group, and normal rats with normal feeding served as the control group. In the two treatment groups, fucoxanthin and metformin were administered after modeling by gavage at the daily dose of 200 mg/kg and 230 mg/kg, respectively for 12 weeks, and the rats in the DM model group were given saline only. HE staining was used to examine the area of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in each group. The expression levels of fibrotic proteins TGF-\u03b21 and FN proteins in rat hearts were detected with Western blotting. In the cell experiment, the effect of 1 \u03bcmol/L FX on H9C2 cell hypertrophy induced by exposure to high glucose (HG, 45 mmol/L) was evaluated using FITC-labeled phalloidin. The mRNA expression levels of the hypertrophic factors ANP, BNP and \u03b2-MHC in H9C2 cells were detected using qRT-PCR. The protein expressions of Nrf2, Keap1, HO-1 and SOD1 proteins in rat heart tissues and H9C2 cells were determined using Western blotting. The DCFH-DA probe was used to detect the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).\nIn the diabetic rats, fucoxanthin treatment obviously alleviated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, increased the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1, and decreased the protein expressions of Keap1 in the heart tissue (\nFucoxanthin possesses strong inhibitory activities against diabetic cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis and is capable of up-regulating Nrf2 signaling to promote the expression of its downstream antioxidant proteins SOD1 and HO-1 to reduce the level of ROS.\n\u63a2\u7d22\u8910\u85fb\u7d20\uff08FX\uff09\u5bf9\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5fc3\u808c\u75c5\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002\n\u8179\u8154\u6ce8\u5c04\u94fe\u8132\u4f50\u83cc\u7d20\u5efa\u7acb\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5927\u9f20\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\uff1a\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ec4\uff08DM\uff09\u3001\u8910\u85fb\u7d20\u5e72\u9884\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ec4\uff08DM+FX\uff09\u548c\u4e8c\u7532\u53cc\u80cd\u5e72\u9884\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ec4\uff08DM+Met\uff09\uff0c\u53e6\u53d6\u6b63\u5e38\u5927\u9f20\u7ed9\u4e88\u6b63\u5e38\u5582\u517b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4\uff08Con\uff09\u3002\u9020\u6a21\u6210\u529f\u540e\u8fde\u7eed12\u5468\u6bcf\u65e5\u704c\u80c3\u7ed9\u836f\uff0c\u8910\u85fb\u7d20\u7ec4\u6bcf\u65e5\u7ed9\u4e88200 mg/kg\u8910\u85fb\u7d20\u704c\u80c3\uff0c\u4e8c\u7532\u53cc\u80cd\u7ec4\u6bcf\u65e5\u7ed9\u4e88230 mg/kg\u704c\u80c3\uff0c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ec4\u540c\u6b65\u704c\u80c3\u751f\u7406\u76d0\u6c34\u3002HE\u67d3\u8272\u89c2\u5bdf\u5404\u7ec4\u5927\u9f20\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec6\u80de\u80a5\u5927\u60c5\u51b5\uff1bWestern blot\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u9f20\u5fc3\u810f\u4e2d\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u86cb\u767dTGF-\u03b21\u548cFN\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u3002H9C2\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u4e3a3\u7ec4\uff1a\u6b63\u5e38\u7cd6\u7ec4\uff08NG\uff0c5.5 mmol/L\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\uff09\u3001\u9ad8\u7cd6\u7ec4\uff08HG\uff0c45 mmol/L\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\uff09\u548c\u8910\u85fb\u7d20\u5e72\u9884\u9ad8\u7cd6\u7ec4\uff08HG+1 \u03bcmol/L FX\uff09\u3002FITC\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u9b3c\u7b14\u73af\u80bd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u9f20\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec6\u80deH9C2\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u53d8\u5316\uff1bqRT-PCR\u6cd5\u6d4b\u5b9a\u5404\u7ec4\u7ec6\u80de\u80a5\u5927\u56e0\u5b50ANP\u3001BNP\u548c\u03b2-MHC\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u53d8\u5316\uff1bWestern blot\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5404\u7ec4\u5927\u9f20\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548cH9C2\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2dNrf2\u3001Keap1\u3001HO-1\u3001SOD1\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\uff1bDCFH-DA\u63a2\u9488\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u5185\u6d3b\u6027\u6c27\u6c34\u5e73\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n\u8910\u85fb\u7d20\u6539\u5584\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5927\u9f20\u5fc3\u808c\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u548c\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec6\u80de\u80a5\u5927\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0a\u8c03\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2dNrf2\u548cHO-1\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u6291\u5236Keap1\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\uff08\n\u8910\u85fb\u7d20\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6297\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5fc3\u808c\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u548c\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec6\u80de\u80a5\u5927\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0a\u8c03Nrf2\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e0b\u6e38\u6297\u6c27\u5316\u86cb\u767dSOD1\u548cHO-1\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6d3b\u6027\u6c27\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "journal": "Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University", "date": "2022-06-09", "authors": ["DZheng", "LChen", "QWei", "ZZhu", "ZLiu", "LJin", "GYang", "XXie"], "doi": "10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2022.05.18\n10.1038/s41569-020-0339-2\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.04.005\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.00562\n10.1002/ejhf.696\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034609\n10.1159/000445624\n10.1271/bbb.63.605\n10.1016/j.abb.2010.05.031\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.019\n10.1007/s00018-016-2223-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311586\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa233\n10.1152/ajpheart.00578.2001\n10.1177/0284185120933530\n10.1007/s10741-011-9257-z\n10.3390/ijms22105094\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.075\n10.1111/jcmm.14870\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx511\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.01.003\n10.1080/21691401.2019.1657879\n10.1093/abbs/gmw025\n10.3390/md17120702"}
{"title": "Putative effect of melatonin on cardiomyocyte senescence in mice with type 1 diabetes mellitus.", "abstract": "To date, many investigators have tried to clarify the molecular mechanism of cardiovascular injuries after T1D. In present study, we evaluated the possible effects of melatonin on the levels of aging-related factors in the heart tissue of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.\n40 male mice were enrolled in this study and randomly allocated into 4 groups (n\u2009=\u200910) as follows: Control group (C), Control group + melatonin (CM), Diabetic group (D), Diabetic + melatonin (DM) group. Single Streptozotocin (50\u00a0mg/kbW) was applied for the induction of T1D. 3\u00a0mg/kg melatonin was injected intraperitoneally twice a week for consequent four weeks. After the completion of this period, the animals were sacrificed and their heart tissue was obtained for histological examination (IHC analysis of vWF and \u03b1-SMA cells), aging and inflammation-related gene analysis.\nHematoxylin and Eosin staining indicated cardiomyocyte toxicity in T1D mice. IHC analysis of vascular tissue showed the detachment of vWF and \u03b1-SMA cells and disintegration into the vascular lumen. Additionally, real-time PCR assay showed the up-regulation of \u03b2-galactosidase and suppression of SOX2, Klotho, and Telomerase genes in T1D mice compared to the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). We noted that melatonin administration can revert these condition and closed near-to-control levels. Along with these conditions, the levels of IL-1\u03b2 were also decreased after melatonin treatment.\nIn general, one can hypothesize\u00a0that modulation of different effectors associated\u00a0with aging is beneficial to alleviate cardiac injuries under hypergylcemic condition.

Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been proposed as alternative biomarkers for MI diagnosis; however, detecting the changes in the human cardiac miRNA profile during MI is extremely difficult. Here, to study the changes in miRNA levels during acute MI, a heart-on-chip model with a cardiac channel, containing human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes in human heart decellularized matrix and collagen, and a vascular channel, containing hiPSC-derived endothelial cells, is developed. This model is exposed to anoxia followed by normoxia to mimic ischemia and reperfusion, respectively. Using a highly sensitive miRNA biosensor that the authors developed, the exact same increase in miR-1, miR-208b, and miR-499 levels in the MI-on-chip and the time-matched human blood plasma samples collected before and after ischemia and reperfusion, is shown. That the surface marker profile of exosomes in the engineered model changes in response to ischemic and reperfusion injury, which can be used as biomarkers to detect MI, is also shown. Hence, the MI-on-chip model developed here can be used in biomarker discovery.", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2022-06-08", "authors": ["Bradley WEllis", "GeorgeRonan", "XiangRen", "GokhanBahcecioglu", "SatyajyotiSenapati", "DavidAnderson", "EileenHandberg", "Keith LMarch", "Hsueh-ChiaChang", "PinarZorlutuna"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.202201330\n10.3791/56482\n10.1002/0471141755.ph1208s25\n10.1111/jcmm.13032"}
{"title": "Deep sequencing unveils altered cardiac miRNome in congenital heart disease.", "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) surges from fetal cardiac dysmorphogenesis and chiefly contributes to perinatal morbidity and cardiovascular disease mortality. A continual rise in prevalence and prerequisite postoperative disease management creates need for better understanding and new strategies to control the disease. The interaction between genetic and non-genetic factors roots the multifactorial status of this disease, which remains incompletely explored. The small non-coding microRNAs (miRs, miRNAs) regulate several biological processes via post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Abnormal expression of miRs in developing and adult heart is associated with anomalous cardiac cell differentiation, cardiac dysfunction, and cardiovascular diseases. Here, we attempt to discover the changes in cardiac miRNA transcriptome in CHD patients over those without CHD (non-CHD) and find its role in CHD through functional annotation. This study explores the miRNome in three most commonly occurring CHD subtypes, namely atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and tetralogy of fallot (TOF). We found 295 dysregulated miRNAs through high-throughput sequencing of the cardiac tissues. The bioinformatically predicted targets of these differentially expressed miRs were functionally annotated to know they were entailed in cell signal regulatory pathways, profoundly responsible for cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, migration and cell cycle regulation. Selective miRs (hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-218-5p, hsa-miR-873-5p) whose expression was validated by qRT-PCR, have been reported for cardiogenesis, cardiomyocyte proliferation, cardioprotection and cardiac dysfunction. These results indicate that the altered miRNome to be responsible for the disease status in CHD patients. Our data expand the existing knowledge on the epigenetic changes in CHD. In future, characterization of these cardiac-specific miRs will add huge potential to understand cardiac development, function, and molecular pathogenesis of heart diseases with a prospect of epigenetic manipulation for cardiac repair.", "journal": "Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG", "date": "2022-06-07", "authors": ["VinuRamachandran", "SambhaviBhagavatheeswaran", "SambanthamShanmugam", "MadavanVasudevan", "MalathiRagunathan", "Kotturathu MammenCherian", "Arasambattu KannanMunirajan", "SudeshRavi", "AnandanBalakrishnan"], "doi": "10.1007/s00438-022-01908-z\n10.1186/s12967-017-1213-9\n10.1038/nm1084\n10.1016/j.jprot.2018.03.022\n10.26355/eurrev_202012_24191\n10.3892/or.2015.3861\n10.1007/s11010-017-3146-2\n10.1016/j.cca.2006.12.021\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.08.033\n10.1186/s12864-019-5548-x\n10.3390/cells8070737\n10.1038/s41598-020-62534-6\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.772336\n10.1007/s00246-015-1174-9\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.08.031\n10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x\n10.1016/j.hfc.2013.09.017\n10.1080/08977194.2016.1191480\n10.1242/dev.060046\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.110\n10.1080/13102818.2019.1591932\n10.21037/jtd.2017.03.149\n10.3390/diseases7030052\n10.1371/journal.pone.0119646\n10.1096/fj.201601140RR\n10.1002/clc.23173\n10.1111/jcmm.12309\n10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4\n10.3390/ijms17060848\n10.1093/ije/dyz009\n10.1113/JP276072\n10.1038/s41467-021-21892-z\n10.1186/s12885-019-6249-1\n10.1186/s13287-019-1451-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.248880\n10.3389/fped.2020.00040\n10.1007/978-1-4757-4441-5_12\n10.1007/BF00796326\n10.1186/s43042-020-0050-1\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00263\n10.2174/1381612827666210929111622\n10.1016/j.gene.2015.09.016\n10.1038/srep20968\n10.1479/mdcj-14-1-60\n10.1042/CS20180842\n10.3390/ijms17050789\n10.1111/cpr.12764\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.113\n10.1016/j.gene.2017.05.062\n10.1002/cbin.11706\n10.12659/MSM.895753\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.05.018"}
{"title": "Exploring the role of ferroptosis in the doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiotoxicity using a murine model.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective antitumor drug; however, but its clinical application is seriously limited by the cardiotoxicity induced by its use. Recent studies have found that ferroptosis is an important mechanism underlying DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, existing studies are based on DOX-induced acute or subacute cardiotoxicity model. Therefore, we established a murine model of DOX-induced chronic cardiotoxicity using the clinically relevant cumulative dose, to evaluate the potential molecular mechanism underlying ferroptosis of cardiomycocytes. Male C57 mice were received intraperitoneal injections of DOX at a dose of 3\u202fmg/kg body weight, once a week for 12 weeks. We dynamically analysed echocardiographic findings, serum myocardial enzyme levels, haematological indexes and cardiac histopathological changes. The results showed that, after receiving a cumulative DOX dose of 15\u202fmg/kg, the mice developed anaemia and the function and structure of the heart changed significantly with an increase in the cumulative DOX dose. Importantly, with a cumulative DOX dose of 36\u202fmg/kg, iron overload occurred in the heart tissue. Moreover, RNA-sequencing analysis and experimental verification revealed that ferropotosis is the underlying mechanism of DOX-induced chronic cardiotoxicity. Our results showed that DOX inhibits Slc7a11 in system-Xc, resulting in the reduction of GSH synthesis to prevent GPX4 from scavenging lipid peroxides. In addition, DOX induced the occurrence of ferroptosis via down-regulating Nrf2 expression to inhibit HO-1 and GPx4 levels. Our study provides a new perspective for evaluating the pathophysiology of DOX-induced chronic cardiotoxicity in the future, and developing new potential therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2022-06-07", "authors": ["XiaofenLi", "JiyiLiang", "LipingQu", "SiliLiu", "AnquanQin", "HonglinLiu", "TaoWang", "WeiLi", "WenjunZou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2022.110008"}
{"title": "A case of a death caused by an atrial-oesophageal-thoracic fistula after radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation.", "abstract": "The report is about a 49-year-old man with rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation. He underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valvuloplasty, and atrial fibrillation radiofrequency ablation in the hospital. He vomited blood on the 2nd postoperative day, and the bleeding gradually worsened thereafter. He had to have repeated drainage of large amounts of blood from his right thoracic cavity and digestive tract. He died suddenly after undergoing an oesophageal endoscopy on the 24th postoperative day. The autopsy revealed an atrial-oesophageal-thoracic fistula. By excluding the possibility of the fistula being caused by complications from nasoenteric feeding, tracheal intubation, and a foreign body ingestion, we determined that the atrial-oesophageal-thoracic fistula was a complication after radiofrequency ablation according to the finding of coagulation necrosis of the myocardial cells at the left atrium fistula. In addition, we also performed an elemental analysis on the radiofrequency ablation area and other cardiac tissues by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and found five metal elements, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Ti, which specifically existed in the radiofrequency ablation area. This finding has the potential to serve as new evidence for radiofrequency ablation and is a worthy direction of research.", "journal": "Journal of forensic and legal medicine", "date": "2022-06-07", "authors": ["Qi-LongWu", "QiWang", "Gao-XianGuo", "Yong-GuoLi", "YuXing", "Min-ZhuZhao", "HongweiLi", "Jian-BoLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jflm.2022.102374"}

Ovariectomized Sprague Dawley rats were orally given either a hormone replacement therapy (1\u00a0mg/kg/day,17\u03b2 estradiol; HRT) or melatonin (4\u00a0mg/kg/day) or HRT\u2009+\u2009melatonin treatments or tap water, while each group was further divided into sedentary and exercise (30\u00a0min/5\u00a0days/week) groups. After the heart rate measurements and memory tests were performed, trunk blood was collected at the end of the 10th week to determine metabolic parameters in serum samples. Tissue samples of abdominal aorta, heart, and brain were taken for biochemical measurements and histopathological evaluation. Heart rates and memory performances of the OVX rats were not changed significantly by none of the applications. Melatonin treatment or its co-administration with HRT upregulated the expressions of IL-10 and SIRT1, reduced the expressions of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and reduced DNA damage in the hearts and thoracic aortae of non-exercised rats. Co-administration of melatonin and HRT to exercised OVX rats reduced inflammatory response and upregulated SIRT1 expression in the aortic and cardiac tissues. The present study suggests that melatonin treatment, either alone or in combination with exercise and/or HRT, upregulates SIRT1 expression and alleviates oxidative injury and inflammation in the hearts and aortas of OVX rats.

{"title": "Changes in the Left Ventricular Eicosanoid Profile in Human Dilated Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Metabolites derived from \nLeft ventricular tissues obtained from non-failing control (NFC) or DCM explanted hearts, were assessed for \nFormation of cardioprotective CYP-derived lipid mediators, epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs), and their corresponding diols were enhanced in DCM hearts. These findings were corroborated by increased expression of CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 enzymes, as well as microsomal and soluble epoxide hydrolase enzymes, suggesting enhanced metabolic flux and EpFA substrate turnover. DCM hearts demonstrated marked damage to mitochondrial ultrastructure and attenuated mitochondrial function. Incubation of fresh DCM cardiac fibers with the protective EpFA, 19,20-EDP, significantly improved mitochondrial function.\nThe current study demonstrates that increased expressions of CYP-epoxygenase enzymes and epoxide hydrolases in the DCM heart correspond with enhanced PUFA-derived EpFA turnover.

However, non-crosslinked natural scaffolds disfavor application in cardiovascular surgery due to poor biomechanics and rapid degradation. Herein, we proposed a green strategy to crosslink and functionalize acellular scaffolds via the self-assembly of copper@tea polyphenol nanoparticles (Cu@TP NPs), and the resultant nanocomposite acellular scaffolds were named as Cu@TP-dBPs. The crosslinking degree, biomechanics, denaturation temperature and resistance to enzymatic degradation of Cu@TP-dBPs were comparable to those of glutaraldehyde crosslinked decellularized bovine pericardias (Glut-dBPs). Furthermore, Cu@TP-dBPs were biocompatible and had abilities to inhibit bacterial growth and promote the formation of capillary-like networks. Subcutaneous implantation models demonstrated that Cu@TP-dBPs were free of calcification and allowed for host cell infiltration at Day 21. Cardiac patch graft models confirmed that Cu@TP-dBP patches showed improved ingrowth of functional blood vessels and remodeling of extracellular matrix at Day 60. These results suggested that Cu@TP-dBPs not only had comparable biomechanics and biostability to Glut-dBPs, but also had several advantages over Glut-dBPs in terms of anticalcification, remodeling and integration capabilities. Particularly, they were functional patches possessing antibacterial and proangiogenic activities.

Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) is the basic step for every procedure but is still hampered by tools and energy sources that do not lead to durability of isolation. Novel therapies include high power short duration radiofrequency ablation in combination with optimal cooling of the electrode-tissue interface by irrigation or new electrode material to allow for optimal safe energy transfer. Novel tools include competitive balloon catheters using cryoenergy, laser, or radiofrequency current, or linear array ablation with ultralow temperature cryoablation to enhance durability of lesions. A novel energy source is rapidly evolving in the form of pulsed electrical field ablation resulting in irreversible electroporation of cardiac tissue, potentially without collateral side effects. Beyond PV isolation, ablation targets are still under study as standardized addition of lesion lines shows limited benefits. Mapping of the activation pattern during AF to guide patient-specific target ablation has been developing over the last decade, with mixed results by different platforms.

{"title": "Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 protein (CAND1) governs cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure partially through regulating calcineurin degradation.", "abstract": "Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a process characterized by significant disturbance of protein turnover. Cullin-associated and Neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) acts as a coordinator to modulate substrate protein degradation by promoting the formation of specific cullin-based ubiquitin ligase 3 complex in response to substrate accumulation, which thereby facilitate the maintaining of normal protein homeostasis. Accumulation of calcineurin is critical in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. However, whether CAND1 titrates the degradation of hypertrophy related protein eg. calcineurin and regulates cardiac hypertrophy remains unknown. Therefore, we aim to explore the role of CAND1 in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure and the underlying molecular mechanism. Here, we found that the protein level of CAND1 was increased in cardiac tissues from heart failure (HF) patients and TAC mice, whereas the mRNA level did not change. CAND1-KO+\u00a0/- aggravated TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophic phenotypes; in contrast, CAND1-Tg attenuated the maladaptive cardiac remodeling. At the molecular level, CAND1 overexpression downregulated, whereas CAND1-KO+\u00a0/- or knockdown upregulated calcineurin expression at both in vivo and in vitro conditions. Mechanistically, CAND1 overexpression favored the assembly of Cul1/atrogin1/calcineurin complex and rendered the ubiquitination and degradation of calcineurin. Notably, CAND1 deficiency-induced hypertrophic phenotypes were partially rescued by knockdown of calcineurin, and application of exogenous CAND1 prevented TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CAND1 exerts a protective effect against cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure partially by inducing the degradation of calcineurin.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2022-06-07", "authors": ["XingdaLi", "YangZhang", "YueZhao", "YangZhou", "QilongHan", "YingYang", "LingminZhang", "LingShi", "XuexinJin", "RuixinZhang", "HaiyuGao", "GenlongXue", "DeshengLi", "Zhi-RenZhang", "YanjieLu", "BaofengYang", "ZhenweiPan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106284"}

There are two setups for this protocol: heart donor setup and recipient setup. In the heart donor setup, Sprague Dawley rats are anesthetized, endotracheally intubated, and ventilated. The right carotid artery is cannulated to deliver heparin and the paralytic agent vecuronium-bromide. The DCD process is initiated by terminating the ventilation. After 20 min, the heart is exposed and the aorta distal to the brachiocephalic branch is clamped. At 25 min from terminating the ventilator, ice-cold University of Wisconsin (UW) solution is perfused through the carotid catheter to flush the heart. The heart is procured by dividing the aorta, pulmonary artery, venae cavae, and pulmonary veins and stored in UW solution for implantation. In the recipient setup, the Lewis rat is anesthetized with isoflurane. Slow-release buprenorphine is administered subcutaneously to facilitate a smooth postoperative recovery. Through a midline abdominal incision, the infra-renal aorta and the inferior vena cava are isolated and clamped with an atraumatic vascular clamp. The donor heart aorta and pulmonary artery are sutured to the recipient abdominal aorta and vena cava, respectively, with a running 8-0 Prolene. The vascular clamp is removed to reperfuse the heart. The abdominal wall is closed and the rat is recovered. After a set interval (24 h to 2 weeks), the recipient rat is anesthetized, the transplanted heart is exposed, and a balloon-tip-catheter is inserted into the left ventricle via the apex to record developed pressure and dP/dt using a data acquisition system.

{"title": "Glucosylceramide synthase inhibition protects against cardiac hypertrophy in chronic kidney disease.", "abstract": "A significant population of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develops cardiac hypertrophy, which can lead to heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Soluble klotho (sKL), the shed ectodomain of the transmembrane protein klotho, protects the heart against hypertrophic growth. We have shown that sKL protects the heart by regulating the formation and function of lipid rafts by targeting the sialic acid moiety of gangliosides, GM1/GM3. Reduction in circulating sKL contributes to an increased risk of cardiac hypertrophy in mice. sKL replacement therapy has been considered but its use is limited by the inability to mass produce the protein. Therefore, alternative methods to protect the heart are proposed. Glucosylation of ceramide catalyzed by glucosylceramide synthase is the entry step for the formation of gangliosides. Here we show that oral administration of a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor (GCSi) reduces plasma and heart tissue glycosphingolipids, including gangliosides. Administration of GCSi is protective in two mouse models of cardiac stress-induction, one with isoproterenol overstimulation and the other with 5/6 nephrectomy-induced CKD.

Defined fibrotic and necrotic bundles and thick reticulin fibers were also found in BDL liver tissue. Besides liver morphological alterations, left ventricles of BDL ones were also associated with defined cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myofiber vacuolization, and clear pigmentation. Findings showed a significant up-regulation of cardiac Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) along with marked down-regulation in hepatic FXR, cardiac FXR, and cardiac UCP2 and UCP3. However, the expression of caspase 3 in the cardiac tissue was not affected by BDL operation during 4 weeks.\nExpression of FXR as an upstream regulator of cellular redox status, besides the non-enzymatic ROS buffering defense system of cardiac UCPs, has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of cirrhotic-induced cardiac abnormality in rats.", "journal": "Iranian journal of basic medical sciences", "date": "2022-06-04", "authors": ["GholamrezaBayat", "Seyed AliHashemi", "HoseinKarim", "ParvizFallah", "KeshvadHedayatyanfard", "MahnazBayat", "AzadehKhalili"], "doi": "10.22038/IJBMS.2022.60888.13485"}

Driven largely by the needs of pharmaceutical toxicity testing, considerable progress in developing NAMs for cardiotoxicity analysis has already been made. As the scientific and regulatory interest in NAMs for environmental chemicals continues to grow, a thorough understanding of the unique features of environmental cardiotoxicants and their associated cardiotoxicities is needed.

Although a large number of studies have confirmed that NLRP3 inhibitors can improve cardiac remodeling in mice with a normal diet, it is still unclear whether NLRP3 inhibitors can improve heart failure (HF) induced by pressure overload in obese mice. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, on HF in obese mice and its metabolic mechanism. Obese mice induced with a 10-week high-fat diet (HFD) were used in this study. After 4 weeks of HFD, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery was performed to induce a HF model. MCC950 (10 mg/kg, once/day) was injected intraperitoneally from 2 weeks after TAC and continued for 4 weeks. After echocardiography examination, we harvested left ventricle tissues and performed molecular experiments. The results suggest that in obese mice, MCC950 can significantly improve cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis caused by pressure overload. MCC950 ameliorated cardiac inflammation after TAC surgery and promoted M2 macrophage infiltration in the cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Stimulating Calcium Handling in hiPSC-Derived Engineered Cardiac Tissues Enhances Force Production.", "abstract": "Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have profound utility in generating functional human engineered cardiac tissues (ECT) for heart repair. However, the field at large is concerned about the relative immaturity of these hiPSC-CMs as we aim to develop clinically relevant models for regenerative therapy and drug testing. Herein, we develop a novel calcium (Ca2+) conditioning protocol that maintains ECTs in a physiological range of Ca2+ and assesses contractility in increasing calcium environments. Lactate-based selection served as a method to purify and shift the metabolic profile of hiPSC-CMs to evaluate the role of metabolism on Ca2+ sensitivity. After 2 weeks, we observe 2-fold greater peak twitch stress in high-Ca2+ conditioned ECTs, despite having lower stiffness and no change in Ca2+ sensitivity of twitch force. Interestingly, the force-calcium relationship reveals higher Ca2+ sensitivity in lactate conditioned tissues, suggesting that metabolic maturation alters mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering and regulation. Ca2+ sensitivity and force amplitude are not coupled, as lactate conditioned tissues produce force comparable to that of controls in high calcium environments. An upregulation of calcium handling protein gene expression likely contributes to the greater Ca2+ sensitivity in lactate conditioned hiPSC-CMs. Our findings support the use of physiological Ca2+ to enhance the functional maturation of excitation-contraction coupling in hiPSC-CMs and demonstrate that metabolic changes induced by lactate conditioning alter cardiomyocyte sensitivity to external Ca2+. These conditioning methods may be used to advance the development of engineered human cardiac tissue for translational applications in vitro and in vivo as a regenerative therapy.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2022-06-01", "authors": ["Alicia JMinor", "Kareen L KCoulombe"], "doi": "10.1093/stcltm/szab002"}

Existing cell culture and animal models are limited in their capacity to decouple and tune specific hemodynamic stresses implicated in the development of physiological and pathophysiological cardiac tissue remodeling. This study focused on creating a system to subject engineered cardiac tissue to either pressure or stretch stimuli in isolation and the subsequent evaluation of acute tissue remodeling. We developed a cardiac tissue chip containing three-dimensional (3-D) cell-laden hydrogel constructs and cultured them within systems where we could expose them to either pressure changes or volume changes as seen in the left ventricle. Acute cellular remodeling with each condition was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed using histology, immunohistochemistry, gene expression studies, and soluble factor analysis. Using our unique model system, we isolated the effects of pressure and stretch on engineered cardiac tissue. Our results confirm that both pressure and stretch mediate acute stress responses in the engineered cardiac tissue. However, both experimental conditions elicited a similar acute phase injury response within this timeframe. This study demonstrates our ability to subject engineered cardiac tissue to either pressure or stretch stimuli in isolation, both of which elicited acute tissue remodeling responses.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2022-06-01", "authors": ["LeslieDonoghue", "CalebGraham", "PalaniappanSethu"], "doi": "10.1159/000525250"}

Growth factor-based therapy has emerged as an alternative AMI treatment strategy. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of growth factor cardioprotective and regenerative actions is important. This review focuses on the function of different growth factors at each stage of the cardiac repair process. Recent evidence for growth factor therapy in preclinical and clinical trials is included. Finally, different delivery strategies are reviewed with a view to providing workable strategies for clinical translation.\nAcute myocardial infarction is a serious, life-threatening disease.

{"title": "Large-Animal Model of Donation after Circulatory Death and Normothermic Regional Perfusion for Cardiac Assessment.", "abstract": "The increase in demand for cardiac transplantation throughout the years has fueled interest in donation after circulatory death (DCD) to expand the organ donor pool. However, the DCD process is associated with the risk of cardiac tissue injury due to the inevitable period of warm ischemia. Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) allows for an in situ organ assessment, allowing the procurement of hearts determined to be viable. Here, we describe a clinically relevant large-animal model of DCD followed by NRP. Circulatory death is established in anesthetized pigs by stopping mechanical ventilation. After a preset warm ischemia period, an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) is used for a NRP period lasting at least 30 min. During this reperfusion period, the model allows the collection of various myocardial biopsies and blood samples for initial cardiac evaluation. Once NRP is weaned, biochemical, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic assessments of cardiac function and metabolism can be performed before organ procurement. This protocol closely simulates the clinical scenario previously described for DCD and NRP in heart transplantation and has the potential to facilitate studies aimed at decreasing ischemia-reperfusion injury and enhance cardiac functional preservation and recovery.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2022-06-01", "authors": ["KhalilKhalil", "Roberto V PRibeiro", "Julgans SAlvarez", "Mitesh VBadiwala", "ShantDer Sarkissian", "NicolasNoiseux"], "doi": "10.3791/64009"}

Ginsenoside Rc (10, 20, or 40\u2009mg/kg) was intragastrically administered 1\u2009h after isoproterenol injection. The mice in the control group were subcutaneously injected with normal saline and intragastrically given 0.5% CMC-Na. CK-MB and troponin T were assayed. Histopathological examination of myocardium was conducted. The expression of Nrf2, GCLC, GCLM and HO-1 in heart tissues was evaluated by Western blot.\nIn myocardial ischaemic mice, ginsenoside Rc reduced the levels of CK-MB (197.1\u2009\u00b1\u200915.7, 189.9\u2009\u00b1\u200919.0, 184.0\u2009\u00b1\u200914.4 vs. 221.6\u2009\u00b1\u200927.9) and troponin T (10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7, 9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3, 8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vs. 13.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4). Ginsenoside Rc attenuated the necrosis and inflammatory cells infiltration in myocardium. Furthermore, ginsenoside Rc not only decreased the contents of MDA, TNF-\u03b1 but also increased GSH level in the heart tissues. The expression of Nrf2, GCLC, GCLM and HO-1 was significantly increased in the animals treated with ginsenoside Rc. ML385, an Nrf2 inhibitor, blocked partially the ginsenoside Rc-mediated cardioprotective effect. Ginsenoside Rc attenuated myocardial ischaemic injury in mice, which may be, in part, through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.\nThis study indicated that ginsenoside Rc might be a novel candidate for treatment of myocardial ischaemia.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical biology", "date": "2022-06-01", "authors": ["LeiShi", "WenwenFu", "HualiXu", "ShihuiLi", "XinyuYang", "WeiYang", "DayunSui", "QuanweiWang"], "doi": "10.1080/13880209.2022.2072518"}
{"title": "Lipidomics Revealed Aberrant Lipid Metabolism Caused by Inflammation in Cardiac Tissue in the Early Stage of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in a Murine Model.", "abstract": "Cardiac involvement, displayed as premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), is one of common clinical symptoms of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), contributing to mortality of the disease. The precise underlying pathological mechanism(s) for the cardiac involvement in lupus remains poorly understood. Lipids and their metabolites are directly involved in atherosclerosis development, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which are closely related to the development of CVD. In the study, shotgun lipidomics was exploited to quantitatively analyze cellular lipidomes in the cardiac tissue of MRL/lpr mice at two different time points (i.e., pre-lupus and lupus state) with/without treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs). Urine protein, spleen index, and renal histopathological evaluation of the mice were also performed for assessment of SLE onset and/or outcome. Lipidomics analysis revealed that the deposition of cholesterol and the aberrant metabolism of lipids caused by the increased energy metabolism and the enhanced activation of phospholipases, both of which were originally induced by inflammation, were already present in cardiac tissues from lupus-prone mice even at pre-lupus state. These lipid alterations could further induce inflammation and autoimmune responses, accelerating the process of CVD. In addition, the present study also demonstrated that GCs therapy could not only delay the progression of SLE, but also partially corrected these alterations of lipid species in cardiac tissue due to their anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, the medications with better anti-inflammatory effect might be a useful therapeutic method for premature CVD of SLE.", "journal": "Metabolites", "date": "2022-05-29", "authors": ["JidaZhang", "LuLu", "XiaoyuTian", "KailiWang", "GuanqunXie", "HaichangLi", "ChengpingWen", "ChangfengHu"], "doi": "10.3390/metabo12050415\n10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30237-5\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.06.006\n10.1016/j.semarthrit.2012.12.002\n10.1161/JAHA.116.005394\n10.1016/j.berh.2017.09.008\n10.1159/000091246\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01212\n10.1016/j.jaut.2019.102355\n10.1016/j.jaut.2022.102813\n10.1055/s-0033-1334484\n10.1055/s-0029-1242716\n10.3390/metabo11090621\n10.1002/art.10624\n10.1002/1529-0131(200005)43:5<1033::AID-ANR11>3.0.CO;2-B\n10.1002/art.20780\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.11.006\n10.3390/biom8040105\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.12.006\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.06.005\n10.1007/s10753-018-0832-5\n10.3390/metabo11030142\n10.1080/08916930410001666622\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.03.036\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.04.030\n10.1089/ars.2013.5702\n10.4049/jimmunol.169.2.1092\n10.1152/ajpcell.00243.2006\n10.1038/nrendo.2016.98\n10.1002/art.21976\n10.1002/acr.24328\n10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107466\n10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.10.007\n10.1194/jlr.M600551-JLR200\n10.1194/jlr.M800561-JLR200\n10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.10.001\n10.18632/aging.100155\n10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00390-2\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.03.012\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.594945\n10.1385/CT:5:2:161\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.03.087\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2003.08.004\n10.1016/j.plipres.2020.101068\n10.1016/j.tem.2017.10.010\n10.1038/nri2470\n10.1208/s12248-014-9714-4\n10.1111/1756-185X.13743\n10.1681/ASN.2019050545\n10.1139/y59-099\n10.1021/bi7004015\n10.1021/ac900241u\n10.1194/jlr.D500007-JLR200\n10.1021/ac300695p\n10.1002/mas.20023\n10.1002/rcm.3595"}

The relative wall thickness, a marker of LVH, tended to be positively correlated with the degree of non-cardiomyocyte area. The extent of TTR deposition was positively correlated with enlargement of the non-cardiomyocyte area, and these were positively correlated with LV diastolic dysfunction. Additionally, the extent of the area containing TTR was positively correlated with the percentage of cardiomyocyte nuclei stained for 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine, a marker of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

{"title": "Research Progress on Transorgan Regulation of the Cardiovascular and Motor System through Cardiogenic Exosomes.", "abstract": "The heart is the core organ of the circulatory system. Through the blood circulation system, it has close contact with all tissues and cells in the body. An exosome is an extracellular vesicle enclosed by a phospholipid bilayer. A variety of heart tissue cells can secrete and release exosomes, which transfer RNAs, lipids, proteins, and other biomolecules to adjacent or remote cells, mediate intercellular communication, and regulate the physiological and pathological activities of target cells. Cardiogenic exosomes play an important role in regulating almost all pathological and physiological processes of the heart. In addition, they can also reach distant tissues and organs through the peripheral circulation, exerting profound influence on their functional status. In this paper, the composition and function of cardiogenic exosomes, the factors affecting cardiogenic exosomes and their roles in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology are discussed, and the close relationship between cardiovascular system and motor system is innovatively explored from the perspective of exosomes.

{"title": "The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Ligand FICZ Improves Left Ventricular Remodeling and Cardiac Function at the Onset of Pressure Overload-Induced Heart Failure in Mice.", "abstract": "Adverse ventricular remodeling is the heart's response to damaging stimuli and is linked to heart failure and poor prognosis. Formyl-indolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ) is an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), through which it exerts pleiotropic effects including protection against inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress. We evaluated the effect of AhR activation by FICZ on the adverse ventricular remodeling that occurs in the early phase of pressure overload in the murine heart induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Cardiac structure and function were evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) before and 3 days after Sham or TAC surgery in mice treated with FICZ or with vehicle, and cardiac tissue was used for biochemical studies. CMRI analysis revealed that FICZ improved cardiac function and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy. These beneficial effects involved the inhibition of the hypertrophic calcineurin/NFAT pathway, transcriptional reduction in pro-fibrotic genes, and antioxidant effects mediated by the NRF2/NQO1 pathway. Overall, our findings provide new insight into the role of cardiac AhR signaling in the injured heart.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-05-29", "authors": ["Mar\u00edaTamayo", "LauraMart\u00edn-Nunes", "Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9Piedras", "Mar\u00edaMartin-Calvo", "DanielMart\u00ed-Morente", "MartaGil-Fern\u00e1ndez", "NievesG\u00f3mez-Hurtado", "Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngelesMoro", "LisardoBosca", "Mar\u00edaFern\u00e1ndez-Velasco", "CarmenDelgado"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23105403\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2010.10.008\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.139\n10.1042/BJ20131501\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.04.021\n10.1056/NEJM199005313222203\n10.1073/pnas.89.17.8185\n10.1016/0006-291X(92)91185-S\n10.1155/2018/6058784\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.12.003\n10.1186/s12964-014-0057-7\n10.1177/030098589703400609\n10.1016/j.taap.2003.08.008\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)47743-5\n10.1124/pr.113.007823\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050301\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.06.001\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-011112-140320\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135097\n10.1016/j.taap.2004.01.018\n10.1155/2016/7943495\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.02.007\n10.1093/toxsci/kfp115\n10.1084/jem.20172024\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.121\n10.1161/01.RES.87.12.e61\n10.1093/ajh/hpy154\n10.1007/s00204-013-1159-5\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00461.x\n10.1080/03602530600632063\n10.1385/CT:2:4:263\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105316\n10.1038/nrneph.2016.48\n10.1007/s00395-019-0722-5\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.1007/s00418-008-0541-5\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105180\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)35805-8\n10.1016/j.taap.2003.09.002\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2017.10.002\n10.1002/eji.201445228\n10.1038/s41598-020-65414-1\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00872.x\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00873.x\n10.1111/bph.15048"}
{"title": "CARS Imaging Advances Early Diagnosis of Cardiac Manifestation of Fabry Disease.", "abstract": "Vibrational spectroscopy can detect characteristic biomolecular signatures and thus has the potential to support diagnostics. Fabry disease (FD) is a lipid disorder disease that leads to accumulations of globotriaosylceramide in different organs, including the heart, which is particularly critical for the patient's prognosis. Effective treatment options are available if initiated at early disease stages, but many patients are late- or under-diagnosed. Since Coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) imaging has a high sensitivity for lipid/protein shifts, we applied CARS as a diagnostic tool to assess cardiac FD manifestation in an FD mouse model. CARS measurements combined with multivariate data analysis, including image preprocessing followed by image clustering and data-driven modeling, allowed for differentiation between FD and control groups. Indeed, CARS identified shifts of lipid/protein content between the two groups in cardiac tissue visually and by subsequent automated bioinformatic discrimination with a mean sensitivity of 90-96%. Of note, this genotype differentiation was successful at a very early time point during disease development when only kidneys are visibly affected by globotriaosylceramide depositions. Altogether, the sensitivity of CARS combined with multivariate analysis allows reliable diagnostic support of early FD organ manifestation and may thus improve diagnosis, prognosis, and possibly therapeutic monitoring of FD.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-05-29", "authors": ["ElenTolstik", "NairveenAli", "ShuxiaGuo", "PaulEbersbach", "DorotheM\u00f6llmann", "PaulaArias-Loza", "JohannDierks", "IrinaSchuler", "ErikFreier", "J\u00f6rgDebus", "Hideo ABaba", "PeterNordbeck", "ThomasBocklitz", "KristinaLorenz"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23105345\n10.1021/acs.analchem.9b01746\n10.1021/acs.analchem.9b03395\n10.1038/srep29239\n10.1039/C6AN02072K\n10.1146/annurev-med-122313-085916\n10.1186/s12885-016-2520-x\n10.1186/1750-1172-5-30\n10.1186/1750-1172-8-116\n10.1007/s00428-007-0468-6\n10.3390/ijms21218080\n10.21037/cdt-20-743\n10.1136/postgradmedj-2018-136056\n10.1002/jgf2.76\n10.1007/s12574-017-0340-x\n10.1016/j.beem.2014.10.003\n10.1111/cge.13546\n10.3390/ijms22094434\n10.1159/000060184\n10.3390/cells10061532\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001691\n10.1111/joim.12801\n10.1681/ASN.2012030316\n10.3390/diseases5020015\n10.1136/openhrt-2018-000803\n10.1093/ejechocard/jer109\n10.1073/pnas.94.6.2540\n10.1073/pnas.0508282102\n10.1186/s12870-018-1481-4\n10.1126/science.aaa8870\n10.1126/science.1127566\n10.1194/jlr.D300022-JLR200\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.06.069\n10.1073/pnas.1620008114\n10.1073/pnas.0703594104\n10.1186/s13395-018-0173-y\n10.1039/b822354h\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.11.004\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.11.001\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.03.025\n10.1002/jrs.4607\n10.1002/jrs.4335\n10.1039/C7AY01363A\n10.1007/s00428-005-0089-x\n10.1007/s00418-008-0417-8\n10.1117/1.JBO.22.6.066005\n10.5858/arpa.2012-0238-SA\n10.4022/jafib.1644\n10.1007/s11060-019-03380-z\n10.1038/s41377-018-0003-3\n10.1007/s00292-020-00800-0\n10.1038/s41467-020-15505-4\n10.1016/j.jns.2017.08.1973\n10.1002/hed.24477\n10.3390/molecules26010066"}

Herein, we review the different preconditioning methods of MSCs (hypoxia, chemical and pharmacological agents) and the novel approaches (genetically modified MSCs, MSC-derived exosomes and engineered cardiac patches) suggested to optimize the efficacy of MSC therapy.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2022-05-29", "authors": ["AnthonyMatta", "VanessaNader", "MarineLebrin", "FabianGross", "Anne-CatherinePrats", "DanielCussac", "MichelGalinier", "JeromeRoncalli"], "doi": "10.3390/cells11101620\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.02.016\n10.1186/s13287-021-02443-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.025\n10.1001/jama.2012.25321\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.116.003800\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0197\n10.1002/jcp.21200\n10.1038/aps.2013.50\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.078\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.07.017\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243147\n10.1073/pnas.0903201106\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000084828.50310.6A\n10.1186/s13287-015-0057-6\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1367\n10.1161/hc0102.101442\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.07.071\n10.1186/s13287-017-0673-4\n10.1016/j.exphem.2016.04.010\n10.1093/cvr/cvm035\n10.1152/ajpheart.00089.2005\n10.1038/cdd.2008.13\n10.3727/096368916X691123\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.197723\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0342\n10.1074/jbc.M011688200\n10.3390/ijms18061320\n10.4252/wjsc.v14.i2.183\n10.3390/ijms21197301\n10.1155/2019/9695239\n10.15283/ijsc17054\n10.12688/f1000research.55351.1\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2017.01.006\n10.1007/s00784-018-2427-9\n10.1016/j.placenta.2019.05.005\n10.3390/ijms21197092\n10.3390/ijms23073749\n10.1007/s10753-014-9949-3\n10.1111/cpr.12219\n10.2174/1574888X13666180821160421\n10.3892/mmr.2017.8178\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.11.040\n10.1016/j.amjms.2021.01.025\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.03.425\n10.1002/stem.574\n10.1371/journal.pone.0065702\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.189662\n10.1186/1423-0127-16-74\n10.1016/j.joca.2016.09.014\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.09.033\n10.1016/j.nutres.2016.06.010\n10.1210/en.2012-1402\n10.1186/s13287-016-0313-4\n10.1186/s13287-015-0076-3\n10.1517/14712598.2013.782390\n10.1007/s12015-012-9364-9\n10.1002/jcp.25863\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.08.014\n10.1186/1471-2121-14-38\n10.1186/scrt499\n10.1002/stem.169\n10.1016/j.imlet.2015.06.019\n10.1089/scd.2011.0076\n10.1002/jcp.26493\n10.4252/wjsc.v8.i3.73\n10.1016/j.isci.2019.05.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.09.026\n10.1002/jcp.24997\n10.1002/stem.47\n10.1152/ajpcell.00232.2016\n10.1016/j.acthis.2017.04.003\n10.1038/s41434-018-0055-2\n10.1038/cddis.2015.417\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.122\n10.1002/jcp.25578\n10.1038/emm.2014.28\n10.21873/invivo.11066\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.07.001\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000036035.41122.99\n10.1093/cvr/cvn223\n10.1152/ajpheart.01129.2002\n10.1016/j.regpep.2006.11.020\n10.3892/ijmm.2018.3361\n10.1093/cvr/cvm077\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0771\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.036\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2009.04.052\n10.1007/s11010-009-0374-0\n10.1080/14017430701543556\n10.3390/diseases6020042\n10.1038/nrg3763\n10.3390/genes8020065\n10.1080/21645515.2017.1330236\n10.1080/21655979.2016.1189039\n10.1016/0005-2736(81)90512-5\n10.4049/jimmunol.175.4.2237\n10.1016/j.ceb.2004.06.003\n10.1186/s12967-020-02622-3\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300858\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088685\n10.1371/journal.pone.0073304\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.12.043\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.02.023\n10.1038/s41569-020-0389-5\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.03.005\n10.1007/s11936-015-0399-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311213\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.009\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf8781\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1038/nature15372\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.017\n10.1038/srep29933\n10.1038/s41551-021-00796-9\n10.1186/s13287-020-02066-y\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.621781\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.04.005\n10.1172/jci.insight.144068\n10.1038/s41419-020-2542-9\n10.3390/ijms19103236\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.083\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.10.052\n10.1101/2021.12.27.21268295\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.047\n10.1093/cvr/cvab135\n10.3389/fcell.2021.704903\n10.1186/s13287-021-02451-1\n10.1053/j.gastro.2017.12.020\n10.3389/fcell.2022.808303"}
{"title": "Natural Polymers in Heart Valve Tissue Engineering: Strategies, Advances and Challenges.", "abstract": "In the history of biomedicine and biomedical devices, heart valve manufacturing techniques have undergone a spectacular evolution. However, important limitations in the development and use of these devices are known and heart valve tissue engineering has proven to be the solution to the problems faced by mechanical and prosthetic valves. The new generation of heart valves developed by tissue engineering has the ability to repair, reshape and regenerate cardiac tissue. Achieving a sustainable and functional tissue-engineered heart valve (TEHV) requires deep understanding of the complex interactions that occur among valve cells, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the mechanical environment. Starting from this idea, the review presents a comprehensive overview related not only to the structural components of the heart valve, such as cells sources, potential materials and scaffolds fabrication, but also to the advances in the development of heart valve replacements. The focus of the review is on the recent achievements concerning the utilization of natural polymers (polysaccharides and proteins) in TEHV; thus, their extensive presentation is provided. In addition, the technological progresses in heart valve tissue engineering (HVTE) are shown, with several inherent challenges and limitations. The available strategies to design, validate and remodel heart valves are discussed in depth by a comparative analysis of in vitro, in vivo (pre-clinical models) and in situ (clinical translation)

{"title": "Corin: A Key Mediator in Sodium Homeostasis, Vascular Remodeling, and Heart Failure.", "abstract": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a crucial element of the cardiac endocrine function that promotes natriuresis, diuresis, and vasodilation, thereby protecting normal blood pressure and cardiac function. Corin is a type II transmembrane serine protease that is highly expressed in the heart, where it converts the ANP precursor to mature ANP. Corin deficiency prevents ANP activation and causes hypertension and heart disease. In addition to the heart, corin is expressed in other tissues, including those of the kidney, skin, and uterus, where corin-mediated ANP production and signaling act locally to promote sodium excretion and vascular remodeling. These results indicate that corin and ANP function in many tissues via endocrine and autocrine mechanisms. In heart failure patients, impaired natriuretic peptide processing is a common pathological mechanism that contributes to sodium and body fluid retention. In this review, we discuss most recent findings regarding the role of corin in non-cardiac tissues, including the kidney and skin, in regulating sodium homeostasis and body fluid excretion. Moreover, we describe the molecular mechanisms underlying corin and ANP function in supporting orderly cellular events in uterine spiral artery remodeling. Finally, we assess the potential of corin-based approaches to enhance natriuretic peptide production and activity as a treatment of heart failure.", "journal": "Biology", "date": "2022-05-29", "authors": ["XianruiZhang", "XiabingGu", "YikaiZhang", "NingzhengDong", "QingyuWu"], "doi": "10.3390/biology11050717\n10.1016/j.gene.2015.06.029\n10.1038/s41569-020-0381-0\n10.1016/j.peptides.2018.05.012\n10.1016/j.peptides.2018.08.006\n10.1016/j.regpep.2013.08.006\n10.1038/ng.328\n10.1172/jci.insight.155640\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.313400\n10.1038/nature10897\n10.1038/s41586-018-0774-y\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.119.006570\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.120.007208\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307196\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11081\n10.1210/jendso/bvaa052\n10.1038/s41598-021-96970-9\n10.1074/jbc.RA119.008102\n10.1038/s41467-020-17473-1\n10.1373/clinchem.2019.302547\n10.1007/s11906-013-0415-7\n10.1253/circj.CJ-18-0824\n10.1074/jbc.274.21.14926\n10.1074/jbc.R109.021006\n10.1007/s10555-019-09811-7\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.177352\n10.1373/clinchem.2010.153908\n10.1074/jbc.M301223200\n10.1152/ajpregu.00074.2015\n10.1042/BST20190760\n10.1097/MNH.0000000000000297\n10.1097/01.mnh.0000435609.35789.32\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.07.023\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.568881\n10.1002/humu.23318\n10.1371/journal.pone.0113176\n10.1038/nm.3920\n10.1074/jbc.M112.411512\n10.1152/physiol.00026.2016\n10.1074/jbc.M205686200\n10.1038/s41467-018-07333-4\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.02.015\n10.1093/cvr/cvab102\n10.1073/pnas.0407234102\n10.1096/fj.201900531RR\n10.1242/dev.011031\n10.1073/pnas.150149097\n10.1038/ki.2010.197\n10.1042/CS20120517\n10.1042/CS20160398\n10.1152/physrev.00008.2018\n10.7554/eLife.56059\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.05.008\n10.1681/ASN.2013080883\n10.1038/41672\n10.1002/ajmg.a.62627\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.112256\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.12.158\n10.1101/cshperspect.a027979\n10.1152/ajpregu.00104.2014\n10.1093/molbev/msi243\n10.1038/ki.2012.41\n10.1126/science.2463673\n10.1152/ajprenal.1986.250.6.F963\n10.1152/ajprenal.00164.2014\n10.1093/ajh/hpx148\n10.1111/jch.14401\n10.1111/jch.14400\n10.3389/fphys.2021.673497\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18026\n10.1016/j.jhevol.2017.12.003\n10.1080/23328940.2019.1632145\n10.1152/physiol.00041.2006\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3001090\n10.1016/S0190-9622(89)70063-3\n10.1016/j.jid.2018.07.024\n10.1126/science.1200684\n10.1146/annurev-animal-020518-115106\n10.1111/age.13076\n10.1016/j.jid.2021.05.023\n10.1016/j.jid.2021.11.032\n10.1089/scd.2012.0244\n10.1186/s12917-021-03077-4\n10.3389/fgene.2020.582355\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.201244\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.866822\n10.1016/j.placenta.2005.12.006\n10.1016/j.placenta.2009.02.009\n10.1038/nrneph.2014.102\n10.1016/j.ajog.2020.09.039\n10.1016/j.placenta.2012.11.016\n10.7554/eLife.69584\n10.1074/jbc.M114.551424\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2019.12.012\n10.1016/j.preghy.2017.12.001\n10.1016/j.placenta.2016.10.002\n10.1016/j.preghy.2020.05.007\n10.1002/uog.14685\n10.2478/folmed-2018-0025\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.12137\n10.1007/s10286-020-00703-3\n10.2147/IJGM.S297344\n10.1016/j.preghy.2020.11.007\n10.1111/jch.14450\n10.1073/pnas.2003913117\n10.1172/JCI151053\n10.1016/j.regpep.2011.08.006\n10.1016/j.cjca.2018.11.001\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.10.090\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.625072\n10.1161/CIRCGEN.121.003399\n10.2217/bmm-2019-0158\n10.1136/hrt.2008.164145\n10.1536/ihj.18-012\n10.1186/s12929-018-0459-8\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.903849\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.895581\n10.1016/j.cca.2018.06.036\n10.18632/oncotarget.22227\n10.1016/j.jchf.2020.08.015\n10.1016/j.jchf.2020.08.018\n10.5152/AnatolJCardiol.2021.06698\n10.1155/2018/7279036\n10.3390/ijms20133265\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2021.107863\n10.1007/s40292-021-00483-5\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2010.08.001\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.04.060\n10.1056/NEJMoa1409077\n10.1080/10408363.2021.1942782\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.193631\n10.3390/ijms21103456\n10.3390/ijms21010203\n10.1074/jbc.M309991200\n10.1161/JAHA.120.019961\n10.1007/s00228-007-0309-1\n10.1515/CCLM.2006.063\n10.2174/1389200003339207"}
{"title": "Activated Drp1 regulates p62-mediated autophagic flux and aggravates inflammation in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion via the ROS-RIP1/RIP3-exosome axis.", "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) refers to a secondary brain injury that can occur when the blood supply to the ischemic brain tissue is restored. However, the mechanism underlying such injury remains elusive.\nThe 150 male C57 mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1\u00a0h and reperfusion for 24\u00a0h, Among them, 50 MCAO mice were further treated with Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) and 50 MCAO mice were further treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in a low-glucose culture medium for 4\u00a0h under hypoxic conditions and then transferred to normal conditions for 12\u00a0h. Then, cerebral blood flow, mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagic flux, aggresome and exosome expression profiles, cardiac tissue structure, mitochondrial length and cristae density, mtDNA and ROS content, as well as the expression of Drp1-Ser616/Drp1, RIP1/RIP3, LC3 II/LC3 I, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, etc., were detected under normal or Drp1 interference conditions.\nThe mtDNA content, ROS levels, and Drp1-Ser616/Drp1 were elevated by 2.2, 1.7 and 2.7 times after CIRI (P\u2009<\u20090.05). However, the high cytoplasmic LC3 II/I ratio and increased aggregation of p62 could be reversed by 44% and 88% by Drp1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The low fluorescence intensity of autophagic flux and the increased phosphorylation of RIP3 induced by CIRI could be attenuated by ROS scavenger, NAC (P\u2009<\u20090.05). RIP1/RIP3 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) restored 75% to a low LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and enhanced 2 times to a high RFP-LC3 after Drp1 activation (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, although CIRI-induced ROS production caused no considerable accumulation of autophagosomes (P\u2009>\u20090.05), it increased the packaging and extracellular secretion of exosomes containing p62 by 4 - 5 times, which could be decreased by Mdivi-1, Drp1 shRNA, and Nec-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 increased in CIRI-derived exosomes could increase RIP3 phosphorylation in normal or oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) conditions (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nCIRI activated Drp1 and accelerated the p62-mediated formation of autophagosomes while inhibiting the transition of autophagosomes to autolysosomes via the RIP1/RIP3 pathway activation. Undegraded autophagosomes were secreted extracellularly in the form of exosomes, leading to inflammatory cascades that further damaged mitochondria, resulting in excessive ROS generation and the blockage of autophagosome degradation, triggering a vicious cycle.", "journal": "Military Medical Research", "date": "2022-05-28", "authors": ["XueZeng", "Yun-DongZhang", "Rui-YanMa", "Yuan-JingChen", "Xin-MingXiang", "Dong-YaoHou", "Xue-HanLi", "HeHuang", "TaoLi", "Chen-YangDuan"], "doi": "10.1186/s40779-022-00383-2\n10.1038/s41572-019-0118-8\n10.1161/JAHA.119.014920\n10.1038/cddis.2017.465\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030152\n10.1038/s41580-020-00300-2\n10.1007/s12035-017-0503-9\n10.1186/s12974-019-1689-8\n10.1038/s41419-020-2461-9\n10.18632/aging.101751\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101706\n10.18632/aging.102690\n10.3389/fphar.2020.01083\n10.1016/j.brainres.2019.01.018\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.09.003\n10.1186/s40478-019-0821-4\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00220\n10.7150/thno.30879\n10.1016/j.redox.2014.11.006\n10.1089/ars.2009.3074\n10.1002/jnr.23986\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.06.034\n10.1038/s41419-018-0910-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303356\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020502\n10.15252/embj.201593102\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.06.014\n10.1080/15548627.2019.1643185\n10.1016/j.neuint.2017.05.012\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2018.06.018\n10.1089/dna.2013.2164\n10.1002/1873-3468.13748\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2017.06.003\n10.1038/ni.3030\n10.1111/acel.13096\n10.1007/978-1-4939-9769-5_4\n10.1186/s12943-017-0718-4\n10.1016/j.gpb.2015.02.001\n10.1126/science.aau6977\n10.1038/nm.2736\n10.1038/ncomms9472\n10.1002/hep.30766\n10.1007/s00018-016-2309-8"}
{"title": "The effects of aerobic exercise training with octopamine supplementation on cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by deep-frying oil: The role of caspase and procaspase 3.", "abstract": "Clinicians who understand how the body responds to exercise, how aerobic training enhances cardiovascular fitness and the benefits and essentials of prescribing aerobic exercise can effectively encourage patients to be active. Deep-frying is a standard cooking method accompanied by the production of carcinogenesis substances such as acrolein. Acrolein is a toxic byproduct of lipid peroxidation involved in the development of pulmonary, cardiac, and neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to explore the effect of aerobic exercise (E.X.E.), and octopamine (OCT) on caspase three expression levels in the heart tissue of rats were fed deep-frying oil (D.F.O.).\n30 male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06 in each) including (1) control (CO), (2) deep-frying oil (DFO), (3) deep-frying oil\u00a0+\u00a0exercise (DFO\u00a0+\u00a0EXE), (4) deep-frying oil\u00a0+\u00a0octopamine (DFO\u00a0+\u00a0OCT), and (5) deep-frying oil\u00a0+\u00a0exercise\u00a0+\u00a0octopamine (DFO\u00a0+\u00a0EXE\u00a0+\u00a0OCT). The apoptotic effects of D.F.O. in heart tissue were examined by TUNEL assay. Masson's trichrome stain was used to study cardiomyocytic fibers. Moreover, caspase three gene expression in all groups was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR and the Western blot method.\nData showed a significant increase in apoptotic cells in the D.F.O. group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In Masson's Trichrome stain analysis, more cardiomyocytic fibers degradation and lymphocytic aggregation cells in the DFO\u00a0+\u00a0EXE\u00a0+\u00a0OCT group significantly improve this degradation. Also, the expression level of caspase 3 was significantly decreased in the DFO\u00a0+\u00a0EXE\u00a0+\u00a0OCT group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nAccording to the result of the current study, it can be assumed that D.F.O. can lead to programmed cell death via the activation of caspases in heart tissue. However, it seems that aerobic exercise with octopamine supplementation improves heart tissue function by inhibiting the expression of caspase 3 and pro-caspase 3, leading to a significantly decreased apoptosis in cardiomyocytes of DFO-treated models.", "journal": "Clinical nutrition ESPEN", "date": "2022-05-28", "authors": ["PanteaKianmehr", "Mohammad AliAzarbayjani", "MaghsoudPeeri", "ParvinFarzanegi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.02.008"}
{"title": "Triplication of HSA21 on alterations in structure and function of mitochondria.", "abstract": "Triplication of genes encoded in human chromosome 21 (HSA21) is responsible for the phenotypes of Down syndrome (DS). The dosage-imbalance of the nuclear genes and the extra-nuclear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) jointly contributes to patho-mechanisms in DS. The mitochondrial organelles are the power house of cells for generation of ATP and maintaining cellular calcium and redox homeostasis, and cellular energy-metabolism processes. Each cell contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria depending on their energy consumption. The dynamic structure of mitochondria is maintained with continuous fission and fusion events, and thus, content of mtDNA and its genetic composition are widely variable among cells. Cells of brain and heart tissues of DS patients and DS-mouse models have demonstrated elevated number but reduced amount of mtDNA due to higher fission process. This mechanism perturbs the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and generates more free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting contribution of mtDNA in proliferation and protection of cells from endogenous toxic environment and external stressors. Gene-dosage in DS population collectively contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction by lowering energy production and respiratory capacity via the impaired OXPHOS, and damaged redox homeostasis and mitochondrial dynamics in all types of cells in DS. The context is highly complex and affects the functioning of all organs. The effect in brain and heart tissues promotes myriads of neurodegenerative diseases and cardiac complexities in individuals with DS.

{"title": "Current Applications of Polycaprolactone as a Scaffold Material for Heart Regeneration.", "abstract": "Despite numerous advances in treatments for cardiovascular disease, heart failure (HF) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. A significant factor contributing to the progression of cardiovascular diseases into HF is the loss of functioning cardiomyocytes. The recent growth in the field of cardiac tissue engineering has the potential to not only reduce the downstream effects of injured tissues on heart function and longevity but also re-engineer cardiac function through regeneration of contractile tissue. One leading strategy to accomplish this is via a cellularized patch that can be surgically implanted onto a diseased heart. A key area of this field is the use of tissue scaffolds to recapitulate the mechanical and structural environment of the native heart and thus promote engineered myocardium contractility and function. While the strong mechanical properties and anisotropic structural organization of the native heart can be largely attributed to a robust extracellular matrix, similar strength and organization has proven to be difficult to achieve in cultured tissues. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is an emerging contender to fill these gaps in fabricating scaffolds that mimic the mechanics and structure of the native heart. In the field of cardiovascular engineering, PCL has recently begun to be studied as a scaffold for regenerating the myocardium due to its facile fabrication, desirable mechanical, chemical, and biocompatible properties, and perhaps most importantly, biodegradability, which make it suitable for regenerating and re-engineering function to the heart after disease or injury. This review focuses on the application of PCL as a scaffold specifically in myocardium repair and regeneration and outlines current fabrication approaches, properties, and possibilities of PCL incorporation into engineered myocardium, as well as provides suggestions for future directions and a roadmap toward clinical translation of this technology.", "journal": "ACS applied bio materials", "date": "2022-05-28", "authors": ["Phillip RSchmitt", "Kiera DDwyer", "Kareen L KCoulombe"], "doi": "10.1021/acsabm.2c00174"}
{"title": "Distinct morphology of cardiac- and brown adipose tissue-projecting neurons in the stellate ganglia of mice.", "abstract": "Sympathetic neurons that innervate the heart are located primarily in the stellate ganglia (SG), which also contains neurons that project to brown adipose tissue (BAT). These studies were designed to examine the morphology of these two populations (cardiac- and BAT-projecting) and their target connectivity. We examined SG neurons in C57BL/6J mice following injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CTb) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 555, into cardiac tissue and intrascapular BAT. BAT-projecting SG neurons were widely dispersed in SG, while cardiac-projecting SG neurons were localized primarily near the inferior cardiac nerve base. SG neurons were not dual-labeled, suggesting that sympathetic innervation is specific to the heart and BAT, supporting the idea of \"labeled lines\" of efferents. Morphologically, cardiac-projecting SG somata had more volume and were less abundant than BAT-projecting neurons using our tracer-labeling paradigm. We found a positive correlation between the number of primary dendrites per neuron and soma volume in cardiac-projecting SG neurons, though not in BAT-projecting neurons. In both SG subpopulations, the number of cholinergic inputs marked with vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) puncta contacting the soma was positively correlated to soma volume, suggesting scaling of inputs across a range of neuronal sizes. In separate studies using dual tracing from left and right BAT, we found that BAT-projecting SG neurons were located predominately ipsilateral to the injection, but a small subset of SG neurons project bilaterally to BAT.

An increase in the pro-inflammatory subset of monocytes, marked by Ly6C antigen expression, in response to biomaterials can lead to rapid material degradation, ineffective treatment, and worsening of tissue injury. Flow cytometry is a leading method for screening the recruitment of monocytes to the heart in response to biomaterial injection.

All skeletal elements associated with the proximal condensation are dysmorphic, exemplified by a malformed and misoriented malleus. At later stages, Fgf8 mutants exhibit syngnathia, which falls into two broad categories: bony fusion of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar ridges and zygomatico-mandibular fusion. All of these morphological defects exhibit both inter- and intra-specimen variation.\nWe hypothesize that these asymmetries are linked to heart development resulting in higher levels of Fgf8 on the right side of the face, which may buffer the right side to developmental perturbations.

Several compounds have been studied to reduce DOX cardiotoxicity to improve its therapeutic index. This study was aimed to investigate the protective effects of sodium thiosulfate (STS) pre-treatment against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in rats.\nMale Wistar rats were randomized into 4 groups: control (saline), DOX (2.5\u2009mg/kg, 3 times per week, intraperitoneal [i.p.]), STS (300\u2009mg/kg, 3 times per week, i.p), and DOX\u2009+\u2009STS (30\u2009min prior to DOX injection, 3 times per week, i.p.) over a period of 2 weeks. The body weight, electrocardiography, histopathology, papillary muscle contractility, and oxidative stress biomarkers in heart tissues were assessed.\nThe results indicated that STS significantly improved the body weight (P\u2009<\u20090.01), decreased QRS complex and QT interval on ECG (P\u2009<\u20090.05 and P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively), as well as declined the papillary muscle excitation, and increased its contraction (P\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to DOX-treated rats. STS strongly suppressed oxidative stress induced by DOX through the significant improvement of the cardiac tissue antioxidant capacity by increasing glutathione, superoxide dismutase (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and decreasing the level of lipid peroxidation (P\u2009<\u20090.01).\nTaken together, the results of this study demonstrated that STS showed potent cardioprotective effects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing oxidative stress.", "journal": "BMC pharmacology & toxicology", "date": "2022-05-26", "authors": ["MaryamShekari", "Narges KhalilianGortany", "MinaKhalilzadeh", "AlirezaAbdollahi", "HomanazGhafari", "Ahmad RezaDehpour", "MahmoudGhazi-Khansari"], "doi": "10.1186/s40360-022-00569-3\n10.1159/000265166\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.10.043\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101394\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.02.013\n10.1038/nm.2919\n10.1002/path.1863\n10.1007/s00280-019-04019-6\n10.4037/ccn2011799\n10.1159/000380945\n10.2165/11316640-000000000-00000\n10.1186/1475-2840-4-1\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000000456\n10.3389/fphar.2021.650968\n10.1007/s12013-019-00871-8\n10.1007/s10557-017-6751-0\n10.4172/pharmaceutical-sciences.1000163\n10.1159/000156486\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118074\n10.1016/j.cbi.2015.12.010\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.06.022\n10.3389/fphar.2021.670479\n10.1093/cvr/cvn192\n10.1111/bph.13791\n10.1016/j.jacme.2015.02.003\n10.1007/s002800050048\n10.1016/j.tox.2007.09.026\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.12.022\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.1999.00480.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0773.1994.tb00330.x\n10.1007/s002800050453\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0494\n10.3390/cells7100144\n10.1007/s13105-014-0339-y\n10.1016/j.phymed.2018.01.009\n10.1016/j.cbi.2017.07.002\n10.1155/2015/795602\n10.1097/MPH.0000000000001118\n10.1186/s40959-019-0036-7"}

Several of these pathways in the ischemic myocardium are intricately tied with the downstream signaling of bioactive sphingolipids, which play an active role during post-infarction remodeling. In this current study, we examined the effects of relaxin on sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and the potential benefits of relaxin treatment on cardiac health in a rodent model of ischemic heart failure. Acute (30\u00a0min) and sub-acute (24\u00a0h) treatment of primary cardiomyocytes with serelaxin (recombinant human relaxin-2) increased the cardiomyocyte content of S1P. In the rodent model, treatment with relaxin for 28\u00a0days following myocardial ischemia by way of permanent left coronary artery occlusion improved survival and cardiac function, reduced fibrosis and apoptosis, and mitigated the expression of several pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers. The expression of beclin-1 (autophagy marker) was also reduced. The expression of S1P was significantly higher in cardiac tissue and plasma samples extracted from serelaxin-treated mice at day 28.

{"title": "Berberine exerts protective effects on cardiac senescence by regulating the Klotho/SIRT1 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid, exerts protective effects on various cardiac injuries, and also extends the lifespan of individuals. However, the cardioprotective effect of BBR on cardiac senescence remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of BBR on cardiac senescence and its underlying mechanism. Senescent H9c2 cells induced by doxorubicin (DOX) and naturally aged rats were used to evaluate the protective effects of BBR on cardiac senescence. The results showed that BBR protected H9c2 cells against DOX-induced senescence. Exogenous Klotho (KL) exerts similar effects to those of BBR. BBR significantly increased in protein expression of KL, while transfection with KL-specific siRNA (siKL) inhibited the protective effect of BBR against senescence. Both BBR and exogenous KL decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species, inhibited apoptosis, and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction in these cells; and transfection with siKL attenuated these effects of BBR. In naturally aged rats, BBR indeed protected the animals from cardiac aging, at least partially, through lowering the levels of cardiac hypertrophy markers, and increased the expression of KL in cardiac tissue. Additionally, BBR markedly reversed downregulation of sirtuin1 (SIRTI) in the aged heart. In vitro experiments revealed that BBR and exogenous KL also increased the expression of SIRT1, whereas siKL limited this effect of BBR in senescent H9c2 cell. In summary, BBR upregulated KL expression and prevented heart from cardiac senescence through anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects, as well as alleviation of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Pirfenidone is a promising agent for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and has recently proven to exert inhibitory effects on the inflammatory response. This study proposes to explore the potential pharmacological action of Pirfenidone in treating cardiac hypertrophy in a rodent model. Four groups of mice were used in the present study: the control, ISO (5 mg/kg/day) for 7 days, Pirfenidone (200 mg/kg/day) for 14 days, and Spironolactone (SPI) (200 mg/kg/day) for 14 days groups. Increased heart weight index, left ventricle (LV) weight index, LV wall thickness, declined LV volume, and elevated serum levels of CK-MB, AST, and LDH were observed in ISO-challenged mice, all of which were dramatically reversed by the administration of Pirfenidone or SPI. Furthermore, an elevated cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes in the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining of heart cross-sections, upregulated atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), \u03b2 Myosin Heavy Chain (\u03b2-MHC), and excessively released tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in cardiac tissues were observed in the ISO group but greatly alleviated by Pirfenidone or SPI. Lastly, the promoted expression levels of p-JAK-2/JAK-2 and p-STAT3/STAT-3 in the cardiac tissues of ISO-challenged mice were significantly repressed by Pirfenidone or SPI.

The experimental strategies of MI were stimulated through the subcutaneous direction of ISO (85\u2009mg/kg body weight) for 14 days. ISO-directed models showed elevated heart rate levels\u00a0and cardiac markers (serum creatine kinase [CK], serum CK-myocardial band, serum C-reactive proteins, and plasma homocysteine); increased cardiac-troponins-T, and troponin-I levels in both serum and myocardium. Moreover, we perceived that a higher level of lipid peroxidation molecules (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid hydroperoxides) reduced the antioxidant enzyme levels in plasma and heart tissue of ISO-directed rats. However, geraniol treatment prevents ISO-directed enhancement of the heart rate, cardiac and lipid peroxidative genes; reverted the blood pressure, and antioxidant status in ISO-directed\u00a0rats. Furthermore, gene expression results revealed that geraniol treatment inhibited the mitogen-activated\u00a0protein\u00a0kinase (MAPK) proteins, inflammatory responder (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1,\u00a0interleukin\u00a06, nuclear factor-\u03baB), and cardiac fibrotic proteins (matrix metalloproteinase-2[MMP-2], MMP-9) in ISO directed rats.

Our previous clinical studies have found the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on CFS patients, however, the mechanism of EA on CFS is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of EA on cardiac function in a CFS mouse model to explore its underlying mechanism. The mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, CFS, and CFS mice receiving EA (CFS\u2009+\u2009EA). After behavioral assessments and echocardiographic measurement, blood and heart tissue of the mice were collected for biochemical tests, and then we evaluated the effects of EA on the CFS mouse model when nitric oxide (NO) levels were enhanced by l-arginine. The results showed that EA ameliorated the injured motor and cardiac function. Meanwhile, EA also inhibited increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at heart tissue and the serum NO levels in mice subjected to sustained forced swimming stress. Furthermore, the NO level in serum increased with l-arginine administration, which blocked the effects of EA on CFS mice. This study suggested that EA could improve the motor function and cardiac function in CFS mice and its effects may be associated with the down-regulation of iNOS/NO signaling.\n\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u793e\u4f1a\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u538b\u529b\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0, \u6162\u6027\u75b2\u52b3\u7efc\u5408\u5f81(CFS)\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7535\u9488(EA)\u5bf9CFS\u60a3\u8005\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7136\u800c, EA\u6cbb\u7597CFS\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d, \u6211\u4eec\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86EA\u5bf9CFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u6a21\u578b\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5c06\u5c0f\u9f20\u968f\u673a\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ec4:\u7a7a\u767d\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4, CFS\u7ec4\u4ee5\u53caCFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u63a5\u53d7EA\u5e72\u9884(CFS\u2009+\u2009EA)\u7ec4\u3002\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u8d85\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e, \u6536\u96c6\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u8840\u6db2\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b, \u968f\u540e\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f53L-\u7cbe\u6c28\u9178\u4e0a\u8c03\u4e00\u6c27\u5316\u6c2e(NO)\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b, EA\u5e72\u9884CFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, EA\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u65f6, EA\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u8feb\u6e38\u6cf3\u5e94\u6fc0\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u578b\u4e00\u6c27\u5316\u6c2e\u5408\u9176(iNOS)\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u8840\u6e05NO\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u6b64\u5916, L-\u7cbe\u6c28\u9178\u7ed9\u836f\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u8840\u6e05\u4e2d\u7684NO\u6c34\u5e73, \u4ece\u800c\u963b\u65ad\u4e86EA\u5bf9CFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e, \u7535\u9488\u53ef\u6539\u5584CFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd, \u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5bf9iNOS/NO\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e0b\u8c03\u6709\u5173\u3002.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2022-05-25", "authors": ["YangZhu", "JingyaWang", "LinYao", "YunxuanHuang", "HaitaoYang", "XiaojiangYu", "XinghuaChen", "YongjunChen"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.24953"}
{"title": "LncRNA NORAD promotes the progression of myocardial infarction by targeting the miR-22-3p/PTEN axis.", "abstract": "NORAD is a newly identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that plays an important role in cancers. NORAD has been found to be highly expressed in the mouse model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the role of NORAD in the regulation of AMI remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the function of NORAD in AMI and explore the potential regulatory mechanisms. A mouse model of AMI was established and NORAD was knocked-down. The infarcted size of heart tissues and the cardiac function were evaluated. In addition, two cardiomyocyte cell lines were treated with hypoxia/re-oxygenation (H/R) to mimic AMI . Luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down assay, fluorescence hybridization, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis were performed. Apoptotic cells and the levels of L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected. Our results show that downregulation of NORAD efficiently attenuates heart damage in the AMI mouse model. NORAD interacts with miR-22-3p. Knock-down of NORAD inhibits H/R-induced cell apoptosis and reduces LDH and MDA levels, while its effects are abolished by miR-22-3p inhibitor. MiR-22-3p interacts with PTEN and inhibits its expression. Overexpression of miR-22-3p inhibits H/R-induced cell apoptosis and reduces LDH and MDA levels, while its effects are abolished by overexpression of PTEN. Finally, overexpression of NORAD inhibits the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and its effects are attenuated by overexpression of miR-22-3p. Taken together, our study reveals that NORAD promotes the progression of AMI by regulating the miR-22-3p/PTEN axis, and the AKT/mTOR signaling may also be involved in the regulatory processes.", "journal": "Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica", "date": "2022-05-25", "authors": ["ChunxiaLi", "LihuiZhang", "XingpengBu", "GuofangChu", "XiaofangZhao", "YaruLiu"], "doi": "10.3724/abbs.2022037\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.1056/NEJMra1606915\n10.1002/iub.2187\n10.1038/s41419-019-2136-6\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.05.018\n10.1002/jcb.26743\n10.1002/jcb.26678\n10.1002/jcb.26671\n10.1159/000464465\n10.1038/s41388-019-0812-8\n10.1186/s12943-017-0738-0\n10.1002/jcp.27869\n10.3892/mmr.2020.11064\n10.18502/ijaai.v17i4.91\n10.2174/1567202616666191111124516\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.06.038\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2019.02.001\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-082411-113907\n10.1016/j.ijcha.2019.100366\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0707155\n10.1016/j.joca.2020.02.027\n10.1016/j.thromres.2019.02.002\n10.1007/s13105-019-00695-3\n10.1093/cvr/cvz040\n10.3892/mmr.2018.8620\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.06.122\n10.1159/000478870\n10.1080/15384101.2019.1678965\n10.1186/s12944-019-1142-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312117\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.302521\n10.1111/jcmm.13032\n10.1038/nrg.2016.20\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2015-103334\n10.1038/cddis.2017.321\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.11.017\n10.3892/mmr.2018.8640\n10.1536/ihj.15-293"}

{"title": "Hesperidin Attenuates Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Apoptosis, and Cardiac Dysfunction in Sodium Fluoride-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Rats.", "abstract": "Excessive fluoride intake has been reported to cause toxicities to brain, thyroid, kidney, liver and testis tissues. Hesperidin (HSP) is an antioxidant that possesses anti-allergenic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Presently, the studies focusing on the toxic effects of sodium fluoride (NaF) on heart tissue at biochemical and molecular level are limited. This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of HSP on toxicity of NaF on the heart of rats in vivo by observing the alterations in oxidative injury markers (MDA, SOD, CAT, GPX and GSH), pro-inflammatory markers (NF-\u03baB, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), expressions of apoptotic genes (caspase-3, -6, -9, Bax, Bcl-2, p53, cytochrome c), levels of autophagic markers (Beclin 1, LC3A, LC3B), expression levels of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and cardiac markers. HSP treatment attenuated the NaF-induced heart tissue injury by increasing activities of SOD, CAT and GPx and levels of GSH, and suppressing lipid peroxidation. In addition, HSP reversed the changes in expression of apoptotic (caspase-3, -6, -9, Bax, Bcl-2, p53, cytochrome c), levels of autophagic and inflammatory parameters (Beclin 1, LC3A, LC3B, NF-\u03baB, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), in the NaF-induced cardiotoxicity. HSP also modulated the gene expression levels of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and levels of cardiac markers (LDH, CK-MB).

Propolis (Pro) has vigorous anti-inflammatory activity. Its cardio-protective characteristic against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was previously proven. The current study aimed to appraise the effect of Pro on 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control, 5-FU, 5-FU\u2009+\u2009Pro 250\u00a0mg/kg, and 5-FU\u2009+\u2009Colchicine (CLC) 5\u00a0mg/kg. Different hematological, serological, biochemical, histopathological, and molecular assays were performed to assess the study's aim. Moreover, a rat myocardium (H9C2(2-1)) cell line was also used to assess this protective effect in-vitro. 5-FU resulted in significant cardiotoxicity represented by an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) expression, cardiac enzyme levels, and histopathological degenerations. 5-FU treatment also decreased bodyweight, total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC), catalase (CAT) levels, blood cell counts, and hemoglobin (Hb) levels. In addition, 5-FU disrupted ECG parameters, including increased elevation in the ST-segment and increased QRS complex and QTc duration. Treating with Pro reduced oxidative stress, cardiac enzymes, histopathological degenerations, and COX-2 expression in cardiac tissue alleviated ECG disturbances and increased the number of blood cells and TAC levels. Moreover, 5-FU-induced bodyweight loss was ameliorated after treatment with Pro.

{"title": "Multiscale Modeling of the Mitochondrial Origin of Cardiac Reentrant and Fibrillatory Arrhythmias.", "abstract": "While mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias, how the abnormality occurring at the organelle level escalates to influence the rhythm of the heart remains incompletely understood. This is due, in part, to the complexity of the interactions formed by cardiac electrical, mechanical, and metabolic subsystems at various spatiotemporal scales that is difficult to fully comprehend solely with experiments. Computational models have emerged as a powerful tool to explore complicated and highly dynamic biological systems such as the heart, alone or in combination with experimental measurements. Here, we describe a strategy of integrating computer simulations with optical mapping of cardiomyocyte monolayers to examine how regional mitochondrial dysfunction elicits abnormal electrical activity, such as rebound and spiral waves, leading to reentry and fibrillation in cardiac tissue.

Aged rats in exercise group run on treadmill (17\u00a0m/min) and in the curcumin group received curcumin (50\u00a0mg/kg) by gavage daily for 8\u00a0weeks for 2\u00a0months. At the end, heart samples were collected and used for determination of autophagy by immunostaining for LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II), apoptosis by TUNEL assay, Malondialdehyde (MDA) level by enzymatic assay and determination of mediators' molecules by ELISA for NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4), sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1), phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (p-NF-\u0198b) protein levels and Sequestosome-1 (P62).

Also, significant increased apoptosis and fibrosis levels in the heart of aged rats were observed compared with young rats, whereas, these undesirable changes were improved by exercise and curcumin. Also, combination therapy of aged rats with curcumin and exercise showed more significant prominent effect on molecular mediators and histological changes in the heart compared with monotherapy.\nThese findings indicate that stress oxidative increase and autophagy decrease in the heart tissue of aged rats.

Early animal studies reliably demonstrate that RIPC attenuated infarct size and preserved cardiac tissue. However, translating these adaptations to clinical practice in humans has been challenging. Large clinical studies have found inconsistent results with respect to RIPC eliciting IR injury protection or improving clinical outcomes. Follow-up studies have implicated several factors that potentially affect the efficacy of RIPC in humans such as age, fitness, frequency, disease state and interactions with medications. Thus, realizing the clinical potential for RIPC may require a human experimental model where confounding factors are more effectively controlled and underlying mechanisms can be further elucidated. In this review, we highlight recent experimental findings in the peripheral circulation that have added valuable insight on the mechanisms and clinical benefit of RIPC in humans. Central to this discussion is the critical role of timing (i.e. immediate vs. delayed effects following a single bout of RIPC) and the frequency of RIPC. Limited evidence in humans has demonstrated that repeated bouts of RIPC over several\u00a0days uniquely improves vascular function beyond that observed with a single bout alone. Since changes in resistance vessel and microvascular function often precede symptoms and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, repeated bouts of RIPC may be promising as a preclinical intervention to prevent or delay cardiovascular disease progression.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2022-05-22", "authors": ["James ALang", "JahyunKim"], "doi": "10.1113/JP282568"}

This study aimed at identifying new predictive biomarkers of post-AMI HF and at revealing the pathogenesis of HF involving these marker genes.\nA transcriptomic dataset of whole blood cells from AMI patients with HF progression (post-AMI HF, n = 16) and without progression (post-AMI non-HF, n = 16) was analyzed using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The results indicated that one module consisting of 720 hub genes was significantly correlated with post-AMI HF. The hub genes were validated in another transcriptomic dataset of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (post-AMI HF, n = 9; post-AMI non-HF, n = 8).

Based on a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of leukocytes from heart tissues of normal and infarcted mice, PRKAR1A was further verified to be upregulated in monocytes/macrophages on day 2, while SDCBP was highly expressed in neutrophils on day 2 and in monocytes/macrophages on day 3 after AMI.

{"title": "Control of spiral waves in optogenetically modified cardiac tissue by periodic optical stimulation.", "abstract": "Resonant drift of nonlinear spiral waves occurs in various types of excitable media under periodic stimulation. Recently a novel methodology of optogenetics has emerged, which allows to affect excitability of cardiac cells and tissues by optical stimuli. In this paper we study if resonant drift of spiral waves in the heart can be induced by a homogeneous weak periodic optical stimulation of cardiac tissue. We use a two-variable and a detailed model of cardiac tissue and add description of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing optogenetic ionic currents. We show that weak periodic optical stimulation at a frequency equal to the natural rotation frequency of the spiral wave induces resonant drift for both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing optogenetic currents. We quantify these effects and study how the speed of the drift and its direction depend on the initial conditions. We also derive analytical formulas based on the response function theory which correctly predict the drift velocity and its trajectory. We conclude that optogenetic methodology can be used for control of spiral waves in cardiac tissue and discuss its possible applications.", "journal": "Physical review.

Both pyroptosis and necroptosis are involved in the systemic inflammatory response and contribute to regional myocardial I/R injury. This study aimed to explore the effect of necrosulfonamide (NSA) on post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction in a rat model of cardiac arrest. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly categorized to Sham, CPR and CPR-NSA groups. For rats in the latter two groups, ventricular fibrillation was induced without treatment for 6\u00a0min, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) being sustained for 8\u00a0min. Rats were injected with NSA (10\u00a0mg/kg in DMSO) or vehicle at 5\u00a0min following return of spontaneous circulation. Myocardial function was measured by echocardiography, survival and neurological deficit score (NDS) were recorded at 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h after ROSC. Western blotting was used to assess pyroptosis- and necroptosis-related protein expression. ELISAs were used to measure levels of inflammatory cytokine. Rats in the CPR-NSA group were found to exhibit superior post-resuscitation myocardial function, and better NDS values in the group of CPR-NSA. Rats in the group of CPR-NSA exhibited median survival duration of 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0h as compared to 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021\u00a0h in the CPR group. After treatment with NSA, NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), GSDMD-N, phosphorylated-MLKL, and phosphorylated-RIP3 levels in cardiac tissue were reduced with corresponding reductions in inflammatory cytokine levels. Administration of NSA significantly improved myocardial dysfunction succeeding global myocardial I/R injury and enhanced survival outcomes through protective mechanisms potentially related to inhibition of pyroptosis and necroptosis pathways.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2022-05-20", "authors": ["FenglianHe", "GuanghuiZheng", "JuntaoHu", "WeiweiGe", "XianfeiJi", "Jennifer LBradley", "Mary AnnPeberdy", "Joseph POrnato", "WanchunTang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.175037"}
{"title": "Lactate modulates cardiac gene expression in mice during acute physical exercise.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to verify the role of lactate as a signaling molecule in cardiac tissue under physiological conditions. C57BL6/J male mice were submitted to acute running bouts on a treadmill at different exercise intensities (30, 60, and 90% of maximal speed - Smax) under the effect of two doses (0.5 and 5 mM) of \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycynnamate (CINN), a blocker of lactate transporters. Cardiac lactate levels, activity of the enzymes of glycolytic [hexokinase (HK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] and oxidative metabolism [citrate synthase (CS)], and expression of genes also related to metabolism [LDH, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2), cytochrome oxidase IV (COX-IV), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1)] were evaluated. Elevated cardiac lactate levels were observed after high intensity running at 90% of Smax, which were parallel to increased activity of the HK and CS enzymes and mRNA levels of PGC-1\u03b1 and COX-IV. No changes were observed in cardiac lactate levels in mice running at lower exercise intensities. Interestingly, prior intraperitoneal administration (15 min) of CINN (0.5 mM) significantly reduced cardiac lactate concentration, activities of HK and CS, and mRNA levels of PGC-1\u03b1 and COX-IV in mice that ran at 90% of Smax. In addition, cardiac lactate levels were significantly correlated to both PGC-1\u03b1 and COX-IV cardiac gene expression.

{"title": "Interplay between SERCA, 4E-BP, and eIF4E in the Drosophila heart.", "abstract": "Appropriate cardiac performance depends on a tightly controlled handling of Ca2+ in a broad range of species, from invertebrates to mammals. The role of the Ca2+ ATPase, SERCA, in Ca2+ handling is pivotal, and its activity is regulated, inter alia, by interacting with distinct proteins. Herein, we give evidence that 4E binding protein (4E-BP) is a novel regulator of SERCA activity in Drosophila melanogaster during cardiac function. Flies over-expressing 4E-BP showed improved cardiac performance in young individuals associated with incremented SERCA activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that SERCA interacts with translation initiation factors eIF4E-1, eIF4E-2 and eIF4E-4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. The specific identification of eIF4E-4 in cardiac tissue leads us to propose that the interaction of elF4E-4 with SERCA may be the basis of the cardiac effects observed in 4E-BP over-expressing flies associated with incremented SERCA activity.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2022-05-20", "authors": ["ManuelaSantalla", "AlejandraGarc\u00eda", "AliciaMattiazzi", "Carlos AValverde", "RonjaSchiemann", "AchimPaululat", "GrecoHern\u00e1ndez", "HeikoMeyer", "PaolaFerrero"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0267156\n10.1038/nrm2838\n10.1073/pnas.100391597\n10.1128/MCB.23.24.9117-9126.2003\n10.1038/nrm2672\n10.1016/j.mod.2004.11.011\n10.1038/35078571\n10.1101/gad.845700\n10.1101/gad.835000\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00504.x\n10.1146/annurev.ph.41.030179.002353\n10.1038/415198a\n10.3390/ijms20010002\n10.1073/pnas.0609278104\n10.1371/journal.pone.0101871\n10.1002/gene.10139\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.238105\n10.1016/j.asd.2012.02.002\n10.3791/1425\n10.1038/s41598-018-30638-9\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.003bo.x\n10.1016/s0076-6879(00)28386-9\n10.1111/jam.14176\n10.1016/j.febslet.2010.01.017\n10.1101/gad.1311805\n10.1242/dev.073122\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302022\n10.1073/pnas.93.11.5578\n10.33549/physiolres.932320\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00669\n10.1007/s11010-011-1092-y\n10.1016/j.cmet.2013.10.001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310230\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00562\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.t01-1-00681.x\n10.1079/bjn19940150\n10.7554/eLife.19430\n10.1016/j.cmet.2006.05.013\n10.1002/jcp.21197\n10.1038/nrm3495\n10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.5.H2183\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.7554/eLife.29104\n10.1126/sciadv.abb8771\n10.1002/pmic.201700108\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259754\n10.3390/ijms20112774\n10.1016/j.bbapap.2016.06.015"}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of mitofilin in alleviating AMI.\nRecombinant adenoviral vectors for mitofilin overexpression or mitofilin knockdown were constructed, respectively. A mouse AMI model was established and the effect of mitofilin on myocardial pyroptosis was examined by detecting the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and inflammatory factors. Moreover, a cellular model of AMI was established by treating cardiomyocytes with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a western blot analysis were used to detect the effect of mitofilin knockdown on the expression of pyroptosis-related factors. Furthermore, the regulatory role of mitofilin in PI3K/AKT pathway was evaluated by the western blot and PI3K inhibitor.\nMitofilin was downregulated in the heart tissue of the AMI mice and H/R induced cardiomyocytes. The overexpression of mitofilin significantly alleviated AMI and reduced pyroptosis-related factors. Meanwhile, in cardiomyocytes, mitofilin knockdown aggravated cellular damages by promoting pyroptosis.

{"title": "Using 7.0\u00a0T cardiac magnetic resonance to investigate the effect of estradiol on biventricular structure and function of ovariectomized rats exposed to chronic hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude.", "abstract": "Despite that estradiol can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases in ovariectomized animals in the plains, its effect on animals at high altitude has seldom been reported. We hypothesize that estradiol can ameliorate cardiac damage to ovariectomized rats induced by chronic exposure to hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude.\nThis study was intended to investigate whether cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging could reveal cardioprotective effect of estradiol on ovariectomized rats under chronic exposure to hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude.\nThirty-two rats were randomized into the Control group (Plain), HH\u00a0+\u00a0Sham group (Hypobaric Hypoxia\u00a0+\u00a0Sham), HH\u00a0+\u00a0OVX group (Hypobaric Hypoxia\u00a0+\u00a0Bilateral Ovariectomy) and HH-OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E2 group (Hypobaric Hypoxia\u00a0+\u00a0Bilateral Ovariectomy\u00a0+\u00a0Estradiol, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, 3 times a week, for 6 weeks) (n\u00a0=\u00a08 per group). Except the Control group (altitude: 500\u00a0m), rats in other groups were subcutaneously injected with 17\u03b2 -estradiol or vehicle and exposed to chronic hypobaric hypoxia in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (altitude: 4250\u00a0m), China, for 6 weeks. Biventricular cardiac function and global strain of the rats were measured by CMR and analyzed using the cine tissue tracking techniques. Biochemical tests, histopathology and electronic microscopy were used to evaluate the protective effect of estradiol on the heart tissue of ovariectomized rats exposed to a high-altitude environment.\nThe biventricular ejection fraction and global strains decreased in the HH\u00a0+\u00a0OVX group compared with that in the Control group (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All the aforementioned changes in the HH\u00a0+\u00a0OVX group ameliorated in the HH-OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E2 group (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Estradiol also alleviated the right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy in the HH\u00a0+\u00a0OVX group (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

{"title": "Piezo2 is not an indispensable mechanosensor in murine cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "A short-term increase in ventricular filling leads to an immediate (Frank-Starling mechanism) and a slower (Anrep effect) rise in cardiac contractility, while long-term increased cardiac load (e.g., in arterial hypertension) decreases contractility. Whether these answers to mechanical tension are mediated by specific sensors in cardiomyocytes remains elusive. In this study, the piezo2 protein was evaluated as a potential mechanosensor.

{"title": "Custodiol-N versus Custodiol: a prospective randomized double-blind multicentre phase III trial in patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery.", "abstract": "HTK-Solution (Custodiol) is a well-established cardioplegic and organ preservation solution. We currently developed a novel HTK-based solution, Custodiol-N, which includes iron chelators to reduce oxidative injury, as well as l-arginine, to improve endothelial function. In this first-in-human study, Custodiol-N was compared to Custodiol in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery. The aim of this comparison was to evaluate the safety and ability of Custodiol-N to protect cardiac tissue.\nThe study was designed as a prospective randomized double-blind non-inferiority trial. Primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of creatine kinase muscle-brain (CK-MB) within the first 24\u2009h after surgery. Secondary end points included peak CK-MB and troponin-T and AUC of troponin-T release, cardiac index, cumulative catecholamine dose, intensive care unit stay and mortality. All values in the abstract are given as mean \u00b1 SD, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\nEarly termination of the trial was performed per protocol as the primary non-inferiority end-point was reached after inclusion of 101 patients. CK-MB AUC (878\u00b1549 vs 779\u00b1439\u2009h U/l, non-inferiority P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001, Custodiol vs Custodiol-N) and troponin-T AUC (12990\u00b18347 vs 13498\u00b16513\u2009h pg/ml, noninferiority P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001, Custodiol vs Custodiol-N) were similar in both groups. Although the trial was designed for non-inferiority, peak CK-MB (52\u00b140 vs 42\u00b128 U/l, superiority P\u2009&lt;\u20090.03, Custodiol vs Custodiol-N) was significantly lower in the Custodiol-N group.\nThis study shows that Custodiol-N is safe and provides similar cardiac protection as the established HTK-Custodiol solution. Significantly reduced peak CK-MB levels in the Custodiol-N group in the full analysis set may implicate a beneficial effect on ischaemia/reperfusion injury in the setting of coronary bypass surgery.", "journal": "European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery", "date": "2022-05-18", "authors": ["G\u00e1borSzab\u00f3", "PaigeBrlecic", "SivakkananLoganathan", "FlorianWagner", "ArdawanRastan", "TorstenDoenst", "MatthiasKarck", "G\u00e1borVeres"], "doi": "10.1093/ejcts/ezac287"}
{"title": "Muscle contractions and pain sensation accompanying high-frequency electroporation pulses.", "abstract": "To minimize neuromuscular electrical stimulation during electroporation-based treatments, the replacement of long monophasic pulses with bursts of biphasic high-frequency pulses in the range of microseconds was suggested in order to reduce muscle contraction and pain sensation due to pulse application. This treatment modality appeared under the term high-frequency electroporation (HF-EP), which can be potentially used for some clinical applications of electroporation such as electrochemotherapy, gene electrotransfer, and tissue ablation. In cardiac tissue ablation, which utilizes irreversible electroporation, the treatment is being established as Pulsed Field Ablation. While the reduction of muscle contractions was confirmed in multiple in vivo studies, the reduction of pain sensation in humans was not confirmed yet, nor was the relationship between muscle contraction and pain sensation investigated. This is the first study in humans examining pain sensation using biphasic high-frequency electroporation pulses. Twenty-five healthy individuals were subjected to electrical stimulation of the tibialis anterior muscle with biphasic high-frequency pulses in the range of few microseconds and both, symmetric and asymmetric interphase and interpulse delays. Our results confirm that biphasic high-frequency pulses with a pulse width of 1 or 2\u00a0\u00b5s reduce muscle contraction and pain sensation as opposed to currently used longer monophasic pulses. In addition, interphase and interpulse delays play a significant role in reducing the muscle contraction and/or pain sensation. The study shows that the range of the optimal pulse parameters may be increased depending on the prerequisites of the therapy. However, further evaluation of the biphasic pulse protocols presented herein is necessary to confirm the efficiency of the newly proposed HF-EP.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-05-17", "authors": ["AleksandraCvetkoska", "AlenkaMa\u010dek-Lebar", "PeterTrdina", "DamijanMiklav\u010di\u010d", "MatejReber\u0161ek"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-12112-9\n10.1146/annurev-biophys-052118-115451\n10.1177/153303460700600401\n10.1089/bioe.2019.0029\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071813-104622\n10.1148/radiol.2020192190\n10.1111/jce.14980\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.06.002\n10.1007/s00232-014-9737-x\n10.1186/s13068-016-0508-z\n10.1016/0277-5379(91)90064-K\n10.1186/1475-925X-13-29\n10.1080/0284186X.2018.1454602\n10.1016/j.ejso.2018.11.023\n10.2174/1566523216666160331130040\n10.1517/17425247.2016.1121990\n10.1016/j.jvir.2014.01.028\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2367543\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2238672\n10.1016/j.jacep.2018.06.005\n10.1111/jce.13454\n10.1007/s10840-019-00574-3\n10.1111/jce.14414\n10.1161/CIRCEP.119.008192\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316402\n10.2214/AJR.10.4490\n10.1016/j.ejcsup.2006.08.002\n10.7785/tcrt.2012.500249\n10.1002/bem.20566\n10.1097/00000542-200306000-00006\n10.5812/aapm.22786\n10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181d27b30\n10.1080/0284186X.2018.1454602\n10.1016/S0003-9993(98)90006-5\n10.1007/BF02344716\n10.1093/ptj/72.11.800\n10.2522/ptj.20080338\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2004.07.004\n10.1038/srep14999\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2102021\n10.1186/1475-925X-10-102\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa8c53\n10.1016/j.hpb.2016.06.015\n10.1109/TBME.2017.2690624\n10.1109/TDEI.2018.006303\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.05.036\n10.1016/j.jvir.2019.01.032\n10.1177/1533033818788078\n10.1016/j.jvir.2017.12.019\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2014.07.010\n10.1177/1533033818789692\n10.1161/CIRCEP.121.010168\n10.2478/raon-2019-0025\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2021.107803\n10.1016/0014-4886(76)90236-3\n10.1016/j.clinph.2011.06.016\n10.1007/BF02456749\n10.1093/brain/119.2.439\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2004.10.020\n10.1016/j.ejcsup.2006.08.003\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2016.06.024\n10.1016/0304-3959(87)91074-8\n10.2340/16501977-0999\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012944\n10.1053/apmr.2001.23310\n10.1093/ptj/pzx053\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0707372\n10.1093/ptj/58.12.1467\n10.1080/02656736.2021.1912417\n10.1007/BF02363130\n10.1109/TBME.1983.325041\n10.1109/TPS.2004.831758\n10.1126/science.150.3699.971\n10.1016/S1082-3174(96)80050-X\n10.1016/j.pain.2013.12.010\n10.1093/pm/pnab177\n10.1177/154596830001400308\n10.1590/S1413-78522011000200002\n10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000276\n10.4161/hv.24702\n10.1080/0284186X.2017.1315171"}

Here we compare the two syndromes using a computational toolbox of two gene signatures that were developed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e., the viral pandemic (ViP) and severe-ViP signatures and a 13-transcript signature previously demonstrated to be diagnostic for KD, and validated our findings in whole blood RNA sequences, serum cytokines, and formalin fixed heart tissues. Results show that KD and MIS-C are on the same continuum of the host immune response as COVID-19. Both the pediatric syndromes converge upon an IL15/IL15RA-centric cytokine storm, suggestive of shared proximal pathways of immunopathogenesis; however, they diverge in other laboratory parameters and cardiac phenotypes. The ViP signatures reveal unique targetable cytokine pathways in MIS-C, place MIS-C farther along in the spectrum in severity compared to KD and pinpoint key clinical (reduced cardiac function) and laboratory (thrombocytopenia and eosinopenia) parameters that can be useful to monitor severity.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2022-05-17", "authors": ["PradiptaGhosh", "Gajanan DKatkar", "ChisatoShimizu", "JihoonKim", "SoniKhandelwal", "Adriana HTremoulet", "John TKanegaye", "NoneNone", "JosephBocchini", "SoumitaDas", "Jane CBurns", "DebashisSahoo"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-022-30357-w\n10.1056/NEJMe2023158\n10.1001/jama.2020.10369\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31094-1\n10.1136/bmj.m2094\n10.1542/peds.54.3.271\n10.2188/jea.JE20140089\n10.3389/fped.2019.00244\n10.1371/journal.pone.0191087\n10.1056/NEJMoa2021756\n10.1542/peds.2008-1871\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.034\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.016\n10.1126/sciimmunol.abf7570\n10.1016/j.immuni.2021.04.003\n10.1038/s41591-020-1054-6\n10.1038/s41584-020-00566-y\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103390\n10.1091/mbc.E19-01-0013\n10.1038/nature09907\n10.1038/nm1174\n10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181baa3c2\n10.1253/circj.CJ-66-0096\n10.1136/archdischild-2012-302841\n10.2188/jea.6.148\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.690875\n10.1007/s00246-009-9599-7\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.09.043\n10.1038/s41598-018-33124-4\n10.4084/mjhid.2020.039\n10.1097/INF.0b013e3181dba70b\n10.1016/j.jfma.2013.12.008\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.048360\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.09.002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.08.056\n10.1136/ard.62.3.264\n10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.2293\n10.1038/s41588-018-0102-3\n10.1016/j.coph.2004.04.003\n10.1038/nrd3800\n10.1038/s41591-020-1051-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30858-8\n10.1093/labmed/lmaa067\n10.1016/j.ijid.2020.08.002\n10.1111/jth.14975\n10.1007/s00277-020-04019-0\n10.1016/j.gendis.2019.09.003\n10.3389/fped.2020.614386\n10.1371/journal.pone.0244721\n10.3389/fped.2020.559389\n10.1007/s00246-012-0293-9\n10.1111/j.1399-3038.2008.00779.x\n10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.021\n10.1111/jcmm.15296\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000061\n10.1172/JCI149633\n10.2217/fmb.13.104\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00649\n10.1186/s12959-018-0170-8\n10.1186/2052-0492-1-9\n10.1016/j.jcrc.2015.11.010\n10.1016/S2352-3026(20)30217-9\n10.3389/fcimb.2020.00364\n10.1111/all.13811\n10.1128/iai.15.2.410-416.1977\n10.1172/JCI109789\n10.1186/cc6883\n10.1016/j.jcrc.2010.03.002\n10.1007/s00134-011-2170-z\n10.1111/all.14452\n10.3346/jkms.2013.28.1.114\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000484\n10.1093/nar/gki022\n10.1093/nar/gks1193\n10.1093/nar/30.1.207\n10.1093/nar/gng015\n10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.249\n10.1186/1471-2105-12-323\n10.1093/nar/gkm284\n10.1186/gb-2008-9-10-r157\n10.1093/nar/gkx1132"}
{"title": "Directional dependence on concomitant pressure and volume increases during left ventricular filling.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction continues to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. A major challenge post-myocardial infarction is scar tissue growth, which eventually can lead to heart failure. Cardiovascular regenerative strategies to minimize scar tissue growth and promote cardiac tissue formation are currently being actively pursued via the development of cardiac patches. However, the patch must have viscoelastic properties that mimic healthy cardiac tissues to facilitate proper cardiac patch-to-cell communications. To this end, we investigated the tissue microstructure and the stress relaxation properties of the porcine left ventricle (LV) along its long and short axes using a nanoindentation technique. We found significantly higher collagen density along the long axis than the short axis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We then identified a much more rapid stress relaxation along the porcine LV's short axis compared to its long axis during the diastolic filling timeframe. Therefore, these findings show that concomitant LV pressure and volume increases from blood filling during diastole are directional dependent, with its short axis responsible for increase in LV volume and the long axis responsible for increase in LV pressure. These directional-dependent stress relaxation properties are essential in the design of structurally, bio-mimetic cardiac patches to support cardiac function and regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2022-05-17", "authors": ["Yih-MeiLin", "LiaPaolino", "LihuaLou", "AriadnaHerrera", "ErikaPierre", "ArvindAgarwal", "SharanRamaswamy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.111129"}

Rats in HFpEF + I group were given Kangdaxin oral liquid at a dose of 2.7 mL/(kg\u00b7d). After modeling or treatment, the value of E/A and E/e' in each group of rats were measured by echocardiography.

Heart weight/body mass index (Hw/W) and left ventricular weight/body mass index (LVw/W) were calculated after the rats were sacrificed; the transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) protein expression level in cardiac tissue was detected by western blot.\nCompared with sham group, the values of diastolic function item (E/A) and mitral annular early diastolic velocity (E/e') in HFpEF group were significantly decreased, and the level of NT-proBNP was significantly increased (P<0.05). Compared with HFpEF group, the value of E/A and E/e' in HF + I group were significantly increased, and the level of NT-proBNP was significantly decreased (P<0.05).

Vahl., has shown anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-virus activities as well as renal protective effects on diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we investigated whether phillyrin attenuated cardiac hypertrophy induced by catecholamine in vivo and in vitro, and explored the underlying mechanisms. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneous injection of norepinephrine (NE, a key catecholamine), and in rat cardiomyoblasts (H9c2) by stimulation with NE in vitro. Our results showed that administration of phillyrin (100\u00a0mg/kg, i.p. for 15 days) significantly improved cardiac function, histopathological changes, cardiac hypertrophy and decreased the upregulated hypertrophic markers (ANP, BNP, and \u03b2-MHC). Moreover, treatment with phillyrin obviously reduced the infiltration of the CD68 positive macrophages and the mRNA expression of proinflammatory genes (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) in left ventricular tissue. In addition, treatment with phillyrin markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-\u03baB p65 in heart tissues. Furthermore, in NE-treated H9c2 cells, pretreatment with phillyrin clearly attenuated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reduced ROS production and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-\u03baB p65 in vitro.

Scaffolds were developed through single nozzle electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning, respectively, to serve as scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering. Uniform fibrous structures were revealed in the scaffolds with significantly varying average fiber diameters of 760 \u00b1 80 nm (f-gelatin), 420 \u00b1 110 nm [f-gelatin and PCL (1:1)], and 810 \u00b1 60 nm (coaxial f-gelatin > PCL) via scanning electron microscopy. The distinction between the core and the sheath of the fibers of the coaxial f-gelatin > PCL electrospun fibrous scaffolds was revealed by transmission electron microscopy. Thermal analysis and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed no interactions between the polymers in the blended electrospun scaffolds. The varied blending methods led to significant differences in the elastic moduli of the electrospun scaffolds with the coaxial f-gelatin > PCL revealing the highest elastic modulus of all scaffolds (164 \u00b1 3.85 kPa). All scaffolds exhibited excellent biocompatibility by supporting the adhesion and proliferation of human AC16 cardiomyocytes cells. The biocompatibility of the coaxial f-gelatin > PCL scaffolds with superior elastic modulus was assessed further through adhesion and functionality of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes, thereby demonstrating the potential of the coaxially spun scaffolds as an ideal platform for developing cardiac tissue-on-a-chip models.

{"title": "NEU1 Regulates Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism and Oxidative Stress Post-myocardial Infarction in Mice ", "abstract": "Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) participates in the response to multiple receptor signals and regulates various cellular metabolic behaviors. Importantly, it is closely related to the occurrence and progression of cardiovascular diseases. Because ischemic heart disease is often accompanied by impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions and possible mechanisms of NEU1 in myocardial remodeling and mitochondrial metabolism induced by myocardial infarction (MI).\nIn this study, the MI-induced mouse mode, hypoxia-treated H9C2 cells model, and hypoxia-treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) model were constructed. Echocardiography and histological analysis were adopted to evaluate the morphology and function of the heart at the whole heart level. Western blot was adopted to determine the related expression level of signaling pathway proteins and mitochondria. Mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidative stress were detected by various testing kits.\nNeuraminidase 1 was markedly upregulated in MI cardiac tissue. Cardiomyocyte-specific NEU1 deficiency restored cardiac function, cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial interstitial fibrosis. What is more, cardiomyocyte-specific NEU1 deficiency inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by MI. Further experiments found that the sirtuin-1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator \u03b1 (SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1) protein level in MI myocardium was down-regulated, which was closely related to the above-mentioned mitochondrial changes. Cardiomyocyte-specific NEU1 deficiency increased the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM); which improved mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity or PGC-1\u03b1 activity eliminated the beneficial effects of cardiomyocyte-specific NEU1 deficiency. PGC-1\u03b1 knockout mice experiments verified that NEU1 inhibition restored cardiac function induced by MI through SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway.\nCardiomyocyte-specific NEU1 deficiency can alleviate MI-induced myocardial remodeling, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial energy metabolism disorder. In terms of mechanism, the specific deletion of NEU1 may play a role by enhancing the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway. Therefore, cardiomyocyte-specific NEU1 may provide an alternative treatment strategy for heart failure post-MI.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-05-14", "authors": ["ZhenGuo", "DiFan", "Fang-YuanLiu", "Shu-QingMa", "PengAn", "DanYang", "Min-YuWang", "ZhengYang", "Qi-ZhuTang"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2022.821317\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000573\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306567\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61889-4\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.79\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60683-3\n10.1152/physrev.00022.2018\n10.1111/jcmm.15127\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312017\n10.21037/atm.2018.06.21\n10.1038/nm.2507\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00116-8\n10.1038/s41598-017-04593-w\n10.1038/nature10490\n10.1016/j.addr.2009.06.006\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.037\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601633\n10.1016/j.mad.2016.02.003\n10.1093/glycob/cws057\n10.1182/blood-2017-08-743229\n10.1007/s00395-020-00821-z\n10.1016/0002-8703(87)90307-3\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab347\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223925\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315806\n10.1038/s41401-020-00587-z\n10.3791/4131\n10.1373/clinchem.2005.050146\n10.1007/s002280050589\n10.1016/0009-8981(94)90270-4\n10.1111/jcmm.15719\n10.18632/aging.102647\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101771\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031139\n10.1002/cphy.c150006\n10.1093/cvr/cvr312\n10.1089/ars.2011.3999\n10.1016/j.mito.2006.11.017\n10.1111/jcmm.13330\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.09.038\n10.2353/ajpath.2008.071081\n10.2337/db12-1825\n10.1684/epd.2016.0845\n10.1194/jlr.M027300\n10.1152/ajpregu.00409.2009\n10.1038/nature03354\n10.1038/nrm1616\n10.3945/ajcn.110.001917\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.07.019\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002480\n10.1152/ajpheart.00124.2018\n10.1126/science.283.5407.1482\n10.1161/01.RES.88.5.529\n10.1038/nature00904\n10.1016/j.cmet.2008.07.006\n10.1042/CS20160030\n10.1016/j.neuint.2017.05.009\n10.1139/cjpp-2014-0060\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.10.020"}
{"title": "Exogenous insulin promotes the expression of B-cell translocation gene 1 and 2 in chicken pectoralis.", "abstract": "B-cell translocation genes (BTG) have been proved to play important roles in carbohydrate metabolism through modifying insulin homeostasis and glucose metabolism. This study, therefore, was conducted to investigate the effects of exogenous insulin on the expression of BTG1 and BTG2 in chickens. Twenty-four-day-old broilers and layers were fasted for 16 h and randomly assigned to insulin treatment group (subcutaneously injected with 5 IU/kg body weight) or control group (received an equivalent volume of phosphate-buffered saline). Blood glucose concentration was measured, and it showed that the blood glucose concentrations in the layers were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that in the broilers under fasting state. Response to exogenous insulin, the blood glucose concentrations were greatly reduced in both breeds. Of note, the blood glucose concentration restored to 62% of the basal state at 240 min (P < 0.05) after insulin stimulation in layers, whereas it was still in low level until 240 min in broilers (under fast state). Tissue profiling revealed that both BTG1 and BTG2 were abundantly expressed in the skeletal muscles of broilers. A negative correlation was observed between blood glucose and BTG1 (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0.289, P\u00a0=\u00a00.031) /BTG2 (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0.500, P < 0.001) in pectoralis, and BTG1 (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0.462, P < 0.001) in pancreas. As blood glucose decreased due to exogenous insulin administration (under fast state), the expression of both BTG1 and BTG2 notably upregulated in birds' pectoralis at 120 min and/or 240 min, meanwhile pancreas BTG1 was also upregulated. Re-feeding at 120 min elevated the blood glucose and reduced the expression of BTG genes in pectoralis generally. In addition, the change of BTG1 and BTG2 expression showed distinct difference between layers and broilers at 120 min and 240 min after insulin stimulation in pectoralis, pancreas and heart tissue; even after re-feeding at 120 min, BTG2 expression at 240 min after insulin injection was downregulated in the pectoralis of layers, while it was upregulated in that broilers. Collectively, these results indicated that response to exogenous insulin, chicken blood glucose exhibited breed-specific dynamic change, and meanwhile the expressions of both BTG1 and BTG2 genes in chickens were significantly altered by exogenous insulin in a breed- and tissue-specific manner. BTG1 and BTG2 genes may negatively regulate bird's blood glucose by promoting the glucose uptake corporately in pectoralis, and through regulating the insulin secretion in pancreas (especially BTG1).", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2022-05-12", "authors": ["J HZhao", "X LZhang", "L GGao", "Y JGuo", "Z YWang", "C CSu", "H YZhang", "WChen", "Y QHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.psj.2022.101875"}

To test the etiology of this aspect of influenza disease, we generated a novel recombinant heart-attenuated influenza virus via genome incorporation of target sequences for miRNAs expressed in cardiomyocytes. Compared with control virus, mice infected with miR-targeted virus had significantly reduced heart viral titers, confirming cardiac attenuation of viral replication. However, this virus was fully replicative in the lungs and induced similar systemic inflammation and weight loss compared to control virus. The miR-targeted virus induced fewer cardiac conduction irregularities and significantly less fibrosis in mice lacking interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), which serve as a model for influenza-associated cardiac pathology.

In the rotor-driven functional re-entry arrhythmia, tissue heterogeneity results on the generation of spiral/scroll waves and wave break dynamics that may cause dangerous sustainable fibrillation. The selection of the target region to perform thermal ablation to mitigate this type of arrhythmia is challenging, since it considerably affects the local electrophysiology dynamics. This work deals with the numerical simulation of the thermal ablation of a cardiac muscle tissue and its effects on the dynamics of rotor-driven functional re-entry arrhythmia. A non-homogeneous two-dimensional rectangular region is used in the present numerical analysis, where radiofrequency ablation is performed. The electrophysiology problem for the propagation of the action potential in the cardiac tissue is simulated with the Fenton-Karma model. Thermal damage caused to the tissue by the radiofrequency heating is modeled by the Arrhenius equation. The effects of size and position of a heterogeneous region in the original muscle tissue were first analyzed, in order to verify the possible existence of the functional re-entry arrhythmia during the time period considered in the simulations. For each case that exhibited re-entry arrhythmia, six different ablation procedures were analyzed, depending on the position of the radiofrequency electrode and heating time. The obtained results revealed the effects of different model parameters on the existence and possible mitigation of the functional re-entry arrhythmia.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2022-05-12", "authors": ["EberDantas", "Helcio R BOrlande", "George SDulikravich"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.3614"}

The purpose of this study is to ascertain the nature and extent of metabolic reprogramming in human HCM, and its potential impact on contractile function.\nWe conducted proteomic and targeted, quantitative metabolomic analyses on heart tissue from patients with HCM and from nonfailing control human hearts.\nIn the proteomic analysis, the greatest differences observed in HCM samples compared with controls were increased abundances of extracellular matrix and intermediate filament proteins and decreased abundances of muscle creatine kinase and mitochondrial proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation. These differences in protein abundance were coupled with marked reductions in acyl carnitines, byproducts of fatty acid oxidation, in HCM samples. Conversely, the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate, branched chain amino acids, and their breakdown products, were all significantly increased in HCM hearts. ATP content, phosphocreatine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and its phosphate derivatives, NADP and NADPH, and acetyl CoA were also severely reduced in HCM compared with control hearts. Functional assays performed on human skinned myocardial fibers demonstrated that the magnitude of observed reduction in ATP content in the HCM samples would be expected to decrease the rate of cross-bridge detachment. Moreover, left atrial size, an indicator of diastolic compliance, was inversely correlated with ATP content in hearts from patients with HCM.\nHCM hearts display profound deficits in nucleotide availability with markedly reduced capacity for fatty acid oxidation and increases in ketone bodies and branched chain amino acids.

Severe patients were often accompanied by cardiac injury, and once the heart gets damaged, the mortality of patients will significantly increase. The main clinical manifestations of cardiac injury range from myocarditis, heart failure (HF), arrhythmia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). A high abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) on the membrane of cardiomyocytes makes it possible that the virus can directly attack cardiomyocytes as subsequently evidenced by the detection of spike protein and virus RNA in autopsy cardiac tissues. The secondary myocardial injury through systemic inflammatory and immune response also caused obvious cardiac damage. The pathological manifestations of heart tissue were diverse, varied from mild cardiomyocyte edema, myocardial hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte degeneration, and necrosis to severe myocarditis caused by lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration.

{"title": "[Evolutionary cardiology and experimental research].", "abstract": "Evolutionary medicine studies the role of evolution in health problems. Diseases are considered as phenotypes generated by the expression of sets of genes and a complex interplay with the environment. The main mechanisms involved in evolutionary medicine are antagonistic pleiotropy, ecological antagonistic pleiotropy, atavisms and heterochrony. Antagonistic pleiotropism refers to genes that are beneficial during certain stages of development but become detrimental in others. Ecological antagonistic pleiotropy refers to the misadaptation to current lifestyle conditions which are different from those in which humans evolved. These mechanisms participate in the development of congestive heart failure, hypertension and atherosclerosis. Atavistic conditions or genes are expressed in our ancestors but have remained silent during evolution being suddenly expressed without an apparent cause during the appearance of a disease is another mechanism in evolutionary cardiology. The change in the heart metabolism from fatty acid to glucose dependent can be considered as an atavistic condition that appears in the heart after a stroke and may underlie impaired cardiomyocyte regeneration. Heterochrony is the expression of genes that cause the appearance of traits at a different timing during development and is therefore related to atavisms. Evolutionary medicine explains the interactions of pathogens and the host in infectious diseases where the cardiac tissue becomes a target. Mechanisms involved in evolutionary medicine participate in the generation of diseases and may be approached experimentally. Therefore, to better understand health problems and therapeutical approaches, an evolutionary medicine approach in experimental medicine may prove useful.\nLa medicina evolutiva estudia el papel de la evoluci\u00f3n en los problemas de salud.

PAF patients exhibited higher LA volumes than controls, while their LA emptying fraction and LA LS was significantly lower in all three phases. In contrast, the corresponding emptying volumes (total, passive and active) were similar in both groups.

Nine-week-old mice were divided into four groups for a 12-week diet and/or exercise intervention including: (1) Control Diet without HIIT (CD), (2) Control Diet with HIIT (CD+HIIT), (3) OO diet (10% kcal from olive oil) without HIIT, and (4) OO diet with HIIT (OO+HIIT). Neither dietary OO or HIIT altered body weight, glucose tolerance, or serum lipids. HIIT, regardless of diet, increased aerobic capacity and HDL cholesterol levels. In liver and heart tissue, OO resulted in similar adaptations as HIIT including increased mitochondrial content and fatty acid oxidation but combining OO with HIIT did not augment these effects. In skeletal muscle, HIIT increased mitochondrial content in type II fibers similarly between diets. An RNA sequencing analysis on type I fibers revealed OO reduced muscle regeneration and lipid metabolism gene abundance, whereas HIIT increased the abundance of these genes, independent of diet. HIIT training, independent of diet, induced subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) hypertrophy, whereas OO induced gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) hypertrophy, an effect that was augmented with HIIT.

{"title": "Impact of RSUME Actions on Biomolecular Modifications in Physio-Pathological Processes.", "abstract": "The small RWD domain-containing protein called RSUME or RWDD3 was cloned from pituitary tumor cells with increasing tumorigenic and angiogenic proficiency. RSUME expression is induced under hypoxia or heat shock and is upregulated, at several pathophysiological stages, in tissues like pituitary, kidney, heart, pancreas, or adrenal gland. To date, several factors with essential roles in endocrine-related cancer appear to be modulated by RWDD3. RSUME regulates, through its post-translational (PTM) modification, pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) protein stability in pituitary tumors. Interestingly, in these tumors, another PTM, the regulation of EGFR levels by USP8, plays a pathogenic role. Furthermore, RSUME suppresses ubiquitin conjugation to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by blocking VHL E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, contributing to the development of von Hippel-Lindau disease. RSUME enhances protein SUMOylation of specific targets involved in inflammation such as IkB and the glucocorticoid receptor. For many of its actions, RSUME associates with regulatory proteins of ubiquitin and SUMO cascades, such as the E2-SUMO conjugase Ubc9 or the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL. New evidence about RSUME involvement in inflammatory and hypoxic conditions, such as cardiac tissue response to ischemia and neuropathic pain, and its role in several developmental processes, is discussed as well. Given the modulation of PTMs by RSUME in neuroendocrine tumors, we focus on its interactors and its mode of action.

A detailed understanding of the development of CO will help us design better methods, explore and expand its application in the cardiovascular field.", "journal": "Stem cell reviews and reports", "date": "2022-05-08", "authors": ["LiyuanZhu", "KuiLiu", "QiFeng", "YingnanLiao"], "doi": "10.1007/s12015-022-10385-1\n10.1007/s00018-012-1078-2\n10.1038/s41580-020-0259-3\n10.1242/dev.140731\n10.1038/ncb3312\n10.1002/bit.26504\n10.1016/j.scr.2015.08.002\n10.1038/nprot.2015.089\n10.1126/science.1177350\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.12.008\n10.1161/01.RES.0000196562.73231.7d\n10.1089/ten.tec.2014.0376\n10.1038/s41598-017-06385-8\n10.1038/s41467-021-21029-2\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.05.004\n10.3389/fmolb.2020.00014\n10.1007/978-1-4939-9030-6_4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0209162\n10.1007/978-1-0716-0520-2_12\n10.1016/j.healun.2015.06.001\n10.1089/ten.tec.2019.0228\n10.1161/01.RES.0000257776.05673.ff\n10.1002/adhm.201500331\n10.1002/jbm.a.31578\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.04.027\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.09.016\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1016/j.scr.2017.01.006\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.05.002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00546.2020\n10.1002/adhm.201801217\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306874\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.05.031\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.10.061\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094764\n10.5301/ijao.5000307\n10.1039/D0BM01247E\n10.1016/j.nano.2021.102367\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.060\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.03.046\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.01.046\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.10.021\n10.1126/science.aav9051\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316155\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.036\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.01.002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1038/s42003-020-0853-0\n10.1038/s41551-018-0271-5\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.024\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1111/cge.13027\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.190\n10.1016/j.hfc.2017.12.006\n10.1038/32675\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.12.030\n10.1126/science.aat5011\n10.1007/s11886-017-0830-5\n10.1038/nbt.2909\n10.1126/science.aad5227\n10.1038/nature16526\n10.1038/nature24268\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.002\n10.1038/ncb3411\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy249\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.05.007\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.10.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309283\n10.3389/fcell.2021.639699\n10.1126/sciadv.aap9004\n10.1152/ajpgi.00410.2016\n10.1038/nrd2423\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.03.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0213114\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab6d36\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.02.015\n10.1039/D0LC00921K\n10.1186/s13287-017-0749-1"}
{"title": "Atomic force microscopy indentation for nanomechanical characterization of live pathological cardiovascular/heart tissue and cells.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular/heart tissue and cells are subjected to dynamic forces from very early development, without pause, for the entire life of the animal or person and are characterized by being very sensitive to the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue. Most cardiovascular diseases are characterized by important modifications that occur at the level of extracellular matrix (ECM) components that correlate with an increase in tissue stiffness and contribute to impaired heart function. Additionally, several studies show that cardiovascular/heart cells themselves can undergo modifications in their morphology and mechanical properties in various biological processes as well as in different pathologies. This mini review illustrates how atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation can be used in combination with different experimental strategies to access the mechanical properties of cardiovascular/heart tissue and cells, which can help in understanding the different biological and pathological processes\u00a0in these types of tissues and cells in depth.", "journal": "Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)", "date": "2022-05-08", "authors": ["Juan CBenech", "GerardoRomanelli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micron.2022.103287"}
{"title": "Sars-Cov-2 Spike Protein-Induced Damage of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Sars-Cov-2 may trigger molecular and functional alterations of cardiomyocytes (CMs) of the heart due to the presence of receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the host cells. While the endocytic\u00a0itinerary of\u00a0the virus\u00a0via cleavage of the spike protein of Sars-Cov-2 is well understood, the role of the remaining part of the spike protein subunit and ACE2 complex is still elusive. Herein, the possible effects of this complex are investigated by using synthetic spike proteins of Sars-Cov-2, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC), and a culture device made of an arrayed monolayer of cross-linked nanofibers. hiPSCs are first differentiated into CMs that form cardiac tissue-like constructs with regular beating and expression of both ACE2 and gap junction protein Connexin 43. When incubated with the spike proteins, the hiPSC-CMs undergo a rhythmic fluctuation with overstretched sarcomere structures and dispersed gap junction proteins. When incubated with the spike proteins and supplementary angiotensin II, the damage of the spike protein on hiPSC-CMs is enhanced due to downregulated ACE2, chromatin margination, altered Connexin 43 expression, sarcomere disruption, and beating break. This discovery may imply latent effects of the spike proteins on the heart.", "journal": "Advanced biology", "date": "2022-05-07", "authors": ["XiaochenHuang", "BoxinHuang", "YongHe", "LiangFeng", "JianShi", "LiWang", "JuanPeng", "YongChen"], "doi": "10.1002/adbi.202101327"}
{"title": "Minimally invasive delivery of a hydrogel-based exosome patch to prevent heart failure.", "abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) has been the number one killer in the United States for decades and causes millions of deaths each year. Clinical treatment of heart ischemic injury relieves symptoms in the acute stage of CHD; however, patients with an infarcted heart muscle can develop heart failure (HF) due to chronic maladaptive remodeling. Regenerative therapy has been studied as a potential treatment option for myocardial infarction (MI) and HF. Cardiac patches have been designed and tested to increase therapeutic retention and integration. However, the delivery usually requires invasive surgical techniques, including open-chest surgeries and heart manipulation. Those procedures may cause chronic adhesions between the heart anterior wall and the chest wall. This study created and tested an injectable ExoGel by embedding mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) -derived exosomes into a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel. ExoGel was injected into the pericardial cavity of rats with transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced heart failure. ExoGel therapy reduced LV chamber size and preserved wall thickness. The feasibility and safety of ExoGel injection were further confirmed in a pig model.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2022-05-07", "authors": ["GeorgeCheng", "DashuaiZhu", "KeHuang", "Thomas GCaranasos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.04.020"}

Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, and total glutathione (GSH) level were measured in the heart tissue of the experimental rats. Histological examination was also performed to determine any damage to the hearts of the experimental rats.\nWhile TBARS levels in the cisplatin group increased significantly, SOD, CAT, GPx activities, and total GSH level decreased significantly. TBARS levels decreased significantly and SOD, CAT, GPx activities and GSH levels increased with DL treatment. According to the histological examination, histopathological differences were observed in the cisplatin group. Histopathological findings were either absent or decreased in the DL-treated group.\nResults of the study showed that DL therapy reduced oxidative stress and histological changes caused by cisplatin. DL could be a potential candidate for reducing cardiac damage caused by cisplatin.", "journal": "Turkish journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "date": "2022-05-06", "authors": ["Ne\u015feBa\u015fak T\u00fcrkmen", "DilanA\u015fk\u0131n \u00d6zek", "Asl\u0131Ta\u015fl\u0131dere", "Osman\u00c7ift\u00e7i", "\u00d6zlemSaral", "Cemile CerenG\u00fcl"], "doi": "10.4274/tjps.galenos.2021.84555"}
{"title": "Ameliorating effect of rutin against diclofenac-induced cardiac injury in rats with underlying function of FABP3, MYL3, and ANP.", "abstract": "Diclofenac is a widely prescribed anti-inflammatory drug having cardiovascular complications as one of the main liabilities that restrict its therapeutic use. We aimed to investigate for any role of rutin against diclofenac-induced cardiac injury with underlying mechanisms as there is no such precedent to date. The effect of rutin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) was evaluated upon concomitant oral administration for fifteen days with diclofenac (10\u2009mg/kg). Rutin significantly attenuated diclofenac-induced alterations in the serum cardiac markers (LDH, CK-MB, and SGOT), serum cytokine levels (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), and oxidative stress markers (MDA and GSH) in the cardiac tissue. Histopathological examination and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) findings displayed a marked effect of rutin to prevent diclofenac-mediated cardiac injury. Altered protein expression of myocardial injury markers (cTnT, FABP3, and ANP) and apoptotic markers (Bcl-2 and Caspase-3) in the cardiac tissue upon diclofenac treatment was considerably shielded by rutin treatment. MYL3 was unaffected due to diclofenac or rutin treatment. Rutin also significantly improved diclofenac-induced gastrointestinal and hepatic alterations based on the observed ameliorative effects in key mediators, oxidative stress markers, histopathology examination, and SEM findings. Overall results suggest that rutin can protect the diclofenac-induced cardiac injury by lowering oxidative stress, inhibiting inflammation, and reducing apoptosis.

{"title": "Post-translational modification patterns on \u03b2-myosin heavy chain are altered in ischemic and nonischemic human hearts.", "abstract": "Phosphorylation and acetylation of sarcomeric proteins are important for fine-tuning myocardial contractility. Here, we used bottom-up proteomics and label-free quantification to identify novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) on \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MHC) in normal and failing human heart tissues. We report six acetylated lysines and two phosphorylated residues: K34-Ac, K58-Ac, S210-P, K213-Ac, T215-P, K429-Ac, K951-Ac, and K1195-Ac. K951-Ac was significantly reduced in both ischemic and nonischemic failing hearts compared to nondiseased hearts. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that K951-Ac may impact stability of thick filament tail interactions and ultimately myosin head positioning. K58-Ac altered the solvent-exposed SH3 domain surface - known for protein-protein interactions - but did not appreciably change motor domain conformation or dynamics under conditions studied. Together, K213-Ac/T215-P altered loop 1's structure and dynamics - known to regulate ADP-release, ATPase activity, and sliding velocity. Our study suggests that \u03b2-MHC acetylation levels may be influenced more by the PTM location than the type of heart disease since less protected acetylation sites are reduced in both heart failure groups. Additionally, these PTMs have potential to modulate interactions between \u03b2-MHC and other regulatory sarcomeric proteins, ADP-release rate of myosin, flexibility of the S2 region, and cardiac myofilament contractility in normal and failing hearts.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2022-05-04", "authors": ["MaiconLandim-Vieira", "Matthew CChilders", "Amanda LWacker", "Michelle RodriquezGarcia", "HuanHe", "RakeshSingh", "Elizabeth ABrundage", "Jamie RJohnston", "Bryan AWhitson", "P BryantChase", "Paul M LJanssen", "MichaelRegnier", "Brandon JBiesiadecki", "J RenatoPinto", "Michelle SParvatiyar"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.74919\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.01.012\n10.1016/j.jsb.2007.04.002\n10.1093/nar/28.1.235\n10.1073/pnas.0606741103\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.161687\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.183897\n10.1016/j.sbi.2006.03.006\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.008\n10.1007/s10974-011-9251-z\n10.1152/ajpheart.00149.2014\n10.1063/1.470117\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.68.1.687\n10.1152/physrev.2000.80.2.853\n10.1074/jbc.M710277200\n10.1063/1.5139708\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.033200\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aao0144\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00113\n10.1056/NEJM200012073432304\n10.1016/j.bpj.2017.02.045\n10.1002/prot.24964\n10.1007/s12551-012-0081-z\n10.1007/s10974-011-9280-7\n10.1021/ct400751u\n10.1021/jp505875v\n10.1021/ct500918t\n10.1186/gm424\n10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.080\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btq054\n10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255\n10.1073/pnas.75.8.3588\n10.1002/jcc.10262\n10.1080/14789450.2018.1483340\n10.1007/s00424-007-0394-0\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.03.004\n10.1016/j.abb.2012.10.005\n10.1021/ct600085e\n10.1021/bi972903j\n10.1002/jcc.20084\n10.1016/0022-2828(73)90016-3\n10.1021/ct400341p\n10.1073/pnas.0607069103\n10.1074/jbc.M115.653048\n10.1172/JCI30804\n10.1021/pr201240a\n10.1074/jbc.R110.197731\n10.1074/jbc.R110.175489\n10.1074/jbc.273.11.6262\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00659\n10.1073/pnas.1505813112\n10.1016/j.ceb.2012.10.009\n10.1002/bies.201600062\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehi193\n10.1002/cphy.c170023\n10.1002/cpps.20\n10.1007/s12471-014-0590-4\n10.1074/jbc.M703670200\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.318601\n10.1161/01.res.0000021115.24712.99\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.12.005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.09.007\n10.1002/pmic.200900398"}

Hence, the cardioprotective effect of octreotide in MI was scrutinized by tackling the possible underlying trajectories involved. Isoproterenol (ISO)-induced acute MI model was adopted using ISO (85\u00a0mg/kg/day, S.C.) for 2 days. Rats in octreotide groups were pretreated with 20 or 40\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day S.C. for 8 days and ISO was given on the 7th and 8th days. Octreotide showed a restoration of ECG changes, cardiac hemodynamics abnormalities, serum cardiac markers elevation (creatine kinase MB, troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase), and cardiac histoarchitecture abnormalities. In addition, octreotide pretreatment showed a significant increase in the cardiac and serum level of the diagnostic microRNA-133a. Octreotide attenuates oxidative stress indices (MDA, GSH, SOD, TAC, and HIF-1\u03b1), besides a better adjustment of NOX-1/-2/-4 expression and protein levels. Mitochondrial morphology and mtDNA copy number were preserved following the pre-treatment of Octreotide. The inflammatory pathway p38 MAPK/Erk-1/-2/p-STAT3/NF-\u03baB pathway and the proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- \u03b1, IL-6, and IL- 1\u03b2) were attenuated. The proapoptotic markers (cyt c, caspase-3/-9, and Bax) were also attenuated and the antiapoptotic Bcl2 marker was increased by the preadministration of octreotide. In almost all parameters, Octreotide 40\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day was more prominent than its lower dose.

These myomiRs are known to play regulatory roles in muscle health in general, both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. In this review, we have focused on the significance of a myomiR termed miR-133a in cardiovascular health. The available literature supports the claim that miR-133a could be helpful in the healing process of muscle tissue after injury. The protective function could be due to its regulatory effect on muscle or stem cell mitochondrial function. In this review, we have shed light on the protective mechanisms offered by miR-133a. Most of the beneficial effects are due to the presence of miR-133a in circulation or tissue-specific expression. We have also reviewed the potential mechanisms by which miR-133a could interact with cell surface receptors and also transcriptional mechanisms by which they offer cardioprotection and regeneration.

Ferroptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, has been reported to be present in the heart tissue of patients with sepsis, which demonstrated that ferroptosis may be a potential mechanism of myocardial injury in SCM. Therefore, we explored the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in SCM and aimed to identify pivotal ferroptosis-related targets in SCM and potential therapeutic targets involved in the pathological process of SCM. To explore the regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in SCM, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SCM and FRGs by bioinformatics analysis, and further identified hub genes. And the crucial microRNAs (miRNAs)-FRGs regulatory network was subsequently constructed. Finally, several candidate drugs associated with the hub genes were predicted, and Real-time quantitative reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis were performed to confirm the abnormal expression of hub genes.

Echocardiography, electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blotting were used to determine the cardiac function and expression of inflammation- and autophagy-related proteins at both the mRNA and protein levels.\nLPS caused cardiac dysfunction in rats or injury in H9c2 cells and induced inflammation and autophagy. Compared with LPS treatment, AS-IV treatment attenuated cardiac dysfunction or cell injury, accompanied by inhibition of inflammation and autophagy. However, the miR-1 mimics partly abolished the effects of AS-IV. In addition, the effect of the miR-1 inhibitor was similar to that of AS-IV in the LPS model. Further analyses showed that AS-IV treatment decreased the mRNA expression of miR-1 in the heart tissue of rats and H9c2 cells treated with LPS.\nThese results suggest that AS-IV attenuated cardiac dysfunction caused by LPS by inhibiting miR-1-mediated inflammation and autophagy, thereby providing a novel mechanism for the protection against cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Journal of inflammation research", "date": "2022-05-03", "authors": ["QiuningWang", "WeiyingChen", "XuefengYang", "YingSong", "XiaoweiSun", "GuizhouTao", "HongWang", "NanZhao", "YueHuang", "ErqingChai", "FutianTang"], "doi": "10.2147/JIR.S362368\n10.1248/bpb.34.1404\n10.3736/jcim20080519\n10.3892/etm.2021.10631\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2020.118853\n10.3389/fcell.2021.671255\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.07.029\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003199\n10.12659/MSM.916030\n10.1016/S1875-5364(15)60016-4\n10.3109/08923973.2015.1080266\n10.22038/ijbms.2019.37748.8977\n10.2147/JIR.S312167\n10.3389/fphar.2021.669782\n10.1080/21691401.2019.1687492\n10.1161/01.RES.0000257913.42552.23\n10.1155/2018/6082387\n10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00809-6\n10.1038/nm1569\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.02.097\n10.5603/KP.2018.0117\n10.1016/j.etap.2015.09.007\n10.1002/ptr.5989\n10.1016/j.jep.2013.10.017\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01163\n10.1002/ptr.5297\n10.1055/s-0033-1360129\n10.1111/bph.14959\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.03.015\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119414\n10.1080/13880209.2019.1569697\n10.1038/s41598-017-02360-5\n10.1159/000121335\n10.1042/BSR20171036\n10.1538/expanim.19-0037\n10.1186/1749-8546-4-6\n10.1536/ihj.50.377"}

{"title": "Zebrafish heart regeneration after coronary dysfunction-induced cardiac damage.", "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, various zebrafish injury models demonstrated efficient heart regeneration after cardiac tissue loss. However, no established coronary vessel injury methods exist in the zebrafish model, despite coronary endothelial dysfunction occurring in most patients with acute coronary syndrome. This is due to difficulties performing surgery on small coronary vessels and a lack of genetic tools to precisely manipulate coronary cells in zebrafish. We determined that the Notch ligand gene deltaC regulatory sequences drive gene expression in zebrafish coronary endothelial cells, enabling us to overcome these obstacles. We created a deltaC fluorescent reporter line and visualized robust coronary growth during heart development and regeneration. Importantly, this reporter facilitated the visualization of coronary growth without an endocardial background. Moreover, we visualized robust coronary growth on the surface of juvenile hearts and regrowth in the wounded area of adult hearts ex vivo. With this approach, we observed growth inhibition by reported vascular growth antagonists of the VEGF, EGF and Notch signaling pathways. Furthermore, we established a coronary genetic ablation system and observed that severe coronary endothelial cell loss resulted in fish death, whereas fish survived mild coronary cell loss. Coronary cell depletion triggered regenerative responses, which resulted in the restoration of damaged cardiac tissues within several weeks. Overall, our work demonstrated the efficacy of using deltaC regulatory elements for high-resolution visualization of the coronary endothelium; screening small molecules for coronary growth effects; and revealed complete recovery in adult zebrafish after coronary-induced heart damage.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2022-05-02", "authors": ["JishengSun", "Elizabeth APeterson", "ChengJiao", "XinChen", "YunZhao", "JinhuWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2022.04.008"}

The prognosis of patients with CTEPH is poor if untreated; however, in expert centers with multidisciplinary teams, a treatment strategy for CTEPH has been established, dramatically improving its prognosis. CTEPH is currently not a fatal disease and is the only curable form of PH. Despite these advances and the establishment of treatment approaches, early diagnosis is still challenging, especially for non-experts, for several reasons. One of the reasons for this is insufficient knowledge of the various diagnostic imaging modalities, which are essential in the clinical practice of CTEPH. Imaging modalities should detect the following pathological findings: lung perfusion defects, thromboembolic lesions in pulmonary arteries, and right ventricular remodeling and dysfunction. Perfusion lung scintigraphy and catheter angiography have long been considered gold standards for the detection of perfusion defects and assessment of vascular lesions, respectively. However, advances in imaging technology of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have enabled the non-invasive detection of these abnormal findings in a single examination. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for evaluating the morphology and function of the right heart; however, state-of-the-art techniques in CMR allow the assessment of cardiac tissue characterization and hemodynamics in the pulmonary arteries. Comprehensive knowledge of the role of imaging in CTEPH enables appropriate use of imaging modalities and accurate image interpretation, resulting in early diagnosis, determination of treatment strategies, and appropriate evaluation of treatment efficacy.

The TRPC6 ion channel is a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. A deeper understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological role as well as the localization of TRPC6 in human cardiac tissue is the basis for new drug development. Although the TRPC6 channel has been detected in animal studies, at the mRNA level in humans, and sparse TRPC6 protein has been detected in humans, there are no systematic studies of TRPC6 protein detection in the human heart. For the first time, TRPC6 ion channel protein was detected histologically in human heart tissue from body donors in different structures, localizations, and histological layers - particularly in cardiomyocytes and intramuscular arterioles - by immunohistochemistry, just as TRPC6 expression has already been shown in animal models of the heart by other research groups.

{"title": "Integrated insights into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced myocardial depression using a quantitative global proteomic analysis.", "abstract": "Sepsis-induced myocardial depression is common among patients in the intensive care unit; however, the exact mechanisms underlying this condition remain unclear. We investigated differences in the expression of specific proteins and determined the potential functions of the proteins in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Left ventricular tissue was excised from 16 rats (sepsis group, 8; control group, 8) and analysed. Quantitative analysis of the global proteome was performed using 4D label-free technique. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted based on differentially expressed (DE) proteins. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) validation for selected proteins and western blotting for selected global protein modifications in heart tissues were also performed. As a result, out of 3653 proteins identified, 108 were expressed differentially between the two groups. The bioinformatic analyses revealed that DE proteins play important roles in metabolism- and immune-related pathways. PRM results supported the plausibility and reliability of the proteomics data. Modification of heart tissue acetyllysine, succinyllysine, 2-hydroxyisobutyryllysine, and lactyllysine revealed clear differences between the two groups, indicating the effects of protein modification. Our study suggested that expression patterns of global proteins in heart tissue were different between the two groups. These results provide new valuable information on the possible mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced myocardial depression. SIGNIFICANCE: The expression patterns of global proteins in the heart tissues of patients with sepsis and control groups remain unknown. In this study, we used the 4D label-free proteomics technique to compare differentially expressed (DE) proteins between the sepsis and control groups. We identified 3653 proteins, 108 of which were expressed differentially between the sepsis and control groups. Further bioinformatic analyses revealed that DE proteins play critical roles in metabolism- and immune-related processes and pathways. Interestingly, modification of heart tissue acetyllysine, succinyllysine, 2-hydroxyisobutyryllysine, and lactyllysine revealed clear differences between the sepsis and control groups.

Here we show that suitable combinations of mechanical stimuli and metabolic cues can enhance the maturation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and that the maturation-inducing cues have phenotype-dependent effects on the cells' action-potential morphology and calcium handling. By using microfluidic chips that enhanced the alignment and extracellular-matrix production of cardiac microtissues derived from genetically distinct sources of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, we identified fatty-acid-enriched maturation media that improved the cells' mitochondrial structure and calcium handling, and observed divergent cell-source-dependent effects on action-potential duration (APD). Specifically, in the presence of maturation media, tissues with abnormally prolonged APDs exhibited shorter APDs, and tissues with aberrantly short APDs displayed prolonged APDs. Regardless of cell source, tissue maturation reduced variabilities in spontaneous beat rate and in APD, and led to converging cell phenotypes (with APDs within the 300-450\u2009ms range characteristic of human left ventricular cardiomyocytes) that improved the modelling of the effects of pro-arrhythmic drugs on cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Nature biomedical engineering", "date": "2022-04-29", "authors": ["NathanielHuebsch", "BereniceCharrez", "GabrielNeiman", "BrianSiemons", "Steven CBoggess", "SamuelWall", "VerenaCharwat", "Karoline HJ\u00e6ger", "DavidCleres", "\u00c5shildTelle", "Felipe TLee-Montiel", "Nicholas CJeffreys", "NikhilDeveshwar", "Andrew GEdwards", "JonathanSerrano", "MatijaSnuderl", "AndreasStahl", "AslakTveito", "Evan WMiller", "Kevin EHealy"], "doi": "10.1038/s41551-022-00884-4\n10.1038/nrd3681\n10.1111/bph.13282\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005914\n10.1073/pnas.1424042112\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2016.0535\n10.1038/s41598-017-05600-w\n10.1152/ajpheart.00694.2011\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.06.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001883\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1038/srep24726\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.04.011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.055\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.251843\n10.1161/hh0202.103644\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.3389/fphar.2021.684252\n10.1111/cts.13038\n10.3389/fphar.2020.569489\n10.1038/s41598-018-35858-7\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1002/stem.2036\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.10.009\n10.1155/2017/7648409\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0027\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.04.005\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e74a14\n10.1038/s41598-017-08713-4\n10.1093/toxsci/kfs233\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.006\n10.1089/ten.tec.2014.0283\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003552\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098640\n10.1002/jbm.10154\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.037357\n10.1016/j.scr.2015.12.002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.001560\n10.1038/nm.3545\n10.3109/08820139509066849\n10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.027\n10.1172/JCI27167\n10.1371/journal.pone.0042658\n10.1039/c5cc01538c\n10.1093/cvr/cvr259\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.09.025\n10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.029\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2014.03.015\n10.1038/s41551-018-0280-4\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.07.003\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.02.015\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00714\n10.1042/bj3610277\n10.1074/jbc.M606869200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0101316\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.10.024\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.93\n10.1152/physrev.00057.2009\n10.7554/eLife.36717\n10.1113/jphysiol.2011.223313\n10.1063/1.5087629\n10.3389/fphar.2019.01648\n10.1101/2020.06.24.168690\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310230\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311920\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00846-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000570\n10.1093/europace/euq382\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.06.021\n10.1038/nm.1942\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.10.005\n10.1124/jpet.107.128405\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.979815\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.09.005\n10.1038/s41598-017-15799-3\n10.1083/jcb.201004104\n10.1152/ajpheart.00404.2012\n10.1046/j.1542-474X.2003.08413.x\n10.1021/jacs.5b06644\n10.1016/j.vascn.2017.11.002"}

{"title": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy was attenuated by cinnamon treatment through the inhibition of fibro-inflammatory response and ventricular hypertrophy in diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a chronic complication of diabetes that emphasizes the urgency of developing new drug therapies. With an illustrious history in traditional medicine to improve diabetes, cinnamon has been shown to possess blood lipids lowering effects and antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the extent to which it protects the diabetic heart has yet to be determined. Forty-eight rats were administered in the study and grouped as: control; diabetic; diabetic rats given 100, 200, or 400\u2009mg/kg cinnamon extract, metformin (300\u2009mg/kg), valsartan (30\u2009mg/kg), or met/val (combination of both drugs), via gavage for six weeks. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) and markers of cardiac injury including creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were evaluated in blood samples. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, the total contents of thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured. Histopathology study and gene expression measurement of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), beta-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MHC), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were done on cardiac tissue. FBS and cardiac enzyme indicators were reduced in all treated groups. A reduction in MDA level and enhancement in thiol content alongside with increase of SOD and CAT activities were observed in extract groups. The decrease of inflammation and fibrosis was obvious in treated groups, notably in the high-dose extract group. Furthermore, all treated diabetic groups showed a lowering trend in AT1, ANP, \u03b2-MHC, and BNP gene expression. Cinnamon extract, in addition to its hypoglycemic and antioxidant properties, can prevent diabetic heart damage by alleviating cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study found that cinnamon extract might protect diabetic heart damage by reducing inflammation and fibrosis in cardiac tissue, in addition to lowering blood glucose levels and increasing antioxidant activity. Our data imply that including cinnamon in diabetic participants' diets may help to reduce risk factors of cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Journal of food biochemistry", "date": "2022-04-28", "authors": ["MaryamFarazandeh", "MaryamMahmoudabady", "Ali AkbarAsghari", "SaeedNiazmand"], "doi": "10.1111/jfbc.14206"}
{"title": "Recent Development of Conductive Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering: Review and Perspective.", "abstract": "In recent years, tissue engineering techniques have been rapidly developed and offer a new therapeutic approach to organ or tissue damage repair. However, most of tissue engineering scaffolds are nonconductive and cannot establish effective electrical coupling with tissue for the electroactive tissues. Electroconductive hydrogels (ECHs) have received increasing attention in tissue engineering owing to their electroconductivity, biocompatibility, and high water content. In vitro, ECHs can not only promote the communication of electrical signals between cells, but also mediate the adhesion, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of different kinds of cells. In vivo, ECHs can transmit the electric signal to electroactive tissues and activate bioelectrical signaling pathways to promote tissue repair. As a result, implanting ECHs into damaged tissues can effectively reconstruct physiological functions related to electrical conduction. In this review, an overview about the classifications and the fabrication methods of ECHs is first presented. And then, the applications of ECHs in tissue engineering, including cardiac, nerve, skin, and skeletal muscle tissue, are highlighted. At last, some rational guidelines for designing ECHs toward clinical applications are provided.", "journal": "Macromolecular bioscience", "date": "2022-04-27", "authors": ["ChenGao", "ShaoshuaiSong", "YinjuanLv", "JieHuang", "ZhijunZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/mabi.202200051"}
{"title": "Asporin, an extracellular matrix protein, is a beneficial regulator of cardiac remodeling.", "abstract": "Heart failure is accompanied by adverse cardiac remodeling involving extracellular matrix (ECM). Cardiac ECM acts as a major reservoir for many proteins including growth factors, cytokines, collagens, and proteoglycans. Activated fibroblasts during cardiac injury can alter the composition and activity of these ECM proteins. Through unbiased analysis of a microarray dataset of human heart tissue comparing normal hearts (n\u00a0=\u00a0135) to hearts with ischemic cardiomyopathy (n\u00a0=\u00a094), we identified Asporin (ASPN) as the top differentially regulated gene (DEG) in ischemic cardiomyopathy; its gene-ontology terms relate closely to fibrosis and cell death. ASPN is a Class I small leucine repeat protein member implicated in cancer, osteoarthritis, and periodontal ligament mineralization. However, its role in cardiac remodeling is still unknown. Here, we initially confirmed our big dataset analysis through cells, mice, and clinical atrial biopsy samples to demonstrate increased Aspn expression after pressure overload or cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury. We tested the hypothesis that Aspn, being a TGF\u03b21 inhibitor, can attenuate fibrosis in mouse models of cardiac injury. We found that Aspn is released by cardiac fibroblasts and attenuates TGF\u03b2 signaling.

Hence, it is obligatory to develop a new treatment for MI having lesser side effects. Cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and inflammatory pathways play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of MI. This investigation established the anti-cardiac hypertrophic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and myocardial infarct size limiting effects of valencene. Rats were induced MI by isoproterenol (100\u00a0mg/kg body weight) and then treated with valencene and cardiac sensitive markers, cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, markers of inflammation, nuclear factor- \u03baB inflammatory pathway, and myocardial infarct size was estimated/determined. The serum cardiac diagnostic markers, cardiac hypertrophy, conjugated dienes, markers of inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and myocardial infarct size were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased by isoproterenol. Further, antioxidant enzymes and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decreased in the heart. The 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride dye staining revealed a larger infarct size. Moreover, histological results of myocardial infarcted rat's cardiac tissue revealed separation of cardiac muscle fibers, necrosis, and inflammatory cells. Post-treatment with valencene (12\u00a0mg/kg body weight) orally, daily, for two weeks to isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats reversed all above said structural, biochemical, molecular, and histological parameters investigated, by its anti-cardiac hypertrophic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and myocardial infarct size limiting effects. Thus, valencene is a potential candidate for inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, nuclear factor- \u03baB inflammatory pathway, and myocardial infarct size and exhibited cardioprotection in MI.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2022-04-27", "authors": ["SShervin Prince", "PStanely Mainzen Prince", "V MBerlin Grace"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.174975"}

A better understanding of endothelial pathways involved in vasodilation in human arterioles may provide new insight into the mechanisms of CMD. The goal of this study is to investigate the role of TRPV4, NOX4, and their interaction in human arterioles and examine the underlying mechanisms. Arterioles were freshly isolated from adipose and heart tissues obtained from 71 patients without coronary artery disease, and vascular reactivity was studied by videomicroscopy. In human adipose arterioles (HAA), ACh-induced dilation was significantly reduced by TRPV4 inhibitor HC067047 and by NOX 1/4 inhibitor GKT137831, but GKT137831 did not further affect the dilation in the presence of TRPV4 inhibitors. GKT137831 also inhibited TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A-induced dilation in HAA and human coronary arterioles (HCA). NOX4 transcripts and proteins were detected in endothelial cells of HAA and HCA.

{"title": "Monitoring of inflammation using novel biosensor mouse model reveals tissue- and sex-specific responses to Western diet.", "abstract": "Obesity is an epidemic, and it is characterized by a state of low-grade systemic inflammation. A key component of inflammation is the activation of inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes that form in response to danger signals and that lead to activation of caspase-1. Previous studies have found that a Westernized diet induces activation of inflammasomes and production of inflammatory cytokines. Gut microbiota metabolites, including the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, have received increased attention as underlying some obesogenic features, but the mechanisms of action by which butyrate influences inflammation in obesity remain unclear. We engineered a caspase-1 reporter mouse model to measure spatiotemporal dynamics of inflammation in obese mice. Concurrent with increased capsase-1 activation in vivo, we detected stronger biosensor signal in white adipose and heart tissues of obese mice ex vivo and observed that a short-term butyrate treatment affected some, but not all, of the inflammatory responses induced by Western diet. Through characterization of inflammatory responses and computational analyses, we identified tissue- and sex-specific caspase-1 activation patterns and inflammatory phenotypes in obese mice, offering new mechanistic insights underlying the dynamics of inflammation.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2022-04-26", "authors": ["SarahTalley", "RaizaBonomo", "ChaitanyaGavini", "JomanaHatahet", "EmilyGornick", "TylerCook", "Byeong JaeChun", "PeteKekenes-Huskey", "GregoryAubert", "EdwardCampbell", "VirginieMansuy-Aubert"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.049313\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00094\n10.1038/nature12726\n10.1073/pnas.0407076101\n10.1097/MCG.0000000000000363\n10.1152/ajpheart.00346.2019\n10.1073/pnas.2006065117\n10.1084/jem.20172222\n10.1053/j.gastro.2016.12.048\n10.1073/pnas.1322269111\n10.1038/s41577-019-0156-1\n10.3390/molecules26030682\n10.1038/s41575-019-0157-3\n10.3945/an.116.012914\n10.2337/db14-1213\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7519-8_13\n10.1186/s12889-018-5879-6\n10.1242/dmm.048909\n10.1136/gutjnl-2017-315543\n10.2337/db08-1637\n10.1093/jn/131.6.1839\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.09.046\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000111245.75752.C6\n10.3390/ijms21176356\n10.1007/s00125-016-4192-0\n10.1038/nature05485\n10.1016/j.immuni.2017.08.009\n10.1038/nature21363\n10.1038/srep24838\n10.1093/nar/28.1.27\n10.1016/j.mce.2021.111337\n10.1152/physrev.00041.2018\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.041\n10.1016/j.jfma.2013.05.013\n10.1136/gutjnl-2017-314050\n10.1093/nar/gkz949\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035240\n10.7554/eLife.06667\n10.1038/s41591-021-01399-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.312321\n10.1053/j.gastro.2014.02.008\n10.1016/S1474-4422(17)30084-4\n10.1038/s41423-021-00670-3\n10.1016/j.mce.2014.11.029\n10.1038/nm.4422\n10.3389/fnut.2021.625331\n10.1016/j.immuni.2018.12.018\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00240-9\n10.1093/nar/gky1131\n10.4049/jimmunol.1900619\n10.1186/s12974-021-02317-6\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102649\n10.3233/NHA-160005\n10.1038/srep12676\n10.1073/pnas.0402851101\n10.1038/s41401-019-0330-9\n10.3382/ps/pez279"}

Oxysterols (endogenous oxidized cholesterol derivatives) are the most potent endogenous LXR\u03b1-agonist. LXR\u03b1 has a direct impact on several members of drug transporter superfamilies; ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute linked carrier (SLC).\nThe current study aimed to investigate the effect of LXR\u03b1-activation by either endogenous oxysterols or a synthetic LXR\u03b1-agonist (LXRa) such as TO901317 on hepatic and cardiac gene expression of ABCC10 and SLC17A5 drug transporters in an experimentally hypercholesterolemic rat model.\n48 male rats were divided randomly into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a012); control group rats received vehicle; hypercholesterolemic group (HCH group) rats received diet contain 2.5% cholesterol &deoxycholic acid for 8 weeks; (LXRa group) rats were fed standard pellet chow for 8 weeks, then a single dose of LXRa was administered (IP) at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg; (HCH\u00a0+\u00a0LXRa group) rats received diet contain 2.5% cholesterol &deoxycholic acid for 8 weeks, then a single dose of LXRa was administered (IP) at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg.\nOur findings revealed that hypercholesterolemia and LXRa significantly activated LXR\u03b1 to varying degrees in both hepatic and cardiac tissues with subsequent alteration of LXR\u03b1 and ABCC10 gene expression. Whereas, SLC17A5 gene expression was primarily affected by elevated serum cholesterol level and unmediated via LXR\u03b1-activation.\nAccordingly, it was concluded that ABCC10 is a specific LXR\u03b1-target gene and that LXR\u03b1 autoregulates its own expression in rats.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2022-04-25", "authors": ["Nahla EEl-Ashmawy", "Naglaa FKhedr", "MohamedSallam", "Ahmed IbrahimNossier"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.04.046"}

{"title": "The Structural and the Functional Aspects of Intercellular Communication in iPSC-Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Recent advances in the technology of producing novel cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-cardiomyocytes) fuel new hope for future clinical applications. The use of iPSC-cardiomyocytes is particularly promising for the therapy of cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction, where these cells could replace scar tissue and restore the functionality of the heart. Despite successful cardiogenic differentiation, medical applications of iPSC-cardiomyocytes are currently limited by their pronounced immature structural and functional phenotype. This review focuses on gap junction function in iPSC-cardiomyocytes and portrays our current understanding around the structural and the functional limitations of intercellular coupling and viable cardiac graft formation involving these novel cardiac muscle cells. We further highlight the role of the gap junction protein connexin 43 as a potential target for improving cell-cell communication and electrical signal propagation across cardiac tissue engineered from iPSC-cardiomyocytes. Better insight into the mechanisms that promote functional intercellular coupling is the foundation that will allow the development of novel strategies to combat the immaturity of iPSC-cardiomyocytes and pave the way toward cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-04-24", "authors": ["EvaKiss", "CarolinFischer", "Jan-MischaSauter", "JinmengSun", "Nina DUllrich"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23084460\n10.1089/scd.2011.0075\n10.1016/1050-1738(92)90004-C\n10.1063/5.0050192\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1999.tb00230.x\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.035\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.154252\n10.1083/jcb.201312110\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094722\n10.1038/35019186\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00031.x\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1172/JCI200112131\n10.2174/1573403X13666170502103833\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.08.008\n10.1038/292154a0\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.014\n10.1038/35070587\n10.1016/S1525-0016(16)34271-X\n10.1161/01.RES.0000147315.71699.51\n10.1038/clpt.2011.175\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227512\n10.1016/J.LFS.2015.12.023\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1007/s12265-010-9235-1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305365\n10.1002/jcb.22164\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.256149\n10.1007/s12015-016-9680-6\n10.1007/s40472-018-0177-x\n10.1038/nature10135\n10.1038/nature11807\n10.1038/s41467-017-00926-5\n10.1186/s41232-020-00125-8\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2019.03.099\n10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0116281\n10.1155/2017/9404057\n10.1126/science.1230719\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109837\n10.1089/ten.teb.2020.0198\n10.3389/fnins.2017.00252\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00308-4\n10.1111/pace.13856\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000014763.63528.9D\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000014771.38666.22\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300556\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.002\n10.1186/s13287-020-01602-0\n10.1097/TP.0000000000002384\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1097/TP.0000000000002765\n10.1093/cvr/cvab115\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121351\n10.1007/s00246-019-02165-5\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.774389\n10.1002/stem.2009\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.05.010\n10.1093/cvr/cvw259\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.03.011\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1994.tb01185.x\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2007.04.001\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.09.012\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.013\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.09.013\n10.1083/jcb.108.6.2241\n10.1073/pnas.91.14.6453\n10.1161/01.RES.87.5.346\n10.1006/jmcc.1999.0937\n10.1161/01.RES.68.6.1638\n10.1002/jemt.1070310511\n10.1242/jcs.114.4.763\n10.1126/science.1068793\n10.1161/01.RES.83.6.629\n10.1083/jcb.90.2.521\n10.1042/bj2730067\n10.1016/0092-8674(93)90728-9\n10.1074/jbc.M111498200\n10.1042/BJ20051922\n10.3109/15419061.2013.876014\n10.3390/ijms19051428\n10.1017/S0033583501003705\n10.1083/jcb.33.3.C7\n10.1016/0040-8166(85)90001-1\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.10.046\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.11.018\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.008\n10.1016/j.tcm.2020.07.006\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000645\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01417.x\n10.4081/ejh.2017.2763\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119551\n10.3389/fcell.2015.00058\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.10.008\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.09.006\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.06.005\n10.1038/nature06321\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.3791/55373\n10.1016/j.vascn.2020.106886\n10.1161/01.RES.85.11.1046\n10.1093/cvr/cvn133\n10.1093/cvr/cvu195\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.11.025\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.11.008\n10.1016/S0165-6147(98)01192-4\n10.1186/1471-213X-11-34\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00903"}
{"title": "A New Hypothetical Concept in Metabolic Understanding of Cardiac Fibrosis: Glycolysis Combined with TGF-\u03b2 and KLF5 Signaling.", "abstract": "The accumulation of fibrosis in cardiac tissues is one of the leading causes of heart failure. The principal cellular effectors in cardiac fibrosis are activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, which serve as the primary source of matrix proteins. TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways play a prominent role in cardiac fibrosis. The control of TGF-\u03b2 by KLF5 in cardiac fibrosis has been demonstrated for modulating cardiovascular remodeling. Since the expression of KLF5 is reduced, the accumulation of fibrosis diminishes. Because the molecular mechanism of fibrosis is still being explored, there are currently few options for effectively reducing or reversing it. Studying metabolic alterations is considered an essential process that supports the explanation of fibrosis in a variety of organs and especially the glycolysis alteration in the heart. However, the interplay among the main factors involved in fibrosis pathogenesis, namely TGF-\u03b2, KLF5, and the metabolic process in glycolysis, is still indistinct. In this review, we explain what we know about cardiac fibroblasts and how they could help with heart repair. Moreover, we hypothesize and summarize the knowledge trend on the molecular mechanism of TGF-\u03b2, KLF5, the role of the glycolysis pathway in fibrosis, and present the future therapy of cardiac fibrosis. These studies may target therapies that could become important strategies for fibrosis reduction in the future.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-04-24", "authors": ["ThanachaiMethatham", "RyozoNagai", "KenichiAizawa"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23084302\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1111/febs.15146\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.1172/JCI31044\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316958\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.231910\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.588347\n10.1172/JCI40295\n10.1038/s41598-021-94169-6\n10.1038/s41573-019-0040-5\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021119-034527\n10.1002/jcp.22322\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.031\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.09.002\n10.1016/j.mam.2018.07.001\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.02.006\n10.7150/ijbs.28103\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306565\n10.1152/physiol.00024.2013\n10.1253/circj.CJ-16-1003\n10.1172/JCI121079\n10.1172/JCI98215\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00301\n10.1007/s10741-009-9143-0\n10.1186/1755-1536-5-15\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.311148\n10.1093/cvr/28.9.1342\n10.1172/JCI74783\n10.1038/ncomms12260\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.201400\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182116e39\n10.1017/S1431927605050518\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.02.009\n10.1242/dev.079970\n10.12659/MSM.906038\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1152/ajpheart.00395.2013\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00416\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63330-5\n10.1083/jcb.201505007\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.12.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.235531\n10.1007/s00109-015-1314-y\n10.1007/s10741-018-9720-1\n10.1002/dvdy.20095\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1093/cvr/cvq067\n10.1007/s00441-016-2439-1\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.10.005\n10.1074/jbc.M803997200\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.10.036\n10.21037/jtd.2017.03.122\n10.1089/scd.2012.0542\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308643\n10.1007/s00018-011-0784-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.08.016\n10.1093/cvr/cvv041\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.05.002\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.005\n10.1038/303701a0\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.03.040\n10.1038/ncb1355\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303794\n10.1371/journal.pone.0162636\n10.1016/0735-1097(92)90130-F\n10.1038/s41419-018-1057-0\n10.1152/ajprenal.00422.2018\n10.1038/s41374-020-0404-9\n10.4061/2011/535241\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2003.12.006\n10.3892/ijmm.2020.4842\n10.1161/01.RES.69.2.483\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.216101\n10.1083/jcb.122.1.103\n10.1084/jem.20161791\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.006\n10.18632/oncotarget.6967\n10.1152/ajprenal.00365.2015\n10.1097/00041552-199407000-00011\n10.1016/S1579-2129(06)60550-8\n10.1253/circj.CJ-14-0511\n10.1006/jmcc.1999.1065\n10.1006/mgme.2000.3032\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307878\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63154-9\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001963\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.02.049\n10.3109/08977194.2011.595714\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000020689.12472.E0\n10.1172/JCI94753\n10.1038/s41569-020-00504-1\n10.1038/nature02006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314438\n10.1007/s00018-019-03398-6\n10.1164/rccm.201504-0780OC\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00156\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000514\n10.1164/rccm.201201-0084OC\n10.1074/jbc.M116.756247\n10.1111/jcmm.16013\n10.1152/ajprenal.00513.2018\n10.1152/ajpheart.91493.2007\n10.1152/ajpheart.00340.2004\n10.1016/j.metabol.2004.01.006\n10.1038/ncomms6797\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.08.007\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.10.002\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.01.021\n10.1159/000073043\n10.1074/jbc.M306621200\n10.1152/physrev.2001.81.3.999\n10.1038/nm738\n10.1038/nrneph.2016.48\n10.1101/cshperspect.a022210\n10.1074/jbc.C000870200\n10.1096/fj.201901087RR\n10.1172/JCI57582\n10.1007/s10620-007-0112-y\n10.1139/cjpp-2018-0430\n10.1093/cvr/cvv155\n10.1152/ajplung.00189.2015\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0525\n10.3892/ijo.2014.2544\n10.3389/fphar.2017.00326\n10.1016/j.tips.2012.01.005\n10.1073/pnas.1202081109\n10.1093/cvr/cvs014\n10.1038/nature05602\n10.1093/cvr/cvr038\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047420\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316738\n10.1038/s42255-018-0008-5\n10.3389/fcell.2018.00138\n10.1152/ajprenal.00036.2017\n10.1038/s42255-020-0172-2\n10.1681/ASN.V102342\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.701745\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.055\n10.1007/s00109-009-0524-6\n10.1007/s00109-012-0982-0\n10.2174/1874192402115010006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.268128\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.000228\n10.1002/jcp.25998\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.122\n10.1152/ajpheart.00140.2013\n10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00292-0\n10.1016/j.molmed.2015.12.006\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.01.011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00137.2015\n10.7150/ijms.11579"}
{"title": "CVD and COVID-19: Emerging Roles of Cardiac Fibroblasts and Myofibroblasts.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Current data suggest that patients with cardiovascular diseases experience more serious complications with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) than those without CVD. In addition, severe COVID-19 appears to cause acute cardiac injury, as well as long-term adverse remodeling of heart tissue. Cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, being crucial in response to injury, may play a pivotal role in both contributing to and healing COVID-19-induced cardiac injury. The role of cardiac myofibroblasts in cardiac fibrosis has been well-established in the literature for decades. However, with the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, new cardiac complications are arising. Bursts of inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of TGF-\u03b21 and angiotensin (AngII) are common in severe COVID-19 patients. Cytokines, TGF-\u03b21, and Ang II can induce cardiac fibroblast differentiation, potentially leading to fibrosis.

Acetate, the most abundant endogenously produced short chain fatty acid has been linked to metabolic health. However, the impact of acetate on CVD-driven pathologies in PCOS is unknown. The present study therefore investigated the effects of acetate on cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with PCOS in rat model, and the possible involvement of PCSK9/NF-kB-dependent pathways.\nEight-week-old female Wistar rats were allotted into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06) and the groups received vehicle, acetate (200\u00a0mg/kg), letrozole (1\u00a0mg/kg) and letrozole plus acetate respectively. The administrations were done once daily by oral gavage and lasted for 21\u00a0days.\nIn letrozole-induced PCOS rats characterized with insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, elevated plasma testosterone and decreased 17-\u03b2 estradiol as well as degenerated ovarian follicles, there was a significant increase in plasma and cardiac lipid/lipoproteins, lipid peroxidation, inflammatory mediators (NF-kB and TNF-\u03b1), \u03b3-glutamyl transferase/lactate dehydrogenase and lactate content, PCSK9 and reduction in plasma and cardiac antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione) and plasma nitric oxide synthesis (eNOS and NO) compared with the control rats. In addition, immunohistochemical assessment of cardiac tissue showed severe expression of inflammasome in letrozole-induced PCOS rats compared with the control rats. Nevertheless, supplementation with acetate significantly attenuated these alterations.\nThe present results suggest that acetate protects against cardiac inflammation in a rat model of PCOS by suppression of PCSK9 and NF-kB-dependent mechanisms.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2022-04-23", "authors": ["Kehinde SOlaniyi", "Stephanie EAreloegbe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120560"}

{"title": "3D cell morphology detection by association for embryo heart morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Advances in tissue engineering for cardiac regenerative medicine require cellular-level understanding of the mechanism of cardiac muscle growth during embryonic developmental stage. Computational methods to automatize cell segmentation in 3D and deliver accurate, quantitative morphology of cardiomyocytes, are imperative to provide insight into cell behavior underlying cardiac tissue growth. Detecting individual cells from volumetric images of dense tissue, poised with low signal-to-noise ratio and severe intensity in homogeneity, is a challenging task. In this article, we develop a robust segmentation tool capable of extracting cellular morphological parameters from 3D multifluorescence images of murine heart, captured via light-sheet microscopy. The proposed pipeline incorporates a neural network for 2D detection of nuclei and cell membranes. A graph-based global association employs the 2D nuclei detections to reconstruct 3D nuclei. A novel optimization embedding the network flow algorithm in an alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to solve the global object association problem. The associated 3D nuclei serve as the initialization of an active mesh model to obtain the 3D segmentation of individual myocardial cells. The efficiency of our method over the state-of-the-art methods is observed via various qualitative and quantitative evaluation.", "journal": "Biological imaging", "date": "2022-04-22", "authors": ["RituparnaSarkar", "DanielDarby", "Sigol\u00e8neMeilhac", "Jean-ChristopheOlivo-Marin"], "doi": "10.1017/S2633903X22000022"}
{"title": "Metabolites Concentration in Plasma and Heart Tissue in Relation to High Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T Level in Septic Shock Pigs.", "abstract": "Elevated circulating cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is frequent in septic shock patients. Signs of myocardial ischemia and myocyte necrosis are not universally present, but the precise mechanism for elevated cTnT is unknown. We investigated plasma and heart tissue metabolites concentration in six septic shock (SS) and three sham swine undergoing a protocol of polymicrobial septic shock and resuscitation, in order to highlight possible pathways and biomarkers involved in troponin release (high sensitive cardiac troponin T, hs-cTnT). The animals were divided into two groups: the high cTnT group (n = 3) were pigs showing a significantly higher concentration of cTnT and lactate after resuscitation; the low cTnT group (n = 6, three sham and three septic shock) characterized by a lower value of cTnT and a lactate level < 2 mmol/L. Spearman correlation was assessed on plasma fold-change of cTnT, cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10), and metabolites. Finally, the fold-change between the end of resuscitation and baseline values (Res./BL) of plasma metabolites was used to perform a partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) with three latent variables. Before building the model, the number of features was reduced by summing up the metabolites of the same class that resulted similarly correlated to cTnT fold-change. Proline and glycine were significantly higher in the high cTnT group at the end of experiment both in the myocardium and plasma analyses. Moreover, plasma proline fold-change was found to be positively correlated with cTnT and cytokine fold-changes, and trans-4-hydroxyproline (t4-OH-Pro) fold-change was positively correlated with cTnT fold-change. The PLS-DA model was able to separate the two groups and, among the first ranked features based on VIP score, we found sugars, t4-OH-Pro, proline, creatinine, total amount of sphingomyelins, and glycine. Proline, t4-OH-Pro, and glycine are very abundant in collagen, and our results may suggest that collagen degradation could represent a possible mechanism contributing to septic myocardial injury. The common phenotype of septic cardiomyopathy could be associated to dysregulated collagen metabolism and/or degradation, further exacerbated by higher inflammation and oxidative stress.", "journal": "Metabolites", "date": "2022-04-22", "authors": ["BernardoBollen Pinto", "ManuelaFerrario", "AntoineHerpain", "LauraBrunelli", "KarimBendjelid", "MartaCarrara", "RobertaPastorelli"], "doi": "10.3390/metabo12040319\n10.1186/s13054-018-2043-8\n10.1007/s11886-020-01277-2\n10.1097/00003246-200210000-00003\n10.1097/00003246-199907000-00018\n10.1186/cc4991\n10.1016/j.chest.2018.08.1037\n10.1309/04D2-Q3QA-WLHU-LRBP\n10.1016/j.hlc.2017.05.112\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2013.06.029\n10.3390/life11090914\n10.1155/2021/8897738\n10.1056/NEJM199305203282008\n10.1177/1751143714555303\n10.1378/chest.14-2259\n10.1038/s41569-020-00492-2\n10.1097/01.shk.0000235141.05528.47\n10.1016/j.ijcha.2019.03.001\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00011\n10.1109/TBME.2019.2894333\n10.1038/s41598-021-97855-7\n10.1007/s00726-008-0073-2\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.199\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.969279\n10.1177/2048872617748553\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.965327\n10.1152/ajpcell.2001.280.1.C53\n10.1161/01.RES.86.12.1259\n10.1097/00003246-199704000-00017\n10.1186/cc7780\n10.1097/01.CCM.0000206470.47721.8D\n10.2147/VHRM.S327661"}
{"title": "Pulsed Field Ablation to Treat Atrial Fibrillation: A Review of the Literature.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and catheter ablation, which can be used in symptomatic patients refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) remains the cornerstone of any ablation procedure. A major limitation of current catheter ablation procedures is important to recognize because even when the PVI is performed in highly experienced centers, PVI reconnection was documented in about 20% of patients. Therefore, better technology is needed to improve ablation lesions. One of the novelties in recent years is pulsed filed ablation (PFA), a non-thermal energy that uses trains of high-voltage, very-short-duration pulses to kill the cells. The mechanism of action of this energy consists of creating pores in the myocardiocyte cell membrane in a highly selective and tissue-specific way; this leads to death of the target cells reducing the risk of damage to surrounding non-cardiac tissues. In particular during the animal studies, PVI and atrial lines were performed effectively without PV stenosis. Using PFA directly on coronary arteries, there was no luminal narrowing, there has been no evidence of incidental phrenic nerve injury, and finally, PFA has been shown not to injure esophageal tissue when directly applied to the esophagus or indirectly through ablation in the left atrium. The aim of this review is to report all published animal and clinical studies regarding this new technology to treat paroxysmal and persistent AF.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular development and disease", "date": "2022-04-22", "authors": ["AntonioDi Monaco", "NicolaVitulano", "FedericaTroisi", "FedericoQuadrini", "ImmaRomanazzi", "ValeriaCalvi", "MassimoGrimaldi"], "doi": "10.3390/jcdd9040094\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000072767.89944.6E\n10.1093/europace/eux275\n10.1093/europace/euz318\n10.1007/s10840-021-00955-7\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht457\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu001\n10.1111/jce.14664\n10.1111/jce.13227\n10.1007/s10840-016-0102-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042622\n10.1007/s00399-022-00843-1\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.690092\n10.3390/jcm10225443\n10.1161/JAHA.120.020731\n10.1007/s10840-019-00574-3\n10.1161/CIRCEP.120.008817\n10.1161/CIRCEP.120.008580\n10.1161/CIRCEP.119.007781\n10.1161/CIRCEP.120.009229\n10.1115/1.4024510\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1995.tb06986.x\n10.1093/europace/eux244\n10.1532/HSF98.20061202\n10.1093/europace/eus171\n10.1371/journal.pone.0165475\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2015.06.018\n10.1371/journal.pone.0229214\n10.1161/01.RES.87.9.797\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2018.10.030\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.04.031\n10.1111/jce.13860\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.970079\n10.1016/j.jacep.2018.04.005\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.04.021\n10.1016/j.jacep.2021.02.014\n10.1161/CIRCEP.120.008718\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab724.0380\n10.1161/CIRCEP.121.010168\n10.1093/europace/euab090\n10.1093/europace/euab155\n10.1016/j.jacep.2021.08.016\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.07.007\n10.1111/jce.14311\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.03.002\n10.1186/1475-925X-10-102\n10.1038/srep40747"}

{"title": "Decellularization of Full Heart-Optimizing the Classical Sodium-Dodecyl-Sulfate-Based Decellularization Protocol.", "abstract": "Compared to cell therapy, where cells are injected into a defect region, the treatment of heart infarction with cells seeded in a vascularized scaffold bears advantages, such as an immediate nutrient supply or a controllable and persistent localization of cells. For this purpose, decellularized native tissues are a preferable choice as they provide an in vivo-like microenvironment. However, the quality of such scaffolds strongly depends on the decellularization process. Therefore, two protocols based on sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium deoxycholate were tailored and optimized for the decellularization of a porcine heart. The obtained scaffolds were tested for their applicability to generate vascularized cardiac patches. Decellularization with sodium dodecyl sulfate was found to be more suitable and resulted in scaffolds with a low amount of DNA, a highly preserved extracellular matrix composition, and structure shown by GAG quantification and immunohistochemistry. After seeding human endothelial cells into the vasculature, a coagulation assay demonstrated the functionality of the endothelial cells to minimize the clotting of blood. Human-induced pluripotent-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes in co-culture with fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells transferred the scaffold into a vascularized cardiac patch spontaneously contracting with a frequency of 25.61 \u00b1 5.99 beats/min for over 16 weeks. The customized decellularization protocol based on sodium dodecyl sulfate renders a step towards a preclinical evaluation of the scaffolds.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-04-22", "authors": ["ReemAl-Hejailan", "TobiasWeigel", "SebastianSch\u00fcrlein", "ConstantinBerger", "FutwanAl-Mohanna", "JanHansmann"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering9040147\n10.1155/2016/9682757\n10.1098/rsif.2006.0124\n10.1016/0022-5193(82)90388-5\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.639765\n10.1093/af/vfz014\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124743\n10.3791/50059\n10.1089/biores.2014.0046\n10.1016/j.jsb.2003.08.002\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.08.024\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.04.056\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306874\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1002/adbi.201600005\n10.1253/circj.CJ-10-0717\n10.1038/nm1684\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185916\n10.3791/50460\n10.1152/ajpcell.00192.2013\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1038/s41598-019-51911-5\n10.1038/cdd.2012.138\n10.1073/pnas.1415330111\n10.1016/S0022-5223(03)00074-6\n10.1089/scd.2010.0519\n10.1073/pnas.0610024104\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.222703\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.010\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1016/S1369-7021(11)70058-X\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.09.013"}
{"title": "Lysosomal storage disease associated with a CNP sequence variant in Dalmatian dogs.", "abstract": "A progressive neurological disorder was identified in purebred Dalmatian dogs. The disease is characterized by anxiety, pacing and circling, hypersensitivity, cognitive decline, sleep disturbance, loss of coordination, loss of control over urination and defecation, and visual impairment. Neurological signs first became apparent when the dogs were approximately 18\u00a0months of age and progressed slowly. Two affected littermates were euthanized at approximately 7\u00a0years, 5\u00a0months and 8\u00a0years, 2\u00a0months of age due to the severity of neurological impairment. The mother of the affected dogs and four other relatives exhibited milder, later-onset neurological signs. Pronounced accumulations of autofluorescent intracellular inclusions were found in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, optic nerve, and cardiac muscle of the affected dogs. These inclusions co-localized with immunolabeling of the lysosomal marker protein LAMP2 and bound antibodies to mitochondrial ATPase subunit c, indicating that the dogs suffered from a lysosomal storage disease with similarities to the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that the storage bodies were surrounded by a single-layer membrane, but the storage granules were distinct from those reported for other lysosomal storage diseases. Whole genome sequences, generated with DNA from the two euthanized Dalmatians, both contained a rare, homozygous single-base deletion and reading-frame shift in CNP which encodes the enzyme CNPase (EC 3.1.4.37). The late-onset disease was exhibited by five of seven related Dalmatians that were heterozygous for the deletion allele and over 8\u00a0years of age, whereas none of 16 age-matched reference-allele homozygotes developed neurologic signs. No CNPase antigen could be detected with immunohistochemical labeling in tissues from the dogs with the earlier-onset disorder. Similar to the later-onset Dalmatians, autofluorescent storage granules were apparent in brain and cardiac tissue from transgenic mice that were nullizygous for Cnp. Based on the clinical signs, the histopathological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular-genetic findings, and the finding that nullizygous Cnp mice accumulate autofluorescent storage granules, we propose that the earlier-onset Dalmatian disorder is a novel lysosomal storage disease that results from a loss-of-function mutation in CNP and that shares features characteristic of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. That the later-onset disorder occurred only in dogs heterozygous for the CNP deletion variant suggests that this disorder is a result of the variant allele's presence.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2022-04-22", "authors": ["GarrettBullock", "Gary SJohnson", "TendaiMhlanga-Mutangadura", "Scott CPetesch", "SamanthaThompson", "SandraGoebbels", "Martin LKatz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2022.146513"}

However, a low grafted rate is a significant obstacle for effective cardiac tissue regeneration after transplantation. This protocol shows that multiple hiPSC-CM ultrasound-guided percutaneous injections into an MI area effectively increase cell transplantation rates. The study also describes the entire hiPSC-CM culture process, pretreatment, and ultrasound-guided percutaneous delivery methods. In addition, the use of human mitochondrial DNA help detect the absence of hiPSC-CMs in other mouse organs. Lastly, this paper describes the changes in cardiac function, angiogenesis, cell size, and apoptosis at the infarcted border zone in mice 4 weeks after cell delivery. It can be concluded that echocardiography-guided percutaneous injection of the left ventricular myocardium is a feasible, relatively invasive, satisfactory, repeatable, and effective cellular therapy.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2022-04-19", "authors": ["XunWu", "KeleQin", "DiWang", "KunXiang", "JunPeng", "JianjunGuo", "JinfuYang", "ChengmingFan"], "doi": "10.3791/63647"}
{"title": "Integrative bioinformatics analysis of potential therapeutic targets and immune infiltration characteristics in dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is currently the major cause of systolic heart failure. This study explored potential therapeutic targets and investigated the role of immune cell infiltration in DCM.\nThree DCM datasets (GSE3585, GSE9800, and GSE84796) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were merged into an integrated dataset, and batch effects were removed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and the associations between gene co-expression modules and clinical traits were assessed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in R software. Any DEGs from the integrated dataset overlapped with the significant module genes were defined as common genes (CGs). Enrichment analysis of the CGs was performed. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the CGs was visualized and the hub gene was identified by using Cytoscape 3.8.2 software. The miRNA-transcription factor-mRNA (miRNA-TF-mRNA) network was constructed using Cytoscape to unveil the regulatory relationships in DCM. Finally, the CIBERSORT method (https://cibersort.stanford.edu/) was used to investigate immune cell infiltration in DCM.\nA total of 53 DEGs were identified, and 5 gene co-expression modules were detected by WGCNA of the DCM and control group samples of cardiac tissue. Genes such as FRZB, ASPN, and PHLDA1 were significantly upregulated, whereas IDH2 and ENDOG were significantly downregulated. Functional enrichment analysis showed that CGs were mainly enriched in the extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling pathway. ASPN was the hub gene in the PPI network. The miRNA-TF-mRNA network revealed that FRZB and ASPN were targeted by paired related homeobox 2 (Prrx2). We also found that miR-129-5p could regulate ASPN, PHLDA1, and IDH2 simultaneously. The immune infiltration analysis revealed higher levels of M1 macrophages in DCM samples than in the control samples.\nIn conclusion, we speculate that miR-129-5p might target ASPN in regulating DCM via the ECM signaling pathway. Macrophage infiltration may be involved in ECM remodeling and eventually lead to DCM.", "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "date": "2022-04-19", "authors": ["YujiaoYang", "PingLiu", "RuolingTeng", "FenfenLiu", "CuipingZhang", "XiangLu", "YiDing"], "doi": "10.21037/atm-22-732\n10.1002/ejhf.1103\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz908\n10.1111/pin.12868\n10.1007/s00059-004-2626-9\n10.1016/j.jaci.2017.08.034\n10.17219/acem/115088\n10.1111/jcmm.13535\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.1997.tb02739.x\n10.1002/rmv.2131\n10.1093/cvr/cvp225\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043545\n10.1016/S0167-7799(01)01910-2\n10.1007/978-1-60761-247-6_15\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7493-1_12\n10.1093/nar/gkv007\n10.1186/s12859-020-03589-0\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa128\n10.1186/1471-2105-9-559\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1093/nar/gkq1056\n10.7554/eLife.05005\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001274\n10.1172/jci.insight.148637\n10.1089/dna.2020.5995\n10.1155/2021/6653802\n10.1101/gad.231233.113\n10.1002/humu.21186\n10.1038/s41375-020-01043-x\n10.4161/auto.28235\n10.2460/ajvr.67.6.963\n10.1002/path.1437\n10.1007/s10741-015-9509-4\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.06.253\n10.3389/fphys.2021.708656\n10.1074/jbc.M011290200\n10.1073/pnas.94.21.11196\n10.2174/1566524014666140128105352\n10.1038/s41556-018-0107-2\n10.4161/adip.32209\n10.1038/s41584-019-0324-5\n10.1007/s00441-014-1861-5\n10.1111/jcmm.14914\n10.1016/S0945-053X(01)00194-9\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.11.035\n10.4049/jimmunol.1100591\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.05.008\n10.1007/978-3-319-57613-8_10\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173090\n10.1007/978-3-540-75546-3_15\n10.1016/S0198-8859(02)00798-X\n10.1055/s-0030-1251504\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.686384\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.05.040\n10.1007/s10741-020-09940-0\n10.1177/0022034515606859\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.731500\n10.1186/s13071-015-0974-3\n10.1080/15384101.2020.1732515"}

Three-dimensional cardiac tissues were engineered by seeding human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) fiber sheets (3D-hiPSC-CTs) and cultured in the RWV bioreactor (RWV group) or under static conditions (control group). The tissues were transplanted into a myocardial infarction nude rat model, and cardiac performance was evaluated. In the RWV group, cell viability and contractile and electrical properties significantly improved, mature cardiomyocytes were observed, and mechanical stress-related mediators of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling were upregulated compared with those of the control. Four weeks post-transplantation, tissue survival and left ventricular ejection fraction significantly improved in the RWV group.

Renal IR-related oxidative stress and inflammation followed by cell apoptosis play a crucial role in IR-induced distant organ pathological damages. Prazosin has shown protective effects against IR-injuries. Thus, the current study intended to investigate the possible protective role of prazosin against the consequents of renal IR in the heart and brain tissues. To reach this goal, rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=7): Sham, IR and prazosin pretreatment-IR animals (1\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally injection of prazosin 45\u2009min before IR induction). After 6\u2009h reperfusion, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant markers levels were evaluated in the both, brain and heart tissue. Moreover, apoptotic pathway in the heart and brain tissues were assessed by western blotting. Accordingly, prazosin pretreatment in IR model rats could significantly increase the antioxidant capacity and attenuate apoptotic pathways by increasing the bcl-2 levels and decreasing the expression of Bax and caspase 3 enzymes (P<0.05). Thus, prazosin suppressed cellular damages of heart and brain tissues post kidney IR by anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects, which suggests the plausible use of prazosin in improving the clinical outcomes during AKI after further investigations.", "journal": "Drug research", "date": "2022-04-16", "authors": ["ZahraMalekinejad", "ShadiAghajani", "MostafaJeddi", "ReihaneQahremani", "SinaShahbazi", "YasinBagheri", "ElhamAhmadian"], "doi": "10.1055/a-1806-1453"}

Consequently, this has highlighted the need for a standardized, unbiased, robust and automatic way to analyze hallmark physiological features of EHTs. In this study we described and validated a standalone application to analyze physiological features of EHTs in an automatic, robust, and unbiased way, using low computational time. The standalone application \"EHT Analysis\" contains two analysis modes (automatic and manual) to analyzes the contractile properties and the contraction kinetics of EHTs from high speed bright field videos. As output data, the graphs of displacement, contraction force and contraction kinetics per file will be generated together with the raw data. Additionally, it also generates a summary file containing all the data from the analyzed files, which facilitates and speeds up the post analysis. From our study we highlight the importance of analyzing the axial stress which is the force per surface area (\u03bcN/mm2). This allows to have a readout overtime of tissue compaction, axial stress and leave the option to calculate at the end point of an experiment the physiological cross-section area (PSCA). We demonstrated the utility of this tool by analyzing contractile properties and compaction over time of EHTs made out of a double reporter human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) line (NKX2.5EGFP/+-COUP-TFIImCherry/+) and different ratios of human adult cardiac fibroblasts (HCF).

To test this hypothesis we fed C57black/6 male mice for 6\u00a0week with a high fat diet (60% energy) and submitted them to endotoxemic shock using E. coli LPS (10\u00a0mg/kg). Inflammatory markers (cytokines and adhesion molecules) were determined in plasma and heart tissue, as well as heart mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Obesity markedly shortened the survival rate of mouse after LPS injection and induced a persistent systemic inflammation since TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and resistin plasma levels were higher 24\u00a0h after LPS injection. Heart tissue inflammation was significantly higher in obese mice, as detected by elevated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1). Obese animals presented reduced maximum respiratory rate after LPS injection, however fatty acid oxidation increased in both groups. LPS decreased mitochondrial DNA content and mitochondria biogenesis factors, such as PGC1\u03b1 and PGC1\u03b2, in both groups, while NRF1 expression was significantly stimulated in obese mice hearts. Mitochondrial fusion/fission balance was only altered by obesity, with no influence of endotoxemia. Obesity accelerated endotoxemia death rate due to higher systemic inflammation and decreased heart mitochondrial respiratory capacity.", "journal": "Inflammation", "date": "2022-04-13", "authors": ["Ricardo CostaPetroni", "Suelen Jeronymo Souzade Oliveira", "Thais PinedaFungaro", "Suely K KAriga", "Hermes VieiraBarbeiro", "Francisco GarciaSoriano", "Thais Martinsde Lima"], "doi": "10.1007/s10753-022-01669-2"}

{"title": "Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Applications in Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited heart muscle disorder characterized by progressive replacement of cardiomyocytes by fibrofatty tissue, ventricular dilatation, cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Interest in molecular biomechanics for these disorders is constantly growing. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a well-established technic to study the mechanobiology of biological samples under physiological and pathological conditions at the cellular scale. However, a review which described all the different data that can be obtained using the AFM (cell elasticity, adhesion behavior, viscoelasticity, beating force, and frequency) is still missing. In this review, we will discuss several techniques that highlight the potential of AFM to be used as a tool for assessing the biomechanics involved in ACM. Indeed, analysis of genetically mutated cells with AFM reveal abnormalities of the cytoskeleton, cell membrane structures, and defects of contractility. The higher the Young's modulus, the stiffer the cell, and it is well known that abnormal tissue stiffness is symptomatic of a range of diseases. The cell beating force and frequency provide information during the depolarization and repolarization phases, complementary to cell electrophysiology (calcium imaging, MEA, patch clamp). In addition, original data is also presented to emphasize the unique potential of AFM as a tool to assess fibrosis in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-04-13", "authors": ["BrisaPe\u00f1a", "MostafaAdbel-Hafiz", "MariaCavasin", "LuisaMestroni", "OrfeoSbaizero"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23073700\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa719\n10.1016/S1054-8807(01)00067-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.875351\n10.1084/jem.20090641\n10.3390/jcdd7020021\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.001003\n10.1161/CIRCGEN.119.002467\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.05.065\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000645\n10.1007/s00441-014-2015-5\n10.1007/s00439-013-1323-2\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001605\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr451\n10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312338\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.033558\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs373\n10.1161/CIRCGEN.118.002337\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu493\n10.1097/HCO.0000000000000509\n10.1038/nature10316\n10.1038/nrm3120\n10.1038/ncb3524\n10.7554/eLife.24958\n10.1007/s11999-010-1258-z\n10.1186/s12915-015-0150-4\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1111/cpr.12478\n10.1126/science.1191035\n10.1007/978-1-4899-8032-8_20\n10.1038/nature11799\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.930\n10.1002/jemt.22419\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2013.01.006\n10.3389/fmolb.2020.00085\n10.1002/jemt.22776\n10.1002/jemt.22706\n10.3791/50497\n10.1007/s00249-008-0311-2\n10.1016/j.micron.2007.06.011\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.07.010\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.014\n10.1016/j.jbbm.2005.11.003\n10.1152/ajpcell.00192.2013\n10.1093/cvr/cvy040\n10.1016/j.micron.2017.12.005\n10.1172/jci.insight.148637\n10.1088/0957-4484/21/44/445101\n10.3390/ijms160818149\n10.3390/ijms22179193\n10.1021/acsami.7b11438\n10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.1.H244\n10.1172/JCI7798\n10.1016/j.tcb.2011.04.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077384\n10.1016/j.micron.2016.03.002\n10.1038/nm.4082\n10.1016/j.matbio.2010.01.008\n10.1074/jbc.M112.417519\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.046462\n10.1038/s41598-017-06942-1\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.09.014\n10.1152/ajpheart.01017.2005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.08.014\n10.1172/JCI98215\n10.1016/j.ejps.2013.05.028\n10.1159/000097673\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.006\n10.1016/j.micron.2013.06.008\n10.1155/2016/2646212\n10.1016/j.matbio.2019.11.005\n10.1002/bdra.20810\n10.1007/BF01921738\n10.1016/S1054-8807(97)00120-8\n10.1002/cphy.c140070\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-062117-121129\n10.3390/cells10030663\n10.1038/srep13378\n10.1016/j.addr.2019.05.011\n10.3390/jcdd6040035\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.3389/fcell.2020.621644\n10.1369/00221554211046777\n10.1007/s10921-014-0273-5\n10.1038/s41569-019-0200-7\n10.1186/s13023-016-0407-1\n10.3390/ijms21176320\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.111.961854\n10.1093/cvr/cvu206\n10.1371/journal.pone.0121723\n10.1016/j.copbio.2011.11.032\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu077\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106394\n10.1016/j.bpj.2015.11.002\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00173\n10.1080/19491034.2015.1084453\n10.1038/srep13388\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03175\n10.3233/BIR-190229\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037559\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003552\n10.1021/ac3022532"}
{"title": "An Overview of the Cardiorenal Protective Mechanisms of SGLT2 Inhibitors.", "abstract": "Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors block glucose reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule, an insulin-independent mechanism that plays a critical role in glycemic regulation in diabetes. In addition to their glucose-lowering effects, SGLT2 inhibitors prevent both renal damage and the onset of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events, in particular heart failure with both reduced and preserved ejection fraction. These unexpected benefits prompted changes in treatment guidelines and scientific interest in the underlying mechanisms. Aside from the target effects of SGLT2 inhibition, a wide spectrum of beneficial actions is described for the kidney and the heart, even though the cardiac tissue does not express SGLT2 channels. Correction of cardiorenal risk factors, metabolic adjustments ameliorating myocardial substrate utilization, and optimization of ventricular loading conditions through effects on diuresis, natriuresis, and vascular function appear to be the main underlying mechanisms for the observed cardiorenal protection. Additional clinical advantages associated with using SGLT2 inhibitors are antifibrotic effects due to correction of inflammation and oxidative stress, modulation of mitochondrial function, and autophagy. Much research is required to understand the numerous and complex pathways involved in SGLT2 inhibition.

Therefore, developing new therapeutic strategies for heart regeneration is a major goal in modern cardiac biology and medicine. Recent advances in stem cell biology and biotechnologies such as human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and cardiac tissue engineering hold great promise for opening novel paths to heart regeneration and repair for heart disease, although these areas are still in their infancy. In this review, we summarize and discuss the recent progress in cardiac tissue engineering strategies, highlighting stem cell engineering and cardiomyocyte maturation, development of novel functional biomaterials and biofabrication tools, and their therapeutic applications involving drug discovery, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine for heart disease.", "journal": "International journal

{"title": "Zerumbone, a humulane sesquiterpene from Syringa pinnatifolia, attenuates cardiac fibrosis by inhibiting of the TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway after myocardial infarction in mice.", "abstract": "Zerumbone (ZER) is a humulane sesquiterpene isolated from Syringa pinnatifolia Hemsl., a representative Mongolian herbal medicine that is used to treat cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathological process in cardiovascular disease that results from the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2/Smad pathway is a canonical signaling pathway that directly induces expressions of ECM-related genes. Currently, the cardioprotective effect and underlying mechanisms of ZER on the inhibition of cardiac fibrosis are not well known.\nTo explore the cardioprotective properties and pharmacological mechanism of ZER against cardiac fibrosis via the TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway.\nMyocardial infarction (MI) model was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in ICR mice. The mice were randomly divided into six groups: sham, model, low-dose ZER (ZER-L), medium-dose ZER (ZER-M), high-dose ZER (ZER-H) and fosinopril. Mice in each group were intragastrically administered treatments for 21 days, and cardiac function was evaluated by 2D echocardiography. The pathological structure of the heart was examined by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Content of collagen I and collagen III were assessed by immunofluorescence methods. The inhibitory effect of ZER on TGF-\u03b21 protein expression was predicted by molecular docking technology. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to measure the levels of genes and proteins expressed in the TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway and MMPs. TGF-\u03b21-treated cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) of neonatal SD rats were adopted for in vitro studies.\nCardiac ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) in the model group were markedly decreased compared with those in the sham group, indicating that the MI model was successfully established. ZER and fosinopril elevated EF and FS values, suggesting cardioprotective effects. Pathological staining and immunofluorescence analysis showed that the content of collagen I and collagen III increased in the cardiac tissue of mice in model group, while ZER treatment obviously reduced collagen levels. The molecular docking simulations predicted the hydrophobic interactions between ZER and TGF-\u03b21. In addition, the expression of TGF-\u03b21, p-Smad2/3 and MMPs in the ZER treatment group was significantly decreased compared with the model group. In vitro studies further confirmed that \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and p-Smad2/3 increased markedly in cardiac fibroblasts after incubation with TGF-\u03b21, and treatment with ZER suppressed the expression of \u03b1-SMA and TGF-\u03b21 downstream proteins in cardiac fibroblasts.\nZER rescues cardiac function by attenuating cardiac fibrosis, and the antifibrotic effect may be mediated by blocking the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2022-04-12", "authors": ["JunjunLi", "FuxingGe", "ShanaWuken", "ShungangJiao", "PanlongChen", "MeiwenHuang", "XiaoliGao", "JuanLiu", "PengfeiTu", "XingyunChai", "LuqiHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154078"}
{"title": "High-throughput rhythmic regulation of cardiomyocytes by integrated electrical stimulation and video-based automated analysis biosensing platform.", "abstract": "In cardiac tissue engineering, electric stimulation is an efficient approach to improve the formation of cardiac tissue from individual cardiomyocyte. The regulation conditions of electric stimulation should be screened in an efficient way. However, the lack of high-throughput and large-scale assessment platforms limited the effectively screen the regulation conditions. Here, we develop a high-throughput integrated electrical stimulation system to rhythmically regulate the cardiomyocytes in situ. The state of regulated cardiomyocytes is characterized by a video-based automated biosensing system to analyze the beating of cardiomyocytes. Electrical stimulation conditions are optimized to regulate the cardiomyocyte state in vitro to replace the complex bioactive molecules and materials. By the video analysis, the accurate beating rate and regularity of cardiomyocyte can be determined. The results show that electrical stimulation frequency is a significant factor to regulate the cardiomyocyte beating. The electrical stimulation with a frequency of 3\u00a0Hz can effectively regulate the primary rat cardiomyocytes with normal rhythm. This high-throughput electrical stimulation and a video-based automated biosensing system will be a promising and powerful tool to effectively optimize the regulation conditions of cardiomyocyte in vitro, and possess broad application prospects in cardiac tissue engineering and pharmaceutical industry.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2022-04-12", "authors": ["JunqingLiu", "HaoWang", "DongxinXu", "YanLi", "JiaruFang", "MingyueZhang", "QijianXia", "ZhanyunHuang", "NanCao", "NingHu", "JunGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2022.114252"}
{"title": "Inflammation and resolution signaling in cardiac repair and heart failure.", "abstract": "Unresolved inflammation is a key mediator of advanced heart failure. Especially, damage, pathogen, and lifestyle-associated molecular patterns are the major factors in initiating baseline inflammatory diseases, particularly in cardiac pathology. After a significant cardiac injury like a heart attack, splenic and circulating leukocytes begin a highly optimized sequence of immune cell recruitment (neutrophils and monocytes) to coordinate effective tissue repair. An injured cardiac tissue repair and homeostasis are dependent on clearance of cellular debris where the recruited leukocytes transition from a pro-inflammatory to a reparative program through resolution process. After a cardiac injury, macrophages play a decisive role in cardiac repair through the biosynthesis of endogenous lipid mediators that ensure a timely tissue repair while avoiding chronic inflammation and impaired cardiac repair. However, dysregulation of resolution of inflammation processes due to cardiometabolic defects (obesity, hypertension, and diabetes), aging, or co-medication(s) lead to impaired cardiac repair. Hence, the presented review demonstrates the fundamental role of leukocytes, in particular macrophages orchestrate the inflammation and resolution biology, focusing on the biosynthesis of specialized lipid mediators in cardiac repair and heart failure.

Splenic abscess and aorto-cavitary fistula are rarer phenomena and are indicative of calamitous infection. The authors present the case of an otherwise healthy 61-year-old man presenting with a 2-month history of non-specific symptoms, who developed suppurative endocarditis with a fistulating aortic root abscess, combined with severe sepsis, splenic embolization and complete heart block. \nInfective endocarditis is a condition caused by bacteria invading the body and damaging the heart, especially the heart valves. Usually, the infection is diagnosed relatively swiftly by blood tests and images of the heart. Rarely, if this condition isn't managed promptly, the infection can progress to cause further damage to the heart and can spread to other organs and lead to a plethora of complications. Here, the authors report a case of a single patient who sought medical attention after 2 months of feeling unwell.

{"title": "From engineered heart tissue to cardiac organoid.", "abstract": "The advent of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) presented a new paradigm to employ hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) in drug screening and disease modeling. However, hPSC-CMs differentiated in conventional two-dimensional systems are structurally and functionally immature. Moreover, these differentiation systems generate predominantly one type of cell. Since the heart includes not only CMs but other cell types, such monolayer cultures have limitations in simulating the native heart. Accordingly, three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissues have been developed as a better platform by including various cardiac cell types and extracellular matrices. Two advances were made for 3D cardiac tissue generation. One type is engineered heart tissues (EHTs), which are constructed by 3D cell culture of cardiac cells using an engineering technology. This system provides a convenient real-time analysis of cardiac function, as well as a precise control of the input/output flow and mechanical/electrical stimulation. The other type is cardiac organoids, which are formed through self-organization of differentiating cardiac lineage cells from hPSCs.

The use of animal models in cardiovascular research has led to considerable advances in treatment and in our understanding of the pathophysiology of many CVDs. Still, animals may not fully recapitulate human disease states; species differences have long been postulated to be one of the main reasons for a failure of translation between animals and humans in drug discovery and development. Indeed, it has become increasingly clear over the past few decades that to answer certain biomedical questions, like the physiological mechanisms that go awry in many human CVDs, animal tissues may not always be the best option to use. While human cardiac tissue has long been used for laboratory research, published findings often contradict each other, leading to difficulties in interpretation. Current difficulties in utilizing human cardiac tissue include differences in acquisition time, varying tissue procurement protocols, and the struggle to define a human \"control\" sample.

However, implementation of intensive chemotherapy protocols in this age group is associated with increased treatment-related toxicities, affecting almost every organ and system. In this case, the focus of our interest was on rather rare entities: steroid-induced psychosis that seldom develops in children and adolescents, and choroid plexus hemosiderosis, infrequently identified as a first sign of iron overload.\nThe aim of this paper is to present a challenging case of a 15-year-old Caucasian male patient treated for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia and who experienced various adverse incidents during intensive chemotherapy, thus necessitating a high-quality multidisciplinary approach. Slow minimal residual disease clearance was an additional concerning issue. Induction and re-induction were complicated by steroid-induced hyperglycemia that required multiple-week insulin. During consolidation, acute kidney injury on the basis of chronic kidney disease was verified, demanding subsequent drug dose modifications. By the end of re-induction, after dexamethasone cessation, infrequent steroid-induced psychosis, presented as incoherent speech, aggressive behavior, and mood swings, required intensive psychiatric support. Neurological evaluation of seizures revealed uncommon choroid plexus hemosiderosis by brain magnetic resonance imaging, warranting appropriate selection of iron chelation therapy in the context of preexisting nephropathy. Ultimately, iron deposits of moderate intensity were verified by liver magnetic resonance imaging, while heart tissue remained intact. The early diagnosis and adequate treatment of aforementioned difficult toxicities resulted in complete recovery of the patient.\nTreating adolescents with high-risk acute leukemia and multiple therapy-related morbidities remains a challenge, even in the era of extensive and effective supportive therapy.

{"title": "Neither cardiac mitochondrial DNA variation nor copy number contribute to congenital heart disease risk.", "abstract": "The well-established manifestation of mitochondrial mutations in functional cardiac disease (e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathy) prompted the hypothesis that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence and/or copy number (mtDNAcn) variation contribute to cardiac defects in congenital heart disease (CHD). MtDNAcns were calculated and rare, non-synonymous mtDNA mutations were identified in 1,837 CHD-affected proband-parent trios, 116 CHD-affected singletons, and 114 paired cardiovascular tissue/blood samples. The variant allele fraction (VAF) of heteroplasmic variants in mitochondrial RNA from 257 CHD cardiovascular tissue samples was also calculated. On average, mtDNA from blood had 0.14 rare variants and 52.9 mtDNA copies per nuclear genome per proband. No variation with parental age at proband birth or CHD-affected proband age was seen. mtDNAcns in valve/vessel tissue (320 \u00b1 70) were lower than in atrial tissue (1,080 \u00b1 320, p\u00a0= 6.8E-21), which were lower than in ventricle tissue (1,340 \u00b1 280, p\u00a0= 1.4E-4). The frequency of rare variants in CHD-affected individual DNA was indistinguishable from the frequency in an unaffected cohort, and proband mtDNAcns did not vary from those of CHD cohort parents. In both the CHD and the comparison cohorts, mtDNAcns were significantly correlated between mother-child, father-child, and mother-father. mtDNAcns among people with European (mean\u00a0= 52.0), African (53.0), and Asian haplogroups (53.5) were calculated and were significantly different for European and Asian haplogroups (p\u00a0= 2.6E-3). Variant heteroplasmic fraction (HF) in blood correlated well with paired cardiovascular tissue HF (r\u00a0= 0.975) and RNA VAF (r\u00a0= 0.953), which suggests blood HF is a reasonable proxy for HF in heart tissue.

{"title": "Multiphoton microscopy providing pathological-level quantification of myocardial fibrosis in transplanted human heart.", "abstract": "Multiphoton microscopy (MPM), a high-resolution laser scanning technique, has been shown to provide detailed real-time information on fibrosis assessment in animal models. But the value of MPM in human histology, especially in heart tissue, has not been fully explored. We aimed to evaluate the association between myocardial fibrosis measured by MPM and that measured by histological staining in the transplanted human heart. One hundred and twenty samples of heart tissue were obtained from 20 patients consisting of 10 dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM) and 10 ischemic cardiomyopathies (ICM). MPM and picrosirius red staining were performed to quantify collagen volume fraction (CVF) in explanted hearts postoperatively. Cardiomyocyte and myocardial fibrosis could be clearly visualized by MPM. Although patients with ICM had significantly greater MPM-derived CVF than patients with DCM (25.33\u00a0\u2009\u00b1\u200912.65\u00a0% vs. 19.82\u00a0\u2009\u00b1\u20098.62\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.006), there was a substantial overlap of CVF values between them. MPM-derived CVF was comparable to that derived from picrosirius red staining based on all samples (22.58\u2009\u00b1\u200911.13% vs. 21.19\u2009\u00b1\u200911.79%, p\u2009=\u20090.348), as well as in DCM samples and ICM samples.

Here, a rat model of sub-chronic respiratory exposure to SiNPs was conducted, and the histopathological analysis and ultrastructural investigation of heart tissues were carried out. More importantly, a comprehensive analysis of whole-genome transcription was utilized in rat heart to uncover key biological and cellular mechanisms triggered by SiNPs. The widening of myocardial space and partial fiber rupture were clearly manifested in rat heart after prolonged SiNPs exposure, particularly accompanied by mitochondrial swelling and cristae rupture. With the aid of Affymetrix GeneChips, 3153 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after SiNPs exposure, including 1916 down- and 1237 up-regulated genes.

{"title": "ATP6AP2 knockdown in cardiomyocyte deteriorates heart function via compromising autophagic flux and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.", "abstract": "Moderate autophagy can remove damaged proteins and organelles. In some inflammatory diseases, autophagy plays a protective role by inhibiting the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3(NLRP3). (Pro)renin receptor (PRR, or ATP6AP2) is a critical component of the V-ATPase required for autophagy. It remains controversial about ATP6AP2 in the pathological process. The impact of ATP6AP2 on NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagic flux remains unknown under pressure overload stress. This research explores the potential link between ATP6AP2, autophagic flux, and NLRP3. There was upregulation of ATP6AP2 from 5-day post-TAC, and this expression remained at a high level until 8-weeks post-TAC in wild mice. Meanwhile, autophagic flux switched from early compensatory activation to blocking in the heart failure phase. NLRP3 activation can be seen at 8-week post-TAC. Adenovirus-mediated knockdown of ATP6AP2(shR-ATP6AP2) accelerated the progress of heart failure. After TAC was induced, shR-ATP6AP2 significantly deteriorated heart function and fibrosis compared with the shR-Scr group. Meanwhile, there was an elevated expression of NLRP3 and autophagic flux blockage. A transgenic mouse(Tg) with cardio-restricted ATP6AP2/(P)RR overexpression was constructed. Although high expression in cardiac tissue, there were no spontaneous functional abnormalities under the basal state. Cardiac function, fibrosis, hypertrophy remained identical to the control TAC group. However, SQSTM1/P62 was reduced, which indicated the relief of autophagic flux blockage. Further, Neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVMs) transfected with shR-ATP6AP2 showed more susceptibility than sh-Scr NRVMs to phenylephrine-induced cell death. More reactive oxygen species (ROS) or mito-ROS accumulated in the shR-ATP6AP2 group when phenylephrine stimulation. Blocking NLRP3 activation in vivo partly rescued cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. In conclusion, ATP6AP2 upregulation is a compensatory response to pressure overload. If not effectively compensated, it compromises autophagic flux, leads to dysfunctional mitochondria accumulation, further produces ROS to activate NLRP3, eventually accelerates heart failure.", "journal": "Cell death discovery", "date": "2022-04-06", "authors": ["LeiLi", "Ya-JuanCui", "YuLiu", "Hui-XinLi", "Yu-DongSu", "Sheng-NanLi", "Lan-LanWang", "Yue-WenZhao", "Shuang-XiWang", "FengYan", "BoDong"], "doi": "10.1038/s41420-022-00967-w"}

A single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) was administrated to male Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg to induce diabetes mellitus (DM). Dapa (1 mg/kg, orally), Lira (0.4 mg/kg, s.c.), and Dapa-Lira combination were administrated for 8 weeks once-daily. Blood samples were evaluated for glucose level and biochemical markers of cardiac functions. Cardiac tissue was dissected and assessed for redox homeostasis (malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT)), pro-inflammatory mediators (NF-\u03baB and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)), and apoptotic effectors (caspase-3). Moreover, the effect of treatments on the cardiac cellular structure was studied. Dapa and/or Lira administration resulted in significant improvement of biochemical indices of cardiac function. Additionally, all treatment groups demonstrated restoration of oxidant/antioxidant balance. Moreover, inflammation and apoptosis key elements were markedly downregulated in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Basal oxidation of conserved cysteines modulates cardiac titin stiffness and dynamics.", "abstract": "Titin, as the main protein responsible for the passive stiffness of the sarcomere, plays a key role in diastolic function and is a determinant factor in the etiology of heart disease. Titin stiffness depends on unfolding and folding transitions of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains of the I-band, and recent studies have shown that oxidative modifications of cryptic cysteines belonging to these Ig domains modulate their mechanical properties in vitro. However, the relevance of this mode of titin mechanical modulation in vivo remains largely unknown. Here, we describe the high evolutionary conservation of titin mechanical cysteines and show that they are remarkably oxidized in murine cardiac tissue. Mass spectrometry analyses indicate a similar landscape of basal oxidation in murine and human myocardium. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate how disulfides and S-thiolations on these cysteines increase the dynamics of the protein at physiological forces, while enabling load- and isoform-dependent regulation of titin stiffness. Our results demonstrate the role of conserved cysteines in the modulation of titin mechanical properties in vivo and point to potential redox-based pathomechanisms in heart disease.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2022-04-04", "authors": ["El\u00edasHerrero-Gal\u00e1n", "In\u00e9sMart\u00ednez-Mart\u00edn", "CristinaS\u00e1nchez-Gonz\u00e1lez", "NataliaVicente", "ElenaBonz\u00f3n-Kulichenko", "EnriqueCalvo", "CarmenSuay-Corredera", "Maria RosariaPricolo", "\u00c1ngelFern\u00e1ndez-Trasancos", "DianaVel\u00e1zquez-Carreras", "Claudio Bad\u00edaCareaga", "MahmoudAbdellatif", "SimonSedej", "Peter PRainer", "DavidGiganti", "Ra\u00falP\u00e9rez-Jim\u00e9nez", "Jes\u00fasV\u00e1zquez", "JorgeAlegre-Cebollada"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2022.102306"}

Matsum. & Nakai. seeds in isoproterenol induced myocardial infraction.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant cause of morbidity and death in the current world, posing a challenge to both developing and industrialized nation's health systems. Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai. seeds have long been utilized to supplement and enhance health and treat cardiovascular illnesses. However, its treatments for CVDs are still unknown. More research is required to fully comprehend the impact of C. lanatus seeds on vasorelaxation and myocardial infractions.\nTherefore, an integrated metabolomics profiling technique was used to investigate possible pathways of C. lanatus in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI). Isoproterenol causes long-term cardiac hypertrophy by causing cardiomyocyte compensatory loss, eventually leading to heart failure.\nIn vitro models of vasoconstriction, atrium, and in vivo models of invasive blood pressure measurement and isoproterenol (ISO) induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats were used to understand underlying mechanistic by LC-MS/MS based dynamic metabolomics analysis of the serum and heart samples to be investigated the effect of ethanolic extract of C. lanatus (Cl.EtOH).\nCl.EtOH exhibited vasorelaxant, negative chronotropic, and inotropic effects in in-vitro models whereas, a potent hypotensive effect was observed in normotensive rats. The Cl.EtOH protected the animals from ISO-induced myocardial infarction (MI) with therapeutic interventions in left ventricular thickness, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, mRNA gene expression, biochemical assays, and metabolomic profiling of serum and heart tissues.\nFor the first time, our study confirmed that C. lanatus seeds (Cl.EtOH) possess significant antihypertensive and prevent ISO-induced myocardial infarction. These findings comprehensively demonstrated mechanistic insights of Cl.EtOH in vasorelaxation and myocardial infarction.

{"title": "Modelling the interaction between stem cells derived cardiomyocytes patches and host myocardium to aid non-arrhythmic engineered heart tissue design.", "abstract": "Application of epicardial patches constructed from human-induced pluripotent stem cell- derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has been proposed as a long-term therapy to treat scarred hearts post myocardial infarction (MI). Understanding electrical interaction between engineered heart tissue patches (EHT) and host myocardium represents a key step toward a successful patch engraftment. EHT retain different electrical properties with respect to the host heart tissue due to the hiPSC-CMs immature phenotype, which may lead to increased arrhythmia risk. We developed a modelling framework to examine the influence of patch design on electrical activation at the engraftment site. We performed an in silico investigation of different patch design approaches to restore pre-MI activation properties and evaluated the associated arrhythmic risk. We developed an in silico cardiac electrophysiology model of a transmural cross section of host myocardium. The model featured an infarct region, an epicardial patch spanning the infarct region and a bath region. The patch is modelled as a layer of hiPSC-CM, combined with a layer of conductive polymer (CP). Tissue and patch geometrical dimensions and conductivities were incorporated through 10 modifiable model parameters. We validated our model against 4 independent experimental studies and showed that it can qualitatively reproduce their findings. We performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to isolate the most important parameters, showing that the stimulus propagation is mainly governed by the scar depth, radius and conductivity when the scar is not transmural, and by the EHT patch conductivity when the scar is transmural. We assessed the relevance of small animal studies to humans by comparing simulations of rat, rabbit and human myocardium. We found that stimulus propagation paths and GSA sensitivity indices are consistent across species. We explored which EHT design variables have the potential to restore physiological propagation. Simulations predict that increasing EHT conductivity from 0.28 to 1-1.1 S/m recovered physiological activation in rat, rabbit and human. Finally, we assessed arrhythmia risk related to increasing EHT conductivity and tested increasing the EHT Na+ channel density as an alternative strategy to match healthy activation. Our results revealed a greater arrhythmia risk linked to increased EHT conductivity compared to increased Na+ channel density. We demonstrated that our modeling framework could capture the interaction between host and EHT patches observed in in vitro experiments. We showed that large (patch and tissue dimensions) and small (cardiac myocyte electrophysiology) scale differences between small animals and humans do not alter EHT patch effect on infarcted tissue. Our model revealed that only when the scar is transmural do EHT properties impact activation times and isolated the EHT conductivity as the main parameter influencing propagation. We predicted that restoring physiological activation by tuning EHT conductivity is possible but may promote arrhythmic behavior. Finally, our model suggests that acting on hiPSC-CMs low action potential upstroke velocity and lack of IK1 may restore pre-MI activation while not promoting arrhythmia.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2022-04-02", "authors": ["DamianoFassina", "Caroline MCosta", "StefanoLongobardi", "EliasKarabelas", "GernotPlank", "Sian EHarding", "Steven ANiederer"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010030\n10.1136/bmj.d8059\n10.1016/j.cjca.2014.08.027\n10.1001/jamacardio.2018.0522\n10.2217/rme.11.122\n10.1089/ars.2020.8193\n10.1186/s13287-019-1471-y\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.08.003\n10.1038/s41598-017-00046-6\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.07.138\n10.1038/s42003-017-0004-4\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3004631\n10.1155/2011/497841\n10.1038/s41569-018-0104-y\n10.9734/jsrr/2018/35182\n10.1152/ajpheart.1978.234.2.H123\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.01.023\n10.1172/jci.insight.144068\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306985\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.03.040\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0132\n10.4137/CMC.S39708\n10.1016/j.mbs.2019.108228\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00001\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2019.03.027\n10.1126/sciadv.1601007\n10.1002/adhm.201900053\n10.7150/thno.22599\n10.1529/biophysj.106.98160\n10.1113/expphysiol.2007.041871\n10.1152/ajpheart.00794.2003\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00001\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.07.012\n10.1161/01.res.44.5.701\n10.1007/s10439-012-0593-5\n10.1161/01.res.42.6.757\n10.1007/BF00788279\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.07.005\n10.1161/01.res.56.3.436\n10.1161/01.cir.72.3.596\n10.1152/ajpheart.00437.2005\n10.1063/1.4812236\n10.1021/jp802941m\n10.22489/CinC.2018.086\n10.1098/rsfs.2019.0124rsfs20190124\n10.1098/rsta.2019.0334\n10.1145/2786984.2786995\n10.1016/S0378-4754(00)00270-6\n10.1016/j.cpc.2009.09.018\n10.1016/s0002-8703(05)80230-3\n10.1161/01.res.41.1.9\n10.1161/01.res.87.10.922\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.03.004\n10.1002/term.525\n10.1016/j.bpj.2008.10.026\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0466\n10.1016/j.bpj.2019.08.040\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2096425\n10.1007/BF02442253\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.09.003\n10.1093/cvr/cvz161\n10.1177/1179546816686061\n10.1111/bph.14104\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.827691\n10.1093/cvr/cvs107\n10.1093/cvr/cvn290\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182588b00.Improving\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1038/s41467-020-20168-2\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1253/circj.CJ-12-0987\n10.1038/ncomms10312\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.12.052\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042\n10.1161/01.res.86.3.302\n10.1161/CIRCEP.108.785352\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1007/s10439-013-0833-3\n10.3390/ijms18091873\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.09.061\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.10.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.00694.2011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1007/s11538-018-0516-1"}
{"title": "Therapeutic application of chick early amniotic fluid: effective rescue of acute myocardial ischemic injury by intravenous administration.", "abstract": "Myocardial regeneration has been considered a promising option for the treatment of adult myocardial injuries. Previously, a chick early amniotic fluid (ceAF) preparation was shown to contain growth-related factors that promoted embryonic growth and cellular proliferation, though the nature of the components within ceAF were not fully defined. Here we tested whether this ceAF preparation is similarly effective in the promotion of myocardial regeneration, which could provide an alternative therapeutic for intervening myocardial injury. In this study, a myocardial ischemic injury model was established in adult mice and pigs by multiple research entities, and we were able to show that ceAF can efficiently rescue damaged cardiac tissues and markedly improve cardiac function in both experimental models through intravenous administration. ceAF administration increased cell proliferation and improved angiogenesis, likely via down-regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling.

However, the clinical application of DOX has been limited by adverse reactions such as cardiotoxicity and heart failure. Since DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is irreversible, drugs to prevent DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are needed.\nThis study aimed to investigate the effect of total flavonoids of Selaginella tamariscina (P.Beauv.) Spring (TFST) on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.\nThe present study established DOX-induced cardiotoxicity models in C57BL/6 mice treated with DOX (cumulative dose: 20\u00a0mg/kg body weight) and H9c2 cells incubated with DOX (1 \u03bcM/l) to explore the intervention effect and potential mechanism of TFST. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate left ventricular functions. Heart tissue samples were collected for histological evaluation. Myocardial injury markers and oxidative stress markers were examined. Mitochondrial energy metabolism pathway associated proteins PPAR\u03b1/PGC-1\u03b1/Sirt3 were detected. We also explored the effects of TFST on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis. To further investigate the protective mechanism of TFST, we used the specific small interfering RNA MFN2 (siMFN2) to explore the effect of MFN2 on TFST against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in vitro. Flow cytometry detected reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. Cell mitochondrial stress was measured by Seahorse XF analyser.\nBoth in vivo and in vitro studies verified that TFST observably alleviated DOX-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. However, these effects were reversed after transfected siMFN2.\nOur results indicated that TFST ameliorates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress by activating MFN2/PERK.

{"title": "YAP1 induces hyperglycemic stress-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in an AKT-FOXM1 dependent signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Cardiac disease is one of the most common complications associated with diabetes. Cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis often lead to structural and functional abnormalities leading to risks of heart failure. Several regulatory molecules related to major signaling pathways have been found to overexpress in different tissues during diabetes which show very low level of expression in non-diabetic condition. YAP1 and FOXM1 are recently being reported to play important role in various hypertrophic and fibrotic disorders. But, very limited information is still known regarding their roles in cardiomyopathies especially in the context of diabetes and hyperglycemic stress. YAP1 is known to be associated with AKT- GSK3\u03b2 signaling that is one of the important regulatory pathways in glucose and lipid metabolism. On the other hand, the expression of FOXM1 has been found to be significantly upregulated in adult lung tissue with induction of fibrosis but little is known about their role in cardiac diseases. In our study, YAP1 and FOXM1 have been found to overexpress in cardiac tissue under hyperglycemic condition leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased fibrotic response. Further YAP1 inhibition has resulted in a reduced expression of FOXM1 pointing to a possible association of YAP1 and FOXM1 in high glucose-stressed cardiomyocyte. As mechanism we have found that YAP1 undergoes reduced ser127 phosphorylation as well as extensive O-GlcNAcylation mediated activation under hyperglycemia. Upregulated YAP1 further acts through increased AKT phosphorylation causing inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 that in turn results in increased FOXM1 expression, leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis.", "journal": "Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2022-04-01", "authors": ["ArunimaMondal", "ShreyaDas", "JayeetaSamanta", "SantanuChakraborty", "ArunimaSengupta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2022.109198"}

Changes in cardiomyocytes strongly affect the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This work aimed to investigate the biological function and potential mechanism of action of miR-150-5p in cardiomyocytes.\nA myocardial ischemia (MI) injury rat model was constructed to detect miR-150-5p and tetratricopeptide repeat domain 5 (TTC5) expression during heart ischemia injury. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated for in vitro study. CCK-8 assays were used to detect cardiomyocyte viability. Western blots were used to detect TTC5 and P53 expression. qPCR was utilized to measure RNA expression of miR-150-5p and TTC5. The TUNEL assay was used to determine cell apoptosis. ELISA was used to determine cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8) levels in heart tissues and cell culture supernatants. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was carried out to verify the binding ability between miR-150-5p and TTC5. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment significantly inhibited cell viability. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD)-mediated uptake of miR-150-5p inverted these results. Additionally, UTMD-mediated uptake of miR-150-5p retarded the effects of OGD treatment on cell apoptosis. Besides, UTMD-mediated uptake of miR-150-5p counteracted the effects of OGD treatment on the inflammatory response by regulating cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8) levels. For the mechanism of the protective effect on the heart, we predicted and confirmed that miR-150-5p bound to TTC5 and inhibited TTC5 expression.\nUTMD-mediated uptake of miR-150-5p attenuated OGD-induced primary cardiomyocyte injury by inhibiting TTC5 expression.

{"title": "Protective effects of cordycepin against d-galactose-induced aging in rats: A view from the heart.", "abstract": "Aging is a critical contributing factor for cardiovascular diseases. The d-galactose-induced accelerated aging model is comparable to physiological aging from the cellular to the physiological level. The d-galactose treatment induces mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and upregulation of senescence-related genes. Cordycepin, a functional element in Chinese traditional medicine, has multiple beneficial effects as an antioxidant and ROS scavenger, and has been reported to be effective in a number of ischemia models. This paper aims to investigate the cardioprotective effects of cordycepin in the d-galactose accelerated aging model.\nIn the current study, we employed the d-galactose accelerated aging model to study the cardioprotective effect of cordycepin. Eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats, randomly divided into five groups, were given vehicle, d-galactose (150\u2009mg/kg/day), and cordycepin at 5, 10, and 20\u00a0mg/kg per day. At the end of the 8-week treatment, rat cardiac structure and function were assessed with echocardiographic imaging and hemodynamic parameter analysis.\nCordycepin upregulated the expression of Klotho in serum and heart tissues. The expressions of senescence markers \u03b2-galactosidase, p21, and oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) were downregulated by cordycepin treatment. Reduction of levels and activity of the antioxidant factors superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) induced by by d-galactose treatment was ameliorated by cordycepin. Furthermore, cordycepin activated AMPK signaling in d-galactose-treated rats. After 8\u2009weeks of treatment, we found that cordycepin improved myocardia contractility and hypertension caused by d-galactose treatment. Mechanistically, reduced expression of the Klotho protein SOD1 caused by d-galactose was recovered in rats co-treated with cordycepin.\nCordycepin could protect against cardiac dysfunction in a d-galactose-induced aging rat model, suggesting the therapeutic cardioprotective potential of cordycepin in aging.

GNAS variants with inactivating properties are associated with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) and when maternally inherited, pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a (OMIM#103580), which includes multiple hormone resistance. In this clinical report we describe a novel GNAS variant, c.159A>G, p.K53N, in an individual with features consistent with AHO and pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a and its segregation through multiple maternal relatives, including two genotype positive maternal first cousins who also display features classic for AHO. The proband developed unique features including cardiomyopathy which required a heart transplant at 5\u2009years old and immune dysregulation resulting in multisystem organ failure and ultimately, death at the age of 18\u2009years. Additional investigations exploring alternative explanations for the proband's presentation were pursued including whole genome sequencing which was negative. We postulate that the atypical features seen in the proband may have resulted from dysregulated Gs\u03b1 signaling in cardiac tissue.

In this study, we propose to find candidate biomarkers from endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and peripheral blood (PB) samples for efficient diagnosis and treatment of cardiac allograft rejection. MATERIAL AND METHODS Microarray datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of cardiac allograft rejection patients and control subjects from EMB and PB samples were screened using the online tool GEO2R. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of all samples' DEGs were performed with the DAVID online tool. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed and visualized using Cytoscape and the top 10 hub genes were selected. Finally, the most highly enriched GO and KEGG pathways of the top 10 hub genes were determined. RESULTS A total of 57 502 genes from EMB samples and 131 624 genes from PB samples were identified. Gene characteristics and enrichment analysis indicated that both EMB and PB samples contained DEGs involved in antigen presentation, immune cells activation, inflammatory process, and cellular injuries. In EMB samples, there were some DEGs related to heart tissue injury and cardiac malfunction. Moreover, DEGs that regulates hypoxia-induced factors and erythrocyte function in response of ischemia and hypoxia stress were present in PB samples but were absent in EMB samples.

{"title": "Effects of caloric overload before caloric restriction in the murine heart.", "abstract": "The beneficial effects of caloric restriction (CR) against cardiac aging and for prevention of cardiovascular diseases are numerous. However, to our knowledge, there is no scientific evidence about how a high-calorie diet (HCD) background influences the mechanisms underlying CR in whole heart tissue (WHT) in experimental murine models. In the current study, CR-treated mice with different alimentary backgrounds were subjected to transthoracic echocardiographic measurements. WHT was then analyzed to determine cardiac energetics, telomerase activity, the expression of energy-sensing networks, tissue-specific adiponectin, and cardiac precursor/cardiac stem cell markers. Animals with a balanced diet consumption before CR presented marked cardiac remodeling with improved ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), enhanced OXPHOS complex I, III, and IV, and CKMT2 enzymatic activity. Mice fed an HCD before CR presented moderate changes in cardiac geometry with diminished EF and FS values, but improved OXPHOS complex IV and CKMT2 activity. Differences in cardiac remodeling, left ventricular systolic/diastolic performance, and mitochondrial energetics, found in the CR-treated mice with contrasting alimentary backgrounds, were corroborated by inconsistencies in the expression of mitochondrial-biogenesis-related markers and associated regulatory networks. In particular, disruption of eNOS and AMPK -PGC-1\u03b1-mTOR-related axes. The impact of a past habit of caloric overload on the effects of CR in the WHT is a scarcely explored subject that requires deeper study in combination with analyses of other tissues and organs at higher levels of organization within the organ system.

Understanding accurately how multi-omics molecular features change at the early stage of AMI is crucial for its treatment. Currently, the changes involved in DNA methylation modification and gene expression of multiple genes have remained unexplored.\nWe used the RNA-seq and MeDIP-seq on heart tissues from AMI mouse models at series of time points (Sham, AMI 10-min, 1-h, 6-h, 24-h and 72-h), to comprehensively describe the transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylation changes at above time points.

Remarkably, the 6-h AMI with the drastic changes of DEGs and a large number of enriched functional pathways in KEGG may be the most critical stage of AMI process.

{"title": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy: a global effort to find the cause and cure for the rare and little understood disease.", "abstract": "In this review, we present our current understanding of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) based on reports of the incidence, diagnosis and current treatment options. We summarise opinions on whether PPCM is triggered by vascular and/or hormonal causes and examine the influence of comorbidities such as preeclampsia. Two articles published in 2021 strongly support the hypothesis that PPCM may be a familial disease. Using large cohorts of PPCM patients, they summarised the available genomic DNA sequence data that are expressed in human cardiomyocytes. While PPCM is considered a disease predominately affecting the left ventricle, there are data to suggest that some cases also involve right ventricular failure. Finally, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to warrant an RNAseq investigation and that this would be most informative if performed at the cardiomyocytes level rather than analysing genomic DNA from the peripheral circulation.

{"title": "CircRNA CDR1as promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis through activating hippo signaling pathway in diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), as a major complication of diabetic patients, can cause myocardial metabolic remodeling and lead to severe and irreversible cardiac dysfunction. Previously, we found that the circular RNA cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 antisense (Circ-CDR1as) independently predicted acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and might be a new indicator marker for this. However, CDR1as was not clearly described in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, our purpose was to deeply explore the function of CDR1as in DCM. In this study, we found that CDR1as was upregulated in DCM, and knockdown of CDR1as could improve the apoptosis caused by DCM. Mechanistically, CDR1as activates the Hippo signaling pathway by significantly inhibiting Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) ubiquitination level. Furthermore, as a transcriptional factor of CDR1as, Forkhead box group O3a (FOXO3) was identified to activate the Hippo signaling pathway. Notably, the total m6A level was downregulated in the cardiac tissue of DCM. Alk B homolog 5 (ALKBH5), a m6A demethylation enzyme, was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes of DCM mice and posttranscriptionally activated FOXO3 by m6A demethylation in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner. Hence, our work reveals the key function of the ALKBH5-FOXO3-CDR1as/Hippo signaling pathway in DCM and provides insight into the critical roles of m6A methylation in DCM.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2022-03-28", "authors": ["YingchunShao", "MengmengLi", "QiYu", "ManyuGong", "YanyingWang", "XuewenYang", "LihengLiu", "DongpingLiu", "ZhongyueTan", "YuanyuanZhang", "YunmengQu", "HaodongLi", "YaqiWang", "LeiJiao", "YingZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.174915"}

This review presents an overview of alginate-based materials used for developing innovative biomaterial platforms for biomedical applications to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus. As presented in this review, COVID-19 affects the cardiovascular system, not only the lungs. The first part of the review presents an introduction to cardiovascular diseases and describes how they have become an important problem worldwide. In the second part of the review, the origin and unique properties of the alginate biopolymer are presented. Among the properties of alginate, the most important are its biocompatibility, biodegradability, low cost, nontoxicity, unique structure, and interesting features after chemical modification. The third section of the review illustrates some of the functions of alginate in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and drug delivery applications. Researchers are using alginate to develop new devices and materials for repairing heart tissues that have been damaged by the coronavirus.

Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the development of myocardial remodeling. When thioredoxin (Trx), an endogenous anti-oxidative and inflammatory modulator with a molecular weight of 12 kDa, is exogenously administered, it disappears rapidly from the blood circulation. In this study, we prepared a long-acting Trx, by fusing human Trx (HSA-Trx) with human serum albumin (HSA) and evaluated its efficacy in treating drug-induced heart failure. Drug-induced cardiomyopathy was created by intraperitoneally administering doxorubicin (Dox) to mice three times per week. A decrease in heart weight, increased myocardial fibrosis and markers for myocardial damage that were observed in the Dox group were suppressed by HSA-Trx administration. HSA-Trx also suppressed the expression of atrogin-1 and myostatin, myocardial atrophy factors in addition to suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation. In the Dox group, a decreased expression of endogenous Trx in cardiac tissue and an increased expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor were observed, but these changes were restored to normal levels by HSA-Trx administration.

{"title": "A New Decellularization Protocol of Porcine Aortic Valves Using Tergitol to Characterize the Scaffold with the Biocompatibility Profile Using Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells.", "abstract": "The most common aortic valve diseases in adults are stenosis due to calcification and regurgitation. In pediatric patients, aortic pathologies are less common. When a native valve is surgically replaced by a prosthetic one, it is necessary to consider that the latter has a limited durability. In particular, current bioprosthetic valves have to be replaced after approximately 10 years; mechanical prostheses are more durable but require the administration of permanent anticoagulant therapy. With regard to pediatric patients, both mechanical and biological prosthetic valves have to be replaced due to their inability to follow patients' growth. An alternative surgical substitute can be represented by the acellular porcine aortic valve that exhibits less immunogenic risk and a longer lifespan. In the present study, an efficient protocol for the removal of cells by using detergents, enzyme inhibitors, and hyper- and hypotonic shocks is reported. A new detergent (Tergitol) was applied to replace TX-100 with the aim to reduce toxicity and maximize ECM preservation. The structural integrity and efficient removal of cells and nuclear components were assessed by means of histology, immunofluorescence, and protein quantification; biomechanical properties were also checked by tensile tests.

{"title": "Cardiac remodelling\u00a0-\u00a0Part 1: From cells and tissues to circulating biomarkers. A review from the Study Group on Biomarkers of the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology.", "abstract": "Cardiac remodelling refers to changes in left ventricular structure and function over time, with a progressive deterioration that may lead to heart failure (HF) development (adverse remodelling) or vice versa a recovery (reverse remodelling) in response to HF treatment. Adverse remodelling predicts a worse outcome, whilst reverse remodelling predicts a better prognosis. The geometry, systolic and diastolic function and electric activity of the left ventricle are affected, as well as the left atrium and on the long term even right heart chambers. At a cellular and molecular level, remodelling involves all components of cardiac tissue: cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and leucocytes. The molecular, cellular and histological signatures of remodelling may differ according to the cause and severity of cardiac damage, and clearly to the global trend toward worsening or recovery. These processes cannot be routinely evaluated through endomyocardial biopsies, but may be reflected by circulating levels of several biomarkers. Different classes of biomarkers (e.g. proteins, non-coding RNAs, metabolites and/or epigenetic modifications) and several biomarkers of each class might inform on some aspects on HF development, progression and long-term outcomes, but most have failed to enter clinical practice. This may be due to the biological complexity of remodelling, so that no single biomarker could provide great insight on remodelling when assessed alone. Another possible reason is a still incomplete understanding of the role of biomarkers in the pathophysiology of cardiac remodelling. Such role will be investigated in the first part of this review paper on biomarkers of cardiac remodelling.", "journal": "European journal of heart failure", "date": "2022-03-26", "authors": ["ArantxaGonz\u00e1lez", "A MarkRichards", "Rudolf Ade Boer", "ThomasThum", "HenrikeArfsten", "MartinH\u00fclsmann", "In\u00easFalcao-Pires", "JavierD\u00edez", "Roger S YFoo", "Mark YChan", "AlbertoAimo", "Chukwuemeka GAnene-Nzelu", "MagdyAbdelhamid", "StamatisAdamopoulos", "Stefan DAnker", "YuriBelenkov", "TuviaBen Gal", "AlainCohen-Solal", "MichaelB\u00f6hm", "OvidiuChioncel", "VictoriaDelgado", "MicheleEmdin", "Ewa AJankowska", "FinnGustafsson", "LoreenaHill", "TinyJaarsma", "James LJanuzzi", "Pardeep SJhund", "YuriLopatin", "Lars HLund", "MarcoMetra", "DavorMilicic", "BrendaMoura", "ChristianMueller", "WilfriedMullens", "JulioN\u00fa\u00f1ez", "Massimo FPiepoli", "AminaRakisheva", "Arsen DRisti\u0107", "PatrickRossignol", "GianluigiSavarese", "Carlo GTocchetti", "SophieVan Linthout", "MaurizioVolterrani", "PetarSeferovic", "GiuseppeRosano", "Andrew J SCoats", "AntoniBay\u00e9s-Gen\u00eds"], "doi": "10.1002/ejhf.2493"}
{"title": "Knockdown of lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein-1 ameliorates alcoholic cardiomyopathy via inactivating the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.", "abstract": "LOX-1 triggers myocardial fibrosis, but its roles and mechanisms in alcoholic cardiomyopathy and the involvement of the downstream signaling pathways had not been fully reported. We planned to explore how LOX-1 facilitated myocardial fibrosis in alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The in vitro and in vivo alcoholic cardiomyopathy model was established by alcohol treatment to rats' cardiac fibroblasts and rats, respectively. Masson staining was conducted to observe the collagen deposition and the IHC assay was executed to evaluate the contents of collagen I and III in vitro and in vivo. The cardiac tissues were also observed under TEM and the cardiac function of rats was evaluated using UCG. The expression levels of LOX-1 and P38MAPK in cardiac fibroblasts and tissues at both mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blot, respectively. Alcohol treatment could trigger collagen deposition, cell hypertrophy, fibrotic changes and increased the expression levels of LOX-1 and P38MAPK both in vivo and in vitro. It also deteriorated the cardiac function of rats in vivo. Overexpression of LOX-1 in vitro could aggravate the fibrotic changes while knockdown of LOX-1 ameliorated the fibrotic effects of alcohol treatment both in vitro and in vivo such as reduction of collagen deposition, relief of cell hypertrophy and inactivation of the P38MAPK signaling pathway. We concluded that knockdown of LOX-1 exerted anti-fibrotic effects via inhibiting P38MAPK signaling in alcoholic cardiomyopathy both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlighted that LOX-1 could become a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Bioengineered", "date": "2022-03-26", "authors": ["YifanZhang", "RuiqiZhang", "LanLu", "NaZhou", "XiaoyanLv", "XinWang", "ZhanbinFeng"], "doi": "10.1080/21655979.2022.2056814"}
{"title": "Human Neurons Form Axon-Mediated Functional Connections with Human Cardiomyocytes in Compartmentalized Microfluidic Chip.", "abstract": "The cardiac autonomic nervous system (cANS) regulates cardiac function by innervating cardiac tissue with axons, and cardiomyocytes (CMs) and neurons undergo comaturation during the heart innervation in embryogenesis. As cANS is essential for cardiac function, its dysfunctions might be fatal; therefore, cardiac innervation models for studying embryogenesis, cardiac diseases, and drug screening are needed. However, previously reported neuron-cardiomyocyte (CM) coculture chips lack studies of functional neuron-CM interactions with completely human-based cell models. Here, we present a novel completely human cell-based and electrophysiologically functional cardiac innervation on a chip in which a compartmentalized microfluidic device, a 3D3C chip, was used to coculture human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons and CMs. The 3D3C chip enabled the coculture of both cell types with their respective culture media in their own compartments while allowing the neuronal axons to traverse between the compartments via microtunnels connecting the compartments. Furthermore, the 3D3C chip allowed the use of diverse analysis methods, including immunocytochemistry, RT-qPCR and video microscopy. This system resembled the in vivo axon-mediated neuron-CM interaction. In this study, the evaluation of the CM beating response during chemical stimulation of neurons showed that hiPSC-neurons and hiPSC-CMs formed electrophysiologically functional axon-mediated interactions.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-03-26", "authors": ["MarttaH\u00e4kli", "SatuJ\u00e4ntti", "TiinaJoki", "LassiSukki", "KaisaTornberg", "KatriinaAalto-Set\u00e4l\u00e4", "PasiKallio", "MariPekkanen-Mattila", "SusannaNarkilahti"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23063148\n10.3390/jcdd3030028\n10.1113/JP271840\n10.4161/org.24892\n10.1016/j.jchf.2015.01.008\n10.1002/ejhf.921\n10.1002/adhm.201701000\n10.1002/sctm.19-0340\n10.1093/cvr/cvab088\n10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101710\n10.1039/c0lc00327a\n10.1039/C5IB00273G\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.065\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148559\n10.1152/ajpheart.00546.2020\n10.1038/s41598-020-66303-3\n10.1016/j.bcp.2013.08.006\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.02.011\n10.1038/s41598-019-53647-8\n10.1242/bio.035030\n10.1016/j.scr.2021.102176\n10.1088/1361-6439/ab16a7\n10.1002/admi.202100048\n10.1261/rna.2386111\n10.3390/ijms21228726\n10.1111/febs.15771\n10.1186/s12864-020-6754-2\n10.1016/j.mee.2018.11.001\n10.1038/ncomms14346\n10.1016/j.ceb.2012.06.005\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.02.056\n10.3390/ma12111805\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109254\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112553\n10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01040\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.05.002\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.07.024\n10.1002/cpz1.244\n10.1016/j.scr.2018.01.018\n10.3390/mi11050497\n10.3390/ijms20153773\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048659\n10.1186/s13287-017-0738-4\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312067"}

{"title": "Beneficial Effects of Dietary Nitrite on a Model of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Induced by High-Fat/High-Cholesterol Diets in SHRSP5/Dmcr Rats: A Preliminary Study.", "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease that leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Endothelial dysfunction caused by hepatic lipotoxicity is an underlying NASH pathology observed in the liver and the cardiovascular system. Here, we evaluated the effect of dietary nitrite on a rat NASH model. Stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive 5/Dmcr rats were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet to develop the NASH model, with nitrite or captopril (100 mg/L, each) supplementation in drinking water for 8 weeks. The effects of nitrite and captopril were evaluated using immunohistochemical analyses of the liver and heart tissues. Dietary nitrite suppressed liver fibrosis in the rats by reducing oxidative stress, as measured using the protein levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase components and inflammatory cell accumulation in the liver. Nitrite lowered the blood pressure in hypertensive NASH rats and suppressed left ventricular chamber enlargement. Similar therapeutic effects were observed in a captopril-treated rat NASH model, suggesting the possibility of a common signaling pathway through which nitrite and captopril improve NASH pathology. In conclusion, dietary nitrite attenuates the development of NASH with cardiovascular involvement in rats and provides an alternative NASH therapeutic strategy.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-03-26", "authors": ["KunihiroSonoda", "YukaKono", "KazuyaKitamori", "KazuoOhtake", "SachikoShiba", "KeizoKasono", "JunKobayashi"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23062931\n10.1111/jgh.12271\n10.1111/iep.12301\n10.1073/pnas.1809406115\n10.1016/j.abb.2021.109032\n10.1038/nrgastro.2013.183\n10.1007/s12199-011-0235-9\n10.1111/iep.12169\n10.5551/jat.40956\n10.1002/hep.32294\n10.1038/oby.2007.114\n10.3390/nu7064911\n10.1124/pr.120.019240\n10.1016/j.niox.2021.08.001\n10.1007/s10620-017-4550-x\n10.2337/diacare.26.7.2081\n10.1073/pnas.1821045116\n10.1016/j.niox.2011.07.001\n10.1016/j.jhep.2010.02.005\n10.1038/nrgastro.2017.38\n10.1016/j.addr.2017.05.007\n10.1053/gast.2001.25480\n10.1016/S0168-8278(02)00307-0\n10.1002/hep.20420\n10.1152/ajprenal.00580.2007\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68074-4\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00471-6\n10.1016/j.niox.2017.04.009\n10.1161/01.CIR.89.5.2273\n10.1038/s41440-018-0040-6\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0701836\n10.1161/01.HYP.31.1.342\n10.1161/01.RES.83.7.743\n10.1210/me.2004-0536\n10.1016/j.niox.2010.10.003\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00037-7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.033\n10.1016/j.jphs.2015.09.002\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1311\n10.2119/molmed.2014.00048\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.10.011\n10.1073/pnas.0706579104\n10.1289/ehp.99107583\n10.1016/j.niox.2017.06.001\n10.1111/bcp.12918\n10.17554/j.issn.2224-3992.2019.08.829\n10.1007/s12576-015-0380-9\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00467.2015\n10.1016/j.etap.2006.07.007\n10.1016/j.taap.2010.11.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0145939\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.6.H2902\n10.1016/j.niox.2007.06.004\n10.1016/j.niox.2010.04.004"}
{"title": "Influence of Obesity on Histological Tissue Structure of the Cardiovascular System in Horses.", "abstract": "It has been well established that obesity in horses can have a negative impact on their health, including endocrine disturbances. In humans, it is well known that obesity leads to structural and functional changes of the cardiovascular system. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of obesity on the histological structure of the myocardial tissue, as well as great and peripheral arteries in horses. The heart, arteries (aorta, pulmonary artery and palmar arteries) specimens from 7 horses with normal BCS (4-5/9) and 12 extremely obese (BCS 9/9) draft slaughter horses were obtained for histopathological evaluation. The heart tissue and great arteries showed more intense disturbances in the architecture and vacuolization in the aorta in obese horses as compared to the healthy group. The intima in the pulmonary artery, coronary arteries and palmar arteries was thicker in the obese, rather than healthy horses. The palmar arteries in obese horses had a larger lumen diameter and the lumen-to-total diameter ratio as compared to the control group. The presented study showed a significant effect of obesity on the heart as well as the central and peripheral vessels in horses.

{"title": "Calcium Channels in the Heart: Disease States and Drugs.", "abstract": "Calcium ions are the major signaling ions in the cells. They regulate muscle contraction, neurotransmitter secretion, cell growth and migration, and the activity of several proteins including enzymes and ion channels and transporters. They participate in various signal transduction pathways, thereby regulating major physiological functions. Calcium ion entry into the cells is regulated by specific calcium channels and transporters. There are mainly six types of calcium channels, of which only two are prominent in the heart. In cardiac tissues, the two types of calcium channels are the L type and the T type. L-type channels are found in all cardiac cells and T-type are expressed in Purkinje cells, pacemaker and atrial cells. Both these types of channels contribute to atrioventricular conduction as well as pacemaker activity. Given the crucial role of calcium channels in the cardiac conduction system, mutations and dysfunctions of these channels are known to cause several diseases and disorders. Drugs targeting calcium channels hence are used in a wide variety of cardiac disorders including but not limited to hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias. This review summarizes the type of cardiac calcium channels, their function, and disorders caused by their mutations and dysfunctions.

Empagliflozin, an anti-diabetes drug, may also protect mitochondria. We explored whether empagliflozin could reduce cardiac microvascular I/R injury by enhancing mitophagy. In mice, I/R injury induced luminal stenosis, microvessel wall damage, erythrocyte accumulation and perfusion defects in the myocardial microcirculation. Additionally, I/R triggered endothelial hyperpermeability and myocardial neutrophil infiltration, which upregulated adhesive factors and endothelin-1 but downregulated vascular endothelial cadherin and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in heart tissue. In vitro, I/R impaired the endothelial barrier function and integrity of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs), while empagliflozin preserved CMEC homeostasis and thus maintained cardiac microvascular structure and function. I/R activated mitochondrial fission, oxidative stress and apoptotic signaling in CMECs, whereas empagliflozin normalized mitochondrial fission and fusion, neutralized supraphysiologic reactive oxygen species concentrations and suppressed mitochondrial apoptosis. Empagliflozin exerted these protective effects by activating FUNDC1-dependent mitophagy through the AMPK\u03b11/ULK1 pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo, genetic ablation of AMPK\u03b11 or FUNDC1 abolished the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on the myocardial microvasculature and CMECs. Taken together, the preservation of mitochondrial function through an activation of the AMPK\u03b11/ULK1/FUNDC1/mitophagy pathway is the working mechanism of empagliflozin in attenuating cardiac microvascular I/R injury.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2022-03-25", "authors": ["ChenCai", "ZhongzhouGuo", "XingChang", "ZiyingLi", "FengWu", "JingHe", "TiantianCao", "KangrongWang", "NengxianShi", "HaoZhou", "SamToan", "DavidMuid", "YingTan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2022.102288"}

{"title": "Astaxanthin attenuates cardiovascular dysfunction associated with deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-induced hypertension in rats.", "abstract": "Hypertension is a major global health problem. It is a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease. One of the most used experimental models in studying antihypertensive action is the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rat. This study aimed to investigate the cardiovascular protective effect of astaxanthin (ASX) in DOCA-salt-induced hypertension and its possible underlying mechanisms.\nA total of 48 adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups: control, DOCA, and DOCA + ASX. Blood pressure, serum cardiac enzyme levels, some oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarker levels, and lipid profile levels were measured. The weight of the left ventricle to tibial length ratio was calculated. Apoptosis detection and total genomic DNA extraction in aortic and cardiac tissues were investigated. The apoptotic marker BAX was also immunohistochemically assessed in the heart and aorta.\nCompared to the control group, the DOCA group was associated with a significant increase in blood pressure, serum cardiac enzyme levels, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarker levels, lipid profile except serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL), weight of the left ventricle to tibial length, and total released DNA fragmentation level of the left ventricle and aorta and a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) and HDL. Compared to the DOCA group, the DOCA + ASX group significantly improved the DOCA-induced changes.\nASX has beneficial protective effects on DOCA-salt-induced hypertension via DNA fragmentation protection, apoptosis inhibition, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and its effects on lipid levels.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)", "date": "2022-03-25", "authors": ["Suzan AKhodir", "EmanSweed", "MarwaGadallah", "AnwaarShabaan"], "doi": "10.1080/10641963.2022.2055764"}

{"title": "Folic acid alleviates lead acetate-mediated cardiotoxicity by down-regulating the expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, GRP78, and CHOP proteins.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the interventional effects of folic acid on the heart damage caused by lead acetate exposure. Twenty-four 60-day-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 4 groups with 6 rats in each group. The control group (C group) was normal rats; the lead exposure group (L group) rats drank 0.2% lead acetate solution freely for 14\u00a0days. The rats in the intervention group (T group) were given 0.2% lead acetate solution for 14\u00a0days, respectively, and 0.4\u00a0mg/kg BW folic acid solution was given to the rats by gavage on the 7th day of lead administration. The rats in the folic acid group (group E) were given 0.4\u00a0mg/kg BW folic acid solution by gavage. To weigh rat body weight and heart weight, calculate heart index, and observe the expression level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1(HO-1), glucose-regulated protein 78/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) by immunofluorescence method. The results showed that compared with group C, serum lead levels in group L and T were significantly increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05); superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) levels in group L were significantly decreased (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly higher increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the GSH-PX content in group T were significantly increased in group L (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the MDA content in group T was significantly lower than that in group L (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared with group C, the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, GRP78, and CHOP in group L increased significantly, and the difference was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared with the L group, the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, GRP78, and CHOP in the T group was reduced. Therefore, folic acid has a certain protective effect on the oxidative damage of lead-exposed rat heart tissue. Lead exposure will increase ROS, NO, MDA, and other oxidizing substances and reduce the level of GSH, SOD, CAT, GPx, and other antioxidant factors, which will lead to cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac index increase, oxidative stress, Nrf2, and HO-1. The expression of stress-related proteins such as GRP78 and CHOP also increased, leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis. After a folic acid intervention, these changes can be significantly reversed.", "journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "date": "2022-03-25", "authors": ["NingLi", "YaliZhao", "FangyuWang", "LianjunSong", "MingwuQiao", "TianlinWang", "XianqingHuang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11356-022-19821-8\n10.1371/journal.pone.0158965\n10.1080/13880209.2017.1299768\n10.1538/expanim.20-0075\n10.1007/s11033-020-05346-1\n10.1124/jpet.110.170084\n10.1152/ajpheart.01378.2005\n10.1080/01480545.2018.1429460\n10.1007/s004200100231\n10.14735/amko20164S25\n10.1536/ihj.20-593\n10.1007/s11356-021-13725-9\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226803\n10.1007/s11010-006-9381-6\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111324\n10.1093/aob/mcl128\n10.2147/IJN.S185259\n10.1006/scdb.1999.0318\n10.1016/j.ntt.2010.10.001\n10.1016/s1043-6618(02)00095-6\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2009.09.014\n10.3748/wjg.v10.i12.1699\n10.3390/nu5083235\n10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00543-3\n10.1101/gad.13.10.1211\n10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.46.120604.141046\n10.1007/s12012-010-9094-7\n10.1007/s12640-019-00119-6\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2004.10.010\n10.1080/07315724.2005.10719436\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041676\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.111917\n10.1016/j.neuro.2015.10.015\n10.26355/eurrev_201804_14750\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.208\n10.1038/nrc1505\n10.1002/tox.20648\n10.1007/s11356-016-7923-3\n10.1152/ajpheart.00904.2004\n10.1016/j.biocel.2014.11.013\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.10.026\n10.1152/ajpheart.91503.2007\n10.1007/s12011-017-1086-z\n10.1016/j.tiv.2009.07.020\n10.1089/ars.2010.3486\n10.1136/heartjnl-2018-314438\n10.1074/jbc.REV118.002804\n10.1186/1476-511X-9-35\n10.2147/IJN.S74306\n10.1177/0300060519842446\n10.4238/2015.October.16.13\n10.1016/j.neuro.2018.02.008\n10.1189/jlb.0104046\n10.1172/jci200216784\n10.1191/0960327103ht411oa\n10.1126/stke.2392004pe27\n10.1016/j.jtemb.2017.06.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243956\n10.1002/ejhf.1320\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00711.x\n10.1007/s10557-008-6109-8\n10.1186/s12967-021-02786-6\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.04.012\n10.1155/2016/2075915\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.108603\n10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00454.x\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109518"}

In order to clarify the changes in tissues of the lung, heart and liver by COVID-19, samples were taken from five patients who died of COVID-19 and five control cases, and the pathological changes in the lung, liver, and heart tissue were studied by X-ray, computed tomography, histological studies, and stereological analysis. The formation of hyaline membranes, alveolar wall edema, and fibrin exudate was seen on histological analysis of the lungs in the COVID-19 group. Stereological analysis illustrated the number of hepatocytes, volume of the sinusoid, and volume of the liver have been decreased, however the pathological changes in the heart tissue were not observed.

{"title": "MicroRNA-194-5p Attenuates Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by Targeting P21-Activated Kinase 2.", "abstract": "Many studies have reported that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the regulation of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. MiR-194-5p has been reported significantly upregulated in patients with myocardial infarction; however, its role in myocardial diseases is still unclear. Various stimuluses can trigger the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and it may activate the apoptosis signals eventually. This study aims to explore the regulatory role of miR-194-5p in DOX-induced ER stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\nH9c2 was treated with 2 \u03bcM DOX to induce apoptosis, which is to stimulate the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity model. The expression of miR-194-5p was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); the interaction between miR-194-5p and P21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) was tested by dual luciferase reporter assay; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and caspase-3/7 activity were used to assess apoptosis; trypan blue staining was applied to measure cell death; Western blotting was performed to detect protein expressions; and ER-related factors splicing X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) was detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence to verify the activation of ER stress.\nMiR-194-5p was upregulated in cardiomyocytes and mouse heart tissue with DOX treatment, while the protein level of PAK2 was downregulated. PAK2 was predicted as the target of miR-194-5p; hence, dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-194-5p directly interacted with PAK2 and inhibited its expression. TUNEL assay, caspase-3/7 activity test, and trypan blue stain results showed that either inhibition of miR-194-5p or overexpression of PAK2 reduced DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Silencing of miR-194-5p also improved DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction. In addition, DOX could induce ER stress in H9c2, which led to XBP1 and caspase-12 activation.

CCC afflicts millions of people, mostly in Latin America, and vaccine and effective therapy are still lacking. Comprehension of the host/parasite interplay in the chronic phase of T. cruzi infection may unveil targets for rational trait-based therapies to improve CCC prognosis. In the present viewpoint, I critically summarise a collection of data, obtained by our network of collaborators and other groups on CCC and preclinical studies on pathogenesis, targeting identification for intervention and the use of drugs with immunomodulatory properties to improve CCC. In the last two decades, models combining mouse lineages and T. cruzi strains allowed replication of crucial clinical, histopathological, and immunological traits of CCC. This condition includes conduction changes (heart rate changes, arrhythmias, atrioventricular blocks, prolongation of the QRS complex and PR and corrected QT intervals), ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, CD8-enriched myocarditis, tissue remodeling and progressive fibrosis, and systemic inflammatory profile, resembling \"cytokine storm\". Studies on Chagas' heart disease pathogenesis begins to unveil the molecular mechanisms underpinning the inflammation-related cardiac tissue damage, placing IFN\u03b3, TNF and NF\u03baB signaling as upstream regulators of miRNAs and mRNAs associated with critical biological pathways as cell migration, inflammation, tissue remodeling and fibrosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, data on preclinical trials using hypothesis-based tools, targeting parasite and inflammation-related alterations, opened paths for multi-therapeutic approaches in CCC. Despite the long path taken using experimental CD models replicating relevant aspects of CCC and testing new therapies and therapeutic schemes, these findings may get lost in translation, as conceptual and economical challenges, underpinning the valley of death across preclinical and clinical trials.

{"title": "Perspectives for Future Use of Cardiac Microtissues from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disorders remain a critical health issue worldwide. While animals have been used extensively as experimental models to investigate heart disease mechanisms and develop drugs, their inherent drawbacks have shifted focus to more human-relevant alternatives. Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and hiPSCs, collectively called hPSCs) have been identified as a source of different cardiac cells, but to date, they have rarely offered functional and structural maturity of the adult human heart. However, the combination of patient derived hPSCs with microphysiological tissue engineering approaches has presented new opportunities to study heart development and disease and identify drug targets. These models often closely mimic specific aspects of the native heart tissue including intercellular crosstalk and microenvironmental cues such that maturation occurs and relevant disease phenotypes are revealed. Most recently, organ-on-chip technology based on microfluidic devices has been combined with stem cell derived organoids and microtissues to create vascularized structures that can be subjected to fluidic flow and to which immune cells can be added to mimic inflammation of tissue postinjury.

To compensate for low blood oxygen levels, stress on the heart was greatly increased. Babesiosis induces a variety of pathologies; meanwhile, heart tissues initiate self-repair responses to babesiosis-induced tissue damage to restore heart function.\nTo discover the molecular mechanisms of the damage and self-repair in the heart after B. microti infection in mice, we investigated the changes in protein expression and phosphorylation modification levels in heart tissues at 0, 5, 8, 11, and 19 days post-infection using data-independent acquisition (DIA) quantitative proteomics.\nThe numbers of global proteins we identified were 1934, 1966, 1984, 1989, and 1955 and of phosphopeptides were 5118, 5133, 5130, 5133, and 5140 at 0, 5, 8, 11, and 19 days, respectively, in heart cells after infection with B. microti. The results showed that after B. microti infection the differentially expressed proteins in mice mainly include fibrinogen \u03b1 (Fg\u03b1), fibrinogen \u03b2 (Fg\u03b2), Serpina1b, Serpina1c, cathepsin Z, cytochrome c oxidases (COXs), RPS11, and RPS20. The proteins with phosphorylation changes mainly include 20-kDa light chain of myosin II (MLC20), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), and Akt1. These proteins were mainly involved in coagulation processes, cell apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosomes.\nThe coagulation cascade-related proteins, apoptosis-related proteins, oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins, and other types of proteins are all involved in the damage and self-repair process in the heart after B. microti infection.

Artificial intelligence tools and integrative data analysis revealed superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, gap junction protein \u03b1, myosin heavy chains, and zinc finger transcription factor GATA4 are engaged in oxidative stress and in cardiomyopathy. Network analysis indicated that MAPK3 might be the highest distribution property and cut point in this network, which could be a potential candidate for preventing and treating oxidative stress in heart tissue. Among antioxidant agents, grape seed extract (GSE) is an effective substance that altered antioxidant status in heart tissue. Considering drug discovery methods, we illustrated that GSE might target the MAPK3 protein with sufficient binding affinity. Moreover, we found that low- and moderate-intensity training might prevent the depletion of antioxidants after MI.

However, most of the currently available patches are made of inert materials with unmatched electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, which may lead to an increased risk for arrhythmia and heart failure. In this study, we have developed a novel Polyurethane/Small intestinal submucosa patch (PSP) with mechanical and electrical properties similar to those of the native myocardial tissue, and assessed its feasibility for the reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract. A right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction model was constructed in 40 rabbits. Compared with commercially available bovine pericardium patch, the PSP patch has shown better histocompatibility and biodegradability, in addition with significantly improved cardiac function. To tackle the significant fibrosis and relatively poor vascularization during tissue remodeling, we have further developed a bioactive patch by incorporating the PSP composites with urine-derived stem cells (USCs) which were pretreated with hypoxia. The results showed that the hypoxia-pretreated bioactive patch could significantly inhibit fibrosis and promote vascularization and muscularization, resulting in better right heart function.

Using genetically engineered multi-domain proteins, a printed bi-layer proteinaceous hydrogel patch for heart failure treatments is reported. The intrinsic self-healing nature of hydrogel materials physically enables seamless interfacial integration of two disparate hydrogel layers and functionally endows the cardiac patches with the combinatorial advantages of each layer. Leveraging the biocompatibility, structural stability, and tunable drug release properties of the bi-layer hydrogel, promising effects of hemostasis, fibrosis reduction, and heart function recovery on mice is demonstrated with two myocardium damage models.

An approach for creating a 3-dimensional (3D) structure from hPSCs that mimics human cardiac tissue functions has made it theoretically possible to conduct drug discovery and cardiotoxicity tests by assessing pharmacological responses in human cardiac tissues by a screening system using a compound library. The myocardium functions as a tissue composed of organized vascular networks, supporting stromal cells and cardiac muscle cells.

{"title": "Microengineered platforms for characterizing the contractile function of in vitro cardiac models.", "abstract": "Emerging heart-on-a-chip platforms are promising approaches to establish cardiac cell/tissue models in vitro for research on cardiac physiology, disease modeling and drug cardiotoxicity as well as for therapeutic discovery. Challenges still exist in obtaining the complete capability of in situ sensing to fully evaluate the complex functional properties of cardiac cell/tissue models. Changes to contractile strength (contractility) and beating regularity (rhythm) are particularly important to generate accurate, predictive models. Developing new platforms and technologies to assess the contractile functions of in vitro cardiac models is essential to provide information on cell/tissue physiologies, drug-induced inotropic responses, and the mechanisms of cardiac diseases. In this review, we discuss recent advances in biosensing platforms for the measurement of contractile functions of in vitro cardiac models, including single cardiomyocytes, 2D monolayers of cardiomyocytes, and 3D cardiac tissues. The characteristics and performance of current platforms are reviewed in terms of sensing principles, measured parameters, performance, cell sources, cell/tissue model configurations, advantages, and limitations. In addition, we highlight applications of these platforms and relevant discoveries in fundamental investigations, drug testing, and disease modeling.

{"title": "Joint cardiac tissue conductivity and activation time estimation using confirmatory factor analysis.", "abstract": "Mathematical models of the electrophysiology of cardiac tissue play an important role when studying heart rhythm disorders like atrial fibrillation. Model parameters such as conductivity, activation time, and anisotropy ratio are useful parameters to determine the arrhythmogenic substrate that causes abnormalities in the atrial tissue. Existing methods often estimate the model parameters separately and assume some of the parameters to be known as a priori knowledge. In this work, we propose an efficient method to jointly estimate the parameters of interest from the cross power spectral density matrix (CPSDM) model of the electrograms. By applying confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to the CPSDMs of multi-electrode electrograms, we can make use of the spatial information of the data and analyze the relationship between the desired resolution and the required amount of data. With the reasonable assumptions that the conductivity parameters and the anisotropy parameters are constant across different frequencies and heart beats, we estimate these parameters using multiple frequencies and multiple heart beats simultaneously to easier satisfy the identifiability conditions in the CFA problem. Results on the simulated data show that using multiple heart beats decreases the estimation errors of the conductivity and the estimated activation time parameters. The experimental results on clinical data show that using multiple heart beats for parameter estimation can reduce the reconstruction errors of the clinical electrograms, which further demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2022-03-18", "authors": ["MiaoSun", "Natasja M Sde Groot", "Richard CHendriks"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105393"}

{"title": "Embedded Computational Heart Model for External Ventricular Assist Device Investigations.", "abstract": "External cardiac assist devices are based on a promising and simple concept for treating heart failure, but they are surprisingly difficult to design. Thus, a structured approach combining experiments with computer-based optimization is essential. The latter provides the motivation for the work presented in this paper.\nWe present a computational modeling framework for realistic representation of the heart's tissue structure, electrophysiology and actuation. The passive heart tissue is described by a nonlinear anisotropic material law, considering fiber and sheetlet directions. For muscle contraction, an orthotropic active-strain model is employed, initiated by a periodically propagating electrical potential. The model allows for boundary conditions at the epicardium accounting for external assist devices, and it is coupled to a circulation network providing appropriate pressure boundary conditions inside the ventricles.\nSimulated results from an unsupported healthy and a pathological heart model are presented and reproduce accurate deformations compared to phenomenological measurements. Moreover, cardiac output and ventricular pressure signals are in good agreement too. By investigating the impact of applying an exemplary external actuation to the pathological heart model, it shows that cardiac patches can restore a healthy blood flow.\nWe demonstrate that the devised computational modeling framework is capable of predicting characteristic trends (e.g. apex shortening, wall thickening and apex twisting) of a healthy heart, and that it can be used to study pathological hearts and external activation thereof.", "journal": "Cardiovascular engineering and technology", "date": "2022-03-17", "authors": ["ThomasKummer", "SimoneRossi", "StijnVandenberghe", "StefanosDemertzis", "PatrickJenny"], "doi": "10.1007/s13239-022-00610-w\n10.1007/s10659-011-9351-4\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.03.029\n10.1161/01.CIR.62.1.105\n10.1177/1081286513485779\n10.1016/S0002-9149(76)80015-X\n10.1002/cnm.1402\n10.1016/0002-9610(64)90115-1\n10.1002/cnm.2842\n10.1002/cnm.3233\n10.1098/rsta.2009.0091\n10.1007/s10439-017-1855-z\n10.1097/MAT.0000000000000686\n10.1378/chest.39.2.207\n10.1007/s10439-006-9212-7\n10.1097/00002480-196504000-00012\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)00524-X\n10.3109/10976640009148678\n10.1145/563788.604453\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.1996.tb04421.x\n10.1098/rsfs.2010.0036\n10.1115/1.4004652\n10.1115/1.4005281\n10.1007/s10659-007-9111-7\n10.1016/S1053-2498(02)00482-5\n10.1002/cnm.1438\n10.1089/soro.2016.0076\n10.1007/s10237-021-01421-z\n10.1093/europace/euu257\n10.1007/s12410-014-9257-1\n10.1016/j.cma.2016.05.031\n10.1017/S0962492917000046\n10.1093/cvr/cvt003\n10.1186/1532-429X-15-S1-P92\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf3925\n10.1016/j.euromechsol.2013.10.009\n10.1093/imammb/dqt009\n10.1002/aja.1001010103\n10.1115/1.4023697\n10.1097/00000542-195801000-00057\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn141\n10.1080/10255842.2011.641121\n10.1007/s11538-007-9213-1\n10.1080/10255842.2012.739167"}

To test this hypothesis, we crossed ATGL-KO (AKO) mice and cardiac-specific HSL-overexpressing mice (cHSL) to establish homozygous AKO mice and AKO mice with cardiac-specific HSL overexpression (AKO+cHSL). We found that cardiac triacylglycerol content was 160-fold higher in AKO relative to Wt mice, whereas that of AKO+cHSL mice was comparable to the latter. In addition, AKO cardiac tissues exhibited reduced mRNA expression of PPAR\u03b1-regulated genes and upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac stress. In contrast, AKO+cHSL cardiac tissues exhibited expression levels similar to those observed in Wt mice. AKO cardiac tissues also exhibited macrophage infiltration, apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis, impaired systolic function, and marked increases in ceramide and diacylglycerol contents, whereas no such pathological alterations were observed in AKO+cHSL tissues. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed considerable LDs, damaged mitochondria, and disrupted intercalated discs in AKO cardiomyocytes, none of which were noted in AKO+cHSL cardiomyocytes. Importantly, the life span of AKO+cHSL mice was comparable to that of Wt mice. HSL overexpression normalizes lipotoxic cardiomyopathy in AKO mice and the findings highlight the applicability of cardiac HSL activation as a therapeutic strategy for ATGL deficiency-associated lipotoxic cardiomyopathies.", "journal": "Journal of lipid research", "date": "2022-03-15", "authors": ["MikaYamada", "JinyaSuzuki", "SatsukiSato", "YasuoZenimaru", "RieSaito", "TadashiKonoshita", "Fredric BKraemer", "TamotsuIshizuka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jlr.2022.100194"}

Differential genes expression was measured by q-RT-PCR. Artificial intelligence highlighted apoptosis pathways as a vital process in cardiovascular risks. Hence, we estimated the binding affinity of chemical and bioactive molecules on the cut point hub gene by pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking. Moreover, ST increased IL-6, Cat, Aif-1, and Caspase-9. 100\u00a0mg/kg TT has a more favorable effect than 50\u00a0mg/kg T. Also, RT with TT had interactive effects on reducing IL-6, Cat, Aif-1, and Caspase-9.

Stool samples were collected for estimation for 90 days, and at the end of the study, the animals were killed and heart tissue was isolated for histochemical analysis. We observed a sharp fall in the operational taxonomic unit in the FSIS control animals as compared to NC animals. Treatment with Vit C exhibited a decrease in Bacteroidetes while raising the abundance of spirochetes. Plasma levels of creatine kinase myocardial band (CKMB) in the treatment group reduced to 175.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.41\u2009U/L, from 317.7\u2009\u00b1\u200934.48\u2009U/L in the diabetic control group.

Our results suggest that FSIS induced cardiac complication is also associated with changes in gut microbial abundance. Higher doses of Vit C, which strengthens the immunity, have shown some positive outcomes on cardiac complications. The abundance of gut microbiota is also associated with the immune system, which in turn marks the impact of a disease. More the richness and diversity of the gut microbiome, healthier is the composition that can withstand the external threats of disease and other major challenges in the environment.

However, it remains unknown if DHM can protect against cardiotoxicity caused by DOX.\nThe present study was performed to evaluate the protective effect of DHM on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro.\nC57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with DOX to construct cardiac injury model in vivo, and AC16 cells were exposed to DOX to induce cell injury in vitro. Left ventricular function of mice were detected by echocardiography, the apoptosis of mice cardiac tissue and AC16 cells were detected by TUNEL and Hoechst33342/PI double staining. The expression of apoptosis and autophagy related proteins were detected by western blotting, immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence staining.\nEchocardiographic results showed that DOX-induced cardiotoxicity were significantly alleviated by DHM pretreatment. DOX induced cardiotoxicity of mice by inhibiting AMPK activation, increasing apoptosis and decreasing autophagy. However, under the same conditions, the heart tissue of DHM-pretreated mice showed increased autophagy and decreased apoptosis via activation AMPK/mTOR pathway. The same results were observed in vitro, and it was also found that DHM can inhibit the production of intracellular ROS in vitro.\nDHM protects against cardiotoxicity by inhibiting apoptosis and oxidative stress and it can allevate theautophagy inhibition caused by DOX through AMPK/mTOR pathway. DHM preconditioning may be a breakthrough in protecting DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in the future clinical applications.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2022-03-13", "authors": ["XiaoqiLi", "XinWang", "BinyuWang", "WeiqunChi", "ZhangyiLi", "MinZhang", "YifuShen", "XuLiu", "YoumeiLu", "YuLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154027"}
{"title": "Intrauterine inflammation exacerbates maladaptive remodeling of the immature myocardium after preterm birth in lambs.", "abstract": "Antenatal conditions that are linked with preterm birth, such as intrauterine inflammation, can influence fetal cardiac development thereby rendering the heart more vulnerable to the effects of prematurity. We aimed to investigate the effect of intrauterine inflammation, consequent to lipopolysaccharide exposure, on postnatal cardiac growth and maturation in preterm lambs.\nPreterm lambs (~129 days gestational age) exposed antenatally to lipopolysaccharide or saline were managed according to contemporary neonatal care and studied at postnatal day 7. Age-matched fetal controls were studied at ~136 days gestational age. Cardiac tissue was sampled for molecular analyses and assessment of cardiac structure and cardiomyocyte maturation.\nLambs delivered preterm showed distinct ventricular differences in cardiomyocyte growth and maturation trajectories as well as remodeling of the left ventricular myocardium compared to fetal controls. Antenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide resulted in further collagen deposition in the left ventricle and a greater presence of immune cells in the preterm heart.\nAdverse impacts of preterm birth on cardiac structure and cardiomyocyte growth kinetics within the first week of postnatal life are exacerbated by intrauterine inflammation. The maladaptive remodeling of the cardiac structure and perturbed cardiomyocyte growth likely contribute to the increased vulnerability to cardiac dysfunction following preterm birth.\nPreterm birth induces maladaptive cardiac remodeling and adversely impacts cardiomyocyte growth kinetics within the first week of life in sheep. These effects of prematurity on the heart are exacerbated when preterm birth is preceded by exposure to intrauterine inflammation, a common antecedent of preterm birth. Inflammatory injury to the fetal heart coupled with preterm birth consequently alters neonatal cardiac growth and maturation and thus, may potentially influence long-term cardiac function and health.", "journal": "Pediatric research", "date": "2022-03-13", "authors": ["AmandaVrselja", "J JanePillow", "Jonathan GBensley", "Stacey JEllery", "SiavashAhmadi-Noorbakhsh", "Timothy JMoss", "M JaneBlack"], "doi": "10.1038/s41390-022-01955-7\n10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30451-0\n10.1016/j.clp.2010.02.003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60074-4\n10.1155/2013/412831\n10.1055/s-2006-956773\n10.1136/adc.2005.071993\n10.1042/CS20140097\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.05.017\n10.1016/S1369-5274(99)00046-6\n10.1172/JCI6709\n10.1177/1933719107314060\n10.1203/PDR.0b013e318225fbcb\n10.3389/fped.2018.00029\n10.1530/JOE-15-0309\n10.1038/pr.2017.96\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.126920\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002583\n10.1016/j.jacc.2021.05.053\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq104\n10.1016/j.cjco.2020.12.017\n10.1002/ar.20789\n10.1046/j.1365-2818.2002.01054.x\n10.1038/pr.2017.324\n10.3389/fped.2018.00008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00689.2010\n10.1038/srep23756\n10.1096/fj.15-272013\n10.1007/s00395-005-0524-9\n10.1203/01.PDR.0000157726.65492.CD\n10.1186/gb-2007-8-2-r19\n10.1038/s41569-018-0077-x\n10.1172/JCI87491\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.03.572\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.10.063\n10.1074/jbc.M115.682195\n10.1113/JP275806\n10.1146/annurev.ph.41.030179.002123\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.03.016\n10.1089/ars.2010.3728\n10.1161/01.RES.0000144175.70140.8c\n10.1016/j.ajog.2018.01.009\n10.1177/1933719116649697\n10.1002/ar.a.10110\n10.1159/000356704\n10.1152/ajpregu.00484.2006\n10.1152/ajpheart.00439.2018\n10.1152/ajpregu.2000.279.4.R1157\n10.1203/00006450-200007000-00010\n10.1096/fj.202000697R\n10.1016/j.molmed.2019.09.005\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.01.046\n10.1186/s12968-021-00816-2\n10.1016/j.echo.2016.03.011"}

{"title": "Effectiveness of high cardiorespiratory fitness in cardiometabolic protection in prediabetic rats.", "abstract": "Caloric restriction and exercise are lifestyle interventions that effectively attenuate cardiometabolic impairment. However, cardioprotective effects of long-term lifestyle interventions and short-term lifestyle interventions followed by weight maintenance in prediabetes have never been compared. High cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been shown to provide protection against prediabetes and cardiovascular diseases, however, the interactions between CRF, prediabetes, caloric restriction, and exercise on cardiometabolic health has never been investigated.\nSeven-week-old male Wistar rats were fed with either a normal diet (ND; n\u2009=\u20096) or a high-fat diet (HFD; n\u2009=\u200930) to induce prediabetes for 12\u00a0weeks. Baseline CRF and cardiometabolic parameters were determined at this timepoint. The ND-fed rats were fed continuously with a ND for 16 more weeks. The HFD-fed rats were divided into 5 groups (n\u2009=\u20096/group) to receive one of the following: (1) a HFD without any intervention for 16\u00a0weeks, (2) 40% caloric restriction for 6\u00a0weeks followed by an ad libitum ND for 10\u00a0weeks, (3) 40% caloric restriction for 16\u00a0weeks, (4) a HFD plus an exercise training program for 6\u00a0weeks followed by a ND without exercise for 10\u00a0weeks, or (5) a HFD plus an exercise training program for 16\u00a0weeks. At the end of the interventions, CRF and cardiometabolic parameters were re-assessed. Then, all rats were euthanized and heart tissues were collected.\nEither short-term caloric restriction or exercise followed by weight maintenance ameliorated cardiometabolic impairment in prediabetes, as indicated by increased insulin sensitivity, improved blood lipid profile, improved mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and improved cardiac function. However, these benefits were not as effective as those of either long-term caloric restriction or exercise. Interestingly, high-level baseline CRF was correlated with favorable cardiac and metabolic profiles at follow-up in prediabetic rats, both with and without lifestyle interventions.\nShort-term lifestyle modification followed by weight maintenance improves cardiometabolic health in prediabetes. High CRF exerted protection against cardiometabolic impairment in prediabetes, both with and without lifestyle modification.

{"title": "Cardiac Tissue-like 3D Microenvironment Enhances Route towards Human Fibroblast Direct Reprogramming into Induced Cardiomyocytes by microRNAs.", "abstract": "The restoration of cardiac functionality after myocardial infarction represents a major clinical challenge. Recently, we found that transient transfection with microRNA combination (miRcombo: miR-1, miR-133, miR-208 and 499) is able to trigger direct reprogramming of adult human cardiac fibroblasts (AHCFs) into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) in vitro. However, achieving efficient direct reprogramming still remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of cardiac tissue-like biochemical and biophysical stimuli on direct reprogramming efficiency. Biomatrix (BM), a cardiac-like extracellular matrix (ECM), was produced by in vitro culture of AHCFs for 21 days, followed by decellularization. In a set of experiments, AHCFs were transfected with miRcombo and then cultured for 2 weeks on the surface of uncoated and BM-coated polystyrene (PS) dishes and fibrin hydrogels (2D hydrogel) or embedded into 3D fibrin hydrogels (3D hydrogel). Cell culturing on BM-coated PS dishes and in 3D hydrogels significantly improved direct reprogramming outcomes. Biochemical and biophysical cues were then combined in 3D fibrin hydrogels containing BM (3D BM hydrogel), resulting in a synergistic effect, triggering increased CM gene and cardiac troponin T expression in miRcombo-transfected AHCFs. Hence, biomimetic 3D culture environments may improve direct reprogramming of miRcombo-transfected AHCFs into iCMs, deserving further study.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2022-03-11", "authors": ["CamillaPaoletti", "ElenaMarcello", "Maria LunaMelis", "CarlaDivieto", "DariaNurzynska", "ValeriaChiono"], "doi": "10.3390/cells11050800\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.008720\n10.1038/nature06800\n10.1038/s41569-018-0036-6\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002\n10.1186/s13287-017-0569-3\n10.1038/cr.2015.99\n10.1038/ncomms9243\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269035\n10.1073/pnas.1301019110\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304510\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00529\n10.1007/s13238-017-0402-x\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.750438\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.07.022\n10.1038/srep38815\n10.1038/s41578-020-0199-8\n10.3389/fcell.2020.621644\n10.1021/acsabm.0c01490\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.01.047\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.050\n10.1155/2013/352370\n10.1373/clinchem.2013.214742\n10.1038/nmeth.3839\n10.1155/2021/9933331\n10.3390/cells7090114\n10.1002/ejhf.446\n10.1155/2018/1435746\n10.1016/j.lfs.2017.04.013\n10.1038/s41580-021-00335-z\n10.1038/nature11044\n10.1002/pmic.200900758\n10.1152/ajpheart.00023.2006\n10.1007/s10741-018-9720-1\n10.1042/BSR20204185\n10.1536/ihj.54.40\n10.1016/j.addr.2019.05.011\n10.1089/biores.2014.0018\n10.3390/ma11091781\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77113-4\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.11.035\n10.3390/nano10081484"}
{"title": "Changes in the Mitochondrial Dynamics and Functions Together with the mRNA/miRNA Network in the Heart Tissue Contribute to Hypoxia Adaptation in Tibetan Sheep.", "abstract": "This study aimed to provide insights into molecular regulation and mitochondrial functionality under hypoxia by exploring the mechanism of adaptation to hypoxia, blood indexes, tissue morphology, mRNA/miRNA regulation, mitochondrial dynamics, and functional changes in Tibetan sheep raised at different altitudes. With regard to blood indexes and myocardial morphology, the HGB, HCT, CK, CK-MB, LDH, LDH1, SOD, GPX, LDL level, and myocardial capillary density were significantly increased in the sheep at higher altitudes (p < 0.05). The RNA-seq results suggested the DEmRNAs and DEmiRNAs are mainly associated with the PI3K-Akt, Wnt, and PPAR signaling pathways and with an upregulation of oncogenes (CCKBR, GSTT1, ARID5B) and tumor suppressor factors (TPT1, EXTL1, ITPRIP) to enhance the cellular metabolism and increased ATP production. Analyzing mRNA\u2212miRNA coregulation indicated the mitochondrial dynamics and functions to be significantly enriched. By analyzing mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial fusion was shown to be significantly increased and fission significantly decreased in the heart with increasing altitude (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the density of the mitochondria, and a significant decrease in the average area, aspect ratio, number, and width of single mitochondrial cristae with increasing altitudes (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the NADH, NAD+ and ATP content, NADH/NAD+ ratio, and CO activity, while there was a significant decrease in SDH and CA activity in various tissues with increasing altitudes (p < 0.05). Accordingly, changes in the blood indexes and myocardial morphology of the Tibetan sheep were found to improve the efficiency of hemoglobin-carrying oxygen and reduce oxidative stress. The high expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor factors might facilitate cell division and energy exchange, as was evident from enhanced mitochondrial fission and OXPHOS expression; however, it reduced the fusion and TCA cycle for the further rapid production of ATP in adaptation to hypoxia stress. This systematic study has for the first time delineated the mechanism of hypoxia adaptation in the heart of Tibetan sheep, which is significant for improving the ability of the mammals to adapt to hypoxia and for studying the dynamic regulation of mitochondria during hypoxia conditions.", "journal": "Animals : an open access journal from MDPI", "date": "2022-03-11", "authors": ["YuliangWen", "ShaobinLi", "FangfangZhao", "JiqingWang", "XiuLiu", "JiangHu", "GaoliangBao", "YuzhuLuo"], "doi": "10.3390/ani12050583\n10.1073/pnas.0701985104\n10.1007/s00441-018-2801-6\n10.3390/ani9090673\n10.1186/s12864-019-5873-0\n10.1016/j.livsci.2010.08.007\n10.2174/2211536605666160825151201\n10.1152/ajpendo.00052.2019\n10.3892/mmr.2018.9713\n10.1002/jcb.28944\n10.1186/s13046-019-1398-2\n10.1186/s13287-020-01610-0\n10.1016/j.gene.2021.145893\n10.1177/1745691617718356\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.10.041\n10.1038/bjc.2015.85\n10.1007/s00441-018-2975-y\n10.15252/embj.201899748\n10.1007/s10495-016-1295-5\n10.1056/NEJMra1215233\n10.3389/fgene.2021.691592\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bty560\n10.1038/nmeth.1923\n10.1038/nmeth.3317\n10.1038/nbt.3122\n10.1186/1471-2105-12-323\n10.1038/nbt.1621\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1093/nar/gkx1094\n10.1093/nar/gkg006\n10.1093/nar/gkj112\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1249/MSS.0000000000001923\n10.1007/978-1-4899-7678-9_21\n10.1155/2017/9743280\n10.1007/s00441-016-2461-3\n10.1177/1533033820905825\n10.1038/srep22907\n10.1371/journal.pone.0182602\n10.1126/science.aav6335\n10.1186/s40478-019-0805-4\n10.1126/scisignal.aaf5967\n10.1038/s41392-020-0110-5\n10.1038/nrg3471\n10.18632/oncotarget.19962\n10.1038/nature12154\n10.1016/j.cmet.2020.10.005\n10.1016/j.molcel.2016.02.009\n10.1091/mbc.e12-10-0721\n10.1080/15548627.2016.1193656\n10.1038/s41389-020-00251-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0197266\n10.2337/db07-1781\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2008.05.001\n10.3389/fcell.2020.594203\n10.1038/s42003-020-0988-z\n10.12659/MSM.913384\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.10.004\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.02.012\n10.1080/09168451.2017.1422972\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.037\n10.1007/978-981-10-7757-9_7\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.064\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.07.007"}

{"title": "AQUA Mutant Protein Quantification of Endomyocardial Biopsy-Sized Samples From a Patient With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "In genetic diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, reliable quantification of the expression level of mutant protein can play an important role in disease research, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. For heterozygous \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MyHC) mutations it has been shown that disease severity is related to the fraction of mutant protein in the myocardium. Yet, heart tissue from patients with genetically characterized diseases is scarce. Here we asked, if even in the case of small endomyocardial biopsies, single quantifications produce reliable results. Myocardial samples were taken from four different regions of an explanted heart of a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy carrying point mutation p.Gly716Arg in \u03b2-MyHC. From both, large samples (15 mg) and small, endomyocardial biopsy-sized samples (\u2264 1 mg) myosin was extracted and enzymatically digested to yield a specific peptide of interest that allowed to distinguish mutant and wild-type \u03b2-MyHC. Absolute quantification by mass spectrometry (AQUA) of the peptide of interest was performed repeatedly for both sample sizes to determine the fraction of mutant \u03b2-MyHC. Fractions of mutant \u03b2-MyHC (32% on average) showed only small differences between the four cardiac regions and for large and small samples.

In contrast to adult mammals, zebrafish can regenerate their heart after injury, enabling the study of the underlying mechanisms. One of the earliest responses following cardiac injury in adult zebrafish is coronary revascularization. Defects in this process lead to impaired cardiomyocyte repopulation and scarring. Hence, identifying and investigating factors that promote coronary revascularization holds great therapeutic potential.\nWe used wholemount imaging, immunohistochemistry and histology to assess various aspects of zebrafish cardiac regeneration. Deep transcriptomic analysis allowed us to identify targets and potential effectors of Vegfc (vascular endothelial growth factor C) signaling.

{"title": "Trimetazidine Alleviates Postresuscitation Myocardial Dysfunction and Improves 96-Hour Survival in a Ventricular Fibrillation Rat Model.", "abstract": "Background Myocardial dysfunction is a critical cause of post-cardiac arrest hemodynamic instability and circulatory failure that may lead to early mortality after resuscitation. Trimetazidine is a metabolic agent that has been demonstrated to provide protective effects in myocardial ischemia. However, whether trimetazidine protects against postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is unknown. Methods and Results Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated after 8\u00a0minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were randomized to 4 groups immediately after resuscitation (n=15/group): (1) normothermia control (NTC); (2) targeted temperature management; (3) trimetazidine-normothermia; (4) trimetazidine-targeted temperature management. TMZ was administered at a single dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg in rats with trimetazidine. The body temperature was maintained at 34.0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0hours and then rewarmed to 37.5\u00b0C in rats with targeted temperature management. Postresuscitation hemodynamics, 96-hours survival, and pathological analysis were assessed. Heart tissues and blood samples of additional rats (n=6/group) undergoing the same experimental procedure were collected to measure myocardial injury, inflammation and oxidative stress-related biomarkers with ELISA-based quantification assays. Compared with normothermia control, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and cardiac troponin-I were significantly reduced, whereas the left ventricular ejection fraction and 96-hours survival rates were significantly improved in the 3 experimental groups.

{"title": "Deciphering Cell-Type-Specific Gene Expression Signatures of Cardiac Diseases Through Reconstruction of Bulk Transcriptomes.", "abstract": "Cardiac diseases compose a fatal disease category worldwide. Over the past decade, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of bulk heart tissues has widened our understanding of the onset and progression of cardiac diseases. The recent rise of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology further enables deep explorations of their molecular mechanisms in a cell-type-specific manner. However, due to technical difficulties in performing scRNA-seq on heart tissues, there are still few scRNA-seq studies on cardiac diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that an effective alternative could be cell-type-specific computational reconstruction of bulk transcriptomes. An integrative bulk transcriptome dataset covering 110 samples from 12 studies was first constructed by re-analysis of raw sequencing data derived from the heart tissues of four common cardiac disease mouse models (myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy). Based on the single-cell reference covering four major cardiac component cell types and 22 immune cell subtypes, for each sample, the bulk transcriptome was reconstructed into cellular compositions and cell-type-specific expression profiles by CIBERSORTx. Variations in the estimated cell composition revealed elevated abundances of fibroblast and monocyte during myocardial infarction, which were further verified by our flow cytometry experiment. Moreover, through cell-type-specific differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analysis, we observed a series of signaling pathways that mapped to specific cell type in diseases, like MAPK and EGFR1 signaling pathways in fibroblasts in myocardial infarction. We also found an increased expression of several secretory proteins in monocytes which may serve as regulatory factors in cardiac fibrosis. Finally, a ligand-receptor analysis identified key cell types which may serve as hubs in cellular communication in cardiac diseases. Our results provide novel clues for the cell-type-specific signatures of cardiac diseases that would promote better understanding of their pathophysiological mechanisms.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2022-03-08", "authors": ["XiaobinWu", "XingyuZhao", "YufeiXiong", "MingZheng", "ChaoZhong", "YuanZhou"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2022.792774\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1093/nar/gks1193\n10.1007/s10741-018-9716-x\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1136/jclinpath-2012-201022\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bty560\n10.1177/1074248420952233\n10.1161/circresaha.107.160978\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.1161/circresaha.113.300376\n10.1093/bib/bbz166\n10.7554/eLife.43882\n10.1124/pr.117.013896\n10.1002/cphy.c150006\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1161/circresaha.115.303567\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2018.07.005\n10.1186/s13059-020-02132-x\n10.1038/s41467-020-15816-6\n10.1038/s41467-021-21246-9\n10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037\n10.1038/nm.4428\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.1186/1471-2105-12-323\n10.3389/fmed.2020.00451\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz305\n10.1073/pnas.1720065115\n10.1172/jci.insight.96308\n10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02228\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1038/labinvest.2015.145\n10.1007/s11357-016-9933-y\n10.1161/circulationaha.119.041694\n10.1159/000500419\n10.1038/nmeth.3337\n10.1038/s41587-019-0114-2\n10.1016/j.ccr.2004.09.029\n10.1016/j.clim.2008.08.008\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.016\n10.1016/j.clim.2016.11.010\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-111315-125341\n10.1093/cvr/cvz336\n10.1038/s12276-019-0355-7\n10.1152/physrev.00021.2018\n10.1093/nar/gkw943\n10.1161/circresaha.115.307778\n10.1093/nar/gkz369\n10.1161/circulationaha.119.043053\n10.1161/circulationaha.119.044557\n10.1038/nbt.3192\n10.1038/nrg3542\n10.1007/978-1-0716-0301-7_7\n10.3389/fcell.2021.671255\n10.1038/s41586-020-2496-1\n10.1038/s41586-018-0590-4\n10.1161/circulationaha.119.045401\n10.1038/s41556-019-0446-7\n10.1038/s41467-018-08023-x\n10.1038/nrg2484\n10.1093/nar/gkq537\n10.3892/mmr.2017.8013\n10.1186/s12935-021-02108-2\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2019.01.080\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.013\n10.4149/bll_2017_065\n10.26355/eurrev_202002_20192\n10.1093/nar/gky900\n10.1038/s41421-019-0095-9\n10.1038/s41591-019-0695-9\n10.1016/j.molcel.2017.01.023"}

Although to its hazardous effects in non-target species, little information is available in the literature to show the cardiotoxic effects of EPX in male rats. Thus, our investigation aimed to assess the outcomes of EPX exposure on some biochemical parameters, the generation of oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation and histopathological alterations in the heart tissue. EPX was administered orally at doses of 8, 24, 40 and 56\u00a0mg/kg body weight, representing, respectively NOEL (No observed effect level), NOEL\u00d7 3, NOEL\u00d7 5 and NOEL\u00d7 7 for 28 consecutive days in male Wistar rats. Our results show that EPX induced a significant decrease of cardiac acetylcholinesterase, an increase of biochemical markers, such as creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and a perturbation of the lipid profile. Furthermore, EPX caused diverse histological modifications in the myocardium, including congestion of cardiac blood vessels, cytoplasmic vacuolization, leucocytic infiltration and hemorrhage. Indeed, we have shown that EPX induces increase of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation levels and DNA damage. On the other hand, we have found an increase of the antioxidant enzymes activity such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities.

Body weight was recorded every 10 days. Ninety days after model construction, the serum lipid and cytokine level, liver function, fat accumulation, carotid artery stenosis, and cardiomyopathological changes were detected in mice. Macrophages in the liver, subscapular fat, and heart tissues were labeled with immunofluorescence staining. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were then isolated. Inflammatory cytokine levels were measured in the macrophage supernatant. The ability of macrophages to form foam cells was also tested. The supernatant from macrophages in different groups was added to AML12 (hepatocytes), 3T3-L1 (preadipocytes), or HL-1 (cardiomyocytes). Effects of conditioned media on recipient cells were determined.\nBody weight, serum lipids and cytokines, subscapular fat accumulation, liver enzymes, carotid artery stenosis, and myocardial fibrosis levels of the L24, D12L12, and D24 groups mice were significantly higher than those in the Con group.

The mechanical interaction between the ablation electrode and tissue was dynamically modeled to reproduce heartbeat-induced changes in the electrode insertion depth from 0.86 to 2.05\u00a0mm, which corresponded with contact forces between 10 and 30\u00a0g when cardiac tissue was modeled by a hyperelastic Neo-Hookean model with a Young's modulus of 75\u00a0kPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.49.\nThe lesion size computed in the dynamic case was 6.04\u00a0mm deep, 9.48\u00a0mm maximum width and 6.98\u00a0mm surface width, which is within the range of previous experimental results based on a beating heart for a similar energy setting and contact force.

{"title": "Short-term exercise-induced protection of cardiovascular function and health: why and how fast does the heart benefit from exercise?", "abstract": "Regular exercise training has potent and powerful protective effects against the development of cardiovascular disease. These cardioprotective effects of regular exercise training are partly explained through the effects of exercise on traditional cardiovascular risk factors and improvement in cardiac and vascular health, which take several weeks to months to develop. This review focuses on the observation that single bouts of exercise may also possess an underrecognized, clinically useful form of immediate cardioprotection. Studies, performed in both animals and humans, demonstrate that single or short-term exercise-induced protection (SEP) attenuates the magnitude of cardiac and/or vascular damage in response to prolonged ischaemia and reperfusion injury. This review highlights preclinical evidence supporting the hypothesis that SEP activates multiple pathways to confer immediate protection against ischaemic events, reduce the severity of potentially lethal ischaemic myocardial injury, and therefore act as a physiological first line of defence against injury. Given the fact that the extent of SEP could be modulated by exercise-related and subject-related factors, it is important to recognize and consider these factors to optimize future clinical implications of SEP. This review also summarizes potential effector signalling pathways (i.e. communication between exercising muscles to vascular/cardiac tissue) and intracellular pathways (i.e. reducing tissue damage) that ultimately confer protection against cardiac and vascular injury. Finally, we discuss potential future directions for designing adequate human and animal studies that will support developing effective SEP strategies for the (multi-)diseased and aged individual. KEY POINTS: Single or short-term exercise-induced protection (SEP) attenuates the magnitude of cardiac and/or vascular damage in response to prolonged ischaemia and reperfusion injury (IR injury). SEP activates multiple pathways to confer cardiac protection, which develops remotely at the site of the activated muscle by release of circulating molecules, which transfer towards activation of intramyocardial signalling that promotes cell survival during episodes of IR injury. SEP represents an attractive intervention in aged individuals and in those with co-morbidities. The immediate protection, low cost and simplicity to increase the 'dose' of SEP offers unique opportunities in the clinical applications of SEP.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2022-03-04", "authors": ["Dick H JThijssen", "LaweenUthman", "YasinaSomani", "Nielsvan Royen"], "doi": "10.1113/JP282000"}

{"title": "LONP1-mediated mitochondrial quality control safeguards metabolic shifts in heart development.", "abstract": "The mitochondrial matrix AAA+ Lon protease (LONP1) degrades misfolded or unassembled proteins, which play a pivotal role in mitochondrial quality control. During heart development, a metabolic shift from anaerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation takes place, which relies strongly on functional mitochondria. However, the relationship between the mitochondrial quality control machinery and metabolic shifts is elusive. Here, we interfered with mitochondrial quality control by inactivating Lonp1 in murine embryonic cardiac tissue, resulting in severely impaired heart development, leading to embryonic lethality. Mitochondrial swelling, cristae loss and abnormal protein aggregates were evident in the mitochondria of Lonp1-deficient cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, the p-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway was triggered, and nuclear translocation of ATF4 was observed. We further demonstrated that ATF4 regulates the expression of Tfam negatively while promoting that of Glut1, which was responsible for the disruption of the metabolic shift to oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species were observed in Lonp1-deficient cardiomyocytes. This study revealed that LONP1 safeguards metabolic shifts in the developing heart by controlling mitochondrial protein quality, suggesting that disrupted mitochondrial quality control may cause prenatal cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2022-03-04", "authors": ["KeZhao", "XinyiHuang", "WukuiZhao", "BinLu", "ZhongzhouYang"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.200458"}
{"title": "In Vitro and In Vivo Cardioprotective Effects of Curcumin against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity: A Systematic Review.", "abstract": "This study aimed to review the potential chemoprotective effects of curcumin against the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.\nAccording to the PRISMA guideline, a comprehensive systematic search was performed in different electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus) up to July 2021. One hundred and sixty-four studies were screened in accordance with a predefined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eighteen eligible articles were finally included in the current systematic review.\nAccording to the in vitro and in vivo findings, it was found that doxorubicin administration leads to decreased cell survival, increased mortality, decreased bodyweight, heart weight, and heart to the bodyweight ratio compared to the control groups. However, curcumin cotreatment demonstrated an opposite pattern in comparison with the doxorubicin-treated groups alone. Other findings showed that doxorubicin significantly induces biochemical changes in the cardiac cells/tissue. Furthermore, the histological changes on the cardiac tissue were observed following doxorubicin treatment. Nevertheless, for most of the cases, these biochemical and histological changes mediated by doxorubicin were reversed near to control groups following curcumin coadministration.\nIt can be mentioned that coadministration of curcumin alleviates the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Curcumin exerts these cardioprotective effects through different mechanisms of antioxidant, antiapoptosis, and anti-inflammatory. Since the finding presented in this systematic review are based on in vitro and in vivo studies, suggesting the use of curcumin in cancer patients as a cardioprotector agent against cardiotoxicity mediated by doxorubicin requires further clinical studies.", "journal": "Journal of oncology", "date": "2022-03-04", "authors": ["QianZhang", "LeiWu"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/7277562\n10.1186/s12933-018-0762-4\n10.1007/s11010-017-3195-6\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.11.001\n10.1161/circulationaha.112.100560\n10.1200/jco.2012.45.2938\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs181\n10.3238/arztebl.2014.0161\n10.1111/eci.12589\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.05.021\n10.1136/bmj.c4848\n10.1016/j.drudis.2007.07.013\n10.1517/17425250902932915\n10.1185/030079907x210561\n10.2174/092986709788803312\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.006\n10.1056/nejm199809243391307\n10.1159/000265166\n10.1023/a:1007094214460\n10.1161/circulationaha.114.013777\n10.1007/s11886-013-0362-6\n10.1016/j.pcad.2006.10.002\n10.1016/j.oraloncology.2008.05.014\n10.1371/journal.pone.0038557\n10.1016/j.tranon.2019.06.002\n10.1186/s12935-021-02099-0\n10.3389/fonc.2021.680758\n10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107741\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119721\n10.1002/jcp.27442\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118051\n10.4103/0973-1482.159086\n10.1007/s10787-016-0301-4\n10.1016/j.jff.2015.01.005\n10.1007/s11064-009-0065-y\n10.2174/1381612822666161006151605\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2016.10.001\n10.1016/j.phrs.2016.03.026\n10.1055/s-0043-100019\n10.2174/1381612822666161010115235\n10.1002/ptr.5174\n10.1016/j.phrs.2016.11.017\n10.5114/aoms.2017.69326\n10.1016/j.phrs.2017.02.008\n10.1002/jcp.25778\n10.1016/j.autrev.2017.11.016\n10.1055/s-0044-101752\n10.1016/j.phrs.2018.09.012\n10.3390/nu11102376\n10.1002/jcp.28122\n10.7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00135\n10.1016/j.fct.2011.01.021\n10.1039/c8fo00466h\n10.4103/0253-7613.91871\n10.1177/0960327114527628\n10.1080/03639045.2019.1672717\n10.1002/fsn3.1210\n10.1039/c9fo01034c\n10.21037/cdt-19-707\n10.1177/1534735414564425\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0701877\n10.1089/jmf.2007.0715\n10.1002/jbt.22030\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.04.062\n10.1155/2016/1980763\n10.1007/s11864-020-00812-1\n10.1016/j.ijcha.2015.11.004\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.10.043\n10.1093/carcin/bgv006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0085397\n10.1080/13813455.2017.1422766\n10.1006/phrs.2000.0724\n10.1007/s11010-018-3363-3\n10.1111/jphp.12855\n10.1371/journal.pone.0101529\n10.1002/jcb.27909\n10.1016/j.etap.2017.06.020\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.03.011\n10.1016/j.bcp.2008.09.029\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.117173\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2018.06.005\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.05.035\n10.1177/0960327111426589\n10.1007/s00018-008-7452-4\n10.1023/a:1015976430790\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.05.009\n10.1016/j.ejmp.2016.07.076\n10.1016/j.surg.2013.03.012\n10.1158/1535-7163.mct-14-1056-t\n10.1007/bf02899922\n10.1016/s0360-3016(99)00025-5\n10.1667/RR2446.1\n10.1158/1535-7163.mct-15-0730\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a011629\n10.3390/ijms20225691\n10.1371/journal.pone.0169767\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207494\n10.1371/journal.pone.0181535\n10.3892/mmr.2015.4665\n10.1093/cvr/cvr022\n10.1016/j.taap.2010.01.006\n10.1124/jpet.111.189589\n10.1111/bph.13377\n10.1074/jbc.m113.496315\n10.1016/s0027-5107(01)00111-7\n10.1016/j.bcp.2011.01.008\n10.1016/j.cellbi.2005.10.024\n10.1016/s0014-5793(02)02292-5\n10.3390/ijms20102454\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605308\n10.2147/ott.s60114\n10.2174/156652410791316968\n10.3390/antiox9020159\n10.1155/2012/606183\n10.1007/s13105-014-0339-y\n10.1016/j.tips.2009.03.004\n10.1016/j.cbi.2015.02.021\n10.1111/jfbc.12398\n10.1161/01.cir.97.14.1382\n10.26355/eurrev_202111_27124\n10.1016/s0360-3016(00)00435-1\n10.1126/scisignal.aam7464\n10.3390/molecules16064567"}
{"title": "Lack of food intake during shift work alters the heart transcriptome and leads to cardiac tissue fibrosis and inflammation in rats.", "abstract": "Many epidemiological studies revealed that shift work is associated with an increased risk of a number of pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases. An experimental model of shift work in rats has additionally been shown to recapitulate aspects of metabolic disorders observed in human shift workers, including increased fat content and impaired glucose tolerance, and used to demonstrate that restricting food consumption outside working hours prevents shift work-associated obesity and metabolic disturbance. However, the way distinct shift work parameters, such as type of work, quantity, and duration, affect cardiovascular function and the underlying mechanisms, remains poorly understood. Here, we used the rat as a model to characterize the effects of shift work in the heart and determine whether they can be modulated by restricting food intake during the normal active phase.\nWe show that experimental shift work reprograms the heart cycling transcriptome independently of food consumption. While phases of rhythmic gene expression are distributed across the 24-h day in control rats, they are clustered towards discrete times in shift workers. Additionally, preventing food intake during shift work affects the expression level of hundreds of genes in the heart, including genes encoding components of the extracellular matrix and inflammatory markers found in transcriptional signatures associated with pressure overload and cardiac hypertrophy. Consistent with this, the heart of shift worker rats not eating during work hours, but having access to food outside of shift work, exhibits increased collagen 1 deposition and displays increased infiltration by immune cells. While maintaining food access during shift work has less effects on gene expression, genes found in transcriptional signatures of cardiac hypertrophy remain affected, and the heart of shift worker rats exhibits fibrosis without inflammation.\nTogether, our findings unraveled differential effects of food consumption on remodeled transcriptional profiles of the heart in shift worker rats. They also provide insights into how shift work affects cardiac function and suggest that some interventions aiming at mitigating metabolic disorders in shift workers may have adverse effects on cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "BMC biology", "date": "2022-03-04", "authors": ["Alexandra JTrott", "Ben JGreenwell", "Tejas RKarhadkar", "Natali NGuerrero-Vargas", "CarolinaEscobar", "Ruud MBuijs", "Jerome SMenet"], "doi": "10.1186/s12915-022-01256-9"}

In this review, we have delineated the plausible molecular mechanisms that could explain why there are increased clinical\u00a0complications in patients with DM that become critically ill when infected with SARS-CoV2. RNA viruses have been classically implicated in manifestation of new onset diabetes. SARS-CoV2 infection through cytokine storm leads to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines creating an imbalance in the functioning of T helper cells affecting multiple organs. Inflammation and Th1/Th2 cell imbalance along with Th17 have been associated with DM, which can exacerbate SARS-CoV2 infection severity. ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis positively modulates \u03b2-cell and cardiac tissue function and survival. However, ACE-2 receptors dock SARS-CoV2, which internalize and deplete ACE-2 and activate Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathway. This induces inflammation promoting insulin resistance that has positive effect on RAS pathway, causes \u03b2-cell dysfunction, promotes inflammation and increases the risk of cardiovascular complications. Further, hyperglycemic state could upregulate ACE-2 receptors for viral infection thereby increasing the severity of the diabetic condition. SARS-CoV2 infection in diabetic patients with heart conditions are linked to worse outcomes.

{"title": "Development and characterization of anti-fibrotic natural compound similars with improved effectivity.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibroblasts constitute the major cell type of the murine and human heart. Once activated, they contribute to an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) leading to cardiac fibrosis and subsequently organ dysfunction. With the exception of the pulmonary drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, drugs specifically targeting anti-fibrotic pathways are scarce. We recently performed large library screenings of natural occurring compounds and identified first lead structures with anti-fibrotic properties in vitro and in vivo. In line, we now aimed to improve efficacy of these anti-fibrotic lead structures by combining in vitro validation studies and in silico prediction. Next to this combined approach, we performed large OMICs-multi-panel-based mechanistic studies. Applying human cardiac fibroblasts (HCF), we analysed 26 similars of the initially identified anti-fibrotic lead molecules bufalin and lycorine and determined anti-proliferative activity and potential toxicity in an array of in vitro and ex vivo studies. Of note, even at lower concentrations, certain similars were more effective at inhibiting HCF proliferation than nintedanib and pirfenidone. Additionally, selected similars showed low cytotoxicity on human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes and anti-fibrotic gene regulation in human ex vivo living myocardial slices. Further, array and RNA sequencing studies of coding and non-coding RNAs in treated HCFs revealed strong anti-fibrotic properties, especially with the lycorine similar lyco-s (also known as homoharringtonine), that led to a nearly\u00a0complete shutdown of ECM production at concentrations 100-fold lower than the previously identified anti-fibrotic compound lycorine without inducing cellular toxicity. We thus identified a new natural compound similar with strong anti-fibrotic properties in human cardiac fibroblasts and human living heart tissue potentially opening new anti-fibrotic treatment strategies.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2022-03-03", "authors": ["Fabian PhilippKreutzer", "AnnaMeinecke", "SaskiaMitzka", "Hannah JillHunkler", "LisaHobu\u00df", "NaisamAbbas", "RobertGeffers", "JanWeusthoff", "KeXiao", "Danny DavidJonigk", "JanFiedler", "ThomasThum"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-022-00919-6\n10.1007/s00395-020-0816-0\n10.1093/nar/gky379\n10.1214/aos/1013699998\n10.1093/biomet/93.3.491\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.12.035\n10.1186/1471-2105-14-128\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01334\n10.1182/blood-2012-03-415307\n10.1038/srep42717\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.7554/eLife.43882\n10.1038/s41467-018-08003-1\n10.1038/s41467-020-14349-2\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1977.tb11256.x\n10.3390/ijms21134727\n10.1038/nature13737\n10.2147/DHPS.S224007\n10.1016/j.scr.2017.03.022\n10.1177/1087057105285610\n10.1093/nar/gkaa309\n10.1113/JP278131\n10.1093/cvr/cvab075\n10.1093/nar/gkw377\n10.1073/pnas.1422997112\n10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r29\n10.1101/gad.1767609\n10.1038/s41591-021-01452-0\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1002/cm.20418\n10.1038/s41556-019-0272-y\n10.1038/s41598-017-14843-6\n10.18129/B9.bioc.nanostringqcpro\n10.1093/nar/gkaa707\n10.1038/nrd2199\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw128\n10.1093/nar/gkx384\n10.1016/0165-6147(84)90480-2\n10.1007/s40268-017-0221-9\n10.15420/cfr.2016:25:2\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042559\n10.1093/molbev/msp112\n10.3389/fgene.2019.00421\n10.1038/nature07511\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1016/0014-5793(89)81546-7\n10.1038/nprot.2017.139\n10.1007/s00395-020-00822-y\n10.1038/s41598-017-08574-x\n10.1186/s12859-018-2531-5\n10.1177/108705719900400206"}

Advances in cardiac tissue engineering have expanded a highly efficacious platform to address cardiovascular events, especially cardiac infarction. Current efforts to overcome biocompatible limitations highlight the constructs of a conductive cardiac patch to accelerate the industrial and clinical landscape that is amenable for patient-accurate therapy, regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug delivery. With the notion that cardiac tissue synchronically contracts triggered by electrical pulses, the cardiac patches based on conductive materials are developed and treated on the dysfunctional heart. In this review, we systematically summarize distinct conductive materials serving as the most promising alternatives (conductive nanomaterials, conductive polymers, piezoelectric polymers, and ionic electrolytes) to achieve electric signal transmission and engineered cardiac tissues. Existing applications are discussed considering how these patches containing conductive candidates are fabricated into diverse forms with major strategies. Ultimately, we try to define a new concept as a bioelectricity-coupling patch that provides a favorable cardiac micro-environment for cardiac functional activities. Underlying challenges and prospects are presented regarding industrial processing and cardiovascular treatment of conductive patch progress.

Insulin regulates Ca2+ handling in cardiac tissue through NCX1, however how insulin changes NCX1 activity is poorly understood. Palmitoylation is the only post-translational modification identified to alter NCX1 activity. Here we show that insulin triggers local structural re-arrangements within existing NCX1 dimers by inducing their palmitoylation, thus tunes NCX1 inactivation through a zDHHC5-dependent mechanism in multiple cell types. By activating fatty acid and fatty acyl CoA synthesis insulin promotes palmitoylation of the zDHHC5 active site, which leads to enhanced NCX1 palmitoylation.

{"title": "A case of medical liability involving an unexpected systemic amyloidosis.", "abstract": "The authors present a case of fatal amyloid cardiomyopathy, which was diagnosed only upon autopsy. A 57-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for scheduled percutaneous cardiac procedure of transcatheter radiofrequency ablation due to persistent atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Ventricular fibrillation was recorded in the monitor 2\u00a0h after the surgical procedure. Therefore, he was defibrillated and intubated, but he died for nosocomial pneumonia 26\u00a0days after being admitted. A judicial autopsy was ordered by the prosecutor due to an alleged medical malpractice. The autopsy confirmed the cause of death being pneumonia, but also revealed an occult restrictive cardiomyopathy with a thick and firm myocardium. Viscera samples were then collected for microscopic examination. Histopathologic analysis showed diffuse amyloid deposits in the myocardium, especially in the perivascular and subendocardial spaces. Amyloid deposits were also detected in all the other organs, except for the brain. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry for light chains was performed on the heart tissue sample, resulting to be positive. In the case presented herein, autopsy and histopathologic examination were crucial to diagnose an occult systemic amyloidosis (AL-type). In fact, it has been observed that the rarity of systematic amyloidosis and its unusual clinical onset were at first mistakenly perceived as a medical malpractice due to a technical error within the catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. As a consequence, upon discussing the clinical and medicolegal implications concerning the case, the focus was placed on the undiagnosed systemic amyloidosis and on the causality between surgical procedure and the patient's death.", "journal": "Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "date": "2022-03-02", "authors": ["NicolaGalante", "BarbaraCiprandi", "LorenzoFranceschetti", "Biagio EugenioLeone", "StefaniaRiva", "AndreaGentilomo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.legalmed.2022.102049"}

However, the expression pattern of circRNAs in congenital heart disease (CHD) induced by formaldehyde exposure is still unknown. We detected circRNAs expression profiles in heart tissue taken from six neonatal rat pups with formaldehyde exposure group and normal group using RNA-sequencing. Results revealed that a total of 54 circRNAs were dysregulated in the formaldehyde exposure group compared to the normal group. Among them, 31 were upregulated and 23 were downregulated (fold change\u00a0=\u00a02.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0 5).

Here, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of Src in angiotensin II (AngII)-mediated cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy.\nThe heart conditional Src knockout mouse model was established and administrated with AngII. The effects of Src on the AngII-mediated cardiac hypertrophy were assessed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Masson's trichrome, immunohistochemical staining, Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection assay and Western blot analysis.\nThe expression levels of galectin-3, Src and the hypertrophy marker brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), as well as the phosphorylation of Src were all elevated in heart tissues of mice with AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Heart conditional Src knockout attenuated AngII-activated cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy in mice. Consistently, AngII could promote the expression of Src in a dose-dependent manner and the knockout of Src impaired Ang II-mediated apoptosis and fibrosis in the cardiomyocytes. In addition, Src inhibition suppressed the expression of galectin-3 in vivo and in vitro. Specifically, AngII could upregulate the expression of galectin-3, and knockdown of galectin-3 (Gal-3) remarkably inhibited AngII-enhanced apoptosis and fibrosis in the cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of galectin-3 reinforced Ang II-induced cell apoptosis and fibrosis that was attenuated by knockout of Src.\nOur findings indicate that Src and Gal-3 play an important role in AngII-mediated cardiac structural remodeling.

{"title": "Protective Effect of Rutin Trihydrate Against Dose-Dependent, Cisplatin-Induced Cardiac Toxicity in Isolated Perfused Rat's Heart.", "abstract": "Background Cisplatin is a common anticancer drug with potential cardiac and renal toxicities. Rutin, a natural compound present in various medicinal plants, has been shown to protect against chemotherapy-induced toxicities. In this study, we explored the protective effect of rutin against the dose-dependent cardiotoxic effects of cisplatin such as perfusion pressure, histopathologic effect on the myocardium, and oxidative stress in isolated perfused rat hearts. Methodology The cardiotoxic effects of cisplatin were studied at three dosages (1, 7, and 14 mg/L) in isolated perfused rat hearts. The dose-dependent, cisplatin-induced toxic effects on left ventricular pressure (LVP), heart rate (HR), dp/dt (maximum), dp/dt (minimum), perfusion pressure, pressure-time index, contractility index, and duration of diastole were assessed. The effects of cisplatin were measured one minute before perfusion of cisplatin and 60 minutes after perfusion of the isolated rat hearts. Results Cisplatin (1-14 mg/L) caused a significant (p < 0.05) dose-dependent reduction in LVP. The percentage LVP values reduced from 94 \u00b1 9 (control untreated hearts) to 70 \u00b1 6, 69 \u00b1 5, and 65 \u00b1 4 in hearts treated with 1, 7, and 14 mg/L of cisplatin, respectively. Similarly, cisplatin at similar doses caused a marked reduction in the values of dp/dt (maximum), dp/dt (minimum), and pressure-time index in isolated rat hearts. The respective percentage values of these parameters compared to those of untreated hearts were significantly reduced from 101 \u00b1 7 to 72 \u00b1 5, 92 \u00b1 8 to 69 \u00b1 4, and 92 \u00b1 12 to 57 \u00b1 7 in hearts treated with 14 mg/L of cisplatin. Perfusion of hearts with rutin trihydrate (1 \u00b5M/L) 10 minutes before administration of cisplatin and throughout the experiment attenuated the detrimental effects of cisplatin on cardiac functions in isolated rat hearts (p < 0.05). In addition, cisplatin-induced degeneration and necrosis of cardiac muscle cells reduced with the concurrent administration of rutin and restored normal heart histology. Moreover, cisplatin-induced reduction in glutathione and increased level of malondialdehyde in the myocardium was reversed by concurrent administration of rutin in isolated rat hearts. Conclusions Cisplatin produced a dose-dependent impairment of several parameters of cardiac function such as LVP, contractility index, and pressure-time index. It caused histopathological alterations in isolated rat hearts. These harmful effects of cisplatin were suppressed by rutin trihydrate, suggesting the potential protective effects of rutin against cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity. Rutin trihydrate also improved the reduced glutathione contents and suppressed the\u00a0malondialdehyde contents in the cardiac tissue of isolated rat hearts, suggesting that the observed beneficial effects of rutin trihydrate in this study could be related to its antioxidant properties.", "journal": "Cureus", "date": "2022-03-02", "authors": ["Ishfaq ABukhari", "Osama YMohamed", "Abdulrahman MAlhowikan", "RahmathunnisaLateef", "HananHagar", "Raghad AAssiri", "Wa'ad Massoud AAlqahtani"], "doi": "10.7759/cureus.21572"}
{"title": "In heart failure reactivation of RNA-binding proteins is associated with the expression of 1,523 fetal-specific isoforms.", "abstract": "Reactivation of fetal-specific genes and isoforms occurs during heart failure. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the extent to which the fetal program switch occurs remains unclear. Limitations hindering transcriptome-wide analyses of alternative splicing differences (i.e. isoform switching) in cardiovascular system (CVS) tissues between fetal, healthy adult and heart failure have included both cellular heterogeneity across bulk RNA-seq samples and limited availability of fetal tissue for research. To overcome these limitations, we have deconvoluted the cellular compositions of 996 RNA-seq samples representing heart failure, healthy adult (heart and arteria), and fetal-like (iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells) CVS tissues. Comparison of the expression profiles revealed that reactivation of fetal-specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and the accompanied re-expression of 1,523 fetal-specific isoforms, contribute to the transcriptome differences between heart failure and healthy adult heart. Of note, isoforms for 20 different RBPs were among those that reverted in heart failure to the fetal-like expression pattern. We determined that, compared with adult-specific isoforms, fetal-specific isoforms encode proteins that tend to have more functions, are more likely to harbor RBP binding sites, have canonical sequences at their splice sites, and contain typical upstream polypyrimidine tracts. Our study suggests that compared with healthy adult, fetal cardiac tissue requires stricter transcriptional regulation, and that during heart failure reversion to this stricter transcriptional regulation occurs. Furthermore, we provide a resource of cardiac developmental stage-specific and heart failure-associated genes and isoforms, which are largely unexplored and can be exploited to investigate novel therapeutics for heart failure.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2022-03-01", "authors": ["MatteoD'Antonio", "Jennifer PNguyen", "Timothy DArthur", "HirokoMatsui", "Margaret K RDonovan", "AgnieszkaD'Antonio-Chronowska", "Kelly AFrazer"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009918\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.857011\n10.1038/ncomms4603\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000135591.37759.AF\n10.1161/01.cir.0000029803.93022.93\n10.1172/JCI84015\n10.1101/gr.220517.117\n10.1073/pnas.0809045105\n10.1007/s11626-013-9708-z\n10.1038/s41418-017-0029-8\n10.1038/s41467-019-13598-0\n10.1038/s41467-020-20327-5\n10.1038/nrm.2017.27\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw567\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.09.011\n10.1038/s41467-020-14561-0\n10.1038/s41588-019-0499-3\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305365\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02118.x\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003863\n10.1007/s00246-019-02165-5\n10.1126/science.aaz1776\n10.1161/JAHA.116.005135\n10.1006/geno.1994.1271\n10.1111/gtc.12201\n10.1186/1471-213X-10-54\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1038/nbt.4096\n10.1182/blood-2016-05-716480\n10.1038/nmeth.4402\n10.1038/s41586-020-2077-3\n10.1038/nature12311\n10.1093/nar/gku406\n10.1038/onc.2012.490\n10.1073/pnas.1609552114\n10.7554/eLife.24139\n10.1074/jbc.M109.032946\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031947\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.05.038\n10.1093/cvr/cvw192\n10.1038/nm.2693\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.301496\n10.7554/eLife.33057\n10.1093/database/baz161\n10.1038/ncb3442\n10.1091/mbc.E13-06-0339\n10.1128/MCB.21.10.3281-3288.2001\n10.1093/nar/gku744\n10.1038/nrg.2016.46\n10.1038/s41586-018-0590-4\n10.1038/s41587-019-0114-2\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045401\n10.1093/hmg/ddv004\n10.1159/000335755\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.320080\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.08.025\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1003445\n10.1038/celldisc.2016.50\n10.1186/s13395-019-0211-4\n10.1016/j.ccell.2018.06.007\n10.1007/s10741-007-9034-1\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05100.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.039596\n10.1007/s13238-018-0578-8\n10.1007/s13238-018-0590-z\n10.1074/jbc.M407340200\n10.1161/01.RES.0000115522.52554.86\n10.1161/01.res.86.11.1114\n10.1083/jcb.138.3.575\n10.1002/wrna.1465\n10.1038/s41467-020-16504-1\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005198\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1004684\n10.1161/hc4901.100526\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.047\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.07.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.314951\n10.15430/JCP.2017.22.4.203\n10.1172/JCI32044\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-17-0134\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2073\n10.1021/cb500851u\n10.21769/BioProtoc.3755\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.03.012\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.06.091\n10.1038/s41467-020-16482-4\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.03.009\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.1093/nar/gky955\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btv098\n10.1186/1471-2105-12-323\n10.1093/gigascience/giy083\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.05.004\n10.1093/nar/gks042\n10.1086/519795\n10.1016/j.acvd.2013.08.003\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2017-104780\n10.1038/ncomms11067"}

Due to the limited regeneration capacity of adult heart tissue, CVDs are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Even though there are surgical and pharmacological treatments for CVDs, regenerative strategies are the most promising approaches and have the potential to benefit millions of people. As in any other tissue engineering approach, the repair and regeneration of damaged cardiac tissues generally involve scaffolds made up of biodegradable and biocompatible materials, cellular components such as stem cells, and growth factors. This review provides an overview of biomaterial-based tissue engineering approaches for CVDs with a specific focus on the potential of 2D materials. It is essential to consider both physicochemical and immunomodulatory properties for evaluating the applicability of 2D materials in cardiac tissue repair and regeneration.

The restrictive physiology of the disease usually prompts investigation; however, if allowed to progress, the systolic function becomes affected in the later stages of the disease.

{"title": "Hypoxia Promotes Neutrophil Survival After Acute Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Phagocytosis, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation build the armory of neutrophils for the first line of defense against invading pathogens. All these processes are modulated by the microenvironment including tonicity, pH and oxygen levels. Here we investigated the neutrophil infiltration in cardiac tissue autopsy samples of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and compared these with tissues from patients with sepsis, endocarditis, dermal inflammation, abscesses and diseases with prominent neutrophil infiltration. We observed many neutrophils infiltrating the heart muscle after myocardial infarction. Most of these had viable morphology and only few showed signs of nuclear de-condensation, a hallmark of early NET formation. The abundance of NETs was the lowest in acute myocardial infarction when compared to other examined diseases. Since cardiac oxygen supply is abruptly abrogated in acute myocardial infarction, we hypothesized that the resulting tissue hypoxia increased the longevity of the neutrophils. Indeed, the viable cells showed increased nuclear hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) content, and only neutrophils with low HIF-1\u03b1 started the process of NET formation (chromatin de-condensation and nuclear swelling).

Cardiac hypertrophy is one of the most common risk factors for heart failure. However, whether SiNPs involved in cardiac hypertrophy and the underlying mechanisms was remained unexploited. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of SiNPs on pyroptosis and cardiac hypertrophy. The in vivo results found that SiNPs induced ultrastructural change and histopathological damage, accompanied by oxidative damage occurred and increased levels of inflammatory factors (IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2) in heart tissue.

For in vitro study, SiNPs increased the intracellular ROS generation and activated the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes. Whereas, the NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor VAS2870 had effectively inhibited the ROS level and suppressed the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Pro-Caspase-1, Cleaved-Caspase-1, N-GSDMD, IL-18, Cleaved-IL-1\u03b2, ANP, BNP and \u03b2-MHC. Moreover, transfected with si-NLRP3 or adopted with Caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 in cardiomyocytes showed an inhibitory effect on SiNPs-induced pyroptosis and cardiac hypertrophy.

The staged surgical palliation (Fontan principle) results in a circulation in which venous return is conducted to the pulmonary arteries via passive laminar flow. We aimed to generate a contractile subpulmonary neo-ventricle from engineered heart tissue (EHT) to drive pulmonary flow actively.\nA three-dimensional tubular EHT (1.8-cm length, 6-mm inner diameter, ca. 1-mm wall thickness) was created by casting human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (0.9 ml, 18 mio/ml) embedded in a fibrin-based hydrogel around a silicone tube. EHTs were cultured under continuous, pulsatile flow through the silicone tube for 23 days.\nThe constructs started to beat macroscopically at days 8-14 and remained stable in size and shape over the whole culture period. Tubular EHTs showed a coherent beating pattern after 23 days in culture, and isovolumetric pressure measurements demonstrated a coherent pulsatile wave formation with an average frequency of 77 \u00b1 5 beats/min and an average pressure of 0.2 mmHg. Histological analysis revealed cardiomyocytes mainly localized along the inner and outer curvature of the tubular wall with mainly longitudinal alignment. Cell density in the center of the tubular wall was lower.\nA simple tube-shaped contractile EHT was generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells and developed a synchronous beating pattern.

{"title": "Lyotropic Liquid Crystals: A Biocompatible and Safe Material for Local Cardiac Application.", "abstract": "The regeneration of cardiac tissue is a multidisciplinary research field aiming to improve the health condition of the post-heart attack patient. Indeed, myocardial tissue has a poor ability to self-regenerate after severe damage. The scientific efforts focused on the research of a biomaterial able to adapt to heart tissue, thus guaranteeing the in situ release of active substances or growth promoters. Many types of hydrogels were proposed for this purpose, showing several limitations. The aim of this study was to suggest a new usage for glyceryl monooleate-based lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) as a biocompatible and inert material for a myocardial application. The main advantages of LLCs are mainly related to their easy in situ injection as lamellar phase and their instant in situ transition in the cubic phase. In vivo studies proved the biocompatibility and the inertia of LLCs after their application on the myocardial tissue of mice.

Fluvastatin (FV) is a fully synthetic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor used as a cholesterol-lowering agent in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Previous studies revealed that FV also exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activity. Additionally, our previous study indicated that FV exerts a prophylactic effect on DOXO-induced testicular toxicity by preventing lipid peroxidation, supporting the antioxidant system, and regulating the blood-testis barrier-associated genes expression. Herein, we purposed to evaluate the possible therapeutic and the protective effects of FV on the DOXO-induced cardiac and renal toxicitiy model by histochemical, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) analyses. Results point out protective use of FV exerts a beneficial effect by repressing lipid peroxidation and by regulating the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide synthase endothelial (eNOS), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB), and Caspase-3 (Casp3) protein and mRNA expressions, which play an important role in mediating DOXO-induced renal and cardiac toxicity mechanisms.

Exploiting the spatial entanglement of photon pairs, it allows decoupling of the sensing and detection wavelengths, facilitating imaging in otherwise challenging spectral regions by leveraging mature silicon-based detection technology. All existing implementations of QIUP have so far utilised the momentum correlations within the biphoton states produced by spontaneous parametric downconversion. Here, for the first time, we implement and examine theoretically and numerically the complementary scenario - utilising the tight position correlations formed within photon pairs at birth. This image plane arrangement facilitates high resolution imaging with comparative experimental ease, and we experimentally show resolutions below 10 \u03bcm at a sensing wavelength of 3.7 \u03bcm. Moreover, we present a quantitative numerical model predicting the imaging capabilities of QIUP for a wide range of parameters. Finally, by imaging mouse heart tissue at the mid-IR to reveal morphological features on the cellular level, we further demonstrate the viability of this technique for the life sciences.

The modular and versatile EHT platform presented here allows for the formation of three tissues per well in a 12-well plate format, resulting in 36 tissues per plate. We compared the functional performance of EHTs and their histology in three different media and demonstrated that tissues cultured and maintained in maturation medium, containing triiodothyronine (T3), dexamethasone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (TDI), resulted in a higher force of contraction, sarcomeric organization and alignment, and a higher and lower inotropic response to isoproterenol and nifedipine, respectively.

{"title": "Phenotypic and Functional Heterogeneity of Monocyte Subsets in Chronic Heart Failure Patients.", "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) results when the heart cannot consistently supply the body's tissues with oxygen and required nutrients. CHF can be categorized as heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). There are different causes and mechanisms underlying HF pathogenesis; however, inflammation can be regarded as one of the factors that promotes both HFrEF and HFpEF. Monocytes, a subgroup of leukocytes, are known to be cellular mediators in response to cardiovascular injury and are closely related to inflammatory reactions. These cells are a vital component of the immune system and are the source of macrophages, which participate in cardiac tissue repair after injury. However, these monocytes are not as homogenous as thought and can present different functions under different cardiovascular disease conditions. In addition, there is still an open question regarding whether the functions of monocytes and macrophages should be regarded as causes or consequences in CHF development.

{"title": "Identification of the NADPH Oxidase (Nox) Subtype and the Source of Superoxide Production in the Micturition Centre.", "abstract": "Oxidative inflammatory damage to specialised brain centres may lead to dysfunction of their associated peripheral organs, such as the bladder. However, the source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in specific brain regions that regulate bladder function is poorly understood. Of all ROS-generating enzymes, the NADPH oxidase (Nox) family produces ROS as its sole function and offers an advantage over other enzymes as a drug-targetable molecule to selectively control excessive ROS. We investigated whether the Nox 2 subtype is expressed in the micturition regulatory periaqueductal gray (PAG) and Barrington's nucleus (pontine micturition centre, PMC) and examined Nox-derived ROS production in these structures. C57BL/6J mice were used; PAG, PMC, cardiac tissue, and aorta were isolated. Western blot determined Nox 2 expression. Lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence quantified real-time superoxide production. Western blot experiments demonstrated the presence of Nox 2 in PAG and PMC. There was significant NADPH-dependent superoxide production in both brain tissues, higher than that in cardiac tissue. Superoxide generation in these brain tissues was significantly suppressed by the Nox inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and also reduced by the Nox-2 specific inhibitor GSK2795039, comparable to aorta.

{"title": "Activation of Immune System May Cause Pathophysiological Changes in the Myocardium of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Monkey Model.", "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is an extremely contagious disease whereby the virus damages the host's respiratory tract via entering through the ACE2 receptor. Cardiovascular disorder is being recognized in the majority of COVID-19 patients; yet, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and heart failure has not been established. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was induced in the monkey model. Thereafter, heart tissue samples were collected, and pathological changes were analyzed in the left ventricular tissue by hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining specific to T lymphocytes and macrophages. The findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces several pathological changes in the heart, which cause cardiomyocyte disarray, mononuclear infiltrates of inflammatory cells, and hypertrophy. Furthermore, collagen-specific staining showed the development of cardiac fibrosis in the interstitial and perivascular regions in the hearts of infected primates. Moreover, the myocardial tissue samples displayed multiple foci of inflammatory cells positive for T lymphocytes and macrophages within the myocardium.

{"title": "The fungicide Tebuconazole induces electromechanical cardiotoxicity in murine heart and human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Tebuconazole (TEB) is an important fungicide that belongs to the triazole family. It is widely used in agriculture and its use has experienced a tremendous increase in the last decade. The long-term exposure of humans to this pesticide is a real threat because it is stable in water and soil. The association between long-term exposure to TEB and damage of several biological systems, including hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity is evident, however, acute toxicological studies to reveal the toxicity of TEB are limited. This research paper addressed the acute exposure of TEB in murine hearts, cardiomyocytes, and human cardiomyocytes derived from an induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC-CMs), spelling out TEB's impact on electromechanical properties of the cardiac tissue. In ex vivo experiments, TEB dose dependently, caused significant electrocardiogram (ECG) remodeling with prolonged PR and QTc interval duration. The TEB was also able to change the action potential waveform in murine cardiomyocytes and hiPSC-CMs. These effects were associated with the ability of the compound to block the L-type calcium current (IC", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2022-02-25", "authors": ["ArturSantos-Miranda", "Julliane VJoviano-Santos", "TaynaraCruz-Nascimento", "Elida AdalgisaNeri", "Diego SantosSouza", "Leisiane PereiraMarques", "Jose EKrieger", "DaniloRoman-Campos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxlet.2022.02.005"}

In this study we utilized multiple imaging techniques to follow the sequence of sarcomere disassembly during mitosis resulting in cellular or nuclear division in a source of proliferating human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). We observed that both mono- and binuclear hiPSC-CMs give rise to mononuclear daughter cells or binuclear progeny. Within this source of highly proliferative hiPSC-CMs, treated with the CHIR99021 small molecule, we found that Wnt and Hippo signaling was more present when compared to metabolic matured non-proliferative hiPSC-CMs and adult human heart tissue. Furthermore, we found that CHIR99021 increased the efficiency of non-viral vector incorporation in high-proliferative hiPSC-CMs, in which fluorescent transgene expression became present after the chromosomal segregation (M phase). This study provides a tool for gene manipulation studies in hiPSC-CMs and engineered cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Development of an Injectable Shear-Thinning Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer a promising therapeutic method for cardiac tissue regeneration. However, to monitor the fate of MSCs for tissue repair, a better stem cell delivery carrier is needed. Developing a unique injectable and shear-thinning dual cross-linked hybrid hydrogel for MSC delivery for cardiac tissue engineering is highly desirable. This hydrogel was synthesised using guest: host reaction based on alginate-cyclodextrin (Alg-CD) and adamantane-graphene oxide (Ad-GO). Here, the role of macromere concentration (10 and 12%) on the MSC function is discussed. Our hybrid hydrogels reveal a suitable oxygen pathway required for cell survival. However, this value is strongly dependent on the macromere concentrations, while the hydrogels with 12% macromere concentration (2DC12) significantly enhanced the oxygen permeability value (1.16-fold). Moreover, after two weeks of culture, rat MSCs (rMSCs) encapsulated in Alg-GO hydrogels expressed troponin T (TNT) and GATA4 markers. Noticeably, the 2DC12 hydrogels enhance rMSCs differentiation markers (1.30-times for TNT and 1.21-times for GATA4). Overall, our findings indicate that tuning the hydrogel compositions regulates the fate of encapsulated rMSCs within hydrogels.

Despite the development of various cultivation strategies, a sufficiently high degree of maturation is still a decisive limiting factor for the successful application of these cardiac cells. The maturation process includes, among others, the proper formation of sarcomere structures, mediating the contraction of cardiomyocytes. To precisely monitor the maturation of the contractile machinery, we have established an imaging-based strategy that allows quantitative evaluation of important parameters, defining the quality of the sarcomere network. iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were subjected to different culture conditions to improve sarcomere formation, including prolonged cultivation time and micro patterned surfaces. Fluorescent images of \u03b1-actinin were acquired using super-resolution microscopy. Subsequently, we determined cell morphology, sarcomere density, filament alignment, z-Disc thickness and sarcomere length of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Cells from adult and neonatal heart tissue served as control. Our image analysis revealed a profound effect on sarcomere content and filament orientation when iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were cultured on structured, line-shaped surfaces. Similarly, prolonged cultivation time had a beneficial effect on the structural maturation, leading to a more adult-like phenotype. Automatic evaluation of the sarcomere filaments by machine learning validated our data. Moreover, we successfully transferred this approach to skeletal muscle cells, showing an improved sarcomere formation cells over different differentiation periods. Overall, our image-based workflow can be used as a straight-forward tool to quantitatively estimate the structural maturation of contractile cells. As such, it can support the establishment of novel differentiation protocols to enhance sarcomere formation and maturity.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS", "date": "2022-02-25", "authors": ["AnnaSkorska", "LisaJohann", "OleksandraChabanovska", "PraveenVasudevan", "SophieKussauer", "MaximilianHillemanns", "MarkusWolfien", "AnikaJonitz-Heincke", "OlafWolkenhauer", "RainerBader", "HermannLang", "RobertDavid", "HeikoLemcke"], "doi": "10.1007/s00018-022-04196-3\n10.3791/61605\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00021.2020\n10.1177/1535370217701006\n10.1152/physrev.00040.2017"}

While regular exercise restored the increase in p-PERK expression associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress and decrease in mitophagic marker PINK1 expression, resveratrol only ameliorated PINK1 expression in hypertensive rats. Resveratrol and exercise training suppressed hypertension-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation by reversing the increase in NLRP3, p-NF-\u03baB expression and the mature-IL-1\u03b2/pro-IL-1\u03b2 and cleaved-caspase-1/pro-caspase-1 ratio. Resveratrol and exercise enhanced mRNA expression of caspase-3, bax, and bcl-2 involved in the apoptotic pathway, but attenuated phosphorylation of stress-related mitogenic proteins p38 and JNK induced by hypertension.\nOur study demonstrated the protective effect of resveratrol and exercise on hypertension-induced cardiac dysfunction by modulating cellular stress responses including oxidative stress, ER stress, mitophagy, NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation, and mitogenic activation.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2022-02-24", "authors": ["Nur BanuBal", "AykutBostanci", "G\u00f6khanSadi", "Muhammet OguzhanD\u00f6nmez", "Mecit OrhanUludag", "EmineDemirel-Yilmaz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120424"}

L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (LTCC) density and dysfunction is a critical player in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, the underlying cellular mechanisms by which CRBN regulates LTCC subtype Cav1.2\u03b1 during cardiac dysfunction remain unclear. Here, we explored the role of CRBN in HFrEF by investigating the direct regulatory role of CRBN in Cav1.2\u03b1 activity and examining how it can serve as a target to address myocardial dysfunction.\nCardiac tissues from HFrEF patients exhibited increased levels of CRBN compared with controls. In vivo and ex vivo studies demonstrated that whole-body CRBN knockout (CRBN-/-) and cardiac-specific knockout mice (Crbnfl/fl/Myh6Cre+) exhibited enhanced cardiac contractility with increased LTCC current (ICaL) compared with their respective controls, which was modulated by the direct interaction of CRBN with Cav1.2\u03b1. Mechanistically, the Lon domain of CRBN directly interacted with the N-terminal of Cav1.2\u03b1. Increasing CRBN levels enhanced the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Cav1.2\u03b1 and decreased ICaL. In contrast, genetic or pharmacological depletion of CRBN via TD-165, a novel PROTAC-based CRBN degrader, increased surface expression of Cav1.2\u03b1 and enhanced ICaL. Low CRBN levels protected the heart against cardiomyopathy in vivo.\nCereblon selectively degrades Cav1.2\u03b1, which in turn facilitates cardiac dysfunction.

Current treatment options have shown limited success in preventing morbidity and mortality and the need for alternative therapeutic options is evident. Accumulating evidence points to the rising role of stem cell-derived exosomes as potential sources for treatment of ischemic heart disease. Exosomes are nano-scale (50-150\u00a0nm), membrane-bound extracellular vesicles that contain a variety of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites and can be released from almost every cell type in the body, including but not restricted to cardiac cells, immune cells, and stem cells. In this review exosomes derived from stem cells which may have potential application in ischemic heart disease are classified based on their source: mesenchymal, adipose, cardiac, and circulating endothelial progenitor stem cells. Alterations in exosome cargo, for instance through regulation of certain miRNAs, may regulate the cross-talk among cardiac cells and usually result in enhanced cardioprotective properties through various signaling mechanisms, leading to enhancement of angiogenesis, prevention of apoptosis and reducing fibrosis. However, many critical challenges remain in translation of exosomes-assisted therapies such as lack of a unified method for exosome isolation and characterization, finding the optimal cell culture conditions, proper route of administration, targeted delivery of exosomes to cardiac tissue, and difficulties with production and storage of exosomes in large numbers.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2022-02-22", "authors": ["Negar RaissiDehkordi", "Nastaran RaissiDehkordi", "Mohammad HadiFarjoo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.174839"}

{"title": "Unique Angiogenesis From Cardiac Arterioles During Pericardial Adhesion Formation.", "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying post-operative pericardial adhesions remain poorly understood. We aimed to unveil the temporal molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying tissue dynamics during adhesion formation, including inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis.\nWe visualized cell-based tissue dynamics during pericardial adhesion using histological evaluations. To determine the molecular mechanism, RNA-seq was performed. Chemical inhibitors were administered to confirm the molecular mechanism underlying adhesion formation. A high degree of adhesion formation was observed during the stages in which collagen production was promoted. Histological analyses showed that arterioles excessively sprouted from pericardial tissues after the accumulation of neutrophils on the heart surface in mice as well as humans. The combination of RNA-seq and histological analyses revealed that hyperproliferative endothelial and smooth muscle cells with dedifferentiation appeared in cytokine-exposed sprouting vessels and adhesion tissue but not in quiescent vessels in the heart. SMAD2/3 and ERK activation was observed in sprouting vessels. The simultaneous abrogation of PI3K/ERK or TGF-\u03b2/MMP9 signaling significantly decreased angiogenic sprouting, followed by inhibition of adhesion formation. Depleting MMP9-positive neutrophils shortened mice survival and decreased angiogenic sprouting and fibrosis in the adhesion. Our data suggest that TGF-\u03b2/matrix metalloproteinase-dependent tissue remodeling and PI3K/ERK signaling activation might contribute to unique angiogenesis with dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells from the contractile to the synthetic phenotype for fibrosis in the pericardial cavity.\nOur findings provide new insights in developing prevention strategies for pericardial adhesions by targeting the recruitment of vascular cells from heart tissues.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-02-22", "authors": ["KenjiNamiguchi", "TomohisaSakaue", "MikioOkazaki", "KahoKanno", "YuheiKomoda", "FumiakiShikata", "MieKurata", "NoritakaOta", "YoshiakiKubota", "HirotsuguKurobe", "TakashiNishimura", "JunyaMasumoto", "ShigekiHigashiyama", "HironoriIzutani"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2021.761591\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.02.071\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.08.060\n10.3390/ijms21228610\n10.1016/S1357-2725(03)00242-5\n10.1038/s41467-020-16893-3\n10.1016/0003-4975(94)92224-1\n10.1002/aja.1001800408\n10.1016/0002-9149(80)90424-5\n10.1056/NEJM199512283332608\n10.1167/iovs.10-5176\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.025\n10.1093/jb/mvx051\n10.1242/dev.093351\n10.1080/110241599750007810\n10.1152/ajprenal.00300.2002\n10.3390/ijms21124271\n10.1007/PL00001993\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.11.075\n10.1186/s13019-019-0940-9\n10.1186/s12964-020-00678-8\n10.1038/s41467-020-18125-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011429\n10.1038/35036374\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.11.020\n10.4330/wjc.v10.i9.87\n10.1111/jcmm.13511\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa012\n10.1038/s41569-019-0227-9\n10.3390/ijms21134688\n10.1016/j.jvs.2007.03.001\n10.1016/j.pupt.2012.08.005\n10.1097/MOL.0000000000000113\n10.1038/srep33407\n10.1073/pnas.0601807103\n10.1073/pnas.0712185105\n10.1152/ajplung.00015.2014\n10.1093/ndt/gfv321\n10.1007/s11010-014-2151-y\n10.1016/j.biocel.2015.10.015\n10.4196/kjpp.2015.19.6.499\n10.1074/jbc.M703125200\n10.1096/fj.201802811R\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000096482.02567.8C\n10.3892/ijmm.11.2.229\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.04.115\n10.1074/jbc.M008570200"}

In addition, our recent studies have suggested that pinocembrin could decrease the susceptibility to arrhythmias in several rat models, including chronic ischemic heart failure, myocardial infarction and depression. In this research, the effects of pinocembrin on ventricular fibrillation (VF) susceptibility were investigated in rats treated with isoproterenol (ISO) and further explored the possible mechanism.\nCardiac remodeling was induced by intraperitoneally injection ISO (5\u00a0mg/kg) 7 days. Simultaneously, Rats were received pinocembrin (5\u00a0mg/kg) or saline by tail vein injection. The effects of pinocembrin were evaluated by electrocardiogram parameters, ventricular electrophysiological parameters, echocardiographic, western blot, ventricular histology, biochemical examinations. In vitro, we cultured H9C2 cardiomyocytes to further define the mechanisms.\nCompared with ISO group, pinocembrin remarkably decreased VF inducibility rate, attenuated the shortening of QT and corrected QT (QTc) interval, action potential duration (APD), ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), and increased the protein levels of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 and Cav1.2 and decreased phosphorylated Ca\nOur data demonstrate that pinocembrin decreases ventricular electrical remodeling, ion remodeling, ventricular fibrosis, hypertrophy and suppresses isoproterenol-induced oxidative stress.

The main objective of this work is to compare two approaches for modelling the active contraction during the electromechanically coupled rat cardiac cycle -- the stress and the stress-strain approach. Firstly, a cylindrical benchmark is considered and secondly, for a generic model of a rat left ventricle, a simulation including the Windkessel model, excitation via Purkinje fibre network and mechano-electrical feedback is performed. The model is calibrated with experimental data for rats, partly from own measurements via cardiac ultrasound, partly from the literature. Further, possibilities to reach higher ejection fractions are discussed and considered for an exemplary rat left ventricle. Within each approach, we observe regionally different active stresses and fibre stretches. Moreover, the transmural active stress and fibre stretch distribution is influenced by the pressure load on the endocardial surface. The active stress approach is not sensitive to the fibre stretch and transmurally varying fibre stretch in the left ventricular domain is observed. The active stress-strain approach leads to transmurally more homogeneous fibre stretch at the end-systolic state.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2022-02-20", "authors": ["DenisaMartonov\u00e1", "DavidHolz", "JuliaSeufert", "Minh TuanDuong", "MuhannadAlkassar", "SigridLeyendecker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.110980"}
{"title": "Proteomic analysis reveals rattlesnake venom modulation of proteins associated with cardiac tissue damage in mouse hearts.", "abstract": "Snake envenomation is a common but neglected disease that affects millions of people around the world annually. Among venomous snake species in Brazil, the tropical rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus) accounts for the highest number of fatal envenomations and is responsible for the second highest number of bites. Snake venoms are complex secretions which, upon injection, trigger diverse physiological effects that can cause significant injury or death. The components of C. d. terrificus venom exhibit neurotoxic, myotoxic, hemotoxic, nephrotoxic, and cardiotoxic properties which present clinically as alteration of central nervous system function, motor paralysis, seizures, eyelid ptosis, ophthalmoplesia, blurred vision, coagulation disorders, rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and cardiorespiratory arrest. In this study, we focused on proteomic characterization of the cardiotoxic effects of C. d. terrificus venom in mouse models. We injected venom at half the lethal dose (LD50) into the gastrocnemius muscle. Mouse hearts were removed at set time points after venom injection (1\u00a0h, 6\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, or 24\u00a0h) and subjected to trypsin digestion prior to high-resolution mass spectrometry. We analyzed the proteomic profiles of >1300 proteins and observed that several proteins showed noteworthy changes in their quantitative profiles, likely reflecting the toxic activity of venom components. Among the affected proteins were several associated with cellular deregulation and tissue damage. Changes in heart protein abundance offer insights into how they may work synergistically upon envenomation. SIGNIFICANCE: Venom of the tropical rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terririficus) is known to be neurotoxic, myotoxic, nephrotoxic and cardiotoxic. Although there are several studies describing the biochemical effects of this venom, no work has yet described its proteomic effects in the cardiac tissue of mice.

{"title": "Digital RNA-seq analysis of the cardiac transcriptome response to thermal stress in turbot Scophthalmus maximus.", "abstract": "The hearts of fish play a major role in their physiological plasticity and acclimation to different thermal conditions. To understand the precise mechanism and the pathways activated by thermal cardiac stress in fish, we sampled cardiac tissue from juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) exposed to control (14\u00b0C) and test (20\u00b0C, 24\u00b0C, and 28\u00b0C) conditions, and performed digital RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A total of 3359 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The results of an expression tendency analysis and KEGG annotation analysis of the DEGs demonstrated that energy metabolism played a core role in thermal stress in turbot for the majority of the up-regulated genes. This was followed by lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, glycolysis, and carbohydrate metabolism. RNA modifications are gaining the interest of biologists worldwide. In this study, at the transcriptome level, our results showed that 246 m6A-containing genes were detected in the DEGs, which were related to EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3J, METTL16, RBM15B, VIRMA, and YTHDC1.

{"title": "Human-derived decellularized extracellular matrix scaffold incorporating autologous bone marrow stem cells from patients with congenital heart disease for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Stem cells are used as an alternative treatment option for patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) due to their regenerative potential, but they are subject to low retention rate in the injured myocardium. Also, the diseased microenvironment in the injured myocardium may not provide healthy cues for optimal stem cell function.\nIn this study, we prepared a novel human-derived cardiac scaffold to improve the functional behaviors of stem cells.\nDecellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds were fabricated by removing cells of human-derived cardiac appendage tissues. Then, bone marrow c-kit+ progenitor cells from patients with congenital heart disease were seeded on the cardiac ECM scaffolds. Cell adhesion, survival, proliferation and cardiac differentiation on human cardiac decellularized ECM scaffold were evaluated in\u00a0vitro. Label-free mass spectrometry was applied to analyze cardiac ECM proteins regulating cell behaviors.\nIt was shown that cardiac ECM scaffolds promoted stem cell adhesion and proliferation. Importantly, bone marrow c-kit+ progenitor cells cultured on cardiac ECM scaffold for 14 days differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells without supplement with any inducible factors, as confirmed by the increased protein level of Gata4 and upregulated gene levels of Gata4, Nkx2.5, and cTnT. Proteomic analysis showed the proteins in cardiac ECM functioned in multiple biological activities, including regulation of cell proliferation, regulation of cell differentiation, and cardiovascular system development.\nThe human-derived cardiac scaffold constructed in this study may help repair the damaged myocardium and hold great potential for tissue engineering application in pediatric patients with CHD.", "journal": "Bio-medical materials and engineering", "date": "2022-02-19", "authors": ["LipingGao", "XuexiaLi", "RubinTan", "JieCui", "SebastianSchmull"], "doi": "10.3233/BME-211368"}
{"title": "Extracellular vesicle-mediated bidirectional communication between heart and other organs.", "abstract": "In recent years, a wealth of studies has identified various molecular species released by cardiac muscle under physiological and pathological conditions that exert local paracrine and/or remote endocrine effects. Conversely, humoral factors, principally produced by organs such as skeletal muscle, kidney, or adipose tissue, may affect the function and metabolism of normal and diseased hearts. Although this cross communication within cardiac tissue and between the heart and other organs is supported by mounting evidence, research on the role of molecular mediators carried by exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, collectively defined as extracellular vesicles (EVs), is at an early stage of investigation. Once released in the circulation, EVs can potentially reach any organ where they transfer their cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that exert potent biological effects on recipient cells. Although there are a few cases where such signaling was clearly demonstrated, the results from many other studies can only be tentatively inferred based on indirect evidence obtained by infusing exogenous EVs in experimental animals or by adding them to cell cultures. This area of research is in rapid expansion and most mechanistic interpretations may change in the near future; hence, the present review on the role played by EV-carried mediators in the two-way communication between heart and skeletal muscle, kidneys, bone marrow, lungs, liver, adipose tissue, and brain is necessarily limited.

Twenty-four hours after the last administration, we measured the serum biochemical indexes of mice to evaluate the detoxification effect. Furthermore, we determined the expression of key proteins of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in mouse heart tissue by Western blot and some oxidation/antioxidation-related indexes by corresponding kits to explore the detoxification mechanism. The administration of the raw product elevated the levels of serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and malondialdehyde, a product of cardiac lipid peroxidation(P&lt;0.01), down-regulated the protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1(P&lt;0.01), and reduced the levels of total superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase(P&lt;0.01). However, after the administration of the products stir-fried with JQC, LD, BS, GC, and CZ, the abnormalities of the above indexes induced by the raw product were recovered(P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). In particular, the product stir-fried with JQC showed the best performance. Taken all together, the cardiotoxicity induced by radix T. wilfordii could be attenuated by stir-frying with JQC, LD, BS, GC, and CZ, and the stir-frying with JQC showed the best detoxification effect. The mechanism might be associated with the cardiac antioxidant defense and oxidative damage mitigation mediated by the up-regulated Nrf2.", "journal": "Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica", "date": "2022-02-19", "authors": ["Ling-LingSong", "Jun-MingWang", "Yue-ChenGuan", "Yan-MeiWang", "Ming-ZhuGong", "Bing-YinLi"], "doi": "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210924.301"}

The cisplatin-treated mice at 3\u00a0mg/kg for four times on the 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th day, and in them appeared a serious cardiac damage accompanied with the increase in indicators of heart damage. Multiple exposure of 3\u00a0mg/kg for four times of cisplatin increased cardiac cells apoptosis with increased expression of Bax and cleaved-caspase 3, and decreased expression of Bcl-2. Interestingly, supplement of maltol at doses of 50 and 100\u2009mg/kg for 15\u2009days significantly suppressed the cardiac disturbance. In cultured H9C2 cells, maltol enhanced PI3K/Akt expression level during cisplatin treatment, and reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Notably, inhibition of PI3K/Akt by LY294002 and HY-10249A lessened the efficacy of maltol. In mice, maltol apparently induced PI3K/Akt in heart tissues and protected against cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, maltol exerted the protective effects against cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity, at least partially by inhibiting the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes, to ease oxidative stress, and alleviate reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis.", "journal": "Phytotherapy research : PTR", "date": "2022-02-18", "authors": ["Jing-JingXing", "Xiao-JieMi", "Jin-GangHou", "En-BoCai", "Si-WenZheng", "Shi-HanWang", "ZiWang", "ChenChen", "WeiLi"], "doi": "10.1002/ptr.7405"}

This study sought to investigate the electrophysiological characteristics of acute RF lesions in the left ventricle (LV) visualized with native-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\nAn MR-guided electrophysiology system was used to deliver RF ablation in the LV of 8 swine (9 RF lesions in total), then perform MRI and electroanatomic mapping. The permanent RF lesions and transient edema were delineated via native-contrast MRI segmentation of T1-weighted images and T2 maps respectively. Bipolar voltage measurements were matched with image characteristics of pixels adjacent to the catheter tip. Native-contrast MR visualization was verified with 3D late gadolinium enhanced MRI and histology.\nThe T2-derived edema was significantly larger than the T1-derived RF lesion (2.1 \u00b11.5 mL compared to 0.58 \u00b10.34 mL; p=0.01). Bipolar voltage was significantly reduced in the presence of RF lesion core (p 0.05) and edema (p 0.05), with similar trends suggesting that both the permanent lesion and transient edema contributed to the region of reduced voltage. While bipolar voltage was significantly decreased where RF lesions are present (p 0.05), voltage did not change significantly with lesion transmurality (p 0.05).\nPermanent RF lesions and transient edema are distinct in native-contrast MR images, but not differentiable using bipolar voltage.\nIntraprocedural native-contrast MRI may provide valuable lesion assessment in MR-guided ablation, whose clinical application is now feasible.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2022-02-17", "authors": ["Philippa R PKrahn", "LabonnyBiswas", "SebastianFerguson", "VenkatRamanan", "JenniferBarry", "Sheldon MSingh", "MihaelaPop", "Graham AWright"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2022.3152145"}
{"title": "GSK-3\u03b2 Localizes to the Cardiac Z-Disc to Maintain Length Dependent Activation.", "abstract": "Altered kinase localization is gaining appreciation as a mechanism of cardiovascular disease. Previous work suggests GSK-3\u03b2 (glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2) localizes to and regulates contractile function of the myofilament. We aimed to discover GSK-3\u03b2's in vivo role in regulating myofilament function, the mechanisms involved, and the translational relevance.\nInducible cardiomyocyte-specific GSK-3\u03b2 knockout mice and left ventricular myocardium from nonfailing and failing human hearts were studied.\nSkinned cardiomyocytes from knockout mice failed to exhibit calcium sensitization with stretch indicating a loss of length-dependent activation (LDA), the mechanism underlying the Frank-Starling Law. Titin acts as a length sensor for LDA, and knockout mice had decreased titin stiffness compared with control mice, explaining the lack of LDA. Knockout mice exhibited no changes in titin isoforms, titin phosphorylation, or other thin filament phosphorylation sites known to affect passive tension or LDA. Mass spectrometry identified several z-disc proteins as myofilament phospho-substrates of GSK-3\u03b2. Agreeing with the localization of its targets, GSK-3\u03b2 that is phosphorylated at Y216 binds to the z-disc. We showed pY216 was necessary and sufficient for z-disc binding using adenoviruses for wild-type, Y216F, and Y216E GSK-3\u03b2 in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. One of GSK-3\u03b2's z-disc targets, abLIM-1 (actin-binding LIM protein 1), binds to the z-disc domains of titin that are important for maintaining passive tension. Genetic knockdown of abLIM-1 via siRNA in human engineered heart tissues resulted in enhancement of LDA, indicating abLIM-1 may act as a negative regulator that is modulated by GSK-3\u03b2. Last, GSK-3\u03b2 myofilament localization was reduced in left ventricular myocardium from failing human hearts, which correlated with depressed LDA.\nWe identified a novel mechanism by which GSK-3\u03b2 localizes to the myofilament to modulate LDA. Importantly, z-disc GSK-3\u03b2 levels were reduced in patients with heart failure, indicating z-disc localized GSK-3\u03b2 is a possible therapeutic target to restore the Frank-Starling mechanism in patients with heart failure.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2022-02-17", "authors": ["Marisa JStachowski-Doll", "MariaPapadaki", "Thomas GMartin", "WeikangMa", "Henry MGong", "StephanieShao", "ShiShen", "Nitha AimaMuntu", "MohitKumar", "EdithPerez", "Jody LMartin", "Christine SMoravec", "SakthivelSadayappan", "Stuart GCampbell", "ThomasIrving", "Jonathan AKirk"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319491"}

We have previously fabricated a cardiac patch, EF-HAM, composed of a human amniotic membrane (HAM) coated with aligned PLGA electrospun fibers (EF). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the biocompatibility and angiogenic effects of EF-HAM scaffolds with varying fiber thicknesses on the paracrine behavior of skeletal muscle cells (SkM). Conditioned media (CM) obtained from SkM-seeded HAM and EF-HAM scaffolds were subjected to multiplex analysis of angiogenic factors and tested on HUVECs for endothelial cell viability, migration, and tube formation analyses. All three different groups of EF-HAM scaffolds demonstrated excellent biocompatibility with SkM. CM derived from SkM-seeded EF-HAM 7 min scaffolds contained significantly elevated levels of proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietin-1, IL-8, and VEGF-C compared to plain CM, which was obtained from SkM cultured on the plain surface. CM obtained from all SkM-seeded EF-HAM scaffolds significantly increased the viability of HUVECs compared to plain CM after five days of culture. However, only EF-HAM 7 min CM induced a higher migration capacity in HUVECs and formed a longer and more elaborate capillary-like network on Matrigel compared with plain CM. Surface roughness and wettability of EF-HAM 7 min scaffolds might have influenced the proportion of skeletal myoblasts and fibroblasts growing on the scaffolds and subsequently potentiated the angiogenic paracrine function of SkM.

{"title": "Silk-Based Matrices and c-Kit-Positive Cardiac Progenitor Cells for a Cellularized Silk Fibroin Scaffold: Study of an in vivo Model.", "abstract": "The production of a cellularized silk fibroin scaffold is very difficult because it is actually impossible to differentiate cells into a well-organized cardiac tissue. Without vascularization, not only do cell masses fail to grow, but they may also exhibit an area of necrosis, indicating a lack of oxygen and nutrients. In the present study, we used the so-called tyrosine protein kinase kit (c-Kit)-positive cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) to generate cardiac cellularized silk fibroin scaffolds, multipotent cells isolated from the adult heart to date that can show some degree of differentiation toward the cardiac phenotype. To test their ability to differentiate into the cardiac phenotype in vivo as well, CPC and collagen organoid-like masses were implanted into nude mice and their behavior observed. Since the 3-dimensional structure of cardiac tissue can be preserved by scaffolds, we prepared in parallel different silk fibroin scaffolds with 3 different geometries and tested their behavior in 3 different models of immunosuppressed animals. Unfortunately, CPC cellularized silk fibroin scaffolds cannot be used in vivo. CPCs implanted alone or in collagen type I gel were destroyed by CD3+ lymphocyte aggregates, whereas the porous and partially oriented scaffolds elicited a consistent foreign body response characterized by giant cells. Only the electrospun meshes were resistant to the foreign body reaction. In conclusion, c-Kit-positive CPCs, although expressing a good level of cardiac differentiation markers in vitro with or without fibroin meshes, are not suitable for an in vivo model of cardiac organoids because they are degraded by a T-cell-mediated immune response. Even scaffolds which may preserve the survival of these cells in vivo also induced a host response. However, among the tested scaffolds, the electrospun meshes (F-scaffold) induced a lower response compared to all the other tested structures.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2022-02-15", "authors": ["AntonellaMotta", "RosarioBarone", "FilippoMacaluso", "FilippoGiambalvo", "FrancescoPecoraro", "PatriziaDi Marco", "GiovanniCassata", "RobertoPuleio", "ClaudioMigliaresi", "AnnalisaGuercio", "ValentinaDi Felice"], "doi": "10.1159/000522568"}
{"title": "The effect of topographical and mechanical stimulation on the structural and functional anisotropy of cardiomyocytes grown on a circular PDMS diaphragm.", "abstract": "Due to their immature morphology and functional immaturity, cardiomyocytes have limited use as an in vitro disease model of the native heart. Mechanical stimulation induces structural growth in cardiomyocytes in vitro by addressing the electrical-mechanical interactions between the tissues. However, current in vitro models are restricted in their capacity to replicate the milieu observed in natural myocardium. Herein, we proposed a Galinstan strain sensor integrated nanogrooved circular PDMS diaphragm to mimic the native cardiac tissues. The impact of combined topographical and mechanical stimulation on cultured cardiomyocytes at various strain areas on a circular PDMS diaphragm is studied in detail. An inverted microscope is used to image live cells and video acquisition to study the contractility of cultured cardiomyocytes. The structural changes of the cultured cardiomyocytes are investigated by its sarcomere length and connexin-43 (Cx43) expression using immunocytochemistry analysis. Cyclic strain is found to promote structural development in cultured cardiomyocytes, and diaphragms with nano-groove patterns displayed increased contractile activity and gene expression (sarcomere length \u223c1.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0\u03bcm and normalized Cx43-1.57) as compared to flat diaphragms (sarcomere length \u223c1.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0\u03bcm and normalized Cx43-1.32). The nanogrooved circular diaphragm exhibited distinct stretching mechanisms at various places, with the equibi-axial stretching regions providing the optimal structural growth and formation of natural myocardium at the diaphragm's center.

{"title": "Exploring the Pattern of Metabolic Alterations Causing Energy Imbalance via PPAR\u03b1 Dysregulation in Cardiac Muscle During Doxorubicin Treatment.", "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity by anthracycline antineoplastic drug doxorubicin is one of the systemic toxicity of the cardiovascular system. The mechanism responsible for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity and lipid metabolism remains elusive. The current study tested the hypotheses that the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) in the progress of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and its mechanism behind lipid metabolism. In the present study, male rats were subjected to intraperitoneal injection (5-week period) of doxorubicin with different dosages such as low dosage (1.5\u00a0mg/kg body weight) and high dosage (15\u00a0mg/kg body weight) to induce doxorubicin cardiomyopathy. Myocardial PPAR\u03b1 was impaired in both low dosage and high dosage of doxorubicin-treated rats in a dose-dependent manner. The attenuated level of PPAR\u03b1 impairs the expression of the genes involved in mitochondrial transporter, fatty acid transportation, lipolysis, lipid metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, it disturbs the reverse triacylglycerol transporter apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB) in the myocardium. Doxorubicin elevates the circulatory lipid profile and glucose. Further aggravated lipid profile in circulation impedes the metabolism of lipid in cardiac tissue, which causes a lipotoxic condition in the heart and subsequently associated disease for the period of doxorubicin treatment. Elevated lipids in the circulation translocate into the heart dysregulates lipid metabolism in the heart, which causes augmented oxidative stress and necro-apoptosis and mediates lipotoxic conditions.

{"title": "HMGB1-Promoted Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Contribute to Cardiac Diastolic Dysfunction in Mice.", "abstract": "Background Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains an increasing public health problem with substantial morbidity and mortality but with few effective treatments. A novel inflammatory mechanism has been proposed, but the inflammatory signals promoting the development of HFpEF remain greatly unknown. Methods and Results Serum of patients with HFpEF was collected for measurement of circulating neutrophils and markers of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). To induce HFpEF phenotype, male C57BL/6 mice underwent uninephrectomy, received a continuous infusion of d-aldosterone for 4 weeks, and maintained on 1.0% sodium chloride drinking water. Heart tissues were harvested, immune cell types determined by flow cytometry, NETs formation by immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Differentiated neutrophils were cultured to investigate the effect of HMGB1 (high mobility group protein B1) and SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitor on NETs formation in vitro. Circulating neutrophils and NETs markers are elevated in patients with HFpEF, as are cardiac neutrophils and NETs formation in HFpEF mice. NETs inhibition with deoxyribonuclease 1 in experimental HFpEF mice reduces heart macrophages infiltration and inflammation and ameliorates cardiac fibrosis and diastolic function. Damage-associated molecular pattern HMGB1 expression is elevated in cardiac tissue of HFpEF mice, and HMGB1 inhibition reduces heart neutrophil infiltration and NETs formation and ameliorates diastolic function. Lastly, SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin down-regulates heart HMGB1 expression, attenuates NETs formation and cardiac fibrosis, and improves diastolic function in HFpEF mice. Conclusions NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of HFpEF, which can be ameliorated by HMGB1 inhibition and SGLT2 inhibitors.

{"title": "Sacubitril/valsartan reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress in a rat model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "The induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported as a key contributor to the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that sacubitril/valsartan, a novel angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, could be effective against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. However, the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Therefore, we investigated whether the cardioprotective effects of sacubitril/valsartan are associated with ER stress modulation in a rat model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with intraperitoneal injections of doxorubicin (15\u00a0mg/kg; cumulative) or saline for 3\u00a0weeks. From the day before the first treatment, control animals were gavaged daily with water (n\u2009=\u20098), whereas doxorubicin-treated animals were gavaged daily with water (n\u2009=\u20098) or sacubitril/valsartan (60\u00a0mg/kg/day; n\u2009=\u20098) for 6\u00a0weeks. Echocardiography was performed 6\u00a0weeks after the initiation of doxorubicin. In addition, serum troponin I and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide levels were determined, and the extent of apoptosis and protein levels related to ER stress in the cardiac tissue and doxorubicin-treated H9c2 cardiomyocytes were analyzed. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction and apoptosis in the myocardium. In addition, sacubitril/valsartan significantly downregulated the expression levels of proteins related to apoptosis and ER stress, including BAX, caspase 3, GRP78, PERK, IRE-1\u03b1, ATF-6, eIF-2\u03b1, ATF-4, and CHOP, in the myocardium of a rat model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and doxorubicin-treated H9c2 cardiomyocytes in vitro.

{"title": "PHLPP1 deficiency ameliorates cardiomyocyte death and cardiac dysfunction through inhibiting Mcl-1 degradation.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-reperfusion injury or chemotherapy can trigger excessive loss of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes, leading to the development of heart failure. Whereas apoptosis has been considered to be the major form of cell death in various myocardial damage, the means by which to reduce cardiomyocyte loss are limited, and the mechanism that underlies cardiomyocyte apoptosis need to be further investigated. PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase1 (PHLPP1) belongs to a novel family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases that functions as a tumor suppressor. Here, we identified PHLPP1 as an important pro-apoptosis factor of cardiomyocytes in response to pathogenic stresses. The conditional PHLPP1 deficiency in cardiomyocytes alleviated myocardial ischemic injury, improved cardiac function and inhibited myocardial fibrosis, in turn preventing adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure after MI. The conditional PHLPP1 deficiency in cardiomyocytes also attenuated doxorubicin (Dox)-induced myocardial injury, suppressed the inflammation and fibrosis in cardiac tissues, and protected from cardiac dysfunction. Mechanically, PHLPP1 bound the anti-apoptosis protein myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) in cardiomyocytes. Thr163 phosphorylation of Mcl-1 was reported to slow Mcl-1 protein turnover. We further found that PHLPP1 deficiency enhanced Thr163 phosphorylation of Mcl-1, inhibited Mcl-1 degradation and maintained Mcl-1 protein expression level in myocardium and cardiomyocytes upon MI or Dox treatment. PHLPP1 could directly dephosphorylate Thr163 of Mcl-1. Thus, PHLPP1 promotes cardiomyocyte death and cardiac dysfunction through binding and enhancing Mcl-1 degradation under ischemic or toxic injury conditions, which sheds new light on the development of potential therapies to control cardiomyocyte loss.", "journal": "Cellular signalling", "date": "2022-02-14", "authors": ["YongTan", "TongLi", "MeilingHu", "BoWang", "QingqingZhou", "YuyuJiang", "ShengZhang", "XuewenDuan", "JunqiYang", "XingguangLiu", "ZhenzhenZhan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2022.110281"}
{"title": "Genetic deletion of Mas receptor in FVB/N mice impairs cardiac use of glucose and lipids.", "abstract": "Angiotensin-(1-7) is a biologically active product of the renin-angiotensin system cascade and exerts inhibitory effects on inflammation, vascular and cellular growth mechanisms signaling through the G protein-coupled Mas receptor. The major purpose of the present study was to investigate the use of glucose and fatty acids by cardiac tissue in Mas knockout mice models. Serum levels of glucose, lipids, and insulin were measured in Mas-deficient and wild-type FVB/N mice. To investigate the cardiac use of lipids, the lipoprotein lipase, the gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and acyl-CoA oxidase were evaluated. To investigate the cardiac use of glucose, the insulin signaling through Akt/GLUT4 pathway, glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) glycolytic intermediates, in addition to ATP, lactate and the glycogen content were measured. Despite normal body weight, cholesterol and insulin, Mas-Knockout mice presented hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, impaired insulin signaling, through reduced phosphorylation of AKT and decreased translocation of GLUT4 in response to insulin, with subsequent decrease of the cardiac G-6-P and F-6-P. Lactate production and glycogen content were not altered in Mas-KO hearts. Mas-KO presented reduced cardiac lipoprotein lipase activity and decreased translocation of CD36 in response to insulin. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I genes were lower in Mas-KO animals compared to wild-type animals. The ATP content of Mas-KO hearts was smaller than in wild-type. The present results suggest that genetic deletion of Mas produced a devastating effect on cardiac use of glucose and lipids, leading to lower energy efficiency in the heart.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2022-02-14", "authors": ["Brenda LMonteiro", "Robson A SSantos", "Erica GMario", "Thiago SAraujo", "Silvia S QSavergnini", "Andrezza FSantiago", "Ruthnea A LMuzzi", "Isabela CCastro", "Lilian GTeixeira", "Leida MBotion", "Barbhara MMarinho", "Sergio H SSantos", "Laura C JPorto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2022.170764"}
{"title": "DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) suppresses mitophagy and aggravates heart failure via the microRNA-152-3p/ETS1/RhoH axis.", "abstract": "DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) shows close link with heart disease. This study aimed to define the role DNMT1 plays in heart failure and determine the underlying mechanism. Expression of microRNA (miR)-152-3p, DNMT1, E26 transformation specific-1 (ETS1) and ras homolog gene family member H (RhoH) was determined by RT-qPCR and/or western blot analysis. The interaction between miR-152-3p and ETS1 was predicted and verified. Methylation of the miR-152-3p promoter region was assessed using methylation-specific PCR. H9c2 cells were chosen for in vitro assays to examine the regulatory role of DNMT1 in autophagy and mitophagy with respect to miR-152-3p/ETS1/RhoH. Doxorubicin (DOX)-induced rat models of heart failure were employed for in vivo validation. DNMT1 expression was upregulated in the heart tissues of DOX-induced rats, where it showed an inverse correlation with miR-152-3p expression. Moreover, DNMT1 was shown to enhance methylation of the miR-152-3p promoter region and suppress its expression, leading to inhibition of mitophagy in H9c2 cells. In addition, DNMT1 enhanced expression of ETS1, which further elevated RhoH expression. Moreover, ETS1-elevated RhoH reduced cell viability and promoted autophagy and mitophagy in H9c2 cells upon treatment with DOX. Next, in vivo results demonstrated that depletion of DNMT1 protected rats from heart failure in a miR-152-3p/ETS1/RhoH-dependent manner. Overall, these findings indicate that DNMT1 may inhibit expression of miR-152-3p by promoting the methylation of miR-152-3p and enhancing the expression of ETS1, thereby inducing RHOH transcriptional activation and inhibiting mitochondrial autophagy, ultimately promoting the development of heart failure.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2022-02-13", "authors": ["ZhuojunDeng", "JiaqiYao", "NaXiao", "YuHan", "XuanWu", "CaizheCi", "KeChen", "XiaoyongGeng"], "doi": "10.1038/s41374-022-00740-8\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.25\n10.1016/j.hfc.2016.07.001\n10.1038/srep30922\n10.1038/s41419-018-0495-z\n10.1042/EBC20190035\n10.1152/physrev.00037.2019\n10.1038/s41374-020-0402-y\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00168.2013\n10.1186/s13148-018-0475-2\n10.2147/OTT.S154464\n10.5483/BMBRep.2019.52.10.206\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.07.002\n10.1007/s12012-019-09561-6\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.06.015\n10.1016/j.intimp.2016.08.036\n10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.033\n10.1152/ajpheart.00708.2014\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.01.043\n10.3389/fphar.2019.01135\n10.1038/ncomms3308\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01138\n10.1093/jmcb/mjs049\n10.3389/fonc.2017.00019\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31816533b7\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004873\n10.1152/ajpheart.00016.2019\n10.3390/nu9111201\n10.1016/j.biocel.2018.09.022\n10.1038/s41388-018-0369-y\n10.1016/j.jpsychires.2011.04.008\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2010.01.010\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2011-100101\n10.1002/ejhf.495\n10.1038/s41467-020-14966-x\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.04.005\n10.1007/s00705-013-1655-1\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117605\n10.1111/jphp.12900\n10.1038/s41419-017-0216-z"}

{"title": "Altered Circulating MicroRNA Profiles After Endurance Training: A Cohort Study of Ultramarathon Runners.", "abstract": "Despite the positive effects of endurance training on the cardiovascular (CV) system, excessive exercise induces not only physiological adaptations but also adverse changes in CV system, including the heart. We aimed to evaluate the selected miRNAs expression based on bioinformatic analysis and their changes before and after an ultramarathon run.\nCardiac tissue-specific targets were identified with the Tissue 2.0 database. Gene-gene interaction data were retrieved from the STRING app for Cytoscape. Twenty-three endurance athletes were recruited to the study. Athletes ran to completion (100 km) or exhaustion (52-91 km, median 74 km). All participants completed pre- and post-run testing. miRNAs expressions were measured both before and after the race.\nEnrichment analysis of the signaling pathways associated with the genes targeted by miRNAs selected for qRT-PCR validation (miR-1-3p, miR-126, miR-223, miR-125a-5p, miR-106a-5p, and miR-15a/b). All selected miRNAs showed overlap in regulation in pathways associated with cancer, IL-2 signaling, TGF-\u03b2 signaling as well as BDNF signaling pathway. Analysis of metabolites revealed significant regulation of magnesium and guanosine triphosphate across analyzed miRNA targets. MiR-1-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-126, and miR-223 expressions were measured in 23 experienced endurance athletes, before and after an ultramarathon wherein athletes ran to completion (100 km) or exhaustion (52-91 km, median 74 km).

{"title": "Cardiac electro-mechanical activity in a deforming human cardiac tissue: modeling, existence-uniqueness, finite element computation and application to multiple ischemic disease.", "abstract": "In this study, the cardiac electro-mechanical model in a deforming domain is taken with the addition of mechanical feedback and stretch-activated channel current coupled with the ten Tusscher human ventricular cell level model that results in a coupled PDE-ODE system. The existence and uniqueness of such a coupled system in a deforming domain is proved. At first, the existence of a solution is proved in the deformed domain. The local existence of the solution is proved using the regularization and the Faedo-Galerkin technique. Then, the global existence is proved using the energy estimates in appropriate Banach spaces, Gronwall lemma, and the compactness procedure. The existence of the solution in an undeformed domain is proved using the lower semi-continuity of the norms. Uniqueness is proved using Young's inequality, Gronwall lemma, and the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. For the application purpose, this model is applied to understand the electro-mechanical activity in ischemic cardiac tissue. It also takes care of the development of active tension, conductive, convective, and ionic feedback. The Second Piola-Kirchoff stress tensor arising in Lagrangian mapping between reference and moving frames is taken as a combination of active, passive, and volumetric components. We investigated the effect of varying strength of hyperkalemia and hypoxia, in the ischemic subregions of human cardiac tissue with local multiple ischemic subregions, on the electro-mechanical activity of healthy and ischemic zones. This system is solved numerically using the [Formula: see text] finite element method in space and the implicit-explicit Euler method in time. Discontinuities arising with the modeled multiple ischemic regions are treated to the desired order of accuracy by a simple regularization technique using the interpolating polynomials. We examined the cardiac electro-mechanical activity for several cases in multiple hyperkalemic and hypoxic human cardiac tissue. We concluded that local multiple ischemic subregions severely affect the cardiac electro-mechanical activity more, in terms of action potential (v) and mechanical parameters, intracellular calcium ion concentration [Formula: see text], active tension ([Formula: see text]), stretch ([Formula: see text]) and stretch rate ([Formula: see text]), of a healthy cell in its vicinity, compared to a single Hyperkalemic or Hypoxic subregion. The four moderate hypoxically generated ischemic subregions affect the waveform of the stretch along the fiber and the stretch rate more than a single severe ischemic subregion.", "journal": "Journal of mathematical biology", "date": "2022-02-11", "authors": ["MeenaPargaei", "B V RathishKumar", "Luca FPavarino", "SimoneScacchi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00285-022-01717-3\n10.1142/S0218202507002534\n10.1016/j.nonrwa.2007.11.008"}

{"title": "Experimental Combination Therapy with Amiodarone and Low-Dose Benznidazole in a Mouse Model of Trypanosoma cruzi Acute Infection.", "abstract": "Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, affects approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America, with cardiomyopathy being the clinical manifestation most commonly associated with patient death during the acute phase. The etiological treatment of CD is restricted to benznidazole (Bz) and nifurtimox (Nif), which involve long periods of administration, frequent side effects, and low efficacy in the chronic phase. Thus, combined therapies emerge as an important tool in the treatment of CD, allowing the reduction of Bz dose and treatment duration. In this sense, amiodarone (AMD), the most efficient antiarrhythmic drug currently available and prescribed to CD patients, is a potential candidate for combined treatment due to its known trypanocidal activity. However, the efficacy of AMD during the acute phase of CD and its interaction with Bz or Nif are still unknown. In the present study, using a well-established murine model of the acute phase of CD, we observed that the Bz/AMD combination was more effective in reducing the peak parasitemia than both monotherapy treatments.

But cardiac fibrosis mechanism remains unclear. Our purpose was to explore microRNA-325-3p (miR-325-3p)/human epididymis protein 4's (HE4) role in the occurrence and development of right ventricular fibrosis in PAH.\nThe right ventricular fibrosis model of rats with PAH was constructed, and miR-325-3p was overexpressed to explore miR-325-3p's effect on myocardial fibrosis in rats with PAH. Pearson correlation coefficient examined the correlation between HE4 and miR-325-3p. We separated and identified the primary rat myocardial fibroblasts from the heart tissue. Then, the Ang II-treated myocardial fibroblast fibrosis model was constructed. miR-325-3p mimics and si-HE4 and oe-HE4 cell lines were constructed to investigate miR-325-3p and HE4 effects on myocardial cell fibrosis. Then, we added PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to study the effects of HE4 in cell fibrosis by the PI3K/AKT pathway. Starbase was used to predict miR-325-3p and HE4 binding sites. Dual-luciferase reporter assay verified whether miR-325-3p and HE4 were targeted.\nOverexpression of miR-325-3p alleviated myocardial fibrosis in rats with PAH. Pearson correlation coefficient showed that HE4 was negatively correlated with miR-325-3p expression. Starbase predicted that miR-325-3p had binding sites with HE4. Dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-325-3p targeted HE4. Overexpression of miR-325-3p downregulated HE4 and inhibited myocardial fibroblast fibrosis. HE4 knockdown inhibited myocardial fibroblast fibrosis. HE4 promoted myocardial fibroblast fibrosis and activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, HE4 affected myocardial fibroblast fibrosis through the PI3K/AKT pathway.\nmiR-325-3p could target HE4 to relieve right ventricular fibrosis in rats with PAH.

{"title": "Left Ventricular Wall Reconstruction with Autologous Vascularized Tunica Muscularis of Stomach in a Porcine Pilot Model.", "abstract": "Surgical replacement of dysfunctional cardiac muscle with regenerative tissue is an important option to combat heart failure. But, current available myocardial prostheses like a Dacron or a pericardium patch neither have a regenerative capacity nor do they actively contribute to the heart's pump function. This study aimed to show the feasibility of utilizing a vascularized stomach patch for transmural left ventricular wall reconstruction.\nA left ventricular transmural myocardial defect was reconstructed by performing transdiaphragmatic autologous transplantation of a vascularized stomach segment in six Lewe minipigs. Three further animals received a conventional Dacron patch as a control treatment. The first 3 animals were followed up for 3 months until planned euthanasia, whereas the observation period for the remaining 3 animals was scheduled 6 months following surgery. Functional assessment of the grafts was carried out via cardiac magnetic resonance tomography and angiography. Physiological remodeling was evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically after heart explantation.\nFive out of six test animals and all control animals survived the complex surgery and completed the follow-up without clinical complications. One animal died intraoperatively due to excessive bleeding. No animal experienced rupture of the stomach graft. Functional integration of the heterotopically transplanted stomach into the surrounding myocardium was observed. Angiography showed development of connections between the gastric graft vasculature and the coronary system of the host cardiac tissue.\nThe clinical results and the observed physiological integration of gastric grafts into the cardiac structure demonstrate the feasibility of vascularized stomach tissue as myocardial prosthesis. The physiological remodeling indicates a regenerative potential of the graft. Above all, the connection of the gastric vessels with the coronary system constitutes a rationale for the use of vascularized and, therefore, viable stomach tissue for versatile tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "European surgical research.

The properties of the material used were tested and compared with those of the valve tissue. Then, the accuracy of the three-dimensional model was assessed from the perspectives of the pathological and morphological parameters. Thereafter, surgical simulation of MV repair, closure of the perforation and transcatheter MV replacement were simulated using our model. Two experienced surgeons were invited to perform and evaluate the fidelity and softness of the model. Morphological changes in the MV and the potential compression of the device on surrounding cardiac tissue were also measured after simulation.\nThe soft MV model was successfully constructed by the mould-modelling method. The property of the material used was closer to that of valve tissue than to that of the rigid model. In addition, the pathological details and morphological measurements of the three-dimensional model were consistent with the surgical findings. The simulated surgical procedure was successful using our model. Morphological changes, including the ratio of the leaflet/annulus area and the coaptation depth, were closely correlated with the regurgitation left after MV repair, which might be an indicator of the surgical effects. The results of this study demonstrated the great advantages of our constructed soft model in exploring the interaction of the device with the surrounding tissue. These advantages were not obtained using the rigid model in a previous study.\nThe soft MV model was successfully constructed using the mould-modelling method, and its physical properties were similar to those of heart tissue.

Herein, we demonstrate that human cardiac organoids (hCOs) are a viable platform to model the cardiac injuries caused by COVID-19 hyperinflammation.

The IL-1 \u03b2 treated hCOs recapitulated transcriptomic, structural, and functional signatures of COVID-19 hearts. The comparison of IL-1\u03b2 treated hCOs with cardiac tissue from COVID-19 autopsies illustrated the critical roles of hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 cardiac insults and indicated the cardioprotective effects of endothelium.

{"title": "The caspase-1 inhibitor VX765 upregulates connexin 43 expression and improves cell-cell communication after myocardial infarction via suppressing\u00a0the IL-1\u03b2/p38 MAPK pathway.", "abstract": "Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the most important protein in the gap junction channel between cardiomyocytes. Abnormalities of Cx43 change the conduction velocity and direction of cardiomyocytes, leading to reentry and conduction block of the myocardium, thereby causing arrhythmia. It has been shown that IL-1\u03b2 reduces the expression of Cx43 in astrocytes and cardiomyocytes in vitro. However, whether caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 affect connexin 43 after myocardial infarction (MI) is uncertain. In this study we investigated the effects of VX765, a caspase-1 inhibitor, on the expression of Cx43 and cell-to-cell communication after MI. Rats were treated with VX765 (16\u2009mg/kg, i.v.) 1\u2009h before the left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation, and then once daily for 7 days. The ischemic heart was collected for histochemical analysis and Western blot analysis. We showed that VX765 treatment significantly decreased the infarct area, and alleviated cardiac dysfunction and remodeling by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1/IL-1\u03b2 expression in the heart after MI. In addition, VX765 treatment markedly raised Cx43 levels in the heart after MI. In vitro experiments were conducted in rat cardiac myocytes (RCMs) stimulated with the supernatant from LPS/ATP-treated rat cardiac fibroblasts (RCFs). Pretreatment of the RCFs with VX765 (25\u2009\u03bcM) reversed the downregulation of Cx43 expression in RCMs and significantly improved intercellular communication detected using a scrape-loading/dye transfer assay. We revealed that VX765 suppressed the activation of p38 MAPK signaling in the heart tissue after MI as well as in RCMs stimulated with the supernatant from LPS/ATP-treated RCFs. Taken together, these data show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX765 upregulates Cx43 expression and improves cell-to-cell communication in rat heart after MI via suppressing the IL-1\u03b2/p38 MAPK pathway.", "journal": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "date": "2022-02-09", "authors": ["Xue-LingSu", "Shu-HuiWang", "SumraKomal", "Liu-GenCui", "Rui-CongNi", "Li-RongZhang", "Sheng-NaHan"], "doi": "10.1038/s41401-021-00845-8\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.1016/j.ahj.2005.05.015\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.03.057\n10.2217/fca.12.78\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.110\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.03.016\n10.1152/physrev.00007.2003\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.10.015\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000117402.70689.75\n10.1186/s12860-016-0118-4\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.05.002\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.10.030\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.916346\n10.1248/bpb.b18-00369\n10.1016/j.tcm.2018.02.003\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.161\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.02.043\n10.1189/jlb.3MR0516-224R\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000001654\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.01.027\n10.1007/s11897-014-0231-7\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.08.023\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.09.009\n10.1177/1074248417702890\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.005\n10.1002/glia.20438\n10.1038/nri.2016.58\n10.1038/s41584-020-0377-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.315937\n10.1038/nm.3806\n10.1084/jem.20171419\n10.1111/cns.13384\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.102\n10.1007/s10557-018-6781-2\n10.1152/ajpendo.00227.2019\n10.1016/j.ihj.2015.07.015\n10.3389/fnmol.2012.00080\n10.1002/clc.4960030403\n10.1093/cvr/cvn133\n10.1038/nature10759\n10.1016/j.metabol.2017.06.002\n10.1186/s12974-020-1728-5\n10.1111/aos.13427\n10.1186/s12943-018-0900-3\n10.1074/jbc.M109.082305\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.525493\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.864\n10.1152/ajpheart.00346.2004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029622\n10.1172/JCI40295\n10.1038/s41598-019-45078-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1371/journal.pone.0107639\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119418\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.190454\n10.1111/jcmm.13631\n10.2147/IJHTS.S13459"}
{"title": "Identification of vital modules and genes associated with heart failure based on weighted gene coexpression network analysis.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a chronic heart disease with a high incidence and mortality. Due to the regulatory complexity of gene coexpression networks, the underlying hub genes regulation in HF remain incompletely appreciated. We aimed to explore potential key modules and genes for HF using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA).\nThe expression profiles by high throughput sequencing of heart tissues samples from HF and non-HF samples were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HF and non-HF samples were firstly identified. Then, a coexpression network was constructed to identify key modules and potential hub genes. The biological functions of potential hub genes were analysed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING online tool. A total of 135 DEGs (133 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated DEGs) between HF and non-HF samples were identified in the GSE135055 and GSE123976 datasets. Moreover, a total of 38 modules were screened based on WGCNA in the GSE135055 dataset, and six potential hub genes (UCK2, ASB1, CCNI, CUX1, IRX6, and STX16) were screened from the key module by setting the gene significance over 0.2 and the module membership over 0.8. Furthermore, 78 potential hub genes were obtained by taking the intersection of the 135 DEGs and all genes in the key module, and enrichment analysis revealed that they were mainly involved in the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signalling pathways. Finally, in a PPI network constructed with the 78 potential hub genes, CUX1 and ASB1 were identified as hub genes in HF because they were also identified as potential hub genes in the WGCNA.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to employ WGCNA to identify the key module and hub genes for HF. Our study identified a module and two genes that might play important roles in HF, which may provide potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of HF and improve our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying HF.", "journal": "ESC heart failure", "date": "2022-02-08", "authors": ["WeikangBian", "ZhichengWang", "XiaoboLi", "Xiao-XinJiang", "HongsongZhang", "ZhizhongLiu", "Dai-MinZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/ehf2.13827"}

In the present study, we have created hiPSC-derived cardiac organoids (hiPSC-COs) comprised of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human fibroblasts. To produce a beating conduit for patients suffering from congenital heart diseases, we constructed scaffold-free tubular EHTs (T-EHTs) using hiPSC-COs and bio-3D printing with needle arrays. The bio-3D printed T-EHTs were cut open and transplanted around the abdominal aorta as well as the inferior vena cava (IVC) of NOG mice. The transplanted T-EHTs were covered with the omentum, and the abdomen was closed after completion of the procedure. Additionally, to compare the functionality of hiPSC-COs with that of T-EHTs, we transplanted the former around the aorta and IVC as well as injecting them into the subcutaneous tissue on the back of the mice. After 1 m of the transplantation procedures, we observed the beating of the T-EHTs in the mice. In histological analysis, the T-EHTs showed clear striation of the myocardium and vascularization compared to hiPSC-COs transplanted around the aorta or in subcutaneous tissue.

{"title": "miR-340-5p Mediates Cardiomyocyte Oxidative Stress in Diabetes-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction by Targeting Mcl-1.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is initially characterized by early diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis, and it is eventually characterized by clinical heart failure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small noncoding RNAs, play significant roles in diabetes mellitus (DM). However, it is still largely unknown about the mechanism that links miRNAs and the development of DCM. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the potential role of microRNA-340-5p in DCM in db/db mouse, which is a commonly used model of type 2 DM and diabetic complications that lead to heart failure. We first demonstrated that miR-340-5p expression was dramatically increased in heart tissues of mice and cardiomyocytes under diabetic conditions. Overexpression of miR-340-5p exacerbated DCM, which was reflected by extensive myocardial fibrosis and more serious dysfunction in db/db mice as represented by increased apoptotic cardiomyocytes, elevated ROS production, and impaired mitochondrial function. Inhibition of miR-340-5p by a tough decoy (TUD) vector was beneficial for preventing ROS production and apoptosis, thus rescuing diabetic cardiomyopathy. We identified myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) as a major target gene for miR-340-5p and showed that the inhibition of Mcl-1 was responsible for increased functional loss of mitochondria, oxidative stress, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, thereby caused cardiac dysfunction in diabetic mice. In conclusion, our results showed that miR-340-5p plays a crucial role in the development of DCM and can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2022-02-08", "authors": ["YinghongZhu", "XuewenYang", "JingZhou", "LongChen", "PengfeiZuo", "LinChen", "LanJiang", "TingLi", "DejiangWang", "YingyiXu", "QiushiLi", "YiYan"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/3182931\n10.1016/j.mayocp.2019.07.008\n10.2174/1573399812666150914120529\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01514\n10.1136/bmj.m2297\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00798\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv599\n10.1186/s12933-018-0767-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.314898\n10.1038/s41418-017-0047-6\n10.7150/ijbs.51123\n10.12659/MSM.898121\n10.1691/ph.2017.7501\n10.1038/s41419-019-1604-3\n10.1536/ihj.14-386\n10.1038/s41598-018-19200-9\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.690627\n10.1038/nmeth.1903\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.12.009\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.554360\n10.4048/jbc.2018.21.e60\n10.1007/s13402-020-00553-1\n10.1038/s41388-018-0432-8\n10.1186/s12943-019-1004-4\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00042\n10.3390/ijms20133299\n10.1155/2016/9340654\n10.1093/nar/gkq1056\n10.1002/jcp.26921\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.11.004\n10.1210/en.2007-0877\n10.26355/eurrev_202006_21523\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00012\n10.1155/2021/9265016\n10.3389/fcell.2021.750382\n10.1186/s12933-018-0748-2\n10.1016/j.carpath.2015.06.003\n10.1161/JAHA.116.004694\n10.1038/ncomms8619\n10.1111/bph.12475\n10.1101/gad.215871.113\n10.1101/gad.215855.113\n10.18632/oncotarget.15962\n10.1080/21655979.2021.1905259\n10.1096/fj.202000827RR"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether WG could ameliorate the cardiotoxicity of DOX. DOX and WG were used to establish a model of cardiac damage. Echocardiography, brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin T were used to detect the degree of cardiac damage.

{"title": "NDRG4 Alleviates Myocardial Infarction-Induced Apoptosis through the JAK2/STAT3 Pathway.", "abstract": "At present, studies have confirmed that NDRG4 is specifically expressed in the heart, while its effect on the heart is still unclear. This study is to explore the effect of NDRG4 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis caused by acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nTwenty SD rats were randomly divided into Sham (left anterior descent of heart without ligation) and AMI groups. In this study, coronary artery ligation was used to establish an AMI model, and the AMI model was verified by auxiliary examination and pathological examination. Besides, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB) was used to detect the expression level of Bax and Bcl-2 in heart tissues, and NDRG mRNA levels in tissues were also detected. qRT-PCR technology was used to verify the transfection efficiency of NDRG4 in H9C2 cells, and the change of apoptosis level of H9C2 cells was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and TUNEL staining; besides, the expression level of apoptosis-related factors was detected by WB and qRT-PCR technology. Simultaneously with the modeling of rats, we injected adenovirus (Ad) into the heart tissue and examined the structural and functional changes of the rat heart. Then, WB technology was used to detect the expression level of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.\nThe heart function and heart structure of rats in the MI group were dramatically worse, and the expression level of NDRG4 was also dramatically reduced. The overexpression of NDRG4 in H9C2 cells can effectively inhibit the ischemia/hypoxia- (I/H-) induced decrease in cell viability and increase in apoptosis rate and inhibit the increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Moreover, overexpression of NDRG4 in heart tissue can effectively improve the cardiac function and structural destruction caused by MI. In addition, NDRG4 can inhibit JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation.\nThe expression of NDRG4 in the MI tissue of rats was suppressed, while overexpression of NDRG4 by injection of Ad can obviously protect the rat heart. Furthermore, overexpression of NDRG4 in H9C2 cells can effectively inhibit the I/H-induced decrease in cell viability and increase in apoptosis rate, and this may be related to the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.", "journal": "Computational and mathematical methods in medicine", "date": "2022-02-08", "authors": ["ChangliangZhao", "YuanyuanRen", "YachaoZhang"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/4869470\n10.1113/jp270538\n10.7759/cureus.9349\n10.1161/cir.0000000000000950\n10.1038/s41569-020-0403-y\n10.1161/jaha.117.008024\n10.1186/s12967-017-1191-y\n10.1023/a:1017934810825\n10.1007/s11033-012-2448-4\n10.1096/fj.09-151464\n10.18632/oncotarget.4009\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.02.044\n10.1080/13880209.2020.1779318\n10.1155/2019/9846312\n10.1016/j.jep.2017.01.033\n10.1155/2019/6521218\n10.1007/s00395-020-0809-z\n10.1016/1071-9164(95)90019-5\n10.1038/s41420-021-00467-3\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110534\n10.1016/j.recesp.2011.10.031\n10.2217/fca-2020-0033\n10.34172/jcvtr.2020.18\n10.1007/s00395-016-0549-2\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010715-103335\n10.1080/07853890.2017.1417631\n10.1177/1756284819858507\n10.1006/geno.2000.6496\n10.1186/s12888-014-0349-x\n10.1007/s00204-014-1448-7\n10.1053/j.seminoncol.2003.08.015\n10.1186/s13046-019-1428-0"}
{"title": "Sex-related differential susceptibility to ponatinib cardiotoxicity and differential modulation of the Notch1 signalling pathway in a murine model.", "abstract": "Ponatinib (PON), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in chronic myeloid leukaemia, has proven cardiovascular toxicity. We assessed mechanisms of sex-related PON-induced cardiotoxicity and identified rescue strategies in a murine model. PON+scrambled siRNA-treated male mice had a higher number of TUNEL-positive cells (%TdT+6.12 \u00b1 0.17), higher percentage of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive senescent cardiac area (%SA-\u03b2-gal 1.41 \u00b1 0.59) and a lower reactivity degree (RD) for the survival marker Bmi1 [Abs (OD) 5000 \u00b1 703] compared to female (%TdT+3.75 \u00b1 0.35; %SA-\u03b2-gal 0.77 \u00b1 0.02; Bmi1 [Abs (OD) 8567 \u00b1 2173]. Proteomics analysis of cardiac tissue showed downstream activation of cell death in PON+siRNA scrambled compared to vehicle or PON+siRNA-Notch1-treated male mice. Upstream analysis showed beta-oestradiol activation, and downstream analysis showed activation of cell survival and inhibition of cell death in PON+scrambled siRNA compared to vehicle or PON+siRNA-Notch1-treated female mice. PON+scrambled siRNA-treated mice also had a downregulation of cardiac actin-more marked in males-and vessel density-more marked in females. Female hearts showed greater cardiac fibrosis than their male counterparts at baseline, with no significant change after PON treatment. PON+siRNA-scrambled mice had less fibrosis than vehicle or PON+siRNA-Notch1-treated mice. The left ventricular systolic dysfunction showed by PON+scrambled siRNA-treated mice (male %EF 28 \u00b1 9; female %EF 36 \u00b1 7) was reversed in both PON+siRNA-Notch1-treated male (%EF 53 \u00b1 9) and female mice (%EF 52 \u00b1 8).

{"title": "Emerging Trends in Mesenchymal Stem Cells Applications for Cardiac Regenerative Therapy: Current Status and Advances.", "abstract": "Irreversible myocardium infarction is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related death and its quantum is expected to grow in coming years. Pharmacological intervention has been at the forefront to ameliorate injury-related morbidity and mortality. However, its outcomes are highly skewed. As an alternative, stem cell-based tissue engineering/regenerative medicine has been explored quite extensively to regenerate the damaged myocardium. The therapeutic modality that has been most widely studied both preclinically and clinically is based on adult multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) delivered to the injured heart. However, there is debate over the mechanistic therapeutic role of MSC in generating functional beating cardiomyocytes. This review intends to emphasize the role and use of MSC in cardiac regenerative therapy (CRT). We have elucidated in detail, the various aspects related to the history and progress of MSC use in cardiac tissue engineering and its multiple strategies to drive cardiomyogenesis.

{"title": "Emerging Bioelectronic Strategies for Cardiovascular Tissue Engineering and Implantation.", "abstract": "Heart diseases are currently the leading cause of death worldwide. The ability to create cardiovascular tissue has numerous applications in understanding tissue development, disease progression, pharmacological testing, bio-actuators, and transplantation; yet current cardiovascular tissue engineering (CTE) methods are limited. However, there have been emerging developments in the bioelectronics field, with the creation of biomimetic devices that can intimately interact with cardiac cells, provide monitoring capabilities, and regulate tissue formation. Combining bioelectronics with cardiac tissue engineering can overcome current limitations and produce physiologically relevant tissue that can be used in various areas of cardiovascular research and medicine. This review highlights the recent advances in cardiovascular-based bioelectronics. First, cardiac tissue engineering and the potential of bioelectronic therapies for cardiovascular diseases are discussed. Second, advantageous bioelectronic materials for CTE and implantation and their properties are reviewed. Third, several representative cardiovascular tissue-bioelectronic interface models and the beneficial functions that bioelectronics can demonstrate in in vitro and in vivo applications are explored. Finally, the prospects and remaining challenges for clinical application are discussed.", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2022-02-05", "authors": ["Dannielle MCox-Pridmore", "Fernando ACastro", "S Ravi PSilva", "PatriziaCamelliti", "YunlongZhao"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.202105281"}

Biochanin A is a methylated isoflavone present in flowering tops of Trifolium pratense reported for anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-infective, anti-cancer and anti-diabetic activity. The study was designed to assess the efficacy of Biochanin A in type\u20052 diabetic cardiomyopathy. Type\u20052 diabetes was induced in rats feeding high fat diet for two weeks and administration of single low dose of streptozotocin. Biochanin A was administered for 16\u2005weeks orally once in a day (10, 20 and 40\u2005mg/kg of body weight). Various parameters such as blood glucose, cardiac markers, oxidative stress and hemodynamic parameters, immunohistochemical, histopathological investigation and SIRT1 expression were measured at the end of the study. Biochanin A treatment resulted into reduction in plasma concentration of cardiac markers along with reduction in hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. Biochanin A treated animals also demonstrated improvement in hemodynamic parameters. Diabetic animals treated with different doses of Biochanin A shown increased SIRT1 expression in cardiac tissue, and also confirmed reduced cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac protection in histopathological study. Outcome of the study indicates that Biochanin A is the potential candidate to control hyperglycemia, oxidative stress and improve SIRT1 expression in cardiac tissue.

Tissue derived biomaterials have shown promise as an injectable treatment for the post-ischemic heart. Specifically, decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) is a protein rich suspension that forms a therapeutic hydrogel once injected and improves the heart post-injury response in rodents and pig models. Current dECM-derived biomaterials are delivered to the heart as a liquid dECM hydrogel precursor or colloidal suspension, which gels over several minutes. To increase the functionality of the dECM therapy, an injectable solid dECM microparticle formulation derived from heart tissue to control sizing and extend stability in aqueous conditions is developed. When delivered into the infarcted mouse heart, these dECM microparticles protect cardiac function promote vessel density and reduce left ventricular remodeling by sustained delivery of biomolecules. Longer retention, higher stiffness, and slower protein release of dECM microparticles are noted compared to liquid dECM hydrogel precursor. In addition, the dECM microparticle can be developed as a platform for macromolecule delivery. Together, the results suggest that dECM microparticles can be developed as a modular therapy for heart injury.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2022-02-05", "authors": ["XinmingWang", "AliAnsari", "ValinteshleyPierre", "KathleenYoung", "Chandrasekhar RKothapalli", "Horst Avon Recum", "Samuel ESenyo"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202102265\n10.1152/ajpheart.00339.2017"}

{"title": "Serial estimation of gene expression of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and autophagy gene HMGB1 to determine postmortem interval.", "abstract": "The estimation of accurate post mortem interval (PMI) is a crucial question in forensic medicine. Several approaches have been used to determine the PMI including physical, metabolic, autolytic, entomological, physiochemical and biochemical methods over time. For estimation of PMI, RNA degradation after death is reported to be an important tool. This study aimed to analyse the pattern of gene expression by serial estimation of cardiac specific cardiac troponin I (cTnI) gene and autophagy gene HMGB1 for determining PMI at room temperature by using housekeeping gene GAPDH. Right ventricular heart tissue weighing 10\u00a0g was collected and harvested from 17 medico-legal autopsies. The tissue was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice. Further, homogenate of cardiac tissue was analysed by quantitative Real time polymerase chain reaction (qRtPCR) for gene amplification and gene expression of cTnI, HMGB1 gene and GAPDH, at different time intervals (0,6,12\u00a0h) at room temperature. The result revealed \u2206Ct value of cTnI gene of the cardiac muscle showing almost equal degradation at equal time interval correlated with PMI within 0-12\u00a0h at room temperature, and the \u2206Ct value of HMGB1 degraded to half in every subsequent 6-hour interval at room temperature. In conclusion, the estimation of PMI by analysis of serial estimation of gene expression is a decent new tool in forensic medicine. The study shows an equal degradation of cTnI gene at equal time interval and HMGB1 degrades to half at six-hour interval. Therefore, these can be useful for estimation for PMI.", "journal": "Forensic science international.

The dynamic nature of cardiac regeneration requires consideration of the inherent temporal dimension of this process. Here, we conducted a systematic review to find genes that define the regenerative cell state of the zebrafish heart. We then performed an in silico temporal gene regulatory network analysis using transcriptomic data from the zebrafish heart regenerative process obtained from databases. In this analysis, the genes found in the systematic review were used to represent the final cell state of the transition process from a non-regenerative cell state to a regenerative state. We found 135 transcription factors driving the cellular state transition process during zebrafish cardiac regeneration, including Hand2, Nkx2.5, Tbx20, Fosl1, Fosb, Junb, Vdr, Wt1, and Tcf21 previously reported for playing a key role in tissue regeneration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that most regulators are activated in the first days post-injury, indicating that the transition from a non-regenerative to a regenerative state occurs promptly.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2022-02-04", "authors": ["Leandro SilvaNunes", "William BorgesDomingues", "Frederico SchmittKremer", "DanilloPinhal", "Vinicius FariasCampos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2022.146242"}
{"title": "Sex-dependent deterioration of cardiac function and molecular alterations in age- and disease-associated RAGE overexpression.", "abstract": "Elevated expression of the receptor for advanced-glycation endproducts (RAGE) in cardiac tissue is well-known in the elderly, in diabetes mellitus, and after acute cardiac infarction or ischemia/reperfusion injuries. RAGE and its binding partners affect the clinical outcome of heart failure and may play an essential role in accelerating the functional decline in cardiovascular aging. Therefore, hearts of wild-type (WT) C57black6/N and cardiac-specific RAGE-overexpressing transgenic (TR) mice were analyzed for their function by ultrasound at young (4-5 months) and old (22-23 months) ages. Transgenic mice exhibit significantly increased systolic (LVD-sy) and diastolic (LVD-di) diameters of their left ventricles. The left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was significantly reduced in young male TR mice. Omics of the heart did not reveal direct activation of cytokine-induced inflammation. Instead, energy metabolism-associated genes were enriched in downregulated transcripts and proteins of TR animals, causing decreased ATP production. In a sex-specific manner, there was a reduced expression of the four-and-a-half LIM-domains protein 2 (FHL2). In conclusion, transgene-induced RAGE overexpression, as a model for age- and disease-associated RAGE alteration, leads to a sex-dependent EF decline, in which FHL2 and energy depletion might play crucial roles.", "journal": "Mechanisms of ageing and development", "date": "2022-02-04", "authors": ["Patrick RWinterhalter", "MandyWirkner", "BabettBartling", "KristinW\u00e4chter", "ArinaUrazova", "AnneGro\u00dfkopf", "ClaudiusDiez", "G\u00e1borSzab\u00f3", "AndreasSimm"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mad.2022.111635"}

{"title": "Optogenetic Control of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Tissue Models.", "abstract": "Background Optogenetics, using light-sensitive proteins, emerged as a unique experimental paradigm to modulate cardiac excitability. We aimed to develop high-resolution optogenetic approaches to modulate electrical activity in 2- and 3-dimensional cardiac tissue models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. Methods and Results To establish light-controllable cardiac tissue models, opsin-carrying HEK293 cells, expressing the light-sensitive cationic-channel CoChR, were mixed with hiPSC-cardiomyocytes to generate 2-dimensional hiPSC-derived cardiac cell-sheets or 3-dimensional engineered heart tissues. Complex illumination patterns were designed with a high-resolution digital micro-mirror device. Optical mapping and force measurements were used to evaluate the tissues' electromechanical properties. The ability to optogenetically pace and shape the tissue's conduction properties was demonstrated by using single or multiple illumination stimulation sites, complex illumination patterns, or diffuse illumination. This allowed to establish in vitro models for optogenetic-based cardiac resynchronization therapy, where the electrical activation could be synchronized (hiPSC-derived cardiac cell-sheets and engineered heart tissue models) and contractile properties improved (engineered heart tissues). Next, reentrant activity (rotors) was induced in the hiPSC-derived cardiac cell-sheets and engineered heart tissue models through optogenetics programmed- or cross-field stimulations. Diffuse illumination protocols were then used to terminate arrhythmias, demonstrating the potential to study optogenetics cardioversion mechanisms and to identify optimal illumination parameters for arrhythmia termination. Conclusions By combining optogenetics and hiPSC technologies, light-controllable human cardiac tissue models could be established, in which tissue excitability can be modulated in a functional, reversible, and localized manner.

Limited to the lack of diagnostic markers and effective drug targets, cardiac apoptosis is still a major clinical challenge. Here, we reveal a potential novel therapeutic target for cardiac apoptosis. In the cause of the study, we found that KLHL38 was highly expressed in cardiac tissue of HF patients via GEO data-mining, which was further verified in the heart tissue of transverse aortic constriction mice. Meanwhile, the expression of KLHL38 is negatively correlated with myocardin protein level, which is a key cardiac apoptosis regulator. The KLHL38 overexpression obviously promoted cardiomyocyte apoptosis treated with staurosporine by facilitation of myocardin's ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. These findings reveal a new therapeutic target, which may provide a new theoretical foundation for the treatment of myocardial apoptosis in clinical practice.", "journal": "IUBMB life", "date": "2022-02-04", "authors": ["YingLuo", "LeiTian", "ChenLiang", "YaoXu"], "doi": "10.1002/iub.2602"}

Due to the particularity of the heart tissue, patients who experience ischemic infarction of the heart, still suffered irreversible damage to the heart even if the vascular reflow by treatment, and severe ones can lead to heart failure or even death. In recent years, several studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs), playing a regulatory role in damaged hearts, bring light for patients to alleviate MI. In this review, we summarized the effect of miRNAs on MI with some mechanisms, such as apoptosis, autophagy, proliferation, inflammatory; the regulation of miRNAs on cardiac structural changes after MI, including angiogenesis, myocardial remodeling, fibrosis; the application of miRNAs in stem cell therapy and clinical diagnosis; other non-coding RNAs related to miRNAs in MI during the past 5 years.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-02-04", "authors": ["ChanWu", "BinghongLiu", "RuiyingWang", "GangLi"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2021.809580\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000746\n10.1172/JCI70577\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303549\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00130.2010\n10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00045-5\n10.3389/fgene.2012.00186\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.01.050\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.010908.163111\n10.1038/35002607\n10.1038/s41598-017-07578-x\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.08.001\n10.1155/2020/4525410\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.01.008\n10.1038/s41419-018-0805-5\n10.3390/diagnostics11091675\n10.1002/jcp.29537\n10.1159/000495173\n10.3892/etm.2020.8644\n10.1042/CS20191077\n10.23736/S0026-4806.19.06226-8\n10.1007/s12192-020-01157-2\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.111208\n10.26355/eurrev_202101_24398\n10.1532/hsf.3449\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.101910\n10.18632/aging.203089\n10.1161/01.RES.0000261924.76669.36\n10.4161/auto.4281\n10.4161/auto.25969\n10.1172/JCI27523\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.018\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.06.023\n10.1074/jbc.273.51.33889\n10.1038/ncomms7779\n10.1038/s41419-018-0723-6\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034598\n10.1159/000487732\n10.1002/ejhf.1813\n10.1002/jcp.29175\n10.1007/s10753-021-01443-w\n10.1007/s00395-018-0694-x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.10.011\n10.1016/j.cjca.2014.12.026\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.04.052\n10.1038/s41586-019-1191-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300658\n10.1038/s41467-019-09530-1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305962\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3010841\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314223\n10.1038/s41467-018-03019-z\n10.1042/CS20181002\n10.1007/s00109-017-1591-8\n10.7150/thno.47021\n10.1126/scitranslmed.abb0202\n10.1007/s00395-021-00858-8\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.12.077\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.03.016\n10.1155/2021/4572282\n10.26355/eurrev_202101_24401\n10.1093/cvr/cvx052\n10.21037/atm-21-3557\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118817\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107326\n10.1038/s41434-020-0122-3\n10.1016/j.tcm.2014.06.003\n10.1517/14728222.2013.819852\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.02.023\n10.1172/JCI123135\n10.2147/IJN.S242908\n10.1111/jcmm.14016\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.08.007\n10.1159/000489185\n10.7150/thno.52843\n10.1007/s00335-021-09895-z\n10.7150/thno.52677\n10.1536/ihj.20-298\n10.1159/000479995\n10.7150/thno.15007\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.08.013\n10.1620/tjem.254.221\n10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.059\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300639\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307654\n10.1038/nrm809\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.199\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.07.739\n10.1111/jcmm.14463\n10.3892/ijmm.2014.1766\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1093/ajh/hpy120\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05431\n10.1002/jcb.29271\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.094524\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1038/nature20173\n10.1038/nm1269\n10.1038/s41419-020-2508-y\n10.1016/j.intimp.2019.106156\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312758\n10.1002/stem.2477\n10.3390/jcm9041051\n10.1038/s41598-020-62835-w\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw563\n10.3390/genes11020164\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr166\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.009\n10.1002/jgm.2995\n10.1186/s13287-017-0697-9\n10.1038/s41598-018-19581-x\n10.1038/nature04431\n10.1038/s41419-020-2545-6\n10.1002/sctm.16-0428\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227512\n10.1373/clinchem.2010.144121\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw334\n10.1161/01.CIR.79.4.733\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.09.050\n10.1136/heartjnl-2011-300299\n10.1373/clinchem.2019.308353\n10.3390/jcdd6020015\n10.2217/epi-2019-0119\n10.3389/fcell.2021.680713\n10.1080/15548627.2019.1659610\n10.1002/jcp.29031\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.04.009\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.06.122\n10.1080/15384101.2020.1750257\n10.1002/jcb.29156\n10.14348/molcells.2018.0180\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.06.011\n10.18632/aging.103072\n10.18632/aging.103269\n10.1007/s12265-018-9839-4\n10.1152/ajpheart.00444.2019\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.05.002\n10.1038/cdd.2017.61\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000001123\n10.3389/fcell.2020.618574\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000001065\n10.1080/15384101.2020.1814025\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151753\n10.1038/s41420-021-00467-3\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.06.024\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306300\n10.1016/j.metabol.2012.04.009\n10.1038/s41580-021-00354-w\n10.3892/ijmm.2019.4441\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.03.007"}

We assessed the hypothesis that senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) are main mechanisms of cardiac degenerative defect in DM. Accordingly, we tested whether ablation of senescent CSCs would rescue the cardiac regenerative/reparative defect imposed by DM. We obtained cardiac tissue from nonaged (50- to 64-year-old) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and without DM (NDM) and postinfarct cardiomyopathy undergoing cardiac surgery. A higher reactive oxygen species production in T2DM was associated with an increased number of senescent/dysfunctional T2DM-human CSCs (hCSCs) with reduced proliferation, clonogenesis/spherogenesis, and myogenic differentiation versus NDM-hCSCs in vitro. T2DM-hCSCs showed a defined pathologic SASP. A combination of two senolytics, dasatinib (D) and quercetin (Q), cleared senescent T2DM-hCSCs in vitro, restoring their expansion and myogenic differentiation capacities. In a T2DM model in young mice, diabetic status per se (independently of ischemia and age) caused CSC senescence coupled with myocardial pathologic remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. D + Q treatment efficiently eliminated senescent cells, rescuing CSC function, which resulted in functional myocardial repair/regeneration, improving cardiac function in murine DM. In conclusion, DM hampers CSC biology, inhibiting CSCs' regenerative potential through the induction of cellular senescence and SASP independently from aging. Senolytics clear senescence, abrogating the SASP and restoring a fully proliferative/differentiation-competent hCSC pool in T2DM with normalization of cardiac function.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2022-02-03", "authors": ["FabiolaMarino", "MariangelaScalise", "NadiaSalerno", "LucaSalerno", "ClaudiaMolinaro", "DonatoCappetta", "MicheleTorella", "MartaGreco", "DanielaFoti", "Ferdinando CSasso", "PasqualeMastroroberto", "AntonellaDe Angelis", "Georgina MEllison-Hughes", "MaurilioSampaolesi", "MarcelloRota", "FrancescoRossi", "KonradUrbanek", "BernardoNadal-Ginard", "DanieleTorella", "EleonoraCianflone"], "doi": "10.2337/db21-0536"}

However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of DY on cardiovascular disease still need largely to be clarified.\nTherefore, this study was designed to explore potential mechanisms of DY in myocardial infarction (MI) by integrated strategy of metabolomics and network pharmacology.\nCardiomyocytes were subjected to H\nWe found that DY exerted significant cardioprotective effects in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorated inflammatory cell infiltration and cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by ISO. The metabolomics data suggested that DY mainly affected the amino acid metabolism (i.e., valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, glycine, serine, as well as the alanine metabolism, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, etc.). Simultaneously, DY participated in the regulation of the biosynthesis of bile acids and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Notably, DY significantly reduced the biosynthesis of valine, leucine and isoleucine to regulating the metabolism of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in infarcted myocardium, thus blocking the inflammation via inhibiting the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in ISO-induced rats. The anti-inflammatory system of DY was further validated with the results of network pharmacology.\nOur study, for the first time, confirmed that DY inhibited inflammation and further exerted significant anti-myocardial infarction effect. Additionally, our work further demonstrated that the myocardial protective effect of DY was contributed to the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating BCAAs in infarcted myocardium using the comprehensive metabolomics, molecular biology and network analysis.

{"title": "The cardiac-enriched microprotein mitolamban regulates mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly and function in mice.", "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that a subset of RNA molecules annotated as noncoding contain short open reading frames that code for small functional proteins called microproteins, which have largely been overlooked due to their small size. To search for cardiac-expressed microproteins, we used a comparative genomics approach and identified mitolamban (Mtlbn) as a highly conserved 47-amino acid transmembrane protein that is abundantly expressed in the heart. Mtlbn localizes specifically to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it interacts with subunits of complex III of the electron transport chain and with mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes. Genetic deletion of Mtlbn in mice altered complex III assembly dynamics and reduced complex III activity. Unbiased metabolomic analysis of heart tissue from Mtlbn knockout mice further revealed an altered metabolite profile consistent with deficiencies in complex III activity. Cardiac-specific Mtlbn overexpression in transgenic (TG) mice induced cardiomyopathy with histological, biochemical, and ultrastructural pathologic features that contributed to premature death. Metabolomic analysis and biochemical studies indicated that hearts from Mtlbn TG mice exhibited increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings reveal Mtlbn as a cardiac-expressed inner mitochondrial membrane microprotein that contributes to mitochondrial electron transport chain activity through direct association with complex III and the regulation of its assembly and function.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2022-02-02", "authors": ["Catherine AMakarewich", "Amir ZMunir", "SvetlanaBezprozvannaya", "Aaron MGibson", "SooYoung Kim", "Misty SMartin-Sandoval", "Thomas PMathews", "Luke ISzweda", "RhondaBassel-Duby", "Eric NOlson"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2120476119"}

In this study, we used two murine models of Trypanosoma cruzi chronic infection to determine the usefulness of applying a therapeutic vaccine alone or followed by benznidazole (Bz) chemotherapy. A vaccine formulation based on an N-terminal fragment of Trans-sialidase (TS) and Immunostimulant Particle Adjuvant (ISPA) - TSNt-ISPA was obtained. Firstly, the immunogenicity and protective capacity of TSNt-ISPA was demonstrated as a prophylactic formulation in an acute model of infection. Later, the formulation was assessed as a therapeutic vaccine alone or combined with (Bz) using two models of chronic infection. BALB/c mice chronically infected with Sylvio X10/4 or Tulahuen cl2 T. cruzi strains were not treated as control or treated only with the therapeutic vaccine TSNt-ISPA, with a combined treatment TSNt-ISPA+Bz (Bz applied after the vaccine), or only with Bz. The vaccination schedule consisted of TSNt-ISPA administration at days110, 120, and 130 post-infection (pi) and Bz administration was performed daily from day 140 to 170 pi. At day 273 pi, electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters, heart parasite load, myocarditis, and heart fibrosis were assessed. In both models, therapeutic administration of TSNt-ISPA reduced ECG alterations and the cardiac tissue damage observed in the chronic phase. Moreover, vaccine treatment significantly decreased heart parasite load in both Sylvio X10/4 and Tulahuen cl2 infected mice. The combined treatment, but not Bz or vaccine administration alone, allowed to restore ECG parameters in Tulahuen cl2 infected mice. The results indicate the usefulness of the therapeutic TSNt-ISPA formulation in BALB/c mice chronically infected with Sylvio X10/4 or Tulahuen cl2 strain.

{"title": "The Role of CD147 in Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy Is Regulated by Glycosylation.", "abstract": "CD147, also known as EMMPRIN or basigin, is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that activates matrix metalloproteinases and promotes inflammation. CD147 function is regulated by posttranslational modifications of which glycosylation has attracted the most attention. In this study, we demonstrated that glycosylated CD147 was the dominant form in heart tissue, and its levels were markedly elevated in response to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Adeno-associated virus 9-mediated, cardiac-specific overexpression of wild-type CD147 in mice significantly promoted pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac remodeling accompanied by augmented oxidative stress and ferroptosis. By contrast, mutations of CD147 glycosylation sites notably weakened these detrimental effects of CD147. Mechanistically, CD147 exacerbated TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling via direct binding with the adaptor molecule TRAF2 and subsequent activation of TAK1 signalling, which was dependent on glycosylation of CD147. Collectively, our findings provide the first evidence that CD147 promoted pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in a glycosylation-dependent manner through binding the adaptor protein TRAF2 and activating the downstream TRAF2-TAK1 signalling pathway.

After 48 and 144\u00a0h of infection, upregulation of miR-145-5p (24\u00a0h: 2.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26; 48\u00a0h: 3.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9-fold change) and miR-146b-5b (24\u00a0h: 2.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.46; 48\u00a0h: 2.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23-fold change) was detected. The peak of both miRNA levels paralleled with release of trypomastigote forms. Addition of 3\u00a0\u00b5M and 10\u00a0\u00b5M of Bz 48\u00a0h after infection reduced parasite load but did not interfere with miR-145-5p and miR-146b-5p levels. Addition of PTX did not interfere with Bz-induced parasite control efficacy. Conversely, combined Bz\u2009+\u2009PTX treatment decreased the levels of both microRNAs, resembling the expression levels detected in non-infected H9C2 cells. Moreover, the use of miR-145-5p and miR-146b-5p mimic/inhibitor systems before infection of H9C2 cells decreased parasite load, 72\u00a0h postinfection. When H9C2 cells were treated with miR-145-5p and miR-146b-5p mimic/inhibitor 48\u00a0h after infection, all the used systems, except the miR-146b-5p inhibitor, reduced parasite load. Altogether, our data indicate that these microRNAs putatively control signaling pathways crucial for parasite-host cell interaction. Thus, miR-145-5p and miR-146b-5p deserve to be further investigated as biomarkers of parasite control and tools to identify therapeutic adjuvants to etiological treatment in Chagas disease.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-01-28", "authors": ["Priscila Silva Grij\u00f3Farani", "Beatriz Iandra SilvaFerreira", "DanielGibaldi", "JoseliLannes-Vieira", "Otacilio CruzMoreira"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-05493-4\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.10.002\n10.1016/j.idc.2012.03.002\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599\n10.1155/2014/683230\n10.1056/NEJMct1014204\n10.1080/17512433.2018.1509704\n10.1002/em.21839\n10.1128/AAC.05018-14\n10.1016/j.ijpddr.2015.12.001\n10.1016/j.exppara.2020.108061\n10.1186/s40409-017-0137-4\n10.1016/j.molimm.2010.12.021\n10.1128/AAC.02123-15\n10.1136/openhrt-2015-000365\n10.1016/s0140-6736(97)09338-0\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000112568.48837.60\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0003659\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.002\n10.1038/nbt0607-631\n10.1590/1414-431x20142937\n10.1093/cvr/cvs013\n10.4161/rna.20018\n10.1186/1742-4690-3-68\n10.1146/annurev.micro.112408.134243\n10.1016/j.pt.2011.07.001\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002478\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008742\n10.3389/fmicb.2016.00367\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0008889\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.05.019\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0003828\n10.1038/s41598-017-18080-9\n10.3389/fimmu.2015.00428\n10.3389/fmicb.2018.00269\n10.3390/ijms20164064\n10.1111/jcmm.12358\n10.1530/VB-20-0012\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.08.007\n10.3109/00365513.2014.981855\n10.1073/pnas.0605298103\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00133.2016\n10.1155/2014/798078\n10.1016/s0002-9440(10)62976-8\n10.1590/s0074-02762009000900032\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.01.026\n10.1186/1755-1536-5-15\n10.1042/CS20100003\n10.1007/s13238-020-00750-6\n10.1128/aem.60.1.149-152.1994\n10.1128/AEM.58.8.2606-2615.1992\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.09.017\n10.1016/0022-1759(83)90303-4\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002000\n10.1016/j.jmoldx.2015.04.010\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1038/nprot.2008.73\n10.2174/1381612023396276\n10.1007/s11596-016-1594-7\n10.1016/j.burns.2005.08.004\n10.1016/s0140-6736(17)31612-4\n10.1590/0074-02760150184\n10.4269/ajtmh.1993.48.637\n10.1371/journal.pone.0118600\n10.1186/s12974-017-0952-0\n10.1007/s11626-010-9368-1\n10.3389/fimmu.2012.00327\n10.1016/j.pt.2015.06.006\n10.1128/AAC.49.4.1521-1528.2005\n10.7326/0003-4819-144-10-200605160-00006\n10.3389/fcimb.2021.692655\n10.4269/ajtmh.16-0435\n10.1111/j.1365-4632.2006.02867.x\n10.1086/511643\n10.4269/ajtmh.2001.65.87\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn040\n10.1097/00042560-199512000-00004\n10.1016/s0162-3109(99)00186-1\n10.5603/CJ.a2017.0105\n10.1159/000484121\n10.1152/ajpheart.00709.2014\n10.4172/2155-9880.1000e106\n10.1538/expanim.20-0160\n10.26355/eurrev_202012_24194\n10.1007/s11010-017-2982-4\n10.3389/fmicb.2018.01341\n10.1073/pnas.161298398\n10.1016/j.micinf.2019.06.003\n10.1242/jcs.255687\n10.1111/pim.12769\n10.1007/978-1-4939-9148-8_15\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044907\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.03.173\n10.1016/j.vph.2018.11.006\n10.18632/aging.100042\n10.1590/s0074-02762008005000006\n10.1590/s0036-46652008000200001\n10.1590/0074-02760140435\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.601364\n10.1073/pnas.0509535102\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.09.108\n10.1038/ncb0309-228"}

{"title": "The cardioprotective effects of nano-curcumin against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity: A systematic review.", "abstract": "Although the chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin, is commonly used to treat various malignant tumors, its clinical use is restricted because of its toxicity especially cardiotoxicity. The use of curcumin may alleviate some of the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxic effects. Especially, using the nano-formulation of curcumin can overcome the poor bioavailability of curcumin and enhance its physicochemical properties regarding its efficacy. In this study, we systematically reviewed the potential cardioprotective effects of nano-curcumin against the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. A systematic search was accomplished based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for the identification of all relevant articles on \"the role of nano-curcumin on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity\" in the electronic databases of Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science up to July 2021. One hundred and sixty-nine articles were screened following a predefined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ten eligible scientific papers were finally included in the present systematic review. The administration of doxorubicin reduced the body and heart weights of mice/rats compared to the control groups. In contrast, the combined treatment of doxorubicin and nano-curcumin increased the body and heart weights of animals compared with the doxorubicin-treated groups alone. Furthermore, doxorubicin could significantly induce the biochemical and histological changes in the cardiac tissue; however, coadministration of nano-curcumin formulation demonstrated a pattern opposite to the doxorubicin-induced changes. The coadministration of nano-curcumin alleviates the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity through various mechanisms including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. Also, the cardioprotective effect of nano-curcumin formulation against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was higher than free curcumin.", "journal": "BioFactors (Oxford, England)", "date": "2022-01-27", "authors": ["HosseinMoutabian", "RuhollahGhahramani-Asl", "TohidMortezazadeh", "RezaLaripour", "AsgharNarmani", "HamedZamani", "GholamrezaAtaei", "HamedBagheri", "BagherFarhood", "ThozhukatSathyapalan", "AmirhosseinSahebkar"], "doi": "10.1002/biof.1823"}

Methods utilizing multiplex data beyond co-registration are lacking. This study developed and applied an innovative spatial analysis workflow for multiplex imaging data to IMC data determined from cardiac tissues and revealed the mechanism(s) of neutrophil-mediated post-myocardial-infarction damage.\nIMC produced multiplex images with various redox/inflammatory markers. The cardiac peri-infarct zone (PIZ) was determined to be up to 240\u00a0\u00b5m from the infarct border based on the presence of neutrophils. The tissue region beyond the infarct was defined as the remote area (RA). ImageJ was used to quantify the immunoreactivity. Functional assessments included infarct size, cell necro/apoptosis, total thiol assay and echocardiogram.\nExpression of damage markers decreased in order from the infarct area to PIZ and then RA, reflecting the neutrophil density in the regions. Concentrically spaced \"shoreline contour analysis\" around the cardiac infarct extending into the PIZ showed that immunoreactivity for damage markers decreased linearly with increasing distance from the infarct, concomitant with a decreasing neutrophil-myeloperoxidase (MPO) gradient from the infarct to the PIZ.

Elastomer cardiac patches have shown great potential in preventing left ventricle (LV) remodeling post-MI by providing mechanical support to the infarcted myocardium. Improved therapeutic outcomes are expected by mediating pathological processes in the necrosis phase, inflammation phase, and fibrosis phase, through orchestrated biological and mechanical treatments. In this study, a mechanically robust multifunctional cardiac patch integrating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic capabilities was developed to realize the integrative strategy. An elastomeric polyurethane (PFTU) containing ROS-sensitive poly (thioketal) (PTK) and unsaturated poly (propylene fumarate) (PPF) segments was synthesized, which was further clicked with pro-angiogenic Arg-Glu-Asp-Val (REDV) peptides to obtain PFTU-g-REDV (PR), and was formulated into a macroporous patch containing rosuvastatin (PRR). The mechanical support and multifunctional effects of the patch were confirmed in a rat MI model in vivo compared to the patches with only mechanical support, leading to reduced cell apoptosis, suppressed local inflammatory response, alleviated fibrosis, and induced angiogenesis.

The more accurate model considered here is referred to as the EMI model since both the extracellular space (E), the cell membrane (M) and the intracellular space (I) are explicitly represented in the model. Here, we show that the bidomain model can be derived from the cell-based EMI model and we thus reveal the close relation between the two models, and obtain an indication of the error introduced in the approximation. Also, we present numerical simulations comparing the results of the two models and thereby highlight both similarities and differences between the models. We observe that the deviations between the solutions of the models become larger for larger cell sizes. Furthermore, we observe that the bidomain model provides solutions that are very similar to the EMI model when conductive properties of the tissue are in the normal range, but large deviations are present when the resistance between cardiomyocytes is increased.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2022-01-25", "authors": ["Karoline HorgmoJ\u00e6ger", "AslakTveito"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.811029\n10.1016/j.mbs.2021.108567\n10.1016/j.camwa.2020.06.009\n10.1007/s11538-013-9927-1\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.07.004\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2310515\n10.1152/ajpheart.00385.2013\n10.3389/fphys.2021.763584\n10.1101/2021.09.24.461636\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007042\n10.3389/fphy.2020.579461\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.026\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.11.1117\n10.1098/rsta.2008.0306\n10.3389/fphys.2011.00014\n10.1098/rsta.2011.0139\n10.1016/j.physrep.2014.05.002\n10.1017/S0962492917000046\n10.1529/biophysj.108.137349\n10.1007/BF02368018\n10.1016/B978-0-12-374920-8.00924-3\n10.1017/S0033583506004227\n10.1016/j.jmgm.2017.06.012\n10.1161/01.RES.81.5.727\n10.1016/S0025-5564(00)00019-5\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.10.023\n10.1007/s10439-009-9883-y\n10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1403999\n10.1007/BF02430957\n10.1007/s10439-006-9082-z\n10.1109/RBME.2011.2173761\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.04.015\n10.3389/fphy.2017.00048\n10.3389/fncom.2017.00027\n10.1152/ajpheart.00760.2013\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.07.012\n10.1063/1.4999602\n10.1172/JCI17341\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02200.x"}

However, the function of RvD1 in doxorubicin- (Dox-) induced cardiotoxicity remains to be clarified. This study aimed to investigate whether RvD1 could attenuate Dox-induced cardiac injury. The mice were divided into three groups: control, Dox (20\u00a0mg/kg, once, intraperitoneally), and Dox + RvD1. RvD1 (2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, intraperitoneally) was injected daily for 5\u00a0days. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate the cardiac function, and the heart tissue and serum samples were collected for further analyses. The results showed that RvD1 attenuated the decreased ratio of heart weight/body weight and heart weight/tibia length, the increased level of creatine kinase and activity of lactate dehydrogenase after Dox treatment. RvD1 improved the ejection fraction and fractional shortening of left ventricular and attenuated the severity of apoptosis induced by Dox. As for the underlying pathways, the results showed that RvD1 reduced the expression of IL-1 and IL-6, and attenuated the phosphorylation of P65 in cardiac tissue. RvD1 attenuated the oxidative stress induced by Dox, as demonstrated by the attenuated levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and malondialdehyde, decreased expression of Nox-2 and Nox-4 and increased expression of Nrf-2 and HO-1. In addition, RvD1 also inhibited the endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by Dox.

As continued adoption of SBRT accelerates, it is important to delineate unforeseen cardiovascular risks associated with treatment.\nDoes the long-term risk of cardiovascular outcomes for patients with early stage NSCLC treated with either SBRT or 3DCRT plus IMRT differ by tumor laterality?\nData from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry linked to Medicare was analyzed to identify a sample of 3,256 patients (1,506 treated with SBRT and 1,750 treated with 3DCRT plus IMRT) with node-negative stage I or IIA NSCLC. Cardiovascular events were identified using diagnosis codes, and outcomes were compared between left- and right-sided tumors. We assumed that tumor laterality was random and that the radiation field for left-sided tumors likely would result in greater dose to cardiac tissues. Cox regression models were fit to quantify the association of laterality on outcomes.\nPatients were followed up for a median of 2 years. Those treated with SBRT showed no difference in hazard of any cardiovascular outcomes by tumor laterality, including the cardiovascular composite (hazard ratio [HR] comparing left- vs\u00a0right-sided tumors, 0.98; 95%\u00a0CI, 0.84-1.15).

{"title": "Longitudinal Impact of WTC Dust Inhalation on Rat Cardiac Tissue Transcriptomic Profiles.", "abstract": "First responders (FR) exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) Ground Zero air over the first week after the 9/11 disaster have an increased heart disease incidence compared to unexposed FR and the general population. To test if WTC dusts were causative agents, rats were exposed to WTC dusts (under isoflurane [ISO] anesthesia) 2 h/day on 2 consecutive days; controls received air/ISO or air only. Hearts were collected 1, 30, 240, and 360 d post-exposure, left ventricle total RNA was extracted, and transcription profiles were obtained. The data showed that differentially expressed genes (DEG) for WTC vs. ISO rats did not reach any significance with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 at days 1, 30, and 240, indicating that the dusts did not impart effects beyond any from ISO. However, at day 360, 14 DEG with a low FDR were identified, reflecting potential long-term effects from WTC dust alone, and the majority of these DEG have been implicated as having an impact on heart functions. Furthermore, the functional gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) data at day 360 showed that WTC dust could potentially impact the myocardial energy metabolism via PPAR signaling and heart valve development. This is the first study showing that WTC dust could significantly affect some genes that are associated with the heart/CV system, in the long term.

{"title": "Consecutive-Day Ventricular and Atrial Cardiomyocyte Isolations from the Same Heart: Shifting the Cost-Benefit Balance of Cardiac Primary Cell Research.", "abstract": "Freshly isolated primary cardiomyocytes (CM) are indispensable for cardiac research. Experimental CM research is generally incompatible with life of the donor animal, while human heart samples are usually small and scarce. CM isolation from animal hearts, traditionally performed by coronary artery perfusion of enzymes, liberates millions of cells from the heart. However, due to progressive cell remodeling following isolation, freshly isolated primary CM need to be used within 4-8 h post-isolation for most functional assays, meaning that the majority of cells is essentially wasted. In addition, coronary perfusion-based isolation cannot easily be applied to human tissue biopsies, and it does not straightforwardly allow for assessment of regional differences in CM function within the same heart. Here, we provide a method of multi-day CM isolation from one animal heart, yielding calcium-tolerant ventricular and atrial CM. This is based on cell isolation from cardiac tissue slices following repeated (usually overnight) storage of the tissue under conditions that prolong CM viability beyond the day of organ excision by two additional days. The maintenance of cells in their near-native microenvironment slows the otherwise rapid structural and functional decline seen in isolated CM during attempts for prolonged storage or culture. Multi-day slice-based CM isolation increases the amount of useful information gained per animal heart, improving reproducibility and reducing the number of experimental animals required in basic cardiac research. It also opens the doors to novel experimental designs, including exploring same-heart regional differences.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2022-01-22", "authors": ["JoachimGreiner", "TeresaSchiatti", "WenzelKaltenbacher", "MaricaDente", "AlinaSemenjakin", "ThomasKok", "Dominik JFiegle", "ThomasSeidel", "UrsulaRavens", "PeterKohl", "R\u00e9miPeyronnet", "Eva ARog-Zielinska"], "doi": "10.3390/cells11020233\n10.1016/S0022-2828(86)80939-7\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00128-X\n10.1016/0022-2828(91)90103-S\n10.1016/j.bpj.2017.07.026\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.05.010\n10.1007/s004240050073\n10.1007/s00395-002-0375-6\n10.1152/ajpheart.1993.265.2.H747\n10.1042/bj2730067\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.012\n10.1038/s41467-018-08003-1\n10.3791/61167\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.09.013\n10.1038/s41467-018-07038-8\n10.1091/mbc.E21-03-0130\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.06.002\n10.1007/BF00788875\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.11.010\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01028-0\n10.14814/phy2.12445\n10.1038/nprot.2017.139\n10.2170/jjphysiol.45.203\n10.1161/01.RES.65.5.1441\n10.14814/phy2.12606\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.09.004\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.025\n10.1186/s12967-018-1649-6\n10.1016/0003-4975(94)91062-6\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1997.tb00626.x\n10.3389/fphar.2021.617922\n10.1152/ajpheart.1994.266.1.H341"}
{"title": "Human iPSC-Cardiomyocytes as an Experimental Model to Study Epigenetic Modifiers of Electrophysiology.", "abstract": "The epigenetic landscape and the responses to pharmacological epigenetic regulators in each human are unique. Classes of epigenetic writers and erasers, such as histone acetyltransferases, HATs, and histone deacetylases, HDACs, control DNA acetylation/deacetylation and chromatin accessibility, thus exerting transcriptional control in a tissue- and person-specific manner. Rapid development of novel pharmacological agents in clinical testing-HDAC inhibitors (HDACi)-targets these master regulators as common means of therapeutic intervention in cancer and immune diseases. The action of these epigenetic modulators is much less explored for cardiac tissue, yet all new drugs need to be tested for cardiotoxicity. To advance our understanding of chromatin regulation in the heart, and specifically how modulation of DNA acetylation state may affect functional electrophysiological responses, human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) technology can be leveraged as a scalable, high-throughput platform with ability to provide patient-specific insights. This review covers relevant background on the known roles of HATs and HDACs in the heart, the current state of HDACi development, applications, and any adverse cardiac events; it also summarizes relevant differential gene expression data for the adult human heart vs. hiPSC-CMs along with initial transcriptional and functional results from using this new experimental platform to yield insights on epigenetic control of the heart.

{"title": "Potential ameliorative effect of dietary quercetin against lead-induced oxidative stress, biochemical changes, and apoptosis in laying Japanese quails.", "abstract": "Lead (Pb) is a widespread environmental pollutant which is a toxic threat to human and animal health. The present study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative role of quercetin in laying quails exposed to Pb. A total of 112 birds were randomly divided into four groups. The control group was fed with basal diet, the Pb group was fed with ration supplemented with Pb at the dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg (as Pb (II) acetate trihydrate), the Quercetin group was fed with ration supplemented with quercetin at the dose of 400\u00a0mg/kg, and the Pb+\u00a0Quercetin group was fed with ration supplemented with Pb at the dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg and quercetin at dose of 400\u00a0mg/kg. Results showed that serum total protein, glucose, albumin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values of the Pb +\u00a0Quercetin group partially improved with quercetin supplementation. Meanwhile, serum creatinine values of the Pb +\u00a0Quercetin group was found to be significantly lower than that of the Pb group. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) enzyme activities in the Quercetin and Pb +\u00a0Quercetin groups were similar to those of the Control group, unlike the Pb group. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity of the Pb +\u00a0Quercetin group significantly improved with the addition of quercetin. We also found that malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of the kidney, liver, and heart were significantly reduced by quercetin supplementation. The glutathione, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities of the kidney, liver, and heart tissue were increased by quercetin supplementation. These results were in line with the observed apoptotic markers. The expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were significantly decreased by quercetin supplementation. It may be concluded that dietary supplementation with quercetin ameliorates the toxic effects of Pb exposure by alleviating oxidative stress, biochemical changes, and apoptosis in quails.", "journal": "Ecotoxicology and environmental safety", "date": "2022-01-21", "authors": ["Aslihan SurArslan", "IsmailSeven", "Seda IflazogluMutlu", "GozdeArkali", "NurgulBirben", "Pinar TatliSeven"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113200"}
{"title": "Clinical characteristics and histopathology of COVID-19 related deaths in South African adults.", "abstract": "Comparisons of histopathological features and microbiological findings between decedents with respiratory symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection or other causes, in settings with high prevalence of HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections have not been reported. Deaths associated with a positive ante-mortem SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and/or respiratory disease symptoms at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, South Africa from 15th April to 2nd November 2020, during the first wave of the South African COVID-19 epidemic, were investigated. Deceased adult patients had post-mortem minimally-invasive tissue sampling (MITS) performed to investigate for SARS-CoV-2 infection and molecular detection of putative pathogens on blood and lung samples, and histopathology examination of lung, liver and heart tissue. During the study period MITS were done in patients displaying symptoms of respiratory disease including 75 COVID-19-related deaths (COVID+) and 42 non-COVID-19-related deaths (COVID-). The prevalence of HIV-infection was lower in COVID+ (27%) than in the COVID- (64%), MTB detection was also less common among COVID+ (3% vs 13%). Lung histopathology findings showed differences between COVID+ and COVID- in the severity of the morphological appearance of Type-II pneumocytes, alveolar injury and repair initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

{"title": "Myocardial Afterload Is a Key Biomechanical Regulator of Atrioventricular Myocyte Differentiation in Zebrafish.", "abstract": "Heart valve development is governed by both genetic and biomechanical inputs. Prior work has demonstrated that oscillating shear stress associated with blood flow is required for normal atrioventricular (AV) valve development. Cardiac afterload is defined as the pressure the ventricle must overcome in order to pump blood throughout the circulatory system. In human patients, conditions of high afterload can cause valve pathology. Whether high afterload adversely affects embryonic valve development remains poorly understood. Here we describe a zebrafish model exhibiting increased myocardial afterload, caused by vasopressin, a vasoconstrictive drug. We show that the application of vasopressin reliably produces an increase in afterload without directly acting on cardiac tissue in zebrafish embryos. We have found that increased afterload alters the rate of growth of the cardiac chambers and causes remodeling of cardiomyocytes. Consistent with pathology seen in patients with clinically high afterload, we see defects in both the form and the function of the valve leaflets. Our results suggest that valve defects are due to changes in atrioventricular myocyte signaling, rather than pressure directly acting on the endothelial valve leaflet cells. Cardiac afterload should therefore be considered a biomechanical factor that particularly impacts embryonic valve development.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular development and disease", "date": "2022-01-21", "authors": ["NehaAhuja", "PaigeOstwald", "AlexGendernalik", "ElenaGuzzolino", "LetiziaPitto", "DavidBark", "Deborah MGarrity"], "doi": "10.3390/jcdd9010022\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.025\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01886-7\n10.5694/mja12.10811\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300853\n10.1007/s00018-015-1885-3\n10.1242/dev.131425\n10.1007/s13239-016-0280-z\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.709717\n10.1007/BF00877105\n10.1542/peds.73.1.43\n10.1007/s11936-015-0382-1\n10.1007/s00395-012-0307-z\n10.1001/jama.1996.03530440037034\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.04.005\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00287\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.05.012\n10.1002/dvdy.21669\n10.1016/j.cub.2015.03.038\n10.1007/s00424-011-0951-4\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.06.020\n10.1016/j.gep.2013.06.005\n10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.10.011\n10.1186/cc2338\n10.1186/s12859-017-1934-z\n10.1152/ajpheart.00721.2013\n10.1016/j.redox.2014.04.012\n10.1007/s13239-013-0120-3\n10.3791/3510\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.07.028\n10.1086/674770\n10.1152/ajpheart.1989.257.1.H55\n10.1002/dvdy.10356\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.12.005\n10.1101/gad.1629408\n10.1242/dev.067454\n10.1242/dev.124.21.4373\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.201566\n10.1242/dev.010694\n10.1038/ncomms11646\n10.1242/dev.01970\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1016/S0828-282X(06)70315-4\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000246\n10.1038/nature01282\n10.1242/dev.152124\n10.1002/bdra.20804\n10.1038/nature02028\n10.1093/cvr/cvw111\n10.1073/pnas.1202818109"}
{"title": "Effects of prenatal testosterone on cumulative markers of oxidative damage to organs of young adult zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).", "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that exposure of avian embryos to androgens in ovo entails long-term costs in the form of oxidative damage to vital cells and organs in adulthood. We injected zebra finch eggs with testosterone (T), monitored postnatal growth, and analyzed markers of oxidative damage in heart and liver in mature birds. We measured 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine and isoprostanes, markers of oxidative damage to DNA and membrane lipids, respectively. T treatment (1) reduced growth rates of female but not male nestlings vs. controls; (2) resulted in less accumulation of 8-oxo-dG, but not IsoPs, in liver tissue of 60-day-old females, but not males; and (3) a trend toward elevated 8-oxo-dG levels in heart tissue of males and females at 60 and 180\u00a0days old combined. These results generally support the testosterone oxidative damage hypothesis, in that embryonic exposure to higher T resulted in damage to DNA of heart tissue in both sexes. They also suggest that sex-specific effects of androgens on early growth rates may carry over as differences in some forms of oxidative damage in adults. This supports a basic tenet of evolutionary aging theory that developmental influences early in life can be linked to costs later on.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

{"title": "The Oxidative Balance Orchestrates the Main Keystones of the Functional Activity of Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "This review is aimed at providing an overview of the key hallmarks of cardiomyocytes in physiological and pathological conditions. The main feature of cardiac tissue is the force generation through contraction. This process requires a conspicuous energy demand and therefore an active metabolism. The cardiac tissue is rich of mitochondria, the powerhouses in cells. These organelles, producing ATP, are also the main sources of ROS whose altered handling can cause their accumulation and therefore triggers detrimental effects on mitochondria themselves and other cell components thus leading to apoptosis and cardiac diseases. This review highlights the metabolic aspects of cardiomyocytes and wanders through the main systems of these cells: (a) the unique structural organization (such as different protein complexes

{"title": "The ischemic model of chronic muscle spasm and pain.", "abstract": "This article was not intended to be a complete review of the electromyography of pathological muscle states, but it was written to illustrate how the \"Coletti Method of EMG ChemoDenervation\" (CMECD\u00ae) protocol for the treatment of chronic pain resulting from chronic muscle spasm was developed and established. That process led to an unexpected understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of chronic muscle spasm, which represents a paradigm shift in our understanding and ultimately in our treatment of muscle spasm-induced chronic pain. Other investigators had brought to light the presence of spontaneous electrical activity (SEA) in states of muscle spasm. Those findings were all but ignored by standard EMG/Nerve conduction studies in clinical practice. Starting with a simple EMG device I experimented with various medications to treat patients with chronic pain associated with chronic muscle spasm. Suppression of SEA with long-acting medications resolved both the chronic spasm and chronic pain. A successful protocol using phenoxybenzamine was established and clinical outcomes were followed. More than 200 patients were successfully treated during last 12 years. Correlating known exercise muscle physiology with the development of the pathological state of chronic muscle spasm as seen by electromyography led to the postulation of the ischemic model of chronic muscle spasm. Light microscopy pathophysiologic supportive findings are presented and discussed. Predictions from this model to various aspects of treatment were supportive. Implications regarding treatment by the CMECD\uf6da procedure, as well as other standard therapies, are discussed. Application of the ischemic model to other pain conditions was explored with implications of therapeutic modification. Recommendations for changes in rehabilitation therapy are discussed.", "journal": "European journal of translational myology", "date": "2022-01-20", "authors": ["Roger HColetti"], "doi": "10.4081/ejtm.2022.10323\n10.1002/mus.26647"}
{"title": "Methazolamide Attenuates the Development of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy by Promoting \u03b2-Catenin Degradation in Type 1 Diabetic Mice.", "abstract": "Methazolamide (MTZ), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and exert a hypoglycemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic db/db mice. However, whether MTZ has a cardioprotective effect in the setting of diabetic cardiomyopathy is not clear. We investigated the effects of MTZ in a mouse model of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Diabetic mice received MTZ by intragastric gavage (10, 25, or 50 mg/kg, daily for 16 weeks). In the diabetic group, MTZ significantly reduced both random and fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner. MTZ ameliorated T1DM-induced changes in cardiac morphology and dysfunction. Mechanistic analysis revealed that MTZ blunted T1DM-induced enhanced expression of \u03b2-catenin. Similar results were observed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and adult mouse cardiomyocytes treated with high glucose or Wnt3a (a \u03b2-catenin activator). There was no significant change in \u03b2-catenin mRNA levels in cardiac tissues or NRCMs. MTZ-mediated \u03b2-catenin downregulation was recovered by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses showed augmentation of AXIN1-\u03b2-catenin interaction by MTZ in T1DM hearts and in NRCMs treated with Wnt3a; thus, MTZ may potentiate AXIN1-\u03b2-catenin linkage to increase \u03b2-catenin degradation. Overall, MTZ may alleviate cardiac hypertrophy by mediating AXIN1-\u03b2-catenin interaction to promote degradation and inhibition of \u03b2-catenin activity. These findings may help inform novel therapeutic strategy to prevent heart failure in patients with diabetes.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2022-01-20", "authors": ["XiaoqingChen", "YilangLi", "XunYuan", "WenchangYuan", "ConglinLi", "YueZeng", "YulingLian", "XiaoxiaQiu", "YuanQin", "GuipingZhang", "XiawenLiu", "ChengfengLuo", "Jian-DongLuo", "NingHou"], "doi": "10.2337/db21-0506"}
{"title": "Heart-on-Chip for Combined Cellular Dynamics Measurements and Computational Modeling Towards Clinical Applications.", "abstract": "Organ-on-chip or micro-engineered three-dimensional cellular or tissue models are increasingly implemented in the study of cardiovascular pathophysiology as alternatives to traditional in vitro cell culture. Drug induced cardiotoxicity is a key issue in drug development pipelines, but the current in vitro and in vivo studies suffer from inter-species differences, high costs, and lack of reliability and accuracy in predicting cardiotoxicity. Microfluidic heart-on-chip devices can impose a paradigm shift to the current tools. They can not only recapitulate cardiac tissue level functionality and the communication between cells and extracellular matrices but also allow higher throughput studies conducive to drug screening especially with their added functionalities or sensors that extract disease-specific phenotypic, genotypic, and electrophysiological information in real-time. Such electrical and mechanical components can tailor the electrophysiology and mechanobiology of the experiment to better mimic the in vivo condition as well. Recent advancements and challenges are reviewed in the fabrication, functionalization and sensor assisted mechanical and electrophysiological measurements, numerical and computational modeling of cardiomyocytes' behavior, and the clinical applications in drug screening and disease modeling.

{"title": "Sclerostin Protects Against Vascular Calcification Development in Mice.", "abstract": "Sclerostin is a negative regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and is, therefore, an important inhibitor of bone formation and turnover. Because ectopic vascular calcification develops in a similar way to bone formation, one might reasonably attribute a role to sclerostin in this pathological process. Ectopic calcification, especially vascular calcification, importantly contributes to mortality in elderly and patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypertension. The central players in this ectopic calcification process are the vascular smooth muscle cells that undergo dedifferentiation and thereby acquire characteristics of bonelike cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that depletion/deactivation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibitor sclerostin may promote the development of ectopic calcifications through stimulation of bone-anabolic effects at the level of the arteries. We investigated the role of sclerostin (encoded by the Sost gene) during vascular calcification by using either Sost", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2022-01-18", "authors": ["AnneliesDe Mar\u00e9", "BrittOpdebeeck", "EllenNeven", "Patrick CD'Haese", "AnjaVerhulst"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.4503"}

Therefore, we evaluated eight weeks of exercise, caloric restriction, and spirulina algae consumption on the heart in obese rats. In this study, obese rats were compared with a healthy group. First, we induced obese rats with a 60%-high-fat diet. Then, after eight weeks, obese rats were randomly divided into eight groups: obese rats without treatment (HFD), obese rats treated with spirulina algae (HFD-SA), obese rats conducted exercise (HFD-EX), obese rats treated with spirulina algae and exercise (HFD-SA+EX), obese rats treated with caloric restriction (HFD-CR), obese rats treated with caloric restriction and exercise (HFD-CR+EX), obese rats treated with spirulina algae and caloric restriction (HFD-SA+CR), and obese rats treated with SA+CR+EX (HFD-SA+CR+EX). Also, the exercise protocol was performed for eight weeks, three sessions per week at an intensity of 80%-110% of maximum running speed. The spirulina algae were consumed by gavage (100\u00a0mg/kg/day), and caloric restriction used 60% of the food consumed. We found that SA+CR+EX significantly modified the Nrf1/Tfam/MGMT and ATP5A1 network in cardiovascular disease-inducing obesity rats (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Moreover, we predicted SA could be bound to Tfam and MGMT protein targets. Hence, exercise, caloric restriction, and spirulina algae had a synergistic effect on mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart tissue of obese rats (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: According to artificial intelligence and medical biology servers, we discovered that mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress are dominant phenomena in the cardiovascular system. Nrf1/Tfam/MGMT and ATP5A1, as pivotal regulators of oxidative stress, could play an utmost important role in the cardiovascular disease-inducing obesity molecular pathway. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that environmental factors such as the western diet and physical inactivity disrupted the mitochondrial dynamic, which led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). We predicted the binding power of the Spirulina's small molecules on Tfam and Mgmt proteins based on drug-discovery technology and pharmacokinetic parameters. Considering oxidative stress and mitochondrial machinery related to the action of some molecular pathways, mitochondria-related nuclear-encoded proteins, and ROS, this study evaluated the high-intensity interval training, caloric restriction, and spirulina consumption on heart mitochondrial biogenesis in obese rats.

Nevertheless, its therapeutic efficacy remains low, which is mainly ascribed to the low viability of transplanted MSCs. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to participate in diverse physiological and pathological processes, but little is known about their role in MSC survival. Using unbiased transcriptome profiling of hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs (HP-MSCs) and normoxic MSCs (N-MSCs), we identified a lncRNA named lung cancer-associated transcript 1 (LUCAT1) under hypoxia. LUCAT1 knockdown reduced the survival of engrafted MSCs and decreased the MSC-based therapeutic potency, as shown by impaired cardiac function, reduced cardiomyocyte survival, and increased fibrosis post-MI. Conversely, LUCAT1 overexpression had the opposite results.

First, the chamber became more spherical; second, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 were activated and this may have contributed to hypertrophy and atrial enlargement, until systolic dysfunction occurred.\nThis study showed a sequence of abnormalities that preceded myocardial dysfunction in an experimental model of AR.

In this study, we characterized the cardiac and circulatory lipid profiles in late gestation E18.5 fetuses of diet-induced obese pregnant mice and established the changes in lipid abundance and fetal cardiac transcriptomics. We used untargeted and targeted lipidomics and transcriptomics to define changes in the serum and cardiac lipid composition and fatty acid metabolism in male and female fetuses. From these analyses we observed: (1) maternal obesity affects the maternal and fetal serum lipidome distinctly; (2) female fetal heart lipidomes are more sensitive to maternal obesity than males; (3) changes in lipid supply might contribute to early expression of lipolytic genes in mouse hearts exposed to maternal obesity. These results highlight the existence of sexually dimorphic responses of the fetal heart to the same in utero obesogenic environment and identify lipids species that might mediate programming of cardiovascular health.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2022-01-14", "authors": ["Lucas CPantale\u00e3o", "IsabellaInzani", "SamuelFurse", "ElenaLoche", "AntoniaHufnagel", "ThomasAshmore", "Heather LBlackmore", "BenjaminJenkins", "Asha A MCarpenter", "AniaWilczynska", "MartinBushell", "AlbertKoulman", "Denise SFernandez-Twinn", "Susan EOzanne"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.69078\n10.1016/j.molmet.2020.101116\n10.1038/s41598-017-17204-5\n10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01809.x\n10.1079/BJN2002662\n10.1136/bmj.j1\n10.1016/j.molmet.2018.04.007\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.08.023\n10.1016/j.chroma.2020.460849\n10.1038/srep44650\n10.3390/nu11051122\n10.1007/s00216-020-02511-0\n10.1038/s42003-021-01686-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32203-7\n10.1073/pnas.1216959110\n10.1007/s00216-018-0863-7\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00786\n10.1161/JAHA.119.011541\n10.1515/hmbci-2015-0025\n10.1530/REP-16-0495\n10.1016/B978-0-12-416618-9.00020-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0194797\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000744\n10.1093/cvr/cvy082\n10.1038/s41598-018-31832-5\n10.1093/gigascience/giz061\n10.1016/S0169-7439(96)00007-X\n10.1007/s00125-019-05037-y\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00959\n10.1113/JP275422\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.051921\n10.1021/bi047773a\n10.1093/nar/gkl838\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.08.017\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2017.04.006\n10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2530614.x\n10.1152/ajpendo.00297.2018\n10.1038/s41598-019-54098-x\n10.1111/nure.12068\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002910"}

In this review, the key design principles and various supramolecular strategies to construct adhesive hydrogels are comprehensively summarized. Thereafter, the recent research progress regarding their tissue engineering applications, including primarily dermal tissue repair, muscle tissue repair, bone tissue repair, neural tissue repair, vascular tissue repair, oral tissue repair, corneal tissue repair, cardiac tissue repair, fetal membrane repair, hepatic tissue repair, and gastric tissue repair, is systematically highlighted.

{"title": "Protective Effects of Chrysin against Cyclophosphamide-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Rats: A Biochemical and Histopathological Approach.", "abstract": "Mounting evidences have indicated that cyclophosphamide (CyC)a potent anticancer and cytotoxic agent is associated with various organ and systemic toxicities and the cytotoxic effects observed after administration of CyC still challenges its clinical use. Chrysin (Chy) is a dietary flavonoid with prevailing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study evaluated the protective properties of Chy against CyC-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The animals were orally treated with Chy (25 and 50\u2005mg/kg/day) for 35\u2005days and exposed to CyC (i.\u2009p., 100\u2005mg/kg) once a week for four weeks. The results indicated that CyC caused significant cardiotoxicity as manifested by notable increases in heart weight, cardiac function biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), troponin T and aspartate transaminase (AST). In addition, cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL1 \u03b2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were considerably increased. Meanwhile, cardiac antioxidant enzymes activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), as well as glutathione (GSH) level were suppressed, while H&E stained histopathological assessment showed marked alterations in cardiac tissues. CyC also significantly lowered red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) parameters, whereas treatment with Chy significantly restored the altered biochemical and histopathological features. Conclusively, aforementioned results inferred that Chy offered cardioprotective potentials against CyC-induced cardiotoxicity which may be due to its antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.", "journal": "Chemistry & biodiversity", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["BinYe", "WenchaoLing", "YinhuaWang", "AmitJaisi", "Opeyemi JoshuaOlatunji"], "doi": "10.1002/cbdv.202100886"}
{"title": "Tanshinone IIA from Salvia miltiorrhiza exerts anti-fibrotic effects on cardiac fibroblasts and rat heart tissues by suppressing the levels of pro-fibrotic factors: The key role of miR-618.", "abstract": "Tanshinone IIA (TAN) is widely employed for handling cardiovascular disorders. The current study explored the potential role of miRs in the antifibrotic effect of TAN on heart. Fibrotic features were induced in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and in rat hearts, and then handled with TAN. MicroRNAs (miRs) responding to TAN were determined using a microarray assay. The selected miR was modulated to verify its role in antifibrotic effects of TAN. TAN suppressed the viability and the production of \u03b1-SMA in CFs, which was associated with 101 miR being upregulated and 223 miR being downregulated. MiR-618 was selected as the potential target of TAN. Ang II inhibited miR-618 level and resulted in the upregulation of pro-fibrosis factors, which was reversed by TAN. The antifibrotic effect of TAN was weakened by miR-618 inhibition. TAN inhibits hypertrophy and collagen deposition in heart tissues, which is associated with the increased level of miR-618. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The findings outlined in the current study show that the antifibrotic function of TAN is closely related to the function of miRs: the induction of miR-618 is indispensable for the function of TAN against the fibrotic process after heart injury, which will promote the application of TAN as an adjuvant therapy for improving heart function.", "journal": "Journal of food biochemistry", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["NaYan", "ChunqingXiao", "XiangguiWang", "ZufangXu", "JiangyongYang"], "doi": "10.1111/jfbc.14078"}
{"title": "Controlling Morphology and Functions of Cardiac Organoids by Two-Dimensional Geometrical Templates.", "abstract": "Traditionally, tissue-specific organoids are generated as 3D aggregates of stem cells embedded in Matrigel or hydrogels, and the aggregates eventually end up a spherical shape and suspended in the matrix. Lack of geometrical control of organoid formation makes these spherical organoids limited for modeling the tissues with complex shapes. To address this challenge, we developed a new method to generate 3D spatial-organized cardiac organoids from 2D micropatterned human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies, instead of directly from 3D stem cell aggregates. This new approach opens the possibility to create cardiac organoids that are templated by 2D non-spherical geometries, which potentially provides us a deeper understanding of biophysical controls on developmental organogenesis. Here, we designed 2D geometrical templates with quadrilateral shapes and pentagram shapes that had same total area but different geometrical shapes. Using this templated substrate, we grew cardiac organoids from hiPSCs and collected a series of parameters to characterize morphological and functional properties of the cardiac organoids. In quadrilateral templates, we found that increasing the aspect ratio impaired cardiac tissue 3D self-assembly, but the elongated geometry improved the cardiac contractile functions. However, in pentagram templates, cardiac organoid structure and function were optimized with a specific geometry of an ideal star shape. This study will shed a light on \"organogenesis-by-design\" by increasing the intricacy of starting templates from external geometrical cues to improve the organoid morphogenesis and functionality.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2022-01-11", "authors": ["PlanskyHoang", "ShiyangSun", "Bearett ATarris", "ZhenMa"], "doi": "10.1159/000521787\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119339\n10.1002/ggn2.202100011\n10.1038/s41467-020-18031-5\n10.1038/s41467-021-25329-5\n10.1038/ncomms8413\n10.1242/dev.172791"}

Further characterisation of associated cell type-specific regulation can broaden our understanding of how GWAS signals may contribute to disease risk.\nTo gain insight into potential functional mechanisms underlying GWAS associations, we developed FORGE2 ( https://forge2.altiusinstitute.org/ ), which is an updated version of the FORGE web tool. FORGE2 uses an expanded atlas of cell type-specific regulatory element annotations, including DNase I hotspots, five histone mark categories and 15 hidden Markov model (HMM) chromatin states, to identify tissue- and cell type-specific signals. An analysis of 3,604 GWAS from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalogue yielded at least one significant disease/trait-tissue association for 2,057 GWAS, including >\u2009400 associations specific to epigenomic marks in immune tissues and cell types, >\u200930 associations specific to heart tissue, and >\u200960 associations specific to brain tissue, highlighting the key potential of tissue- and cell type-specific regulatory elements. Importantly, we demonstrate that FORGE2 analysis can separate previously observed accessible chromatin enrichments into different chromatin states, such as enhancers or active transcription start sites, providing a greater understanding of underlying regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, tissue-specific enrichments for repressive chromatin states and histone marks were also detected, suggesting a role for tissue-specific repressed regions in GWAS-mediated disease aetiology.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that FORGE2 has the potential to uncover previously unreported disease-tissue associations and identify new candidate mechanisms.

The heart tissues were obtained from removing excessive myocardium discharged during the repair surgery of an excessive right atrial hypertrophy due to a congenital disease. The transportation temperature studied was the most used temperature (4 \u00b0C) or the conventional condition, compared to a physiological temperature(37 \u00b0C). The heart tissues were transported from the operating theatre to the lab maintained less than 30\u00a0min consistently. Single-cell isolation was enzymatically and mechanically performed using collagenase-V (160\u00a0U/mg) and proteinase-XXIV (7-14 U/mg) following the previously described protocol. The impact of temperature differences was observed by the density of cells harvested per mg tissue, cell viability, and the senescence signals, identified by the p21, p53 and caspase-9 mRNA expressions. Results the heart tissue transported at 37 \u00b0C yielded significantly higher viable cell density (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) yielded viable cells significantly higher density (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than the 4 \u00b0C; 2,335\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0849 cells per mg tissue, and 732\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0425 cells per mg tissue, respectively.

However, it remains unclear whether the control of cardiomyocyte alignment influences cardiac function and the underlying mechanisms. We fabricated aligned human cardiac tissue using a micro-processed fibrin gel with inverted V-shaped ridges (MFG) and elucidated the effect of alignment control on contractile properties. When human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were seeded on MFG, hiPSC-CMs were aligned more uniformly than the control, and we succeeded in fabricating the aligned cardiac tissue. Assessing the contractile properties with the direct contractile measurement system, the contractile force, maximum contractile velocity, and relaxation velocity were significantly increased in aligned cardiac tissue compared with non-aligned cardiac tissue. However, gene expression profiles were not different between the two groups, suggesting that functional improvement of cardiac tissue through alignment control might not be dependent on cardiomyocyte maturation. Motion capture analysis revealed that the cardiomyocytes in the aligned cardiac tissues showed more unidirectional and synchronous contraction than the non-aligned cardiac tissues, indicating that cardiac tissue maturation involves electrical integration of cardiomyocytes.

The extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from mesenchymal stem cells and zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) have been believed to be involved in the regulation of MI, but the mechanism has not been fully clarified. Left anterior descending artery ligation was used to establish MI animal model, hypoxia treatment was applied to establish MI cell model. CCK8, transwell, and wound healing methods were applied to measure cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Overexpression of ZFAS1 was established via transfecting pcDNA-ZFAS1. Overexpression of ZFAS1 significantly reversed the influence of EVs on cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Similar effect of EVs and ZFAS1 on morphological changes of MI rat heart tissues were also observed. The activation of Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway by EVs was remarkably suppressed by pcDNA-ZFAS1. Inhibitor of Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway remarkably reversed the impact of EVs on the cell viability. EVs might improve MI through inhibiting ZFAS1 and promoting Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

However, cardiotoxicity associated with IMA is included among the therapeutic strategies. The present study was aimed to discover whether ferroptosis, a programmed iron-dependent cell death, is involved in IMA-induced cardiotoxicity. In vivo, mouse model was established after treated with 25\u00a0mg/kg, 50\u00a0mg/kg and 100\u00a0mg/kg IMA. Serum CK, LDH, AST activities were determined. Cardiac tissues were examined by H&E and Oil Red O staining. MDA was measured to assess production of lipid peroxide. Tissue iron and GSH content were measured. In vitro, cell viability, mitochondria membrane potential, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular iron levels were performed to explore the mechanism of IMA. The in vivo results revealed that IMA treatment significantly increased serum CK, LDH and AST. H&E staining showed that IMA caused cardiac structural injuries. The dose-dependent decrease of GSH and increase of tissue iron and MDA were observed in IMA-treated groups. Oil Red O staining suggested obvious cardiac lipid accumulation after treated with IMA. In H9c2 cardiomyocytes, IMA significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Mitochondria membrane potential assay showed that IMA destroyed the mitochondrial function. Additionally, IMA increased the cellular ROS and iron levels. Furthermore, IMA down-regulated the expression of Nrf2 and up-regulated the expression of P53 and TfR.

A two-stage optimisation process is used to retrieve the cardiac conductivities from cardiac potentials measured on a multi-electrode array-the first stage simultaneously fits all six conductivities, and the second stage fits a subset of the conductivities (intracellular conductivities), while holding the remainder of the conductivities (extracellular conductivities) constant. Previous studies have shown that the intracellular conductivities are retrieved to a lesser degree of accuracy than extracellular conductivities. This study tests the proposition that there exists a relationship between the extracellular and intracellular conductivities during the second stage of the optimisation that affects the accuracy of the retrieved intracellular conductivities. A measure to quantify this relationship is developed using polynomial chaos. The results show that a significant relationship does exist, and thus any errors in the extracellular conductivities are magnified in the retrieved intracellular conductivities.

In this regard, a silk-based cardiac tissue (CT) coupled with a dynamic perfusion-based mechanical stimulation platform (DMM) for achieving maturation and functionality in vitro is tried to be delivered. Silk fibroin (SF) is used to fabricate lamellar scaffolds to provide native tissue-like anisotropic architecture and is found to be nonimmunogenic and biocompatible allowing cardiomyocyte attachment and growth in vitro. Further, the scaffolds display excellent mechanical properties by their ability to undergo cyclic compressions without any deformation when places in the DMM. Gradient compression strains (5% to 20%), mimicking the native physiological and pathological conditions, are applied to the cardiomyocyte culture seeded on lamellar silk scaffolds in the DMM.

Furthermore, our knowledge on the consequences of mutated proteins has deepened, with relevance for cellular homeostasis, protein quality control and toxicity, often specific to particular cardiomyopathies, with precise effects explaining the aberrations. This has opened up new avenues to treat cardiomyopathies, using contemporary techniques from the molecular toolbox, such as gene editing and repair using CRISPR-Cas9 techniques, antisense therapies, novel designer drugs, and RNA therapies.

{"title": "Voltage-mediated mechanism for calcium wave synchronization and arrhythmogenesis in atrial tissue.", "abstract": "A wide range of atrial arrythmias are caused by molecular defects in proteins that regulate calcium (Ca) cycling. In many cases, these defects promote the propagation of subcellular Ca waves in the cell, which can perturb the voltage time course and induce dangerous perturbations of the action potential (AP). However, subcellular Ca waves occur randomly in cells and, therefore, electrical coupling between cells substantially decreases their effect on the AP. In this study, we present evidence that Ca waves in atrial tissue can synchronize in-phase owing to an order-disorder phase transition. In particular, we show that, below a critical pacing rate, Ca waves are desynchronized and therefore do not induce substantial AP fluctuations in tissue. However, above this critical pacing rate, Ca waves gradually synchronize over millions of cells, which leads to a dramatic amplification of AP fluctuations. We exploit an underlying Ising symmetry of paced cardiac tissue to show that this transition exhibits universal properties common to a wide range of physical systems in nature. Finally, we show that in the heart, phase synchronization induces spatially out-of-phase AP duration alternans which drives wave break and reentry.

Despite increasing number of publications using these models, comparative characterization of these cell lines has not been performed, therefore, their limitations are undetermined. We aimed to compare cardiac cell lines to primary cardiomyocytes and to mature cardiac tissues in a systematic manner.\nCardiac cell lines (H9C2, AC16, HL-1) were differentiated with widely used protocols. Left ventricular tissue, neonatal primary cardiomyocytes, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes served as reference tissue or cells. RNA expression of cardiac markers (e.g. Tnnt2, Ryr2) was markedly lower in cell lines compared to references. Differentiation induced increase in cardiac- and decrease in embryonic markers however, the overall transcriptomic profile and annotation to relevant biological processes showed consistently less pronounced cardiac phenotype in all cell lines in comparison to the corresponding references. Immunocytochemistry confirmed low expressions of structural protein sarcomeric alpha-actinin, troponin I and caveolin-3 in cell lines. Susceptibility of cell lines to sI/R injury in terms of viability as well as mitochondrial polarization differed from the primary cells irrespective of their degree of differentiation.\nExpression patterns of cardiomyocyte markers and whole transcriptomic profile, as well as response to sI/R, and to hypertrophic stimuli indicate low-to-moderate similarity of cell lines to primary cells/cardiac tissues regardless their differentiation.

We hypothesized that combined treatment with rapamycin and HO-3867 is superior to either alone in attenuating MCT-induced rat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Pulmonary arterial hypertension was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of monocrotaline (60\u00a0mg/kg). 2 weeks later, rapamycin (2\u00a0mg/kg i.p.) and HO3867 (10\u00a0mg/kg i.h.) were administered daily, alone and in combination, for 2 weeks. Right ventricular systolic pressure, echocardiography were recorded and then rats were sacrificed. Histological analysis of pulmonary arteries medial wall thickness, right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI), the ratio of right ventricular to body weight, and collagen volume fraction (CVF) of right ventricular were performed. Moreover, the expression of t-STAT3, p-STAT3, t-Akt, p-Akt in lung and t-STAT3, p-STAT3, t-S6, p-S6 in right ventricular were examined. The result showed that combined treatment provided a considerable improvement toward maintaining hemodynamic changes, lung vascular remodeling as well as amending RV remodeling and function. Furthermore, Combined treatment can normalize the protein levels of two signal pathways in lung and heart tissue, where p-S6 or p-Akt significantly decreased compared to HO-3867 alone, or p-STAT3 significantly reduced compared to rapamycin alone.

In vitro, rat primary CMECs were stimulated by homocysteine (Hcy). The apoptosis of CMECs was measured using flow cytometry.

Electromechanical wave imaging (EWI) is an ultrafast ultrasound-based method used to map the propagation of the local contraction triggered by electrical activation of the heart. This study introduces a novel way to characterize cardiac activation based on the time evolution of the instantaneous frequency content of the cardiac tissue displacement curves. The first validation of this method was performed on an ex vivo dataset of 36 acquisitions acquired from two working heart models in paced rhythms. It was shown that the activation mapping described by spectral analysis of interframe displacement is similar to the standard EWI method based on zero-crossing of interframe strain. An average median error of 3.3 ms was found in the ex vivo dataset between the activation maps obtained with the two methods. The feasibility of mapping cardiac activation by EWI was then investigated on two open-chest pigs during sinus and paced rhythms in a pilot trial of cardiac mapping with an intracardiac probe. Seventy-five acquisitions were performed with reasonable stability and analyzed with the novel algorithm to map cardiac contraction propagation in the left ventricle (LV). Sixty-one qualitatively continuous isochrones were successfully computed based on this method. The region of contraction onset was coherently described while pacing in the imaging plane.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the antioxidant effect of SchB can antagonize the cardiotoxicity of THP. Changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography and serum lactate dehydrogenase, brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin T levels were used to detect the degree of cardiac damage. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde, catalase and total antioxidant capacity in the serum and heart were measured to observe the oxidative stress state of rats. Primary cardiomyocytes were cultured, and cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were detected. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of SOD2, NOX2, pro/cleaved-caspase3 and Bcl-2/Bax in heart tissue and primary cardiomyocytes to verify the related signaling pathways. THP-treated rats showed a range of cardiac damage, including an abnormal ECG, echocardiography and myocardial enzymes. In the cellular experiments, cell viability decreased and ROS increased. However, this damage was alleviated after SchB treatment. Further studies demonstrated that SchB antagonized THP cardiotoxicity via its antioxidant effect.

Cardiovascular tissue biobanking provides a unique opportunity to utilize cardiac and vascular samples for translational research into heart failure and other related pathologies. Current techniques for diagnosis, classification, and treatment monitoring of cardiac disease relies primarily on interpretation of clinical signs, imaging, and blood biomarkers. Further research at the disease source (i.e. myocardium and blood vessels) has been limited by a relative lack of access to quality human cardiac tissue and the inherent shortcomings of most animal models of heart disease. In this review, we describe a model for cardiovascular tissue biobanking and databasing, and its potential to facilitate basic and translational research. We share techniques to procure endocardial samples from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, in addition to aortic disease samples. We discuss some of the issues with respect to data collection, privacy, biobank consent, and the governance of tissue biobanking. The development of tissue biobanks as described here has significant scope to improve and facilitate translational research in multi-omic fields such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

{"title": "What gets on the nerves of cardiac patients? Pathophysiological changes in cardiac innervation.", "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system regulates cardiac function by balancing the actions of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs to the heart. Intrinsic cardiac neurocircuits integrate these autonomic signals to fine-tune cardiac control, and sensory feedback loops regulate autonomic transmission in the face of external stimuli. These interconnected neural systems allow the heart to adapt to constantly changing circumstances that range from simple fluctuations in body position to running a marathon. The cardiac reflexes that serve to maintain homeostasis in health are disrupted in many disease states. This is often characterized by increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic transmission. Studies of cardiovascular disease reveal remodelling of cardiac neurocircuits at several functional and anatomical levels. Central circuits change so that sympathetic pathways become hyperactive, while parasympathetic circuits exhibit decreased activity. Peripheral sensory nerves also become hyperactive in disease, which increases patients' risk for poor cardiac outcomes. Injury and disease also alter the types of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides released by autonomic nerves in the heart, and can lead to regional hyperinnervation (increased nerve density) or denervation (decreased nerve density) of cardiac tissue. The mechanisms responsible for neural remodelling are not fully understood, but neurotrophins and inflammatory cytokines are likely involved.

{"title": "Links between ceramides and cardiac function.", "abstract": "Total ceramide levels in cardiac tissue relate to cardiac dysfunction in animal models. However, emerging evidence suggests that the fatty acyl chain length of ceramides also impacts their relationship to cardiac function. This review explores evidence regarding the relationship between ceramides and left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. It further explores possible mechanisms underlying these relationships.\nIn large, community-based cohorts, a higher ratio of specific plasma ceramides, C16\u200a:\u200a0/C24\u200a:\u200a0, related to worse left ventricular dysfunction. Increased left ventricular mass correlated with plasma C16\u200a:\u200a0/C24\u200a:\u200a0, but this relationship became nonsignificant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Decreased left atrial function and increased left atrial size also related to C16\u200a:\u200a0/C24\u200a:\u200a0. Furthermore, increased incident heart failure, overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and all-cause mortality were associated with higher C16\u200a:\u200a0/C24\u200a:\u200a0 (or lower C24\u200a:\u200a0/C16\u200a:\u200a0).

Here, we determined whether whole-life exposure to environmentally relevant, low-dose cadmium affects the susceptibility of offspring to post-weaning HFD-induced cardiac pathologies and function. Besides, we also determined whether these effects are sex-dependent. Male and female mice were exposed to cadmium-containing (0, 0.5, or 5 parts per million [ppm]) drinking water before breeding; the pregnant mice and dams with offspring continually drank the same cadmium-containing water. After weaning, the offspring were continued on the same regime as their parents and fed either a HFD or normal fat diet for 24\u00a0weeks. Cardiac function was examined with echocardiography. Cardiac tissues were used for the histopathological and biochemical (gene and protein expression by real-time PCR and Western blotting) assays. Results showed a dose-dependent cadmium accumulation in the hearts of male and female mice along with decreased cardiac zinc and copper levels only in female offspring. Exposure to 5\u00a0ppm, but not 0.5\u00a0ppm, cadmium significantly enhanced HFD cardiac effects only in female mice, shown by worsened cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction (ejection fraction, mitral E-to-annular e' ratio), increased fibrosis (collagen, fibronectin, collagen1A1), hypertrophy (cardiomyocyte size, atrial natriuretic peptide, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain), and inflammation (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1), compared to the HFD group. These synergistic effects were associated with activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway and increased oxidative stress, shown by 3-nitrotyrosine and malondialdehyde, along with decreased metallothionein expression.

{"title": "Recent advances on bioengineering approaches for fabrication of functional engineered cardiac pumps: A review.", "abstract": "The field of cardiac tissue engineering has advanced over the past decades; however, most research progress has been limited to engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) at the microscale with minimal geometrical complexities such as 3D strips and patches. Although microscale ECTs are advantageous for drug screening applications because of their high-throughput and standardization characteristics, they have limited translational applications in heart repair and the in vitro modeling of cardiac function and diseases. Recently, researchers have made various attempts to construct engineered cardiac pumps (ECPs) such as chambered ventricles, recapitulating the geometrical complexity of the native heart. The transition from microscale ECTs to ECPs at a translatable scale would greatly accelerate their translational applications; however, researchers are confronted with several major hurdles, including geometrical reconstruction, vascularization, and functional maturation. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to review the recent advances on bioengineering approaches for fabrication of functional engineered cardiac pumps. We first review the bioengineering approaches to fabricate ECPs, and then emphasize the unmatched potential of 3D bioprinting techniques. We highlight key advances in bioprinting strategies with high cell density as researchers have begun to realize the critical role that the cell density of non-proliferative cardiomyocytes plays in the cell-cell interaction and functional contracting performance. We summarize the current approaches to engineering vasculatures both at micro- and meso-scales, crucial for the survival of thick cardiac tissues and ECPs. We showcase a variety of strategies developed to enable the functional maturation of cardiac tissues, mimicking the in vivo environment during cardiac development. By highlighting state-of-the-art research, this review offers personal perspectives on future opportunities and trends that may bring us closer to the promise of functional ECPs.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2021-12-06", "authors": ["YongcongFang", "WeiSun", "TingZhang", "ZhuoXiong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121298"}

Patients diagnosed with both NM and infantile cardiomyopathy are very rare. A male infant presented, within the first few hours of life, with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, biventricular dysfunction and left ventricular noncompaction. A muscle biopsy on the 8th day of life from the right sternocleidomastoid muscle identified nemaline rods. Whole exome sequencing identified a c.1288 delT (homozygous pathogenic variant) in the CAP2 gene (NM_006366), yielding a CAP2 protein (NP_006357.1) with a p.C430fs. Both parents were heterozygous for the same variant but have no history of heart or muscle disease. Analysis of patient derived fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells confirmed the p.C430fs mutation (pathogenic variant), which appears to cause loss of both CAP2 protein and mRNA. The CAP2 gene encodes cyclase associated protein 2, an actin monomer binding and filament depolymerizing protein and CAP2 knockout mice develop severe dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness. The patient underwent a heart transplant at 1 year of age. Heart tissue explanted at that time also showed nemaline rods and additionally disintegration of the myofibrillar structure.

The P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) receptor is an ATP-gated ion channel that is predominantly expressed in immune cells and plays a key role in inflammatory processes. We investigated the role of G-Rg1 in sepsis-related cardiac dysfunction and the underlying mechanism involving the regulation of the P2X7 receptor. We detected cell viability, cytotoxicity, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) with or without G-Rg1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9c2 cell models of ischemia/reperfusion injury. We applied cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce a mouse model of sepsis and measured the survival duration and cardiac function of CLP mice. Next, we quantified the ROS level, MMP, respiratory chain complex I-IV enzymatic activity, and mitochondrial fusion in CLP mouse heart tissues. We then investigated the role of G-Rg1 in repairing LPS-induced cell mitochondrial damage, including mitochondrial superoxidation products. The results showed that G-Rg1 inhibited LPS- or H/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cytotoxicity, ROS levels, and mitochondrial damage. In addition, G-Rg1 prolonged the survival time of CLP mice. G-Rg1 attenuated LPS-induced superoxide production in the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes and the excessive release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Most importantly, G-Rg1 suppressed LPS-mediated induction of proapoptotic Bax, activated Akt, induced GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, and balanced mitochondrial calcium levels.

Despite the therapeutic advances of the last decades, MI still begets extensive death rates around the world. The pathophysiology of the disease correlates with cardiomyocyte necrosis, caused by an imbalance in the demand of oxygen to cardiac tissues, resulting from obstruction of the coronary flow. To alleviate the severe effects of MI, the use of various biomaterials exhibit vast potential in cardiac repair and regeneration, acting as native extracellular matrices. These hydrogels have been combined with nano sized or functional materials which possess unique electrical, mechanical, and topographical properties that play important roles in regulating phenotypes and the contractile function of cardiomyocytes even in adverse microenvironments. These nano-biomaterials' differential properties have led to substantial healing on in vivo cardiac injury models by promoting fibrotic scar reduction, hemodynamic function preservation, and benign cardiac remodeling. In this review, we discuss the interplay of the unique physical properties of electrically conductive nano-biomaterials, are able to manipulate the phenotypes and the electrophysiological behavior of cardiomyocytes in vitro, and can enhance heart regeneration in vivo. Consequently, the understanding of the decisive roles of the nano-biomaterials discussed in this review could be useful for designing novel nano-biomaterials in future research for cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration.

Yet, the effect of PFOS exposure on cardiac toxicity in adult rats has, to our knowledge, not been reported and the mechanism still remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the toxicity of PFOS on rat hearts and any associated mechanisms. Rats were exposed to 0 (control), 1 and 10 mg/kg PFOS every other day for 14 days. Body weight and heart weight were recorded. The serum levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin-T (cTn-T) in heart tissues were measured using biochemical assays. TUNEL staining and western blotting were applied to analyze levels of apoptosis in rat hearts. Pathological assessment and immunohistochemistry analysis of heart tissues were used to evaluate the levels of PFOS-induced cardiotoxicity and inflammatory infiltration. PFOS exposure at the dosage of 10 mg/kg significantly increased the percentage of heart to body weight; however, it did not alter the body weight. At 10 mg/kg, PFOS significantly increased expression levels of myocardial injury markers, such as cTn-T, LDH, CK and CK-MB, while 1 mg/kg PFOS upregulated the expression level of cTn-T in rats. Notably, cardiac fibrosis and myocardiac hypertrophy appeared in the 10 mg/kg PFOS group. In addition, TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased by exposure to 10 mg/kg PFOS in rat heart tissues.

In this study, we used FTIR microspectroscopy in combination with intelligent algorithms to identify the pathological phases in human infarcted cardiac tissues, including ischemia, necrotic, granulation, and fibrotic stages. First, a comparison of infrared spectra corresponding to infarcted tissue pathological categories revealed various spectral properties. The results of unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear distinction between these four pathological stages and the normal stage. Then, to identify these five stages, an automatic artificial neural network (ANN) classifier was effectively created.

Cardiac tissue was analyzed for adrenergic/cholinergic receptor expression, inflammation, and histopathology. Four ALM animals and one Saline control survived to 72 h. Mortality was associated with up to 97% decreases in adrenergic (\u03b2-1, \u03b1-1A) and cholinergic (M2) receptor expression, cardiac inflammation, myocyte Ca2+ loading, and histopathology, indicating heart ischemia/failure.

Paradoxically, Saline cardiac adiponectin hormone levels were higher than ALM, with no change in receptor expression, indicating intra-cardiac synthesis.

When one or more \"cardiomyocyte aggregates\" are delimited by two cleavage planes, this defines a \"sheetlet\" that can be considered as a \"work unit\" that contributes to the thickening of the wall during the cardiac cycle. In this paper, we introduce the skeleton method to measure the local three-dimensional (3D) orientation of cardiomyocyte aggregates in the sheetlets in three steps: data segmentation; extraction of the skeleton of the sheetlets; and calculation of the local orientation of the cardiomyocyte aggregates inside the sheetlets.

This study focused on the role of CCR5 in myocardial injury in rats with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the mechanism of action.\nA rat model of DCM was induced by streptozotocin (STZ). CCR5 was knocked down in rats to determine its role in myocardial injury and immune cell infiltration. The upstream regulators of CCR5 were bioinformatically predicted and the binding between nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2) and CCR5 was validated. The portion of M1 and M2 macrophages in tissues was determined by flow cytometry or double-labeling immunofluorescence. Rat bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were treated with granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF/M-CSF) and co-cultured with H9C2 cells for in vitro experiments.\nSTZ-treated rats had impaired cardiac function and increased levels of creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin I and lactate dehydrogenase. CCR5 inhibition significantly alleviated myocardial injury in rats and reduced the portion of M1 macrophages in rat cardiac tissues. NR4A2, which could suppress CCR5 transcription, was poorly expressed in rats with DCM. NR4A2 overexpression played a similar myocardium-protective role in rats. In vitro, overexpression of NR4A2 induced M2 polarization of macrophages, which protected the co-cultured H9C2 cells from high glucose-induced damage, but the protective role was blocked after CCR5 overexpression.\nThis study demonstrated that NR4A2 suppresses CCR5 expression and promotes M2 polarization of macrophages to alleviate cardiomyocyte loss and myocardial injury.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2021-11-15", "authors": ["HuangtaiMiao", "XiaoyingLi", "CanZhou", "YingLiang", "DeshunLi", "QingweiJi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2021.104279"}

Here, we demonstrate the cardioprotective potential of a composite inserting human amniotic stromal mesenchymal stem cells (ASMCs) in a chitosan and hyaluronic acid (C/HA) based hydrogel in a rat MI model. Mechanical characterization of the C/HA platform indicated a swift elastic conversion at 40\u00b0C and a rapid sol-gel transition time at 37\u00b0C. Cell viability assay presented active and proliferating AMSCs in the C/HA. The ASMCs\u00a0+\u00a0C/HA injected composite significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and neovessel formation. The encapsulated AMSCs were abundantly detected in the infarcted myocardium 6\u00a0weeks post-administration and co-expressed cardiac proteins and notably proliferative markers. Proteomic profiling revealed that extracellular vesicles released from hypoxia preconditioned ASMCs contained proteins involved in cytoprotection, angiogenesis, cardiac differentiation and non-canonical Wnt-signaling. Independent activation of non-canonical Wnt-signaling pathways in ASMCs induced cardiogenesis. Despite a low injected cellular density at baseline, the encapsulated AMSCs were abundantly retained and increased cardiac function. Furthermore, the C/HA hydrogel provided an active milieu for the AMSCs to proliferate, co-express cardiac proteins, and induce new vessel formation. Hence, this novel composite of AMSCs\u00a0+\u00a0C/HA scaffold is a conceivable candidate that could restore cardiac function and reduce remodeling.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2021-11-03", "authors": ["KashifKhan", "GeorgesMakhoul", "BinYu", "GhulamJalani", "IdaDerish", "Alissa KRutman", "MartaCerruti", "AdelSchwertani", "RenzoCecere"], "doi": "10.1002/term.3262"}

Although the treatment of these disorders is mainly focused on resolving their mental component, one cannot neglect the need for the treatment of accompanying somatic symptoms. Melissa officinalis L. (lemon balm), in various formulations, has been extensively used as an ethnomedicinal remedy for the treatment of different psyche-related symptoms, and its use is considered relatively safe.\nIn the present study, the activity of M. officinalis (MO) essential oil was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo models mimicking or involving anxiety-related somatic symptoms.\nTo address the effect of MO essential oil on the gastrointestinal and heart-related symptoms accompanying anxiety disorders, in vitro models were utilized that follow the function of the isolated mouse ileum and atria tissues, respectively, after exposure to MO essential oil. Effects of MO essential oil on BALB/c mice motor activity was estimated using the open field, rota-rod, and horizontal wire tests. Additionally, the essential oil was assayed for its potential in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity.\nThe performance of mice treated with 25\u00a0mg/kg of the oil showed a statistically significant decrease in the motor impairment arising from acute anxiety (open field test), while there was a prolonged latency and a reduction of the frequency of falling from a rotating rod and/or a horizontal wire (signs of muscle weakness/spasms). Concentrations of the essential oil higher than 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL were found to inhibit both spontaneous and induced ileum contractions. Moreover, the essential oil and citronellal were found to decrease isolated mouse atria contraction frequency, as well as contraction force. However, the oil was found to be a very weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.\nThe modulation of anxiety-related symptoms by the oil was found not to be mediated through the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase, nonetheless, the mechanistic studies involving the ileum and cardiac tissues, revealed that the activity of MO and citronellal might be related to the modification of either voltage-gated Ca", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2021-11-01", "authors": ["Nikola MStojanovi\u0107", "Marko ZMladenovi\u0107", "AleksandraMaslovari\u0107", "Nenad IStojiljkovi\u0107", "Pavle JRandjelovi\u0107", "Niko SRadulovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2021.114788"}

Therefore, twenty-seven infants for surgical closure of ventricular septal defect were randomly assigned to a CP solution: normothermic blood (BCP), delNido (dNCP), and Custodiol (CCP). Hsp levels and apoptosis were determined by immunoblotting in cardiac tissue from the right atrium before and after CP, and their correlations with cardiac parameters were evaluated.

Decreased Hsp60 and increased Hsp70 expression were detected in dNCP-group. Importantly, apoptosis was not observed in dNCP- and CCP-groups, whereas marked increases in cleaved caspase-3 and -8 were determined after BCP.

{"title": "Hydrogen sulfide plays a potential alternative for the treatment of metabolic disorders of diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a cardiovascular complication that tends to occur in patients with diabetes, obesity, or insulin resistance, with a higher late mortality rate.

Although many studies are done using these fish to determine concentrations of stressors like legacy persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals, there are currently no proteomic studies on the biological effects these stressors have on the ecosystem. This lack of proteomic studies on Great Lakes lake trout is because there is currently no complete, comprehensive protein database for this species. Here, we employed proteomics approaches to develop a lake trout protein database that could aid in future research on this fish, in particular exposomics and adductomics. The current study utilized heart tissue and blood from two lake trout. Our previous work using lake trout liver revealed 4194 potential protein hits in the NCBI databases and 3811 potential protein hits in the UniProtKB databases. In the current study, using the NCBI databases we identified 838 proteins for the heart and 580 proteins for the blood tissues in the biological replicate 1 (BR1) and 1180 potential protein hits for the heart and 561 potential protein hits for the blood in BR2. Similar results were obtained using the UniProtKB databases.

In this study, we used adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-based cardiac gene delivery to test the effects of CNTF overexpression on adverse ventricular remodeling in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice models. Postnatal (P3-P10) mice were peritoneally injected with AAV9 recombinant virus carrying the CNTF gene or EGFP gene. Then, type 1 diabetic models were established by peritoneal injection of streptozotocin (200\u00a0mg/kg) in 7-week-old female mice injected with AAV9. 4\u00a0weeks later after the establishment of type 1 diabetes mellitus, mouse hearts were removed to assess the degree of cardiac remodeling.

Clinical data from the Mount Sinai Health System show that substantial numbers of COVID-19 patients without prior heart disease develop cardiac dysfunction. How COVID-19 patients develop cardiac disease is not known. We integrated cell biological and physiological analyses of human cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the presence of interleukins (ILs) with clinical findings related to laboratory values in COVID-19 patients to identify plausible mechanisms of cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients. We infected hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from healthy human subjects with SARS-CoV-2 in the absence and presence of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Infection resulted in increased numbers of multinucleated cells. Interleukin treatment and infection resulted in disorganization of myofibrils, extracellular release of troponin I, and reduced and erratic beating. Infection resulted in decreased expression of mRNA encoding key proteins of the cardiomyocyte contractile apparatus. Although interleukins did not increase the extent of infection, they increased the contractile dysfunction associated with viral infection of cardiomyocytes, resulting in cessation of beating. Clinical data from hospitalized patients from the Mount Sinai Health System show that a significant portion of COVID-19 patients without history of heart disease have elevated troponin and interleukin levels. A substantial subset of these patients showed reduced left ventricular function by echocardiography. Our laboratory observations, combined with the clinical data, indicate that direct effects on cardiomyocytes by interleukins and SARS-CoV-2 infection might underlie heart disease in COVID-19 patients.

{"title": "Polysaccharide-Protein Multilayers Based on Chitosan-Fibrinogen Assemblies for Cardiac Cell Engineering.", "abstract": "The cell and tissue culture substrates play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. The surface properties of the materials control a wide variety of cell functions. Amongst various methods, layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a versatile surface coating technique for creating controllable bio-coatings. Here, polysaccharide/protein multilayers are proposed, which are fabricated by immersive LbL assembly and based on the chitosan/fibrinogen pair for improving the adhesion and spreading of cardiomyocytes. Two approaches in LbL assembly are employed for clarifying the effect of the bilayers order and their concentration on cardiomyocytes viability and morphology. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements show that the adsorption of the biopolymers is enhanced during the LbL deposition in a synergistic manner. Contact angle measurements indicate that the multilayers are alternating from less to more hydrophilic behavior depending on the biopolymer that is added last. Confocal microscopy with immunostained fibrinogen reveals that the amount of the protein is higher when the concentration of the immersion solution is increased, however, for low solution concentration it is speculated that interdigitation between the separate biopolymer layers takes place.

{"title": "Cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with pro-inflammatory transcriptomic alterations within the heart.", "abstract": "Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is associated with adverse outcome. However, it is unclear whether cell-specific consequences are associated with cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated heart tissue utilizing in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and RNA-sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19.\nIn this study, 95 SARS-CoV-2-positive autopsy cases were included. A relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load in the cardiac tissue was detected in 41/95 deceased (43%). Massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE)-RNA-sequencing was performed to identify molecular pathomechanisms caused by the infection of the heart. A signature matrix was generated based on the single-cell dataset 'Heart Cell Atlas' and used for digital cytometry on the MACE-RNA-sequencing data. Thus, immune cell fractions were estimated and revealed no difference in immune cell numbers in cases with and without cardiac infection. This result was confirmed by quantitative immunohistological diagnosis. MACE-RNA-sequencing revealed 19 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a q-value <0.05 (e.g. up: IFI44L, IFT3, TRIM25; down: NPPB, MB, MYPN). The upregulated DEGs were linked to interferon pathways and originate predominantly from endothelial cells. In contrast, the downregulated DEGs originate predominately from cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescent staining showed viral protein in cells positive for the endothelial marker ICAM1 but rarely in cardiomyocytes. The Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis revealed that downregulated GO terms were linked to cardiomyocyte structure, whereas upregulated GO terms were linked to anti-virus immune response.\nThis study reveals that cardiac infection induced transcriptomic alterations mainly linked to immune response and destruction of cardiomyocytes. While endothelial cells are primarily targeted by the virus, we suggest cardiomyocyte destruction by paracrine effects. Increased pro-inflammatory gene expression was detected in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiac tissue but no increased SARS-CoV-2 associated immune cell infiltration was observed.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2021-10-15", "authors": ["HannaBr\u00e4uninger", "BastianStoffers", "Antonia D EFitzek", "KiraMei\u00dfner", "GannaAleshcheva", "MichaelaSchweizer", "JessicaWeimann", "Bj\u00f6rnRotter", "SvenjaWarnke", "CarolinEdler", "FabianBraun", "KevinRoedl", "KatharinaScherschel", "FelicitasEscher", "StefanKluge", "Tobias BHuber", "BenjaminOndruschka", "Heinz-PeterSchultheiss", "PaulusKirchhof", "StefanBlankenberg", "KlausP\u00fcschel", "DirkWestermann", "DianaLindner"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvab322"}

However, evidence about the effects of co-exposure to As and F on myocardium and their mechanisms remain scarce. Our aim was to fill the gap by establishing rat and H9c2 cell exposure models. We determined the effects of As and/or F exposure on the survival rate, apoptosis rate, morphology and ultrastructure of H9c2 cells; in addition, we tested the related genes and proteins of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and apoptosis in H9c2 cells and rat heart tissues. The results showed that As and/or F exposure induced early apoptosis of H9c2 cells and caused endoplasmic reticulum expansion. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of GRP78, PERK and CHOP in H9c2 cells were higher in the exposure groups than in the control group, and could be inhibited by 4-PBA. Furthermore, we found that As and/or F exposure increased the expression level of GRP78 in rat heart tissues, but interestingly, the expression level of CHOP protein was increased in the F and As groups, while significantly decreased in the co-exposure group. Overall, our results suggested that ERS-induced apoptosis was involved in the damage of myocardium by As and/or F exposure.

Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce exhibits antioxidant activity and can effectively manage tremors. Therefore, the present research assessed the preventive effect of Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce ethanolic extract (PCDE) against paraquat-induced toxicity in prepubertal mice. The plant extract was chemically characterized by a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The PCDE was orally administered to prepubertal mice for continuous 21 days, 2 h before paraquat exposure (2 mg/kg for consecutive 3 days per week for 3 weeks). The changes in behavior, motor coordination, memory, muscle movement, anxiety, and neurotransmitter levels in the brain were assessed. Histopathology and estimation of oxidative stress parameters in the brain, liver, kidney, and heart tissues were also carried out. HPLC-DAD analysis showed a high amount of quercetin, kaempferol, and ellagic acid derivatives in the plant extract. The PCDE showed improved muscle coordination, muscle movement and memory, and reduced anxiety in prepubertal mice. Moreover, levels of dopamine and noradrenaline were increased in the brain. It successfully ameliorated the oxidative stress in different organs by increasing the level of glutathione and superoxide dismutase and by reducing malondialdehyde. The histopathological assessment showed the plant extract effectively mitigated paraquat-induced pathological lesions in the neurons, neuroglia, hepatocytes, and kidney tissues. It is concluded from the present study that the treatment with PCDE had prevented the paraquat-induced toxicity in the brain, liver, kidney, and heart through the reduction of oxidative stress possibly due to the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids.", "journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "date": "2021-10-11", "authors": ["Muhammad FurqanAkhtar", "Muhammad OmerMehal", "AmmaraSaleem", "AhmadEl Askary", "Mohamed MAbdel-Daim", "FareehaAnwar", "MuhammadAyaz", "AlamZeb"], "doi": "10.1007/s11356-021-16788-w\n10.1016/j.etap.2016.10.008\n10.1007/s10787-020-00783-7\n10.1155/2015/542542\n10.1007/s12035-018-1148-z\n10.3109/13880209.2012.666253\n10.3109/10715762.2014.899694\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.06.034\n10.1016/j.taap.2012.03.013\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.11.030\n10.1590/S1984-82502012000300025\n10.1007/s12017-016-8435-5\n10.1007/s00330-016-4419-y\n10.3389/fmicb.2019.01754\n10.7897/2230-8407.1007208\n10.1155/2012/735653\n10.4314/tjpr.v15i4.14\n10.5530/pc.2019.1.5\n10.3233/JPD-150685\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2013.06.002\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.01621.x\n10.3389/fnins.2014.00187\n10.1155/2019/9613090\n10.3109/10799893.2012.672994\n10.1007/s00210-020-01931-0\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.071\n10.1002/mds.24996\n10.3389/fphar.2014.00151\n10.1080/02772248.2018.1460369\n10.3329/bjp.v8i4.16684\n10.1016/j.fitote.2018.10.026\n10.4103/0975-7406.124317\n10.1016/j.fct.2015.01.018\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.073\n10.1155/2012/624925\n10.1039/C5AY01402F\n10.1177/1759091418777438\n10.1111/jfbc.13199"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective Effects of Oroxylum indicum Extract Against Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-Induced Cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Administration of Chemotherapeutics, especially doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide (CPS), is commonly associated with adverse effects such as myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. At this time, few approved therapeutic options are currently available for the management of chemotherapy-associated cardiotoxicity. Thus, identification of novel therapeutics with potent cardioprotective properties and minimal adverse effects are pertinent in treating Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity. Oroxylum indicum extract (OIE, Sabroxy\u00ae) is a natural product known to possess several beneficial biological functions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. We therefore set to investigate the cardioprotective effects of OIE against Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity and explore the potential cardioprotective mechanisms involved. Adult male mice were treated with DOX and CPS in combination, OIE alone, or a combination of OIE and DOX & CPS. Swimming test was performed to assess cardiac function. Markers of oxidative stress were assessed by levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrite, hydrogen peroxide, catalase, and glutathione content. The activity of interleukin converting enzyme and cyclooxygenase was determined as markers of inflammation. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring Complex-I activity. Apoptosis was assessed by Caspase-3 and protease activity. Mice treated with DOX and CPS exhibited reduced swim rate, increased oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and apoptosis in the heart tissue. These cardiotoxic effects were significantly reduced by co-administration of OIE. Furthermore, computational molecular docking studies revealed potential binding of DOX and CPS to tyrosine hydroxylase which validated our in vivo findings regarding the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Our current findings indicated that OIE counteracts Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity-through inhibition of ROS-mediated apoptosis and by blocking the effect on tyrosine hydroxylase. Taken together, our findings suggested that OIE possesses cardioprotective effects to counteract potentially fatal cardiac complications associated with chemotherapy treatment.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2021-10-09", "authors": ["Satyanarayana RPondugula", "AishaHarshan", "SindhuRamesh", "ManojGovindarajulu", "MohammedAlmaghrabi", "MohammedMajrashi", "Kodye LAbbott", "RishiNadar", "MansourAlturki", "Julia MSalamat", "ForrestSmith", "MuhammedMajeed", "KalyanamNagabhushanam", "TimothyMoore", "JunRen", "MuralikrishnanDhanasekaran"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-021-09701-x\n10.1177/2324709613480346\n10.1124/mi.7.3.6\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207936\n10.3389/fnins.2015.00131\n10.3892/mmr.2017.6272\n10.1016/j.jaim.2017.06.007\n10.1080/10715762.2017.1381694\n10.1039/c8fo00466h\n10.4103/0250-474X.98981\n10.1080/14786419.2019.1650359\n10.1096/fasebj.12.10.905\n10.1097/PSY.0b013e31825ca8e5\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.02.028\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.07.052\n10.1080/15376516.2020.1760984\n10.1080/15376516.2017.1376024\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117702\n10.1002/vms3.296\n10.1016/j.lfs.2017.03.004\n10.1016/j.ab.2012.09.005\n10.1016/j.abb.2010.12.017\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.1994.63062014.x\n10.2165/00003088-200746120-00005\n10.1016/s0167-8140(02)00003-8\n10.1155/2019/1562038\n10.4103/0974-8490.110543\n10.1177/1934578X211016966\n10.1007/s00436-015-4864-6\n10.1016/j.bbi.2012.10.012\n10.1016/j.bbr.2018.12.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0217437\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.02.013\n10.1038/s41418-019-0372-z\n10.1161/01.RES.0000166925.45995.ed\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0704365\n10.1634/theoncologist.11-4-342\n10.3389/fonc.2017.00118\n10.1002/med.21476"}

Bioengineering approaches have been used to create cardiac tissues with optimized functions.

The current study aims to investigate the pharmacological effects of hirsutine, one indole alkaloid isolated from Uncaria rhynchophylla, on improving hepatic and cardiac IR, and elucidate the underlying mechanism. T2DM and IR in vivo were established by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding for 3 months in C57BL/6\u00a0J mice. In vitro IR models were induced by high-glucose and high-insulin (HGHI) incubation in HepG2 and H9c2 cells. Hirsutine administration for 8 weeks improved HFD-induced peripheral hyperglycemia, glucose tolerance and IR by OGTT and ITT assays, and simultaneously attenuated hepatic steatosis and cardiac hypertrophy by pathological observation. The impaired p-Akt expression was activated by hirsutine in liver and heart tissues of HFD mice, and also in the models in vitro. Hirsutine exhibited the effects on enhancing glucose consumption and uptake in IR cell models via activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which was blocked by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Moreover, the effect of hirsutine on promoting glucose uptake and GLUT4 expression in HGHI H9c2 cells was also prevented by Compound C, an inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Enhancement of glycolysis might be another factor of hirsutine showing its effects on glycemic control. Collectively, it was uncovered that hirsutine might exert beneficial effects on regulating glucose homeostasis, thus improving hepatic and cardiac IR, and could be a promising compound for treating diet-induced T2DM.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2021-10-02", "authors": ["WeiHu", "MengLi", "WuyiSun", "QixiuLi", "HaiyanXi", "YuanyeQiu", "RanWang", "QianDing", "ZhouWang", "YueYu", "HepingLei", "YichengMao", "Yi ZhunZhu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105917"}

Group 4 received CP as group 2 and AST as group 3. After the last dose of the treatment protocol, serum was separated to measure cardiotoxicity indices and the left ventricle was then dissected for mRNA and protein expression studies and histopathological examinations. Treatment with CP significantly increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), and troponin, while significantly decreased soluble \u03b1 Klotho protein and caused histopathological lesions in cardiac tissues. In cardiac tissues, CP significantly decreased gene expression of ALDH2, Klotho protein, mTOR, IGF, AKT, AMPK, BCL2, but significantly increased expression of BAX and caspase-8. Interestingly, administration of AST in combination with CP completely reversed all the biochemical, histopathological and gene expression changes induced by CP to the control values. The current study suggests that inhibition of ALDH2, Klotho protein, mTOR, and AMPK signals in cardiac tissues may contribute to CP-induced acute cardiomyopathy.

Unfortunately, it is also subjected to various stresses based on physiological or pathological conditions, particularly more vulnerable to damages caused by oxidative stress. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanism and contribution of IGF-IIR\u03b1 in endoplasmic reticulum stress induction in the heart under doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Using in vitro H9c2 cells, in vivo transgenic rat cardiac tissues, siRNAs against CHOP, chemical ER chaperone PBA, and western blot experiments, we found that IGF-IIR\u03b1 overexpression enhanced ER stress markers ATF4, ATF6, IRE1\u03b1, and PERK which were further aggravated by DOX treatment. This was accompanied by a significant perturbation in stress-associated MAPKs such as p38 and JNK. Interestingly, PARKIN, a stress responsive cellular protective mediator was significantly downregulated by IGF-IIR\u03b1 concomitant with decreased expression of ER chaperone GRP78. Furthermore, ER stress-associated pro-apoptotic factor CHOP was increased considerably in a dose-dependent manner followed by elevated c-caspase-12 and c-caspase-3 activities. Conversely, treatment of H9c2 cells with chemical ER chaperone PBA or siRNA against CHOP abolished the IGF-IIR\u03b1-induced ER stress responses. Altogether, these findings suggested that IGF-IIR\u03b1 contributes to ER stress induction and inhibits cellular stress coping proteins while increasing pro-apoptotic factors feeding into a cardio myocyte damage program that eventually paves the way to heart failure.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2021-09-30", "authors": ["SudhirPandey", "Chia-HuaKuo", "William Shao-TsuChen", "Yu-LanYeh", "Wei-WenKuo", "Ray-JadeChen", "Cecilia HsuanDay", "Pei-YingPai", "Tsung-JungHo", "Chih-YangHuang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-021-04261-8\n10.1111/bph.13888\n10.1038/s41598-019-47607-5\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1091141\n10.3390/biom5021099\n10.3390/biom9090503\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.10.026\n10.1038/ncb0311-184\n10.1016/j.cbi.2016.03.023\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017443\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.006\n10.1016/j.bcp.2012.10.005\n10.1016/j.pcad.2006.10.002\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.108834\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307604\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2291\n10.1161/01.res.76.4.645\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.07.016\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.036\n10.1371/journal.pone.0216285\n10.1002/jcb.28957\n10.1152/ajpcell.00079.2019\n10.1038/s41598-017-02339-2\n10.1186/s12986-019-0356-5\n10.1051/bmdcn/2018080315\n10.1186/s12986-020-0432-x\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.01.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0215992\n10.1007/s10557-016-6709-7\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109475"}

Midazolam is a benzodiazepine commonly utilized in anesthesia and intensive care. Research has indicated that midazolam plays a critical role in many diseases; however, the function of midazolam in myocardial injury induced by I/R still needs further investigation. The infarct size and damage to the heart tissues were examined through 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were tested using commercial kits. Cell apoptosis was determined through TUNEL staining or flow cytometry assays. Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, phospho-38 (p-p38), p38, p-JNK, JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and p-ERK expression was examined through Western blot. In our study, midazolam was shown to suppress the infarct size and heart tissue damage and reduce myocardial enzyme leakage in I/R rats. Additionally, midazolam was found to retard cardiomyocyte apoptosis in I/R rats. The JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway in I/R rats was inhibited by midazolam. Our findings demonstrated that in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) - mediated H9C2 cells, anisomycin abolished the suppressive effects of midazolam on the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Next, exploration discovered that anisomycin abolished the cytoprotective effects of midazolam on H/R-treated H9C2 cell apoptosis. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that midazolam retarded I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

After MI, the capability of providing sufficient blood and oxygen significantly decreases in the heart. This event leads to depletion of oxygen from cardiac tissue and consequently leads to massive cardiac cell death due to hypoxemia. Over the past few decades, many studies have been carried out to discover acceptable approaches to treat MI. However, very few have addressed the crucial role of efficient oxygen delivery to the injured heart. Thus, various strategies were developed to increase the delivery of oxygen to cardiac tissue and improve its function. Here, we have given an overall discussion of the oxygen delivery mechanisms and how the current technologies are employed to treat patients suffering from MI, including a comprehensive view on three major technical approaches such as oxygen therapy, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), and oxygen-releasing biomaterials (ORBs). Although oxygen therapy and HBOCs have shown promising results in several animal and clinical studies, they still have a few drawbacks which limit their effectiveness.

{"title": "Inhibition of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Attenuates Recurrent Seizures Associated Cardiac Damage in a Zebrafish Kindling Model of Chronic Epilepsy.", "abstract": "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is primarily linked with the cardiac irregularities that occur due to recurrent seizures. Our previous studies found a role of mTOR pathway activation in seizures-linked cardiac damage in a rat model. In continuation to the earlier work, the present study was devised to explore the role of rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor and clinically used immunosuppressive agent) in a zebrafish kindling model and associated cardiac damage. Adult zebrafish were incubated with increasing concentrations of rapamycin (1, 2 and, 4 \u03bcM), followed by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) exposure to record seizure latency and severity. In another experiment, zebrafish were subjected to a standardized PTZ kindling protocol. The kindled fish were treated daily with rapamycin for up to 25 days, along with PTZ to record seizure severity. At the end, zebrafish heart was excised for carbonylation assay, gene expression, and protein quantification studies. In the acute PTZ convulsion test, treatment with rapamycin showed a significant increase in seizure latency and decreased seizure severity without any change in seizure incidence. Treatment with rapamycin also reduced the severity of seizures in kindled fish.

{"title": "Preclinical short QT syndrome models: studying the phenotype and drug-screening.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in developed and developing countries. Inherited cardiac channelopathies are linked to 5-10% of SCDs, mainly in the young. Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a rare inherited channelopathy, which leads to both atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, syncope, and even SCD. International European Society of Cardiology guidelines include as diagnostic criteria: (i) QTc\u2009\u2264\u2009340\u2009ms on electrocardiogram, (ii) QTc\u2009\u2264\u2009360\u2009ms plus one of the follwing, an affected short QT syndrome pathogenic gene mutation, or family history of SQTS, or aborted cardiac arrest, or family history of cardiac arrest in the young. However, further evaluation of the QTc ranges seems to be required, which might be possible by assembling large short QT cohorts and considering genetic screening of the newly described pathogenic mutations. Since the mechanisms underlying the arrhythmogenesis of SQTS is unclear, optimal therapy for SQTS is still lacking. The disease is rare, unclear genotype-phenotype correlations exist in a bevy of cases and the absence of an international short QT registry limit studies on the pathophysiological mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis and therapy of SQTS. This leads to the necessity of experimental models or platforms for studying SQTS. Here, we focus on reviewing preclinical SQTS models and platforms such as animal models, heterologous expression systems, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte models and computer models as well as three-dimensional engineered heart tissues. We discuss their usefulness for SQTS studies to examine genotype-phenotype associations, uncover disease mechanisms and test drugs. These models might be helpful for providing novel insights into the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of this channelopathy and may offer opportunities to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SQT syndrome.", "journal": "Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "date": "2021-09-14", "authors": ["XuehuiFan", "GuoqiangYang", "JacquelineKowitz", "FiratDuru", "Ardan MSaguner", "IbrahimAkin", "XiaoboZhou", "IbrahimEl-Battrawy"], "doi": "10.1093/europace/euab214"}

In total, 51,755 peptides and 7215 proteins were identified.

The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that the DAPs were enriched for the retinol metabolism and toll-like receptor categories in lung tissue. The changes in these two pathways may regulate hypoxia-induced factor and immune function in yaks. Moreover, DAPs in heart tissues were enriched for cardiac muscle contraction, Huntington's disease, chemical carcinogenesis and drug metabolism-cytochrome P450.

{"title": "MCU-complex-mediated mitochondrial calcium signaling is impaired in Barth syndrome.", "abstract": "Calcium signaling via mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex coordinates mitochondrial bioenergetics with cellular energy demands. Emerging studies show that the stability and activity of the pore-forming subunit of the complex, MCU, is dependent on the mitochondrial phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), but how this impacts calcium-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics in CL-deficiency disorder like Barth syndrome (BTHS) is not known. Here we utilized multiple models of BTHS including yeast, mouse muscle cell line, as well as BTHS patient cells and cardiac tissue to show that CL is required for the abundance and stability of the MCU-complex regulatory subunit MICU1. Interestingly, the reduction in MICU1 abundance in BTHS mitochondria is independent of MCU. Unlike MCU and MICU1/MICU2, other subunit and associated factor of the uniporter complex, EMRE and MCUR1, respectively, are not affected in BTHS models. Consistent with the decrease in MICU1 levels, we show that the kinetics of MICU1-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake is perturbed and acute stimulation of mitochondrial calcium signaling in BTHS myoblasts fails to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase, which in turn impairs the generation of reducing equivalents and blunts mitochondrial bioenergetics. Taken together, our findings suggest that defects in mitochondrial calcium signaling could contribute to cardiac and skeletal muscle pathologies observed in BTHS patients.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2021-09-09", "authors": ["SagnikaGhosh", "MohammadZulkifli", "AlaumyJoshi", "ManigandanVenkatesan", "AllenCristel", "NeelanjanVishnu", "MuniswamyMadesh", "Vishal MGohil"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddab254"}

However, the protective effects of Se against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanism are rarely reported. In this study, we sought to explore whether Se protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting Nrf2-NLRP3 pathway. We found that Se treatment effectively alleviated DOX-induced myocardial dysfunctions, decreasing plasma markers associated with myocardial injury. Moreover, Se treatment significantly inhibited DOX-induced oxidative damages and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in heart tissues. Furthermore, Se treatment markedly promoted the expression of Nrf2 and prevented the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, suppression of Nrf2 abolished the cardioprotective effects of Se and diminished the inhibition of Se on NLRP3 inflammasome. Collectively, our study demonstrated that Se might protect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity via regulating Nrf2-NLRP3 pathway.

{"title": "SHP-1/STAT3 Interaction Is Related to Luteolin-Induced Myocardial Ischemia Protection.", "abstract": "Prevention and management of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a key step in coronary heart disease surgery. Luteolin is a falconoid compound that has an antioxidant effect, but its mechanism in I/R injury in vivo and in vitro is still under explored. This study attempted to reveal the role of luteolin (Lut) in I/R through mediation of the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. To establish I/R rat models, the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was ligated for 30\u00a0min and re-perfused for 1\u00a0h in Lut-pretreated or nude rats. Comparisons between infarct area, cardiac dysfunction, and myocardial cell death and inflammatory reaction were performed in I/R-induced rats. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell models were established by stimulating H9c2 cells with 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. Simultaneously, H/R-related cell death and inflammatory reactions were investigated following Lut treatment. The target protein of Lut was identified using western blotting. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were also measured in serum or Lut-pretreated cell culture medium. The results revealed that compared with the I/R group, Lut treatment could significantly decrease myocardial infarction (MI) area, increase left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and decrease cell death and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum. Decreased apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines were also observed in H/R cells after Lut treatment. Lut treatment downregulated SHP-1 expression and subsequently upregulated STAT3 phosphorylation in both I/R rat heart tissue and H9c2 cells. The findings of the current study suggest that Lut can protect the heart and reduce MI area, cell apoptosis rate, and inflammatory level in I/R models.", "journal": "Inflammation", "date": "2021-08-31", "authors": ["DonghaiLiu", "HongLuo", "ChenhuiQiao"], "doi": "10.1007/s10753-021-01530-y\n10.1152/ajpheart.00538.2005\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.03.032\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.05.033\n10.1007/s10495-006-7110-y\n10.1038/cddis.2016.201\n10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.04.006\n10.3390/ijms22031321\n10.2174/156800908786241050\n10.3390/ijms20112689\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.06.020\n10.1016/0306-3623(94)90129-5\n10.1038/nm0102-61\n10.1016/S0006-8993(03)02564-2\n10.1182/blood-2006-04-017434\n10.1016/j.canlet.2012.03.023\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.11.014\n10.1160/TH05-07-0514\n10.1016/j.lfs.2008.03.006\n10.1097/SHK.0b013e318180ff89\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00354-5\n10.1016/j.ejca.2005.08.016\n10.1186/s42269-020-00479-6\n10.1016/j.jaci.2006.02.023\n10.1007/s10753-015-0200-7\n10.1111/tri.12683\n10.1007/s00011-021-01468-9\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.04.031\n10.1007/s10495-009-0398-7\n10.1016/j.devcel.2008.07.008\n10.1039/b606246f\n10.1074/jbc.R700016200\n10.1517/13543784.2015.1020370\n10.3389/fphys.2017.01077\n10.1096/fj.05-4020fje\n10.21037/atm-20-2897\n10.1093/bbb/zbaa007\n10.1177/0300060521999550\n10.1155/2021/3625084\n10.1155/2020/4598476"}
{"title": "Electroconductive biomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is still the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The success of cell-based therapies and tissue engineering strategies for treatment of injured myocardium have been notably hindered due to the limitations associated with the selection of a proper cell source, lack of engraftment of engineered tissues and biomaterials with the host myocardium, limited vascularity, as well as immaturity of the injected cells. The first-generation approaches in cardiac tissue engineering (cTE) have mainly relied on the use of desired cells (e.g., stem cells) along with non-conductive natural or synthetic biomaterials for in vitro construction and maturation of functional cardiac tissues, followed by testing the efficacy of the engineered tissues in vivo. However, to better recapitulate the native characteristics and conductivity of the cardiac muscle, recent approaches have utilized electroconductive biomaterials or nanomaterial components within engineered cardiac tissues. This review article will cover the recent advancements in the use of electrically conductive biomaterials in cTE. The specific emphasis will be placed on the use of different types of nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles (GNPs), silicon-derived nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), as well as electroconductive polymers (ECPs) for engineering of functional and electrically conductive cardiac tissues. We will also cover the recent progress in the use of engineered electroconductive tissues for in vivo cardiac regeneration applications. We will discuss the opportunities and challenges of each approach and provide our perspectives on potential avenues for enhanced cTE.

{"title": "Bioengineering approaches to treat the failing heart: from cell biology to 3D printing.", "abstract": "Successfully engineering a functional, human, myocardial pump would represent a therapeutic alternative for the millions of patients with end-stage heart disease and provide an alternative to animal-based preclinical models. Although the field of cardiac tissue engineering has made tremendous advances, major challenges remain, which, if properly resolved, might allow the clinical implementation of engineered, functional, complex 3D structures in the future. In this Review, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art studies, challenges that have not yet been overcome and perspectives on cardiac tissue engineering. We begin with the most clinically relevant cell sources used in this field and discuss the use of topological, biophysical and metabolic stimuli to obtain mature phenotypes of cardiomyocytes, particularly in relation to organized cytoskeletal and contractile intracellular structures. We then move from the cellular level to engineering planar cardiac patches and discuss the need for proper vascularization and the main strategies for obtaining it. Finally, we provide an overview of several different approaches for the engineering of volumetric organs and organ parts - from whole-heart decellularization and recellularization to advanced 3D printing technologies.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

{"title": "Curcumin-coated gold nanoparticles attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via regulating apoptosis in a mouse model.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most widely used chemotherapy agents; however, its nonselective effect causes cardiotoxicity. Curcumin (Cur), a well known dietary polyphenol, could exert a significant cardioprotective effect, but the biological application of this substance is limited by its chemical insolubility. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we synthesised gold nanoparticles based on Cur (Cur-AuNPs). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorbance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed for the characterisation of synthesised NPs, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\u00a0were applied to detect Cur on the surface of AuNPs. Its cytotoxicity effect on H9c2 cells was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The biological efficacy of Cur-AuNPs was assessed after acute cardiotoxicity induction in BALB/c mice with DOX injection. The serum biomarkers, myocardial histological changes, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were then measured. The results revealed that the heart protection by Cur-AuNPs is more effective than Cur alone. Heart protective effect of Cur-AuNPs was evident both in the short-term (24\u00a0hours) and long-term (14\u00a0days) study. The results of Cur-AuNPs400 after 24\u00a0hours of toxicity induction displayed the reduction of the cardiac injury serum biomarkers (LDH, CK-MB, cTnI, ADT, and ALT) and apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase-3), as well as increase of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins without any sign of interfibrillar haemorrhage and intercellular spaces in the heart tissue microscopic images.

Cell-type-specific approaches are necessary for defining the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac development, homeostasis, and pathology. While single-cell RNA-seq studies are beginning to define the chamber-specific cellular composition of the heart, our views of the proteome are more limited because most proteomics studies have utilized homogenized human cardiac tissue. To promote future cell-type specific analyses of the human heart, we describe the first method for cardiomyocyte isolation from cryopreserved human cardiac tissue followed by flow cytometry for purity assessment. We also describe a facile method for preparing isolated cardiomyocytes and whole cardiac tissue homogenate for bottom-up proteomic analyses. Prior experience in dissociating cardiac tissue or proteomics is not required to execute these methods. We compare different sample preparation workflows and analysis methods to demonstrate how these can impact the depth of proteome coverage achieved.

{"title": "An Energetic Approach to Modeling Cytoskeletal Architecture in Maturing Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Through a variety of mechanisms, a healthy heart is able to regulate its structure and dynamics across multiple length scales. Disruption of these mechanisms can have a cascading effect, resulting in severe structural and/or functional changes that permeate across different length scales. Due to this hierarchical structure, there is interest in understanding how the components at the various scales coordinate and influence each other. However, much is unknown regarding how myofibril bundles are organized within a densely packed cell and the influence of the subcellular components on the architecture that is formed. To elucidate potential factors influencing cytoskeletal development, we proposed a computational model that integrated interactions at both the cellular and subcellular scale to predict the location of individual myofibril bundles that contributed to the formation of an energetically favorable cytoskeletal network. Our model was tested and validated using experimental metrics derived from analyzing single-cell cardiomyocytes. We demonstrated that our model-generated networks were capable of reproducing the variation observed in experimental cells at different length scales as a result of the stochasticity inherent in the different interactions between the various cellular components. Additionally, we showed that incorporating length-scale parameters resulted in physical constraints that directed cytoskeletal architecture toward a structurally consistent motif.

Jumonji domain containing 5 (JMJD5) is responsible for the embryonic development through removing methyl moieties from H3K36me2 histone, and has pro-proliferative effect on heart and eye development. However, the protective role of JMJD5 against oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced injury in cardiomyocytes has not been fully understood. Firstly, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat model was established by ligation of left coronary artery. OGD/R was performed in non-transfected H9C2 or H9C2 transfected with pcDNA-JMJD5 plasmid to induce cell cytotoxicity. Data from qRT-PCR and western blot showed that JMJD5 was reduced in the heart tissues of myocardial I/R rat model and OGD/R-induced H9C2. Secondly, JMJD5 over-expression attenuated OGD/R-induced decrease in cell viability and increase in lactate dehydrogenase secretion and cell apoptosis in H9C2. Mitophagy was promoted by pcDNA-mediated over-expression of JMJD5 with enhanced protein expression of LC3-I, LC3-II, Atg5, and Beclin 1.

In order to prevent this damage, a potent cardioprotective agent should be associated with DOX treatment. Corilagin is a natural polyphenol tannic acid which unveils enormous pharmacological activities predominantly as an antitumor agent. Hence, the current work is designed to study the precise mechanisms of corilagin upon administration in doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity in experimental rats. DOX treated rats showed diminished level of blood pressures and heart rate, whereas corilagin along with DOX treatment improved the status. Cardiotoxicity enzymes and biomarkers were found to be increased in the serum of DOX induced rats. Upon treatment, corilagin could reduce the cardiotoxicity enzymes and biomarkers in serum. Histopathological examination of cardiac tissue also revealed the anti-toxic effects of corilagin in contrast to DOX. Injection of DOX in rats showed inflammatory cells infiltration, necrosis and fragmented myofibrils. Corilagin treatment reverted the cardiac histology to near normal. Inflammatory mediators and P13K, Akt, and NF-\u03baB were upregulated in DOX administered rats. Corilagin repressed the levels of P13K, Akt, and NF-\u03baB in DOX induced rats.

We induced cellular senescence in H9c2 myoblasts using low-dose doxorubicin treatment. These senescent cells were then used to engineer cardiac tissue fibers, which were subjected to hemodynamic stresses associated with pressure-volume changes in the heart.

{"title": "Optical clearing in cardiac imaging: A comparative study.", "abstract": "The optical clearing of the cardiac tissue has always been a challenging goal to obtain successful three-dimensional reconstructions of entire hearts. Typically, the developed protocols are targeted at the clearing of the brain; cardiac tissue requires proper arrangements to the original protocols, which are usually tough and time-consuming to figure out. Here, we present the application of three different clearing methodologies on mouse hearts: uDISCO, CLARITY, and SHIELD. For each approach, we describe the required optimizations that we have developed to improve the outcome; in particular, we focus on comparing the features of the tissue after the application of each methodology, especially in terms of tissue preservation, transparency, and staining. We found that the uDISCO protocol induces strong fiber delamination of the cardiac tissue, thus reducing the reliability of structural analyses. The CLARITY protocol confers a high level of transparency to the heart and allows deep penetration of the fluorescent dyes; however, it requires long times for the clearing and the tissue loses its robustness. The SHIELD methodology, indeed, is very promising for tissue maintenance since it preserves its consistency and provides ideal transparency, but further approaches are needed to obtain homogeneous staining of the whole heart. Since the CLARITY procedure, despite the disadvantages in terms of tissue preservation and timings, is actually the most suitable approach to image labeled samples in depth, we optimized and performed the methodology also on human cardiac tissue from control hearts and hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2021-08-07", "authors": ["CamillaOlianti", "FrancescoGiardini", "EricaLazzeri", "IreneCostantini", "LudovicoSilvestri", "RaffaeleCoppini", "ElisabettaCerbai", "Francesco SPavone", "LeonardoSacconi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2021.07.012"}
{"title": "A deep dive into the darning effects of biomaterials in infarct myocardium: current advances and future perspectives.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) occurs due to the obstruction of coronary arteries, a major crux that restricts blood flow and thereby oxygen to the distal part of the myocardium, leading to loss of cardiomyocytes and eventually, if left untreated, leads to heart failure. MI, a potent cardiovascular disorder, requires intense therapeutic interventions and thereby presents towering challenges. Despite the concerted efforts, the treatment strategies for MI are still demanding, which has paved the way for the genesis of biomaterial applications. Biomaterials exhibit immense potentials for cardiac repair and regeneration, wherein they act as extracellular matrix replacing scaffolds or as delivery vehicles for stem cells, protein, plasmids, etc. This review concentrates on natural, synthetic, and hybrid biomaterials; their function; and interaction with the body, mechanisms of repair by which they are able to improve cardiac function in a MI milieu. We also provide focus on future perspectives that need attention. The cognizance provided by the research results certainly indicates that biomaterials could revolutionize the treatment paradigms for MI with a positive impact on clinical translation.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2021-08-04", "authors": ["ThiagarajanHemalatha", "MayilvahananAarthy", "SuryalakshmiPandurangan", "Numbi RamuduKamini", "NiraikulamAyyadurai"], "doi": "10.1007/s10741-021-10144-3\n10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30407-8\n10.1007/s10741-017-9630-7\n10.1016/j.hfc.2015.03.004\n10.1007/s11010-017-2987-z\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61590-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0173222\n10.1371/journal.pone.0175807\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2017.03.019\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16626-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.779900\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.04.018\n10.1007/s13346-019-00627-0\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.005\n10.1586/erc.12.99\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.11.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.01.016\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.017\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0132\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.083\n10.1016/j.cjca.2015.07.348\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120033\n10.1002/adma.201902900\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0105\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.10.052\n10.1038/s41467-019-12748-8\n10.1039/c9bm00186g\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.028\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0049\n10.1002/bab.49\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.08.036\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.04.040\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.02.058\n10.1038/nprot.2006.188\n10.1258/ebm.2010.010175\n10.1038/gt.2009.146\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.04.025\n10.1631/jzus.B1000302\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2007.01.071\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2010.0124\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.097\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.021\n10.3390/ma6041285\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.727420\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.010\n10.1002/jbm.a.35232\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.06.158\n10.1021/acsnano.7b00221\n10.1111/iep.12312\n10.1073/pnas.0812242106\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.097\n10.1039/C9TB01971E\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020143\n10.1080/08977194.2017.1297432\n10.7150/thno.32637\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.114.001478\n10.1016/j.ahj.2015.08.017\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv259\n10.1155/2015/821279\n10.1166/jbt.2014.1264\n10.7150/thno.22599\n10.1016/j.jss.2015.11.012\n10.1016/j.ijscr.2016.07.032\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0143\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.021\n10.3892/etm.2017.4026\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.09.013\n10.1021/acsami.8b17754\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000760\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.044\n10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00189-2\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0504\n10.1002/pmic.200900758\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.526178\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01086.x\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.05.021\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.2008.00595.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.001297\n10.1080/10717544.2018.1450910\n10.1002/jbm.b.31386\n10.1016/j.jbiosc.2014.04.001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.042\n10.7150/thno.31073\n10.1038/mt.2012.268\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.07.058\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.01.021\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.07.117\n10.1152/ajpheart.00076.2018\n10.1007/s13770-018-0134-x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.006\n10.1038/s41598-017-09217-x\n10.1007/s10529-015-1907-0\n10.1177/0883911512473230\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.03.015\n10.4161/biom.24490\n10.1371/journal.pone.0133308\n10.1002/adhm.201500861\n10.1007/s12015-018-9870-5\n10.1161/JAHA.119.013784\n10.1007/s11748-018-0969-z\n10.1007/s00380-018-1185-6\n10.1016/j.reth.2016.04.002\n10.1002/adhm.201801217\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2019.02.009\n10.1186/s13287-015-0237-4\n10.1126/sciadv.1600844\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.07.039\n10.1186/s13287-015-0101-6\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.12.015\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.06.005\n10.1038/s41598-018-25115-2\n10.1186/s13287-020-02066-y\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.08.005\n10.1016/j.healun.2016.01.012\n10.1002/adhm.201900544\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116891\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.021\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.026\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.07.012\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.05.005\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.08.031\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.04.007\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.057\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.04.040\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.098\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.005\n10.1039/c2ib20067h\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01409.x\n10.7150/thno.25504\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.04.022\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.01.006\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.03.013\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.067\n10.1007/s00380-015-0710-0\n10.3892/etm.2017.5015\n10.1007/s12265-019-09941-x\n10.1002/adhm.201900065\n10.1089/scd.2013.0578\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119726\n10.1002/term.1460\n10.1096/fj.201801768RR\n10.1093/ejcts/ezz252\n10.3390/biom10020205\n10.7150/thno.52309\n10.1179/1743280415Y.0000000012\n10.1039/c7bm00110j\n10.7150/thno.27760\n10.7150/thno.38876\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.12.016\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.022\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.012\n10.1021/acsami.5b01234\n10.1021/acsami.9b01886\n10.1111/jcmm.13097\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.12.025\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.110296\n10.1016/J.ENG.2016.01.028\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124701\n10.3389/fcell.2019.00063\n10.1016/j.reth.2021.04.002\n10.1039/d1tb00172h\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.12.006"}

{"title": "Injection-Free Delivery of MSC-Derived Extracellular Vesicles for Myocardial Infarction Therapeutics.", "abstract": "As emerging therapeutic factors, extracellular vesicles (EVs) offer significant potential for myocardial infarction (MI) treatment. Current delivery approaches for EVs involve either intra-myocardial or intravenous injection, where both have inherent limitations for downstream clinical applications such as secondary tissue injury and low delivery efficiency. Herein, an injection-free approach for delivering EVs onto the heart surface to treat MI is proposed. By spraying a mixture of EVs, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) precursors, and photoinitiators followed by visible light irradiation for 30\u00a0s, EVs are physically entrapped within the GelMA hydrogel network covering the surface of the heart, resulting in an enhanced retention rate. Moreover, EVs are gradually released from the hydrogel network through a combination of diffusion and/or enzymatic degradation of the hydrogel, and they are effectively taken up by the sprayed tissue area. More importantly, the released EVs further migrate deep into myocardium tissue, which exerts an improved therapeutic effect. In an MI-induced mice model, the group treated with EVs-laden GelMA hydrogels shows significant recovery in cardiac function after 4 weeks. The work demonstrates a new strategy for delivering EVs into cardiac tissues for MI treatment in a localized manner with high retention.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2021-07-27", "authors": ["JunnanTang", "XiaolinCui", "ZengleiZhang", "YanyanXu", "JiachengGuo", "Bram GSoliman", "YongzhengLu", "ZhenQin", "QiguangWang", "HuZhang", "Khoon SLim", "Tim B FWoodfield", "JinyingZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202100312"}
{"title": "Bcar1/p130Cas is essential for ventricular development and neural crest cell remodelling of the cardiac outflow tract.", "abstract": "The adapter protein p130Cas, encoded by the Bcar1 gene, is a key regulator of cell movement, adhesion, and cell cycle control in diverse cell types. Bcar1 constitutive knockout mice are embryonic lethal by embryonic days (E) 11.5-12.5, but the role of Bcar1 in embryonic development remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of Bcar1 specifically in cardiovascular development and defined the cellular and molecular mechanisms disrupted following targeted Bcar1 deletions.\nWe crossed Bcar1 floxed mice with Cre transgenic lines allowing for cell-specific knockout either in smooth muscle and early cardiac tissues (SM22-Cre), mature smooth muscle cells (smMHC-Cre), endothelial cells (Tie2-Cre), second heart field cells (Mef2c-Cre), or neural crest cells (NCC) (Pax3-Cre) and characterized these conditional knock outs using a combination of histological and molecular biology techniques. Conditional knockout of Bcar1 in SM22-expressing smooth muscle cells and cardiac tissues (Bcar1SM22KO) was embryonically lethal from E14.5-15.5 due to severe cardiovascular defects, including abnormal ventricular development and failure of outflow tract (OFT) septation leading to a single outflow vessel reminiscent of persistent truncus arteriosus. SM22-restricted loss of Bcar1 was associated with failure of OFT cushion cells to undergo differentiation to septal mesenchymal cells positive for SMC-specific \u03b1-actin, and disrupted expression of proteins and transcription factors involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Furthermore, knockout of Bcar1 specifically in NCC (Bcar1PAX3KO) recapitulated part of the OFT septation and aortic sac defects seen in the Bcar1SM22KO mutants, indicating a cell-specific requirement for Bcar1 in NCC essential for OFT septation.

{"title": "Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 20 aggravates angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling via the EGFR-AKT pathway.", "abstract": "Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 20 (ZBTB20) play an important role in glucose and lipid homeostasis. ZBTB20 was shown to be a crucial protein for the maintenance of cardiac contractile function. However, the role of ZBTB20 in cardiac response remodeling has not been elucidated. Thus, this study aimed to explore the role of ZBTB20 in cardiac remodeling following angiotensin II insult. Mice were subjected to angiotensin II infusion to induce a cardiac adverse remodeling model. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) 9 system was used to deliver ZBTB20 to the mouse heart. Here, we demonstrate that ZBTB20 expression is elevated in angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling and in response to cardiomyocyte insults. Furthermore, AAV9-mediated overexpression of ZBTB20 caused cardiac wall hypertrophy, chamber dilation, increased fibrosis, and reduced ejection fraction. Additionally, ZBTB20 siRNA protected cardiomyocytes from angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy. Mechanistically, ZBTB20 interferes with EGFR and Akt signaling and modulates the remodeling response. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt counteracts ZBTB20 knockdown-mediated protection of adverse cardiac remodeling. These findings illustrate the role of ZBTB20 in the transition of adverse cardiac remodeling toward heart failure and provide evidence for the molecular programs inducing adverse cardiac remodeling. KEY MESSAGES: ZBTB20 is a transcription factor from the POK family. ZBTB20 is upregulated in heart tissue treated with angiotensin II. ZBTB20 influences cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via the EGFR-Akt pathway.

Over the past two decades, our understanding of the complexities of both the independent and co-ordinated injury responses by multiple cardiac tissues during zebrafish heart regeneration has increased exponentially. Although cardiomyocyte regeneration forms the cornerstone of the reparative process in the injured zebrafish heart, recent studies have shown that this is dependent on prior neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis, which in turn require epicardial, endocardial, and inflammatory cell signalling within an extracellular milieu that is optimized for regeneration. Indeed, it is the amalgamation of multiple regenerative systems and gene regulatory patterns that drives the much-heralded success of the adult zebrafish response to cardiac injury. Increasing evidence supports the emerging paradigm that developmental transcriptional programmes are re-activated during adult tissue regeneration, including in the heart, and the zebrafish represents an optimal model organism to explore this concept.

{"title": "Pharmacological inhibition of adipose tissue adipose triglyceride lipase by Atglistatin prevents catecholamine-induced myocardial damage.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is characterized by an overactivation of \u03b2-adrenergic signalling that directly contributes to impairment of myocardial function. Moreover, \u03b2-adrenergic overactivation induces adipose tissue lipolysis, which may further worsen the development of HF. Recently, we demonstrated that adipose tissue-specific deletion of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) prevents pressure-mediated HF in mice. In this study, we investigated the cardioprotective effects of a new pharmacological inhibitor of ATGL, Atglistatin, predominantly targeting ATGL in adipose tissue, on catecholamine-induced cardiac damage.\nMale 129/Sv mice received repeated injections of isoproterenol (ISO, 25\u2009mg/kg BW) to induce cardiac damage. Five days prior to ISO application, oral Atglistatin (2\u2009mmol/kg diet) or control treatment was started. Two and twelve days after the last ISO injection cardiac function was analysed by echocardiography. The myocardial deformation was evaluated using speckle-tracking-technique. Twelve days after the last ISO injection, echocardiographic analysis revealed a markedly impaired global longitudinal strain, which was significantly improved by the application of Atglistatin. No changes in ejection fraction were observed. Further studies included histological-, WB-, and RT-qPCR-based analysis of cardiac tissue, followed by cell culture experiments and mass spectrometry-based lipidome analysis. ISO application induced subendocardial fibrosis and a profound pro-apoptotic cardiac response, as demonstrated using an apoptosis-specific gene expression-array. Atglistatin treatment led to a dramatic reduction of these pro-fibrotic and pro-apoptotic processes. We then identified a specific set of fatty acids (FAs) liberated from adipocytes under ISO stimulation (palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and oleic acid), which induced pro-apoptotic effects in cardiomyocytes. Atglistatin significantly blocked this adipocytic FA secretion.\nThis study demonstrates cardioprotective effects of Atglistatin in a mouse model of catecholamine-induced cardiac damage/dysfunction, involving anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic actions. Notably, beneficial cardioprotective effects of Atglistatin are likely mediated by non-cardiac actions, supporting the concept that pharmacological targeting of adipose tissue may provide an effective way to treat cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2021-06-02", "authors": ["ArneThiele", "KatjaLuettges", "DanielRitter", "NiklasBeyhoff", "EliaSmeir", "JanaGrune", "Julia SSteinhoff", "MichaelSchupp", "RobertKlopfleisch", "MichaelRothe", "NicolaWilck", "HendrikBartolomaeus", "Anna KMigglautsch", "RolfBreinbauer", "Erin EKershaw", "Gernot FGrabner", "RudolfZechner", "UlrichKintscher", "AnnaForyst-Ludwig"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvab182"}
{"title": "The role of lactate in sepsis and COVID-19: Perspective from contracting skeletal muscle metabolism.", "abstract": "What is the topic of this review? Lactate is considered an important substrate for mitochondria in the muscles, heart and brain during exercise and is the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys. In this light, we review the (patho)physiology of lactate metabolism in sepsis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). What advances does it highlight? Elevated blood lactate is strongly associated with mortality in septic patients. Lactate seems unrelated to tissue hypoxia but is likely to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction and high adrenergic stimulation. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit near-normal blood lactate, indicating preserved mitochondrial function, despite a systemic hyperinflammatory state similar to sepsis.\nIn critically ill patients, elevated plasma lactate is often interpreted as a sign of organ hypoperfusion and/or tissue hypoxia. This view on lactate is likely to have been influenced by the pioneering exercise physiologists around 1920. August Krogh identified an oxygen deficit at the onset of exercise that was later related to an oxygen 'debt' and lactate accumulation by A.\u00a0V. Hill. Lactate is considered to be the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys during submaximal exercise, but hepatic elimination is attenuated by splanchnic vasoconstriction during high-intensity exercise, causing an exponential increase in blood lactate. With the development of stable isotope tracers, lactate has become established as an important energy source for muscle, brain and heart tissue, where it is used for mitochondrial respiration. Plasma lactate\u00a0>\u00a04\u00a0mM is strongly associated with mortality in septic shock, with no direct link between lactate release and tissue hypoxia. Herein, we provide evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and adrenergic stimulation as explanations for the sepsis-induced hyperlactataemia. Despite profound hypoxaemia and intense work of breathing, patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rarely exhibit hyperlactataemia\u00a0(>\u00a02.5\u00a0mM), while presenting a systemic hyperinflammatory state much like sepsis. However, lactate dehydrogenase, which controls the formation of lactate, is markedly elevated in plasma and strongly associated with mortality in severe COVID-19.

S-Nitrosylation occurred at both Cys116 and Cys163 and substitution of alanine for cysteine 116 and cysteine 163 (C116/163A) inhibited Ang II-induced myofibroblast transformation.

The heart tissue of the control group exhibited normal histology, whereas the heart tissue of the DM group exhibited vacuolization, necrosis, congestion, infiltration and myofibril loss. The DM group exhibited significantly increased apoptosis compared to the control group. Differences in anti-apoptotic effects were statistically significant for all three antioxidant treatment groups; the anti-apoptotic effects of quercetin and resveratrol were similar.

{"title": "Conductive biomaterials for cardiac repair: A review.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the fatal diseases in humans. Its incidence is constantly increasing annually all over the world. The problem is accompanied by the limited regenerative capacity of cardiomyocytes, yielding fibrous scar tissue formation. The propagation of electrical impulses in such tissue is severely hampered, negatively influencing the normal heart pumping function. Thus, reconstruction of the internal cardiac electrical connection is currently a major concern of myocardial repair. Conductive biomaterials with or without cell loading were extensively investigated to address this problem. This article introduces a detailed overview of the recent progress in conductive biomaterials and fabrication methods of conductive scaffolds for cardiac repair. After that, the advances in myocardial tissue construction in vitro by the restoration of intercellular communication and simulation of the dynamic electrophysiological environment are systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the latest trend in the study of cardiac repair in vivo using various conductive patches is summarized. Finally, we discuss the achievements and shortcomings of the existing conductive biomaterials and the properties of an ideal conductive patch for myocardial repair. We hope this review will help readers understand the importance and usefulness of conductive biomaterials in cardiac repair and inspire researchers to design and develop new conductive patches to meet the clinical requirements. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: After myocardial infarction, the infarcted myocardial area is gradually replaced by heterogeneous fibrous tissue with inferior conduction properties, resulting in arrhythmia and heart remodeling. Conductive biomaterials have been extensively adopted to solve the problem. Summarizing the relevant literature, this review presents an overview of the types and fabrication methods of conductive biomaterials, and focally discusses the recent advances in myocardial tissue construction in vitro and myocardial repair in vivo, which is rarely covered in previous reviews. As well, the deficiencies of the existing conductive patches and their construction strategies for myocardial repair are discussed as well as the improving directions. Confidently, the readers of this review would appreciate advantages and current limitations of conductive biomaterials/patches in cardiac repair.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2021-04-23", "authors": ["YimengLi", "LeqianWei", "LizhenLan", "YayaGao", "QianZhang", "HewanDawit", "JifuMao", "LameiGuo", "LiShen", "LuWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2021.04.018"}

{"title": "Inflammatory Injury and Mitophagy in the Cock Heart Induced by the Oral Administration of Hexavalent Chromium.", "abstract": "As a highly toxic heavy metal, chromium has caused a certain threat to public health and livestock breeding in recent years. In poultry, as one of our most commonly consumed meat product, its health issues will seriously threaten the safety of human life. As previous studies have confirmed, when cells are stimulated by the external environment, mitochondria, as an organelle that provides energy to the cells, can cause damage and autophagy. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether Cr(VI) can cause mitophagy in cock heart. We first randomly divided 32 cocks into four groups to explore the mechanism of this effect. The cocks were then separately exposed to four different dose levels, namely, the control level and 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg levels, via daily oral intake into the body through mixed feeding for 45 days. After 45 days, we sampled and detected pathological changes and the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), and mitophagy-related proteins (LC3, p62/SQTM1, TOMM20, and Parkin). We found that IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and LC3II contents increased with the increase in Cr(VI) concentration. However, MMP, ATPases, p62/SQTM1, and TOMM20 levels decreased with the increase in Cr(VI) concentration. At the same time, Cr(VI) exposure caused heart tissue damages and Parkin translocation. In conclusion, our results proved that inflammatory damage, mitochondrial function damage, and mitophagy in cock heart tissues were dependent on Cr(VI) concentration.", "journal": "Biological trace element research", "date": "2021-04-15", "authors": ["YueWang", "LumeiWang", "XiaozhouWang", "GuodongCheng", "YuxiaoXing", "MeihuaZhang", "PuZhang", "JianzhuLiu"], "doi": "10.1007/s12011-021-02715-0\n10.1016/j.taap.2008.11.018\n10.1016/j.cbpc.2017.10.004\n10.1007/s12011-016-0901-2\n10.1007/s12011-018-1571-z\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.120\n10.1093/toxsci/kfq263\n10.1016/j.cotox.2019.05.003\n10.1002/jbt.21697\n10.1007/s12011-015-0283-x\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110901\n10.1007/s12011-016-0915-9\n10.1002/jcp.27527\n10.1007/978-94-007-2888-2_6\n10.1007/s11356-020-09062-y\n10.1016/j.abb.2007.03.034\n10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2019.110698\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.09.009\n10.1007/s12011-019-01795-3\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.07.032\n10.1007/s11356-019-06253-0\n10.1080/10590501.2015.1096883\n10.1016/j.yrtph.2015.09.007\n10.1016/j.tcb.2016.05.008\n10.1007/s10661-019-7528-7\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.01.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0168688\n10.1038/s41594-018-0088-7\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129005\n10.1016/j.febslet.2007.01.096\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.01.143\n10.1007/s11356-020-08544-3\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110414\n10.1080/15548627.2019.1643185\n10.7888/juoeh.40.157\n10.1016/j.fsi.2017.10.047\n10.1042/BCJ20200262\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.04.084"}
{"title": "Anisotropic conductive reduced graphene oxide/silk matrices promote post-infarction myocardial function by restoring electrical integrity.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the leading cause of death globally, often leading to impaired cardiac function and pathological myocardial microenvironment. Electrical conduction abnormalities of the infarcted myocardium not only induce adverse myocardial remodeling but also prevent tissue repair. Restoring the myocardial electrical integrity, particularly the anisotropic electrical signal propagation within the injured area after infarction is crucial for an effective function recovery. Herein, optimized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) functionalized electrospun silk fibroin (rGO/silk) biomaterials presenting anisotropic conductivity and enhanced suturablity were developed and investigated as cardiac patches for their potential in improving the post-MI myocardial function of rat models. The results show that the anisotropic conductive rGO/silk patches exhibit remarkable therapeutic effect on repairing the infarcted myocardium compared to the nonconductive silk and isotropic conductive rGO/silk patches as determined by the enhanced pumping function, reduced susceptibility to arrhythmias, thickened left ventricular walls and improved survival of functional cardiomyocytes. Their notable effect on promoting the angiogenesis of capillaries in the infarcted myocardium has also been demonstrated. This study highlights an effective and biomimetic reconstruction of the electrical myocardial microenvironment based on the anisotropic conductive rGO/silk biomaterials as a promising option for promoting the repair of infarcted myocardium. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The dysfunctional electrical microenvironment in the infarcted myocardium not only aggravates the adverse myocardial remodeling but also limits the effect of cardiac regenerative medicine. Although various conductive biomaterials have been employed to restore the electrical network in the infarcted myocardium in vivo, the anisotropic nature of the myocardial electrical microenvironment which enables directional electrical signal propagation were neglected. In this study, an anisotropic conductive rGO/silk biomaterial system is developed to improve the myocardial function post infarction by restoring the anisotropic electrical microenvironment in the infarcted myocardium.

{"title": "Nanostructured lipid carriers of isradipine for effective management of hypertension and isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "The objective of the present paper is to formulate nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) of a calcium channel blocker, isradipine, to enhance its oral bioavailability and prolong its antihypertensive effect apart from evaluating efficacy of the formulation in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats. Formulation was optimized using quality by design (QbD)-based approach. Three factors i.e., total lipid concentration (%), homogenization pressure (bar), and number of cycles were optimized through Box-Behnken design to estimate their effect on critical quality attributes (CQAs) viz., size (nm), % entrapment efficiency, and in vitro % drug release which were found to be 80.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7\u00a0nm, 83.51\u2009\u00b1\u20092.15%, and 83.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.86% after 24\u00a0h, respectively. In vivo pharmacokinetic study indicated 4.207 and 1.907 times increase in the oral bioavailability of optimized nanostructured lipid carrier without and with cycloheximide (lymphatic transport inhibitor), respectively. Treatment with ISO (isoproterenol) significantly diverges the levels of antioxidant marker, TBARS (thiobarbituric acid), and ultrastructure of the cardiac tissue indicating significant myocardial damage. Pretreatment of nanostructured lipid carrier of isradipine (ISD-NLCs) significantly prevented the antioxidant status and ultrastructural changes in the heart.

{"title": "Remodelling of adult cardiac tissue subjected to physiological and pathological mechanical load in vitro.", "abstract": "Cardiac remodelling is the process by which the heart adapts to its environment. Mechanical load is a major driver of remodelling. Cardiac tissue culture has been frequently employed for in vitro studies of load-induced remodelling; however, current in vitro protocols (e.g. cyclic stretch, isometric load, and auxotonic load) are oversimplified and do not accurately capture the dynamic sequence of mechanical conformational changes experienced by the heart in vivo. This limits translational scope and relevance of findings.\nWe developed a novel methodology to study chronic load in vitro. We first developed a bioreactor that can recreate the electromechanical events of in vivo pressure-volume loops as in vitro force-length loops. We then used the bioreactor to culture rat living myocardial slices (LMS) for 3\u2009days. The bioreactor operated based on a 3-Element Windkessel circulatory model enabling tissue mechanical loading based on physiologically relevant parameters of afterload and preload. LMS were continuously stretched/relaxed during culture simulating conditions of physiological load (normal preload and afterload), pressure-overload (normal preload and high afterload), or volume-overload (high preload & normal afterload). At the end of culture, functional, structural, and molecular assays were performed to determine load-induced remodelling. Both pressure- and volume-overloaded LMS showed significantly decreased contractility that was more pronounced in the latter compared with physiological load (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Overloaded groups also showed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; RNAseq identified shared and unique genes expressed in each overload group. The PI3K-Akt pathway was dysregulated in volume-overload while inflammatory pathways were mostly associated with remodelling in pressure-overloaded LMS.\nWe have developed a proof-of-concept platform and methodology to recreate remodelling under pathophysiological load in vitro.

Given the limited endogenous regenerative capabilities of cardiac tissue, patient-specific anatomy, challenges in treatment options, and shortage of donor tissues for transplantation, there is an urgent need for novel approaches in cardiac tissue repair. 3D bioprinting is a technology based on additive manufacturing which allows for the design of precisely controlled and spatially organized structures, which could possibly lead to solutions in cardiac tissue repair. In this review, we describe the basic morphological and physiological specifics of the heart and cardiac tissues and introduce the readers to the fundamental principles underlying 3D printing technology and some of the materials/approaches which have been used to date for cardiac repair. By summarizing recent progress in 3D printing of cardiac tissue and valves with respect to the key features of cardiovascular tissue (such as contractility, conductivity, and vascularization), we highlight how 3D printing can facilitate surgical planning and provide custom-fit implants and properties that match those from the native heart. Finally, we also discuss the suitability of this technology in the design and fabrication of custom-made devices intended for the maturation of the cardiac tissue, a process that has been shown to increase the viability of implants.

Tissue engineering has shown promise in providing new solutions for pediatric CHD patients through the development of tissue engineered vascular grafts, heart patches, and heart valves. In this review, we examine the current surgical treatments for congenital heart disease and the research being conducted to create tissue engineered products for these patients. While much research remains to be done before tissue engineering becomes a mainstay of clinical treatment for CHD patients, developments have been progressing rapidly towards translation of tissue engineering devices to the clinic.", "journal": "Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine", "date": "2021-03-07", "authors": ["Kevin MBlum", "Gabriel J MMirhaidari", "Christopher KBreuer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.siny.2021.101225"}
{"title": "Non-dermal applications of microneedle drug delivery systems.", "abstract": "Microneedles (MNs) are micron-scaled needles measuring 100 to 1000\u00a0\u03bcm that were initially explored for delivery of therapeutic agents across the skin. Considering the success in transcutaneous drug delivery, the application of microneedles has been extended to different tissues and organs. The review captures the application of microneedles to the oral mucosa, the eye, vagina, gastric mucosa, nail, scalp, and vascular tissues for delivery of vaccines, biologics, drugs, and diagnostic agents. The technology has created easy access to the poorly accessible segments of eye to facilitate delivery of monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic agents in management of neovascular disease. Microporation has been reported to drastically improve the drug delivery through the poorly permeable nail plate. Curved microneedles and spatially designed microneedle cuffs have been found to be capable of delivering stem cells and therapeutic macromolecules directly to the cardiac tissue and the vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively. Besides being minimally invasive and patient compliant, the technology has the potential to offer viable solutions to deliver drugs through impermeable barriers owing to the ability to penetrate several biological barriers. The technology has been successful to overcome the delivery hurdles and enable direct delivery of drug to the target sites, thus maximizing the efficacy thereby reducing the required dose. This review is an attempt to capture the non-dermatological applications of microneedles being explored and provides an insight on the future trends in the field of microneedle technology.

Cardiac fibrosis is one of the most often pathological changes of heart tissues. It occurs as a result of extracellular matrix proteins accumulation at myocardia. Cardiac fibrosis results in impaired cardiac systolic and diastolic functions and is associated with other effects. Therapies with medicines have not been sufficiently successful in treating chronic diseases such as CVD. Therefore, the interest for therapeutic potential of natural compounds and medicinal plants has increased. Plants such as grapes, berries and peanuts contain a polyphenolic compound called \"resveratrol\" which has been reported to have various therapeutic properties for a variety of diseases. Studies on laboratory models show that resveratrol has beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, high blood pressure cardiomyopathy, thrombosis, cardiac fibrosis, and atherosclerosis. In vitro animal models using resveratrol indicated protective effects on the heart by neutralizing reactive oxygen species, preventing inflammation, increasing neoangiogenesis, dilating blood vessels, suppressing apoptosis and delaying atherosclerosis.

Engineered three-dimensional (3D) vascularized cardiac tissues have shown promise in rescuing cardiac function in diseased hearts and may serve as a whole organ replacement in the future. One of the major obstacles in reconstructing these thick myocardial tissues to a clinically applicable scale is the integration of functional vascular networks capable of providing oxygen and nutrients throughout whole engineered constructs. Without perfusion of oxygen and nutrient flow throughout the entire engineered tissue not only is tissue viability compromised, but also overall tissue functionality is lost. There are many supporting technologies and approaches that have been developed to create vascular networks such as 3D bioprinting, co-culturing hydrogels, and incorporation of soluble angiogenic factors. In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss some of the most current engineered vascular cardiac tissues reported in the literature and future directions in the field. Impact statement The field of cardiac tissue engineering is rapidly evolving and is now closer than ever to having engineered tissue models capable of predicting preclinical responses to therapeutics, modeling diseases, and being used as a means of rescuing cardiac function following injuries to the native myocardium.

Wistar rats were exposed to 58\u00a0000\u2009ppm crude acetylene for 10\u2009min at 12\u2009h intervals for 30\u2009days. Some exposed groups were treated with 50\u2009mg/kg rutin, quercetin, gallic acid, or tannic acid. Indices of hematological disorder, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular and hepatocellular injuries were evaluated in animals. The results showed a decrease in the levels of hematological indices in crude acetylene-exposed animals except for white blood cell count which was increased. Decreased activity/level of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and ferric reducing antioxidant power with increased lipid peroxidation was observed in animals exposed to crude acetylene. Activities of transaminases, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, and level of bilirubin were increased while the plasma albumin level was decreased. Dyslipidemia, increased activities of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-MB, and severe histopathological damage to hepatic and cardiac tissues were also observed in animals exposed to the gas. These deleterious hematological, biochemical, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in crude acetylene-toxified rats treated with the polyphenols. Tannic acid exhibited better activity than gallic acid while quercetin showed a superior activity to rutin. The results indicate that exposure to crude acetylene can lead to blood, heart, and liver-related diseases and dietary polyphenols could provide protective benefits.", "journal": "Drug and chemical toxicology", "date": "2020-12-10", "authors": ["Olayinka OAladesanmi", "Afolabi CAkinmoladun", "Sunday SJosiah", "Mary TOlaleye", "Afolabi AAkindahunsi"], "doi": "10.1080/01480545.2020.1853766"}

Many proofs show that circular RNA plays an important role in the development of AMI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of circSAMD4A in H/R-induced myocardial injury. The levels of circular SAMD4A (circSAMD4A) were detected in the heart tissues of AMI mice and H/R-induced H9C2 cells, and the circSAMD4A was suppressed in AMI mice and H/R-induced H9C2 cells to investigate its' function in AMI. The levels of circSAMD4A and miR-138-5p were detected by real-time quantitative PCR, and MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. TUNEL analysis and Annexin V-FITC were used to determine apoptosis. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was detected by Western blot. IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were detected by ELISA kits. The study found that the levels of circSAMD4A were up-regulated after H/R induction and inhibition of circSAMD4A expression would reduce the H/R-induced apoptosis and inflammation. MiR-138-5p was down-regulated in H/R-induced H9C2 cells. circSAMD4A was a targeted regulator of miR-138-5p. CircSAMD4A inhibited the expression of miR-138-5p to promote H/R-induced myocardial cell injury in vitro and vivo. In conclusion, CircSAMD4A can sponge miR-138-5p to promote H/R-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2020-11-22", "authors": ["XiaorongHu", "RuisongMa", "JianleiCao", "XianjinDu", "XinyongCai", "YongzhenFan"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.16093"}

The time \"window\" between procurement and transplantation sets the stage for myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, which constrains the maximal storage time and lowers use of donor organs. Given mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived paracrine protection, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of MSC-conditioned medium (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) when added to ex\u00a0vivo preservation solution on ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial damage in donor hearts.\nMouse donor hearts were stored at 0\u00b0C-4\u00b0C of <1-hour cold ischemia (<1hr-I), 6hr-I\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, 6hr-I\u00a0+\u00a0MSC-CM, 6hr-I\u00a0+\u00a0MSC-EVs, and 6hr-I\u00a0+\u00a0MSC-CM from MSCs treated with exosome release inhibitor. The hearts were then heterotopically implanted into recipient mice. At 24\u00a0hours postsurgery, myocardial function was evaluated. Heart tissue was collected for analysis of histology, apoptotic cell death, microRNA (miR)-199a-3p expression, and myocardial cytokine production.\nSix-hour cold ischemia significantly impaired myocardial function, increased cell death, and reduced miR-199a-3p in implanted hearts versus <1hr-I. MSC-CM or MSC-EVs in preservation solution reversed the detrimental effects of prolong cold ischemia on donor hearts. Exosome-depleted MSC-CM partially abolished MSC secretome-mediated cardioprotection in implanted hearts. MiR-199a-3p was highly enriched in MSC-EVs. MSC-CM and MSC-EVs increased cold ischemia-downregulated miR-199a-3p in donor hearts, whereas exosome-depletion neutralized this effect.\nMSC-CM and MSC-EVs confer improved myocardial preservation in donor hearts during prolonged cold static storage and MSC-EVs can be used for intercellular transport of miRNAs in heart transplantation.", "journal": "The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery", "date": "2020-09-29", "authors": ["MeijingWang", "LiangliangYan", "QianzhenLi", "YangYang", "MarkTurrentine", "KeithMarch", "I-WenWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.08.095"}

Acellular bioengineered cardiac patches have shown promise in positively altering ventricular remodeling in ischemic cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that combining an ADSC sheet approach with a bioengineered patch would enhance ADSC engraftment and positively promote cardiac function compared with either therapy alone in a rat ischemic cardiomyopathy model.\nCardiac patches were generated from poly(ester carbonate urethane) urea and porcine decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix. ADSCs constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein were established from F344 rats and transplanted as a cell sheet over the left ventricle 3\u00a0days after left anterior descending artery ligation with or without an overlying cardiac patch.

{"title": "Beyond the myocardium? SGLT2 inhibitors target peripheral components of reduced oxygen flux in the diabetic patient with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.", "abstract": "Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have highlighted the propensity of the antidiabetic agents, SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is or -flozin drugs), to exert positive clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease at risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Of interest in cardiac diabetology is the physiological status of the patient with T2DM and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a well-examined association. Underlying this pathologic tandem are the effects that long-standing hyperglycemia has on the ability of the HFpEF heart to adequately deliver oxygen. It is believed that shortcomings in oxygen diffusion or utilization and the resulting hypoxia thereafter may play a role in underlying the clinical sequelae of patients with T2DM and HFpEF, with implications in the long-term decline of extra-cardiac tissue. Oxygen consumption is one of the most critical factors in indexing heart failure disease burden, warranting a probe into the role of SGLT2i on oxygen utility in HFpEF and T2DM. We investigated the role of oxygen flux in the patient with T2DM and HFpEF extending beyond the heart with focuses on cellular metabolism, perivascular fibrosis with endothelial dysfunction, hematologic changes, and renal effects with neurohormonal considerations in the patient with HFpEF and T2DM.

Heart, liver, lung, and kidney tissues were analyzed by the histology, and stomach and duodenum were analyzed with a magnifying glass. The relative weight of organs did not present significant alterations. However, congestion of duodenum vessels was observed at the three tested doses and caused hyperemia of stomach mucosa at 1\u2009mg/kg. In the heart histology there was a reduction in the number of cardiomyocytes, accompanied by an increase in cell diameter (possible cell hypertrophy) dose-dependent.
