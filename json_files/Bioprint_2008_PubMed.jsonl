We hypothesize that introduction of laser-machined micropores into a decellularized natural scaffold will facilitate cell seeding by centrifugal casting and increase hydrogel retention, without compromising the biomechanical properties of the scaffold. Micropores with diameters of 50, 100, and 200 mum were machined at different linear densities in decellularized small intestine submucosa (SIS) planar sheets and tubular SIS scaffolds using an argon laser. The ultimate stress and ultimate strain values for SIS sheets with laser-machined micropores with diameter 50 mum and distance between holes as low as 714 mum were not significantly different from unmachined control SIS specimens. Centrifugal casting of GFP-labeled cells suspended in an in situ cross-linkable hyaluronan-based hydrogel resulted in scaffold recellularization with a high density of viable cells inside the laser-machined micropores. Perfusion tests demonstrated the retention of the cells encapsulated within the HA hydrogel in the microholes. Thus, an SIS scaffold with appropriately sized microholes can be loaded with hydrogel encapsulated cells by centrifugal casting to give a mechanically robust construct that retains the cell-seeded hydrogel, permitting rapid biofabrication of tubular tissue construct in a \"bioreactor-free\" fashion.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

In this study, the mechanical properties and microenviroment of 3D printed poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds are examined. Additionally, the proliferation and differentiation of human fetal osteoblasts are evaluated after 3 weeks of in vitro culture on the scaffolds. The results showed that the PLGA scaffolds examined had mechanical properties similar to that of trabecular bone, but was still much weaker compared to cortical bone. In addition to general porosity, the PLGA scaffolds also had micropores within macropore walls. Cultured human osteoblasts could proliferate upon seeding on the PLGA scaffolds. Alkaline phosphatase activity and osteonectin expression of the osteoblasts cultured on the PLGA scaffolds remained stable over three weeks, whilst expression of collagen type I and osteopontin decreased. The alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblasts cultured on PLGA scaffolds is comparable with that from two commercially-available scaffolds - OPLA and collagen scaffolds (Becton-Dickinson (BD) Inc., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Three-dimensional-printing processes permit the voxel-wise fabrication of scaffolds. The present study rests upon 3D-printing with nano-porous hydroxyapatite granulates. The cylindrical design refers to a hollow bone with higher density at the periphery. The millimeter-wide central channel follows the symmetry axis and connects the perpendicularly arranged micro-pores. Synchrotron radiation-based micro computed tomography has served for the non-destructive characterization of the scaffolds. The 3D data treatment is essential, since, for example, the two-dimensional distance maps overestimate the mean distances to the material by 33-50% with respect to the 3D analysis. The scaffolds contain 70% micrometer-wide pores that are interconnected. Using virtual spheres, which might be related to the cells migrating along the pores, the central channel remains accessible through the micro-pores for spheres with a diameter of up to (350+/-35)mum. Registering the tomograms with their 3D-printing matrices has yielded the almost isotropic shrinking of (27+/-2)% owing to the sintering process.

MDI was chosen due to its reactivity and wide application in synthesis of biomedical polyurethanes due to its reactivity; PCL-diol was chosen because of its biodegradability; and BES was chosen because it allowed the introduction sulfonic acid groups onto the polymer chains. We evaluated the polyurethanes' degradation rate, mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, antithrombogenecity, and ability to support fibroblast cell attachment and growth by comparing with polymers having a 2,2-(methylimino)diethanol (MIDE) chain extender. Mechanical testing demonstrated that the PU containing BES has tensile strengths of about 17 MPa and elongations up to 400%, about three times the strength and four times the elongation than the MIDE based PUs. The polymers showed decreased in vitro degradation rates, lower glass transition temperature (T(g)) and hydrophilicity possibly due to enhanced microphase separation. Preliminary cytocompatibility studies showed that all the PUs are non-toxic, but PU containing BES exhibited much lower cell attachment and proliferation than the MIDE chain extended polymers. An in vitro platelet adhesion assay showed lower platelet attachment on BES containing PU. Additionally, due to the existence of sulfonic acid groups, the BES extended PU became water soluble in basic condition and insoluble in acidic condition, a phenomenon that is reversible at pH value of 8.7, making this a pH sensitive polymer attractive for bioprinting applications. By adding acetic acid into an inkjet cartridge and printing it onto a PU solution with pH above 8.7, precision fabricated scaffolds can be obtained, suggesting that BES based PUs are promising candidates as synthetic inks used for customizable fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2008-07-08", "authors": ["ChanghongZhang", "XuejunWen", "Naren RVyavahare", "ThomasBoland"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.009"}

{"title": "A simple model of the modular structure of transcriptional regulation in yeast.", "abstract": "Resolving the general organizational principles that govern the interactions during transcriptional gene regulation has great relevance for understanding disease progression, biofabrication, and biological systems in general. The available genome-level monitoring technologies and the best understood biological work on gene regulation are together providing us with unprecedented amounts of data and universal modeling frameworks in which to reason about regulatory systems on a computational level. Gene regulatory systems exhibit modularity in their regulatory sequences as well as in the corresponding gene expression. This modularity has a nontrivial, general combinatorial structure that can be studied and generalized to model classes of regulatory systems. Here, we study computationally the combinatorial nature of transcriptional regulation by assuming a one-to-one relationship between shared patterns in genome-wide gene-expression and cis-region modules. In our combinatorial framework, the DNA binding events are complementary to their expression counterparts, and together let us approximate the underlying regulation structure. Our model maps regulatory systems onto hierarchical structures which can be approximated by conflating existing large scale gene expression and ChIP-chip data. We have developed methods for building regulatory hierarchies and identifying the basic functional units, or modules, of transcriptional regulation. We validate our model using yeast data by showing agreement of our predictions with experimental data, and using the hierarchies to resolve a finer structure of co-regulation.", "journal": "Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology", "date": "2008-05-10", "authors": ["VladimirFilkov", "NameetaShah"], "doi": "10.1089/cmb.2008.0020"}
