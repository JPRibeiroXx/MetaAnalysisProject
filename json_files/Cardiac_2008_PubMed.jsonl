{"title": "Molecular cardiology in translation: gene, cell and chemical-based experimental therapeutics for the failing heart.", "abstract": "Acquired and inherited diseases of the heart represent a major health care issue in this country and throughout the World. Clinical medicine has made important advancements in the past quarter century to enable several effective treatment regimes for cardiac patients. Nevertheless, it is apparent that even with the best care, current treatment strategies and therapeutics are inadequate for treating heart disease, leaving it arguably the most pressing health issue today. In this context it is important to seek new approaches to redress the functional deficits in failing myocardium. This review focuses on several recent gene, cell and chemical-based experimental therapeutics currently being developed in the laboratory for potential translation to patient care. For example, new advances in bio-sensing inducible gene expression systems offer the potential for designer cardio-protective proteins to be expressed only during hypoxia/ischemia in the heart. Stem cells continue to offer the promise of cardiac repair, and some recent advances are discussed here. In addition, discovery and applications of synthetic polymers are presented as a chemical-based strategy for acute and chronic treatment of diseased and failing cardiac tissue. Collectively, these approaches serve as the front lines in basic biomedical research, with an eye toward translation of these findings to clinically meaningful applications in cardiac disease.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular translational research", "date": "2009-12-04", "authors": ["ImmanuelTurner", "FikruBelema-Bedada", "JoshuaMartindale", "DewayneTownsend", "WangWang", "NathanPalpant", "So-ChiroYasuda", "MatthewBarnabei", "EkaterinaFomicheva", "Joseph MMetzger"], "doi": "10.1007/s12265-008-9065-6"}

It has been suggested that alterations in glucose metabolism and glucose flux via the aldose reductase pathway make the diabetic heart more sensitive to ischemic-reperfusion injury. Previous studies have found sulindac to have inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects on aldose reductase. The use of aldose reductase inhibitors for the protection of ischemic myocardium is still in an exploratory state.\nTo evaluate the therapeutic potential of sulindac in an in vivo rat model of acute ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (4 h) in diabetic and nondiabetic rats.\nDiabetes was induced in rats by administering streptozotocin (45 mg/kg, intravenously). Myocardial infarction was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Infarct size was measured using the staining agent 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored at various intervals throughout the experiment. Sorbitol dehydrogenase levels in heart tissue, as well as lipid peroxide levels in serum and heart tissue, were estimated spectrophotometrically.\nInfarct size was increased in diabetic rats in comparison with normal rats. Pretreatment with sulindac significantly reduced infarct size, lipid peroxidation and sorbitol dehydrogenase levels in both diabetic and nondiabetic rats. The degree of cardioprotection was greater in diabetic rats than in nondiabetic rats.\nThe present study indicates that the observed cardioprotection provided by sulindac in terms of reducing infarct size in normal rats may be due to its combined antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

The ICA separated cardiac structures were used to calculate the myocardial perfusion in two different cases: 1) the regions of interest were drawn manually on the ICA separated component images and 2) the volumes of interest (VOI) were automatically segmented from the component images. For the whole myocardium, the perfusion values of 25 rest and six drug-induced stress studies obtained with these methods were compared to the values from the manually drawn regions of interest on differential images. The separation of the rest and stress studies using ICA-based methods was successful in all cases.

We have demonstrated over several years the release of the neuroactive peptides, vasopressin and oxytocin and the role for Ca(2+), in the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system (HNS) of the rat and also in cardiac tissues (from the brain to the heart).

Furthermore, the intact HNS would affords the unique opportunity of comparing the somata and terminals of the same CNS neurones. This article plans to build on the this wealth of information already gathered on isolated, individual terminals/somata in order to analysis of the physiology of the whole, intact system in situ. We show some of the well established data to explain: i) why are different patterns of electrical activity (i.e. bursts) best for AVP vs. OT release in the intact HNS, ii) are there any other parameters, transmitters, messengers, hormones and drugs that could play an important role, iii) is Ca(2+) important to understand this physiology, and finally iv) what do we learn from the comparison to the cardiac system?", "journal": "Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society", "date": "2009-03-11", "authors": ["GDayanithi", "CViero", "IShibuya"], "doi": null}

Stress was induced by 20-day administration of different emotional stress factors: daylight/darkness exposure, overcrowding, isolation, new hierarchy, tilting the cage and restriction of water or food. AMI was induced surgically. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements were done before and after AMI. Oxidant parameters were measured in heart tissue and cortisol levels were measured in plasma specimens. Compared with the nonstressed group, stress-exposed rats showed sympathetic hyperactivity characterized by increased HR together with decreased HRV. In the stressed group serum corticosterone levels were high both before and after AMI. Mean infarct size in the stressed group was significantly larger (44.6+/-3.23% and 53.1+/-4.52%, respectively; P<0.05). Increased tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (0.63+/-0.59 and 1.60+/-0.31 nmol/mg protein, respectively; P<0.05) and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content were seen in stress-exposed rats. Likewise, heart peroxynitrite levels were also high in stress-exposed rats (141.8+/-18 nmol/g tissue vs. 164.2+/-21 nmol/g tissue). Chronic emotional stress is a deteriorating factor for the induction and prognosis of MI. Exaggerated sympathetic activity may be the major contributing factor.

To see pathological basis of the reduced cardiac uptake of MIBG in LBD, we immunohistichemically examined cardiac tissues from patients with LBD, related movement disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In LBD, cardiac sympathetic denervation occurs, which accounts for the reduced cardiac uptake of MIBG. Patients with LBD have Lewy bodies (LBs) in the nervous system, whereas patients with the other neurodegenerative parkinsonism, parkin-associated Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD and have no LBs. Therefore, cardiac sympathetic denervation is closely related to the presence of LBs in a wide range of neurodegenerative processes. We further investigate how a-synuclein aggregates are involved in degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD. Accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system precedes that of neuronal somata or neurites in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and that it heralds centripetal degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD.

{"title": "Pulsatile perfusion bioreactor for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of mortality in North America. Cardiac tissue engineering aims to engineer a contractile patch of physiological thickness to use in surgical repair of diseased heart tissue. We previously reported that perfusion of engineered cardiac constructs resulted in improved tissue assembly. Because heart tissues respond to mechanical stimuli in vitro and experience rhythmic mechanical forces during contraction in vivo, we hypothesized that provision of pulsatile interstitial medium flow to an engineered cardiac patch would result in enhanced tissue assembly by way of mechanical conditioning and improved mass transport. Thus, we constructed a novel perfusion bioreactor capable of providing pulsatile fluid flow at physiologically relevant shear stresses and flow rates. Pulsatile perfusion (PP) was achieved by incorporation of a normally closed solenoid pinch valve into the perfusion loop and was carried out at a frequency of 1 Hz and a flow rate of 1.50 mL/min (PP) or 0.32 mL/min (PP-LF). Nonpulsatile flow at 1.50 mL/min (NP) or 0.32 mL/min (NP-LF) served as controls. Static controls were cultivated in well plates. The main experimental groups were seeded with cells enriched for cardiomyocytes by one preplating step (64% cardiac Troponin I+, 34% prolyl-4-hydroxylase+), whereas pure cardiac fibroblasts and cells enriched for cardiomyocytes by two preplating steps (81% cardiac Troponin I+, 16% prolyl-4-hydroxylase+) served as controls. Cultivation under pulsatile flow had beneficial effects on contractile properties. Specifically, the excitation threshold was significantly lower in the PP condition (pulsatile perfusion at 1.50 mL/min) than in the Static control, and the contraction amplitude was the highest; whereas high maximum capture rate was observed for the PP-LF conditions (pulsatile perfusion at 0.32 mL/min). The enhanced hypertrophy index observed for the PP-LF group was consistent with the highest cellular length and diameter in this group. Within the same cultivation groups (Static, NP-LF, PP-LF, PP, and NP) there were no significant differences in the diameter between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, although cardiomyocytes were significantly more elongated than fibroblasts under PP-LF conditions. Cultivation of control cell populations resulted in noncontractile constructs when cardiac fibroblasts were used (as expected) and no overall improvement in functional properties when two steps of preplating were used to enrich for cardiomyocytes in comparison with only one step of preplating.", "journal": "Biotechnology progress", "date": "2009-02-06", "authors": ["Melissa ABrown", "Rohin KIyer", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1002/btpr.11"}

Previous works have identified the genetic causes, such as alterations in the DNA sequence, for many of these diseases. We hypothesize that some patients may show genomic imbalances and changes in the gene copy number leading to genetic instability. To clarify this, we analysed DNA samples from SCD victims using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), a molecular cytogenetic technique that permits the genome-wide screening of chromosomal imbalances, and telomere length measurement. DNA derived from peripheral blood and heart tissue of 14 SCD cases and six apparently healthy control individuals were subjected to CGH analysis. Telomere length measurements were done by the Southern blotting method. Eight out of 14 SCD cases exhibited changes in DNA/gene copy number. CGH analysis showed variation in the gene copy number of some of the genes associated with potassium (KCNAB1, KCNH2, and KCNA4) and calcium (RyR2, ATP2A2) ions which are involved in maintaining the ionic balance of the heart. Alterations in TERC and TERT genes were also detected in SCD victims. In nine SCD victims shorter telomeres were detected. This might have resulted from excessive cellular proliferation and/or oxidative stress in these individuals. Copy number changes observed and telomere shortening detected in SCD cases would possibly explain at least some of the causes of SCD at early ages in humans.

Previously, it was shown that perfusion systems enhance the yield and uniformity of cell seeding and cell survival in thick cardiac constructs. The aim of our study was to form highly functional cardiac constructs starting from spatially uniform, high density cell seeded constructs. Disk-shaped elastomeric poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds were seeded with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and cultured for eight days with direct perfusion of culture medium or statically in a six-well plate. In the perfusion experimental group, the integrity of some disks was well maintained, whereas in others a central hole was formed, resulting in ring-shaped constructs. This allowed us to also study the effects of construct geometry and of interstitial flow versus channel perfusion. The ring-shaped constructs appeared to have a denser and more uniform deposition of extracellular matrix. In response to electrical stimulation, the fractional area change of the ring-shaped constructs was 7.3 and 2.7 times higher than for disk-shaped tissues cultured in perfusion or statically, respectively. These findings suggest that a combination of many factors, including scaffold elasticity and geometry and the type of perfusion system applied, need to be considered in order to engineer a cardiac construct with high contractile activity.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Phase angle shift is a better determinant for catheter electrode contact with tissue compared to a catheter sensed electrogram.", "abstract": "Convention holds that the magnitude of an electrogram (EGM) recorded from an ablation catheter indicates proximity to the tissue and may be used to guide tip placement. The shift in capacitance (phase angle) as the electrode touches the tissue may be a better guide. We compared these two methods over a range of distances in close proximity to heart tissue. This study suggests that EGM is not a reliable predictor of proximity to tissue within a few millimeters of the surface. Thus, EGM alone should not be used to guide electrode placement for ablation, as a millimeter off the surface will shift a greater percentage of delivered energy to the blood pool rather than the target tissue. EGM should also not be used to gauge force of the catheter into tissue.

Despite the different approaches and the variety of cell types used, many of these procedures have been met with mixed success. The lack of understanding of the differentiation and integration process, notably with respect to electrical signaling, significantly hampers the development of these therapies. A system was thus developed allowing the use of point source electrical stimulation on embryonic stem (ES) cells to study the effect of physiologically-relevant electrical stimulus. When modulating the amplitude of the stimulus over various differentiation stages of embryonic stem cells, differences in the proportions of cardiomyocytes to embryonic stem cells were observed through quantitative PCR.

{"title": "Frequency distribution effects of anchored mother rotors--a computer model study.", "abstract": "Recent findings indicate that major organized centers (mother rotors) can maintain ventricular fibrillation (VF). In computer models the mother rotors can be induced by local shortening of the action potential duration (APD) in the cardiac tissue. Because of the fact that these rotors tend to drift away towards regions with longer APD, an additional heterogeneity (e.g. bundle) has to be included in the model for stabilizing the activation. Thus, the rotor anchors on this bundle and yields to interesting frequency distribution effects. In the dominant frequency (DF) map of a simplified computer model of the left ventricle it can be observed that the anchoring site of the rotor produces a slightly lower DF than in the surrounding cardiac tissue. That means that due to the load effect of the bundle the frequency is decreased. Furthermore the meandering of the mother rotor around this anchor site is reflected in the spectra of signals taken randomly in the organized region. These effects are both detected with two different independent spectral estimators with different resolutions.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The fibers run approximately parallel to the epicardial wall, but their orientation relative to the circumferential axis varies transmurally, rotating from around -70 degrees at the epicardium to +70 degrees at the endocardium. This ensures that any flat transmural imaging plane or histological section contains only a partial description of myocardial architecture, as fibers intersect with the image plane at a variety of angles depending on transmural depth. We have developed a new way of viewing microstructure that accounts for this variation. Extended-volume confocal 3-D images of normal rat left-ventricular wall have previously been acquired, with an approximate size of 4x1x1 mm3. The transmural fiber rotation is measured on planes parallel to the epicardium, and used to define a curvilinear coordinate system with a transmural axis, and a second axis defined relative to the local fiber orientation.

Therefore, alternans is a desirable target of early arrhythmia prediction/detection. For long-term records and in the presence of noise, the definition of alternans is qualitative and ambiguous. This makes their automatic detection in large spatiotemporal data sets almost impossible. We present here a quantitative combinatorics-derived definition of alternans in the presence of random noise and a novel algorithm for automatic alternans detection using criteria like temporal persistence (TP), representative phase (RP) and alternans ratio (AR). This technique is validated by comparison to theoretically-derived probabilities and by test data sets with white noise. Finally, the algorithm is applied to ultra-high resolution optical mapping data from cultured cell monolayers, exhibiting calcium alternans. Early fine-scale alternans, close to the noise level, were revealed and linked to the later formation of larger regions and evolution of spatially discordant alternans (SDA). This robust new technique can be useful in quantification and better understanding of the onset of arrhythmias and in general analysis of space-time alternating signals.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

This device enables long-term extracellular electrical-activity recordings at subcellular spatial resolution and microsecond temporal resolution to capture the entire dynamics of the cellular electrical signals. To illustrate the device performance, extracellular potentials of Purkinje cells (PCs) in acute slices of the cerebellum have been analyzed. A detailed and comprehensive picture of the distribution and dynamics of action potentials (APs) in the somatic and dendritic regions of a single cell was obtained from the recordings by applying spike sorting and spike-triggered averaging methods to the collected data. An analysis of the measured local current densities revealed a reproducible sink/source pattern within a single cell during an AP. The experimental data substantiated compartmental models and can be used to extend those models to better understand extracellular single-cell potential patterns and their contributions to the population activity.

Filaments were identified using a phase-based method, and the number, size, origin, and orientation of filaments was tracked throughout each simulation. The main finding of this study is that kinetics, initial conditions, geometry, and anisotropy all affected the number, proliferation, and orientation of vortex filaments in re-entrant fibrillation.

{"title": "Adrenoceptors and adaptive mechanisms in the heart during stress.", "abstract": "Several cardiovascular disorders have been related to alterations in beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) signaling at or beyond the receptor level. During the stress reaction, the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex axis are activated, causing beta-AR overstimulation and remodeling of the beta(1)/beta(2)/beta(3)-AR ratio in cardiomyocytes. In a model of foot-shock stress, we described decreased beta(1)-AR signaling occurring simultaneously with increased beta(2)-AR signaling, whereas the response to the nonconventional agonist, CGP12177, was not altered. These alterations may play an adaptive role to the increased sympathetic drive to the heart, protecting the cardiac tissue from the cardiotoxic effects mediated by beta(1)-ARs overstimulation without altering cardiac output, since this would be sustained by the beta(2)-AR, which would also protect myocytes from apoptosis. Moreover, the selective enhancement of the beta(2)-AR population might help to diminish the risk of overstimulation since this adrenoceptor subtype couples to both, stimulatory G (Gs) and inhibitory G (Gi) proteins. On the other hand, in the model of neurogenic hypertension, the decrease in beta(1)-AR-mediated response is not followed by increase in the beta(2)-AR-mediated response. However, the response to CGP12177, which was desensitized 48 h after the surgery, was normalized 7 days after that, when beta(1)-AR were downregulated. Therefore, both experimental models provided evidence that the classical isoform of beta(1)-AR and the recently described low-affinity isoform of beta(1)-AR show independent behavior and provide the heart with adaptive mechanisms to increased sympathetic stimulation during stress.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2009-01-06", "authors": ["Regina CSpadari-Bratfisch", "Iraides Nunesdos Santos"], "doi": "10.1196/annals.1410.075"}

T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) is a 45kDa protein, immunogenic in humans, rabbits and mice. It has a high degree of homology with human (HuCRT) and mouse calreticulin (MoCRT), which would explain why an immune response to TcCRT could contribute to autoimmune reactions in Chagas' disease. Anti-TcCRT antibodies generated in A/J mice immunized with recombinant TcCRT (rTcCRT) reacted with rHuCRT and bound to neonatal and adult isogenic cardiomyocytes cultured in vitro. Interestingly, histological alterations, such as edema formation and cell infiltrates, which include CD3(+) cells, were detected in heart sections from immunized animals. Therefore, in rTcCRT-immunized mice, an autoimmune reaction against host CRT, paralleled by histological cardiac alterations, suggests a role of the parasite molecule in the induction of immunologically mediated heart tissue damage. The data presented here propose that TcCRT participates in the induction of cardiac autoimmunity in Chagas' disease.", "journal": "Molecular immunology", "date": "2008-12-26", "authors": ["Carolina HagerRibeiro", "Nandy CL\u00f3pez", "Galia ARam\u00edrez", "Carolina EValck", "Mar\u00eda CarmenMolina", "LorenaAguilar", "MargaritaRodr\u00edguez", "IsmaelMaldonado", "Ram\u00f3nMart\u00ednez", "CarlosGonz\u00e1lez", "RodrigoTroncoso", "SergioLavandero", "Alexandre RGingras", "WilhelmSchwaeble", "ArturoFerreira"], "doi": "10.1016/j.molimm.2008.10.034"}

In C3H/He mice infected with the low virulence T. cruzi Colombian strain, the persistent cardiac inflammation composed mainly of CCR5(+) T lymphocytes parallels the expression of CC-chemokines in a pro-inflammatory IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha milieu. The chronic myocarditis is accompanied by increased frequency of peripheral CCR5(+)LFA-1(+) T lymphocytes. The treatment of chronically T. cruzi-infected mice with Met-RANTES, a selective CCR1/CCR5 antagonist, led to a 20-30% decrease in CD4(+) cell numbers as well as IL-10, IL-13 and TNF-alpha expression. Further, Met-RANTES administration impaired the re-compartmentalization of the activated CD4(+)CCR5(+) lymphocytes. Importantly, Met-RANTES treatment resulted in significant reduction in parasite load and fibronectin deposition in the heart tissue. Moreover, Met-RANTES treatment significantly protected T. cruzi-infected mice against connexin 43 loss in heart tissue and CK-MB level enhancement, markers of heart dysfunction.

The understanding of the molecular complexity of the disease will help to find biomarkers that open new perspectives about early diagnosis and therapy. This work describes the identification of mediators during pathogenesis relevant for structural remodeling processes of cardiac tissue in uremic LVH. An established rat model of chronic renal failure allowed whole-genome transcriptome analyses as well as the investigation of differential expressed proteins in uremic LVH. The localization of potential biomarkers encoded by candidate genes was done by immunohistochemical analyses of cardiac tissue of the animal model as well as cardiac sections of LVH diseased patients. In addition, the induction of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCF) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with the LVH mediator angiotensin II enabled us to investigate uremic LVH progression in vitro. These results point to alterations of myocardial intercellular and cell-matrix contacts in hypertrophic cardiac tissue. Obviously, structural changes of the extracellular matrix are significantly modulated by beta-catenin associated signaling pathways. Interestingly, intracellular translocation of beta-catenin, alpha-actinin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 6 (CSPG6/SMC3) was observed in the animal model and in LVH patients.

It has recently been shown that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (CHF) in broiler chickens. Vitamins E and C, common antioxidants, have been advocated for the prevention of heart failure in humans. The present study examines the effects of supplementation of these vitamins on incidence of CHF and prevention of oxidative stress in the myocardium. 2. Commercial male broilers were randomly allocated to three experimental groups and, respectively, offered commercial broiler diet (control), commercial diets fortified with vitamin E (960 IU/kg) or vitamin C (400 mg/kg). The broilers were monitored daily for overt signs of heart failure and clinical data including ECG and blood gas analysis were collected periodically. Lipid peroxidation was measured in cardiac tissues from apparently normal broilers and broilers developing CHF in each group using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. 3. Overall, the incidence of CHF in broilers given diets fortified with vitamin E or vitamin C was not significantly different as compared to the control group. The incidence of overt signs of hypoxaemia was lower in the vitamin C group than in the control group. Lipid peroxidation was highest in broilers that developed CHF as compared to apparently normal broilers fed either vitamin E or C fortified diets. Neither vitamin E nor vitamin C was effective in preventing oxidative damage in broilers that developed CHF. 4. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure in broilers, but dietary supplementation of antioxidant vitamins did not prevent oxidative damage in broilers that developed CHF. Beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation were evidenced by lower incidence of hypoxaemia, and the tendency to reduce the susceptibility of broilers to heart failure.

Among the many disorders of the heart, myocardial infarction, which can lead to the development of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, or even death, has the most severe social and economic ramifications. Lack of sufficient available donor hearts for heart transplantation, the only currently viable treatment for heart failure other than medical management options (ACE inhibition, beta blockade, use of AICDs, etc.) that improve the survival of patients with heart failure emphasises the need for alternative therapies. One promising alternative replaces cardiac muscle damaged by myocardial infarction with new contractile cardiomyocytes and vessels obtained through stem cell-based regeneration. We report on the state of the art of recovery of cardiac functions by using stem cell engineering. Current research focuses on (a) inducing stem cells into becoming cardiac cells before or after injection into a host, (b) growing replacement heart tissue in vitro, and (c) stimulating the proliferation of the post-mitotic cardiomyocytes in situ. The most promising treatment option for patients is the engineering of new heart tissue that can be implanted into damaged areas. Engineering of cardiac tissue currently employs the use of co-culture of stem cells with scaffold microenvironments engineered to improve tissue survival and enhance differentiation. Growth of heart tissue in vitro using scaffolds, soluble collagen, and cell sheets has unique advantages. To compensate for the loss of ventricular mass and contractility of the injured cardiomyocytes, different stem cell populations have been extensively studied as potential sources of new cells to ameliorate the injured myocardium and eventually restore cardiac function. Unresolved issues including insufficient cell generation survival, growth, and differentiation have led to mixed results in preclinical and clinical studies.

Levels of intracellular calcium modulate inactivation gating of NaV1.5, in part through a C-terminal EF-hand calcium binding domain. The significance of this structure is underscored by the fact that mutations within this domain are associated with specific cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis for calcium regulation of channel function, we have determined the solution structure of the C-terminal EF-hand domain using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR. The structure confirms the existence of the four-helix bundle common to EF-hand domain proteins. However, the location of this domain is shifted with respect to that predicted on the basis of a consensus 12-residue EF-hand calcium binding loop in the sequence. This finding is consistent with the weak calcium affinity reported for the isolated EF-hand domain; high affinity binding is observed only in a construct with an additional 60 residues C-terminal to the EF-hand domain, including the IQ motif that is central to the calcium regulatory apparatus. The binding of an IQ motif peptide to the EF-hand domain was characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The peptide binds between helices I and IV in the EF-hand domain, similar to the binding of target peptides to other EF-hand calcium-binding proteins.

Since S1P is recognised as a survival factor in many tissues, there has been much interest in S1P as a cardioprotective agent.

{"title": "Control of the adaptive response of the heart to stress via the Notch1 receptor pathway.", "abstract": "In the damaged heart, cardiac adaptation relies primarily on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The recent discovery of cardiac stem cells in the postnatal heart, however, suggests that these cells could participate in the response to stress via their capacity to regenerate cardiac tissues. Using models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure, we demonstrate that components of the Notch pathway are up-regulated in the hypertrophic heart. The Notch pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cell-to-cell communication system, which is crucial in many developmental processes. Notch also plays key roles in the regenerative capacity of self-renewing organs. In the heart, Notch1 signaling takes place in cardiomyocytes and in mesenchymal cardiac precursors and is activated secondary to stimulated Jagged1 expression on the surface of cardiomyocytes. Using mice lacking Notch1 expression specifically in the heart, we show that the Notch1 pathway controls pathophysiological cardiac remodeling. In the absence of Notch1, cardiac hypertrophy is exacerbated, fibrosis develops, function is altered, and the mortality rate increases. Therefore, in cardiomyocytes, Notch controls maturation, limits the extent of the hypertrophic response, and may thereby contribute to cell survival.

In the present study we sought to investigate the cardiopulmonary responses on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) following inhalation of UfCPs (24 h, 172 mug.m-3), to assess whether compromised animals (SHR) exhibit a different response pattern compared to the previously studied healthy rats (WKY).\nCardiophysiological response in SHRs was analyzed using radiotelemetry. Blood pressure (BP) and its biomarkers plasma renin-angiotensin system were also assessed. Lung and cardiac mRNA expressions for markers of oxidative stress (hemeoxygenase-1), blood coagulation (tissue factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), and endothelial function (endothelin-1, and endothelin receptors A and B) were analyzed following UfCPs exposure in SHRs. UfCPs-mediated inflammatory responses were assessed from broncho-alveolar-lavage fluid (BALF).\nIncreased BP and heart rate (HR) by about 5% with a lag of 1-3 days were detected in UfCPs exposed SHRs. Inflammatory markers of BALF, lung (pulmonary) and blood (systemic) were not affected. However, mRNA expression of hemeoxygenase-1, endothelin-1, endothelin receptors A and B, tissue factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor showed a significant induction (~2.5-fold; p < 0.05) with endothelin 1 being the maximally induced factor (6-fold; p < 0.05) on the third recovery day in the lungs of UfCPs exposed SHRs; while all of these factors - except hemeoxygenase-1 - were not affected in cardiac tissues. Strikingly, the UfCPs-mediated altered BP is paralleled by the induction of renin-angiotensin system in plasma.\nOur finding shows that UfCPs exposure at levels which does not induce detectable pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation, triggers distinct effects in the lung and also at the systemic level in compromised SHRs. These effects are characterized by increased activity of plasma renin-angiotensin system and circulating white blood cells together with moderate increases in the BP, HR and decreases in heart rate variability. This systemic effect is associated with pulmonary, but not cardiac, mRNA induction of biomarkers reflective of oxidative stress; activation of vasoconstriction, stimulation of blood coagulation factors, and inhibition of fibrinolysis.

In the current study we have investigated the antioxidative properties of an ethanol extract of the bark of Terminalia arjuna (T. arjuna ethanol extract [TAEE]) against sodium fluoride (NaF)-induced oxidative stress in murine heart. Experimental mice were divided into four groups. The first group served as the normal control. The second group received NaF at a dose of 600 ppm through drinking water for 1 week and served as the toxin control. The third group was exposed to TAEE (at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight for 1 week) prior to NaF intoxication, and the last group was treated with vitamin C at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight for 1 week prior to NaF intoxication and served as the positive control in the study. The activities of various antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase), levels of cellular metabolites, reduced glutathione, and oxidized glutathione, levels of lipid peroxidation end products, and protein carbonyl contents were determined in the cardiac tissues of all the experimental animals. NaF intoxication significantly altered all the indices related to the prooxidant-antioxidant status of the heart; treatment with the active constituents prior to NaF administration, however, prevented these alterations. In addition, the ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay revealed that TAEE enhanced the cardiac intracellular antioxidant activity. Histological studies also demonstrated a cardioprotective action of TAEE. The combined results suggest that TAEE protects murine hearts from NaF-induced oxidative stress, probably via its antioxidant properties.", "journal": "Journal of medicinal food", "date": "2008-12-05", "authors": ["MahuaSinha", "PrasenjitManna", "Parames CSil"], "doi": "10.1089/jmf.2007.0130"}

Although expression of all components necessary for a locally derived adipose tissue RAS has been demonstrated within adipose tissue, independence of local adipose RAS component concentrations from corresponding plasma RAS fluctuations has not been addressed. To analyze this, we varied in vivo rat plasma concentrations of two RAS components, renin and angiotensinogen (AGT), to determine the influence of their plasma concentrations on adipose and cardiac tissue levels in both perfused (plasma removed) and nonperfused samples. Variation of plasma RAS components was accomplished by four treatment groups: normal, DOCA salt, bilateral nephrectomy, and losartan. Adipose and cardiac tissue AGT concentrations correlated positively with plasma values. Perfusion of adipose tissue decreased AGT concentrations by 11.1%, indicating that adipose tissue AGT was in equilibrium with plasma. Cardiac tissue renin levels positively correlated with plasma renin concentration for all treatments. In contrast, adipose tissue renin levels did not correlate with plasma renin, with the exception of extremely high plasma renin concentrations achieved in the losartan-treated group. These results suggest that adipose tissue may control its own local renin concentration independently of plasma renin as a potential mechanism for maintaining a functional local adipose RAS.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "CNTF-evoked activation of JAK and ERK mediates the functional expression of T-type Ca2+ channels in chicken nodose neurons.", "abstract": "Culture of chicken nodose neurons with CNTF but not BDNF causes a significant increase in T-type Ca(2+) channel expression. CNTF-induced channel expression requires 12 h stimulation to reach maximal expression and is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis, suggesting the involvement of a post-translational mechanism. In this study, we have investigated the biochemical mechanism responsible for the CNTF-dependent stimulation of T-type channel expression in nodose neurons. Stimulation of nodose neurons with CNTF evoked a considerable increase in signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. CNTF-evoked ERK phosphorylation was transient whereas BDNF-evoked activation of ERK was sustained. Pre-treatment of nodose neurons with the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor P6 blocked STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation, whereas the ERK inhibitor U0126 prevented ERK activation but not STAT3 phosphorylation. Both P6 and U0126 inhibited the stimulatory effect of CNTF on T-type channel expression. Inhibition of STAT3 activation by the selective blocker stattic has no effect on ERK phosphorylation and T-type channel expression. These results indicate that CNTF-evoked stimulation of T-type Ca(2+) channel expression in chicken nodose neurons requires JAK-dependent ERK signaling. A cardiac tissue extract derived from E20 chicken heart was also effective in promoting T-type Ca(2+) channel expression and STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation. The ability of the heart extract to stimulate JAK/STAT and ERK activation was developmentally regulated. These findings provide further support to the idea that CNTF or a CNTF-like factor mediates normal expression of T-type channels.", "journal": "Journal of neurochemistry", "date": "2008-12-03", "authors": ["ThomasTrimarchi", "JudithPachuau", "AndrewShepherd", "DeblinaDey", "MiguelMartin-Caraballo"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05759.x"}

The heart samples were isolated from sham, 1, 3, and 7 day post-sepsis in the CI model and at 2 and 20 h post-sepsis in the CLP model. In the CI model, the plasma concentration of norepinephrine (NE) significantly increased at 1, 3, and 7 days post-CI compared to the sham group. The myocardial syntaxin1A mRNA and protein expression also significantly increased at 1 day post-CI compared to the sham group. However, the sepsis-induced increase in syntaxin1A returned to the baseline values at 3 and 7 days post-CI. The expressions of myocardial NET mRNA and protein were not altered at 1 day post-CI but significantly decreased at 3 days post-CI compared to the sham and 1 day post-CI groups. The immunohistochemical analyses revealed an increased localization of NET and syntaxin1A in the heart tissue sections of the 1 day post-CI group. In the CLP model of severe sepsis, the myocardial syntaxin1A mRNA protein expressions significantly increased at 2 h post-CLP, but remained unchanged at 20 h post-CLP compared to the sham group. In contrast, the myocardial expressions of NET mRNA and protein significantly decreased at both 2 and 20 h post-CLP compared to the sham group.

Adult male mice were subjected to 30 min of ischemia and 3 or 24 h of reperfusion. Mice were randomized to receive vehicle, INO-4885 without catalytic moiety, or INO-4885 (3-300 microg/kg i.p.) 10 min before reperfusion. Infarct size, apoptosis, nitrotyrosine content, NO/O2(.-) production, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS)/NADPH oxidase expression were determined. INO-4885 treatment reduced ischemia/reperfusion-induced protein nitration and caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent fashion in the range of 3 to 100 microg/kg. However, doses exceeding 100 microg/kg produced nonspecific effects and attenuated its protective ability. At the optimal dose (30 microg/kg), INO-4885 significantly reduced infarct size (p < 0.01), decreased apoptosis (p < 0.01), and reduced tissue nitrotyrosine content (p < 0.01). As expected, INO-4885 had no effect on ischemia/reperfusion-induced iNOS expression and NO overproduction. To our surprise, this compound significantly reduced superoxide production and partially blocked NADPH oxidase overexpression in the ischemic/reperfused cardiac tissue.

Here, we show the application of a bimodal biophotonic imaging approach that employs optical coherence tomography and fluorescent imaging to investigate the structure-function relationship at the tissue level in the heart. Reconstruction of cardiac excitation and structure was limited by the depth penetration of bimodal imaging to approximately 2 mm in atrial tissue, and approximately 1 mm in ventricular myocardium. The subcellular resolution of optical coherence tomography clearly demonstrated that microscopic fiber orientation governs the pattern of wave propagation in functionally characterized rabbit sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal preparations and revealed structural heterogeneities contributing to ventricular arrhythmias.

We characterized electrophysiological alterations and arrhythmias during regional ischemia/reperfusion in a simpler 2-dimensional geometry of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers.\nOptical mapping of intracellular Ca (Ca(i)) and voltage was performed with the use of Rhod 2-AM and Rh-237, respectively. Regional ischemia was mimicked by covering the central portion of monolayer with a glass coverslip, and reperfusion was mimicked by removing the coverslip. Monolayers were stained with fluorescent antibodies to detect total and dephosphorylated connexin-43 at various time points. During coverslip ischemia, action potential duration shortened, Ca(i) transient duration was prolonged, and local conduction velocity (CV) slowed progressively, with loss of excitability after 10.6 +/- 3.6 minutes. CV slowing was accompanied by connexin-43 dephosphorylation. During ischemia, spontaneous reentry occurred in 5 of 11 monolayers, initiated by extrasystoles arising from the border zone or unidirectional conduction block of paced beats. On reperfusion, excitability recovered within 1.0 +/- 0.8 minutes, but CV remained depressed for 9.0 +/- 3.0 minutes, promoting reentry in the reperfused zone. As connexin-43 phosphorylation recovered in the reperfused zone, CV normalized, and arrhythmias resolved.\nAcute regional ischemia/reperfusion in neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers recapitulates electrophysiological alterations and arrhythmias similar to those observed during acute coronary occlusion/reperfusion in intact hearts. During early reperfusion, slow recovery from connexin-43 dephosphorylation leads to persistent CV slowing, creating a highly arrhythmogenic substrate.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2008-11-19", "authors": ["Carlosde Diego", "Rakesh KPai", "FuhuaChen", "Lai-HuaXie", "JanDe Leeuw", "James NWeiss", "MiguelValderr\u00e1bano"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.789149"}

We tested the hypothesis that alpha8 integrin-mediated cell-matrix interactions add to cardiac fibrotic alterations during hypertension.\nDesoxycorticosterone-acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension was induced in mice homozygous for a deletion of the alpha8 integrin chain and wild-type mice. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed in heart tissue.\nBlood pressure was slightly higher in DOCA-treated alpha8 integrin-deficient mice compared to DOCA-treated wild types. Expression of alpha8 integrin and its ligands fibronectin and osteopontin was increased in the hearts of DOCA-treated wild types compared to salt-loaded controls. However, relative left ventricular weights did not differ between DOCA-treated wild types and alpha8 integrin-deficient mice. Moreover, expansion of collagen I immunoreactivity and cell proliferation was similar in both groups.

{"title": "Increased expression of interleukin-1beta and its novel splice variant in canine hearts with volume overload.", "abstract": "Volume overload frequently caused in dogs by chronic degenerative valvular disease (CDVD), eventually leads to cardiac failure. Experimental and clinical evidences demonstrate that increased interleukin-1beta serum level in patients with heart insufficiency correlates with the severity of failure irrespective of its etiology. Very little is known about the IL-1beta expression in failing vs. non-failing myocardium. IL-1beta transcript level was determined in the CDVD dogs (n=17) and control animals (n=9) without cardiac insufficiency by real-time PCR. IL-1beta transcript level in failing hearts was higher than in the control. In both groups the highest IL-1beta level was detected in the left ventricles. Although IL-1beta is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine most of the CDVD dogs displayed no inflammatory infiltrates into the myocardium. Massive fibrosis was observed in the control group, unlike the failing hearts, in which cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and atrophy dominated. The alternative IL-1beta transcript identified here (IL-1betasv1) was significantly elevated in the failing myocardium compared with the control group. Increased IL-1beta expression seems to be associated with mechanical heart overload. Its endogenous origin, and certain histopathological findings attributed to IL-1beta indicate its importance in cardiac hypertrophy and failure. The lack of some typical IL-1beta actions, i.e. inflammatory, pyrogenic and fibrotic, may suggest a different role of this cytokine in myocardium.

Nine fentanyl-positive cases were identified by history of drug use over a 15-month period (2007-2008). Femoral blood fentanyl concentrations (n = 9) ranged from 2.7 to 52.5 microg/L, liver fentanyl tissue (n = 9) ranged from 37.0 to 179 microg/kg, and heart fentanyl tissue (n = 3) ranged from 52.8 to 179 microg/kg. Liver tissue to femoral blood ratios ranged from 0.85 to 35.8, and heart tissue to femoral blood ratios ranged from 1.9 to 5.4.

MSC are present in most tissues including the transplantable organs. It is therefore unavoidable that MSC will be exposed to immunosuppressive drugs in a clinical transplantation setting. The molecular targets of these drugs are expressed in MSC, but the effect of their inhibition on MSC functioning is unknown.\nMSC were isolated and expanded from heart tissue and the effects of the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus, the cell cycle inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA), and the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor on MSC survival, proliferation, differentiation, and immunosuppressive capacity were examined.\nShort-term exposure to the immunosuppressants did not induce toxicity or apoptosis in MSC, but high-dose tacrolimus induced toxicity after 7 days. MPA and rapamycin inhibited MSC proliferation at therapeutic doses. The immunosuppressants had differential effects on the differentiation capacity of MSC. Tacrolimus reduced the expression of troponin T type 2 and desmin during cardiomyogenic differentiation of MSC, whereas MPA decreased the deposition of calcified minerals during osteogenic differentiation. Rapamycin stimulated lipid production during adipogenic differentiation. Unexpectedly, MSC had adverse effects on the immunosuppressive efficacy of tacrolimus and rapamycin. There was no such effect of MSC on the function of MPA. Preincubation of MSC with tacrolimus increased the immunosuppressive capacity of MSC.\nThis study demonstrates that therapeutic concentrations of immunosuppressive drugs affect MSC function.

A causal association between viral infection and cardiac disease was frequently postulated following the detection of B19 DNA by PCR in endomyocardial biopsy specimens. Since the lifelong persistence of B19 DNA in bone marrow, skin, synovia, tonsils, and liver was previously reported, the aim of our study was to investigate the possibility of asymptomatic B19 DNA persistence in heart tissue. Myocardial autopsy and postmortem blood samples were prospectively collected from 69 bodies sent to the Department of Forensic Medicine, Freiburg University Medical Center, for inquests. All study subjects were screened for B19-specific antibodies using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. Tissue samples were analyzed by real-time PCR for the presence of viral DNA. Since the presence of B19 genotype 2, known to have been circulating before 1960, would prove long-lasting persistence, the presence of the B19 genotype was retrospectively determined in seven of the study subjects by melting temperature analysis and sequencing of the PCR product. B19 DNA was found in myocardial samples from 46 of 48 seropositive and in none of 21 seronegative individuals. B19 genotype 1 was found in three patients born between 1950 and 1969. Genotype 2 was found in four patients born between 1927 and 1957. Our findings suggest lifelong persistence of B19 DNA in heart tissue.

Our 2-DE analyses displayed over 25 spots for the 20S complexes (17 subunits), indicating multiply modified subunits of cardiac proteasomes. The identification of specific PTM sites subsequent to 2-DE was supported by MS. These PTMs included phosphorylation and oxidation. Most of the PTMs occurred in low stoichiometry and required enrichment to enhance the detection sensitivity.

{"title": "Control of scroll-wave turbulence using resonant perturbations.", "abstract": "Turbulence of scroll waves is a sort of spatiotemporal chaos that exists in three-dimensional excitable media. Cardiac tissue and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction are examples of such media. In cardiac tissue, chaotic behavior is believed to underlie fibrillation which, without intervention, precedes cardiac death. In this study we investigate suppression of the turbulence using stimulation of two different types, \"modulation of excitability\" and \"extra transmembrane current.\" With cardiac defibrillation in mind, we used a single pulse as well as repetitive extra current with both constant and feedback controlled frequency. We show that turbulence can be terminated using either a resonant modulation of excitability or a resonant extra current. The turbulence is terminated with much higher probability using a resonant frequency perturbation than a nonresonant one. Suppression of the turbulence using a resonant frequency is up to fifty times faster than using a nonresonant frequency, in both the modulation of excitability and the extra current modes. We also demonstrate that resonant perturbation requires strength one order of magnitude lower than that of a single pulse, which is currently used in clinical practice to terminate cardiac fibrillation. Our results provide a robust method of controlling complex chaotic spatiotemporal processes.

After 30 days of the treatment, obesity was evidenced in HS rats from enhanced body weight, respiratory quotient, hypertriglyceridemia. As well depressed resting metabolic rate, and oxygen consumption per surface area. HS rats had triacylglycerol accumulation, oxidative stress and metabolic shifting in cardiac tissue. NAC enhanced fat oxidation and energy expenditure, normalizing these adverse effects, comparing HS-N and HS rats. The beta-hydroxyacyl coenzymne-A dehydrogenase activity was higher in HS-N animals, indicating higher heart fatty acid degradation than in HS.

{"title": "Is cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats the cause or the consequence of oxidative stress?", "abstract": "The aim of this work was to assess the possible correlation between oxidative damage and the development of cardiac hypertrophy in heart tissue from young (40-d-old) and older (4-, 11- and 19-month-old) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in comparison with age-matched Wistar (W) rats. To this end, levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), nitrotyrosine contents, NAD(P)H oxidase activity, superoxide production, and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were determined. Compared to age-matched normotensive rats, SHR showed a significant increase in systolic blood pressure from 40 d of age and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was significantly evident from 4 months of age. W rats (11- and 19-month-old) also showed an increase in LVH with aging. TBARS and nitrotyrosine levels were similar in young rats from both strains and were significantly increased with age in both strains, with the values in SHR being significantly higher than those in age-matched W rats. NAD(P)H activity was similar in young SHR and W rats, whereas it was higher in aged SHR compared with age-matched W rats. Compared to W rats, superoxide production was higher in aged SHR, and was abolished by NAD(P)H inhibition with apocynin. CAT activity was increased in the hearts of 4-month-old SHR compared to age-matched W rats and was decreased in the hearts of the oldest SHR compared to the oldest W rats. SOD and GPx activities decreased in both rat strains with aging. Moreover, an increase in collagen deposition with aging was evident in both rat strains. Taken together, these data showed that aged SHR exhibited higher cardiac hypertrophy and oxidative damage compared to W rats, indicating that the two undesirable effects are associated. That is, oxidative stress appears to be a cause and/or consequence of hypertrophy development in this animal model.", "journal": "Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension", "date": "2008-10-30", "authors": ["Mar\u00eda CeciliaAlvarez", "ClaudiaCaldiz", "Juliana CFantinelli", "Carolina DGarciarena", "Gloria MConsole", "Gladys EChiappe de Cingolani", "Susana MMosca"], "doi": "10.1291/hypres.31.1465"}

The aim of this study was to determine the best method to measure the myocardial T2* from multi-gradient-echo data acquired both with and without black-blood preparation. Sixteen thalassemia patients from six centers were scanned twice locally, within 1 week, using an optimized bright-blood T2* sequence and then subsequently scanned at the standardization center in London within 4 weeks, using a T2* sequence both with and without black-blood preparation. Different curve-fitting models (monoexponential, truncation, and offset) were applied to the data and the results were compared by means of reproducibility. T2* measurements obtained using the bright- and black-blood techniques. The black-blood data were well fitted by the monoexponential model, which suggests that a more accurate measure of T2* can be obtained by removing the main source of errors in the bright-blood data. For bright-blood data, the offset model appeared to underestimate T2* values substantially and was less reproducible. The truncation model gave rise to more reproducible T2* measurements, which were also closer to the values obtained from the black-blood data.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2008-10-29", "authors": ["TaigangHe", "Peter DGatehouse", "Gillian CSmith", "Raad HMohiaddin", "Dudley JPennell", "David NFirmin"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.21744"}

Aims of the present study were to examine the acute effects of CVT-3619 on whole-body and cardiac glucose and fatty acid kinetics in vivo in normal and diet-induced insulin-resistant rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a chow (CH) or high-fat (HF) diet for 4 weeks. Catheters were then chronically implanted in the carotid artery and jugular vein for sampling and infusions, respectively. After 5 days of recovery, fasted animals (10 h) received either saline or CVT-3619 (0.4 mg/kg bolus + 1 mg/kg/h). Indices of glucose and fatty acid utilization were obtained by the administration of 2-deoxy[(14)C]glucose and [9,10-(3)H]-(R)-2-bromopalmitate. HF feeding resulted in elevated, fasting insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels compared with CH. CVT-3619 caused a 64 and 86% reduction of FFA and insulin in HF (p < 0.05) but less (N.S.) in CH diet-fed animals. In HF diet-fed rats, CVT-3619 increased whole-body glucose clearance with no change in fatty acid kinetics. Likewise, analysis of cardiac tissue metabolism showed that CVT-3619 caused an increased glucose but not fatty acid clearance in HF-fed animals. Results show that the acute administration of CVT-3619 lowers circulating fatty acid levels, leading to improved whole-body and cardiac glucose clearance in a model of diet-induced insulin resistance.

Meta-analyses using a random-effects model were conducted and heterogeneity was explored using sub-group analyses.\nThirteen RCTs (811 participants) were included. There were insufficient events on clinical outcomes like mortality to draw clear conclusions. Stem/progenitor cell treatment does not appear to be associated with an increase in adverse events but again the data do not allow clear conclusions. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was the outcome with most results and there was marked heterogeneity between trials. There was however a consistent pattern indicating that BMSC treatment generally improves short-term LVEF, with similar trends for left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic volumes (LVESV and LVEDV), infarct size or cardiac wall motion. There was a positive correlation between cell dose infused and the effect on LVEF measured by magnetic resonance imaging.\nThe results of this systematic review suggest that there is little evidence to assess the clinical effects of this treatment.

{"title": "Endothelial cell coculture within tissue-engineered cardiomyocyte sheets enhances neovascularization and improves cardiac function of ischemic hearts.", "abstract": "Regenerative therapies, including myocardial tissue engineering, have been pursued as a new possibility to repair the damaged myocardium, and previously the transplantation of layered cardiomyocyte sheets has been shown to be able to improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction. We examined the effects of promoting neovascularization by controlling the densities of cocultured endothelial cells (ECs) within engineered myocardial tissues created using our cell sheet-based tissue engineering approach.\nNeonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cocultured with GFP-positive rat-derived ECs on temperature-responsive culture dishes. Cocultured ECs formed cell networks within the cardiomyocyte sheets, which were preserved during cell harvest from the dishes using simple temperature reduction. We also observed significantly increased in vitro production of vessel-forming cytokines by the EC-positive cardiac cell sheets. After layering of 3 cardiac cell sheets to create 3-dimensional myocardial tissues, these patch-like tissue grafts were transplanted onto infarcted rat hearts. Four weeks after transplantation, recovery of cardiac function could be significantly improved by increasing the EC densities within the engineered myocardial tissues. Additionally, when the EC-positive cardiac tissues were transplanted to myocardial infarction models, we observed significantly greater numbers of capillaries in the grafts as compared with the EC-negative cell sheets. Finally, blood vessels originating from the engineered EC-positive cardiac tissues bridged into the infarcted myocardium to connect with capillaries of the host heart.\nIn vitro engineering of 3-dimensional cardiac tissues with preformed EC networks that can be easily connected to host vessels can contribute to the reconstruction of myocardial tissue grafts with a high potential for cardiac function repair. These results indicate that neovascularization can contribute to improved cardiac function after the transplantation of engineered cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2008-10-10", "authors": ["HidekazuSekine", "TatsuyaShimizu", "KyokoHobo", "SachikoSekiya", "JosephYang", "MasayukiYamato", "HiromiKurosawa", "EijiKobayashi", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.757286"}
{"title": "A novel activity of the Dickkopf-1 amino terminal domain promotes axial and heart development independently of canonical Wnt inhibition.", "abstract": "The secreted Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) protein mediates numerous cell fate decisions and morphogenetic processes. Its carboxyl terminal cysteine-rich region (termed C1) binds LRP5/6 and inhibits canonical Wnt signaling. Paradoxically, the isolated C1 domain of Dkk1 as well as Wnt antagonists that act by sequestering Wnts, such as Frz-B, WIF-1 and Crescent, are poor mimics of the inductive and patterning activities of Dkk1 critical for heart and axial development. To understand the basis for the unique properties of Dkk1, we investigated the function of its amino terminal cysteine-rich region (N1). N1 does not bind LRP or Kremen nor inhibit Wnt signaling and has had no known function. We show that it can synergize with BMP antagonism to induce prechordal and axial mesoderm when expressed as an independent protein in Xenopus embryos. Moreover, we show that it can function in trans to complement the activity of C1 protein to mediate two embryologic functions of Dkk1: induction of chordal and prechordal mesoderm and specification of heart tissue from non-cardiogenic mesoderm. Remarkably, N1 also synergizes with WIF-1 and Crescent, indicating that N1 signals independently of C1 and its interactions with LRP. Since cleavage of Dkk1 is not detected, these results define N1 as a novel signaling domain within the intact protein that is responsible for the potent effects of Dkk1 on the induction and patterning of the body axis and heart. We conclude that this new activity is also likely to synergize with canonical Wnt inhibitory in the numerous developmental and disease processes that involve Dkk1.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2008-10-09", "authors": ["OksanaKorol", "Ruchika WGupta", "MarkMercola"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.09.012"}
{"title": "Comparison of mRNA expression of transcriptional factors and intercalated disk constituent proteins between in vivo and cultured cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "The weak contractile force exerted by engineered cardiac muscle is a big problem in cardiac muscle tissue engineering, even though the field has made great progress over the past decade. We believe that one major reason for the weak contractile force is that the expression of genes regulating cardiomyocyte differentiation and cardiac tissue syncytium may be different for in vivo and cultured cells. In the present study, we investigated the difference of mRNA expression under in vivo and culture conditions in order to seek a target for further gene transfer treatment in the process of cardiac tissue construction. To this end, mRNA expression of four major transcriptional factors (SRF, p300, Nkx2.5, and myocardin) and two intercalated disk constituent proteins (N-cadherin and connexin43) in rat cardiomyocytes was measured by means of ratiometric reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cardiomyocytes were harvested from the hearts of 18-day (about 3 days before birth) Wistar-rat embryos (embryonic cells), 12-day neonatal rat hearts (neonatal cells), or 14-day successive dish culture of the embryonic cells harvested from 18-day embryos (cultured cells). The results indicated that, except for SRF, the mRNAs had a lower expression tendency in cultured cells than in embryonic and in neonatal cells; in particular, the mRNA expression of myocardin, N-cadherin, and connexin43 of cultured cardiomyocytes was significantly lower than that of neonatal cells. Therefore, myocardin is a candidate for forced gene up-expression during the construction of engineered cardiac tissue; in addition, a plausible reason for the weak contractile force of engineered cardiac tissue is the weak constitution of intercalated disk, because it was elucidated that mRNA expression of proteins related to intercalated disk were lower in culture.", "journal": "Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs", "date": "2008-10-07", "authors": ["TakaoNakamura", "ZhonggangFeng", "TsubasaHonda", "YasutomoNomura", "TatsuoKitajima", "MitsuoUmezu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10047-008-0414-7"}

However, the classical mobilizing agent, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) relapsed after revealing an impaired homing capacity. In the search for superior cytokines, erythropoietin (EPO) appears to be a promising agent. Therefore, we analyzed in a murine model of surgically induced MI the influence of EPO treatment on survival and functional parameters as well as BMC mobilization, homing, and effect on resident cardiac stem cells (CSCs). Human EPO was injected intraperitoneally after ligation of the left anterior descendens (LAD) for 3 days with a total dose of 5000 IU/kg 6 and 30 days after MI, and pressure volume relationships were investigated in vivo. Cardiac tissues were analyzed by histology. To show the effect on BMCs and CSCs, FACS analyses were performed. Homing factors were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and ELISA. EPO-treated animals showed a significant improvement of survival post-MI (62 vs. 36%). At days 6 and 30, all hemodynamic parameters associated with attenuated remodeling, enhanced neovascularization, and diminished apoptotic cells in the peri-infarct area were improved. BMC subpopulations (CD31(+), c-kit(+), and Sca-1(+) cells) were mobilized, and homing of Sca-1(+) and CXCR4(+) BMCs toward an SDF-1 gradient into the ischemic myocardium was enhanced. However, there was no beneficial effect on CSCs. We have shown that EPO application after MI shows cardioprotective effects. This may be explained by mobilization of BMCs, which are homing via the CXCR-4/SDF-1 axis. However, EPO has no beneficial effects on resident CSCs.

TCA carbons must be replenished by anaplerosis for normal cardiac function. Biotin is cofactor of the anaplerotic enzymes pyruvate and propionyl-CoA carboxylases. Here, we found that in biotin deficient rats, both carboxylases decreased 90% in adipose tissue, jejunum and spleen, but in heart they conserved about 60% residual activity. We then investigated if under biotin deficiency (BtDEF), the heart is able to maintain its function in vivo and in isolated conditions, and during ischemia and reperfusion, where metabolism drastically shifts from oxidative to mainly glycolytic. Neither glucose nor octanoate oxidation were severely affected in BtDEF hearts, as assessed by mechanical performance, oxygen uptake or high-energy metabolite content; however, myocardial hexokinase activity and lactate concentration were reduced in deficient hearts. When challenged by ischemia and reperfusion injury, BtDEF hearts did not suffer more damage than the controls, although they lowered significantly their performance, when changed to ischemic conditions, which may have clinical implications. Post-ischemic increase in ADP/ATP ratio was similar in both groups, but during reperfusion there was higher rhythm perturbation in BtDEF hearts.

In this report, primary cardiac ventricular cells were grown on electrospun, biodegradable polyurethane (ES-PU) with either aligned or unaligned microfibers. ES-PU scaffolds supported high-density cultures and cell subpopulations remained intact over two weeks in culture. ES-PU cultures contained electrically-coupled cardiomyocytes with connexin-43 localized to points of cell:cell contact. Multi-cellular organization correlated with microfiber orientation and aligned materials yielded highly oriented cardiomyocyte groupings. Atrial natriuretic peptide, a molecular marker that shows decreasing expression during ventricular cell maturation, was significantly lower in cultures grown on ES-PU scaffolds than in those grown on tissue culture polystyrene. Cells grown on aligned ES-PU had significantly lower steady state levels of ANP and constitutively released less ANP over time indicating that scaffold-imposed cell organization resulted in a shift in cell phenotype to a more mature state.

Western blot analyses revealed large amounts of fesselin in gizzard smooth muscle with lower amounts in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In gizzard, fesselin was detected by immunofluorescence as discrete cytoplasmic structures. Fesselin did not co-localize with talin, vinculin or caveolin indicating that fesselin is not associated with dense plaques or caveolar regions of the cell membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy established localization of fesselin within dense bodies. Since dense bodies function as anchorage points for actin and desmin in smooth muscle cells, fesselin may be involved in establishing cytoskeletal structure in this tissue. In skeletal muscle, fesselin was associated with desmin in regularly spaced bands distributed along the length of muscle fibers suggesting localization to the Z-line. Infrequently, this banding pattern was observed in heart tissue as well.

We examined whether rat heart contains catalysts potentially capable of reducing nitrite to NO during an episode of regional myocardial ischemia produced by temporary coronary artery occlusion. In intact Sprague-Dawley rats, a 15-min coronary occlusion lowered the nitrite concentration of the myocardial regions exhibiting ischemic glucose metabolism to approximately 50% that of nonischemic regions (185 +/- 223 vs. 420 +/- 203 nmol/l). Nitrite was rapidly repleted during subsequent reperfusion. The heart tissue tested in vitro acquired a substantial ability to consume nitrite when made hypoxic at neutral pH, and this ability was slightly enhanced by simultaneously lowering the pH to 5.5. More than 70% of this activity could be abolished by flushing the coronary circulation with crystalloid to remove trapped erythrocytes. Correspondingly, erythrocytes demonstrated the ability to reduce exogenous nitrite to NO under hypoxic conditions in vitro. In erythrocyte-free heart tissue, the nitrite consumption increased fivefold when the pH was lowered to 5.5. Approximately 40% of this pH-sensitive increase in nitrite consumption could be blocked by the xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor allopurinol, whereas lowering the Po(2) sufficiently to desaturate myoglobin accelerated it further. We conclude that rat heart contains several factors capable of catalyzing ischemic nitrite reduction; the most potent is contained within erythrocytes and activated by hypoxia, whereas the remainder includes xanthine oxidoreductase and other pH-sensitive factors endogenous to heart tissue, including deoxymyoglobin.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We investigated on the differentiation potential of these two rat MSC populations in vitro and in a model of acute necrotizing injury (ANI) induced by cryoinjury. Isolated BM-MSCs and AF-MSCs were characterized by flow cytometry and cytocentrifugation and their potential for osteogenic, adipogenic, and cardiovascular differentiation assayed in vitro using specific induction media. The left anterior ventricular wall of syngeneic Fisher 344 (n = 48) and athymic nude (rNu) rats (n = 6) was subjected to a limited, nontransmural epicardial ANI in the approximately one third of wall thickness without significant hemodynamic effects. The time window for in situ stem cell transplantation was established at day 7 postinjury. Fluorochrome (CMTMR)-labeled BM-MSCs (2 x 10(6)) or AF-MSCs (2 x 10(6)) were injected in syngeneic animals (n = 26) around the myocardial lesion via echocardiographic guidance. Reliability of CMTMR cell tracking in this context was ascertained by transplanting genetically labeled BM-MSCs or AF-MSCs, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), in rNu rats with ANI. Comparison between the two methods of cell tracking 30 days after cell transplantation gave slightly different values (1420,58 +/- 129,65 cells/mm2 for CMTMR labeling and 1613.18 +/- 643.84 cells/mm2 for genetic labeling; p = NS). One day after transplantation about one half CMTMR-labeled AF-MSCs engrafted to the injured heart (778.61 +/- 156.28 cells/mm2) in comparison with BM-MSCs (1434.50 +/- 173.80 cells/mm2, p < 0.01). Conversely, 30 days after cell transplantation survived MSCs were similar: 1275.26 +/- 74.51/mm2 (AF-MSCs) versus 1420.58 +/- 129.65/mm2 for BM-MSCs (p = NS). Apparent survival gain of AF-MSCs between the two time periods was motivated by the cell proliferation rate calculated at day 30, which was lower for BM-MSCs (6.79 +/- 0.48) than AF-MSCs (10.83 +/- 3.50; p < 0.01), in the face of a similar apoptotic index (4.68 +/- 0.20 for BM-MSCs and 4.16 +/- 0.58 for AF-MSCs; p = NS). These cells were also studied for their expression of markers specific for endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and cardiomyocytes (CMs) using von Willebrand factor (vWf), smooth muscle (SM) alpha-actin, and cardiac troponin T, respectively. Grafted BM-MSCs or AF-MSCs were found as single cell/small cell clusters or incorporated in the wall of microvessels.

{"title": "Studies on Feedback Control of Cardiac Alternans.", "abstract": "A beat-to-beat variation in the electric wave propagation morphology in myocardium is referred to as cardiac alternans and it has been linked to the onset of life threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Experimental studies have demonstrated that alternans can be annihilated by the feedback modulation of the basic pacing interval in a small piece of cardiac tissue. In this work, we study the capability of feedback control to suppress alternans both spatially and temporally in an extracted rabbit heart and in a cable of cardiac cells. This work demonstrates real-time control of cardiac alternans in an extracted rabbit heart and provides an analysis of the control methodology applied in the case of a one-dimensional (1D) cable of cardiac cells. The real-time system control is realized through feedback by proportional perturbation of the basic pacing cycle length (PCL). The measurements of the electric wave propagation are obtained by optical mapping of fluorescent dye from the surface of the heart and are fed into a custom-designed software that provides the control action signal that perturbs the basic pacing cycle length. In addition, a novel pacing protocol that avoids conduction block is applied. A numerical analysis, complementary to the experimental study is also carried out, by the ionic model of a 1D cable of cardiac cells under a self-referencing feedback protocol, which is identical to the one applied in the experimental study. Further, the amplitude of alternans linear parabolic PDE that is associated with the 1D ionic cardiac cell cable model under full state feedback control is analyzed. We provide an analysis of the amplitude of alternans parabolic PDE which admits a standard evolutionary form in a well defined functional space. Standard modal decomposition techniques are used in the analysis and the controller synthesis is carried out through pole-placement. State and output feedback controller realizations are developed and the important issue of measurement noise in the controller implementation is addressed. The analysis of stabilization of the amplitude of alternans PDE is in agreement with the experimental results and numerical results produced by the ionic 1D cable of cardiac cells model.

Cyclosporine A also causes a dose-related decrease in body functions in experimental animals and human beings. The generation of reactive oxygen species has been implicated in cyclosporine A-induced dysfunctions. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ellagic acid on cyclosporine A-induced alterations in the kidney, liver and heart oxidant/antioxidant system. The control group was treated with placebo and subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml isotonic saline + 0.5 ml slightly alkaline solution for 21 days. The cyclosporine A group received a subcutaneous injection of cyclosporine A (15 mg/kg) + 0.5 ml slightly alkaline solution for 21 days. The ellagic acid group was treated with a subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml isotonic saline + ellagic acid (10 mg/kg) for 21 days. The cyclosporine A plus ellagic acid group received a subcutaneous injection of cyclosporine A + ellagic acid for 21 days. Ellagic acid and slightly alkaline solution were administered by gavage. The rats were killed at the end of the treatment period. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activities were determined in kidney, liver and heart tissues. While administration of cyclosporine A increased the MDA levels in kidney, liver and heart tissues, it decreased the GSH, GSH-Px and CAT in these samples when compared to the control group. However, the simultaneously administration of ellagic acid markedly normalized the cyclosporine A-induced liver and heart MDA levels, liver CAT activities and GSH-Px activities of all samples. Cyclosporine A caused marked damages in the histopathological status of kidney, liver and heart tissues, which were partially ameliorated by ellagic acid administration.

{"title": "Mechanisms of myocyte cytotoxicity induced by the multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib.", "abstract": "The anticancer tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib has been shown recently to be cardiotoxic. Using a neonatal rat myocyte model, we investigated various mechanisms that might be responsible for its cardiotoxicity. Sunitinib potently inhibited the enzyme activity of both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the ribosomal S6 kinase RSK1 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Heart tissue with its high energy needs might be particularly sensitive to inhibition of AMPK because of its role as an energy sensor regulating ATP levels. As measured by lactate dehydrogenase release, sunitinib treatment of myocytes caused dose-dependent damage at therapeutic levels. Sunitinib treatment also caused a dose-dependent reduction in myocyte protein levels of the phosphorylated alpha and beta isoforms of the AMPK phosphorylation target acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase. However, myocytes were not protected from sunitinib treatment by pretreating them with the AMPK-activating antidiabetic drug metformin. Sunitinib treatment of myocytes also did not affect cellular ATP levels. Together, these last two results do not suggest a major role for inhibition of AMPK in sunitinib-induced myocyte damage. Dexrazoxane, which is a clinically approved doxorubicin cardioprotective agent, also did not protect myocytes from damage, which suggests that sunitinib did not induce oxidative damage. In conclusion, even though sunitinib potently inhibits AMPK and RSK1, given the extreme lack of kinase selectivity that sunitinib exhibits, it is likely that inhibition of other kinases or combinations of kinases are responsible for the cardiotoxic effects of sunitinib.", "journal": "Molecular pharmacology", "date": "2008-09-26", "authors": ["Brian BHasinoff", "DaywinPatel", "Kimberley AO'Hara"], "doi": "10.1124/mol.108.050104"}

The chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin associates poorly with LDE; the aim of this study was to clarify whether the derivatization of daunorubicin by the attachment of an oleyl group increases the association with LDE, and to test the cytotoxicity and animal toxicity of the new preparation. The association of oleyl-daunorubicin (oDNR) to LDE showed high yield (93 +/- 2% and 84 +/- 4% at 1:10 and 1:5 drug:lipid mass, respectively) and was stable for at least 20 days. Association with oDNR increased the LDE particle diameter from 42 +/- 4 nm to 75 +/- 6 nm. Cytotoxicity of LDE-oDNR was reduced two-fold in HL-60 and K-562 cell lines, fourteen-fold in B16 cells and nine-fold in L1210 cells when compared with commercial daunorubicin. When tested in mice, LDE-oDNR showed remarkable reduced toxicity (maximum tolerated dose > 253 micromol kg(-1), compared with <3 micromol kg(-1) for commercial daunorubicin). At high doses, the cardiac tissue of LDE-oDNR-treated animals had much smaller structural lesions than with commercial daunorubicin.

STS (3 mg/ml) was supplemented with drinking water for 6 weeks in the appropriate surgery groups after surgery.\nM-mode echocardiograms showed ventricular contractile dysfunction with reduced aortic blood flow in AVF mice, whereas STS treatment prevented the decline in cardiac function. Ventricular collagen, MMP-2 and -9, and TIMP-1 were robustly increased with a decreasing trend in adenylate cyclase VI expression; however, STS supplementation reversed these effects in AVF mice. Among 2 enzymes that produce endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) expression was attenuated in AVF mice with no changes in cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) expression. In addition, reduced production of H(2)S in AVF ventricular tissue was normalized with STS supplementation.

TIMP messenger RNA and protein expression, MMP gelatin zymography activity, and collagen fibrosis were measured in heart tissue.\nA threefold difference in the infarction area ratio was observed between samples of LVAs and of repaired LVAs. Compared with rats without LVAR, rats with repaired LVAs exhibited a higher percentage fractional shortening and significantly lower LV end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters. These salutary effects on LV diameter after LVAR were accompanied by a reversal of myocardial remodeling activity. After MI, TIMP expression decreased, MMP activity increased, and collagen fibrosis increased. After LVAR, TIMP expression increased, and MMP activity and collagen fibrosis decreased. These markers of remodeling activity changed significantly and approached preinfarct levels after LVAR.\nThis study demonstrated that postinfarct LVAR prevents further congestive heart failure by attenuating myocardial remodeling in the LV and is thus indicated both to prevent heart failure and to reduce excessive postinfarct myocardial remodeling.", "journal": "The Annals of thoracic surgery", "date": "2008-09-23", "authors": ["Chiao-PoHsu", "Chun-YaoHuang", "Jih-ShiuanWang", "Pi-ChiSun", "Chun-CheShih"], "doi": "10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.06.043"}

This cardiogenic mesoderm later differentiates into heart muscle tissue (myocardium) and non-muscular heart tissue. Inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is known to be required early for induction of cardiogenic mesoderm; however, the identity of the inhibiting Wnt signal itself is still elusive. We have identified Wnt6 in Xenopus as an endogenous Wnt signal, which is expressed in tissues close to and later inside the developing heart. Our loss-of-function experiments show that Wnt6 function is required in the embryo to prevent development of an abnormally large heart muscle. We find, however, that Wnt6 is not required as expected during gastrulation stages, but later during organogenesis stages just before cells of the cardiogenic mesoderm begin to differentiate into heart muscle (myocardium). Our gain-of-function experiments show that Wnt6 and also activated canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are capable of restricting heart muscle development at these relatively late stages of development. This repressive role of Wnt signaling is mediated initially via repression of cardiogenic transcription factors, since reinstatement of GATA function can rescue expression of other cardiogenic transcription factors and downstream cardiomyogenic differentiation genes.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2008-09-23", "authors": ["Danielle LLavery", "JenniferMartin", "Yvonne DTurnbull", "StefanHoppler"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.08.032"}

In previous in vitro experiments, we have demonstrated distinct effects of these DHP compounds to influence mitochondrial functioning. In the present in vivo experiments, DHP compounds were administered intraperitoneally in mice daily for 2 weeks, per se and in combinations with azidothymidine at doses: azidothymidine 50 mg/kg; cerebrocrast 0.1 mg/kg; glutapyrone 1 mg/kg; and tauropyrone 1 mg/kg. At the end of the experiment, mice were killed, heart and brain tissues were removed and examined ex vivo histopathologically and immunohistochemically. NF-kappaBp65 and caspase-3 were used as the markers indicating inflammatory and apoptotic events, respectively. Cerebrocrast (dicyclic structure) was the most potent DHP, which effectively reduced azidothymidine-induced overexpression of NF-kappaBp65 and caspase-3 in mouse myocardium and brain cortex. Glutapyrone per se increased the number of caspase-3-positive cells in the brain, whereas it reduced NF-kappaBp65 and caspase-3 expression in cardiac tissue caused by azidothymidine. Tauropyrone showed dual action: per se it increased caspase-3 in the brain and NF-kappaBp65 expression in the heart, but it considerably reduced these activations in azidothymidine-treated mice. This study provides the first demonstration of a distinct pharmacological action for atypical DHP compounds in cardiac and brain tissues.

One of the potential properties of N. sativa oil is the ability of one or more of its constituents to reduce toxicity due to its antioxidant activities. The antioxidant effects of N. sativa oil have been examined using different hepatic and kidney toxicity in in vivo murine models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of N. sativa oil in the antioxidant enzyme status and myocardium of cyclosporine-A-treated rats. This study included 24 male Wistar albino young healthy rats (8-12 weeks) weighing 150-200 g. The control group received sunflower oil (21 days, 2 ml/kg/day, orally) without any treatment.

Norepinephrine transporter protein (NET) and renalase protein expression in cardiac tissue from Nx pups were significantly lower than SH and PF. Our data suggest that early age Nx animals have increased circulating catecholamines due to decreased NE metabolism.

Because manganese ions (Mn(2+)) enter viable myocardial cells via voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, manganese-enhanced MRI is sensitive to the viability and inotropic state of the heart. In spite of the established importance of Ca(2+) regulation in the heart both before and after myocardial injury, monitoring strategies to assess Ca(2+) homeostasis in affected cardiac tissues are limited. This study implements a T(1)-mapping method to obtain quantitative information both dynamically and over a range of MnCl(2) infusion doses. To optimize the current Mn(2+) infusion protocols, we performed both dose-dependent and temporal washout studies. A non-linear relationship between infused MnCl(2) solution dose and increase in left ventricular wall relaxation rate (DeltaR(1)) was observed. Control mice also exhibited significant Mn(2+) clearance over time, with a decrease in DeltaR(1) of approximately 50% occurring in just 2.5 h.

The workshop strove to identify limitations in the use of data from nonhuman animal species for elucidation of human electromechanical function/activity and to identify what specific information on ion channel kinetics, calcium handling, and dynamic changes in the intracellular/extracellular milieu is needed from human cardiac tissues to develop more robust computational models of human cardiac electromechanical activity. This article summarizes the workshop discussions and recommendations on the following topics: (1) limitations of animal models and differences from human electrophysiology, (2) modeling ion channel structure/function in the context of whole-cell electrophysiology, (3) excitation-contraction coupling and regulatory pathways, (4) whole-heart simulations of human electromechanical activity, and (5) what human data are currently needed and how to obtain them.

{"title": "Superoxide and respiratory coupling in mitochondria of insulin-deficient diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species have been implicated in both diabetic complications and the progression of the underlying diabetic state. However, it is not clear whether mitochondria of diabetic origin are intrinsically altered to generate excess reactive oxygen species independent of the surrounding diabetic milieu. Mitochondria were isolated from gastrocnemius, heart, and liver of 2-wk and 2-month streptozotocin diabetic rats and controls. We rigidly quantified mitochondrial superoxide, respiration and ATP production, respiratory coupling, the expression of several proteins with antioxidant properties, and the redox state of glutathione. Both fluorescent assessment and electron paramagnetic spectroscopy revealed that superoxide production was unchanged or reduced in the 2-month diabetic mitochondria compared with controls. Kinetic analysis of the proton leak showed that diabetic heart and muscle mitochondria were actually more coupled compared with control despite an approximate 2- to 4-fold increase in uncoupling protein-3 content. Adenine nucleotide translocator type 1 expression was reduced by approximately 50% in diabetic muscle mitochondria. Catalase was significantly up-regulated in muscle and heart tissue and in heart mitochondria, whereas glutathione peroxidase expression was increased in liver mitochondria of diabetic rats. We conclude that gastrocnemius, heart, and liver mitochondria of streptozotocin diabetic rats are not irrevocably altered toward excess superoxide production either by complex I or complex III. Moreover, gastrocnemius and heart mitochondria demonstrate increased, not decreased, respiratory coupling. Mitochondria of insulin-deficient diabetic rats do show signs of adaptation to antecedent oxidative stress manifested as tissue-specific enzyme and uncoupling protein expression but remain remarkably robust with respect to superoxide production.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2008-09-06", "authors": ["Judith AHerlein", "Brian DFink", "YunxiaO'Malley", "William ISivitz"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2008-0404"}

Over-expression of this enzyme in adipose tissue could determine an increase in available cortisol that interacts with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in renal, brain and heart tissue, leading to similar hypertensive effects as in 11betaHSD2 impaired patients.

Statistical associations were evaluated by Pearson correlations and the genetic equilibrium by the Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equation.\nWe found all three polymorphisms in the EH and the NT group, both in genetic equilibrium.

Fish were instrumented with a blood flow probe around the ventral aorta and catheters in the dorsal aorta and sinus venosus. Water temperature was progressively increased from 13 degrees C in steps of 4 degrees C up to 25 degrees C. Cardiac output increased from 29 to 56 ml.min(-1).kg(-1) between 13 and 25 degrees C through an increase in heart rate (58 to 105 beats/min). Systemic vascular resistance was reduced, causing a stable dorsal aortic blood pressure, yet central venous blood pressure increased significantly at 25 degrees C. Oxygen consumption rate increased from 3.4 to 8.7 mg.min(-1).kg(-1) during the temperature increase, although there were signs of anaerobic respiration at 25 degrees C in the form of increased blood lactate and decreased pH. Arterial oxygen partial pressure was maintained during the heat stress, although venous oxygen partial pressure (Pv(O(2))) and venous oxygen content were significantly reduced. Cardiac arrhythmias were prominent in three of the largest fish (>4 kg) at 25 degrees C. Given the switch to anaerobic metabolism and the observation of cardiac arrhythmias at 25 degrees C, we propose that the cascade of venous oxygen depletion results in a threshold value for Pv(O(2)) of around 1 kPa. At this point, the oxygen supply to systemic and cardiac tissues is compromised, such that the oxygen-deprived and acidotic myocardium becomes arrhythmic, and blood perfusion through the gills and to the tissues becomes compromised.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Investigating cardiac alternans may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias and eventually better algorithms for the prediction and prevention of such dreadful diseases. In paced cardiac tissue, alternans develops under increasingly shorter pacing period. Existing experimental and theoretical studies adopt the assumption that alternans in homogeneous cardiac tissue is exclusively determined by the pacing period. In contrast, we find that, when calcium-driven alternans develops in cardiac fibers, it may take different spatiotemporal patterns depending on the pacing history. Because there coexist multiple alternans solutions for a given pacing period, the alternans pattern on a fiber becomes unpredictable. Using numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we show that the coexistence of multiple alternans patterns is induced by the interaction between electrotonic coupling and an instability in calcium cycling.", "journal": "Physical review.

Growth is regarded as a deformation that is decomposed into a plastic component which describes unconstrained growth and an elastic component to satisfy continuity of the tissue after growth. In current growth models, a single reference configuration is used that remains fixed throughout the entire growth process. However, considering continuous turnover to occur together with growth, such a fixed reference is unlikely to exist in reality. Therefore, we investigated the effect of tissue turnover on growth by incrementally updating the reference configuration. With both a fixed reference and an updated reference, strain-induced cardiac growth in magnitude of 30% could be simulated. However, with an updated reference, the amplitude of the stimulus for growth decreased over time, whereas with a fixed reference this amplitude increased.

We therefore sought to determine whether deletions of iNOS or eNOS genes in mice modulate pressor responses to endothelin and the expression of ETA and ETB receptors in a similar fashion. Despite unchanged baseline hemodynamic parameters, anesthetized iNOS-/- mice displayed reduced pressor responses to endothelin-1, but not to that of IRL-1620, a selective ETB agonist. Protein content of cardiac ETA receptors was reduced in iNOS-/- mice compared with wild-type mice, but that of ETB receptors was unchanged. Anesthetized eNOS-/- mice presented a hypertensive state, accompanied by an enhanced pressor response to intravenous endothelin-1, whereas the pressor response to IRL-1620 was reduced. Protein levels were also found to be increased for ETA receptors, but reduced for ETB receptors, in cardiac tissues of eNOS-/- mice. In conscious animals, both strains responded equally to the hypotensive effect of an ETA antagonist, ABT-627, whereas orally administered A-192621, an ETB antagonist, increased MAP to a greater extent in eNOS-/- than in wild-type mice. Furthermore, significant levels of immunoreactive endothelin were found in mesenteric arteries in eNOS-/- but not in iNOS-/- or wild-type congeners. Our study shows that repression of iNOS or eNOS has differential effects on endothelin-1 and its receptors.

{"title": "Cardiac glycogen accumulation after dexamethasone is regulated by AMPK.", "abstract": "Glycogen is an immediate source of glucose for cardiac tissue to maintain its metabolic homeostasis. However, its excess brings about cardiac structural and physiological impairments. Previously, we have demonstrated that in hearts from dexamethasone (Dex)-treated animals, glycogen accumulation was enhanced. We examined the influence of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on glucose entry and glycogen synthase as a means of regulating the accumulation of this stored polysaccharide. After Dex, cardiac tissue had a limited contribution toward the development of whole body insulin resistance. Measurement of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) at the plasma membrane revealed an excess presence of this transporter protein at this location. Interestingly, this was accompanied by an increase in GLUT4 in the intracellular membrane fraction, an effect that was well correlated with increased GLUT4 mRNA. Both total and phosphorylated AMPK increased after Dex. Immunoprecipitation of Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) followed by Western blot analysis demonstrated no change in Akt phosphorylation at Ser(473) and Thr(308) in Dex-treated hearts. However, there was a significant increase in AMPK phosphorylation at Thr(172), which correlated well with AS160 phosphorylation. In Dex-treated hearts, there was a considerable reduction in the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, whereas glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta phosphorylation was augmented. Our data suggest that AMPK-mediated glucose entry combined with the activation of glycogen synthase and a reduction in glucose oxidation (Qi et al., Diabetes 53: 1790-1797, 2004) act together to promote glycogen storage. Should these effects persist chronically in the heart, they may explain the increased morbidity and mortality observed with long-term excesses in endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Endothelial progenitor cells in neovascularization of infarcted myocardium.", "abstract": "Historically, revascularization of ischemic tissue was believed to occur through the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in nearby tissues; however, evidence accumulated in recent years indicates that a subpopulation of adult, peripheral-blood cells, collectively referred to as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), can differentiate into mature endothelial cells. After ischemic insult, EPCs are believed to home to sites of neovascularization, where they contribute to vascular regeneration by forming a structural component of capillaries and by secreting angiogenic factors; new evidence indicates that EPCs can also differentiate into cardiomyocytes and smooth-muscle cells. These insights into the molecular and cellular processes of tissue formation suggest that cardiac function may be preserved after myocardial infarction by transplanting EPCs into ischemic heart tissue, thereby enhancing vascular and myocardial recovery. This therapeutic strategy has been effective in animal models of ischemic disorders, and results from randomized clinical trials suggest that cell-based strategies may be safe and feasible for treatment of myocardial infarction in humans and have provided early evidence of efficacy. However, the scarcity of EPCs in the peripheral blood and evidence that several disease states reduce EPC number and/or function have prompted the development of several strategies to overcome these limitations, such as the administration of genetically modified EPCs that overexpress angiogenic growth factors. To optimize therapeutic outcomes, researchers must continue to refine methods of EPC purification, expansion, and administration, and to develop techniques that overcome the intrinsic scarcity and phenotypic deficiencies of EPCs.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2008-08-30", "authors": ["KentaroJujo", "MasaakiIi", "Douglas WLosordo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.08.003"}

BTB containing proteins play important roles in a variety of cellular functions including regulation of transcription, regulation of the cytoskeleton, protein ubiquitination, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel human gene, KLHL31, from a human embryonic heart cDNA library. The cDNA of KLHL31 is 5743 bp long, encoding a protein product of 634 amino acids containing a BTB domain. The protein is highly conserved across different species. Western blot analysis indicates that the KLHL31 protein is abundantly expressed in both embryonic skeletal and heart tissue. In COS-7 cells, KLHL31 proteins are localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In primary cultures of nascent mouse cardiomyocytes, the majority of endogenous KLHL31 proteins are localized to the cytoplasm. KLHL31 acts as a transcription repressor when fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain and deletion analysis indicates that the BTB domain is the main region responsible for this repression. Overexpression of KLHL31 in COS-7 cells inhibits the transcriptional activities of both the TPA-response element (TRE) and serum response element (SRE). KLHL31 also significantly reduces JNK activation leading to decreased phosphorylation and protein levels of the JNK target c-Jun in both COS-7 and Hela cells.

It exhibits a bimodal subcellular distribution, accumulating at actin-based filaments in the cytosol and in the nucleus. In order to analyze the function of CRP2 in vivo, we disrupted the Csrp2 gene in mice and analysed the resulting phenotype.\nA approximately 17.3 kbp fragment of the murine Csrp2 gene containing exon 3 through 6 was isolated. Using this construct we confirmed the recently determined chromosomal localization (Chromosome 10, best fit location between markers D10Mit203 proximal and D10Mit150 central). A gene disruption cassette was cloned into exon 4 and a mouse strain lacking functional Csrp2 was generated. Mice lacking CRP2 are viable and fertile and have no obvious deficits in reproduction and survival. However, detailed histological and electron microscopic studies reveal that CRP2-deficient mice have subtle alterations in their cardiac ultrastructure. In these mice, the cardiomyocytes display a slight increase in their thickness, indicating moderate hypertrophy at the cellular level. Although the expression of several intercalated disc-associated proteins such as beta-catenin, N-RAP and connexin-43 were not affected in these mice, the distribution of respective proteins was changed within heart tissue.\nWe conclude that the lack of CRP2 is associated with alterations in cardiomyocyte thickness and hypertrophy.", "journal": "BMC developmental biology", "date": "2008-08-21", "authors": ["Julia FSagave", "MarkusMoser", "ElisabethEhler", "SabineWeiskirchen", "DorisStoll", "KalleG\u00fcnther", "ReinhardB\u00fcttner", "RalfWeiskirchen"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-213X-8-80\n10.1002/bies.10226\n10.1093/nar/18.13.3871\n10.1016/0092-8674(94)90192-9\n10.1128/MCB.21.24.8592-8604.2001\n10.1074/jbc.272.43.27484\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81878-4\n10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00396-9\n10.1042/0264-6021:3590485\n10.1074/jbc.273.36.23233\n10.1021/bi982036y\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000056522.82563.5F\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01226-6\n10.1074/jbc.271.7.3667\n10.1073/pnas.0605635103\n10.1161/01.RES.0000194331.76925.5c\n10.1101/gr.858103\n10.1006/geno.1997.4855\n10.1083/jcb.153.4.763\n10.1083/jcb.139.1.157\n10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01451-0\n10.1074/jbc.270.48.28946\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-4061\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90508-A\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90507-9\n10.1016/S0003-2697(02)00627-9\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199903)214:3<229::AID-AJA6>3.0.CO;2-S\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.3187\n10.1074/jbc.273.17.10530\n10.1242/jcs.01159\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(1997)38:1<75::AID-CM7>3.0.CO;2-G\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(200002)45:2<149::AID-CM6>3.0.CO;2-G\n10.1016/j.jhep.2005.07.008"}

{"title": "Nitric oxide triggers delayed anesthetic preconditioning-induced cardiac protection via activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase.", "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role both in triggering and mediating delayed protection against myocardial I/R injury during anesthetic-induced preconditioning (APC). However, the signaling mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain unclear. Using isoflurane as a representative anesthetic, the present study tested the hypothesis that NO released after anesthetic-induced preconditioning initiates delayed cardioprotection via activation of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), leading to myocardial adaptation by upregulation of iNOS and increase in production of NO. Sprague-Dawley rats that received open-chest surgery under pentobarbital anesthesia were subject to 30 min of left coronary artery occlusion, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Exposure to 60 min of 2.1% isoflurane inhalation with oxygen 24 h before ischemia significantly reduced I/R-induced myocardial infarct size that was associated with overexpression of iNOS protein and increased NO content in the heart. These protective effects were abolished by pretreatment with a NOS inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an NF-kappaB blocker, diethyldithiocarbamate, before isoflurane, or a selective iNOS inhibitor, S-methylisothiourea, before left coronary artery occlusion. Isoflurane exposure also evoked a robust increase in myocardial NO content, followed by nucleus-bound translocation of p65 or p50 subunit of NF-kappaB and increase in NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in heart tissues. These molecular events after isoflurane exposure were blocked by pretreatment with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. We conclude that NO generated immediately after isoflurane exposure triggers downstream activation of NF-kappaB, resulting in subsequent upregulation of iNOS expression and NO synthesis that mediate APC-induced delayed cardioprotection.", "journal": "Shock (Augusta, Ga.)", "date": "2008-08-19", "authors": ["Chen HsiuChen", "Jiin HaurChuang", "KangLiu", "Julie Y HChan"], "doi": "10.1097/SHK.0b013e318162ad19"}

Exposure to high concentrations of Cl(2) results in acute lung injury that may either resolve spontaneously or progress to acute respiratory failure. Presently, the pathophysiological sequelae associated with Cl(2)-induced acute lung injury in conscious animals, as well as the cellular and biochemical mechanisms involved, have not been elucidated. We exposed conscious Sprague-Dawley rats to Cl(2) gas (184 or 400 ppm) for 30 min in environmental chambers and then returned them to room air. At 1 h after exposure, rats showed evidence of arterial hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, increased levels of albumin, IgG, and IgM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), increased BALF surfactant surface tension, and significant histological injury to airway and alveolar epithelia. These changes were more pronounced in the 400-ppm-exposed rats. Concomitant decreases of ascorbate (AA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were also detected in both BALF and lung tissues. In contrast, heart tissue AA and GSH content remained unchanged. These abnormalities persisted 24 h after exposure in rats exposed to 400 ppm Cl(2). Rats injected systemically with a mixture of AA, deferoxamine, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine before exposure to 184 ppm Cl(2) had normal levels of AA, lower levels of BALF albumin and normal arterial Po(2) and Pco(2) values.

After that, coronary capillary density and coronary vessel permeability were measured. The serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was also measured before and after the treatment. The results indicate that coronary capillary density (number of capillary per square millimetre) and coronary vessel permeability (fluorescence intensity) were significantly higher in the oestrogen-treated group than in the control group (628 +/- 26 per mm(2) versus 540 +/- 26 per mm(2); P < 0.05 and 207 +/- 10 versus 147 +/- 19 per gram tissue; P < 0.05).

A pair-wise log analysis showed a strong positive correlation in the heart-versus-blood (but not other tissues) levels of oxidative stress markers (malonyldialdehyde, glutathione disulfide), antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, MnSOD, catalase), and mitochondrial inhibition of respiratory complexes (CI/CIII) in infected mice. T. cruzi-induced acute inflammatory and oxidative responses are widespread in different muscle tissues. Antioxidant/oxidant status and mitochondrial function are consistently attenuated in the heart, and reflected in the peripheral-blood of T. cruzi-infected mice. Our results provide an impetus to investigate the peripheral-blood oxidative responses in relation to clinical severity of heart disease in chagasic human patients.", "journal": "Microbes and infection", "date": "2008-08-05", "authors": ["Jian-JunWen", "MonishaDhiman", "Elbert BWhorton", "Nisha JainGarg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micinf.2008.06.013"}

Strategies to restore and control the electrophysiological activity of the heart may, therefore, greatly affect the regeneration of cardiac tissue functionality. Using lentivirus-derived particles to regulate the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) gene expression in a pristinamycin- or gaseous acetaldehyde-inducible manner, we demonstrated the adjustment of cardiomyocyte electrophysiological characteristics. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs) were used to monitor the electrophysiological activity of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCs) cultured as monolayers (NRCml) or as microtissues (NRCmt). NRCmt more closely resembled heart tissue physiology than did NRCml and could be conveniently monitored using HD-MEAs because of their ability to detect low-signal events and to sub-select the region of interest, namely, areas where the microtissues were placed. Cardiomyocyte-forming microtissues, transduced using lentiviral vectors encoding BMP-2, were capable of restoring myocardial microtissue electrical activity. We also engineered NRCmt to functionally couple within a cardiomyocyte monolayer, thus showing pacemaker-like activity upon local regulation of transgenic BMP-2 expression.

In this study, the rat cardiac proteins were incubated in vitro with S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a biologically existing nitric oxide (NO) donor and S-nitrosating agent, to induce protein S-nitrosylation, and the resulting S-nitrosylated proteins were purified by the biotin switch method, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) separation and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) identification. Candidate Western blot analysis was also used to identify potential S-nitrosylated proteins. A total of ten proteins including triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, adenylate kinase 1 (AK1), enolase 1, destrin, actin, myosin, albumin and Hsp27 were unambiguously identified, among which AK1 was found as a novel target of S-nitrosylation. Further studies showed that AK1 activity in the rat heart extracts was significantly inhibited by GSNO but not oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and the inhibition was completely reversed by dithiothreitol (DTT) post-treatment, demonstrating that S-nitrosylation might serve as a new regulatory mechanism in controlling AK1 activity.

A case in point is human dilated cardiomyopathy 10 (CMD10; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man #608569), a progressive organ dysfunction syndrome refractory to conventional therapies and linked to mutations in cardiac ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel subunits. Embryonic stem cell therapy demonstrates benefit in ischemic heart disease, but the reparative capacity of this allogeneic regenerative cell source has not been tested in inherited cardiomyopathy. Here, in a Kir6.2-knockout model lacking functional K(ATP) channels, we recapitulated under the imposed stress of pressure overload the gene-environment substrate of CMD10. Salient features of the human malignant heart failure phenotype were reproduced, including compromised contractility, ventricular dilatation, and poor survival. Embryonic stem cells were delivered through the epicardial route into the left ventricular wall of cardiomyopathic stressed Kir6.2-null mutants. At 1 month of therapy, transplantation of 200,000 cells per heart achieved teratoma-free reversal of systolic dysfunction and electrical synchronization and halted maladaptive remodeling, thereby preventing end-stage organ failure. Tracked using the lacZ reporter transgene, stem cells engrafted into host heart. Beyond formation of cardiac tissue positive for Kir6.2, transplantation induced cell cycle activation and halved fibrotic zones, normalizing sarcomeric and gap junction organization within remuscularized hearts. Improved systemic function induced by stem cell therapy translated into increased stamina, absence of anasarca, and benefit to overall survivorship. Embryonic stem cells thus achieve functional repair in nonischemic genetic cardiomyopathy, expanding indications to the therapy of heritable heart failure.

The authors aimed at investigating histological changes of the heart, lung, liver and kidneys in a stable and reproducible animal model of chronic heart failure in sheep.\nIn 8 sheep (N.=8, 77+/-2 kg) chronic heart failure was induced by multiple sequential microembolization through bolus injection of polysterol microspheres (90 microm, N=25 000) into the left main coronary artery. Microembolization (ME) was repeated up to three times in two to three week intervals until animals started to develop stable signs of heart failure. Therefore, clinical and hemodynamic parameters were measured (Troponin T, heart and respiratory rate, cardiac output) after each embolization. Clinical examination was carried out by a veterinarian. All animals were followed for 3 months after first microembolization and then euthanized for histological examination. Histological data of the heart, lung, liver and the kidneys were analyzed in hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stains (10x, 25x, 100x) at baseline (control group) and at 3 months after first ME. Additionally preparations of heart tissue were stained with Picro-Sirius-Red (PSR) for planimetric quantification. A score from 0 to 4 according to Rassler et al. (2005) was used to assess the degree of lung injury.\nAll animals developed histological signs of heart failure as indicated by island-like, patchy fibrosis of the heart. Planimetric quantification (PSR stain) of the heart revealed a significant increase of the total amount of fibrosis from 8+/-2% (base) to 21+/-4% (3 months) (P<0.05), which was distributed homogeneously throughout the left ventricle (20+/-3% left ventricular [LV] anterior wall, 21+/-4% LV posterior wall, 20+/-4% septum). Histologic analysis of the lung demonstrated a moderate degree of interstitial edema and pronounced peribronchial processes of inflammation with beginning proliferation of fibrotic tissue. Liver tissue showed histological changes in terms of pericentral adiposis as sign of hypoxia in course of lacking perfusion. Signs of liver congestion could be detected histological in form of central-venous accumulation of erythrocytes and dissolution of liver tissue in proximity of the central veins. Kidney preparations illustrated loss of endothelial function and vascular occlusions, caused by microspheres, with decline of renal parenchyma particularly of the tubules.\nMultiple sequential intracoronary microembolization can effectively induce myocardial dysfunction with histological signs of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and pathological changes of lung, liver and kidney, which can directly be coursed by chronic heart failure.

{"title": "Novel polymer carriers and gene constructs for treatment of myocardial ischemia and infarction.", "abstract": "The number one cause of mortality in the US is cardiovascular related disease. Future predictions do not see a reduction in this rate especially with the continued rise in obesity [P. Poirier, et al., Obesity and cardiovascular disease: pathophysiology, evaluation, and effect of weight loss, Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 26(5), (2006) 968-976.; K. Obunai, S. Jani, G.D. Dangas, Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of the metabolic syndrome, Med.Clin. North Am., 91(6), (2007) 1169-1184]. Even so, potential molecular therapeutic targets for cardiac gene delivery are in no short supply thanks to continuing advances in molecular cardiology. However, efficient and safe delivery remains a bottleneck in clinical gene therapy [O.J. Muller, H.A. Katus, R. Bekeredjian, Targeting the heart with gene therapy-optimized gene delivery methods, Cardiovasc Res, 73(3), (2007) 453-462]. Viral vectors are looked upon favorably for their high transduction efficiency, although their ability to elicit toxic immune responses remains [C.F. McTiernan, et al., Myocarditis following adeno-associated viral gene expression of human soluble TNF receptor (TNFRII-Fc) in baboon hearts, Gene Ther, 14(23), (2007) 1613-1622]. However, this high transduction does not necessarily translate into improved efficacy [X. Hao, et al., Myocardial angiogenesis after plasmid or adenoviral VEGF-A(165) gene transfer in rat myocardial infarction model, Cardiovasc Res., 73(3), (2007) 481-487]. Naked DNA remains the preferred method of DNA delivery to cardiac myocardium and has been explored extensively in clinical trials. The results from these trials have demonstrated efficacy in regard to secondary end-points of reduced symptomatology and perfusion, but have failed to establish significant angiogenesis or an increase in myocardial function [P.B. Shah, D.W. Losordo, Non-viral vectors for gene therapy: clinical trials in cardiovascular disease, Adv Genet, 54, (2005) 339-361]. This may be due in part to reduced transfection efficiency but can also be attributed to use of suboptimal candidate genes. Currently, polymeric non-viral gene delivery to cardiac myocardium remains underrepresented. In the past decade several advances in non-viral vector development has demonstrated increased transfection efficiency [O.J. Muller, H.A. Katus, R. Bekeredjian, Targeting the heart with gene therapy-optimized gene delivery methods, Cardiovasc Res, 73(3), (2007) 453-462]. Of these polymers, those that employ lipid modifications to improve transfection or target cardiovascular tissues have proven themselves to be extremely beneficial. Water-soluble lipopolymer (WSLP) consists of a low molecular weight branched PEI (1800) and cholesterol. The cholesterol moiety adds extra condensation by forming stable micellular complexes and was later employed for myocardial gene therapy to exploit the high expression of lipoprotein lipase found within cardiac tissue. Use of WSLP to deliver hypoxia-responsive driven expression of hVEGF to ischemic rabbit myocardium has proven to provide for even better expression in cardiovascular cells than Terplex and has demonstrated a significant reduction in infarct size (13+/-4%, p<0.001) over constitutive VEGF expression (32+/-7%, p=0.007) and sham-injected controls (48+/-7%). A significant reduction in apoptotic values and an increase in capillary growth were also seen in surrounding tissue. Recently, investigations have begun using bioreducible polymers made of poly(amido polyethylenimines) (SS-PAEI). SS-PAEIs breakdown within the cytoplasm through inherent redox mechanisms and provide for high transfection efficiencies (upwards to 60% in cardiovascular cell types) with little to no demonstrable toxicity. In vivo transfections in normoxic and hypoxic rabbit myocardium have proven to exceed those results of WSLP transfections by 2-5 fold [L.V. Christensen, et al., Reducible poly(amido ethylenediamine) for hypoxia-inducible VEGF delivery, J Control Release, 118(2), (2007) 254-261]. This new breed of polymer(s) may allow for decreased doses and use of new molecular mechanisms not previously available due to low transfection efficiencies. Little development has been seen in the use of new gene agents for treatment of myocardial ischemia and infarction. Current treatment consists of using mitogenic factors, described decades earlier, alone or in combination to spur angiogenesis or modulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis through SERCA2a but to date, failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is important for resistance to acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection; however, in patients suffering from chronic T. cruzi infection, plasma TNF-alpha levels correlate with cardiomyopathy. Recent data suggest that CD8-enriched chagasic myocarditis formation involves CCR1/CCR5-mediated cell migration. Herein, the contribution of TNF-alpha, especially signaling through the receptor TNFR1/p55, to the pathophysiology of T. cruzi infection was evaluated with a focus on the development of myocarditis and heart dysfunction. Colombian strain-infected C57BL/6 mice had increased frequencies of TNFR1/p55+ and TNF-alpha+ splenocytes. Although TNFR1-/- mice exhibited reduced myocarditis in the absence of parasite burden, they succumbed to acute infection. Similar to C57BL/6 mice, Benznidazole-treated TNFR1-/- mice survived acute infection. In TNFR1-/- mice, reduced CD8-enriched myocarditis was associated with defective activation of CD44+CD62Llow/- and CCR5+ CD8+ lymphocytes. Also, anti-TNF-alpha treatment reduced the frequency of CD8+CCR5+ circulating cells and myocarditis, though parasite load was unaltered in infected C3H/HeJ mice. TNFR1-/- and anti-TNF-alpha-treated infected mice showed regular expression of connexin-43 and reduced fibronectin deposition, respectively. Furthermore, anti-TNF-alpha treatment resulted in lower levels of CK-MB, a cardiomyocyte lesion marker.

Estrogen and the estrogen receptors (ER) appear to play a critical role in cardiovascular gender differences, given that females have improved myocardial functional recovery associated with decreased tissue inflammation. It has been suggested that ER beta plays a part in decreasing myocardial inflammation following hemorrhage. It remains unknown, however, whether ER beta also may be protective following the more severe insult of complete global, normothermic ischemia/reperfusion injury in the isolated mouse heart.\nAdult male and female wild-type (WT) and ER beta knockout (ERbKO) mouse hearts were subjected to 20 minutes ischemia and 60 minutes reperfusion (Langendorff model). Myocardial contractile function (+/-dP/dt) was continuously recorded. Heart tissue was analyzed for tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-10 levels as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nFemales had markedly improved functional recovery compared with males following ischemia/reperfusion. This recovery was associated with lower levels of myocardial tumor necrosis factor, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in females. However, ERbKO females exhibited significantly less postischemic functional recovery than WT females and were similar to WT males. Interestingly, increased myocardial production of tumor necrosis factor, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 was noted in ERbKO female hearts in response to ischemia/reperfusion. No significant differences were found between male WT and male ERbKO in postischemic functional recovery and proinflammatory cytokine production.\nER beta plays a role in the protective effects of estrogen following global, warm ischemia/reperfusion of the isolated mouse heart.

{"title": "Spatial-temporal filter effect in a computer model study of ventricular fibrillation.", "abstract": "Prediction of countershock success from ventricular fibrillation (VF) ECG is a major challenge in critical care medicine. Recent findings indicate that stable, high frequency mother rotors are one possible mechanism maintaining VF. A computer model study was performed to investigate how epicardiac sources are reflected in the ECG. In the cardiac tissues of two computer models - a model with cubic geometry and a simplified torso model with a left ventricle - a mother rotor was induced by increasing the potassium rectifier current. On the epicardium, the dominant frequency (DF) map revealed a constant DF of 23 Hz (cubic model) and 24.4 Hz (torso model) in the region of the mother rotor, respectively. A sharp drop of frequency (3-18 Hz in the cubic model and 12.4-18 Hz in the torso model) occurred in the surrounding epicardial tissue of chaotic fibrillatory conduction. While no organized pattern was observable on the body surface of the cubic model, the mother rotor frequency can be identified in the anterior surface of the torso model because of the chosen position of the mother rotor in the ventricle (shortest distance to the body surface). Nevertheless, the DFs were damped on the body surfaces of both models (4.6-8.5 Hz in the cubic model and 14.4-16.4 Hz in the torso model). Thus, it was shown in this computer model study that wave propagation transforms the spatial low pass filtering of the thorax into a temporal low pass. In contrast to the resistive-capacitive low pass filter formed by the tissue, this spatial-temporal low pass filter becomes effective at low frequencies (tens of Hertz). This effect damps the high frequency components arising from the heart and it hampers a direct observation of rapid, organized sources of VF in the ECGs, when in an emergency case an artifact-free recording is not possible.", "journal": "Biomedizinische Technik.

RH-237 and Rhod-2 fluorescent dyes were used to measure V(m) and [Ca(2+)](i), respectively. The S1-S2 interval ranged from 10 to 170 ms to examine stimulation during the action potential.\nThe [Ca(2+)](i) deflections were less pronounced than changes in V(m) for all S1-S2 intervals. For cathodal stimulation, [Ca(2+)](i) at the central virtual cathode region increased with prolongation of S1-S2 interval. For anodal stimulation, [Ca(2+)](i) at the central virtual anode area decreased with shortening of the S1-S2 interval. At very short S1-S2 intervals (10-20 ms), when S2 polarization was superimposed on the S1 action potential upstroke, the [Ca(2+)](i) distribution did not follow V(m) and produced a more complex pattern. After S2 termination [Ca(2+)](i) exhibited three outcomes in a manner similar to V(m): non-propagating response, break stimulation, and make stimulation.\nChanges in the [Ca(2+)](i) distribution correlate with the behavior of the V (m) distribution for S1-S2 coupling intervals longer than 20 ms; at shorter intervals S2 creates more heterogeneous [Ca(2+)](i) distribution in comparison with V(m). Stimulation in diastole and at very short coupling intervals caused V(m)-[Ca(2+)](i) uncoupling at the regions of positive polarization (virtual cathode).", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2008-07-22", "authors": ["Veniamin YSidorov", "Mark RHolcomb", "Marcella CWoods", "Richard AGray", "John PWikswo"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-008-0740-1"}

Cholinergic signs (fatigue, tremor, cyanosis, hyper-secretion, fasciculations) were observed in all the rats in the dichlorvos group and the mortality rate was 50%. No cholinergic findings and deaths were observed in the control and Y-27632 groups. Plasma cholinesterase activities were suppressed with dichlorvos and these reductions were attenuated with Y-27632 pretreatment. There was a marked increase in plasma malondialdehyde level in the dichlorvos group, but Y-27632 pretreatment abolished this elevation. Dichlorvos markedly depressed cardiac paraoxonase activity, but these changes were not markedly modified with Y-27632. Total antioxidant capacities, total oxidant status, oxidative stress index, total free sulfhydryl groups and catalase activities in plasma and cardiac tissues were not markedly different between the groups. No significant changes were observed with cardiac myeloperoxidase activities or plasma arylesterase and ceruloplasmin activities.

To explain this mechanism, an experimental study has quantified that the bone marrow cell transplantation decreases the number of inflammatory cells and reduces the fibrosis area in chagasic mice. Using this experimental data, we have developed an agent-based computational model to investigate the regeneration of the chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy after bone marrow stem cell transplantation.\nOur model includes six different types of agents: inflammatory cell, fibrosis area, cardiomyocyte, proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and bone marrow stem cell. This latter promotes apoptosis in inflammatory cells, reduction in the fibrosis area and can differentiate into cardiomyocyte. Proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha can increase the fibrosis area and T.cruzi can increase the number of inflammatory cells. Our results for both apoptosis of inflammatory cells and reduction in the fibrosis area were compared with experimental data. They suggest that the concentration pattern is the most important factor to characterize the kinetics of cardiac tissue regeneration after bone marrow stem cell transplantation.\nThe source code of our software is available online at www.vivas.ufba.br/bone/bone.zip .br Supplementaty information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "journal": "Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)", "date": "2008-07-19", "authors": ["VivianeGalv\u00e3o", "Jos\u00e9 Garcia VivasMiranda", "RicardoRibeiro-dos-Santos"], "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btn362"}

After 24 h, doxorubicin upregulated p53 mRNA expression, disturbed Bcl-2 family protein balance, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, precipitated mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic signalling, induced apoptotic cell death, and reduced viability of cardiomyocytes, whereas EGb761 pretreatment suppressed all the actions of doxorubicin. Similarly, rats treated with doxorubicin [3 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) three doses every other day] displayed retarded growth of body and heart as well as elevated apoptotic indexes in heart tissue at both 7 and 28 days after exposure, whereas EGb761 pretreatment (5 mg/kg i.p. 1 day before each dose of doxorubicin) effectively neutralized the aforementioned gross and cellular adverse effects of doxorubicin.\nDoxorubicin impairs viability of cardiomyocytes at least partially by activating the p53-mediated, mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic signalling.

Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue. In DOX B1R(-/-) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state.

We expanded a specific population of bone marrow-derived prominin-1-expressing progenitor cells (PPC) from healthy heart tissue, analysed their plasticity, and evaluated their capacity to protect mice from EAM and heart failure.\nPPC were expanded from healthy mouse hearts. Analysis of CD45.1/CD45.2 chimera mice confirmed bone marrow origin of PPC. Depending on in vitro culture conditions, PPC differentiated into macrophages, dendritic cells, or cardiomyocyte-like cells. In vivo, PPC acquired a cardiac phenotype after direct injection into healthy hearts. Intravenous injection of PPC into myosin alpha heavy chain/complete Freund's adjuvant (MyHC-alpha/CFA)-immunized BALB/c mice resulted in heart-specific homing and differentiation into the macrophage phenotype. Histology revealed reduced severity scores for PPC-treated mice compared with control animals [treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or crude bone marrow at day 21 after MyHC-alpha/CFA immunization]. Echocardiography showed preserved fractional shortening and velocity of circumferential shortening in PPC but not PBS-treated MyHC-alpha/CFA-immunized mice.

Freshwater (FW)-reared sturgeon were gradually acclimated to salinities representing FW, estuary water (EST), or San Francisco Bay water (BAY) at 18 degrees C, and their critical thermal maximum (CTMax) was measured by increasing temperature 0.3 degrees C/min until branchial ventilation ceased. CTMax was 34.2+/-0.09 degrees C in EST-acclimated fish, with FW- and BAY-acclimated fish CTMax at 33.7+/-0.08 and 33.7+/-0.1 degrees C, respectively. Despite the higher CTMax in EST-acclimated fish, FW-acclimated sturgeon ventilation rate reached a peak that was 2 degrees C higher than EST- and BAY-acclimated groups and had a greater range of temperatures within which they exhibited normal ventilatory function as assessed by Q10 calculation. The osmoregulatory consequences of exposure to near-lethal temperatures were assessed by measuring plasma osmolality and hematocrit, as well as white muscle, brain, and heart tissue water contents. Hematocrit was increased following CTMax exposure, most likely owing to the elevated metabolic demands of temperature increase, and plasma osmolality was significantly increased in EST- and BAY-acclimated fish, which was likely the result of a greater osmotic gradient across the gill as metabolism increased.

{"title": "Salt excess causes left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in rats with metabolic disorder.", "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a highly predisposing condition for cardiovascular disease and could be a cause of excess salt-induced organ damage. Recently, several investigators have demonstrated that salt loading causes left ventricular diastolic dysfunction associated with increased oxidative stress and mineralocorticoid receptor activation. We, therefore, investigated whether excess salt induces cardiac diastolic dysfunction in metabolic syndrome via increased oxidative stress and upregulation of mineralocorticoid receptor signals. Thirteen-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats and SHR/NDmcr-cps, the genetic model of metabolic syndrome, were fed a normal salt (0.5% NaCl) or high-salt (8% NaCl) diet for 4 weeks. In SHR/NDmcr-cps, salt loading induced severe hypertension, abnormal left ventricular relaxation, and perivascular fibrosis. Salt-loaded SHR/NDmcr-cps also exhibited overproduction of reactive oxygen species and upregulation of mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent gene expression, such as Na(+)/H(+) exchanger-1 and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 in the cardiac tissue. However, in spontaneously hypertensive rats, salt loading did not cause these cardiac abnormalities despite a similar increase in blood pressure. An antioxidant, tempol, prevented salt-induced diastolic dysfunction, perivascular fibrosis, and upregulation of mineralocorticoid receptor signals in SHR/NDmcr-cps. Moreover, a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, eplerenone, prevented not only diastolic dysfunction but also overproduction of reactive oxygen species in salt-loaded SHR/NDmcr-cps.

Six hours after the CCl 4 injection, all animals were sacrificed, and serum, liver, kidney, and heart tissue samples were collected. Analysis results showed that the addition of oregano significantly increased the total phenolic content and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of the basal diet but had no effect on its lipid peroxidation index. Treatment with CCl 4 of rats from the CCl 4 group caused a significant increase in aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in serum, whereas it decreased cholesterol and triglyceride content as compared to the control. It also increased the lipid peroxidation index and decreased the scavenging activities of the 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid diammonium salt (ABTS) radical cation, the hydroxyl anion radical, the superoxide anion radical, and the hydrogen peroxide in all tested tissues, as compared to that of the control. Without CCl 4 treatment, diet supplementation with oregano had no effect on these biochemical parameters, excluding the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, which was increased in all tested tissues as compared to that of the control.

In both adult and late-stage embryonic Cx40(+/+) mice, heterogeneity in CV was found between the right and left atrial appendages. Either partial (Cx40(+/-)) or complete (Cx40(-/-)) deletion of Cx40 was associated with the loss of conduction heterogeneity in both adult and embryonic mice. Additionally, sinus node impulse initiation was found to be ectopic in Cx40(-/-) mice at 15.5 days postcoitus, whereas Cx40(+/+) mice showed normal activation occurring near the crista terminalis. Our findings suggest that Cx40 plays an essential role in establishing interatrial conduction velocity heterogeneity in the murine model. Additionally, we describe for the first time a developmental requirement for Cx40 in normal sinus node impulse initiation at 15.5 days postcoitus.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2008-07-05", "authors": ["David ELeaf", "Jonathan EFeig", "CarolinaVasquez", "Pamela LRiva", "CindyYu", "Joshua MLader", "AndrianosKontogeorgis", "Elvera LBaron", "Nicholas SPeters", "Edward AFisher", "David EGutstein", "Gregory EMorley"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.168997"}

LV diastolic dysfunction is not caused by increased afterload, and we recently showed that reduced phosphorylation of phospholamban at serine (Ser) 16 may explain the reduced relaxation of the myocardium. Here, we study the mechanisms leading to the hypoxia-induced reduction in phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16.\nIn C57Bl/6j mice exposed to 10% oxygen, signalling molecules were measured in cardiac tissue, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-enriched membrane preparations, and serum. Cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal mice were exposed to interleukin (IL)-18 for 24 h. The beta-adrenergic pathway in the myocardium was not altered by alveolar hypoxia, as assessed by measurements of beta-adrenergic receptor levels, adenylyl cyclase activity, and subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. However, alveolar hypoxia led to a significantly higher amount (124%) and activity (234%) of protein phosphatase (PP) 2A in SR-enriched membrane preparations from LV compared with control. Serum levels of an array of cytokines were assayed, and a pronounced increase in IL-18 was observed. In isolated cardiomyocytes, treatment with IL-18 increased the amount and activity of PP2A, and reduced phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 to 54% of control.\nOur results indicate that the diastolic dysfunction observed in alveolar hypoxia might be caused by increased circulating IL-18, thereby inducing an increase in PP2A and a reduction in phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2008-07-05", "authors": ["Karl-OttoLarsen", "BirgitteLygren", "IvarSjaastad", "Kurt AKrobert", "KristinArnkvaern", "GeirFlorholmen", "Ann-Kristin RuudLarsen", "Finn OlavLevy", "KjetilTask\u00e9n", "Ole HenningSkj\u00f8nsberg", "GeirChristensen"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvn180"}

While the effects of chronic AR on the left ventricle are well known, the effects of acute AR have not been adequately evaluated. It was hypothesized that the LV tissues would be rapidly remodeled by acute AR, and that the renin-angiotensin system would be involved in that acute remodeling.\nThe early LV adaptations to acute AR were evaluated serially over a period of 14 days, using a rat model. Adaptations were evaluated in vivo by echocardiography, and in vitro on explanted heart tissue after one, two, or 14 days.\nAfter 14 days, the left ventricle of AR rats was already significantly hypertrophied and dilated (end-diastolic diameter +16% (p <0.05) versus sham; LV mass +16% (p <0.01) versus sham). A short and transient increase in fractional shortening was observed during the first 48 h after AR induction. The cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and perivascular fibrosis were significantly increased after 14 days of AR. The number of fibronectin-positive cells in LV sections rapidly increased, as did the fibronectin protein and mRNA content of LV crude homogenates. The expression of pro-matrix metalloproteinase 2 was clearly abnormal after two days. Significant shifts in the expression of angiotensin II receptors were also detected as early as one 1 day.\nSignificant macroscopic and microscopic abnormalities were present in the left ventricle of rats with acute AR, soon after its induction. Considerable hypertrophy, perivascular fibrosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling were present after only 14 days.

{"title": "Evidence for Wg-independent tergite boundary formation in the millipede Glomeris marginata.", "abstract": "The correlation between dorsal and ventral segmental units in diplopod myriapods is complex and disputed. Recent results with engrailed (en), hedgehog (hh), wingless (wg), and cubitus-interruptus (ci) have shown that the dorsal segments are patterned differently from the ventral segments. Ventrally, gene expression is compatible with the classical autoregulatory loop known from Drosophila to specify the parasegment boundary. In the dorsal segments, however, this Wg/Hh autoregulatory loop cannot be present because the observed gene expression patterns argue against the involvement of Wg signalling. In this paper, we present further evidence against an involvement of Wg signalling in dorsal segmentation and propose a hypothesis about how dorsal segmental boundaries may be controlled in a wg-independent way. We find that (1) the Notum gene, a modulator of the Wg gradient in Drosophila, is not expressed in the dorsal segments. (2) The H15/midline gene, a repressor of Wg action in Drosophila, is not expressed in the dorsal segments, except for future heart tissue. (3) The patched (ptc) gene, which encodes a Hh receptor, is strongly expressed in the dorsal segments, which is incompatible with Wg-Hh autoregulation. The available data suggest that anterior-posterior (AP) boundary formation in dorsal segments could instead rely on Dpp signalling rather than Wg signalling. We present a hypothesis that relies on Hh-mediated activation of Dpp signalling and optomotor-blind (omb) expression to establish the dorsal AP boundary (the future tergite boundary). The proposed mechanism is similar to the mechanism used to establish the AP boundary in Drosophila wings and ventral pleura.", "journal": "Development genes and evolution", "date": "2008-07-02", "authors": ["RalfJanssen", "Graham EBudd", "Wim G MDamen", "Nikola-MichaelPrpic"], "doi": "10.1007/s00427-008-0231-2"}

Two months later, the rabbits were either left untreated (MI group) or were treated daily for one month with 0.1 mg/kg wt of ramipril (ramipril group), then sacrificed. One month of ramipril treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and a decrease in hydroxyproline content. The protein profiles of LV tissue showed that ramipril caused upregulation of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and heart-type fatty acid binding-protein (h-FABP) and downregulation of HSP27 and cyclophilin A. Ramipril treatment caused an increase in catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and SOD activity in the LV tissue. Oxidized glutathione levels and the GSSG/GSH ratio in the heart tissue were lower in the ramipril group than in the MI group.\nRamipril increased antioxidative protein expression and enzyme activity, which could partly explain the role of ramipril in attenuating LV remodelling.

{"title": "A solution method for the determination of cardiac potential distributions with an alternating current source.", "abstract": "A recently presented solution method for the bidomain model (Johnston et al. 2006), which involves the application of direct current for studying electrical potential in a slab of cardiac tissue, is extended here to allow the use of an applied alternating current. The advantage of using AC current, in a four-electrode method for determining cardiac conductivities, is that instead of using 'close' and 'wide' electrode spacings to make potential measurements, increasing the frequency of the AC current redirects a fraction of the current from the extracellular space into the intracellular space. The model is based on the work of Le Guyader et al. (2001), but is able to include the effects of the fibre rotation between the epicardium and the endocardium on the potentials. Also, rather than using a full numerical technique, the solution method uses Fourier series and a simple one dimensional finite difference scheme, which has the advantage of allowing the potentials to be calculated only at points, such as the measuring electrodes, where they are required. The new alternating current model, which includes intracellular capacitance, is used with a particular four-electrode configuration, to show that the potential measured is affected by changes in fibre rotation. This is significant because it indicates that it is necessary to include fibre rotation in models, which are to be used in conjunction with measuring arrays that are more complex than those involving simply surface probes or a single vertical probe.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2008-06-24", "authors": ["Barbara MJohnston", "Peter RJohnston", "DavidKilpatrick"], "doi": "10.1080/10255840701747594"}

Here, we reviewed the current literatures regarding the role of IL-18 in the heart and cardiovascular system. Infiltrated neutrophils, resident macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes in the heart are able to produce IL-18 in response to injury.

{"title": "Amelioration of cadmium-induced cardiac impairment by taurine.", "abstract": "The present study has been designed to investigate the protective role of taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), a sulfur containing conditionally essential amino acid, against cadmium-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice. Cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) was used as the source of cadmium and it was administered orally at a dose of 4mg/kg body weight for 6 days. Cadmium exposure caused significant accumulation of the cadmium and iron in mice hearts tissue. Levels of serum specific markers related to cardiac impairments, e.g. total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride were altered due to cadmium toxicity. Reduction in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, namely, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) have been observed in cadmium exposed mice. Cadmium intoxication also decreased the cardiac glutathione (GSH) and total thiols contents and increased the levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation end products, protein carbonyl content and the extent of DNA fragmentation. Oral administration of taurine at a dose of 100mg/kg body weight for 5 days, however, prevented all the toxin-induced oxidative impairments mentioned above. \"Ferric Reducing/Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assay\" showed that taurine could protect the cardiac tissue by preventing cadmium-induced reduction of the intracellular antioxidant power. Histological examination of cardiac segments also supported the beneficial role of taurine against cadmium-induced damages in the murine hearts.

To assess the spatial organization of alternans, we tracked the evolution of nodal lines that separate out-of-phase regions of SDA. We measured the action potential duration heterogeneity index and maximal slope of CV restitution and estimated the effects of short-term memory by calculating time constant of action potential duration accommodation (tau). We found that 2 mechanisms underlie the development of SDA in the heart, leading to 2 distinct behaviors of nodal lines. The first mechanism is based on steep CV restitution and is associated with small tau and stable nodal lines. The second mechanism is associated with short-term memory (large tau) and is characterized by shallow CV restitution and unstable behavior of nodal lines. The maximum slope of the CV restitution was steeper (18.16+/-3.34 m/s(2)) and tau was smaller (tau=4.31+/-0.33 stimuli) for areas with stable nodal lines than for areas with unstable nodal lines (6.32+/-0.96 m/s(2) and tau=10.3+/-1.84 stimuli; P<0.01).\nOur results provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying SDA formation in the rabbit heart.

Gallic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid at a dosage of 100 mg kg(-1) body weight significantly increased the activities of cardiac superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) as compared with control rats (P<.05). The changes in cardiac CuZnSOD, GPx and CAT mRNA levels induced by phenolic acids were similar to those noted in the enzyme activity levels. A significant (P<.05) increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio was observed in the heart of phenolic acid-treated rats. The heart homogenates obtained from rats that were administered phenolic acids displayed significant (P<.05) increases in capacity for oxygen radical absorbance compared with control rats. Immunoblot analysis revealed the increased cardiac total level of Nrf2 in phenolic acid-treated rats.

Fibrin is a critical blood component responsible for hemostasis, which has been used extensively as a biopolymer scaffold in tissue engineering. In this review we summarize the latest developments in organ and tissue regeneration using fibrin as the scaffold material. Commercially available fibrinogen and thrombin are combined to form a fibrin hydrogel. The incorporation of bioactive peptides and growth factors via a heparin-binding delivery system improves the functionality of fibrin as a scaffold. New technologies such as inkjet printing and magnetically influenced self-assembly can alter the geometry of the fibrin structure into appropriate and predictable forms. Fibrin can be prepared from autologous plasma, and is available as glue or as engineered microbeads. Fibrin alone or in combination with other materials has been used as a biological scaffold for stem or primary cells to regenerate adipose tissue, bone, cardiac tissue, cartilage, liver, nervous tissue, ocular tissue, skin, tendons, and ligaments.

However the identification of the autoantigens recognized by B and T cells within the inflammatory microenvironment of heart tissue in patients with RHD is still incompletely elucidated. In the present study, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry to identify valvular tissue proteins target of T cells from chronic RHD patients.

The Ile451Met mutation is located inside a conserved motif in the desmin tail domain, believed to have a potential role in the lateral packing of type III intermediate filaments. Nevertheless, the role of the type III intermediate filament tail domain remains elusive. To further study the role of this domain in the function of cardiomyocytes and in the development of cardiomyopathy, we generated transgenic mice expressing the mutant desmin(I451M) in the cardiac tissue. Analysis of hearts from transgenic animals revealed that mutant desmin loses its Z-disc localization but it can still associate with the intercalated discs, which, however, have an altered architecture, resembling other examples of dilated cardiomyopathy. This is the first report demonstrating a critical role of the desmin head and tail domains in the formation of the IF scaffold around Z discs. It is further suggested that in cardiomyocytes, an interplay between desmin tail and head domains is taking place, which potentially protects the amino terminus of desmin from specific proteases. The fact that the association with intercalated discs seems unchanged suggests that this association must take place through the desmin tail, in contrast to the head domain that is most possibly involved in the Z-disc binding.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2008-06-10", "authors": ["ManolisMavroidis", "PanagiotaPanagopoulou", "IoannaKostavasili", "NoahWeisleder", "YassemiCapetanaki"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.07-088724"}

To achieve this goal, a bioengineered tissue graft consisting of a porous tissue scaffold sandwiched with multilayered sheets of mesenchymal stromal cells was developed.\nThis tissue graft (sandwiched patch) was used to replace the infarcted wall in a syngeneic Lewis rat model with an experimentally chronic myocardial infarction (MI). There were four treatment groups (n >/= 10): sham, MI, empty patch, and sandwiched patch. After a 7 day culture of the sandwiched patch, a tissue graft with relatively uniform cell concentrations was obtained. The cells were viable and tightly adhered to the tissue scaffold, as the endogenous extracellular matrix inherent with multilayered cell sheets can act as an adhesive agent for cell attachment and retention. At retrieval, the area of the empty patch was relatively enlarged, suggesting reduced structural support, while that of the sandwiched patch remained about the same (P = 0.56). In the immunofluorescent staining, host cells together with neo-microvessels were clearly observed in the empty patch; however, there were still a large number of unfilled pores within the patch. In the sandwiched patch, besides host cells, originally seeded cells were populated within the entire patch. No apparent evidence of apoptotic cell death was found in both studied patches. Thus, the sandwiched-patch-treated hearts demonstrated a better heart function to the empty-patch-treated hearts (P < 0.05).\nThe results demonstrated that this novel bioengineered tissue graft can serve as a useful cardiac patch to restore the dilated left ventricle and stabilize heart functions after MI.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2008-06-10", "authors": ["Chun-HungChen", "Hao-JiWei", "Wei-WenLin", "IwenChiu", "Shiaw-MinHwang", "Chung-ChiWang", "Wen-YuLee", "YenChang", "Hsing-WenSung"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvn149"}

Heart and skeletal muscles had higher frequencies and ratios of CD8+ TCRBV9+ to CD4+ TCRBV9+ T cells than lymph nodes. Also, homing experiments of CFSE-labeled T cells showed preferential homing of TCRBV9+ T cells to heart tissue. In vitro proliferation assays showed higher [3H]thymidine uptake by non-lymphoid tissue TCRBV9+ T cells than lymph node TCRBV9+ T cells co-cultured with antigen-presenting cells (APC), in response to T. cruzi amastigote antigens (TcAg).

Preliminary data also demonstrate cerebro- and hepatoprotecting properties of mildronate in AZT-toxicity models. We suggest that mildronate may target its action predominantly to mitochondria. The present study in isolated rat liver mitochondria was designed to clarify mitochondrial targets for mildronate by using AZT as a model compound. The aim of this study was to investigate: (1) whether mildronate may protect mitochondria from AZT-induced toxicity; and (2) which is the most critical target in mitochondrial processes that is responsible for mildronate's regulatory action. The results showed that mildronate protected mitochondria from AZT-induced damage predominantly at the level of complex I, mainly by reducing hydrogen peroxide generation. Significant protection of AZT-caused inhibition of uncoupled respiration, ADP to oxygen ratio, and transmembrane potential were also observed. Mildronate per se had no effect on the bioenergetics, oxidative stress, or permeability transition of rat liver mitochondria.

In this paper, we present the electrophysiological characterization of hERG1a, hERG1b, and co-expressed hERG1a/b channels in a mammalian expression system using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. We also quantified the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of hERG1a and hERG1b in human cardiac tissue, and based on the expressed ratios, we evaluated the resulting currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Compared to hERG1a channels, activation was faster for both hERG1b and hERG1a/b channels. The deactivation kinetics was greatly accelerated in the presence of hERG1b, whereas no difference in the time constant of inactivation was observed. The voltage-dependent recovery from inactivation was also similar. However, the time constant of recovery from inactivation was significantly faster for hERG1b channels compared to hERG1a and hERG1a/b. Quantification of hERG1a and hERG1b mRNA in the human heart showed that hERG1b mRNA constitutes, on average, 19% in the right atrium and 12% in the left ventricle of the total hERG1 mRNA. Expression of the observed ratios of hERG1a to hERG1b in X. laevis oocytes showed that these ratios are indeed sufficient to change the deactivation phenotype markedly.

{"title": "Integrin binding angiopoietin-1 monomers reduce cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Angiopoietins were thought to be endothelial cell-specific via the tie2 receptor. We showed that angiopoietin-1 (ang1) also interacts with integrins on cardiac myocytes (CMs) to increase survival. Because ang1 monomers bind and activate integrins (not tie2), we determined their function in vivo. We examined monomer and multimer expressions during physiological and pathological cardiac remodeling and overexpressed ang1 monomers in phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac ang1 levels (mRNA, protein) increased during postnatal development and decreased with phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy, whereas tie2 phosphorylations were unchanged. We found that most or all of the changes during cardiac remodeling were in monomers, offering an explanation for unchanged tie2 activity. Heart tissue contains abundant ang1 monomers and few multimers (Western blotting). We generated plasmids that produce ang1 monomers (ang1-256), injected them into mice, and confirmed cardiac expression (immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR). Ang1 monomers localize to CMs, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. In phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy, ang1-256 reduced left ventricle (LV)/tibia ratios, fetal gene expressions (atrial and brain natriuretic peptides, skeletal actin, beta-myosin heavy chain), and fibrosis (collagen III), and increased LV prosurvival signaling (akt, MAPK(p42/44)), and AMPK(T172). However, tie2 phosphorylations were unchanged. Ang1-256 increased integrin-linked kinase, a key regulator of integrin signaling and cardiac health.

Cardiac function was evaluated by heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular systolic pressure, maximal rise rate of left ventricular pressure [+dp/dt(max)], and the coronary effluent (CF). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the coronary effluent, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and Ca2+-ATPase activity in the cardiac tissue were measured using commercial kits.

The development implications for a compound causing a significant effect in the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study' -- as defined in the clinical regulatory guidance (ICH E14) -- are substantial. In view of this, and the fact that QT interval prolongation is linked to direct inhibition of the hERG channel, in the early stages of drug discovery the focus is on testing for and screening out hERG activity. This has led to understanding of how to produce low potency hERG blockers whilst retaining desirable properties. Despite this, a number of factors mean that when an integrated risk assessment is generated towards the end of the discovery phase (by conducting at least an in vivo QT assessment) a QT interval prolongation risk is still often apparent; inhibition of hERG channel trafficking and partitioning into cardiac tissue are just two confounding factors. However, emerging information suggests that hERG safety margins have high predictive value and that when hERG and in vivo non-clinical data are combined, their predictive value to man, whilst not perfect, is >80%. Although understanding the anomalies is important and is being addressed, of greater importance is developing a better understanding of TdP, with the aim of being able to predict TdP rather than using an imperfect surrogate marker (QT interval prolongation).

Nuclear factor-kappaB was also characterized via electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Systemic and cardiac myocyte secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-10 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Burn injury in WT mice promoted myocardial inflammatory signaling that included increased expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, nuclear p50, and increased cardiac myocyte secretion of cytokines. Systemic cytokines were also increased in WT animals, although not to the extent of the myocardial cytokine expression. Toll-like receptor 4 inactivation resulted in an attenuation of several burn-induced responses, including phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB, and cytokine secretion.

We wondered whether vaccine bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), which activated TLR4 to elicit immune responses, modulated the pressure overload-stimulated cardiovascular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in the murine models of abdominal aortic constriction (AAC)-induced hypertension. Before or after AAC, animals received BCG, TLR4 agonist, IFN-gamma, or TLR4 antagonist i.p. BCG and TLR4 agonist significantly prevented AAC-induced cardiovascular hypertrophy and reactive cardiac fibrosis with no changes in hemodynamics. Moreover, TLR4 antagonist reversed the BCG- and TLR4 agonist-induced actions of anti-cardiovascular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. BCG decreased the expression of TLR2 or TLR4 on the heart tissue but TLR4 agonist increased the expression of TLR2 or TLR4 on the immune cells that infiltrate into the heart tissue. This led to an increased expression ratio of IFN-gamma/TGF-beta in the heart. The cardiac protective effects of BCG and TLR4 agonist are related to their regulation of ERK-Akt and p38-NF-kappaB signal pathways in the heart.

Thus, EGCG appears to ameliorate disruptions of serum lipid profile and of antioxidant parameters in erythrocyte and cardiac tissue of Wistar rats fed an atherogenic diet; these results may be relevant to treating human atherosclerosis.", "journal": "Fundamental & clinical pharmacology", "date": "2008-05-20", "authors": ["ERamesh", "RElanchezhian", "MSakthivel", "TJayakumar", "R SSenthil Kumar", "PGeraldine", "P AThomas"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1472-8206.2008.00585.x"}
{"title": "Pravastatin attenuates carboplatin-induced cardiotoxicity via inhibition of oxidative stress associated apoptosis.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the cardiac toxicity induced by carboplatin, a second generation platinum-containing anti-cancer drug, and to test whether pravastatin can reduce this cardio-toxicity. In the present study, infusion of carboplatin (100 mg/kg) to mice resulted in decreased survival rates and abnormal cardiac histology, concomitant with increased cardiac apoptosis. In addition, treatment of cultured rat cardiomyocytes with carboplatin (100 muM for 48 h) caused marked apoptosis and increased caspase-3, -9, and cytochrome C, but decreased BCL-XL protein expression, and this was inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger n-acetylcysteine. Furthermore, pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with pravastatin (20 microM) before carboplatin exposure significantly attenuated apoptosis and decreased caspase-3, -9, cytochrome C activity. Lastly, mice pre-treated with pravastatin before carboplatin treatment showed improved survival rate and cardiac function, with reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activating Akt and restoring normal mitochondrial HAX-1 in heart tissue. In summary, our results show that carboplatin can induce cardiotoxicity in vivo and in cultured cells via a mitochondrial pathway related to ROS production, whereas pravastatin administration can reduce such oxidative stress thus prevented cardiac apoptosis. Therefore, pravastatin can be used as a cytoprotective agent prior to carboplatin chemotherapy.", "journal": "Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death", "date": "2008-05-17", "authors": ["Ching-FengCheng", "Shu-HuiJuan", "Jin-JerChen", "Ying-ChiChao", "His-HsienChen", "Wei-ShiungLian", "Chun-YiLu", "Chung-IChang", "Ted-HChiu", "HengLin"], "doi": "10.1007/s10495-008-0214-9"}
{"title": "Endogenous hedgehog expression contributes to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury.", "abstract": "The developmentally important hedgehog (Hh) pathway is activated in ischemic tissue, and exogenously administered Sonic hedgehog (Shh) supports tissue repair after cardiac ischemia. Hence, it is currently assumed that the endogenous increase in Shh during ischemia serves a beneficial role in limiting cardiac tissue damage. To prove or refute this hypothesis, we treated mice with the smoothened (Smo) inhibitor cyclopamine to block the Hh pathway during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The experimental induction of myocardial ischemia resulted in activation of the Hh pathway and hallmark features of myocardial damage, such as left ventricular dilatation and reduced cardiac output. Unexpectedly, cyclopamine treatment ameliorated left ventricular dilatation and cardiac output. As the beneficial effect of exogenous Shh was suggested to depend on reduced apoptosis, increased vascularization, and reduced fibrosis, we subsequently assessed the effect of cyclopamine on these processes. Vascularization was similar in cyclopamine-treated and control-treated animals, but increased apoptosis and reduced fibrosis were observed in the cyclopamine-treated animals. Thus, Hh seems to exert a dualistic action in cardiac ischemia in which high exogenous levels are able to foster tissue repair and endogenous Hh seems to be deleterious.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2008-05-16", "authors": ["Maarten FBijlsma", "Peter J ALeenders", "Ben J AJanssen", "Maikel PPeppelenbosch", "HugoTen Cate", "C ArnoldSpek"], "doi": "10.3181/0711-RM-307"}

The putative recombinant fibronectin-binding protein of S. mutans was purified using affinity chromatography and the cloned protein was used to prepare polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant protein. In immunoblot assays, antibodies against the S. pyogenes fibronectin-binding protein, FBP54, were cross-reactive with the S. mutans protein that was designated SmFnB. Additionally, antibodies to the S. mutans SmFnB protein reacted with the S. pyogenes FBP54 protein. The S. mutans SmFnB protein was found to bind to immobilized fibronectin in a concentration dependant manner. A mutant strain of S. mutans M51 that was constructed by allelic exchange did not express the SmFnB protein. This mutant strain, S. mutans DeltaSmFnB, was determined in an ELISA to bind to immobilized fibronectin 30% less when compared to the parental strain S. mutans M51. The results are consistent with the conclusion that the 63-kDa SmFnB protein of S. mutans is a fibronectin-binding protein that may contribute to the interaction of S. mutans with damaged heart tissue during pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.

Following the 2001 landmark discovery of cardiac valve injury associated with the widely prescribed anti-obesity drug combination fenfluramine-phentermine, and subsequent withdrawal, the need to understand and assess cardiac valve biology and pathology both preclinically and clinically has been accentuated. Unique aspects of the developmental biology, anatomy, and physiology of cardiac valves compared to main cardiac tissue have been discovered, and key elements of the pathophysiology of various valvular injury mechanisms have been described. Although general clinical cardiac valvular disease in humans has been well characterized, animal modeling of valvular injury has proved to be difficult and undersubscribed. Additionally, both the preclinical, pharmaceutical, toxicologic assessment of valvular injury and the understanding of species-comparative valvular pathology have been limited. As discoveries and awareness grows, the purpose of this paper is to review the structure and function of cardiac valves, mechanisms, and outcomes of the common acquired human cardiac valve diseases, including those that are drug-related; to summarize comparative laboratory animal valvular pathology; and to review the literature of contemporary animal models of valvular injury.", "journal": "Toxicologic pathology", "date": "2008-05-14", "authors": ["Kevin BDonnelly"], "doi": "10.1177/0192623307312707"}

Classical activation of macrophages during infection is protective, whereas alternative activation of macrophages is involved in the survival of host cells and parasites. We studied the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase as markers of classical and alternative activation, respectively, in heart tissue during in vivo infection of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. We found that expression of arginase I and II, as well as that of ornithine decarboxylase, was much higher in BALB/c mice than in C57BL/6 mice and that it was associated with the parasite burden in heart tissue. iNOS and arginase II were expressed by cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, heart-infiltrated CD68+ macrophages were the major cell type expressing arginase I. T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines were expressed in heart tissue in both infected mouse strains; however, at the peak of parasite infection, the balance between Th1 and Th2 predominantly favored Th1 in C57BL/6 mice and Th2 in BALB/c mice. The results of the present study suggest that Th2 cytokines induce arginase expression, which may influence host and parasite cell survival but which might also down-regulate the counterproductive effects triggered by iNOS in the heart during infection.", "journal": "The Journal of infectious diseases", "date": "2008-05-14", "authors": ["HenarCuervo", "Miguel APineda", "M PilarAoki", "SusanaGea", "ManuelFresno", "N\u00fariaGiron\u00e8s"], "doi": "10.1086/529527"}
{"title": "Mammalian liver cytochrome c is tyrosine-48 phosphorylated in vivo, inhibiting mitochondrial respiration.", "abstract": "Cytochrome c (Cyt c) is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), accepting electrons from bc(1) complex and transferring them to cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). The ETC generates the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. In addition, the release of Cyt c from the mitochondria often commits a cell to undergo apoptosis. Considering its central role in life (respiration) and death (apoptosis) decisions one would expect tight regulation of Cyt c function. Reversible phosphorylation is a main cellular regulatory mechanism, but the effect of cell signaling targeting the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system is not well understood, and only a small number of proteins that can be phosphorylated have been identified to date. We have recently shown that Cyt c isolated from cow heart tissue is phosphorylated on tyrosine 97 in vivo, which leads to inhibition of respiration in the reaction with CcO. In this study we isolated Cyt c from a different organ, cow liver, under conditions preserving the physiological phosphorylation state. Western analysis with a phosphotyrosine specific antibody suggested that liver Cyt c is phosphorylated. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation site was unambiguously assigned to Tyr-48 by immobilized metal affinity chromatography/nano-liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (IMAC/nano-LC/ESI-MS), and not to the previously identified phospho-Tyr-97 in cow heart. As is true of Tyr-97, Tyr-48 is conserved in eukaryotes. As one possible consequence of Tyr-48 phosphorylation we analyzed the in vitro reaction kinetics with isolated cow liver CcO revealing striking differences. Maximal turnover of Tyr-48 phosphorylated Cyt c was 3.7 s(-1) whereas dephosphorylation resulted in a 2.2 fold increase in activity to 8.2 s(-1).

Immunostaining detected the consistent presence of all Hsps in the pig myocardial cells under both transported and normal housing conditions. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed predominance of Hsp70 (significantly highest levels) and Hsp27 in the cytoplasm of myocardial cells. Hsp90 and Hsp86 were expressed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, preferentially in the cytoplasm, of the myocardial cells. In view of their abundant and uniform distributions in the myocardial cells, the expression and distribution patterns of all detected Hsps within the myocardial cells, mostly limited to the cytoplasm, could be related to their chaperone function for cells with important special activities in this study. The identification of all four Hsps in the blood vessel endothelial cells possibly implies that endothelial cells react to ischemia and hypoxia by expressing Hsps. Immunoblot findings suggest that the level of all Hsps decreased in response to stress due to a 6 h journey. The decrease in Hsp levels in the myocardial cells may indicate that the transport stress may have overcharged the repair mechanisms of the cells. Whether this distinct depletion of Hsps contributes to an increased susceptibility to acute heart failure and the sudden death syndrome in transported pigs should be elucidated in future experiments.", "journal": "Cell stress & chaperones", "date": "2008-05-10", "authors": ["EndongBao", "K RSultan", "BNowak", "JHartung"], "doi": "10.1007/s12192-008-0042-4\n10.1126/science.2799391\n10.1067/mtc.2003.29\n10.1159/000047079\n10.1038/332800a0\n10.1016/j.exger.2005.04.011\n10.1016/j.jep.2004.08.040\n10.1016/0092-8674(91)90611-2\n10.1016/0167-5699(90)90069-L\n10.1016/S0163-7258(98)00028-X\n10.1016/0739-7240(94)90041-8\n10.1038/227680a0\n10.2741/Liu\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0043\n10.1172/JCI117815\n10.1016/j.jcpa.2003.12.011\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2005.10.061\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2004.05.241\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2005.03.017\n10.1007/PL00000572\n10.1053/rvsc.2001.0448\n10.1016/0031-9384(88)90096-0\n10.1016/j.lfs.2004.12.034\n10.1016/S0022-5223(96)70155-1\n10.1016/j.jep.2007.03.015\n10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.01.005\n10.1172/JCI119327\n10.2460/ajvr.67.5.837\n10.1159/000025696\n10.1093/cvr/27.6.962\n10.1016/0309-1740(94)90121-X\n10.1177/0148607103027006396\n10.1379/CSC-155R.1\n10.2460/ajvr.68.11.1145"}

In human cardiac tissue erythrovirus genotypes other than PVB19 have not yet been reported. Three hundred seventeen consecutive patients with symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy (median left ventricular ejection fraction: 28.6%, range 5-45%) who underwent endomyocardial biopsy for the elucidation of the etiology, were analyzed using a new consensus PCR assay designed for the detection of the three erythrovirus genotype sequences. Endomyocardial biopsies of 151 (47.6%) patients were erythrovirus-positive. Genotype 1 specific sequences were detected in 43/151 (28.5%) of positive biopsy samples, whereas genotype 2-specific sequences so far considered rare in human disease and not yet been described in human heart tissue was identified in 108/151 (71.5%) of virus-positive endomyocardial biopsies with a preference in patients above 50 years of age.

We examined the mechanisms by which DEX augments cardiac LPL. DEX was injected in rats, and hearts were removed, or isolated cardiomyocytes were incubated with DEX (0-8 h), for measurement of LPL activity and Western blotting. Acute DEX induced whole body insulin resistance, likely an outcome of a decrease in insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, but not cardiac tissue. The increase in luminal LPL activity after DEX was preceded by rapid nongenomic alterations, which included phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 MAPK, that led to phosphorylation of heat shock protein (HSP)25 and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, facilitating LPL translocation to the myocyte cell surface. Unlike its effects in vivo, although DEX activated AMPK and p38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes, there was no phosphorylation of HSP25, nor was there any evidence of F-actin polymerization or an augmentation of LPL activity up to 8 h after DEX. Combining DEX with insulin appreciably enhanced cardiomyocyte LPL activity, which closely mirrored a robust elevation in phosphorylation of HSP25 and F-actin polymerization. Silencing of p38 MAPK, inhibition of PI 3-kinase, or preincubation with cytochalasin D prevented the increases in LPL activity. Our data suggest that, following DEX, it is a novel, rapid, nongenomic phosphorylation of stress kinases that, together with insulin, facilitates LPL translocation to the myocyte cell surface.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Slices of R. catesbeiana cardiac tissue were subjected to hyperosmotic shock, and total tissue Na(+), K(+), Cl(-) and ninhydrin-positive substances were measured.

The results show a maximum volume loss to 90.86+/-0.73% of the original volume (measured as 9% decrease in wet weight) during abrupt hyperosmotic shock. However, during a gradual osmotic challenge the volume was never significantly different from that of the control. During both types of hyperosmotic shock, we observed an increase in Na(+) but no significant change in Cl(-) contents. Additionally, we found no change in ninhydrin-positive substances during any osmotic challenge. Pharmacological analyses suggest the involvement of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, and perhaps the HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchanger. There is indirect evidence for decrease in Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity.

Echocardiography is performed in awake 18- and 28-mo-old mice at baseline and immediately following 3-h exposures to either filtered air or carbon black (CB; approximately 400 microg/m3) on 4 days. At 28 mo, left ventricular diameter at end-systole and end-diastole is significantly (P < 0.05) elevated, and fractional shortening is significantly reduced (49 +/- 3% vs. 56 +/- 3%) with CB exposure. In vivo hemodynamic measurements at 28 mo also demonstrate significant (P < 0.05) reductions in ejection fraction and increases in right ventricular and pulmonary vascular pressures following CB exposure. Functional changes at 28 mo are associated with increased ROS production as suggested by enhanced luminol activity. This elevated ROS production with aging and CB exposure is attributable to NOS uncoupling. Measurements of natriuretic peptide (atrial and brain) transcription and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2 and MMP9) activity in heart tissue are significantly (P < 0.05) amplified with senescence and exposure to CB, pointing to increased cardiac stress and remodeling.

For verification of our results, a Cx43-promoter-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) construct using the complete promoter [2771 base pairs (bp)] or fragments (0-2421 bp) with EGFP under control of the Cx43 promoter was transfected into cardiomyocytes, and fluorescence intensity was investigated. Phenylephrine exposure caused approximately 2-fold up-regulation of Cx43 protein with an EC(50) of approximately 5 nM, which was significantly inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide I [protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor], 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole (SB203580; p38 inhibitor), or 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (PD98059; p42/44 inhibitor). Similar findings were obtained for Cx43 mRNA. Furthermore, Cx43 up-regulation was accompanied by phosphorylation of p38, p42/44, and JNK. Moreover, we found translocation of c-fos and AP1 to the nucleus. Phenylephrine stimulation of Cx43-promoter EGFP-transfected cardiomyocytes significantly increased fluorescence, depending on the length of promoter fragments. A 91-bp fragment containing the first AP1 binding site produced approximately 50% of the fluorescence intensity of the complete promoter. Therefore, we conclude that alpha(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation up-regulates cardiac Cx43 expression via a PKC p38- and p42/44 MAPK-regulated pathway, possibly involving AP1.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2008-05-01", "authors": ["AidaSalameh", "SilkeKrautblatter", "SabineBaessler", "SebastianKarl", "DianaRojas Gomez", "StefanDhein", "DietrichPfeiffer"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.108.136663"}

Expressed only in cardiac muscle, cTnI is widely used in the clinic as a serum biomarker of cardiac injury. In vivo function of cTnI is influenced by phosphorylation and proteolysis; therefore analysis of post-translational modifications of the intact protein should greatly facilitate the understanding of cardiac regulatory mechanisms and may improve cTnI as a disease biomarker. cTnI (24 kDa, pI approximately 9.5) contains twelve serine, eight threonine, and three tyrosine residues, which presents a challenge for unequivocal identification of phosphorylation sites and quantification of positional isomers. In this study, we used top down electron capture dissociation and electron transfer dissociation MS to unravel the molecular complexity of cTnI purified from human heart tissue. High resolution MS spectra of human cTnI revealed a high degree of heterogeneity, corresponding to phosphorylation, acetylation, oxidation, and C-terminal proteolysis. Thirty-six molecular ions of cTnI were detected in a single ESI/FTMS spectrum despite running as a single sharp band on SDS-PAGE. Electron capture dissociation of monophosphorylated cTnI localized two major basal phosphorylation sites: a well known site at Ser(22) and a novel site at Ser(76)/Thr(77), each with partial occupancy (Ser(22): 53%; Ser(76)/Thr(77): 36%). Top down MS(3) analysis of diphosphorylated cTnI revealed occupancy of Ser(23) only in diphosphorylated species consistent with sequential (or ordered) phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the Ser(22/23) pair. Top down MS of cTnI provides unique opportunities for unraveling its molecular complexity and for quantification of phosphorylated positional isomers thus allowing establishment of the relevance of such modifications to physiological functions and disease status.", "journal": "Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP", "date": "2008-05-01", "authors": ["VladZabrouskov", "YingGe", "JaeSchwartz", "Jeffery WWalker"], "doi": "10.1074/mcp.M700524-MCP200"}

We have tested the hypothesis that muscarinic receptors other than the M(2) subtype are present in the heart as minor populations. We used several approaches: a set of competition binding experiments with pirenzepine, AFDX-116, 4-DAMP, PD 102807, p-F-HHSiD, AQ-RA 741, DAU 5884, methoctramine and tripinamide, blockage of M(1) muscarinic receptors using MT7 toxin, subtype-specific immunoprecipitation experiments and determination of phospholipase C activity. We also attempted to block M(1)-M(4) receptors using co-treatment with MT7 and AQ-RA 741. Our results show that only the M(2) subtype is present in the atria. In the ventricles, however, we were able to determine that 20% (on average) of the muscarinic receptors were subtypes other than M(2), with the majority of these belonging to the M(1) subtype. We were also able to detect a marginal fraction (6 +/- 2%) of receptors that, based on other findings, belong mainly to the M(5) muscarinic receptors. Co-treatment with MT7 and AQ-RA 741 was not a suitable tool for blocking of M(1)-M(4) receptors and can not therefore be used as a method for M(5) muscarinic receptor detection in substitution to crude venom. These results provide further evidence of the expression of the M(1) muscarinic receptor subtype in the rat heart and also show that the heart contains at least one other, albeit minor, muscarinic receptor population, which most likely belongs to the M(5) muscarinic receptors but not to that of the M(3) receptors.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2008-04-30", "authors": ["JaromirMyslivecek", "MartinKlein", "MartinaNovakova", "JanRicny"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-008-0285-8"}

While efforts have been made to understand the cellular and intercellular events of apoptotic cells, the signaling mechanisms in cells surviving from apoptotic injuries have been overlooked. Understanding signal transduction processes in cells with apoptosis resistance is of crucial importance to develop better strategies of preserving post-mitotic cells. To this end, we performed studies in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes using oxidative stress (H(2)O(2)) as an apoptotic inducer. We identified a population of cells bearing higher resistance to apoptosis and found that the cells that survived from apoptotic insults had markedly higher levels of AKT and STAT3. Inhibition of AKT activity by a dominant negative AKT construct or by a PI3K inhibitor reduced active NF-kappaB and STAT3 expression without significantly altering the activity of the latter. Activation of AKT by a constitutively activated AKT construct caused the opposite effects. Direct activation of NF-kappaB also enhanced STAT3 expression, an effect abrogated by NF-kappaB inhibitor. On the other hand, knockdown of STAT3 by siRNA or inhibition of STAT3 activity by decoy oligodeoxynucleotides or by JAK2 inhibitor diminished AKT expression. In conclusion, cardiomyocytes possess an apoptosis-resistant property as a cytoprotection mechanism which is likely conferred by mutual transactivation between AKT/NF-kappaB and JAK2/STAT3, a novel crosstalk between the two signaling pathways within the networking governing the cell fate.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2008-04-29", "authors": ["YanjieLu", "JinZhou", "ChaoqianXu", "HuixianLin", "JieningXiao", "ZhiguoWang", "BaofengYang"], "doi": "10.1159/000129389"}
{"title": "G protein-activated (GIRK) current in rat ventricular myocytes is masked by constitutive inward rectifier current (I(K1)).", "abstract": "Inwardly-rectifying K+ channel subunits are not homogenously expressed in different cardiac tissues. In ventricular myocytes (VM) the background current-voltage relation is dominated by I(K1), carried by channels composed of Kir2.x subunits, which is less important in atrial myocytes (AM). On the other hand in AM a large G protein gated current carried by Kir3.1/3.4 complexes can be activated by stimulation of muscarinic M(2) receptors (I(K(ACh))), which is assumed to be marginal in VM. Recent evidence suggests that total current carried by cardiac inward-rectifiers (I(K(ATP)), I(K(ACh)), I(K1)) in both, AM and VM is limited, due to K+ accumulation/depletion. This lead us to hypothesize that in conventional whole celI recordings I(K(ACh)) in VM is underestimated as a consequence of constitutive I(K1). In that case a reduction in density of I(K1) should be paralleled by an increase in density of I(K(ACh)). Three different experimental strategies have been used to test for this hypothesis: (i) Adenovirus-driven expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Kir2.1, one of the subunits supposed to form I(K1) channels, in VM caused a reduction in I(K1)-density by about 80 %. In those cells I(K(ACh)) was increased about 4 fold. (ii) A comparable increase in I(K(ACh)) was observed upon reduction of I(K1) caused by adenovirus-mediated RNA interference.(iii) Ba2+ in a concentration of 2 microM blocks I(K1) in VM by about 60 % without affecting atrial I(K(ACh)). The reduction in I(K1) by 2 microM Ba2+ is paralleled by a reversible increase in I(K(ACh)) by about 100%.

In this paper, we examine the efficiency of the numerical solution of four cardiac electrophysiological models using implicit--explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) splitting methods.

The structure of RAD16-II is hierarchical, with monomers forming long beta-sheets that pair together to form filaments; filaments form bundles approximately 30-60 nm in diameter; branching networks of filament bundles form macroscopic gels. We investigate the mechanics of shearing between the two beta-sheets constituting one filament, and between cohered filaments of RAD16-II. This shear loading is found in filament bundle bending or in tensile loading of fibers composed of partial-length filaments. Molecular dynamics simulations show that time to failure is a stochastic function of applied shear stress, and that for a given loading time behavior is elastic for sufficiently small shear loads. We propose a coarse-grained model based on Langevin dynamics that matches molecular dynamics results and facilities extending simulations in space and time. The model treats a filament as an elastic string of particles, each having potential energy that is a periodic function of its position relative to the neighboring filament.

{"title": "Effect of HIV-1-related protein expression on cardiac and skeletal muscles from transgenic rats.", "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the consequent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has protean manifestations, including muscle wasting and cardiomyopathy, which contribute to its high morbidity. The pathogenesis of these myopathies remains partially understood, and may include nutritional deficiencies, biochemical abnormalities, inflammation, and other mechanisms due to viral infection and replication. Growing evidence has suggested that HIV-1-related proteins expressed by the host in response to viral infection, including Tat and gp120, may also be involved in the pathophysiology of AIDS, particularly in cells or tissues that are not directly infected with HIV-1. To explore the potentially independent effects of HIV-1-related proteins on heart and skeletal muscles, we used a transgenic rat model that expresses several HIV-1-related proteins (e.g., Tat, gp120, and Nef). Outcome measures included basic heart and skeletal muscle morphology, glutathione metabolism and oxidative stress, and gene expressions of atrogin-1, muscle ring finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) and Transforming Growth Factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1), three factors associated with muscle catabolism.\nConsistent with HIV-1 associated myopathies in humans, HIV-1 transgenic rats had increased relative heart masses, decreased relative masses of soleus, plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles, and decreased total and myosin heavy chain type-specific plantaris muscle fiber areas. In both tissues, the levels of cystine (Cyss), the oxidized form of the anti-oxidant cysteine (Cys), and Cyss:Cys ratios were significantly elevated, and cardiac tissue from HIV-1 transgenic rats had altered glutathione metabolism, all reflective of significant oxidative stress. In HIV-1 transgenic rat hearts, MuRF-1 gene expression was increased. Further, HIV-1-related protein expression also increased atrogin-1 (approximately 14- and approximately 3-fold) and TGFbeta1 (approximately 5-fold and approximately 3-fold) in heart and plantaris muscle tissues, respectively.\nWe provide compelling experimental evidence that HIV-1-related proteins can lead to significant cardiac and skeletal muscle complications independently of viral infection or replication. Our data support the concept that HIV-1-related proteins are not merely disease markers, but rather have significant biological activity that may lead to increased oxidative stress, the stimulation of redox-sensitive pathways, and altered muscle morphologies.

On the one hand we do not completely understand the biology of the MSC, on the other hand their interactions with the complex in vivo situation e. g. after myocardial infarction and the following remodeling processes are difficult to study. Initially, with respect to their in vitro differentiation capacity, it has been assumed that transplanted MSC may, promoted by the local microenvironment, differentiate in vivo into cells of cardiomyogenic phenotype or even cardiomyocytes, integrate themselves into the myocardium and help to regenerate the damaged tissue. The finding that after transplantation only a minor percentage of the MSC showed long term survival and persistent lack of evidence for in vivo differentiation make the original mechanistic concept of in vivo cardiomyogenic differentiation questionable. More recent studies suggest that the transplanted MSC may interact with the local tissue releasing paracrine factors and may hereby support the regenerative process. In this article, referring to experimental and preclinical studies, characteristics, sources, differentiation and paracrine activity of MSC contributing to cardioprotection and cardiac regeneration will be discussed.", "journal": "Panminerva medica", "date": "2008-04-23", "authors": ["RSch\u00e4fer", "HNorthoff"], "doi": null}

Because adipocytes express mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and MR blockade reduces cardiovascular inflammation and injury, we tested the hypothesis that MR blockade reduces inflammation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue and increases adiponectin expression in adipose tissue and hearts of obese mice.\nWe determined the effect of MR blockade (eplerenone, 100 mg/kg per day for 16 weeks) on gene expression in retroperitoneal adipose and heart tissue from obese, diabetic db/db mice (n=8) compared with untreated obese, diabetic db/db mice (n=10) and lean, nondiabetic db/+ littermates (n=11). Expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and macrophage protein CD68 increased, and expression of adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma decreased in retroperitoneal adipose tissue from obese versus lean mice. In addition, adiponectin expression in heart was reduced in obese versus lean mice. MR blockade prevented these obesity-related changes in gene expression. Furthermore, treatment of undifferentiated preadipocytes with aldosterone (10(-8) mol/L for 24 hours) increased mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and reduced mRNA and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and adiponectin, supporting a direct aldosterone effect on gene expression.\nMR blockade reduced expression of proinflammatory and prothrombotic factors in adipose tissue and increased expression of adiponectin in heart and adipose tissue of obese, diabetic mice. These effects on adiponectin and adipokine gene expression may represent a novel mechanism for the cardioprotective effects of MR blockade.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2008-04-23", "authors": ["ChristineGuo", "VincentRicchiuti", "Bill QLian", "Tham MYao", "PatriciaCoutinho", "Jos\u00e9 RRomero", "JianminLi", "Gordon HWilliams", "Gail KAdler"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.748640"}

Yet many of the suitable cells currently identified for human use are difficult to obtain and involve invasive procedures. In our search for novel stem cells with a higher cardiomyogenic potential than those available from bone marrow, we discovered that potent cardiac precursor-like cells can be harvested from human menstrual blood. This represents a new, noninvasive, and potent source of cardiac stem cell therapeutic material. We demonstrate that menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal cells (MMCs) began beating spontaneously after induction, exhibiting cardiomyocyte-specific action potentials. Cardiac troponin-I-positive cardiomyocytes accounted for 27%-32% of the MMCs in vitro. The MMCs proliferated, on average, 28 generations without affecting cardiomyogenic transdifferentiation ability, and expressed mRNA of GATA-4 before cardiomyogenic induction. Hypothesizing that the majority of cardiomyogenic cells in MMCs originated from detached uterine endometrial glands, we established monoclonal endometrial gland-derived mesenchymal cells (EMCs), 76%-97% of which transdifferentiated into cardiac cells in vitro. Both EMCs and MMCs were positive for CD29, CD105 and negative for CD34, CD45. EMCs engrafted onto a recipient's heart using a novel 3-dimensional EMC cell sheet manipulation transdifferentiated into cardiac tissue layer in vivo. Transplanted MMCs also significantly restored impaired cardiac function, decreasing the myocardial infarction (MI) area in the nude rat model, with tissue of MMC-derived cardiomyocytes observed in the MI area in vivo.

Although administration of 17beta-estradiol (E2) protects cardiovascular injury from trauma-hemorrhage, the mechanism by which E2 produces those effects remains unknown. Our objective was to determine whether the E2-mediated activation of myocardial p38 MAPK and subsequent eNOS expression/phosphorylation would protect the heart following trauma-hemorrhage. To study this, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent soft-tissue trauma (midline laparatomy) and hemorrhagic shock (mean blood pressure 35-40 mmHg for 90 min), followed by fluid resuscitation. Animals were pretreated with specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-203580 (SB; 2 mg/kg), and nonselective NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; 30 mg/kg) 30 min before vehicle (cyclodextrin) or E2 (100 microg/kg) treatment, followed by resuscitation, and were killed 2 h thereafter. Cardiovascular performance and other parameters were measured. E2 administration following trauma-hemorrhage increased cardiac p38 MAPK activity, eNOS expression and phosphorylation at Ser(1177), and nitrate/nitrite levels in plasma and heart tissues; these were associated with normalized cardiac performance, which was reversed by SB administration. In addition, E2 also prevented trauma-hemorrhage-induced increase in cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha), chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1), and ICAM-1, which was reversed by l-NAME administration. Administration of E2 following trauma-hemorrhage attenuated cardiac tissue injury markers, myeloperoxidase activity, and nitrotyrosine level, which were reversed by treatment with SB and l-NAME. The salutary effects of E2 on cardiac functions and tissue protection following trauma-hemorrhage are mediated, in part, through activation of p38 MAPK and subsequent eNOS expression and phosphorylation.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Although strain-modulated velocity is a well established finding in experimental cardiology, its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this work, we summarized potential factors contributing to strain-velocity relationships and reviewed related experimental and computational studies. We presented results from our experimental studies on rabbit papillary muscle, which supported a biphasic relationship of strain and velocity under uni-axial straining conditions. In the low strain range, the strain-velocity relationship was positive. Conduction velocity peaked with 0.59 m/s at 100% strain corresponding to maximal force development. In the high strain range, the relationship was negative. Conduction was reversibly blocked at 118+/-1.8% strain. Reversible block occurred also in the presence of streptomycin. Furthermore, our studies revealed a moderate hysteresis of conduction velocity, which was reduced by streptomycin. We reconstructed several features of the strain-velocity relationship in a computational study with a myocyte strand. The modeling included strain-modulation of intracellular conductivity and stretch-activated cation non-selective ion channels. The computational study supported our hypotheses, that the positive strain-velocity relationship at low strain is caused by strain-modulation of intracellular conductivity and the negative relationship at high strain results from activity of stretch-activated channels. Conduction block was not reconstructed in our computational studies. We concluded this work by sketching a hypothesis for strain-modulation of conduction and conduction block in papillary muscle. We suggest that this hypothesis can also explain uni-axially measured strain-conduction velocity relationships in other types of cardiac tissue, but apparently necessitates adjustments to reconstruct pressure or volume related changes of velocity in atria and ventricles.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2008-04-15", "authors": ["T GMcNary", "KSohn", "BTaccardi", "F BSachse"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2008.02.023"}

Using microarray analysis of cardiac tissue exposed to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we discovered that 2 small calcium-regulating proteins (S100A8 and S100A9) are highly upregulated. HL-1 cardiomyocytes, isolated primary cardiomyocytes, and live mice were exposed to LPS, whereas beating HL-1 cells had S100A8 and S100A9 overexpressed and their calcium flux quantified. Using in vivo microbubble technology, we delivered S100A8 and S100A9 to normal mouse hearts; using the same technology, we inhibited S100A9 production in mouse hearts and subsequently exposed them to LPS. Coimmunoprecipitation of S100A8 and S100A9 identified interaction with RAGE (the receptor for advanced glycation end products), the cardiac function and postreceptor signaling of which were investigated. HL-1 cardiomyocytes, isolated primary cardiomyocytes, and whole hearts exposed to LPS have large increases in S100A8 and S100A9. Cardiac overexpression of S100A8 and S100A9 led to a RAGE-dependent decrease in calcium flux and, in the intact mouse, to a decreased cardiac ejection fraction, whereas knockdown of S100A9 attenuated LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction.

In the present study, we provide evidence for the specific localization of cardiotin in cardiac mitochondria and for its down-regulation during adaptive remodeling (dedifferentiation) of cardiomyocytes.\nImmunocytochemistry was used to study cardiotin localization in adult rabbit papillary muscle, in late-stage embryonic rabbit left ventricular tissue, and in left ventricle samples of rabbits suffering from pressure and volume overload. Western blot analysis of cardiotin was performed in purified pig heart mitochondrial fractions. Cardiotin expression was monitored in vitro in isolated adult rat and rabbit left ventricular cardiomyocytes.\nWestern blot analysis revealed the presence of cardiotin in the mitochondrial fractions of pig heart. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the presence of cardiotin in cardiac mitochondria of normal adult rabbits both in vivo and in vitro. Quantification of the localization of immunogold particles suggests an association of cardiotin with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Cardiotin expression is initiated in late-stage embryonic rabbit heart, whereas in adult ventricular tissue cardiotin clearly stained longitudinal arrays of mitochondria. Pressure- and volume-overloaded myocardium showed a reduction in cardiotin expression in dispersed local myocardial areas.

Under such conditions, c-Flip transgenic mice showed normal left ventricular function with a significantly reduced left ventricular hypertrophy compared with wild-type mice and reduced induction of the cardiac \"fetal\" gene programme. Further, analysis of intracellular signaling pathways indicated that c-Flip overexpression reduced phosphorylation of both the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3 beta) and Akt as compared with controls.

In order to systematically probe 3D matrix effects on P19 EC differentiation, matrix elasticity, MMP-sensitivity and the concentration of a matrix-bound RGDSP peptide were modulated. Soft matrices (E=322+/-64.2 Pa, stoichiometric ratio: 0.8), mimicking the elasticity of embryonic cardiac tissue, increased the fraction of cells expressing the early cardiac transcription factor Nkx2.5 around 2-fold compared to embryoid bodies (EB) in suspension. In contrast, stiffer matrices (E=4,036+/-419.6 Pa, stoichiometric ratio: 1.2) decreased the number of Nkx2.5-positive cells significantly. Further indicators of cardiac maturation were promoted by ligation of integrins relevant in early cardiac development (alpha(5)beta(1,) alpha(v)beta(3)) by the RGDSP ligand in combination with the MMP-sensitivity of the matrix, with a 6-fold increased amount of myosin heavy chain (MHC)-positive cells as compared to EB in suspension.

The reverse--effects of mechanical stimulation on cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling--are much less well understood, in particular during the inter-beat period, called 'diastole'. We have investigated the effects of diastolic length changes, applied axially using a pair of carbon fibres attached to opposite ends of Guinea pig isolated ventricular myocytes, on the availability of Ca2+ in the main cellular stores (the sarcoplasmic reticulum; SR), by studying the rest-decay of SR Ca2+ content [Ca2+]SR, and the reloading of the SR after prior depletion of Ca2+ from the cell. Cells were loaded with Fura-2 AM (an indicator of the cytosolic 'free' Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i), and pre-conditioned by field-stimulation (2 Hz) at 37 degrees C, while [Ca2+]i transients and sarcomere length (SL) were recorded simultaneously. After reaching a steady state in the behaviour of observed parameters, stimulation was interrupted for between 5 and 60s, while cells were either held at resting length, or stretched (controlled to cause a 10% increase in SL, to aid inter-individual comparison). Thereafter, each cell was returned to its original resting length, followed by swift administration of 10mM of caffeine (in Na+/Ca2+-free solution), which causes the release of Ca2+ from the SR (caffeine), but largely prevents extrusion of Ca2+ from the cytosol to the cell exterior (Na+/Ca2+-free solution). By comparing the [Ca2+]i in cells exposed/not exposed to diastolic stretch of different duration, we assessed the rest-decay dynamics of [Ca2+]SR. To assess SR reloading after initial Ca2+ depletion, the same stretch protocol was implemented after prior emptying of the cell by application of 10mM of caffeine in normal Tyrode solution (which causes Ca2+ to be released from the SR and extruded from the cell via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; NCX). Axial stretch enhanced the rate of both rest-decay and reloading of [Ca2+]SR. Application of 40 microM streptomycin, a blocker of stretch-activated ion channels, did not affect the stretch-induced increase in SR reloading. This behaviour was reproduced in a computer simulation study, using a modified version of the 2006 Iribe-Kohl-Noble model of single cardiac myocyte Ca2+ handling, suggesting that stretch increases both Ca2+ leak from the SR and Ca2+ influx via the sarcolemma. This may have important implications for the mobilisation of Ca2+ in stretched cells, and could contribute to the regional 'matching' of individual cardiomyocyte contractility to dynamic, and regionally varying, changes in mechanical loads, such as diastolic pre-load, of cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2008-04-09", "authors": ["GentaroIribe", "PeterKohl"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2008.02.012"}

The spatial arrangement is therefore sufficiently fine to insure stimulation and recording within cardiac tissue space constants, as six electrodes with dimensions of either 5 x 100 microm2, 5 x 250 microm2, or 5 x 500 microm2 were positioned in a 130-microm2 span in the arrays. Despite the small electrode sizes and available surface areas, favorable impedance characteristics were identifed. Averages ranged from 111 kOmega to 146 kOmega at 0.5 Hz and from 14 kOmega 39 kOmega at 500 Hz. Differences in impedances between the electrode sizes tested were small. Potential differences (deltaphis) recorded using the two central electrodes during stimulation with combinations at separations of only 75 microm, 100 microm, and 125 microm had low signal noise. As a preliminary test of the use of these arrays for possible application to impedance measurements in cardiac tissue, the deltaphis recorded during stimulation were compared to deltaphis obtained from finite-difference simulations using an isotropic volume conductor model. Anticipated decays in deltaphi with widening electrode separation identified in those simulations matched the decays in the recorded deltaphis closely.

Two groups of old (22 mo) rats were treated with beta-alanine (3%, w/v; in drinking water), a taurine depleting agent, or taurine (2% w/v; in drinking water) for 6 wk. Significant decreases were observed in taurine contents of hearts in old rats as compared to young (5 mo) rats.

This treatment did not cause further increases in MDA or DC levels or changes in antioxidants. However, AA- and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation was higher than that of old rats. Taurine treatment caused significant increases in heart taurine levels of old rats. This treatment was found to decrease endogenous MDA and DC levels without affecting the antioxidant system in the heart homogenates of aged rats. AA- and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation was also reduced in old rats when given taurine, although not statistically significantly.

{"title": "[Clinical and pathological study on early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies].", "abstract": "[123I] Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy has been used to evaluate postganglionic cardiac sympathetic innervation in heart diseases and some neurological disorders. To see clinical usefulness of MIBG myocardial scintigraphy to differentiate Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from related movement disorders and Alzheimer disease (AD), we performed MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in patients with these disorders. Cardiac uptake of MIBG is specifically reduced in PD and DLB, and this imaging approach is a sensitive diagnostic tool that possibly differentiates PD and DLB from related movement disorders and AD. To see pathological basis of the reduced cardiac uptake of MIBG in Lewy body disease, we immunohistochemically examined cardiac tissues from patients with PD, DLB, related movement disorders and AD using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phosphorylated neurofilament (NF). Not only TH- but also NF-immunoreactive (ir) axons in the epicardial nerve fascicles were markedly decreased in Lewy body disease, namely cardiac sympathetic denervation, which accounts for the reduced cardiac uptake of MIBG in Lewy body disease. Patients with PD and DLB have Lewy bodies (LBs) in the nervous system, whereas patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, parkin-associated PD and AD have no LBs in the nervous system. Even in patients with MSA, cardiac sympathetic denervation was associated with the presence of LBs. Therefore, cardiac sympathetic denervation is closely related to the presence of LBs in a wide range of neurodegenerative processes. Taken together, we conclude that the reduced cardiac uptake of MIBG is a potential biomarker for the presence of LBs. Because alpha-synuclein is one of the key molecules in the pathogenesis of PD, we further investigate how alpha-synuclein aggregates are involved in degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD. We immunohistochemically examined cardiac tissues from patients with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD) and PD using antibodies against TH and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. We found that (1) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles, namely the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nerve, were much more abundant in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons than in ILBD with decreased TH-ir axons and PD; (2) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles were closely related to the disappearance of TH-ir axons; (3) in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons, alpha-synuclein aggregates were consistently more abundant in the epicardial nerve fascicles than in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia (pSG); and (4) this distal-dominant accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates was reversed in ILBD with decreased TH-ir axons and PD, which both showed decreased or depleted TH-ir axons but more abundant alpha-synuclein aggregates in the pSG. These findings indicate that accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system precedes that of neuronal somata or neurites in the pSG and that heralds centripetal degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD. This chronological and dynamic relationship between alpha-synuclein aggregates and distal-dominant degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system may represent the pathological mechanism underlying a common degenerative process in PD.", "journal": "Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "date": "2008-04-05", "authors": ["SatoshiOrimo"], "doi": "10.5692/clinicalneurol.48.11"}

Although the serum calcium and phosphorus levels were normalized in knockout mice on the rescue diet, abnormalities in blood pressure, cardiac structure-function and the renin-angiotensin system remained.

{"title": "[Transcatheter cryoablation in children: state of the art].", "abstract": "A new transcatheter ablation method has recently made its appearance in leading electrophysiology laboratories: cryoablation. In contrast with radiofrequency, this method produces a permanent lesion due to cell necrosis, caused by application of very low temperature chilling to the tip of special ablation catheters placed against the area of the heart causing arrhythmia. The benefit of this system over radiofrequency ablation is its ability to find the most suitable site for ablation through transitory electrical paralysis of the heart tissue in contact with the catheter tip, chilled to -30 degrees C (cryomapping). If the site is suitable, the tissue causing the arrhythmia loses its excitability. Moreover, the stability of the catheter tip, which adheres to the myocardium, enables arrhythmia inducibility through programmed atrial stimulation to be assessed without dislodging the catheter. A permanent lesion is created only subsequently, with further chilling to even lower temperatures (cryoablation). In the last 3 years the success rate of cryoablation in pediatric patients has increased and long-term complications have not been described yet. We therefore consider that cryoablation should be considered the treatment of choice for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and parahissian, anteroseptal and right midseptal accessory pathway atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia in school-age children. In fact cryoablation is thus \"made to measure\" for pediatric patients because if an atrioventricular block is observed, stopping the procedure is quickly followed by the restoration of normal atrioventricular conduction.", "journal": "Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)", "date": "2008-04-04", "authors": ["Mario SalvatoreRusso", "FabrizioDrago"], "doi": null}

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been suggested as a more practical diagnostic tool because it can be performed on routine paraffin-embedded tissue. There are few published data about hemodynamics and C4d staining. We prospectively performed C4d staining on endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) and present the pattern of tissue staining and its correlation with intracardiac hemodynamics.\nEMBs were evaluated by IHC for C4d staining and graded for cellular rejection using ISHLT criteria on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. Hemodynamic measurements were taken concurrently. Staining for C4d was described as absent, present with serum staining, or present with only tissue staining. The pattern of tissue staining was categorized by location of staining and correlated with intracardiac hemodynamics. Patient demographics, cytomegalovirus status, panel-reactive antibody levels and hemodynamics were analyzed by analysis of variance and chi-square statistics.\nOf the 400 EMBs, 50 had no C4d staining, 330 had tissue and serum staining, whereas 20 had only tissue staining. Forty EMBs had endothelial staining, including 35 with serum and 5 with isolated tissue staining. Endothelial staining correlated with higher intracardiac pressures.\nIHC staining for C4d has been suggested for the diagnosis of AMR.

According to the excitation theory of defibrillation, such shocks are aimed at depolarizing the membranes of most cardiac cells, resulting in resynchronization of electrical activity in the heart. If shock-induced transmembrane potentials are large enough, they can cause transient tissue damage due to electroporation. In this review, evidence is presented that electroporation of the heart tissue can occur during clinically relevant intensities of the external electrical field and that electroporation can affect the outcome of defibrillation therapy, being both pro- and antiarrhythmic.Here, we present experimental evidence for electroporation in cardiac tissue, which occurs above a threshold of 25 V/cm as evident from propidium iodide uptake, transient diastolic depolarization, and reductions of action potential amplitude and its derivative.

{"title": "CXCR4+/FLK-1+ biomarkers select a cardiopoietic lineage from embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells demonstrate an inherent propensity for unrestricted multi-lineage differentiation. Translation into regenerative applications requires identification and isolation of tissue-specified progenitor cells. From a comprehensive pool of 11,272 quality-filtered genes, profiling embryonic stem cells at discrete stages of cardiopoiesis revealed 736 transcripts encoding membrane-associated proteins, where 306 were specifically upregulated with cardiogenic differentiation. Bioinformatic dissection of exposed surface biomarkers prioritized the chemokine receptor cluster as the most significantly over-represented gene receptor family during pre cardiac induction, with CXCR4 uniquely associated with mesendoderm formation. CXCR4(+) progenitors were sorted from the embryonic stem cell pool into mesoderm-restricted progeny according to co-expression with the early mesoderm marker Flk-1. In contrast to CXCR4(-)/Flk-1(-) cells, the CXCR4(+)/Flk-1(+) subpopulation demonstrated overexpressed cardiac lineage transcription factors (Mef2C, Myocardin, Nkx2.5), whereas pluripotent genes (Oct4, Fgf4, Sox2) as well as neuroectoderm (Sox1) and endoderm alpha-fetoprotein markers were all depleted. In fact, the CXCR4(+)/Flk-1(+) biomarker combination identified embryonic stem cell progeny significantly enriched with Mesp-1, GATA-4, and Tbx5, indicative of pre cardiac mesoderm and the primary heart field. Although the CXCR4(+)/Flk-1(+) transcriptome shared 97% identity with the CXCR4(-)/Flk-1(-) counterpart, the 818 divergent gene set represented predominantly cardiovascular developmental functions and formed a primitive cardiac network. Differentiation of CXCR4(+)/Flk-1(+) progenitors yielded nuclear translocation of myocardial transcription factors and robust sarcomerogenesis with nascent cardiac tissue demonstrating beating activity and calcium transients. Thus, the CXCR4/Flk-1 biomarker pair predicts the emergence of cardiogenic specification within a pluripotent stem cell pool, enabling targeted selection of cardiopoietic lineage.

Differentiating genes were determined using regression analysis and Bland-Altman graph analysis. Hierarchical clusterization demonstrated that the profile of gene expression in postinfarction myocardium was different from that in the remaining specimens. Further statistical analysis showed two important differentiating genes: FOXO3A (underexpressed in post-MI sample) and CFLAR (overexpressed in post-MI sample).

One hundred broilers were heat-stressed for 0, 2, 3, 5, and 10 h, respectively, by rapidly increasing the ambient temperature from 22 +/- 1 degrees C to 37 +/- 1 degrees C. Obvious elevations of plasma creatine kinase indicate damage to myocardial cells after heat stress. Hsp70 and Hsp90, and their corresponding mRNAs in the heart tissue of heat-stressed broilers, elevated significantly after 2 h of heat exposure and decreased quickly with continued heat stress. However, the levels of hsp60 mRNA in the heart of heat-stressed broilers increased sharply (P < 0.01) at 2 h of heat stress but then decreased quickly after 3 h, while the level of Hsp60 protein in the heart increased (P < 0.01) at 2 h of heat stress and maintained a high level throughout heat exposure. The results indicate that the elevation of the three Hsps, especially Hsp60 in heart, may be important markers at the beginning of heat stress and act as protective proteins in adverse environments. The reduction of Hsp signals in the cytoplasm of myocardial cells implies that myocardial cell lesions may have an adverse impact on the function of Hsps during heat stress.

{"title": "Pro-inflammatory potential of ultrafine particles in mono- and co-cultures of primary cardiac cells.", "abstract": "Inhalation of particulate air pollution has been associated with increased risks for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, but the underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. One possible pathway may be that inhaled particles cross the air-blood barrier and interact directly with cardiac tissue. The aim of the present study was to examine the pro-inflammatory potential of particles in cardiac cells. Mono- and co-cultures of primary adult male Wistar (Han) rat cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiofibroblasts (CFs) were exposed to increasing concentrations of ultrafine (<100nm) carbon black particles (Printex 90). Expression and release of cytokines (IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) were measured by using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Cytotoxicity was estimated by measuring cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A particle concentration-dependent increase in IL-6 release was observed in both CM mono- and co-cultures (EC(50) approximately 57microg/ml). Furthermore, IL-6 levels detected in both control and particle-exposed co-cultures were synergistically increased compared to mono-cultures (10-19-fold, dependent on the exposure). Experiments with contact and non-contact co-cultures indicate that direct cellular contact is of key importance for the enhanced release of IL-6 in co-cultures. An apparent particle-induced release of IL-1beta was only detected in co-cultures. The release of TNF-alpha was low and did not seem notably influenced by particle exposure. Treatment with an IL-1 receptor antagonist apparently eliminated the particle-induced release of IL-6. In conclusion, ultrafine particles have a pro-inflammatory potential in primary cardiac cells. Furthermore, IL-1 seems critical in triggering particle-induced release of IL-6.

The interactions depend on HS structure, which is determined largely during biosynthesis by Golgi enzymes. How biosynthesis is regulated is more or less unknown. During polymerization of the HS chain, carried out by a complex of the exostosin proteins EXT1 and EXT2, the first modification enzyme, glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST), introduces N-sulfate groups into the growing polymer. Unexpectedly, we found that the level of expression of EXT1 and EXT2 affected the amount of NDST1 present in the cell, which, in turn, greatly influenced HS structure. Whereas overexpression of EXT2 in HEK 293 cells enhanced NDST1 expression, increased NDST1 N-glycosylation, and resulted in elevated HS sulfation, overexpression of EXT1 had opposite effects. Accordingly, heart tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing EXT2 showed increased NDST activity. Immunoprecipitaion experiments suggested an interaction between EXT2 and NDST1. We speculate that NDST1 competes with EXT1 for binding to EXT2. Increased NDST activity in fibroblasts with a gene trap mutation in EXT1 supports this notion.

Although a variety of strategies have been developed to enhance the structure and function of engineered cardiac tissues, an inherent limitation with traditional myocardial patches is that they do not permit evaluation of the fundamental relationships between pressure and volume that characterize global contractile function of the heart. Therefore, in the following study we introduce fully biological, living engineered cardiac organoids, or simplified heart chambers, that beat spontaneously, develop pressure, eject fluid, contain residual stress, exhibit a functional Frank-Starling mechanism, and generate positive stroke work. We also demonstrate regional variations in pump function following local cryoinjury, yielding a novel engineered tissue model of myocardial infarction. With the unique ability to directly evaluate relevant pressure-volume characteristics and regulate wall stress, this organoid chamber culture system provides a flexible platform for developing a controllable biomimetic cardiac niche environment that can be adapted for a variety of high-throughput and long-term investigations of cardiac pump function.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

QT interval prolongation and apoptosis have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of As(2)O(3). The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis and cardiac injury.\nIn a mouse model of As(2)O(3)-induced cardiomyopathy in vivo, QT intervals and plasma enzyme activities were measured; cardiac tissues were examined histologically and apoptosis assessed. In H9c2 cardiomyocyte cells, viability, apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular calcium levels were measured.\nIn the mouse model, resveratrol reduced As(2)O(3)-induced QT interval prolongation and cardiomyocyte injury (apoptosis, myofibrillar loss and vacuolization). In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase activity and decreased activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase were observed in the plasma of As(2)O(3)-treated mice; these changes were prevented by pretreatment with resveratrol. In As(2)O(3)-treated H9c2 cardiomyocytes, resveratrol significantly increased cardiomyocyte viability and attenuated cell apoptosis as measured by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay and caspase-3 activity. As(2)O(3)-induced generation of ROS and intracellular calcium mobilization in H9c2 cells was also suppressed by pretreatment with resveratrol.\nOur results showed that resveratrol significantly attenuated As(2)O(3)-induced QT prolongation, structural abnormalities and oxidative damage in the heart.

However, the role of CAR in virus-induced myocarditis has not been investigated so far. The purpose of this study was to assess myocardial CAR expression in response to cytokine-induced inflammatory reactions during the course of coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis. In Balb/c mice intraperitoneally infected with either 2x10(4) plaque-forming units (PFUs) of coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) or 10(2) PFUs CVB3, CAR expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a known cytokine-inducible transcription factor involved in viral defense, were determined. Our results demonstrated that within the first 7 days after virus inoculation, when the viral replication and STAT1 activation in the heart tissue was most prominent, the expression of CAR did not surpass that of uninfected controls. However, the up-regulation of CAR was observed 9 weeks later, when enteroviral RNA was no longer detectable and activation of STAT1 had already ceased. In contrast to the STAT1 target genes Mig and Irf1, interferon gamma stimulation failed to up-regulate Car expression in isolated cardiomyocytes. In human endomyocardial biopsies, Car expression was found to be elevated in approximately one third of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (9 of 30 patients) as compared with controls. Thus, activation of STAT1 clearly precedes the enhanced CAR expression observed during tissue reorganization, suggesting an essential role of STAT1 transcription factors in orchestrating the sequential actions involved in adaptive immune response.", "journal": "Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology", "date": "2008-03-11", "authors": ["VolkerRuppert", "ThomasMeyer", "SabinePankuweit", "ThuridurJonsdottir", "BernhardMaisch"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carpath.2007.07.004"}

In the present study it was analyzed the hypothesis that human cardiac fibroblasts (cFbs) exposed to HMGB1 may exert a paracrine effect on mouse and human CSCs. Human cFbs expressed the HMGB1 receptor RAGE. Luminex technology and ELISA assays revealed that HMGB1 significantly enhanced VEGF, PlGF, Mip-1alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, Il-10, Il-1beta, Il-4, Il-1ra, Il-9 and TNF-alpha in cFbs cell culture medium. HMGB1-stimulated cFbs conditioned media induced CSC migration and proliferation. These effects were significantly higher to those obtained when HMGB1 was added directly to the culture medium.

The mice were treated with 100 mg/kg Imatinib or vehicle, respectively, twice daily for 34 days. Expression of PDGF-C and of inflammatory cytokines were analysed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.

Fibrosis formation was analysed by Sirius-Red staining and hydroxyproline (HP) determination. Fibronectin, and tenascin expression was analysed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was assessed with collagen, synthetic peptides, and gelatine as substrates. Imatinib significantly inhibited the myocarditis-related PDGFalpha receptor activation in the heart tissue. The virus titres in the hearts, inflammatory infiltrations, and elevated PDGF levels were unaffected by the Imatinib treatment.

Furthermore, the underlying molecular pathways exhibit a significant number of similarities between vertebrates and the fruit fly Drosophila, suggesting a common origin of heart development in the last common ancestor of flies and vertebrates. However, there is hardly any molecular data from other animals. Here we show that many of the key genes are also active in heart development in the spider Cupiennius salei. Spiders belong to the chelicerates and are distantly related to insects with respect to the other arthropods. The tinman/Nkx2.5 ortholog is the first gene to be specifically expressed in the presumptive spider heart, like in flies and vertebrates. We also show that tinman is expressed in a similar way in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. Taken together this demonstrates that tinman has a conserved role in the specification of the arthropod heart. In addition, we analyzed the expression of other heart genes (decapentaplegic, Wnt5, H15, even-skipped, and Mef2 ) in Cupiennius. The expression of these genes suggests that the genetic pathway of heart development may be largely conserved among arthropods. However, a major difference is seen in the earlier expression of the even-skipped gene in the developing spider heart compared with Drosophila, implying that the role of even-skipped in heart formation might have changed during arthropod evolution. The most striking finding, however, is that in addition to the dorsal tissue of the fourth walking leg segment and the opisthosomal segments, we discovered tinman-expressing cells that arise from a position dorsal to the cephalic lobe and that contribute to the anterior dorsal vessel. In contrast to the posterior heart tissue, these cells do not express the other heart genes.

Using 3-D cultures we demonstrate that ECM arranged in an aligned fashion is necessary for the rod-shaped phenotype of the myocyte, and once this pattern is established, the myocytes were responsible for the alignment of any subsequent cell layers. This is analogous to the in vivo pattern that is observed, where there appears to be minimal ECM signaling, rather formation of multicellular patterns is dependent upon cell-cell interactions. Our 3-D culture of myocytes and fibroblasts is significant in that it models in vivo organization of cardiac tissue and can be used to investigate interactions between fibroblasts and myocytes.

The cardiomyocyte response to hypoxic-ischemic injury is known to include changes in cell cycle regulators. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57Kip2 is involved in cell cycle control, differentiation, stress signaling and apoptosis. In contrast to other cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p57Kip2 expression diminishes during postnatal life and is reactivated in the adult heart under conditions of cardiac stress. Overexpression of p57Kip2 has been previously shown to prevent apoptotic cell death in vitro by inhibiting stress-activated kinases. Therefore, we hypothesized that p57Kip2 has a protective role in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. To investigate this hypothesis, we created a transgenic mouse (R26loxpTA-p57k/+) that expresses p57Kip2 specifically in cardiac tissue under the ventricular cardiomyocyte promoter Mlc2v.\nTransgenic mice with cardiac specific overexpression of p57Kip2 are viable, fertile and normally active and their hearts are morphologically indistinguishable from the control hearts and have similar heart weight/body weight ratio.

Although overt hypothyroidism leads to impaired cardiac function and possibly heart failure, the cardiovascular consequences of borderline low thyroid function are not clear. Establishment of a suitable animal model would be helpful. In this study, we characterized a rat model to study the relationship between cardiovascular function and graded levels of thyroid activity. We used rats with surgical thyroidectomy and subcutaneous implantation of slow release pellets with three different T(4) doses for 3 wk. In terminal experiments, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiograms and hemodynamics. Myocardial arteriolar density was also quantified morphometrically. Thyroid hormone levels in serum and heart tissue were determined by RIA assays. Thyroidectomy alone led to cardiac atrophy, severe cardiac dysfunction, and a dramatic loss of arterioles. The low T(4) dose normalized serum T(3) and T(4) levels, but cardiac tissue T(3) and T(4) remained below normal. Low-dose T(4) failed to prevent cardiac atrophy or restore cardiac function and arteriolar density to normal values. All cardiac function parameters and myocardial arteriolar density were normalized with the middle dose of T(4), whereas the high dose produced hyperthyroidism. Our results show that thyroid hormones are important regulators of cardiac function and myocardial arteriolar density. This animal model will be useful in studying the pathophysiological consequences of mild thyroid dysfunction. Results also suggest that cardiac function may provide valuable supplemental information in proper diagnosis of mild thyroid conditions.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "The role of RIP2 in p38 MAPK activation in the stressed heart.", "abstract": "The activation of p38 MAPK by dual phosphorylation aggravates myocardial ischemic injury and depresses cardiac contractile function. SB203580, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of p38 MAPK and other kinases, prevents this dual phosphorylation during ischemia. Studies in non-cardiac tissue have shown receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) lies upstream of p38 MAPK, is SB203580-sensitive and ischemia-responsive, and aggravates ischemic injury. We therefore examined the RIP2-p38 MAPK signaling axis in the heart. Adenovirus-driven expression of wild-type RIP2 in adult rat ventricular myocytes caused robust, SB203580-sensitive dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK associated with activation of p38 MAPK kinases MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. The effect of SB203580 was recapitulated by unrelated inhibitors of RIP2 or the downstream MAPK kinase kinase, TAK1. However, overexpression of wild-type, kinase-dead, caspase recruitment domain-deleted, or kinase-dead and caspase recruitment domain-deleted forms of RIP2 had no effect on the activating dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK during simulated ischemia. Similarly, p38 MAPK activation and myocardial infarction size in response to true ischemia did not differ between hearts from wild-type and RIP2 null mice. However, both p38 MAPK activation and the contractile depression caused by the endotoxin component muramyl dipeptide were attenuated by SB203580 and in RIP2 null hearts. Although RIP2 can cause myocardial p38 MAPK dual phosphorylation in the heart under some circumstances, it is not responsible for the SB203580-sensitive pattern of activation during ischemia.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2008-03-04", "authors": ["SebastienJacquet", "YasuhiroNishino", "SarawutKumphune", "PierreSicard", "James EClark", "Koichi SKobayashi", "Richard AFlavell", "JanEickhoff", "MattCotten", "Michael SMarber"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M707750200"}

Thirty Texel \u00d7 Suffolk lambs used in this study had previously received diets (91 days) containing either HSY (6.30 mg Se per kg dry matter (DM)) or an unsupplemented control (C; 0.13 mg Se per kg DM). Following the period of supplementation, all lambs were then offered a complete pelleted diet, without additional Se (0.15 mg Se per kg DM), for 42 days. At enrolment and 21 and 42 days later, five lambs from each treatment were blood sampled, euthanased and samples of heart, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle (longissimus dorsi and psoas major) tissue were retained. Total Se concentration in whole blood and tissues was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in HSY lambs at all time points that had previously received long-term exposure to high dietary concentrations of SY. The distribution of total Se and the proportions of total Se comprised as SeMet and SeCys differed between tissues, treatment and time points. Total Se was greatest in HSY liver and kidney (22.64 and 18.96 mg Se per kg DM, respectively) and SeCys comprised the greatest proportion of total Se. Conversely, cardiac and skeletal muscle (longissimus dorsi and psoas major) tissues had lower total Se concentration (10.80, 7.02 and 7.82 mg Se per kg DM, respectively) and SeMet was the predominant selenised amino acid. Rates of Se clearance in HSY liver (307 \u03bcg Se per day) and kidney (238 \u03bcg Se per day) were higher compared with HSY cardiac tissue (120 \u03bcg Se per day) and skeletal muscle (20 \u03bcg Se per day).

Severe cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular dysfunction were observed in Ang II-infused Adipo-KO mice compared to WT mice. Adenovirus-mediated adiponectin treatment improved the above phenotypes and the dysregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related mRNAs in Adipo-KO mice, whereas such amelioration was not observed in PPAR-alpha-KO mice despite adiponectin accumulation in heart tissue. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, adiponectin improved the reduction of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and elevation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity induced by Ang II. Adiponectin significantly enhanced PPAR-alpha activity, whereas the adiponectin-dependent PPAR-alpha activation was diminished by Compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK.\nThe present study suggests that adiponectin protects against Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis possibly through AMPK-dependent PPAR-alpha activation.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2008-03-01", "authors": ["KoichiFujita", "NorikazuMaeda", "MinaSonoda", "KojiOhashi", "ToshiyukiHibuse", "HitoshiNishizawa", "MakotoNishida", "AkiHiuge", "AkifumiKurata", "ShinjiKihara", "IichiroShimomura", "TohruFunahashi"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.156687"}

Here we report the cloning of an ortholog of CYP1B1 from zebrafish and the demonstration that transcription of zebrafish CYP1B1 was modulated by two types of mechanisms during different developmental stage. First in late pharyngula stage before hatching, CYP1B1 was constitutively transcribed in retina, midbrain-hindbrain boundary and diencephalon regions through a close coordination between aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (AHR2)-dependent and AHR2-independent pathways. After hatching, the basal transcription was attenuated and it could not be elicited upon 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure. In contrast, TCDD exposure induced de novo CYP1B1 transcription in larval branchial arches and heart tissues via an AHR2-dependent pathway. Blocking AHR2 translation completely eliminated the TCDD-mediated CYP1B1 transcription. However, we did not detect any types of CYP1B1 transcription in liver and kidney tissues through the developmental stage. It suggests that the constitutive and TCDD-inducible types of CYP1B1 transcriptions are modulated by distinct pathways with different tissue specificities. Finally, we investigated the role of CYP1B1 in TCDD-mediated embryonic toxicity. Because knockdown of CYP1B1 did not prevent TCDD-induced pericardial edema and cranial defects, it suggests that CYP1B1 is not involved in the developmental toxicity of dioxin.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2008-03-01", "authors": ["Hou-ChuYin", "Hua-PinTseng", "Hsin-YuChung", "Chin-YiKo", "Wen-ShyongTzou", "Donald RBuhler", "Chin-HwaHu"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfn035"}

The purpose of this review is to show the results of cryoablation in the literature in order to understand when it can be used in children as an alternative to radiofrequency ablation.\nModified cryoablation protocols have increased acute success rates and decreased recurrences. Single institutions, comparing the results obtained with cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias, have demonstrated the same success rate. Furthermore, some authors have attempted to identify parameters predictive of efficacy during cryoablation of atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia.\nOn the basis of the more recent literature data, cryoablation should be considered the treatment of choice for atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia and atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia caused by an accessory pathway very close to the atrioventricular junction in school-age children.

A candidate cardiovascular-fate inducer is the bHLH transcription factor MesP1. As one of the earliest markers, it is expressed specifically in almost all cardiovascular precursors and is required for cardiac morphogenesis. Here we show that MesP1 is a key factor sufficient to induce the formation of ectopic heart tissue in vertebrates and increase cardiovasculogenesis by ES cells. Electrophysiological analysis showed all subtypes of cardiac ES-cell differentiation. MesP1 overexpression and knockdown experiments revealed a prominent function of MesP1 in a gene regulatory cascade, causing Dkk-1-mediated blockade of canonical Wnt-signalling. Independent evidence from ChIP and in vitro DNA-binding studies, expression analysis in wild-type and MesP knockout mice, and reporter assays confirm that Dkk-1 is a direct target of MesP1. Further analysis of the regulatory networks involving MesP1 will be required to preprogramme ES cells towards a cardiovascular fate for cell therapy and cardiovascular tissue engineering.

However, the physiological importance of dopamine receptors in the homeostatic regulation of cardiac function is unclear. In this study, a model of ischaemia/reperfusion was established by culturing primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in ischaemia-mimetic solution for 2 hr, followed by incubation in normal culture medium for 24 hr. Lactate dehydrogenase activity, superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde content were determined colorimetrically with a spectrophotometer. Apoptotic cell death was assayed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling staining and flow cytometry, and morphological alterations were observed with transmission electron microscopy. The intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Finally, the expression of dopamine receptor 1 (DR1), caspase-3, -8 and -9, Fas, Fas ligand and Bcl-2 and the release of cytochrome c were analysed by Western blot. The results showed that DR1 expression was increased markedly during ischaemia/reperfusion. Treatment with 10 microM SKF-38393 (DR1 agonist) significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase activity, decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased malondialdehyde content in the culture medium. The DR1 agonist promoted the release of cytochrome c, accumulation of [Ca2+]i, and apoptosis induced by ischaemia/reperfusion. Furthermore, SKF-38393 up-regulated the expression of caspase-3, -8 and -9, Fas and Fas ligand, and down-regulated Bcl-2 expression. In contrast, 10 microM SCH-23390 (DR1 antagonist) had no significant effects on the above indicators.

These data challenge the paradigm that increases in PPARalpha prompt the postnatal metabolic switch, and suggest that other nuclear receptors play a major role.

We hypothesized that burn size correlates with the extent of cardiac inflammatory response/contractile dysfunction. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided to receive anesthesia, a 3-degree burn covering 20%, 30%, 40%, or 60% total body surface area (TBSA) plus fluid resuscitation (lactated Ringer, 4 mL/kg per percent burn); sham burn animals were included as controls. There were seven rats in each group. Rats were euthanized Twenty-four h postburn, and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were measured in the plasma and in supernatant from isolated cardiac myocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, left ventricular function (Langendorff) was studied in vitro, and troponin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There were progressive, statistically significant increases in plasma and myocyte inflammatory cytokine levels, as well as plasma troponin with increasing burn size. Similarly, left ventricular pressure (in millimeters of mercury) and +/-dP/dtmax (in millimeters of mercury per second) progressively fell with increasing burn size. However, myocardial contractile depression induced by 60% TBSA burn was similar to that produced by 40% TBSA burn. These data suggest that the degree of inflammatory response, cardiac tissue injury, and myocardial contractile depression were correlated directly with the percent TBSA burn. However, unlike inflammation and cardiac tissue damage, myocardial contractile depression reached a plateau, with maximal myocardial contraction and relaxation defects observed at 40% TBSA burn, which were not further aggravated by a larger (60%) burn.", "journal": "Shock (Augusta, Ga.)", "date": "2008-02-19", "authors": ["Robert CBarber", "David LMaass", "D JeanWhite", "Jureta WHorton"], "doi": "10.1097/SHK.0b013e318164f1cd"}

A large number of inherited mutations lead to amyloid diseases by accelerating TTR deposition in other organs. Amyloid formation is preceded by a disruption of the quaternary structure of TTR and conformational changes in the monomer. To study conformational changes preceding the formation of amyloid, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type monomer, amyloidogenic variants (V30M, L55P, V122I) and a protective variant (T119M) at neutral and low pH. At low pH, the D strand dissociated from the beta-sheet to expose the A strand, consistent with experimental studies. In amyloidogenic variants and in the wild-type at low pH, there was a conformational change in the beta-sheets into alpha-sheet via peptide bond flips that was not observed at neutral pH in the wild-type monomer. The same residues participated in conversion in each amyloidogenic variant simulation, originating in the G strand between residues 106 and 109, with accelerated conversion at low pH. The T119M protective variant changed the local conformation of the H strand and suppressed the conversion observed in amyloidogenic variants.", "journal": "Protein engineering, design & selection : PEDS", "date": "2008-02-16", "authors": ["Robert ESteward", "Roger SArmen", "ValerieDaggett"], "doi": "10.1093/protein/gzm086"}

It is a leading cause of neonatal loss, especially in infants diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a condition where the left side of the heart including the aorta, aortic valve, left ventricle (LV) and mitral valve are underdeveloped. The molecular causes of HLHS are unclear, but the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1 (Hand1), may be a candidate culprit for this condition. The absence of Hand1 in mice resulted in the failure of rightward looping of the heart tube, a severely hypoplastic LV and outflow tract abnormalities. Nonetheless, no HAND1 mutations associated with human CHD have been reported so far. We sequenced the human HAND1 gene in heart tissues derived from 31 unrelated patients diagnosed with hypoplastic hearts. We detected in 24 of 31 hypoplastic ventricles, a common frameshift mutation (A126fs) in the bHLH domain, which is necessary for DNA binding and combinatorial interactions. The resulting mutant protein, unlike wild-type (wt) HAND1, was unable to modulate transcription of reporter constructs containing specific DNA-binding sites.

A peristaltic pump is utilized for fluid delivery and vacuum for fluid aspiration. Oxygen saturation, pH, and temperature are regulated for the media while temperature is regulated within the micro-incubator, fluid reservoir, and oxygenation chamber. Validation of the perfusion system was carried out using primary cardiac myocytes, isolated from 2- to 3-day-old neonatal rat hearts, plated on collagen-coated tissue culture plates. Two million cells/plate were used and the perfusion system was run for 1 h (without the need for a cell culture incubator) while controls were maintained in a standard cell culture incubator. We evaluated the cell viability, cell adhesion, total protein, total RNA, and changes in the expression of SERCA2 and phospholamban using RT-PCR, with N = 6 for each group.

We report the design, fabrication, and validation of a novel plunge electrode array capable of addressing this issue. A new technique involving nylon coating of 24G hypodermic needles is performed to achieve nonconductive electrodes that can be combined to give moderate-density multisite intramural measurement of extracellular potential in the heart. Each needle houses 13 silver wires within a total diameter of 0.7 mm, and the combined electrode array gives 137 sites of recording. The ability of the electrode array to accurately assess conductances is validated by mapping the potential field induced by a point current source within baths of saline of varying concentration.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects of PNS against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and its possible influence on the anti-tumor activity of doxorubicin. Five groups of ICR mice were treated with saline (control group), doxorubicin alone (20 mg/kg I. P.), PNS alone, doxorubicin pretreated with PNS (100 mg/kg I. G. for 5 consecutive days) or amifostine (single dose of 200 mg/kg I. V., used as positive control). After 72 h of doxorubicin treatment, cardiac function, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and activities of antioxidant enzymes in heart tissue were measured. Pretreatment with PNS significantly protected the mice from DOX-induced cardiotoxicity as evidenced from improved ventricular contractile function, lower levels of serum LDH, CK and CK-MB, minimal morphological changes in hearts, and normalization of myocardial superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities.

To better understand the effect of this treatment on cellular lipids, the influence of pyridine exposure (100 mg/kg/day i.p. for 5 days) on fatty acids, fatty esters, and fatty alcohol ethers in brain, heart, liver, and adipose tissue from male Swiss Webster mice was investigated. Lipid levels in cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free fatty acids, cardiolipin, sphingomyelin, and glycerylphospholipids were quantified. Pyridine altered the level and composition of lipids involved in membrane structure (i.e., sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamines, and plasmalogens), energy metabolism (i.e., free fatty acids), and long-chain fatty acid transport (i.e., cholesterol esters) in a tissue-specific manner. Subtle changes in cholesterol esters were observed in all tissues. Sphingomyelin in the brain and heart were depleted in monounsaturated fatty acids (1.4- and 1.5-fold, respectively), while the liver sphingomyelin concentrations increased (1.5-fold). Pyridine exposure also increased heart free fatty acids by 1.3-fold, enriched cardiac phosphatidylethanolamine in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by 1.3-fold, and depleted cardiolipin-associated plasmalogens by 3.8-fold. Phosphatidylethanolamines in the brain were also enriched in both saturated fatty acids (1.2-fold) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (1.3-fold) but were depleted in plasmalogens (2.9-fold). In particular, the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine-associated arachidonic (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in both brain and cardiac tissues significantly decreased following pyridine exposure.

However, recent evidence suggests that this type of response may also be triggered by cardiac overload after birth. In congenital heart disease, loading conditions are frequently abnormal, thereby affecting ventricular function. We hypothesized that chronic right ventricular pressure overload imposed on neonatal hearts initiates a hyperplastic response in the right ventricular myocardium. To test this, young lambs (aged 2-3 weeks) underwent adjustable pulmonary artery banding to obtain peak right ventricular pressures equal to left ventricular pressures for 8 weeks. Transmural cardiac tissue samples from the right and left ventricles of five banded and five age-matched control animals were studied. We found that chronic right ventricular pressure overload resulted in a twofold increase in right-to-left ventricle wall thickness ratio. Morphometric right ventricular myocardial tissue analysis revealed no changes in tissue composition between the two groups; nor were right ventricular myocyte dimensions, relative number of binucleated myocytes, or myocardial DNA concentration significantly different from control values. In chronic pressure overloaded right ventricular myocardium, significantly (P < 0.01) more myocyte nuclei were positive for the proliferation marker proliferating cellular nuclear antigen than in control right ventricular myocardium.

At the tissue level, Mg(2+) loss progresses over time and affects predominantly heart, liver and skeletal muscles. In the present study, alterations in Mg(2+) homeostasis and transport in diabetic cardiac ventricular myocytes were evaluated. Cardiac tissue and isolated cardiac ventricular myocytes from diabetic animals displayed a decrease in total Mg(2+) content that affected all cellular compartments. This decrease was associated with a marked reduction in cellular protein and ATP content. Diabetic ventricular myocytes were unable to mobilize Mg(2+) following beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation or addition of cell permeant cyclic-AMP. Sarcolemma vesicles purified from diabetic animals, however, transported Mg(2+) normally as compared to vesicles from non-diabetic animals. Treatment of diabetic animals with exogenous insulin for 2 weeks restored ATP and protein levels as well as Mg(2+) homeostasis and transport to levels comparable to those observed in non-diabetic animals. These results suggest that in diabetic cardiac cells Mg(2+) homeostasis and extrusion via beta-adrenergic/cAMP signaling are markedly affected by the concomitant decrease in protein and ATP content. As Mg(2+) regulates numerous cellular enzymes and functions, including protein synthesis, these results provide a new rationale to interpret some aspects of the cardiac dysfunctions observed under diabetic conditions.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2008-02-06", "authors": ["GrantReed", "ChristieCefaratti", "Liliana NBerti-Mattera", "AndreaRomani"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.21690"}

Alternans, a beat-to-beat alternation in the action potential duration (APD) and intracellular Ca (Cai), can arise from either tissue heterogeneities or dynamic factors. Distinguishing between these mechanisms in normal cardiac tissue is difficult because of inherent complex three-dimensional tissue heterogeneities. To evaluate repolarization alternans in a simpler two-dimensional cardiac substrate, we optically recorded voltage and/or Cai in monolayers of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes during rapid pacing, before and after exposure to BAY K 8644 to enhance dynamic factors promoting alternans. Under control conditions (n = 37), rapid pacing caused detectable APD alternans in 81% of monolayers, and Cai transient alternans in all monolayers, becoming spatially discordant in 62%. After BAY K 8644 (n = 28), conduction velocity restitution became more prominent, and APD and Cai alternans developed and became spatially discordant in all monolayers, with an increased number of nodal lines separating out-of-phase alternating regions. Nodal lines moved closer to the pacing site with faster pacing rates and changed orientation when the pacing site was moved, as predicted for the dynamically generated, but not heterogeneity-based, alternans. Spatial APD gradients during spatially discordant alternans were sufficiently steep to induce conduction block and reentry. These findings indicate that spatially discordant alternans severe enough to initiate reentry can be readily induced by pacing in two-dimensional cardiac tissue and behaves according to predictions for a predominantly dynamically generated mechanism.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

PDL1 but not PDL2 blockade significantly accelerated cardiac allograft rejection in the bm12-into-B6 and B6-into-bm12 models. Although wild-type cardiac allografts survived long term, PDL1-/- donor hearts transplanted into wild-type bm12 mice exhibited accelerated rejection and vasculopathy associated with enhanced recipient T-cell alloreactivity.

Using chimeric animals as donors, we show that PDL1 expression on cardiac tissue alone significantly prolonged graft survival compared with full PDL1-/- donor grafts in transplanted wild-type recipients.\nThis is the first report to demonstrate that expression of the negative costimulatory molecule PDL1 on donor cardiac tissue regulates recipient alloimmune responses, allograft rejection, and vasculopathy.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2008-01-24", "authors": ["JunYang", "JoycePopoola", "ShakilaKhandwala", "NidyanandhVadivel", "VijayVanguri", "XueliYuan", "ShirineDada", "IndiraGuleria", "ChaoruiTian", "M JaveedAnsari", "TahiroShin", "HideoYagita", "MiyukiAzuma", "Mohamed HSayegh", "AnilChandraker"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.741025"}
{"title": "Generation and escape of local waves from the boundary of uncoupled cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "We aim to understand the formation of abnormal waves of activity from myocardial regions with diminished cell-to-cell coupling. En route to this goal, we studied the behavior of a heterogeneous myocyte network in which a sharp coupling gradient was placed under conditions of increasing network automaticity. Experiments were conducted in monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes using heptanol and isoproterenol as means of altering cell-to-cell coupling and automaticity, respectively. Experimental findings were explained and expanded using a modified Beeler-Reuter numerical model. The data suggest that the combination of a heterogeneous substrate, a gradient of coupling, and an increase in oscillatory activity of individual cells creates a rich set of behaviors associated with self-generated spiral waves and ectopic sources. Spiral waves feature a flattened shape and a pin-unpin drift type of tip motion. These intercellular waves are action-potential based and can be visualized with either voltage or calcium transient measurements. A source/load mismatch on the interface between the boundary and well-coupled layers can lock wavefronts emanating from both ectopic sources and rotating waves within the inner layers of the coupling gradient. A numerical approach allowed us to explore how 1), the spatial distribution of cells, 2), the amplitude and dispersion of cell automaticity, and 3), the speed at which the coupling gradient moves in space affect wave behavior, including its escape into well-coupled tissue.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2008-01-24", "authors": ["Vadim NBiktashev", "AraArutunyan", "Narine ASarvazyan"], "doi": "10.1529/biophysj.107.117630"}
{"title": "Adenosine A2A receptor signaling regulation of cardiac NADPH oxidase activity.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissues express constitutively an NADPH oxidase, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is involved in redox signaling. Myocardial metabolism generates abundant adenosine, which binds to its receptors and plays important roles in cardiac function. The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) has been found to be expressed in cardiac myocytes and coronary endothelial cells. However, the role of the A2AR in the regulation of cardiac ROS production remains unknown. We found that knockout of A2AR significantly decreased (39+/-8%) NADPH-dependent O2- production in mouse hearts compared to age (10 weeks)-matched wild-type controls. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in Nox2 (a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase) protein expression, and down-regulation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and JNK phosphorylation (all P<0.05). In wild-type mice, intraperitoneal injection of the selective A2AR antagonist SCH58261 (3-10 mg/kg body weight for 90 min) inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox (a regulatory subunit of Nox2), which was accompanied by a down-regulated cardiac ROS production (48+/-8%), and decreased JNK and ERK1/2 activation by 54+/-28% (all P<0.05). In conclusion, A2AR through MAPK signaling regulates p47phox phosphorylation and cardiac ROS production by NADPH oxidase.

{"title": "Forkhead transcription factors coordinate expression of myocardial KATP channel subunits and energy metabolism.", "abstract": "Coordinate adaptation of myocyte metabolism and function is fundamental to survival of the stressed heart, but the mechanisms for this coordination remain unclear. Bioinformatics led us to discover that Foxs are key transcription factors involved. We performed experiments on the mouse atrial cell line HL-1, neonate rat heart myocytes, and an adult rat model of myocardial infarction. In electrophoretic mobility-shift assays, FoxO1 binds to the FoxO concensus site of the KATP channel subunit KIR6.1 promoter. In primary atrial culture, targeting FoxO1 and FoxO3 with siRNA specifically reduces mRNA expression of FoxO1 and -O3 and KIR6.1. Western blots, confocal immunofluorescence, and quantitative RT-PCR was applied for measuring expression of 10 Fox, 6 KATP channel subunits, and 12 metabolic genes. FoxF2, -O1, and -O3 strongly associate with expression of KATP channel subunits (in particular, KIR6.1, SUR1A and SUR2B) in different heart tissues and in the periinfarct zone of the left ventricle. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that molecular plasticity of these channels is matched by pharmacological plasticity and increased sensitivity to a metabolic challenge mimicked by the protonophore CCCP. A balance of FoxF2 and FoxO also regulates expression of at least 9 metabolic genes involved in setting the balance of glycolysis and beta-oxidation. Bioinformatics shows that the transcriptional mechanisms are highly conserved among chicken, mouse, rat, and human, and Fox are intimately linked to other metabolic sensors.

All quercetin treatment groups produced increases in the GSH:GSSG ratio and decreases in mixed disulfide levels in hepatic tissue. Cardiac tissue did not change in response to dietary quercetin; however, cardiac mitochondria demonstrated a reduction in the GSH:GSSG ratio and an increase in protein mixed disulfide levels. No significant changes were observed in the plasma GSH:GSSG ratio, but mixed disulfide levels were decreased for all of the diets. The changes in plasma redox status did not parallel the changes in the tissues. Onion fed mice demonstrated the greatest increases in GSH:GSSG ratios and the greatest decreases in protein mixed disulfide levels of all diets compared. For all treatment groups, increases in the GSH:GSSG ratios corresponded with decreases in protein mixed disulfide levels.

The present study has been carried out to investigate the protective role of a triterpenoid saponin, arjunolic acid (AA) against arsenic-induced cardiac oxidative damage. In the study, NaAsO2 was chosen as the source of arsenic. The free radical scavenging activity and the effect of AA on the intracellular antioxidant power were determined from its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical scavenging ability and ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay, respectively. Oral administration of NaAsO2 at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 2 days caused significant accumulation of arsenic in cardiac tissues of the experimental mice in association with the reduction in cardiac antioxidant enzymes activities, namely superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase. Arsenic intoxication also decreased the cardiac glutathione (GSH) and total thiol contents and increased the levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation end products and protein carbonyl content. Treatment with AA at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight for 4 days prior to NaAsO2 intoxication protected the cardiac tissue from arsenic-induced oxidative impairment. In addition to oxidative stress, arsenic administration increased total cholesterol level as well as the reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the sera of the experimental mice. AA pretreatment, however, could prevent this hyperlipidemia. Histological studies on the ultrastructural changes in cardiac tissue supported the protective activity of AA also.

Expression of the genes coding for hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1), HAS2, HAS3, CD44, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) and the histological evidence for increases of HA and CD44 were investigated in an experimental rat model of cardiac hypertrophy. The abdominal aorta was ligated to induce cardiac hypertrophy, and mRNAs prepared from heart tissue were analyzed after 1, 6, and 42 days. The total concentration of HA was quantified, and HA and CD44 were studied histochemically. The expression of HAS1, HAS2, CD44, and FGF-2 was considerably up-regulated at days 1 and 6 and returned to basal levels after 42 days. FGFR-1 was up-regulated at day 1 but at basal levels once more at days 6 and 42. The concentration of HA significantly increased in aorta-ligated rats. Histochemical analysis showed increased expression of CD44 in hypertrophied myocardium mainly in and around the coronary arteries. These results agree well with other studies of tissue growth (malignancies and wound healing). The increase of HA, its synthases, and receptor in parallel with FGF-2 and its receptor illustrates their complicated interplay in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.

We have previously reported the presence of sulfate groups in the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of this domain. In order to evaluate the immune responses to sulfated moieties on Cz, BALB/c mice were immunized with purified Cz and C-T prior and after desulfation treatment. The humoral immune response to sulfates on Cz or C-T was mainly IgG2b. Interestingly, the abolishment of IgG2b reactivity when desulfated antigens were used as immunogens demonstrates that esterified sulfate groups are absolutely required for eliciting IgG2b response to Cz. Sera from chronically T. cruzi-infected subjects with mild disease displayed higher levels of total IgG and IgG2 antibodies specific for sulfated epitopes compared with those in more severe forms of the disease. A significant reduction of C-T-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in C-T-immunized mice was observed when desulfated C-T was challenged, suggesting the involvement of sulfate groups in the generation of memory T-cell responses. Moreover, immunization with C-T in the absence of infection elicited ultrastructural abnormalities in heart tissue. Surprisingly, hearts from sulfate-depleted C-T-immunized mice did not present pathological alterations. This is the first report showing that sulfate-bearing glycoproteins from trypanosomatids are able to elicit specific humoral and cellular immune responses and appeared to be involved in the generation of heart tissue damage.

As an extracellular pathogen, B. burgdorferi resides primarily in the ECM and connective tissues and between host cells during mammalian infection. The interactions of B. burgdorferi with these host ligands mediated by DbpA and DbpB potentially influence various aspects of infection. Here, we show that both DbpA and DbpB are critical for the overall virulence of B. burgdorferi in the murine host. Disruption of the dbpBA locus led to nearly a 10(4)-fold increase in the 50% infectious dose (ID50). Complementation of the mutant with either dbpA or dbpB reduced the ID50 from over 10(4) to roughly 10(3) organisms. Deletion of the dbpBA locus affected colonization in all tissues of infected mice. The lack of dbpA alone precluded the pathogen from colonizing the heart tissue, and B. burgdorferi deficient for DbpB was recovered only from 42% of the heart specimens of infected mice. Although B. burgdorferi lacking either dbpA or dbpB was consistently grown from joint specimens of almost all infected mice, it generated bacterial loads significantly lower than the control. The deficiency in either DbpA or DbpB did not reduce the bacterial load in skin, but lack of both significantly did.

It has mild vasodilating properties attributed to its interaction with the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway, a property not shared by other BBs. Carvedilol is a nonselective ss-adrenergic receptor antagonist that also blocks alpha1-adrenergic receptors and is a potent antioxidant. Anthracyclines (ANTs), daunorubicin and doxorubicin, are commonly used in the treatment of several tumours, but their cardiac toxicity prevents their use at maximum myelotoxic doses, representing an important problem. In this study, we have evaluated the role of these BBs administered in combination with ANTs (daunorubicin and doxorubicin) on a reduction in cardiac toxicity. The combination of BB and ANTs has reduced the release of GSSG and GSH; in particular, co-treatment with nebivolol to ANTs has shown a significant reduction. The total integrated creatine kinase and troponin T activities were improved by BB and ANTs co-treatment. A significant reduction of their release was observed when hearts were treated with nebivolol. Cardiac tissue activity of gluthatione reductase was not significant and similar among experimental groups. In contrast, gluthatione peroxidise, Mn-superoxide dismutase and nitrite/nitrate release were increased after co-treatment with nebivolol. Finally, three parameters have been used to evaluate the cardiac toxicity of ANTs: the left ventricular pressure developed under a constant perfusion pressure (LVDP), the rate of variation of this parameter during systole (contractility) (LV/dt)max and during diastole (relaxation) (LV(dP/dt)min.

To accomplish this goal, isolated, perfused hearts from alpha-CGRP knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 5, 15, and 30 min of reperfusion. Cardiac functional parameters, including coronary flow rates, left ventricular developed pressure, maximum rates of pressure development, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, were measured before and after I/R injury, as were levels of creatine kinase, to assess myocardial damage, and malonaldehyde, to assess oxidative stress. Following I/R injury, cardiac performance was significantly reduced in the hearts from the alpha-CGRP KO mice compared with their WT counterparts. The marked reduction in myocardial function in the alpha-CGRP KO hearts compared with WT hearts after I/R injury was associated with a significant elevation in creatine kinase release into the perfusates and malonaldehyde production in the cardiac tissue.

The challenge is to alter differentiation toward functional cell types or tissues by directing ES cells to a specific fate. Efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms that are required for the formation of the different germ layers and tissues from ES cells, and these mechanisms appear to be very similar in the mouse embryo. Differentiation toward mesoderm and mesoderm derivatives such as cardiac tissue or hemangioblasts has been demonstrated; however, the roles of Activin A/Nodal, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in the early patterning of ES cell-derived pan-mesoderm and anterior visceral endoderm (aVE) have not been reported yet. We therefore analyzed the roles of Activin A/Nodal, BMP, and FGF signaling in the patterning of ES cell-derived mesoderm as well as specification of the aVE by using a dual ES cell differentiation system combining a loss-of-function with a gain-of-function approach. We found that Activin A or Nodal directed the nascent mesoderm toward axial mesoderm and mesendoderm, while Bmp4 was inducing posterior and extraembryonic mesoderm at the expense of anterior primitive streak cells. FGF signaling appeared to have an important role in mesoderm differentiation by allowing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of the newly formed mesoderm cells that would lead to their further patterning. Moreover, inhibition of FGF signaling resulted in increased expression of axial mesoderm markers.

{"title": "Effects of duramycin on cardiac voltage-gated ion channels.", "abstract": "The amphipathic peptide duramycin is in clinical development for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. It is deposited in cellular membranes where it binds to phosphatidylethanolamine. Duramycin may thereby change the biophysical membrane properties and perturb the function of ion channels. If so, in heart tissue, its application carries the risk to elicit cardiac arrhythmias. In fact, premature ventricular complexes were observed in the electrocardiogram during toxicological testing in dogs. To study the arrhythmogenic potential of duramycin, we investigated its effects on currents through voltage-gated hERG potassium, sodium, and calcium channels in native cells, and using a heterologous expression system, by means of the whole-cell patch clamp technique; duramycin bath concentrations between 1 nM and 0.1 microM did not generate any effects on these currents. Concentrations >or=0.3 microM, however, reduced the amplitudes of all investigated currents. Moreover, sodium current fast inactivation kinetics was slowed in the presence of duramycin. A further rise in duramycin bath concentration (>or=3.3 microM) induced a leak current consistent with pore formation. The reported effects of duramycin on ion channel function are likely to arise from a change in the biophysical properties of the membrane rather than from a specific interaction of the peptide with ion channel proteins. Under therapeutic conditions (i.e., administration via inhalation), duramycin plasma concentrations are below 0.5 nM.

The treatment group was exposed to EMR in a frequency of 900 MHz, the EMR plus vitamin C group was exposed to the same EMR frequency and given vitamin C (250 mg/kg/day) orally for 4 weeks. There were 10 animals in each group including control and vitamin C groups. At the end of the study period, blood samples were obtained from the animals to get erythrocyte sediments. Then the animals were sacrificed and heart, kidney, liver, and ovary tissues were removed. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), xanthine oxidase (XO), and adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme activities were measured in the tissues and erythrocytes. It was observed that MDA level, XO, and GSH-Px activities significantly increased in the EMR group as compared with those of the control group in the erythrocytes. In the kidney tissues, it was found that MDA level and CAT activity significantly increased, whereas XO and ADA activities decreased in the cellular phone group as compared with those of the control group. However, in the heart tissues it was observed that MDA level, ADA, and XO activities significantly decreased in the cellular phone group as compared with those of the control group. The results suggest that EMR at the frequency generated by a cell phone causes oxidative stress and peroxidation in the erythrocytes and kidney tissues from rats. In the erythrocytes, vitamin C seems to make partial protection against the oxidant stress.", "journal": "Toxicology mechanisms and methods", "date": "2008-01-01", "authors": ["Erdin\u00e7Devrim", "Imge BErg\u00fcder", "B\u00fclentK\u0131l\u0131\u00e7o\u011flu", "EmineYayka\u015fl\u0131", "RecepCetin", "IlkerDurak"], "doi": "10.1080/15376510701380182"}
{"title": "Assessment of hyperbolic heat transfer equation in theoretical modeling for radiofrequency heating techniques.", "abstract": "Theoretical modeling is a technique widely used to study the electrical-thermal performance of different surgical procedures based on tissue heating by use of radiofrequency (RF) currents. Most models employ a parabolic heat transfer equation (PHTE) based on Fourier's theory, which assumes an infinite propagation speed of thermal energy. We recently proposed a one-dimensional model in which the electrical-thermal coupled problem was analytically solved by using a hyperbolic heat transfer equation (HHTE), i.e. by considering a non zero thermal relaxation time. In this study, we particularized this solution to three typical examples of RF heating of biological tissues: heating of the cornea for refractive surgery, cardiac ablation for eliminating arrhythmias, and hepatic ablation for destroying tumors. A comparison was made of the PHTE and HHTE solutions. The differences between their temperature profiles were found to be higher for lower times and shorter distances from the electrode surface. Our results therefore suggest that HHTE should be considered for RF heating of the cornea (which requires very small electrodes and a heating time of 0.6 s), and for rapid ablations in cardiac tissue (less than 30 s).", "journal": "The open biomedical engineering journal", "date": "2008-01-01", "authors": ["Juan AL\u00f3pez-Molina", "Maria JRivera", "MacarenaTrujillo", "FernandoBurd\u00edo", "Juan LLequerica", "FernandoHornero", "Enrique JBerjano"], "doi": "10.2174/1874120700802010022"}

{"title": "Modifying L-type calcium current kinetics: consequences for cardiac excitation and arrhythmia dynamics.", "abstract": "The L-type Ca current (I(Ca,L)), essential for normal cardiac function, also regulates dynamic action potential (AP) properties that promote ventricular fibrillation. Blocking I(Ca,L) can prevent ventricular fibrillation, but only at levels suppressing contractility. We speculated that, instead of blocking I(Ca,L), modifying its shape by altering kinetic features could produce equivalent anti-fibrillatory effects without depressing contractility. To test this concept experimentally, we overexpressed a mutant Ca-insensitive calmodulin (CaM(1234)) in rabbit ventricular myocytes to inhibit Ca-dependent I(Ca,L) inactivation, combined with the ATP-sensitive K current agonist pinacidil or I(Ca,L) blocker verapamil to maintain AP duration (APD) near control levels. Cell shortening was enhanced in pinacidil-treated myocytes, but depressed in verapamil-treated myocytes. Both combinations flattened APD restitution slope and prevented APD alternans, similar to I(Ca,L) blockade. To predict the arrhythmogenic consequences, we simulated the cellular effects using a new AP model, which reproduced flattening of APD restitution slope and prevention of APD/Ca(i) transient alternans but maintained a normal Ca(i) transient. In simulated two-dimensional cardiac tissue, these changes prevented the arrhythmogenic spatially discordant APD/Ca(i) transient alternans and spiral wave breakup. These findings provide a proof-of-concept test that I(Ca,L) can be targeted to increase dynamic wave stability without depressing contractility, which may have promise as an antifibrillatory strategy.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2007-12-28", "authors": ["AmanMahajan", "DaisukeSato", "YohannesShiferaw", "AliBaher", "Lai-HuaXie", "RobertPeralta", "RiccardoOlcese", "AlanGarfinkel", "ZhilinQu", "James NWeiss"], "doi": "10.1529/biophysj.106.98590"}

The MRL/MpJ [Murphy Roths large (MRL) derived by the Murphy group of the Jackson Laboratory (MpJ)] mouse, however, has been reported to exhibit minimal scarring and subsequent cardiac regeneration after cryoinjury of the right ventricle. Other groups have reported that permanent and temporary ligation of the coronary artery resulted in scarring without regeneration.\nTo clarify these contradictory results, we studied the temporal evolution of infarcts in MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6 control mice from 1 to 90 days post injury and the effects of intrathoracic cryoinjury to 28 days.\nAfter infarction, the conversion from necrotic myocardium to granulation tissue and then to scar proceeded identically in the two groups. Infarct DNA synthesis, measured by incorporation of a 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine pulse, peaked at 4 days in both strains and did not differ between strains at any time point. Endothelial cell and total vascular density in the both the infarcted and noninfarcted cardiac tissue did not differ between groups at any time. Histological analysis of directly cryoinjured right and left ventricular myocardium showed indistinguishable wound healing in both strains, and final scar size was identical in each group.\nThese studies demonstrate that both myocardial infarcts and cryoinjuries in MRL/MpJ mice heal by typical scar formation rather than muscle regeneration, in a manner very similar to C57BL/6 controls.

CMPHs fed with an alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)-enriched diet (CMPH/FS) display an extended longevity compared to those fed with a standard diet (CMPH/PT) owing to, among others, the amelioration of both cardiac tissue structure and myocardial function. The present investigation was aimed at evaluating whether and to what extent the ALA-enriched diet affects the remodeling of CMPH cardiomyocyte intercalated disks and the expression of molecules, including N-cadherin, catenins and connexin 43 (CX43), involved in their organization. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression of N-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin is significantly reduced in cardiomyocyte intercalated disks of CMPH/FS vs. CMPH/PT and is lowered to levels similar to those found in healthy hamsters (GSH/PT), as well as transmission electron microscopy indicated that the cardiomyocyte intercalated disk ultrastructure is also re-established in CMPH/FS. In addition, the delocalization of CX43 as well as the presence of gap junctions were detectable at the lateral plasmamembrane of CMPH/FS cardiomyocytes, while the expression of myocardial CX43 was markedly reduced in both CMPH/PT and CMPH/FS, as compared to GSH/PT.

{"title": "Intracardiac lipid accumulation, lipoatrophy of muscle cells and expansion of myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic patients.", "abstract": "The overall mortality of diabetic patients after myocardial infarction is 3-4 times higher than non-diabetics. The cellular mechanisms underlying such a poor clinical prognosis remain incompletely understood. Recent reports suggest that lipotoxicity associated with impaired liporegulation is among the leading factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The goal of this study was to investigate whether excess lipid accumulation specifically in heart muscle cells contributes to the expansion of myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic patients. Comparative structural analysis of cardiac tissue was performed on autopsy samples from the infracted hearts of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals with special reference to the expansion of the infarction, degenerative changes, lipoatrophy, cell death, and replacement fibrosis. We found that progressive accumulation of lipids in cardiac myocytes was accompanied by considerable loss of myofibrils and was frequently observed in the heart tissue of type 2 diabetic patients. This indicates that disassembly of the contractile apparatus in the cells infiltrated with lipids weakens their capability for functional activity. Analysis of degenerative changes in the diabetic tissue has shown that lipid-laden cardiac myocytes were more susceptible to necrotic and apoptotic cells death leading to expansion of the infarction and the development of progressive focal replacement fibrosis both in the perinecrotic zone and in the areas located far from the site of injury. Our data show that lipoatrophy and loss of muscle cells during the post-infarction period aggravate the functional impairment in the diabetic heart and limits its adaptive capacity for compensatory remodeling. This suggests that lipotoxic myocardial injury associated with defects of lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes predisposes its evolution toward congestive heart failure and is an important factor contributing to a high mortality following infarction.", "journal": "Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)", "date": "2007-12-21", "authors": ["Andrei BBorisov", "Alexei VUshakov", "Aleksandr KZagorulko", "Nikolai YNovikov", "Ksenia FSelivanova", "Chris AEdwards", "Mark WRussell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micron.2007.11.002"}

Here, we have investigated the effects of propiverine on cardiac ion channels and action potentials as well as on contractile properties of cardiac tissue, in order to estimate its cardiac safety profile, because other drugs used in this indication had to be withdrawn due to safety reasons. Whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record the following cardiac ion currents: rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kr), I(Ks)), ultra rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kur)), inwardly rectifying K+ current I(K1), transient outward K+ current (I(to)), and L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca,L)). Action potentials in cardiac tissue biopsies were recorded with conventional microelectrodes. The torsade de pointes screening assay (TDPScreen) was used for drug scoring. Propiverine blocked in a concentration-dependent manner HERG channels expressed in HEK293 cells, as well as native I(Kr) current in ventricular myocytes of guinea pig (IC50 values: 10 microM and 1.8 microM respectively). At high concentrations (100 microM), propiverine suppressed I(Ks). I(K1) and the transient outward current I(to) and I(Kur) were not affected. In guinea-pig ventricular and human atrial myocytes, propiverine also blocked I(Ca,L) (IC50 values: 34.7 microM and 41.7 microM, respectively) and reduced force of contraction. Despite block of I(Kr), action potential duration was not prolonged in guinea-pig and human ventricular tissue, but decreased progressively until excitation failed altogether. Similar effects were observed in dog Purkinje fibers. Propiverine obtained a low score in the TDPScreen. In conclusion, in vitro and in vivo studies of propiverine do not provide evidence for an enhanced cardiovascular safety risk.

{"title": "Axonal alpha-synuclein aggregates herald centripetal degeneration of cardiac sympathetic nerve in Parkinson's disease.", "abstract": "Degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve occurs in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies and begins early in the disease progression of PD, accounting for reduced cardiac uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine even in the early stages of Lewy body disease (LBD). We previously demonstrated that degeneration of the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nerve precedes loss of their mother neurons in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia, suggesting distal dominant degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD. Because alpha-synuclein is one of the key molecules in the pathogenesis of this disease, we further investigated how alpha-synuclein aggregates are involved in this distal-dominant degeneration. Both cardiac tissues and paravertebral sympathetic ganglia were obtained for comparison from 20 patients with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), 10 with PD, 20 with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 10 control subjects. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as a marker for sympathetic nerves, phosphorylated neurofilament as a marker for axons and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein for pathological deposits. We found that (i) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles, namely the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nerve, were much more abundant in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons than in this disease with decreased TH-ir axons and PD; (ii) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles were closely related to the disappearance of TH-ir axons; (iii) in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons, alpha-synuclein aggregates were consistently more abundant in the epicardial nerve fascicles than in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia; (iv) this distal-dominant accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates was reversed in ILBD with decreased TH-ir axons and PD, which both showed fewer of these axons but more abundant alpha-synuclein aggregates in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and (v) MSA was completely different from ILBD and PD based on the preservation of TH-ir axons and the scarcity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in either the cardiac tissues or the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia. These findings indicate that accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system precedes that of neuronal somata or neurites in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and that heralds centripetal degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD, which sharply contrasts with slight changes in MSA.

Wistar Kyoto male rats were exposed to concentrated ambient particles (CAPs, 0.6-1.5mg/m3) in Yokohama for 4 days (4.5h/day) or to filtered air for 3 days and CAPs for 1 day or to filtered air for 4 days. Messenger RNA expression and cardiovascular function were measured after the 4-day exposure. In samples of heart tissue, the mRNAs of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1, a biomarker of exposure to chemicals; heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a marker of oxidative stress; and endothelin A (ET A) receptor, a receptor of vasoconstrictors, were up-regulated by CAPs; their levels were significantly correlated with the cumulative weight of CAPs in the exposure chamber. The up-regulation of ET A receptor mRNA was significantly correlated with the increase in HO-1 mRNA and weakly with the increase in mean blood pressure (Delta MBP). These results suggest the possibility that chemicals in CAPs might be translocated to the heart, where they induce oxidative stress and activate endothelin signaling, resulting in an increase in the blood pressure.

{"title": "Relaxin induces mast cell inhibition and reduces ventricular arrhythmias in a swine model of acute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Resident cardiac mast cells, located mainly around coronary vessels and in the right atrium close to the sinoatrial node, are the main repository of cardiac histamine. Inflammatory activation of cardiac mast cells, as occurs upon acute myocardial infarction, causes the release of histamine and prostanoids. These substances lead to severe tachyarrhythmias, cardiodepressive effects and coronary spasm, thus contributing to myocardial damage and early, lethal outcome. Relaxin, known to inhibit mast cell activation, has been recently validated as a cardiotropic hormone, being produced by the heart and acting on specific heart receptors. In this study, we report on a swine model of heart ischemia/reperfusion, currently used to test cardiotropic drugs, in which human recombinant relaxin (2.5 and 5 microg/kg b.w.), given at reperfusion upon a 30-min ischemia, markedly reduced cardiac injury as compared with the vehicle-treated animals. Evidence is provided that relaxin, at both the assayed doses, causes a clear-cut, significant reduction of plasma histamine, increase in cardiac histamine content and decrease in cardiac mast cell degranulation. This is accompanied by a reduction of oxidative cardiac tissue injury (assessed as tissue malondialdehyde) and of the occurrence of severe ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, this study provides further insight into the cardioprotective effects of relaxin, which also involve mast cell inhibition, and confirms the relevance of histamine in the pathophysiology of ischemia-reperfusion-induced cardiac injury and dysfunction. It also offers additional evidence for the potential therapeutic effects of relaxin in animal models of disease involving mast cell activation.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2007-12-11", "authors": ["SilviaNistri", "LorenzoCinci", "Avio-MariaPerna", "EmanuelaMasini", "RosannaMastroianni", "DanieleBani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2007.11.001"}

By administering nutritional supplements with replacement molecules and antioxidants, oxidative membrane damage and reductions of cofactors in normal tissues can be reversed, protecting and restoring mitochondrial and other cellular functions and reducing chemotherapy adverse effects. Recent clinical trials using cancer and non-cancer patients with chronic fatigue have shown the benefit of molecular replacement plus antioxidants in reducing the damage to mitochondrial membranes, restoring mitochondrial electron transport function, reducing fatigue and protecting cellular structures and enzymes from oxidative damage.

Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) are two endogenous ligands that activate adrenoceptor (AR) signals in a variety of physiological stress responses in animals. Here we use cardiomyocyte contraction rate response to analyze the endogenous beta(2)AR signaling induced by Epi or NE in cardiac tissue. The Epi-activated beta(2)AR induced a rapid contraction rate increase that peaked at 4 min after stimulation. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)AR induced a much slower contraction rate increase that peaked at 10 min after stimulation. Whereas both drugs activated beta(2)AR coupling to G(s) proteins, only Epi-activated receptors were capable of coupling to G(i) proteins. Subsequent studies showed that the Epi-activated beta(2)AR underwent a rapid phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and subsequent dephosphorylation on serine residues 355 and 356, which was critical for sufficient receptor recycling and G(i) coupling. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)ARs underwent slow GRK2 phosphorylation, receptor internalization and recycling, and failed to couple to G(i). Moreover, inhibiting beta(2)AR phosphorylation by betaARK C terminus or dephosphorylation by okadaic acid prevented sufficient recycling and G(i) coupling. Together, our data revealed that distinct temporal phosphorylation of beta(2)AR on serine 355 and 356 by GRK2 plays a critical role for dictating receptor cellular events and signaling properties induced by Epi or NE in cardiomyocytes.

To determine whether the adverse myopathic effects of Cz-based immunization could be prevented, we evaluated the co-administration of Cz with different adjuvants. Mice were immunized with Cz adjuvantized by alum (Cz+alum), oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (Cz+ODN-CpG) or Freund's preparation (Cz+CFA). Cz triggered a vigorous specific humoral response, irrespective of the adjuvant used. Alum mainly drove response towards Th2 phenotype, characterized by specific IgG1 antibodies and IL-10 induction, whereas Cz+ODN-CpG mice exhibited Th1-dominant immunity, with antibodies of the IgG2a isotype and enhanced IFN-gamma production. Histological examination of cardiac tissue demonstrated lesions in Cz+CFA but not in Cz+alum nor Cz+ODN-CpG immunized animals, suggesting that CFA is critical for Cz-mediated injury. Analysis of skeletal muscle revealed that mice receiving Cz+CFA exhibited disrupted and hyalinized myofibers, whereas [Cz+alum]-immunized animals showed hyalinization, architecture modifications and small inflammatory foci. Conversely, no abnormalities were observed in the striated muscle from the Cz+ODN-CpG group.

{"title": "The Friedreich ataxia GAA repeat expansion mutation induces comparable epigenetic changes in human and transgenic mouse brain and heart tissues.", "abstract": "Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a homozygous GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN gene, leading to reduced expression of frataxin protein. Evidence suggests that the mutation may induce epigenetic changes and heterochromatin formation, thereby impeding gene transcription. In particular, studies using FRDA patient blood and lymphoblastoid cell lines have detected increased DNA methylation of specific CpG sites upstream of the GAA repeat and histone modifications in regions flanking the GAA repeat. In this report we show that such epigenetic changes are also present in FRDA patient brain, cerebellum and heart tissues, the primary affected systems of the disorder. Bisulfite sequence analysis of the FXN flanking GAA regions reveals a shift in the FRDA DNA methylation profile, with upstream CpG sites becoming consistently hypermethylated and downstream CpG sites becoming consistently hypomethylated. We also identify differential DNA methylation at three specific CpG sites within the FXN promoter and one CpG site within exon 1. Furthermore, we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that there is overall decreased histone H3K9 acetylation together with increased H3K9 methylation of FRDA brain tissue. Further studies of brain, cerebellum and heart tissues from our GAA repeat expansion-containing FRDA YAC transgenic mice reveal comparable epigenetic changes to those detected in FRDA patient tissue. We have thus developed a mouse model that will be a valuable resource for future therapeutic studies targeting epigenetic modifications of the FXN gene to increase frataxin expression.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2007-11-30", "authors": ["SaharAl-Mahdawi", "Ricardo MouroPinto", "OzamaIsmail", "DhavalVarshney", "StefaniaLymperi", "ChiranjeeviSandi", "DaniahTrabzuni", "MarkPook"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddm346"}
{"title": "Pre-treatment of synthetic elastomeric scaffolds by cardiac fibroblasts improves engineered heart tissue.", "abstract": "Native myocardium consists of several cell types, of which approximately one-third are myocytes and most of the nonmyocytes are fibroblasts. By analogy with monolayer culture in which fibroblasts were removed to prevent overgrowth, early attempts to engineer myocardium utilized cell populations enriched for cardiac myocytes (CMs; approximately 80-90% of total cells). We hypothesized that the pre-treatment of synthetic elastomeric scaffolds with cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) will enhance the functional assembly of the engineered cardiac constructs by creating an environment supportive of cardiomyocyte attachment and function. Cells isolated from neonatal rat ventricles were prepared to form three distinct populations: rapidly plating cells identified as CFs, slowly plating cells identified as CMs, and unseparated initial population of cells (US). The cell fractions (3 x 10(6) cells total) were seeded into poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds (highly porous discs, 5 mm in diameter x 2-mm thick) using Matrigeltrade mark, either separately (CM or CF), concurrently (US), or sequentially (CF pre-treatment followed by CM culture, CF + CM), and cultured in spinner flasks. The CF + CM group had the highest amplitude of contraction and the lowest excitation threshold, superior DNA content, and higher glucose consumption rate. The CF + CM group exhibited compact 100- to 200-mum thick layers of elongated myocytes aligned in parallel over layers of collagen-producing fibroblasts, while US and CM groups exhibited scattered and poorly elongated myocytes. The sequential co-culture of CF and CM on a synthetic elastomer scaffold thus created an environment supportive of cardiomyocyte attachment, differentiation, and contractile function, presumably due to scaffold conditioning by cultured fibroblasts. When implanted over the infarcted myocardium in a nude rat model, cell-free poly(glycerol sebacate) remained at the ventricular wall after 2 weeks of in vivo, and was vascularized.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Although in vitro transcriptional responses of macrophages to either spore or anthrax toxins have been previously reported, little is known regarding the impact of infection on gene expression in host tissues. We infected Swiss-Webster mice intranasally with 5 LD(50) of B. anthracis-virulent Ames spores and observed the global transcriptional profiles of various tissues over a 48 h time period. RNA was extracted from spleen, lung, and heart tissues of infected and control mice and examined by Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Approximately 580 host genes were significantly over or under expressed among the lung, spleen, and heart tissues at 8 and 48 h time points. Expression of genes encoding for surfactant and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation was diminished during the early phase of infection in lungs. By 48 h, a significant number of genes were modulated in the heart, including up-regulation of calcium-binding-related gene expression, and down-regulation of multiple genes related to cell adhesion, formation of the extracellular matrix, and the cell cytoskeleton. Interestingly, the spleen 8h post-infection showed striking increases in the expression of genes that encode hydrolytic enzymes, and these levels remained elevated throughout infection. Further, genes involving antigen presentation and interferon responses were down-regulated in the spleen at 8 h. In late stages of infection, splenic genes related to the inflammatory response were up-regulated. This study is the first to describe the in vivo global transcriptional response of multiple organs during inhalational anthrax. Although numerous genes related to the host immunological response and certain protection mechanisms were up-regulated in these organs, a vast list of genes important for fully developing and maintaining this response were decreased.

Six weeks after implantation into infarcted rat myocardium, the elastic cardiac patches (ESC-seeded PLCL scaffolds) showed reduced fibrotic tissue formation, likely due to a combination of lower apoptotic activity, higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, and more extensive angiogenesis in the strained versus unstrained control [ESC-seeded, non-elastic poly(lactide-co-glycolide) scaffolds] patches. Importantly, cardiac gene expression was upregulated in the elastic patches compared to control, with evidence for cardiomyocyte-specific microstructures including myofibrillar bundles and Z-lines.

It is a major cause of heart failure and heart transplantation. DCM is of genetic origin in approximately 30% of cases and genetically heterogeneous with the identification of numerous disease genes. However, many new disease genes remain to be discovered. Focusing on gene products located in the sarcomere of cardiomyocytes as disease-causing candidates, we screened the gene encoding the sarcomeric Z-band protein myopalladin (MYPN, OMIM 608517) for mutation.\nWe sequenced the coding region in 114 (65 familial and 49 sporadic cases) independent DCM patients' DNA and functionally analysed the identified mutations.

For the three missense mutations, the substituted amino acids were conserved among species. All mutations were absent from 400 control subjects. Specific immunolabelling of heart tissue from a proband carrying the R1088H mutation showed a decreased localization of myopalladin at the Z-band area of left ventricular cardiac myofibrils. Analysis of the effects of the mutations after transfection in rat neonate cardiomyocytes indicated sarcomere disorganization and premature cell death associated with the V1195M and P1112L myopalladin expression.

This study was designed to examine if overexpression of TGFbeta(1) using adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) protects cardiomyocytes from reoxygenation injury. TGFbeta(1) was overexpressed in cultured HL-1 mouse cardiomyocytes by transfection with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(Latent) or with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT) (active TGFbeta(1)). TGFbeta(1) upregulation reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and necrosis induced by 24 h of hypoxia followed by 3 h of reoxygenation concomitant with reduction in reactive oxygen species release, activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and NF-kappaB expression. Transfection with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT) was superior to that with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(Latent). To determine if AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT) upregulation in vivo would induce cardioprotection from I-R injury, rat hearts were injected with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Six weeks later, TGFbeta(1)(ACT) was upregulated throughout the myocardium. Following I-R, AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT)-overexpressing rats had much smaller infarct size (P<0.01 vs PBS group), which was also related to reduced activation of NADPH oxidase and NF-kappaB, and lower levels of malondialdehyde in I-R tissues. These data demonstrate that overexpression of TGFbeta(1) by AAV can protect cardiac tissues from reperfusion injury, possibly via antioxidant mechanism.

Therefore, we compared gene expression in models of estrogen depletion and estrogen replacement. Using gene expression array analysis, we examined differences in expression in cardiac tissue from ovariectomized (OVX), ovariectomized with 17beta-estradiol replacement (OVX/E2), and intact rats undergoing sham procedures (Sham). We found that OVX results in at least twofold changes in expression of genes involved in inflammation, vascular tone, apoptosis, and proteolysis compared with OVX/E2. With confirmation via real-time PCR, we found an OVX-induced increase in genes mediating inflammation (inhibin betaa, IL-6, TNF-alpha, SOCS2, SOCS3), an OVX-related decrease in the myocardial mRNA expression of genes involved in regulating vasodilation (endothelial NOS, soluble guanyl cyclase), an OVX-associated increase in extracellular matrix genes (collagen12alpha1, connexin 43), and an OVX-related increase in proapoptotic genes (caspase 3, calpain). Because details of cardiac signaling by SOCS genes are virtually unknown, we examined the protein expression for these genes via Western analyses. Although we observed OVX-related increases in SOCS2 and SOCS3 mRNA, SOCS2 and SOCS3 protein did not differ among groups. In light of these findings, investigation into the net effect of OVX on inflammation is warranted.

{"title": "Electrical remodeling contributes to complex tachyarrhythmias in connexin43-deficient mouse hearts.", "abstract": "Loss of connexin43 (Cx43) gap junction channels in the heart results in a marked increase in the incidence of spontaneous and inducible polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (PVTs). The mechanisms resulting in this phenotype remain unclear. We hypothesized that uncoupling promotes regional ion channel remodeling, thereby increasing electrical heterogeneity and facilitating the development of PVT. In isolated-perfused control hearts, programmed electrical stimulation elicited infrequent monomorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (MVT), and dominant frequencies (DFs) during MVT were similar in the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV). Moreover, conduction properties, action potential durations (APDs), and repolarizing current densities were similar in RV and LV myocytes. In contrast, PVT was common in Cx43 conditional knockout (OCKO) hearts, and arrhythmias were characterized by significantly higher DFs in the RV compared to the LV. APDs in OCKO myocytes were significantly shorter than those from chamber-matched controls, with RV OCKO myocytes being most affected. APD shortening was associated with higher levels of sustained current in myocytes from both chambers as well as higher levels of the inward rectifier current only in RV myocytes. Thus, alterations in cell-cell coupling lead to regional changes in potassium current expression, which in this case facilitates the development of reentrant arrhythmias. We propose a new mechanistic link between electrical uncoupling and ion channel remodeling.

This needs a method with adequate throughput and a demonstrable predictive value to effects in native cardiac tissues. Here we describe the validation of a method that combines the ability to screen tens of compounds a day, with direct assessment of channel function.\nThe electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of hNav1.5 were compared using two methods: conventional, low-throughput electrophysiology and planar-array-based, medium-throughput electrophysiology (IonWorks HT). A pharmacological comparison was also made between IonWorks HT and canine cardiac Purkinje Fibre action potential upstroke data.\nActivation curve parameters for hNav1.5 in IonWorks HT were not statistically different (p>0.05) from those generated using conventional electrophysiology. IonWorks HT V(1/2)=-22+/-0.8 mV, slope=6.9+/-0.2 (n=11); conventional electrophysiology V(1/2)=-20+/-1.6 mV, slope=6.4+/-0.3 (n=11). Potency values for a range of hNav1.5 blockers determined using IonWorks HT correlated closely with those obtained using conventional electrophysiology (R=0.967, p<0.001). The assay was able to distinguish between highly use-dependent blockers (e.g. tetracaine) and blockers that do not display strong use-dependence (e.g. quinidine). Comparison of the degree of hNav1.5 inhibition and decrease in canine Purkinje fibre action potential upstroke velocity (V(max)) showed that the IonWorks HT assay would have predicted the outcome in Purkinje fibres in the majority of cases, with false negative and positive rates estimated at 8 and 7%, respectively. Finally, hNav1.5 pharmacology was similar when determined using either IonWorks HT or IonWorks Quattro, although the latter yielded more consistent data.\nThe assay described combines a functional assessment of hNav1.5 with medium-throughput. Furthermore the assay was able to reveal information on the use-dependency of compound block, as well as predicting Na(+) channel effects in more integrated systems such as the cardiac Purkinje fibre action potential.

Our research is focused on evaluating the feasibility of different tissue engineering platforms to support the formation of heart muscle. Our previous work was focused on developing three-dimensional (3D) models of heart muscle using self-organization strategies and biodegradable hydrogels. To build on this work, our current study describes a third tissue engineering platform using polymer-based scaffolding technology to engineer functional heart muscle in vitro. Porous scaffolds were fabricated by solubilizing chitosan in dilute glacial acetic acid, transferring the solution to a mold, freezing the mold at -80 degrees C followed by overnight lyophilization. The scaffolds were rehydrated in sodium hydroxide to neutralize the pH, sterilized in 70% ethanol and cellularized using primary cardiac myocytes. Several variables were studied: effect of polymer concentration and chitosan solution volume (i.e., scaffold thickness) on scaffold fabrication, effect of cell number and time in culture on active force generated by cardiomyocyte-seeded scaffolds and the effect of lysozyme on scaffold degradation. Histology (hematoxylin and eosin) and contractility (active, baseline and specific force, electrical pacing) were evaluated for the cellularized constructs under different conditions. We found that a polymer concentration in the range 1.0-2.5% (w/v) was most suitable for scaffold fabrication while a scaffold thickness of 200 microm was optimal for cardiac cell functionality. Direct injection of the cells on the scaffold did not result in contractile constructs due to low cell retention. Fibrin gel was required to retain the cells within the constructs and resulted in the formation of contractile constructs. We found that lower cell seeding densities, in the range of 1-2 million cells, resulted in the formation of contractile heart muscle, termed smart material integrated heart muscle (SMIHMs). Chitosan concentration of 1-2% (w/v) did not have a significant effect on the active twitch force of SMIHMs. We found that scaffold thickness was an important variable and only the thinnest scaffolds evaluated (200 microm) generated any measurable active twitch force upon electrical stimulation. The maximum active force for SMIHMs was found to be 439.5 microN while the maximum baseline force was found to be 2850 microN, obtained after 11 days in culture. Histological evaluation showed a fairly uniform cell distribution throughout the thickness of the scaffold. We found that lysozyme concentration had a profound effect on scaffold degradation with complete scaffold degradation being achieved in 2 h using a lysozyme concentration of 1 mg/mL. Slower degradation times (in the order of weeks) were achieved by decreasing the lysozyme concentration to 0.01 mg/mL.

Creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in heart perfusates were significantly reduced during reperfusion. These effects were accompanied by substantial release of reduced glutathione (GSH), indicating that the H(2)S moiety may have up-regulated cysteine transport. The anti-ischaemic activities of S-diclofenac and the H(2)S-donor sodium hydro sulphide (NaHS) were partially prevented by the K(ATP) channel antagonist glibenclamide, suggesting a mechanism similar to H(2)S-induced cardioprotection in metabolic ischaemic preconditioning. Perfusion with the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine worsened the myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion damage, but this was dose-dependently prevented by S-diclofenac and NaHS, suggesting that the released H(2)S may have overcome NO deficiency.\nThese data show that S-diclofenac had marked anti-ischaemic activity in ischaemic-reperfused rabbit hearts despite inhibition of prostaglandin generation.

Consequently, we developed a dual-zone superfusion chamber that can dynamically create a small (5 mm) central island of heterogeneity in cultured cardiac cell monolayers. Three different conditions were studied to explore the effect of regionally slowed conduction on wave propagation and reentry: depolarization by elevated extracellular potassium, sodium channel inhibition with lidocaine, and cell-cell decoupling with palmitoleic acid. Using optical mapping of transmembrane voltage, we found that the central region of slowed conduction always served as the core region around which a spiral wave formed and then revolved following a period of rapid pacing.

The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate tissue-specific effects of different ion channel blockers or activators on the action potential (AP), which can affect other parameters in addition to drug-induced APD/QT prolongation or shortening.\nElectrophysiological effects were measured in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers, papillary muscles and ventricular trabeculae using a microelectrode technique under the following conditions: block of I(to) with 4-AP (1 x 10(-3) M), block of Ca(2+) channels with diltiazem (1 x 10(-5) M), block of Na(+) channels with flecainide (1 x 10(-5) M), activation of Ca(2+) current with Bay-K-8644 (1 x 10(-5) M), activation of K(ATP) channels with levcromakalim (1 x 10(-5) M) or block of I(K1) current with BaCl(2) (n=8 to 12 for each group). 4-AP prolonged APD significantly more in the Purkinje fiber than in the papillary muscle or the ventricular trabecula. 4-AP elicited 63% incidence of early afterdepolarizations but 0% in the papillary or trabeculae. Diltiazem and flecainide shortened APD(40) and APD(50) and increased triangulation more in the Purkinje fiber, whilst having little effect on these parameters in the papillary muscle or the ventricular trabecula. Bay-K-8644 significantly prolonged APD in the ventricular trabecula, but not in the Purkinje fiber or the papillary muscle. BaCl(2) prolonged APD(90) in all tissues, but significantly shortened APD(40) only in the Purkinje fiber. Levcromakalim shortened APD in all tissues, but significantly less in the Purkinje fibers.\nThe present study demonstrates that certain cardiac tissues respond differently to the same ion channel blockers/activators, which are not involved in APD/QT prolongation. As such the appropriate selection of tissue needs to be taken into careful consideration in cardiac safety assessments when exploring different mechanisms of drug-induced changes in the action potential.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods", "date": "2007-10-30", "authors": ["Hua RongLu", "EddyVlaminckx", "David JGallacher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vascn.2007.06.005"}

It has been proposed that the IL-1/IL-1ra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) ratio influences these functions. Other members of the IL-1 family and the related caspase-1 also contribute to regulation of IL-1-mediated functions. We determined the mRNA expression of caspase-1, caspase-3, IL-1alpha , IL-1beta , IL-18, IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1-RI), and IL-1ra in left ventricle tissue of hearts from patients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy (ICM or DCM) and in control tissues from unused donor transplant hearts in RT-PCR experiments. We show that the expression of caspase-1, caspase-3, IL-1beta , and IL-1-RI mRNA was not different between patients and control tissues. Furthermore, we did not find detectable amounts of IL-1alpha mRNA in any of these adult myocardial tissues. On the other hand, expression of IL-18 RNA was lower in myocardium of both patient groups compared with control hearts. Furthermore, IL-1ra mRNA expression was significantly lower in tissues of DCM patients compared with ICM patients and controls. This was in line with a trend towards lower IL-1ra protein levels in myocardial tissues of DCM patients. In contrast with the adult tissues discussed above, which did not express IL-1alpha mRNA, commercially available human fetal tissue expressed IL-1alpha mRNA. On the other hand IL-1beta mRNA was present in fetal and in adult human heart tissue. Our data provide evidence for an altered ratio of IL-1/IL-1ra in DCM patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether cEPC and circulating mononuclear cells (MNC), which include a small number of in vivo circulating EPC, are able to transmigrate through the endothelial barrier into the cardiac tissue. MNC and EPC were isolated from the peripheral blood from healthy male volunteers (n = 13, 25+/-6 years) and stained with a fluorescent marker. The cells were perfused in vitro through organs with endothelial layers of different phenotypes (rat aorta, human umbilical vein, isolated mouse heart). The endothelium and the basal lamina were then stained by immunofluorescence and the cryo-sections analysed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. After perfusion through the rat aorta, an adhesion/integration of MNC was observed at the endothelial layer and the basal lamina beneath endothelial cells. However, no migration of MNC over the endothelial barrier was found. This remained true even when the cell numbers were increased (from 0.5 to 10 million cells/h), when the time of perfusion was prolonged (1.5-4 h) and when the aorta was cultivated for 24 h. In the Langendorff-perfused mouse heart with intact endothelium, no migration of MNC (1 x 10(7)) or cEPC (1 x 10(6)) was observed after 0.5 and 2 h. In conclusion, MNC and cEPC do not possess any capacity to transmigrate the endothelial barrier.

Therefore, the heart is a major target of research within the field of tissue engineering, which aims to replace infarcted myocardium and enhance cardiac function. The primary objective of this work was to develop a biocompatible, degradable and superelastic heart patch from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS). PGS was synthesised at 110, 120 and 130 degrees C by polycondensation of glycerol and sebacic acid with a mole ratio of 1:1. The investigation was focused on the mechanical and biodegrading behaviours of the developed PGS. PGS materials synthesised at 110, 120 and 130 degrees C have Young's moduli of 0.056, 0.22 and 1.2 MPa, respectively, which satisfy the mechanical requirements on the materials applied for the heart patch and 3D myocardial tissue engineering construction. Degradation assessment in phosphate buffered saline and Knockout DMEM culture medium has demonstrated that the PGS has a wide range of degradability, from being degradable in a couple of weeks to being nearly inert.

Most studies on stem cell transplantation therapy in both experimental heart infarct and in phase-I human clinical trials have focused on the use of undifferentiated stem cells. Based on our previous observations demonstrating the presence of multipotent progenitor cells in human adult skeletal muscle, in this study we investigated the capacity of these progenitors to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Here we show an efficient protocol for the cardiomyogenic differentiation of human adult skeletal muscle stem cells in vitro. We found that treatment with Retinoic Acid directed cardiomyogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle stem cells in vitro. After Retinoic Acid treatment, cells expressed cardiomyocyte markers and acquired spontaneous contraction. Functional assays exhibited cardiac-like response to increased extracellular calcium. When cocultured with mouse cardiomyocytes, Retinoic Acid-treated skeletal muscle stem cells expressed connexin43 and when transplanted into ischemic heart were detectable even 5 weeks after injection. Based on these results, we can conclude that human adult skeletal muscle stem cells, if opportunely treated, can transdifferentiate into cells of cardiac lineage and once injected into infarcted heart can integrate, survive in cardiac tissue and improve the cardiac function.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2007-09-25", "authors": ["GloriaInvernici", "SilviaCristini", "PaoloMadeddu", "StefanoBrock", "FrankSpillmann", "PiaBernasconi", "CristinaCappelletti", "ChiaraCalatozzolo", "UmbertoFascio", "GianluigiBisleri", "ClaudioMuneretto", "GiulioAlessandri", "Eugenio AParati"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.08.006"}

Development of an in vitro model for assessment of proarrhythmic potential offers the advantage of higher throughput and reduced compound quantity requirements when compared to in vivo studies.

Previous reports have indicated that this model qualitatively identifies proarrhythmic compounds and suggest the use of this model to assign safety margins for human clinical use. The intent of this series of studies was to evaluate the impact of study design on the proarrhythmic concentration predicted by this model.\nNine compounds of varying proarrhythmic potential and a negative control were tested in a blinded fashion using a series of different experimental protocols: Compounds were tested at multiple concentration ranges and extended perfusion times were also evaluated.\nIn general when the dataset is viewed as a whole, the model did identify proarrhythmic compounds, however the concentration at which action potential prolongation, triangulation, instability, reverse-use dependence and ectopic beats occurred often varied based on the concentration range selected.

Interaction of activated neutrophils and endothelial cells is considered to play a prominent role in the pathophysiology of MODS. Insight in the nature and molecular basis of endothelial cell activation during HS can assist in identifying new rational targets for early therapeutic intervention. In this study, we examined the kinetics and organ specificity of endothelial cell activation in a mouse model of HS. Anesthetized male mice were subjected to controlled hemorrhage to a MAP of 30 mmHg. Mice were killed after 15, 30, 60, or 90 min of HS. After 90 min of hemorrhagic shock, a group of mice was resuscitated with 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4. Untreated mice and sham shock mice that underwent instrumentation and 90 min of anesthesia without shock served as controls. Gene expression levels of inflammatory endothelial cell activation (P-selectin, E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and hypoxia-responsive genes (vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha) were quantified in kidney, liver, lung, brain, and heart tissue by quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, we examined a selection of these genes with regard to protein expression and localization using immunohistochemical analysis. Induction of inflammatory genes occurred early during HS and already before resuscitation. Expression of adhesion molecules was significantly induced in all organs, albeit to a different extent depending on the organ. Endothelial genes CD31 and VE-cadherin, which function in endothelial cell homeostasis and integrity, were not affected during the shock phase except for VE-cadherin in the liver, which showed increased mRNA levels. The rapid inflammatory activation was not paralleled by induction of hypoxia-responsive genes.

The cDNA of hLBH is 2927 bp long, encoding a protein product of 105 amino acids. The protein is highly conserved in evolution across different species from zebra fish, to mouse, to human. Northern blot analysis indicates that a 2.9 kb transcript specific for hLBH is most abundantly expressed in both embryonic and adult heart tissue. In COS-7 cells, hLBH proteins are localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. hLBH is a transcription activator when fused to Gal-4 DNA-binding domain. Deletion analysis indicates that both the N-terminal containing proline-dependent serine/threonine kinase group and the C-terminal containing ERK D-domain motif are required for transcriptional activation. Overexpression of hLBH in COS-7 cells activates the transcriptional activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and serum response element (SRE).
