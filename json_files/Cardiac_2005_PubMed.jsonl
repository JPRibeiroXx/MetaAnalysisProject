{"title": "Carvedilol Protects Early Diabetic Rat Hearts through Reducing Oxidative Stress.", "abstract": "The risk for cardiovascular disease is significantly high in diabetes mellitus. Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor and selective alpha1-adrenoceptor blocker, also has antioxidant and free radical scavenger properties. In the present study the effect of carvedilol on the antioxidative status of cardiac tissue was investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced early diabetic rats. The subjects were randomly divided into age-matched rats, STZ-induced untreated diabetic rats, small and large dosage (1mg/kg/d or 10mg/kg/d) carvedilol-administrated diabetic rats. After 5 weeks, hemodynamic parameters, echocardiography characteristics and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the cardiac tissues of all groups were meassured. Diabetic rats had lower ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and higher systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and developed pressure. These parameters were improved by administration of carvedilol. Diabetic rats showed elevated MDA level and CAT activity, but lower activities of SOD and GSH-Px. Carvedilol treatment increased activities of SOD and GSH-Px in diabetic rats. These results indicate that carvedilol improves cardiac function via its antioxidant property in diabetic rats.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

{"title": "3D Visualization of Echocardiogram and Blood Flow.", "abstract": "Congenital heart defect is a leading cause of children mortality. Two-dimensional echocardiography is a safe and noninvasive diagnostic tool and two-dimensional images can be reconstructed to a three-dimensional model. However, for some complex congenital heart diseases, the visualization of three-dimensional cardiac tissue structure alone is not enough. Visualization of blood flow patterns in a human heart is important to evaluate cardiac disease of patients. Color flow imaging is a well-established ultrasound mode and very valuable for visualizing the distribution of blood flow in a specific region of interest. However, blood flow patterns in a human heart have three-dimensional complex structure and change dynamically, but the output of color flow imaging is usually presented as a two-dimensional image on a cross section of a heart. The authors make use of an echocardiography system to acquire the data which include cardiac tissue structure and blood flow patterns, and construct an interactive visualization system for the three-dimensional heart and blood flow. With the visualization system, which possesses interactivity and a changeable view, users can easily understand the inner cardiac structure and blood flow in the heart. The images that we use are not only from actual patient data, but also from isolated porcine hearts and hearts of living dogs.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

{"title": "High-resolution dynamic imaging of contrast agent uptake in a beating heart.", "abstract": "Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR cardiac imaging has been recognized as a unique and powerful tool for assessing both cardiac functions and physiological conditions of the heart tissues (e.g., tissue rejection following heart transplantation). However, because of cardiac motion and the limited data acquisition speed of existing MRI techniques, it has been very difficult to acquire dynamic images of very high spatiotemporal resolution. This paper proposes a new generalized series (GS) based imaging technique to overcome this challenging problem. Specifically, the proposed technique collects two data sets: a) a sequence of highresolution reference images over several cardiac cycles using a gated cine acquisition scheme before the injection of a contrast agent (or a molecular probe), and b) a sequence of reduced data sets with very high frame rate during the transient wash-in/wash-out stage of the contrast agent. A GS model is then used to combine these two data sets to reconstruct a high-resolution image sequence, capturing both the cardiac motions and dynamic signal changes due to the interaction of the contrast agent with the cardiac tissues. The proposed technique has been validated using both simulated and experimental data, which show that high-resolution dynamic images can be acquired with as few as 8 encodings (in contrast to 256 encodings required in the traditional Fourier transform-based methods). The technique provides a very effective tool for physiological imaging of the beating heart with molecular probes.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

{"title": "A comparison of multilevel solvers for the cardiac bidomain equations.", "abstract": "Computing the extracellular potentials in a bidomain cardiac activation model is a computationally significant step in the solution process. Thus, using a fast solver can drastically reduce the overall time of simulation. Solving for the extracellular potentials involves inverting the matrix coming from the elliptic equation describing the extracellular-intracellular potential coupling. Elliptic equations are known to yield matrices that become progressively more ill-conditioned as the spatial resolution is increased. However, optimal multilevel solution methods are known to exist for these equations given enough effort is placed into developing the correct solution components. Two multilevel solvers that automatically perform much of this work are black box multigrid (BOXMG) and algebraic multigrid (AMG). In this paper, we compare the performance of BOXMG and AMG as solvers for the elliptic component of the bidomain equations.

It has proven efficacy in various malignancies either alone or combined with other cytocidal agents. The clinical usefulness of the anthracycline drug has been precluded by cardiac toxicity. Many therapeutic interventions have been attempted to improve the therapeutic benefits of the drug. Few, however, have been efficacious in this setting.\nWe have addressed in the current study the possible protective effects of naringenin, a flavonoid known to have anti-oxidant properties, on doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in male Swiss albino rats.\nForty male Swiss albino rats were used in this study. Naringenin (25 mg/kg body weight) was administered daily by gavage for 7 consecutive days before a cumulative single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg body weight, ip).\nDoxorubicin induced marked biochemical alterations characteristic of cardiac toxicity including, elevated activities of serum total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), enhanced lipid peroxidation measured as malondialdehyde (MDA). The anthracycline drug has also reduced the cardiac enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT). Besides, it reduced significantly the reduced glutathione (GSH) level, but it increased the total NO content in heart tissue. Prior administration of naringenin ahead of doxorubicin challenge ameliorated all these biochemical markers.\nTaken together, one could conclude that naringenin has a protective role in the abatement of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity that resides, at least in part, on its anti-radical effects and regulatory role on NO production.", "journal": "Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute", "date": "2006-11-15", "authors": ["Hossam MArafa", "Mohamed FAbd-Ellah", "Hafez FHafez"], "doi": null}

We have developed a multichannel optical mapping system for recording cardiac action potentials transmurally. Each channel uses a single small-diameter optical fiber to transmit and collect light from the cardiac tissue. Excitation light is supplied by low-power green lasers. Wavelength separation is performed with a dichroic mirror, and fluorescence is detected with a photodiode. We have recorded action potentials with an unfiltered signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as high as 60:1 and a temporally filtered SNR as high as 200:1. The collection of fluorescence is optimized so that low excitation light intensity can be used, which increases the available recording time. Channels are modular and compact, and the system can be easily expanded to include additional channels, ratiometry or dual-dye mapping.

{"title": "Matrix metalloproteinases and their function in myocardium.", "abstract": "A significant number of myocardial diseases are accompanied by increased synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as by changed maturation and incorporation of ECM components. Important groups of enzymes responsible for both normal and pathological processes in ECM remodeling are matrix metaloproteinases (MMPs). These enzymes share a relatively conserved structure with a number of identifiable modules linked to their specific functions. The most important function of MMPs is the ability to cleave various ECM components; including such rigid molecules as fibrillar collagen molecules. The amount and activity of MMPs in cardiac tissue are regulated by a range of activating and inhibiting processes. Although MMPs play multifarious roles in many myocardial diseases, here we have focused on their function in ischemic cardiac tissue, dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophied cardiac tissue. The inhibition of MMPs by means of synthetic inhibitors seems to be a promising strategy in cardiac disease treatment.

The model contained 64 myocytes described by 2 million tetrahedral elements, to which an external electric field was applied, and then the finite element method was used to compute the associated current density. In the first case, a reduction in the amount of interstitial space led to a reduction in extracellular longitudinal conductivity by about 20%, which is in the range of reported literature values. Moderate cell swelling in the order of 10-20% did not affect extracellular conductivity considerably. To match the reported drop in total tissue conductance reported in experimental studies during the third phase of ischaemia, a ten fold increase in the gap junction resistance was simulated.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare disorder which affects women within one month antepartum to five months postpartum. A high occurrence of PPCM in central Haiti (1 in 300 live births) provided the unique opportunity to study the relationship of immune activation and DC maturation to the etiology of this disorder. Plasma samples from two groups (n = 12) of age- and parity-matched Haitian women with or without evidence of PPCM were tested for levels of biomarkers of cardiac tissue remodeling and immune activation. Significantly elevated levels of GM-CSF, endothelin-1, proBNP and CRP and decreased levels of TGF-beta were measured in PPCM subjects relative to controls. Yet despite these findings, in vitro maturation of normal human cord blood derived progenitor dendritic cells (CBDCs) was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) in the presence of plasma from PPCM patients relative to plasma from post-partum control subjects as determined by expression of CD80, CD86, CD83, CCR7, MHC class II and the ability of these matured CBDCs to induce allo-responses in PBMCs.

Two widely used current standard techniques to isolate individual organelles include differential and density-gradient centrifugation. Although these techniques have proven useful for processing small volumes of sample, multiple rounds of centrifugation are required when performing a large-scale purification. In this report, we have introduced a novel technique: continuous-flow ultracentrifugation using a sucrose gradient to separate, accumulate, and highly enrich bovine heart mitochondria in one step. To demonstrate the advantage of the technique, mitochondrial proteins from two different bovine hearts (3-8 mo and 18-30 mo old) were examined. For each age group, 100 g of bovine heart tissue were homogenized by a blending procedure. After removal of the nuclei, the entire remaining homogenate was loaded onto a proteomics continuous-flow ultracentrifuge to separate and enrich the organelles. Fractions were collected and mitochondria-enriched fractions were identified by Western blot analysis. To study the protein profile changes with aging in the mitochondrial proteome, the mitochondria-enriched fractions were applied to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The resulting two-dimensional PAGE gels were subsequently analyzed by image analysis software to identify proteins unique to each age group and proteins with at least twofold differences in protein expression. These proteins were then digested with trypsin and identified by mass spectrometer. Significant differences in the protein profiles of the two differently aged mitochondria preparations were found.

{"title": "Vitamin E deficiency accelerates nitrate tolerance via a decrease in cardiac P450 expression and increased oxidative stress.", "abstract": "Organic nitrates, such as nitroglycerin (NTG), have been used to relieve the symptoms of angina pectoris. However, their biochemical mechanisms of action, particularly in relation to the development of tolerance, are incompletely defined. It has been reported that supplemental antioxidants such as vitamin E attenuate the development of nitrate tolerance. Therefore, we examined the role of vitamin E in the regulation of nitrate tolerance. Continuous NTG infusion induced nitrate tolerance in rats after 48 h, and vitamin E concentrations decreased in a time-dependent manner in tissues and plasma. Vitamin E supplementation (0.5 g/kg diet) maintained higher concentrations of vitamin E during NTG infusion. The onset and extent of the tolerance, estimated by the decrease in blood pressure following NTG bolus injection during the infusion of NTG, were accentuated in the vitamin E-deficient group. Vitamin E supplementation inhibited nitrate tolerance 48 h after NTG infusion. Cardiac P450 expression (CYP1A2) assessed by immunoblotting, markedly decreased 48 h after NTG administration in control rats. The supplementation of vitamin E significantly attenuated the decrease in P450. Treatment of NTG enhanced vascular superoxide production (L-012 chemiluminescence, DHE fluorescence). The peak of lipid peroxidation and free radical generation in the heart was reached before tolerance developed. In contrast, vitamin E-deficient hearts had lower P450 expression and higher free radical generation than control hearts. To evaluate other vitamin E-inhibitable mechanisms of nitrate tolerance, we studied the NO-cGMP pathway. NTG markedly reduced the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) serine 239 phosphorylation (specific substrate of cGMP-activated protein kinase I; cGK-I) in tolerant hearts. Vitamin E inhibited the depletion of pVASP. In conclusion, because continuous NTG infusion causes vitamin E depletion as well as nitrate tolerance, vitamin E deficiency may further accelerate nitrate tolerance via an increase in oxidative stress, the reduced bioconversion because of decreased P450 expression, and impairment of the NO/cGMP pathway in tolerant heart tissues.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2006-03-08", "authors": ["YukikoMinamiyama", "ShigekazuTakemura", "SeikanHai", "ShigefumiSuehiro", "ShigeruOkada"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.10.038"}

Genetic susceptibility may play a role in the differential survival of severe CCC patients. Given the role of TNF-alpha in the progression of heart failure, and the increased TNF-alpha plasma and heart tissue levels observed in these patients, we chose TNF as a candidate gene for increased mortality in severe CCC patients. We typed the TNFa microsatellite and the -308 TNF promoter polymorphism and then analyzed the survival curves of 42 patients with severe ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction<or=40%) according to the presence of the TNF2 promoter allele or the TNFa2 microsatellite allele, both previously associated with high TNF-alpha production. Multivariate regression analysis (Cox proportional hazards model) revealed the TNF genotype and age of onset of severe CCC as independent predictors of mortality in severe CCC. We showed that patients positive for TNF2 or TNFa2 alleles display a significantly shorter survival time compared to those carrying other alleles; the median survival times were 2.9 and 8 months, respectively (HR(adj)=2.28, p=0.020). We have identified for the first time a genetic factor related to reduced survival in severe Chagas' disease cardiomyopathy.

{"title": "Somatostatin receptor subtype expression in the human heart: differential expression by myocytes and fibroblasts.", "abstract": "In acromegaly, somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs) can ameliorate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and their use is associated with demonstrable improvements in various parameters of cardiac function. It remains unclear as to whether these beneficial effects are principally attributable to falling GH and IGF-I levels, or whether SRLs exert independent direct effects on the heart via somatostatin receptors. To help address this issue, we have sought to investigate somatostatin receptor expression in human heart. A human heart cDNA library was probed using PCR techniques to determine expression of somatostatin receptor subtypes. Subsequently, human heart biopsies and human cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes were analysed to determine whether expression differed between cardiac chambers or cell types. mRNAs for four of the five somatostatin receptor subtypes (sst1, sst2, sst4 and sst5) were shown to be co-expressed by the human heart. These receptors were present in both atrial and ventricular tissue. Human cardiac myocytes expressed mRNA for only sst1 and sst2, while human cardiac fibroblasts expressed all four subtypes found in whole heart tissue. The expression of functional somatostatin receptors on human cardiac fibroblasts was confirmed by mobilisation of intracellular calcium in response to somatostatin. The presence of cardiac somatostatin receptors raises the possibility of a direct effect of somatostatin analogues on the heart. Furthermore, the differential expression of somatostatin receptor subtypes by human cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts opens up the possibility of differential modulation of the cell types in the heart by subtype-specific somatostatin analogues.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2006-01-21", "authors": ["William H TSmith", "R UnnikrishnanNair", "DawnAdamson", "Mark TKearney", "Stephen GBall", "Anthony JBalmforth"], "doi": "10.1677/joe.1.06082"}
{"title": "Primary and secondary transcriptional effects in the developing human Down syndrome brain and heart.", "abstract": "Down syndrome, caused by trisomic chromosome 21, is the leading genetic cause of mental retardation. Recent studies demonstrated that dosage-dependent increases in chromosome 21 gene expression occur in trisomy 21. However, it is unclear whether the entire transcriptome is disrupted, or whether there is a more restricted increase in the expression of those genes assigned to chromosome 21. Also, the statistical significance of differentially expressed genes in human Down syndrome tissues has not been reported.\nWe measured levels of transcripts in human fetal cerebellum and heart tissues using DNA microarrays and demonstrated a dosage-dependent increase in transcription across different tissue/cell types as a result of trisomy 21. Moreover, by having a larger sample size, combining the data from four different tissue and cell types, and using an ANOVA approach, we identified individual genes with significantly altered expression in trisomy 21, some of which showed this dysregulation in a tissue-specific manner. We validated our microarray data by over 5,600 quantitative real-time PCRs on 28 genes assigned to chromosome 21 and other chromosomes. Gene expression values from chromosome 21, but not from other chromosomes, accurately classified trisomy 21 from euploid samples. Our data also indicated functional groups that might be perturbed in trisomy 21.\nIn Down syndrome, there is a primary transcriptional effect of disruption of chromosome 21 gene expression, without a pervasive secondary effect on the remaining transcriptome.

{"title": "Cardiac patch constructed from human fibroblasts attenuates reduction in cardiac function after acute infarct.", "abstract": "The current experiments used a scaffold-based, three-dimensional, human dermal fibroblast culture (3DFC) as a cardiac patch to stimulate revascularization and preserve left ventricular (LV) function of the infarcted LV in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The 3DFC contains viable cells that secrete angiogenic growth factors and has been previously shown to stimulate angiogenesis. The hypothesis tested was that a 3DFC cardiac patch would attenuate a reduction in LV function of infarcted hearts. Five groups of mice were studied, including normal SCID mice (n = 13), normal SCID mice with 3DFC (n = 6), infarcted SCID mice (n = 6), infarcted mice with nonviable 3DFC (n = 6), and infarcted SCID mice with 3DFC (n = 6). An occlusion of a branch of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was performed by thermal ligation, and 3DFC was sized to the damaged area and implanted onto the epicardium at the site of tissue injury. Fourteen days postsurgery, LV mechanics were characterized with the Millar conductance catheter system (CCS). The data demonstrated that 3DFC-treated infarcted myocardium had significantly higher ejection fractions (EFs) compared with infarct-only mice (58.9 +/- 10.8 versus 31.0 +/- 5.8%, respectively; p < 0.05). Preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW) parameters were significantly higher in 3DFC-treated mice compared with infarct-only mice (64.6 +/- 11.9 versus 36.8 +/- 6.4 mmHg, respectively; p < 0.05).

It is carried out in normal and normotensive rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus receiving different treatment modalities. Normal rats were divided into two groups, namely a placebo (N) and a losartan-treated (NL), and diabetic rats into four groups receiving placebo (D), insulin-treated (DI), losartan-treated (DL), and insulin/losartan-treated (DIL) respectively. Binding kinetics of ET-1 to ET(A)-Rs/ET(B)-Rs on CE and CMs were assessed in the above groups to try to explain the effect of therapeutic doses of an angiotensin II receptor subtype-1 blocker on the dynamics of this ligand and its receptor in insulin supplemented diabetic animals. Each group was divided into two subgroups: CHAPS-untreated and CHAPS-treated rat hearts perfused with [125I]ET-1 to respectively estimate ET-1 binding affinity (tau = 1/k-n) to its receptor subtype(s) on CE and CMs using mathematical modeling describing a 1:1 reversible binding stoichiometry. Heart perfusion results revealed that insulin treatment significantly decreased tau on CE but not on CMs in diabetic rats. In diabetics treated with losartan, an increase in tau value on CE but not on CMs was noted. Cotreatment of diabetic rats with insulin and losartan normalized tau on CE but decreased it on CMs. Western blot, using snap-frozen heart tissues, revealed increase in ET(A)-R density in all diabetic groups. However, significant decrease in ET(B)-R density was observed in all groups compared to the normal, and was reconfirmed by immunohistochemical analysis.

The passive properties are described by a non-linear, transversely isotropic, hyperelastic material model, and the myocardium is assumed to be almost incompressible. Single-field, pure displacement-based formulations are known to cause numerical difficulties when applied to incompressible or slightly compressible material cases. This paper presents an alternative approach in the form of a mixed formulation, where a separately interpolated pressure field is introduced as a primary unknown in addition to the displacement field. Moreover, a constraint term is included in the formulation to enforce (almost) incompressibility. Numerical results presented in the paper demonstrate the difficulties related to employing a pure displacement-based method, applying a set of physically relevant material parameter values for the cardiac tissue. The same problems are not experienced for the proposed mixed method. We show that the mixed formulation provides reasonable numerical results for compressible as well as nearly incompressible cases, also in situations of large fiber stretches.

However measurements of action potentials with SPE have not been demonstrated. We sought to develop a method for TPE of di-4-ANEPPS and test whether the method yields voltage-dependent fluorescence in cardiac tissue. We modified our SPE and ratio-metric fluorescence recording system to use a femtosecond pulsed near-infrared laser. Modifications were made to enhance fluorescence collection efficiency and to block infrared laser light from entering the fluorescence collection system. Fluorescence was collected simultaneously in green (510-570 nm) and red (590-700 nm) wavelength bands. Action potentials were observed in the ratio of the green signal to the red signal, but were not observed above the noise level in either of the individual signals. Incorporation of a common-mode noise subtraction method revealed action potentials in green and red signals. We also found that the di-4-ANEPPS fluorescence emission spectrum for TPE at 930 nm was similar to the emission spectrum for SPE at 488 nm.

A special mesh generator was developed for this model to create realistically shaped myocytes and interstitial space with a controlled degree of variation included in each model. In order to derive the effective conductivities, we used a finite element model to compute the currents flowing through the intracellular and extracellular space due to an externally applied electrical field. The product of these computations were the effective conductivity tensors for the intracellular and extracellular spaces. The simulations of bi-domain conductivities for healthy tissue resulted in an effective intracellular conductivity of 0.16S/m (longitudinal) and 0.005 S/m (transverse) and an effective extracellular conductivity of 0.21S/m (longitudinal) and 0.06 S/m (transverse).

{"title": "Approximate solution to the bidomain equations for electrocardiogram problems.", "abstract": "Simulating the electrocardiogram requires specifying the transmembrane potential distribution within the heart and calculating the potential on the surface of the body. Often, such calculations are based on the bidomain model of cardiac tissue. A subtle but fundamental problem arises when considering the boundary between the cardiac tissue and the surrounding volume conductor. In general, one finds that two potentials--the extracellular potential in the tissue and the potential in the surrounding bath--obey three boundary conditions, implying that the potentials are overdetermined. In this paper, we derive a general method for handling bidomain boundary conditions that eliminates this problem. The gist of the method is that we add an additional term to the transmembrane potential that falls exponentially with depth into the tissue. The purpose of this term is to satisfy the third boundary condition. Then, we take the limit as the length constant associated with this extra term goes to zero. Our result is two boundary conditions that approximately account for the full set of three boundary conditions at the tissue surface.", "journal": "Physical review.

The transition from periodic to quasiperiodic reentry occurs at a critical Rin, which first diminishes and then saturates as Rout is increased. The reduction of the critical Rin is a consequence of the increase of the wave-front curvature. There is a range of Rin below the critical radius in which two distinct quasiperiodic solutions coexist. Each of these solutions disappears at its own specific value of Rin, and their annihilation is preceded by a new type of bifurcation leading to a regime of propagation with transient successive detachments of the wave front from the inner border of the annulus.", "journal": "Physical review.

The main types of abnormal ECG include sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, sinister megacardia, and ST-T changes. The accelerated heart-beat and shortened P-R interval appear to be more prominent in female exposed workers than in their male counterparts. Mn-exposed workers display a mean diastolic blood pressure that is significantly lower than that of the control subjects, especially in the young and female exposed workers. Animal studies indicate that Mn is capable of quickly accumulating in heart tissue, resulting in acute or subacute cardiovascular disorders, such as acute cardiodepression and hypotension.

The DOX-treated animals showed higher mortality (53%) and more ascites. Myocardial damage, as assessed by ultrastructural changes, showed loss of myofibrils, cytoplasmic vacuolization and mitochondrial swelling. Myocardial superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were decreased and lipid peroxidation was increased. Pretreatment with Spirulina significantly protected the mice from DOX-induced cardiotoxic effects as evidenced from lower mortality (26%), less ascites, lower levels of lipid peroxidation, normalization of antioxidant enzymes and ultrastructural studies showing minimal damage to the heart.

This study aimed to determine the forces required to cause partial or total detachment of a heart valve prosthesis in patients with age-related degenerative diseases exposed to MRI.\nEighteen tissue samples excised during routine heart valve replacement surgery were subjected to a suture pull-out test using a tensile materials testing machine. Five preconditioning cycles were applied before commencing the final destructive test. The test was complete when the sample ruptured and the suture was pulled completely free from the tissue. Results were compared with previously calculated magnetically induced forces at 4.7 T.\nAll tissue samples displayed a basic failure pattern. Mean forces required to cause initial yield and total rupture were 4.0 N (+/- 3.3 N) and 4.9 N (+/- 3.6 N), respectively. Significant factors determining initial yield were stenosed calcific tissue (p < .01), calcific degeneration (single pathology) (p < .04) and tissue stiffness (p < .01). Calcific degeneration (p < .03) and tissue stiffness (p < .03) were also significant in determining maximum force required to cause total rupture.\nSpecific age-related degenerative cardiac diseases stiffen and strengthen tissue resulting in significant forces being required to pull a suture through valve annulus tissue. These forces are significantly greater than magnetically induced < 4.7 T. Therefore, patients with degenerative valvular diseases are unlikely to be at risk of valve dehiscence during exposure to static magnetic field < or = 4.7 T.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance", "date": "2005-12-16", "authors": ["Maria-BenedictaEdwards", "Edward R CDraper", "Jeffrey WHand", "Kenneth MTaylor", "Ian RYoung"], "doi": "10.1080/10976640500288149"}

Mobile phones are used in close proximity to the heart, therefore 900 MHz EMR emitting mobile phones may be absorbed by the heart. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), one of the major components of honeybee propolis, was recently found to be a potent free radical scavenger and antioxidant, and is used in folk medicine. The aim of this study was to examine 900 MHz mobile phone-induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the role of CAPE on myocardial tissue against possible oxidative damage in rats. Thirty rats were used in the study. Animals were randomly grouped as follows: sham-operated control group (N: 10) and experimental groups: (a) group II: 900 MHz EMR exposed group (N: 10); and (b) group III: 900 MHz EMR exposed+CAPE-treated group (N: 10). A 900 MHz EMR radiation was applied to groups II and III 30 min/day, for 10 days using an experimental exposure device. Malondialdehyde (MDA, an index of lipid peroxidation), and nitric oxide (NO, a marker of oxidative stress) were used as markers of oxidative stress-induced heart impairment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were studied to evaluate the changes of antioxidant status. In the EMR exposed group, while tissue MDA and NO levels increased, SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities were reduced. CAPE treatment in group III reversed these effects. In this study, the increased levels of MDA and NO and the decreased levels of myocardial SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities demonstrate the role of oxidative mechanisms in 900 MHz mobile phone-induced heart tissue damage, and CAPE, via its free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties, ameliorates oxidative heart injury.

To identify the contribution of the different vascular compartments in the diabetic impairment of vascularization, we employed streptozotocin- and control-treated 3-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice in an isogeneic pinnal cardiac allograft model, revealing a significant delay in vascularization of wild-type cardiac tissue transplanted into diabetic mice. To investigate the basis of this impairment, the function of diabetic bone marrow cells was tested by transplantation of bone marrow cells isolated from diabetic and control mice into intact, unirradiated 18-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice, which have impaired function of both EPCs and peripheral endothelial cells. Importantly, cells derived from control, but not diabetic, bone marrow integrated into transplanted cardiac allografts. To assess the contribution of diabetic changes in the local vasculature, diabetic mice were treated with pinnal injections of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB, which promotes cardiac angiogenesis in wild-type mice. However, whereas PDGF-AB enhanced allograft function in control mice, the activity of the cardiac transplants in the PDGF-AB-treated diabetic mice was significantly decreased. To decipher the potential interactions between systemic bone marrow-derived cells and local vascular pathways, diabetic mice were transplanted with wild-type bone marrow cells with or without PDGF-AB pinnal pretreatment, resulting in improved allograft function and donor cell recruitment only in the combination treatment arm.

Anesthetized adult male rats (175-250 g b wt) underwent sham operation (SHAM group) or were subjected to 40 min of myocardial ischemia (MI) induced by temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) followed by 2 h reperfusion (R).

Myocardial I-R resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the myocardial malondialdehyde levels and a decrease (p < 0.01) in the myocardial reduced glutathione content.

Small clinical trials of cell therapy in patients with myocardial infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy have recapitulated these beneficial effects in humans with infarct size reduction and improvement in ejection fraction, myocardial perfusion, and wall motion. Several phenotypically distinct cell populations have been utilized for cardiac regeneration, and the relative merits of one cell over another remain to be determined.

An Mg2+ dependent ATPase activity is responsible for controlling the energy requiring process in cells whereas Ca2+ATPase is responsible for the signal transduction pathways and membrane fluidity. Activities of these enzymes were significantly altered (p < 0.05) in STZ diabetic rats. Oral administration of C. esculenta root extract for a period of 45 days resulted in significant (p < 0.05) reversal of these enzymes' activities to near normal. Thus the results suggest that C. esculenta protects the membrane integrity and functional status in STZ diabetic rats.", "journal": "Die Pharmazie", "date": "2005-12-03", "authors": ["APrakasam", "SSethupathy", "K VPugalendi"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Study on cardioactive effects of brazilein.", "abstract": "Brazilein (6a,7-dihydro-3,6a,10-trihydroxy-benz[b]indeno[1,2-d]pyran-9(6H)-one) is a compound obtained in a large amount from Caesalpinia sappan ethanol extracts with a high purity of about 98%. In isolated cardiac tissues, we found that brazilein exhibited a positive inotropic action in a concentration-dependent manner with little effect on heart rate and coronary perfusion. To study its possible mode of action, isolated rat hearts were treated with propranolol. This treatment did not alter the cardiotonic effect of brazilein, suggesting that this effect does not involve stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, an analysis of the interaction between Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and brazilein was carried out. Albino guinea pig erythrocytes (mainly alpha1-Na(+),K(+)-ATPase isoforms) enriched with Na(+),K(+)-ATPase isoforms were utilized to compare the inhibition promoted by brazilein with that of classical inhibitors such as the cardiac glycoside deslanoside. Analysis of inhibition curves revealed that unlike deslanoside, brazilein had a relatively low affinity for erythrocyte isoforms and failed to completely inhibit the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. The extent of the maximum inhibition rate was about 50%. The inhibitory effect of brazilein was not antagonized by 10 mmol/l K(+), as observed with deslanoside. Electrocardiogram research in vivo showed that brazilein did not induce the ventricular arrhythmias observed with deslanoside, suggesting that brazilein might have a less adverse effect and higher therapeutic index than cardiac glycosides. In light of all the above-mentioned observations, it can be concluded that brazilein, a molecule with a non-steroidal skeleton, produced its positive inotropic effect through inhibiting Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and could thus serve as a structural paradigm to develop new inotropic drugs.", "journal": "Pharmacology", "date": "2005-12-02", "authors": ["Yu NanZhao", "YangPan", "Jia LinTao", "Dong MingXing", "Li JunDu"], "doi": "10.1159/000089721"}

Previously the interaction of ArfGAP1 with the Golgi was allocated to a portion of the non-catalytic, carboxyl part of the protein, but the mechanism of this interaction has not been established. In this study we identify a short stretch in the non-catalytic part of ArfGAP1 (residues 204-214) in which several hydrophobic residues contribute to Golgi localization. Even single alanine replacement of two of these residues (Leu-207 and Trp-211) strongly diminished Golgi localization. Mutations in the hydrophobic residues also diminished the in vitro activity of ArfGAP1 on Arf1 bound to Golgi membranes. The stretch containing the hydrophobic residues was recently shown to mediate the binding of ArfGAP1 to loosely packed lipids of highly curved liposomes (Bigay, J., Casella, J. F., Drin, G., Mesmin, B., and Antonny, B. (2005) EMBO J. 24, 2244-2253). Whereas short fragments containing the hydrophobic stretch were not Golgi-localized, a proximal 10-residue in-frame insertion that is present in new ArfGAP1 isoforms that we identified in brain and heart tissues could confer Golgi localization on these fragments. This localization was abrogated by alanine replacement of residues Phe-240 or Trp-241 of the insertion sequence but not by their replacement with leucines.

{"title": "Cardiac lipoprotein lipase: metabolic basis for diabetic heart disease.", "abstract": "The heart has a limited potential to synthesize fatty acid (FA), and, therefore, FA is supplied from several sources: lipolysis of endogenous cardiac triglyceride (TG) stores or from exogenous sources in the blood. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), synthesized in cardiomyocytes, catalyzes the breakdown of the TG component of lipoproteins to provide FA to the heart. It is the vascular endothelial-bound LPL that determines the rate of plasma TG clearance, and, hence, it is also called heparin-releasable (HR) \"functional\" LPL. Functional LPL is regulated by numerous dietary and hormonal factors and is sensitive to pathophysiological alterations like those observed during diabetes. In this condition, absolute or relative lack of insulin impairs cardiac glucose transport and oxidation, resulting in FA becoming the preferred means of energy supply. To make available this increased requirement of the heart for FA, the diabetic heart upregulates its luminal LPL activity by posttranslational mechanisms. Chronically elevated cardiac LPL can result in abnormal FA supply and utilization by the heart tissue that could potentially initiate and sustain cardiac dysfunction during diabetes. As effective blood glucose control is difficult during diabetes, it is conceivable that a parallel increase in functional cardiac LPL activity may predispose people with diabetes to premature death from cardiac disease. By gaining more insight into the initial metabolic processes in the diabetic heart, we can attempt to piece together a part of the cascade of events leading to diabetic heart disease.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2005-11-26", "authors": ["ThomasPulinilkunnil", "BrianRodrigues"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.09.017"}

For clinical applications, it is desirable to separate the hematopoietic and tissue-protective properties. Recently introduced carbamylated erythropoietin (CEPO) does not stimulate the erythropoiesis but retains the antiapoptotic and neuroprotective effects. We tested the ability of CEPO to protect cardiac tissue from toxin-induced and oxidative stress in vitro and ischemic damage in vivo and compared these effects with the effects of EPO. CEPO reduced by 50% the extent of staurosporine-induced apoptosis in isolated rats' cardiomyocytes and increased by 25% the reactive oxygen species threshold for induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition. In an experimental model of myocardial infarction induced by permanent ligation of a coronary artery in rats, similarly to EPO, a single bolus injection of 30 mug/kg b.wt. of CEPO immediately after coronary ligation reduced apoptosis in the myocardial area at risk, examined 24 h later, by 50%. Left ventricular remodeling (ventricular dilation) and functional decline (fall in ejection fraction) assessed by repeated echocardiography were significantly and similarly attenuated in CEPO- and EPO-treated rats. Four weeks after coronary ligation, the myocardial infarction (MI) size in CEPO- and EPO-treated rats was half of that in untreated coronary-ligated animals. Unlike EPO, CEPO had no effect on hematocrit. The antiapoptotic cardioprotective effects of CEPO, shown by its ability to limit both post-MI left ventricular remodeling and the extent of the myocardial scar in the model of permanent coronary artery ligation in rats, demonstrate comparable potency to that of native (nonmodified) EPO.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2005-11-25", "authors": ["ChanilMoon", "MelissaKrawczyk", "DoojinPaik", "ThomasColeman", "MichaelBrines", "MagdalenaJuhaszova", "Steven JSollott", "Edward GLakatta", "Mark ITalan"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.105.094854"}

Virus titres were 1-2 logs higher after i.p. infection, but kinetics were largely independent of infection route. Organs became negative for virus isolation after 21 days, with the exception of spleen tissue, which remained positive for up to 49 days. Thereafter, virus was detected only by immunohistochemistry and PCR up to 98 days post-infection (oral route). Histopathology showed mild inflammation and necrosis in heart tissue of all mice during the acute phase, with repair at later stages. Strikingly, pancreatic lesions were confined to the exocrine pancreas and observed only after i.p. infection. Under all experimental conditions, the pancreatic islets were spared. In contrast, immunohistochemistry showed the presence of viral VP1, protein 3A and alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) in exocrine as well as endocrine pancreas of all mice, irrespective of route and dose of infection.

Early indications suggest that these are cardiac progenitor cells that could contribute to cardiac repair/regeneration. Clinically relevant therapeutic strategies based on these cells will require improved methods for their isolation and characterization of determinants of their mobilization, proliferation and differentiation.\nAn ex vivo culture system was developed that promotes trafficking of progenitor-like cells from mouse ventricles to a culture surface. Cells that \"trafficked\" from cardiac tissue were phenotyped by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.\nMorphologically distinct cells spontaneously trafficked from mouse ventricular tissue, adhered in culture, and proliferated for up to 4 weeks in Dulbecco's minimal essential media supplemented with fetal calf serum. After 4 weeks in culture, cell number declined. Co-culture with unfractionated bone marrow restored the proliferation of these trafficked cells. A significant population of the trafficked cells expressed a phenotype consistent with that of a myogenic progenitor such as: c-kit+, Sca-1+, CD45-, CD34-, CD90.2-, MyoD1-, desmin-, muscle-specific actin-, and, infrequently, myogenin+.

The purpose of this study was to develop such a model for optimal procedural success during and after patch implantation surgery. Myocardial infarction (MI) was created by embolization of the diagonal artery (DA) branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery with collagen suspension. After 4 to 6 weeks, 14 pigs received patch implant (ECM or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene). Six pigs were infarcted in the first DA and seven pigs in the second DA. Electrophysiology study was performed within 3 days before surgery. During surgery, the size and location of the infarct were measured. Infarcted myocardium (1.5-cm diameter) was transmurally excised under partial cardiopulmonary bypass. Patches (3-cm diameter) were sutured to the endomyocardial defect. Four pigs died postoperatively. After 1 month, 10 pigs were euthanized and the locations of patches were examined. Success rate of patch implant in the second DA (85.7%) was higher than the first DA (50%) group. Infarct size in the second DA was smaller than in the first DA (4.6+/-1.2 vs. 10.8+/-2.4 cm(2), P<.05). The second DA was more anteriorly positioned, which enabled easier access from the midsternal thoracotomy. However, the first DA was more laterally located requiring more manipulation of the heart during surgery. Electrophysiology revealed no ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the second DA but 33.3% in the first DA group (P<.05). At necropsy, the endocardial position of the first DA-infarct patches was anteroapical, whereas the second DA-infarct patches were more basolateral and often involved the anterior papillary muscle. The success rate of patch implant was associated with infarction size and location, and may be related to arrhythmic substrate.

The peak active force increased from an average value of 57 microN for control cardioids to 447 microN for explanted cardioids. There was also a significant increase in the specific force. There was a significant decrease in the time to peak tension and half relaxation time. Explanted cardioids could be electrically paced at frequencies of 1-5 Hz. Explanted cardioids exhibited a sigmoidal response to calcium and positive chronotropy in response to epinephrine. As the field of cardiac tissue engineering progresses, it becomes desirable to engineer larger diameter tissue equivalents and to induce angiogenesis within tissue constructs.

{"title": "Mechanisms of disease: pathologic structural remodeling is more than adaptive hypertrophy in hypertensive heart disease.", "abstract": "Changes in the composition of cardiac tissue develop in arterial hypertension and lead to structural remodeling of the myocardium. Structural remodeling is the consequence of a number of pathologic processes, mediated by mechanical, neurohormonal and cytokine routes, occurring in the cardiomyocyte and the noncardiomyocyte compartments of the heart. One of these processes is related to the disruption of the equilibrium between the synthesis and degradation of collagen type I and III molecules, which results in an excessive accumulation of collagen type I and III fibers in the interstitium and the perivascular regions of the myocardium. The clinical relevance of ventricular fibrosis is that it might contribute to the increased cardiac risk of patients with hypertensive heart disease. This review focuses on the mechanisms of hypertensive ventricular fibrosis and its clinical consequences.

In this work, we have evaluated the antioxidant capacity of chronic PLC treatment in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by measuring the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the lipid peroxidation in liver and cardiac tissues. The activity of glutathione peroxidase was decreased in liver and cardiac tissues of SHR when compared with their normotensive controls, Wistar- Kyoto (WKY) rats, this alteration being prevented by PLC treatment. Glutathione reductase activity was increased in hypertensive rats and no effect was observed after the treatment. No significant changes in superoxide dismutase activity were observed among all experimental groups. Liver of hypertensive rats showed higher catalase activity than that of normotensive rats, and PLC enhanced this activity in both rat strains. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, determined as a measure of lipid peroxidation, were increased in SHR compared with WKY rats, and PLC treatment decreased these values not only in hypertensive rats but also in normotensive ones. The content of carnitine in serum, liver and heart was higher in PLC-treated rats, but PLC did not prevent the hypertension development in young SHR. In addition, triglyceride levels, which were lower in SHR than WKY rats, were reduced by chronic PLC treatment in both rat strains.

Levels of diagnostic marker enzymes in plasma, lipid peroxides and reduced glutathione, and the activity of glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzymes and anti-peroxidative enzymes in the heart tissue were determined. Intraperitoneal administration of taurine significantly prevented the isoprenaline-induced increases in the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase in the plasma of rats. Taurine exerted an antioxidant effect against isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction by preventing the accumulation of lipid peroxides and by maintaining the level of reduced glutathione and the activity of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase and superoxide dismutase at near normality.

Bioengineered cardiac grafts are created by combining autologous cell transplantation with a degradable scaffold as a temporary extracellular matrix. Here we present a system for engineered myocardium combining cultured cardiomyocytes and a novel biodegradable scaffold with a unique extracellular matrix-like topography.\nCardiomyocytes were harvested from neonatal rats and cultured in vitro on biodegradable electrospun nanofibrous poly(epsilon-caprolactone) meshes. Between days 5 and 7, the meshes were overlaid to construct 3-dimensional cardiac grafts. On day 14 of in vitro culture, the engineered cardiac grafts were analyzed by means of histology, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy.\nThe cultured cardiomyocytes attached well to the meshes, and strong beating was observed throughout the experimental period. The average fiber diameter of the scaffold is about 250 nm, well below the size of an individual cardiomyocyte. Hence the number of cell-cell contacts is maximized. Constructs with up to 5 layers could be formed without any incidence of core ischemia. The individual layers adhered intimately. Morphologic and electrical communication between the layers was established, as verified by means of histology and immunohistochemistry. Synchronized beating was also observed.\nThis report demonstrates the formation of thick cardiac grafts in vitro and the versatility of biodegradable electrospun meshes for cardiac tissue engineering.

{"title": "Disodium disuccinate astaxanthin (Cardax): antioxidant and antiinflammatory cardioprotection.", "abstract": "Disodium disuccinate astaxanthin (Cardax), DDA) has cardioprotective effects in the rat, rabbit, and canine models of experimental infarction. It is highly effective by parenteral administration in subchronic and acute dosing regimens. Unpublished data in rats suggest that oral cardioprotection is also readily achievable. DDA-induced myocardial salvage in the canine can reach 100% with a 4-day subchronic dosing regimen. At a single i.v. dose DDA is cardioprotective, when given 2 h before experimental coronary occlusion, but the protection is on the average two-thirds of that achieved with the subchronic regimen in dogs. In conscious animals DDA has no effects on hemodynamic parameters. The primary mechanism of cardioprotection appears to be antioxidant activity involving direct scavenging of superoxide anion, the lynchpin radical in ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, modulation of serum complement activity, as well as the reduction in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the membrane attack complex (MAC) in infarcted tissue suggest a significant antiinflammatory component in the mechanism of cardioprotective action of DDA. Stoichiometric binding of the meso-form of the compound to human serum albumin (HSA) has been demonstrated in vitro. This binding capacity overcomes the supramolecular assembly of the compound in aqueous solution, which by itself improves the stability and shelf life of aqueous formulations. Non-esterified astaxanthin readily enters cardiac tissue after either oral or parenteral administration, providing a reservoir of a cardioprotective agent with a significant half-life due to favorable ADME in mammals.

{"title": "Seasonally hibernating phenotype assessed through transcript screening.", "abstract": "Hibernation is a seasonally entrained and profound phenotypic transition to conserve energy in winter. It involves significant biochemical reprogramming, although our understanding of the underpinning molecular events is fragmentary and selective. We have conducted a large-scale gene expression screen of the golden-mantled ground squirrel, Spermophilus lateralis, to identify transcriptional responses associated specifically with the summer-winter transition and the torpid-arousal transition in winter. We used 112 cDNA microarrays comprising 12,288 probes that cover at least 5,109 genes. In liver, the profiles of torpid and active states in the winter were almost identical, although we identified 102 cDNAs that were differentially expressed between winter and summer, 90% of which were downregulated in the winter states. By contrast, in cardiac tissue, 59 and 115 cDNAs were elevated in interbout arousal and torpor, respectively, relative to the summer active condition, but only 7 were common to both winter states, and during arousal none was downregulated. In brain, 78 cDNAs were found to change in winter, 44 of which were upregulated. Thus transcriptional changes associated with hibernation are qualitatively modest and, since these changes are generally less than twofold, also quantitatively modest. Unbiased Gene Ontology profiling of the transcripts suggests a winter switch to beta-oxidation of lipids in liver and heart, a reduction in metabolism of toxic compounds and the urea cycle in liver, and downregulated electron transport in the brain. We identified just one strongly winter-induced transcript common to all tissues, namely an RNA-binding protein, RBM3. This analysis clearly differentiates responses of the principal tissues, identifies a large number of new genes undergoing regulation, and broadens our understanding of affected cellular processes that, in part, account for the winter-adaptive hibernating phenotype.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2005-10-27", "authors": ["Daryl RWilliams", "L ElaineEpperson", "WeizhongLi", "Margaret AHughes", "RuthTaylor", "JaneRogers", "Sandra LMartin", "Andrew RCossins", "Andrew YGracey"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00301.2004"}

The purpose of this study is to develop a real-time monitoring technique to elucidate HIFU-induced modifications of electrical conduction in cardiac tissues and to investigate the HIFU cardiac ablation process to help to achieve optimal HIFU ablation outcome. We conducted experimental studies applying HIFU at 4.23 MHz to ablate the atrio-ventricular (AV) node and ventricular tissue of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. We employed fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye imaging and surface electrodes to monitor the electrical conduction activity induced by HIFU application in real time. In ventricular epicardium HIFU ablation, fluorescent imaging revealed gradual reduction of the plateau phase and amplitude of the action potential. Subsequently, conduction block and cell death were observed at the site of ablation. When HIFU was applied to the AV node, fluorescent imaging and electrograms revealed the development of the AV block.

Combining all mouse and human microarray data for frataxin-deficient cells and tissues, the most consistently decreased transcripts were mitochondrial coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) of the heme pathway and mature T-cell proliferation 1, a homolog of yeast COX23, which is thought to function as a mitochondrial metallochaperone. Quantitative RT-PCR studies confirmed the significant down-regulation of Isu1, CPOX and ferrochelatase at 10 weeks in mouse hearts. We observed that mutant cells were resistant to aminolevulinate-dependent toxicity, as expected if the heme pathway was inhibited. Consistent with this, we observed increased cellular protoporphyrin IX levels, reduced mitochondrial heme a and heme c levels and reduced activity of cytochrome oxidase, suggesting a defect between protoporphyrin IX and heme a. Fe-chelatase activities were similar in mutants and controls, whereas Zn-chelatase activities were slightly elevated in mutants, supporting the idea of an altered metal-specificity of ferrochelatase. These results suggest that frataxin deficiency causes defects late in the heme pathway.

The patch-clamp technique was used to investigate effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline on L-type Ca2+ current in human atrial myocytes.\nCarvedilol was a 13-fold more potent competitive antagonist of the effects of adrenaline at beta2-adrenoceptors (-logKB=10.13+/-0.08) than of noradrenaline at beta1-adrenoceptors (-logKB=9.02+/-0.07) in human right atrium. Chronic carvedilol treatment of patients with non-terminal heart failure reduced the inotropic sensitivity of atrial trabeculae to noradrenaline and adrenaline 5.6-fold and 91.2-fold, respectively, compared to beta1-blocker-treated patients, consistent with persistent preferential blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors. In terminal heart failure carvedilol treatment reduced 1.8-fold and 25.1-fold the sensitivity of right ventricular trabeculae to noradrenaline and adrenaline, respectively, but metoprolol treatment did not reduce the sensitivity to the catecholamines. Increases of current (ICa,L) produced by noradrenaline and adrenaline were not different in atrial myocytes obtained from non-terminal heart failure patients treated with metoprolol or carvedilol, consistent with dissociation of both beta-blockers from the receptors.\nCarvedilol blocks human cardiac beta2-adrenoceptors more than beta1-adrenoceptors, thereby conceivably contributing to the beneficial effects in heart failure.

In whole-mount preparations, VIP-immunoreactive (IR) fibers were present in about 70% of the cardiac ganglia. VIP was co-localized with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in fibers innervating the intrinsic ganglia but was not present in fibers immunoreactive for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase, or substance P. A small number of the intrinsic ChAT-IR cardiac ganglia neurons (approximately 3%) exhibited VIP immunoreactivity. These few VIP-IR cardiac neurons also exhibited nNOS immunoreactivity. After explant culture for 72 h, the intraganglionic VIP-IR fibers degenerated, indicating that they were axons of neurons located outside the heart. In cardiac tissue sections, VIP-IR fibers were present primarily in the atria and in perivascular connective tissue, with the overall abundance being low. VIP-IR fibers were notably sparse in the sinus node and conducting system and generally absent in the ventricular myocardium. Virtually all VIP-IR fibers in tissue sections exhibited immunoreactivity to nNOS. A few VIP-IR fibers, primarily those located within the atrial myocardium, were immunoreactive for both nNOS and ChAT indicating they were derived from intrinsic cardiac neurons. We suggest that, in the guinea pig, the majority of intraganglionic and cardiac tissue VIP-IR fibers originate outside of the heart. These extrinsic VIP-IR fibers are also immunoreactive for nNOS and therefore most likely are a component of the afferent fibers derived from the vagal sensory ganglia.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2005-10-13", "authors": ["Rodney LParsons", "Sarah ALocknar", "Beth AYoung", "Jennifer LHoard", "Donald BHoover"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-005-0074-3"}
{"title": "Migration of intravenously grafted mesenchymal stem cells to injured heart in rats.", "abstract": "The present study aimed to determine the role of tissue injury in migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) intravenously transplanted into heart and to establish experimental basis for improving stem cell therapy in its targeting and effectiveness. MSCs were isolated from bone marrow of male Sprague-Dawley rats and purified by density centrifuge and adhered to the culture plate in vitro. Female rats were divided randomly into four groups. Myocardial ischemia (MI) transplanted group received MSCs infusion through tail vein 3 h after MI and compared with sham-operated group or normal group with MSCs infusion, or control group received culture medium infusion. MI was created in female rats by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. The heart was harvested 1 week and 8 weeks after transplantation. The characteristics of migration of MSCs to heart were detected with expression of sry gene of Y chromosome by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Ultrastructural changes of the ischemic myocardium of the recipient rats were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). One week or 8 weeks after transplantation, sry positive cells were observed in the cardiac tissue in both of MI transplanted group and sham-operated group, the number of sry positive cells being significantly higher in MI transplanted group (P<0.01). No significant difference was found in the number of sry positive cells between 1 week and 8 weeks after transplantation. No sry positive cells were observed in the hearts of control and normal group. In addition, the ultrastructure of some cells located in the peri-infarct area of MI rats with MSCs transplantation was similar to that of MSCs cultured in vitro. These results indicate that MSCs are capable of migrating towards ischemic myocardium in vivo and the fastigium of migration might appear around 1 week after MI.

{"title": "Caffeic acid phenethyl ester possesses potent cardioprotective effects in a rabbit model of acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Although great achievements have been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms contributing to acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, an effective pharmacological therapy to protect cardiac tissues from serious damage associated with acute myocardial infarction, coronary arterial bypass grafting surgery, or acute coronary syndromes has not been developed. We examined the in vivo cardioprotective effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a natural product with potent anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant activities. CAPE was systemically delivered to rabbits either 60 min before or 30 min after surgically inducing I/R injury. Infarct dimensions in the area at risk were reduced by >2-fold (P < 0.01) with CAPE treatment at either period. Accordingly, serum levels of normally cytosolic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase (CK), MB isoenzyme of CK, and cardiac-specific troponin I were markedly reduced in both CAPE treatment groups (P < 0.05) compared with the vehicle-treated control group. CAPE-treated tissues displayed significantly less cell death (P < 0.05), which was in part due to inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and reduced DNA fragmentation often associated with caspase 3 activation (P < 0.05). In addition, CAPE directly blocked calcium-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Finally, the levels of inflammatory proteins IL-1beta and TNF-alpha expressed in the area at risk were significantly reduced with CAPE treatment (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that CAPE has potent cardioprotective effects against I/R injury, which are mediated, at least in part, by the inhibition of inflammatory and cell death responses. Importantly, protection is conferred when CAPE is systemically administered after the onset of ischemia, thus demonstrating potential efficacy in the clinical scenario.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

To study the effect of plant derived triterpene, lupeol and its ester lupeol linoleate, on blood lipid status and oxidant stress in heart and hemolysate, male albino Wistar rats were fed high cholesterol diet (normal rat chow supplemented with 4% cholesterol and 1% cholic acid; HCD) for 30 days. A significant increase (p<0.05) in plasma total cholesterol (4.22 fold) and triglycerides (1.7 fold) was observed in HCD fed rats, along with elevated LDL (3.56 fold) and VLDL (1.99 fold) cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol (34.14%). Treatment with lupeol and its derivative normalized the lipid profile. The significant increase (p<0.05) in lipid peroxidation (LPO) was paralleled by significantly diminished (p<0.05) activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and decreased (p<0.05) concentration of antioxidant molecules (GSH, Vit C and Vit E) in cardiac tissue and hemolysate of HCD fed rats. The oxidative tissue injury in hypercholesterolemic rats was substantiated by the increase in cardiac marker, serum CPK and the drop in its activity in the heart tissue. Lupeol and lupeol linoleate treatment decreased the LPO levels and increased enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. CPK activity in the treated group was comparable with that of the control.

{"title": "Immunohistochemical expression of activated caspase-3 in human myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "There is mounting evidence that apoptosis is important in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI). One of the key events in the process of apoptosis is activation of caspase-3. Much attention has been recently paid to caspase inhibition as a potential treatment for ischemic cardiac disease. To predict the long-term effect of such treatment, it is essential to understand the significance of caspase-3 in the evolution of MI. Our aim was therefore to analyze immunohistochemical expression of activated caspase-3 in MI. Our study included autopsy samples of infarcted heart tissue from 50 patients with MI. Immunohistochemistry was performed by a sensitive peroxidase-streptavidin method on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, using monoclonal antibodies against activated (cleaved) caspase-3. We found caspase-3-positive myocytes in 18 MI less than 24 h old and in 3 MI that were presumably 48 h old. Their density (number of labeled myocytes/mm(2)) was greater in patients who received reperfusion treatment (mean 0.160+/-0.373 vs 0.025+/-0.037, p=0.06). In MI older than 48 h, positive reaction was observed in neutrophil granulocytes in the interstitium and, in subacute MI, it was observed in mononuclear inflammatory cells, myofibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that apoptosis of myocytes is an important mode of cell death in the early MI, being enhanced in patients who received reperfusion treatment. After 48 h, apoptosis is an important mechanism of the clearance of neutrophil granulocytes and other inflammatory cells and of scar formation. Treatment with caspase inhibitors therefore will not only affect myocyte loss but will also interfere with the clearance of neutrophils and with the transformation of granulation tissue into a scar.", "journal": "Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology", "date": "2005-10-06", "authors": ["NinaZidar", "ZvezdanaDolenc-Strazar", "JeraJeruc", "DusanStajer"], "doi": "10.1007/s00428-005-0073-5"}

{"title": "Early induction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 transduces signaling in human heart end stage failure.", "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover is regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and plays an important role in cardiac remodeling. Previous studies from our lab demonstrated an increase in gelatinolytic-MMP-2 and -9 activities in endocardial tissue from ischemic cardiomyopathic (ICM) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathic (DCM) hearts. The signaling mechanism responsible for the left ventricular (LV) remodeling, however, is unclear. Administration of cardiac specific inhibitor of metalloproteinase (CIMP) prevented the activation of MMP-2 and -9 in ailing to failing myocardium. Activation of MMP-2 and -9 leads to induction of proteinase activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). We hypothesize that the early induction of MMP-9 is a key regulator for modulating intracellular signaling through activation of PAR and various downstream events which are implicated in development of cardiac fibrosis in an extracellular receptor mediated kinase-1 (ERK-1) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) dependent manner. To test this hypothesis, explanted human heart tissues from ICM and DCM patients were obtained at the time of orthotopic cardiac transplants. Quantitative analysis of MMP-2 and -9 gelatinolytic activities was made by real-time quantitative zymography. Gel phosphorylation staining for PAR-1 showed a significant increase in ICM hearts. Western blot and RT-PCR analysis and in-situ labeling, showed significant increased expression of PAR-1, ERK-1and FAK in ICM and DCM. These observations suggest that the enhanced expression and potentially increased activity of LV myocardial MMP-9 triggers the signal cascade instigating cardiac remodeling.

It was established that IHT in the second mode caused pronounced increase in MDA content both in the blood and the liver by 67% and 32% respectively; considerable augmentation of SOD activity in this tissues (by 49% and 32% respectively) and CAT activity (by 18% and 43% respectively). Moreover, in forty five days the activity of SOD exceeded its initial level in three times in both the blood and the liver. It has been established that IHT in the second mode provoke to twice decrease in PAO-induced mitochondrial swelling as compared with mitochondria of the control group, and even in forty five days after IHT stopping the protective effect on mitochondrial PTP opening was well-preserved. These effects were completely abolished in the presence of an inhibitor--cyclosporin A (10(-5) mol/l) that demonstrated mitochondrial swelling to be due to the mitochondrial PTP opening. Our experiments showed that the influence of IHT in more severe mode decreased the sensitivity of mitochondria to the PAO in rat heart mitochondria. Thus resistance of the mitochondrial membrane to an inductor of PTP opening--PAO increase under the influence of IHT in the second mode.", "journal": "Fiziolohichnyi zhurnal (Kiev, Ukraine : 1994)", "date": "2005-10-06", "authors": ["H LVavilova", "T VSerebrovs'ka", "O VRudyk", "M VBielikova", "Ie EKoliesnikova", "T VKukoba", "V FSahach"], "doi": null}
{"title": "LMCD1/Dyxin is a novel transcriptional cofactor that restricts GATA6 function by inhibiting DNA binding.", "abstract": "The activity of GATA factors is regulated, in part, at the level of protein-protein interactions. LIM domain proteins, first defined by the zinc finger motifs found in the Lin11, Isl-1, and Mec-3 proteins, act as coactivators of GATA function in both hematopoietic and cardiovascular tissues. We have identified a novel GATA-LIM interaction between GATA6 and LMCD1/dyxin. The LIM domains and cysteine-rich domains in LMCD1/dyxin and the carboxy-terminal zinc finger of GATA6 mediate this interaction. Expression of LMCD1/dyxin is remarkably similar to that of GATA6, with high-level expression observed in distal airway epithelium of the lung, vascular smooth muscle, and myocardium. In contrast to other GATA-LIM protein interactions, LMCD1/dyxin represses GATA6 activation of both lung and cardiac tissue-specific promoters. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that LMCD1/dyxin represses GATA6 function by inhibiting GATA6 DNA binding. These data reveal an interaction between GATA6 and LMCD1/dyxin and demonstrate a novel mechanism through which LIM proteins can assert their role as transcriptional cofactors of GATA proteins.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2005-10-04", "authors": ["NibeditaRath", "ZhishanWang", "Min MinLu", "Edward EMorrisey"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.25.20.8864-8873.2005"}
{"title": "Internal defibrillation with minimal skeletal muscle activation: a new paradigm toward painless defibrillation.", "abstract": "Shock-induced pain produces substantial morbidity in recipients of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). This pain likely derives from activation of skeletal muscle and associated nerves in the chest and abdomen. In an effort to develop a painless defibrillation system, we designed an electrode arrangement that incorporates a conductive sock placed around the heart to confine the electric shock field to cardiac tissue.\nThe purpose of this study was to test whether cardiac defibrillation could be achieved without skeletal muscle activation using a novel electrode system.\nEight adult mongrel dogs were studied. Force of skeletal muscle contraction was measured by strain gauges attached to the forelimbs during delivery of internal shocks ranging in energy from 0.1 to 31 J. Biphasic shocks were delivered (1) between a right ventricular coil and a subcutaneous dummy can (standard configuration), and (2) between a left ventricular coil and an epicardial electrode sock. Internal and external defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) were determined for each electrode configuration.\nShock-induced muscle contraction force was significantly lower using the sock electrode than with standard ICD electrodes at every shock energy level tested (P < .0001). Internal DFT was similar between electrode configurations (sock electrode: 8.6 +/- 4.2 J; standard: 11.0 +/- 6.3 J, P = .4), but muscle contraction force at DFT was greatly reduced with the new electrode system (1.8 +/- 2.0 kg vs 10.6 +/- 2.1 kg, P < .0001). The sock electrode rendered external defibrillation impossible, however, even at 360 J.\nSkeletal muscle activation induced by ICD shocks can be greatly reduced using an electrode system that confines the electric shock field to the heart. Refinement of this strategy may allow for delivery of painless shocks by ICDs. Further development is needed to overcome implant complexity and the higher external DFT with this type of electrode system.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2005-09-29", "authors": ["VinodJayam", "MenekhemZviman", "VenkuJayanti", "ArielRoguin", "HenryHalperin", "Ronald DBerger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2005.06.030"}

The objective of this study was to determine whether seric autoantibodies against atrio-ventricular (AV) node and sinus auricular node tissues are markers of chronic cardiopathy condition. We searched for the presence of seric autoantibodies against AV node and sinus auricular node tissues in 25 sera from chronic chagasic cardiopathy patients, 20 sera from non-chagasic cardiopathy patients, 20 sera from indeterminate chagasic subjects, and 20 sera from healthy blood donors as controls. Diagnosis of dilated cardiopathy was established based on the left-ventricular end systolic dimension and cardiothoracic ratio on chest x-radiography and impaired contracting ventricle, and chagasic etiology by demonstration of circulating antibodies using ELISA and IIF. Autoantibody detection against conduction heart tissue was carried out by immunohistochemical test. The tissues were obtained from non-cardiopathy necropsy case. Human sera were diluted at 1:10 in PBS-FSB. Goat antihuman laminin was used as positive control. Autoantibodies were more frequently found in chronic chagasic cardiopathy (20%) compared to non-chagasic cardiopathy (5%) and indeterminate chagasic subjects (5%), pattern staining define interstitial and membrane targets on rich conduction system tissue.

{"title": "Head-tail interactions in numerical simulations of reentry in a ring of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "The relationships between action potential duration (APD) and conduction velocity (CV) to the previous diastolic interval (DI) are known as the APD and CV restitution relationships. There is considerable debate regarding the importance of these relationships in the development and stability of reentry.\nThe purpose of this study was to increase the understanding of the ionic basis for restitution during reentry.\nAPD and CV were studied numerically during one-dimensional reentry as ring length (L) was shortened. A three-state variable model (u, v, w) was used to analyze the effect of gating variables of the fast (v) and slow (w) currents on the spatial and temporal dynamics of transmembrane potential (u). Three parameter sets were used corresponding to three APD and CV restitution curves.\nSustained spatial oscillations of APD and CV larger than the ring length were observed in two of the parameter sets (cytochalasin-D model [CYTO] and model 3 [M3]) before block occurred at L = 6 cm. The last model (diacetyl monoxime [DAM]) resulted in uniform APD and CV for all L until block occurred at L = 3 cm. Multivalued APD and CV restitution relationships due to \"dephasing\" of w and v with DI were observed in M3 and CYTO simulations. Overall, these dynamics could be explained by the wavelength-to-ring length ratio and the sensitivity of APD on the value of the gating variables w and v.\nPropagation stability is mostly controlled by APD sensitivity to w, but the APD restitution slope does not always reflect this sensitivity. The interaction of the dynamic history (i.e., memory) of the fast and slow currents and electrotonic effects resulted in multivalued restitution curves.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2005-09-28", "authors": ["XiaozhongChen", "Flavio HFenton", "Richard AGray"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2005.08.015"}

Western blot analysis indicated a significant increase in the endotoxin receptor protein level in the 3 week MgD hearts. Since CD14 is known to be up-regulated in cells exposed to LPS, these observations suggest that prolonged Mg-deficiency results in increased intestinal permeability to bacterial products that induce the endotoxin receptor in cells localized to myocardial and intestinal tissues.

Recently, there has been some debate as to whether these corticosteroids are also produced in the hearts of rodents and humans, possibly contributing to the development of hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. To investigate this, we have used our established, highly sensitive real-time quantitative RT-PCR method to measure CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 mRNA levels in adrenal and cardiac tissue from several rat models of cardiovascular pathology. We have also studied isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes treated with angiotensin II and ACTH. Total RNA was isolated from the adrenal and cardiac tissue of 1) male Wistar rats with heart failure induced by coronary artery ligation and sham-operated controls; 2) stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar Kyoto rats as controls; 3) cyp1a1Ren-2 transgenic rats and Fischer controls; 4) isolated adult Sprague-Dawley ventricular myocytes incubated with 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), DOC plus angiotensin II, or DOC plus ACTH.

There were no other significant differences in adrenal CYP11B2 or CYP11B1 expression between the model animals and their respective controls. Cardiac CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 mRNA transcript levels from all in vivo and in vitro groups were never greater than 100 copies per microgram total RNA and therefore too low to be detected reproducibly.

In the control group, rats experienced the same experimental processes except the shunting procedure. After 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of experiment, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) of each rat were evaluated by using a right cardiac catheterization procedure.

A Piroplasmida species was detected in 6 Pipistrellus spp., whereas Bartonella infections were detected in 5 bats belonging to 4 different species. Trypanosoma dionisii was detected in 1 Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic inference from alignment of a partial 18S rRNA-encoding gene sequence of the pipistrelle-associated Piroplasmida species with homologous sequences available for other members of the Order indicated that this organism was unique but specifically related to members of the genus Babesia, a phylogeny that would be in keeping with the organism being Babesia vesperuginis. Alignment of partial citrate synthase gene sequences from the bat-associated bartonellae revealed 5 distinct genotypes that were probably derived from 2 distinct Bartonella species.

We investigated wavebreak and re-entry initiated by an S1S2S3 stimulus protocol in tissue sheets with two regions, each with different APD restitution. The two regions had a different APD at short diastolic interval (DI), but similar APD at long DI. Simulations were performed twice; once with both regions having steep (slope > 1), and once with both regions having flat (slope < 1) APD restitution.\nWavebreak and re-entry were readily initiated using the S1S2S3 protocol in tissue sheets with two regions having different APD restitution properties. Initiation occurred irrespective of whether the APD restitution slopes were steep or flat. With steep APD restitution, the range of S2S3 intervals resulting in wavebreak increased from 1 ms with S1S2 of 250 ms, to 75 ms (S1S2 180 ms). With flat APD restitution, the range of S2S3 intervals resulting in wavebreak increased from 1 ms (S1S2 250 ms), to 21 ms (S1S2 340 ms) and then 11 ms (S1S2 400 ms).\nRegional differences in APD restitution are an arrhythmogenic substrate that can be concealed at normal heart rates. A premature stimulus produces regional differences in repolarisation, and a further premature stimulus can then result in wavebreak and initiate re-entry.

However, our previous report as well as others have shown that Cav1.3 Ca2+ channel-deficient mice (Cav1.3(-/-)) demonstrate sinus bradycardia with a prolonged PR interval. In the present study, we extended our study to examine the role of the Cav1.3(alpha1D) Ca2+ channel in the atria of Cav1.3(-/-) mice.\nWe obtained new evidence to demonstrate that there is significant expression of Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels predominantly in the atria compared with ventricular tissues.

We previously documented the hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependent activation of Cav1.3 compared with Cav1.2 Ca2+ channel subunits in a heterologous expression system. The lack of Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels in null mutant mice would result in a depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependent activation of I(Ca,L) in atrial myocytes.

The symptoms and mortality after zinc powder treatment were recorded. The effects of particles on the blood-element, the serum biochemical level and the blood coagulation were studied after 2 weeks of administration. The organs were collected for histopathological examination. The N-Zn treated mice showed more severe symptoms of lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea in the beginning days than the M-Zn mice. Deaths of two mice occurred in the N-Zn group after the first week of treatment. The mortalities were confirmed by intestinal obstruction of the nanoscale zinc aggregation. The biochemical liver function tests of serum showed significantly elevated ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH in the M-Zn mice and ALT, ALP, and LDH in the N-Zn mice compared with the controls (P<0.05), which indicated that the liver damage was probably induced by both micro- and nano-scale zinc powders. The clinical changes were observed in the two treated group mice as well. The levels of the above enzymes were generally higher in the M-Zn mice than in the N-Zn mice, which implied that M-Zn powder could induce more severe liver damage than N-Zn. The biochemical renal function tests of serum BUN and CR in the M-Zn mice markedly increased either compared with the N-Zn mice or with the controls (P<0.05), but no significant difference was found between the N-Zn and the control mice.

The goal was to choose the most informative ones by applying the quantitative analysis technique. The Fisher statistics has been applied for hypothesis testing to define the most informative texture parameters. The quantitative analysis proved that the texture parameters of the myocardium tissue can be estimated significantly, when the sample size of ROI is not less than 900-1000 pixels.

{"title": "A novel thiol oxidation-based mechanism for adriamycin-induced cell injury in human macrophages.", "abstract": "Adriamycin is a widely used antitumor antibiotic, but its use has been limited by its cytotoxicity in both cardiomyocytes and non-cardiac tissues. While adriamycin's ability to redox cycle via one-electron transfer reactions and generate ROS is thought to promote cardiotoxicity, the mechanisms involved in non-cardiac tissue injury are not clear. Here we show that prolonged exposure (48 h) of human monocyte-derived macrophages to adriamycin at concentrations as low as 1 microM promotes caspase-independent cell death. Treatment of cells with scavengers of superoxide and peroxyl radicals blocked adriamycin-induced oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) but did not prevent macrophage injury. Macrophages treated with either adriamycin or the thiol oxidant diamide showed elevated levels of glutathione disulfide and increased protein-S-glutathionylation prior to cell injury, indicating that thiol oxidation is involved in adriamycin-induced macrophage death. Furthermore, inhibition of glutathione reductase (GR) with 1,3-bis[2-chloroethyl]-1-nitrosourea or transfection of macrophages with small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) directed against GR or glutaredoxin (Grx) potentiated adriamycin-induced macrophage injury. Thus, both GR and Grx appear to play a crucial role in protecting macrophages from adriamycin-induced cell injury. These findings suggest a new mechanism for adriamycin-induced tissue injury whereby thiol oxidation, rather than one-electron redox cycling and ROS generation, mediates adriamycin-induced cell damage.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2005-09-15", "authors": ["RetoAsmis", "YanmeiWang", "LiXu", "MartaKisgati", "Jim GBegley", "John JMieyal"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.04-2991fje"}

A third group had no surgery and determined baseline RV function. Eight weeks later, global systolic function was assessed by the preload recruitable stroke work relationship. Regional systolic function was measured by systolic area contraction (SAC), calculated by high density mechanical mapping. Tau was used to assess global diastolic function. Recoil rate and diastolic shear were used as measures of regional diastolic function. After functional data acquisition, tissue was fixed for histological evaluation. Global systolic and diastolic functions were similar at baseline and after ECM and Dacron implantation. Regional systolic function was greater in the ECM group compared with the Dacron group (SAC: 4.1+/-0.9% versus -1.8+/-1.1, P<0.05). Regional diastolic function was also greater in the ECM group (recoil rate (degrees sec(-1)): -44+/-7 versus -17+/-2, ECM versus Dacron; P<0.05).

In order to identify the positive inotropic, positive lusitropic and vasodilator effects of both agonists also in vivo, we have determined their effects on the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), the rate of intraventricular pressure rise (+dP dt(-1)(max)) and decline (-dP dt(-1)(max)), the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the mesenteric blood flow (MBF) in pithed and vagotomized rats. 2 CGP 12177 (0.1-100 nmol kg(-1)) and cyanopindolol (1-1000 nmol kg(-1)) dose-dependently enhanced all cardiac parameters. The nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bupranolol 10 micromol kg(-1) diminished the CGP 12177 (100 nmol kg(-1))-stimulated increases in LVSP from 26.3+/-8.2 to 13.1+/-1.8 mmHg (P<0.05), +dP dt(-1)(max) from 5287+/-290 to 2439+/-296 mmHg s(-1) (P<0.001) and -dP dt(-1)(max) from -3836+/-301 to -2187+/-443 mmHg s(-1) (P<0.05), respectively. The beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A 10 micromol kg(-1) (known to block the low-affinity state of beta(1)-adrenoceptors at high doses) inhibited increases in +/-dP dt(-1)(max) elicited by the highest dose of CGP 12177. 3 The highest doses of CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol increased DBP by about 10 mmHg and MBF by 1.4+/-0.3 and 0.6+/-0.3 ml min(-1), respectively.

Sixty-four German Holstein and German Simmental bulls were randomly allocated to either an indoor concentrate system or periods of pasture feeding followed by a finishing period on a concentrate containing linseed to enhance their beef content of n-3 PUFA and CLA. The concentrations of CLA isomers in the different tissues were determined by GC and silver ion HPLC. The diet affected the distribution of individual CLA isomers in the lipids of the different tissues. The concentration (mg/100 g fresh tissue) of the most prominent isomer, cis-9,trans-11 18:2, was increased up to 1.5 times in liver and heart tissue of bulls fed on pasture as compared with concentrate. However, no diet effect was observed for cis-9,trans-11 18:2 in the lipids of longissimus muscle and subcutaneous fat. In all tissues, the second-most abundant CLA isomer in concentrate-fed bulls was trans-7,cis-9 18:2. In contrast, trans-11,cis-13 18:2 was the second-most abundant CLA isomer in all investigated tissue lipids of pasture-fed bulls. The concentration of the trans-11,cis-13 18:2 isomer was up to 15 times higher in tissues of pasture-fed bulls as compared with concentrate-fed animals. Furthermore, diet affected the concentrations of the CLA trans,trans 18:2 isomers. Pasture feeding significantly increased the concentrations of some trans,trans 18:2 isomers as compared with concentrate, predominantly trans-12,trans-14 18:2 and trans-11,trans-13 18:2.

The bcl-2 expression level was significantly higher in the hearts of MPSS-treated rats compared to that of other TBI groups (p < 0.0001).

{"title": "Genetic modification of the heart: transgenic modification of cardiac lipid and carbohydrate utilization.", "abstract": "Many recent advances in cardiovascular research have been made possible by the use of transgenic technology. This review will discuss a number of mouse models where transgenic technology has been utilized to alter expression of genes involved in cardiac uptake and metabolism of either lipid or carbohydrate. Particular attention will be paid to the proteins which regulate (1) carbohydrate and lipid transport into cardiomyocytes and (2) the subsequent metabolic process which occur within the cytosol. These steps are important in determining substrate availability for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The heart relies predominantly on fatty acids as its major fuel supply, while glucose and lactate provide a small percentage. Under certain conditions, this balance becomes altered such that the heart relies more on glucose, as seen in pathological hypertrophy or may rely almost solely on fatty acids, as observed in cardiac tissue of animal models of diabetes. Initially this switch in metabolic substrate provides adequate energy to maintain normal cardiac function however with time diastolic dysfunction and cardiac failure often occur associated with depletion in high-energy phosphates. The creation of transgenic mice with altered expression of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism have provided a unique insight into the fine balance which exits in the mouse heart to maintain energy status and cardiac function.

To investigate this hypothesis, acute fatal KD cardiac tissues were immunostained for angiogenic inducers and inhibitors. Microvessel density was determined and the degree of inflammation assessed. Marked inflammation and angiogenesis were found in acute KD CA aneurysms and myocardium, with the highest microvessel density seen in patients who died 2-3 weeks after onset of the disease. Expression of proangiogenic proteins was higher than expression of inhibitors in KD CA aneurysms and myocardium. Angiogenesis mediators were localized to inflammatory cells in the myointima, adventitia, and myocardium.

Recently, we reported that AF was associated with endocardial dysfunction, limited to the left atrium (LA) and LAA and manifest as reduced nitric oxide (NO*) production and increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. We hypothesized that reduced LAA NO* levels observed in AF may be associated with increased superoxide (O2*-) production.\nAfter a week of AF induced by rapid atrial pacing in pigs, O2*- production from acutely isolated heart tissue was measured by 2 independent techniques, electron spin resonance and superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome C reduction assays. Compared with control animals with equivalent ventricular heart rates, basal O2*- production was increased 2.7-fold (P<0.01) and 3.0-fold (P<0.02) in the LA and LAA, respectively. A similar 3.0-fold (P<0.01) increase in LAA O2*- production was observed using a cytochrome C reduction assay. The increases could not be explained by changes in atrial total superoxide dismutase activity. Addition of either apocyanin or oxypurinol reduced LAA O2*-, implying that NADPH and xanthine oxidases both contributed to increased O2*- production in AF. Enzyme assays of atrial tissue homogenates confirmed increases in LAA NAD(P)H oxidase (P=0.04) and xanthine oxidase (P=0.01) activities. Although there were no changes in expression of the NADPH oxidase subunits, the increase in superoxide production was accompanied by an increase in GTP-loaded Rac1, an activator of the NADPH oxidase.\nAF increased O2*- production in both the LA and LAA. Increased NAD(P)H oxidase and xanthine oxidase activities contributed to the observed increase in LAA O2*- production.

We report a particular clinical case of cardiac angiosarcoma, its light and transmission electron microscopic aspects and a review of the recent literature.\nA 52 years old man died for a severe right ventricle filling deficit caused by an intracavitary tumour originated from the right atrial anterolateral wall. The fragments obtained from autoptic tumoral cardiac tissue were processed for light and electron microscopy. The section were stained with haematoxilineosin, Masson trichromic and Gomori method. An immunohistochemical study for vimentin, Factor VIII related antigen and peroxidase-conjugated lectin from Ulex Europaeus was also performed using the unlabed peroxidase-antiperoxidase method.\nThe hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that the tumoral mass was composed by a well-differentiated histotype characterized by numerous vascular areas in which neoplastic cells were loosely and irregularly arranged to form incomplete vessels or anastomized blood-filled vascular channels. On the other hand, some less-differentiated solid areas were present and irregularly surrounded the differentiated vascular areas. Results of Ulex Europeaeus Agglutinin I labelling were positive in both solid and vascular areas of the tumour although the positive reaction was less evident in the solid zones Factor VIII related antigen positive cells were less numerous and mainly found in vascular areas. The observation by electron microscopy showed the lack of evident pinocytotic vesicles, the presence of thin and delicate cytoplasmatic processes, Weibel-Palade bodies, and also the disarrangement of the extracellular fibrous matrix.\nThe light microscopy observation and immunohistochemical study underscore that is not easy to obtain information about the level of differentiation of this tumour. The presence of blood-filled lumina and the identification of typical markers of endothelial cells seems to indicate a well-differentiated nature. However, the ultrastructural findings seem to indicate a less differentiated nature.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2005-09-01", "authors": ["FCarpino", "FPezzoli", "VPetrozza", "GCarpino", "AEvangelista", "DMutone", "MReali", "CGaudio"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Rheumatic fever: how S. pyogenes-primed peripheral T cells trigger heart valve lesions.", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of rheumatic fever (RF) is related to autoimmune humoral and cellular responses against human tissues triggered by Streptococcus pyogenes. CD4(+) T cells are the ultimate effectors of chronic heart lesions in rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Heart-infiltrating CD4(+) T cell clones are able to recognize heart tissue and streptococcal antigens by molecular mimicry. The streptococcal M5(81-103) region, an immunodominant region, was recognized by both intralesional and peripheral T cell clones (62% and 38%, respectively). Peripheral T lymphocytes from Brazilian patients with severe RHD preferentially recognized the M5(81-96) peptide, in the context of HLA-DR7(+) and DR53(+) molecules. HLA-DR7 seems to be related to the development of multiple valvular lesions in RHD patients from different countries. In addition, the fact that peripheral and intralesional T cells recognized the M5(81-103) region points to this region as one of the streptococcal triggers of autoimmune reactions in RHD. T cell repertoire analysis from peripheral and intralesional T cell lines derived from RHD patients showed several oligoclonal expansions of BV families. Major expansions were found in the heart lesions, suggesting that such T cell populations preferentially migrate from the periphery to the heart. Some cross-reactive intralesional T cell clones displayed the same T cell receptor (TCR) BVBJ and CDR3 sequences, showing a degenerate pattern of antigen recognition. Heart tissue-infiltrating cells from myocardium and valvular tissue produced TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-4, whereas few cells from valvular tissue produced IL-4, showing that the lack of regulation in the valves could be responsible for the permanent and progressive valvular lesions.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2005-08-30", "authors": ["LGuilherme", "K CFa\u00e9", "S EOshiro", "A CTanaka", "P M APomerantzeff", "JKalil"], "doi": "10.1196/annals.1361.054"}
{"title": "Soft tissue impact characterisation kit (STICK) for ex situ investigation of heart rhythm responses to acute mechanical stimulation.", "abstract": "Both mechanical induction and mechanical termination of arrhythmias have been reported in man. Examples include pre-cordial impacts by sports implements (baseballs, pucks) that can trigger arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, or via the so-called pre-cordial thump, used as an emergency resuscitation measure to convert arrhythmias to normal sinus node rhythm. These interventions have been partially reproduced in experimental studies on whole animals. Relating observations at the system's level to underlying mechanisms has been difficult, however, largely because of: (i) a deficit in efficient and affordable pharmacological agents to selectively target (sub-)cellular responses in whole animal studies, and (ii) the lack of suitable experimental models to study the above responses at intermediate levels of functional and structural integration, such as the isolated heart or cardiac tissue. This paper presents a soft tissue impact characterisation kit (STICK), suitable for quantitative investigations into the effects of acute mechanical stimulation on cardiac electro-mechanical function in rodent isolated heart or tissue preparations. The STICK offers independent control over a range of relevant biophysical parameters, such as impact location and energy, pre-impact projectile speed and contact area, as well as over the timing of a mechanical stimulus relative to the cardiac cycle (monitored via electrocardiogram, ECG, here recorded directly from the cardiac surface). Projectile deceleration upon interaction with the tissue is monitored, contact-free, with a resolution of 175 microm, providing information on tissue deformation dynamics, force, pressure and work of the mechanical intervention. In order to study functional effects of cardiac mechanical stimulation in the absence of tissue damage, impacts must be limited (for juvenile Guinea pig heart) to 2-2.5 mJ in the slack left ventricle (diastolic impact) and 5-10 mJ in contracture (systolic impact), as confirmed by enzyme assay and histological investigation. Impacts, timed to coincide with the early T-wave of the ECG, are capable of triggering short runs of ventricular fibrillation. Thus, the STICK is a suitable tool for the study of acute cardiac mechano-electric feedback effects, caused by short impulse-like mechanical stimulation, at the level of the isolated organ or tissue.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2005-08-30", "authors": ["Patricia JCooper", "AviEpstein", "Iain AMacleod", "Sarah T MSchaaf", "JudithSheldon", "ChristianBoulin", "PeterKohl"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2005.07.004"}

We investigated the effects of various cannabinoids in spontaneously beating Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. Bolus injections of anandamide (0.1-1 micromol) caused no change in coronary flow (CF) or left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP). In hearts preperfused with vasopressin to induce vasoconstrictor tone, anandamide or the selective CB1 receptor agonist ACEA (1-100 nmol) dose-dependently increased CF by up to 267% and LVSP by 20 mm Hg. The metabolically stable endocannabinoid derivatives, R-methanandamide and noladin ether, displayed similar effects. In contrast, Delta-THC (10-100 nmol), the major psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, strongly decreased CF and LVSP. The CB2 receptor agonist JWH-133 (10-100 nmol) elicited vasodilator and positive inotropic effects only at higher doses. The CB1 antagonists SR141716A and AM-251 as well as the potassium channel inhibitors tetraethylammonium and iberiotoxin blocked the anandamide-induced increases in CF and LVSP, whereas the CB2 antagonist SR144528 and the putative \"CB3 antagonist\" O-1918 did not have an inhibitory effect. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of cardiac CB1 but no CB2 receptors. Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol were detected in heart tissue. However, combined application of fatty acid amidohydrolase inhibitors and the transport inhibitor AM-404 to augment tissue levels of endocannabinoids was without effect on CF or LVSP.

{"title": "The dynamics of cardiac fibrillation.", "abstract": "Reentry occurs when the electrical wave propagating through the atria or ventricles breaks locally and forms a rotor (also called a scroll wave or functional reentry). If the waves propagating outward from a rotor develop additional wavebreaks (which may form new rotors), fibrillation results. Tissue heterogeneity, exacerbated by electrical and structural remodeling from cardiac disease, has traditionally been considered the major factor promoting wavebreak and its degeneration to fibrillation. Recently, however, dynamic factors have also been recognized to play a key role. Dynamic factors refer to cellular properties of the cardiac action potential and Ca(i) cycling, which dynamically generate wave instability and wavebreak, even in tissue that is initially completely homogeneous. Although the latter situation can only be created in computer simulations, its relevance to real (heterogeneous) cardiac tissue has been unequivocally demonstrated. Dynamic factors are related to membrane voltage (Vm) and Ca(i). Vm factors include electrical restitution of action potential duration and conduction velocity, short-term cardiac memory, and electrotonic currents. Ca(i) factors are related to dynamic Ca(i) cycling properties. They act synergistically, as well as with tissue heterogeneity, to promote wavebreak and fibrillation. As global properties, rather than local electrophysiological characteristics, dynamic factors represent an attractive target for novel therapies to prevent ventricular fibrillation.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2005-08-24", "authors": ["James NWeiss", "ZhilinQu", "Peng-ShengChen", "Shien-FongLin", "Hrayr SKaragueuzian", "HidekiHayashi", "AlanGarfinkel", "AlainKarma"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.529545"}

Three subtypes (beta1, beta2, and beta3) are expressed in heart tissue, and the role of each subtype in regulating cardiac function has previously been determined by using both pharmacological and gene-targeting approaches. However, previous studies have only examined the role of beta-ARs in the macrolevel regulation of HR. We employed three knockout (KO) mouse lines, beta1-KO, beta2-KO, and beta1/beta2 double KO (DL-KO), to examine the role that beta-AR subtypes play in HR variability (HRV) and in the sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs into HR control. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) in frequency domain methods of ECG spectral analysis was used to resolve HRV into high- and low-frequency (HF and LF) powers. Resting HR (in beats/min) was decreased in beta1-KO [488 (SD 27)] and DL-KO [495 (SD 12)] mice compared with wild-type [WT; 638 (SD 30)] or beta2-KO [656 (SD 51)] (P < 0.0005) mice.

{"title": "Biochemical dysfunction in heart mitochondria exposed to ischaemia and reperfusion.", "abstract": "Heart tissue is remarkably sensitive to oxygen deprivation. Although heart cells, like those of most tissues, rapidly adapt to anoxic conditions, relatively short periods of ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion lead to extensive tissue death during cardiac infarction. Heart tissue is not readily regenerated, and permanent heart damage is the result. Although mitochondria maintain normal heart function by providing virtually all of the heart's ATP, they are also implicated in the development of ischaemic damage. While mitochondria do provide some mechanisms that protect against ischaemic damage (such as an endogenous inhibitor of the F1Fo-ATPase and antioxidant enzymes), they also possess a range of elements that exacerbate it, including ROS (reactive oxygen species) generators, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and their ability to release apoptotic factors. This review considers the process of ischaemic damage from a mitochondrial viewpoint. It considers ischaemic changes in the inner membrane complexes I-V, and how this might affect formation of ROS and high-energy phosphate production/degradation. We discuss the contribution of various mitochondrial cation channels to ionic imbalances which seem to be a major cause of reperfusion injury. The different roles of the H+, Ca2+ and the various K+ channel transporters are considered, particularly the K+(ATP) (ATP-dependent K+) channels. A possible role for the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in ischaemic damage is assessed. Finally, we summarize the metabolic and pharmacological interventions that have been used to alleviate the effects of ischaemic injury, highlighting the value of these or related interventions in possible therapeutics.", "journal": "The Biochemical journal", "date": "2005-08-20", "authors": ["GiancarloSolaini", "David AHarris"], "doi": "10.1042/BJ20042006"}

The descent from refractoriness for anodal stimulation was extremely steep, and a local minimum was clearly observed. The subsequent ascending limb had either a dome-shaped maximum or was flattened, appearing as a plateau. The cathodal S-I curves were smoother, closer to a hyperbolic shape. The transition of the stimulation mechanism from break to make always coincided with the final descending phase of both anodal and cathodal S-I curves. The transition is attributed to the bidomain properties of cardiac tissue. The effective refractory period was longer when negative stimuli were delivered than for positive stimulation.

{"title": "Markers for perioperative myocardial ischemia: what both interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons need to know.", "abstract": "All novel markers of myocardial ischemia (ischemia-modified albumin, choline, unbound free fatty acids) lack cardiac specificity. Therefore, for the specific detection of myocardial ischemia selective blood sampling from an inserted coronary sinus catheter is needed, which limits the applicability of these markers in most clinical routine settings. In addition, the superiority of these novel markers over the calculation of myocardial lactate production, the current criterion standard for the laboratory diagnosis of myocardial ischemia, has not been demonstrated so far, and even comparative data is frequently lacking. Further the superiority of these new candidate markers over lactate determination for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia in peripherally drawn blood samples has not been demonstrated either, and these novel parameters appear not to be a breakthrough for laboratory diagnosis of myocardial ischemia during or after percutaneous coronary interventions or coronary artery bypass grafting. The determination of cardiac troponin I or troponin T is the current criterion standard for the laboratory diagnosis of myocardial damage due to their higher sensitivities and specificities compared to creatine kinase isoenzyme MB. According to current knowledge, troponin increases in peripherally drawn blood samples must be regarded as an indicator of myocardial necrosis which, however, may be limited, only detectable by troponin and may be missed by creatine kinase isoenzyme MB determination. After on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting the generally applied troponin discriminator limits are not valid as there is limited, inevitable cardiac tissue damage occurring during the surgical procedure. Therefore, troponins are significantly increased after reperfusion of the arrested heart over values seen before bypass and also in patients without complications. Perioperative myocardial infarctions can be reliably identified by their characteristic troponin time courses, and both peak concentrations and time of peak values are diagnostic criteria. Troponin release is lower in off-pump compared to on-pump bypass surgery. Despite the controversy over the significance of troponin elevations after clinically uncomplicated and successful procedures, it is tempting to postulate that less myocardial damage as detected by troponin release is beneficial for the patient. After elective percutaneous coronary interventions, only troponin increases >8-fold the upper reference limit were associated with increased mortality in long-term follow-up.", "journal": "The heart surgery forum", "date": "2005-08-16", "authors": ["JohannesMair", "AngelikaHammerer-Lercher"], "doi": "10.1532/HSF98.20051123"}
{"title": "Transgenic overexpression of SUR1 in the heart suppresses sarcolemmal K(ATP).", "abstract": "The lack of pathological consequences of cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP)) channel gene manipulation is in stark contrast to the effect of similar perturbations in the pancreatic beta-cell. Because the pancreatic and cardiac channel share the same pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2), the different effects of genetic manipulation likely reflect, at least in part, the tissue-specific expression of the regulatory subunit (SUR1 in pancreas vs. SUR2A in heart) of the bipartite channel complex. To examine this, we have generated transgenic (TG) mice that overexpress epitope-tagged SUR1 or SUR2A under the transcriptional control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. Western blot and real time RT-PCR analysis confirm transgene expression in the heart, and variable levels of SUR1 RNA and protein, in 16 viable founder lines. Surprisingly, activation of channels by either pharmacological agents (diazoxide and pinacidil) or metabolic inhibitors (oligomycin and 2-deoxyglucose) reveals a suppression of total K(ATP) conductance in high expressing TG mice. Moreover, K(ATP) channel activity was significantly reduced in excised cardiac patches from TG myocytes that overexpress either SUR1 or SUR2A. Using a recombinant cell system, we show that overexpression of either SUR1 or Kir6.2 suppresses the functional expression of K(ATP) from optimized dimeric SUR1-Kir6.2. Thus, the graded effect of SUR1 expression in the intact heart appears to demonstrate an in vivo requirement for 1:1 expression ratio of Kir6.2 and SURx.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2005-08-16", "authors": ["Thomas PFlagg", "Maria SaraRemedi", "RicardMasia", "JeffersonGomes", "MeredithMcLerie", "Anatoli NLopatin", "Colin GNichols"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.06.003"}

Its clinical spectrum ranges from blunt cardiac injury (BCI) to complete rupture of cardiac tissues, with cardiac valvular injury often being overlooked.\nTo determine whether hospitalised BCI is associated with increased risk of cardiac valve insufficiency in a large multi-state hospitalised population.\nCases with BCI and cardiac valve insufficiency were identified based on discharge diagnoses in 1997 statewide hospital discharge data from 19 states. Four valvular outcomes were studied: (1) mitral valve insufficiency, incompetence, regurgitation (MVIIR); (2) aortic valve insufficiency, incompetence, regurgitation, stenosis (AVIIRS); (3) tricuspid valve insufficiency, incompetence, regurgitation, stenosis (TVIIRS); and (4) pulmonary valve insufficiency, incompetence, regurgitation, stenosis (PVIIRS).\nAmong 1,051,081 injury discharges, 2709 (0.26%) people had BCI; 13,087 (1.25%) had MVIIR; 9811 (0.93%) had AVIIRS; 1338 (0.13%) had TVIIRS; 178 (0.02%) had PVIIRS. Independent of potential confounding factors, discharge for BCI was associated with a 12-fold increased risk for TVIIRS and a 3.4-fold increased risk for AVIIRS.\nCardiac valve insufficiency has been well recognised as an important risk factor for congestive heart failure.

TGF-beta1 and PrCol1 were upregulated in DCM only, while bFGF was upregulated in both groups versus controls. TGF-beta1 downregulated MMP-1 and upregulated collagen 1, whereas bFGF upregulated MMP-13 in DCM tissue. Post-transplant PrCol1-alpha1, -alpha2 and ET-1 mRNA increased over time in grafts of DCM patients only, while other factors returned to control baseline levels in DCM and ICM.

Previous studies have shown that it is dramatically upregulated in fast-to-slow fiber-type transformation and also after eccentric contraction (EC)-induced muscle injury. The functional consequences of this upregulation, if any, are unclear. In the present study, we have examined the skeletal muscle phenotype of MLP-knockout (MLPKO) mice in terms of their response to EC-induced muscle injuries. The data suggest that while the MLPKO mice recover completely after EC-induced injury, their torque production lags behind that of heterozygous littermates in the early stages of the recovery process. This lag is accompanied by decreased expression of the muscle regulatory factor MyoD, suggesting that MLP may influence gene expression. In addition, there is evidence of type I fiber atrophy and a shorter resting sarcomere length in the MLPKO mice, but no significant differences in fiber type distribution. In summary, MLP appears to play a subtle role in the maintenance of normal muscle characteristics and in the early events of the recovery process of skeletal muscle to injury, serving both structural and gene-regulatory roles.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Renal insufficiency increases plasma homocysteine (Hcy), and levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) are inversely related to plasma Hcy levels. We hypothesize that in RVH, accumulation of collagen between the endothelium and myocytes leads to endothelial-myocyte disconnection and uncoupling, in part, by hyperhomocysteinemia. Furthermore, we hypothesize that Hcy increases reactive oxygen species, generates nitrotyrosine, activates latent matrix metalloproteinase, and decreases the levels of endothelial nitric oxide in response to antagonizing PPAR-gamma. To create RVH in mice, the left renal artery was clipped with 0.4-mm silver wire for the 2 kidney, 1 clip (2K1C) method. Sham surgery was used as a control. To induce PPAR-gamma, 8 microg/mL ciglitazone (CZ) was administered to drinking water 2 days before surgery and continued for 4 weeks. Mice were grouped as 2K1C, sham, 2K1C+CZ, or sham+CZ (n = 6 in each group). Plasma Hcy increased 2-fold in the 2K1C-treated group (p < 0.05) as compared with the sham, and CZ had no effect on Hcy levels as compared to the 2K1C-treated group. Hcy binding in cardiac tissue homogenates decreased in the 2K1C-treated group but was substantially higher in the CZ-treated group. Cardiac reactive oxygen species levels were increased and endothelial nitric oxide were decreased in the 2K1C-treated group. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activities were increased in the 2K1C-treated group compared with the control. Levels of cardiac inhibitor of metalloproteinase were decreased, whereas there was no change in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression in the 2K1C-treated group vs. the sham-treated group. Collagen and nitrotyrosine levels were increased in the 2K1C-treated group, but mice treated with CZ showed lower levels comparatively. Cardiac transferase deoxyuridine nick-end labeling-positive cells were increased, and muscle cells were impaired in the 2K1C-treated mice vs. the sham-control mice. This was associated with decreased acetylcholine and bradykinin responses, which suggests endothelial-myocyte uncoupling in 2K1C-treated mice.

{"title": "Angiotensin II receptor blockade and ventricular remodelling.", "abstract": "Cardiac remodelling is the expression of molecular, cellular and interstitial changes in response to cardiac injury, manifesting as adverse alterations in the size, shape and function of the ventricle. Several clinical studies have documented significant elevations in the levels of renin, angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone attending acute myocardial infarction and/or congestive heart failure. Similar to catecholamines, markedly elevated activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is associated with poor prognosis. The effects of Ang II upon cardiac tissue are related to two primary receptors, Ang II type 1 (AT1) and Ang II type 2 (AT2). The AT1-receptor appears to mediate many of the deleterious effects of chronic RAAS activity, while the AT2-receptor is increasingly shown to have potential cardioprotective effects. Attenuating the deleterious effects of sustained Ang II stimulation can be achieved by direct inhibition of angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) and/or direct antagonism of AT receptors. ACE inhibition reduces left ventricular (LV) volumes, retards the progression of LV dilatation and hypertrophy and increases systolic function in systolic dysfunction. By blocking at the receptor level, Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) provide an alternative and more direct approach to inhibiting the effects of Ang II; however, data relating to their effects upon ventricular remodelling, whether used in isolation or in combination with ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is), are less convincing. Data arising from several recent clinical trials suggest that simultaneous use of ACE-Is and ARBs maybe of more benefit in attenuating ventricular remodelling than either agent alone.", "journal": "Journal of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system : JRAAS", "date": "2005-08-10", "authors": ["Nagesh SAnavekar", "Scott DSolomon"], "doi": "10.3317/jraas.2005.006"}

In this in vitro system, fibroblasts form contacts with other fibroblasts and myocytes, which can support homogeneous and heterogeneous gap junctional coupling, as observed in vivo.

KCOs activate the ATP-sensitive potassium current [IK(ATP)], resulting in action potential duration (APD) shortening, especially under pathological conditions such as ischemia. Acute myocardial ischemia leads to electrophysiological inhomogeneities in APD, conduction velocity, and refractoriness, which provide the substrate for reentry initiation and maintenance and may lead to malignant arrhythmias. The aim of this work is to analyze the effect of the KCO pinacidil on vulnerability to reentry during acute regional ischemia using computer simulations. We use a two-dimensional virtual heart tissue with implementation of acute regional ischemia conditions. Membrane kinetics are represented by a modified version of Luo-Rudy (phase II) action potential model that incorporates the effect of pinacidil on IK(ATP). The vulnerable window (VW) for reentry is quantified for different doses of pinacidil. Our results show that for doses below 3 micromol/l the VW widens with increasing pinacidil concentration, whereas for higher doses of pinacidil the VW decreases, becoming zero for concentrations above 10 micromol/l. The ionic mechanisms involved in this behavior are explored. This study demonstrates that the effect of pinacidil on arrhythmogenesis is strongly dose-dependent, and that high doses of pinacidil exert a strong antiarrhythmic effect.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2005-08-03", "authors": ["BeatrizTr\u00e9nor", "Jos\u00e9 MFerrero", "BlancaRodr\u00edguez", "FulgencioMontilla"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-005-3554-4"}

{"title": "Genesis of ectopic waves: role of coupling, automaticity, and heterogeneity.", "abstract": "Many arrhythmias are believed to be triggered by ectopic sources arising from the border of the ischemic tissue. However, the development of ectopic activity from individual sources to a larger mass of cardiac tissue remains poorly understood. To address this critical issue, we used monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to create conditions that promoted progression of ectopic activity from single cells to the network that consisted of hundreds of cells. To explain complex spatiotemporal patterns observed in these experiments we introduced a new theoretical framework. The framework's main feature is a parameter space diagram, which uses cell automaticity and coupling as two coordinates. The diagram allows one to depict network behavior, quantitatively address the heterogeneity factor, and evaluate transitions between different regimes. The well-organized wave trains were observed at moderate and high cell coupling values and network heterogeneity was found to be qualitatively unimportant for these regimes. In contrast, at lower values of coupling, spontaneous ectopic activity led to the appearance of fragmented ectopic waves. For these regimes, network heterogeneity played an essential role. The ectopic waves occasionally gave rise to spiral activity in two different regions within the parameter space via two distinct mechanisms. Together, our results suggest that localized ectopic waves represent an essential step in the progression of ectopic activity. These studies add to the understanding of initiation and progression of arrhythmias and can be applied to other phenomena that deal with assemblies of coupled oscillators.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2005-08-02", "authors": ["AlainPumir", "AraArutunyan", "ValentinKrinsky", "NarineSarvazyan"], "doi": "10.1529/biophysj.105.061820"}

Expression of PAI-1, a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, is induced in ischemic heart tissue.\nA sequence-specific catalytic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) enzyme was used to reduce PAI-1 levels in cultured endothelial cells and in ischemic myocardium.

{"title": "Head-tail interactions in numerical simulations of reentry in a ring of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "The relationships between action potential duration (APD) and conduction velocity (CV) to the previous diastolic interval (DI) are known as the APD and CV restitution relationships. There is considerable debate regarding the importance of these relationships in the development and stability of reentry.\nThe purpose of this study was to increase the understanding of the ionic basis for restitution during reentry.\nAPD and CV were studied numerically during one-dimensional reentry as ring length (L) was shortened. A three-state variable model (u, v, w) was used to analyze the effect of gating variables of the fast (v) and slow (w) currents on the spatial and temporal dynamics of transmembrane potential (u). Three parameter sets were used corresponding to three APD and CV restitution curves.\nSustained spatial oscillations of APD and CV larger than the ring length were observed in two of the parameter sets (cytochalasin-D model [CYTO] and model 3 [M3]) before block occurred at L = 6 cm. The last model (diacetyl monoxime [DAM]) resulted in uniform APD and CV for all L until block occurred at L = 3 cm. Multivalued APD and CV restitution relationships due to \"dephasing\" of w and v with DI were observed in M3 and CYTO simulations. Overall, these dynamics could be explained by the wavelength-to-ring length ratio and the sensitivity of APD on the value of the gating variables w and v.\nPropagation stability is mostly controlled by APD sensitivity to w, but the APD restitution slope does not always reflect this sensitivity. The interaction of the dynamic history (i.e., memory) of the fast and slow currents and electrotonic effects resulted in multivalued restitution curves.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2005-07-30", "authors": ["XiaozhongChen", "Flavio HFenton", "Richard AGray"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2005.05.012"}
{"title": "Gold-tip electrodes--a new \"deep lesion\" technology for catheter ablation? In vitro comparison of a gold alloy versus platinum-iridium tip electrode ablation catheter.", "abstract": "Gold-tip electrodes. Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation is widely used to induce focal myocardial necrosis using the effect of resistive heating through high-frequency current delivery. It is current standard to limit the target tissue-electrode interface temperature to a maximum of 60-70 degrees C to avoid char formation. Gold (Au) exhibits a thermal conductivity of nearly four times greater than platinum (Pt-Ir) (3.17 W/cm Kelvin vs 0.716 W/cm Kelvin), it was therefore hypothesized that RF ablation using a gold electrode would create broader and deeper lesions as a result of a better heat conduction from the tissue-electrode interface and additional cooling of the gold electrode by \"heat loss\" to the intracardiac blood. Both mechanisms would allow applying more RF power to the tissue before the electrode-tissue interface temperature limit is reached. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro isolated liver and pig heart investigations comparing lesion depths of a new Au-alloy-tip electrode to standard Pt-Ir electrode material. Mean lesion depth in liver tissue for Pt-Ir was 4.33+/-0.45 mm (n=60) whereas Au electrode was able to achieve significantly deeper lesions (5.86+/-0.37 mm [n=60; P<0.001]). The mean power delivered using Pt-Ir was 6.95+/-2.41 W whereas Au tip electrode delivered 9.64+/-3.78 W indicating a statistically significant difference (P<0.05).

Gold-tip electrode catheters were able to induce deeper lesions using RF ablation in vitro as compared to Pt-Ir tip electrode material.

In this study, we use quinidine as an example of highly proarrhythmic agent to investigate the risk factors that may facilitate the proarrhythmic effects of drugs. We studied the influence of pacing, extracellular potassium, and pH on quinidine's IKr blocking effect, all potential factors influencing quinidine's cardiac toxicity. Since the HERG gene encodes IKr, we studied quinidine's effect on HERG expressed in Xenopus oocytes by the 2-electrode voltage clamp technique. When extracellular K+ was 5 mmol/L, quinidine blocked the HERG current dose dependently, with an IC50 of 6.3 +/- 0.2 micromol/L. The blockade was much more prominent at more positive membrane potentials. The inhibition of HERG by quinidine was not use dependent. There was no significant difference between block with or without pacing. When extracellular K+ was lowered to 2.5 mmol/L, the current inhibition by quinidine was enhanced, and IC50 decreased to 4.6 +/- 0.5 micromol/L. At 10 mmol/L extracellular K+, there was less inhibition by quinidine and the IC50 was 11.2 +/- 3.1 micromol/L. Extracellular acidification decreased both steady state and tail currents of HERG. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of quinidine on IKr was decreased with extracellular acidification, which may produce heterogeneity in the repolarization between normal and ischemic cardiac tissue. Thus, the use-independent blockade of IKr by QT-prolonging agents such as quinidine may contribute to cardiac toxicity with bradycardia, hypokalemia, and acidosis further exaggerating the proarrhythmic potential of these agents.", "journal": "American journal of therapeutics", "date": "2005-07-26", "authors": ["CongrongLin", "IvanaCvetanovic", "XiaogangKe", "VasantRanade", "JohnSomberg"], "doi": "10.1097/01.mjt.0000143698.53038.1b"}

While basal force of contraction was unchanged, contractile responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor agonists was markedly impaired (active force declined to 51% of controls) and was associated with decreased lusitropy. Moreover, in ET-1+ISO-treated heart tissues, reprogramming of gene expression was observed with an increased ratio of beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) to alpha-MHC mRNA and increased transcript levels of ANF and skeletal/smooth muscle alpha-actin isoforms.

In addition, U0126 completely normalized ANF gene expression, but did not affect or only marginally affected expression of MHC and alpha-actin isoforms.\nThese results suggest that interruption of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway with a specific MEK inhibitor prevents, in part, the occurrence of a pathologic phenotype secondary to excessive stimulation with neurohumoral factors.

The successful engraftment of various cell types resulting in improved cardiac function has been reported, however methods for improving the delivery of donor cells to the infarct site still need to be developed. The use of bioengineered cardiac grafts has been suggested to replace infarcted myocardium and enhance cardiac function. In this study, we cultured embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived cardiomyocytes on thin polyurethane (PU) films. The films were coated with gelatin, laminin or collagen IV in order to encourage cell adhesion. Constructs were examined for 30 days after seeding. Cells cultured on laminin and collagen IV, exhibited preferential attachment, as assessed by cellular counts, and viability assays. These surfaces also resulted in a greater number of contracting films compared to controls.

Among the causal factors, electrolytic alterations, direct surgical aggression on the heart tissue and alterations secondary to ischemic cell damage that is produced in the myocardial during extracorporeal circulation are found. Due to the frequency of appearance of arrhythmias, we decided to study them and know them in depth. Thus, the objective of our study was to know the incidence and prevalence of arrhythmias during the immediate post-operatory period of cardiovascular surgery. Out of all those admitted to the unit, all the patients who had undergone valvular and coronary surgery with a stay in the intensive care unit of the University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla that did not exceed 7 days were selected. This means 258 patients, the most frequent alterations during the post-operative period being right branch blockage (16%), atrial fibrillation (12%), ventricular tachycardy (7%), atrial ventricular block (4%), among other rhythm and conduction alterations. As conclusions, we stress that the most frequent alterations during the immediate post-operative period were branch blocks, arrhythmia being more prevalent than atrial fibrillation.

We have developed a rat model of pulmonary exposure to zinc to demonstrate cardiac, coagulative, and fibrinolytic alterations. Male Wistar Kyoto rats were instilled intratracheally with saline or zinc sulfate, 131 microg/kg (2 micromol/kg); the alterations were determined at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h postexposure. High-dose zinc enabled us to show changes in circulating levels of zinc above normal and induce significant pulmonary inflammation/injury such that cardiac impairments were likely. At 1-24 h postexposure, plasma levels of zinc increased to nearly 20% above the base line. Significant pulmonary inflammation and injury were determined by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histopathology in zinc-exposed rats at all time points. Starting at 4 h postexposure, pulmonary damage was accompanied by persistently increased gene expressions of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), but not thrombomodulin (TM). Cardiac tissues demonstrated similar temporal increases in expressions of TF, PAI-1, and TM mRNA following pulmonary instillation of zinc. In contrast to extensive pulmonary edema and inflammation, only mild, and focal acute, myocardial lesions developed in a few zinc-exposed rats; no histological evidence showed increased deposition of fibrin or disappearance of troponin. At 24 and 48 h postexposure to zinc, increases occurred in levels of systemic fibrinogen and the activated partial thromboplastin time.

{"title": "The new biology of aldosterone.", "abstract": "Classically, aldosterone is synthesised in the adrenal zona glomerulosa and binds to specific mineralocorticoid receptors located in the cytosol of target epithelial cells. Translocation of the resulting steroid receptor complex to the cell nucleus modulates gene expression and translation of specific 'aldosterone-induced' proteins that regulate electrolyte and fluid balance. However, non-epithelial and rapid non-genomic actions of aldosterone have also been described that account for a variety of actions of aldosterone that contribute to blood pressure homeostasis. These include key actions on endothelial cells and on cardiac tissue. There is also evidence that aldosterone can be synthesised in other tissues; the most convincing evidence relates to the central nervous system. However, suggestions that aldosterone is produced in the heart remain controversial, and adrenal derived aldosterone is the principal source of circulating and locally available hormone. Recent studies have shown major therapeutic benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism in cardiac failure, which emphasise the importance of aldosterone in causing adverse cardiovascular pathophysiological effects. Additional evidence demonstrates that aldosterone levels predict development of high blood pressure in normotensive subjects, while it is now clear that increased aldosterone action contributes to hypertension and cardiovascular damage in approximately 10% of patients with established hypertension. These new findings highlight the role of aldosterone as a key cardiovascular hormone and extend our understanding of its role in determining adverse cardiovascular outcomes.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2005-07-09", "authors": ["John M CConnell", "EleanorDavies"], "doi": "10.1677/joe.1.06017"}

Postmortem examination revealed that TH-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the epicardium were well preserved in all three patients.

This limits the radius of an in vitro engineered cardiac construct to approximately 40 microm. This study describes a method of engineering contractile three-dimensional cardiac tissue with the incorporation of an intrinsic vascular supply. Neonatal cardiac myocytes were cultured in vivo in silicone chambers, in close proximity to an intact vascular pedicle. Silicone tubes were filled with a suspension of cardiac myocytes in fibrin gel and surgically placed around the femoral artery and vein of adult rats. At 3 weeks, the tissues in the chambers were harvested for in vitro contractility evaluation and processed for histologic analysis. By 3 weeks, the chambers had become filled with living tissue. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed large amounts of muscle tissue situated around the femoral vessels. Electron micrographs revealed well-organized intracellular contractile machinery and a high degree of intercellular connectivity. Immunostaining for von Willebrand factor demonstrated neovascularization throughout the constructs. With electrical stimulation, the constructs were able to generate an average active force of 263 microN with a maximum of 843 microN. Electrical pacing was successful at frequencies of 1 to 20 Hz. In addition, the constructs exhibited positive inotropy in response to ionic calcium and positive chronotropy in response to epinephrine.

However, whether IGF-I signalling normally acts in cardiac tissues of hypertensive rats is unknown. In this study, using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SPSHR), both with early blood pressure increases, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as controls, we measured the hypertrophic and IGF-I signalling activity changes in rat hearts at 4, 6 and 12 weeks of age. Both SHR and SPSHR were found to have significantly increased blood pressures and ratios of heart- and left ventricle- to body weight at 12 weeks of age. However, IGF-IR and its downstream signalling, including the protein levels of PI3K and phosphorylated Akt, known to maintain physiological cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte survival, were downregulated. The results of dot blotting showed that cardiac mRNA levels of IGF-I in hypertensive rats were higher than those in controls starting from the age of 4 weeks. This difference suggests the increased ligand IGF-I mRNA levels may be a compensatory response caused by the impaired IGF-I signalling. Moreover, enhanced cardiac cytosolic cytochrome-c, a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway component, tended to occur in both hypertensive rats, although it did not reach a significant level. These findings indicate that impaired IGF-IR signalling occurs at early stages, and it may contribute, at least partially, to the development of hypertension and pathological cardiac hypertrophy and to cardiomyocyte apoptosis at later stages in SHR and SPSHR.", "journal": "Cell biochemistry and function", "date": "2005-07-05", "authors": ["Wei-WenKuo", "Chia-YihChu", "Chieh-HsiWu", "James ALin", "Jer-YuhLiu", "Yi-HsienHsieh", "Kwo-ChangUeng", "Shin-DaLee", "Dennis Jine-YuanHsieh", "His-HsienHsu", "Li-MienChen", "Chih-YangHuang"], "doi": "10.1002/cbf.1244"}

Confocal studies of cardiac tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing GRK2 validated the use of a semilogarithmic relationship between RF and GRK2 activity. As shown with the use of quantitative real-time RT-PCR, both GRK2 and GRK5 mRNA were not decreased at 24 h in EBZ (n = 6 dogs) relative to RS control, indicating that the decrease of GRK2 in the EBZ is likely due to posttranscriptional degradation following CAL. Pretreatment of six dogs with the selective proteasome inhibitor bortezomib provided 100% (EBZ) and 50% (infarct) protection against loss of GRK2 at 24 h.

It remained to be established whether also increases in protein levels of the nonphagocytic NADPH oxidase contribute to increased superoxide formation in diabetic vessels. To investigate changes in the expression of these homologues, we measured their expression in aortic vessels of type I diabetic rats. Eight weeks after streptozotocin treatment, we found a doubling in nox1 protein expression, while the expression of nox4 remained unchanged. This was associated with a significant increase in the NADPH oxidase activity in membrane fractions of diabetic heart and aortic tissue. Furthermore, we observed a decreased sensitivity of diabetic vessels to acetylcholine and nitroglycerin and a decrease in both acetylcholine-stimulated NO production and phosphorylation of VASP, despite an increase in endothelial NO synthase (NOSIII) expression. In addition, xanthine oxidase activity was markedly increased in plasma and 100,000 g supernatant of cardiac tissue of diabetic rats, while myocardial mitochondrial superoxide formation was only weakly enhanced.

A shift from acute towards more chronic heart disease due to atherosclerotic disease has been recognized. Modification of adaptive capacities of the cardiac muscle after damage remains a key component in the prevention of chronic cardiac disease, such as overt heart failure. It has recently been demonstrated that local insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 homeostasis in the cardiac tissue is closely involved in postischemic adaptation, such as the process of remodeling. Both experimental and clinical data support the theory that IGF-1 plays a key role in the adaptive response of the myocardium during both acute myocardial ischemia and chronic myocardial failure, regulating left ventricular remodeling and thereby restoring left ventricular architecture. This eventually leads to improvement in the function of the failing heart. While most experimental data support the beneficial role of IGF-1 in restoring architecture and function of the failing heart, clinical trials investigating the role of IGF-1 treatment of patients in cardiac failure show conflicting results.

{"title": "Cardiac tissue-specific repression of CELF activity disrupts alternative splicing and causes cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Members of the CELF family of RNA binding proteins have been implicated in alternative splicing regulation in developing heart. Transgenic mice that express a nuclear dominant-negative CELF protein specifically in the heart (MHC-CELFDelta) develop cardiac hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy with defects in alternative splicing beginning as early as 3 weeks after birth. MHC-CELFDelta mice exhibit extensive cardiac fibrosis, severe cardiac dysfunction, and premature death. Interestingly, the penetrance of the phenotype is greater in females than in males despite similar levels of dominant-negative expression, suggesting that there is sex-specific modulation of splicing activity. The cardiac defects in MHC-CELFdelta mice are directly attributable to reduced levels of CELF activity, as crossing these mice with mice overexpressing CUG-BP1, a wild-type CELF protein, rescues defects in alternative splicing, the severity and incidence of cardiac hypertrophy, and survival. We conclude that CELF protein activity is required for normal alternative splicing in the heart in vivo and that normal CELF-mediated alternative splicing regulation is in turn required for normal cardiac function.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2005-07-01", "authors": ["Andrea NLadd", "GeorgeTaffet", "CraigHartley", "Debra LKearney", "Thomas ACooper"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.25.14.6267-6278.2005"}

In particular, understanding the dynamics and the instabilities of spiral waves have become very important because they can cause reentrant tachycardia and their subsequent transitions to fibrillation. Although many aspects of cardiac spiral waves have been investigated through experiments and model simulations, their complex properties are far from well understood. Here, we show that intriguing complex-periodic (such as period-2, period-3, period-4, or aperiodic) spiral wave states can arise in monolayer tissues of cardiac cell culture in vitro, and demonstrate that these different dynamic states can coexist with abrupt and spontaneous transitions among them without any change in system parameters; in other words, the medium supports multistability. Based on extensive image data analysis, we have confirmed that these spiral waves are driven by their tips tracing complex orbits whose unusual, meandering shapes are formed by delicate interplay between localized conduction blocks and nonlinear properties of the culture medium.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2005-06-30", "authors": ["Seong-MinHwang", "Tae YunKim", "Kyoung JLee"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0501539102"}

Dexrazoxane undergoes initial metabolism to its two one-ring open intermediates and is then further metabolized to its active metal ion-binding form ADR-925. The metabolism of these intermediates to the ring-opened metal-chelating product ADR-925 has been determined in a rat model to identify the mechanism by which dexrazoxane is activated. The plasma concentrations of both intermediates rapidly decreased after their i.v. administration to rats. A maximum concentration of ADR-925 was detected 2 min after i.v. bolus administration, indicating that these intermediates were both rapidly metabolized in vivo to ADR-925. The kinetics of the initial appearance of ADR-925 was consistent with formation rate-limited metabolism of the intermediates. After administration of dexrazoxane or its two intermediates, ADR-925 was detected in significant levels in both heart and liver tissue but was undetectable in brain tissue. The rapid rate of metabolism of the intermediates was consistent with their hydrolysis by tissue dihydroorotase. The rapid appearance of ADR-925 in plasma may make ADR-925 available to be taken up by heart tissue and bind free iron. These studies showed that the two one-ring open metabolites of dexrazoxane were rapidly metabolized in the rat to ADR-925, and thus, these results provide a mechanism by which dexrazoxane is activated to its active metal-binding form.", "journal": "Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals", "date": "2005-06-28", "authors": ["Patricia ESchroeder", "Brian BHasinoff"], "doi": "10.1124/dmd.105.005546"}

However, the differential sensitivity of these tissues in experimental drug-induced long QT is relatively unknown. We investigated the electrophysiological characteristics of these tissue types in vitro together with their different responses to drugs that are known to induce prolongation of the QT interval in man.\nElectrophysiological parameters were measured in vitro using a micro-electrode technique. The isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers, papillary muscles or ventricular trabeculae were superperfused with Tyrode's solution and stimulated according to different stimulation protocols. The effects of dofetilide (1 x 10(-8) M), sertindole (1 x 10(-6) M), erythromycin (3 x 10(-4) M) and sparfloxacin (1 x 10(-4) M) were evaluated relative to solvent (n=8 to 12 for each group).\nIn isolated Purkinje fibers, action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90) at 1 Hz) was markedly prolonged by 55% (erythromycin), 103% (dofetilide), 118% (sertindole) and 88% (sparfloxacin) from baseline. The prolongation of APD(90) caused by these 4 compounds was associated with a 28% to 78% incidence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs) at 0.2 Hz only in the Purkinje fiber. In contrast, APD(90) was altered by erythromycin, dofetilide, sertindole and sparfloxacin only by +15%, +6%, -7% or +15%, respectively, in isolated papillary muscles, and by 33%, +28%, +4% or +16%, respectively, in ventricular trabeculae. EADs were not induced by these four compounds in papillary muscles or in trabeculae. Reducing the stimulation rate to 0.2 Hz resulted in a 33% prolongation of APD(90) in Purkinje fibers, while APD(90) was shortened by 10% in papillary muscles and by 20% in ventricular trabeculae.\nThe present study demonstrates that the differential sensitivity of tissue types play an important role in the detection of drug-induced long APD and EADs. Indeed the Purkinje fiber was the only tissue type to display the well known phenomenon associated with I(kr) channel blockade (inverse-use dependence), when the stimulation rate was decreased below 1 Hz. Rabbit Purkinje fibers constitute the most sensitive tissue type for detecting drug-induced long action potential duration and EADs.

Cardiac CT-1 secretion during ventricular stretch was studied in isolated, perfused hearts. Molecular forms of CT-1 were identified using RIA coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results are given as mean+/-SEM.\nPlasma levels of CT-1 in patients with untreated hypertension (UTH, 606+/-18 pmol/L, n=24) were significantly higher than those in age-and BMI-matched normotensive volunteers (NT, 546+/-12 pmol/L, n=31, P<0.01 vs. UTH). CT-1 levels in matched patients with treated hypertension (THT, 618+/-10 pmol/L, n=35) were similar to those in UTH patients, but higher than in NT controls (P<0.01). Plasma CT-1 demonstrated a weak but significant correlation with systolic blood pressure in all patients (r=0.241, P<0.05, n=90).

We found that the gene is expressed ubiquitously including vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, and is overexpressed in 11 tumor tissues on microarray. Stable transfection of VKOR cDNA into tumor cell line A549 and H7402 did not promote the cell proliferation. These results promoted us to hypothesize that VKOR may also be involved in angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis, the expression of VKOR was studied in different vascular cells in developmental and pathologic heart tissues. The effects of overexpression and suppressing expression of VKOR on endothelial cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and tubular network formation were explored. We found that VKOR expression in arteries was prominent in vascular endothelial cells and was high in the ventricular aneurysm tissue of human heart and human fetal heart. In vitro studies showed that overexpression of VKOR slightly but significantly stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation (by 120%), migration (by 118%), adhesion (by 117%), as well as tubular network formation. Antisense to VKOR gene inhibited the proliferation (by 67%), migration (by 64%), adhesion (by 50%), and tubular network formation.

{"title": "Reduction of myocardial scar size after implantation of mesenchymal stem cells in rats: what is the mechanism?", "abstract": "The use of a cellular therapy offers a promising approach for the treatment of heart disease. Besides other precursor cells, bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells were discovered that migrate into ischemic myocardium and participate in myogenesis as well as angiogenesis. A subpopulation of those are the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which may be potential candidates for repairing ischemic heart tissue. MSC are easy to prepare and can be used in an autologous strategy. Here we demonstrate the effect of transplanted MSC in our autologous rat model of myocardial injury. BM was isolated from tibiae and femurs of Wistar rats. After 24 h, the adhering MSC were separated, expanded, retrovirally transduced using green fluorescent protein (GFP), and cloned. A cryo-infarct was generated in the rat hearts, and immediately after this the cells were injected into the border zone of the lesion. After a 10-week follow up, the hearts were excised and the myocardial scar areas were measured using computer-guided morphometry. When comparing transplanted rats (n = 8) with control animals (n = 5) treated rats demonstrated a significant reduction in the width (p < 0.05) of the myocardial scar area. The depth of the scars of the cell therapy rats was less extended (p > 0.05) and the myocardium of these animals was thicker than in the controls (p > 0.05). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed neither evidence of MSC transdifferentiation into cardiomyocytes, nor could an increased neovascularization be found. In conclusion, MSC are responsible for a remarkable reduction of the myocardial scar size in the treated animals. But, whether this strategy is directly transferable to the patient suffering from heart disease has to be determined.

MURF-1 has been suggested to act as an ubiquitin ligase, thereby controlling proteasome-dependent degradation of muscle proteins. Here, we performed yeast two-hybrid (YTH) screens of skeletal muscle cDNA libraries with MURF-1 baits to identify potential myocellular targets of MURF-1-dependent ubiquitination. This identified eight myofibrillar proteins as binding partners of MURF-1: titin, nebulin, the nebulin-related protein NRAP, troponin-I (TnI), troponin-T (TnT), myosin light chain 2 (MLC-2), myotilin and T-cap. YTH mating studies with MURF-1,2,3 baits indicated that these eight myofibrillar proteins are all targeted redundantly by both MURF-1 and MURF-2. Western blot studies on cardiac tissues from wild-type and MURF-1-deficient mice suggested that titin and nebulin were ubiquitinated at similar levels, and MLC-2 and TnI at reduced levels in MURF-1 KO mice. Mapping of the TnI and titin binding sites on MURF-1 peptide scans demonstrated their binding to motifs highly conserved between MURF-1 and MURF-2. Our data are consistent with a model in which MURF-1 and MURF-2 together target a specific set of myofibrillar proteins redundantly, most likely to control their ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Finally, our YTH screens identified the interaction of MURF-1 with 11 enzymes required for ATP/energy production in muscle including the mitochondrial ATP synthase and cytoplasmic creatine kinase.

In order to find an independent evidence for this assumption, we analysed heart tissue during ischemia, measured the open state of gap junctions by means of dye transfer and correlated this parameter with the time course of the dielectric permittivity. The hearts were pre-ischemically arrested by perfusion with Ringer solution containing 20 mmol/L of potassium (group KCL, n=10). This solution was also used with the addition of two gap junction blockers, either 3 mmol/L heptanol (group HEP, n=4) or 20 micromol/L palmitoleic acid (group PA, n=7). During subsequent ischemia at 21.0+/-0.5 degrees C, we monitored the passive dielectric permittivity spectrum and the spread of dye. After a sigmoidal increase the dielectric permittivity reached an upper plateau at 61+/-22 min of ischemia in KCL, at 45+/-7 min in PA, and already during perfusion at 2+/-1 min in group HEP. At the beginning of ischemia, dye migrated to neighbouring cells in groups KCL and PA but not in HEP. In KCL and PA, the intercellular diffusion of dye stopped after 64+/-26 and 40+/-11 min of ischemia, respectively.

The majority of erp genes were detectably transcribed after more than 3 months of mammalian infection. Intriguingly, differences in expression levels were noted among the various erp loci.

{"title": "SRF-dependent gene expression in isolated cardiomyocytes: regulation of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor required for the regulation of genes important for cardiac structure and function. Notably, the \"fetal gene expression profile\" that is characteristic of cardiac hypertrophy consists of genes known to be regulated by SRF. Transgenic animal studies suggest that cardiac-specific overexpression of SRF induces this pattern of hypertrophic genes and subsequently causes the progression of pathologic adaptations. Furthermore, studies examining cardiac tissues from patients with severe heart failure indicate significant alterations in SRF expression that correspond with alterations in expression of SRF-dependent genes. Based on these observations, it has been postulated that SRF may be critical for stimulating pathologic gene expression at the onset of hypertrophic adaptation. To address the role of SRF in cardiac hypertrophy we investigated whether SRF is necessary and sufficient for the expression of genes associated with the hypertrophic response. We used isolated cardiomyocytes from both neonatal rats, and transgenic mice containing floxed SRF alleles, to examine cardiac gene expression in response to overexpression and absence of SRF. Using this approach, we demonstrate that SRF is required for the induction of atrial naturetic factor (ANF), c-fos, NCX1, BNP, alpha-actins, alpha-myosin heavy chain, and beta-myosin heavy chain genes. However, overexpression of exogenous SRF in isolated cardiomyocytes is only sufficient to induce NCX1 and alpha-myosin heavy chain. These results indicate that SRF is critical for the regulation and induction of genes associated with the progression of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy, however, the pattern of genes induced by overexpression of SRF in isolated cardiomyocytes is different from those genes expressed in hypertrophic transgenic hearts.

Their precise location was determined with high-resolution MRI and compared with histological tissue sections, stained with Prussian blue for iron content. These experiments showed that iron nanoparticle-loaded cells could be identified at high resolution in the mouse heart. However, ischemic myocardium (after cryoinjury or left coronary artery ligation) was characterized by a signal attenuation similar to that induced by USPIO-labeled cells in T2*-weighted MR images, making detection of labeled stem cells in this area by T2*-sensitive contrast rather difficult. In animals with myocardial injury only, the signal attenuated areas were of the same size in proton density- and T2*-weighted MR images. In injured animals also receiving labeled cells the lesioned area appeared larger in T2*--than in proton density-weighted MR images. This sequence-dependent lesion size change is due to the increased signal loss caused by the iron oxide nanoparticles, most sensitively detectable in the T2*-sensitive images.

Serological markers of collagen turnover were proven as a noninvasive reliable tool for monitoring from a distance cardiac tissue repair and fibrosis, both in experimental and clinical conditions. Some markers of collagen synthesis and degradation were shown to have a prognostic significance in myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, and were reported as independent predictors of mortality. Aldosterone represents the end-product of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and may play a role in cardiac collagen deposition independent of its effect on blood pressure. Production of aldosterone is mainly regulated by angiotensin II and is activated in the failing human ventricle in proportion to heart failure severity. Circulating or locally produced aldosterone stimulates fibrillar collagen accumulation in the heart directly via mineralocorticoid receptors or, indirectly, modifying angiotensine II receptors number and/or function. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists counters collagen deposition, even when used on top of classical RAAS inhibitors, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensine II receptor blockers. There is now accumulating evidence from experimental and clinical studies showing antifibrotic and cardioprotective effect for aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone. In chronic heart failure and post myocardial infarction patients, aldosterone receptor blockade benefit was associated with decreased serum levels of collagen synthesis marker PIIINP (procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide), without affecting collagen degradation. Understanding various autocrine/paracrine mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix remodeling in heart failure represents a major challenge, essential for developing new cardioreparative and cardioprotective strategies.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2005-06-11", "authors": ["FaiezZannad", "AncaRadauceanu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10741-005-2351-3"}

Two experiments were performed. In experiment I, the following four groups of male Wistar rats were used: control group and three groups that received thyroxine (T4) at 10, 50, or 75 microg x rat(-1) x day(-1). In experiment II, tempol was orally administered (18 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) to control and T4-treated (75 microg x rat(-1) x day(-1)) rats. All treatments were maintained for 6 wk. Body weight, tail systolic blood pressure (BP), and heart rate were measured one time a week, and direct BP and morphological, metabolic, plasma, and renal variables were measured at the end of the experiment. Enzymatic activities were measured in renal cortex and medulla and right and left ventricles. In renal cortex, SOD activity was decreased in the T4-75 group, and there was a dose-related increase in CAT activity and decrease in GPX and GR activities in T4-treated groups. Activity of all antioxidant enzymes was reduced in left ventricle in T4-50 and T4-75 groups and in right ventricle in the T4-75 group. Tempol reduced BP, plasma malondialdehyde, and total urinary excretion of F2 isoprostanes in hypertensive hyperthyroid rats but not in controls. Tempol did not improve cardiac hypertrophy, proteinuria, or creatinine clearance in hyperthyroid rats. In conclusion, the results obtained indicate that the activity of SOD, GPX, and GR in renal and cardiac tissues is decreased in hyperthyroidism and that antioxidant treatment with tempol ameliorates T4-induced hypertension.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

It was found to be similar to a type-I form (cN-I) identified earlier as the AMP-selective 5'-nucleotidase responsible for adenosine formation during ATP breakdown in transfected COS-7 cells. Expression pattern of the cN-I gene in pigeon tissues indicated breast muscle as a rich source of the transcript. We purified the enzyme from this source using two-step chromatography and obtained an active homogenous preparation, free of ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity.

The specific activity of the enzyme preparation was 4.33 U/mg protein and it preferred dCMP and AMP to dAMP and IMP as a substrate. Its kinetic properties were very similar to those of the enzyme purified earlier from heart tissue. It was strongly activated by ADP. Inhibition by inorganic phosphate was more pronounced than in heart-isolated cN-I.

Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) stimulated human phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) is expressed mainly in brain and heart tissues. PDE2A is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis by the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), making PDE2-type enzymes important targets for drug discovery. The design of more potent and selective inhibitors of PDE2A for the treatment of heart disease would be greatly aided by the identification of active site residues in PDE2A that determine substrate and inhibitor selectivity. The identification of active site residues through traditional mutational studies involves the time-consuming and tedious purification of a large number of mutant proteins from overexpressing cells. Here we report an alternative approach to rapidly produce active site mutants of human PDE2A and identify their enzymatic properties using a wheat germ in vitro translation (IVT, also known as cell-free translation) system. We also present the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human PDE2A determined at 1.7 A resolution, which provided a framework for the rational design of active site mutants.

Their effects during fibrillation, however, remain poorly understood. We used computer simulation of a two-dimensional (2-D) structurally normal tissue model with phase I of the Luo-Rudy action potential model to study the effects of Na(+) and K(+) channel blockade on vulnerability to and termination of reentry in simulated multiple-wavelet and mother rotor fibrillation. Our main findings are as follows: 1) Na(+) channel blockade decreased, whereas K(+) channel blockade increased, the vulnerable window of reentry in heterogeneous 2-D tissue because of opposing effects on dynamical wave instability. 2) Na(+) channel blockade increased the cycle length of reentry more than it increased refractoriness. In multiple-wavelet fibrillation, Na(+) channel blockade first increased and then decreased the average duration or transient time (<T(s)>) of fibrillation. In mother rotor fibrillation, Na(+) channel blockade caused peripheral fibrillatory conduction block to resolve and the mother rotor to drift, leading to self-termination or sustained tachycardia. 3) K(+) channel blockade increased dynamical instability by steepening action potential duration restitution. In multiple-wavelet fibrillation, this effect shortened <T(s)> because of enhanced wave instability. In mother rotor fibrillation, this effect converted mother rotor fibrillation to multiple-wavelet fibrillation, which then could self-terminate. Our findings help illuminate, from a theoretical perspective, the possible underlying mechanisms of termination of different types of fibrillation by antiarrhythmic drugs.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Recent studies have shown that ventricular myocardium is composed of at least 3 electrophysiological distinct cell types: epicardial, endocardial, and midcardial cells. Differences in the response of the 3 cell types to pharmacologic agents and/or pathophysiological states often result in amplification of intrinsic electrical heterogeneities, thus providing a substrate as well as a trigger for the development of arrhythmias. The study was designed to observe the right ventricular transmural heterogeneity in vitro canine heart tissue preparation level.\nThe strips were isolated from the anterior wall of the right ventricular of canine. The preparations perfused with oxygenated (95%O(2)/5%CO(2)) Tyrode's solution. The tissues were stimulated at basic cycle lengths of 1000 ms. Standard microelectrode techniques were used. Transmembrane action potentials were recorded from epicardial, midcardial and endocardial cells respectively from right ventricular free wall of canine on different conditions [perusing with Tyrode's solution (Control), pinacidil (2.5 micromol/L), and quinidine (5 micromol/L) in turn].\nCompared with that of endocardial cells, the action potentials of canine ventricular epicardial and midcardial cells had more obvious spike and dome morphology. Pinacidil (2.5 micromol/L) caused a loss of the dome of transmembrane action potentials and a marked abbreviation of the action potential duration (APD) in right ventricular epicardial and midcardial cells, especially in epicardial cells, but not in endocardial cells (n = 10). With pinacidil (2.5 micromol/L), in epicardial cells, phase 2 amplitude of action potentials decreased from (117.7 +/- 9.3) mV to (71.3 +/- 6.4) mV (P < 0.01), and 90% of the APD(90) decreased from (198.2 +/- 20.8) ms to (103.9 +/- 13.5) ms (P < 0.01). The transmural dispersion of action potential duration increased from (48.5 +/- 9.2) ms to (128.7 +/- 13.5) ms (P < 0.01). Quinidine (5 micromol/L) effectively prolonged the APD abbreviated by pinacidil, restored or partly restored the dome of transmembrane action potentials of epicardial and midcardial cells but not of endocardial cells (n = 10). In epicardial cells phase 2 amplitude increased from (71.3 +/- 6.4) mV to (106.6 +/- 7.7) mV (P < 0.01), and 90% of the APD(90) increased from (103.9 +/- 13.5) ms to (185.9 +/- 15.7) ms (P < 0.01). The transmural dispersion of action potential duration significantly decreased from (128.7 +/- 13.5) ms to (54.3 +/- 10.8) ms (P < 0.01). Quinidine reduced pinacidil-induced transmural dispersion of phase 2 amplitude and the APD in right ventricular wall of canine.\nBy restoring the dome and the APD of the epicardial and midcardial cells action potentials, quinidine (5 micromol/L) could reduce the marked transmural dispersion of repolarization caused by pinacidil.", "journal": "Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi", "date": "2005-06-04", "authors": ["JingLuo", "Xin-chunYang", "Le-fengWang", "PengZhou", "Cui-lanLi", "Ming-shengWang", "YingGao", "Li-zhongWang"], "doi": null}

The goal of the present study is to determine if a combination therapy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and insulin had any advantage over insulin therapy alone on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant activity in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat. The lipid peroxidation product, thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS), was measured to assess free radical activity in the heart, kidney and liver tissues. The enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured as indicators of antioxidation in these tissues.

This study examined the effect of chronic administration of RV on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity in cardiovascular tissues and on plasma lipid peroxidation in fructose-fed rats (FFR), an experimental model of this syndrome.\nMale Sprague Dawley rats were separated into four groups: Control, Control + RV, FFR, and FFR + RV (n = 8 in each group). The RV (10 mg/kg/d by gavage) and fructose (10% in drinking water) were administered for 45 days. Metabolic variables and systolic blood pressure (BP) were measured. The eNOS activity was estimated in the mesenteric arterial bed and cardiac tissue homogenates by conversion of (3)H-arginine to (3)H-citrulline. Lipid peroxidation was estimated through the measurement of plasmatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS).\nThe RV chronic treatment prevented the increase in systolic BP and cardiac hypertrophy, restored FFR mesenteric and cardiac eNOS activities, and decreased the elevated TBARS levels that characterize FFR, without an effect on other metabolic variables.\nIn concert with other effects, the increase in eNOS activity may contribute to the protective properties attributed to RV and, thus, to its beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system.

It also catalyzes the formation of cytotoxic lipid peroxide via lipid peroxidation and damages DNA through oxidative stress. Heme being a lipophilic molecule intercalates in the membrane and impairs lipid bilayers and organelles, such as mitochondria and nuclei, and destabilizes the cytoskeleton. Heme is a potent hemolytic agent and alters the conformation of cytoskeletal protein in red cells. Free heme causes endothelial cell injury, leading to vascular inflammatory disorders and stimulates the expression of intracellular adhesion molecules. Heme acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule and heme-induced inflammation is involved in the pathology of diverse conditions; such as renal failure, arteriosclerosis, and complications after artificial blood transfusion, peritoneal endometriosis, and heart transplant failure. Heme offers severe toxic effects to kidney, liver, central nervous system and cardiac tissue.

Glucose-mediated oxidation of LDL may result in increased oxidative stress and vascular endothelial cell dysfunction via interaction with a cell surface scavenger receptor, CD36. In this study, we investigated the role of CD36 in cultured microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) and in the heart by using an animal model of chronic diabetes.\nCultured MVECs were subjected to varying glucose concentrations and assayed for alteration in CD36 gene expression and protein levels. To assess for oxidised LDL (ox-LDL) uptake, MVECs exposed to low and high glucose were treated with ox-LDL (80 microg/ml), a ligand for CD36. Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) induction, as well as oxidative stress were determined.

{"title": "Novel cell lines derived from adult human ventricular cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Background. - We have established proliferating human cardiomyocyte cell lines derived from non-proliferating primary cultures of adult ventricular heart tissue, using a novel method that may be applicable to many post-mitotic primary cultures. Methods and results. - Primary cells from human ventricular tissue, were fused with SV40 transformed, uridine auxotroph human fibroblasts, devoid of mitochondrial DNA. This was followed by selection in uridine-free medium to eliminate unfused fibroblasts. The fused cells were subcloned and screened for cell type-specific markers. Four clones (AC1, AC10, AC12, AC16) that express markers characteristic of cardiomyocytes were studied. Clones were homogeneous morphologically, and expressed transcription factors (GATA4, MYCD, NFATc4), contractile proteins such as alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-cardiac actin, troponin I, desmoplakin, alpha actinin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, desmin, the cardiomyocyte-specific peptide hormones, BNP, the L-type calcium channel alpha1C subunit and gap junction proteins, connexin-43 and connexin-40. Furthermore, dye-coupling studies confirmed the presence of functional gap junctions. EM ultra structural analysis revealed the presence of myofibrils in the subsarcolemmal region, indicating a precontractile developmental stage. When grown in mitogen-depleted medium, the AC cells stopped proliferating and formed a multinucleated syncytium. When the SV40 oncogene was silenced using the RNAi technique, AC16 cells switched from a proliferating to a more differentiated quiescent state, with the formation of multinucleated syncyntium. Concurrently, the cells expressed BMP2, an important signaling molecule for induction of cardiac-specific markers, that was not expressed by the proliferating cells. The presence of the combination of transcription factors in addition to muscle-specific markers is a good indication for the presence of a cardiac transcription program in these cells. CONCLUSIONS. - Based on the expression of myogenic markers and a fully functional respiratory chain, the AC cells have retained the nuclear DNA and the mitochondrial DNA of the primary cardiomyocytes. They can be frozen and thawed repeatedly and can differentiate when grown in mitogen-free medium.

The aim of the present study was twofold; first we investigated whether the observed effects could be reproduced in in-vitro and in-vivo rat models. Second, we intended to investigate the underlying mechanism of the possible cardiotoxicity of CPEC. Effects on frequency and contractility were studied on the isolated atria of 18 male Wistar rats. Atria were incubated with 0.1 mmol L(-1) (n = 6) or 1 mmol L(-1) (n = 6) CPEC for 1.5 h and compared with control atria (incubation with buffer solution, n = 6). The cardiac apoptosis-inducing potential was studied in-vivo on 66 rats by 99mTc-Annexin V scintigraphy, followed by postmortem determination of radioactivity in tissues, histological confirmation with the TUNEL assay (late-phase apoptosis), and immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase 3 and cytochrome C (early-phase apoptosis). Serum levels of the necrotic cardiomyopathy marker troponin T were also determined. No effect on heart frequency was found in the isolated atria after CPEC treatment. A trend towards a decrease of contraction force was observed. However, the differences were not statistically significant. 99mTc-Annexin V scintigraphy showed no increase in cardiac uptake ratio upon CPEC treatment in the in-vivo rat model, which was confirmed by determination of radioactivity in heart versus blood ratios. At each section a few individual isolated late apoptotic cells (< 5) could be identified by the TUNEL assay in the highest CPEC dose group (90 mg kg(-1)) but not in controls or in rats treated with 60 mg kg(-1) CPEC. Staining for the early apoptosis markers cleaved caspase 3 and cytochrome C did not reveal any significant differences between treated and control rats. Cardiac troponin T levels were not increased after CPEC treatment. CPEC does not affect heart frequency or contraction force in our cardiotoxicity models.

The use of a murine allograft model in tandem with cDNA arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) can greatly help in identifying key genes implicated in human heart acute rejection.\nHearts from Balb/c mice were either not transplanted or transplanted heterotopically in the abdomen of Balb/c (isografts) and C57BL/6 (allografts) mice. Histological analysis showed acute rejection only in allografts. Total RNA was extracted from isografts (n=3), allografts (n=4), and not transplanted hearts (n=4); reverse transcribed; and labeled with P32. Each probe was hybridized to cDNA macroarrays. Eight genes were overexpressed and 7 genes were underexpressed in allografts compared with isografts.

As the only known human homolog of ACE, the demonstration that ACE2 is insensitive to blockade by ACE inhibitors prompted us to define the effect of ACE inhibition on the ACE2 gene.\nBlood pressure, cardiac rate, and plasma and cardiac tissue levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7), together with cardiac ACE2, neprilysin, Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1), and mas receptor mRNAs, were measured in Lewis rats 12 days after continuous administration of vehicle, lisinopril, losartan, or both drugs combined in their drinking water. Equivalent decreases in blood pressure were obtained in rats given lisinopril or losartan alone or in combination. ACE inhibitor therapy caused a 1.8-fold increase in plasma Ang-(1-7), decreased plasma Ang II, and increased cardiac ACE2 mRNA but not cardiac ACE2 activity. Losartan increased plasma levels of both Ang II and Ang-(1-7), as well as cardiac ACE2 mRNA and cardiac ACE2 activity. Combination therapy duplicated the effects found in rats medicated with lisinopril, except that cardiac ACE2 mRNA fell to values found in vehicle-treated rats. Losartan treatment but not lisinopril increased cardiac tissue levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7), whereas none of the treatments had an effect on cardiac neprilysin mRNA.\nSelective blockade of either Ang II synthesis or activity induced increases in cardiac ACE2 gene expression and cardiac ACE2 activity, whereas the combination of losartan and lisinopril was associated with elevated cardiac ACE2 activity but not cardiac ACE2 mRNA. Although the predominant effect of ACE inhibition may result from the combined effect of reduced Ang II formation and Ang-(1-7) metabolism, the antihypertensive action of AT1 antagonists may in part be due to increased Ang II metabolism by ACE2.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2005-05-18", "authors": ["Carlos MFerrario", "JewellJessup", "Mark CChappell", "David BAverill", "K BridgetBrosnihan", "E AnnTallant", "Debra IDiz", "Patricia EGallagher"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.510461"}
{"title": "Quantification of G protein Gaalphas subunit splice variants in different human tissues and cells using pyrosequencing.", "abstract": "The G protein Galphas is derived from four alternatively spliced transcripts, two long variants (Galphas(L)+CAG and Galphas(L)-CAG), which include an extra 45-bp segment, and two short variants (Galphas(S)+CAG and Galphas(S)-CAG). The long and short forms differ in each case by splicing in or out of a serine residue encoded at the 3' end of the variable exon 3. The relative expression of all four variants in human tissues is poorly investigated due to experimental limitations. We therefore established a method for reliable relative mRNA quantification of these splice variants based on the Pyrosequencing technology, and determined Galphas transcript ratios in various human tissues and cells. Galphas(S)/Galphas ratio was highest in blood mononuclear cells (0.84 +/- 0.02, n = 16) and lowest in the brain (0.51 +/- 0.14, n = 3). The different ranges resulted from differences in Galphas(S)+CAG ratios, which ranged from a total Galphas ratio of 0.32 +/- 0.07 (n = 12) in heart tissue to 0.57 +/- 0.03 (n = 16) in blood mononuclear cells (p < 0.0001), whereas the Galphas(S)-CAG ratio was rather constant and ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.04 (n = 7) in retinoblastoma cells to 0.27 +/- 0.04 in lymphocytes (p = 0.19).

Stimulation of immortalized B lymphoblasts with isoproterenol resulted in significant changes of splice variant ratios. Our data indicate that changes of long and short ratios of Galphas in different tissues affected Galphas(L)-CAG and Gas(S)+CAG rather than Galphas(L)+CAG and Galphas(S-)CAG.

In sharp contrast to initial publications on SOD2(+/-) mice, the herein reported mice on a mixed genetic background (C57BL/6 x 129/Ola) in their heterozygous state (SOD(+/-)) revealed distinct ultrastructural damage of the myocard, with swelling and disruption of mitochondria and accumulation of lipid droplets, increased nitrotyrosine formation, and lipid peroxidation as well as activation of apoptosis signaling pathways in the heart in vivo.

Implantation into heart tissues of autologous skeletal myoblasts has been associated with improved contractile function in animal models and in humans with acute myocardial ischemia. Since heart infarction is most prevalent in individuals of over 40 years of age, we tested whether culture methods available in our laboratory were adequate to obtain sufficient numbers of differentiated skeletal myoblasts from muscle biopsy specimens obtained from patients aged 41 to 91. METHODS AND RESULTS: No matter of donor age, differentiated skeletal muscle cells could be produced in vitro in amounts adequate for cellular therapy (>/=300 millions). Using desmin as a cytoplasmic marker, about 50% cultured cells were differentiated along myogenic lineages and expressed proteins proper of skeletal muscle (myosin type I and II, actin, actinin, spectrin and dystrophin). Cytogenetic alterations were not detected in cultured muscle cells that had undergone at least 10 population doublings.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Traditional cardiac risk factors, as well as other factors specific to the ESRD population such as hyperphosphatemia, elevated calcium and phosphate product, abnormal lipid metabolism, hyperhomocysteinemia, and chronic inflammation play a role in the excessive risk of cardiovascular death in this population. Left ventricular disorders are proven risk factors for cardiac mortality in hemodialysis patients. These disorders are present in incident ESRD patients at rates far above the general population. There is an accumulating body of evidence that suggests that vitamin D plays a role in cardiovascular disease. Abnormal vitamin metabolism, through deficiency of the active form of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), and acquired vitamin D resistance through the uremic state, have been shown to be important in ESRD. Vitamin D deficiency has long been known to affect cardiac contractility, vascular tone, cardiac collagen content, and cardiac tissue maturation. Recent studies using vitamin D receptor deficient mice as a model demonstrate a crucial role of vitamin D in regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. Additionally, there is emerging evidence linking treatment with vitamin D to improved survival on hemodialysis and improvement in cardiac function.

{"title": "Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 expression in the developing heart.", "abstract": "Murine arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is expressed in the developing heart and in the neural tube at the time of closure. Classically described as a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, there is increasing evidence for a distinct biological role for murine NAT2. We have characterized the expression of arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 during cardiogenesis, mapping its expression in vivo, using a lacZ insertion deletion, and also in vitro, by measuring NAT2 enzyme activity. These findings show that cardiac Nat2 expression is both temporally and spatially regulated during development. In neonatal mice, cardiac Nat2 expression is most extensive in the central fibrous body and is evident in the atrioventricular valves and the valves of the great vessels. Whereas Nat2 expression is not detected in ventricular myocardial cells, Nat2 is strongly expressed in scattered cells in the region of the sinus node, the epicardium of the right atrial appendage, and in the pulmonary artery. Expression of active NAT2 protein is maximal when the developing heart attains the adult circulation pattern and moves from metabolizing glucose to fatty acids. NAT2 acetylating activity in cardiac tissue from Nat2(-/-) and Nat2(+/-) mice indicates a lack of compensating acetylating activity either from other acetylating enzymes or by NAT2 encoded by the wild-type Nat2 allele in Nat2(+/-) heterozygotes. The temporal and spatial control of murine Nat2 expression points to an endogenous role distinct from xenobiotic metabolism and indicates that Nat2 expression may be useful as a marker in cardiac development.", "journal": "The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society", "date": "2005-05-06", "authors": ["LarissaWakefield", "ValerieCornish", "FionaBroackes-Carter", "EdithSim"], "doi": "10.1369/jhc.4A6496.2005"}
{"title": "Regional differences of superoxide dismutase activity enhance the superoxide-induced electrical heterogeneity in rabbit hearts.", "abstract": "During myocardial ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion, free radicals are important intermediates of the cellular damage and rhythm disturbances. We examined the effects of superoxide radicals or hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on the action potentials in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers, atrial muscle and ventricular muscle. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) donors such as adriamycin, xanthine/xanthine oxidase and menadione induced prolongation of APD(90) in Purkinje fibers. Menadione (30 microM), the most specific superoxide radical donor, prolonged the action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) by 17% in Purkinje fibers, whereas it shortened the APD by 57% in ventricular muscle, and it did not affect the atrial APD. All these menadione-induced effects were completely blocked by 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl- 1-peperadinyloxy, a superoxide radical scavenger. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was lowest in Purkinje fibers, it was moderate in atrial muscle and highest in ventricular muscle. H(2)O(2) shortened the APDs of all three cardiac tissues in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that the different electrical responses to O(2) ([Symbol: see text]-) in different cardiac regions may result from the regional differences in the SOD activity, thereby enhancing the regional electrical heterogeneity.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2005-05-05", "authors": ["B HChoi", "K-ChHa", "J-APark", "Y-JJung", "J-ChKim", "G-ILee", "H-SChoi", "Y-JKang", "S-WChae", "Y-GKwak"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-005-0531-x"}
{"title": "Optical measurements reveal nature of intercellular coupling across ventricular wall.", "abstract": "Previously, we showed that intercellular uncoupling through gap junctions is an important mechanism for maintaining transmural heterogeneities of repolarization that are responsible for ventricular arrhythmias in disease states such as heart failure. However, rotational anisotropy between transmural muscle layers also may influence coupling. To determine the effect of rotational anisotropy on transmural coupling, we developed a numerical three-dimensional model of passive cardiac tissue in which rotational anisotropy was varied in a controlled fashion. Simulations of optical mapping demonstrated that spatial averaging produced a voltage decay in space best fit by a single decaying exponential compared with the theoretically predicted decay. As fiber orientation varied by 90 degrees with respect to the transmural surface, the effective transmural space constant (lambda(TM)) changed by only 0.31% in simulations. In contrast, reducing intercellular conductivity by 24% decreased lambda(TM) by 7.7%. In the canine wedge preparation (n = 5), lambda measured by optical mapping of the epicardial and subepicardial surface was similar transverse (lambda(TV) = 0.73 +/- 0.10 mm) and transmural (lambda(TM) = 0.70 +/- 0.08 mm) to subepicardial fibers. We confirmed previous findings that lambda(TM) in subepicardial layers was significantly reduced by 14 +/- 2% compared with deeper layers of myocardium, providing evidence for transmural uncoupling in the epicardial-midmyocardial interface. These data establish the theoretical and experimental basis for measuring intercellular coupling between muscle layers spanning the ventricular wall with optical mapping techniques. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that transmural uncoupling at the epicardial-midmyocardial interface may be attributable to heterogeneous expression of cardiac gap junctions and not rotational anisotropy.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Germline mutations in the human transcription factor genes have been associated with congenital heart disease (CHD), but familial cases studied so far have different mutations. There is no strict genotype-phenotype correlation and mutations in transcription factor genes are rare in unrelated patients. Most cases of CHD come from unaffected family members. The study of archived, but morphologically well-characterized malformed hearts for DNA alterations provides important clues regarding cardiogenic transcription factor genes that would lead to loss-of-function of the protein.

PC2 is an integral transmembrane protein and acts as a calcium-permeable cation channel. The functional modulation of this channel by other protein partners remains largely unknown. In the present study, using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we discovered that both intracellular N- and C-termini of PC2 associate with alpha-actinins, actin-binding and actin-bundling proteins important in cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, proliferation and migration. The PC2-alpha-actinin association was confirmed by in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down and dot blot overlay assays. In addition, the in vivo interaction between endogenous PC2 and alpha-actinins was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation in human embryonic kidney 293 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, rat kidney and heart tissues and human syncytiotrophoblast (hST) apical membrane vesicles. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that PC2 and alpha-actinin were partially co-localized in epithelial MDCK and inner medullary collecting duct cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and hST vesicles. We studied the functional modulation of PC2 by alpha-actinin in a lipid bilayer electrophysiology system using in vitro translated PC2 and found that alpha-actinin substantially stimulated the channel activity of reconstituted PC2. A similar stimulatory effect of alpha-actinin on PC2 was also observed when hST vesicles were reconstituted in lipid bilayer.

Late-stage TO-2 cardiomyopathic hamsters showed severe cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis, accompanied by increases in myocardial expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), a growth factor responsible for tissue fibrosis. Conversely, HGF was downregulated in late-stage myopathic hearts. Treatment with recombinant human HGF for 3 wk suppressed cardiac fibrosis, accompanied by a decreased expression of TGF-beta1 and type I collagen. Suppression of TGF-beta1 and type I collagen by HGF was also shown in cultured cardiac myofibroblasts. Likewise, HGF suppressed myocardial hypertrophy, apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and expression of atrial natriuretic polypeptide, a molecular marker of hypertrophy. Importantly, downregulation of the fibrogenic and hypertrophic genes by HGF treatment was associated with improved cardiac function. Thus the decrease in endogenous HGF levels may participate in the susceptibility of cardiac tissue to hypertrophy and fibrosis, and exogenous HGF led to therapeutic benefits in case of dilated cardiomyopathy in this model, even at the late-stage treatment.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Hyperhomocysteinemic diabetic cardiomyopathy: oxidative stress, remodeling, and endothelial-myocyte uncoupling.", "abstract": "Accumulation of oxidized-matrix (fibrosis) between the endothelium (the endothelial cells embedded among the myocytes) and cardiomyocytes is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus and causes diastolic impairment. In diabetes mellitus, elevated levels of homocysteine activate matrix metalloproteinase and disconnect the endothelium from myocytes. Extracellular matrix functionally links the endothelium to the cardiomyocyte and is important for their synchronization. However, in diabetes mellitus, a disconnection is caused by activated metalloproteinase, with subsequent accumulation of oxidized matrix between the endothelium and myocyte. This contributes to endothelial-myocyte uncoupling and leads to impaired diastolic relaxation of the heart in diabetes mellitus. Elevated levels of homocysteine in diabetes are attributed to impaired homocysteine metabolism by glucose and insulin and decreased renal clearance. Homocysteine induces oxidative stress and is inversely related to the expression of peroxisome proliferators activated receptor (PPAR). Several lines of evidence suggest that ablation of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) gene ameliorates the endothelial-myocyte uncoupling in diabetes mellitus. Homocysteine competes for, and decreases the PPARgammaactivity. In diabetes mellitus, endothelial-myocyte uncoupling is associated with matrix metalloproteinase activation and decreased PPARgamma activity. The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of endothelial-myocyte uncoupling in diabetes mellitus and increased levels of homocysteine, causing activation of latent metalloproteinases, decreased levels of thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin, and cardiac tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (CIMP) in response to antagonizing PPARgamma.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics", "date": "2005-04-12", "authors": ["Suresh CTyagi", "WalterRodriguez", "Anuj MPatel", "Andrew MRoberts", "Jeff CFalcone", "John CPassmore", "John TFleming", "Irving GJoshua"], "doi": "10.1177/107424840501000101"}

Arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), WBC, platelets, plasma nitrite/nitrate, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and biochemical factors were measured for 24 hours after LPS with or without iNOS inhibitors. RT-PCR was employed to determine the iNOS and endothelial NOS (eNOS) mRNA. Pathologic examinations of the liver and heart were performed. SMT and L-Nil improved the systemic hypotension and increased the HR after LPS. These agents attenuated the LPS-induced leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia and the increase in nitrite/nitrate. However, iNOS inhibition aggravated the LPS-induced changes in TNF alpha, all biochemical factors, and the hepatic and cardiac tissue damage. The iNOS mRNA, but not the eNOS, was reduced. Our results in conscious rats indicate that iNOS inhibition enhances the organ dysfunction and tissue damage in sepsis. The discrepancy may be attributed to the method for evaluating the sepsis and the effects of anesthesia. Further investigation is required to ensure the effects of iNOS inhibition on sepsis before iNOS inhibitors can be applied in clinical cases with sepsis.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2005-04-12", "authors": ["Chia-ChiLee", "Nien-TsengLin", "Yung HsingHsu", "Hsing IChen"], "doi": "10.1097/01.fjc.0000157438.72483.ae"}

Insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in vivo in several tissues was estimated using the 2-deoxy-D-[1-(3)H]glucose ([(3)H]2DG) uptake determination method. A tracer dose of [(3)H]2DG was injected intravenously into 8-day-old chicks (Gallus gallus) administered simultaneously or previously with porcine insulin (40 microg/kg BW). After 10 or 20 min, several major tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, were sampled and their 2-deoxy-D-[1-(3)H]glucose 6-phosphate content analyzed. Plasma glucose concentration and [(3)H]2DG radioactivity were lowered by insulin within 20 min of [(3)H]2DG administration, while the plasma [(3)H]2DG/glucose ratio was not significantly different between chicks injected with insulin and their control counterparts. A marked uptake of 2DG was observed in cardiac tissue and brain, followed by kidney and skeletal muscles. In skeletal muscles, insulin increased the 2DG uptake in soleus, extensor digitorum longus and pectoralis superficialis muscles. On the other hand, no significant increases in insulin-induced 2DG uptake were detected in cardiac muscle or adipose tissue compared to controls. The results show that glucose transport across the plasma membrane in vivo in most skeletal muscles tested, but not cardiac muscle, was increased by insulin administration to chicks. These findings suggest that an insulin-responsive glucose transport mechanism is present in chickens, even though they intrinsically lack GLUT4 homologous gene, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter in mammals.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Electrospinning was used to fabricate biodegradable non-woven poly(lactide)- and poly(glycolide)-based (PLGA) scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering applications. Post-processing was applied to achieve macro-scale fiber orientation (anisotropy). In vitro studies confirmed a dose-response effect of the poly(glycolide) concentration on the degradation rate and the pH value changes. Different formulations were examined to assess scaffold effects on cell attachment, structure and function. Primary cardiomyocytes (CMs) were cultured on the electrospun scaffolds to form tissue-like constructs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the fine fiber architecture of the non-woven matrix allowed the cardiomyocytes to make extensive use of provided external cues for isotropic or anisotropic growth, and to some extent to crawl inside and pull on fibers. Structural analysis by confocal microscopy indicated that cardiomyocytes had a preference for relatively hydrophobic surfaces. CMs on electrospun poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) scaffolds developed mature contractile machinery (sarcomeres). Functionality (excitability) of the engineered constructs was confirmed by optical imaging of electrical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. We conclude that engineered cardiac tissue structure and function can be modulated by the chemistry and geometry of the provided nano- and micro-textured surfaces.

{"title": "Taurine treatment protects against chronic nicotine-induced oxidative changes.", "abstract": "Experiments have shown that chronic nicotine administration caused oxidative damage in various organs by increasing lipid peroxidation products and decreasing the activity of endogenous antioxidants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of taurine treatment on nicotine-induced oxidative changes in rat thoracic aorta and heart and to explore the possible mechanisms of action. Male Wistar albino rats (200-250 g) were injected with nicotine hydrogen bitartrate (0.6 mg/kg; i.p.) or saline for 21 days. Taurine was administered (50 mg/kg; i.p.) alone or along with nicotine injections. After decapitation, the thoracic aorta and heart tissues were excised. The aorta was used for in vitro contractility studies or stored along with the heart samples for the measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and collagen content. Tissue samples were also examined histologically. Serum samples were stored for the measurement of MDA, GSH and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Chronic nicotine treatment impaired both the contraction and relaxation responses of the aortic rings to phenylephrine and acetylcholine, respectively. It increased lipid peroxidation, MPO levels and tissue collagen content of both aorta and heart samples. Taurine supplementation to nicotine-treated animals reversed the contractile dysfunction and restored the endogenous GSH levels and decreased high lipid peroxidation and MPO activities in both tissues.

Previously, it was reported that these two forms of amyloid have different molecular features and it was thus postulated that the mechanism responsible for TTR fibrillogenesis in SSA and FAP may differ. To document further the nature of the amyloid in these entities, detailed morphological, histochemical, immunological, and structural analyses of specimens obtained from 14 individuals with SSA and 11 Swedish FAP patients have been performed. Two distinct patterns of amyloid deposition (designated A and B) were evident. In pattern A, found in all SSA and five of 11 FAP cases, the amyloid had a homogeneous but patchy distribution within the sub-endocardium, sub-epicardium, and myocardium; exhibited weak congophilia and green birefringence; and was composed of tightly packed, short, unorientated fibrils. This material contained mainly approximately 79-residue C-terminal fragments of the amyloidogenic precursor protein. In pattern B, seen in the six other FAP patients, the amyloid appeared as thin streaks throughout the cardiac tissue; often surrounded individual muscle cells; was strongly congophilic and birefringent; had long fibrils arranged in parallel bundles, often penetrating into myocytes; and was composed of virtually intact TTR molecules.

We determined whether nitric oxide (.NO) is responsible for increased cardioprotection in BN/Mcw vs. SS/Mcw hearts. Hearts from the two strains were treated with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMA) or S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) before ischemia and reperfusion. Infarct size in untreated BN/Mcw hearts was approximately 63% less than in SS/Mcw hearts. Inhibiting NOS with L-NMA increased infarct size in BN/Mcw hearts to that observed in untreated SS/Mcw hearts but did not further increase injury in SS/Mcw hearts. The .NO donor GSNO decreased infarct size in SS/Mcw rats but had no effect on BN/Mcw hearts. Plasma and heart tissue from BN/Mcw rats contained 80% and 130% more nitrite + nitrate than that from SS/Mcw rats. These data suggest that increased .NO production protects BN/Mcw hearts from ischemic injury. Real time PCR showed no differences in NOS1, NOS2 or NOS3 isozyme transcripts in the hearts from the two strains. NOS3 was the only isozyme detected by western analysis. Both strains exhibited the same level of NOS3 and hsp90 protein expression. However, hsp90 association with NOS3 in BN/Mcw hearts was increased twofold compared with SS/Mcw hearts. Inhibiting hsp90-NOS3 interaction with geldanamycin decreased the resistance to ischemia in BN/Mcw hearts but not in SS/Mcw hearts. SS/Mcw hearts also generated three times more N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine-methylester inhibitable superoxide than BN/Mcw hearts.

{"title": "Role of p38alpha MAPK in cardiac apoptosis and remodeling after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Acute coronary occlusion results in ischemia-mediated death of cardiomyocytes. In the days and weeks following myocardial infarction (MI), left ventricular remodeling occurs that is characterized by persistent cardiomyocyte apoptosis, thinning and fibrosis at the site of infarction, ventricular chamber dilatation, and growth of remaining viable cardiomyocytes. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade has been implicated in the remodeling process. In this work, mice with cardiac-specific expression of a dominant negative mutant form of p38 MAPK (DN-p38alpha) were subjected to MI by occlusion of the left coronary artery. Acute ischemia area was determined by transthoracic echocardiography 2 h after MI surgery, and was found to be nearly identical in DN-p38 mice and their wild-type littermates. Seven days after MI, mice were subjected to repeat echocardiography and histological examination of infarct size. DN-p38 mice had markedly reduced infarct size and increased ventricular systolic function 7 days after MI when compared to wild-type littermates. In addition, DN-p38 mice had less cardiomyocyte apoptosis than wild-type mice in the infarct border zone. Recently, it was discovered that Bcl-X(L) deamidation occurs in vivo, and this results in Bcl-X(L) degradation that sensitizes cells to apoptosis by enhancing BAX activity. Bcl-X(L) deamidation was found to occur in the cardiac tissue of wild-type mice after MI, but was reduced in DN-p38 mice. These results establish that p38 MAPK activity is required for pathological remodeling after MI and suggest that p38 MAPK may promote cardiomyocyte apoptosis through Bcl-X(L) deamidation.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2005-04-06", "authors": ["JieRen", "ShaosongZhang", "AttilaKovacs", "YibinWang", "Anthony JMuslin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.01.012"}

The human AdSSL1 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue consistent with the potential role for the enzyme in muscle metabolism. Overexpressed AdSSL1 protein in COS-7 cells locates in cytoplasm. Recombinant AdSSL1 protein possesses typical enzymatic activity to catalyze adenylosuccinate formation. The identification of human AdSSL1 with predominant expression in muscle tissue will facilitate future genetic and biochemical analysis of the enzyme in muscle physiology.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2005-03-25", "authors": ["HongyingSun", "NanLi", "XiaojianWang", "TaoyongChen", "LiyunShi", "LihuangZhang", "JianliWang", "TaoWan", "XuetaoCao"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-005-2539-9"}
{"title": "Beneficial effects of selenium on some enzymes of diabetic rat heart.", "abstract": "It is known that selenium compounds can restore some metabolic parameters in experimental diabetes. However, as there are no clear data about their effects on the altered antioxidant defense system of the diabetic heart, we aimed to investigate whether these beneficial effects extend to the alterations of some enzyme activities, which play important roles in antioxidant defense system. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight) and rats were then treated with sodium selenite (5 micromol/kg/d) for 4 wk. Sodium selenite treatment of the diabetic rats significantly restored the altered activities of glutathione-S-transferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, which are involved in the glutathione metabolism of the heart, but slightly but significantly decreased the high blood glucose level. In summary, the present study suggests that the beneficial effects of sodium selenite treatment appears to be the result of the restoration altered activities of the antioxidant enzymes in diabetic heart tissue.", "journal": "Biological trace element research", "date": "2005-03-24", "authors": ["Nuriye NurayUlusu", "BelmaTuran"], "doi": "10.1385/BTER:103:3:207"}
{"title": "The role of stem cells in cardiac regeneration.", "abstract": "After myocardial infarction, injured cardiomyocytes are replaced by fibrotic tissue promoting the development of heart failure. Cell transplantation has emerged as a potential therapy and stem cells may be an important and powerful cellular source. Embryonic stem cells can differentiate into true cardiomyocytes, making them in principle an unlimited source of transplantable cells for cardiac repair, although immunological and ethical constraints exist. Somatic stem cells are an attractive option to explore for transplantation as they are autologous, but their differentiation potential is more restricted than embryonic stem cells. Currently, the major sources of somatic cells used for basic research and in clinical trials originate from the bone marrow. The differentiation capacity of different populations of bone marrow-derived stem cells into cardiomyocytes has been studied intensively. The results are rather confusing and difficult to compare, since different isolation and identification methods have been used to determine the cell population studied. To date, only mesenchymal stem cells seem to form cardiomyocytes, and only a small percentage of this population will do so in vitro or in vivo. A newly identified cell population isolated from cardiac tissue, called cardiac progenitor cells, holds great potential for cardiac regeneration. Here we discuss the potential of the different cell populations and their usefulness in stem cell based therapy to repair the damaged heart.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2005-03-24", "authors": ["Anke MSmits", "Patrickvan Vliet", "Rutger JHassink", "Marie-Jos\u00e9Goumans", "Pieter ADoevendans"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2005.tb00334.x"}

This study is based on the notion that PP2A action is governed by interactions of the core enzyme with B targeting/regulatory subunits. The subcellular localizations of two B subunits, B56alpha and B56gamma1, were assessed using adenovirus-driven expression of epitope-tagged (hemagglutinin, HA) in cultured neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes. Confocal imaging revealed that HA-B56alpha was excluded from the nucleus and decorated striated structures, whereas HA-B56gamma1 was principally found in the nucleus. Precise immunolabeling studies showed that B56gamma1 was concentrated in intranuclear structures known as nuclear speckles, macromolecular structures that accumulate transcription and splicing factors. Western blot analyses revealed that overexpression of either B subunit had no effect on the levels of other PP2A subunits in cultured neonatal cardiac cells. However, overexpression of only B56gamma1 increased whole cell PP2A activity by 40% when measured in cell extracts. Finally, B56gamma1 did not alter global gene expression or expression of hypertrophic gene markers such as alpha-skeletal actin. However, morphometric analyses of confocal images revealed that B56gamma1 alters the dynamic assembly/disassembly process of nuclear speckles in heart cells.

Our rat model of IUGR supports this contention and provides evidence for the programming of susceptibility for hypertension in all offspring. Moreover, in the female offspring only, gross anatomical changes (cardiac ventricle to body ratios) and increased left cardiac ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA levels provide evidence for programming of cardiac disease in this gender. The aim of the current study was to measure changes in cardiac tissue that support remodelling that could be implicated in the initiation of hypertrophy. Adult female rats from our IUGR model and age- and sex-matched controls were killed at 12 weeks of age. Left cardiac ventricles were removed and used for monitoring changes in several key genes, Na+,K+-ATPase beta1 protein expression, cardiomyocyte morphology and contractility as well as citrate synthase and aconitase activities. When compared to controls, female offspring of our IUGR rat model exhibit higher expression (mRNA) of ANP and the atrial isoform of the myosin light chain, lower levels of Na+,K+-ATPase beta1 protein, increased cardiomyocyte depth and volume, increased sarcomere length, diminished cardiomyocyte contractility and lower aconitase activity.

{"title": "Cited2 is required both for heart morphogenesis and establishment of the left-right axis in mouse development.", "abstract": "Establishment of the left-right axis is a fundamental process of vertebrate embryogenesis. Failure to develop left-right asymmetry leads to incorrect positioning and morphogenesis of numerous internal organs, and is proposed to underlie the etiology of several common cardiac malformations. The transcriptional modulator Cited2 is essential for embryonic development: Cited2-null embryos die during gestation with profound developmental abnormalities, including cardiac malformations, exencephaly and adrenal agenesis. Cited2 is also required for normal establishment of the left-right axis; we demonstrate that abnormal heart looping and right atrial and pulmonary isomerism are consistent features of the left-right-patterning defect. We show by gene expression analysis that Cited2 acts upstream of Nodal, Lefty2 and Pitx2 in the lateral mesoderm, and of Lefty1 in the presumptive floor plate. Although abnormal left-right patterning has a major impact on the cardiac phenotype in Cited2-null embryos, laterality defects are only observed in a proportion of these embryos. We have therefore used a combination of high-resolution imaging and three-dimensional (3D) modeling to systematically document the full spectrum of Cited2-associated cardiac defects. Previous studies have focused on the role of Cited2 in cardiac neural crest cell development, as Cited2 can bind the transcription factor Tfap2, and thus affect the expression of Erbb3 in neural crest cells. However, we have identified Cited2-associated cardiac defects that cannot be explained by laterality or neural crest abnormalities. In particular, muscular ventricular septal defects and reduced cell density in the atrioventricular (AV) endocardial cushions are evident in Cited2-null embryos. As we found that Cited2 expression tightly correlated with these sites, we believe that Cited2 plays a direct role in development of the AV canal and cardiac septa. We therefore propose that, in addition to the previously described reduction of cardiac neural crest cells, two other distinct mechanisms contribute to the spectrum of complex cardiac defects in Cited2-null mice; disruption of normal left-right patterning and direct loss of Cited2 expression in cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2005-03-08", "authors": ["Wolfgang JWeninger", "KylieLopes Floro", "Michael BBennett", "Sarah LWithington", "Jost IPreis", "Juan Pedro MartinezBarbera", "Timothy JMohun", "Sally LDunwoodie"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.01696"}

In our study, 18-mo-old C57Bl/6 female mice were treated twice with TCR Vbeta8.1 peptide and 10 d before sacrifice were injected ip with coxsackievirus B3. Cardiac histopathology was assessed for lesion severity. Splenocyte cyto-kine production (interleukin-2, -4, -6, interferon-gamma) and heart viral titers were determined.

We used rat ventricular (RV), bovine left ventricular (BLV), and bovine left atrial (BLA) muscles (passive force: RV > BLV > BLA, with the ratio of N2B to N2BA titin, approximately 90:10, approximately 40:60, and approximately 10:90%, respectively) and found that N2B and N2BA isoforms can both be phosphorylated by PKA. Under the relaxed condition, sarcomere length was increased and then held constant for 30 min and the peak passive force, stress-relaxation, and steady-state passive force were determined. Following PKA treatment, passive force was significantly decreased in all muscle types with the effect greatest in RV, lowest in BLA, and intermediate in BLV. Fitting the stress-relaxation data to the sum of three exponential decay functions revealed that PKA blunts the magnitude of stress-relaxation and accelerates its time constants. To investigate whether or not PKA-induced decreases in passive force result from possible alteration of titin-thin filament interaction (e.g., via troponin I phosphorylation), we conducted the same experiments using RV preparations that had been treated with gelsolin to extract thin filaments. PKA decreased passive force in gelsolin-treated RV preparations with a magnitude similar to that observed in control preparations. PKA was also found to decrease restoring force in skinned ventricular myocytes of the rat that had been shortened to below the slack length. Finally, we investigated the effect of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoprenaline on diastolic force in intact rat ventricular trabeculae. We found that isoprenaline phosphorylated titin and that it reduced diastolic force to a degree similar to that found in skinned RV preparations. Taken together, these results suggest that during beta-adrenergic stimulation, PKA increases ventricular compliance in a titin isoform-dependent manner.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2005-03-02", "authors": ["NorioFukuda", "YimingWu", "PreethaNair", "Henk LGranzier"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.200409177"}

A library of potential kinase inhibitors was screened, and a series of dihydropyrrolopyrazole quinolines was identified as highly potent inhibitors of MLK7 in vitro catalytic activity. Of this series, an aryl-substituted dihydropyrrolopyrazole quinoline (DHP-2) demonstrated an IC50 of 70 nM for inhibition of pJNK formation in COS-7 cell MLK7/JNK co-transfection assays. In stimulated cells, DHP-2 at 200 nM or MLK7 small interfering RNA completely blocked anisomycin and UV induced but had no effect on interleukin-1beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced p38 and JNK activation. Additionally, the compound blocked anisomycin and UV-induced apoptosis in COS-7 cells. Heart tissue homogenates from MLK7 transgenic mice treated with DHP-2 at 30 mg/kg had reduced JNK and p38 activation with no apparent effect on ERK activation, demonstrating that this compound can be used to block MLK7-driven MAPK pathway activation in vivo.

STZ hyperglycemic rats also predisposed the heart to produce high levels of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and CXCL8. Subsequent I/R further increased (P < 0.01) the cytokine production, an effect partly prevented by hemin treatment.

We assessed whether aging is coupled with increased burden of infection in BALB/c mice after intranasal infection by C. pneumoniae. Six- and twenty-month-old BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 5 x 10(4) inclusion forming units (IFU) or 5 x 10(5) IFU of C. pneumoniae.

At both doses, aging was associated with a decreased proportion of animals that cleared infection from the lung and greater burden of infectious organism within the lung. We observed dose-dependent spread to the heart/ascending aorta in animals infected with C. pneumoniae. In mice given 5 x 10(4) IFU, spread to the heart by day 14 was only observed in old mice. By day 28, all animals inoculated with 5 x 10(4) IFU showed evidence of spread to the heart, although higher C. pneumoniae titers were observed in the hearts from old mice. In mice inoculated with 5 x 10(5) IFU, spread of C. pneumoniae to the heart was evident by day 14, with no discernible age effect.

One confounding factor specific to muscle tissue (both skeletal and cardiac) is that the visible/NIR absorbance spectrum of myoglobin (Mb), an intracellular O(2) storage protein, is virtually identical to that of hemoglobin (Hb). As a consequence, the relative contributions of Mb and Hb to the NIR spectra measured in vivo for blood perfused muscle tissue cannot be determined from the measured spectra alone. To estimate the relative contributions of Mb and Hb to NIR spectra and spectroscopic images, isolated pig hearts were perfused first with a Hb-free blood substitute (Krebs-Henseleit buffer; KHB) and then with a 50/50 KHB/blood mixture, with spectroscopic images acquired at each step. Tissue Mb levels were estimated directly from the measurements during KHB perfusion, and total (Mb+Hb) levels were estimated from the images acquired during 50/50 blood/KHB perfusion. Myoglobin accounted for 63 +/- 11% of the total heme content during perfusion with the 50/50 mixture (implying that Mb would contribute 46% of the combined (Mb+Hb) NIR profile during whole blood perfusion), confirming that Mb contributes substantially to near-infrared absorbance spectra of blood perfused cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Applied spectroscopy", "date": "2005-02-22", "authors": ["Stephen PNighswander-Rempel", "Valery VKupriyanov", "R AnthonyShaw"], "doi": "10.1366/0003702053085106"}

Delivery of an electric shock (defibrillation) is the only effective way of restoring the normal rhythm. This study focuses on examining whether higher degrees of disorganization requires higher shock strengths to defibrillate and whether microscopic conductivity fluctuations favor shock success.\nWe developed a three-dimensional computer bidomain model of a block of cardiac tissue with straight fibers immersed in a conductive bath. The membrane behavior was described by the Courtemanche human atrial action potential model incorporating electroporation and an acetylcholine- (ACh) dependent potassium current. Intracellular conductivities were varied stochastically around nominal values with variations of up to 50%. A single rotor reentry was initiated and, by adjusting the spatial ACh variation, the level of organization could be controlled. The single rotor could be stabilized or spiral wave breakup could be provoked leading to fibrillatory-like activity. For each level of organization, multiple shock timings and strengths were applied to compute the probability of shock success as a function of shock strength.\nOur results suggest that the level of the small-scale conductivity fluctuations is a very important factor in defibrillation. A higher variation significantly lowers the required shock strength. Further, we demonstrated that success also heavily depends on the level of organization of the fibrillatory episode.

Now we showed that the increase in CTGF expression in cardiac tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was reversed by captopril and islet cell transplantation. Infusion of AngII in rats increased CTGF mRNA expression by 15-fold, which was completely inhibited by co-infusion with AT1 receptor antagonist, candesartan. Similarly, incubation of cultured cardiomyocytes with AngII increased CTGF mRNA expression by 2-fold, which was blocked by candesartan and a general PKC inhibitor, GF109203X. The role of PKC isoform-dependent action was further studied using adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer of dominant negative (dn) PKC or wild type PKC isoforms. Expression of dnPKCalpha, -epsilon, and -zeta isoforms suppressed AngII-induced CTGF expression in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, expression of dominant negative PKCdelta significantly increased AngII-induced CTGF expression, whereas expression of wild type PKCdelta inhibited this induction. This inhibitory effect was further confirmed in the myocardium of transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of PKCdelta (deltaTg mice).

Here, we study the potential functional roles of ANKRD1 by searching for endogenous cardiac proteins that interact preferentially with ANKRD1 in the heart-tissue extract from neonatal piglets, using non-biased pull-down approaches. These approaches identified, for the first time, a selective interaction between ANKRD1 and endogenous cardiac calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2) that is important for Ca2+ release and excitation-contraction coupling. Blot-overlay and co-immunoprecipitation assays provided further confirmation of the direct and specific interaction between the two proteins. Mapping of the peptides involved in the interaction revealed five non-overlapping binding sequences for CASQ2 on ANKRD1, as well as, three binding peptides for ANKRD1 in CASQ2. For the first time, we show by immunohistochemistry that endogenous ANKRD1 and CASQ2 are co-enriched in piglet cardiac Purkinje cells. Collectively, the results provide the first sing of a possible functional interaction between ANKRD1 and CASQ2 and suggest a potentially novel role for both proteins in cardiac Purkinje fibers.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2005-02-09", "authors": ["MarioTorrado", "BeatrizNespereira", "EduardoL\u00f3pez", "AlbertoCenteno", "AlfonsoCastro-Beiras", "Alexander TMikhailov"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.11.034"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective activity of melatonin and its novel synthesized derivatives on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "This study aimed at evaluation of melatonin and some of its novel synthesized derivatives 3, 4, 9 and 10b as cardioprotective agents against doxorubicin-induced acute cardiac toxicity in rats. Also, this work was extended to study the potential role of each synthesized derivative in comparison with the parent compound melatonin. Intraperitoneal injection of a single dose (15mg/kg B.W.) of doxorubicin resulted in significant increase in serum troponin I, leptin, triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels with concomitant decrease in serum T(3), T(4) and IL-1alpha levels. In contrast, intraperitoneal injection of melatonin or its synthesized derivatives especially compounds 3 and 10b in a dose of 5mg/kg B.W./day for 10days reversed doxorubicin-induced changes in the above mentioned parameters towards the normal values. The present data revealed that doxorubicin exerts its action mainly through the oxidative stress. This appeared from the significant elevation in serum nitric oxide level and cardiac lipid peroxidation level with concomitant decrease in cardiac antioxidative enzymes activity. Treatment with melatonin and its derivatives 3 and 10b could reduce the markers of oxidative stress and restore the activity of the antioxidative enzymes in the heart tissue. In conclusion, the cardioprotective effect of melatonin and its derivatives may be mediated through the antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity of these compounds.", "journal": "Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "date": "2005-02-09", "authors": ["Hanaa HAhmed", "FathiaMannaa", "Gamal AElmegeed", "Senot HDoss"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2004.10.066"}

The central transsarcolemmal linker between the actin membrane cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix is represented by the dystrophin-associated dystroglycans. Chemical cross-linking analysis revealed no significant differences in the dimeric status of the $\\alpha$ -/ $\\beta$ -dystroglycan subcomplex in the dystrophic mdx heart as compared to normal cardiac tissue. In analogy to skeletal muscle fibres, heart muscle also exhibited a greatly reduced abundance of both dystroglycans in dystrophin-deficient cells. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the degree of reduction in $\\alpha$ -dystroglycan is more pronounced in matured mdx skeletal muscle as contrasted to the mdx heart. The fact that the deficiency in dystrophin triggers a similar pathobiochemical response in both types of muscle suggests that the cardiomyopathic complications observed in $x$ -linked muscular dystrophy might be initiated by the loss of the dystrophin-associated surface glycoprotein complex.", "journal": "Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology", "date": "2005-02-04", "authors": ["JamesLohan", "KevinCulligan", "KayOhlendieck"], "doi": "10.1155/JBB.2005.28"}
{"title": "Endothelin mediates superoxide production in angiotensin II-induced hypertension in rats.", "abstract": "Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 (ET) are two hormones involved in cardiovascular diseases and well known for their capacity to induce free radical generation in vascular and cardiac tissues. In addition to its prooxidative effect, angiotensin II can increase the synthesis of ET-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Our objective was to determine whether the ET-1 synthesis in VSMC is involved in angiotensin II-induced superoxide anion production in rats. Our results show that treatments of isolated VSMC with angiotensin II and ET increased superoxide. However, this increase occurred in a bimodal fashion for angiotensin II with a fast transient production (10 min) and a late sustained production (6 h), while ET-1 induced superoxide formation after a delay of 6 h. LU302872 and BQ-123, a nonselective and a selective ETA receptor antagonists, respectively, prevented angiotensin II-induced superoxide anion production only during the late phase. In contrast, BQ-3020, a selective ETB receptor antagonist, had no effect. In vivo, LU302872 reduced the aortic superoxide production induced by angiotensin II administered for 12 days. In conclusion, our results suggest that the superoxide generation induced by chronic angiotensin II infusion may be mediated by ET-1 acting on ETA receptors in VSMC in vitro. Furthermore, this effect appears to contribute to the excess superoxide production during the chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system in vivo.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2005-02-03", "authors": ["Marc-Andr\u00e9Laplante", "RongWu", "PierreMoreau", "Jacquesde Champlain"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.11.026"}

Cryoablation of AFL was performed in 48 patients from 11 centers. The procedure was immediately successful in 45 patients (94%), and effective in 30 of 40 patients with complete data available at 6 months.

{"title": "Mechanistic model of cardiac energy metabolism predicts localization of glycolysis to cytosolic subdomain during ischemia.", "abstract": "A new multidomain mathematical model of cardiac cellular metabolism was developed to simulate metabolic responses to reduced myocardial blood flow. The model is based on mass balances and reaction kinetics that describe transport and metabolic processes of 31 key chemical species in cardiac tissue. The model has three distinct domains (blood, cytosol, and mitochondria) with interdomain transport of chemical species. In addition to distinguishing between cytosol and mitochondria, the model includes a subdomain in the cytosol to account for glycolytic metabolic channeling. Myocardial ischemia was induced by a 60% reduction in coronary blood flow, and model simulations were compared with experimental data from anesthetized pigs. Simulations with a previous model without compartmentation showed a slow activation of glycogen breakdown and delayed lactate production compared with experimental results. The addition of a subdomain for glycolysis resulted in simulations showing faster rates of glycogen breakdown and lactate production that closely matched in vivo experimental data. The dynamics of redox (NADH/NAD+) and phosphorylation (ADP/ATP) states were also simulated. These controllers are coupled to energy transfer reactions and play key regulatory roles in the cytosol and mitochondria. Simulations showed a similar dynamic response of the mitochondrial redox state and the rate of pyruvate oxidation during ischemia. In contrast, the cytosolic redox state displayed a time response similar to that of lactate production. In conclusion, this novel mechanistic model effectively predicted the rapid activation of glycogen breakdown and lactate production at the onset of ischemia and supports the concept of localization of glycolysis to a subdomain of the cytosol.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Combined effects of caffeine and malnutrition on the newborn rat's myocardium.", "abstract": "We hypothesized that the pathological effects on the neonatal rat heart could be aggravated by Cu deficiency due to the combined effects of caffeine exposure and malnutrition. Upon birth, pups were mixed and randomly picked; 8 pups were assigned to each dam and then divided into 4 groups. Group 1 dams received a normal diet containing 20% protein. Group 2 dams were fed 20% protein diet supplemented with caffeine (4 mg/100 g BW). Group 3 dams received 6% protein diet as a malnourished group, and group 4 dams received 6% protein diet supplemented with caffeine (4 mg/100 g BW). On postnatal day 10, dams and pups were killed. Group 2 tended to have a decrease in the Cu levels of dams' plasma and milk and in pups' plasma and heart tissue compared to those of group 1. This pattern was not observed consistently between groups 3 and 4. Transmission electron microscopy of group 2 pups' hearts revealed a degree of disruption in the mitochondria compared to normal mitochondria seen in group 1. There was no consistent change in the mitochondria of group 4 compared to group 3. The caffeine level observed in all categories of group 4 (dams' plasma and milk, pups' plasma and heart tissue) was lower than those in group 2. Although malnutrition affected body weight and heart weight, combined effects of caffeine and malnutrition on Cu content in the neonatal heart was relatively minor compared to the well nourished group.

The most realistic simulations are based on reaction-diffusion models and involve a considerable computational burden. The aim of this study was to develop a computer model of cardiac electrical activity able to simulate complex electrophysiological phenomena but free of the large computational demands required by other commonly used models.\nA cellular automata system was used to model the cardiac tissue. Each individual unit had several discrete states that changed according to simple rules as a function of the previous state and the state of the neighboring cells. Activation was considered as a probabilistic process and was adjusted using restitution curves. In contrast, repolarization was modeled as a deterministic phenomenon. Cell currents in the model were calculated with a prototypical action potential that allowed virtual monopolar and bipolar electrograms to be simulated at any point in space.\nReproducible flat activation fronts, propagation from a focal stimulus, and reentry processes that were stable and unstable in two dimensions (with their corresponding electrograms) were obtained. The model was particularly suitable for the simulation of the effects observed in curvilinear activation fronts. Fibrillatory conduction and stable rotors in two- and three-dimensional substrates were also obtained.\nThe probabilistic cellular automata model was simple to implement and was not associated with a high computational burden.

{"title": "The human diving response, its function, and its control.", "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to outline the physiological responses associated with the diving response, its functional significance, and its cardiorespiratory control. This review is separated into four major sections. Section one outlines the diving response and its physiology. Section two provides support for the hypothesis that the primary role of the diving response is the conservation of oxygen. The third section describes how the diving response is controlled and provides a model that illustrates the cardiorespiratory interaction. Finally, the fourth section illustrates potential adaptations that result after regular exposure to an asphyxic environment. The cardiovascular and endocrine responses associated with the diving response and apnea are bradycardia, vasoconstriction, and an increase in secretion of suprarenal catecholamines. These responses require the integration of both the cardiovascular system and the respiratory system. The primary role of the diving response is likely to conserve oxygen for sensitive brain and heart tissue and to lengthen the time before the onset of serious hypoxic damage.

{"title": "Myocardial tissue damage in rabbits injected with group A streptococci, types M1 and M22. Role of bacterial immunoglobulin G-binding surface proteins.", "abstract": "Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), two important sequelae of streptococcal throat or skin infections, according to current concepts may be elicited by autoimmune mechanisms due to molecular mimicry between group A streptococci (GAS) and human tissue. In the case of APSGN, however, our experimental data have indicated that GAS immunoglobulin-binding surface proteins (IgG BPs) might be of pathogenic significance by triggering anti-IgG production and immune complex formation leading to renal damage. Thus, rabbits injected with IgG-binding, as opposed to non-binding, GAS strains were found to develop renal deposition of IgG and complement factor C3 and inflammatory and degenerative glomerular changes resembling the picture seen in APSGN. In the present study, cardiac tissue material from rabbits injected with GAS was investigated. After 8 or more weeks of intravenous (i.v.) injections, minimal changes were seen in those animals receiving an IgG non-binding GAS strain, type T27, whereas those animals receiving either of two IgG-binding GAS strains, types M1 or M22, developed strong inflammatory and degenerative myocardial changes accompanied by deposition of IgG and C3. Furthermore, on injecting rabbits with defined mutants of a type M22 strain, the development of myocardial tissue damage proved to be dependent on the presence of streptococcal IgG-binding activity. Our results demonstrate that myocardial tissue changes may be induced in the rabbit by i.v. injection of whole heat-killed GAS of at least two M serotypes. Conceivably, induction of immune complexes by bacterial IgG BPs may lead to myocardial deposition of IgG, in turn triggering a series of events, involving the complement system and proinflammatory cytokines, with resulting tissue damage. Though many virulence factors may be involved in the development of ARF and APSGN, and a given GAS strain will never cause both, our results may suggest a new pathogenetic mechanism common to these two major non-suppurative complications.", "journal": "APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica", "date": "2005-01-29", "authors": ["L ABurova", "V ANagornev", "P VPigarevsky", "M MGladilina", "E AGavrilova", "V GSeliverstova", "A ATotolian", "AThern", "CSchal\u00e9n"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0463.2005.apm1130104.x"}

{"title": "Different intracellular polyamine concentrations underlie the difference in the inward rectifier K(+) currents in atria and ventricles of the guinea-pig heart.", "abstract": "The outward component of the strong inward rectifier potassium current, I(K1), is significantly larger in ventricles than in atria of the heart, resulting in faster repolarization at the final phase of the action potential in ventricles. However, the underlying mechanism of the difference in I(K1) remains poorly understood. I(K1) channels are composed of subunits from the Kir2 subfamily, and I(K1) amplitude is determined by the voltage-dependent blockade of the channel by the intracellular polyamines spermine and spermidine, and by Mg(2+). Using a perforated patch-clamp method, which minimizes changes in the intracellular polyamine and Mg(2+) concentrations, we detected repolarization-induced outward I(K1) transients, which are caused by competition between Mg(2+) and spermine to block the channel, in ventricular but not in atrial myocytes from guinea-pig heart. The contribution of the Kir2.3 subunit to the I(K1) channel was found to be minor in the guinea-pig heart, because the activation time course of the Kir2.3 currents was approximately 10-fold slower than those of I(K1), and the marked external pH sensitivity of the Kir2.3 currents was not found in I(K1). Both the Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 currents recorded from inside-out patches exhibited outward transients similar to those of ventricular I(K1) in the presence of 5-10 microM spermine and 0.6-1.1 mM Mg(2+), and their amplitudes were diminished by increasing the spermine or spermidine concentrations. The total and free polyamine concentrations in guinea-pig cardiac tissues were higher in atria than ventricles.

{"title": "Telomere-independent cellular senescence in human fetal cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Fetal cardiomyocytes have been proposed as a potential source of cell-based therapy for heart failure. This study examined cellular senescence in cultured human fetal ventricular cardiomyocytes (HFCs). HFCs were isolated and identified by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. Cells were found to senesce after 20-25 population doublings, as determined by growth arrest, morphological changes and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. Using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay, telomerase activity was undetectable in primary HFCs. Cells were transduced to express the human reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT) of telomerase. This resulted in greatly increased telomerase activity, but no significant lifespan extension. Analysis of telomere length in primary HFCs revealed that the senescent phenotype was not accompanied by telomere shortening. Telomeres in hTERT-positive cells were elongated in comparison with primary cells, and elongation was retained in senescent cells. Levels of the tumor suppressor protein p16INK4A increased in all senescent cells whether telomerase-positive or -negative. Senescence was accompanied by a decline in transcript levels of the polycomb gene Bmi-1, Ets1 and Ets2 transcription factors, and Id1, Id2 and Id3 helix-loop-helix proteins, suggesting roles for these genes in maintenance of cardiomyocyte proliferative capacity.

{"title": "Measuring curvature and velocity vector fields for waves of cardiac excitation in 2-D media.", "abstract": "Excitable media theory predicts the effect of electrical wavefront morphology on the dynamics of propagation in cardiac tissue. It specifies that a convex wavefront propagates slower and a concave wavefront propagates faster than a planar wavefront. Because of this, wavefront curvature is thought to be an important functional mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias. However, the curvature of wavefronts during an arrhythmia are generally unknown. We introduce a robust, automated method to measure the curvature vector field of discretely characterized, arbitrarily shaped, two-dimensional (2-D) wavefronts. The method relies on generating a smooth, continuous parameterization of the shape of a wave using cubic smoothing splines fitted to an isopotential at a specified level, which we choose to be -30 mV. Twice differentiating the parametric form provides local curvature vectors along the wavefront and waveback. Local conduction velocities are computed as the wave speed along lines normal to the parametric form. In this way, the curvature and velocity vector field for wavefronts and wavebacks can be measured. We applied the method to data sampled from a 2-D numerical model and several examples are provided to illustrate its usefulness for studying the dynamics of cardiac propagation in 2-D media.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2005-01-18", "authors": ["Matthew WKay", "Richard AGray"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2004.839798"}
{"title": "Ontogenetic changes and developmental adjustments in lactate dehydrogenase isozymes of an obligate air-breathing fish Channa punctatus during deprivation of air access.", "abstract": "In air-breathing snakehead Channa punctatus, Ldh-B is expressed at all ontogenetic and developmental stages, while Ldh-A is expressed temporally in pre-hatchlings 12-13 days ahead of bimodal respiration marked by air-breathing. Remarkable differences are observed in the LDH isozyme expression among various ontogenetic and developmental stages upon denying air access. When denied air access, water-breathing larvae show two distinct characteristics: (i) they survive longer than transitory air-breathers due to independence from air-breathing and (ii) there is more transient induction of Ldh-B than Ldh-A. Transition to bimodal breathing, which occurred post-hatching in 15-day old larvae, is coincidental with inducibility of Ldh-A and concomitant down-regulation of Ldh-B. Heart tissue from air-breathing adults denied air access shows a preferential expression of LDH-A subunit and slight down-regulation of LDH-B. Heterotetramers of A and B subunits participate in adjusting LDH levels among those stages which either precede air-breathing switchover, or are subsequent to this transition. The contribution of heterotetramers depends on the stage-specific levels of LDH homotetramers A(4) or B(4). Scaling of muscle mass during growth, tolerance to extended deprivation of air access and induction of Ldh-A are correlated. Response to restoring air contact indicated that advanced air-breathing stages of C. punctatus possess an inherent capacity to sense surface air. In kinetic properties, LDH isozymes of C. punctatus are teleost-like but species specificity is displayed in oxidative potential by cardiac muscle and in L-lactate reduction by skeletal muscle.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1/CD39, localized in neurons of human and porcine heart, modulates ATP-induced norepinephrine exocytosis.", "abstract": "Using a guinea pig heart synaptosomal preparation, we previously observed that norepinephrine (NE) exocytosis was attenuated by a blockade of P2X purinoceptors, potentiated by inhibition of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (E-NTPDase1)/CD39, and reduced by soluble CD39, a recombinant form of human E-NTPDase1/CD39. This suggests that norepinephrine and ATP are coreleased upon depolarization of cardiac sympathetic nerve endings and that ATP enhances norepinephrine exocytosis by an action modulated by E-NTPDase1/CD39 activity. Whether E-NTPDase1/CD39 is localized to cardiac neurons and modulates norepinephrine exocytosis in intact heart tissue remained untested. We report that E-NTPDase1/CD39 is selectively localized in human and porcine cardiac neurons and that depolarization of porcine heart tissue elicits omega-conotoxin-inhibitable release of both norepinephrine and ATP. Inhibition of E-NTPDase1/CD39 with ARL67156 markedly potentiated ATP release, demonstrating that E-NTPDase1/CD39 is a major determinant of ATP availability at sympathetic nerve terminals. Notably, inhibition of E-NTPDase1/CD39 enhanced both ATP and NE exocytosis, whereas administration of soluble CD39 reduced both ATP and NE exocytosis. The strong correlation between ATP and norepinephrine release was abolished in the presence of the purinergic P2X receptor (P2XR) antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS). We conclude that released ATP governs norepinephrine exocytosis by activating presynaptic P2XR and that this action is controlled by neuronal E-NTPDase1/CD39. Clinically, excessive norepinephrine release is a major cause of arrhythmic and coronary vascular dysfunction during myocardial ischemia. By curtailing NE release, in addition to its effects as an antithrombotic agent, soluble CD39 may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to ischemic complications in the myocardium.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2005-01-14", "authors": ["TakujiMachida", "Paul MHeerdt", "Alicia CReid", "UlrichSch\u00e4fer", "Randi BSilver", "M JohanBroekman", "Aaron JMarcus", "RobertoLevi"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.104.081240"}
{"title": "GRIF-1 and OIP106, members of a novel gene family of coiled-coil domain proteins: association in vivo and in vitro with kinesin.", "abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor-interacting factor (GRIF-1) is a 913-amino acid protein proposed to function as a GABA(A) receptor beta(2) subunit-interacting, trafficking protein. GRIF-1 shares approximately 44% amino acid sequence identity with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase interacting protein 106, OIP106. Both proteins contain predicted coiled-coil domains and probably constitute a novel gene family. The Drosophila orthologue of this family of proteins may be Milton. Milton shares approximately 44% amino acid homology with GRIF-1. Milton is proposed to function in kinesin-mediated transport of mitochondria to nerve terminals. We report here that GRIF-1 and OIP106 also associate with kinesin and mitochondria. Following expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, both GRIF-1 and OIP106 were shown by co-immunoprecipitation to be specifically associated with an endogenous kinesin heavy chain species of 115 kDa and exogenous KIF5C. Association of GRIF-1 with kinesin was also evident in native brain and heart tissue. In the brain, anti-GRIF-1-(8-633) antibodies specifically co-immunoprecipitated two kinesin-immunoreactive species with molecular masses of 118 and 115 kDa, and in the heart, one kinesin-immunoreactive species, 115 kDa, was immunoprecipitated. Further studies revealed that GRIF-1 was predominantly associated with KIF5A in the brain and with KIF5B in both the heart and in HEK 293 cells. Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays and immunoprecipitations showed that GRIF-1 associated directly with KIF5C with the GRIF-1/KIF5C interaction domain localized to GRIF-1-(124-283). These results further support a role for GRIF-1 and OIP106 in protein and/or organelle transport in excitable cells in a manner analogous to glutamate receptor-interacting-protein 1, in the motor-dependent transport of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate glutamate excitatory neurotransmitter receptors to dendrites.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2005-01-13", "authors": ["KieranBrickley", "Miriam JSmith", "MikeBeck", "F AnneStephenson"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M409095200"}

Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an active component of propolis, has several biological and pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, antiviral, and immunomodulatory activities. In light of the antioxidant ability of CAPE, the effects of CAPE on the antioxidative status of cardiac tissue were investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.\nTwenty-six rats were randomly divided into three groups: group I, control, nondiabetic rats (n = 9); group II, STZ-induced, untreated diabetic rats (n = 7); and group III, STZ-induced, CAPE-treated diabetic rats (n = 10). In groups II and III, diabetes developed 3 days after intraperitoneal (ip) administration of a single 35 mg kg(-1) dose of STZ. Thereafter, while the rats in group II received no treatment, the rats in group III began to receive a 10 mumol kg(-1) ip dose of CAPE per day. After 8 weeks, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the cardiac tissues of all groups were analyzed.\nIn untreated diabetic rats, MDA markedly increased in the cardiac tissue compared with the control rats (P < 0.05). However, MDA levels were reduced to the control level by CAPE. The activities of SOD and CAT in the untreated diabetic group and the CAPE-treated diabetic group were higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Rats in the CAPE-treated diabetic group had reduced activities of SOD and CAT in comparison with the rats in the untreated diabetic group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the activity of GSH-Px between the rats in the untreated diabetic group and the control group. However, the activity of GSH-Px was increased in CAPE-treated diabetic rats compared with the control and untreated diabetic rats (P < 0.05).\nThese results reveal that diabetes mellitus increases oxidative stress in cardiac tissue and CAPE has an ameliorating effect on the oxidative stress via its antioxidant property.", "journal": "Clinical biochemistry", "date": "2005-01-12", "authors": ["HuseyinOkutan", "NurtenOzcelik", "H RamazanYilmaz", "EfkanUz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2004.10.003"}

A NOS isoform is present in cardiac mitochondria and it is derived from neuronal NOS (nNOS). However, the role of nNOS in the control of MVO2 remains unknown. MVO2 in left ventricular tissues from nNOS-/- mice was measured in vitro. Stimulation of NO production by bradykinin or carbachol induced a significant reduction in MVO2 in wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast to WT, bradykinin- or carbachol-induced reduction in MVO2 was attenuated in nNOS-/-. S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline, a potent isoform selective inhibitor of nNOS, had no effect on bradykinin-induced reduction in MVO2 in WT. Bradykinin-induced reduction in MVO2 in eNOS-/- mice, in which nNOS still exists, was also attenuated. The attenuated bradykinin-induced reduction in MVO2 in nNOS-/- was restored by preincubation with Tiron, ascorbic acid, Tempol, oxypurinol, or SB203850, an inhibitor of p38 kinase, but not apocynin. There was an increase in lucigenin-detectable superoxide anion (O2-) in cardiac tissues from nNOS-/- compared with WT. Tempol, oxypurinol, or SB203850 decreased O2- in all groups to levels that were not different from each other. There was an increase in phosphorylated p38 kinase normalized by total p38 kinase protein level in nNOS-/- compared with WT mice.

{"title": "Heart malformation is an early response to TCDD in embryonic zebrafish.", "abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become an attractive vertebrate model for studying developmental processes, and is emerging as a model system for studying the mechanisms by which toxic compounds perturb normal development. When exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) shortly after fertilization, zebrafish embryos exhibit pericardial edema and reduced blood flow by 72 h post fertilization (hpf). To better understand the progression of dioxin toxicity in zebrafish, we have examined the effects of TCDD on heart development. At 72 hpf, TCDD-treated embryos exhibited altered looping, with the atria positioned distinctly posterior to the ventricles, contrary to the looping of control hearts, where the two chambers lied side by side. Moreover, the ventricles in dioxin-exposed hearts became more compact, and the atria elongated in comparison to controls. These defects are not secondary to pericardial edema because they were observed when edema formation was suppressed with osmotic support. In addition to morphological changes, TCDD produced functional deficits in the developing hearts, including blood regurgitation and a striking ventricular standstill that became prevalent by 120 hpf. We also assessed the effect of TCDD on the heart size using stereological measurements, which demonstrated significant reduction in heart tissue volume at 72 hpf. Perhaps our most significant finding was a decrease in the total number of cardiomyocytes in TCDD-exposed embryos by 48 hpf, one day prior to observable effects on peripheral blood flow.

{"title": "Chronic cardiotrophin-1 stimulation impairs contractile function in reconstituted heart tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is known to promote survival but also to induce an elongated morphology of isolated cardiac myocytes, leading to the hypothesis that CT-1, which is chronically augmented in human heart failure, might induce eccentric cardiac hypertrophy and contractile failure. To address this, we used heart tissues reconstituted from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (engineered heart tissue, EHT) as multicellular in vitro test systems. CT-1 dose-dependently affected contractile function in EHTs. After treatment with 0.1 nM CT-1 (corresponds to plasma levels in humans) for 10 days, twitch tension significantly decreased to 0.30 +/- 0.04 mN (n = 15) vs. 0.45 +/- 0.04 mN (n = 16) in controls. Furthermore, positive inotropic effects of cumulative concentrations of Ca2+ and isoprenaline were significantly diminished. Maximum isoprenaline-induced increase in twitch tension amounted to 0.27 +/- 0.04 mN (n = 15) vs. 0.47 +/- 0.06 mN (n = 16) in controls (P < 0.001). When EHTs were treated for only 5 days, qualitatively similar results were obtained but changes were less pronounced. Immunostaining of whole mount EHT preparations revealed that after CT-1 treatment, the number of nonmyocytes significantly increased by 98% (1 nM, 10 days), and myocytes did not form compact, longitudinally oriented muscle bundles. Interestingly, expression of the Ca2+-handling protein calsequestrin was markedly reduced (69 +/- 7% of control) by treatment with CT-1 (0.1 nM, 10 days).

{"title": "Redox regulation of cardiac protein kinase C.", "abstract": "The two extremes of redox stress imposed on cardiac tissue under ischemia and reperfusion change the redox potential of the cells and affect numerous redox-sensitive molecules, including the ones involved in intracellular communication. Protein kinase C (PKC), a key signalling kinase, is one of those subject to redox control. Activation of PKC by oxidation represents a new paradigm of the alternate signalling principle. Reactive oxygen species act directly on PKC, releasing chelated Zn(2+) ions from the zinc finger of the regulatory domain. Zn(2+) release from PKC by oxidative stress has been shown at the level of isolated protein fragments, PKC immune complexes and single cells. Zn(2+) movements have been further characterized in cryosections prepared from adult rat hearts subjected to in vivo stress by global ischemia followed by reperfusion. The morphology of labile zinc in cardiac tissue and zinc release following PKC stimulation with lipid activator are described. The studies lead to an unexpected and intriguing result, suggesting that in addition to serving a structural function, Zn(2+) ions are likely to play a dynamic regulatory role in PKC. The cysteine-rich domains of the serine/threonine kinases are identified as redox sensors.

Recent studies indicate that consumption of phytoestorogens, e.g., isoflavones such as genistein (GE), may have potential cardiovascular health benefits; however, no studies have evaluated the effect of these agents on toxicant-induced damage in the heart. Since estrogen receptors are found in the heart, and GE mimics estrogenic effects, we have examined whether or not dietary GE or 17 beta-estradiol (E2) modulates the lacI mutant frequency (MF) in the heart of ovariectomized (OVX) Big Blue rats exposed to the model carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Groups of female rats were administered 80 mg/kg DMBA or vehicle by gavage and were chronically fed with diets containing 0, 250, or 1,000 microg/g GE or 5 microg/g E2. Sixteen weeks after carcinogen treatment, the animals were sacrificed and the hearts were removed and processed for determining the frequency and types of mutations in the heart tissue. GE and E2 supplementation alone resulted in nonsignificant increases in MF. The DMBA-induced lacI MF in the heart was sevenfold higher than the control (119.8 +/- 18.7 x 10(-6) vs. 17.4 +/- 3.2 x 10(-6); P < 0.001). GE in the diet had no significant effect on DMBA mutagenicity, while feeding E2 to DMBA-treated rats caused a significant reduction in the MF (119.8+/- 18.7 x 10(-6) vs. 61.4 +/- 13.5 x 10(-6); P < 0.017). DNA sequence analysis revealed that the majority of DMBA-induced mutations in rats fed control diet were A:T-->T:A (42%) and G:C-->T:A (19%) transversions, followed by G:C-->A:T (13%) and A:T-->G:C (8%) transitions. Feeding E2 altered the DMBA-induced mutational spectra by decreasing A:T-->T:A (23%) and G:C-->T:A (13%) transversions and increasing G:C-->A:T (24%) and A:T-->G:C (21%) transitions. Taken together, the results suggest that DMBA can induce gene mutations in heart tissue of OVX rats, and while dietary GE had little or no effect on DMBA-induced mutation, dietary E2 reduced the mutagenicity of DMBA.", "journal": "Environmental and molecular mutagenesis", "date": "2004-12-22", "authors": ["Mugimane GManjanatha", "Sharon DShelton", "Bobbie SRhodes", "Michelle EBishop", "Lascelles ELyn-Cook", "AnameAidoo"], "doi": "10.1002/em.20080"}
{"title": "Convergent proliferative response and divergent morphogenic pathways induced by epicardial and endocardial signaling in fetal heart development.", "abstract": "Heart development requires cardiomyocyte proliferation, coupled with morphogenic differentiation of the inner trabecular myocardium and the outer compact zone myocardium. In mouse embryos lacking the retinoic acid receptor RXRalpha, proliferation and morphogenesis of the compact zone fails. We demonstrated previously that epicardial cells, in response to retinoic acid, secrete an activity that promotes cell proliferation. In this study, we have investigated downstream signaling pathways that are elicited in response to this factor. We find that cells treated in culture activate PI3 kinase and Erk pathways, and that these are required for a proliferative response. In vivo, phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta (PI3K pathway) and of Erk1/2 and p90rsk (Erk pathway) is substantially reduced in RXRalpha-deficient heart tissue. Neuregulin, a mitogen secreted from the endocardium which promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and trabecular differentiation, also activates proliferation via PI3K and Erk pathways. However, the epicardial factor is not neuregulin, and does not function via the neuregulin receptor. Gene markers known to be selectively expressed in trabecular or compact myocardium in vivo are differentially activated in cell culture by treatment with neuregulin or epicardial factor, and are misexpressed in RXRalpha(-/-) heart tissue. We therefore conclude that epicardial and endocardial signals converge on common proliferative components, but diverge in downstream pathways that lead to compact vs. trabecular morphogenic differentiation.", "journal": "Mechanisms of development", "date": "2004-12-08", "authors": ["Ji-OneKang", "Henry MSucov"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mod.2004.09.001"}

More recently, the negative inotropic agent 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) has been used. However, there remains a lack of data regarding the influence of temperature, Ca(2+), and BDM on the passive mechanical properties of cardiac tissue. We have used the dynamic stiffness technique, a sensitive measurement of cross-bridge activity, in which minute (approximately 0.2% of muscle length) sinusoidal perturbations are applied at various frequencies (0.2-100 Hz) to quiescent, viable right ventricular rat trabeculae at two temperatures (20 degrees C and 26 degrees C) and at two [Ca(2+)](o) (0.5 and 1.25 mM) in the presence and absence of BDM (20 mM). The stiffness spectra (amplitude and phase) were sensitive to temperature and [Ca(2+)](o) in the absence of BDM but insensitive in the presence of BDM. From the index of cross-bridge cycling (the ratio of high- to low-frequency stiffness amplitude), we infer that BDM inhibits a small degree of spontaneous sarcomere activity, thereby allowing the true passive properties of trabeculae to be determined. In the absence of BDM, the extent of spontaneous sarcomere activity decreases with increasing temperature. We caution that the measured mechanical properties of passive cardiac tissue are critically dependent on the experimental conditions under which they are measured. Experiments must be performed at sufficiently high temperatures (>25 degrees C) to ensure a low resting concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) or in the presence of an inhibitor of cross-bridge cycling.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Therefore, there is great interest in developing viable tissue-based models for cardiac assist. Recent years have brought numerous advances in the development of scaffold-based models of cardiac tissue, but a self-organizing model has yet to be described. Here, we report the development of an in vitro cardiac tissue without scaffolding materials in the contractile region. Using an optimal concentration of the adhesion molecule laminin, a confluent layer of neonatal rat cardiomyogenic cells can be induced to self-organize into a cylindrical construct, resembling a papillary muscle, which we have termed a cardioid. Like endogenous heart tissue, cardioids contract spontaneously and can be electrically paced between 1 and 5 Hz indefinitely without fatigue. These engineered cardiac tissues also show an increased rate of spontaneous contraction (chronotropy), increased rate of relaxation (lusitropy), and increased force production (inotropy) in response to epinephrine.

The resultant currents flowing through the myocardium could alter the rate or rhythm of the heart. No such changes have been seen in animal experiments, or with humans, in static fields up to 8 T. The possible effects of such currents induced by fields larger than 8 T on cardiac pacemaker rate, and arrhythmogenesis are reviewed, using virtual cardiac tissues-computational models of cardiac electrophysiology. Arrhythmogenesis can be by the initiation of ectopic beats, or by re-entry, whose probability of occurrence is increased by any increase in the electrical heterogeneity, in particular, the action potential duration heterogeneity of the ventricle. Focal ectopic activity would be readily detectable, but since re-entrant arrhythmias are very rare events, even a large increase in their probability of occurrence still leaves them unlikely to be observed. Both of these two arrhythmogenic mechanisms would show a steep sigmoidal, or threshold dependence on induced current intensity, with the threshold for increasing the vulnerability to re-entry less than the threshold for initiating activity. Failure to observe them at fields less than 8 T provides only a lower bound for any threshold for arrhythmogenesis.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2004-11-24", "authors": ["Arun VHolden"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.08.015"}

The aims of the present study were to document the functional and metabolic response of the SHR heart under conditions of increased energy demand and the effects of a medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA; octanoate) supplementation in this situation. Hearts were perfused ex vivo in a working mode with physiological concentrations of substrates and hormones and subjected to an adrenergic stimulation (epinephrine, 10 microM). (13)C-labeled substrates were used to assess substrate selection for energy production. Compared with control Wistar rat hearts, SHR hearts showed an impaired response to the adrenergic stimulation as reflected by 1) a smaller increase in contractility and developed pressure, 2) a faster decline in the aortic flow, and 3) greater cardiac tissue damage (lactate dehydrogenase release: 1,577 +/- 118 vs. 825 +/- 44 mU/min, P < 0.01). At the metabolic level, SHR hearts presented 1) a reduced exogenous LCFA contribution to the citric acid cycle flux (16 +/- 1 vs. 44 +/- 4%, P < 0.001) and an enhanced contribution of endogenous substrates (20 +/- 4 vs. 1 +/- 4%, P < 0.01); and 2) an increased lactate production from glycolysis, with a greater lactate-to-pyruvate production ratio. Addition of 0.2 mM octanoate reduced lactate dehydrogenase release (1,145 +/- 155 vs. 1,890 +/- 89 mU/min, P < 0.001) and increased exogenous fatty acid contribution to energy metabolism (23.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 15.8 +/- 0.8%, P < 0.01), which was accompanied by an equivalent decrease in unlabeled endogenous substrate contribution, possibly triglycerides (11.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 19.0 +/- 1.2%, P < 0.01).

Metabolic profiling of cardiac tissue through high resolution NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with multivariate statistics has been used to classify mouse models of cardiac disease. The data sets included metabolic profiles from mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, two models of cardiac arrhythmia, and one of cardiac hypertrophy. The metabolic profiles demonstrate that the strain background is an important component of the global metabolic phenotype of a mouse, providing insight into how a given gene deletion may result in very different responses in diverse populations. Despite these differences associated with strain, multivariate statistics were capable of separating each mouse model from its control strain, demonstrating that metabolic profiles could be generated for each disease.

However, the source and the chronology of cardiac allograft infection by an enterovirus in patients receiving heart transplants remain unknown. Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assays, endomyocardial tissue samples of 30 adult patients were tested to detect the presence of specific enterovirus 5' non-coding (5'NC) sequences and of VP1 capsid protein, and this at the time of cardiac transplantation and at the 12-month biopsy for graft rejection control. Moreover, the endomyocardial detection of genomic sequences of enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus, adenoviruses, and parvovirus B19 was carried out by RT-PCR and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays at the time of late severe cardiac events. Enterovirus RNA and VP1 antigen were both detected in 4 (13%) of 30 patients at the time of the 12-month biopsy for graft rejection control, whereas no enterovirus component was detected in the explanted and implanted heart tissues taken from these 4 patients at the time of transplantation. At the time when severe cardiac events were developed, within 3 months after the positive enterovirus cardiac detection, these four patients demonstrated the presence of endomyocardial enterovirus RNA sequences whereas they were tested negative for the endomyocardial detection of genomic sequences from DNA viruses (except for CMV in two cases), and for a significant level of pp65 CMV antigenemia.

The effects of an oxygen carrier [Oxygent; 32% volume perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion] were evaluated. The parallel channel array mimics the in vivo capillary tissue bed, and the PFC emulsion has a similar role as the natural oxygen carrier hemoglobin in increasing total oxygen content. The construct was divided into an array of cylindrical domains with a channel in the center and tissue space surrounding the channel. In the channel, the main modes of mass transfer were axial convection and radial diffusion. In the tissue region, mass transfer was by axial and radial diffusion, and the consumption of oxygen was by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Neumann boundary conditions were imposed at the channel centerline and the half distance between the domains. Supplementation of culture medium by PFC emulsion improved mass transport by increasing convective term and effective diffusivity of culture medium. The model was first implemented for the following set of experimentally obtained parameters: construct thickness of 0.2 cm, channel diameter of 330 mum, channel center-to-center spacingof 700 microm, and average linear velocity per channel of 0.049 cm/s, in conjunction with PFC supplemented and unsupplemented culture medium. Subsequently, the model was used to define favorable scaffold geometry and flow conditions necessary to cultivate cardiac constructs of high cell density (10(8) cells/ml) and clinically relevant thickness (0.5 cm).

The survival of EPCR(delta/delta) mice was significantly diminished as compared to WT mice after administration of LPS via this route. Heart rates and central blood pressures also were significantly more depressed in EPCR(delta/delta) mice, indicating that the receptor-based protein C (PC) pathway functions in regulation of hemodynamic properties in the mouse. Further, heart muscle damage was more severe in EPCR(delta/delta) mice as compared to WT mice after endotoxin administration, as revealed by the more elevated plasma myoglobin levels in EPCR(delta/delta) mice and by microscopic examination of stained heart sections. Neutrophil infiltration was more pronounced in heart tissue of EPCR(delta/delta) mice, perhaps in response to the greatly increased expression level of the chemokine, MIP-2, which also significantly more up-regulated in the LPS-treated EPCR(delta/delta) mouse cohort. In conclusion, a severe deficiency of EPCR adversely affects survival of mice subjected to continuous infusion of endotoxin, via contributions of more responsive hemodynamic and cardiac alterations, thus suggesting that, among its other functions, the PC-based receptor system has a cardioprotective role after acute inflammatory challenge.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2004-11-06", "authors": ["TakayukiIwaki", "Diana TCruz", "J AndrewMartin", "Francis JCastellino"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2004-06-2456"}

We used a model based on non-invasive HeLa wild-type cells and their connexin43 (Cx43) transfected counterparts to correlate the effect of apigenin on tumour cell invasiveness with its influence on cell motility. Both cell lines displayed similar motile properties in control conditions. Apigenin treatment resulted in a significant and reversible inhibition of translocation of both HeLa wild-type cells and HeLa Cx43 transfectants. The effect of apigenin on cell proliferation was less pronounced especially at low apigenin concentration, whereas its influence on cell motility correlated with the reduction of the invasive potential of HeLa Cx43 cells as shown by an invasion assay based on the confrontation of tumour cell spheroids with chick embryo heart fragments. HeLa Cx43 cells were highly invasive in controls, but did not invade the heart tissue at tumour cell aggregate-fibroblast capsule interfaces in the presence of apigenin and failed to fully engulf these heart fragments. Because the motility of chick heart fibroblasts was only slightly affected by apigenin, these observations indicate that apigenin exerts its anti-invasive effect on HeLa cells predominantly via a specific inhibition of tumour cell motility. This inhibitory effect of apigenin on tumour cell invasiveness in vitro demonstrates that apigenin may exert its anti-tumorigenic effect in vivo via inhibition of tumour cell penetration of the healthy tissue.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2004-11-04", "authors": ["JaroslawCzyz", "ZbigniewMadeja", "UweIrmer", "WlodzimierzKorohoda", "Dieter FH\u00fclser"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.20620"}

The mRNA of TH and PNMP was also detected in fetal rat hearts before sympathetic innervation. Immunoreactivity of norepinephrine transporter (NET) was localized to ICA cells in rat heart tissue and primary cell culture. For the functional study, the activity of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients was quantified by a ratio fluorescent spectrometer in cultured ICA cells and myocytes. ICA cells generated spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients that were eliminated by tetrodotoxin or Ca(2+)-free solutions and showed greatly reduced amplitude with the addition of L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine. [3H]norepinephrine studies demonstrate release and uptake of norepinephrine. Functional interaction between catecholamines produced by the ICA cells and cocultured myocytes was evident by the effect of the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol eliciting a dose-dependent reduction in the amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i transients of beating myocytes. Hypoxia inhibited [Ca2+]i transient activity of ICA cells, which subsequently produced a reoxygenation-mediated rebound augmentation of [Ca2+]i transients. We conclude that ICA cells are capable of catecholamine synthesis, release, and uptake. They generate spontaneous [Ca2+]i transient activity that can be regulated by oxygen tension.

At 4 h after 40% total body surface area burn in anesthetized mice, serum MIF levels increased significantly compared with baseline (2.2-fold). This increase was accompanied by a significant decrease in cardiac tissue MIF levels (2.1-fold decrease compared with controls). This pattern was consistent with MIF release from preformed cytoplasmic stores in the heart and other organs. To determine whether MIF mediates cardiac dysfunction after burn injury, mice were pretreated with anti-MIF neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or isotype control antibodies. Beginning 4 h after burn injury (and continuing through 48 h), burned mice demonstrated a significantly depressed left ventricular shortening fraction of 38.6 +/- 1.8%, compared with the normal controls (56.0 +/- 2.6%). Mice treated with anti-MIF displayed an initial depression of cardiac function similar to nontreated animals but then showed rapid restoration of cardiac function with complete recovery by 24 h, which persisted for the duration of the protocol.

From this observation we hypothesized that part of the pathophysiology of MR may involve faulty energy substrate utilization, which in turn might lead to potentially harmful lipid accumulation as observed in other models of heart failure. To explore this hypothesis, we measured triglyceride accumulation in the myocardia of dogs with chronic MR and then attempted to enhance myocardial metabolism by chronic administration of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist rosiglitazone. Cardiac tissues were obtained from three groups of dogs that included control animals, dogs with MR for 3 mo without treatment, and dogs with MR for 6 mo that were treated with rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) for the last 3 mo of observation. Hemodynamics and contractile function (end-systolic stress-strain relationship, as measured by K index) were assessed at baseline, 3 mo of MR, and 6 mo of MR (3 mo of the treatment). Lipid accumulation in MR (as indicated by oil red O staining score and TLC analysis) was marked and showed an inverse correlation with the left ventricular (LV) contractility. LV contractility was significantly restored after PPAR therapy (K index: therapy, 3.01 +/- 0.11*; 3 mo MR, 2.12 +/- 0.34; baseline, 4.01 +/- 0.29; ANOVA, P = 0.038; *P < 0.05 vs. 3 mo of MR).

In the current study, we characterized a glycoasparagine carrying the tetrasaccharide moiety of alpha-D-Man-(1-->6)-beta-D-Man-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-->N)-Asn (Man2GlcNAc2-Asn) in urine of an AGU patient and also in the tissues of the AGU mouse model. Quantitative analysis demonstrated a massive accumulation of the compound especially in nonneuronal tissues of the AGU mice, in which the levels of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn were typically 30-87% of those of GlcNAc-Asn. The highest level of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn was found in the liver, spleen, and heart tissues of the AGU mice, the respective amounts being 87%, 76%, and 57% of the GlcNAc-Asn levels. In the brain tissue of AGU mice the Man2GlcNAc2-Asn storage was only 9% of that of GlcNAc-Asn. In contrast to GlcNAc-Asn, the storage of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn markedly increased in the liver and spleen tissues of AGU mice as they grew older.

In conclusion, there is evidence for a role for storage of glycoasparagines other than aspartylglucosamine in the pathogenesis of AGU, and this possibility should be taken into consideration in the treatment of the disease.", "journal": "Glycobiology", "date": "2004-09-03", "authors": ["EiraKelo", "UllaDunder", "IlkkaMononen"], "doi": "10.1093/glycob/cwh145"}
{"title": "A high-fat, refined-carbohydrate diet induces endothelial dysfunction and oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and depresses NOS protein expression.", "abstract": "We tested whether consumption of a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFS) diet can affect endothelium-dependent relaxation, whether this precedes the development of diet-induced hypertension previously noted in this model, and whether it is mediated, in part, by changes in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and/or NOS regulatory proteins. Female Fischer rats were fed either a HFS diet or standard low-fat, complex-carbohydrate chow starting at 2 mo of age for 7 mo. Vasoconstrictive response to KCl and phenylephrine was similar in both groups. Vasorelaxation to acetylcholine was significantly impaired in the HFS animals, and there were no differences in relaxation to sodium nitroprusside, suggesting that the endothelial dysfunction is due, at least in part, to nitric oxide deficiency. HFS consumption decreased protein expression of endothelial NOS in aorta, renal, and heart tissues, neuronal NOS in kidney, heart, aorta, and brain, and inducible NOS in heart and aorta. Caveolin-1 and soluble guanylate cyclase protein expression did not change, but AKT protein expression decreased in heart and aorta and increased in kidney tissue. Consumption of HFS diet raised brain carbonyl content and plasma hydrogen peroxide concentration and diminished plasma total antioxidant capacity. Because blood pressure, which is known to eventually rise in this model, was not as yet significantly elevated, the present data suggest that endothelial dysfunction precedes the onset of diet-induced hypertension. The lack of a quantitative change in caveolin-1 and soluble guanylate cyclase protein content indicates that alteration in these proteins is not responsible for the endothelial dysfunction. Thus nitric oxide deficiency combined with antioxidant/oxidant imbalance, appears to be a primary factor in the development of endothelial dysfunction in this model.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2004-08-31", "authors": ["Christian KRoberts", "R JamesBarnard", "Ram KSindhu", "MichaelJurczak", "AshkanEhdaie", "Nosratola DVaziri"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00463.2004"}
