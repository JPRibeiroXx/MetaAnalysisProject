CF was induced in male Wistar albino rats by cumulative dose of sunitinib (300\u00a0mg/kg, given over 4\u00a0weeks as: 25\u00a0mg/kg orally, three times a week), which were co-treated with sacubitril/valsartan (68\u00a0mg/kg/day, orally) for four weeks. Significant elevation in blood pressure, cardiac inflammatory and fibrotic markers besides cardiac dysfunction were observed. These alterations were associated with disruption of TXNIP/TRX system, upregulation of NF-\u03baB/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin/SOX9 pathway along with marked increase in lysyl oxidase (LOX) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expressions and extensive deposition of collagen fibers in cardiac tissues. Luckily, sacubitril/valsartan was able to reverse all of the aforementioned detrimental effects in sunitinib-administered rats. These findings illustrate a potential role of sacubitril/valsartan in alleviating CF and oxidative stress induced by sunitinib via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. These remarkable effects of sacubitril/valsartan were mediated by its ability to improve TXNIP/TRX system and downregulate NF-\u03baB/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin/SOX9 signaling in addition to decreasing LOX and MMP-1 expressions in cardiac tissues. In summary, this study highlights sacubitril/valsartan as a potential therapeutic agent in mitigating CF and oxidative stress especially in cancer cases treated with sunitinib.", "journal": "International immunopharmacology", "date": "2024-04-01", "authors": ["Hoda EMohamad", "Mervat EAskar", "Mohamed AShaheen", "Nourhan MBaraka", "Yasmin KMahmoud"], "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2024.111963"}

We downloaded AF ablation procedural data recorded by the CARTO system from a cloud-based analytical tool (CARTONET) and linked them to individual patient electronic health records. Average impedance drops in anatomical region of right and left pulmonary veins were calculated. Effectiveness was measured by a composite outcome of repeat ablation, AF rehospitalization, direct current cardioversion, or initialization of a new antiarrhythmic drug post-blanking period. The association between impedance drop and 1-year AF recurrence was assessed by logistic regression adjusting for demographics, clinical, and ablation characteristics. Bootstrapping was used to determine the most predictive threshold for impedance drop based on the Youden index.\nAmong 242 patients, 23.6% (n = 57) experienced 1-year AF recurrence. Patients in the lower third vs upper third of average impedance drop had a 5.9-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81-21.8) higher risk of recurrence (37.0% vs 12.5%). The threshold of 7.2 \u03a9 (95% CI 5.75-7.7 \u03a9) impedance drop best predicted AF recurrence, with sensitivity of 0.73 and positive predictive value of 0.33.

The mechanisms by which myocardial injury develops in SLE, however, remain poorly understood. Here we engineered human cardiac tissues and cultured them with IgG fractions containing autoantibodies from SLE patients with and without myocardial involvement. We observed unique binding patterns of IgG from two patient subgroups: (i) patients with severe myocardial inflammation exhibited enhanced binding to apoptotic cells within cardiac tissues subjected to stress, and (ii) patients with systolic dysfunction exhibited enhanced binding to the surfaces of viable cardiomyocytes. Functional assays and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that IgGs from patients with systolic dysfunction exerted direct effects on engineered tissues in the absence of immune cells, altering tissue cellular composition, respiration and calcium handling. Autoantibody target characterization by phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) confirmed distinctive IgG profiles between patient subgroups. By coupling IgG profiling with cell surface protein analyses, we identified four pathogenic autoantibody candidates that may directly alter the function of cells within the myocardium.

{"title": "Chronic sleep fragmentation reduces left ventricular contractile function and alters gene expression related to innate immune response and circadian rhythm in the mouse heart.", "abstract": "Sleep disorders have emerged as a widespread public health concern, primarily due to their association with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Our previous research indicated a potential direct impact of insufficient sleep duration on cardiac remodeling in children and adolescents. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms behind the link between sleep fragmentation (SF) and cardiac abnormalities remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of SF interventions at various life stages on cardiac structure and function, as well as to identify genes associated with SF-induced cardiac dysfunction. To achieve this, we established mouse models of chronic SF and two-week sleep recovery (SR).Our results revealed that chronic SF significantly compromised left ventricular contractile function across different life stages, leading to alterations in cardiac structure and ventricular remodeling, particularly during early life stages. Moreover, microarray analysis of mouse heart tissue identified two significant modules and nine hub genes (Ddx60, Irf9, Oasl2, Rnf213, Cmpk2, Stat2, Parp14, Gbp3, and Herc6) through protein-protein interaction analysis. Notably, the interactome predominantly involved innate immune responses. Importantly, all hub genes lost significance following SR. The second module primarily consisted of circadian clock genes, and real-time PCR validation demonstrated significant upregulation of Arntl, Dbp, and Cry1 after SF, while subsequent SR restored normal Arntl expression. Furthermore, the expression levels of four hub genes (Ddx60, Irf9, Oasl2, and Cmpk2) and three circadian clock genes (Arntl, Dbp, and Cry1) exhibited correlations with structural and functional echocardiographic parameters.Overall, our findings suggest that SF impairs left ventricular contractile function and ventricular remodeling during early life stages, and this may be mediated by modulation of the innate immune response and circadian rhythm. Importantly, our findings suggest that a short period of SR can alleviate the detrimental effects of SF on the cardiac immune response, while the influence of SF on circadian rhythm appears to be more persistent.

In this study, we hypothesized that maternal CuD induced cardiomyopathy and liver injury in offspring through the activation of autophagy. We established a maternal CuD mouse model by feeding pregnant C57BL/6 mice with a CuD diet until the end of the experiment. Echocardiography, histological analysis, western blotting, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed on offspring at postnatal day 14. We found that maternal CuD caused growth retardation and early postnatal death in the offspring. Furthermore, our results revealed that CuD induced cardiac systolic dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, hepatic steatosis, and liver injury. Moreover, higher expression of LC3 and lower expression of p62 were observed in the heart tissues and liver tissues of CuD mice compared with the control group, indicating that CuD induced autophagy activation.

The administration of IAA led to a notable augmentation in heart size and heart-to-body weight ratio, indicating cardiac hypertrophy. Echocardiographic assessments supported these observations, revealing myocardial thickening. Biochemical and gene expression analyses further corroborated the cardiotoxic effects of IAA. Dyslipidemia, increased serum c-Troponin-I levels, decreased SOD and CAT levels, and elevated lipid peroxidation in cardiac tissue were identified.

{"title": "A Comparative Study: Cardioprotective Effects of High-Intensity Interval Training Versus Ischaemic Preconditioning in Rat Myocardial Ischaemia-Reperfusion.", "abstract": "(1) Background: Years of research have identified ischemic preconditioning (IPC) as a crucial endogenous protective mechanism against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, enhancing the myocardial cell's tolerance to subsequent ischemic damage. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is promoted by athletes because it reduces exercise duration and improves metabolic response and cardiopulmonary function. Our objective was to evaluate and compare whether HIIT and IPC could reduce myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats. (2) Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: sham surgery, coronary artery occlusion (CAO), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and ischemic preconditioning (IPC). The CAO, HIIT, and IPC groups experienced 40 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion to induce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Subsequently, the rats were sacrificed, and blood samples along with cardiac tissues were examined. The HIIT group received 4 weeks of training before surgery, and the IPC group underwent preconditioning before the ischemia-reperfusion procedure. (3) Results: The HIIT and IPC interventions significantly reduced the extent of the myocardial infarction size and the levels of serum troponin I and lactate dehydrogenase. Through these two interventions, serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, were significantly decreased, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased. Furthermore, the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins PTEN, caspase-3, TNF-\u03b1, and Bax in the myocardium was reduced, and the expression of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was increased, ultimately reducing cellular apoptosis in the myocardium. In conclusion, both HIIT and IPC demonstrated effective strategies with potential for mitigating myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury for the heart.", "journal": "Life (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2024-03-28", "authors": ["Jia-YuanZhang", "Szu-KaiFu", "Hsia-LingTai", "Kuo-WeiTseng", "Chia-YuTang", "Chia-HsienYu", "Chang-ChiLai"], "doi": "10.3390/life14030310\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehad486\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.02.039\n10.1155/2021/8889123\n10.1126/sciadv.abc4149\n10.4103/CJP.CJP_74_19\n10.1292/jvms.21-0344\n10.1155/2019/3756750\n10.1111/j.1741-3737.2004.00029.x\n10.1016/j.jsams.2009.09.008\n10.2165/11630910-000000000-00000\n10.36660/ijcs.20200244\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.02.045\n10.3389/fendo.2018.00729\n10.1097/00024382-199708000-00003\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00442-X\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00135\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.5\n10.1093/ilar.38.1.41\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.07.162\n10.1016/j.autneu.2013.06.007\n10.1126/science.281.5381.1312\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2012.06.416\n10.1007/s00421-006-0369-4\n10.1186/s12872-019-1090-7\n10.3389/fphys.2021.534127\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.10.065\n10.3390/nu13103483\n10.1080/13813455.2019.1702059\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00957.2011\n10.1196/annals.1341.022\n10.1016/S0005-2728(03)00109-9\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110690\n10.1007/s00109-019-01861-2\n10.1113/EP087994\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2021.02.047\n10.1007/s13105-017-0576-y\n10.1152/ajpendo.00755.2009\n10.1155/2020/4104965\n10.3389/fnmol.2020.00028\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07561\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1275\n10.1002/cbf.3578\n10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105716\n10.3892/mmr.2015.3669\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2022.01.031"}

{"title": "Cardiac tissue model of immune-induced dysfunction reveals the role of free mitochondrial DNA and the therapeutic effects of exosomes.", "abstract": "Despite tremendous progress in the development of mature heart-on-a-chip models, human cell-based models of myocardial inflammation are lacking. Here, we bioengineered a vascularized heart-on-a-chip with circulating immune cells to model severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced acute myocarditis. We observed hallmarks of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-induced myocardial inflammation, as the presence of immune cells augmented the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, triggered progressive impairment of contractile function, and altered intracellular calcium transients. An elevation of circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) was measured first in the heart-on-a-chip and then validated in COVID-19 patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction, demonstrating that mitochondrial damage is an important pathophysiological hallmark of inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction. Leveraging this platform in the context of SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial inflammation, we established that administration of endothelial cell-derived exosomes effectively rescued the contractile deficit, normalized calcium handling, elevated the contraction force, and reduced the ccf-mtDNA and cytokine release via Toll-like receptor-nuclear factor \u03baB signaling axis.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["Rick Xing ZeLu", "NaimehRafatian", "YimuZhao", "Karl TWagner", "Erika LBeroncal", "BoLi", "CarolLee", "JinganChen", "ErynChurcher", "DanielVosoughi", "ChuanLiu", "YingWang", "AndrewBaker", "UrielTrahtemberg", "BowenLi", "AgostinoPierro", "Ana CAndreazza", "Claudia CDos Santos", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.adk0164"}
{"title": "A Revised Definition of Left Bundle Branch Block Using Time to Notch in Lead I.", "abstract": "Current left bundle branch block (LBBB) criteria are based on animal experiments or mathematical models of cardiac tissue conduction and may misclassify patients. Improved criteria would impact referral decisions and device type for cardiac resynchronization therapy.\nTo develop a simple new criterion for LBBB based on electrophysiological studies of human patients, and then to validate this criterion in an independent population.\nIn this diagnostic study, the derivation cohort was from a single-center, prospective study of patients undergoing electrophysiological study from March 2016 through November 2019. The validation cohort was assembled by retrospectively reviewing medical records for patients from the same center who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) from October 2015 through May 2022.\nPatients were classified as having LBBB or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) as assessed by intracardiac recording.\nSensitivity and specificity of the electrocardiography (ECG) criteria assessed in patients with LBBB or IVCD.\nA total of 75 patients (median [IQR] age, 63 [53-70.5] years; 21 [28.0%] female) with baseline LBBB on 12-lead ECG underwent intracardiac recording of the left ventricular septum: 48 demonstrated complete conduction block (CCB) and 27 demonstrated intact Purkinje activation (IPA). Analysis of surface ECGs revealed that late notches in the QRS complexes of lateral leads were associated with CCB (40 of 48 patients [83.3%] with CCB vs 13 of 27 patients [48.1%] with IPA had a notch or slur in lead I; P\u2009=\u2009.003). Receiver operating characteristic curves for all septal and lateral leads were constructed, and lead I displayed the best performance with a time to notch longer than 75 milliseconds. Used in conjunction with the criteria for LBBB from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society, this criterion had a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI, 56%-83%) and specificity of 74% (95% CI, 54%-89%) in the derivation population, contrasting with a sensitivity of 96% (95% CI, 86%-99%) and specificity of 33% (95% CI, 17%-54%) for the Strauss criteria. In an independent validation cohort of 46 patients (median [IQR] age, 78.5 [70-84] years; 21 [45.7%] female) undergoing TAVR with interval development of new LBBB, the time-to-notch criterion demonstrated a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI, 74%-95%). In the subset of 10 patients with preprocedural IVCD, the criterion correctly distinguished IVCD from LBBB in all cases. Application of the Strauss criteria performed similarly in the validation cohort.\nThe findings suggest that time to notch longer than 75 milliseconds in lead I is a simple ECG criterion that, when used in conjunction with standard LBBB criteria, may improve specificity for identifying patients with LBBB from conduction block. This may help inform patient selection for cardiac resynchronization or conduction system pacing.", "journal": "JAMA cardiology", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["Jeremy STreger", "Ahmad BAllaw", "PouyanRazminia", "DipayonRoy", "AmulyaGampa", "SwatiRao", "Andrew DBeaser", "SrinathYeshwant", "ZaidAziz", "CevherOzcan", "Gaurav AUpadhyay"], "doi": "10.1001/jamacardio.2024.0265\n10.1016/S0002-8703(44)90603-4\n10.1001/archinte.1950.00230140032005\n10.1016/0002-8703(65)90368-6\n10.1016/S0735-1097(85)80335-1\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.12.013\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.10.044\n10.1016/0002-9343(56)90204-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.69.5.914\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000118502.91105.F6\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.11.010\n10.1056/NEJMoa032423\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.956011\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.960898\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2019.05.009\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038648\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028352\n10.1007/s12471-022-01697-5\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2023.09.004\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.04.003"}
{"title": "To Repair a Broken Heart: Stem Cells in Ischemic Heart Disease.", "abstract": "Despite improvements in contemporary medical and surgical therapies, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a significant cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality; more specifically, ischemic heart disease (IHD) may affect individuals as young as 20 years old. Typically managed with guideline-directed medical therapy, interventional or surgical methods, the incurred cardiomyocyte loss is not always completely reversible; however, recent research into various stem cell (SC) populations has highlighted their potential for the treatment and perhaps regeneration of injured cardiac tissue, either directly through cellular replacement or indirectly through local paracrine effects. Different stem cell (SC) types have been employed in studies of infarcted myocardium, both in animal models of myocardial infarction (MI) as well as in clinical studies of MI patients, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), Muse cells, multipotent stem cells such as bone marrow-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cardiac stem and progenitor cells (CSC/CPCs). These have been delivered as is, in the form of cell therapies, or have been used to generate tissue-engineered (TE) constructs with variable results. In this text, we sought to perform a narrative review of experimental and clinical studies employing various stem cells (SC) for the treatment of infarcted myocardium within the last two decades, with an emphasis on therapies administered through thoracic incision or through percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), to elucidate possible mechanisms of action and therapeutic effects of such cell therapies when employed in a surgical or interventional manner.", "journal": "Current issues in molecular biology", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["Theodora MStougiannou", "Konstantinos CChristodoulou", "IoannisDimarakis", "DimitriosMikroulis", "DimosKarangelis"], "doi": "10.3390/cimb46030141\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000001052\n10.1038/nrg.2016.160\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.537878\n10.1080/08998280.2022.2083903\n10.1186/s13643-019-1155-9\n10.15420/ecr.2020.48\n10.1007/978-981-15-2517-9_2\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs481\n10.1177/2050312119860401\n10.1016/j.chest.2021.07.111\n10.1097/MD.0000000000016905\n10.1055/s-0042-1744264\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.02.028\n10.1016/j.jacc.2023.04.003\n10.3390/ijms21218118\n10.1038/35025203\n10.1097/RMR.0b013e3181ea2869\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000131513.33892.5b\n10.1016/j.repc.2021.02.011\n10.1016/S0163-7258(02)00236-X\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.11.014\n10.1056/NEJM198610233151702\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.037283\n10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2022.101432\n10.1152/ajpheart.00779.2004\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.305353\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306532\n10.1152/ajpcell.00459.2005\n10.1016/j.mad.2019.111161\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.08.078\n10.1186/s42269-021-00685-w\n10.1161/01.ATV.20.5.1262\n10.1177/2048872612441582\n10.1177/2374289520976639\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.750510\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.011195\n10.1093/cvr/cvu146\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1038/s44161-022-00054-4\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001625\n10.1007/s00395-014-0444-7\n10.1038/nm1613\n10.3390/ijms232314571\n10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2020.02.007\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000001038\n10.1152/ajpheart.00259.2019\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.120.008962\n10.1080/08998280.2023.2296692\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2018.10.002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.1126/science.1077857\n10.1242/dev.129.22.5141\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.06.009\n10.1152/physrev.00005.2017\n10.3389/fphar.2022.945206\n10.1038/s41569-021-00602-8\n10.3390/ijms23010234\n10.1038/s41392-021-00762-6\n10.1016/j.jshs.2020.11.009\n10.2119/molmed.2011.00512\n10.1161/hh1901.096706\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034886\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029343\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024307\n10.1161/01.RES.83.1.1\n10.1016/S0014-5793(02)03477-4\n10.1038/nprot.2014.113\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304564\n10.1016/j.devcel.2022.01.012\n10.3389/fphar.2023.1070973\n10.3389/fcvm.2023.1138485\n10.3389/fcell.2021.636136\n10.1098/rstb.2017.0213\n10.1152/ajpheart.01277.2006\n10.1067/mtc.2003.101\n10.1253/circj.CJ-20-0307\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.040881\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2021.07.016\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311648\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1371/journal.pone.0265347\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2023.12.001\n10.1007/978-1-0716-1484-6_25\n10.1038/labinvest.2017.100\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.05.017\n10.1007/s11886-022-01666-9\n10.3390/cells12131676\n10.1038/s41598-022-22282-1\n10.1517/14728222.2014.851671\n10.1038/nprot.2013.076\n10.1139/cjpp-2023-0202\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.06.012\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2019.10.001\n10.1038/35070587\n10.1161/hc3501.093817\n10.1161/01.cir.0000089040.11131.d4\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn216\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.02.071\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.04.112\n10.1001/jama.2013.282674\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.08.068\n10.1152/ajpheart.01017.2005\n10.1038/nm0405-367\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.186742\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.09.065\n10.1186/s12916-015-0399-z\n10.1002/ejhf.2772\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.001075\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60195-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.304792\n10.1177/0218492314553251\n10.1016/j.arr.2023.101980\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2021.10.030\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0342\n10.1002/ar.a.10137\n10.4252/wjsc.v14.i1.1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312486\n10.1016/j.jsps.2022.06.017\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60608-5\n10.3389/fcvm.2024.1324447\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.981982\n10.1186/s40779-023-00452-0\n10.1002/jcp.29554\n10.1177/09636897241226737\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.000215\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.05.012\n10.1093/cvr/cvad004\n10.1038/srep06716\n10.1371/journal.pone.0201650\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001317\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111425\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2467\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0132\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn017\n10.1038/nm1391\n10.1186/s13287-023-03560-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.003\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01008\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.610364"}
{"title": "Hydrogels for Cardio and Vascular Tissue Repair and Regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death globally, affects the heart and arteries with a variety of clinical manifestations, the most dramatic of which are myocardial infarction (MI), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture. In MI, necrosis of the myocardium, scar formation, and loss of cardiomyocytes result from insufficient blood supply due to coronary artery occlusion. Beyond stenosis, the arteries that are structurally and functionally connected to the cardiac tissue can undergo pathological dilation, i.e., aneurysmal dilation, with high risk of rupture. Aneurysms of the intracranial arteries (IAs) are more commonly seen in young adults, whereas those of the abdominal aorta (AAA) are predominantly seen in the elderly. IAs, unpredictably, can undergo rupture and cause life-threatening hemorrhage, while AAAs can result in rupture, internal bleeding and high mortality rate. In this clinical context, hydrogels, three-dimensional networks of water-seizing polymers, have emerged as promising biomaterials for cardiovascular tissue repair or protection due to their biocompatibility, tunable properties, and ability to encapsulate and release bioactive molecules. This review provides an overview of the current state of research on the use of hydrogels as an innovative platform to promote cardiovascular-specific tissue repair in MI and functional recovery or protection in aneurysmal dilation.", "journal": "Gels (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["IleniaMotta", "MichelinaSoccio", "GiuliaGuidotti", "NadiaLotti", "GianandreaPasquinelli"], "doi": "10.3390/gels10030196\n10.1002/adma.200501612\n10.1016/j.addr.2012.09.010\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2014.11.024\n10.3390/gels3010006\n10.2174/0929867324666170818111630\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03719\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.126611\n10.1007/s10856-019-6318-7\n10.1002/adma.201003963\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.124321\n10.1021/bm200083n\n10.1038/185117a0\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.11.017\n10.1016/j.arabjc.2013.05.026\n10.4172/2329-6631.1000112\n10.1016/S0168-3659(99)00027-9\n10.1007/s11095-008-9801-2\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.01.026\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.03.026\n10.3390/bioengineering6040107\n10.1002/mabi.200600011\n10.1002/1521-3900(200007)157:1<47::AID-MASY47>3.0.CO;2-B\n10.1007/s12033-018-0084-5\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2004.01.044\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.09.064\n10.1111/jam.14290\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2023.11.056\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.1002/mabi.201800079\n10.3390/ijms23052617\n10.1186/s40779-023-00452-0\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.25.2981\n10.15420/ecr.2015:9:3\n10.1007/s11886-017-0876-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.032\n10.12688/f1000research.8237.1\n10.1016/j.coche.2013.01.002\n10.1124/pr.56.4.3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.031\n10.1007/s00380-015-0710-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031635\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.08.031\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.09.080\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000343\n10.1021/acsami.3c04245\n10.1186/1479-5876-10-224\n10.1093/gerona/gls072\n10.18632/aging.100107\n10.1039/C9TB01971E\n10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.08.004\n10.2147/IJN.S81451\n10.1038/nrd4557\n10.1021/acsami.9b12043\n10.1016/0955-2235(89)90012-4\n10.1002/adma.201902900\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.09.005\n10.1039/D1TB01961A\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2023.07.007\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2023.08.020\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121849\n10.1159/000345615\n10.3727/096368909788534915\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000367\n10.1371/journal.pone.0051991\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.12.016\n10.1016/j.nano.2022.102616\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.10.079\n10.1161/JAHA.119.013784\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01344\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.11.011\n10.1002/adhm.202301581\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01409.x\n10.1111/cpr.12942\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.04.139\n10.1021/acsami.8b08659\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2023.07.009\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw304\n10.1039/C9BM00101H\n10.1002/adhm.202304207\n10.1021/acsami.9b01886\n10.1021/acsami.2c16682\n10.1177/0003319717700503\n10.1186/s12883-018-1171-8\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.174526\n10.1016/0741-5214(92)70008-9\n10.1067/mva.1993.42107\n10.1097/01.sla.0000128300.60156.ab\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.04.006\n10.1016/j.jvir.2009.01.005\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.09.021"}

{"title": "Sirtuin 2 Exerts Regulatory Functions on Radiation-Induced Myocardial Fibrosis in Mice by Mediating H3K27 Acetylation of Galectin-3 Promoter.", "abstract": "Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) and galectin-3 have been shown to protect the heart against fibrosis. However, their impacts on radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis (RIMF) remain to be elucidated. To deepen this understanding, the current study sought to explore the effects of SIRT2 and galectin-3 on RIMF and the underlying mechanisms.\nGalectin-3 knockout mice were obtained, and a radiation-induced heart damage (RIHD) mouse model was induced by local radiation exposure to the heart. Lentivirus transfection was then performed, and heart function, fibrosis of heart tissues, and levels of SIRT2, galectin-3, and fibrosis-related markers collagen type-I/-III and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2/MMP9 were respectively assessed by echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining. Additionally, Western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to test H3K27 acetylation levels and the binding of H3K27ac to galectin-3, respectively.\nAfter radiation exposure, heart tissues from the galectin-3 knockout mice had a smaller fibrotic area compared to normal mice, with reduced expression levels of collagen type-I/-III and MMP2/MMP9. SIRT2 was down-regulated and galectin-3 was up-regulated after RIHD treatment. The histone deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol promoted galectin-3 expression and H3K27 acetylation in a time-dependent manner, and increased H3K27ac enrichment in the galectin-3 promoter. Overexpression of SIRT2 down-regulated H3K27ac, collagen type-I/-III, and MMP2/MMP9 expression levels, and reduced the fibrotic area in mouse heart tissues. However, these effects were reversed by the additional overexpression of galectin-3.\nSIRT2 facilitates deacetylation of H3K27 to inhibit galectin-3 transcription, thus ameliorating RIMF in mice.", "journal": "Acta Cardiologica Sinica", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["LiyanChen", "XinyongCai", "LiangShao", "YunxiaWang", "LangHong", "YuliangZhan"], "doi": "10.6515/ACS.202403_40(2).20231026B"}
{"title": "ATP releasing channels and the ameliorative effects of high intensity interval training on diabetic heart: a multifaceted analysis.", "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) can cause severe cardiac complications at functional, histologic and molecular levels. These pathological complications could be mediated by ATP-releasing channels such as Panx1 and ATP receptors, in particular P2X7. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on T2D-induced cardiac complications at the functional, histopathological and molecular levels, with a particular focus on ATP-releasing channels. 48 male Wistar rats at the age of 8 weeks were randomly allocated into four groups: control (Con), Diabetes (T2D), Training (TR), and Diabetes\u2009+\u2009Training (T2D\u2009+\u2009TR). T2D was induced by a high-fat diet plus a low dose (35 mg/kg) of STZ administration. Rats in the TR and T2D\u2009+\u2009TR groups underwent an 8-weeks training program involving intervals ranging from 80 to 100% of their maximum running speed (Vmax), with 4-10 intervals per session. Protein expression of Interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL1\u03b2), Interleukin 10 (IL-10), Pannexin 1 (Panx1), P2X7R (purinergic P2X receptor 7), NLRP1 (NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 1), BAX, and Bcl2 were measured in the heart tissue. Additionally, we assessed heart function, histopathological changes, as well as insulin resistance using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In contrast to the T2D group, HIIT led to increased protein expression of Bcl2 and IL-10 in the heart. It also resulted in improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate,\u2009\u00b1\u2009dp/dt (maximum and minimum changes in left ventricular pressure), while reducing protein expression of IL-1\u03b2, Panx1, P2X7R, NLRP1, and BAX levels in the heart. Furthermore, left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDP) was reduced (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05).

Given this, our study aims to investigate a method for controlling and managing CVDs induced by T2DM in elderly populations. To achieve this, we categorized 40 rats into 5 groups, including HAD (n\u2009=\u20098), HA (n\u2009=\u20098), AD (n\u2009=\u20098), AHT (n\u2009=\u20098), and ADT (n\u2009=\u20098). The exercise protocol consisted of eight weeks of HIIT (three sessions per week) performed at 90-95% of maximal speed. Following cardiac tissue extraction, we assessed the levels of IGF-1, PI3K, and AKT proteins using Western blot technique, and analyzed the histopathological variations of the heart tissue using H&E, Sudan Black, and Masson's trichrome tissue staining. The histological findings from our study demonstrated that T2DM had a significant impact on the development of pathological hypertrophy and fibrosis in the heart tissue of elderly individuals. However, HIIT not only effectively controlled pathological hypertrophy and fibrosis, but also induced physiological hypertrophy in the AHT and ADT groups compared to the HA and AD groups. Results from Sudan Black staining indicated that there was an increase in lipid droplet accumulation in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes and their nuclei in the HA and AD groups, while the accumulation of lipid droplets decreased significantly in the AHT and ADT groups. In both the AHT group and the ADT group, a single HIIT session led to a reduction in collagen fiber accumulation and fibrotic frameworks. Our research also revealed that diabetes caused a significant elevation in the levels of IGF-1, PI3K, and AKT proteins, but after eight weeks of HIIT, the levels of these proteins decreased significantly in the training groups. Overall, our findings suggest that HIIT may be a suitable non-pharmacological approach for improving histological and physiological changes in elderly individuals with T2DM.

Specifically, OVQ-Nanoparticles (OVQ-NPs) with Orientin (Ori), Vitexin (Vit), and Quercetin (Que) was obtained by double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The OVQ-NPs exhibited a spherical shape, with a uniform size distribution of 136.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.88\u00a0nm and a stable \u03b6-potential of -13.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.24\u00a0mV. Notably, these nanoparticles exhibited a favorable sustained-release characteristic, resulting in an extended circulation time within the living organism. Consequently, the administration of these nanoparticles resulted in significant improvements in electrocardiograms and heart mass index of myocardial ischemic rats induced by isoproterenol, as well as decreased serum levels of CK, LDH, and AST. Furthermore, the results of histopathological examination, such as H&E staining and TUNEL staining, confirmed a reduced level of cardiac tissue pathology and apoptosis. Moreover, the quantification of biochemical indicators (SOD, MDA, GSH, NO, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) demonstrated that OVQ-NPs effectively mitigated myocardial ischemia by regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways.

{"title": "Macrophages suppress cardiac reprogramming of fibroblasts in vivo via IFN-mediated intercellular self-stimulating circuit.", "abstract": "Direct conversion of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to cardiomyocytes (CMs) in vivo to regenerate heart tissue is an attractive approach. After myocardial infarction (MI), heart repair proceeds with an inflammation stage initiated by monocytes infiltration of the infarct zone establishing an immune microenvironment. However, whether and how the MI microenvironment influences the reprogramming of CFs remains unclear. Here, we found that in comparison with cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) cultured in vitro, CFs that transplanted into infarct region of MI mouse models resisted to cardiac reprogramming. RNA-seq analysis revealed upregulation of interferon (IFN) response genes in transplanted CFs, and subsequent inhibition of the IFN receptors increased reprogramming efficiency in vivo. Macrophage-secreted IFN-\u03b2 was identified as the dominant upstream signaling factor after MI. CFs treated with macrophage-conditioned medium containing IFN-\u03b2 displayed reduced reprogramming efficiency, while macrophage depletion or blocking the IFN signaling pathway after MI increased reprogramming efficiency in vivo. Co-IP, BiFC and Cut-tag assays showed that phosphorylated STAT1 downstream of IFN signaling in CFs could interact with the reprogramming factor GATA4 and inhibit the GATA4 chromatin occupancy in cardiac genes. Furthermore, upregulation of IFN-IFNAR-p-STAT1 signaling could stimulate CFs secretion of CCL2/7/12 chemokines, subsequently recruiting IFN-\u03b2-secreting macrophages. Together, these immune cells further activate STAT1 phosphorylation, enhancing CCL2/7/12 secretion and immune cell recruitment, ultimately forming a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop between CFs and macrophages via IFN-IFNAR-p-STAT1 that inhibits cardiac reprogramming in vivo. Cumulatively, our findings uncover an intercellular self-stimulating inflammatory circuit as a microenvironmental molecular barrier of in situ cardiac reprogramming that needs to be overcome for regenerative medicine applications.", "journal": "Protein & cell", "date": "2024-03-26", "authors": ["HaoWang", "JunboYang", "YihongCai", "YangZhao"], "doi": "10.1093/procel/pwae013"}

MCP treatment did not change Gal-3 protein levels in the blood and heart, but it did reduce them in the kidneys of the MCP groups compared to the SHAM group. While no morphological changes were evident in the cardiac tissue, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and deregulation of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system were observed in the heart homogenates of the MCP+CIS group. Cisplatin administration caused acute tubular degeneration in the kidneys; the MCP+CIS group also showed increased MDA levels. In conclusion, MCP therapy in the acute model of cisplatin-induced toxicity increases oxidative stress in cardiac and renal tissues. Further investigations are needed to determine the beneficial and harmful roles of Gal-3 in the cardiorenal system since it can act differently in acute and chronic diseases/conditions.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2024-03-25", "authors": ["Diego DSantos", "Nycole MBelote", "Gisela R SSasso", "Rebeca DCorreia-Silva", "Paulo CFranco", "Artur Franciscoda Silva Neto", "Fernanda TBorges", "Lila MOyama", "Cristiane DGil"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2024.153786"}

This highlights its key role in the metabolism of endogenous substrates. Significant scientific interest lies in cardiac CYP2J2 metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA), an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, to regioisomeric bioactive epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) metabolites that show cardioprotective effects including regulation of cardiac electrophysiology. From an in vitro perspective, the accurate characterization of the kinetics of CYP2J2 metabolism of AA including its inhibition and inactivation by drugs could be useful in facilitating in vitro-in vivo extrapolations to predict drug-AA interactions in drug discovery and development. In this review, background information on the structure, regulation and expression of CYP2J2 in human heart is presented alongside AA and EETs as its endogenous substrate and metabolites. The in vitro and in vivo implications of the kinetics of this endogenous metabolic pathway as well as its perturbation via inhibition and inactivation by drugs are elaborated.

Various cardiovascular comorbidities can exacerbate cardiac fibrosis.

Over the past few decades, clinicians have developed therapeutics that can blunt the development and progression of cardiac fibrosis. While these strategies have yielded positive results, overall clinical outcomes for patients suffering from heart failure continue to be dire. Herein, we overview the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cardiac tissue fibrosis.

The fabricated CPs took advantage of intrinsic and additive antioxidant properties in the presence of PANI backbone and ascorbic acid as a biocompatible dopant of PANI. The antioxidant nature of CPs may reduce the serious repercussions of oxidative stress, produced during the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) process following myocardial infarction. The polymerization parameters were considered as Aniline (60 mM, 90 mM, and 120 mM), ascorbic acid concentrations ([aniline]:[ascorbic acid]=3:0, 3:0.5, 3:1, 3:3), and polymerization time (1h and 3h). Mainly, the more aniline concentrations and polymerization time, the less sheet resistance was obtained. 1,1 diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay confirmed the dual antioxidant properties of prepared samples. The advantage of the employed in-situ polymerization was confirmed by the de-doping/re-doping process. Non-desirable groups were excluded based on their electrical conductivity, antioxidant properties, and biocompatibility. The remained groups protected H9c2 cells against oxidative stress and hypoxia conditions.

Changes in cardiac function in each group were examined by echocardiography.\nEmodin significantly inhibited fibroblast proliferation, decreased intracellular ROS levels, significantly upregulated collagen II expression, downregulated \u03b1-SMA expression, and inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation in vitro. Moreover, the in vivo results were consistent with the in vitro. Emodin significantly decreased ROS levels in heart tissue and reduced collagen fibrillogenesis.

To explore the mechanisms by which EndMT affects atrial fibrosis and assess the potential of a Sema3A activator (naringin) to prevent atrial fibrosis by targeting transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2)-induced EndMT, we used human atria, isolated human atrial endocardial endothelial cells (AEECs), and used transgenic mice expressing TGF-\u03b2 specifically in cardiac tissues (TGF-\u03b2 transgenic mice). We evaluated an EndMT marker (Twist), a proliferation marker (proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PCNA), and an endothelial cell (EC) marker (CD31) through triple immunohistochemistry and confirmed that both EndMT and EC proliferation contribute to atrial endocardial fibrosis during AF in TGF-\u03b2 transgenic mice and AF patient tissue sections. Additionally, we investigated the impact of naringin on EndMT and EC proliferation in AEECs and atrial fibroblasts. Naringin exhibited an antiproliferative effect, to which AEECs were more responsive. Subsequently, we downregulated Sema3A in AEECs using small interfering RNA to clarify a correlation between the reduction in Sema3A and the elevation of EndMT markers. Naringin treatment induced the expression of Sema3A and a concurrent decrease in EndMT markers. Furthermore, naringin administration ameliorated AF and endocardial fibrosis in TGF-\u03b2 transgenic mice by stimulating Sema3A expression, inhibiting EndMT markers, reducing atrial fibrosis, and lowering AF vulnerability.

Unfortunately, its chronic use is highly associated with serious abnormal cardiovascular events. The current study was designed to explore the effect of long-term administration of celecoxib on the cardiac tissues of male albino rats. The study also examined the alleged cardioprotective effect of royal jelly.\nThirty, male albino rats were randomly divided into 3 equal groups; 10 each: (1) rats served as the control group and received no drug; (2) rats received celecoxib (50\u00a0mg/kg/day, orally), for 30 consecutive days; (3) rats received celecoxib (50\u00a0mg/kg/day, orally) plus royal jelly (300\u00a0mg/kg/day, orally) for 30 consecutive days. Sera were collected to assay cardiac enzymes and oxidant/antioxidant status. Rats were euthanatized and cardiac tissues were dissected for quantitative estimation of apoptotic genes (Bax) and anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl-2).\nLong-term celecoxib administration caused cardiotoxicity in male albino rats as manifested by significant elevation of serum levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), with ameliorative effects of royal jelly against celecoxib-induced cardiotoxicity as manifested by significantly decrease in serum CPK, CK-MB, and LDH levels.

{"title": "The role of cardiac microenvironment in cardiovascular diseases: implications for therapy.", "abstract": "Due to aging populations and changes in lifestyle, cardiovascular diseases including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, are the leading causes of death worldwide. The heart is a complicated organ composed of multicellular types, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and immune cells. Cellular specialization and complex interplay between different cell types are crucial for the cardiac tissue homeostasis and coordinated function of the heart. Mounting studies have demonstrated that dysfunctional cells and disordered cardiac microenvironment are closely associated with the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we discuss the composition and the homeostasis of cardiac tissues, and focus on the role of cardiac environment and underlying molecular mechanisms in various cardiovascular diseases.

In this study, we performed a multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) of MM, exploring overlapping genetic architecture between traits, to identify novel genetic associations for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).\nWe applied MTAG to genetic variants common to GWAS of 5 genetically correlated MM markers (calcium, phosphorus, FGF23, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)) in European-ancestry subjects. We integrated information from UKBioBank GWAS for blood levels for phosphate, 25(OH)D and calcium (n=366,484), and CHARGE GWAS for PTH (n=29,155) and FGF23 (n=16,624).

{"title": "Interleukin-22 inhibits cardiac fibrosis by regulating fibroblast metabolic reprogramming in myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis, a significant characteristic of cardiovascular diseases, leads to ventricular remodeling and impaired cardiac function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Interleukin-22 (IL-22) in myocardial fibrosis following myocardial infarction (MI) and to explore the underlying metabolic mechanisms. Here we analyzed the single-cell sequencing data and found that the level of aerobic glycolysis was significantly higher in cardiac fibrosis in MI patient, which we validated through in vivo experiments. Utilizing MI mouse model, these experiments revealed decreased serum IL-22 levels and increased levels of AngII and TGF-\u03b21. However, treatment with exogenous IL-22 reversed these changes, reduced infarct size, and fibrosis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that IL-22 inhibited AngII-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) by suppressing the expression of \u03b1-SMA, Cola1, and Cola3. Metabolic analysis indicated that IL-22 decreased the expression of glycolytic enzymes and reduced lactate production in cardiac fibroblasts. Further in vivo experiments confirmed the inhibitory effect of IL-22 on Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) levels in heart tissue. Additionally, IL-22 activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, while inhibition of JNK partially reversed IL-22's effect on PKM2 activity. These findings suggest that IL-22 mitigates cardiac fibrosis and FMT by inhibiting aerobic glycolysis by activating the JNK/PKM2 pathway.

{"title": "Cobalt protoporphyrin promotes heme oxygenase 1 expression and ameliorates cardiac dysfunction in long-term fasting mice.", "abstract": "The association between malnutrition and cardiac dysfunction has been reported. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 played protective roles in the animals functioning as a myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiomyopathy model. We hypothesized that the administration of HO-1 inducer, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) reduces oxidative stress and ameliorates cardiac systolic dysfunction in long-term fasting mice.\nC57BL/6\u00a0J mice were classified into three groups: fed mice (fed group), 48-h fasting mice with a single intraperitoneal injection of the corresponding vehicle (fasting group), and 48-h fasting mice with a single intraperitoneal injection of 5\u00a0mg/kg CoPP (CoPP group).\nThe fasting group showed a significant increase in heme and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) protein in the heart tissue, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) when compared with the fed group. The CoPP group showed significantly increased protein levels of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 and HO-1, and increased mRNA expression levels of HO-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, forkhead box protein O1, sirtuin-1, cyclooxygenase 2, and superoxide dismutase 2, and reduced levels of heme and 4HNE protein when compared with the fasting group. LVEF were significantly higher in the CoPP group than in the fasting group.\nAdministration of CoPP reduced heme accumulation and oxidative stress, and ameliorated cardiac systolic dysfunction in long-term fasting mice. This study suggests that heme accumulation may be associated with impaired cardiac function induced by long-term fasting and that HO-1 may be a key factor or therapeutic target.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2024-03-16", "authors": ["MasayukiShiba", "TakaoKato", "YutaSeko", "EriMinamino-Muta", "YoheiTanada", "TakeshiKimura", "KohOno"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2024.131972"}
{"title": "Implantation of a double allogeneic human engineered tissue graft on damaged heart: insights from the PERISCOPE phase I clinical trial.", "abstract": "In preclinical studies, the use of double allogeneic grafts has shown promising results in promoting tissue revascularization, reducing infarct size, preventing adverse remodelling and fibrosis, and ultimately enhancing cardiac function. Building upon these findings, the safety of PeriCord, an engineered tissue graft consisting of a decellularised pericardial matrix and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stromal cells, was evaluated in the PERISCOPE Phase I clinical trial (NCT03798353), marking its first application in human subjects.\nThis was a double-blind, single-centre trial that enrolled patients with non-acute myocardial infarction eligible for surgical revascularization. Seven patients were implanted with PeriCord while five served as controls.\nPatients who received PeriCord showed no adverse effects during post-operative phase and one-year follow-up. No significant changes in secondary outcomes, such as quality of life or cardiac function, were found in patients who received PeriCord. However, PeriCord did modulate the kinetics of circulating monocytes involved in post-infarction myocardial repair towards non-classical inflammation-resolving macrophages, as well as levels of monocyte chemoattractants and the prognostic marker Meteorin-like in plasma following treatment.\nIn summary, the PeriCord graft has exhibited a safe profile and notable immunomodulatory properties. Nevertheless, further research is required to fully unlock its potential as a platform for managing inflammatory-related pathologies.\nThis work was supported in part by grants from MICINN (SAF2017-84324-C2-1-R); Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ICI19/00039 and Red RICORS-TERAV RD21/0017/0022, and CIBER Cardiovascular CB16/11/00403) as a part of the Plan Nacional de I\u00a0+\u00a0D\u00a0+\u00a0I, and co-funded by ISCIII-Subdirecci\u00f3n General de Evaluaci\u00f3n y el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) and AGAUR (2021-SGR-01437).", "journal": "EBioMedicine", "date": "2024-03-16", "authors": ["AntoniBayes-Genis", "PalomaGastelurrutia", "MartaMongui\u00f3-Tortajada", "Maria LuisaC\u00e1mara", "CristinaPrat-Vidal", "GermanCediel", "LucianoRodr\u00edguez-G\u00f3mez", "AlbertTeis", "ElenaRevuelta-L\u00f3pez", "GemmaFerrer-Curriu", "SantiagoRoura", "CarolinaG\u00e1lvez-Mont\u00f3n", "FelipeBisbal", "JoaquimVives", "AnnaVilarrodona", "ChristianMu\u00f1oz-Guijosa", "SergiQuerol"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ebiom.2024.105060"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of a phytoformulation consisting of hydroxycitric acid and capsaicin against obesity-related cardiomyopathy.\nSprague-Dawley rats were fed HFD for 21 weeks, and phytoformulation (100\u00a0mg/kg body weight) was administered orally for 45 days starting at week 16.\nWe found that HFD supplementation resulted in significant hyperglycemia and caused an increase in cardiac lipid deposition, inflammation and apoptosis in the heart. Phytoformulation therapy not only significantly decreased blood levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and inflammatory cytokines in obese rats, but also protected cardiac tissue, as shown by histological analysis. Conversely, phytoformulation therapy decreased mRNA levels for sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid binding protein 1 genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and absorption in obese rats. It increased the levels of lysosomal acid lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, and lipoprotein lipase genes involved in fatty acid degradation in the heart. In addition, the phytoformulation improved cardiac inflammation and apoptosis by downregulating the genes nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin-6, toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), BCL2-associated X and caspase-3.

{"title": "The combination of bioactive herbal compounds with biomaterials for regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "Regenerative medicine aims to restore the function of diseased or damaged tissues and organs by cell therapy, gene therapy, and tissue engineering, along with the adjunctive application of bioactive molecules. Traditional bioactive molecules such as growth factors and cytokines have shown great potential in regulation of cellular and tissue behavior, but have the disadvantages of limited source, high cost, short half-life, and side effects. In recent years, herbal compounds extracted from natural plants/herbs have gained increasing attention. This is not only because herbal compounds are easily obtained, inexpensive, mostly safe, and reliable, but also owing to their excellent effects including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidative, proangiogenic behavior and ability to promote stem cell differentiation. Such effects also play important roles in the processes related to tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the moieties of the herbal compounds can form physical or chemical bonds with the scaffolds, which contributes to improved mechanical strength and stability of the scaffolds. Thus, the incorporation of herbal compounds as bioactive molecules in biomaterials is a promising direction for future regenerative medicine applications. Herein, an overview on the use of bioactive herbal compounds combined with different biomaterial scaffolds for regenerative medicine application is presented. We firstly introduce the classification, structures, and properties of different herbal bioactive components and then provide a comprehensive survey on the use of bioactive herbal compounds to engineer scaffolds for tissue repair/regeneration of skin, cartilage, bone, neural, and heart tissues.

{"title": "Decoding HiPSC-CM's Response to SARS-CoV-2: mapping the molecular landscape of cardiac injury.", "abstract": "Acute cardiac injury caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases mortality. Acute cardiac injury caused by COVID-19 requires understanding how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly infects cardiomyocytes. This study provides a solid foundation for related studies by using a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) at the transcriptome level, highlighting the relevance of this study to related studies. SARS-CoV-2 infection in hiPSC-CMs has previously been studied by bioinformatics without presenting the full molecular biological process. We present a unique bioinformatics view of the complete molecular biological process of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hiPSC-CMs.\nTo validate the RNA-seq datasets, we used GSE184715 and GSE150392 for the analytical studies, GSE193722 for validation at the cellular level, and GSE169241 for validation in heart tissue samples. GeneCards and MsigDB databases were used to find genes associated with the phenotype. In addition to differential expression analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), we also performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, functional enrichment analysis, hub gene analysis, upstream transcription factor prediction, and drug prediction.\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified into four categories: cardiomyocyte cytoskeletal protein inhibition, proto-oncogene activation and inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and intracellular cytoplasmic physiological function. Each of the hub genes showed good diagnostic prediction, which was well validated in other datasets. Inhibited biological functions included cardiomyocyte cytoskeletal proteins, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and electron transport\u00a0chain (ETC), glucose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle, nucleic acid metabolism, replication, transcription, translation, ubiquitination, autophagy, and cellular transport. Proto-oncogenes, inflammation, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) pathways, and interferon signaling were activated, as well as inflammatory factors. Viral infection activates multiple pathways, including the interferon pathway, proto-oncogenes and mitochondrial oxidative stress, while inhibiting cardiomyocyte backbone proteins and energy metabolism. Infection limits intracellular synthesis and metabolism, as well as the raw materials for mitochondrial energy synthesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction and energy abnormalities are ultimately caused by proto-oncogene activation and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Activation of the interferon pathway, proto-oncogene up-regulation, and mitochondrial oxidative stress cause the inflammatory response and lead to diminished cardiomyocyte contraction. Replication, transcription, translation, ubiquitination, autophagy, and cellular transport are among the functions that decline physiologically.\nSARS-CoV-2 infection in hiPSC-CMs is fundamentally mediated via mitochondrial dysfunction.

In this study, an innovative and user-friendly HoC model is developed to overcome these limitations, by culturing human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial (ECs)- and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), together with human cardiac fibroblasts (FBs), underflow, leading to self-organized miniaturized micro-EHTs (\u00b5EHTs) with a CM-EC interface reminiscent of the physiological capillary lining. \u00b5EHTs cultured under flow display enhanced contractile performance and conduction velocity. In addition, the presence of the EC layer altered drug responses in \u00b5EHT contraction.

{"title": "Curcumin attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity ", "abstract": "Currently, doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the medications commonly used in chemotherapy to treat different types of tumors.Nonetheless, despite being effective in multiple tumors, yet its use is limited owing to its cytotoxic effects, the therapeutic use of DOX has been limited. This work aimed to explore whether curcumin (CMN) can prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Four groups of rats were created, with the first functioning as a control, while the second group received CMN. DOX alone was administered to the third group, whereas CMN and DOX were administered to the fourth group. Lipid peroxidation assessed as Malondialdehyde (MDA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), oxidative stress markers as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and inflammatory markers as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in heart homogenates, each one was assessed. Heart specimens was investigated histologically and ultrastructurally. Increased, AST, and ALT serum levels, increased MDA levels, decreased SOD and CAT levels, and increased TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in heart homogenates were all signs of DOX-induced myocardial injury. Histological and ultrastructural examinations revealed vacuoles and larger, swollen mitochondria in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, DOX caused significant changes in the myocardium, most notably nuclei disintegration, myofibrillar loss, and myocyte vacuolization.

The feasibility of the patch was evaluated in a porcine model by various modalities to assess both the constructive and functional aspects of regeneration.\nA spheroid-based 3D multicellular tissue was created using a 3D net mold system that incorporated cardiomyocytes and embryonic fibroblast cells. The 3D multicellular tissue was incorporated with extracellular matrix sheets and surgically implanted into the right ventricle of a healthy porcine model (n = 4). After 60 days, the implanted patches were evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and electroanatomic mapping studies as well as by post-euthanasia analyses, including measurements of mechanical viscoelasticity.\nCardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed improved regional tissue perfusion in the patch area. Electroanatomic mapping exhibited regenerated electrical conductivity in the patch, as evidenced by relatively preserved voltage regions (1.11 \u00b1 0.8 mV) in comparison to the normal right ventricle (4.7 \u00b1 2.8 mV). Histologic and tissue analyses confirmed repopulation of site-specific host cells, including premature cardiomyocytes and active vasculogenesis.

Here, we report a robust cardiac differentiation protocol that uses Wnt modulation and a stirred suspension bioreactor to produce on average 124 million hiPSC-CMs with >90% purity using a variety of hiPSC lines (19 differentiations; 10 iPSC lines). After controlled freeze and thaw, bioreactor-derived CMs (bCMs) showed high viability (>90%), interbatch reproducibility in cellular morphology, function, drug response and ventricular identity, which was further supported by single cell transcriptomes. bCMs on microcontact printed substrates revealed a higher degree of sarcomere maturation and viability during long-term culture compared to monolayer-derived CMs (mCMs). Moreover, functional investigation of bCMs in 3D engineered heart tissues showed earlier and stronger force production during long-term culture, and robust pacing capture up to 4 Hz when compared to mCMs. bCMs derived from this differentiation protocol will expand the applications of hiPSC-CMs by providing a reproducible, scalable, and resource efficient method to generate cardiac cells with well-characterized structural and functional properties superior to standard mCMs.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2024-03-11", "authors": ["MaksymilianProndzynski", "Raul HBortolin", "PaulBerkson", "Michael ATrembley", "KevinShani", "Mason ESweat", "JoshuaMayourian", "Albert MCordoves", "Nnaemeka JAnyanwu", "YashasviTharani", "JustinCotton", "Joseph BMilosh", "DavidWalker", "YanZhang", "FujianLiu", "XujieLiu", "Kevin KParker", "Vassilios JBezzerides", "William TPu"], "doi": "10.1101/2024.02.24.581789\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.11.010\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz326\n10.1002/sctm.20-0453"}

Mutations in cardiac \u03b1-actin are the cause in 1%-5% of all observed cases. Here, we describe the recombinant production, purification, and characterization of the HCM-linked cardiac \u03b1-actin variants p.A21V and p.D26N. Mass spectrometric analysis of the initially purified recombinant cardiac \u03b1-actin variants and wild-type protein revealed improper N-terminal processing in the Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) insect cell system, compromising the labeling of the protein with fluorescent probes for biochemical studies. Therefore, we produced N-terminal deletion mutants lacking the N-terminal cysteine (\u0394C2). The \u0394C2 wild-type construct behaved similar to porcine cardiac \u03b1-actin purified from native Sus scrofa heart tissue and all \u0394C2 constructs showed improved fluorescent labeling. Further analysis of untruncated and \u0394C2 constructs showed that while neither the A21V nor the D26N mutation affects nucleotide binding, they cause a similar slowing of the rate of filament formation as well as a reduction in the thermal stability of monomeric and filamentous cardiac \u03b1-actin.

However, the upstream transcriptional events that link chronic hypoxia to DNA damage have remained obscure.\nWe sought to determine whether hypoxia signaling mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 or 2 (HIF1A or HIF2A) underlies the proliferation phenotype that is induced by chronic hypoxia.\nWe used genetic loss-of-function models using cardiomyocyte-specific HIF1A and HIF2A gene deletions in chronic hypoxia. We additionally characterized a cardiomyocyte-specific HIF2A overexpression mouse model in normoxia during aging and upon injury. We performed transcriptional profiling with RNA-sequencing on cardiac tissue, from which we verified candidates at the protein level. We find that HIF2A - rather than HIF1A - mediates hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Ectopic, oxygen-insensitive HIF2A expression in cardiomyocytes reveals the cell-autonomous role of HIF2A in cardiomyocyte proliferation. HIF2A overexpression in cardiomyocytes elicits cardiac regeneration and improvement in systolic function after myocardial infarction in adult mice.

{"title": "Upregulated Genes in Atrial Fibrillation Blood and the Left Atrium.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia associated with aging. Many known risk factors are associated with AF, but many senior individuals do not develop AF despite having multiple risk factors. This finding suggests that other factors may be involved in AF onset. This study aimed to identify upregulated genes in the peripheral blood and left atrium of patients with AF. These genes may serve as potential biomarkers to predict AF onset risk and its complications.\nGene expression data was analyzed from blood (n = 3) and left atrial samples (n = 15) of patients with AF and sinus rhythm. We evaluated the significant genes identified using p-value analysis of weighted average difference to confirm their rankings. We created figures for the genes using GeneMANIA and performed a functional analysis using Cytoscape3.10.1. Hub and bottleneck genes were identified based on degree and betweenness centrality. We used RefEx to confirm the organs in which the extracted genes were expressed. Heatmaps and Gene ontology term evaluation were performed to further elucidate the biological functions of the genes.\nWe identified 12 upregulated genes (CAST, ASAH1, MAFB, VCAN, DDIT4, FTL, HEXB, PROS1, BNIP3L, PABPC1, YBX3, and S100A6) in both the blood and left atrium of patients with AF. We analyzed the gene functions using GeneMANIA and Cytoscape. The identified genes were involved in a variety of pathways, including lysosomal function and lipid and sphingolipid catabolism. Next, we investigated whether the 12 identified genes identified were systemically expressed or had high organ specificity. Finally, Reference expression (RefEx) was used to analyze the gene expression levels in various tissues. Four genes; FTL, ASAH1, S100A6, and PABPC1, were highly expressed in the normal heart tissue. Finally, we evaluated the expression levels of the 12 genes in the blood of patients with AF using a heatmap. Our findings suggest that the 12 genes identified in this study, especially the lysosome-related genes (FTL and ASAH1), may be involved in AF pathogenesis.\nLysosome-related genes may be important to understand the AF pathophysiology and to develop AF-related future studies.", "journal": "Cardiology", "date": "2024-03-08", "authors": ["TakahiroKamihara", "TomoyasuKinoshita", "ReoKawano", "SeiyaTanaka", "AyanoToda", "FumiyaOhara", "AkihiroHirashiki", "ManabuKokubo", "AtsuyaShimizu"], "doi": "10.1159/000537923"}

The influence of direct co-culture and CF-derived ECM on CM mechanical function are not fully understood.\nHere we use an engineered culture platform that provides control over ECM geometry and substrate stiffness to evaluate the influence of iPSC-CFs, and the ECM they produce, on the mechanical function of iPSC-CMs. Mechanical analysis was performed using digital image correlation to quantify maximum contractile strain, spontaneous contraction rate, and full-field organization of the contractions.\nWhen cultured alone, iPSC-CFs produce and remodel the ECM into fibers following the underlying 15\u00b0 chevron patterned ECM. The substrates were decellularized and confirmed to have highly aligned fibers that covered a large fraction of the pattern area before reseeding with iPSC-CMs, alone or in co-culture with iPSC-CFs. When seeded on decellularized ECM, larger maximum contractile strains were observed in the co-culture condition compared to the CM Only condition. No significant difference was found in contractile strain between the Matrigel and decellularized ECM conditions; however, the spontaneous contraction rate was lower in the decellularized ECM condition. A methodology for quantifying alignment of cell contraction across the entire field of view was developed based on trajectories approximating the cell displacements during contraction. Trajectory alignment was unaltered by changes in culture or ECM conditions.\nThese combined observations highlight the important role CFs play in vivo and the need for models that enable a quantitative approach to examine interactions between the CFs and CMs, as well as the interactions of these cells with the ECM.", "journal": "Cardiovascular engineering and technology", "date": "2024-03-07", "authors": ["AStempien", "MJosvai", "JNotbohm", "JZhang", "T JKamp", "W CCrone"], "doi": "10.1007/s13239-024-00711-8\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.08.020\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00030-4\n10.1186/1755-1536-5-15\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209809\n10.1161/JAHA.120.019338\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.04.027\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.05.002\n10.21037/jtd.2017.03.122\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.05.004\n10.3389/fmolb.2020.00014\n10.14814/phy2.15045\n10.1089/scd.2009.0255\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs349\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.050\n10.1073/pnas.1311120110\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.042\n10.3390/cells10071716\n10.1073/pnas.0906504107\n10.1002/adfm.201303460\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aad2304\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.025\n10.1155/2012/508294\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.042\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.001\n10.1002/bit.27582\n10.1063/1.5129347\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1038/s41467-019-09831-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0051499\n10.1007/s11340-019-00473-8\n10.1007/s11340-014-9874-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067389\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.001560\n10.1161/01.RES.0000214537.44195.a3\n10.1152/ajpcell.00166.2006\n10.1038/srep42290\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0466\n10.1152/ajpheart.00020.2003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1093/cvr/cvu264\n10.1177/1535370214525323\n10.1155/2016/2936126\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.06.018\n10.1080/14789450.2018.1421947\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301152\n10.7554/eLife.69028\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.873531"}

Phillyrin, derived from the natural plant Forsythia suspensa, has been found to possess cardioprotective properties. The objective of this study is to investigate the role and mechanism of phillyrin in hypertension-induced myocardial remodeling in mice.\nWe constructed a mouse model of salt-sensitive hypertension. The mice were treated with varying doses of phillyrin, and their blood pressure, cardiac function, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and other conditions were assessed.\nOur research findings demonstrated that phillyrin has the potential to lower blood pressure, enhance cardiac function, and mitigate cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammatory responses in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension mice. In hypertensive mice, there was an elevated expression of endothelin1 (ET-1) in heart tissue, which can be reduced by phillyrin. Additionally, phillyrin effectively reduced the hypertrophy of H9c2 cells induced by ET-1 stimulation.\nOur research highlights the therapeutic capabilities of phillyrin in the treatment of myocardial remodeling through the reduction of ET-1 signaling.

H9c2 cells are increasingly being used as an easy-to-culture proxy for some functions of cardiomyocytes. The cryobiology of cardiac cells including H9c2 myoblasts has not been studied as extensively as that of some cell types. Consequently, it is important to characterize the cryobiological response and systematically develop well-optimized cryopreservation protocols for H9c2 cells to have optimal and consistent viability and functionality after thaw for high quality studies with this cell type. In this work, an interrupted slow cooling protocol (graded freezing) was applied to characterize H9c2 response throughout the cooling profile. Important factors that affect the cell response were examined, and final protocols that provided the highest post-thaw viability are reported. One protocol uses the common cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide combined with hydroxyethyl starch, which will be suitable for applications in which the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide is not an issue; and the other protocol uses glycerol as a substitute when there is a desire to avoid dimethyl sulfoxide. Both protocols achieved comparable post-thaw viabilities (higher than 80%) based on SYTO 13/GelRed flow cytometry results. H9c2 cells cryopreserved by either protocol showed ability to differentiate to cardiac myotubes comparable to fresh (unfrozen) H9c2 cells, and their differentiation to cardiac myotubes was confirmed with i) change in cell morphology, ii) expression of cardiac marker troponin I, and iii) increase in mitochondrial mass.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2024-03-06", "authors": ["ElhamAshrafi", "MilicaRadisic", "Janet A WElliott"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0295131\n10.1016/s0828-282x(09)70098-4\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb45420.x\n10.1126/science.168.3934.939\n10.1007/BF00762210\n10.1016/0014-4827(72)90303-5\n10.1136/jcp.29.4.271\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75794-3\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b01276\n10.1085/jgp.47.2.347\n10.1016/S0022-5193(62)80032-0\n10.1016/0006-3002(53)90273-x\n10.1016/0011-2240(77)90177-8\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2011.12.002\n10.1016/0011-2240(77)90175-4\n10.1016/0011-2240(71)90035-6\n10.1016/0011-2240(78)90056-1\n10.1016/0011-2240(71)90132-5\n10.1016/0011-2240(72)90020-X\n10.1093/ilar.41.4.187\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2017.04.004\n10.1016/0011-2240(79)90033-6\n10.1126/science.157.3794.1312\n10.1016/S0006-3495(88)82983-7\n10.1038/srep34393\n10.1016/0011-2240(86)90013-1\n10.1016/0011-2240(90)90025-y\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2009.05.005\n10.1046/j.1537-2995.2002.00242.x\n10.1007/s10561-006-9023-y\n10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02684.x\n10.1038/sj.bmt.1704030\n10.1016/j.transci.2012.01.007\n10.1089/bio.2010.0033\n10.1016/0011-2240(80)90038-3\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.04.016\n10.2739/kurumemedj.48.151\n10.1182/blood.v99.3.850\n10.1097/00007890-200210270-00018\n10.1007/s00277-003-0817-8\n10.1089/scd.1.1998.7.385\n10.1182/blood.V57.3.592.592\n10.1292/jvms.70.1211\n10.1046/j.1537-2995.1978.18679077950.x\n10.1016/0011-2240(80)90002-4\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2016.11.004\n10.1016/j.nbd.2008.11.006\n10.1038/164666a0\n10.1016/s0140-6736(50)91861-7\n10.1038/1831394a0\n10.1016/S0034-5288(18)34429-1\n10.15407/cryo29.03.199\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2020.05.010\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2023.104551\n10.1016/0011-2240(76)90140-1\n10.1016/s0011-2240(68)80116-6\n10.1067/mtc.2001.111418\n10.1177/1933719110385130\n10.1007/978-3-319-45457-3_10\n10.1016/j.scr.2019.101698\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.11.010\n10.1161/01.res.69.6.1476\n10.1016/0014-4827(76)90447-x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0129303\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1983.tb47330.x\n10.1182/blood.V70.4.974.974\n10.1016/0011-2240(83)90054-8\n10.1371/journal.pone.0249814\n10.1016/s0012-1606(70)80004-5\n10.1016/S0022-5320(64)80074-5\n10.1074/jbc.274.41.29063\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)89483-8\n10.1126/science.8493528\n10.1016/j.mito.2010.12.007\n10.1007/s12012-011-9112-4\n10.1002/jcp.27597\n10.1080/15216540216037\n10.1134/S0006297913130063\n10.1016/B978-0-12-407821-5.00008-5\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.08.005\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2009.07.011\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2017.04.012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0263005\n10.1152/ajpcell.1984.247.3.C125\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.11.007\n10.1021/bp00024a017\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2009.09.007\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2010.04.005\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2015.08.004\n10.1016/0011-2240(87)90003-4\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2016.05.005\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2018.10.001\n10.1007/978-1-0716-0783-1_30\n10.1038/s41598-019-39957-x\n10.1074/jbc.M112377200\n10.1038/nature01780\n10.1073/pnas.0408882102\n10.1101/2023.02.03.526715\n10.1007/s11626-010-9368-1"}

{"title": "Vector Field Heterogeneity for the Assessment of Locally Disorganised Cardiac Electrical Propagation Wavefronts From High-Density Multielectrodes.", "abstract": "High-density multielectrode catheters are becoming increasingly popular in cardiac electrophysiology for advanced characterisation of the cardiac tissue, due to their potential to identify impaired sites. These are often characterised by abnormal electrical conduction, which may cause locally disorganised propagation wavefronts. To quantify it, a novel heterogeneity parameter based on vector field analysis is proposed, utilising finite differences to measure direction changes between adjacent cliques. The proposed Vector Field Heterogeneity metric has been evaluated on a set of simulations with controlled levels of organisation in vector maps, and a variety of grid sizes.

Exosomes (Ex) derived from mesenchymal cells could be a promising therapeutic for various heart diseases. This study investigated the role of Ex in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and its mechanistic insights, using Sacubitril/valsartan (S/V) as a reference drug widely recommended in heart failure management. The study involved 24 Wistar rats, divided into a control, Dox, Dox\u2009+\u2009S/V, and Dox\u2009+\u2009Ex groups. The rats were assessed for cardiac enzymes, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Immunohistochemical expression of caspase-1, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NrF2), E-Cadherin, CD117/c-kit, and Platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 (PDGF\u03b1) was evaluated. P53 and Annexin V were assessed by PCR. Histological examination was performed using hematoxylin and eosin and Sirius red stains. Ex ameliorated the adverse cardiac pathological changes and significantly decreased the cardiac enzymes and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Ex also exerted antifibrotic and antiapoptotic effect in heart tissue. Ex treatment also improved NrF2 immunohistochemistry, up-regulated E-Cadherin immune expression, and restored the telocyte markers CD117/c-kit and PDGF\u03b1. Ex can mitigate Dox-induced cardiotoxicity by acting as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic agents, restoring telocytes and modulating epithelial mesenchymal transition. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Exosomes exhibit positive expression for CD90 and CD105 whereas showing -ve expression for CD 34 by flow cytometry. Exosomes restore the immunohistochemical expression of the telocytes markers CD117/c-kit and PDGF\u03b1.

However, multiple dysregulated mechanisms that interact with each other and are involved in the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension may not be affected, contributing to the remaining cardiovascular risk. Using an exercise training protocol, we investigated whether adding both approaches to arterial hypertension management could promote higher modulation of regulatory mechanisms of BP in postmenopausal rats.\nSpontaneously hypertensive rats were allocated into sedentary (S) and ovariectomized groups: sedentary (OS), sedentary treated with enalapril maleate (OSE) and trained treated with enalapril maleate (OTE). Both the pharmacological and exercise training protocols lasted for 8\u200aweeks. The BP was directly recorded. Inflammation and oxidative stress were evaluated in the cardiac tissue.\nAlthough BP reduction was similar between OSE and OTE, trained group showed lower vasopressor systems outflow after sympathetic ganglion blocking by hexamethonium (mean BP) (OTE: -53.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.86 vs. OS: -75.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a19.2\u200ammHg).

However, current treatment methods have some limitations, including low stem cell engraftment and poor therapeutic effects. Furthermore, these methods cause secondary damage to heart due to injection and suturing to immobilize them in the heart, inducing side effects. In this study, we developed stem cell spheroid-laden 3-dimensional (3D) patches (S_3DP) with biosealant to treat MI. This 3D patch has dual modules, such as open pockets to directly deliver the spheroids with their paracrine effects and closed pockets to improve the engraft rate by protecting the spheroid from harsh microenvironments. The spheroids formed within S_3DP showed increased viability and expression of angiogenic factors compared to 2-dimensional cultured cells. We also fabricated gelatin-based tissue adhesive biosealants via a thiol-ene reaction and disulfide bond formation. This biosealant showed stronger tissue adhesiveness than commercial fibrin glue. Furthermore, we successfully applied S_3DP using a biosealant in a rat MI model without suturing in\u00a0vivo, thereby improving cardiac function and reducing heart fibrosis. In summary, S_3DP and biosealant have excellent potential as advanced stem cell therapies with a sutureless approach to MI treatment.", "journal": "Biomaterials research", "date": "2024-03-05", "authors": ["Hye RanJeon", "Jeon IlKang", "Suk HoBhang", "Kyung MinPark", "Dong-IkKim"], "doi": "10.34133/bmr.0007"}

Sex-specific analyses were conducted to potentially elucidate different pathways between the sexes.\nWe performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of RHR (n=550,467) using two independent study populations, The Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT) and the UK Biobank (UKB), comprising 69,155 and 481,312 participants, respectively. We also developed a genome-wide PRS for RHR using UKB and tested for association between the PRS and 13 disease outcomes in HUNT.\nWe identified 403, 253, and 167 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with RHR in the total population, women, and men, respectively. The sex-specified analyses indicated differences in the genetic contribution to RHR and revealed loci significantly associated with RHR in only one of the sexes. The SNPs were mapped to genes enriched in heart tissue and cardiac conduction pathways, as well as disease-pathways, including dilated cardiomyopathy. The PRS for RHR was associated with increased risk of hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy, and decreased risk of atrial fibrillation.\nOur findings provide insight into the pleiotropic effects of the RHR variants, contributing towards an improved understanding of mechanisms linking RHR and disease.

SIRT6 is a\u00a0nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent enzyme that plays a vital role in cardiac protection against various stresses. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that FSTL1 could alleviate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting autophagy. The present study investigated the probable mechanisms of FSTL1 on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. We confirmed that FSTL1 exerted a pivotal protective role on cardiac tissue in vivo and on doxorubicin-induced cell injury in vitro. Furthermore, FSTL1 can alleviate doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting autophagy and apoptosis. Further studies demonstrated that FSTL1 can activate SIRT6 signaling by restoring the SIRT6 protein expression in doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury. SIRT6 activation elevated the protein expression of Nrf2 in doxorubicin-induced H9C2 injury. Treatment with the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 partially antagonized the cardioprotective role of SIRT6 on doxorubicin-induced autophagy or apoptosis.

{"title": "Characterization of cardiac fibroblast-extracellular matrix crosstalk across developmental ages provides insight into age-related changes in cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Heart failure afflicts an estimated 6.5 million people in the United States, driven largely by incidents of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD leads to heart failure due to the inability of adult myocardial tissue to regenerate after myocardial infarction (MI). Instead, immune cells and resident cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), the cells responsible for the maintenance of the cardiac extracellular matrix (cECM), drive an inflammatory wound healing response, which leads to fibrotic scar tissue. However, fibrosis is reduced in fetal and early (<1-week-old) neonatal mammals, which exhibit a transient capability for regenerative tissue remodeling. Recent work by our laboratory and others suggests this is in part due to compositional differences in the cECM and functional differences in CFs with respect to developmental age. Specifically, fetal cECM and CFs appear to mitigate functional loss in MI models and engineered cardiac tissues, compared to adult CFs and cECM. We conducted 2D studies of CFs on solubilized fetal and adult cECM to investigate whether these age-specific functional differences are synergistic with respect to their impact on CF phenotype and, therefore, cardiac wound healing. We found that the CF migration rate and stiffness vary with respect to cell and cECM developmental age and that CF transition to a fibrotic phenotype can be partially attenuated in the fetal cECM. However, this effect was not observed when cells were treated with cytokine TGF-\u03b21, suggesting that inflammatory signaling factors are the dominant driver of the fibroblast phenotype. This information may be valuable for targeted therapies aimed at modifying the CF wound healing response and is broadly applicable to age-related studies of cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2024-03-04", "authors": ["Luke RPerreault", "Mark CDaley", "Matthew CWatson", "SagarRastogi", "AjithJaiganesh", "Elizabeth CPorter", "Breanna MDuffy", "Lauren DBlack"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2024.1279932\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2021.08.069\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2010.07.003\n10.3791/3251-v\n10.1016/j.matbio.2017.12.003\n10.1016/j.trim.2003.12.016\n10.3109/08977194.2011.595714\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.1040233\n10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.45.120403.095802\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.08.003\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.08.020\n10.1242/jcs.94.3.577\n10.1177/1535370218761628\n10.1096/fj.07-087627\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2022.119329\n10.1016/0022-2828(95)90067-5\n10.1023/a:1004490230078\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.037\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.09.007\n10.1038/nprot.2008.142\n10.1038/s41598-023-39369-y\n10.1007/s11886-022-01647-y\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.6.H3020\n10.18632/aging.100526\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307017\n10.3390/jcm6050053\n10.1007/s11926-009-0017-1\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000105723.91637.1C\n10.1006/exer.2002.2066\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.07.007\n10.3791/51046\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.982777\n10.1172/JCI94753\n10.1038/s41598-019-49285-9\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.04.027\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.11.029\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035144\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.12.027\n10.1042/bj2760307\n10.1152/ajpheart.00881.2005\n10.1242/jcs.115.17.3355\n10.1016/j.matbio.2018.01.019\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00074.2021\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.3389/fmolb.2023.1228232\n10.1016/j.matbio.2022.03.007\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.11.015\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209809\n10.1002/jbm.a.35850\n10.1016/j.jbc.2023.104694\n10.1186/s12967-015-0510-4\n10.1161/01.res.68.3.734\n10.1038/s41551-021-00709-w\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.062\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.08.037\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.10.004\n10.1016/s0735-1097(01)01665-5"}

{"title": "Nonclinical evaluation of chronic cardiac contractility modulation on 3D human engineered cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is a medical device-based therapy delivering non-excitatory electrical stimulations to the heart to enhance cardiac function in heart failure (HF) patients. The lack of human in vitro tools to assess CCM hinders our understanding of CCM mechanisms of action. Here, we introduce a novel chronic (i.e., 2-day) in vitro CCM\u00a0assay to evaluate the effects of CCM in a human 3D microphysiological system consisting of engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs).\nCryopreserved human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were used to generate 3D ECTs. The ECTs were cultured, incorporating human primary ventricular cardiac fibroblasts and a fibrin-based gel. Electrical stimulation was applied using two separate pulse generators for the CCM group and control group. Contractile properties and intracellular calcium were measured, and a cardiac gene quantitative PCR screen was conducted.\nChronic CCM increased contraction amplitude and duration, enhanced intracellular calcium transient amplitude, and altered gene expression related to HF (i.e., natriuretic peptide B, NPPB) and excitation-contraction coupling (i.e., sodium-calcium exchanger, SLC8).\nThese data represent the first study of chronic CCM in a 3D ECT model, providing a nonclinical tool to assess the effects of cardiac electrophysiology medical device signals complementing in vivo animal studies. The methodology established a standardized 3D ECT-based in vitro testbed for chronic CCM, allowing evaluation of physiological and molecular effects on human cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2024-03-04", "authors": ["Tromondae KFeaster", "Jourdan KEwoldt", "AnnaAvila", "MauraCasciola", "AkshayNarkar", "Christopher SChen", "KseniaBlinova"], "doi": "10.1111/jce.16222"}

Ursolic acid (UA) is known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. However, its impact on cancer cachexia remains unexplored. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of UA in addressing muscle atrophy and organ dysfunction in cancer cachexia and reveal the mechanisms involved. UA dose-dependently ameliorated C2C12 myotube atrophy. Mechanistically, it inhibited the expression of muscle-specific RING finger containing protein 1 (MURF1) and the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and upregulated the mRNA or protein levels of myogenic differentiation antigen and myogenin in cultured C2C12 myotubes treated with conditioned medium. In vivo, UA protected CT26 tumor-bearing mice against loss of body weight, as well as increased skeletal muscle and epididymal fat without affecting tumor growth. Additionally, UA increased food intake in CT26 tumor-bearing mice. The mRNA expression of tumor necrosis-\u03b1 and interleukin 6 was significantly downregulated in the intestine, gastrocnemius, and heart tissues following 38\u00a0d UA administration. UA treatment reversed the levels of myocardial function indicators, including creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, car-dial troponin T, and glutathione. Finally, UA treatment significantly inhibited the expression of MURF1, the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa-B p65, and STAT3 in the gastrocnemius muscle and heart tissues of cachexic mice.

However, its clinical application is limited by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Recent findings demonstrated that autophagy inhibition and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by oxidative stress dominate the pathophysiology of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), however, there are no potential molecules targeting on these.\nThis study aimed to explore whether aucubin (AU) acting on inimitable crosstalk between NRF2 and HIPK2 mediated the autophagy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in DIC, and provide a new and alternative strategy for the treatment of DIC.\nWe first demonstrated the protection of AU on cardiac structure and function in DIC mice manifested by increased EF and FS values, decreased serum CK-MB and LDH contents and well-aligned cardiac tissue in HE staining. Furthermore, AU alleviated DOX-induced myocardial oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and autophagy flux dysregulation in mice, as measured by decreased ROS, 8-OHdG, and TUNEL-positive cells in myocardial tissue, increased SOD and decreased MDA in serum, aligned mitochondria with reduced vacuoles, and increased autophagosomes. In vitro, AU alleviated DOX-induced oxidative stress, autophagy inhibition, and apoptosis by promoting NRF2 and HIPK2 expression. We also identified crosstalk between NRF2 and HIPK2 in DIC as documented by overexpression of NRF2 or HIPK2 reversed cellular oxidative stress, autophagy blocking, and apoptosis aggravated by HIPK2 or NRF2 siRNA, respectively. Simultaneously, AU promoted the expression and nuclear localization of NRF2 protein, which was reversed by HIPK2 siRNA, and AU raised the expression of HIPK2 protein as well, which was reversed by NRF2 siRNA. Crucially, AU did not affect the antitumor activity of DOX against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells, which made up for the shortcomings of previous anti-DIC drugs.\nThese collective results innovatively documented that AU regulated the unique crosstalk between NRF2 and HIPK2 to coordinate oxidative stress, autophagy, and apoptosis against DIC without compromising the anti-tumor effect of DOX in vitro.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2024-03-01", "authors": ["WeiliLi", "JingCao", "YawenZhang", "GuanjingLing", "NannanTan", "YanWei", "YuqinZhang", "XiaopingWang", "WeinaQian", "JinchiJiang", "JingmeiZhang", "WeiWang", "YongWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2024.155473"}

{"title": "Genome-wide enhancer-associated tandem repeats are expanded in cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous heart condition that can lead to heart failure and sudden cardiac death in childhood. While it has a strong genetic basis, the genetic aetiology for over 50% of cardiomyopathy cases remains unknown.\nIn this study, we analyse the characteristics of tandem repeats from genome sequence data of unrelated individuals diagnosed with cardiomyopathy from Canada and the United Kingdom (n\u00a0=\u00a01216) and compare them to those found in the general population. We perform burden analysis to identify genomic and epigenomic features that are impacted by rare tandem repeat expansions (TREs), and enrichment analysis to identify functional pathways that are involved in the TRE-associated genes in cardiomyopathy. We use Oxford Nanopore targeted long-read sequencing to validate repeat size and methylation status of one of the most recurrent TREs. We also compare the TRE-associated genes to those that are dysregulated in the heart tissues of individuals with cardiomyopathy.\nWe demonstrate that tandem repeats that are rarely expanded in the general population are predominantly expanded in cardiomyopathy. We find that rare TREs are disproportionately present in constrained genes near transcriptional start sites, have high GC content, and frequently overlap active enhancer H3K27ac marks, where expansion-related DNA methylation may reduce gene expression. We demonstrate the gene silencing effect of expanded CGG tandem repeats in DIP2B through promoter hypermethylation. We show that the enhancer-associated loci are found in genes that are highly expressed in human cardiomyocytes and are differentially expressed in the left ventricle of the heart in individuals with cardiomyopathy.\nOur findings highlight the underrecognized contribution of rare tandem repeat expansions to the risk of cardiomyopathy and suggest that rare TREs contribute to \u223c4% of cardiomyopathy risk.\nGovernment of Ontario (RKCY), The Canadian Institutes of Health Research PJT 175329 (RKCY), The Azrieli Foundation (RKCY), SickKids Catalyst Scholar in Genetics (RKCY), The University of Toronto McLaughlin Centre (RKCY, SM), Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research (SM), Data Sciences Institute at the University of Toronto (SM), The Canadian Institutes of Health Research PJT 175034 (SM), The Canadian Institutes of Health Research ENP 161429 under the frame of ERA PerMed (SM, RL), Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario & Robert M Freedom Chair in Cardiovascular Science (SM), Bitove Family Professorship of Adult Congenital Heart Disease (EO), Canada Foundation for Innovation (SWS, JR), Canada Research Chair (PS), Genome Canada (PS, JR), The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (PS).", "journal": "EBioMedicine", "date": "2024-02-29", "authors": ["AleksandraMitina", "MahreenKhan", "RobertLesurf", "YueYin", "WorrawatEngchuan", "OmarHamdan", "GiovannaPellecchia", "BrettTrost", "IanBackstrom", "KeyiGuo", "Linda MPallotto", "Phoenix HoiLam Doong", "ZhuozhiWang", "ThomasNalpathamkalam", "BhoomaThiruvahindrapuram", "TanyaPapaz", "Christopher EPearson", "JiannisRagoussis", "PadmajaSubbarao", "Meghan BAzad", "Stuart ETurvey", "PiushkumarMandhane", "Theo JMoraes", "ElinorSimons", "Stephen WScherer", "JaneLougheed", "TapasMondal", "JohnSmythe", "LuisAltamirano-Diaz", "ErwinOechslin", "SeemaMital", "Ryan K CYuen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ebiom.2024.105027\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001666\n10.7554/eLife.35788\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003118\n10.3390/ijms21093040\n10.3390/ijms21218223"}

Diannexin is a homodimer of recombinant human annexin V and elicits important roles in several I/R injuries. Nevertheless, its function in MI/R remains elusive. Here, Diannexin alleviated simulated I/R (SI/R)-induced cardiomyocyte death and oxidative injury by increasing cell viability and inhibiting cell apoptosis, ROS, lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde production and anti-oxidative SOD activity. Diannexin inhibited SI/R-induced expression of fibrotic protein collagen I and collagen III. Furthermore, Diannexin suppressed LPS-induced macrophage polarization towards pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype and enhanced IL-4-evoked anti-inflammatory M2 polarization. Concomitantly, Diannexin inhibited SI/R exposure-induced macrophage polarization to M1 subtypes. Importantly, conditioned medium (CM) from SI/R-stimulated macrophages evoked cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which was reversed when cells were co-cultured with CM from Diannexin-treated macrophages under SI/R conditions. Mechanically, the activation of TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in SI/R-treated cells was mitigated by Diannexin. Reactivating this pathway antagonized the protective effects of Diannexin on SI/R-induced cardiomyocyte oxidative injury, fibrotic protein expression and macrophage polarization and M1 macrophage-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In vivo, Diannexin alleviated abnormal cardiac structure, dysfunction and collagen position in MI/R mice. Additionally, Diannexin reduced M1-polarized and elevated M2-polarized macrophages in heart tissues at five days post-MI/R. The activation of TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in MI/R mice was attenuated after Diannexin administration.

{"title": "Protective Effect of CD137 Deficiency against Post-infarction Cardiac Fibrosis and Adverse Cardiac Remodeling via ERK1/2 Signaling Pathways.", "abstract": "Myocardial fibrosis, a common complication of myocardial infarction (MI), is characterized by excessive collagen deposition and can result in impaired cardiac function. The specific role of CD137 in the development of post-MI myocardial fibrosis remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate the effects of CD137 signaling using CD137 knockout mice and in vitro experiments. CD137 expression levels progressively increased in the heart following MI, particularly in myofibroblast, which play a key role in fibrosis. Remarkably, CD137 knockout mice exhibited improved cardiac function and reduced fibrosis compared to wild-type mice at day 28 post-MI. The use of Masson's trichrome and picrosirius red staining demonstrated a reduction in the infarct area and collagen volume fraction in CD137 knockout mice. Furthermore, the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen I, key markers of fibrosis, was decreased in heart tissues lacking CD137. In vitro experiments supported these findings, as CD137 depletion attenuated cardiac fibroblast differentiation, and migration, and collagen I synthesis. Additionally, the administration of CD137L recombinant protein further promoted \u03b1-SMA expression and collagen I synthesis, suggesting a pro-fibrotic effect. Notably, the application of an inhibitor targeting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway attenuated the pro-fibrotic effects of CD137L.

{"title": "Coordinated metabolic responses to cyclophilin D deletion in the developing heart.", "abstract": "In the embryonic heart, the activation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) coincides with the closure of the cyclophilin D (CypD) regulated mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). However, it remains to be established whether the absence of CypD has a regulatory effect on mitochondria during cardiac development. Using a variety of assays to analyze cardiac tissue from wildtype and CypD knockout mice from embryonic day (E)9.5 to adult, we found that mitochondrial structure, function, and metabolism show distinct transitions. Deletion of CypD altered the timing of these transitions as the mPTP was closed at all ages, leading to coupled ETC activity in the early embryo, decreased citrate synthase activity, and an altered metabolome particularly after birth. Our results suggest that manipulating CypD activity may control myocyte proliferation and differentiation and could be a tool to increase ATP production and cardiac function in immature hearts.", "journal": "iScience", "date": "2024-02-28", "authors": ["GiselaBeutner", "Jonathan RyanBurris", "Michael PCollins", "Chaitanya AKulkarni", "Sergiy MNadtochiy", "Karen Lde Mesy Bentley", "Ethan DCohen", "Paul SBrookes", "George APorter"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isci.2024.109157\n10.1016/j.ppedcard.2011.02.002\n10.1111/febs.15146\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.08.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0113330\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00959\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.032\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311349\n10.1007/s00246-016-1464-x\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1001666\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.06.013\n10.1126/science.aad2459\n10.1038/ng.3870\n10.1016/j.stem.2022.03.003\n10.1073/pnas.1401591111\n10.1038/s41418-023-01187-0\n10.1038/s41580-021-00433-y\n10.3791/55738\n10.1038/pr.2017.19\n10.3390/biom8040176\n10.1038/s41421-022-00447-6\n10.1159/000145293\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.06.007\n10.1161/JAHA.118.010378\n10.1016/j.devcel.2023.04.011\n10.1016/0002-8703(89)90801-6\n10.1006/jmcc.1994.1123\n10.1023/a:1007031919298\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.230185\n10.1038/s41598-020-74718-1\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.06.023\n10.1016/0012-1606(77)90358-x\n10.1038/s41467-019-13668-3\n10.1038/s41586-022-04557-9\n10.1016/0065-2571(88)90026-x\n10.1038/s41418-018-0157-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.016\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.017\n10.1016/j.diff.2017.04.001\n10.1038/cr.2011.195\n10.1038/s41586-023-06068-7\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.11.009\n10.1172/JCI43171\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.12.004\n10.1038/s41598-017-14795-x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301867\n10.1016/j.molcel.2015.08.009\n10.3389/fnins.2023.1231584\n10.1038/s41467-021-24869-0\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.104\n10.1371/journal.pone.0083214\n10.1016/S0091-679X(06)80004-X\n10.1038/nprot.2012.058\n10.1007/978-1-0716-1266-8_7\n10.1007/s11357-021-00388-0\n10.7554/eLife.58573\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.09.008\n10.1093/bib/bbp059"}

{"title": "Palm-based tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) supplementation modulates cardiac sod1 expression, fxr target gene expression, and tauro-conjugated bile acid levels in aleptinemic mice fed a high-fat diet.", "abstract": "Tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) has been reported to protect the heart from oxidative stress-induced inflammation. It is, however, unclear whether the protective effects of TRF against oxidative stress involve the activation of farnesoid X receptor (fxr), a bile acid receptor, and the regulation of bile acid metabolites. In the current study, we investigated the effects of TRF supplementation on antioxidant activities, expression of fxr and its target genes in cardiac tissue, and serum untargeted metabolomics of high-fat diet-fed mice. Mice were divided into high-fat diet (HFD) with or without TRF supplementation (control) for 6\u00a0weeks. At the end of the intervention, body\u00a0weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), and random blood glucose were measured. Heart tissues were collected, and the gene expression of sod1, sod2, gpx, and fxr and its target genes shp and stat3 was determined. Serum was subjected to untargeted metabolomic analysis using UHPLC-Orbitrap. In comparison to the control, the WC of the TRF-treated group was higher (p\u2009>0.05) than that of the HFD-only group, in addition there was no significant difference in weight or random blood glucose level. Downregulation of sod1, sod2, and gpx expression was observed in TRF-treated mice; however, only sod1 was significant when compared to the HFD only group. The expression of cardiac shp\u00a0(fxr target gene) was significantly upregulated, but stat3 was significantly downregulated in the TRF-treated group compared to the HFD-only group. Biochemical pathways found to be influenced by TRF supplementation include bile acid secretion, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and biotin and cholesterol metabolism. In conclusion, TRF supplementation in HFD-fed mice affects antioxidant activities, and more interestingly, TRF also acts as a signaling molecule that is possibly involved in several bile acid-related biochemical pathways accompanied by an increase in cardiac fxr shp expression.

Here, we show that inhibiting HDAC6 with TYA-018 effectively reverses established heart failure and its associated symptoms in male HFpEF mouse models. Additionally, in male mice lacking Hdac6 gene, HFpEF progression is delayed and they are resistant to TYA-018's effects. The efficacy of TYA-018 is comparable to a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and the combination shows enhanced effects. Mechanistically, TYA-018 restores gene expression related to hypertrophy, fibrosis, and mitochondrial energy production in HFpEF heart tissues. Furthermore, TYA-018 also inhibits activation of human cardiac fibroblasts and enhances mitochondrial respiratory capacity in cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "RGS6 drives cardiomyocyte death following nucleolar stress by suppressing Nucleolin/miRNA-21.", "abstract": "Prior evidence demonstrated that Regulator of G protein Signaling 6 (RGS6) translocates to the nucleolus in response to cytotoxic stress though the functional significance of this phenomenon remains unknown.\nUtilizing in vivo gene manipulations in mice, primary murine cardiac cells, human cell lines and human patient samples we dissect the participation of a RGS6-nucleolin complex in chemotherapy-dependent cardiotoxicity.\nHere we demonstrate that RGS6 binds to a key nucleolar protein, Nucleolin, and controls its expression and activity in cardiomyocytes. In the human myocyte AC-16 cell line, induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, primary murine cardiomyocytes, and the intact murine myocardium tuning RGS6 levels via overexpression or knockdown resulted in diametrically opposed impacts on Nucleolin mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation.RGS6 depletion provided marked protection against nucleolar stress-mediated cell death in vitro, and, conversely, RGS6 overexpression suppressed ribosomal RNA production, a key output of the nucleolus, and triggered death of myocytes. Importantly, overexpression of either Nucleolin or Nucleolin effector miRNA-21 counteracted the pro-apoptotic effects of RGS6. In both human and murine heart tissue, exposure to the genotoxic stressor doxorubicin was associated with an increase in the ratio of RGS6/Nucleolin. Preventing RGS6 induction via introduction of RGS6-directed shRNA via intracardiac injection proved cardioprotective in mice and was accompanied by restored Nucleolin/miRNA-21 expression, decreased nucleolar stress, and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic, hypertrophy, and oxidative stress markers in heart.\nTogether, these data implicate RGS6 as a driver of nucleolar stress-dependent cell death in cardiomyocytes via its ability to modulate Nucleolin.

This study focused on the larval and pupal development of Lucilia sericata (Meigen), with an emphasis on the changes of the external morphology of the puparium and its pupal content throughout the duration of metamorphosis. Colonies of L. sericata were reared on 3 types of swine tissue (skeletal muscle, liver tissue, and heart tissue) at 2 different temperature regimes; 24\u2005\u00b1\u20051 \u00b0C and 30\u2005\u00b1\u20051 \u00b0C. The overall developmental time, larval width and length, and inner and outer pupal morphology changes were observed and recorded. The results show that: (i) temperature significantly influenced overall development time, as well as changes in larval width and length, but this effect was not dependent on tissue type; (ii) larval development duration was longest on heart tissue, and shortest on skeletal muscle for both temperatures; and (iii) pupation was longest for larvae reared on skeletal muscle at 24\u2005\u00b1\u20051 \u00b0C, and on liver tissue at 30\u2005\u00b1\u20051 \u00b0C, while those larvae reared on liver tissue at 24\u2005\u00b1\u20051 \u00b0C and heart tissue at 30\u2005\u00b1\u20051 \u00b0C had the shortest pupation period. A seven-character checklist plus 4 landmark stages were developed comprising the external morphology of the puparium and pupal content changes of L. sericata.

Large animal studies have shown that intramyocardial injection of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) following a myocardial infarction result in cell grafts but also ventricular arrhythmias. We hypothesized that intramyocardial injection of committed cardiac progenitor cells (CCPs) derived from iPSCs, combined with cardiac fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix (cECM) to enhance cell retention will: i) form cardiomyocyte containing functional grafts, ii) be free of ventricular arrhythmias and iii) restore left ventricular contractility in a post-myocardial infarction (MI) cardiomyopathy swine model.\nhiPSCs were differentiated using bioreactors and small molecules to produce a population of committed cardiac progenitor cells (CCPs). MI was created using a coronary artery balloon occlusion and reperfusion model in Yucatan mini pigs. Four weeks later, epicardial needle injections of CCPs+cECM were performed in a small initial feasibility cohort, and then transendocardial injections (TEI) of CCPs+cECM, CCPs alone, cECM alone or vehicle control into the peri-infarct region in a larger randomized cohort. A 4-drug immunosuppression regimen was administered to prevent rejection of human CCPs. Arrhythmias were evaluated using implanted event recorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and invasive pressure volume assessment were used to evaluate left ventricular anatomic and functional performance, including viability. Detailed histology was performed on the heart to detect human grafts.\nA scalable biomanufacturing protocol was developed generating CCPs which can efficiently differentiate to cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells in vitro. Intramyocardial delivery of CCPs to post-MI porcine hearts resulted in engraftment and differentiation of CCPs to form ventricular cardiomyocyte rich grafts. There was no significant difference in cardiac MRI-based measured cardiac volumes or function between control, CCP and CCP+cECM groups; however, dobutamine stimulated functional reserve was improved in CCP and CCP+cECM groups. TEI delivery of CCPs with or without cECM did not result in tumors or trigger ventricular arrhythmias.\nCCPs are a promising cell source for post-MI heart repair using clinically relevant TEI with a low risk of engraftment ventricular arrhythmias.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2024-02-26", "authors": ["Amish NRaval", "Eric GSchmuck", "SushmitaRoy", "YukihiroSaito", "TianhuaZhou", "JamesConklin", "Timothy AHacker", "ChadKoonce", "MeghanBoyer", "KristinStack", "EllenHebron", "Scott KNagle", "Patrick C HHsieh", "Timothy JKamp"], "doi": "10.1101/2024.02.14.580375"}
{"title": "Identification Drug Targets for Oxaliplatin-Induced Cardiotoxicity without Affecting Cancer Treatment through Inter Variability Cross-Correlation Analysis (IVCCA).", "abstract": "The successful treatment of side effects of chemotherapy faces two major limitations: the need to avoid interfering with pathways essential for the cancer-destroying effects of the chemotherapy drug, and the need to avoid helping tumor progression through cancer promoting cellular pathways. To address these questions and identify new pathways and targets that satisfy these limitations, we have developed the bioinformatics tool Inter Variability Cross-Correlation Analysis (IVCCA). This tool calculates the cross-correlation of differentially expressed genes, analyzes their clusters, and compares them across a vast number of known pathways to identify the most relevant target(s). To demonstrate the utility of IVCCA, we applied this platform to RNA-seq data obtained from the hearts of the animal models with oxaliplatin-induced CTX. RNA-seq of the heart tissue from oxaliplatin treated mice identified 1744 differentially expressed genes with False Discovery Rate (FDR) less than 0.05 and fold change above 1.5 across nine samples. We compared the results against traditional gene enrichment analysis methods, revealing that IVCCA identified additional pathways potentially involved in CTX beyond those detected by conventional approaches. The newly identified pathways such as energy metabolism and several others represent promising target for therapeutic intervention against CTX, while preserving the efficacy of the chemotherapy treatment and avoiding tumor proliferation. Targeting these pathways is expected to mitigate the damaging effects of chemotherapy on cardiac tissues and improve patient outcomes by reducing the incidence of heart failure and other cardiovascular complications, ultimately enabling patients to complete their full course of chemotherapy with improved quality of life and survival rates.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2024-02-26", "authors": ["JunweiDu", "Leland CSudlow", "HridoyBiswas", "Joshua DMitchell", "ShamimMollah", "Mikhail YBerezin"], "doi": "10.1101/2024.02.11.579390"}

It may present with a wide range of clinical presentations, ranging from mild symptoms to severe forms like fulminant myocarditis, characterized by hemodynamic compromise and cardiogenic shock. The immune system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of myocarditis. In fact, while its function is primarily protective, aberrant responses can be detrimental. In this context, both innate and adaptive immunity play pivotal roles; notably, the innate system offers a non-specific and immediate defense, while the adaptive provides specialized protection with immunological memory. However, dysregulation in these systems can misidentify cardiac tissue, triggering autoimmune reactions and possibly leading to significant cardiac tissue damage.

Circular RNAPAN3 (circPAN3) is involved in autophagy, fibrosis and apoptosis which are responsible for the reduction incardiac functional capacityfollowingmyocardial infarction(MI). However, the molecular mechanism of circPAN3 association with apoptosis is unknown. In addition, the relationship between quercetin as a cardioprotective factor in MI and circular RNA-dependent regulatory pathways has not yet been elucidated. MI was induced in Wistar rats using the left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation method. One day after surgery, quercetin (30\u00a0mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneal (IP) every other day for two weeks. The expression of circPAN3 was increased in the MI group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The increase in circPAN3 was accompanied by a decrease in miR-221 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), an increase in PTEN (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and cleaved caspase 3 (P <\u00a00.001). Quercetin effectively reduced the expression of circPAN3 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), PTEN (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and cleaved caspase 3 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and increased the expression of miR-221 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and the ratio of p-AKT to p-PI3K (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The circPAN3/miR-221/PTEN pathway is an ncRNA-dependent apoptotic pathway in MI cardiac tissue. Quercetin effectively modulated this pathway, resulting in a reduction of cardiac tissue death and improvement in cardiac function after MI.

A rotor is a wave of excitation in the cardiac tissue that wraps around its refractory tail, causing faster-than-normal periodic excitation. The detection of rotor centres is of crucial importance in guiding ablation strategies for the treatment of arrhythmia. The most popular technique for detecting rotor centres is Phase Mapping (PM), which detects phase singularities derived from the phase of a signal. This method has been proven to be prone to errors, especially in regimes of fibrotic tissue and temporal noise. Recently, a novel technique called Directed Graph Mapping (DGM) was developed to detect rotational activity such as rotors by creating a network of excitation. This research aims to compare the performance of advanced PM techniques versus DGM for the detection of rotors using 64 simulated 2D meandering rotors in the presence of various levels of fibrotic tissue and temporal noise.

G/P(VDF-TrFE) films have been characterized in terms of topographical, physico-chemical, mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, and studied the response of cardiomyocytes adhering to them. The results indicate that the crystallinity and the wettability of the composites remain almost unaffected after G incorporation. In turn, surface roughness, Young modulus, and electric properties are higher in G/P(VDF-TrFE).

Microarray, real-time PCR, and western blotting (WB) results demonstrated that the Mst1 gene was downregulated in the heart tissue of the MI rat model. HBO preconditioning significantly increased Mst1 expression in cardiac tissues of rats after MI modeling. Lentiviral infection was used to silence the Mst1 gene in rats treated with HBO to probe the effect of Mst1 on HBO cardioprotection. HBO preconditioning decreased heart infarct size and ameliorated cardiac function in MI rats, whereas Mst1 silencing reversed the effect of HBO administration, as indicated after heat infarct size determination via TTC staining, histological examination via HE staining, and measurements of cardiac function. HBO preconditioning reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiac tissue of MI rat model, evidenced by alteration of malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and protein carbonyl contents, as well as production of inflammation-associated myeloperoxidase (MPO), IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1.

However, few reports have examined cardiovascular events in non-obese MASLD mouse models. In this study we created a mouse model to mimic this condition. In this study involving seven-week-old C57BL/6J male mice, two dietary conditions were tested: a standard high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (STHD-01) and a combined diet of STHD-01 and ethanol. Over periods of 6 and 12 weeks, we analyzed the effects on liver and cardiac tissues using various staining techniques and PCR. Echocardiography and blood tests were also performed to assess cardiac function and liver damage. The results showed that mice on the ethanol-supplemented STHD-01 diet developed signs of steatohepatitis and cardiac dysfunction, along with increased sympathetic activity, as early as 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, more pronounced exacerbations accompanied with cardiac dilation, advanced liver fibrosis, and activated myocardial fibrosis with sympathetic activation were observed. This mouse model effectively replicated non-obese MASLD and cardiac dysfunction over a 12-week period using a combined diet of STHD-01 and ethanol. This dietary approach highlighted that both liver inflammation and fibrosis, as well as cardiac dysfunction, could be significantly worsened due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

At Day 42, we assessed cardiac function, collected blood and heart tissues. Heart tissue samples were analyzed for inflammation, necroptosis, signaling mechanism, hypertrophy and adverse structural remodeling using histology, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, RT-PCR, cytokine array and TF array.\nSTZ treated ApoE-/- mice developed diabetes, with significantly (p<0.05) increased blood glucose and body weight loss. These mice developed cardiac dysfunction with significantly (p<0.05) increased left ventricular internal diameter end diastole and end systole, and decreased ejection fraction, and fractional shortening. We found significant (p<0.05) increased expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF- a, IL-6, IL-1a, IL-33 and decreased IL-10 expression. Diabetic mice also exhibited significantly (p<0.05) increased necroptosis marker expression and infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages.

However, obtaining samples from affected vital organs often poses safety challenges. In this study, we aimed to investigate potential correlations between the levels of disease-associated immune molecules in the bloodstream with their gene expression profiles in the hearts of patients suffering from Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC). This debilitating and often fatal condition is caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi.\nBlood samples were analyzed using the Bio-Plex platform. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to determine gene expression profile in heart tissue from CCC and non-Chagas controls (CTRL).\nElevated levels of inflammatory cytokines were detected in the plasma of CCC patients, and these levels correlated with clinical indicators of deteriorating cardiac function. Notably, 75% of the soluble factors assessed in the plasma exhibited a consistent relationship with their gene expression levels in the cardiac tissue of CCC patients. Analysis of interactions and signaling pathways related to these molecules revealed an overrepresentation of inflammatory pathways in both blood and heart compartments. Moreover, we identified that differentially expressed genes in CCC cardiac tissue were primarily associated with T-cell signaling pathways and correlated with the presence of CD8+ T cells in the myocardium.\nOur findings establish a strong correlation between relevant immune molecules and their signaling pathways in both the blood and heart tissue in CCC. This validates the use of blood as a non-invasive medium for understanding immunopathology and identifying markers for cardiac dysfunction in Chagas disease.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["Thaiany GSouza-Silva", "Eula G ANeves", "CarolinaKoh", "AndreaTeixeira-Carvalho", "Silvana SilvaAra\u00fajo", "Maria do Carmo PereiraNunes", "Juliana de Assis SilvaGomes", "Kenneth JGollob", "Walderez OrnelasDutra"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2024.1338582\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.08.004\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.4269/ajtmh.1996.55.629\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62976-8\n10.1155/2014/683230\n10.1086/505395\n10.1128/IAI.73.12.7960-7966.2005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0087082\n10.3390/pathogens12020171\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.787423\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.787423\n10.1016/j.eeh.2020.101342\n10.4269/ajtmh.1997.56.485\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002989\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0008889\n10.1093/cid/cix506\n10.1016/j.meegid.2021.105079\n10.1038/s41598-022-26277-w\n10.1590/s0037-86821998000300008\n10.1016/j.echo.2014.10.003\n10.1128/IAI.72.9.5283-5291.2004\n10.1093/nar/gkv468\n10.1142/S0219720014500188\n10.1093/nar/gkz240\n10.3892/ol.2020.11439\n10.1073/pnas.1604351113\n10.1038/nri2295\n10.1038/nri2295\n10.1093/infdis/jis724\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.09.010\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.09.010\n10.4049/jimmunol.0900047\n10.1016/j.clim.2023.109331\n10.1590/S0074-02762008000400011\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0001867\n10.3390/pathogens11121402\n10.1007/BF01614765\n10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.00183.x\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002645\n10.1126/science.1090148\n10.1093/intimm/6.4.499\n10.1093/intimm/dxh387\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0000512"}

However, the current nanofiber scaffold preparation strategy, which mainly includes manual assembly and hybrid 3D printing, faces the challenge of integrated fabrication of morphology-controllable nanofibers due to its cross-scale structural feature. In this research, a trench-guided electrospinning (ES) strategy was proposed to directly fabricate 3D aligned nanofiber scaffolds with alternative ES and a direct ink writing (DIW) process. The electric field effect of DIW poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) side walls on guiding whipping ES nanofibers was investigated to construct trench design rules. It was found that the width/height ratio of trenches greatly affected the nanofiber alignment, and the trench width/height ratio of 1.5 provided the nanofiber alignment degree over 60%. As a proof of principle, 3D nanofiber scaffolds with controllable porosity (60-80%) and alignment (30-60%) were fabricated. The effect of the scaffolds was verified by culturing human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), which resulted in the uniform 3D distribution of aligned hiPSC-CMs with \u223c1000 \u03bcm thickness. Therefore, this printing strategy shows great potential for the efficient engineered tissue construction.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["BinQiu", "DongyangWu", "MingchengXue", "LuOu", "YanfeiZheng", "FengXu", "HangJin", "QiangGao", "JianZhuang", "JianzhengCen", "BinLin", "Yu-ChuanSu", "SongyueChen", "DaohengSun"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c03358"}

However, achieving secure adhesion onto the wet beating heart and local regulation of pathological microenvironment remains challenging. Herein, a dough-kneading-inspired design of hydrogel adhesive cardiac patch is reported, aiming to improve the strength of prevalent powder-formed patch and retain wet adhesion. In mimicking the polysaccharide and protein components of natural flour, methacrylated polyglutamic acid (PGAMA) is electrostatically interacted with hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCS) to form PGAMA/HPCS coacervate hydrogel. The PGAMA/HPCS hydrogel is freeze-dried and ground into powders, which are further rehydrated with two aqueous solutions of functional drug, 3-acrylamido phenylboronic acid (APBA)/rutin (Rt) complexes for protecting the myocardium from advanced glycation end product (AGEs) injury by reactive oxygen species (ROS) -responsive Rt release, and hypoxanthine-loaded methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) nanogels for enhancing macrophage targeting ability to regulate glycometabolism for combating inflammation. The rehydrated powders bearing APBA/Rt complexes and HAMA-hypoxanthine nanogels are repeatedly kneaded into a dough-like gel, which is further subjected to thermal-initiated crosslinking to form a stabilized and sticky patch.

Treatment with the Activin A Ab did not affect cardiac oxidative phosphorylation. However, the Activin A antibody was active in the skeleton, disrupting the effect of CKD to stimulate osteoclast number, eroded surfaces and the stimulation of osteoclast-driven remodeling.

However, the specific signal pathway by which RSV protects the aging heart is not yet well understood. This study aimed to explore the protective effects of RSV against age-related heart injury and investigate the underlying mechanisms using a D-galactose-induced aging model. The results of the study indicated that RSV provided protection against age-related heart impairment in mice. This was evidenced by the reduction of cardiac histopathological changes as well as the attenuation of apoptosis. RSV-induced cardioprotection was linked to a significant increase in antioxidant activity and mitochondrial transmembrane potential, as well as a reduction in oxidative damage. Additionally, RSV inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Furthermore, the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-\u03baB p65), and notch 1 protein were inhibited by RSV, indicating that inhibiting the Notch/NF-\u03baB pathway played a critical role in RSV-triggered heart protection in aging mice. Moreover, further data on intestinal function demonstrated that RSV significantly increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in intestinal contents and reduced the pH value in the feces of aging mice.

A rat model of ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy was also established. The expression levels of cardiac hypertrophy markers, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) markers, and apoptosis markers were measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blotting. The apoptosis level, size of myocardial cells, and heart tissue pathological changes were determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling staining, immunofluorescence staining, haematoxylin and eosin staining, and Masson's staining. We found that CGA treatment decreased the size of ISO-treated H9c2 cells. Moreover, CGA inhibited ISO-induced up-regulation of cardiac hypertrophy markers (atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain), ERS markers (C/EBP homologous protein, glucose regulatory protein 78, and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), and apoptosis markers (bax and cleaved caspase-12/9/3) but increased the expression of anti-apoptosis marker bcl-2 in a dose-dependent way (0, 10, 50, and 100\u00a0\u03bcM). Knockdown of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1pr1) reversed the protective effect of CGA on cardiac hypertrophy, ERS, and apoptosis in vitro (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CGA also restored ISO-induced inhibition on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signalling in H9c2 cells, while S1pr1 knockdown abolished these CGA-induced effects (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CGA (90\u00a0mg/kg/day, for six consecutive days) protected rats against cardiac hypertrophy in vivo (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nCGA treatment attenuated ISO-induced ERS and cardiac hypertrophy by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway via modulation of S1pr1.", "journal": "ESC heart failure", "date": "2024-02-19", "authors": ["PingPing", "TingYang", "ChaoxueNing", "QingkaiZhao", "YaliZhao", "TaoYang", "ZhitaoGao", "ShihuiFu"], "doi": "10.1002/ehf2.14707"}

Therefore, in order to investigate the toxic effects of PET microplastics on mammals, this study investigated the toxic effects of PET MPs on ICR mice and H9C2 cells by different treatment groups. The results indicated the cardiac tissue of mice in the PET-H (50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) group showed significant capillary congestion, myocardial fiber breakage, and even significant fibrosis compared to the PET-C (control) group (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Results of the TUNEL assay demonstrated significant apoptosis in myocardial tissue in the PET-H and PET-M (5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) groups (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Meanwhile, Western blotting showed increased expression of the apoptosis-related protein Bax and decreased expression of PARP, caspase-3, and Bcl-2 proteins in both myocardial tissues and H9C2 cells. In addition, flow cytometry confirmed that PET MPs decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis in H9C2 cells; however, this trend was reversed by N-acetylcysteamine application. Moreover, PET MP treatment induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H9C2 cells, while the MDA level in the myocardial tissue was elevated, and the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were decreased (P\u2009<\u20090.01), indicating a change in the redox environment. In conclusion, PET MPs promoted cardiomyocyte apoptosis by inducing oxidative stress and activating mitochondria-mediated apoptotic processes, ultimately leading to myocardial fibrosis.

{"title": "Canonical Wnt signaling directs the generation of functional human PSC-derived atrioventricular canal cardiomyocytes in bioprinted cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "The creation of a functional 3D bioprinted human heart remains challenging, largely due to the lack of some crucial cardiac cell types, including the atrioventricular canal (AVC) cardiomyocytes, which are essential to slow down the electrical impulse between the atrium and ventricle. By utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and a 3D bioprinting technology, we discover that stage-specific activation of canonical Wnt signaling creates functional AVC cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. These cardiomyocytes display morphological characteristics and express molecular markers of AVC cardiomyocytes, including transcription factors TBX2 and MSX2. When bioprinted in prefabricated cardiac tissues, these cardiomyocytes successfully delay the electrical impulse, demonstrating their capability of functioning as the AVC cardiomyocytes in\u00a0vitro. Thus, these findings not only identify canonical Wnt signaling as a key regulator of the AVC cardiomyocyte differentiation in\u00a0vitro, but, more importantly, provide a critical cellular source for the biofabrication of a functional human heart.", "journal": "Cell stem cell", "date": "2024-02-17", "authors": ["ChenxiYe", "ChuanlaiYang", "HeqiangZhang", "RuiGao", "YingnanLiao", "YaliZhang", "LingjunJie", "YanhuiZhang", "TongCheng", "YanWang", "JieRen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.stem.2024.01.008"}

In this meta-analysis, we explore mitochondrial and peroxisomal gene expression on RNA and protein levels in the brain, heart, kidney, and liver, focusing on lipid metabolism. Further, we evaluate a potential developmental and heart region-dependent specificity of our gene set. We find marginal expression of the enzymes for peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in cardiac tissue in comparison to the liver or cardiac mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation. However, the expression of peroxisome biogenesis proteins in the heart is similar to other tissues despite low levels of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation.

This study demonstrates the cardioprotective benefits of FLASH proton RT (F-PRT) compared with standard (conventional) proton RT (S-PRT), as evidenced by reduced acute and chronic cardiac toxicities.\nMice were imaged using cone beam computed tomography to precisely determine the heart's apex as the beam isocenter. Irradiation was conducted using a shoot-through technique with a 5-mm diameter circular collimator. Bulk RNA-sequencing was performed on nonirradiated samples, as well as apexes treated with F-PRT or S-PRT, at 2 weeks after a single 40 Gy dose. Inflammatory responses were assessed through multiplex cytokine/chemokine microbead assay and immunofluorescence analyses. Levels of perivascular fibrosis were quantified using Masson's Trichrome and Picrosirius red staining. Additionally, cardiac tissue functionality was evaluated by 2-dimensional echocardiograms at 8- and 30-weeks post-PRT.\nRadiation damage was specifically localized to the heart's apex. RNA profiling of cardiac tissues treated with PRT revealed that S-PRT uniquely upregulated pathways associated with DNA damage response, induction of tumor necrosis factor superfamily, and inflammatory response, and F-PRT primarily affected cytoplasmic translation, mitochondrion organization, and adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Notably, F-PRT led to a milder inflammatory response, accompanied by significantly attenuated changes in transforming growth factor \u03b21 and \u03b1 smooth muscle actin levels. Critically, F-PRT decreased collagen deposition and better preserved cardiac functionality compared with S-PRT.\nThis study demonstrated that F-PRT reduces the induction of an inflammatory environment with lower expression of inflammatory cytokines and profibrotic factors.

Natural medicine has been used to cure or prevent cardiovascular disease for decades. As a natural flavonoid, anthocyanidin has been used to treat many diseases due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and other properties. A mouse model (C57BL/6) weighing 30-40\u00a0g was utilized to induce myocardial infarction by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Cyanidin (30\u00a0mg/kg) was administered orally to mice for four weeks. A variety of assessments were used to evaluate cardiac function. The gene expression was measured using RNAseq and Western blot. Histological changes in myocardial tissue were assessed using staining techniques, including Masson, Hematoxylin Eosin (HE), and transmission electron microscopy. Tunnel staining was implemented as a method to detect cellular apoptosis. For the quantification of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the serum, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed. Furthermore, autodock simulation was executed in order to assess the interaction between cyanidin and a subset of genes. Cyanidin treatment inhibited myocardial cell apoptosis, improved cardiac function, and reduced serum concentrations of BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide ANP, as well as mitigated histological cardiac tissue damage. Cyanidin also inhibited the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) and Fibronectin 1 (Fn1). Cyanidin improves heart function and reduces myocardial damage in mice after MI. Furthermore, cyanidin can prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

GA treatment showed ameliorative effects against lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress caused by BPA by increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) and GSH level of the heart tissue and decreasing the MDA level. In addition, GA showed antiapoptotic effect by increasing Bcl-2, procaspase-3, and -9 protein expression levels and decreasing Bax, cytochrome c, and P53 protein levels in heart tissue.

Vibrational spectroscopy is a novel technique that offers an alternative atraumatic approach, with short scan times, while providing metabolic and morphological data. This review evaluates vibrational spectroscopy for the assessment of fibrosis, with a focus on point-of-care capabilities. OVID Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were systematically searched using PRISMA guidelines for search terms including vibrational spectroscopy, human tissue and fibrosis. Studies were stratified based on imaging modality and tissue type. Outcomes recorded included tissue type, machine learning technique, metrics for accuracy and author conclusions. Systematic review yielded 420 articles, of which 14 were relevant. Ten of these articles considered mid-infrared spectroscopy, three dealt with Raman spectroscopy and one with near-infrared spectroscopy. The metrics for detecting fibrosis were Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.65-0.98; sensitivity from 76-100%; specificity from 90-99%; area under receiver operator curves from 0.83-0.98; and accuracy of 86-99%. Vibrational spectroscopy identified fibrosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms in bone, cirrhotic and hepatocellular carcinoma in liver, end-stage heart failure in cardiac tissue and following laser ablation for acne in skin. It also identified interstitial fibrosis as a predictor of early renal transplant rejection in renal tissue. Vibrational spectroscopic techniques can therefore accurately identify fibrosis in a range of human tissues. Emerging data show that it can be used to quantify, classify and provide data about the nature of fibrosis with a high degree of accuracy with potential scope for point-of-care use.", "journal": "Pathology", "date": "2024-02-11", "authors": ["Varun JSharma", "AashimaSingh", "James LlewelynGrant", "JaishankarRaman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pathol.2023.11.008"}

{"title": "Downregulation of salusins alleviates hypertrophic cardiomyopathy via attenuating oxidative stress and autophagy.", "abstract": "Salusins, which are translated from the alternatively spliced mRNA of torsin family 2 member A (TOR2A), play a vital role in regulation of various cardiovascular diseases. However, it remains unclear precisely regarding their roles in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Therefore, this study was conducted to explore therapeutic effect and the underlying mechanisms of salusins on HCM.\nIn vivo experiments, Sprague-Dawley rats were used to induce HCM model by angiotensin (Ang) II infusion for 4\u00a0weeks. The rats were randomly divided into four groups, namely, Saline\u2009+\u2009Control shRNA (n\u2009=\u20097), Ang II\u2009+\u2009Control shRNA (n\u2009=\u20098), Saline\u2009+\u2009TOR2A shRNA (n\u2009=\u20097), and Ang II\u2009+\u2009TOR2A shRNA groups (n\u2009=\u20098). After HCM induction, doppler echocardiography is recommended to evaluate heart function. In vitro experiments, primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs)\u00a0were obtained from newborn rats, and were treated with Ang II (10\nAfter treatment with Ang II, levels of salusin-\u03b1 and salusin-\u03b2 were elevated in serum and cardiac tissues of rats and in the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. Downregulation of salusins alleviated the Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy by suppressing the increased atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and beta-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MHC) and cardiac fibrosis by blocking collagen I, collagen III and transforming\u00a0growth\u00a0factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), and it also attenuated oxidative stress by suppressing the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and reversing the decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and autophagy by inhibiting the increased microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B), Beclin1, autophagy related gene (Atg) 3 and Atg5 in the cardiac tissues of Ang II-infused rats and in the Ang II-treated NRCMs.\nAll these findings suggest that the levels of salusins were elevated in the HCM, and targeting of salusins contributes to alleviation of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis probably via attenuating oxidative stress and autophagy. Accordingly, targeting of salusins may be a strategy for HCM therapy.", "journal": "European journal of medical research", "date": "2024-02-10", "authors": ["Jing-YiDang", "WeiZhang", "YiChu", "Jiang-HongChen", "Zhao-LeJi", "PinFeng"], "doi": "10.1186/s40001-024-01676-z\n10.1007/s43657-021-00037-8\n10.1007/s11010-021-04286-z\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173916\n10.1007/s43657-021-00022-1\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.174980\n10.1038/s41420-021-00775-8\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60397-3\n10.1080/10408363.2018.1525335\n10.1038/nm913\n10.1002/jemt.22868\n10.3109/10520295.2013.821167\n10.1155/2021/8896226\n10.1038/srep43259\n10.3389/fphys.2021.622954\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2016.05.056\n10.1038/s41467-022-28385-7\n10.1038/s41467-021-27637-2\n10.1002/ejhf.1320\n10.1038/s41420-022-00969-8\n10.1155/2022/9154295\n10.1038/cddis.2017.106\n10.1080/21655979.2021.1972900\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101411\n10.1016/j.apsb.2021.07.021\n10.1186/s13062-021-00313-7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.12.006\n10.1080/08916934.2021.1992754\n10.1186/s12964-021-00793-0\n10.1172/JCI146821\n10.1186/s12964-023-01168-3\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.12.020\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2015.05.008\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165768\n10.1080/10520295.2017.1283056\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.04.026\n10.1093/cvr/cvab158\n10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.002\n10.1016/j.tcb.2015.02.002\n10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113748"}

This study aims to develop niosomes (NS) containing BS, utilizing cholesterol as the lipid and Tween 80 as the stabilizer. The research focuses on designing and evaluating both conventional BS-NS and hyaluronic acid (HA) modified NS (BS-HA-NS) to enhance the specificity and efficacy of BS within cardiac tissue. The resulting niosomal formulation was spherical, with a size of about 158.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57\u00a0nm, an entrapment efficiency of 93.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.48\u00a0%, and a drug loading of 8.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.62\u00a0%. To evaluate cytotoxicity on H9c2 heart cells, the MTT assay was used. The cellular uptake of BS-NS and BS-HA-NS was confirmed by confocal microscopy on H9c2 cardiac cells. Administering BS-NS and BS-HA-NS intravenously at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg showed the ability to significantly decrease the levels of cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lipid peroxidation (MDA).

{"title": "Selective Induction of Molecular Assembly to Tissue-Level Anisotropy on Peptide-Based Optoelectronic Cardiac Biointerfaces.", "abstract": "The conduction efficiency of ions in excitable tissues and of charged species in organic conjugated materials both benefit from having ordered domains and anisotropic pathways. In this study, a photocurrent-generating cardiac biointerface is presented, particularly for investigating the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to geometrically comply to biomacromolecular cues differentially assembled on a conductive nanogrooved substrate. Through a polymeric surface-templated approach, photoconductive substrates with symmetric peptide-quaterthiophene (4T)-peptide units assembled as 1D nanostructures on nanoimprinted polyalkylthiophene (P3HT) surface are developed. The 4T-based peptides studied here can form 1D nanostructures on prepatterned polyalkylthiophene substrates, as directed by hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions between 4T and P3HT, and physical confinement on the nanogrooves. It is observed that smaller 4T-peptide units that can achieve a higher degree of assembly order within the polymeric templates serve as a more efficient driver of cardiac cytoskeletal anisotropy than merely presenting aligned -RGD bioadhesive epitopes on a nanotopographic surface. These results unravel some insights on how cardiomyocytes perceive submicrometer dimensionality, local molecular order, and characteristics of surface cues in their immediate environment.

Nevertheless, human iPSC-CMs have longer action potential and lower cell-to-cell coupling than adult-like CMs. These immature electrophysiological properties favor arrhythmias due to the generation of electrophysiological gradients when hiPSC-CMs are injected in the cardiac tissue. Culturing hiPSC-CMs on three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds can promote their maturation and influence their alignment. However, it is still uncertain how on-scaffold culturing influences the overall electrophysiology of the in vitro and implanted EHTs, as it requires expensive and time consuming experimentation. Here, we computationally investigated the impact of the scaffold design on the EHT electrical depolarization and repolarization before and after engraftment on infarcted tissue. We first acquired and processed electrical recordings from in vitro EHTs, which we used to calibrate the modeling and simulation of in silico EHTs to replicate experimental outcomes. Next, we built in silico EHT models for a range of scaffold pore sizes, shapes (square, rectangular, auxetic, hexagonal) and thicknesses.

{"title": "Advances in the Generation of Constructed Cardiac Tissue Derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Disease Modeling and Therapeutic Discovery.", "abstract": "The human heart lacks significant regenerative capacity; thus, the solution to heart failure (HF) remains organ donation, requiring surgery and immunosuppression. The demand for constructed cardiac tissues (CCTs) to model and treat disease continues to grow. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) manipulation, CRISPR gene editing, and 3D tissue culture have enabled a boom in iPSC-derived CCTs (iPSC-CCTs) with diverse cell types and architecture. Compared with 2D-cultured cells, iPSC-CCTs better recapitulate heart biology, demonstrating the potential to advance organ modeling, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine, though iPSC-CCTs could benefit from better methods to faithfully mimic heart physiology and electrophysiology. Here, we summarize advances in iPSC-CCTs and future developments in the vascularization, immunization, and maturation of iPSC-CCTs for study and therapy.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["Truman JRoland", "KunhuaSong"], "doi": "10.3390/cells13030250\n10.3390/ijms24065188\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.980393\n10.1063/5.0093399\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321670\n10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113970\n10.1007/s00395-023-01005-1\n10.1039/D3TB00783A\n10.3390/cells12131727\n10.1242/dmm.049961\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121298\n10.1038/s41427-021-00330-y\n10.1186/s13287-022-03054-0\n10.1186/s12964-022-00993-2\n10.1007/s12015-022-10385-1\n10.1038/s41591-021-01279-9\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.03.009\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.026\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319060\n10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112322\n10.1016/j.talanta.2023.124901\n10.1002/term.3327\n10.1016/j.stem.2022.03.012\n10.1038/s41592-022-01591-3\n10.1016/j.isci.2022.104330\n10.1038/s41536-020-00099-8\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2023.03.009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.322561\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321770\n10.1186/s13287-023-03470-w\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312136\n10.7150/thno.20524\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103813\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aay1318\n10.1038/s41551-022-00885-3\n10.1007/s11886-022-01670-z\n10.1126/sciadv.adf2898\n10.1002/adhm.202301067\n10.1038/s41586-023-06564-w\n10.1007/978-981-99-0722-9_15\n10.1038/s41587-023-01956-9\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2022.12.021\n10.1016/j.stem.2023.04.011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.320305\n10.7150/thno.67661\n10.1038/s41467-021-25329-5\n10.1159/000529431\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.06.011\n10.1038/ncb3205\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.1038/s41467-022-34730-7\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1038/s41596-021-00497-2\n10.1038/s41467-018-05604-8\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.034\n10.3390/ijms24076244\n10.3389/fbioe.2023.1155052\n10.1038/s42003-022-03346-4\n10.1016/j.cell.2023.10.030\n10.1038/s41569-022-00770-1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1038/s41587-023-01718-7\n10.1038/s41467-020-17740-1\n10.3390/bioengineering10020124\n10.1016/j.trsl.2022.08.009\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121860\n10.1016/j.bioadv.2022.212916\n10.1038/s41598-022-22225-w\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321769\n10.1016/j.stem.2021.11.007\n10.1016/j.isci.2022.104486\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042\n10.1002/adfm.202215043\n10.3390/ijms23073482\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119517\n10.1038/s41467-021-21682-7\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.01.018\n10.1038/s41536-021-00140-4\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311920\n10.1038/s41467-019-12472-3\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.05.017\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.030\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.1059243\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321768\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.12.007\n10.1016/j.apmt.2022.101582\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw240\n10.1186/s12951-018-0388-4\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.04.020\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.10.001\n10.7554/eLife.67872\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02028\n10.1039/D0LC00921K\n10.1038/s41536-021-00189-1\n10.1080/14712598.2023.2211203\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035736\n10.1016/j.isci.2023.107012\n10.1002/btpr.3381\n10.1016/j.nantod.2021.101210"}

We previously devised a traveling wave (TW) system to promote maturation in 3D cardiac tissue.

This gave rise to a hiPSC-derived closed-loop cardiac tissue (iCT), enabling spontaneous TW initiation and swift pacing of cardiomyocytes from various cell lines. The TW-paced cardiomyocytes demonstrated heightened sarcomeric and functional maturation, exhibiting enhanced response to isoproterenol. Moreover, these cells showcased diminished sensitivity to verapamil and maintained low arrhythmia rates with ranolazine-two drugs associated with a low risk of torsades de pointes (TdP).

{"title": "Pluripotent stem cell-based cardiac regenerative therapy for heart failure.", "abstract": "Cardiac regenerative therapy using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) is expected to become an alternative to heart transplantation for severe heart failure. It is now possible to produce large numbers of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and eliminate non-cardiomyocytes, including residual undifferentiated hPSCs, which can cause teratoma formation after transplantation. There are two main strategies for transplanting hPSC-CMs: injection of hPSC-CMs into the myocardium from the epicardial side, and implantation of hPSC-CM patches or engineered heart tissues onto the epicardium. Transplantation of hPSC-CMs into the myocardium of large animals in a myocardial infarction model improved cardiac function. The engrafted hPSC-CMs matured, and microvessels derived from the host entered the graft abundantly. Furthermore, as less invasive methods using catheters, injection into the coronary artery and injection into the myocardium from the endocardium side have recently been investigated. Since transplantation of hPSC-CMs alone has a low engraftment rate, various methods such as transplantation with the extracellular matrix or non-cardiomyocytes and aggregation of hPSC-CMs have been developed. Post-transplant arrhythmias, imaging of engrafted hPSC-CMs, and immune rejection are the remaining major issues, and research is being conducted to address them. The clinical application of cardiac regenerative therapy using hPSC-CMs has just begun and is expected to spread widely if its safety and efficacy are proven in the near future.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["YusukeSoma", "HidenoriTani", "YuikaMorita-Umei", "YoshikazuKishino", "KeiichiFukuda", "ShugoTohyama"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2023.12.001"}
{"title": "Metronidazole promotes oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation-mediated myocardial injury in albino mice.", "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the cardiotoxic effects of Metronidazole (Mtz) in albino mice. The mice were divided into four experimental groups: Gp.I (control group): saline, Gp.II:125\u00a0mg/kg b.w Mtz, Gp.III:250\u00a0mg/kg b.w, Gp.IV:500\u00a0mg/kg b.w Mtz. Heart weight ratio, markers of cardiac injury, markers of oxidative stress, histopathological examinations, DNA fragmentation and spectral analysis were used to determine cardiotoxicity. Administration of 125-500\u00a0mg/kg Mtz caused an increase in heart weight and a decrease in body weight. Administration of 500\u00a0mg/kg Mtz increased heart weight by 35.5% and decreased body weight by 21.9% compared with control. Mtz-treated mice showed a significant increase in cardiac injury biomarkers and serious alterations in cardiac oxidative stress markers. Histopathological changes of cardiac tissues observed in mice treated with Mtz include myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocarditis, separation of the muscle fibers, congestion-narrowing in vessels, necrosis, myocardium-vacuolation, myocytolysis, myocyte degeneration, nuclear aggregation, cytoplasmic fragmentation and prevalent nuclei. Mtz treatment already resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of head DNA and an increase in the percentage of tail DNA. The most striking tail formation among the Mtz-treated groups was observed in the group receiving 500\u00a0mg/kg Mtz. In the presence of Mtz, there was a hypochromic shift in the absorption spectrum of DNA, and the potential DNA-Mtz interaction was found to occur in the intercalation mode. These results show that Mtz used against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa in gastrointestinal infections can cause severe cardiotoxic findings in albino mice and cause fragmentation in DNA.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["FatmanurCo\u015fkun", "EmineYal\u00e7\u0131n", "K\u00fclti\u011fin\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141382"}

Fetal exposure to excess dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has been shown to alter adult behaviour and metabolism. This study investigated the effects prenatal dexamethasone exposure had on adult offspring cardiac and liver metabolism and oxidative stress. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice received a dose of 0.4\u2009mg/kg dexamethasone on gestational days 15-17. Once pups were approximately 7\u2009months old, glucose uptake was determined using positron emission tomography and insulin resistance (IR) was determined by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) IR calculation. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring 4-hydroxynonenal protein adduct formation and total reactive oxygen species. Female dexamethasone group had significantly increased glucose uptake when insulin stimulated compared to vehicle-treated mice. HOMA IR revealed no evidence of IR in either male or female offspring. There was also no change in oxidative stress markers in either cardiac or liver tissues of male or female offspring. These data suggest that prenatal dexamethasone exposure in male mice does not alter oxidative stress or metabolism. However, prenatal dexamethasone exposure increased glucocorticoids, cardiac glucose uptake, and pAkt signaling in female heart tissues in adult mice, suggesting there are sex differences in prenatal dexamethasone exposure.", "journal": "Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "date": "2024-02-08", "authors": ["A SNemec-Bakk", "JBel", "SNiccoli", "D RBoreham", "T CTai", "S JLees", "NKhaper"], "doi": "10.1139/cjpp-2023-0254"}

These two factors play an important role in cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration. The contractile property of cardiomyocytes depends on directed signal transmission over the electroconductive systems that happen inside the innate myocardium. Because of their distinctive electrical behavior, electroactive materials such as graphene might be used for the regeneration of cardiac tissue.\nIn this review, we aim to provide deep insight into the applications of graphene and graphene derivative-based hybrid polymeric scaffolds in cardiomyogenic differentiation and cardiac tissue regeneration.\nSynthetic biodegradable polymers are considered as a platform because their degradation can be controlled over time and easily functionalized. Therefore, graphene-polymeric hybrid scaffolds with anisotropic electrical behavior can be utilized to produce organizational and efficient constructs for macroscopic cardiac tissue engineering. In cardiac tissue regeneration, natural polymer based-scaffolds such as chitosan, gelatin, and cellulose can provide a permissive setting significantly supporting the differentiation and growth of the human induced pluripotent stem cells -derived cardiomyocytes, in large part due to their negligible immunogenicity and suitable biodegradability.\nCardiac tissue regeneration characteristically utilizes an extracellular matrix (scaffold), cells, and growth factors that enhance cell adhesion, growth, and cardiogenic differentiation.

{"title": "Protective effect of diindolylmethane-enriched dietary cabbage against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice.", "abstract": "Chemotherapy with doxorubicin (Dox) can lead to cardiotoxic effects, presenting a major complication in cancer therapy. Diindolylmethane (DIM), derived from cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, exhibits numerous health benefits. However, its clinical application is limited because of low bioavailability and suboptimal natural concentrations in dietary sources. To address this limitation, we developed a processing methodology, specifically fermentation and boiling, to enhance DIM levels in cabbage. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed a threefold DIM increase in fermented cabbage and a substantial ninefold increase in fermented-boiled cabbage compared to raw cabbage. To evaluate the clinical implications, we formulated a DIM-enriched diet and administered it to mice undergoing Dox treatment. Our in vivo results revealed that Dox treatment led to cardiotoxicity, manifested by changes in body and heart weight, increased mortality, and severe myocardial tissue degeneration. Dietary administration of the DIM-enriched diet enhanced antioxidant defenses and inhibited apoptosis in the cardiac tissue by interfering with mitoptosis and increasing antioxidant enzyme expression. Interestingly, we found that the DIM-enriched diet inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kB in cardiac tissue, thereby downregulating the expression of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6.

{"title": "Fetal programming and lactation: modulating gene expression in response to undernutrition during intrauterine life.", "abstract": "Adverse environmental conditions during intrauterine life, known as fetal programming, significantly contribute to the development of diseases in adulthood. Fetal programming induced by factors like maternal undernutrition leads to low birth weight and increases the risk of cardiometabolic diseases.\nWe studied a rat model of maternal undernutrition during gestation (MUN) to investigate gene expression changes in cardiac tissue using RNA-sequencing of day 0-1 litters. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of lactation at day 21, in MUN model and cross-fostering experiments, on cardiac structure and function assessed by transthoracic echocardiography, and gene expression changes though qPCR.\nOur analysis identified specific genes with altered expression in MUN rats at birth. Two of them, Agt and Pparg, stand out for being associated with cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. At the end of the lactation period, MUN males showed increased expression of Agt and decreased expression of Pparg, correlating with cardiac hypertrophy. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that lactation with control breastmilk mitigated these expression changes reducing cardiac hypertrophy in MUN males.\nOur findings highlight the interplay between fetal programming, gene expression, and cardiac hypertrophy suggesting that lactation period is a potential intervention window to mitigate the effects of fetal programming.\nHeart remodeling involves the alteration of several groups of genes and lactation period plays a key role in establishing gene expression modification caused by fetal programming. We could identify expression changes of relevant genes in cardiac tissue induced by undernutrition during fetal life. We expose the contribution of the lactation period in modulating the expression of Agt and Pparg, relevant genes associated with cardiac hypertrophy.

This study aimed to delve into the individual and combined prophylactic effects of Vitamin C (Vit C) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) against inflammatory heart injury in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced polymicrobial sepsis rat model. Thirty adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: Control, CLP, Vitamin C, CoQ10, and Vit C\u2009+\u2009CoQ10, each consisting of six rats. Treatments were administered orally via gavage for 10\u00a0days prior to the operation. Eighteen hours post-sepsis induction, the animals were euthanized, and specimens were collected for analysis. The study examined variations in oxidative (TOS, OSI, MDA, MPO) and antioxidative markers (TAS, SOD, CAT, GSH), histopathological changes, inflammatory cytokine concentrations (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), nitric oxide (NO) dynamics, and cardiac indicators such as CK-MB. Impressively, the combined regimen markedly diminished oxidative stress, and antioxidative parameters reflected notable enhancements. Elevated NO levels, a central player in sepsis-driven inflammatory cascades, were effectively tempered by our intervention. Histological examinations corroborated the biochemical data, revealing diminished cardiac tissue damage in treated subjects. Furthermore, a marked suppression in pro-inflammatory cytokines was discerned, solidifying the therapeutic potential of our intervention.

{"title": "Persistent immune responses in the heart determine the outcome of cardiomyopathy syndrome in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).", "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) caused by piscine myocarditis virus (PMCV) is a severe cardiac disease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the Norwegian aquaculture industry. Previous research suggest a variation in individual susceptibility to develop severe disease, however the role of the immune response in determining individual outcome of CMS is poorly understood particularly in cases where fish are also challenged by stress. The present study's aim was therefore to characterize cardiac transcriptional responses to PMCV infection in Atlantic salmon responding to infection under stressful conditions with a high versus low degree of histopathological damage. The study was performed as a large-scale controlled experiment of Atlantic salmon smolts from pre-challenge to 12 weeks post infection (wpi) with PMCV, during which fish were exposed to intermittent stressors. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was used to compare the heart transcriptome of high responders (HR) with atrium histopathology score '4' and low responders (LR) with score '0.5' at 12 wpi. A high-throughput quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was used to compare immune gene transcription between individuals sampled at 6, 9 and 12 wpi. Based on RNAseq and qPCR results, RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed for visualization of IFN-\u03b3 - and IFNb producing immune cells in affected heart tissue. Compared to LR, the transcription of 1592 genes was increased in HR at 12 wpi. Of these genes, around. 40\u00a0% were immune-related, including various chemokines, key antiviral response molecules, and genes. associated with a Th1 pro-inflammatory immune response. Further, the qPCR analysis confirmed. increased immune gene transcription in HR at both 9 and 12 wpi, despite a decrease in PMCV. transcription between these time points. Interestingly, increased IFNb transcription in HR suggests the. presence of high-quantity IFN secreting cells in the hearts of these individuals. Indeed, RNAscope. confirmed the presence of IFN-\u03b3 and IFNb-positive cells in the heart ventricle of HR but not LR. To conclude, our data indicate that in severe outcomes of PMCV infection various chemokines attract leucocytes to the salmon heart, including IFN-\u03b3 and IFNb-secreting cells, and that these cells play important roles in maintaining persistent antiviral responses and a sustained host immunopathology despite decreasing heart viral transcription.", "journal": "Fish & shellfish immunology", "date": "2024-02-08", "authors": ["BaojianSun", "Marco AVindas", "SimonaKavaliauskiene", "H\u00e5vardBj\u00f8rgen", "Erling OlafKoppang", "HeleneWisl\u00f8ff", "MichaelFrisk", "HegeLund", "Ida BJohansen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109404"}

The decrease in SCAD protein and mRNA expression levels in SHR CFs were in accordance with those in the left ventricular myocardium of SHR. In addition, SCAD expression was downregulated in CFs treated with Ang II in vitro, and SCAD siRNA interference induced the same changes in cardiac fibrosis as Ang II-treated CFs, while Ad-SCAD treatment significantly reduced the Ang II-induced CFs proliferation, \u03b1-SMA and collagen expression. In SHR infected with Ad-SCAD, the cardiac fibrosis of the left ventricle was significantly decreased. On the other hand, cardiac fibrosis occurred in conventional SCAD knockout mice.

{"title": "Engineered Gold and Silica Nanoparticle-Incorporated Hydrogel Scaffolds for Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Electrically conductive biomaterials and nanomaterials have demonstrated great potential in the development of functional and mature cardiac tissues. In particular, gold nanomaterials have emerged as promising candidates due to their biocompatibility and ease of fabrication for cardiac tissue engineering utilizing rat- or stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs). However, despite significant advancements, it is still not clear whether the enhancement in cardiac tissue function is primarily due to the electroconductivity features of gold nanoparticles or the structural changes of the scaffold resulting from the addition of these nanoparticles. To address this question, we developed nanoengineered hydrogel scaffolds comprising gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) embedded with either electrically conductive gold nanorods (GNRs) or nonconductive silica nanoparticles (SNPs). This enabled us to simultaneously assess the roles of electrically conductive and nonconductive nanomaterials in the functionality and fate of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Our studies revealed that both GNR- and SNP-incorporated hydrogel scaffolds exhibited excellent biocompatibility and similar cardiac cell attachment. Although the expression of sarcomere alpha-actinin did not significantly differ among the conditions, a more organized sarcomere structure was observed within the GNR-embedded hydrogels compared to the nonconductive nanoengineered scaffolds. Furthermore, electrical coupling was notably improved in GNR-embedded scaffolds, as evidenced by the synchronous calcium flux and enhanced calcium transient intensity. While we did not observe a significant difference in the gene expression profile of human cardiac tissues formed on the conductive GNR- and nonconductive SNP-incorporated hydrogels, we noticed marginal improvements in the expression of some calcium and structural genes in the nanomaterial-embedded hydrogel groups as compared to the control condition. Given that the cardiac tissues formed atop the nonconductive SNP-based scaffolds (used as the control for conductivity) also displayed similar levels of gene expression as compared to the conductive hydrogels, it suggests that the electrical conductivity of nanomaterials (i.e., GNRs) may not be the sole factor influencing the function and fate of hiPSC-derived cardiac tissues when cells are cultured atop the scaffolds.

Left anterior descending coronary artery ligation was performed on cardiac-specific Rap1GAP conditional knockout (Rap1GAP-CKO) mice and control mice with MI. Seven days after MI, Rap1GAP expression in the hearts of control mice peaked, the expression of proapoptotic markers (Bax and cleaved caspase-3) increased, the expression of antiapoptotic factors (Bcl-2) decreased, and the expression of the inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 increased; thus, apoptosis occurred, inflammation, infarct size, and left ventricular dysfunction increased, while the heart changes caused by MI were alleviated in Rap1GAP-CKO mice. Mouse heart tissue was obtained for transcriptome sequencing, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. We found that Rap1GAP was associated with the AMPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and that Rap1GAP inhibited AMPK/SIRT1 and activated the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in model animals. Similar results were observed in primary rat myocardial cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to induce ischemia and hypoxia. Activating AMPK with the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) reversed the damage caused by Rap1GAP overexpression in cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Geometry and length control of 3D engineered heart tissues using direct laser writing.", "abstract": "Geometry and mechanical characteristics of the environment surrounding the Engineered Heart Tissues (EHT) affect their structure and function. Here, we employed a 3D tissue culture platform fabricated using two-photon direct laser writing with a high degree of accuracy to control parameters that are relevant to EHT maturation. Using this platform, we first explore the effects of geometry based on two distinct shapes: a rectangular seeding well with two attachment sites, and a stadium-like seeding well with six attachment sites that are placed symmetrically along hemicylindrical membranes. The former geometry promotes uniaxial contraction of the tissues; the latter additionally induces diagonal fiber alignment. We systematically increase the length of the seeding wells for both configurations and observe a positive correlation between fiber alignment at the center of the EHTs and tissue length.

In the second step, we optimize the stiffness of the seeding wells and modify some of the attachment sites of the platform and the seeding parameters to achieve tissue stability for each length and geometry.

{"title": "Chia seeds ameliorate cardiac disease risk factors via alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation in rats fed high-fat diet.", "abstract": "Obesity upsurges the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, primarily heart failure and coronary heart disease. Chia seeds have a high concentration of dietary fiber and increased concentrations of anti-inflammatoryand antioxidant compounds. They are used for weight loss plus enhancing blood glucose and lipid profile. The current perspective was commenced to examine the protective influence of chia seeds ingestion on cardiovascular disease risk factors in high-fat diet-fed rats. Forty male albino rats (with an initial body weight of 180-200 g) were used in this study. Rats were randomly and equally divided into 4 groups: Group I was the control group and group II was a control group with chia seeds supplementation. Group III was a high-fat diet group (HFD) that received HFD for 10 weeks and group IV was fed on HFD plus chia seeds for 10 weeks. In all groups Echocardiographic measurements were performed, initial and final BMI, serum glucose, AC/TC ratio, lipid profile, insulin (with a computed HOMA-IR), creatinine phosphokinase-muscle/brain (CPK-MB), CRP, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and MAP were estimated. Whole heart weight (WHW) was calculated, and then WHW/body weight (BW) ratio was estimated. Eventually, a histopathological picture of cardiac tissues was performed to assess the changes in the structure of the heart under Haematoxylin and Eosin and Crossmon's trichrome stain. Ingestion of a high diet for 10 weeks induced a clear elevation in BMI, AC/ TC, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, CRP, CPK-MB, and cTnI in all HFD groups. Moreover, there was a significant increase in MAP, left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD). Furthermore, histological cardiac examination showed structural alteration of the normal structure of the heart tissue with an increase in collagen deposition. Also, the Bcl-2 expression in the heart muscle was significantly lower, but Bax expression was significantly higher. Chia seeds ingestion combined with HFD noticeably ameliorated the previously-recorded biochemical biomarkers, hemodynamic and echocardiography measures, and histopathological changes. Outcomes of this report reveal that obesity is a hazard factor for cardiovascular disease and chia seeds could be a good candidate for cardiovascular system protection.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2024-02-06", "authors": ["MohamedAref", "Eman MahmoudFaragAllah", "Nehal I AGoda", "Mohammed HAbu-Alghayth", "Mosleh MAbomughaid", "Heba HMahboub", "Khairiah MubarakAlwutayd", "Hadeel AElsherbini"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-41370-4\n10.3389/fnut.2022.828522\n10.1155/2018/3407306\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000018121.67607.CE\n10.1007/s13679-016-0235-6\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.02.029\n10.1001/jama.292.20.2471\n10.4161/cc.7.5.5529\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.09.003\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000160199.51158.cf\n10.3390/nu2121266\n10.4162/nrp.2017.11.5.412\n10.12691/jfnr-2-5-9\n10.1590/1809-4503201400050021\n10.1007/s13197-015-1967-0\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.002\n10.2337/dc07-1144\n10.1038/ejcn.2009.159\n10.1089/acm.2011.0443\n10.1002/fsn3.3035\n10.1002/oby.20330\n10.1089/jmf.2017.4129\n10.1111/jfbc.12986\n10.1258/002367707779399518\n10.1590/1516-3180.2018.0209050618\n10.1016/0014-2999(77)90307-7\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.02.072\n10.1155/2017/3762651\n10.1016/j.exger.2006.06.003\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.1992.tb01830.x\n10.1093/ajcn/85.2.399\n10.1093/clinchem/28.10.2077\n10.1093/clinchem/18.6.499\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.9.839\n10.1016/0003-4975(95)00129-9\n10.1039/C7RA09136B\n10.1016/j.taap.2018.12.020\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2006.00188.x\n10.1186/s12888-014-0349-x\n10.3390/nu6115153\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.171016\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.05.017\n10.3305/nh.2015.31.3.8242\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.753483\n10.1038/clpt.2012.149\n10.1016/j.metabol.2008.06.014\n10.1038/35073608\n10.1111/j.1529-8027.2009.00237.x\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2008.03.009\n10.3390/nu11061242\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.021\n10.1016/j.jcjd.2013.08.183\n10.1016/j.numecd.2016.11.124\n10.4314/ijbcs.v14i5.20\n10.3945/jn.111.147447\n10.1038/ejcn.2013.103\n10.1039/C3FO60688K\n10.1017/S000711450899053X\n10.1042/CS20070456\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000052314.95497.78\n10.1097/00004872-200412000-00019\n10.1177/0260106020981819\n10.1016/j.lwt.2012.07.017\n10.1017/S0007114515003098\n10.5650/jos.56.347\n10.1080/07315724.2010.10719898\n10.1046/j.1523-5408.2002.00513.x\n10.1016/j.abb.2006.05.005\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000199800.72563.26\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.107821\n10.1124/jpet.107.135061\n10.1016/j.mce.2009.11.011\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.04.089\n10.1056/NEJM199408183310701\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.3.778\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a008963\n10.1016/j.jep.2019.112266\n10.1002/clc.23155\n10.1186/s12986-017-0200-8\n10.1113/JP276747\n10.1152/ajpheart.00554.2011\n10.1001/jama.2010.1768\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.005264\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.07.079\n10.1039/D0FO03206A\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000120390.68287.BB\n10.1186/s12944-018-0829-y\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148117\n10.18632/aging.100459\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00037.2008\n10.1007/s10741-007-9079-1\n10.1002/cncr.10876"}

Nevertheless, the fate of hUC-MSCs in the body remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the biodistribution, homing and clearance of systemically administered hUC-MSCs in healthy BALB/c mice model.\nhUC-MSCs were labelled with GFP-Luc2 protein, followed by characterisation with flow cytometry. Upon intravenous infusion of transduced hUC-MSCs into the healthy BALB/c mice, the cells were dynamically monitored through the bioluminescent imaging (BLI) approach.\nTransduction of hUC-MSCs with GFP-Luc2 not only preserved the characteristics of MSCs, but also allowed live monitoring of transduced cells in the mice model. Upon systemic administration, BLI showed that transduced hUC-MSCs first localised predominantly in the lungs of healthy BALB/c mice and mainly remained in the lungs for up to 3 days before eventually cleared from the body.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether SacVal is effective in reducing the occurrence of AF in heart failure and identify the underlying mechanism of its electrophysiological effect in mice.\nAdult male mice underwent transverse aortic constriction, followed by SacVal, valsartan, or vehicle treatment for two weeks. Electrophysiological study (EPS) and optical mapping were performed to assess the susceptibility to AF and the atrial conduction properties, and fibrosis was investigated using heart tissue and isolated cardiac fibroblasts (CFs).\nEPS analysis revealed that AF was significantly less inducible in SacVal-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. Optical mapping of the atrium showed that SacVal-treated and valsartan-treated mice restored the prolonged action potential duration (APD); however, only SacVal-treated mice showed the restoration of decreased conduction velocity (CV) compared to vehicle-treated mice. In addition, the electrophysiological distribution analysis demonstrated that heterogeneous electrophysiological properties were rate-dependent and increased heterogeneity was closely related to the susceptibility to AF. SacVal attenuated the increased heterogeneity of CV at short pacing cycle length in atria, whereas Val could not. Histological and molecular evaluation showed that SacVal exerted the anti-fibrotic effect on the atria.

{"title": "Progress in cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration: Implications of gelatin-based hybrid scaffolds.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, particularly myocardial infarction (MI), remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current treatments for MI, more palliative than curative, have limitations in reversing the disease completely. Tissue engineering (TE) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this challenge and may lead to improved therapeutic approaches for MI. Gelatin-based scaffolds, including gelatin and its derivative, gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), have attracted significant attention in cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) due to their optimal physical and biochemical properties and capacity to mimic the native extracellular matrix (ECM). CTE mainly recruits two classes of gelatin/GelMA-based scaffolds: hydrogels and nanofibrous. This article reviews state-of-the-art gelatin/GelMA-based hybrid scaffolds currently applied for CTE and regenerative therapy. Hybrid scaffolds, fabricated by combining gelatin/GelMA hydrogel or nanofibrous scaffolds with other materials such as natural/synthetic polymers, nanoparticles, protein-based biomaterials, etc., are explored for enhanced cardiac tissue regeneration functionality. The engraftment of stem/cardiac cells, bioactive molecules, or drugs into these hybrid systems shows great promise in cardiac tissue repair and regeneration.

{"title": "ISG15 blocks cardiac glycolysis and ensures sufficient mitochondrial energy production during Coxsackievirus B3 infection.", "abstract": "Virus infection triggers inflammation and, may impose nutrient shortage to the heart. Supported by type I interferon (IFN) signaling, cardiomyocytes counteract infection by various effector processes, with the IFN-stimulated gene of 15\u2005kDa (ISG15) system being intensively regulated and protein modification with ISG15 protecting mice Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection. The underlying molecular aspects how the ISG15 system affects the functional properties of respective protein substrates in the heart are unknown.\nBased on the protective properties due to protein ISGylation, we set out a study investigating CVB3-infected mice in depth and found cardiac atrophy with lower cardiac output in ISG15-/- mice. By mass spectrometry, we identified the protein targets of the ISG15 conjugation machinery in heart tissue and explored how ISGylation affects their function. The cardiac ISGylome showed a strong enrichment of ISGylation substrates within glycolytic metabolic processes. Two control enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, hexokinase 2 (HK2) and phosphofructokinase muscle form (PFK1), were identified as bona fide ISGylation targets during infection. In an integrative approach complemented with enzymatic functional testing and structural modeling, we demonstrate that protein ISGylation obstructs the activity of HK2 and PFK1. Seahorse-based investigation of glycolysis in cardiomyocytes revealed that, by conjugating proteins, the ISG15 system prevents the infection-/IFN-induced upregulation of glycolysis. We complemented our analysis with proteomics-based advanced computational modeling of cardiac energy metabolism. Our calculations revealed an ISG15-dependent preservation of the metabolic capacity in cardiac tissue during CVB3 infection. Functional profiling of mitochondrial respiration in cardiomyocytes and mouse heart tissue by Seahorse technology showed an enhanced oxidative activity in cells with a competent ISG15 system.\nOur study demonstrates that ISG15 controls critical nodes in cardiac metabolism.

Two doses of BAY 73-6691 (1\u00a0mg/kg/day and 5\u00a0mg/kg/day) were given for 95\u00a0days.\u00a0The 5/6Nx rats developed albuminuria, a decrease in serum creatinine clearance (Ccr), and elevated serum troponin T levels. Echocardiographic data showed that 5/6 nephrectomy resulted in increased fractional shortening (FS), stroke volume (SV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). However, 95\u00a0days of PDE9 inhibitor treatment did not improve any cardiac and renal functional parameter. Histopathologically, 5/6 nephrectomy resulted in severe kidney and heart damage, such as renal interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and enlarged cardiomyocytes. Telmisartan attenuated renal interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis as well as improved cardiomyocyte size.

This study investigates the potential protective effects of selenium (Se) supplementation against cardiac damage induced by HFCS. Thirty-two male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups: control, CS (20%-HFCS), CS with Se (20%-HFCS, 0.3\u00a0mg/kg-Se), and Se (0.3\u00a0mg/kg-Se) only. After a 6-week period, heart and aorta tissues were collected for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic analyses. HFCS consumption led to severe cardiac pathologies, increased oxidative stress, and altered gene expressions associated with inflammation, apoptosis, and antioxidant defenses. In the CS group, pronounced oxidative stress within the cardiac tissue was concomitant with elevated Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression and diminished expressions of B-cell-lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1-\u03b1), and silenced information regulator 1 (SIRT1). Se supplementation mitigated these effects, showing protective properties. Immunohistochemical analysis supported these findings, demonstrating decreased expressions of caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1\u03b2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the CS\u2009+\u2009Se group compared to the CS group.

Although these traumatic injuries are treated as if they are independent, there is epidemiological evidence linking the incidence of Fx and MI, thus raising the question of whether each of these events can actively influence the risk of the other. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, the chronic conditions leading to MI and Fx, are known to have shared pathoetiology. Furthermore, sustained systemic inflammation after traumas such as MI and Fx has been shown to exacerbate both underlying chronic conditions.

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the complement system initiate a systemic response after MI that could lead to subsequent changes in bone remodeling through osteoclasts. Similarly, SNS and complement system activation following fracture could lead to heart tissue damage and exacerbate atherosclerosis.

However, the time-varying characteristics of intracardiac channel pose major challenges. As such, mastering the dynamic conduction properties of the intracardiac channel and modeling the equivalent time-varying channel are imperative for realizing LCP multi-chamber pacing. In this paper, we present a limiting volume variational approach based on the electrical properties of cardiac tissues and trends in chamber volume variation. This approach was used to establish a quasi-static and a continuous time-varying equivalent circuit model of an intracardiac channel. An equivalence analysis was conducted on the model, and a discrete time-varying equivalent circuit phantom grounded on the cardiac cycle was subsequently established. Moreover, an ex vivo cardiac experimental platform was developed for verification. Results indicate that in the frequency domain, the congruence between phantom and ex vivo experimental outcomes is as high as 94.3%, affirming the reliability of the equivalent circuit model. In the time domain, the correlation is up to 75.3%, corroborating its effectiveness.

In this study, the function of CHKB-DT in DCM was determined.\nLong noncoding RNA expression levels in the human heart tissues were measured via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization assays. A CHKB-DT heterozygous or homozygous knockout mouse model was generated using the clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 system, and the adeno-associated virus with a cardiac-specific promoter was used to deliver the RNA in vivo. Sarcomere shortening was performed to assess the primary cardiomyocyte contractility. The Seahorse XF cell mitochondrial stress test was performed to determine the energy metabolism and ATP production. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms were explored using quantitative proteomics, ribosome profiling, RNA antisense purification assays, mass spectrometry, RNA pull-down, luciferase assay, RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and Western blotting.\nCHKB-DT levels were remarkably decreased in patients with DCM and mice with transverse aortic constriction-induced heart failure. Heterozygous knockout of CHKB-DT in cardiomyocytes caused cardiac dilation and dysfunction and reduced the contractility of primary cardiomyocytes. Moreover, CHKB-DT heterozygous knockout impaired mitochondrial function and decreased ATP production as well as cardiac energy metabolism. Mechanistically, ALDH2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 2) was a direct target of CHKB-DT. CHKB-DT physically interacted with the mRNA of ALDH2 and fused in sarcoma (FUS) through the GGUG motif.

{"title": "Modeling mutation-specific arrhythmogenic phenotypes in isogenic human iPSC-derived cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Disease modeling using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients with genetic disease is a powerful approach for dissecting pathophysiology and drug discovery. Nevertheless, isogenic controls are required to precisely compare phenotypic outcomes from presumed causative mutations rather than differences in genetic backgrounds. Moreover, 2D cellular models often fail to exhibit authentic disease phenotypes resulting in poor validation in vitro. Here we show that a combination of precision gene editing and bioengineered 3D tissue models can establish advanced isogenic hiPSC-derived cardiac disease models, overcoming these drawbacks. To model inherited cardiac arrhythmias we selected representative N588D and N588K missense mutations affecting the same codon in the hERG potassium channel gene KCNH2, which are reported to cause long (LQTS) and short (SQTS) QT syndromes, respectively. We generated compound heterozygous variants in normal hiPSCs, and differentiated cardiomyocytes (CMs) and mesenchymal cells (MCs) to form 3D cardiac tissue sheets (CTSs). In hiPSC-derived CM monolayers and 3D CTSs, electrophysiological analysis with multielectrode arrays showed prolonged and shortened repolarization, respectively, compared to the isogenic controls. When pharmacologically inhibiting the hERG channels, mutant 3D CTSs were differentially susceptible to arrhythmic events than the isogenic controls.

MR activation, in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), worsens cardiac function, and increase NHE activity contributing to the deleterious process. In contrast, effects of GR activation are not fully understood, probably because of the controversial scenario generated by using different doses or potencies of corticosteroids.\nWe tested the hypothesis that an acute dose of hydrocortisone (HC), a low-potency glucocorticoid, in a murine model of AMI could be cardioprotective by regulating NHE1 activity, leading to a decrease in oxidative stress.\nIsolated hearts from Wistar rats were subjected to regional ischemic protocol. HC (10\u2009nmol/L) was added to the perfusate during early reperfusion. Infarct size and oxidative stress were determined. Isolated papillary muscles from non-infarcted hearts were used to evaluate HC effect on sodium-proton exchanger 1 (NHE1) by analysing intracellular pH recovery from acute transient acidosis.\nHC treatment decreased infarct size, improved cardiac mechanics, reduced oxidative stress after AMI, while restoring the decreased level of the pro-fusion mitochondrial protein MFN-2. Co-treatment with the GR-blocker Mifepristone avoided these effects. HC reduced NHE1 activity by increasing the NHE1 pro-inhibiting Ser648 phosphorylation site and its upstream kinase AKT. HC restored the decreased AKT phosphorylation and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein expression detected after AMI.\nOur results provide the first evidence that acute HC treatment during early reperfusion induces cardioprotection against AMI, associated with a non-genomic HC-triggered NHE1 inhibition by AKT and antioxidant action that might involves mitochondrial dynamics improvement.", "journal": "European journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2024-01-31", "authors": ["Daiana SEscudero", "Juliana CFantinelli", "Valeria RMart\u00ednez", "Luisa FGonz\u00e1lez Arbel\u00e1ez", "Mar\u00eda EAmarillo", "N\u00e9stor GP\u00e9rez", "Romina GD\u00edaz"], "doi": "10.1111/eci.14172"}

While acute hypoxic exposure leads to a reversible acclimatization in heart tissue with normal systemic oxygen supply, chronic hypoxia exacerbates cardiac dysfunction, leads to a destruction of the tissue. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane vesicles that act as mediators of intercellular communication. EVs are secreted by different cell types and those produced by oral cavity-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including human gingival MSCs (hGMSCs), have pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and showed therapeutic role in tissue regeneration. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the potential protective and regenerative role of EVs produced by hGMSCs, in an ", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2024-01-30", "authors": ["YleniaDella Rocca", "FrancescaDiomede", "Fan\u00ecKonstantinidou", "OrianaTrubiani", "ThangaveluSoundara Rajan", "Sante DPierdomenico", "ValentinaGatta", "LiborioStuppia", "Guya DilettaMarconi", "JacopoPizzicannella"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2023.1260019\n10.5551/jat.RV17009\n10.1038/s41572-020-0151-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072278\n10.1016/s0002-9343(00)00481-2\n10.1155/2022/7608712\n10.1073/pnas.90.1.347\n10.1042/CS20120151\n10.1186/s13046-016-0320-4\n10.3389/fgene.2020.00582\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1661-0_1\n10.1007/s00441-016-2461-3\n10.1186/s13287-017-0600-8\n10.1007/s13105-022-00912-6\n10.1186/s13036-019-0193-0\n10.3390/biomedicines10020403\n10.3390/ma13010130\n10.3390/cells8070727\n10.1038/nrd3978\n10.3390/ijms23084135\n10.1016/j.devcel.2022.01.012\n10.1172/JCI24408\n10.1111/jcmm.17803\n10.1016/j.addr.2021.113961\n10.1155/2019/4236973\n10.3390/biom12070883\n10.1097/MOL.0b013e3283307be8\n10.1007/5584_2020_599\n10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.46.120604.141046\n10.1186/s13287-018-0791-7\n10.3390/biology12040498\n10.1186/bcr3693\n10.2217/rme.11.35\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.03.001\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4402047\n10.3892/ijmm.2018.3700\n10.1515/med-2021-0258\n10.1093/nar/gky985\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.1038/s41392-022-01080-1\n10.3390/antiox11020386\n10.3390/biology10090931\n10.1155/2021/6679708\n10.3389/fphys.2021.676512\n10.1161/01.cir.74.5.1124\n10.1093/alcalc/agw098\n10.22203/eCM.v041a32\n10.1073/pnas.97.2.529\n10.1152/ajpregu.00419.2015\n10.3390/ijms20133256\n10.1083/jcb.201211138\n10.1074/jbc.272.36.22642\n10.1038/s41580-020-0230-3\n10.3390/genes11020118\n10.1186/1742-2094-9-33\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00263\n10.1007/s00018-013-1290-8\n10.1016/j.scr.2011.01.001\n10.1177/1721727x1201000109\n10.1177/039463201202500310\n10.1152/ajpheart.00554.2011\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.10.103\n10.1016/j.pain.2009.02.001\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aav8521\n10.1016/j.jot.2019.10.012\n10.3402/jev.v4.27066\n10.1155/2020/5107193\n10.1080/07391102.2019.1580616\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.161\n10.1186/s12951-021-00808-5\n10.3892/etm.2018.6789"}

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a crucial mechanism for gene expression regulation and has been implicated in postnatal heart development. Nonetheless, whether microbiota can influence postnatal heart development through the regulation of APA remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted APA sequencing on heart tissues collected from specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice and germ-free (GF) mice at three different developmental stages: within the first 24\u00a0h after birth (P1), 7-day-old SPF mice, and 7-day-old GF mice. This approach allowed us to obtain a comprehensive genome-wide profile of APA sites in the heart tissue samples. In this study, we made a significant observation that GF mice exhibited noticeably longer 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) lengths.

{"title": "GCN5L1-mediated acetylation prevents Rictor degradation in cardiac cells after hypoxic stress.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis are the leading causes of mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease. As such, these processes represent potential therapeutic targets to treat heart failure resulting from ischemic insult. We previously demonstrated that the mitochondrial acetyltransferase protein GCN5L1 regulates cardiomyocyte cytoprotective signaling in ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo and hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in vitro. The current study investigated the mechanism underlying GCN5L1-mediated regulation of the Akt/mTORC2 cardioprotective signaling pathway. Rictor protein levels in cardiac tissues from human ischemic heart disease patients were significantly decreased relative to non-ischemic controls. Rictor protein levels were similarly decreased in cardiac AC16 cells following hypoxic stress, while mRNA levels remained unchanged. The reduction in Rictor protein levels after hypoxia was enhanced by the knockdown of GCN5L1, and was blocked by GCN5L1 overexpression. These findings correlated with changes in Rictor lysine acetylation, which were mediated by GCN5L1 acetyltransferase activity. Rictor degradation was regulated by proteasomal activity, which was antagonized by increased Rictor acetylation. Finally, we found that GCN5L1 knockdown restricted cytoprotective Akt signaling, in conjunction with decreased mTOR abundance and activity. In summary, these studies suggest that GCN5L1 promotes cardioprotective Akt/mTORC2 signaling by maintaining Rictor protein levels through enhanced lysine acetylation.", "journal": "Cellular signalling", "date": "2024-01-29", "authors": ["ParameshaBugga", "Janet RManning", "Bellina A SMushala", "Michael WStoner", "JohnSembrat", "IainScott"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2024.111065"}

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a major signaling network that plays a pro-homeostatic role in the central and peripheral organs of the human body. A class of minor lipids, N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), which do not activate cannabinoid receptors, except for anandamide, but can potentiate the action of endocannabinoids and have a wide spectrum of biological activity and significant adaptogenic potential, belongs to ECS. The results of different studies over the past decades have established the protective effect of NAE on many pathological conditions.\nThis study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of C18:0 NAE-Nstearoylethanolamine (NSE) in aged rats.\nIn this study, we focused on investigating the effects of C18:0 NAE-Nstearoylethanolamine (NSE) on the intensity of oxidative/nitrosative stress, antioxidant potential, lipoprotein profile and inflammation markers of blood plasma, phospholipid composition and age-related morphological changes of old rat heart tissues.\nThe study was conducted on Sprague Dawley male laboratory rats.

{"title": "Interplay of Angiotensin Peptides, Vasopressin, and Insulin in the Heart: Experimental and Clinical Evidence of Altered Interactions in Obesity and Diabetes Mellitus.", "abstract": "The present review draws attention to the specific role of angiotensin peptides [angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)], vasopressin (AVP), and insulin in the regulation of the coronary blood flow and cardiac contractions. The interactions of angiotensin peptides, AVP, and insulin in the heart and in the brain are also discussed. The intracardiac production and the supply of angiotensin peptides and AVP from the systemic circulation enable their easy access to the coronary vessels and the cardiomyocytes. Coronary vessels and cardiomyocytes are furnished with AT1 receptors, AT2 receptors, Ang (1-7) receptors, vasopressin V1 receptors, and insulin receptor substrates. The presence of some of these molecules in the same cells creates good conditions for their interaction at the signaling level. The broad spectrum of actions allows for the engagement of angiotensin peptides, AVP, and insulin in the regulation of the most vital cardiac processes, including (1) cardiac tissue oxygenation, energy production, and metabolism; (2) the generation of the other cardiovascular compounds, such as nitric oxide, bradykinin (Bk), and endothelin; and (3) the regulation of cardiac work by the autonomic nervous system and the cardiovascular neurons of the brain. Multiple experimental studies and clinical observations show that the interactions of Ang II, Ang(1-7), AVP, and insulin in the heart and in the brain are markedly altered during heart failure, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, especially when these diseases coexist. A survey of the literature presented in the review provides evidence for the belief that very individualized treatment, including interactions of angiotensins and vasopressin with insulin, should be

{"title": "Current evidence regarding the cellular mechanisms associated with cancer progression due to cardiovascular diseases.", "abstract": "Several large cohort studies in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients have shown an increased incidence of cancer. Previous studies in a myocardial infarction (MI) mouse model reported increased colon, breast, and lung cancer growth. The potential mechanisms could be due to secreted cardiokines and micro-RNAs from pathological hearts and immune cell reprogramming. A study in a MI-induced heart failure (HF) mouse demonstrated an increase in cardiac expression of SerpinA3, resulting in an enhanced proliferation of colon cancer cells. In MI-induced HF mice with lung cancer, the attenuation of tumor sensitivity to ferroptosis via the secretion of miR-22-3p from cardiomyocytes was demonstrated. In MI mice with breast cancer, immune cell reprogramming toward the immunosuppressive state was shown. However, a study in mice with renal cancer reported no impact of MI on tumor growth. In addition to MI, cardiac hypertrophy was shown to promote the growth of breast and lung cancer. The cardiokine potentially involved, periostin, was increased in the cardiac tissue and serum of a cardiac hypertrophy model, and was reported to increase breast cancer cell proliferation. Since the concept that CVD could influence the initiation and progression of several types of cancer is quite new and challenging regarding future therapeutic and preventive strategies, further studies are needed to elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms which will enable more effective risk stratification and development of potential therapeutic interventions to prevent cancer in CVD patients.", "journal": "Journal of translational medicine", "date": "2024-01-27", "authors": ["TanawatAttachaipanich", "Siriporn CChattipakorn", "NiponChattipakorn"], "doi": "10.1186/s12967-023-04803-2\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.3322/caac.21660\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244\n10.1161/JAHA.119.013754\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.04.053\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.04.088\n10.1002/ejhf.472\n10.1002/ejhf.1539\n10.1007/s10654-017-0231-5\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2021.11.007\n10.1002/ehf2.13421\n10.1186/s12872-018-0932-z\n10.1097/00001648-199803000-00013\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.01.069\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020406\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030816\n10.1038/s41591-020-0964-7\n10.1038/s41392-023-01336-4\n10.1002/cac2.12185\n10.1038/s41568-022-00459-0\n10.1038/s41568-019-0149-1\n10.1136/heartjnl-2013-305402\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.046471\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-2463\n10.3390/cells11071108\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.756889\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.08.034\n10.1002/ehf2.13659\n10.1007/s12471-014-0584-2\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.000255\n10.1186/s12014-017-9147-z\n10.1002/1097-0142(19951015)76:8<1368::AID-CNCR2820760812>3.0.CO;2-N\n10.1007/s10620-018-5137-x\n10.1007/s12282-021-01221-4\n10.1038/s41374-019-0288-8\n10.1136/hrt.49.1.26\n10.2459/JCM.0000000000000937\n10.3390/cancers11091306\n10.18632/oncotarget.3964\n10.1074/mcp.M112.017384\n10.1038/bjc.2014.490\n10.3892/ijo.2017.3962\n10.1007/s00395-017-0659-5\n10.1093/cvr/cvr067\n10.3892/mmr.2016.5308\n10.1084/jem.20071297\n10.1038/s41598-022-26035-y\n10.1002/ehf2.13675\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.07.038\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.09.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088755\n10.3389/fonc.2018.00225\n10.1007/s11033-009-9721-1\n10.1128/MCB.24.9.3992-4003.2004\n10.1016/S1535-6108(04)00081-9\n10.3892/or.2016.5095\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-625\n10.5009/gnl15481\n10.1186/1471-2407-10-273\n10.18632/oncotarget.13004\n10.1016/j.ejso.2013.06.023\n10.1023/A:1021899904332\n10.1007/s12265-010-9169-7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.04.004\n10.1159/000350117\n10.1038/nature07511\n10.1093/cvr/cvp015\n10.1074/jbc.M109.027896\n10.1159/000479995\n10.3892/mmr.2017.7575\n10.3390/genes11020164\n10.3892/br.2016.747\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.03.003\n10.1159/000481648\n10.1007/s11010-012-1443-3\n10.3892/or.2012.1645\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210856\n10.1186/1756-9966-29-29\n10.3892/or.2015.4360\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0137\n10.1128/MCB.00479-08\n10.1053/j.gastro.2007.05.022\n10.1097/MD.0000000000007952\n10.1073/pnas.0510565103\n10.1007/s10585-010-9355-7\n10.1002/jso.22008\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605608\n10.1007/s13277-011-0154-9\n10.1016/j.tcm.2014.07.005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300682\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.813576\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.07.739\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.02.078\n10.1002/jcla.23020\n10.3389/fgene.2022.936937\n10.1097/MD.0000000000004418\n10.3892/ijo.2016.3811\n10.1007/s00432-012-1194-2\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605895\n10.1186/s12943-017-0751-3\n10.1016/j.omtn.2021.01.016\n10.18632/oncotarget.5636\n10.1126/scisignal.2000594\n10.1007/s12032-012-0233-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0066165\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.026\n10.3389/fmed.2022.881788\n10.1007/s00432-016-2248-7"}
{"title": "Levocabastine ameliorates cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity in Swiss albino mice: Targeting TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide (CP), although a potent anti-cancer drug, causes cardiotoxicity as a side effect that limits its use. Hence, a specific medicine that can lower cardiotoxicity and be utilised as an adjuvant in cancer treatment is very much needed. In this light, we intended to assess the protective potential of levocabastine (LEV) on CP-induced cardiotoxicity in Swiss albino mice. Mice were administered LEV (50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14\u00a0days and CP at 200\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneally once on the 7th day. On the 15th day, mice were weighed, blood withdrawn then sacrificed and hearts were removed to estimate various biochemical and histopathological parameters. CP 200\u00a0mg/kg significantly increased cardiac troponin T, LDH, CK-MB, interleukin-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, TBARS, nitrite, and decreased CAT, GSH, and SOD levels, thus, manifested cardiac damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and nitrative stress, cumulatively causing cardiotoxicity. CP also elevated the expression of various markers including cleaved caspase-3, NF-\u03baB, TLR4, NLRP3, and fibrotic lesions in cardiac tissues, whereas decreased hematological parameters (RBCs, platelets, and Hb) to confirm cardiotoxicity. LEV and fenofibrate (FF) treatment reversed these changes towards normal and showed a significant protective effect against CP. The results showed the protective role of LEV in restoring CP-induced cardiotoxicity in terms of inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cardiac injury and histopathological damage. Thus, levocabastine can be used as an adjuvant to cyclophosphamide in cancer treatment but a thorough study with various animal cancer models is further needed to establish the fact.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2024-01-27", "authors": ["WasimAkram", "Abul KalamNajmi", "M MumtazAlam", "Syed EhtaishamulHaque"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2024.116838"}

{"title": "Cichoric acid improves isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis via inhibition of HK1/NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated signaling pathways by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.", "abstract": "Cichoric acid (CA), a natural phenolic compound found in many plants, has been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and other effects. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role and underlying mechanisms of CA in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial fibrosis (MF). The MF model was induced by subcutaneous ISO injection in mice. Blood and heart tissue were collected for examination. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson's trichrome staining were used to evaluate the histopathological changes and collagen deposition. The production of reactive oxygen species markers was observed by fluorescence microscopy, the degree of cardiomyocyte microstructure injury was observed by transmission electron microscope, and oxidative stress factors were detected by kit method, and the effect of CA on inflammatory factors was detected by ELISA.

Public data sets GSE19339, GSE97320 and GSE141512 were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Datasets public database. After data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes were screened, and differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes associated with myocardial infarction were obtained. The biological function and signaling pathway enrichment analysis were performed to establish the PPI interaction network specific to heart tissue, and the differential diagnosis significance of differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes associated with myocardial infarction was analyzed by ROC curve and decision tree model.A total of 317 genes showed significant changes in expression levels in patients with myocardial infarction, including 205 down-regulated genes and 112 up-regulated genes.Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and functional classification of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways showed that these genes were mainly involved in signaling pathways or biological functions related to inflammation and apoptosis.Five differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (SLC2A3, EPAS1, HMOX1, ATM, FANCD2) were obtained, all of which played key biological functions in cardiac tissue function. SLC2A3, EPAS1, HMOX1, ATM and FANCD2 genes all had good diagnostic value for myocardial infarction (P < 0.05). The increase of SLC2A3, EPAS1 and HMOX1 are risk factors for myocardial infarction, while ATM and FANCD2 are protective factors.Decision tree analysis showed that SLC2A3, HMOX1, ATM, FANCD2 gene had higher net yield in diagnosing myocardial infarction. In summary, the mechanism of ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and progression of myocardial infarction.

This study aims to investigate the possible protective effects of misoprostol (MS) against the damage that arises from paclitaxel (PT), an anti-cancer pharmacological agent, in the rat heart using histopathological and biochemical analyses.\nIn this study, four groups, each containing seven animals, were formed by random selection from 28 Sprague Dawley female rats. Control group rats were administered 1\u00a0ml of normal saline orally and intraperitoneally (i.p.) for six days. While the PT group rats were administered PT at a dose of 2\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 0, 2, 4, and 6, the MS group was administered MS at a dose of 0.2\u00a0mg/kg in 1\u00a0ml normal saline by oral gavage for six days.

This recently developed bioprinting modality illuminates a dynamically evolving light pattern into a rotating volume of the bioink, and thus decouples the requirement of mechanical strengths of bioprinted hydrogel constructs with printability, allowing for the fabrication of sophisticated shapes and architectures with low-concentration dECM materials that set within tens of seconds. As exemplary applications, cardiac tissues are volumetrically bioprinted using the cardiomyocyte-laden h-dECM bioink showing favorable cell proliferation, expansion, spreading, biomarker expressions, and synchronized contractions; whereas the volumetrically bioprinted Ms-dECM meniscus structures embedded with human mesenchymal stem cells present appropriate chondrogenic differentiation outcomes. This study supplies expanded bioink libraries for volumetric bioprinting and broadens utilities of dECM toward tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2024-01-22", "authors": ["LimingLian", "MaobinXie", "ZeyuLuo", "ZhenruiZhang", "SushilaMaharjan", "XuanMu", "Carlos EzioGarciamendez-Mijares", "XiaoKuang", "Jugal KishoreSahoo", "GuoshengTang", "GangLi", "DiWang", "JieGuo", "Federico ZertucheGonz\u00e1lez", "VictoriaAbril Manjarrez Rivera", "LingCai", "XuanMei", "David LKaplan", "Yu ShrikeZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202304846"}
{"title": "MRAS in coronary artery disease-Unchartered territory.", "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified coronary artery disease (CAD) susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q22.3. This locus contains a cluster of several genes that includes muscle rat sarcoma virus (MRAS). Common MRAS variants are also associated with CAD causing risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type II diabetes. The MRAS gene is an oncogene that encodes a membrane-bound small GTPase. It is involved in a variety of signaling pathways, regulating cell differentiation and cell survival (mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) as well as acute phase response signaling (tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and interleukin 6 [IL6] signaling). In this review, we will summarize the role of genetic MRAS variants in the etiology of CAD and its comorbidities with the focus on tissue distribution of MRAS isoforms, cell type/tissue specificity, and mode of action of single nucleotide variants in MRAS associated complex traits. Finally, we postulate that CAD risk variants in the MRAS locus are specific to smooth muscle cells and lead to higher levels of MRAS, particularly in arterial and cardiac tissue, resulting in MAPK-dependent tissue hypertrophy or hyperplasia.", "journal": "IUBMB life", "date": "2024-01-22", "authors": ["Pashmina WiqarShah", "TobiasReinberger", "SatwatHashmi", "ZouhairAherrahrou", "JeanetteErdmann"], "doi": "10.1002/iub.2805"}
{"title": "Peptide-Guided Nanoparticle Drug Delivery for Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively utilized as a drug delivery system to control the release of therapeutic agents to treat cardiac injuries. However, despite the advantages of utilizing NP-based drug delivery for treating heart diseases, the current delivery system lacks specificity in targeting the cardiac tissue, thus limiting its application.\nWe created three linear peptides, each consisting of 16-24 amino acids. These peptides were conjugated on the surface of NPs, resulting in the formation of cardiac targeting peptide (CTP)-NPs (designated as CTP-NP1, CTP-NP2, and CTP-NP3). To assess their effectiveness, we compared the binding efficiency of these three CTP-NPs to human and mouse cardiomyocytes. Additionally, we determined their distribution 24 h after injecting the CTP-NPs intravenously into adult C57BL/6J mice.\nWhen compared to control NPs without CTP (Con-NPs), all three CTP-NPs exhibited significantly increased binding affinity to both human and mouse cardiomyocytes in vitro and enhanced retention in mouse hearts in vivo. A thorough assessment of the heart sections demonstrated that the binding specificity of CTP-NP3 to cardiomyocytes in vivo was significantly greater than that of Con-NPs. None of the three CTP-NPs were proven to cause cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\nBiocompatible and safe CTP-NP3 can target the heart via binding to cardiomyocytes.

Translationally, the hydrogel templates promoting neo-cardiac tissue formation are currently limited; however, they are highly demanding in cardiac tissue engineering. The current study focused on the development of a panel of four chitosan-based polyelectrolyte hydrogels as cardiac scaffolds facilitating neo-cardiac tissue formation to promote cardiac regeneration. Chitosan-PEG (CP), gelatin-chitosan-PEG (GCP), hyaluronic acid-chitosan-PEG (HACP), and combined CP (CoCP) polyelectrolyte hydrogels were engineered by solvent casting and assessed for physiochemical, thermal, electrical, biodegradable, mechanical, and biological properties. The CP, GCP, HACP, and CoCP hydrogels exhibited excellent porosity (4.24 \u00b1 0.18, 13.089 \u00b1 1.13, 12.53 \u00b1 1.30 and 15.88 \u00b1 1.10 for CP, GCP, HACP and CoCP, respectively), water profile, mechanical strength, and amphiphilicity suitable for cardiac tissue engineering. The hydrogels were hemocompatible as evident from the negligible hemolysis and RBC aggregation and increased adsorption of plasma albumin. The hydrogels were cytocompatible as evident from the increased viability by MTT (>94% for all the four hydrogels) assay and direct contact assay. Also, the hydrogels supported the adhesion, growth, spreading, and proliferation of H9c2 cells as unveiled by rhodamine staining. The hydrogels promoted neo-tissue formation that was proven using rat and swine myocardial tissue explant culture. Compared to GCP and CoCP, CP and HACP were superior owing to the cell viability, hemocompatibility, and conductance, resulting in the highest degree of cytoskeletal organization and neo-tissue formation.

However, the survival and function of transplanted stem cells is poor and remains a major challenge for the development of effective therapies. As two main cell types currently under investigation in heart repair, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) indirectly support endogenous regenerative capacities after transplantation, while induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) functionally integrate into the damaged myocardium and directly contribute to the restoration of its pump function. These two cell types are exposed to a common microenvironment with many stressors in ischemic heart tissue.

DNMT3A inactivation amplifies the release of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, thereby facilitating activation of cardiac fibroblasts.

{"title": "Widely distributable and retainable in-situ gelling material for treating myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Intramyocardial hydrogel injection is a promising therapy to prevent negative remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). In this study, we report a mechanism for in-situ gel formation without external stimulation, resulting in an injectable and tissue-retainable hydrogel for MI treatment, and investigate its therapeutic outcomes. A liquid-like polymeric solution comprising poly(3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid-co-acrylamide) (BAAm), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and sorbitol (S) increases the viscous modulus by reducing the pre-added sorbitol concentration is developed. This solution achieves a sol-gel transition in-vitro in heart tissue by spontaneously diffusing the sorbitol. After intramyocardial injection, the BAAm/PVA/S with lower initial viscous modulus widely spreads in the myocardium and gelate compared to a viscoelastic alginate (ALG) hydrogel and is retained longer than the BAAm/S solution. Serial echocardiogram analyses prove that injecting the BAAm/PVA/S into the hearts of subacute MI rats significantly increases the fraction shortening and ejection shortening and attenuates the expansion of systolic LV diameter for up to 21 d after injection compared to the saline injection as a control, but the ALG injection does not. In addition, histological evaluation shows that only the BAAm/PVA/S decreases the infarct size and increases the wall thickness 21 d after injection. The BAAm/PVA/S intramyocardial injection is better at restraining systolic ventricular dilatation and cardiac failure in the rat MI model than in the control groups. Our findings highlight an effective injectable hydrogel therapy for MI by optimizing injectability-dependent distribution and retention of injected material. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In-situ gelling material is a promising strategy for intramyocardial hydrogel injection therapy for myocardial infarction (MI). Since the sol-gel transition of reported materials is driven by external stimulation such as temperature, pH, or ultraviolet, their application in vivo remains challenging. In this study, we first reported a synthetic in-situ gelling material (BAAm/PVA/S) whose gelation is stimulated by spontaneously reducing pre-added sorbitol after contacting the heart tissue. The BAAm/PVA/S solution spreads evenly, and is retained for at least 21 d in the heart tissue. Our study demonstrated that intramyocardial injection of the BAAm/PVA/S with more extensive distribution and longer retention had better effects on preventing LV dilation and improving cardiac function after MI than that of viscoelastic ALG and saline solution. We expect that these findings provide fundamental information for the optimum design of injectable biomaterials for treating MI.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2024-01-20", "authors": ["Hue ThiLe", "AtsushiMahara", "KyokoFukazawa", "TakeshiNagasaki", "TetsujiYamaoka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2024.01.013"}
{"title": "The protective effect of Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction on reno-cardiac damage induced by DOCA-salt and unilateral renal artery ligation in rats.", "abstract": "To date, the complex pathological interactions between renal and cardiovascular systems represent a real global epidemic in both developed and developing countries. In this context, renovascular hypertension (RVH) remains among the most prevalent, but also potentially reversible, risk factor for numerous reno-cardiac diseases in humans and pets. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and reno-cardiac protective effects of a polyphenol-rich fraction of bergamot (BPF) in an experimental model of hypertension induced by unilateral renal artery ligation. Adult male Wistar rats underwent unilateral renal artery ligation and treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) (20\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.), twice a week for a period of 4 weeks, and 1% sodium chloride (NaCl) water (n\u00a0=\u00a010). A subgroup of hypertensive rats received BPF (100\u00a0mg/kg/day for 28 consecutive days, n\u00a0=\u00a010) by gavage. Another group of animals was treated with a sub-cutaneous injection of vehicle (that served as control, n\u00a0=\u00a08). Unilateral renal artery ligation followed by treatment with DOCA and 1% NaCl water resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; p<\u00a00.05. vs CTRL) which strongly increased the resistive index (RI; p<0.05 vs CTRL) of contralateral renal artery flow and kidney volume after 4 weeks (p<0.001 vs CTRL). Renal dysfunction also led to a dysfunction of cardiac tissue strain associated with overt dyssynchrony in cardiac wall motion when compared to CTRL group, as shown by the increased time-to-peak (T2P; p<0.05) and the decreased whole peak capacity (Pk; p<0.01) in displacement and strain rate (p<0.05, respectively) in longitudinal motion. Consequently, the hearts of RAL DOCA-Salt rats showed a larger time delay between the fastest and the lowest region (Maximum Opposite Wall Delay-MOWD) when compared to CTRL group (p<0.05 in displacement and p\u00a0<0.01 in strain rate). Furthermore, a significant increase in the levels of the circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (p<\u00a00.05 for IL-12(40), p<\u00a00.01 for GM-CSF, KC, IL-13, and TNF- \u03b1) and in the NGAL expression of the ligated kidney (p<\u00a00.001) was observed compared to CTRL group. Interestingly, this pathological condition is prevented by BPF treatment. In particular, BPF treatment prevents the increase of blood pressure in RAL DOCA-Salt rats (p<\u00a00.05) and exerts a protective effect on the volume of the contralateral kidney (p\u00a0<0.01). Moreover, BPF ameliorates cardiac tissue strain dysfunction by increasing Pk in displacement (p\u00a0<0.01) and reducing the T2P in strain rate motion (p<0.05). These latter effects significantly improve MOWD (p\u00a0<0.05) preventing the overt dyssynchrony in cardiac wall motion. Finally, the reno-cardiac protective effect of BPF was associated with a significant reduction in serum level of some pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (p<0.05 for KC and IL-12(40), p<0.01 for GM-CSF, IL-13, and TNF- \u03b1) restoring physiological levels of renal neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL, p<0.05) protein of the tethered kidney.

{"title": "Adipose Signals Regulating Distal Organ Health and Disease.", "abstract": "Excessive adiposity in obesity is a significant risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other cardiometabolic diseases. An unhealthy expansion of adipose tissue (AT) results in reduced adipogenesis, increased adipocyte hypertrophy, adipocyte hypoxia, chronic low-grade inflammation, increased macrophage infiltration, and insulin resistance. This ultimately culminates in AT dysfunction characterized by decreased secretion of antidiabetic adipokines such as adiponectin and adipsin and increased secretion of proinflammatory prodiabetic adipokines including RBP4 and resistin. This imbalance in adipokine secretion alters the physiological state of AT communication with target organs including pancreatic \u03b2-cells, heart, and liver. In the pancreatic \u03b2-cells, adipokines are known to have a direct effect on insulin secretion, gene expression, cell death, and/or dedifferentiation. For instance, impaired secretion of adipsin, which promotes insulin secretion and \u03b2-cell identity, results in \u03b2-cell failure and T2D, thus presenting a potential druggable target to improve and/or preserve \u03b2-cell function. The cardiac tissue is affected by both the classic white AT-secreted adipokines and the newly recognized brown AT (BAT)-secreted BATokines or lipokines that alter lipid deposition and ventricular function. In the liver, adipokines affect hepatic gluconeogenesis, lipid accumulation, and insulin sensitivity, underscoring the importance of adipose-liver communication in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In this perspective, we outline what is currently known about the effects of individual adipokines on pancreatic \u03b2-cells, liver, and the heart.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2024-01-19", "authors": ["AnkitGilani", "LisaStoll", "Edwin AHoman", "James CLo"], "doi": "10.2337/dbi23-0005"}
{"title": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy dysfunction mimicked in human engineered heart tissue and improved by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy, often caused by pathogenic sarcomere mutations. Early characteristics of HCM are diastolic dysfunction and hypercontractility. Treatment to prevent mutation-induced cardiac dysfunction is lacking. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a group of antidiabetic drugs that recently showed beneficial cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acquired forms of heart failure. We here studied if SGLT2i represent a potential therapy to correct cardiomyocyte dysfunction induced by an HCM sarcomere mutation.\nContractility was measured of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) harbouring an HCM mutation cultured in 2D and in 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT). Mutations in the gene encoding \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (MYH7-R403Q) or cardiac troponin T (TNNT2-R92Q) were investigated. In 2D, intracellular [Ca2+], action potential and ion currents were determined. HCM mutations in hiPSC-CMs impaired relaxation or increased force, mimicking early features observed in human HCM. SGLT2i enhance the relaxation of hiPSC-CMs, to a larger extent in HCM compared to control hiPSC-CMs. Moreover, SGLT2i-effects on relaxation in R403Q EHT increased with culture duration, i.e. hiPSC-CMs maturation. Canagliflozin's effects on relaxation were more pronounced than empagliflozin and dapagliflozin. SGLT2i acutely altered Ca2+ handling in HCM hiPSC-CMs. Analyses of SGLT2i-mediated mechanisms that may underlie enhanced relaxation in mutant hiPSC-CMs excluded SGLT2, Na+/H+ exchanger, peak and late Nav1.5 currents, and L-type Ca2+ current, but indicate an important role for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Indeed, electrophysiological measurements in mutant hiPSC-CM indicate that SGLT2i altered Na+/Ca2+ exchange current.\nSGLT2i (canagliflozin > dapagliflozin > empagliflozin) acutely enhance relaxation in human EHT, especially in HCM and upon prolonged culture.

{"title": "Direct differentiation of rat skin fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the major cardiovascular diseases caused by diminished supply of nutrients and oxygen to the heart due to obstruction of the coronary artery. Different treatment options are available for cardiac diseases, however, they do not completely repair the damage. Therefore, reprogramming terminally differentiated fibroblasts using transcription factors is a promising strategy to differentiate them into cardiac like cells in vitro and to increase functional cardiomyocytes and reduce fibrotic scar in vivo. In this study, skin fibroblasts were selected for reprogramming because they serve as a convenient source for the autologous cell therapy. Fibroblasts were isolated from skin of rat pups, propagated, and directly reprogrammed towards cardiac lineage. For reprogramming, two different approaches were adopted, i.e., cells were transfected with: (1) combination of cardiac transcription factors; GATA4, MEF2c, Nkx2.5 (GMN), and (2) combination of cardiac transcription factors; GATA4, MEF2c, Nkx2.5, and iPSC factors; Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc (GMNO). After 72\u00a0h of transfection, cells were analyzed for the expression of cardiac markers at the mRNA and protein levels. For in vivo study, rat MI models were developed by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery and the reprogrammed cells were transplanted in the infarcted heart. qPCR results showed that the reprogrammed cells exhibited significant upregulation of cardiac genes. Immunocytochemistry analysis further confirmed cardiomyogenic differentiation of the reprogrammed cells. For the assessment of cardiac function, animals were analyzed via echocardiography after 2 and 4 weeks of cell transplantation. Echocardiographic results showed that the hearts transplanted with the reprogrammed cells improved ejection fraction, fractional shortening, left ventricular internal systolic and diastolic dimensions, and end systolic and diastolic volumes. After 4 weeks of cell transplantation, heart tissues were harvested and processed for histology. The histological analysis showed that the reprogrammed cells improved wall thickness of left ventricle and reduced fibrosis significantly as compared to the control. It is concluded from the study that novel combination of cardiac transcription factors directly reprogrammed skin fibroblasts and differentiated them into cardiomyocytes. These differentiated cells showed cardiomyogenic characters in vitro, and reduced fibrosis and improved cardiac function in vivo. Furthermore, direct reprogramming of fibroblasts transfected with cardiac transcription factors showed better regeneration of the injured myocardium and improved cardiac function as compared to the indirect approach in which combination of cardiac and iPSC factors were used.

Rats were divided into four x-ray (XR) irradiation groups with different absorbed doses (0/10/15/20\u2009Gy), or into three groups (control, XR, and XR\u2009+\u2009NG groups). Subsequently, the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus was adopted to assess and compare the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), left ventricular internal diameter at end diastole (LVIDd), and left ventricular internal diameter at end systole (LVIDs) in rats. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Masson staining were applied to detect the pathological damage and fibrosis of heart tissue. Western blot was used to measure the expression levels of myocardial fibrosis-related proteins, endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, and Sirt1 (silent information regulator 1)/NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-B) signaling pathway-related proteins in cardiac tissues. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to detect the activities of pro-inflammatory cytokines, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in cardiac tissue. The results showed that NG treatment significantly attenuated the 20\u2009Gy XR-induced decline of LVEF and LVFS and the elevation of LVIDs. Cardiac tissue damage and fibrosis caused by 20\u2009Gy XR were significant improved after NG treatment. Meanwhile, in rats irradiated by XR, marked downregulation was identified in the expressions of fibrosis-related proteins (Col I, collagen type I; \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin; and TGF-\u03b21, transforming growth factor-beta 1) and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins (GRP78, glucose regulatory protein 78; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; and caspase 12) after NG treatment. Moreover, NG treatment also inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u03b2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)], reduced the expression of MDA, and promoted the activities of SOD and CAT. Also, NG treatment promoted Sirt1 expression and inhibited p65 phosphorylation. Collectively, XR irradiation induced cardiac injury in rats in a dose-dependent manner.

We first detected the levels of chemokines in heart tissue that recruited immune cells infiltrating into the heart, and found that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) released by mouse cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (MCMECs) peaked at 6\u2009h after reperfusion, and c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) released by GMCSF-induced macrophages peaked at 24\u2009h after reperfusion. In co-culture of BMDMs with MCMECs, we demonstrated that GMCSF derived from MCMECs stimulated the release of CCL2 by BMDMs and effectively promoted the migration of BMDMs. We also confirmed that GMCSF promoted M1 polarization of macrophages in vitro, while GMCSF neutralizing antibodies (NTABs) blocked CCL2/CCR2 signaling.

Four-dimensional (4D) printing is an emerging technology that is expected to revolutionize the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM). 4D printing is based on 3D printing, featuring the introduction of time as the fourth dimension, in which there is a transition from a 3D printed scaffold to a new, distinct, and stable state, upon the application of one or more stimuli. Here, we present an overview of the current developments of the 4D printing technology for TERM, with a focus on approaches to achieve temporal changes of the shape of the printed constructs that would enable biofabrication of highly complex structures. To this aim, the printing methods, types of stimuli, shape-shifting mechanisms, and cell-incorporation strategies are critically reviewed. Furthermore, the challenges of this very recent biofabrication technology as well as the future research directions are discussed.

For shape-memory mechanism, there is a high prevalence of synthetic materials, such as polylactic acid (PLA), poly(glycerol dodecanoate) acrylate (PGDA), or polyurethanes.

{"title": "Fast creation of data-driven low-order predictive cardiac tissue excitation models from recorded activation patterns.", "abstract": "Excitable systems give rise to important phenomena such as heat waves, epidemics and cardiac arrhythmias. Understanding, forecasting and controlling such systems requires reliable mathematical representations. For cardiac tissue, computational models are commonly generated in a reaction-diffusion framework based on detailed measurements of ionic currents in dedicated single-cell experiments. Here, we show that recorded movies at the tissue-level of stochastic pacing in a single variable are sufficient to generate a mathematical model. Via exponentially weighed moving averages, we create additional state variables, and use simple polynomial regression in the augmented state space to quantify excitation wave dynamics.

Traditional medication and physical therapies are widely used, but generally suffer problems in serious physical damage and high surgical risks. Flexible and soft implants have great potential to be a novel approach for heart diseases therapy. We develope a conductive hydrogel-based mesh cardiac patch for application in AF elimination. The designed mesh patch with rhombic-shaped structure exhibits excellent flexibility, surface conformability, and deformation compliance, making it fit well with heart surface and accommodate to the deformation during heart beating. Moreover, the mechanical elastic and shape-memory properties of the mesh patch enable a minimally invasive injection of the patch into living animals. The mesh patch is implanted on the atrium surface for one month, indicating good biocompatibility and stability. Furthermore, the conductive patch can effectively eliminate atrial fibrillation owing to the conductivity and high charge storage capability (CSC) of the hydrogel. The proposed scheme of cardiac bioelectric signal modulation using conductive hydrogel brings new possibility for the treatment of arrhythmia diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are antidiabetic drugs showing benefits in patients with HF, despite the underlying mechanisms have not been completely understood yet. SGLT2i are supposed to promote systemic effects, such as triglycerides mobilization, through the enhancement of fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) activity. So, in this study, we\u00a0evaluated the effects of dapagliflozin treatment on FGF-21 and related receptors (FGF-Rs) gene expression and on lipid content in myocardial tissue in an animal model of genetically induced obesity to unravel possible metabolic mechanisms accounting for the cardioprotection of SGLT2i.\nSix-week-old C57BL/6J wild-type mice and B6.V-LEP (ob/ob) mice were randomly assigned to the control or treatment group (14 animals/group). Treatment was based on the administration of dapagliflozin 0.15\u00a0mg/kg/day for 4\u00a0weeks. The gene expression of FGF-21 and related receptors (FGF-R1, FGF-R3, FGF-R4, and \u03b2-klotho co-receptor) was assessed at baseline and after treatment by real-time PCR. Similarly, cardiac triglycerides concentration was measured in the control group and treated animals.\nAt baseline, FGF-21 mRNA expression in the heart did not differ between lean and obese ob/ob mice. Dapagliflozin administration significantly increased heart FGF-21 gene expression, but only in ob/ob mice (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Consistently, when measuring the amount of triglycerides in the cardiac tissue, SGLT2i treatment reduced the lipid content in obese ob/ob mice, while no significant effects were observed in treated lean animals (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The overall expression of the FGF-21 receptors was only minimally affected by dapagliflozin treatment both in obese ob/ob mice and in lean controls.\nDapagliflozin administration\u00a0increases FGF-21gene expression and reduces triglyceride content in myocardial tissue of ob/ob mice, while no significant effect was observed in lean controls. These results might help understand the cardiometabolic effects of SGLT2i inducing increased FGF-21 synthesis while reducing lipid content in cardiomyocytes as a possible expression of the switch to different energy substrates.

{"title": "Gene correction and overexpression of TNNI3 improve impaired relaxation in engineered heart tissue model of pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Research on cardiomyopathy models using engineered heart tissue (EHT) created from disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is advancing rapidly. However, the study of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), a rare and intractable cardiomyopathy, remains at the experimental stage because there is currently no established method to replicate the hallmark phenotype of RCM, particularly diastolic dysfunction, in vitro. In this study, we generated iPSCs from a patient with early childhood-onset RCM harboring the TNNI3 R170W mutation (R170W-iPSCs). The properties of R170W-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) and EHTs were evaluated and compared with an isogenic iPSC line in which the mutation was corrected. Our results indicated altered calcium kinetics in R170W-iPSC-CMs, including prolonged tau, and an increased ratio of relaxation force to contractile force in R170W-EHTs. These properties were reversed in the isogenic line, suggesting that our model recapitulates impaired relaxation of RCM, i.e., diastolic dysfunction in clinical practice. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type TNNI3 in R170W-iPSC-CMs and -EHTs effectively rescued impaired relaxation. These results highlight the potential efficacy of EHT, a modality that can accurately recapitulate diastolic dysfunction in vitro, to elucidate the pathophysiology of RCM, as well as the possible benefits of gene therapies for patients with RCM.", "journal": "Development, growth & differentiation", "date": "2024-01-09", "authors": ["MoyuHasegawa", "KenjiMiki", "TakujiKawamura", "IkueTakei Sasozaki", "YukiHigashiyama", "MasaruTsuchida", "KunioKashino", "MasakiTaira", "EmikoIto", "MakiTakeda", "HidekazuIshida", "ShuichiroHigo", "YasushiSakata", "ShigeruMiyagawa"], "doi": "10.1111/dgd.12909"}

{"title": "Identification of Reduced mTOR T1262 Phosphorylation as a Novel Mechanism and Therapeutic Target of Apoptosis in Senescent Cardiomyocytes: Aging and Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis.", "abstract": "The mechanisms through which aging increases heart injury remain partially understood. Protein phosphorylation plays a critical regulatory role in cell survival and death. Using an unbiased phosphoproteomics approach, we aimed to identify the proteins whose phosphorylation could be causatively related to aging-related cardiomyocyte apoptosis and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Comparative phosphoproteomics was conducted on cardiac tissues obtained from young (8 weeks) and aged (24 months) mice. Our findings revealed that the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin phosphorylation at T1262 (mTORT1262) was reduced in the aging heart. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses confirmed these findings in aging myocardia and D-galactose-induced senescent AC16 cardiomyocytes. In hypoxia/reoxygenation cardiomyocytes, mTORT1262 phosphorylation deficiency (mTORT1262A, lentivirus-mediated transfection) inhibited AKT1, suppressed NF-\u03baB, activated FOXO1/3a signaling, and ultimately exacerbated apoptosis. Conversely, mTORT1262 pseudophosphorylation (mTORT1262E) exhibited opposite effects. Through bioinformatics and CO-IP, purinergic receptor P2X4 (P2X4R) was found to be the possible receptor responsible for mTORT1262 phosphorylation. Knockdown of P2X4R increased apoptosis, whereas its overexpression decreased it. In senescent cardiomyocytes, P2X4R expression and mTORT1262 and AKT1S473 phosphorylation were reduced, NF-\u03baB signaling was suppressed, and FOXO1/3a signaling was activated. We demonstrated that P2X4R downregulation and the subsequent reduction of mTORT1262 phosphorylation is a novel mechanism contributing to cardiomyocyte apoptosis in aging hearts.

The study was conducted to inquire into the protective effect of 4-methylumbilliferon (4-MU) against MI/R in rats and clarify its potential underlying mechanism. Animals were divided into four groups (n\u2009=\u200915) including sham, MI/R, MI/R\u2009+\u2009vehicle, and MI/R\u2009+\u20094-MU. MI/R was established in Wistar rats by occluding the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 30\u00a0min. 4-MU (25\u00a0mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally before the induction of reperfusion. Cardiac function, fibrosis, oxidant/antioxidant markers, and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated using echocardiography, ELISA, and Western blot assay. As a result of MI/R induction, a decrease in left ventricular contractile function occurred along with increased cardiac fibrosis and tissue damage. The serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 increased, while IL-10 decreased. Oxidant/antioxidant changes were evident with increased MDA levels and decreased GSH, SOD, and CAT in the MI/R group. Furthermore, the protein levels of TLR4, NF-\u03baB, and NLRP3 were significantly increased in the heart tissue of MI/R group. Treatment with 4-MU significantly prevented the reduction of cardiac contractile function and its pathological changes as a result of MI/R by inhibiting the increase of serum inflammatory factors and improving the oxidant/antioxidant balance probably through the TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 axis.

{"title": "Evaluation of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Loaded Injectable Hydrogels for Improving Connexin43 Gap Junction Intercellular Communication.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death in the developed world, and the loss of cardiomyocytes plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Implicated in this process is a decrease in gap junction intercellular communication due to remodeling of Connexin43 (Cx43). We previously identified that intraperitoneal injection of the Pyk2 inhibitor PF4618433 reduced infarct size, maintained Cx43 at the intercalated disc in left ventricle hypertrophic myocytes, and improved cardiac function in an MI animal model of heart failure. With the emergence of injectable hydrogels as a therapeutic toward the regeneration of cardiac tissue after MI, here, we provide proof of concept that the release of tyrosine kinase inhibitors from hydrogels could have beneficial effects on cardiomyocytes. We developed an injectable hydrogel consisting of thiolated hyaluronic acid and P123-maleimide micelles that can incorporate PF4618433 as well as the Src inhibitor Saracatinib and achieved sustained release (of note, Src activates Pyk2). Using neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in the presence of a phorbol ester, endothelin-1, or phenylephrine to stimulate cardiac hypertrophy, the release of PF4618433 from the hydrogel had the same ability to decrease Cx43 tyrosine phosphorylation and maintain Cx43 localization at the plasma membrane as when directly added to the growth media. Additional beneficial effects included decreases in apoptosis, the hypertrophic marker atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and serine kinases upregulated in hypertrophy. Finally, the presence of both PF4618433 and Saracatinib further decreased the level of ANP and apoptosis than each inhibitor alone, suggesting that a combinatorial approach may be most beneficial.

{"title": "Exogeneous metal ions as therapeutic agents in cardiovascular disease and their delivery strategies.", "abstract": "Metal ions participate in many metabolic processes in the human body, and their homeostasis is crucial for life. In cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the equilibriums of metal ions are frequently interrupted, which are related to a variety of disturbances of physiological processes leading to abnormal cardiac functions. Exogenous supplement of metal ions has the potential to work as therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CVDs. Compared with other therapeutic drugs, metal ions possess broad availability, good stability and safety and diverse drug delivery strategies. The delivery strategies of metal ions are important to exert their therapeutic effects and reduce the potential toxic side effects for cardiovascular applications, which are also receiving increasing attention. Controllable local delivery strategies for metal ions based on various biomaterials are constantly being designed. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the positive roles of metal ions in the treatment of CVDs from three aspects: protecting cells from oxidative stress, inducing angiogenesis, and adjusting the functions of ion channels. In addition, we introduced the transferability of metal ions in vascular reconstruction and cardiac tissue repair, as well as the currently available engineered strategies for the precise delivery of metal ions, such as integrated with nanoparticles, hydrogels and scaffolds.", "journal": "Regenerative biomaterials", "date": "2024-01-04", "authors": ["XiaoqianHong", "GeerTian", "YangZhu", "TanchenRen"], "doi": "10.1093/rb/rbad103"}

Forced expression of circPan3 attenuated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, while inhibition of circPan3 aggravated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Mechanistically, circPan3 was an endogenous sponge of miR-320-3p without affecting miR-320-3p levels. It elevated the expression of HSP20 by endogenously interacting with miR-320-3p. In addition, circPan3 was N6-methylated.

In this study, we systematically investigated the regulatory mode of m6A genes in myocardial infarction (MI) by combining bioinformatics analysis of clinical samples with animal experiments. We utilized gene expression data of clinical samples from public databases to examine the expression of m6A genes in heart tissues and found a large difference between the healthy control group and MI group. Subsequently, we established an MI diagnosis model based on the differentially expressed m6A genes using the random forest method. Next, unsupervised clustering method was used to classify all MI samples into two clusters, and the differences in immune infiltration and gene expression between different clusters were compared. We found LRPPRC to be the predominant gene in m6A clustering, and it was negatively correlated with immunoreaction. Through GO enrichment analysis, we found that most differentially expressed genes between the two clusters were profibrotic. By means of WGCNA, we inferred that GJA4 might be a core molecule in the m6A regulatory network of MI.

Cuproptosis is involved in various diseases, although its role in DCM is still unclear. Here, this study aims to investigate the feasibility of using genes related to cuproptosis as diagnostic biomarkers for DCM and the association of their expression with immune infiltration and drug target in cardiac tissue.\nGene expression data from nonfailure (NF) and DCM samples were retrieved from the GEO database. Cuproptosis scores were calculated using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen key modules associated with DCM and cuproptosis. Random forest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were applied to identify signature genes. Finally, immune cell infiltration was assessed using ssGSEA. mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory networks and chemical-drug regulatory networks based on signature genes were analyzed by Cytoscape.\n8 modules were aggregated by WGCNA, among which MEblue was significantly associated with cuproptosis scores and DCM. A diagnostic model made up of six signature genes including SEPTIN1, CLEC11A, ISG15, P3H3, SDSL, and INKA1 was selected. Furthermore, immune infiltration studies showed significant differences between DCM and NF.

{"title": "hsa-miR-548v controls the viscoelastic properties of human cardiomyocytes and improves their relaxation rates.", "abstract": "The impairment of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function with an inadequate increase in myocardial relaxation velocity directly results in lower LV compliance, increased LV filling pressures, and heart failure symptoms. The development of agents facilitating the relaxation of human cardiomyocytes requires a better understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We performed a high-content microscopy-based screening in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) using a library of 2,565 human miRNA mimics and measured relaxation kinetics via high-computing analyses of motion movies. We identified hsa-miR-548v, a primate-specific miRNA, as the miRNA producing the largest increase in relaxation velocities. This positive lusitropic effect was reproduced in engineered cardiac tissues generated with healthy and BRAF T599R mutant hiPSC-CMs and was independent of changes in calcium transients. Consistent with improvements in viscoelastic responses to mechanical stretch, RNA-Seq showed that hsa-miR-548v downregulated multiple targets, especially components of the mechanosensing machinery. The exogenous administration of hsa-miR-548v in hiPSC-CMs notably resulted in a significant reduction of ANKRD1/CARP1 expression and localization at the sarcomeric I-band.

Resveratrol (Res) is a natural non-flavonoid polyphenol that can potentially provide cardiovascular benefits. We aimed to estimate the protective effect of Res on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) and explore whether it was related to attenuating ferroptosis. We established DIC models in C57BL/6\u00a0J mice, H9C2 cardiomyoblasts, and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). We further treated H9C2 cells with RSL3, a ferroptosis agonist, to investigate whether Res exerted protective effects through inhibiting ferroptosis. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) was applied to suppress ferroptosis. Dox treatment caused cardiac dysfunction and resulted in apparent ferroptotic damage in cardiac tissue, involving increased iron accumulation, glutathione depletion, increased expression of ferroptosis-related proteins, and decreased expression of glutathione peroxidase 4, which were alleviated by Fer-1 and Res administration. These findings were also confirmed in Dox-treated H9C2 cells and NRCMs, with Fer-1 and Res effectively attenuating Dox-induced cytotoxicity and ferroptosis. Furthermore, Res protected H9C2 cells from RSL3-induced ferroptotic cell death, and the protective effect was similar to that of Fer-1.

{"title": "STING activation in cardiomyocytes drives hypertrophy-associated heart failure via NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response.", "abstract": "Accumulating evidence highlights the key importance of innate immunity in heart hypertrophy and failure. Though stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an integral innate immunity regulator, whether cardiomyocyte-derived STING driving cardiac hypertrophy and failure has rarely been explored, nor has its underlying mechanism been clarified. Herein, we addressed these two questions through several mouse experiments. Our results revealed that cardiac tissues from patients exhibiting cardiac hypertrophy markedly increased STING expression. Myocardial tissues of mice challenged with angiotensin II (Ang II) or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) also showed that STING was consistently upregulated and activated. Activation of STING by cGAMP or DMXAA resulted in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro, which was abolished by STING knockout. Furthermore, deleting or pharmacologically inhibiting STING attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in TAC or Ang II-treated mice.

Internal metabolism including hepatic detoxification and processes related to heart may also contribute to MDF. Regional heterogeneity in iHg end-members further provided evidence that bioaccumulated Hg origins can be largely influenced by polar water circumstances and foraging behavior.

The molecular mechanisms of aberrant mitochondrial dynamics in diabetes mellitus (DM) are not fully understood. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is thought to be a major regulator of mitochondrial fission. There is lack of studies that examined the relationship between apigenin and Drp1 expression in DM. Thus, the current study aimed to explore the expression of Drp1 in diabetic rats with cardiovascular complications, as well as to appraise the role of apigenin in modulating this expression.\nTwenty-eight adult male albino Wister rats were randomly and equally allocated into four groups: naive, streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic control and two apigenin-injected diabetic groups (early and late). Body weight, heart weight, blood pressure and ECG were recorded. Evaluation of blood glucose level, lipid profile and cardiac functions were measured. Determination of Drp1 mRNA expression, and histological examination of cardiac tissues from the four groups were performed.\nDiabetic control rats developed decrease of body weight, increase of blood pressure, deterioration of the normal ECG pattern and upregulation of Drp1 mRNA expression in cardiac tissues. There was a significant correlation between the relative expression of Drp1 and all examined parameters. Apigenin-injection improved fasting blood glucose, lipid profile and cardiac function indicators (i.e., ECG parameters, CK-MB and troponin) as well as the cardiac histological structure. The decrease of Drp1 expression was more evident with early than with late apigenin-injection, however, without statistical significance.\nIncreased level of Drp1 expression in diabetic rats may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular complications. The changes that occurred in response to apigenin injection highlight its potential ameliorative effect on the diabetic cardiovascular complications and pave the route for further investigations.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2023-12-24", "authors": ["SaraGamal Sherif", "MarwaTarek", "YasmineGamal Sabry", "AzzaHassan Abou Ghalia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2023.148107"}

The infection can cause acute toxoplasmosis and death in susceptible hosts. Bioassay using cats and mice has been the standard for the isolation of T. gondii from infected hosts for the past several decades. However, bioassay is labor-intensive, expensive, and involves using laboratory animals. To search alternative approaches and o work towards replacement of animal experiments, we summarized the key literature and conducted four experiments to isolate T. gondii in vitro by cell culture. A few heart tissue samples from animals with the highest antibody titers in a given collection were used for T. gondii isolation. These experiments included samples from five out of 51 wild ducks, four of 46 wild turkeys, six of 24 white-tailed deer, as well as from six kangaroos that had died with acute toxoplasmosis in a zoo. These experiments resulted in three isolates from five chronically infected wild ducks (60%), four isolates from four chronically infected wild turkeys (100%), one isolate from six chronically infected white-tailed deer (17%), and four isolates from six kangaroos with acute toxoplasmosis (67%). In addition, five isolates from the five chronically infected wild ducks were obtained by bioassay in mice, showing a 100% success rate, which is higher than the 60% rate by direct cell culture. These T. gondii isolates were successfully propagated in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) or Vero cells, and genotyped by multilocus PCR-RFLP markers. The results showed that it is practical to isolate T. gondii directly in cell culture. Although the cell culture approach may not be as sensitive as the bioassay, it does provide an alternative that is simple, cost-effective, ethically more acceptable, and less time-sensitive to isolate T. gondii.

However, most tissue-engineered scaffolds face difficulty in attenuating oxidative stress, maintaining mechanical stability, and regenerating damaged cardiomyocytes. Here, we fabricated elastic cryogels using polyurethane modified with antioxidant gallic acid in its backbone (PUGA) and further coated them with decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) to improve adhesiveness, biocompatibility and hemocompatibility. The scaffold was functionalized with exosomes (EXO) isolated from adipose-derived stem cells having regenerative potential. PUGA-dECM\u00a0+\u00a0EXO was tested in a rat model with induced MI where echocardiography after 8 weeks of implantation showed significant recovery in treatment group. Histological analysis revealed a decrease in fibrosis after application of patch and promotion of angiogenesis with reduced oxidative stress was shown by immunostaining.

The cardioprotective effects were detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining histopathological observations and the detection of myocardial enzymes by kits in serum, peroxidation and antioxidant levels and ATPase activities by kits in the homogenate supernatant, and antioxidant and apoptosis-related protein expression in heart tissue by immunohistochemistry. The pharmacokinetics parameters of the flavonoids in rat plasma were investigated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Molecular docking of the compounds absorbed by the blood with specific proteins was carried out. D. odorifera flavonoids significantly reduced the levels of creatinine kinase, alanine transaminase, nitric oxide, and Hydrogen peroxide, elevated the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and ATPase, significantly reduced the pathological degree of heart tissue and had obvious anti-myocardial ischemia efficacy. Nine out of the 17 flavonoids were detected in rat plasma. The peak concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve values of 3'-O-methylviolanone and sativanone were significantly higher than those of other ingredients. The peak time of most flavonoids (except for Genistein and Pruneion) was lower than 2\u00a0h, while the half-life of elimination of the nine flavonoids ranged from 3.32 to 21.5\u00a0h. The molecular docking results showed that daidzein, dalbergin, formononetin, and genistein had the potential to bind to the target proteins.

In the absence of hypoxia, HIF is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (HIF-PHs). Pharmacological HIF-PH inhibition stabilizes HIF and is being studied as a treatment for anemia. However, like sustained hypoxia, HIF-PH inhibition may increase pulmonary arterial pressure leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to assess the cardiac effects of sustained pharmacological HIF-PH inhibition using multimodal imaging, blood analysis, and histology.\nRats were dosed daily with a pan HIF-PH inhibitor or vehicle for 4\u00a0weeks followed by a 2-week washout period and underwent longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography to simultaneously assess RV and LV function. Blood samples from weeks four and six were analyzed to determine red blood cell composition. Histology was performed on the cardiac tissue from a subset of rats at weeks four and six to assess structural effects.\nImaging revealed that RV ejection fraction was reduced in animals receiving HIF-PH inhibitor and resulted in RV hypertrophy. Interestingly, HIF-PH inhibition had the opposite effect on the left ventricle (LV), increasing contractility measured by LV ejection fraction. LV effects were reversed by week six, while RV effects (functional and structural) were sustained.\nThese opposing cardiac effects of HIF-PH inhibition warrant further study to both understand the potential negative effects on RV structure and function and investigate the therapeutic potential of increased LV contractility for conditions like heart failure.", "journal": "Molecular imaging and biology", "date": "2023-12-07", "authors": ["GainRobinson", "MarkZielstorff", "RaquelSevilla", "AmyVanko", "ChristopherSinz", "MilenkoCicmil", "WeishengZhang", "KimberlyBettano"], "doi": "10.1007/s11307-023-01876-9\n10.1124/mol.106.027029\n10.1096/fj.01-0125com\n10.1021/jm400386j\n10.1056/NEJMoa2035938\n10.1056/NEJMoa2113380\n10.1111/bcp.15055\n10.1159/000518071\n10.1016/j.kisu.2020.12.002\n10.1164/rccm.201302-0302OC\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00643.2013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305109\n10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00274\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105020\n10.2147/DDDT.S175887\n10.1007/s11255-020-02671-z\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01242\n10.1165/rcmb.2020-0023OC\n10.1161/01.RES.16.3.244\n10.1152/japplphysiol.91256.2008\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00185.2012\n10.1128/MCB.00432-13\n10.1161/01.RES.0000197816.63513.27\n10.1161/hc4301.097193\n10.1016/j.ejheart.2005.10.009\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e2bfef\n10.1371/journal.pone.0255022\n10.1056/NEJMoa0907845\n10.1056/NEJMoa1214865"}

{"title": "Mechanism of pro-MMP9 activation in co-culture of pro-inflammatory macrophages and cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "A wide range of cardiac diseases is associated with inflammation. \"Inflamed\" heart tissue is infiltrated with pro-inflammatory macrophages which extensively secrete matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), a regulator of extracellular matrix turnover. As MMP9 is released from macrophages in a latent form, it requires activation. The present study addresses the role of cardiomyocytes in the course of this activation process.\nIn mono- and co-cultures of pro-inflammatory rat macrophages (bone marrow-derived and peritoneal) and cardiomyocytes (H9C2 cell line) gelatin zymography demonstrated that activated macrophages robustly secreted latent pro-MMP9, whereas cardiomyocytes could not produce the enzyme. Co-culturing of the two cell species was critical for pro-MMP9 activation and was also accompanied by processing of cardiomyocyte-secreted pro-MMP2. A cascade of pro-MMP9 activation was initiated on macrophage membrane with pro-MMP2 cleavage. Namely, pro-inflammatory macrophages expressed an active membrane type 1 MMP (MT1MMP), which activated pro-MMP2, which in turn converted pro-MMP9. Downregulation of MT1MMP in macrophages by siRNA abolished activation of both pro-MMP2 and pro-MMP9 in co-culture. In addition, both cell species secreted MMP13 as a further pro-MMP9 activator. In co-culture, activation of pro-MMP13 occurred on membranes of macrophages and was enhanced in presence of active MMP2. Using incubations with recombinant MMPs and isolated macrophage membranes, we demonstrated that while both MMP2 and MMP13 individually had the ability to activate pro-MMP9, their combined action provided a synergistic effect.\nActivation of pro-MMP9 in a co-culture of pro-inflammatory macrophages and cardiomyocytes was the result of a complex interaction of several MMPs on the cell membrane and in the extracellular space.

This study investigated the effects of long-term exposure to sodium fluoride (0, 500, 1000, and 2000\u00a0mg/kg) on the hearts of chickens were investigated. The results showed that an elevated exposure dose of sodium fluoride led to congested cardiac tissue and disrupted myofiber organisation. Sodium fluoride exposure activated the ERS pathways of PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, increasing HSP60 and HSP70 and decreasing HSP90. The NF-\u03baB pathway and the activation of TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS elicited an inflammatory response. BAX, cytc, and cleaved-caspase3 were increased, triggering apoptosis and leading to cardiac injury. The abnormal expression of HSP90 and HSP70 affected the stability and function of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, which are crucial necroptosis markers. HSPs inhibited TNF-\u03b1-mediated necroptosis and apoptosis of the death receptor pathway. Sodium fluoride resulted in heart injury in chickens because of the ERS and variations in HSPs, inducing inflammation and apoptosis. Cardiac-adapted HSPs impeded the activation of necroptosis.

Clinical studies in patients with HFpEF have shown that statins and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may reduce their mortality rate. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of statins on HFpEF remain unknown. In the present study, we examined whether simvastatin administration inhibits the development of cardiac fibrosis in HFpEF model mice. We further examined the contribution of the Smad and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways to the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway in the development of HFpEF.\nHFpEF animals were prepared by feeding C57BL/6 N mice a high-fat diet and providing water containing N[w]-nitro-<sc>l</sc>-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (<sc>l</sc>-NAME) for 15 weeks. Simvastatin (30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was administered orally daily during the experimental period.

Changes in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling proteins in myocardial tissue were examined by Western blotting.\nA high-fat diet and <sc>l</sc>-NAME solution load induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction with cardiac fibrosis. Simvastatin treatment markedly attenuated cardiac fibrosis and reduced cardiac diastolic dysfunction. In addition, simvastatin prevented the increase in phosphorylation levels of Smad (Smad2 and Smad3) and MAPK (c-Raf, Erk1/2) pathway proteins downstream of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor in cardiac tissue.\nOur present study demonstrated that simvastatin attenuated diastolic dysfunction by reducing cardiac fibrosis in HFpEF hearts.

Unfortunately, DIC remains difficult to manage due to an ignorance regarding pathophysiological mechanisms. Our work aimed to evaluate the role of HSP47 in doxorubicin-induced HF, and to explore the molecular mechanisms.\nMice were exposed to multi-intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (DOX, 4mg/kg/week, for 6\u00a0weeks continuously) to produce DIC. HSP47 expression was significantly upregulated in serum and in heart tissue in DOX-treated mice and in isolated cardiomyocytes. Mice with cardiac-specific HSP47 overexpression and knockdown were generated using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAVV9) injection. Importantly, cardiac-specific HSP47 overexpression exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in DIC, while HSP47 knockdown prevented DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, cardiac atrophy and fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we identified that HSP47 directly interacted with IRE1\u03b1 in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we provided powerful evidence that HSP47-IRE1\u03b1 complex promoted TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome and reinforced USP1-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination. Moreover, NLRP3 deficiency in vivo conspicuously abolished HSP47-mediated cardiac atrophy and fibrogenesis under DOX condition.\nHSP47 was highly expressed in serum and cardiac tissue after doxorubicin administration.

Therefore, hiPSC-CMs were differentiated and purified using either lactate-based media or MACS. Global proteomics revealed that lactate-purified hiPSC-CMs displayed a differential phenotype over MACS hiPSC-CMs. hiPSC-CMs were then integrated into 3D hiPSC-ECTs and cultured for 4 weeks. Structurally, there was no significant difference in sarcomere length between lactate and MACS hiPSC-ECTs. Assessment of isometric twitch force and Ca2+ transient measurements revealed similar functional performance between purification methods. High-resolution mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics showed no significant difference in protein pathway expression or myofilament proteoforms.

In this study, a biohybrid scaffold of the decellularized caprine pericardium (DCP) and graphene oxide (GO) was fabricated by an immersion coating technique. The antimicrobial activity of GO was evaluated against Escherichia coli and showed minimum inhibitory concentration at 125\u2009\u03bcg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration at 250\u2009\u03bcg/mL. The presence of GO on the surface of the biohybrid GO-DCP was confirmed through SEM analysis. The existence of glycosaminoglycan, elastin, and collagen in the DCP and GO-DCP was inferred from the FTIR spectra. The biocompatibility of GO-DCP was studied by seeding valvular interstitial cells, and the results show GO coating supports cell adhesion on the serous and fibrous sides of the DCP. Further, the biomechanical response of DCP is unaltered by the presence of GO. In conclusion, GO enhances the biological performance of decellularized pericardium, which can be used in cardiac tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Dynamic control of contractile resistance to iPSC-derived micro-heart muscle arrays.", "abstract": "Many types of cardiovascular disease are linked to the mechanical forces placed on the heart. However, our understanding of how mechanical forces exactly affect the cellular biology of the heart remains incomplete. In vitro models based on cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CM) enable researchers to develop medium to high-throughput systems to study cardiac mechanobiology at the cellular level. Previous models have been developed to enable the study of mechanical forces, such as cardiac afterload. However, most of these models require exogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) to form cardiac tissues. Recently, a system was developed to simulate changes in afterload by grafting ECM-free micro-heart muscle arrays to elastomeric substrates of discrete stiffnesses. In the present study, we extended this system by combining the elastomer-grafted tissue arrays with a magnetorheological elastomeric substrate. This system allows iPSC-CM based micro-heart muscle arrays to experience dynamic changes in contractile resistance to mimic dynamically altered afterload. Acute changes in substrate stiffness led to acute changes in the calcium dynamics and contractile forces, illustrating the system's ability to dynamically elicit changes in tissue mechanics by dynamically changing contractile resistance.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

It has the effects of inducing sweating and dispelling wind. It is a classic medication used for treating external pathogenic factors and viral diseases. However, the therapeutic mechanism of JFG for viral myocarditis needs further clarification.\nThis study aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of JFG on coxsackievirus B3-induced viral myocarditis (VMC), along with the elucidation of its underlying mechanisms.\nC57 BL/6JNifdc mice were divided randomly into several groups: control, model, Jingfang Granule groups (0.23, 0.46, and 0.69\u00a0g/20g, respectively), and a positive group (oseltamivir, 19.33\u00a0mg/kg). Following the establishment of the VMC model, the mice underwent an 8 -week treatment regimen. Pathological alterations in cardiac tissues and inflammatory protein expression were monitored. Differential gene analysis was conducted utilizing transcriptomic techniques. The differential gene mucolipin 1 (Mcoln1) was knocked down by transfection with siRNA in H9C2 cell, and investigative techniques such as immunoblotting, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, JC-1 staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, and mitochondrial stress testing were employed to examine its mechanism of action.\nJFG significantly mitigates the pathological damage observed in the cardiac tissues of CVB3-induced VMC mice and attenuates the expression of inflammatory genes. Subsequently, differentially expressed genes are identified through transcriptomic analysis and validated via PCR. Among these, the upregulation of Mcoln1 promotes autophagy, facilitating the clearance of damaged mitochondria and excessive ROS. This has been substantiated through in vitro experiments. Excessive ROS precipitates a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, instigating cell apoptosis. In accordance with TUNEL staining results, JFG acts to inhibit cell apoptosis. To ascertain whether Mcoln1 is a crucial target for JFG in treating VMC, Mcoln1 was suppressed in H9C2 cells. The suppression of Mcoln1 hinders the elevation in autophagy levels post-JFG treatment, obstructs the enhancement of mitochondrial function, and impedes the clearance of ROS. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of JFG on cell apoptosis is attenuated.\nThe research findings indicate that JFG has a protective effect on CVB3-induced H9C2 cell injury. JFG may exert its effects in VMC treatment by enhancing autophagy to suppress cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, thereby counteracting cell damage.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2023-11-12", "authors": ["BowenSun", "LinLin", "TianYao", "JingchunYao", "GuiminZhang", "YunlunLi", "ChaoLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2023.117396"}

This highlights the significance of assessing the impact of COC on promoting coagulation and endothelial activation in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Sprague Dawley rats.\nTwenty (20) five-weeks-old female Sprague Dawley rats weighing between 150 and 200g were subjected to both LFD and HFD-feeding for 8-weeks to determine its influence on basic metabolic status, hemostatic profile, hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure and heart rate), as well as selected biomarkers of coagulation (tissue factor and D-dimer) and endothelial activation (Von Willebrand factor and nitric oxide). Thereafter HFD-fed animals were treated with receive high dose combined oral contraceptive (HCOC) and low dose combine oral contraceptive (LCOC) for 6 weeks.\nOur results showed that beyond weight gain, HFD-feeding was associated with hyperglycemia, increased mean arterial pressure, and reduced nitric oxide levels when compared with LFD group (p<0.05). Interestingly, treatment with high dose of COC for 6-weeks did not significantly alter atherothrombotic markers (p>0.05). However, this study is not without limitation as regulation of these markers remains to be confirmed within the cardiac tissues or endothelial cells of these animals.\nHFD-feeding orchestrate the concomitant release of pro-coagulants and endothelial activation markers in rats leading to haemostatic imbalance and endothelial dysfunction. Short-term treatment with COC shows no detrimental effects in these HFD-fed rats. Although in terms of clinical relevance, our findings depict the notion that the risk of CVD in association with COC may depend on the dosage and duration of use among other factors especially in certain conditions.

Perturbed sphingolipid metabolism was previously reported in cerebral and renal tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Specific defects related to the synthesis of sphingolipids and to the metabolism of Sphingosine-1-Phospahte (S1P) were exclusively identified in the stroke-prone (SHRSP) with the respect to the stroke-resistant (SHRSR) strain. In this study, we explored any existing perturbation in either protein or gene expression of enzymes involved in the sphingolipid pathways in cardiac tissue from both SHRSP and SHRSR strains, compared to the normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) strain. The two hypertensive rat models showed an overall perturbation of the expression of different enzymes involved in the sphingolipid metabolism in the heart. In particular, whereas the expression of the S1P-metabolizing-enzyme, SPHK2, was significantly reduced in both SHR strains, SGPL1 protein levels were decreased only in SHRSP. The protein levels of S1P receptors 1-3 were reduced only in the cardiac tissue of SHRSP, whereas S1PR2 levels were reduced in both SHR strains. The de novo synthesis of sphingolipids was aberrant in the two hypertensive strains. A significant reduction of mRNA expression of the Sgms1 and Smpd3 enzymes, implicated in the metabolism of sphingomyelin, was found in both hypertensive strains. Interestingly, Smpd2, devoted to sphingomyelin degradation, was reduced only in the heart of SHRSP.

The rapid release of Cur reduced inflammation and apoptosis in the early stages, while the sustained release of rhCol III promoted angiogenesis and cardiac repair in the later stages. In vitro and in vivo results suggested that the multifunctional carrier could effectively improve cardiac function, promote the repair of infarcted tissue, and inhibit ventricular remodeling by reducing cell apoptosis and inflammation, and promoting angiogenesis in the different pathological processes of MI. Therefore, this programmed-release carrier provides a promising protocol for MI therapy.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2023-11-07", "authors": ["WenqiLiu", "ChengHu", "LinyuLong", "ShuyiHe", "WenZhang", "ZhicunWang", "LiYang", "YunbingWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2023.10.056"}

Aconite, a traditional Chinese herb renowned for its cardiovascular benefits, holds promise in treating heart ailments. However, the mechanisms underlying its anti-fibrotic effects, particularly in cardiac fibrosis, remain elusive.\nThis study aims to shed light on aconite's potential as an anti-fibrotic agent and elucidate its mechanisms in a rat model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis.\nBy inducing cardiac fibrosis through ISO injection, the study investigates the role of decoction of white aconite (DWA) in mitigating fibrotic processes. Techniques including metabolomics, RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence were employed to unveil the molecular changes induced by DWA.\nDWA exhibited a remarkable reduction in echocardiographic parameters, cardiac weight increase, myocardial infarction extent, inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition in heart tissue, and serum CK-MB, cTnT, cTnI levels post ISO injection. Metabolomic analysis unveiled DWA's modulation of 27 metabolites, especially in galactose metabolism, addressing metabolic disturbances in cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, DWA suppressed mRNA expression of fibrosis markers (Collagen I, CTGF, TGF-\u03b2), inhibited protein levels of MMP-9, \u03b1-SMA, and Galectin-3, while elevating TIMP1 expression.\nDWA demonstrated potent anti-fibrotic effects by curbing collagen deposition and alleviating metabolic disruptions in cardiac fibrosis via the galactose metabolism pathway, possibly mediated by the Gal-3/TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2023-11-05", "authors": ["ZiweiXing", "ChaoYang", "YaqianFeng", "JunyaoHe", "ChengPeng", "DanLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2023.155112"}

{"title": "MyoLoop: Design, development and validation of a standalone bioreactor for pathophysiological electromechanical in vitro cardiac studies.", "abstract": "Mechanical load is one of the main determinants of cardiac structure and function. Mechanical load is studied in vitro using cardiac preparations together with loading protocols (e.g., auxotonic, isometric). However, such studies are often limited by reductionist models and poorly simulated mechanical load profiles. This hinders the physiological relevance of findings. Living myocardial slices have been used to study load in vitro. Living myocardial slices (LMS) are 300-\u03bcm-thick intact organotypic preparations obtained from explanted animal or human hearts. They have preserved cellular populations and the functional, structural, metabolic and molecular profile of the tissue from which they are prepared. Using a three-element Windkessel (3EWK) model we previously showed that LMSs can be cultured while performing cardiac work loops with different preload and afterload. Under such conditions, LMSs remodel as a function of the mechanical load applied to them (physiological load, pressure or volume overload). These studies were conducted in commercially available length actuators that had to be extensively modified for culture experiments. In this paper, we demonstrate the design, development and validation of a novel device, MyoLoop. MyoLoop is a bioreactor that can pace, thermoregulate, acquire and process data, and chronically load LMSs and other cardiac tissues in vitro. In MyoLoop, load is parametrised using a 3EWK model, which can be used to recreate physiological and pathological work loops and the remodelling response to these.

In a prospective analysis of infants who underwent CMR with tissue mappings, EMB, and genetic testing, the sample was categorized into two groups: those with inflammatory cardiomyopathy and negative genetics (indicative of possible myocarditis) and those with positive genetics (indicative of possible dilated cardiomyopathy). All patients exhibited similar clinical presentations, echocardiographic dysfunction, and elevated troponins and NT-proBNP levels. Additionally, they all\u00a0met the diagnostic criteria for inflammatory cardiomyopathy based on EMB findings (\u226514 mononuclear cells, \u22657 T-lymphocytes/mm2). EMB results unveiled significant differences\u00a0in the presence of inflammation and edema between the two groups, with higher troponin levels correlating with increased inflammation. Notably, when focusing on CMR, neither the classic criteria nor the 2018 Lake Louise criteria (LLC) could effectively differentiate between the two\u00a0groups. Only late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) appeared to be associated with myocarditis in this cohort, while other LLC and tissue mappings did not exhibit a similar correlation. Importantly, there was no observed correlation between the inflammation detected through EMB and CMR.\nThe onset of heart dysfunction in infants can result from either inherited factors or viral infections, both of which may involve inflammation. However, the precise role of EMB and CMR in determining the etiology of such cases remains poorly\u00a0defined. While CMR demonstrates high sensitivity in detecting inflammation, our experience suggests that it may not effectively differentiate between these two groups. A comprehensive diagnostic approach is essential when addressing this challenge, which includes considering EMB (with attention to the number of T-lymphocytes and the presence of oedema), specific CMR criteria, notably LGE and tissue mappings, as well as the identification of viral agents in cardiac tissue and\u00a0troponin levels.

{"title": "Prdm16 mutation determines sex-specific cardiac metabolism and identifies two novel cardiac metabolic regulators.", "abstract": "Mutation of the PRDM16 gene causes human dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy. The PRDM16 protein is a transcriptional regulator that affects cardiac development via Tbx5 and Hand1, thus regulating myocardial structure. The biallelic inactivation of Prdm16 induces severe cardiac dysfunction with post-natal lethality and hypertrophy in mice. The early pathological events that occur upon Prdm16 inactivation have not been explored.\nThis study performed in-depth pathophysiological and molecular analyses of male and female Prdm16csp1/wt mice that carry systemic, monoallelic Prdm16 gene inactivation. We systematically assessed early molecular changes through transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Kinetic modelling of cardiac metabolism was performed in silico with CARDIOKIN. Prdm16csp1/wt mice are viable up to 8 months, develop hypoplastic hearts, and diminished systolic performance that is more pronounced in female mice. Prdm16csp1/wt cardiac tissue of both sexes showed reductions in metabolites associated with amino acid as well as glycerol metabolism, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Prdm16csp1/wt cardiac tissue revealed diminished glutathione (GSH) and increased inosine monophosphate (IMP) levels indicating oxidative stress and a dysregulated energetics, respectively. An accumulation of triacylglycerides exclusively in male Prdm16csp1/wt hearts suggests a sex-specific metabolic adaptation. Metabolic modelling using CARDIOKIN identified a reduction in fatty acid utilization in males as well as lower glucose utilization in female Prdm16csp1/wt cardiac tissue. On the level of transcripts and protein expression, Prdm16csp1/wt hearts demonstrate an up-regulation of pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain 2 (Pyroxd2) and the transcriptional regulator pre-B-cell leukaemia transcription factor interacting protein 1 (Pbxip1). The strongest concordant transcriptional up-regulation was detected for Prdm16 itself, probably through an autoregulatory mechanism.\nMonoallelic, global Prdm16 mutation diminishes cardiac performance in Prdm16csp1/wt mice. Metabolic alterations and transcriptional dysregulation in Prdm16csp1/wt affect cardiac tissue. Female Prdm16csp1/wt mice develop a more pronounced phenotype, indicating sexual dimorphism at this early pathological window.

However, its role in ischemic heart disease remains largely unknown.\nConsidering that Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/ signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has a protective effect on the heart, we developed a mouse model of MIRI to investigate the potential role of this pathway in loganin-induced cardioprotection.\nOur results showed that treatment with loganin (20\u00a0mg/kg) prevented the enlargement of myocardial infarction, myocyte destruction, serum markers of cardiac injury, and deterioration of cardiac function induced by MIRI. Myocardium subjected to I/R treatment exhibited higher levels of oxidative stress, as indicated by an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and dihydroethidium (DHE) density and a decrease in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), whereas treatment with loganin showed significant attenuation of I/R-induced oxidative stress. Loganin treatment also increased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and reduced the expression of caspase-3/9, Bax, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in ischemic cardiac tissue. Moreover, treatment with loganin triggered JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation, and AG490, a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, partially abrogated the cardioprotective effects of loganin, indicating the essential role of JAK2/STAT3 signaling in the cardioprotective effects of loganin.\nOur data demonstrate that loganin protects the heart from I/R injury by inhibiting I/R-induced oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis via activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2023-10-10", "authors": ["BoyuXia", "JiaqiDing", "QiLi", "KoulongZheng", "JingjingWu", "ChaoHuang", "KunLiu", "QingshengYou", "XiaomeiYuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.131426"}
{"title": "Blockage of DCLK1 in cardiomyocytes suppresses myocardial inflammation and alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a pathophysiological condition triggered by diabetes mellitus and can lead to heart failure. Doublecortin-like kinase protein 1 (DCLK1) is a multifunctional protein kinase involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. Current studies on DCLK1 mainly focus on cancer development; however, its role in non-tumor diseases such as DCM is yet to be deciphered. Our analysis revealed that DCLK1 was upregulated in cardiomyocytes of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mouse, suggesting a correlation between DCLK1 and DCM progression. It was further demonstrated that either cardiomyocyte-specific DCLK1 knockout or pharmacological DCLK1 inhibitor DCLK1-IN-1 significantly alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in STZ-induced diabetic mice. RNA-seq analysis of heart tissues revealed that DCLK1 regulated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-mediated inflammatory response in DCM. In vitro, DCLK1 activated NF-\u03baB and the inflammatory response by inducing the IKK\u03b2 phosphorylation in high-concentration glucose (HG)-challenged cardiomyocytes. DCLK1-IN-1 also prevented HG-induced IKK\u03b2/NF-\u03baB activation and inflammatory injuries in cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, this study highlights the novel role of cardiomyocyte DCLK1 in regulating IKK\u03b2/NF-\u03baB, which aggravates inflammation to promote the pathogenesis of DCM.

In sheep (n\u2009=\u20098), a single pulmonary valve leaflet was replaced with a PECUU leaflet and followed for 1, 6, and 12\u2009weeks. Implanted leaflet function was assessed in vivo by echocardiography. Explanted samples were studied for gross pathology, microscopic changes in the extracellular matrix, host cellular re-population, and immune responses, and for biomechanical properties. PECUU leaflets showed normal leaflet motion at implant, but decreased leaflet motion and dimensions at 6\u2009weeks. The leaflets accumulated \u03b1-SMA and CD45 positive cells, with surfaces covered with endothelial cells (CD31+). New collagen formation occurred (Picrosirius Red). Accumulated tissue thickness correlated with the decrease in leaflet motion. The PECUU scaffolds had histologic evidence of scaffold degradation and an accumulation of pro-inflammatory/M1 and anti-inflammatory/M2 macrophages over time in vivo. The extent of inflammatory cell accumulation correlated with tissue formation and polymer degradation but was also associated with leaflet thickening and decreased leaflet motion.

It has been extensively used for decades in the treatment of hypertension combined with metabolic diseases, but its cardioprotective effects and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.\nTo explore the cardioprotective effects and potential mechanisms of QGZS in an animal model of obese hypertension.\nIn this study, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were utilized as an animal model to examine the effects of a high-fat diet and two concentrations of QGZS. Echocardiography, hematoxylin eosin (H&E) staining, and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining were employed to assess the cardiac structure and function of the SHRs throughout a 16-week therapy period. Furthermore, Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) were employed to identify the levels of Nrf2 expression in the mitochondria, cytoplasm, and nucleus of the myocardium. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were utilized to measure mitochondrial morphology and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, respectively. Furthermore, Western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) techniques were employed to quantify the levels of marker proteins associated with myocardial fibrosis, cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction.\nQGZS inhibited weight gain and depressed systolic and mean arterial pressures in high-fat-fed SHRs. Echocardiographic results demonstrated that QGZS prevented the increase in left ventricular mass, restricted the growth of left ventricular diameter, and improved ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and the ratio of early diastolic peak velocity of transmitral flow (E) to late diastolic peak velocity (A) in high-fat-fed SHRs. This suggested that QGZS prevented ventricular remodeling and protected cardiac systolic and diastolic functions. H&E and WGA staining showed that QGZS improved cardiomyocyte disorders and restricted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The underlying mechanisms, QGZS attenuated the oxidative stress state, including reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the myocardium, revitalizing the antioxidant enzyme system, and protecting mitochondrial function. Moreover, QGZS alleviated the pro-inflammatory state in high-fat-fed SHRs. What's more, QGZS significantly increased the expression level of Nrf2 in nuclei and mitochondria in rat heart tissues, exerting a proximate Nrf2 agonist effect.\nQGZS exerted cardioprotective effects, in part due to its increasing expression of Nrf2 protein in the heart, which promoted Nrf2 nuclear expression.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2023-09-24", "authors": ["ShujieZhang", "ZitianLiu", "HanZhang", "XiaonianZhou", "XiumingWang", "YanChen", "XiaofanMiao", "YaoZhu", "WeiminJiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2023.117163"}

Therefore, we prescribed a program of 8-week treadmill training for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats and determined the role of irisin signaling, via interacting with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in mediating the effects of exercise on myocardial injuries and mitochondrial fission.\nForty 8-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into groups of control (Con), diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetes plus exercise (Ex), and diabetes plus exercise and Cyclo RGDyk (ExRg). Ex and ExRg rats received 8\u2009weeks of treadmill running, and the rats in the ExRg group additionally were treated with a twice weekly injection of Cyclo RGDyk, an irisin receptor-\u03b1V/\u03b25 antagonist. At the end of the experiment, murine blood samples and heart tissues were collected and analyzed with methods of ELISA, Western blot, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, as well as immunofluorescence staining.\nExercise effectively mitigated T2DM-related hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, lipid dysmetabolism, and inflammation, which could be diminished by Cyclo RGDyk treatment. Additionally, exercise alleviated T2DM-induced myocardial injury and excessive mitochondrial fission, whereas the beneficial effects were blocked by the administration of Cyclo RGDyk. T2DM significantly decreased serum irisin concentrations and fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin gene and protein expression levels in the rat heart, whereas exercise could rescue T2DM-reduced FNDC5/irisin expression. Blocking irisin receptor signaling diminished the exercise-alleviated mitochondrial fission protein expression and elevated AMPK phosphorylation.\nExercise is effective in mitigating diabetes-related insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction, and inflammation.

Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, qPCR, and western blot were performed to observe cell proliferation and explore the underlying mechanism.\nIntrauterine exposure to excessive androgen led to thinner ventricular wall, decreased number of cardiomyocytes in fetal offspring and caused cardiac hypertrophy, compromised cardiac function in adult offspring. The analysis of steroid hormone metabolites in fetal heart tissue by ultra performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry showed that the content of androgen metabolite androsterone was significantly increased. Mechanistically, H9c2 cells treated with androsterone led to a significant decrease in phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and cell cycle-related protein including cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and cyclin D1 (CCND1) in cardiomyocytes. This resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1-S phase, which in turn inhibited cardiomyocyte proliferation.\nTaken together, our results indicate that in utero exposure to DHT, its metabolite androsterone could directly decrease cardiomyocytes proliferation through cell cycle arrest, which has a life-long-lasting effect on cardiac health. Our study highlights the importance of monitoring sex hormones in women during pregnancy and the follow-up of cardiac function in offspring with high risk of intrauterine androgen exposure.", "journal": "Journal of endocrinological investigation", "date": "2023-08-29", "authors": ["YHuo", "WWang", "JZhang", "DXu", "FBai", "YGui"], "doi": "10.1007/s40618-023-02178-1\n10.1080/10408363.2017.1422109\n10.3390/ijms22126634\n10.3390/ijms222111668\n10.1530/JOE-20-0578\n10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.2673\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002888\n10.3390/ijms20123090\n10.1093/aje/kwx063\n10.1210/er.2015-1104\n10.1038/nrendo.2018.24\n10.1016/j.beem.2018.03.008\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.04.046\n10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.001\n10.1530/EJE-15-0699\n10.1093/humrep/17.10.2573\n10.1210/jc.2018-00889\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.02.005\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.09.042\n10.1093/humupd/dmv029\n10.1056/NEJMoa1000485\n10.1001/jama.2013.280386\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.012066\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.01.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.308428\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.05.022\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311349\n10.1007/s00018-016-2375-y\n10.1093/cvr/cvw074\n10.1074/jbc.M414482200\n10.1016/j.healun.2009.09.017\n10.1111/acel.13734\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04521\n10.1093/cvr/cvz180\n10.1186/1477-7827-9-110\n10.1152/ajpheart.00314.2018\n10.1152/physrev.00032.2006\n10.1007/s00018-016-2404-x\n10.1111/dgd.12134\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa159\n10.1016/j.ecl.2005.09.006\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.06.011\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043067\n10.1007/s00424-017-2061-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1016/j.devcel.2006.03.004\n10.1016/j.cell.2004.07.025\n10.1038/s41418-022-00988-z\n10.1016/j.phrs.2016.02.021\n10.1002/med.21558\n10.1016/j.canlet.2021.06.006\n10.1016/j.mce.2017.10.006"}

EVs were isolated from the conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation and characterized in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. A rat model of myocardial infarction was established by left anterior descending artery ligation and treated with iPSCM-derived EVs.\niPSCM-derived EVs contained microRNAs and proteins associated with angiogenesis, antifibrosis, promotion of M2 macrophage polarization, cell proliferation, and antiapoptosis. iPSCM-derived EV treatment improved left ventricular function and reduced mortality in the rat model by improving vascularization and suppressing fibrosis and chronic inflammation in the heart. EVs were uptaken by cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages in the cardiac tissues. The pleiotropic effects occurred due to the direct effects of microRNAs and proteins encapsulated in EVs and indirect paracrine effects on M2 macrophages.\nClinical-grade iPSCM-derived EVs improve cardiac function by regulating various genes and pathways in various cell types and may have clinical potential for treating ischemic heart disease.", "journal": "The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation", "date": "2023-08-24", "authors": ["YujiTominaga", "TakujiKawamura", "EmikoIto", "MakiTakeda", "AkimaHarada", "KosukeTorigata", "RyotoSakaniwa", "YoshikiSawa", "ShigeruMiyagawa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.healun.2023.08.011"}

The involvement of oncostatin M (OSM) and its receptor (OSMR) in RIHD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the specific mechanism of OSM/OSMR in RIHF/RIHD.\nRNA sequencing was performed on heart tissues from a RIHD mouse model. OSM levels were assessed in serum samples obtained from patients receiving thoracic radiation therapy (RT), as well as in RIHF mouse heart tissues and serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fiber activation was evaluated through costimulation of primary cardiac fibroblasts and NIH3T3 cells with RT and OSM, using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Adeno-associated virus serotype 9-mediated overexpression or silencing of OSM specifically in the heart was performed in vivo to assess cardiac fibrosis levels by transthoracic echocardiography and pathologic examination. The regulatory mechanism of OSM on the transcription level of SMAD4 was further explored in vitro using mass spectrometric analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR, and DNA pull-down.\nOSM levels were elevated in the serum of patients after thoracic RT as well as in RIHF mouse cardiac endothelial cells and mouse serum. The OSM rate (post-RT/pre-RT) and the heart exposure dose in RT patients showed a positive correlation. Silencing OSMR in RIHF mice reduced fibrosis, while OSMR overexpression increased fibrotic responses. Furthermore, increased OSM promoted histone acetylation (H3K27ac) in the SMAD4 promoter region, influencing SMAD4 transcription and subsequently enhancing fibrotic response.\nThe findings demonstrated that OSM/OSMR signaling promotes SMAD4 transcription in cardiac fibroblasts through H3K27 hyperacetylation, thereby promoting radiation-induced cardiac fibrosis and manifestations of RIHD.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2023-08-23", "authors": ["PengXu", "YaliYi", "LeXiong", "YuxiLuo", "CaifengXie", "DayaLuo", "ZhiminZeng", "AnwenLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.07.033"}

Endogenously derived 3-indolepropionic acid (3-IPA) from tryptophan metabolism is of interest due to its antioxidant capabilities which may have cardioprotective effects. Supplementation with 3-IPA may abate EPI's cardiotoxicity, and herein we studied the possibility of lessening EPI-induced cardiotoxicity in Wistar rats. Experimental rats (n\u2009=\u200930; BW 180-200\u00a0g) were randomly distributed in five cohorts (A-E; n\u2009=\u20096 each).

Following sacrifice, oxidative status, lipid profile, transaminases relevant to cardiac function, and inflammatory biomarkers were analysed. Also, 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

EPI-induced increases in nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase were reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.05) by 3-IPA co-treatment.

In the long-term CIH group, the EF and HR increased, the myocardial injury and mitochondrial damage were more severe, mitochondrial synthesis decreased, the apoptosis percentage and ROS increased, mitochondrial fragmentation increased, membrane potential decreased, CB1R expression increased, and AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1 expression levels decreased. Targeted blocking of CB1R can increase AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1, reduce damage attributed to long-term CIH in mouse hearts and H9C2 cells, and promote mitochondrial synthesis.\nShort-term CIH can directly activate the AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway, promote mitochondrial synthesis in cardiomyocytes, and protect cardiac structure and function. Long-term CIH can increase CB1R expression and inhibit the AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway, resulting in structural damage, the disturbance of myocardial mitochondria synthesis, and further alterations in the cardiac structure. After targeted blocking of CB1R, levels of AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1 increased, alleviating damage to the heart and cardiomyocytes caused by long-term CIH.", "journal": "Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung", "date": "2023-07-10", "authors": ["ZixuanHu", "SufangMu", "LiZhao", "ZhanjunDou", "PeipeiWang", "JunfengZhang", "NingJin", "XinLu", "XinruiXu", "TingLiang", "YutingDuan", "YangXiong", "BeiWang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11325-023-02863-8\n10.1007/10.1183/13993003.03091-2020\n10.1007/10.1001/jama.2020.3514\n10.1007/10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30198-5\n10.1007/10.1016/j.cjca.2021.01.027\n10.1007/10.1016/j.tcm.2020.04.003\n10.1152/jappl.1992.72.5.1978\n10.1152/ajpheart.00683.2003\n10.1007/10.3389/fcell.2020.00467\n10.1007/10.3389/fcvm.2021.720085\n10.1007/10.1177/09636897211024210\n10.1007/10.3390/ijms19113634\n10.1007/10.1016/j.cmet.2017.07.005\n10.1007/10.1016/j.cmet.2021.08.014\n10.1007/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173484\n10.1007/10.1016/j.cmet.2005.05.004\n10.1007/10.3390/ijms22126399\n10.1007/10.1016/j.mce.2018.11.015\n10.1007/10.1080/15548627.2021.1938913\n10.1007/10.1146/annurev-nutr-043020-090216\n10.1007/10.1038/nrcardio.2017.130\n10.1007/10.1186/s12882-021-02362-6\n10.1007/10.1093/humrep/deaa177\n10.1016/S0022-5223(19)37950-4\n10.1007/10.1016/j.abb.2016.07.006\n10.1007/10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307276\n10.1007/10.1002/lary.28293\n10.1007/[25]10.1007/s11325-019-02009-9\n10.1007/[26]10.1080/00207454.2017.1420069\n10.1007/10.1155/2021/6372430\n10.1007/10.1159/000494869\n10.1007/10.1186/s13048-021-00912-y\n10.1007/10.1039/d1tb00728a\n10.1007/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044998\n10.1007/10.7150/thno.29130\n10.1007/10.1007/s11010-017-3001-5\n10.1007/10.1152/ajpregu.00208.2014"}

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective approach for alleviating myocardial I/R injury. Trehalose (TRE) is a natural bioactive substance that has been shown to have extensive physiological effects in various animals and plants. However, TRE's protective effects against myocardial I/R injury remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of TRE pre-treatment in mice with acute myocardial I/R injury and to explore the role of pyroptosis in this process. Mice were pre-treated with trehalose (1\u00a0mg/g) or an equivalent amount of saline solution for 7\u00a0days. The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated in mice from the I/R and I/R\u2009+\u2009TRE groups, followed by 2-h or 24-h reperfusion after 30\u00a0min. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function in mice. Serum and cardiac tissue samples were obtained to examine the relevant indicators. We established an oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation model in neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and validated the mechanism by which trehalose affects myocardial necrosis via overexpression or silencing of NLRP3. TRE pre-treatment significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and reduced the infarct size in mice after I/R, accompanied by a decrease in the I/R-induced levels of CK-MB, cTnT, LDH, reactive oxygen species, pro-IL-1\u03b2, pro-IL-18, and TUNEL-positive cells. Furthermore, TRE intervention suppressed the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins following I/R.

Non-contrast whole-body CT scans were obtained using low-dose radiation procedures. Scans were read qualitatively and quantitated. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of calcinosis detection of physician physical exam against CT. We quantified calcinosis burden using the Agatston scoring technique.\nWe identified five distinct calcinosis patterns: Clustered, Disjoint, Interfascial, Confluent and Fluid-filled. Novel locations of calcinosis were observed, including the cardiac tissue, pelvic and shoulder bursa, and the spermatic cord. Quantitative measures using Agatston scoring for calcinosis were used in regional distributions across the body. Physician physical exams had a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 90% compared with CT detection. A higher calcium score correlated with higher Physician Global Damage, Calcinosis Severity scores, and disease duration.\nWhole-body CT scans and the Agatston scoring metric define distinct calcinosis patterns and provide novel insights relating to calcinosis in DM and JDM patients. Physicians' physical examinations underrepresented the presence of calcium.

{"title": "Bilobalide Prevents Apoptosis and\u00a0Improves Cardiac Function in Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is an extremely severe cardiovascular disease, which ranks as the leading cause of sudden death worldwide. Studies have proved that cardiac injury following MI can cause cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis. Bilobalide (Bilo) from Ginkgo biloba leaves have been widely reported to possess excellent cardioprotective effects. However, concrete roles of Bilo in MI have not been investigated yet. We here designed both in vitro and in vivo experiments to explore the effects of Bilo on MI-induced cardiac injury and the underlying mechanisms of its action. We conducted in vitro experiments using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated H9c2 cells. Cell apoptosis in H9c2 cells was assessed by conducting flow cytometry assay and evaluating apoptosis-related proteins with western blotting. MI mouse model was established by performing left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation. Cardiac function of MI mice was determined by assessing ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD). Histological changes were analyzed, infarct size and myocardial fibrosis were measured by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson staining in cardiac tissues from the mice. The apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in MI mice was assessed by TUNEL staining. Western blotting was applied to detect the effect of Bilo on c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Bilo inhibited OGD-induced cell apoptosis and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in H9c2 cells. The protein levels of p-JNK and p-p38 were significantly downregulated by Bilo treatment. SB20358 (inhibitor of p38) and SP600125 (inhibitor of JNK) suppressed OGD-induced cell apoptosis as Bilo did. In MI mouse model, Bilo improved the cardiac function and significantly reduced the infarct size and myocardial fibrosis. Bilo inhibited MI-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis in mice. Bilo suppressed the protein levels of p-JNK and p-p38 in cardiac tissues from MI mice. Bilo alleviated OGD-induced cell apoptosis in H9c2 cells and suppressed MI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis in mice via the inactivation of JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Thus, Bilo may be an effective anti-MI agent.", "journal": "Molecular biotechnology", "date": "2023-05-18", "authors": ["WeifengSong", "ZhenChen", "MengZhang", "HaixiaFu", "XianqingWang", "JifangMa", "XiaobiaoZang", "JuanHu", "FenAi", "KeChen"], "doi": "10.1007/s12033-023-00753-8"}

Traditional Chinese medicine is usually used to treat various diseases including diabetes.\nThis study sought to investigate the effects of Traditional Chinese medicine supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation (SAC) in DCM.\nAfter the construction of the DCM model by streptozotocin (STZ) injection and high glucose/fat diet feeding, rats were administered intragastrically with SAC. Then, cardiac systolic/diastolic function was evaluated by detecting left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise (+LVdp/dtmax), and fall (-LVdp/dtmax), heart rate (HR), left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), LV fractional shortening (FS) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Masson's and TUNEL staining were used to assess fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\nDCM rats exhibited impaired cardiac systolic/diastolic function manifested by decreasing LVSP, + LVdp/dtmax, -LVdp/dtmax, HR, EF and FS, and increasing LVEDP. Intriguingly, traditional Chinese medicine SAC alleviated the above-mentioned symptoms, indicating a potential role in improving cardiac function. Masson's staining substantiated that SAC antagonized the increased collagen deposition and interstitial fibrosis area and the elevations in protein expression of fibrosisrelated collagen I and fibronectin in heart tissues of DCM rats. Furthermore, TUNEL staining confirmed that traditional Chinese medicine SAC also attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in DCM rats.

{"title": "Cardioprotective role of a magnolol and honokiol complex in the prevention of doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity in adult rats.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOXO) induces marked cardiotoxicity, though increased oxidative stress while there are some documents related with cardioprotective effects of some antioxidants against organ-toxicity during cancer treatment. Although magnolia bark has some antioxidant-like effects, its action in DOXO-induced heart dysfunction has not be shown clearly. Therefore, here, we aimed to investigate the cardioprotective action of a magnolia bark extract with active component magnolol and honokiol\u00a0complex (MAHOC; 100\u00a0mg/kg) in DOXO-treated rat hearts. One group of adult male Wistar rats was injected with DOXO (DOXO-group; a cumulative dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg in 2-week) or saline (CON-group). One group of DOXO-treated rats was administered with MAHOC before DOXO (Pre-MAHOC group; 2-week) while another group was administered with MAHOC following the 2-week DOXO (Post-MAHOC group). MAHOC administration, before or after DOXO, provided full survival of animals during 12-14\u00a0weeks, and significant recoveries in the systemic parameters of animals such as plasma levels of manganese and zinc, total oxidant and antioxidant statuses, and also systolic and diastolic blood pressures. This treatment also significantly improved heart function including recoveries in end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-systolic volume, heart rate, cardiac output, and prolonged P-wave duration. Furthermore, the MAHOC administrations improved the structure of left ventricles such as recoveries in loss of myofibrils, degenerative nuclear changes, fragmentation of cardiomyocytes, and interstitial edema. Biochemical analysis in the heart tissues provided the important cardioprotective effect of MAHOC on the redox regulation of the heart, such as improvements in activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, and oxygen radical-absorbing capacity of the heart together with recoveries in other systemic parameters of animals, while all of these benefits were observed in the Pre-MAHOC treatment group, more prominently. Overall, one can point out the beneficial antioxidant effects of MAHOC in chronic heart diseases as a supporting and complementing agent to the conventional therapies.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2023-04-19", "authors": ["IremAktay", "Ceylan VerdaBitirim", "YusufOlgar", "AysegulDurak", "ErkanTuncay", "DenizBillur", "Kamil CanAkcali", "BelmaTuran"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-023-04728-w\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318172\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000041431.57222.AF\n10.1093/qjmed/hcn160\n10.3389/fcvm.2015.00029\n10.3945/ajcn.113.058263\n10.2105/AJPH.90.9.1409\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.10.098\n10.3988/jcn.2014.10.2.140\n10.1093/jn/133.8.2650\n10.1097/MCA.0000000000000187\n10.1038/s41598-022-06698-3\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.601364\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01596-0\n10.1016/j.lfs.2003.09.047\n10.3389/fphar.2022.806300\n10.1021/np9702446\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.109886\n10.1248/bpb.33.427\n10.1016/j.biochi.2011.06.012\n10.1093/cdn/nzy009\n10.12659/MSM.910350\n10.3389/fphar.2021.632767\n10.1016/0006-2952(94)90187-2\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.1996.tb01753.x\n10.1155/2021/5523516\n10.1016/j.echo.2011.01.018\n10.1016/j.cjca.2016.06.002\n10.1515/CCLM.2005.140\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.07.011\n10.1177/0960327107076885\n10.1038/srep18314\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.06.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.00253.2017\n10.1159/000265166\n10.1016/s0022-2828(87)80392-9\n10.1002/cncr.11407\n10.1088/0967-3334/36/4/727\n10.1111/bph.13791\n10.1080/13880209.2017.1299768\n10.1515/jbcpp-2018-0212\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064711\n10.1093/toxsci/kfx267\n10.11152/mu.2013.2066.151.ms1ddc2\n10.1369/00221554221101661\n10.1016/j.tox.2010.01.019\n10.1139/cjpp-2017-0054\n10.1016/j.pcad.2006.10.002\n10.1186/s40959-019-0054-5\n10.7326/0003-4819-91-5-710\n10.1093/jnci/djp440\n10.1161/01.RES.87.3.241\n10.1093/jn/nxaa144\n10.1016/S0021-9258(17)35746-0\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101394\n10.3390/curroncol29050241\n10.1016/j.repc.2020.12.015\n10.1007/s11010-005-9003-8\n10.1155/2022/5096825\n10.3389/fneur.2013.00130\n10.1016/j.jep.2016.10.016\n10.1155/2014/965954\n10.3390/ijms221810050\n10.1016/j.bmcl.2021.127952\n10.1371/journal.pone.0120366\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.09.020\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.01.012\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00053\n10.1038/ncomms7656\n10.1159/000028324"}
{"title": "Impairment of substrate-mediated mitochondrial respiration in cardiac cells by chloroquine.", "abstract": "Chloroquine (CQ) has a long clinical history as an anti-malarial agent and also being used for the treatment of other infections and autoimmune diseases. Recently, this lysosomotropic agent and its derivatives are also been tested as adjuncts alongside conventional anti-cancer treatments in combinatorial therapies. However, their reported cardiotoxicity tends to raise concern over their indiscriminate use. Even though the influence of CQ and its derivatives on cardiac mitochondria is extensively studied in disease models, their impact on cardiac mitochondrial respiration under physiological conditions remains inconclusive. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of CQ on cardiac mitochondrial respiration using both in-vitro and in-vivo model systems. Using high-resolution respirometry in isolated cardiac mitochondria from male C57BL/6 mice treated with intraperitoneal injection of 10\u00a0mg/kg/day of CQ for 14\u00a0days, CQ was found to impair substrate-mediated mitochondrial respiration in cardiac tissue. In an in-vitro model of H9C2 cardiomyoblasts, incubation with 50\u00a0\u00b5M of CQ for 24\u00a0h disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, produced mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial respiration and induced superoxide generation. Altogether, our study results indicate that CQ has a deleterious impact on cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics which in turn suggests that CQ treatment could be an added burden, especially in patients affected with diseases with underlying cardiac complications. As CQ is an inhibitor of the lysosomal pathway, the observed effect could be an outcome of the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria due to autophagy inhibition.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2023-04-19", "authors": ["SivasailamAshok", "Sasikala RajendranRaji", "ShankarappaManjunatha", "GopalaSrinivas"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-023-04740-0\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00408\n10.1016/0002-9343(83)91265-2\n10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0086\n10.1128/AAC.32.6.793\n10.1186/s13046-018-0938-5\n10.3892/ijo.2019.4824\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.09.034\n10.1007/s40264-018-0689-4\n10.1007/s10557-018-06847-9\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106057\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1051295\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246108\n10.1016/S1534-5807(04)00099-1\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182646cb1\n10.1016/j.cophys.2017.11.001\n10.14814/phy2.12413\n10.1016/j.rec.2017.04.017\n10.1111/neup.12520\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.11.004\n10.1016/j.humpath.2007.06.013\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.1986.tb04635.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310078\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173918\n10.1159/000477889\n10.1159/000438580\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1074/jbc.M808515200\n10.1080/15548627.2018.1474314\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.104\n10.1038/s41419-018-0708-5\n10.1016/j.redox.2012.11.008\n10.1007/s12013-022-01123-y\n10.1074/jbc.M210943200\n10.1378/chest.06-1146\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.030\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.008"}

{"title": "Therapeutic Strategies Targeting Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Sepsis-induced Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Sepsis is an increasingly worldwide problem; it is currently regarded as a complex life-threatening dysfunction of one or more organs as a result of dysregulated host immune response to infections. The heart is one of the most affected organs, as roughly 10% to 70% of sepsis cases are estimated to turn into sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC). SIC can be defined as a reversible myocardial dysfunction characterized by dilated ventricles, impaired contractility, and decreased ejection fraction. Mitochondria play a critical role in the normal functioning of cardiac tissues as the heart is highly dependent on its production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), its damage during SIC includes morphology impairment, mitophagy, biogenesis disequilibrium, electron transport chain disturbance, molecular damage from the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and many other different impairments that are major contributing factors to the severity of SIC. Although mitochondria-targeted therapies usage is still inadequate in clinical settings, the preclinical study outcomes promise that the implementation of these therapies may effectively treat SIC. This review summarizes the different therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria structure, quality, and quantity abnormalities for the treatment of SIC.", "journal": "Cardiovascular drugs and therapy", "date": "2022-06-16", "authors": ["Oluwabukunmi ModupeSalami", "OliveHabimana", "Jin-FuPeng", "Guang-HuiYi"], "doi": "10.1007/s10557-022-07354-8\n10.3390/ijerph18147598\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000001572\n10.1001/jama.2016.0287\n10.1097/MCC.0000000000000507\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000002851\n10.1016/j.chest.2018.08.1037\n10.1177/0300060518765896\n10.3389/fmed.2021.628302\n10.1089/sur.2006.033\n10.1038/s41569-020-00492-2\n10.1097/MD.0000000000005031\n10.1097/MD.0000000000010263\n10.1007/s11886-020-01277-2\n10.1007/s00134-014-3428-z\n10.1097/01.CCM.0000114827.93410.D8\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2003.02.005\n10.1007/s00392-011-0292-5\n10.1186/s40560-015-0112-5\n10.1016/j.jcrc.2015.05.017\n10.1097/BCR.0000000000000237\n10.1038/srep25984\n10.1016/j.ajem.2021.11.003\n10.1016/j.biocel.2016.07.032\n10.1016/S0300-9084(02)01375-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.09.023\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05213.x\n10.1016/j.abb.2007.03.034\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.069\n10.3390/molecules23030675\n10.1164/ajrccm.165.4.2105084\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2003\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2803\n10.1164/rccm.201106-1152OC\n10.1038/s41598-020-78195-4\n10.1164/rccm.201003-0326OC\n10.4049/jimmunol.171.10.5188\n10.1124/pr.115.011502\n10.1124/jpet.108.148049\n10.7150/ijbs.9220\n10.1242/jcs.03318\n10.1210/me.2007-0029\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101771\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.01.092\n10.1016/j.bcp.2020.114005\n10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.045\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.11.013\n10.18632/aging.103644\n10.1161/01.RES.0000117088.36577.EB\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.10.011\n10.1016/j.redox.2014.11.006\n10.1007/s10741-016-9530-2\n10.1038/s41401-020-00518-y\n10.1128/MCB.01054-14\n10.1083/jcb.201507035\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000461\n10.1111/jpi.12413\n10.1111/jcmm.15384\n10.1152/ajpheart.00203.2011\n10.1007/s00109-019-01756-2\n10.3109/10715762.2014.906592\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060967\n10.1096/fj.201901467R\n10.1007/s12192-019-00992-2\n10.1080/10799893.2019.1641822\n10.1093/cvr/cvt224\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303356\n10.1016/j.apsb.2020.03.004\n10.1091/mbc.e09-03-0252\n10.1038/s41467-018-08276-6\n10.1126/science.1231031\n10.2174/1389450116666150102113648\n10.1074/jbc.M501599200\n10.1128/MCB.00911-10\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.236745\n10.1161/JAHA.112.003012\n10.1101/gad.460708\n10.1111/jpi.12542\n10.1042/CS20190014\n10.1074/jbc.M702657200\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.906610\n10.1016/j.molmed.2019.10.007\n10.1007/s11908-003-0015-9\n10.21037/jtd.2016.05.37\n10.1177/0884533614561790\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05755.x\n10.1111/jpi.12134\n10.1172/jci.insight.99292\n10.1056/NEJM199211263272204\n10.1186/s40635-021-00384-w\n10.1186/s12872-021-02301-1\n10.3390/metabo11020124\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136816\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011707\n10.3390/cells8080795\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01060\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2177\n10.1166/mex.2020.1642\n10.2174/092986705774370646\n10.1016/j.tem.2012.06.002\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.01.008\n10.1080/09674845.2018.1543160\n10.1016/S0009-9120(99)00075-2\n10.1164/rccm.200410-1346OC\n10.1007/s10753-019-01081-3\n10.1126/science.1095569\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.09.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.12.016\n10.1161/JAHA.120.019877\n10.3390/jpm11070610\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000261\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181844276\n10.1172/jci.insight.94248\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000002236\n10.12659/MSM.918369\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e31824e1370\n10.1097/MCC.0000000000000427\n10.1038/nature14156\n10.1186/1479-5876-10-130\n10.1152/ajplung.00400.2014\n10.1038/nrm3028\n10.1038/nature10992\n10.1371/journal.pone.0139416\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.039\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01071\n10.1371/journal.pone.0167678\n10.1371/journal.pone.0147792\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.030\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.036\n10.1038/ncb2012\n10.1016/j.molcel.2014.09.007\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2018.12.012\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.042\n10.7554/eLife.01958\n10.1038/ncb2422\n10.1038/cdd.2009.16\n10.1038/ncomms8527\n10.1038/ncb2837\n10.1007/s10495-019-01521-3\n10.1007/s00011-019-01292-2\n10.1089/ars.2013.5416\n10.1111/jcmm.13802\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e318214b67e\n10.1080/10715762.2017.1414949\n10.1074/jbc.M112.363747\n10.3389/fphar.2021.641058\n10.1371/journal.pone.0253849\n10.1177/2048872617710789\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004389\n10.1056/NEJMoa067373\n10.1097/00000542-200203000-00011\n10.1001/jama.2013.278477\n10.1016/j.chest.2016.11.036\n10.1007/s00134-019-05731-w\n10.21037/jtd.2016.12.10\n10.1007/s00134-013-2982-0\n10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02750.x"}
{"title": "Phoenixin-14 protects cardiac damages in a streptozotocin-induced diabetes mice model through SIRT3.", "abstract": "Type I diabetes is a metabolic syndrome that severely impacts the normal lives of patients through its multiple complications, such as diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Phoenixin-14 is a peptide found to be widely expressed in eukaryons with multiple protective properties, including anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study aims to explore the potential therapeutic impacts of Phoenixin-14 on DCM.\nType I diabetes was induced by treatment with a single dose of STZ (40\u2009mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days. Mice were divided into four groups: the Control, Phoenixin-14, T1DM, and Phoenixin-14 +T1DM groups. The levels of myocardial injury markers were measured. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining.\nPhoenixin-14 was significantly downregulated in the cardiac tissue of diabetic mice. The myocardial injury and deteriorated cardiac function in diabetic mice induced by STZ were significantly ameliorated by Phoenixin-14, accompanied by the alleviation of cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, the severe oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetic mice were dramatically mitigated by Phoenixin-14. Lastly, the downregulated SIRT3 and upregulated p-FOXO3 in diabetic mice were pronouncedly reversed by Phoenixin-14. It is worth mentioning that compared to the Control, no significant changes to any of the investigated parameters in the present study were found in the Phoenixin-14-treated normal mice, suggesting that treatment with it has no side effects.\nOur data revealed that Phoenixin-14 protected against cardiac damages in STZ-induced diabetes mice models.", "journal": "Archives of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2021-10-08", "authors": ["BoYao", "JunlinLv", "LeDu", "HuiZhang", "ZhaoXu"], "doi": "10.1080/13813455.2021.1981946"}
{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "The human heart is a pivotal organ in the circulatory system, and it beats more than 2 billion times during normal life. This functioning of the heart depends on the cardiac conduction system, which includes impulse generators (e.g., sino-atrial node) and the impulse propagating (His-Purkinje) system. \u00a0The sinoatrial node acts as the natural pacemaker of the heart. The cells present in the sinus node have innate automaticity, which starts the electrical activity in the heart. This innate electrical potential moves from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node and finally into the His-Purkinje system.\u00a0This movement of electric potential in an orderly manner controls the rhythmic contraction of the heart's chambers. The failure of this intrinsic electrical conduction in the heart can result in different arrhythmic problems. Several diseases and conditions affect the conduction system by involving impulse generation, impulse propagation, or both. Acquired conditions such as myocardial infarction, age-related degeneration, procedural complications, and drug toxicity are the major causes of the native conduction system malfunction.\u00a0 The current standard of care for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias due to conduction system diseases is the implantation of a cardiac implantable electronic device.\u00a0These pacing devices provide an external electrical stimulus that leads to depolarization of myocytes and helps maintain the electrical excitability of the heart tissue. This process leads to excitation-contraction coupling resulting in the contraction of myocardial tissue.\u00a0 Despite their success, electronic pacemakers have limitations, including complications related to implantation, limited battery life, the potential for infection, lack of physiologic autonomic responsiveness, and size restriction in younger patients.\u00a0The periodic evaluation of an implanted pacemaker is necessary to optimize programming and to identify correctable problems. This review will discuss the common pacing system problems of a cardiac implantable electronic device (pacemaker).", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["Muhammad TalhaLiaquat", "IntisarAhmed", "TalalAlzahrani"], "doi": null}

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "The foramen ovale is an opening or shunt in the heart tissue allowing blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium during fetal development. Blood oxygenated at the placenta is shunted away from the pulmonic circulation via this structure as the lungs\u00a0are collapsed and not functioning and bathed in amniotic fluid. When born, the ventilatory efforts by the neonate expand the lung resulting in an acute dramatic decrease in the intrathoracic pressure and permits a greater flux of blood to perfuse the pulmonary vessels. Higher pressure in the left atrium resulting from\u00a0increased pulmonary venous\u00a0flow from the lungs causes the septum primum of the interatrial septum to close the opening. Over time, the tissue will seal the foramen and become the fossa ovalis. Inability to correctly close the foramen ovale can lead to multiple conditions, ranging from a patent foramen ovale to atrial septal defects. The clinical significance varies depending mostly on the size of the opening and shunts from early congestive heart failure in the case of a significant atrial septal defect to asymptomatic in small and relatively common patent foramen ovale.

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in the United States with about 3 million people reported being diagnosed with the disorder.\u00a0The prevalence of atrial fibrillation dramatically increases with advancing age. As our population has enjoyed greater longevity, along with the increasing presence of risk factors known associated with atrial fibrillation such as hypertension and obesity, the incidence and prevalence of AF is expected to continue to increase. There is significant morbidity associated with the development and perpetuation of AF, including stroke, heart failure, cognitive impairment, renal failure, increased mortality\u00a0and a negative impact to\u00a0the quality of life.\u00a0As such, controlling the arrhythmia is often essential to patient quality of life and prognosis, but has been difficult to attain. Since Haussaiguarre et al. reported that AF most often began in the posterior left atrium surrounding the ostia of the pulmonary veins,\u00a0pulmonary vein electrical isolation via catheter ablation has been the cornerstone of nonpharmacological treatment of AF. Treatment of AF may be medical or surgical, depending on patient characteristics, duration of disease, symptoms, and patient preference. The two most frequently used energy sources used for ablation are electrocautery (known as\u00a0radio-frequency), and cryoenergy,;\u00a0although other energy sources are being actively investigated for their efficacy and safety. Both methods have been employed during open-heart surgery with equal efficacy.\u00a0Catheter\u00a0radiofrequency\u00a0ablation, where electrocautery is delivered to the tip of a steerable wire, has been used to treat cardiac arrhythmias since the 1980s.\u00a0Catheter cryoablation, where liquid nitrogen is introduced to scar arrhythmic cardiac tissue, was more recently introduced to deliver less severe burns and thus a more controlled degree of\u00a0injury.\u00a0It is most widely used in pediatrics due to the ability to reverse its effects if not applied for a long period due to its slow injury rate. As radio-frequency energy has been the primary energy source used to electrically isolate all four pulmonary veins,\u00a0an extensive number of ablation lesions\u00a0are needed to be delivered by wire to encircle the vein ostia. This posed a challenge of\u00a0completely encircling the peri-ostial pulmonary veins to produce complete conduction block, leaving gaps in the ablation lines and less control in the degree of\u00a0injury delivered, which could lead to injury to contiguous structures such as the esophagus.\u00a0In 2012 the FDA approved a multicenter examination of second-generation cryoballoon which is delivered through a catheter over a wire and can deliver a continuous encircling freeze lesion to the left atrial tissue surrounding the ostia of the pulmonary veins, thus being more consistent in ablation delivery and being less prone to gaps in the ablation field.\u00a0Cryoenergy's greater lesion control should also theoretically have less risk to injure deeper tissues and thus, safer.\u00a0A large multicenter trial in Europe showed both methods were equally effective in electrically isolating pulmonary veins and were equally effective in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation.\u00a0This activity reviews the methodology of catheter cryoballoon ablation using a multicenter examination of second-generation cryoballoon to treat symptomatic AF and its expected outcomes and risks.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["MenaYacoub", "Robert C.Sheppard"], "doi": null}
