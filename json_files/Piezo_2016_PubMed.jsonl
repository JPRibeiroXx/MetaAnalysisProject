{"title": "Noble metal nanoparticles in biosensors: recent studies and applications.", "abstract": "The aim of this review is to cover advances in noble metal nanoparticle (MNP)-based biosensors and to outline the principles and main functions of MNPs in different classes of biosensors according to the transduction methods employed. The important biorecognition elements are enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, DNA sequences, and whole cells. The main readouts are electrochemical (amperometric and voltametric), optical (surface plasmon resonance, colorimetric, chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemical, etc.) and piezoelectric. MNPs have received attention for applications in biosensing due to their fascinating properties. These properties include a large surface area that enhances biorecognizers and receptor immobilization, good ability for reaction catalysis and electron transfer, and good biocompatibility. MNPs can be used alone and in combination with other classes of nanostructures. MNP-based sensors can lead to significant signal amplification, higher sensitivity, and great improvements in the detection and quantification of biomolecules and different ions. Some recent examples of biomolecular sensors using MNPs are given, and the effects of structure, shape, and other physical properties of noble MNPs and nanohybrids in biosensor performance are discussed.", "journal": "Nanotechnology reviews", "date": "2018-01-18", "authors": ["HediehMalekzad", "Parham SahandiZangabad", "HamedMirshekari", "MahdiKarimi", "Michael RHamblin"], "doi": "10.1515/ntrev-2016-0014"}

Furthermore, a baseline-independent nonlinear extension of the standard RAPID method is proposed, and its performance is demonstrated both numerically and experimentally.

{"title": "Transverse Crack Detection in 3D Angle Interlock Glass Fibre Composites Using Acoustic Emission.", "abstract": "In addition to manufacturing cost and production rates, damage resistance has become a major issue for the composites industry. Three-dimensional (3D) woven composites have superior through-thickness properties compared to two-dimensional (2D) laminates, for example, improved impact damage resistance, high interlaminar fracture toughness and reduced notch sensitivity. The performance of 3D woven preforms is dependent on the fabric architecture, which is determined by the binding pattern. For this study, angle interlock (AI) structures with through-thickness binding were manufactured. The AI cracking simulation shows that the transverse component is the one that leads to transverse matrix cracking in the weft yarn under tensile loading. Monitoring of acoustic emission (AE) during mechanical loading is an effective tool in the study of damage processes in glass fiber-reinforced composites.

The experimental study was performed by means of a CNC machine tool obtaining FSSW lap joints on AA7050 aluminum alloy plates. Three thermocouples were inserted into the samples to measure the temperatures at different distance from the joint axis during the whole FSSW process. Experiments was repeated varying the process parameters, namely rotational speed, axial feed rate and plunging depth. Axial welding forces were measured during the tests using a piezoelectric load cell, while the mechanical properties of the joints were evaluated by executing shear tests on the specimens. The correlation found between process parameters and joints properties, allowed to identify the best technological window. The data collected during the experiments were used to validate a simulation model of the FSSW process, too. The model was set up using a 2D approach for the simulation of a 3D problem, in order to guarantee a very simple and practical solution for achieving results in a very short time.

Experimental data from various species have revealed crucial roles for mechanotransduction in organ development and a plethora of physiological activities. Piezo proteins have recently been identified as the long-sought-after mechanically activated cation channels in eukaryotes. The architecture of mouse Piezo1 (mPiezo1) channel determined by cryoelectron microscopic\u00a0single-particle analysis at medium resolution yielded important insights into the mechanical force sensing mechanism. mPiezo1 is found to form a trimeric propeller-like structure with the extracellular domains resembling three distal blades and a central cap. The transmembrane region consists of a central pore module that likely determines the ion-conducting properties of mPiezo1, and three peripheral wings formed by arrays of paired transmembrane helices. Compared with the central pore module, the three distal blades display considerably larger flexibility. In the intracellular region, three long beam-like domains (\u223c80\u00c5 in length) support the whole transmembrane region and connect the mobile peripheral regions to the central pore module. This unique design suggests that the trimeric mPiezo1 may mechanistically function in similar principles as how propellers sense and transduce force to control the ion conductivity.

Sensor signals were divided into 10 seconds epochs and for each epoch combination of time and frequency domain features were computed. In this work, we present a comparison of three different ensemble techniques: boosting (AdaBoost), bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and stacking, each trained with 3 different weak classifiers (Decision Trees, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression). Type of feature normalization used can also impact the classification results. For each ensemble method, three feature normalization techniques: (no-normalization, z-score normalization, and minmax normalization) were tested.

{"title": "Comparison of viscoelastic property characterization of plastisol phantoms with magnetic resonance elastography and high-frequency rheometry.", "abstract": "This study aims at evaluating Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) as a reliable technique for the characterization of viscoelastic properties of soft tissues. Three phantoms with different concentrations of plastisol and softener were prepared in order to mechanically mimic a broad panel of healthy and pathological soft tissues. Once placed in a MRI device, each sample was excited by a homemade external driver, inducing shear waves within the medium. The storage (G') and loss (G\") moduli of each phantom were then reconstructed from MRE acquisitions over a frequency range from 300 to 1,000 Hz, by applying a 2D Helmholtz inversion algorithm. At the same time, mechanical tests were performed on four samples of each phantom with a High-Frequency piezo-Rheometer (HFR) over an overlapping frequency range (from 160 to 630 Hz) with the same test conditions (temperature, ageing). The comparison between both techniques shows a good agreement in the measurement of the storage and loss moduli, underlying the capability of MRE to noninvasively assess the complex shear modulus G* of a medium and its interest for investigating the viscoelastic properties of living tissues. Moreover, the phantoms with varying concentrations of plastisol used in this study show interesting rheological properties, which make them good candidates to simulate the broad variety of viscoelastic behaviors of healthy and pathological soft tissues.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Little has been written regarding ultrasonic system for temporomandibular joint surgery (TMJ). In this prospective study we describe the use of piezoelectric device for ankylosis of the TMJ.\nWe enrolled in this study 19 patients, 10 males and 9 females, mean (SD) age 24.6 (7.6) years, affected by unilateral ankylosis of TMJ who were surgically managed between January 2009 and December 2014 by interpositional arthroplasty with temporomyofascial muscle flap. We adopted in all cases a preauricular approach with temporal extension. The ankylotic block was removed with piezoelectric device in 9 patients and using traditional rotary bur in 10 cases. We investigated and compared the following parameters as surgical outcomes: intraoperative bleeding, duration of operation, incidence of infection, postoperative swelling and hematoma, mouth opening, nerve impairment and rate of recurrence.\nWe noticed a substantial reduction in bleeding with the piezoelectric bone cutter when compared to traditional mechanical surgery (103\u00a0ml versus 117\u00a0ml; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); however, we did not report any severe bleeding from the pterygoid plexus or maxillary artery. Operating time was longer in the piezo group (101\u00a0min versus 88\u00a0min; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was a lower incidence of postoperative hematoma and swelling following piezoosteotomy. However, regarding postoperative nerve impairment and infection we did not observe any differences between the two groups. At one year follow-up mean (SD) mouth opening was 34 (4.3) mm. We did not report recurrence of the disease.\nPiezoelectric bone removal for the release of ankylosis of the TMJ is associated with minimal bleeding and few postoperative complications. We believe that piezosurgery allows surgeons to achieve better results compared to a traditional surgery.

This study explored the possibility of identifying sleep apnea events, including OSA and CSA, by solely analyzing one or both the THO and ABD signals. An adaptive non-harmonic model was introduced to model the THO and ABD signals, which allows us to design features for sleep apnea events. To confirm the suitability of the extracted features, a support vector machine was applied to classify three categories - normal and hypopnea, OSA, and CSA.

Sensed foot pressures are digitized and stored in the memory of a sensor-tag, thus allowing relative foot pressure values to be tracked. The control unit of the smart sock is assembled on a flexible printed circuit board (FPC) that can be strapped to the lower limb and detached easily when it is not in use.

{"title": "Kinesthetic Feedback During 2DOF Wrist Movements via a Novel MR-Compatible Robot.", "abstract": "We demonstrate the interaction control capabilities of the MR-SoftWrist, a novel MR-compatible robot capable of applying accurate kinesthetic feedback to wrist pointing movements executed during fMRI. The MR-SoftWrist, based on a novel design that combines parallel piezoelectric actuation with compliant force feedback, is capable of delivering 1.5 N [Formula: see text] of torque to the wrist of an interacting subject about the flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation axes. The robot workspace, defined by admissible wrist rotation angles, fully includes a circle with a 20 deg radius. Via dynamic characterization, we demonstrate capability for transparent operation with low (10% of maximum torque output) backdrivability torques at nominal speeds. Moreover, we demonstrate a 5.5 Hz stiffness control bandwidth for a 14 dB range of virtual stiffness values, corresponding to 25%-125% of the device's physical reflected stiffness in the nominal configuration. We finally validate the possibility of operation during fMRI via a case study involving one healthy subject. Our validation experiment demonstrates the capability of the device to apply kinesthetic feedback to elicit distinguishable kinetic and neural responses without significant degradation of image quality or task-induced head movements. With this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of MR-compatible devices like the MR-SoftWrist to be used in support of motor control experiments investigating wrist pointing under robot-applied force fields. Such future studies may elucidate fundamental neural mechanisms enabling robot-assisted motor skill learning, which is crucial for robot-aided neurorehabilitation.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "date": "2017-01-24", "authors": ["AndrewErwin", "Marcia KO'Malley", "DavidRess", "FabrizioSergi"], "doi": "10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2634585"}
{"title": "Characterization of the dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic coefficients of Ca", "abstract": "In this paper, the dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic properties of the Ca3TaGa3Si2O14 (CTGS) single crystals were fully investigated over the temperature range of 21~800\u00b0C. Both the real and the complex coefficients were completely characterized. The real coefficients were determined through the measurements of the capacitance, impedance, or admittance of three kinds of plate-samples (X-cut, Y-cut, and Z-cut) and four types of bar-samples (XY-cut, (XYt)45\u00b0, (XYt)-30\u00b0, and (XYt)-85\u00b0), according to the IEEE dynamic methods. Of utmost importance are the complex coefficients, which were obtained by taking into account the electrical and mechanical dissipations of the specimens, and therefore they could describe the materials' performance more accurately. In the light of the characterization method developed by Du et al., three kinds of plate-samples (X-cut, Y-cut, and Z-cut) and two types of bar-samples (XY-cut and (XYt)-85\u00b0) were designed for the determination of the materials complex coefficients. Moreover, the temperature behaviors of all the independent dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic coefficients (2, 2, and 6, respectively) were summarized: the real parts of the complex dielectric coefficients (equal to the real dielectric coefficients) rise gradually with the increase of the temperature, while the imaginary parts increase dramatically after 400 \u00b0C; both the real and complex piezoelectric coefficients stay relatively stable over the measurement temperature range; all the absolute values of the elastic compliance coefficients, to varying degrees, increase with the temperature, while the elastic stiffness coefficients decrease, and some of them exhibit excellent linearity.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2017-01-24", "authors": ["HongfeiZu", "QuanmingLin", "HuiyanWu", "YanqingZheng", "Qing-MingWang"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2544662"}
{"title": "Characterisation and Modelling of Meshed Electrodes on Free Standing Polyvilylidene Difluoride (PVDF) Films for Enhanced Pyroelectric Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "Flexible pyroelectric energy generators provide unique features for harvesting temperature fluctuations which can be effectively enhanced using meshed electrodes that improve thermal conduction, convection and radiation into the pyroelectric. In this paper, thermal radiation energy is continuously harvested with pyroelectric free standing Polyvilylidene Difluoride (PVDF) films over a large number of heat heat cycles using a novel micro-sized symmetrical patterned meshed electrode. It is shown that, for the meshed electrode geometries considered in this work, the polarisation-field (P-E), current-field (I-E) characteristics and device capacitance are unaffected since the fringing fields were generally small; this is verified using numerical simulations and comparison with experimental measurements. The use of meshed electrodes has been shown to significantly improve both the open circuit voltage (16 V to 59 V) and closed-circuit current (9 nA to 32 nA). The pyroelectric alternating current (AC) is rectified for direct current (DC) storage and 30% reduction in capacitor charging time is achieved by using the optimum meshed electrodes. The use of meshed electrodes on ferroelectric materials provides an innovative route to improve their performance in applications such as wearable devices, novel flexible sensors and large scale pyroelectric energy harvesters.hese instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for IEEE Transactions and Journals.

{"title": "Segmentation and Characterization of Chewing Bouts by Monitoring Temporalis Muscle Using Smart Glasses With Piezoelectric Sensor.", "abstract": "Several methods have been proposed for automatic and objective monitoring of food intake, but their performance suffers in the presence of speech and motion artifacts. This paper presents a novel sensor system and algorithms for detection and characterization of chewing bouts from a piezoelectric strain sensor placed on the temporalis muscle. The proposed data acquisition device was incorporated into the temple of eyeglasses. The system was tested by ten participants in two part experiments, one under controlled laboratory conditions and the other in unrestricted free-living. The proposed food intake recognition method first performed an energy-based segmentation to isolate candidate chewing segments (instead of using epochs of fixed duration commonly reported in research literature), with the subsequent classification of the segments by linear support vector machine models. On participant level (combining data from both laboratory and free-living experiments), with ten-fold leave-one-out cross-validation, chewing were recognized with average F-score of 96.28% and the resultant area under the curve was 0.97, which are higher than any of the previously reported results. A multivariate regression model was used to estimate chew counts from segments classified as chewing with an average mean absolute error of 3.83% on participant level. These results suggest that the proposed system is able to identify chewing segments in the presence of speech and motion artifacts, as well as automatically and accurately quantify chewing behavior, both under controlled laboratory conditions and unrestricted free-living.", "journal": "IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics", "date": "2017-01-24", "authors": ["MuhammadFarooq", "EdwardSazonov"], "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2016.2640142"}

The prototype allows the monitoring of any industrial system with minimal investment in material and installation costs. The data logger is capable of making 12.8 kSPS enough to sample up to 5 kHz signals. The basic specification of the data logger includes a high resolution 1-axis piezoelectric accelerometer with a working range of \u00b130 G.

The tests were blinded and carried out in four phases: with DC voltage durations 5, 3, 2, to 0.8 s corresponding to scanning a quadrant, a half, a whole breast, and both breasts within 30 min, respectively. The results showed that PEF detection sensitivity was unaffected by shortening the applied voltage duration from 5 to 0.8 s nor was it affected by increasing the depression depth from 2 to 6 mm. Over the 40 patients, PEF detected 46 of the 48 lesions (46/48)-with the smallest lesion detected being 5 mm in size. Of 28 patients (some have more than one lesion) with mammography records, PEF detected 31/33 of all lesions (94%) and 14/15 of malignant lesions (93%), while mammography detected 30/33 of all lesions (91%) and 12/15 of malignant lesions (80%), indicating that PEF could detect malignant lesions not detectable by mammography without significantly increasing false positives.

{"title": "Different transcriptional profiling between senescent and non-senescent human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) by Omeprazole and Lansoprazole treatment.", "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that high dose and/or long term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in older patients, but mechanisms underlying these detrimental effects are not known. Taking into account that the senescent endothelial cells have been implicated in the genesis or promotion of age-related cardiovascular disease, we hypothesized an active role of PPIs in senescent cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in gene expression occurring in senescent and non-senescent human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) following Omeprazole (OPZ) or Lansoprazole (LPZ) treatment. Here, we show that atherogenic response is among the most regulated processes in PPI-treated HCAECs. PPIs induced down-regulation of anti-atherogenic chemokines (CXCL11, CXCL12 and CX3CL1) in senescent but not in non-senescent cells, while the same chemokines were up-regulated in untreated senescent cells. These findings support the hypothesis that up-regulated anti-atherogenic chemokines may represent a defensive mechanism against atherosclerosis during cellular senescence, and suggest that PPIs could activate pro-atherogenic pathways by changing the secretory phenotype of senescent HCAECs. Moreover, the genes coding for fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) and piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (PIEZO2) were modulated by PPIs treatment with respect to untreated cells. In conclusions, our results show that long-term and high dose use of PPI could change the secretory phenotype of senescent cells, suggesting one of the potential mechanisms by which use of PPI can increase adverse outcomes in older subjects.", "journal": "Biogerontology", "date": "2017-01-01", "authors": ["LauraCostarelli", "RobertinaGiacconi", "MarcoMalavolta", "AndreaBasso", "FrancescoPiacenza", "MauroProvinciali", "Marcello GMaggio", "AndreaCorsonello", "FabriziaLattanzio"], "doi": "10.1007/s10522-016-9675-3"}

In polar metals, there can be analogous dynamical current responses, which we study in a common theoretical framework. We find that current responses to dynamical strain in polar metals depend on both the first and second Chern forms, related to polarization and magnetoelectricity in insulators as well as the orbital magnetization on the Fermi surface.

The PAAm microgels are synthesized by inverse miniemulsion polymerization, and first the parameters are investigated which are suited to obtain particles in the desired size range, 100-200 nm, with narrow size distribution. Amino functions are then imparted to the microgels applying the Hofmann reaction. The modification is confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, ninhydrin test, and elemental analysis. In addition, functionalized microgels are characterized by dynamic light scattering. The amino-functionalized PAAm microgels are then immobilized on pre-modified PVDF membrane having aldehyde functionalities on the surface. Afterward, unreacted aldehyde groups still present on the membrane where quenched by ethanolamine and the enzyme lipase from Candida rugosa (LCR) is subsequently immobilized on the microgels loaded PVDF membrane via glutaraldehyde cross-linking, exploiting the free amino groups on immobilized microgels. Catalytic efficiency of LCR immobilized by this strategy is evaluated using para-nitrophenyl palmitate as substrate and compared with LCR directly immobilized on PVDF membrane without microgels.

Its consequences on material properties are studied within the framework of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics and density-functional theory. No in-gap states develop as the structural transition takes place, so that these phase-change materials remain semiconducting below and above T_{c}. As the in-plane lattice transforms from a rectangle into a square at T_{c}, the electronic, spin, optical, and piezoelectric properties dramatically depart from earlier predictions. Indeed, the Y and X points in the Brillouin zone become effectively equivalent at T_{c}, leading to a symmetric electronic structure. The spin polarization at the conduction valley edge vanishes, and the hole conductivity must display an anomalous thermal increase at T_{c}. The linear optical absorption band edge must change its polarization as well, making this structural and electronic evolution verifiable by optical means.

To pursue this goal, a piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet (ADPJ) system was introduced in this study. This study included 42 patients, who suffered aSAH and underwent clipping surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgery with the assistance of the ADPJ system (ADPJ group). In the other 31 patients, surgery was performed without the ADPJ system (Control group). The ADPJ system was used for clot removal and aneurysmal dissection. The clinical impact of the ADPJ system was judged by comparing the rate of premature rupture, degree of clot removal, and clinical outcomes. Intraoperatively, a premature rupture was encountered in 18.2 and 25.8% of cases in the ADPJ and control groups, respectively. Although the differences were not statistically significant, intraoperative observation suggested that the ADPJ system was effective in clot removal and dissection of aneurysms in a safe manner.

{"title": "A Mathematical Model of a Novel 3D Fractal-Inspired Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Transducer.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers have the potential to operate as both a sensor and as an actuator of ultrasonic waves. Currently, manufactured transducers operate effectively over narrow bandwidths as a result of their regular structures which incorporate a single length scale. To increase the operational bandwidth of these devices, consideration has been given in the literature to the implementation of designs which contain a range of length scales. In this paper, a mathematical model of a novel Sierpinski tetrix fractal-inspired transducer for sensor applications is presented. To accompany the growing body of research based on fractal-inspired transducers, this paper offers the first sensor design based on a three-dimensional fractal. The three-dimensional model reduces to an effective one-dimensional model by allowing for a number of assumptions of the propagating wave in the fractal lattice. The reception sensitivity of the sensor is investigated. Comparisons of reception force response (RFR) are performed between this novel design along with a previously investigated Sierpinski gasket-inspired device and standard Euclidean design. The results indicate that the proposed device surpasses traditional design sensors.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-12-22", "authors": ["SaraCanning", "Alan JWalker", "Paul ARoach"], "doi": "10.3390/s16122170\n10.1142/S0218348X11005555\n10.1109/LAWP.2006.873940\n10.1016/S0959-4388(02)00378-1\n10.1142/S0218348X08004101\n10.1093/imamat/hxv012\n10.1016/0009-2509(96)00307-7\n10.1016/S0923-0467(96)03083-7\n10.1016/0960-0779(96)00014-8\n10.1016/j.enganabound.2014.10.013\n10.1103/PhysRevB.47.7847\n10.1016/j.ultras.2007.08.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0049365\n10.1002/pssa.201532272\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/095039\n10.3390/sym8060043"}
{"title": "A Visualization Method for Corrosion Damage on Aluminum Plates Using an Nd:YAG Pulsed Laser Scanning System.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a non-contact nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique that uses laser-induced ultrasonic waves to visualize corrosion damage in aluminum alloy plate structures. The non-contact, pulsed-laser ultrasonic measurement system generates ultrasonic waves using a galvanometer-based Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and measures the ultrasonic waves using a piezoelectric (PZT) sensor. During scanning, a wavefield can be acquired by changing the excitation location of the laser point and measuring waves using the PZT sensor. The corrosion damage can be detected in the wavefield snapshots using the scattering characteristics of the waves that encounter corrosion. The structural damage is visualized by calculating the logarithmic values of the root mean square (RMS), with a weighting parameter to compensate for the attenuation caused by geometrical spreading and dispersion of the waves. An intact specimen is used to conduct a comparison with corrosion at different depths and sizes in other specimens. Both sides of the plate are scanned with the same scanning area to observe the effect of the location where corrosion has formed. The results show that the damage can be successfully visualized for almost all cases using the RMS-based functions, whether it formed on the front or back side. Also, the system is confirmed to have distinguished corroded areas at different depths.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-12-22", "authors": ["InbokLee", "AoqiZhang", "ChanggilLee", "SeungheePark"], "doi": "10.3390/s16122150\n10.1155/2014/725030\n10.1016/0963-8695(95)00023-Q\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2006.09.023\n10.1111/str.12144\n10.1177/147592170200100104\n10.1177/1045389X05050106\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/2/002\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/2/003\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/6/031\n10.1006/mssp.1998.1209\n10.1109/58.330260\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/2/025022\n10.1121/1.404422\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2005.09.001\n10.1016/j.ultras.2010.11.011\n10.1016/j.nucengdes.2010.06.011\n10.1080/09349847.2014.985349\n10.1016/j.optlaseng.2010.07.008\n10.1088/1742-6596/305/1/012085\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035024"}

In total, 24 Wistar rats were subjected to different types of osteotomy performed with standard steel bur, piezosurgery, contact, and non-contact Erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser ablation. The animals were randomly divided into four groups, to be euthanized immediately after the procedure, or at 1, 2, or 3 weeks after surgery. The obtained bone samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Immediately after surgery, there were significant differences in the appearance of the bone defects, with presence of bone fragments and debris after standard steel bur preparation, compared with the clean smooth walls and relatively sharp edges in all other groups. The initial bone formation in defects prepared by piezosurgery was observed to be the most rapid. After 3 weeks, all bone defects were completely restored; although, differences in the healing pattern were noted, with a modest initial delay in healing after laser preparation. The first stage of the bone healing process was delayed when contact and non-contact Er:YAG laser modes were used and accelerated by piezosurgery; however, the results after 3 weeks demonstrated similar restitution of defects in all tested groups.", "journal": "Microscopy and microanalysis : the official journal of Microscopy Society of America, Microbeam Analysis Society, Microscopical Society of Canada", "date": "2016-12-22", "authors": ["MarkoBlaskovic", "DraganaGabri\u0107", "Nichola JColeman", "Ian JSlipper", "MitkoMladenov", "ElizabetaGjorgievska"], "doi": "10.1017/S1431927616011971"}
{"title": "InGaN-Based Light-Emitting Diodes Grown on a Micro/Nanoscale Hybrid Patterned Sapphire Substrate.", "abstract": "A hybrid patterned sapphire substrate (hybrid-PSS) was prepared using an anodic aluminum oxide etching mask to transfer nanopatterns onto a conventional patterned sapphire substrate with microscale patterns (bare-PSS). The threading dislocation (TD) suppression of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) grown on a hybrid-PSS (HP-LED) exhibits a smaller reverse leakage current compared with that of LEDs grown on a bare-PSS (BP-LED). The strain-free GaN buffer layer and fully strained InGaN active layer were evidenced by cross-sectional Raman spectra and reciprocal space mapping of the X-ray diffraction intensity for both samples. The calculated piezoelectric fields for both samples are close, implying that the quantum-confined Stark effect was not a dominant mechanism influencing the electroluminescence (EL) peak wavelength under a high injection current. The bandgap shrinkage effect of the InGaN well layer was considered to explain the large red-shifted EL peak wavelength under high injection currents. The estimated LED chip temperatures rise from room temperature to 150 \u00b0C and 75 \u00b0C for BP-LED and HP-LED, respectively, at a 600-mA injection current. This smaller temperature rise of the LED chip is attributed to the increased contact area between the sapphire and the LED structural layer because of the embedded nanopattern. Although the chip generates more heat at high injection currents, the accumulated heat can be removed to outside the chip effectively. The high diffuse reflection (DR) rate of hybrid-PSS increases the escape probability of photons, resulting in an increase in the viewing angle of the LEDs from 130\u00b0 to 145\u00b0. The efficiency droop was reduced from 46% to 35%, effects which can be attributed to the elimination of TDs and strain relaxation by embedded nanopatterns. In addition, the light output power of HP-LED at 360-mA injection currents exhibits a \u223c 22.3% enhancement, demonstrating that hybrid-PSSs are beneficial to apply in high-power LEDs.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-12-22", "authors": ["Wen-ChengKe", "Fang-WeiLee", "Chih-YungChiang", "Zhong-YiLiang", "Wei-KuoChen", "Tae-YeonSeong"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b10226"}

A Si nanoparticle anode prepared with citric acid (CA) has better capacity retention than one containing 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BA), but both electrodes outperform Si-PVDF. The Si-CA anode has an initial specific capacity of 3530 mA h/g and a first cycle efficiency of 82%. Surprisingly, the Si-CA electrode maintains a high specific capacity of \u223c2200 mA h/g after 250 cycles, corresponding to 64% capacity retention, which is similar to the Si prepared with long-chain poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). On the contrary, the silicon electrode prepared with PVDF has a fast capacity fade and retains only 980 mA h/g after 50 cycles. The IR and XPS data show that the Si-CA electrode has an SEI composed primarily of lithium citrate during the first 50 cycles, resulting from the electrochemical reduction of citric acid. Only low concentrations of electrolyte reduction products are observed. The lithium citrate layer derived from CA stabilizes the silicon surface and suppresses electrolyte reduction, which likely contributes to the enhanced cycling performance of the Si nanoparticle anode.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2016-12-21", "authors": ["Cao CuongNguyen", "Daniel MSeo", "K W D KChandrasiri", "Brett LLucht"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b04310"}

A key signature of relaxor-ferroelectric solid solutions is the existence of polar nanoregions, a nanoscale inhomogeneity, that coexist with normal ferroelectric domains. Despite two decades of extensive studies, the contribution of polar nanoregions to the underlying piezoelectric properties of relaxor ferroelectrics has yet to be established. Here we quantitatively characterize the contribution of polar nanoregions to the dielectric/piezoelectric responses of relaxor-ferroelectric crystals using a combination of cryogenic experiments and phase-field simulations. The contribution of polar nanoregions to the room-temperature dielectric and piezoelectric properties is in the range of 50-80%. A mesoscale mechanism is proposed to reveal the origin of the high piezoelectricity in relaxor ferroelectrics, where the polar nanoregions aligned in a ferroelectric matrix can facilitate polarization rotation.

{"title": "Development and Characterization a Single-Active-Chamber Piezoelectric Membrane Pump with Multiple Passive Check Valves.", "abstract": "In order to prevent the backward flow of piezoelectric pumps, this paper presents a single-active-chamber piezoelectric membrane pump with multiple passive check valves. Under the condition of a fixed total number of passive check valves, by means of changing the inlet valves and outlet valves' configuration, the pumping characteristics in terms of flow rate and backpressure are experimentally investigated. Like the maximum flow rate and backpressure, the testing results show that the optimal frequencies are significantly affected by changes in the number inlet valves and outlet valves. The variation ratios of the maximum flow rate and the maximum backpressure are up to 66% and less than 20%, respectively. Furthermore, the piezoelectric pump generally demonstrates very similar flow rate and backpressure characteristics when the number of inlet valves in one kind of configuration is the same as that of outlet valves in another configuration. The comparison indicates that the backflow from the pumping chamber to inlet is basically the same as the backflow from the outlet to the pumping chamber. No matter whether the number of inlet valves or the number of outlet valves is increased, the backflow can be effectively reduced. In addition, the backpressure fluctuation can be significantly suppressed with an increase of either inlet valves or outlet valves. It also means that the pump can prevent the backflow more effectively at the cost of power consumption. The pump is very suitable for conditions where more accurate flow rates are needed and wear and fatigue of check valves often occur.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-12-16", "authors": ["RonghuiZhang", "FengYou", "ZhihanLv", "ZhaochengHe", "HaiweiWang", "LingHuang"], "doi": "10.3390/s16122108\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/6/R01\n10.1016/S0925-4005(04)00108-X\n10.1007/s10404-008-0266-8\n10.1007/s00542-009-0804-7\n10.1109/T-SU.1978.31006\n10.1016/0924-4247(90)85039-7\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.11.068\n10.1177/1045389X15575082\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.02.038\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.08.027\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.08.027\n10.3901/CJME.2014.0516.097\n10.1177/1045389X11414074\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.07.026\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.03.062\n10.3390/s16111781\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.09.017\n10.3390/s16081266\n10.3390/s151129192\n10.1007/s00542-007-0462-6\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.026\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.06.029\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.01.016\n10.3901/CJME.2015.0411.043\n10.1088/0960-1317/10/2/329\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.08.012\n10.1088/0960-1317/10/3/323\n10.3901/CJME.2012.01.128\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/5/R01\n10.1016/j.mee.2012.04.036\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2012.01.014\n10.1088/0960-1317/17/8/029\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.07.012"}

{"title": "Learning New Sensorimotor Contingencies: Effects of Long-Term Use of Sensory Augmentation on the Brain and Conscious Perception.", "abstract": "Theories of embodied cognition propose that perception is shaped by sensory stimuli and by the actions of the organism. Following sensorimotor contingency theory, the mastery of lawful relations between own behavior and resulting changes in sensory signals, called sensorimotor contingencies, is constitutive of conscious perception. Sensorimotor contingency theory predicts that, after training, knowledge relating to new sensorimotor contingencies develops, leading to changes in the activation of sensorimotor systems, and concomitant changes in perception. In the present study, we spell out this hypothesis in detail and investigate whether it is possible to learn new sensorimotor contingencies by sensory augmentation. Specifically, we designed an fMRI compatible sensory augmentation device, the feelSpace belt, which gives orientation information about the direction of magnetic north via vibrotactile stimulation on the waist of participants. In a longitudinal study, participants trained with this belt for seven weeks in natural environment. Our EEG results indicate that training with the belt leads to changes in sleep architecture early in the training phase, compatible with the consolidation of procedural learning as well as increased sensorimotor processing and motor programming. The fMRI results suggest that training entails activity in sensory as well as higher motor centers and brain areas known to be involved in navigation. These neural changes are accompanied with changes in how space and the belt signal are perceived, as well as with increased trust in navigational ability. Thus, our data on physiological processes and subjective experiences are compatible with the hypothesis that new sensorimotor contingencies can be acquired using sensory augmentation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-12-14", "authors": ["Sabine UK\u00f6nig", "FrankSchumann", "JohannesKeyser", "CasparGoeke", "CarinaKrause", "SusanWache", "AlekseyLytochkin", "ManuelEbert", "VincentBrunsch", "BasilWahn", "KaiKaspar", "Saskia KNagel", "TobiasMeilinger", "HeinrichB\u00fclthoff", "ThomasWolbers", "ChristianB\u00fcchel", "PeterK\u00f6nig"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0166647\n10.1016/j.tics.2013.03.006\n10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093639\n10.1017/S0140525X12002294\n10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144216\n10.1038/nn1912\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.03.004\n10.3233/RNN-130338\n10.3233/RNN-2012-110219\n10.1016/j.concog.2009.10.006\n10.1126/science.1138838\n10.1016/j.cub.2015.02.063\n10.1016/j.concog.2014.06.006\n10.1016/j.conb.2005.06.003\n10.1016/j.neuron.2004.08.031\n10.1126/science.1062856\n10.1053/smrv.2001.0164\n10.1016/j.bbr.2007.02.037\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05894.x\n10.1093/brain/awh380\n10.1093/cercor/bhr253\n10.1242/jeb.022715\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2146-07.2007\n10.1093/cercor/bhh076\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.12.034\n10.1152/jn.00624.2011\n10.1016/S0079-6123(06)59014-4\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1319-11.2011\n10.1017/S0140525X07001392\n10.1093/brain/awh698\n10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01084\n10.1016/j.nlm.2008.10.004\n10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.029\n10.1016/j.conb.2006.03.005\n10.1038/2245\n10.1073/pnas.1221127110\n10.1093/cercor/bhi005\n10.1016/j.tics.2005.11.006\n10.1006/nimg.2000.0596\n10.1038/nn0104-10\n10.1016/j.humov.2005.10.001\n10.1186/1471-2202-14-113\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.037\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05371.x\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4705-04.2005\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4667-10.2011\n10.3389/fnint.2016.00013\n10.3389/fnhum.2014.00071\n10.1038/85201\n10.1038/380526a0\n10.1038/38278\n10.1016/j.neuron.2011.10.008\n10.1006/nimg.2002.1111\n10.1006/nimg.2000.0541\n10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125555"}

Finite element analysis has been employed to determine the mode of operation of the new piezocomposite devices and shows good correlation with that derived experimentally. Through a series of practical and analytical methods it has been shown that additional thickness mode resonances can be introduced into the structure by a simple machining process. The shaped composites described in this paper offer increased operational bandwidth. A simple example of a two step thickness design is described to validate and illustrate the principle.

{"title": "Small-molecule inhibition of STOML3 oligomerization reverses pathological mechanical hypersensitivity.", "abstract": "The skin is equipped with specialized mechanoreceptors that allow the perception of the slightest brush. Indeed, some mechanoreceptors can detect even nanometer-scale movements. Movement is transformed into electrical signals via the gating of mechanically activated ion channels at sensory endings in the skin. The sensitivity of Piezo mechanically gated ion channels is controlled by stomatin-like protein-3 (STOML3), which is required for normal mechanoreceptor function. Here we identify small-molecule inhibitors of STOML3 oligomerization that reversibly reduce the sensitivity of mechanically gated currents in sensory neurons and silence mechanoreceptors in vivo.

{"title": "Dynamic system model for ultrasonic lubrication in perpendicular configuration.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic lubrication can be achieved by superimposing ultrasonic vibrations onto the relative sliding velocity between two surfaces. Ultrasonic vibrations are typically generated by a piezoelectric actuator. Relative to the macroscopic velocity, the vibrations can be longitudinal, transverse, or perpendicular. Often considered as a purely interfacial effect, ultrasonic lubrication is in fact a system phenomenon incorporating the dynamics of the actuator, sliding surfaces, and surrounding structure. This article presents a dynamic system model for ultrasonic lubrication configured in perpendicular mode, as experimentally measured with a modified pin-on-disc tribometer. The framework includes a lumped-parameter, dynamic model for the tribometer, an electromechanical model for the piezoelectric transducer used to generated the ultrasonic vibrations in the tribometer, and a \"cube\" model for the contact mechanics between asperities. Electrical impedance, system vibrations, and friction reduction are examined. Results show a strong match between experiments and simulations with errors lower than 10%.

Polystyrene (PS) microparticles adhered to the substrate can be selected based on size, shape, or optical properties and repeatedly loaded into the optical trap using a piezoelectric (PZT) transducer. Separation from the substrate leads to charge transfer through contact electrification. The charge on the trapped microparticles is measured from the response of the particle motion to a step excitation of a uniform electric field. The particle is then placed onto a target location of the substrate in a controlled manner. Thus, the triboelectric charging profile of the selected PS microparticle can be measured and controlled through repeated cycles of trap loading followed by charge measurement.

Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) is a superhard material which ranks next to diamond; however, downsizing c-BN material below the 10 nm scale is rather challenging, and the interesting new properties of c-BN NCs remain unexplored and wide open. Herein we report an electrochemical shock method to prepare uniform c-BN NCs with a lateral size of only 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 nm and a thickness of only 0.74 \u00b1 0.3 nm at ambient temperature and pressure. The fabrication process is simple and fast, with c-BN NCs produced in just a few minutes. Most interestingly, the NCs exhibit excellent piezoelectric performance with a large recordable piezoelectric coefficient of 25.7 pC/N, which is almost 6 times larger than that from bulk c-BN and even competitive to conventional piezoelectric materials.

{"title": "A comparison study: The different impacts of sodium hypochlorite on PVDF and PSF ultrafiltration (UF) membranes.", "abstract": "Chemical ageing of ultrafiltration membranes related to drinking water operation is not a new problem, but literature documenting sieving properties and fouling behaviors of aged membranes are scarce. This paper shows how the surface chemistry evolution of polysulfone (PSF) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes can lead to the formation of distinct membrane properties when exposed to sodium hypochlorite solutions. The surface physicochemical evolutions of aged membranes are characterized based on chemical composition (ATR-FTIR and XPS), water contact angle analysis, and surface zeta potential test. The results indicate the ageing mechanism and evolutions between PSF and PVDF membranes are totally different. In addition, the retention ability and fouling propensity of the aged membrane are also investigated by three different kinds of foulant (Dextran/HA/BSA). Surface hydrophilization of aged PVDF membrane enhanced its retention toward neutral (Dextran) and hydrophilic charged foulant (BSA), but the fouling type of aged PVDF membranes remained the same, in spite of the initial flux increasing greatly. In terms of PSF membranes, pore enlargement could be verified by a seemingly inconsistent result of dextran sieving experiments and the decreased HA rejection rate. Moreover, the increased negative charge on aged PSF membrane surface have a great impact on its sieving property and fouling propensity, especially for the charged and hydrophilic BSA. With the regression data of Hermia's model, the main fouling type of aged PSF membranes was proven changed to pore blocking, and the changes can ascribe to its altered surface chemical characteristic and pore diameter.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2016-12-03", "authors": ["YangZhang", "JieWang", "FeiGao", "YongshengChen", "HongweiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.022"}

It is envisaged that packing different functional nanoparticles in a given phase of a co-continuous blend can impede the charge transport phenomenon and the overall dispersion state. Therefore, phase specific localisation can facilitate the tuning of the functional properties in biphasic blends. This strategy was adopted here wherein conducting MWNTs and magnetic FeNi particles were surface tailored to position them in different phases during processing. As the functional particles prefer the PVDF phase by virtue of thermodynamics, by harnessing amine functional moieties on the surface, their localisation can be tuned to position them in the SMA phase (due to amine-anhydride coupling).

The proposed system exhibits the advantages of simple structure, high mechanical integration, lack of electromagnetic interference, and lack of lubrication requirement, and hence shows potential application to robotic rovers for planetary exploration. The tracked mobile system is comprised of a sandwich actuating mechanism and a metal track. The actuating mechanism includes a sandwich piezoelectric transducer and two annular parts symmetrically placed at either end of the transducer, while the metal track is tensioned along the outer surfaces of the annular parts. Traveling waves with the same rotational direction are generated in the two annular parts, producing the microscopic elliptical motions of the surface particles on the annular parts. In this situation, if the pre-load is applied properly, the metal track can be driven by friction force to achieve bidirectional movement. At first, the finite element method was adopted to conduct the modal analysis and harmonic response analysis of the actuating mechanism, and the vibration characteristics were measured to confirm the operating principle. Then the optimal driving frequency of the system prototype, namely 35.1kHz, was measured by frequency sensitivity experiments.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of impact signals analyses to assess the primary stability of AC implants inserted in cadaveric specimens.\nAC implants with various sizes were inserted in 12 cadaveric hips following the same protocol as the one employed in the clinic, leading to 86 different configurations. A hammer instrumented with a piezoelectric force sensor was then used to measure the variation of the force as a function of time produced during the impact between the hammer and the ancillary. Then, an indicator I was determined for each impact based on the impact momentum.

Method Non-contact piezoelectric print techniques were applied to fluorescence protein microarray to reduce the cost of prey antibody. Serum samples from patients with HCC and healthy control subjects were collected and evaluated for the presence of AFP using a novel fluorescence protein microarray. To validate the fluorescence protein microarray, serum samples were tested for AFP using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

When the AFP cut-off value was set at 20\u2009ng/ml, the fluorescence protein microarray had a sensitivity of 91.67% and a specificity of 93.24% for detecting serum AFP. Serum AFP quantified via fluorescence protein microarray had a similar diagnostic performance compared with ELISA in distinguishing patients with HCC from healthy control subjects (area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.906 for fluorescence protein microarray; 0.880 for ELISA).

In this study, we assessed the acoustic properties (speed of sound, acoustic impedance and attenuation coefficient) of three different materials (agarose, polyacrylamide and polydimethylsiloxane) at different concentrations or cross-linking levels and doped with different concentrations of barium titanate ceramic nanoparticles. The selected materials, besides different mechanical features (stiffness from few kPa to 1.6MPa), showed a wide range of acoustic properties (speed of sound from 1022 to 1555m/s, acoustic impedance from 1.02 to 1.67MRayl and attenuation coefficient from 0.2 to 36.5dB/cm), corresponding to ranges in which natural soft tissues can fall. We demonstrated that this knowledge can be used to build tissue-mimicking phantoms for ultrasound-based medical procedures and that the mentioned measurements enable to stimulate cells with a highly controlled ultrasound dose, taking into account the attenuation due to the cell-supporting scaffold. Finally, we were able to correlate for the first time the bioeffect on human fibroblasts, triggered by piezoelectric barium titanate nanoparticles activated by low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, with a precise ultrasound dose delivered.

{"title": "Continuous micro-vortex-based nanoparticle manipulation via focused surface acoustic waves.", "abstract": "Despite increasing demand in the manipulation of nanoscale objects for next generation biological and industrial processes, there is a lack of methods for reliable separation, concentration and purification of nanoscale objects. Acoustic methods have proven their utility in contactless manipulation of microscale objects mainly relying on the acoustic radiation effect, though the influence of acoustic streaming has typically prevented manipulation at smaller length scales. In this work, however, we explicitly take advantage of the strong acoustic streaming in the vicinity of a highly focused, high frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) beam emanating from a series of focused 6 \u03bcm substrate wavelength interdigital transducers patterned on a piezoelectric lithium niobate substrate and actuated with a 633 MHz sinusoidal signal. This streaming field serves to focus fluid streamlines such that incoming particles interact with the acoustic field similarly regardless of their initial starting positions, and results in particle displacements that would not be possible with a travelling acoustic wave force alone. This streaming-induced manipulation of nanoscale particles is maximized with the formation of micro-vortices that extend the width of the microfluidic channel even with the imposition of a lateral flow, occurring when the streaming-induced flow velocities are an order of magnitude larger than the lateral one. We make use of this acoustic streaming to demonstrate the continuous and differential focusing of 100 nm, 300 nm and 500 nm particles.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-11-25", "authors": ["David JCollins", "ZhichaoMa", "JongyoonHan", "YeAi"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc01142j"}

It has been suggested that these changes are caused by an increase in work of breathing.\nWe studied the effects of C-Flex on work of breathing and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure as compared to fixed CPAP.\nWork of breathing was analyzed in 24 patients with obstructive sleep apnea during treatment with fixed CPAP and C-Flex with 3 different pressure relief settings in a randomized order during rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. Work of breathing was assessed on a breath-by-breath basis using a piezoelectric esophageal pressure catheter and a pneumotachograph for measuring airflow.\nWe found there was no increase in inspiratory work of breathing observed using C-Flex compared to fixed CPAP. Instead, we found a linear decrease in inspiratory work of breathing with increasing pressure relief, with a mean difference of 1.22 J/min between CPAP and maximum pressure release (C-Flex 3; 90% of the value with nasal CPAP); however, the decrease was not statistically significant. The decrease in inspiratory work of breathing associated with C-Flex has a significant inverse correlation with BMI.\nThe C-Flex technology does not change work of breathing but shows a tendency towards a reduction of inspiratory work of breathing in patients with a lower BMI using higher C-Flex. The effect is probably caused by diminishing airway resistance generated by the positive end-expiratory pressure.

The morphological analysis via SEM indicated that the formation mechanism of these hydrophilically-modified membranes was a combined NIPS and TIPS process. As the total polymer concentration increased, the tensile strength of the membranes increased; meanwhile, the membrane pore size, porosity and water flux decreased. With the PVDF/PVA blend ratio increased from 10:0 to 8:2, the membrane pore size and water flux increased. The dynamic water contact angle of these membranes showed that the hydrophilic properties of PVDF/PVA blend membranes were prominently improved.

Cementum can influence the activities of periodontal cells and may play an important regulatory role in periodontal treatment. The ideal method for periodontal therapy involves removal of biofilm, calculus and endotoxin while preserving root cementum.\nForty-eight caries free, single-rooted teeth in patients diagnosed with severe chronic periodontitis were treated using four different methods prior to extraction. The teeth were instrumented subgingivally at one approximal site either by hand curettes (HC), piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers (U), piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers following air polishing (U + AP) or air polishing (AP) alone. Following extraction of teeth, instrumented and non-instrumented sites were analysed with a dissecting microscope and SEM for measurement of the amount of and surface characteristics of residual cementum.\nThe percentage of coronal cementum remaining following subgingival instrumentation was 84% for U, 80% for U + AP, 94% for AP and 65% for HC. Although subgingival instrumentation of apical portions of the cementum demonstrated 6% less retained cementum in comparison with coronal portions, the amount of retained cementum with AP was still significantly greater than with HC.

Endodontic microsurgery of anterior teeth with an intact cortical plate and large periapical lesion generally involves removal of a significant amount of healthy bone in order to enucleate the diseased tissue and manage root ends. In the reported cases, apicoectomy was performed on the lateral incisors of two patients. A piezoelectric device was used to create and elevate a bony window at the surgical site, instead of drilling and destroying bone while making an osteotomy with conventional burs. Routine microsurgical procedures - lesion enucleation, root-end resection, and filling - were carried out through this window preparation. The bony window was repositioned to the original site and the soft tissue sutured. The cases were re-evaluated clinically and radiographically after a period of 12 - 24 months. At follow-up, radiographic healing was observed. No additional grafting material was needed despite the extent of the lesions. The indication for this procedure is when teeth present with an intact or near-intact buccal cortical plate and a large apical lesion to preserve the bone and use it as an autologous graft.", "journal": "Restorative dentistry & endodontics", "date": "2016-11-17", "authors": ["ViolaHirsch", "Meetu RKohli", "SyngcukKim"], "doi": "10.5395/rde.2016.41.4.310"}
{"title": "3C-Silicon Carbide Microresonators for Timing and Frequency Reference.", "abstract": "In the drive to miniaturise and integrate reference oscillator components, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonators are excellent candidates to replace quartz crystals. Silicon is the most utilised resonator structural material due to its associated well-established fabrication processes. However, when operation in harsh environments is required, cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) is an excellent candidate for use as a structural material, due to its robustness, chemical inertness and high temperature stability. In order to actuate 3C-SiC resonators, electrostatic, electrothermal and piezoelectric methods have been explored. Both electrothermal and piezoelectric actuation can be accomplished with simpler fabrication and lower driving voltages, down to 0.5 V, compared to electrostatic actuation. The vibration amplitude at resonance can be maximised by optimising the design and location of the electrodes. Electrical read out of the resonator can be performed with electrostatic or piezoelectric transduction. Finally, a great deal of research has focused on tuning the resonant frequency of a 3C-SiC resonator by adjusting the DC bias applied to the electrodes, with a higher (up to 160-times) tuning range for electrothermal tuning compared to piezoelectric tuning. Electrothermal tuning lowers the frequency, while piezoelectric tuning can be used to raise the frequency.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2016-11-15", "authors": ["Graham SWood", "BorisSvili\u010di\u0107", "EnricoMastropaolo", "RebeccaCheung"], "doi": "10.3390/mi7110208\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.240\n10.1109/MMM.2014.2321101\n10.1109/MMM.2009.933592\n10.1109/MMM.2009.933593\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/1/013001\n10.1016/S0257-8972(99)00374-6\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00335-0\n10.1088/0022-3727/40/11/012\n10.1002/pssb.200844135\n10.1109/TED.2002.807445\n10.1109/JMEMS.2005.844747\n10.1109/JMEMS.2005.844748\n10.3390/s8095759\n10.1049/el.2010.3051\n10.1063/1.2709620\n10.1088/0957-4484/17/5/057\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.01.045\n10.1109/JMEMS.2012.2189357\n10.1117/1.3013549\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00518-5\n10.1088/0957-0233/20/9/092001\n10.1109/5.704265\n10.1063/1.359745\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.09.009\n10.1063/1.2222318\n10.1063/1.106786\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.615-617.625\n10.1016/S0924-4247(01)00810-X\n10.1063/1.372087\n10.1016/S0254-0584(99)00207-2\n10.1116/1.589858\n10.1063/1.1534908\n10.1088/0022-3727/37/13/012\n10.1088/0022-3727/36/5/310\n10.1116/1.1627804\n10.1016/j.mee.2004.12.015\n10.1116/1.3244622\n10.1109/84.788626\n10.1116/1.3498760\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.05.005\n10.1109/84.650129\n10.1016/j.microrel.2010.05.011\n10.1016/j.mee.2009.08.012\n10.1116/1.3013862\n10.1109/4.839911\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.886012\n10.1016/j.sna.2003.10.021\n10.1109/4.753677\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/11/115027\n10.1016/j.mee.2015.02.049\n10.1016/j.mee.2014.01.007\n10.1109/LED.2011.2177513\n10.1016/j.proeng.2014.11.706\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.02.023\n10.1116/1.4767441\n10.1016/j.mee.2012.03.008"}

{"title": "Development of an FPW Biosensor with Low Insertion Loss and High Fabrication Yield for Detection of Carcinoembryonic Antigen.", "abstract": "In the last two decades, various flexural plate-wave (FPW)-based biosensors with low phase velocity, low operation frequency, high sensitivity, and short response time, have been developed. However, conventional FPW transducers have low fabrication yield because controlling the thickness of silicon/isolation/metal/piezoelectric multilayer floating thin-plate is difficult. Additionally, conventional FPW devices usually have high insertion loss because of wave energy dissipation to the silicon substrate or outside area of the output interdigital transducers (IDTs). These two disadvantages hinder the application of FPW devices. To reduce the high insertion loss of FPW devices, we designed two focus-type IDTs (fan-shaped and circular, respectively) that can effectively confine the launched wave energy, and adopted a focus-type silicon-grooved reflective grating structure (RGS) that can reduce the wave propagation loss. To accurately control the thickness of the silicon thin-plate and substantially improve the fabrication yield of FPW transducers, a 60 \u00b0C/27 \u00b0C two-step anisotropic wet etching process was developed. Compared with conventional FPW devices (with parallel-type IDTs and without RGS), the proposed FPW devices have lower insertion loss (36.04 dB) and higher fabrication yield (63.88%). Furthermore, by using cystamine-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM) nanotechnology, we used the improved FPW device to develop a novel FPW-based carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) biosensor for detection of colorectal cancer, and this FPW-CEA biosensor has a low detection limit (5 ng/mL), short response time (<10 min), high sensitivity (60.16-70.06 cm\u00b2/g), and high sensing linearity (R-square = 0.859-0.980).", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-11-12", "authors": ["Je-WeiLan", "I-YuHuang", "Yu-ChengLin", "Chang-YuLin", "Jian-LinChen", "Chia-HsuHsieh"], "doi": "10.3390/s16111729\n10.1088/0964-1726/6/6/002\n10.1016/S0041-624X(97)00146-7\n10.3390/s90705740\n10.1016/j.snb.2008.01.048\n10.1117/1.JMM.12.1.013017\n10.1039/a606964i\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.12.065\n10.1109/84.650131\n10.1063/1.2891577"}

The thermal and acoustic responses of the materials may reflect the important research parameters such as penetration depth, power consumption, and temperature change used for the practical models of the system. This paper emphasizes the approach for orthopedic application where the bone densities were considered in simulation to designate the type of human bones.\nThermal energy pulses were applied in order to study the penetration depth, the maximum temperature change; spatially and dynamically, and the acoustic pressure distribution over the bone thickness. The study was performed to optimize the amount of energy introduced into the materials that generate the temperature value for high resolution beyond the noise level.\nThree different energy pulses were used; 1\u00a0J, 3\u00a0J and 5\u00a0J. The thermal energy applied to the four bone materials, cancellous bone, cortical bone, red bone marrow, and yellow bone marrow were producing relative changes in temperature. The maximum change ranges from 0.5\u00a0K to 2\u00a0K for the applied pulses. The acoustic pressure also ranges from 210 to 220\u00a0dB among the various types of bones.\nThe results obtained from simulation suggest that a practical model utilizing infra-red scanning probe and piezoelectric devices may serve for the orthopedic diagnostic approach.

The bimorph actuator can deflect toward the graphene side under electrical stimulus, due to the differences in coefficient of thermal expansion between the two layers and the converse piezoelectric effect and electrostrictive property of the PVDF layer.

{"title": "Structural Solution to Enhance the Sensitivity of a Self-Powered Pressure Sensor for an Artificial Tactile System.", "abstract": "Structural design factors of sensor units have been studied in order to enhance the sensitivity of pressure sensors based on utilizing a piezoelectric material for an artificial tactile sensor. In this study, we have primarily demonstrated the effect of a square pattern array design in a pressure sensor using ZnO nanowires. Nanowires grown on the edge of cells can be bent easily because of growth direction, density control, and buckling effect. Since smaller square pattern arrays induce a higher circumference to cell area ratio, if one sensor unit consists of many micro-level square pattern arrays, the design enhances the piezoelectric efficiency and the sensitivity. As a result, 20 \u03bc m\u00d720 \u03bc m cell arrays showed three times higher pressure sensitivity than 250 \u03bc m\u00d7250 \u03bc m cell array structures at a pressure range from 4 kPa to 14 kPa. The induced piezoelectric voltage with the same pressure level also increased drastically. Therefore, the square pattern array design is more appropriate for a high-sensitive pressure sensor than a simple one-body cell design for tactile systems, and it has the advantage of better power efficiency, which is also important for artificial tactile systems.

They are microelectromechanical devices fabricated using silicon micromachining techniques, developed in the last two decades in many laboratories. The interest for this novel transducer technology relies on its full compatibility with standard integrated circuit technology that makes it possible to integrate on the same chip the transducers and the electronics, thus enabling the realization of extremely low-cost and high-performance devices, including both 1-D or 2-D arrays. Being capacitive transducers, CMUTs require a high bias voltage to be properly operated in pulse-echo imaging applications. The typical bias supply residual ripple of high-quality high-voltage (HV) generators is in the millivolt range, which is comparable with the amplitude of the received echo signals, and it is particularly difficult to minimize. The aim of this paper is to analyze the classical CMUT biasing circuits, highlighting the features of each one, and to propose two novel HV generator architectures optimized for CMUT biasing applications. The first circuit proposed is an ultralow-residual ripple (<5 [Formula: see text]) HV generator that uses an extremely stable sinusoidal power oscillator topology. The second circuit employs a commercially available integrated step-up converter characterized by a particularly efficient switching topology. The circuit is used to bias the CMUT by charging a buffer capacitor synchronously with the pulsing sequence, thus reducing the impact of the switching noise on the received echo signals.

{"title": "Driving frequency optimization of a piezoelectric transducer and the power supply development.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric transducers are commonly operated at their resonance frequency. However, from a power dissipation standpoint, this is not the ideal driving frequency. In this paper, an optimized driving frequency in between the resonance and antiresonance frequencies is proposed for the piezo-transducer. First, the optimum driving frequency is characterized using a constant vibration velocity measurement method. The actual input power reveals the lowest power dissipation frequency between the resonance and the antiresonance frequencies, where the transducer behaves inductive. The electrical parameters of the transducer are then determined by an equivalent circuit formulation, which is useful for the electrical circuit analysis of the driver design. A Class E resonant inverter is used to design a capacitive output impedance driver at the optimized frequency by utilizing a series capacitor. Compared with the traditional resonance drive, driving at the optimized frequency reduces the required power by approximately half according to the measurements performed.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2016-11-03", "authors": ["XiaoxiaoDong", "TaoYuan", "MinqiangHu", "HusainShekhani", "YuichiMaida", "TonshakuTou", "KenjiUchino"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4963920"}

Positive surface charge was imparted to an alkaline-treated PVDF membrane by aminosilane functionalization, which enabled irreversible binding of negatively charged silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) to the membrane through electrostatic attraction. The membrane with grafted SiNPs was then coated with fluoroalkylsilane (perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane) to lower the membrane surface energy. Results from contact angle measurements with mineral oil and surfactant solution demonstrated that overlaying SiNPs with ultralow surface energy significantly enhanced the wetting resistance of the membrane against low surface tension liquids. We also evaluated desalination performance of the modified membrane in direct contact membrane distillation with a synthetic wastewater containing surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and mineral oil, as well as with shale gas produced water.

Narrowband evoked responses were derived by sequentially subtracting responses obtained with noise at lower high-pass cutoff frequencies from those obtained with noise having higher cutoff frequencies. The results revealed little contribution to the click-evoked brainstem response from frequency bands below 10 kHz and, in dolphins with full hearing bandwidth, the largest amplitude derived band evoked responses were obtained from the highest frequency bands. Narrowband latencies decreased with increasing frequency and were adequately fit with a power function exhibiting relatively large change in latency with frequency below \u223c30 kHz and little change above \u223c30\u2009kHz.

The circular diaphragm resonator was fabricated with thickness of 4.5 \u00b5m and diameter of 140 \u00b5m. A PZT thin film of 0.75 \u00b5m was patterned on the top surface for the purposes of excitation and vibration sensing. The device showed a resonant frequency of 5.8 MHz for the (1, 1) mode. An electronic interface circuit was designed to cancel out the large static and parasitic capacitance allowing for electrical detection of the mechanical vibration thereby enabling the frequency split between the sense and reference mode to be measured accurately. The extracted motional current, proportional to the vibration velocity, was fed back to the drive to effectively increase the Q factor, and therefore device sensitivity, by more than a factor of 8. A software phase-locked loop was implemented to automatically track the resonant frequencies to allow for faster and accurate resonance detection.

Monitoring sleep efficiency can provide significant information about health conditions. As an attempt to facilitate less cumbersome monitoring of sleep efficiency, our study aimed to suggest new predictors of sleep efficiency that enable reliable and unconstrained estimation of sleep efficiency during awake resting period. We hypothesized that the autonomic nervous system activity observed before falling asleep might be associated with sleep efficiency. To assess autonomic activity, heart rate variability and breathing parameters were analyzed for 5 min. Using the extracted parameters as explanatory variables, stepwise multiple linear regression analyses and k-fold cross-validation tests were performed with 240 electrocardiographic and thoracic volume change signal recordings to develop the sleep efficiency prediction model. The developed model's sleep efficiency predictability was evaluated using 60 piezoelectric sensor signal recordings. The regression model, established using the ratio of the power of the low- and high-frequency bands of the heart rate variability signal and the average peak inspiratory flow value, provided an absolute error (mean \u00b1 SD) of 2.18% \u00b1 1.61% and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.94 (p < 0.01) between the sleep efficiency predictive values and the reference values.

{"title": "Creating flat-top X-ray beams by applying surface profiles of alternating curvature to deformable piezo bimorph mirrors.", "abstract": "Beam shaping is becoming increasingly important for synchrotron X-ray applications. Although routine for visible light lasers, this is challenging for X-rays due to the limited source coherence and extreme optical tolerances required for the shaping mirrors. In deliberate defocusing, even surface errors <5\u2005nm r.m.s. introduce damagingly large striations into the reflected beam. To counteract such problems, surface modifications with alternating concave and convex curvature on equal segments were polished onto the surface of non-active mirrors of fixed curvature. Such optics are useful for providing a fixed size of X-ray beam, but do not provide the adaptability required by many experiments. In contrast, deformable piezo bimorph mirrors permit a continuous range of X-ray beam sizes and shapes. A new theory is developed for applying non-periodic modifications of alternating curvature to optical surfaces. The position and length of the segments may be freely chosen. For the first time, surface modifications of alternating curvature are applied to bimorph mirrors to generate non-Gaussian X-ray beam profiles of specified width. The new theory's freedom is exploited to choose the segments to match the polishing errors of medium wavelength (>10\u2005mm) and the piezos' influence on the mirror's figure. Five- and seven-segment modifications of alternating curvature are calculated and verified by visible light and X-ray metrology. The latter yields beam profiles with less striation than those made by defocusing. Remaining beam striations are explained by applying geometrical optics to the deviations from the ideal surface modifications of alternating curvature.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2016-10-28", "authors": ["John PSutter", "Simon GAlcock", "YogeshKashyap", "IoanaNistea", "HongchangWang", "KawalSawhney"], "doi": "10.1107/S1600577516013308"}

Accurate identification of Chinese liquor flavors is not always possible through professional sommeliers' subjective assessment. A novel polymer piezoelectric sensor electric nose (e-nose) can be applied to distinguish Chinese liquors because of its excellent ability in imitating human senses by using sensor arrays and pattern recognition systems. The sensor, based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) principle is comprised of a quartz piezoelectric crystal plate sandwiched between two specific gas-sensitive polymer coatings. Chinese liquors are identified by obtaining the resonance frequency value changes of each sensor using the e-nose. However, the QCM principle failed to completely account for a particular phenomenon: we found that the resonance frequency values fluctuated in the stable state. For better understanding the phenomenon, a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation using the finite volume method is employed to study the influence of the flow-induced forces to the resonance frequency fluctuation of each sensor in the sensor box. A dedicated procedure was developed for modeling the flow of volatile gas from Chinese liquors in a realistic scenario to give reasonably good results with fair accuracy. The flow-induced forces on the sensors are displayed from the perspective of their spatial-temporal and probability density distributions.

To relate these acoustic measurements to cavitation development, the dynamics of the cavitation bubble structures was observed in three Newtonian, optically transparent liquids with significantly different physical properties: water, ethanol, and glycerine. Each liquid was treated at 20kHz with a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer coupled to a titanium sonotrode with a tip diameter of 40mm. Two different transducer power levels were deployed: 50% and 100%, with the maximum power corresponding to a peak-to-peak amplitude of 17\u03bcm. The cavitation structures and the flow patterns were filmed with a digital camera. To investigate the effect of distance from the ultrasound source on the cavitation intensity, acoustic emissions were measured with the cavitometer at two points: below the sonotrode and near the edge of the experimental vessel. The behaviour of the three tested liquids was very different, implying that their physical parameters played a decisive role in the establishment of the cavitation regime.

{"title": "Perturbation of a radially oscillating single-bubble by a micron-sized object.", "abstract": "A single bubble oscillating in a levitation cell is acoustically monitored by a piezo-ceramics microphone glued on the cell external wall. The correlation of the filtered signal recorded over distant cycles on one hand, and its harmonic content on the other hand, are shown to carry rich information on the bubble stability and existence. For example, the harmonic content of the signal is shown to increase drastically once air is fully dissociated in the bubble, and the resulting pure argon bubble enters into the upper branch of the sonoluminescence regime. As a consequence, the bubble disappearance can be unambiguously detected by a net drop in the harmonic content. On the other hand, we perturb a stable sonoluminescing bubble by approaching a micron-sized fiber. The bubble remains unperturbed until the fiber tip is approached within a critical distance, below which the bubble becomes unstable and disappears. This distance can be easily measured by image treatment, and is shown to scale roughly with 3-4 times the bubble maximal radius. The bubble disappearance is well detected by the drop of the microphone harmonic content, but several thousands of periods after the bubble actually disappeared. The delay is attributed to the slow extinction of higher modes of the levitation cell, excited by the bubble oscillation. The acoustic detection method should however allow the early detection and imaging of non-predictable perturbations of the bubble by foreign micron-sized objects, such as crystals or droplets.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2016-10-25", "authors": ["WMontes-Quiroz", "FBaillon", "OLouisnard", "BBoyer", "FEspitalier"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2016.10.004"}

Implants were inserted at the second premolar (mesial implant) and second molar (distal implant) positions in the edentulous area. An experimental ISRPD was fabricated of acrylic resin with a cobalt-chromium alloy framework. Loads on the implants and abutment tooth were measured with piezoelectric force transducers. The load on the residual ridge was measured with pressure-sensitive film. A vertical load of 100N was applied at the first molar region. Measurements were made under the following three conditions: with conventional removable partial denture (CRPD), with mesial-implant-supported removable partial denture (MISRPD), and with distal-implant-supported removable partial denture (DISRPD). In each condition, the unused implants were made inactive by eliminating contact with the inner surface of the denture.\nThe load on the abutment tooth was greatest with DISRPD, followed by CRPD and MISRPD (P<0.01).

For the case of wheel rotation, the present study investigates the effectiveness of a piezoelectric energy harvester, with the application of stochastic resonance to optimize the efficiency of energy harvesting. It is hypothesized that when the wheel rotates at variable speeds, the energy harvester is subjected to on-road noise as ambient excitations and a tangentially acting gravity force as a periodic modulation force, which can stimulate stochastic resonance. The energy harvester was miniaturized with a bistable cantilever structure, and the on-road noise was measured for the implementation of a vibrator in an experimental setting. A validation experiment revealed that the harvesting system was optimized to capture power that was approximately 12 times that captured under only on-road noise excitation and 50 times that captured under only the periodic gravity force. Moreover, the investigation of up-sweep excitations with increasing rotational frequency confirmed that stochastic resonance is effective in optimizing the performance of the energy harvester, with a certain bandwidth of vehicle speeds.

The DynaMesh-CICAT (PVDF) was implanted in the control group. Adhesion formation was macroscopically evaluated and scored after 7 and 21\u00a0days.\nAll animals except two presented intra-abdominal adhesions. None of the meshes examined in the study demonstrated to prevent adhesions. C-QUR/FX reduced adhesion formation at 7\u00a0days' follow-up compared with all other meshes but by 21\u00a0days this effect was diminished. Between 7 and 21\u00a0days adhesion extension significantly decreased for TiMesh. TAS did not show significant modifications between 7 and 21\u00a0days' follow-up for each mesh.\nThe combined porous meshes tested in the present study demonstrated to reduce but not to prevent the adhesion formation, even if with some differences. Combined porous meshes could be chosen instead of simple meshes for retro-rectus preperitoneal prosthetic ventral hernia repair.", "journal": "Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["LD'Amore", "FCeci", "SMattia", "MFabbi", "PNegro", "FGossetti"], "doi": "10.1007/s10029-016-1541-3"}
{"title": "Piezo1 expression increases in rat bladder after partial bladder outlet obstruction.", "abstract": "For patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), storage symptoms due to bladder dysfunction are bothersome, and that mechanism elucidation is needed. Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel, is believed to play a role in sensing bladder distension. To investigate the involvement of Piezo1 in bladder dysfunction, we examined the expression and distribution of Piezo1 and neurofilament (NF-L) to understand pathological alterations in rat bladders with partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO), an animal model of BPH.\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham or pBOO operations. On days 3, 7, and 14 after pBOO, Piezo1 mRNA levels in the bladder were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of light NF-L was also examined by western blotting. On day 7, the distributions of Piezo1 were examined by in situ hybridization.\nThe expression levels of Piezo1 mRNA in whole bladder were significantly increased from days 3 to 14 after pBOO. On day 7 in pBOO rats, significant increases in Piezo1 mRNA were observed in the detrusor layer as well as the suburothelial layer, while the predominant distribution was observed in the urothelium of sham rats. Coinciding with the increase in Piezo1, the decreases in NF-L expression were observed in the bladder from pBOO rats.\nThe increase in Piezo1 in pBOO rat bladders might be involved in the compensatory mechanism associated with bladder denervation including the decrease in NF-L. Inhibition of Piezo-1 may be a new therapeutic approach to ameliorate the storage dysfunction shown in pBOO.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["MaiMichishita", "KazuoYano", "Ken-IchiTomita", "OsamuMatsuzaki", "Ken-IchiKasahara"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.017"}

Detailed calculations are performed for anti-plane transverse waves propagating obliquely or vertically in the system. The correctness of the present method is verified by comparing the numerical results with those obtained by applying the transfer matrix method in the case of nonlocal perfect interfaces. The effects of nonlocal interface imperfections are considered by comparing with the nonlocal perfect interfaces. In addition, the influences of the piezoelectric constant, the nanoscale size, the impedance ratio and the incidence angle on the cut-off frequency and band structures are investigated and discussed in detail. Numerical results show that the nonlocal interface discontinuity has more obvious effect on the low-frequency band structures at the microscopic scale than at the macroscopic scale. Furthermore, at the macroscopic scale, the nonlocal interface imperfection has an obvious effect on the high frequency waves, but the effect on the low frequency waves is not obvious, and the nonlocal interface imperfection has no effect on the cut-off frequency at the microscopic scale.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["ZhizhongYan", "ChunqiuWei", "ChuanzengZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.09.009"}

First, the secular equations in the transverse isotropic piezoelectric/piezomagnetic half spaces are derived from the general dynamic equation. Then, the state vectors at piezoelectric and piezomagnetic half spaces are related to the amplitudes of various possible waves. The state transfer equation of the functionally graded slab is derived from the equations of motion by the reduction of order, and the transfer matrix of the functionally gradient slab is obtained by solving the state transfer equation with the spatial-varying coefficient. Finally, the continuous interface conditions are used to lead to the resultant algebraic equations. The algebraic equations are solved to obtain the amplitude ratios of various waves which are further used to obtain the energy reflection and transmission coefficients of various waves. The numerical results are shown graphically and are validated by the energy conservation law. Based on the numerical results on the fives of gradient profiles, the influences of the graded slab on the wave propagation are discussed.

Although, the nonlinearity of piezoelectric transducer impedance has been discussed in different literatures, the trend of the nonlinearity at different frequencies with respect to excitation voltage variations has not been clearly investigated in practice. In this paper, to demonstrate how the nonlinearity behaves, a sandwich piezoceramic transducer was excited at different frequencies. Different excitation signals were generated using a linear power amplifier and a multilevel converter within a range of 30-200V. Empirical relation was developed to express the resistance of the piezoelectric transducer as a nonlinear function of both excitation voltage and resonance frequency. The impedance measurements revealed that at higher voltage ranges, the piezoelectric transducer can be easily saturated. Also, it was shown that for the developed ultrasound system composed of two transducers (one transmitter and one receiver), the output voltage measured across receiver is a function of a voltage across the resistor in the RLC branches and is related to the resonance frequencies of the ultrasound transducer.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-10-09", "authors": ["NegarehGhasemi", "FiruzZare", "PooyaDavari", "MahindaVilathgamuwa", "ArindamGhosh", "ChristianLangton", "PeterWeber"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.09.023"}
{"title": "Familial Gordon syndrome associated with a PIEZO2 mutation.", "abstract": "Gordon syndrome or distal arthrogryposis type 3 is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by contractures of upper and lower limbs. It is distinguishable from other forms of distal arthrogryposis by cleft palate and short stature. Recently, Gordon syndrome has been associated to heterozygous mutations in the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 gene (PIEZO2). Different mutations of this gene also cause distal arthrogryposis type 5 and Marden-Walker syndrome. Dysfunction of this ion channel provides pleiotropic effects on joints, ocular muscles, and bone development. Here, we present a family with three affected individuals exhibiting multiple contractures (metacarpo-phalangeal and interphalangeal joints as well as elbow, shoulder, knee, and ankle joints), clubfeet, short stature, bifid uvula/cleft palate, and a distinct facial phenotype including ptosis. In addition, mild intellectual disability and delay in psychomotor development are obvious. The multigenerational phenotypic spectrum of Gordon syndrome is present in the 37-year-old father, his 4-year-old son and a male neonate showing typical signs of arthrogryposis in the prenatal ultrasound examination already seen at 13 week of gestation. In all affected family members, we identified the PIEZO2 mutation c.8057G>A (p.Arg2686His) by Sanger sequencing. Our analysis indicated that mild delay in psychomotor development and intellectual disability could be part of the phenotypic spectrum of Gordon syndrome. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

Glucose-excited (GE) and -inhibited (GI) neurons are located throughout the VMN and may play a critical role in glucose and energy homeostasis. Within the ventrolateral portion of the VMN (VL-VMN), glucose sensing neurons and estrogen receptor (ER) distributions overlap. We therefore tested the hypothesis that VL-VMN glucose sensing neurons were sexually dimorphic and regulated by 17\u03b2-estradiol (17\u03b2E).\nElectrophysiological recordings of VL-VMN glucose sensing neurons in brain slices isolated from age- and weight-matched female and male mice were performed in the presence and absence of 17\u03b2E.\nWe found a new class of VL-VMN GI neurons whose response to low glucose was transient despite continued exposure to low glucose. Heretofore, we refer to these newly identified VL-VMN GI neurons as 'adapting' or AdGI neurons. We found a sexual dimorphic response to low glucose, with male nonadapting GI neurons, but not AdGI neurons, responding more robustly to low glucose than those from females. 17\u03b2E blunted the response of both nonadapting GI and AdGI neurons to low glucose in both males and females, which was mediated by activation of estrogen receptor \u03b2 and inhibition of AMP-activated kinase. In contrast, 17\u03b2E had no impact on GE or non-glucose sensing neurons in either sex.\nThese data suggest sex differences and estrogenic regulation of VMN hypothalamic glucose sensing may contribute to the sexual dimorphism in glucose homeostasis.", "journal": "Molecular metabolism", "date": "2016-10-01", "authors": ["Ammy MSantiago", "Deborah JClegg", "Vanessa HRouth"], "doi": "10.1016/j.molmet.2016.08.002"}

This device allows for the mechanical study of micro-fibers with diameters in the range between 10 and 100\u03bcm and lengths of several hundred micrometers. By exerting forces in the mN range, the device enables an important force range to be accessed between that of atomic force microscopy and macroscopic stress-strain measurement devices. The load is varied using a stiffness-calibrated glass micro-needle driven by a piezo-translator during simultaneous Raman microscopy imaging. The method enables experiments probing the molecular response of micro-fibers to external stress. This set-up was applied to biomimetic non-mineralized and mineralized collagen micro-fibers revealing that above 30% mineralization the proline-related Raman band shows a pronounced response to stress, which is not observed in non-mineralized collagen. This molecular response coincides with a strong increase in the Young's modulus from 0.5 to 6GPa for 0% and 70% mineralized collagen, respectively. Our results are consistent with a progressive interlocking of the collagen triple-helices by apatite nanocrystals as the degree of mineralization increases.\nCollagen and apatite are the main constituents regulating the mechanical properties of bone. Hence, an improved understanding of the impact of mineralization on these properties is of large interest for the scientific community. This paper presents systematic studies of synthetic collagen microfibers with increasing apatite content and their response to tensile stress by using a novel self-made electromechanical device combined with a Raman spectrometer for molecular level studies. The impact of apatite on the mechanical and molecular response of collagen is evaluated giving important insights into the interaction between the mineral and organic phases.

By maximizing the differences between chemical classes, a subset of 120 tripeptides was extracted and used as scaffolds for generating a combinatorial library of 7912 tetrapeptides. This library was processed in an analogous way to the former. Five tetrapeptides (IHRI, KSDS, LGFD, TGKF and WHVS) were chosen depending on their virtual affinity and cross-reactivity for the experimental step. The five peptides were covalently bound to gold nanoparticles by adding a terminal cysteine to each tetrapeptide and deposited onto 20MHz quartz crystal microbalances to construct the gas sensors. The behavior of peptides after this chemical modification was simulated at the pH range used in the immobilization step. \u0394F signals analyzed by principal component analysis matched the virtually screened data. The array was able to clearly discriminate the 13 volatile compounds tested based on their hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity molecules as well as the molecular weight.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2016-09-26", "authors": ["MarcelloMascini", "DanielPizzoni", "GermanPerez", "EmilioChiarappa", "CorradoDi Natale", "PaolaPittia", "DarioCompagnone"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2016.09.028"}

Moreover, these SQS configurations are slightly larger in size than those available in the literature for x\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20091/2, mostly because of the current capabilities of atomistic techniques.

Phys. Lett. 90 093503, Cowburn and Welland 2000 Science 287 1466-68). One implementation of nanomagnetic logic employs shape-anisotropic (e.g. elliptical) ferromagnets (with two stable magnetization orientations) as binary switches that rely on dipole-dipole interaction to communicate binary information (Cowburn and Welland 2000 Science 287 1466-8, Csaba et al 2002 IEEE Trans.

However, circular magnetoelastic nanomagnets can be made bi-stable with a voltage induced anisotropic strain, which provides two significant advantages for nanomagnetic logic applications. First, the shape-anisotropy energy barrier is eliminated which reduces the amount of energy required to reorient the magnetization. Second, the in-plane size can be reduced (\u223c20 nm) which was previously not possible due to thermal stability issues. In circular magnetoelastic nanomagnets, a voltage induced strain stabilizes the magnetization even at this size overcoming the thermal stability issue. In this paper, we analytically demonstrate the feasibility of a binary 'logic wire' implemented with an array of circular nanomagnets that are clocked with voltage-induced strain applied by an underlying piezoelectric substrate. This leads to an energy-efficient logic paradigm orders of magnitude superior to existing CMOS-based logic that is scalable to dimensions substantially smaller than those for existing nanomagnetic logic approaches.

Here, we comprehensively show that transferred high performance transparent electrodes with Au-coated nanowire (NW) electrodes can be obtained using a facile and scalable combined fabrication route of both electrospinning and sputtering processes. Au-coated MNFs of a.c. 110 nm thick can significantly reduce junction resistance, which results in high transmittance (90%) at low sheet resistance (175 \u03a9 sq(-1)). The Au-coated MNFs electrodes also show great flexibility and stretchability, which easily surpass the brittleness of indium tin oxide (ITO) films. Further improvement in ATPH performance was realized by rolling the device into a cylindrical shape, resulting in an increase in power output due to the cooperatively enhanced effect. The rolled ATPH with 0.34 cm diameter produces a high output voltage of \u223c4.1 V, current \u223c295 nA at a strain of 0.5% and 5 hz.

We show that for such low-frequency dithering experiments, recorded phase information can be unambiguously interpreted within the framework of a transparent theoretical model that starts from a well-known partial differential equation to describe the dithering of an atomic force microscope cantilever and a single molecule attached to its end system, uses an appropriate set of initial and boundary conditions, and does not exploit any implicit suggestions. We conclude that the observed phase (dissipation) signal is due completely to the dissipation related to the dithering of the cantilever itself (i.e., to the change of boundary conditions in the course of stretching). For both cases, only the upper bound of the dissipation of a single molecule has been established as not exceeding 3\u22c510(-7)kg/s. We compare our results with previously reported measurements of the viscoelastic properties of single molecules, and we emphasize that extreme caution must be taken in distinguishing between the dissipation related to the stretched molecule and the dissipation that originates from the viscous damping of the dithered cantilever. We also present the results of an amplitude channel data analysis, which reveal that the typical values of the spring constant of a I27 molecule at the moment of module unfolding are equal to 4\u00b11.5mN/m, and the typical values of the spring constant of dextran at the moment of chair-boat transition are equal to 30-50mN/m.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2016-09-23", "authors": ["FabrizioBenedetti", "YuliaGazizova", "Andrzej JKulik", "Piotr EMarszalek", "Dmitry VKlinov", "GiovanniDietler", "Sergey KSekatskii"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2016.08.018"}
{"title": "Giant electromechanical coupling of relaxor ferroelectrics controlled by polar nanoregion vibrations.", "abstract": "Relaxor-based ferroelectrics are prized for their giant electromechanical coupling and have revolutionized sensor and ultrasound applications. A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions. By using neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local structure, we show that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the underlying macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric PMN-xPT {(1 - x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] - xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening. Furthermore, a PNR mode and a component of the local structure align in an electric field; this further enhances shear softening, revealing a way to tune the ultrahigh piezoelectric response by engineering elastic shear softening.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2016-09-22", "authors": ["Michael EManley", "Douglas LAbernathy", "RaffiSahul", "Daniel EParshall", "Jeffrey WLynn", "Andrew DChristianson", "Paul JStonaha", "Eliot DSpecht", "John DBudai"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1501814"}

Several challenges however preclude the integration of organic chemistry with conventional nanomanufacturing approaches, namely most nanolithography platforms would denature or destroy delicate organic and biologically active matter, confirming covalent bond formation at interfaces remains difficult, and finally, only a small handful of the reactions used to transform molecules in solution have been validated on surfaces. Thus, entirely new approaches, where organic transformations and spatial control are considered equally important contributors, are needed to create 4D organic nanoprinting platforms. This Account describes efforts from our group to reconcile nanolithography, and specifically massively parallel scanning probe lithography (SPL), with organic chemistry to further the goal of 4D organic nanoprinting. Massively parallel SPL involves arrays of elastomeric pyramids mounted onto piezoelectric actuators, and creates patterns with feature diameters below 50 nm by using the pyramidal tips for either the direct deposition of ink or the localized delivery of energy to a surface. While other groups have focused on tip and array architetctures, our efforts have been on exploring their use for localizing organic chemistry on surfaces with nanoscale spatial resolution in 3D. Herein we describe the use of massively parallel SPL to create covalently immobilized patterns of organic materials using thermal, catalytic, photochemical, and force-accelerated reactions. In doing so, we have developed a high-throughput protocol for confirming interfacial bond formation. These efforts have resulted in new opportunities for the preparation of glycan arrays, novel approaches for covalently patterning graphene, and a 3D nanoprinter by combining photochemical brush polymerizations with SPL. Achieving true 4D nanoprinting involves advances in surface chemistry and instrumentation development, and to this end 4D micropatterns were produced in a microfluidic photoreactor that can position polymers composed of different monomers within micrometer proximity. A substantial gap remains, however, between these current technologies and the future's 4D nanomanufacturing tools, but the marriage of SPL with organic chemistry is an important step toward this goal. As this field continues to mature we can expect bottom-up 4D nanomanufacturing to begin supplanting conventional top-down strategies for preparing electronics, bioarrays, and functional substrates. In addition, these new printing technologies may enable the preparation of synthetic targets, such as artificial biological interfaces, with a level of organic sophistication that is entirely unachievable using existing technologies.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2016-09-20", "authors": ["CarlosCarbonell", "Adam BBraunschweig"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00307"}

However, this method has reached its technological limit, and there have been no significant breakthrough over the last decade. Here we show, using polyvinylidene fluoride as a sample polymer, a new concept of membrane manufacturing by combining oriented green solvent crystallization and polymer migration is able to obtain high performance membranes with pure water permeation flux substantially higher than those with similar pore size prepared by conventional phase-separation processes. The new manufacturing procedure is governed by fewer operating parameters and is, thus, easier to control with reproducible results. Apart from the high water permeation flux, the prepared membranes also show excellent stable flux after fouling and superior mechanical properties of high pressure load and better abrasion resistance.

The study was designed as a prospective, double-blind, randomized, and controlled study. Setting is a tertiary referral hospital in Turkey. Ninety patients who underwent primary open rhinoplasty with osteotomy, performed by either the conventional instruments or the piezoelectric device. The complete subperiosteal degloving of the entire nasal bone was done up to the nasal maxillary sulcus, medial canthus, and nasion in all patients, independent of the type of osteotomy device used. Patients subsequently underwent median-oblique and lateral osteotomy, either with an ultrasonic device or a conventional 2-mm guarded, straight osteotome. The postoperative edema and ecchymosis were evaluated by another surgeon who was blinded to the osteotomy procedure on postoperative days 2 and 7. The edema scores were significantly increased on the second day compared with the seventh day in both groups 1 and 2. However, there was no significant difference between groups. The ecchymosis scores were slightly higher in postoperative day 2, compared with day 7, in both groups 1 and 2, but statistically not significant.

Twenty-seven articles met the selection criteria and were subjected to meta-analysis of bone gain and survival rate; 17 reported the use of conventional surgical instruments and nine the use of surgical ultrasound. A total of 4115 implants were installed in 1732 patients (average patient age 52 years). The overall implant survival rate was 97%. The average bone gain in studies that used conventional surgical instruments was 3.61mm, while this was 3.69mm in those that used ultrasound. Only two studies presented a low risk of bias. The greatest problems identified during the qualitative analysis were related to random selection of the population and the absence of statistical analysis.

This process introduced an external magnetic field and the influences of external magnetic field on dielectric properties of composites were investigated systematically. The composites subjected to magnetic field treatment for 30\u2009min at 60\u2009\u00b0C exhibited the largest dielectric permittivity (385 at 100\u2009Hz) when the BT-Fe3O4 concentration is approximately 33\u2009vol.%. The BT-Fe3O4 suppressed the formation of a conducting path in the composite and induced low dielectric loss (0.3) and low conductivity (4.12\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-9)\u2009S/cm) in the composite. Series-parallel model suggested that the enhanced dielectric permittivity of BT-Fe3O4/PVDF composites should arise from the ultrahigh permittivity of BT-Fe3O4 hybrid particles. However, the experimental results of the BT-Fe3O4/PVDF composites treated by magnetic field agree with percolation theory, which indicates that the enhanced dielectric properties of the BT-Fe3O4/PVDF composites originate from the interfacial polarization induced by the external magnetic field.

We find that the EB at the T-O phase boundary is lower than that at the O-R phase boundary and EB may serve as a rigorous quantitative measure of the degree of polarization anisotropy through Landau potential.

Four implant configurations for a three-unit FPD depending on the number and position of the implants were considered in this study. They included a three-implant prosthesis and three types of two-implant prosthesis: a central pontic, posterior cantilever, and anterior cantilever, with the same superstructure (splinted three crowns) for the same occlusal contact. Customized abutments and 3D piezoelectric force transducers were fixed to the implants of the four configurations with the superstructure. The loads on the implants were recorded during maximum voluntary clenching (MVC-test) and when chewing a piece of chewing gum (GUMtest).\nThe occlusal forces on the dental arch during MVC-test with the four implant configurations did not exhibit significant differences. In the three-implant prosthesis, there were no significant differences in the mean maximum resultant load on each implant in both tests. In the central pontic, the load on the second premolar was significantly greater than that on the second molar in the MVC-test but there were no significant differences in the GUM-test. High loads were detected on the first molar in both the posterior cantilever and anterior cantilever. The highest load was detected on the first molar in the posterior cantilever during the GUMtest.\nThe in vivo 3D load-measuring device using the piezoelectric force transducers enabled the measurement of the functional load on implants supporting a FPD.

We examine the effect of mechanically stabilizing a piezo-driven mechanical amplifier inserted into the incudostapedial joint gap. The aim of this study is to determine whether this is possible and discern the advantages and disadvantages of the design.\nWe examine a 10:1 scale model of a prospective implantable hearing aid comprising one piezoelectric sensor and two independent piezoelectric actuators in a single-titanium housing. As expected, the maximum gain of the device is limited by feedback between sensor input and the output of the primary actuator. The secondary actuator is used to provide a counter force to the recoil of the primary output piezo. This adds a virtual mass to the device, effectively reducing feedback in the mechano-acoustic path.

The configurational effects of fixed partial dentures (FPDs) were explored using a multi-stage remodeling rule. Three-dimensional real-time occlusal loads during maximum voluntary clenching were measured with a piezoelectric force transducer and were incorporated into a computerized tomography-based finite element mandibular model. Virtual X-ray images were generated based on simulation and statistically correlated with clinical data using linear regressions. The strain energy density-driven remodeling parameters were regulated over the time frame considered. A linear single-stage bone remodeling algorithm, with a single set of constant remodeling parameters, was found to poorly fit with clinical data through linear regression (low [Formula: see text] and R), whereas a time-dependent multi-stage algorithm better simulated the remodeling process (high [Formula: see text] and R) against the clinical results. The three-implant-supported and distally cantilevered FPDs presented noticeable and continuous bone apposition, mainly adjacent to the cervical and apical regions. The bridged and mesially cantilevered FPDs showed bone resorption or no visible bone formation in some areas. Time-dependent variation of bone remodeling parameters is recommended to better correlate remodeling simulation with clinical follow-up.

Since PCM's are miniaturized sensor, they are very suitable for planetary in situ missions, where can be used to detect and to measure the mass amount of astrobiologically significant compounds, such as water and organics. This work focuses on the realization and testing of a new experimental setup, able to characterize volatiles which can be found in a planetary environment. In particular the enthalpy of sublimation of some dicarboxylic acids has been measured. The importance of dicarboxylic acids in planetology and astrobiology is due to the fact that they have been detected in carbonaceous chondritic material (e.g. Murchinson), among the most pristine material present in our Solar System. In this work, a sample of acid was heated in an effusion cell up to its sublimation. For a set of temperatures (from 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 75\u00a0\u00b0C), the deposition rate on the PCM surface has been measured. From these measurements, it has been possible to infer the enthalpy of sublimation of Adipic acid, i.e. \u0394H\u00a0=\u00a0141.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0kJ/mol and Succinic acid, i.e. \u0394H\u00a0=\u00a0113.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0kJ/mol.

The relationship between the input deflection and the output voltage of the monitoring system is calibrated by testing. Monitored workpiece deflection results show that the workpiece experiences obvious vibration during the cutter entering the workpiece stage, and vibration during the machining process can be easily tracked by monitoring the deflection of the workpiece. During the cutter exiting the workpiece stage, the workpiece experiences forced vibration firstly, and free vibration exists until the amplitude reduces to zero after the cutter exits the workpiece.

An artificial ciliary bundle is achieved by fabricating bundled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-pillars with graded heights and electrospinning polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric nanofiber tip links. The piezoelectric nature of a single nanofiber tip link is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

{"title": "Pattern recognition with \"materials that compute\".", "abstract": "Driven by advances in materials and computer science, researchers are attempting to design systems where the computer and material are one and the same entity. Using theoretical and computational modeling, we design a hybrid material system that can autonomously transduce chemical, mechanical, and electrical energy to perform a computational task in a self-organized manner, without the need for external electrical power sources. Each unit in this system integrates a self-oscillating gel, which undergoes the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, with an overlaying piezoelectric (PZ) cantilever. The chemomechanical oscillations of the BZ gels deflect the PZ layer, which consequently generates a voltage across the material. When these BZ-PZ units are connected in series by electrical wires, the oscillations of these units become synchronized across the network, where the mode of synchronization depends on the polarity of the PZ. We show that the network of coupled, synchronizing BZ-PZ oscillators can perform pattern recognition. The \"stored\" patterns are set of polarities of the individual BZ-PZ units, and the \"input\" patterns are coded through the initial phase of the oscillations imposed on these units. The results of the modeling show that the input pattern closest to the stored pattern exhibits the fastest convergence time to stable synchronization behavior. In this way, networks of coupled BZ-PZ oscillators achieve pattern recognition. Further, we show that the convergence time to stable synchronization provides a robust measure of the degree of match between the input and stored patterns. Through these studies, we establish experimentally realizable design rules for creating \"materials that compute.\"", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2016-09-13", "authors": ["YanFang", "Victor VYashin", "Steven PLevitan", "Anna CBalazs"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1601114"}

Processes like the transition from static to dynamic friction are fast and complex, especially as the contacting interface is buried.

The reciprocating optical in situ tribometer introduced here observes the interface of two contacting materials (one of them being optical transparent) with a high-speed camera, taking up to 230\u2009000 frames per second. The camera is attached to an optical microscope with a magnification of up to 2500 times. Friction forces are measured by an analog laser detection setup, with a maximum sampling rate of 500 kHz. The sliding motion of the materials is realized by two displacement units. A linear positioning stage allows velocities between 500 nm/s and 100 mm/s for a maximum distance of 200 mm. For smaller velocities, and to exclude breakaway torque, a piezo actuator can be used. The maximum displacement distance of the piezo actuator is 120 \u03bcm. The smallest applicable normal load on the samples is 0.5 N which is applied by the dead weights. Tribological experiments to investigate the transition from static to dynamic friction have been performed with morphologically textured brass hemispheres in contact with the sapphire discs.

Compared to electromagnetic tilt-positioning mechanisms, piezoelectric tilters are superior with regard to high positioning resolution, cost-effectiveness, and no electromagnetic interference issues. But their applications are limited by small motion ranges. To overcome this problem, a novel piezoelectric tilt-positioning mechanism is proposed and developed in this paper, aiming to achieve a large output range in compact size. Serving this purpose, flextensional piezoelectric actuators (FPAs) are employed in this mechanism and their optimal structure is pursued. The existing approach to model and analyze the structure of FPAs is not perfect, making it challenging to exactly characterize and optimize actuator performance for its applications. To address this problem, a hybrid-body model of the FPAs is developed and based on this model, a governing equation is established to exactly and comprehensively characterize their kinematic performance. This equation allows the application requirement to be readily related to the actuator design, enabling the optimization of tilter design and the actuators. Using the optimized parameters, an experimental prototype is fabricated.

{"title": "Robust atomic force microscopy using multiple sensors.", "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy typically relies on high-resolution high-bandwidth cantilever deflection measurements based control for imaging and estimating sample topography and properties. More precisely, in amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM), the control effort that regulates deflection amplitude is used as an estimate of sample topography; similarly, contact-mode AFM uses regulation of deflection signal to generate sample topography. In this article, a control design scheme based on an additional feedback mechanism that uses vertical z-piezo motion sensor, which augments the deflection based control scheme, is proposed and evaluated. The proposed scheme exploits the fact that the piezo motion sensor, though inferior to the cantilever deflection signal in terms of resolution and bandwidth, provides information on piezo actuator dynamics that is not easily retrievable from the deflection signal. The augmented design results in significant improvements in imaging bandwidth and robustness, especially in AM-AFM, where the complicated underlying nonlinear dynamics inhibits estimating piezo motions from deflection signals. In AM-AFM experiments, the two-sensor based design demonstrates a substantial improvement in robustness to modeling uncertainties by practically eliminating the peak in the sensitivity plot without affecting the closed-loop bandwidth when compared to a design that does not use the piezo-position sensor based feedback. The contact-mode imaging results, which use proportional-integral controllers for cantilever-deflection regulation, demonstrate improvements in bandwidth and robustness to modeling uncertainties, respectively, by over 30% and 20%. The piezo-sensor based feedback is developed using H\u221e control framework.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2016-09-03", "authors": ["MayankBaranwal", "Ram SGorugantu", "Srinivasa MSalapaka"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4960714"}
{"title": "Polarization twist in perovskite ferrielectrics.", "abstract": "Because the functions of polar materials are governed primarily by their polarization response to external stimuli, the majority of studies have focused on controlling polar lattice distortions. In some perovskite oxides, polar distortions coexist with nonpolar tilts and rotations of oxygen octahedra. The interplay between nonpolar and polar instabilities appears to play a crucial role, raising the question of how to design materials by exploiting their coupling. Here, we introduce the concept of 'polarization twist', which offers enhanced control over piezoelectric responses in polar materials. Our experimental and theoretical studies provide direct evidence that a ferrielectric perovskite exhibits a large piezoelectric response because of extended polar distortion, accompanied by nonpolar octahedral rotations, as if twisted polarization relaxes under electric fields. The concept underlying the polarization twist opens new possibilities for developing alternative materials in bulk and thin-film forms.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-09-03", "authors": ["YuukiKitanaka", "KiyotakaHirano", "MotohiroOgino", "YujiNoguchi", "MasaruMiyayama", "ChikakoMoriyoshi", "YoshihiroKuroiwa"], "doi": "10.1038/srep32216"}
{"title": "Characterization of space dust using acoustic impact detection.", "abstract": "This paper describes studies leading to the development of an acoustic instrument for measuring properties of micrometeoroids and other dust particles in space. The instrument uses a pair of easily penetrated membranes separated by a known distance. Sensors located on these films detect the transient acoustic signals produced by particle impacts. The arrival times of these signals at the sensor locations are used in a simple multilateration calculation to measure the impact coordinates on each film. Particle direction and speed are found using these impact coordinates and the known membrane separations. This ability to determine particle speed, direction, and time of impact provides the information needed to assign the particle's orbit and identify its likely origin. In many cases additional particle properties can be estimated from the signal amplitudes, including approximate diameter and (for small particles) some indication of composition/morphology. Two versions of this instrument were evaluated in this study. Fiber optic displacement sensors are found advantageous when very thin membranes can be maintained in tension (solar sails, lunar surface). Piezoelectric strain sensors are preferred for thicker films without tension (long duration free flyers).

The rest were cut either by S-8 S (n = 5) or by B6 (n = 5) both applied by permanent pressure. The intraosseous temperature was measured by K-type thermocouple connected to digital thermometer placed in the bone 1 mm away of the cutting line. The heat generated and the time of the complete cutting were recorded. In S-8 S group the temperature never rose above 47\u2070C. Using the B6 with permanent movement the critical temperature was reached in 16.2 \u00b1 3.53% of the cases while taking breaks decreased the results to 2.6 ? 0.96% (p <0.001). In no cases the temperature elevation above 4700 lasted more than 60 sec. Applying the B6 by permanent pressure resulted in heat up to 90.3\u2070C.

In an effort to develop a more realistic gel tissue phantom for MRE, we have constructed a heterogenous gel phantom (a sphere centrally embedded in a cylinder). The actuation comes from the phantom container, with the mechanical waves propagating toward the center, focusing the energy and thus allowing for the visualization of high-frequency waves that would otherwise be damped. The phantom was imaged and its stiffness determined using a 9.4 T horizontal MRI with a custom build piezo-elastic MRE actuator. The phantom was vibrated at three frequencies, 250, 500, and 750 Hz. The resulting shear wave images were first used to reconstruct material stiffness maps for thin (1\u2009mm) axial slices at each frequency, from which the complex shear moduli \u03bc were estimated, and then compared with forward modeling using a recently developed theoretical model which took \u03bc as inputs.

{"title": "Effect of polyvinylidene fluoride electrospun fiber orientation on neural stem cell differentiation.", "abstract": "Electrospun polymer piezoelectric fibers can be used in neural tissue engineering (NTE) to mimic the physical, biological, and material properties of the native extracellular matrix. In this work, we have developed scaffolds based on polymer fiber architectures for application in NTE. To study the role of such three-dimensional scaffolds, a rotating drum collector was used for electrospinning poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) polymer at various rotation speeds. The morphology, orientation, polymorphism, as well as the mechanical behavior of the nonaligned and aligned fiber-based architectures were characterized. We have demonstrated that the jet flow and the electrostatic forces generated by electrospinning of PVDF induced local conformation changes which promote the generation of the \u03b2-phase. Fiber anisotropy could be a critical feature for the design of suitable scaffolds for NTEs. We thus assessed the impact of PVDF fiber alignment on the behavior of monkey neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs were seeded on nonaligned and aligned scaffolds and their morphology, adhesion, and differentiation capacities into the neuronal and glial pathways were studied using microscopic techniques. Significant changes in the growth and differentiation capacities of NSCs into neuronal and glial cells as a function of the fiber alignment were evidenced. These results demonstrate that PVDF scaffolds may serve as instructive scaffolds for NSC survival and differentiation, and may be valuable tools for the development of cell- and scaffold-based strategies for neural repair. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, restraining the dissipation of the electric charges in service to ensure the stabilized electrostatic force of the fibers for effectively adsorbing particles is extremely important and also challenging. Herein, we report novel electret nanofibrous membranes with numerous charges and desirable charge stability using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the matrix polymer and polytetrafluoroethylene nanoparticles (PTFE NPs) as an inspiring charge enhancer through the in situ charging technology of electrospinning. Benefiting from the employment of PTFE NPs and optimized injection energy, the fibrous membranes are endowed with elevated surface potentials from 0.42 to 3.63 kV and reduced decrement of charges from 75.4 to 17.5%, which contribute to the ameliorative stability of filtration efficiency. Significantly, an electret mechanism is proposed, while deepened depth of the energy level and incremental polarized dipole charges with increasing PTFE NP concentrations and injection energy have been confirmed through the measurement of open-circuit thermally stimulated discharge and surface potential decay. Ultimately, the resultant fibrous membrane exhibited a high filtration efficiency of 99.972%, a low pressure drop of 57 Pa, a satisfactory quality factor of 0.14 Pa(-1), and superior long-term service performance.

We have demonstrated a novel approach to greatly improve piezoelectric power generation by electrodepositing a high-quality p-type Cu2O layer between the piezoelectric semiconducting film and the metal electrode. The p-n heterojunction using only oxides suppresses the screening effect by forming an intrinsic depletion region, and thus sufficiently enhances the piezoelectric potential, compared to the pristine ZnO piezoelectric NG.

The passive sensory organs of aquatic animals have provided inspiration to biomimetic researchers for developing underwater passive sensing systems for AUVs. This work is inspired by the 'integumentary sensory organs' (ISOs) which are dispersed on the skin of crocodiles and are equipped with slowly adapting (SA) and rapidly adapting (RA) receptors. ISOs assist crocodiles in locating the origin of a disturbance, both on the water surface and under water, thereby enabling them to hunt prey even in a dark environment and turbid waters. In this study, we construct SA dome receptors embedded with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) piezoresistive sensors to measure the steady-state pressures imparted by flows and RA dome receptors embedded with MEMS piezoelectric sensors to detect oscillatory pressures in water. Experimental results manifest the ability of SA and RA dome receptors to sense the direction of steady-state flows and oscillatory disturbances, respectively. As a proof of concept, the SA domes are tested on the hull of a kayak under various pressure variations owing to different types of movements of the hull.

{"title": "Reconciling Local Structure Disorder and the Relaxor State in (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3-BaTiO3.", "abstract": "Lead-based relaxor ferroelectrics are key functional materials indispensable for the production of multilayer ceramic capacitors and piezoelectric transducers. Currently there are strong efforts to develop novel environmentally benign lead-free relaxor materials. The structural origins of the relaxor state and the role of composition modifications in these lead-free materials are still not well understood. In the present contribution, the solid-solution (100-x)(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3-xBaTiO3 (BNT-xBT), a prototypic lead-free relaxor is studied by the combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, dielectric measurements and ab-initio density functional theory (DFT). For the first time it is shown that the peculiar composition dependence of the EFG distribution width (\u0394QISwidth) correlates strongly to the dispersion in dielectric permittivity, a fingerprint of the relaxor state. Significant disorder is found in the local structure of BNT-xBT, as indicated by the analysis of the electric field gradient (EFG) in (23)Na 3QMAS NMR spectra. Aided by DFT calculations, this disorder is attributed to a continuous unimodal distribution of octahedral tilting. These results contrast strongly to the previously proposed coexistence of two octahedral tilt systems in BNT-xBT. Based on these results, we propose that considerable octahedral tilt disorder may be a general feature of these oxides and essential for their relaxor properties.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-08-23", "authors": ["Pedro BGroszewicz", "MelanieGr\u00f6ting", "HergenBreitzke", "WookJo", "KarstenAlbe", "GerdBuntkowsky", "J\u00fcrgenR\u00f6del"], "doi": "10.1038/srep31739"}

However, a lithography-based method for developing contacts to individual crystal facets with submicrometer size has not yet been demonstrated. In this report we study the use of electron beam-induced deposition (EBID), a direct write lithography method, for contacting individual facets of ZnO pillars within an electron microscope. Correlating structural and in situ deposition and electrical data, we examine proximity effects during the EBID and evaluate the process against obtaining electrically insulated contact lines on neighboring and diametrically opposite ZnO facets. Parameters such as incident beam energy geometry and size of the facets were investigated with the view of minimizing unwanted proximity broadening effects. Additionally, we show that the EBID direct write method has the required flexibility, resolution, and minimized proximity deposition for creating prototype devices.

Observation of anomalous changes both in dielectric constant and dielectric loss in the pressure range 3.7-4.4\u2009GPa and reversal of piezoelectric current with reversal of poling field direction indicate to a change in ferroelectric order in CuO at high pressures. A sudden jump in Raman integrated intensity of Ag mode at 3.4\u2009GPa and observation of Curie-Weiss type behaviour in dielectric constant below 3.7\u2009GPa lends credibility to above ferroelectric transition. A slope change in the linear behaviour of the Ag mode and a minimum in the FWHM of the same indicate indirectly to a change in magnetic ordering. Since all the previous studies show a strong spin-lattice interaction in CuO, observed change in ferroic behaviour at high pressures can be related to a reentrant multiferroic ordering in the range 3.4 to 4.4\u2009GPa, much earlier than predicted by theoretical studies.

Composition-driven phase transition characteristics and the resulting associated piezoelectric and electromechanical properties were systematically investigated, and schematic phase diagrams were constructed. XRD measurements, Raman spectra analysis and temperature-dependent polarization and strain hysteresis loops indicate that Bi(Me0.5Ti0.5)O3 substitution induces a phase transformation from a ferroelectric rhombohedral to an ergodic relaxor pseudo-cubic phase, accounting for the large strain response (>0.3%) with a high normalized strain Smax/Emax (\u2265550 pm V(-1)) at around the corresponding critical composition in the vicinity of room temperature. In addition, correlations between the tolerance factor t of the added end-member, the calculated tetragonality and the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) composition were sought. In comparison to other reported BNT-based systems, there is a noticeable correlation between the MPB composition and the calculated tetragonality of the end-member Bi(Me0.5Ti0.5)O3, and the t value corresponding to the formation of the MPB composition is approximately 0.981 in the present ternary system with low tolerance factor end-members.

These are shown using downstream inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analytics, to increase as loading becomes lower. This dichotomy between activity and stability has direct implications for the development of improved catalyst materials, as well as for the achievement of current targets for reduced loadings of noble metals for fuel cells and other energy storage devices.", "journal": "ChemElectroChem", "date": "2016-08-16", "authors": ["Gareth PKeeley", "SerhiyCherevko", "Karl J JMayrhofer"], "doi": "10.1002/celc.201500425"}

The energy method is used to model the dynamics of the two piezoelectric vibrators. The interface forces are coupled into the dynamic equations of the two vibrators and the moving platform, forming a whole machine model of the motor. The behavior of the force transmission of the motor is analyzed via the resulting model to understand the drive mechanism. In particular, the relative contact length is proposed to describe the intermittent contact characteristic between the stator and the mover, and its role in evaluating motor performance is discussed. The relations between the output speed and various inputs to the motor and the start-stop transients of the motor are analyzed by numerical simulations, which are validated by experiments. Furthermore, the dead-zone behavior is predicted and clarified analytically using the proposed model, which is also observed in experiments.

{"title": "Partial Discharge Monitoring in Power Transformers Using Low-Cost Piezoelectric Sensors.", "abstract": "Power transformers are crucial in an electric power system. Failures in transformers can affect the quality and cause interruptions in the power supply. Partial discharges are a phenomenon that can cause failures in the transformers if not properly monitored. Typically, the monitoring requires high-cost corrective maintenance or even interruptions of the power system. Therefore, the development of online non-invasive monitoring systems to detect partial discharges in power transformers has great relevance since it can reduce significant maintenance costs. Although commercial acoustic emission sensors have been used to monitor partial discharges in power transformers, they still represent a significant cost. In order to overcome this drawback, this paper presents a study of the feasibility of low-cost piezoelectric sensors to identify partial discharges in mineral insulating oil of power transformers. The analysis of the feasibility of the proposed low-cost sensor is performed by its comparison with a commercial acoustic emission sensor commonly used to detect partial discharges. The comparison between the responses in the time and frequency domain of both sensors was carried out and the experimental results indicate that the proposed piezoelectric sensors have great potential in the detection of acoustic waves generated by partial discharges in insulation oil, contributing for the popularization of this noninvasive technique.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-08-16", "authors": ["BrunoCastro", "GuilhermeClerice", "CaioRamos", "Andr\u00e9Andreoli", "FabricioBaptista", "FernandoCampos", "Jos\u00e9Ulson"], "doi": "10.3390/s16081266\n10.3390/s151129434\n10.3390/s140203408\n10.1109/57.63057\n10.1016/j.measurement.2012.09.005\n10.3390/s150407360\n10.1109/TPWRD.2004.833923\n10.1109/57.156943\n10.1109/TDEI.2005.1522184\n10.1109/TDEI.2005.1430390\n10.1109/TDEI.2009.4784570\n10.1007/s10921-015-0299-3\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.11.031\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.09.027\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2256121\n10.3390/s140101208\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2352171\n10.3390/s150509882"}

In particular, biomedical devices that are implanted in the body or brain require small-footprint power receiving elements for wireless charging, which can be accomplished by micromechanical resonators. Moreover, for fundamental experiments, the ultralow-power wireless operation of micromechanical resonators in the microwave range can enable the performance of low-temperature studies of mechanical systems in the quantum regime, where the heat carried by the electrical wires in standard actuation techniques is detrimental to maintaining the resonator in a quantum state.

{"title": "High dielectric permittivity and improved mechanical and thermal properties of poly(vinylidene fluoride) composites with low carbon nanotube content: effect of composite processing on phase behavior and dielectric properties.", "abstract": "The composite processing technique and nanofiller concentration and its functionalization significantly alter the properties of polymer nanocomposites. To realize this, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were dispersed in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix at carefully selected CNT concentrations by two illustrious methods, such as solution-cast and melt-mixing. Notwithstanding the processing method, CNTs induced predominantly the \u03b3-phase in PVDF, instead of the commonly obtained \u03b2-phase upon nanofiller incorporation, and imparted significant improvements in dielectric properties. Acid-treatment of CNT improved its dispersion and interfacial adhesion significantly with PVDF, and induced a higher \u03b3-phase content and better dielectric properties in PVDF as compared to pristine CNT. Further, the \u03b3-phase content was found to be higher in solution-cast composites than that in melt-mixed counterparts, most likely due to solvent-induced crystallization in a controlled environment and slow solvent evaporation in the former case. However, interestingly, the melt-mixed composites showed a significantly higher dielectric constant at the onset of the CNT networked-structure as compared to the solution-cast composites. This suggests the possible role of CNT breakage during melt-mixing, which might lead to higher space-charge polarization at the polymer-CNT interface, and in turn an increased number of pseudo-microcapacitors in these composites than the solution-cast counterparts. Notably, PVDF with 0.13 vol% (volume fraction, f c \u00a0=\u00a00.0013) of acid-treated CNTs, prepared by melt-mixing, displayed the relative permittivity of \u223c217 and capacitance of \u223c5430 pF, loss tangent of \u223c0.4 at 1 kHz and an unprecedented figure of merit of \u223c10(5). We suggest a simple hypothesis for the \u03b3-phase formation and evolution of the high dielectric constant in these composites.

For this, it is desirable to make the F-number as small as possible under the largest possible aperture in order to generate ultrasound energy high enough to induce tissue coagulation in such a small focal volume. However, satisfying both conditions at the same time is demanding. To meet the requirements, this paper, therefore, proposes a double-focusing technique, in which the aperture of an ultrasound transducer is spherically shaped for initial focusing and an acoustic lens is used to finally focus ultrasound on a target depth of treatment; it is possible to achieve the F-number of unity or less while keeping the aperture of a transducer as large as possible. In accordance with the proposed method, we designed and fabricated a 7-MHz double-focused ultrasound transducer. The experimental results demonstrated that the fabricated double-focused transducer had a focal length of 10.2 mm reduced from an initial focal length of 15.2 mm and, thus, the F-number changed from 1.52 to 1.02.

Above a critical input power, the strong substrate vibration displacement can also force the molecules out of the graphene film to form a thin fluid layer, which subsequently destabilizes and breaks up to form a mist of micron dimension aerosol droplets.

A long-wavelength band response is caused by the ZnO absorption and a short-wavelength band response is caused by Mg x Zn1-x O. At a 0 V bias voltage, the photogenerated electrons in ZnO are confined to the Mg x Zn1-x O/ZnO interface, arising from the piezoelectric polarization. The accumulated electrons hop the Mg x Zn1-x O layer through the assistance of defects; however, the photogenerated electrons in Mg x Zn1-x O cannot cross over the large barrier height at the Au/MgZnO interface, resulting in a single-wavelength photodetector with a long-wavelength band (345-400 nm) having a peak wavelength of 370 nm. By increasing the bias voltage to 1-2 V, the barrier height is lowered, enabling the photogenerated electrons in Mg x Zn1-x O to easily cross over the low barrier height, leading to dual-wavelength photodetectors having peak wavelengths of 370 and 340 nm. On further increasing the bias voltage beyond 2 V, the photogenerated electrons in ZnO sink deeply in the hollow at the Mg x Zn1-x O/ZnO interface owing to the large applied voltage. These electrons are effectively confined at the Mg x Zn1-x O/ZnO interface, which retards the tunneling of the photogenerated electrons in ZnO through the Mg x Zn1-x O layer; hence the MSM-PDs revert back to single wavelength photodetectors; however, the detection wavelength is different from that of the MSM-PDs biased at 0 V.

Before surgery and 3 months afterwards, prolapse was assessed using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification scale and functional outcomes were recorded using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for vaginal symptoms and urinary incontinence.\nFifty women were included. At 3 months, 47 (94%) patients reported no bulge symptoms and the mean point C was -7.6. Complications comprised bladder injury in 1 (2%) and minor wound problems in 3 (6%) patients.

Our setup has an option to rotate the sample in the magnetic field and it operates up to the high microwave frequencies of 160GHz. Using our cantilever based FMR spectrometer we have investigated a set of samples, namely quasi-bulk and 84nm film Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 samples, 16nm Fe50Ni50 film and 150nm Sr2FeMoO6 film. Low frequency and room temperature test of our setup using 84nm Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 film yielded a result identical to a standard X-Band spectrometer, namely a single line with quite small linewidth. Our measurements at low temperatures and high frequencies revealed a quite strong FMR response detected in all samples. The FMR spectra share common features, such as the emergence of the second line with an opposite angular dependence, and a drastic increase of the linewidths with increasing microwave frequency. We believe that these findings are results of the complicated dynamics of the magnetization at low temperatures and high frequencies, which we were able to probe using our cantilever based FMR setup.", "journal": "Journal of magnetic resonance (San Diego, Calif. : 1997)", "date": "2016-08-09", "authors": ["AlexeyAlfonsov", "EijiOhmichi", "PavelLeksin", "AhmadOmar", "HailongWang", "SabineWurmehl", "FengyuanYang", "HitoshiOhta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmr.2016.07.011"}
{"title": "Precise Microscale Polymeric Networks through Piezoelectronic Inkjet Printing.", "abstract": "Microsized particles are versatile drug delivery systems with applications as inhalants, implants, and vaccines. An ideal fabrication technique is envisioned to provide particles with controlled size dimensions and is facile, without excessive loss of drug during incorporation, modulated morphologies and release kinetics. In this work, we report on the utilization of a set of polymeric building blocks such as allyl- functionalized polycarbonates, semibranched poly(glycidol allylglycidyl ether)s, and dithiol-PEG cross-linkers to form microsized networks in controlled size dimensions of 18-12 \u03bcm, 12-8 \u03bcm, and 1-2 \u03bcm with modulated morphologies and hydrophilicity based on the ratio of the polycarbonate or polyglycidol building blocks. Piezoelectric ink jet printing allows for the direct printing of these polymeric structures onto substrates, after which the printed droplet is cross-linked via UV light using thiol-ene click reactions. By varying the ratio of the allyl-functionalized building block droplets from being purely prepared either from polycarbonate (PC), polyglycidol (PG) backbones or in a ratio of 70/30 of functionalized polycarbonates and polyglycidols, the droplets can be either printed in DMSO or water. Preliminary studies to control the particle sizes not only through the droplet volume but also by reducing the polymer concentration by 20%, resulted in another set of 70/30 polycarbonate/polyglycidol micron sized networks with an observed corresponding size reduction of 20%. With this, we have developed a facile technique to prepare microsized hydrogel particles with homogeneous and attractive size dimensions that can be directly prepared without using lithography methodologies. The strength of the approach is the set of unique polymeric building blocks that in combination with the new technique allows for a modulation of hydrophilicity and morphologies to form promising drug delivery candidates to carry and release synthetic as well as biological cargo.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2016-08-08", "authors": ["Benjamin RSpears", "Michael AMarin", "Anisse NChaker", "Michael WLampley", "EvaHarth"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00175"}
{"title": "High Piezo-photocatalytic Efficiency of CuS/ZnO Nanowires Using Both Solar and Mechanical Energy for Degrading Organic Dye.", "abstract": "High piezo-photocatalytic efficiency of degrading organic pollutants has been realized from CuS/ZnO nanowires using both solar and mechanical energy. CuS/ZnO heterostructured nanowire arrays are compactly/vertically aligned on stainless steel mesh by a simple two-step wet-chemical method. The mesh-supported nanocomposites can facilitate an efficient light harvesting due to the large surface area and can also be easily removed from the treated solution. Under both solar and ultrasonic irradiation, CuS/ZnO nanowires can rapidly degrade methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution, and the recyclability is investigated. In this process, the ultrasonic assistance can greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity. Such a performance can be attributed to the coupling of the built-in electric field of heterostructures and the piezoelectric field of ZnO nanowires. The built-in electric field of the heterostructure can effectively separate the photogenerated electrons/holes and facilitate the carrier transportation. The CuS component can improve the visible light utilization. The piezoelectric field created by ZnO nanowires can further separate the photogenerated electrons/holes through driving them to migrate along opposite directions.

The US wave reflected from the air/medium interface provides radiation force to the medium surface that launches a transient mechanical wave in the transverse (lateral) direction. The type of mechanical wave is determined by boundary conditions. To prove this concept, a home-made 1\u2009MHz piezo-ceramic transducer with a matching layer to air sends a chirped US signal centered at 1\u2009MHz to a 1.6\u2009mm thick gelatin phantom mimicking soft biological tissue. A phase-sensitive (PhS)-optical coherence tomography system is used to track/image the mechanical wave. The reconstructed transient displacement of the mechanical wave in space and time demonstrates highly efficient generation, thus offering great promise for non-contact, non-invasive characterization of soft media, in general, and for elasticity measurements in delicate soft tissues and organs in bio-medicine, in particular.", "journal": "Applied physics letters", "date": "2016-08-06", "authors": ["\u0141ukaszAmbrozi\u0144ski", "IvanPelivanov", "ShaozhenSong", "Soon JoonYoon", "DavidLi", "LiangGao", "Tueng TShen", "Ruikang KWang", "MatthewO'Donnell"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4959827\n10.1016/S0301-5629(98)00110-0\n10.1121/1.1378344\n10.1063/1.1667613\n10.1364/OL.39.000838\n10.1117/1.JBO.20.2.020501\n10.1063/1.4949469\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.05.015\n10.1143/JJAP.43.2857\n10.1121/1.1710501\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.01.001\n10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1251135\n10.1121/1.3640841\n10.1016/S0041-624X(97)00011-5\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1308697\n10.1117/1.JBO.18.12.121509\n10.1134/S1063771006050125\n10.1063/1.4868463\n10.1117/1.JBO.18.12.121505"}
{"title": "Transducer Development and Characterization for Underwater Acoustic Neutrino Detection Calibration.", "abstract": "A short bipolar pressure pulse with \"pancake\" directivity is produced and propagated when an Ultra-High Energy (UHE) neutrino interacts with a nucleus in water. Nowadays, acoustic sensor networks are being deployed in deep seas to detect this phenomenon as a first step toward building a neutrino telescope. In order to study the feasibility of the method, it is critical to have a calibrator that is able to mimic the neutrino signature. In previous works the possibility of using the acoustic parametric technique for this aim was proven. In this study, the array is operated at a high frequency and, by means of the parametric effect, the emission of the low-frequency acoustic bipolar pulse is generated mimicking the UHE neutrino acoustic pulse.

{"title": "Fluoromicrometry: A Method for Measuring Muscle Length Dynamics with Biplanar Videofluoroscopy.", "abstract": "Accurate measurements of muscle length changes are essential for understanding the biomechanics of musculoskeletal systems, and can provide insights into muscular work, force, and power. Muscle length has typically been measured in vivo using sonomicrometry, a method that measures distances by sending and receiving sound pulses between piezoelectric crystals. Here, we evaluate an alternative method, fluoromicrometry, which measures muscle length changes over time by tracking the three-dimensional positions of implanted, radio-opaque markers via biplanar videofluoroscopy. To determine the accuracy and precision of fluoromicrometry, we simultaneously measured length changes of an isolated muscle, the frog sartorius, in an in vitro setup using both fluoromicrometry and a servomotor. For fluoromicrometry to perfectly match the results of the servomotor, the relationship between the two measurements should be linear, with a slope of 1. Measurements of muscle shortening from fluoromicrometry and the motor were compared across 11 isotonic contractions. The precision of fluoromicrometry was \u00b10.09 mm, measured as the root mean square error of the regression of fluoromicrometry versus servomotor muscle lengths. Fluoromicrometry was also accurate: the mean slope of the fluoromicrometry-servomotor regressions did not differ significantly from the ideal line once off-axis motion was removed. Thus, fluoromicrometry provides a useful alternative for measuring muscle length, especially in studies of live animals, as it permits long-term marker implantation, wireless data collection, and increased spatial sampling. Fluoromicrometry can also be used with X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology to simultaneously measure muscle shortening and skeletal kinematics, providing a potent new tool for biomechanics research.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

{"title": "Conformal BaTiO3 Films with High Piezoelectric Coupling through an Optimized Hydrothermal Synthesis.", "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric films have vast applications due to their dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties that meet the requirements of sensors, nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (NVFeRAM) devices, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). However, the small surface area of these 2D ferroelectric films has limited their ability to achieve higher memory storage density in NVFeRAM devices and more sensitive sensors and transducer. Thus, conformally deposited ferroelectric films have been actively studied for these applications in order to create three-dimensional (3D) structures, which lead to a larger surface area. Most of the current methods developed for the conformal deposition of ferroelectric films, such as metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and plasma-enhanced vapor deposition (PECVD), are limited by high temperatures and unstable and toxic organic precursors. In this paper, an innovative fabrication method for barium titanate (BaTiO3) textured films with 3D architectures is introduced to alleviate these issues. This fabrication method is based on converting conformally grown rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays into BaTiO3 textured films using a simple two-step hydrothermal process which allows for thickness-controlled growth of conformal films on patterned silicon wafers coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Moreover, the processing parameters have been optimized to achieve a high piezoelectric coupling coefficient of 100 pm/V. This high piezoelectric response along with high relative dielectric constant (\u03b5r = 1600) of the conformally grown textured BaTiO3 films demonstrates their potential application in sensors, NVFeRAM, and MEMS.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-08-04", "authors": ["ZhiZhou", "Christopher CBowland", "Brendan APatterson", "Mohammad HMalakooti", "Henry ASodano"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b05700"}

Four different dyes containing methylene blue (MB), crystal violet (CV), acid red 18 (AR18), and acid yellow 36 (AY36) were tested. Two types of hydrophobic membranes made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were used. The membranes were characterized by testing against each dye (foulant-foulant) and the membrane-dye (membrane-foulant) interfacial interactions and their mechanisms were identified. The MD membranes possessed negative charges, which facilitated the treatment of acid and azo dyes of the same charge and showed higher fluxes. In addition, PTFE membrane reduced the wettability with higher hydrophobicity of the membrane surface. The PTFE membrane evidenced especially its resistant to dye absorption, as its strong negative charge and chemical structure caused a flake-like (loose) dye-dye structure to form on the membrane surface rather than in the membrane pores. This also enabled the recovery of flux and membrane properties by water flushing (WF), thereby direct-contact MD with PTFE membrane treating 100\u00a0mg/L of dye mixtures showed stable flux and superior color removal during five days operation.

In this study, the aim was to quantify the acoustic impedance of the avian inner ear in the ostrich, which allows us to determine the effect on columellar vibrations and middle ear power flow in future studies. To determine the inner ear impedance, vibrations of the columella were measured for both the quasi-static and acoustic stimulus frequencies.

At low frequencies, harmonic displacements were imposed on the columella using piezo stimulation and the resulting force response was measured with a force sensor.

The obtained CGPE possessed high ionic conductivity, a large electrochemical stability window, and interfacial stability-all superior to that of the pure gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). In addition, under a highly polarized condition, the CGPE effectively suppressed the growth of Li dendrites due to the improved hardness of the GPE by the addition of inorganic A-LLTO/m-SiO2 particles. Accordingly, the Li-ion polymer and Li-O2 cells employing the CGPE exhibited remarkably improved cyclability compared to cells without CGPE. In particular, the CGPE as a protection layer for the Li metal electrode in a Li-O2 cell was effective in blocking the contamination of the Li electrode by oxygen gas or impurities diffused from the cathode side while suppressing the Li dendrites.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["Hang T TLe", "Duc TungNgo", "Ramchandra SKalubarme", "GuozhongCao", "Choong-NyeonPark", "Chan-JinPark"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b05301"}

We demonstrate the in situ gelation of polymer composite electrolytes using poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanospheres (PVdF NSs). The PVdF NSs were synthesized by high pressure emulsion polymerization using gaseous vinylidene fluoride monomers. Compared to the liquid electrolyte (LE) DSCs without PVdF gelation, the PVdF polymer gel electrolyte (PGE) DSCs displayed higher \u03b7 than the LE DSCs; specifically, the 10 wt % PVdF PGE DSCs display 8.1% of the \u03b7, while the LE DSCs only display 6.5%. We characterized the effect of PVdF PGE on the photovoltaic parameters in detail. We also compared the long-term stability of DSCs containing LE and PVdF PGE. The DSCs with PVdF PGE exhibited high stability compared to the LE DSCs, similar to a conventional PGE system. We believe that this facile in situ gelation approach could be utilized for not only the practical application of polymer gel electrolytes DSCs but also for various energy-storage devices.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["Su-JinHa", "Sang GooLee", "Jong-WookHa", "Jun HyukMoon"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01460"}

Web architecture should affect signal design, and vice versa, such that vibratory signals are transmitted with a minimum of attenuation and degradation. However, the web is the medium through which a spider senses both vibratory signals from courting males and cues produced by captured prey. Moreover, webs function not only in vibration transmission, but also in defense from predators and the elements. These multiple functions may impose conflicting selection pressures on web design. We investigated vibration transmission efficiency and accuracy through two web types with contrasting architectures: sheet webs of Eratigena agrestis (Agelenidae) and tangle webs of Latrodectus hesperus (Theridiidae). We measured vibration transmission efficiencies by playing frequency sweeps through webs with a piezoelectric vibrator and a loudspeaker, recording the resulting web vibrations at several locations on each web using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Transmission efficiencies through both web types were highly variable, with within-web variation greater than among-web variation. There was little difference in transmission efficiencies of longitudinal and transverse vibrations. The inconsistent transmission of specific frequencies through webs suggests that parameters other than frequency are most important in allowing these spiders to distinguish between vibrations of prey and courting males.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

The surface morphologies and domain configurations of the thin films were investigated using atomic force microscopy and piezoelectric force microscopy. Periodical one-dimensional finger-like nanostripes of BFO on the SRO covered STO substrates were observed. With increasing thickness, the BFO ultrathin films develop from the finger-like nanostripes to an atomically flat surface. The formation of the finger-like nanostructures of BFO is related to the atomic step or terrace structure of the substrate. The BFO nanostripes and the atomically flat thin films both show good ferroelectricity. The as-grown domain orientations of the BFO ultrathin films are ascribed to the chemical terminations at the surface of the SRO layer.

This film consisted of randomly oriented PLA nanofibers. Consequently, it had sponge-like structure and was quite soft compared to PLA films prepared by spin coating. The average diameter of the fibers and the density of the film were 730 nm and 20%, respectively. By applying a voltage, the PLA film was subjected to electric-field-induced strain: expansion and compression in the thickness direction. When a voltage of -200 V was applied to the film, its thickness shrank from 13.5 \u00b5m to 10.0 \u00b5m (a 26% reduction). Electric-field-induced strain can occur via two different mechanisms: The first is electrostrictive behavior. That. is, in a highly electric field region, a change of film thickness occurs (compression only) from the electrostatic force between electrodes. The second mechanism is piezoelectric-like behavior that occurs in racemic PLA, wherein a PLA nanofiber is expanded and compressed by applying positive and negative voltage. Such piezoelectric-like behavior was not observed in spin-coated PLA films.", "journal": "Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["TaikiNobeshima", "YuyaIshii", "HeisukeSakai", "SeiUemura", "ManabuYoshida"], "doi": "10.1166/jnn.2016.12296"}
{"title": "Minimizing Corrosion of Outdoor Metalworks Using Dispersed Chemically Stabilized Nanoclays in Polyvinylidene Fluoride Latex Coatings.", "abstract": "Nanoclays are small enough to appear optically transparent, yet they have large surface-to-volume and high aspect ratios that can significantly inhibit water diffusion when incorporated into protective coatings. Clear coatings, which minimally affect the aesthetics of metalworks, are commonly applied to outdoor metalworks, such as sculptures, to prevent and slow corrosion. In recent years, waterborne clear coatings, rather than solvent-based clear coatings, are increasingly used in many applications to reduce the quantity of volatile organic components in the formulation, yet the performance of dry films produced from waterborne colloidal suspensions is generally poorer. In this work, we aim to improve the barrier properties of a highly weatherable waterborne acrylic/polyvinylidene fluoride emulsion by adding a synthetic nanoclay, Laponite, into the formulation. To improve clay-polymer compatibility, the clay was covalently modified using an acetoxy or perfluoroalkyl silane monomer that is reactive with the hydroxyl groups at the edges of the Laponite platelets. Cation exchange on the clay faces using phosphorylcholine was conducted to increase the stability in water and characterized by zeta potential. Resulting changes in barrier properties of the polymer nanocomposite films were characterized by gravimetry, colorimetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Surface ablation after accelerated artificial weathering was monitored by attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy and Raman microspectroscopy, thin film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD) and gloss and thickness measurements. The composite films showed many improved properties: reduced water sensitivity and ultraviolet-induced polymer degradation, which increased the barrier properties and reduced the diffusion constants over both short- and long-term weathering studies compared with films without nanoclays. The diffusion constant measured for the highest performing composite film showed that the performance gap between relevant water- and solvent-borne coatings used to protect outdoor metals was narrowed by half.", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2016-07-26", "authors": ["Natasja ASwartz", "Capri APrice", "Tami LasseterClare"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.6b00091\n10.1016/S0300-9440(00)00117-X\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2013.12.011\n10.1002/adfm.201202030\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2012.04.017\n10.1021/acsami.5b01879\n10.1021/am403445z\n10.1021/am5054477\n10.1021/am302110c\n10.1002/marc.200700212\n10.1021/cm0526361\n10.1021/am400350q\n10.1021/am2008954\n10.1021/am501966n\n10.1039/c0sm00590h\n10.1021/ie102259s\n10.1006/jcis.2001.7646\n10.1039/b415618h\n10.1021/la0349267\n10.1016/j.progsolidstchem.2005.11.040\n10.1021/ma0610515\n10.1016/j.electacta.2005.02.107\n10.1016/0010-938X(94)90197-X\n10.1016/j.electacta.2011.12.015\n10.1179/sic.2004.49.1.53\n10.1021/acsami.5b04060\n10.1016/S0010-938X(03)00014-3\n10.5006/1.3277610\n10.1023/B:JMSC.0000034140.96862.1a\n10.1016/j.corsci.2007.09.008\n10.1016/S0032-3861(99)00877-0\n10.1016/j.electacta.2012.07.094\n10.1007/s10008-009-0902-6\n10.1179/147842210X12710800383648\n10.1016/j.molstruc.2004.10.118\n10.1021/la8015595\n10.1002/pat.762\n10.1016/j.electacta.2009.03.084\n10.1016/j.electacta.2005.12.047\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.08.008\n10.1016/j.electacta.2013.09.064\n10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2008.05.015\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.07.051\n10.1038/pj.2013.53"}

The paper also takes another view of this area by gauging the required mechanisms for trapping wind flow from ambient environment. In this regard, rotational and aeroelastic mechanisms are analyzed for the portable wind energy harvesting devices. The comparison between both mechanisms shows that the aeroelastic mechanism has promising potential in producing an energy harvester in smaller scale although how to maintain the resonator perpendicular to wind flow for collecting the maximum vibration is still a major challenge to overcome for this mechanism. Furthermore, this paper categorizes the previously published portable wind energy harvesters to macro and micro scales in terms of their physical dimensions.

{"title": "Mixed finite-element formulations in piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity.", "abstract": "Flexoelectricity, the linear coupling of strain gradient and electric polarization, is inherently a size-dependent phenomenon. The energy storage function for a flexoelectric material depends not only on polarization and strain, but also strain-gradient. Thus, conventional finite-element methods formulated solely on displacement are inadequate to treat flexoelectric solids since gradients raise the order of the governing differential equations. Here, we introduce a computational framework based on a mixed formulation developed previously by one of the present authors and a colleague. This formulation uses displacement and displacement-gradient as separate variables which are constrained in a 'weighted integral sense' to enforce their known relation. We derive a variational formulation for boundary-value problems for piezo- and/or flexoelectric solids. We validate this computational framework against available exact solutions.

{"title": "Prevention of PVDF ultrafiltration membrane fouling by coating MnO2 nanoparticles with ozonation.", "abstract": "Pre-treatment is normally required to reduce or control the fouling of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes in drinking water treatment process. Current pre-treatment methods, such as coagulation, are only partially effective to prevent long-term fouling. Since biological activities are a major contributor to accumulated fouling, the application of an oxidation/disinfection step can be an effective complement to coagulation. In this study, a novel pre-treatment method has been evaluated at laboratory scale consisting of the addition of low dose ozone into the UF membrane tank after coagulation and the use of a hollow-fibre membrane coated with/without MnO2 nanoparticles over a test period of 70 days. The results showed that there was minimal fouling of the MnO2 coated membrane (0.5\u2009kPa for 70 days), while the uncoated membrane experienced both reversible and irreversible fouling. The difference was attributed to the greatly reduced presence of bacteria and organic matter because of the catalytic decomposition of ozone to hydroxyl radicals and increase of the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. In particular, the MnO2 coated membrane had a much thinner cake layer, with significantly less polysaccharides and proteins, and much less accumulated organic matter within the membrane pores.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-07-21", "authors": ["WenzhengYu", "MatthewBrown", "Nigel J DGraham"], "doi": "10.1038/srep30144\n10.1016/j.watres.2007.10.026\n10.1016/j.watres.2013.03.015\n10.1016/j.watres.2008.03.007\n10.1016/j.watres.2015.06.049\n10.1016/j.procbio.2010.08.003\n10.5942/jawwa.2014.106.0018\n10.1016/j.watres.2013.10.030\n10.1038/Srep06513\n10.1016/S0376-7388(03)00174-1\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.060\n10.1080/01919512.2013.771940\n10.2166/Wst.2011.724\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.02.019\n10.1016/j.watres.2009.02.003\n10.1021/Es500435e\n10.5942/jawwa.2014.106.0080\n10.1016/j.biortech.2010.02.081\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.05.056\n10.1016/j.watres.2004.11.017\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.12.098\n10.1016/j.watres.2014.01.045\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.04.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.09.061\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.01.029\n10.1039/C4ta03199g\n10.1016/memsci.2014.01.029\n10.1039/C4ra07485h\n10.1016/j.memsei.2007.12.075\n10.1016/j.biortech.2013.11.006\n10.1016/j.watres.2012.07.039\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.03.044\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.10.080\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.12.011\n10.1016/S0011-9164(00)00039-4\n10.1016/j.watres.2013.10.047\n10.1021/Es0503938\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.07.034\n10.1016/j.watres.2009.10.023\n10.1016/S0043-1354(00)00130-5\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.11.071\n10.1016/j.watres.2010.08.031\n10.1016/S0011-9164(98)00098-8\n10.1016/0043-1354(81)90054-3\n10.1016/0043-1354(90)90030-A\n10.1016/j.watres.2008.11.024\n10.1016/j.watres.2010.12.023\n10.1016/S1001-0742(08)62311-6\n10.1016/0146-6380(92)90119-I\n10.1021/Es402516b\n10.1021/Es030360x\n10.1021/Es0018825\n10.1016/j.watres.2013.09.009\n10.1016/j.watres.2012.07.034\n10.1016/S0378-7753(98)00100-1\n10.1016/0013-4686(83)85127-5\n10.1021/Es063010u\n10.1021/Es9604018"}

The proton conductivity of each composite membrane was analyzed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The morphological change was confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the composite membrane, the proton conductive component was sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (sPEEK), while the nonconductive component was poly(vinylidenedifluoride) and the amphiphilic polymer as a compatibilizer was urethane acrylate non-ionomer (UAN). UAN as a compatibilizer improved the interfacial stability between sPEEK and PVdF polymers, even though two polymers were apparently immiscible. The homogeneous distribution of sPEEK and PVdF domains in the composite membrane was obtained with the introduction of UAN due to the amphiphilicity. Therefore, it was found that the proton conductivity of the composite membrane increased with the incorporation of UAN as a compatibilizer.", "journal": "Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology", "date": "2016-07-20", "authors": ["Sung-HeeRoh", "Seon-GyunRho", "Sang-ChaiKim", "Ju-YoungKim", "Ho-YoungJung"], "doi": "10.1166/jnn.2016.12019"}

The flat-band voltage is obtained by measuring the applied reverse bias voltage that induces a phase inversion in the ER spectra, which is used to calculate the strength of piezo-electric fields. The piezo-electric field is determined to be 1.36 MV/cm for the LED on silicon substrate and 1.83 MV/cm for the LED on sapphire substrate.

{"title": "Cone Beam Guided Corticotomy Using Piezoelectric Surgery.", "abstract": "This study was designed to compare skeletal and dental angular measurements of orthodontic treatment facilitated by cone beam guided corticotomy to that of conventional orthodontic treatment as well as treatment time.\nTwenty female and male adult orthodontic patients with an age range of 19 to 29 years and suffering from bimaxillary protrusion recommended for first premolars extraction were randomly assigned to one of two groups: The test group was treated with a closed technique of corticotomy -facilitated orthodontics using a piezoelectric device and guided by cone beam radiography. The control group was treated with conventional orthodontic treatment. A fixed orthodontic appliance was used and anchorage was done using miniscrews. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed for each patient of the test group. Image analysis was done using On Demand Software where linear and angular measurements were taken to virtually assess the configuration of the six anterior teeth together with the position of the lingual and mental foramen. These measurements were transferred to the study model and a surgical guide was constructed. Corticotomy was performed using the piezotome with the aid of the constructed guide. Orthodontic measurements were recorded pre- and post-treatment including total treatment time for both groups.\nUsing a surgical guide, the surgery was a straightforward procedure. At the end of treatment, by comparing the mean change of skeletal angular measurements between the two groups, the control group showed a significant decrease in the mean of change in the facial angle compared to the test group (p \u2264 0.05). By comparing the mean change of dental angular measurements between the two groups, the test group showed a significant decrease in SN - U1\u00b0 (angle between the sella-nasion line and the maxillary incisor), and a significant increase in the interincisal angle compared to the control group (p \u2264 0.05). Regarding the total treatment time, the test group showed a significant decrease in the mean total treatment time compared to the control group.\nCBCT provided comprehensive information regarding anatomical relationships and individual patient findings for improved diagnosis and treatment planning. The use of a surgical template guided by the cone beam imaging provided a novel conservative technique that simplified the surgical procedure.

The findings show that in presence of viscous liquids the propagation parameters of horizontally polarized shear waves (HPSW) in non-piezoelectric plate change and a viscosity depending attenuation occurs.

{"title": "Novel fabrication method of the peritoneal dialysis filter using silk fibroin with urease fixation system.", "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been a great advance in the kidney dialysis system by wearable artificial kidney (WAK) system for end-stage renal disease patients. Uremic solute removal and water regeneration system are the most prerequisite for WAK to work properly. In this study, we designed a filtering membrane system by using immobilized urease silk fibroin filter and evaluated its comparative effectiveness with a PVDF filtering system in peritoneal dialysate regeneration system by urea removal efficacy. We evaluated this membrane's characteristic and performances by conducting SEM-EDX analyze, water-binding abilities and porosity test, removal abilities of urea, cytotoxicity assay and enzyme activity assay. Under the condition for optimization of urease, the percentage removal of urea was about 40% and 60% in 50 mg/dL urea solution by urease immobilized PVDF and silk fibroin scaffolds, respectively. The batch experimental result showed that immobilized filter removed more than 50% of urea in 50 mg/dL urea solution. In addition silk fibroin with urease filter removed 90 percent of urea in the peritoneal dialysate after 24 h filtration. We suggest that silk fibroin with urease fixation filter can be used more effectively for peritoneal dialysate regeneration system, which have hydrophilic property and prolonged enzyme activity. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Even though the PLLA/PDLA/PVDF blends are immiscible, blending with PVDF enhances the crystallization rate and SC formation of PLLA/PDLA components at different temperatures that are higher or lower than the melting temperature of the PVDF component; it also facilitates the HC-to-SC melt reorganization upon heating. The crystallization rate and degree of SC crystallinity (Xc,SC) of PLLA/PDLA components in nonisothermal crystallization increase after immiscible blending with PVDF. At different isothermal crystallization temperatures, the crystallization half-time of PLLA/PDLA components decreases; its spherulitic growth rate and Xc,SC increase as the mass fraction of PVDF increases from 0 to 0.5 in the presence of either a solidified or a molten PVDF phase. The HCs formed in primary crystallization of PLLA/PDLA components melt and recrystallize into SCs upon heating; the HC-to-SC melt reorganization is promoted after blending with PVDF. We proposed that the PVDF-promoted crystallization, SC formation, and HC-to-SC melt reorganization of PLLA/PDLA components in PLLA/PDLA/PVDF blends stem from the enhanced diffusion ability of PLLA and PDLA chains.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

{"title": "Single-layer MoS2 nanopores as nanopower generators.", "abstract": "Making use of the osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and seawater is an attractive, renewable and clean way to generate power and is known as 'blue energy'. Another electrokinetic phenomenon, called the streaming potential, occurs when an electrolyte is driven through narrow pores either by a pressure gradient or by an osmotic potential resulting from a salt concentration gradient. For this task, membranes made of two-dimensional materials are expected to be the most efficient, because water transport through a membrane scales inversely with membrane thickness. Here we demonstrate the use of single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanopores as osmotic nanopower generators. We observe a large, osmotically induced current produced from a salt gradient with an estimated power density of up to 10(6) watts per square metre--a current that can be attributed mainly to the atomically thin membrane of MoS2. Low power requirements for nanoelectronic and optoelectric devices can be provided by a neighbouring nanogenerator that harvests energy from the local environment--for example, a piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowire array or single-layer MoS2 (ref. 12).

{"title": "A Novel Wearable Device for Food Intake and Physical Activity Recognition.", "abstract": "Presence of speech and motion artifacts has been shown to impact the performance of wearable sensor systems used for automatic detection of food intake. This work presents a novel wearable device which can detect food intake even when the user is physically active and/or talking. The device consists of a piezoelectric strain sensor placed on the temporalis muscle, an accelerometer, and a data acquisition module connected to the temple of eyeglasses. Data from 10 participants was collected while they performed activities including quiet sitting, talking, eating while sitting, eating while walking, and walking. Piezoelectric strain sensor and accelerometer signals were divided into non-overlapping epochs of 3 s; four features were computed for each signal. To differentiate between eating and not eating, as well as between sedentary postures and physical activity, two multiclass classification approaches are presented. The first approach used a single classifier with sensor fusion and the second approach used two-stage classification.

To compare the dual-frequency measurement performance of a DBR fiber laser acoustic sensor with that of a piezoelectric (PZT) ultrasound sensor, two experiments were performed. First, we fixed the driving frequencies of two ultrasound signals at 3 and 5 MHz, and decreased the driving voltage from 15 to 3 V. The outputs of the DBR acoustic sensor show flat-balanced response to dual-frequencies, compared with the PZT acoustic sensor whose response to one of the dual-frequency signals (5 MHz in this paper) has been covered by noise at low acoustic pressure. Then we increased the acoustic pressure by fixing the driving voltage at 20 V, and changed the frequency spacing between the two ultrasound signals. By analyzing the frequency response, sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and noise equivalent pressure of two acoustic sensors under different frequencies, we found that the response of the DBR sensor to wideband dual-frequency is stable, while the response of the PZT sensor deteriorates sharply with increasing frequency spacing.

Experimental results showed that piezoelectric coefficients measured by the force-induced charges method initially fluctuated in a small range and then was unstable, and they could not be measured at high relative humidity (RH). The traditional shielding method-insulation paste was not quiet convenient, and it even added the weight of piezoelectric dynamometers. In this paper, a novel strategy that eliminates the influence of water adsorption with quartz surfaces on piezoelectric dynamometers was proposed. First, a water-quartz model was developed to analyze the origin of the RH effect. In the model, water vapor, which was adsorbed by the quartz sheet side surface, was considered. Second, equivalent sheet resistor of the side surface was researched, while the relationship of the three R's (Roughness, RH, and Resistor) was respectively discussed based on the adsorption mechanism. Finally, fluorination technology was skillfully adapted to each surface of quartz sheets to shield the water vapor. The experiment verified the fluorination strategy and made piezoelectric dynamometers work in high humidity up to 90%RH successfully. The results showed that the presented model above was reasonable.

{"title": "Reversible Structural Swell-Shrink and Recoverable Optical Properties in Hybrid Inorganic-Organic Perovskite.", "abstract": "Ion migration in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites has been suggested to be an important factor for many unusual behaviors in perovskite-based optoelectronics, such as current-voltage hysteresis, low-frequency giant dielectric response, and the switchable photovoltaic effect. However, the role played by ion migration in the photoelectric conversion process of perovskites is still unclear. In this work, we provide microscale insights into the influence of ion migration on the microstructure, stability, and light-matter interaction in perovskite micro/nanowires by using spatially resolved optical characterization techniques. We observed that ion migration, especially the migration of MA(+) ions, will induce a reversible structural swell-shrink in perovskites and recoverably affect the reflective index, quantum efficiency, light-harvesting, and photoelectric properties. The maximum ion migration quantity in perovskites was as high as approximately 30%, resulting in lattice swell or shrink of approximately 4.4%. Meanwhile, the evidence shows that ion migration in perovskites could gradually accelerate the aging of perovskites because of lattice distortion in the reversible structural swell-shrink process.

In this work, a family of high-k polymer nanocomposites has been fabricated from a facile suspension cast process followed by chemical cross-linking at elevated temperature. Internal double bonds bearing poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-CTFE-DB)) in total amorphous phase are employed as cross-linkable polymer matrix. \u03b1-SiC particles with a diameter of 500 nm are surface modified with 3-aminpropyltriethoxysilane (KH-550) as fillers for their comparable dielectric performance with PVDF polymer matrix, low conductivity, and high breakdown strength. The interface between SiC particles and PVDF matrix has been finely tailored, which leads to the significantly elevated dielectric constant from 10 to over 120 in SiC particles due to the strong induced polarization. As a result, a remarkably improved dielectric constant (ca. 70) has been observed in c-PVDF/m-SiC composites bearing 36 vol % SiC, which could be perfectly predicted by the effective medium approximation (EMA) model. The optimized interface and enhanced compatibility between two components are also responsible for the depressed conductivity and dielectric loss in the resultant composites. Chemical cross-linking constructed in the composites results in promising mechanical flexibility, good heat and chemical stability, and elevated tensile performance of the composites.

Membrane properties including morphology, porosity, hydrophobicity, pore size and pore distribution were investigated, and the permeability was evaluated via direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) of 3.5g/L NaCl solution in a DCMD configuration. Both inorganic and organic micromolecule additives were found to slightly influence membrane hydrophobicity. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), organic acids, LiCl, MgCl2, and LiCl/H2O mixtures were proved to be effective additives to PVDF-CTFE membranes due to their pore-controlling effects and the capacity to improve the properties and performance of the resultant membranes.

However, accurate temperature measurements based on changes in the Stokes peak positions of the GaN epitaxial layers require properly accounting for the stress and/or strain induced by the inverse piezoelectric effect. It is common practice to use the pinched OFF state as the unpowered reference for temperature measurements because the vertical electric field in the GaN buffer that induces inverse piezoelectric stress/strain is relatively independent of the gate bias. Although this approach has yielded temperature measurements that agree with those derived from the Stokes/anti-Stokes ratio and thermal models, there has been significant difficulty in quantifying the mechanical state of the GaN buffer in the pinched OFF state from changes in the Raman spectra. In this paper, we review the experimental technique of micro-Raman thermography and derive expressions for the detailed dependence of the Raman peak positions on strain, stress, and electric field components in wurtzite GaN. We also use a combination of semiconductor device modeling and electro-mechanical modeling to predict the stress and strain induced by the inverse piezoelectric effect. Based on the insights gained from our electro-mechanical model and the best values of material properties in the literature, we analyze changes in the E2 high and A1 (LO) Raman peaks and demonstrate that there are major quantitative discrepancies between measured and modeled values of inverse piezoelectric stress and strain. We examine many of the hypotheses offered in the literature for these discrepancies but conclude that none of them satisfactorily resolves these discrepancies. Further research is needed to determine whether the electric field components could be affecting the phonon frequencies apart from the inverse piezoelectric effect in wurtzite GaN, which has been predicted theoretically in zinc blende gallium arsenide (GaAs).", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2016-07-03", "authors": ["Kevin RBagnall", "Evelyn NWang"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4954203"}

{"title": "Photostriction in Ferroelectrics from Density Functional Theory.", "abstract": "An ab\u00a0initio procedure allowing the computation of the deformation of ferroelectric-based materials under light is presented. This numerical scheme consists in structurally relaxing the system under the constraint of a fixed n_{e} concentration of electrons photoexcited into a specific conduction band edge state from a chosen valence band state, via the use of a constrained density functional theory method. The resulting change in lattice constant along a selected crystallographic direction is then calculated for a reasonable estimate of n_{e}. This method is applied to bulk multiferroic BiFeO_{3} and predicts a photostriction effect of the same order of magnitude than the ones recently observed. A strong dependence of photostrictive response on both the reached conduction state and the crystallographic direction (along which this effect is determined) is also revealed. Furthermore, analysis of the results demonstrates that the photostriction mechanism mostly originates from the screening of the spontaneous polarization by the photoexcited electrons in combination with the inverse piezoelectric effect.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2016-07-02", "authors": ["CharlesPaillard", "BinXu", "BrahimDkhil", "Gr\u00e9goryGeneste", "LBellaiche"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.247401"}

We perform a systematic multi-scale analysis, going from single wire properties to macroscopic device fabrication and characterization, which allows us to establish for GaN NWs the relationship between the material properties and the piezo-generation, and to propose an efficient piezo-generator design. The piezo-conversion of individual MBE-grown p-doped GaN NWs in a dense array is assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) equipped with a Resiscope module yielding an average output voltage of 228 \u00b1 120 mV and a maximum value of 350 mV generated per NW. In the case of p-doped GaN NWs, the piezo-generation is achieved when a positive piezo-potential is created inside the nanostructures, i.e. when the NWs are submitted to compressive deformation. The understanding of the piezo-generation mechanism in our GaN NWs, gained from AFM analyses, is applied to design a piezo-generator operated under compressive strain. The device consists of NW arrays of several square millimeters in size embedded into spin-on glass with a Schottky contact for rectification and collection of piezo-generated carriers. The generator delivers a maximum power density of \u223c12.7 mW cm(-3).

Disorders such as these may be associated with decreased productivity or disability that may last several months resulting in a financial burden to society. Conventional therapies used in general practice to manage pain include rest, ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and subacromial corticosteroid injections. Patients unresponsive to such therapies may need to undergo surgical procedures. Shockwave therapy (SWT) may be an alternative to surgical procedures which can be expensive and associated with risk. Other therapeutic modalities include laser therapy, radiation therapy, and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). SWT involves acoustic waves which carry energy to painful spots and musculoskeletal tissues with subacute, subchronic and chronic conditions. This energy assists in regeneration and repair of bones, tendons and other soft tissues. The exact mechanism of action is not clear. The interaction of shockwaves with tissue is thought to cause analgesia by over stimulation of the treated site resulting in reduced signal transmission to the brainstem, stimulation of tissue healing, breakdown of calcification, alteration of cell membrane permeability, and alteration of cell activity through cavitation. Devices used for SWT vary in design, depending on the way shockwaves are generated and the level of energy that they can produce. SWT includes focused shockwave therapy (FSWT) and radial shockwave therapy (RSWT). FSWT is based on shockwaves of single pressure pulses of a microsecond duration, which are focused on a specific target using ultrasound or radiography guidance. The methods to generate focused shockwaves include electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, or piezoelectric mechanisms. The focused shockwaves are generated in water (inside the applicator) and, as the acoustic impedance of water and biological tissue is comparable, this results in limited reflection and better transmission of the waves into the body. The radial shockwaves for RSWT are generated by acceleration of a projectile, using compressed air, through a tube at the end of which is the applicator. The applicator transmits the generated pressure waves into the body. SWT has been used for over two decades for the treatment soft tissue and bone related musculoskeletal disorders. There is however some debate regarding the effectiveness of SWT compared to placebo or other treatment modalities. A previous CADTH report reviewed the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of shockwave therapy for pain associated with upper extremity orthopedic disorders. It reported that compared with placebo, high energy SWT was effective in reducing pain in calcific but not in non-calcific tendinitis of the shoulder.

Herein, a novel Fe3O4/GO-poly(vinylidene fluoride) (Fe3O4/GO-PVDF) hybrid ultrafiltration membrane was developed via the combination of magnetic field induced casting and a phase inversion technique, during which the Fe3O4/GO nanocomposites could migrate toward the membrane top surface due to magnetic attraction and thereby render the surface highly hydrophilic with robust resistance to fouling. The blended Fe3O4/GO nanocomposites migrated to the membrane surface with the magnetic field induced casting, as verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. As a result, the novel membranes exhibited significantly improved hydrophilicity (with a contact angle of 55.0\u00b0) and water flux (up to 595.39 L m(-2) h(-1)), which were improved by 26% and 206%, 12% and 49%, 25% and 154%, and 11% and 33% compared with those of pristine PVDF membranes and PVDF hybrid membranes blended with GO, Fe3O4, and Fe3O4/GO without the assistance of magnetic field during membrane casting, respectively.

{"title": "Controlling the Physical Dimensions of Peptide Nanotubes by Supramolecular Polymer Coassembly.", "abstract": "Molecular self-assembly of peptides into ordered nanotubes is highly important for various technological applications. Very short peptide building blocks, as short as dipeptides, can form assemblies with unique mechanical, optical, piezoelectric, and semiconductive properties. Yet, the control over nanotube length in solution has remained challenging, due to the inherent sequential self-assembly mechanism. Here, in line with polymer chemistry paradigms, we applied a supramolecular polymer coassembly methodology to modulate peptide nanotube elongation. Utilizing this approach, we achieved a narrow, controllable nanotube length distribution by adjusting the molecular ratio of the diphenylalanine assembly unit and its end-capped analogue. Kinetic analysis suggested a slower coassembly organization process as compared to the self-assembly dynamics of each of the building blocks separately.

Expansion was performed using piezoelectric corticotomy, and self-threading expanders. The control group (CG) comprised patients who received two-implant at canine areas without ridge expansion but were all case matched to SG and served as historical cohort. In both groups, mandibular overdentures were connected to the implants with Locator attachments 3 months after implant placement. Clinical (Plaque index; PI, Gingival index; GI, Probing depth; PD, and implant stability; ISQ) and radiographic (Vertical bone loss; VBL) parameters were recorded at time of overdenture insertion (base line, T0), 6 months (T6), and 12 months (T12) after insertion.\nThe cumulative success rates were 100% and 96.4% for CG and SG, respectively, without significant difference between groups. All tested parameters increased significantly with advance of time in both groups. There was no significant difference in PI, GI, PD, and ISQ between groups. However, SG recorded significant higher VBL than CG at T6 and T12.\nExpansion of mandibular knife edge ridge and simultaneous placement of implants to retain overdentures is associated with clinic and radiographic outcomes comparable to implants placed in unexpanded ridges after 1 year.

{"title": "Imaging of surface nanobubbles by atomic force microscopy in liquids: Influence of drive frequency on the characterization of ultrasoft matter.", "abstract": "Imaging of soft matter with atomic force microscopy (AFM) is challenging due to tip-induced deformation, which convolutes with the measurement. The challenges are generally more serious in liquid environments due to a severe loss of sensitivity of the vibrating microcantilever to external forces, as well as due to the presence of undesirable mechanical resonances when piezoelectric excitation systems are used. Furthermore, the choice of imaging parameters can have a significant impact on the quality of the results, such that the customary practices used for tuning the cantilever are not always appropriate. Here we explore the influence of the chosen drive frequency on the imaging of ultrasoft matter, using surface gas nanobubbles on gold-coated glass and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) as a test platform. We carry out single- and multifrequency AFM experiments using both the traditional amplitude-peak method and the recently proposed phase-slope-peak method for tuning the cantilever, as well as piezoelectric and photothermal excitation, providing an extensive discussion on the factors governing the level of tip-induced sample deformation and the quality of the phase contrast obtained for each of the methods. The general conclusion is that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach for tuning the cantilever for low-impact tapping-mode AFM, although rational optimization of the imaging process is generally possible, whereby the choice of the drive frequency plays a prominent role. The physical insight and guidelines provided here can be extremely useful for the gentle imaging of a wide range of biological and other soft materials in liquid environments. Microsc. Res.

{"title": "Calibration Methods of Acoustic Emission Sensors.", "abstract": "This study examined outstanding issues of sensitivity calibration methods for ultrasonic and acoustic emission transducers and provides workable solutions based on physically measureable quantities, laser-based displacement measurement in particular. This leads to mutually consistent determination of transmitting and receiving sensitivities of sensors and transducers. Methods of circumventing problems of extraneous vibrations on free transmitters are used, giving the foundation for face-to-face calibration methods. Working on many ultrasonic and acoustic emission transducers, their receiving and transmitting sensitivities are found to be always different, while their ratios exhibit unexpected similarity. This behavior is attributed to monopolar pulse generation and bipolar received signals due to electrical charge transfer during elastic wave motion and reflection on the back face. This is verified through a quantitative piezoelectric sensing experiment. Displacement vs. velocity calibration terminology is clarified, redefining the \"V/\u00b5bar\" reference for contact sensor calibration. With demonstrated differences in the transmitting and receiving sensitivities of transducers, the requirement of the Hill-Adams equation invalidates the basic premise of the currently formulated reciprocity calibration methods for acoustic emission transducers. In addition, the measured reciprocity parameter for the case of through-transmission significantly deviates from the approximate theoretical prediction.

The stator and rotor are designed as similar structures an elastic body and a piezoelectric ceramic ring. In exciting of the piezoelectric ceramics, the elastic body of the stator and rotor will generate respective traveling waves, which force each other forward in the contact zone. Based on the elliptical rule of particle motion and matching principle of vibration, the design rules of two vibrators are determined. The finite element method is used to design the sizes of vibrators to ensure that they operate in resonance, and the simulation is verified by measuring the vibration with an impedance analyzer. It is found out that to maintain an appropriate contact between the stator and rotor, two vibrators need to be designed with close resonance frequencies, different vibration amplitudes, and be driven by an identical driving frequency. To analyze this innovative contact mechanism, particle velocity synthesis theory and contact force analysis using Hertz contact model are carried out. Finally, a prototype is fabricated and tested to verify the theoretical results.

The scaling of the device thickness in the nanometer range and the achievement of high infrared absorption in such a subwavelength thickness, without sacrificing the electromechanical performance, are the two key challenges for the implementation of fast, high-resolution micro-/nanoelectromechanical resonant infrared detectors. In this paper, we show that by using a virtually massless, high-electrical-conductivity, and transparent graphene electrode, floating at the van der Waals separation of a few angstroms from a piezoelectric aluminum nitride nanoplate, it is possible to implement ultrathin (460\u2009nm) piezoelectric nanomechanical resonant structures with improved electromechanical performance (>50% improved frequency\u00d7quality factor) and infrared detection capabilities (>100\u00d7 improved infrared absorptance) compared with metal-electrode counterparts, despite their reduced volumes.

During long periods of recording, a drift in the speed of displacement of the center of mass (necessary to calculate WEXT) is generated. To suppress this drift, wavelet decomposition is used to low-pass filter the source signal. By using wavelet decomposition coefficients, the source signal can be recovered. To check the validity of WEXT calculations after signal processing, an oscillating pendulum system was first used; then, 10 healthy subjects performed a standardized exercise (squatting exercise). A medical application is also reported in eight Parkinsonian patients during the timed \"get-up and go\" test and compared with the same test in ten healthy subjects.\nValues of WEXT with the oscillating pendulum showed that the system was accurate and reliable. During the squatting exercise, the average measured WEXT was 0.4% lower than theoretical work. WEXT and mechanical work efficiency during the \"get-up and go\" test in Parkinson's disease patients in comparison with that of healthy subjects were very coherent.\nThis method has numerous applications for studying physical activity and mechanical work efficiency in physiological and pathological conditions.", "journal": "Gait & posture", "date": "2016-06-18", "authors": ["VincentGigot", "VirginieVan Wymelbeke", "DavyLaroche", "ThomasMouillot", "Agn\u00e8sJacquin-Piques", "MatthieuRoss\u00e9", "MichelTavan", "LaurentBrondel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gaitpost.2016.04.013"}

Here, we hypothesized that this higher bone repair could be also due to bone resorption inhibition mediated by a microRNA (miR)/RANKL circuit. To test our hypothesis, the large-scale miR expression of bone tissue grown on PVDF and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes was evaluated to identify potential RANKL-targeted miRs modulated by PVDF. The animal model used was rat calvarial defects implanted with either PVDF or PTFE. At 4 and 8\u00a0weeks, the bone tissue grown on membranes was submitted to a large-scale analysis of miRs by microarray. The expression of miR-34a and some of its targets, including RANKL, were evaluated by real-time polimerase chain reaction and osteoclast activity was detected by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Among more than 250 miRs, twelve, including miR-34a, were simultaneously higher expressed (\u22652 fold) at 4 and 8\u00a0weeks on PVDF. The higher expression of miR-34a was concomitant with a reduced expression of all its evaluated targets, including RANKL. Additionally, more TRAP-positive cells were observed in bone tissue grown on PTFE compared with PVDF in both time points. In conclusion, our results suggest that the higher bone formation induced by PVDF could be, at least in part, triggered by a miR-34a increase and RANKL decrease, which may inhibit osteoclast differentiation and activity, and bone resorption.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials science.

{"title": "Treatment of lead contaminated water by a PVDF membrane that is modified by zirconium, phosphate and PVA.", "abstract": "Lead contamination is one of the most serious problems in drinking water facing humans. In this study, a novel zirconium phosphate modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-PVDF membrane was developed for lead removal. The zirconium ions and PVA were firstly coated onto a PVDF membrane through crosslinking reactions with glutaraldehyde, which was then modified by phosphate. The adsorption kinetics study showed that most of ultimate uptake occurred in 5\u00a0h. The adsorption increased with an increase in pH; the optimal adsorption was achieved at pH 5.5. The experimental data were better described by Langmuir equation than Freundlich equation; the maximum adsorption capacity was 121.2\u00a0mg-Pb/g at pH 5.5, much higher than other reported adsorptive membranes. The membrane exhibited a higher selectivity for lead over zinc with a relative selectivity coefficient (Pb(2+)/Zn(2+)) of 9.92. The filtration study showed that the membrane with an area of 12.56\u00a0cm(2) could treat 13.9\u00a0L (equivalent to 73,000 bed volumes) of lead containing wastewater with an influent concentration of 224.5\u00a0\u03bc\u00a0g/L to meet the maximum contaminant level of 15\u00a0\u03bc\u00a0g/L. It was demonstrated that the membrane did well in the removal of lead in both simulated wastewater and lead-spiked reservoir water and had a good reusability in its applications.

{"title": "Intrinsic ferroelectric switching from first principles.", "abstract": "The existence of domain walls, which separate regions of different polarization, can influence the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and electronic properties of ferroelectric materials. In particular, domain-wall motion is crucial for polarization switching, which is characterized by the hysteresis loop that is a signature feature of ferroelectric materials. Experimentally, the observed dynamics of polarization switching and domain-wall motion are usually explained as the behaviour of an elastic interface pinned by a random potential that is generated by defects, which appear to be strongly sample-dependent and affected by various elastic, microstructural and other extrinsic effects. Theoretically, connecting the zero-kelvin, first-principles-based, microscopic quantities of a sample with finite-temperature, macroscopic properties such as the coercive field is critical for material design and device performance; and the lack of such a connection has prevented the use of techniques based on ab initio calculations for high-throughput computational materials discovery. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations of 90\u00b0 domain walls (separating domains with orthogonal polarization directions) in the ferroelectric material PbTiO3 to provide microscopic insights that enable the construction of a simple, universal, nucleation-and-growth-based analytical model that quantifies the dynamics of many types of domain walls in various ferroelectrics. We then predict the temperature and frequency dependence of hysteresis loops and coercive fields at finite temperatures from first principles. We find that, even in the absence of defects, the intrinsic temperature and field dependence of the domain-wall velocity can be described with a nonlinear creep-like region and a depinning-like region. Our model enables quantitative estimation of coercive fields, which agree well with experimental results for ceramics and thin films. This agreement between model and experiment suggests that, despite the complexity of ferroelectric materials, typical ferroelectric switching is largely governed by a simple, universal mechanism of intrinsic domain-wall motion, providing an efficient framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of ferroelectric materials.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2016-06-17", "authors": ["ShiLiu", "IlyaGrinberg", "Andrew MRappe"], "doi": "10.1038/nature18286"}

Efficient on-chip electrical switching of plasmonic resonances is a crucial step toward the integration of optical antennas into practical optoelectronic circuits. We propose and numerically investigate the on-chip low-voltage linear electrical tuning of a narrowband optical antenna perfect absorber via a piezoelectric optomechanic cavity. Near unity absorption is realized by an array of gold nanostrip antennas separated from a membrane-based deformable backreflector by a small gap. A narrow linewidth of 33\u00a0nm at 2.58\u00a0\u03bcm is realized through the coupling between the plasmonic mode and photonic mode in the cavity-enhanced antenna structure. An aluminum nitride piezoelectric layer enabled efficient actuation of the backreflector and therefore changed the gap size, allowing for the tuning of the spectral absorption. The peak wavelength can be shifted linearly by 250\u00a0nm with 10\u00a0V of tuning voltage, and the tuning range is not limited by the pull-in effect.

An array of piezoelectric elements is connected in parallel to metal electrodes immersed in dielectric fluids. When deflected in a controlled sequence via human finger power, the piezoelectric elements charge and actuate droplets across each electrode pair through electrophoretic force. Successful droplet transportation requires the piezoelectric elements to provide both sufficient charge and voltage pulse duration. We quantify these requirements using numerical models to predict the electrical charges induced on the droplets and the corresponding electrophoretic forces. The models are experimentally validated by comparing the predicted and measured droplet translational velocities. We successfully demonstrated transport and merging of aqueous droplets over a range of droplet radii (0.6-0.9 mm). We further showed direct manipulation of body fluids, including droplets of saliva and urine, using our finger-powered EPD device.

In recent years, it was directly proved that this effect stems from a polymeric matrix in bone, i.e., collagen fibrils. This effect in collagen is distinctly different from organic piezoelectric crystals, given the semicrystalline molecular structure of the collagen biopolymer. As such, the molecular mechanism of this electromechanical coupling effect in a realistic \"super-twisted\" model of collagen has been elusive. Herein, we present an investigation on the molecular mechanism of piezoelectric effect in collagen using full atomistic simulation based on the experimentally verified \"super-twisted\" microstructure of collagen. Our results reveal that collagen exhibits a uniaxial polarization along the long axis of the collagen fibril. In addition, the piezoelectric effect in collagen originates at the collagen molecule level and is due to the mechanical stress-induced reorientation and magnitude change of the permanent dipoles of individual charged and polar residues.

Therefore, a numerical simulation of GW propagation in the HCSS with and without the HD-core region is carried out, using surface-bonded piezoelectric wafer transducer (PWT) network.

The light emission intensity of a single heterostructure LED is tuned by external strain: when the applied stress keeps increasing, the emission intensity first increases and then decreases with a maximum value at a compressive strain of 0.15-0.2%. This result is attributed to the piezo-phototronic effect, which can efficiently modulate the LED emission intensity by utilizing the strain-induced piezo-polarization charges. It could tune the energy band diagrams at the junction area and regulate the optoelectronic processes such as charge carriers generation, separation, recombination, and transport.

Such films were surface absorbed with two essential oils namely eucalyptus and tea tree oil. Physico-chemical characterization of the composite film revealed excellent stability of the film with 10% loading of oils in the PVDF matrix. XRD, FTIR and FESEM measurements confirmed the presence of hydroxyapatite and octacalcium phosphate in the PVDF matrix which showed predominantly \u03b2 phase. Strong bactericidal activity was observed with very low minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values on both E. coli and S. aureus. The composite films also resisted biofilm formation as observed by FESEM. The release of essential oils from the film showed an initial burst followed by a very slow release over a period of 24 hours. Antibacterial action of the film was found to be primarily due to the action of essential oils which resulted in leakage of vital fluids from the microorganisms.

{"title": "Flexible Piezoelectric Tactile Sensor Array for Dynamic Three-Axis Force Measurement.", "abstract": "A new flexible piezoelectric tactile sensor array based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film is proposed for measuring three-axis dynamic contact force distribution. The array consists of six tactile units arranged as a 3 \u00d7 2 matrix with spacing 8 mm between neighbor units. In each unit, a PVDF film is sandwiched between four square-shaped upper electrodes and one square-shaped lower electrode, forming four piezoelectric capacitors. A truncated pyramid bump is located above the four piezoelectric capacitors to improve force transmission. A three-axis contact force transmitted from the top of the bump will lead to the four piezoelectric capacitors underneath undergoing different charge changes, from which the normal and shear components of the force can be calculated. A series of dynamic tests have been carried out by exerting sinusoidal forces with amplitudes ranging from 0 to 0.5 N in the x-axis, 0 to 0.5 N in the y-axis, and 0 to 1.5 N in the z-axis, separately. The tactile units show good sensitivities with 14.93, 14.92, and 6.62 pC/N in the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. They can work with good linearity, relatively low coupling effect, high repeatability, and acceptable frequency response in the range of 5-400 Hz to both normal and shear load. In addition, dynamic three-axis force measurement has been conducted for all of the tactile units. The average errors between the applied and calculated forces are 10.68% \u00b1 6.84%.

{"title": "Multiplexed Western Blotting Using Microchip Electrophoresis.", "abstract": "Western blotting is a commonly used protein assay that combines the selectivity of electrophoretic separation and immunoassay. The technique is limited by long time, manual operation with mediocre reproducibility, and large sample consumption, typically 10-20 \u03bcg per assay. Western blots are also usually used to measure only one protein per assay with an additional housekeeping protein for normalization. Measurement of multiple proteins is possible; however, it requires stripping membranes of antibody and then reprobing with a second antibody. Miniaturized alternatives to Western blot based on microfluidic or capillary electrophoresis have been developed that enable higher-throughput, automation, and greater mass sensitivity. In one approach, proteins are separated by electrophoresis on a microchip that is dragged along a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane so that as proteins exit the chip they are captured on the membrane for immunoassay. In this work, we improve this method to allow multiplexed protein detection. Multiple injections made from the same sample can be deposited in separate tracks so that each is probed with a different antibody. To further enhance multiplexing capability, the electrophoresis channel dimensions were optimized for resolution while keeping separation and blotting times to less than 8 min. Using a 15 \u03bcm deep \u00d7 50 \u03bcm wide \u00d7 8.6 cm long channel, it is possible to achieve baseline resolution of proteins that differ by 5% in molecular weight, e.g., ERK1 (44 kDa) from ERK2 (42 kDa). This resolution allows similar proteins detected by cross-reactive antibodies in a single track. We demonstrate detection of 11 proteins from 9 injections from a single Jurkat cell lysate sample consisting of 400 ng of total protein using this procedure. Thus, multiplexed Western blots are possible without cumbersome stripping and reprobing steps.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2016-06-09", "authors": ["ShiJin", "Michael DFurtaw", "HuaxianChen", "Don TLamb", "Stephen AFerguson", "Natalie EArvin", "MohamedDawod", "Robert TKennedy"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00705"}
{"title": "Spatial averaging effects of hydrophone on field characterization of planar transducer using Fresnel approximation.", "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to improve the existing models that allow spatial averaging effects of piezoelectric hydrophones to be accounted for. The model derived in the present study is valid for a planar source and was verified using transducers operating at 5 and 20MHz. It is based on Fresnel approximation and enables corrections for both on-axis and off-axis measurements. A single-integral approximate formula for the axial acoustic pressure was derived, and the validity of the Fresnel approximation in the near field of the planar transducer was examined. The numerical results obtained using 5 and 20MHz planar transmitters with an effective diameter of 12.7mm showed that the derived model could account for spatial averaging effects to within 0.2% with Beissner's exact integral (Beissner, 1981), for k(a+b)2\u226b\u03c0 (where k is the circular wavenumber, and a and b are the effective radii of the transmitter and hydrophone, respectively). The field distributions along the acoustic axis and the beam directivity patterns are also included in the model. The spatial averaging effects of the hydrophone were generally observed to cause underestimation of the absolute pressure amplitudes of the acoustic beam, and overestimation of the cross-sectional size of the beam directivity pattern. However, the cross-sectional size of the directivity pattern was also found to be underestimated in the \"far zone\" (beyond Y0=a(2)/\u03bb) of the transmitter. The results of this study indicate that the spatial averaging effect on the beam directivity pattern is negligible for \u03c0(\u03b3(2)+4\u03b3)s\u226a1 (where \u03b3=b/a, and s is the normalized distance to the planar transducer).", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-06-09", "authors": ["GuangzhenXing", "PingYang", "LongbiaoHe", "XiujuanFeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.05.022"}

In this study, a novel zirconium/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) modified polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was applied to remove organic arsenic from water. The impregnation of zirconium ions within the modified membrane was attributed to the coordination reactions among the zirconium ions, ether and hydroxyl groups. The synthesized membrane worked better at the acidic conditions and achieved the optimal uptake for both monomethylarsonic (MMA) and dimethylarsinic (DMA) at pH 2.0. The adsorption isotherm study demonstrated that the adsorption of both organic arsenic species was controlled by the mono-layer adsorption process; the maximum adsorption capacities for MMA and DMA were 73.04 and 37.53mg/g at pH 2, and 29.78 and 19.03mg/g at pH 7.0, respectively. The presence of humic acid had a negligible impact on the uptake of organic arsenic, whereas varying impacts on the arsenic adsorption were observed due to the presence of coexisting anions such as fluoride, phosphate, carbonate and silicate. A single piece of membrane with a surface area of only 12.56cm(2) could treat 7.5-L MMA and 4.1-L DMA solution with an influent concentration of about 100\u03bcg/L to meet the WHO and USEPA standard of 10\u03bcg/L.

In addition, the separation performance of membranes were reflected by the removal of dye and heavy metal ions in simulated wastewater. The results revealed that the hydrophilicity of A-HNTs blended PVDF membrane (A-HNTs@PVDF) was enhanced significantly.

The heavy metal ions rejection ratio and adsorption capacity of membrane were also improved with the addition of A-HNTs.

{"title": "Investigation of polymer-shelled microbubble motions in acoustophoresis.", "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to explore the trajectory motion of microsize (typically smaller than a red blood cell) encapsulated polymer-shelled gas bubbles propelled by radiation force in an acoustic standing-wave field and to compare the corresponding movements of solid polymer microbeads. The experimental setup consists of a microfluidic chip coupled to a piezoelectric crystal (PZT) with a resonance frequency of about 2.8MHz. The microfluidic channel consists of a rectangular chamber with a width, w, corresponding to one wavelength of the ultrasound standing wave. It creates one full wave ultrasound of a standing-wave pattern with two pressure nodes at w/4 and 3w/4 and three antinodes at 0, w/2, and w. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the electrical potential over the PZT was varied between 1 and 10V. The study is limited to no-flow condition. From Gor'kov's potential equation, the acoustic contrast factor, \u03a6, for the polymer-shelled microbubbles was calculated to about -60.7. Experimental results demonstrate that the polymer-shelled microbubbles are translated and accumulated at the pressure antinode planes. This trajectory motion of polymer-shelled microbubbles toward the pressure antinode plane is similar to what has been described for other acoustic contrast particles with a negative \u03a6. First, primary radiation forces dragged the polymer-shelled microbubbles into proximity with each other at the pressure antinode planes. Then, primary and secondary radiation forces caused them to quickly aggregate at different spots along the channel. The relocation time for polymer-shelled microbubbles was 40 times shorter than that for polymer microbeads, and in contrast to polymer microbeads, the polymer-shelled microbubbles were actuated even at driving voltages (proportional to radiation forces) as low as 1V. In short, the polymer-shelled microbubbles demonstrate the behavior attributed to the negative acoustic contrast factor particles and thus can be trapped at the antinode plane and thereby separated from particles having a positive acoustic contrast factor, such as for example solid particles and cells.

In young rodents, stereocilia bundles of auditory hair cells consist of 3-4 rows of stereocilia of decreasing height and varying thickness. Morphological studies of the auditory stereocilia bundles in live hair cells have been challenging because the diameter of each stereocilium is near or below the resolution limit of optical microscopy. In theory, scanning probe microscopy techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, could visualize the surface of a living cell at a nanoscale resolution. However, their implementations for hair cell imaging have been largely unsuccessful because the probe usually damages the bundle and disrupts the bundle cohesiveness during imaging. We overcome these limitations by using hopping probe ion conductance microscopy (HPICM), a non-contact scanning probe technique that is ideally suited for the imaging of live cells with a complex topography. Organ of Corti explants are placed in a physiological solution and then a glass nanopipette-which is connected to a 3D-positioning piezoelectric system and to a patch clamp amplifier-is used to scan the surface of the live hair cells at nanometer resolution without ever touching the cell surface.Here, we provide a detailed protocol for the imaging of mouse or rat stereocilia bundles in live auditory hair cells using HPICM.

We demonstrate the I-V characteristic of the as-prepared core/double-shell device; it is quite sensitive to applied strain, which indicates that the piezo-phototronic effect plays an essential role in facilitating charge carrier transport across the CuI/ZnO heterojunction, then the performance of the device is further boosted under external strain.", "journal": "Nanoscale research letters", "date": "2016-06-04", "authors": ["JingyuLiu", "YangZhang", "CaihongLiu", "MingzengPeng", "AifangYu", "JinzongKou", "WeiLiu", "JunyiZhai", "JuanLiu"], "doi": "10.1186/s11671-016-1499-1\n10.1126/science.1124005\n10.1002/adma.201104365\n10.1002/adma.201203021\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.02.030\n10.1039/C2EE23404A\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.10.014\n10.1021/acsami.5b10345\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b00069\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.02.009\n10.1021/am503442c\n10.1039/C4TA06266C\n10.1088/0957-4484/25/26/265501\n10.1002/smll.201502170\n10.1021/acsnano.5b07217\n10.1021/acsnano.5b02081\n10.1002/adma.201300296\n10.1021/acsnano.5b00072\n10.1021/nn401232k\n10.1002/adma.201405274\n10.1021/nn506427p\n10.1021/nl400792w\n10.1007/s12274-014-0447-6\n10.1088/0957-4484/22/22/225602\n10.1002/adfm.200901671\n10.1002/adma.201405087\n10.1039/C5RA09878E\n10.1021/cg060288p\n10.1016/j.tsf.2004.11.020\n10.1039/C5TC00719D\n10.1038/nnano.2010.46\n10.1063/1.4794532"}

However, it is quite difficult to fabricate a curved surface electrostatic resonator with large-scale effective electrodes. This paper presents the first miniature hemispherical shell resonator with large-scale effective electrodes based on piezoelectric drive mechanism. The vibrating body and electrodes of the piezoelectric resonator are easily integrated without micro-scale or nano-scale narrow capacitive gap. Vibration experiment and finite element analysis both reveal that there exist seven significant vibration modes between 10 kHz and 100 kHz. Mode shape validation is also carried out by measuring the vibration velocity of upper perimeter and lateral perimeter with laser doppler vibrometer. Special vibration characteristics of each vibration mode are described in detail, based on which the resonator may be used for many specific applications. Compared with common electrostatic resonators, even smaller drive voltage applied to the piezoelectric resonator may produce larger vibration displacement at atmosphere.

An acousto-optic modulator is used to generate 1-25 \u03bcs pulses from a continuous-wave CO2 laser, both to limit the average power at the detector and also to freeze motion from sub-interframe time scales. Extensive effort was made to characterize and eliminate noise from vibrations and second-surface reflections. Mismatch of the reference and object beam curvature initially contributed substantially to vibrational noise, but was mitigated through careful positioning of identical imaging lenses. Vibrational mode amplitudes were successfully reduced to \u22721 nm for frequencies \u227350 Hz, and the inter-frame noise across the 128 \u00d7 128 pixel window which is typically used is \u22722.5 nm.

Results show that the capacitance ratio assumes maxima at two resonances, which are identified to be the second overtone modes of fast-shear and extension, respectively.

{"title": "A New Non-Destructive TDR System Combined with a Piezoelectric Stack for Measuring Properties of Geomaterials.", "abstract": "Dry density and water content are two important factors affecting the degree of soil compaction. Conventional methods such as the sand cone test and the plate load test are used to measure such properties for evaluating the degree of compaction and the stiffness of soil in the field. However, these tests are generally very time-consuming and are inherent with some errors depending on the operator (in particular for the sand cone test). Elastic modulus is an indicator to describe the stress-strain behavior of soil and in some cases is used as a design input parameter. Although a rod type TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) system has been recently proposed to overcome some shortcomings of the conventional methods (particularly the sand cone test), it requires driving the probes into the ground, thus implying that it is still a time-consuming and destructive testing method. This study aims to develop a new non-destructive TDR system that can rapidly measure the dry density, water content, and elastic modulus of soil on the surface of compacted soil, without disturbing the ground. In this study, the Piezoelectric Stack, which is an instrument for measuring the elastic modulus of soil, has been added to the TDR system with a flat type probe, leading to a non-destructive TDR system that is capable of measuring the dry density, water content, and elastic modulus of soil. The new TDR system developed is light enough for an engineer to carry. Results of the standard compaction and TDR tests on sand showed that the dry densities and the moisture contents measured with the new TDR system were in good agreement with those measured with the standard compaction test, respectively. Consequently, it appears that the new TDR system developed will be very useful to advance the current practice of compaction quality control.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-06-02", "authors": ["ChanyongChoi", "MinwooSong", "DaehyeonKim", "XiongYu"], "doi": "10.3390/ma9060439\n10.1021/j100723a023\n10.1029/WR016i003p00574\n10.1111/j.1365-2389.1992.tb00115.x\n10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700030005x\n10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01409.x\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2004)130:9(922)\n10.1139/cgj-2013-0313\n10.2136/sssaj2001.1618\n10.2136/sssaj2007.0332\n10.2136/sssaj2013.07.0278\n10.2136/sssaj1999.03615995006300030005x\n10.1121/1.381760\n10.1016/0001-8716(75)80013-7\n10.1029/97WR00435\n10.1029/98WR02093"}

SANS results reveal that spherical micelles in the low concentration regime present a dehydrated core and highly hydrated shell, with a small aggregation number and size, highly dependent on the degree of protonation of the central amine spacer. At high concentration, T1107 undergoes a sol-gel transition, which is inhibited at acidic pH. Nanocomposites were prepared by incorporating CD-modified BT of two different sizes (50 and 200 nm) in concentrated polymer solutions. Rheological measurements show a broadening of the gel region, as well as an improvement of the mechanical properties, as assessed by the shear elastic modulus, G' (up to 200% increase).

The information from those noisy signals can be recovered after averaging or pulse compression using binary (1-b) quantization only without experiencing significant losses. Hence, no analog-to-digital converter is required, which reduces the data throughput and makes the electronics faster, more compact, and energy efficient. All these are especially attractive for applications that require arrays with many channels and high sampling rates, where the sampling rate can be as high as the system clock. In this paper, the theory of binary quantization is reviewed, mainly from previous work on wireless sensor networks, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the input signals under which binary quantization is of practical interest for ultrasound applications is investigated. The main findings are that in most practical cases binary quantization can be used with small errors when the input SNR is on the order of 8 dB or less.

{"title": "2-D steering and propelling of acoustic bubble-powered microswimmers.", "abstract": "This paper describes bi-directional (linear and rotational) propelling and 2-D steering of acoustic bubble-powered microswimmers that are achieved in a centimeter-scale pool (beyond chip level scale). The core structure of a microswimmer is a microtube with one end open in which a gaseous bubble is trapped. The swimmer is propelled by microstreaming flows that are generated when the trapped bubble is oscillated by an external acoustic wave. The bubble oscillation and thus propelling force are highly dependent on the frequency of the acoustic wave and the bubble length. This dependence is experimentally studied by measuring the resonance behaviors of the testing pool and bubble using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) and by evaluating the generated streaming flows. The key idea in the present 2-D steering is to utilize this dependence. Multiple bubbles with different lengths are mounted on a single microswimmer with a variety of arrangements. By controlling the frequency of the acoustic wave, only frequency-matched bubbles can strongly oscillate and generate strong propulsion. By arranging multiple bubbles of different lengths in parallel but with their openings opposite and switching the frequency of the acoustic wave, bi-directionally linear propelling motions are successfully achieved. The propelling forces are calculated by a CFD analysis using the Ansys Fluent\u00ae package. For bi-directional rotations, a similar method but with diagonal arrangement of bubbles on a rectangular swimmer is also applied. The rotation can be easily reversed when the frequency of the acoustic wave is switched. For 2-D steering, short bubbles are aligned perpendicular to long bubbles. It is successfully demonstrated that the microswimmer navigates through a T-junction channel under full control with and without carrying a payload. During the navigation, the frequency is the main control input to select and resonate targeted bubbles. All of these operations are achieved by a single piezoelectric actuator.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-05-28", "authors": ["JianFeng", "JunqiYuan", "Sung KwonCho"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc00431h"}
{"title": "Probing the Reaction Mechanism of Aluminum/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Composites.", "abstract": "Energetic thin films with high mass loadings of nanosized components have been recently fabricated using electrospray deposition. These films are composed of aluminum nanoparticles (nAl) homogeneously dispersed in an energetic fluoropolymer binder, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The nascent oxide shell of the nAl has been previously shown to undergo a preignition reaction (PIR) with fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). This work examines the PIR between alumina and PVDF to further explain the reaction mechanism of the Al/PVDF system. Temperature jump (T-jump) ignition experiments in air, argon, and vacuum environments showed that the nAl is fluorinated by gas phase species due to a decrease in reactivity in a vacuum. Thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) was used to confirm the occurrence of a PIR, and gas phase products during the PIR and fluorination of nAl were investigated with temperature jump time-of-flight mass spectrometry (T-jump TOFMS). Results show a direct correlation between the amount of alumina in the PVDF film and the relative signal intensity of hydrogen fluoride release (HF). Although the PIR between alumina and PVDF plays an important role in the Al/PVDF reaction mechanism, burn speeds of Al/PVDF films containing additional pure alumina particles showed no burn speed enhancement.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

The inherent anisotropy of the hexagonal crystal structure leads to anisotropic strain and, consequently, to a pronounced piezoelectric field along the c axis, which can be amplified or quenched through a proper design of the core-shell structure. The use of large cores and thick shells promotes a gradual departure from quantum confined nanocrystals to a regime dominated by piezoelectric confinement. This allows excitons to evolve from the usual type-I and quasi-type-II behavior to a type-II behavior in dot-in-dots, dot-in-rods, rod-in-rods, and dot-in-plates. Piezoelectric fields explain experimental observations for giant-shell nanocrystals, whose time-resolved photoluminescence reveals long exciton lifetimes for large cores, contrary to the expectations of standard quantum confinement models.

The animals were sacrificed after 30 days and then the following histomorphometric parameters were evaluated (percentage) separately for cortical and cancellous regions: proportion of mineralized tissue (PMT) adjacent to implant threads (500 \u03bcm adjacent); bone area within the threads (BA) and bone-implant contact (BIC). The results demonstrated that there were no statistically significant differences between both groups for cancellous BIC (p>0.05) and cortical PMT (p>0.05).

Three typical methods (inkjet, micro-extrusion, and laser-assisted bio-printing) have been used to fabricate structures. Of these, micro-extrusion is a comparatively easy method, but has some drawbacks such as low in situ cell viability after fabricating cell-laden structures because of the high wall shear stress in micro-sized nozzles. To overcome this shortcoming, we suggest an innovative cell printing method, which is assisted by a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). The PZT assistance in the dispensing process enhances the printing efficiency and cell viability by decreasing the wall shear stress within a nozzle because the PZT effect can lower the shear viscosity of the bioink via micro-scale vibration.

Some of the popular fields implementing the use of biosensors are food industry to keep a check on its quality and safety, to help distinguish between the natural and artificial; in the fermentation industry and in the saccharification process to detect precise glucose concentrations; in metabolic engineering to enable in vivo monitoring of cellular metabolism. Biosensors and their role in medical science including early stage detection of human interleukin-10 causing heart diseases, rapid detection of human papilloma virus, etc. are important aspects.

{"title": "Competing covalent and ionic bonding in Ge-Sb-Te phase change materials.", "abstract": "Ge2Sb2Te5 and related phase change materials are highly unusual in that they can be readily transformed between amorphous and crystalline states using very fast melt, quench, anneal cycles, although the resulting states are extremely long lived at ambient temperature. These states have remarkably different physical properties including very different optical constants in the visible in strong contrast to common glass formers such as silicates or phosphates. This behavior has been described in terms of resonant bonding, but puzzles remain, particularly regarding different physical properties of crystalline and amorphous phases. Here we show that there is a strong competition between ionic and covalent bonding in cubic phase providing a link between the chemical basis of phase change memory property and origins of giant responses of piezoelectric materials (PbTiO3, BiFeO3). This has important consequences for dynamical behavior in particular leading to a simultaneous hardening of acoustic modes and softening of high frequency optic modes in crystalline phase relative to amorphous. This different bonding in amorphous and crystalline phases provides a direct explanation for different physical properties and understanding of the combination of long time stability and rapid switching and may be useful in finding new phase change compositions with superior properties.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-05-20", "authors": ["SaikatMukhopadhyay", "JifengSun", "AlaskaSubedi", "TheoSiegrist", "David JSingh"], "doi": "10.1038/srep25981"}

However, their use is restricted by the intrinsic nonlinearity of the cMUT transmitters themselves, because it is difficult to distinguish between the nonlinearity of the microbubbles and the nonlinearity arising from the emitting transducer. A number of approaches have been proposed in recent years to cancel the nonlinearity of cMUTs. However, these techniques have limitations in terms of implementation with current ultrasound scanner electronics. The solution to be comparable with classical methods should not need precharacterization of the probe or changing the bias voltage (amplitude or polarity) but does need good sensitivity and a high frame rate to avoid motion artifacts. We propose here proof of a concept of an adapted amplitude modulation sequence with cMUT where transmit elements operate alternately. We show that this method, which is currently used with piezoelectric probes, is fully applicable to cMUT probes and the intrinsic nonlinearity of the transmitter is no longer an issue.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2016-05-18", "authors": ["DamienFouan", "AyacheBouakaz"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2567641"}

Therefore, bone resorption represents a challenge for the practitioner. Bone expansion is a surgical technique that allows the management of horizontal bone atrophy. Cortical bone splitting allows for an enlargement of the residual crest by displacement of the vestibular bone flap. The immediate placement of implants secures the widening and allows for a 97% survival rate. However, bone expansion is hard to undertake in sites with high bone density. Furthermore, the use of traditional instruments increases patient's stress and the risk for an interruptive fracture during bone displacement. Non-traumatic bone expansion is one solution to this problem. The combination of piezo-surgery and conical expanders allows for a secured displacement of the selected bone flap as well as an immediate implant placement, avoiding the risk of slipping, overheating, or fracture, all within an undeniable operative comfort. Non-traumatic bone expansion is a reliable, reproducible, conservative, and economical in time and cost procedure.

Study outcomes were compared with those of implant placement in the same patients using the conventional drilling technique.\nTen patients received a total of 22 implants in the anterior maxilla, 11 of which were placed using a ridge-splitting procedure (test group) and the other 11 using the conventional drilling procedure (control group). Ridge width (RW), crestal bone level (BL), and implant stability quotient (ISQ) were measured at different points in time. Data were analyzed and compared between the groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired-sample t tests at a significance level of 5%.\nFor the test group, the gain in RW was not stable in time because at 6 months postoperatively, the RW lost some of the initial gain; however, the net gain was still significant. At 6 months postoperatively, BL was similar for both groups. The net bone loss on the mesial aspect and the average of the mesial and the distal measures did not differ significantly between both groups. ISQ values sharply increased at 3 months postoperatively in the test group. All implants met the modified Albrektsson criteria (1989) for success.\nThe results from this study support the efficacy and safety of ridge expansion using piezoelectric surgery for implant insertion in the anterior maxilla. The modest net gain in bone width suggests that additional hard and soft tissue augmentation may be necessary, especially in the esthetic zone.

First, the state transfer equation of the functionally graded interlayer is derived from the motion equation by the reduction of order (from second order to first order). The transfer matrix of the functionally graded interlayer is obtained by solving the state transfer equation with the spatial-varying coefficient. Based on the transfer matrixes of the piezoelectric slab, the piezomagnetic slab and the functionally graded interlayers, the total transfer matrix of a single cell is obtained. Further, the Bloch theorem is used to obtain the resultant dispersion equations of in-plane and anti-plane Bloch waves. The dispersion equations are solved numerically and the numerical results are shown graphically.

In this paper, the effects of adhesive layer between the transducers and the host plate, the tone burst count of the excitation signal, the plate thickness, and the piezoelectric transducer thickness on the time reversibility of Lamb waves in metallic plates are studied using experiments and finite element simulations. The effect of adhesive layer on the forward propagation response and frequency tuning has been also studied. The results show that contrary to the general expectation, the quality of the reconstruction of the input signal after the TRP may increase with the increase in the adhesive layer thickness at certain frequency ranges. Similarly, an increase in the tone burst count resulting in a narrowband signal does not necessarily enhance the time reversibility at all frequencies, contrary to what has been reported earlier. For a given plate thickness, a thinner transducer yields a better reconstruction, but for a given transducer thickness, the similarity of the reconstructed signal may not be always higher for a thicker plate.

In general, high piezoresistive sensitivity combined with broad measurable strain ranges are greatly favored in those sensors. Here, a facile strategy, i.e. constructing strain susceptible conductive networks using hybrid filler systems consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNTs, 0.5-1 wt %) and carbon black (CB, 0.5-4 wt %), was introduced to tune both electrical conductivity and piezoresistive sensitivity of melt mixed PVDF nanocomposites. At the same filler content CNTs, due to their larger aspect ratio, contribute more to electrical conductivity improvements of nanocomposites than CB, while contacts between CB particles are more sensitive to tensile strain. With retained ductility of PVDF, tunable electrical conductivity and \u0394R/R0-strain sensitivity can be achieved by combining the advantages of CNTs and CB by adjusting the conductive network structure. Conductivity improvement is more remarkable if the mass ratio of CNTs to CB (mCNTs/mCB), varied between 1:1 and 1:4, is higher in hybrid filler compositions. Lower mCNTs/mCB ratios result in higher \u0394R/R0 values in PVDF nanocomposites whether they have the same content of total filler or similar/the same initial electrical resistivity. At 10% tensile strain, the highest \u0394R/R0 of 0.65 was obtained for the nanocomposite filled with 0.5 wt % CNTs and 0.5 wt % CB, while that for the counterpart containing 1 wt % CNTs is 0.35 at the same strain.

{"title": "Characterization of Full Set Material Constants and Their Temperature Dependence for Piezoelectric Materials Using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy.", "abstract": "During the operation of high power electromechanical devices, a temperature rise is unavoidable due to mechanical and electrical losses, causing the degradation of device performance. In order to evaluate such degradations using computer simulations, full matrix material properties at elevated temperatures are needed as inputs. It is extremely difficult to measure such data for ferroelectric materials due to their strong anisotropic nature and property variation among samples of different geometries. Because the degree of depolarization is boundary condition dependent, data obtained by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) impedance resonance technique, which requires several samples with drastically different geometries, usually lack self-consistency. The resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) technique allows the full set material constants to be measured using only one sample, which can eliminate errors caused by sample to sample variation. A detailed RUS procedure is demonstrated here using a lead zirconate titanate (PZT-4) piezoceramic sample. In the example, the complete set of material constants was measured from room temperature to 120 \u00b0C. Measured free dielectric constants and\u00a0 were compared with calculated ones based on the measured full set data, and piezoelectric constants d15 and d33 were also calculated using different formulas. Excellent agreement was found in the entire range of temperatures, which confirmed the self-consistency of the data set obtained by the RUS.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2016-05-12", "authors": ["LiguoTang", "WenwuCao"], "doi": "10.3791/53461"}
{"title": "Interstitial Pressure in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Is Dominated by a Gel-Fluid Phase.", "abstract": "Elevated interstitial fluid pressure can present a substantial barrier to drug delivery in solid tumors. This is particularly true of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a highly lethal disease characterized by a robust fibroinflammatory response, widespread vascular collapse, and hypoperfusion that together serve as primary mechanisms of treatment resistance. Free-fluid pressures, however, are relatively low in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and cannot account for the vascular collapse. Indeed, we have shown that the overexpression and deposition in the interstitium of high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HA) is principally responsible for generating pressures that can reach 100\u00a0mmHg through the creation of a large gel-fluid phase. By interrogating a variety of tissues, tumor types, and experimental model systems, we show that an HA-dependent fluid phase contributes substantially to pressures in many solid tumors and has been largely unappreciated heretofore. We investigated the relative contributions of both freely mobile fluid and gel fluid to interstitial fluid pressure by performing simultaneous, real-time fluid-pressure measurements with both the classical wick-in-needle method (to estimate free-fluid pressure) and a piezoelectric pressure catheter transducer (which is capable of capturing pressures associated with either phase). We demonstrate further that systemic treatment with pegylated recombinant hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) depletes interstitial HA and eliminates the gel-fluid phase. This significantly reduces interstitial pressures and leaves primarily free fluid behind, relieving the barrier to drug delivery. These findings argue that quantifying the contributions of free- and gel-fluid phases to hydraulically transmitted pressures in a given cancer will be essential to designing the most appropriate and effective strategies to overcome this important and frequently underestimated resistance mechanism.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2016-05-12", "authors": ["Christopher CDuFort", "Kathleen EDelGiorno", "Markus ACarlson", "Ryan JOsgood", "ChunmeiZhao", "ZhongdongHuang", "Curtis BThompson", "Robert JConnor", "Christopher DThanos", "JScott Brockenbrough", "Paolo PProvenzano", "Gregory IFrost", "HMichael Shepard", "Sunil RHingorani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2016.03.040"}

{"title": "Effects of Interphase Modification and Biaxial Orientation on Dielectric Properties of Poly(ethylene terephthalate)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) Multilayer Films.", "abstract": "Recently, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based multilayer films have demonstrated enhanced dielectric properties, combining high energy density and high dielectric breakdown strength from the component polymers. In this work, further enhanced dielectric properties were achieved through interface/interphase modulation and biaxial orientation for the poly(ethylene terephthalate)/poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) [PET/PMMA/P(VDF-HFP)] three-component multilayer films. Because PMMA is miscible with P(VDF-HFP) and compatible with PET, the interfacial adhesion between PET and P(VDF-HFP) layers should be improved. Biaxial stretching of the as-extruded multilayer films induced formation of highly oriented fibrillar crystals in both P(VDF-HFP) and PET, resulting in improved dielectric properties with respect to the unstretched films. First, the parallel orientation of PVDF crystals reduced the dielectric loss from the \u03b1c relaxation in \u03b1 crystals. Second, biaxial stretching constrained the amorphous phase in P(VDF-HFP) and thus the migrational loss from impurity ions was reduced. Third, biaxial stretching induced a significant amount of rigid amorphous phase in PET, further enhancing the breakdown strength of multilayer films. Due to the synergistic effects of improved interfacial adhesion and biaxial orientation, the PET/PMMA/P(VDF-HFP) 65-layer films with 8 vol % PMMA exhibited optimal dielectric properties with an energy density of 17.4 J/cm(3) at breakdown and the lowest dielectric loss.

In this review, we summarize all the recent findings about these 'smart' nanoparticles, including the latest, most promising potential as nanotransducers for cell stimulation.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2016-05-06", "authors": ["Giada GrazianaGenchi", "AttilioMarino", "AntonellaRocca", "VirgilioMattoli", "GianniCiofani"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/27/23/232001"}
{"title": "Giant Electric-Field-Induced Strain in PVDF-Based Battery Separator Membranes Probed by Electrochemical Strain Microscopy.", "abstract": "Efficiency of lithium-ion batteries largely relies on the performance of battery separator membrane as it controls the mobility and concentration of Li-ions between the anode and cathode electrodes. Recent advances in electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) prompted the study of Li diffusion and transport at the nanoscale via electromechanical strain developed under an application of inhomogeneous electric field applied via the sharp ESM tip. In this work, we observed unexpectedly high electromechanical strain developed in polymer membranes based on porous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF-CTFE) and, using it, could study a dynamics of electroosmotic flow of electrolyte inside the pores. We show that, independently of the separator membrane, electric field-induced deformation observed by ESM on wetted membrane surfaces can reach up to 10 nm under a moderate bias of 1 V (i.e., more than an order of magnitude higher than that in best piezoceramics). Such a high strain is explained by the electroosmotic flow in a porous media composed of PVDF. It is shown that the strain-based ESM method can be used to extract valuable information such as average pore size, porosity, elasticity of membrane in electrolyte solvent, and membrane-electrolyte affinity expressed in terms of zeta potential. Besides, such systems can, in principle, serve as actuators even in the absence of apparent piezoelectricity in amorphous PVDF.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2016-05-05", "authors": ["KonstantinRomanyuk", "Carlos MCosta", "Sergey YuLuchkin", "Andrei LKholkin", "SenentxuLanceros-M\u00e9ndez"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01018"}

In order to provide and improve corresponding sensing techniques, an experimental setup system for simultaneous measurement of dynamic displacement and strain on a flexible cantilever beam using two fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) in a single fiber is proposed. To realize high-speed multiplexing and demodulation, a configuration incorporating a coarse wavelength-division multiplexing (CWDM) technique and an FBG transmission filter is implemented. The cantilever beam is subjected to steel-ball impact from which the dynamic multipoint displacement/strain sensing performances of the CWDM and FBG filter-based sensing system are demonstrated. Experimental results in temporal and frequency domain are compared with those obtained by the finite element method (FEM) predictions based on identification of the impact-loading history. A noncontact Fotonic displacement sensor and a polyvinylidene-fluoride film (PVDF) strain sensor are also used for comparison. With transient and resonant frequency simulations conducted by the FEM, loading effects of the sensing system are examined. The results obtained in this study indicate that the proposed CWDM and FBG filter-based sensing system is capable of performing simultaneous multipoint displacement/strain measurements in a single fiber with large bandwidth, high sensitivity, and low intensity loss.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2016-05-04", "authors": ["Kuo-ChihChuang", "Chien-ChingMa", "Hwa-ChunWang"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.55.002426"}

In this work, we have for the first time presented a hollow structured epoxy lens-focused transducer that was based on a 52 \u03bcm thick polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) film for the purpose of PAE imaging. Intensive field characteristic tests were performed on transducers with different lens curvatures, and results show that with the 6 mm fixed aperture, a lateral resolution less than 0.5 mm can be obtained with a focal length around 19 mm, which is close to the theoretical calculations. The PAE application of the built transducer was also demonstrated with phantom experiments. Compared with the commonly used ceramic-based transducers, the proposed method has greatly reduced the design and fabrication cost of the hollow structured focused transducer as required in PAE, and facilitated the development of the PAE system in lab conditions.

Observing the temporal evolution of cell growth and migration and comparing non-irradiated to irradiated areas on the chip, we find that the SAW-treated cells exhibit a significantly increased migration as compared to the control samples.

We safely exclude parasitic side effects such as a SAW related increased substrate temperature or nutrient flow by thoroughly monitoring the temperature and the flow field using infrared microscopy and micro particle image velocimetry.

This is particularly an issue for coherent short wavelength sources, where the beam intensity is usually tightly focused on the sample in order to maximize the photon flux density on the illuminated region of the sample and thus a small change in the beam position results in a significant change in illumination of the sample. We present an improved ptychographic method that allows for limited stability of the illumination wavefront and thus significantly improve the reconstruction quality without additional prior knowledge. We have tested our reconstruction method in a proof of concept experiment, where the beam instability of a visible light source was emulated using a piezo driven mirror, and also in a short wavelength microscopy CDI setup using a high harmonic generation source in the extreme ultraviolet range.

By considering both lead-free ferroelectrics of potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, KNN) and aqueous-based electrophoretic deposition here we demonstrate that an eco-friendly aqueous solution-based process can be used to produce KNN thick coatings with improved electromechanical performance.

Electrodes composed of Si-PAA, Si-CMC, and Si-PAA-CMC exhibit a specific capacity \u22653000 mAh/g after 20 cycles while Si-PVdF electrodes have a rapid capacity fade to 1000 mAh/g after just 10 cycles. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal that PAA and CMC react with the surface of the Si nanoparticles during electrode fabrication. The fresh Si-CMC electrode has a thicker surface coating of SiOx than Si-PAA and Si-PAA-CMC electrodes, due to the formation of thicker SiOx during electrode preparation, which leads to lower cyclability. The carboxylic acid functional groups of the PAA binder are reactive toward the electrolyte, causing the decomposition of LiPF6 and dissolution of SiOx during the electrode wetting process. The PAA and CMC binder surface films are then electrochemically reduced during the first cycle to form a protective layer on Si. This layer effectively suppresses the decomposition of carbonate solvents during cycling resulting in a thin SEI. On the contrary, the Si-PVDF electrode has poor cycling performance and continuous reduction of carbonate solvents is observed resulting in the generation of a thicker SEI.

{"title": "Intracerebroventricular injections of dronabinol, a cannabinoid receptor agonist, does not attenuate serotonin-induced apnea in Sprague-Dawley rats.", "abstract": "Evidence suggests that vagal nerve activity may play a role in sleep apnea induction. In anesthetized rats, dronabinol, a cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonist, injected into the nodose ganglia attenuates reflex apnea and increases genioglossus activity, and reflex apnea attenuation is blocked by systemic pre-treatment with cannabinoid type 1 and/or type 2 receptor antagonists. However, it is unclear whether dronabinol has similar effects in the central nervous system; CB receptors are widely distributed in the brain, especially on neuronal circuitry important for respiration and upper airway activation. Here, we examine the effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of dronabinol on serotonin (5-HT)-induced apnea.\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and instrumented with bilateral electrodes to monitor genioglossi EMG and with a piezoelectric strain gauge to monitor respiratory pattern. Serotonin was intravenously infused into a femoral vein to induce reflex apnea. After baseline recordings, rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A unilateral osteotomy was made to allow access for injection to the right lateral ventricle, and the dura were carefully removed. Dronabinol (100, 10, 1, or 0.1 \u03bcg/3 \u03bcl DMSO) or control (3 \u03bcl DMSO) was injected into the right lateral ventricle and 5-HT infusion was repeated. Data (mean \u00b1 SEM) were analyzed using a mixed model analysis with a repeated/fixed measure.\nThere was no main effect in 5-HT-induced apnea or breath duration, or in breath instability, between ICV dronabinol injected and ICV vehicle control injected groups. Moreover, there was no main effect in phasic or tonic genioglossus activity between ICV dronabinol injected and ICV vehicle control injected groups.\nOur data show that ICV injection of dronabinol did not decrease 5-HT-induced apneas, and did not increase genioglossus activity. This in contrast to published results of dronabinol's effect on apnea via the vagus nerve.

A PVDF sensor typically covers an area of the host structure over which mechanical stress/strain is averaged and converted to electrical energy. This study investigates the fundamental \"stress-averaging\" mechanism for dynamic strain sensing in the in-plane mode. A numerical simulation was conducted to simulate the \"stress-averaging\" mechanism of a PVDF sensor attached on a cantilever beam subjected to an impact loading, taking into account the contribution of piezoelectricity, the cantilever beam's modal properties, and electronic signal conditioning. Impact tests and FEM analysis were also carried out to verify the numerical simulation results. The results of impact tests indicate the excellent capability of the attached PVDF sensor in capturing the fundamental natural frequencies of the cantilever beam. There is a good agreement between the PVDF sensor's output voltage predicted by the numerical simulation and that obtained in the impact tests. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effects of sensor size and sensor position and it is shown that a larger sensor tends to generate higher output voltage than a smaller one at the same location.

Each group contained 20 specimens. Three rotating instruments were used to remove the CEPs: a piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler, a periodontal bur, and a diamond bur. Tooth surface characteristics before and after removal of the projections were then evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We analyzed the characteristics of the tooth surfaces with respect to roughness and whether the enamel projections had been completely removed.\nIn SEM images, surfaces treated with the diamond bur were smoothest, but this instrument caused considerable harm to tooth structures near the CEPs. The piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler group produced the roughest surface but caused less harm to the tooth structure near the furcation. In general, the surfaces treated with the periodontal bur were smoother than those treated with the ultrasonic scaler, and the periodontal bur did not invade adjacent tooth structures.\nFor removal of grade II CEPs, the most effective instrument was the diamond bur. However, in removing grade III projections, the diamond bur can destroy both adjacent tooth structures and the periodontal apparatus. In such cases, careful use of the periodontal bur may be an appropriate substitute.", "journal": "Journal of periodontal & implant science", "date": "2016-04-30", "authors": ["Min-JeongKo", "Chan-MyungCho", "Seong-NyumJeong"], "doi": "10.5051/jpis.2016.46.2.107"}

A serially connected valveless piezoelectric micropump was fabricated inspired by the liquid-feeding strategy of a female mosquito drinking liquid with a wide range of viscosities, from nectar to blood. The performance of the micropump was investigated by varying the viscosity of working liquid. Results showed that the optimal phase difference between the two chambers was 180\u00b0 out-of-phase for all viscosity conditions. The two chambers operating at 180\u00b0 out-of-phase exhibited higher pumping performance compared with the sum of each single chamber solely actuated, when viscosity increased. The flow patterns in the micropump showed that the rectification efficiency improved with the increase in viscosity. Results indicated that the serially connected valveless piezoelectric micropump is more robust to the increase of viscosity than a single-chamber piezoelectric micropump.

{"title": "Optimal working frequency of ultrasonic motors.", "abstract": "In this work, the existence of the optimal working frequency for ultrasonic motors (USMs) is theoretically and experimentally verified for the first time, at which working point the power dissipation of the motors arrives at its minimum value. The mathematical model of the mechanical quality factor is initially deduced to evaluate the loss level, because it shows an opposite tendency with losses. The derivative of the mechanical quality factor can be subsequently arrived at with the aid of the phenomenon model of the phase of the admittance. The theoretical derivation infers that the maximum value of the mechanical quality factor exists almost around the average value of the frequency of maximum conductance and the frequency of maximum resistance. Then the input power of the USM is measured under the constant velocity condition, which is supposed to counteract the loss; that is, the loss can be therefore evaluated experimentally. Measurements infer that the power dissipation of the motor reaches the minimum value around the calculated optimal working frequency. In other word, it is proven that the USM maintains an optimal working frequency from the loss reduction view point.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-04-30", "authors": ["WeijiaShi", "HuiZhao", "JieMa", "YuYao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.04.015"}

The effect of the addition of BZT on the phase transition characteristics and associated electromechanical properties of BNT-BT was systematically discussed and a schematic phase diagram was established. The addition of BZT had a strong impact on the phase transition as well as the strain and piezoelectric activity. The phase coexistence, which involves ferroelectric rhombohedral-relaxor pseudocubic phases, can be driven by modification with BZT and increases in temperature and can be confirmed by XRD measurements, analysis of Raman spectra and temperature-dependent changes in polarization and strain hysteresis loops. Accompanied by a shift in the ferroelectric-to-relaxor temperature TF-R to below room temperature on the addition of BZT, a compositionally induced ferroelectric-to-relaxor phase transition occurred, which gave rise to a large strain of 0.33% with a normalized strain Smax/Emax of 550 pm V(-1) at the critical BZT content x of 0.0275. The results were closely correlated with the composition and dependence on temperature of the phase transition, which significantly influenced the electromechanical properties, and the origin of the large strain observed in the present system was also addressed in detail.

Inherent nonlinearity of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs), especially during large-signal operation, renders these methods inapplicable. In this paper, we present different pulse sequences for nonlinear imaging that are valid for small- and large-signal CMUT operations. For small-signal operation, two-pulse amplitude and phase modulation methods for microbubble and tissue harmonic imaging are presented, where CMUT nonlinearity is compensated via subharmonic excitation. In the large-signal regime, using a nonlinear model, we first show that there is a simple linear relationship between the phases of each harmonic distortion component generated and the input drive signal. Based on this observation, we demonstrate a pulse sequence using N+1 consecutive phase modulated transmit events to extract N harmonics of the nonlinear contrast agent echo content uncorrupted by CMUT nonlinearity. The proposed methods assume no apriori information about the transducer and, therefore, are applicable to any CMUT. The phase modulation method is also valid for piezoelectric transducers and systems with nonlinearities described by Taylor series where the same phase relationship between the input signal and the harmonic content is valid. The proof of principle experiments using a commercial contrast agent validates the phase modulated pulse sequences for CMUTs, operating in a highly nonlinear collapse-snapback mode and for piezoelectric transducers.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2016-04-27", "authors": ["SarpSatir", "F LeventDegertekin"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2557621"}

However, it does not show competitive strength for enabling self-powered implantable biomedical devices due to two issues - large size of bulk piezoelectric ultrasound transducers and output power fluctuation with transferred distance due to standing wave. Here we report a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based broadband piezoelectric ultrasonic energy harvester (PUEH) to enable self-powered implantable biomedical devices. The PUEH is a microfabricated lead zirconate titanate (PZT) diaphragm array and has wide operation bandwidth. By adjusting frequency of the input ultrasound wave within the operation bandwidth, standing wave effect can be minimized for any given distances. For example, at 1\u2009cm distance, power density can be increased from 0.59\u2009\u03bcW/cm(2) to 3.75\u2009\u03bcW/cm(2) at input ultrasound intensity of 1\u2009mW/cm(2) when frequency changes from 250 to 240\u2009kHz. Due to the difference of human body and manual surgical process, distance fluctuation for implantable biomedical devices is unavoidable and it strongly affects the coupling efficiency.

This paper aims to analyze the signals obtained by two kinds of commercial piezoelectric pressure probes, and reconstruct the correct pressure waveform from the distorted one measured by the pressure probes. It is found that both PCB138 and M\u00fcller-plate probes can be used to measure the relative SW pressure value because of their good uniformities and linearities, but none of them can obtain precise SW waveforms. In order to approach to the real SW signal better, we propose a new multi-exponential pressure waveform model, which has considered the faster pressure decay at the early stage and the slower pressure decay in longer times. Based on this model and the energy conservation law, the pressure waveform obtained by the PCB138 probe has been reconstructed, and the reconstruction accuracy has been verified by the signals obtained by the M\u00fcller-plate probe.

One of the most known conditions of infertility in males is azoospermia, defined as complete absence of spermatozoa in the semen. Azoospermia manifests in two forms, namely obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia. Although the presence of antisperm antibody (ASA) has been reported in 88% of the patients with obstructive azoospermia (OA), interestingly, there is no data regarding ASA targets in OA individuals.\nThe present study aimed to identify sperm antibody targets in a group of OA men.\nThe present study was carried out on 27 OA infertile men and 27 healthy fertile age-matched males as cases and controls, respectively.\nThe sperm proteome was separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technique, transferred onto the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and blotted with the sera of a group of OA men. Then, it was compared with the membranes blotted with the sera of a group of healthy fertile men. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry was used to identify the different blotted spots and finally the results of the mass analysis were confirmed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method.\nThe results indicated that OA patients might produce antibody against two sperm proteins, Tektin-2 and triose phosphate isomerase.

{"title": "Characterization of steady streaming for a particle manipulation system.", "abstract": "Accurate positioning of biological cells or microscopic particle without directly contacting them is a challenging task in biomedical engineering. Various trapping methods for controlling the position of a particle have been suggested. The common driving methods are based on laser and ultrasonic actuation principles. In this work we suggest a design for a hydrodynamic particle manoeuvring system. The system operates using steady streaming in a viscous fluid media induced by high frequency vibration of piezoelectric cantilevers. A particle within the workspace of the system can be trapped and manipulated to a desired position by the fairly unidirectional flow field created by the beams. In this paper, the flow field in the particle manipulation system is characterized numerically and experimentally. We find that the flow field resembles the analytical solutions of a flow field created by an oscillating sphere. Furthermore, we validate numerically the quadratic relation between the steady streaming velocity and the vibration amplitude of the beam. The calibration of the piezoelectric actuator's oscillation amplitudes enables effective positioning of particles with a diameter of 20 um to 1 mm. We find that a 30X0.8X2 mm(3) piezoelectric beam vibrating at its first resonance frequency, 200 Hz, is able to move a particle at a typical flow velocity ranging between 0.05 mm/sec and 0.13 mm/s in 430 cSt Si oil (Re=0.2).", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2016-04-25", "authors": ["RoniAmit", "AviAbadi", "GaborKosa"], "doi": "10.1007/s10544-016-0055-1"}
{"title": "Minimization of short-term low-pressure membrane fouling using a magnetic ion exchange (MIEX(\u00ae)) resin.", "abstract": "Two challenges to low-pressure membrane (LPM) filtration are limited rejection of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and membrane fouling by DOM. The magnetic ion exchange resin MIEX(\u00ae) (Ixom Watercare Inc.) has been demonstrated to remove substantial amounts of DOM from many source waters, suggesting that MIEX can both reduce DOM content in membrane feed waters and minimize LPM fouling. We tested the effect of MIEX pretreatment on the reduction of short-term LPM fouling potential using feed waters varying in DOM concentration and composition. Four natural and two synthetic waters were studied and a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow-fiber ultrafiltration membrane was used in membrane fouling tests. To evaluate whether MIEX removes the fractions of DOM that cause LPM fouling, the DOM in raw, MIEX-treated, and membrane feed and backwash waters was characterized in terms of DOM concentration and composition. Results showed that: (i) the efficacy of MIEX to reduce LPM fouling varies broadly with source water; (ii) MIEX preferentially removes terrestrial DOM over microbial DOM; (iii) microbial DOM is a more important contributor to LPM fouling than terrestrial DOM, relative to their respective concentrations in source waters; and (iv) the fluorescence intensity of microbial DOM in source waters can be used as a quantitative indicator of the ability of MIEX to reduce their membrane fouling potential. Thus, when ion exchange resin processes are used for DOM removal towards membrane fouling reduction, it is advisable to use a resin that has been designed to effectively remove microbial DOM.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2016-04-24", "authors": ["PanitanJutaporn", "Philip CSinger", "Rose MCory", "OrlandoCoronell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2016.04.007"}

For the traditional contact-killing strategy, the antibacterial action is restricted to the surface: the membrane loses its antibiofouling efficacy once its surface is completely covered with a fouling layer. However, in this study, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microfiltration membranes blended with quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) exhibited a surprisingly lasting antimicrobial activity in the vicinity of the membrane surface. The results indicated that QAC was capable of driving surface segregation with a high structural stability, and the QAC modified membrane shows clear antibacterial effects against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Covering the modified membrane surface by an abiotic alginate layer resulted in a loss of antibacterial efficiency by 86.2%. In contrast, the antibacterial efficiency was maintained after developing a biofilm of Staphylococcus aureus of 30 \u03bcm in thickness. The current study may suggest that bacteria affected by contact-killing might interact with other bacteria in the vicinity, resulting in retarded biofilm growth.

In this paper, a novel structure is proposed by forming an embossed vibrating membrane on a CMUT cell operating in the collapse mode to increase the maximum output pressure. By using a beam model in undamped conditions and finite-element analysis simulations, the proposed embossed structure showed improvement on the maximum output pressure of the CMUT cell when the embossed pattern was placed on the estimated location of the peak deflection. As compared with a uniform membrane CMUT cell worked in the collapse mode, the proposed CMUT cell can yield the maximum output pressure by 51.1% and 88.1% enhancement with a single embossed pattern made of Si3N4 and nickel, respectively.

Since its prediction and discovery almost a decade ago, such a symmetry-protected topological phase has been explored beyond electronic systems in the realm of photonics. Electrons are spin-1/2 particles, whereas photons are spin-1 particles. The distinct spin difference between these two kinds of particles means that their corresponding symmetry is fundamentally different. It is well understood that an electronic topological insulator is protected by the electron's spin-1/2 (fermionic) time-reversal symmetry [Formula: see text] However, the same protection does not exist under normal circumstances for a photonic topological insulator, due to photon's spin-1 (bosonic) time-reversal symmetry [Formula: see text] In this work, we report a design of photonic topological insulator using the Tellegen magnetoelectric coupling as the photonic pseudospin orbit interaction for left and right circularly polarized helical spin states. The Tellegen magnetoelectric coupling breaks bosonic time-reversal symmetry but instead gives rise to a conserved artificial fermionic-like-pseudo time-reversal symmetry, Tp ([Formula: see text]), due to the electromagnetic duality. Surprisingly, we find that, in this system, the helical edge states are, in fact, protected by this fermionic-like pseudo time-reversal symmetry Tp rather than by the bosonic time-reversal symmetry Tb This remarkable finding is expected to pave a new path to understanding the symmetry protection mechanism for topological phases of other fundamental particles and to searching for novel implementations for topological insulators.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2016-04-20", "authors": ["ChengHe", "Xiao-ChenSun", "Xiao-PingLiu", "Ming-HuiLu", "YulinChen", "LiangFeng", "Yan-FengChen"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1525502113"}

{"title": "Lateral Tip Control Effects in CD-AFM Metrology: The Large Tip Limit.", "abstract": "Sidewall sensing in critical dimension atomic force microscopes (CD-AFMs) usually involves continuous lateral dithering of the tip or the use of a control algorithm and fast response piezo actuator to position the tip in a manner that resembles touch-triggering of coordinate measuring machine (CMM) probes. All methods of tip position control, however, induce an effective tip width that may deviate from the actual geometrical tip width. Understanding the influence and dependence of the effective tip width on the dither settings and lateral stiffness of the tip can improve the measurement accuracy and uncertainty estimation for CD-AFM measurements. Since CD-AFM typically uses tips that range from 15 nm to 850 nm in geometrical width, the behavior of effective tip width throughout this range should be understood. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been investigating the dependence of effective tip width on the dither settings and lateral stiffness of the tip, as well as the possibility of material effects due to sample composition. For tip widths of 130 nm and lower, which also have lower lateral stiffness, the response of the effective tip width to lateral dither is greater than for larger tips. However, we have concluded that these effects will not generally result in a residual bias, provided that the tip calibration and sample measurement are performed under the same conditions. To validate that our prior conclusions about the dependence of effective tip width on lateral stiffness are valid for large CD-tips, we recently performed experiments using a very large non-CD tip with an etched plateau of approximately 2 \u03bcm width. The effective lateral stiffness of these tips is at least 20 times greater than typical CD-AFM tips, and these results supported our prior conclusions about the expected behavior for larger tips. The bottom-line importance of these latest observations is that we can now reasonably conclude that a dither slope of 3 nm/V is the baseline response due to the induced motion of the cantilever base.", "journal": "Journal of micro/nanolithography, MEMS, and MOEMS : JM3", "date": "2016-04-19", "authors": ["Ronald GDixson", "Ndubuisi GOrji", "Ryan SGoldband"], "doi": null}

COL2 was shown to have a greater transcriptional tendency to PEMF, whereas under defined electromagnetic parameters applied in this study, no significant difference was detected in SOX9 gene expressions compared to the control group.

Such differences have been attributed to numerous factors, including stent design, injury created by the catheter delivery system, coating application technologies, and the degree of thrombogenicity of the polymer.

This work focuses on understanding the thrombogenicity of the polymer by examining mechanistic interactions with proteins, human platelets, and human monocytes of a number of polymers used in drug eluting stent coatings, in vitro. The importance for blood interactions of adsorbed albumin and the retention of albumin was suggested by the data. Microscopic imaging and immunostaining enhanced the interpretation of results from the lactate dehydrogenase cell counting assay and provided insight into platelet interactions, total quantification, and morphometry. In particular, highly spread platelets may be surface-passivating, possibly inhibiting ongoing thrombotic events.

The injection space is formed by the crossing of four channels in a plexiglass cross-piece. The capillaries pass through two opposing channels and their injection ends are located opposite one another at a distance of approx. 0.5mm in the centre of the crossing point. The exit ends of the capillaries are placed in vessels containing the background electrolyte in which are immersed the electrodes of a high-voltage source. Contactless conductivity detectors with semi-cylindrical electrodes are located 2cm from the exit ends of the capillaries. The injection part of the apparatus consists of two piezoelectric micro-pumps bringing the solution through another channel in the cross-piece to the injection ends of the capillary. During the injection, the sample is brought through one of them and is injected electrokinetically for a defined time. Then the sample zone is forced out of the injection space by a stream of background electrolyte from the second micro-pump. The timing of the injection process is computer-controlled.

As a result, a large increase in E b of 873 MV m(-1) and U e of 24.9 J cm(-3) is achieved. Subsequently, the PCN films possess more than 60% charge-discharge efficiency even at higher electric field and thus provide a scope to develop high energy density flexible and transparent materials for energy storage technologies.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2016-04-16", "authors": ["Sujoy KumarGhosh", "WahidaRahman", "Tapas RanjanMiddya", "ShrabaneeSen", "DipankarMandal"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/27/21/215401"}
{"title": "Third generation poly(hydroxyacid) composite scaffolds for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Bone tissue engineering based on scaffolds is quite a complex process as a whole gamut of criteria needs to be satisfied to promote cellular attachment, proliferation and differentiation: biocompatibility, right surface properties, adequate mechanical performance, controlled bioresorbability, osteoconductivity, angiogenic cues, and vascularization. Third generation scaffolds are more of composite types to maximize biological-mechanical-chemical properties. In the present review, our focus is on the performance of micro-organism-derived polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)-polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV)-composite scaffolds with ceramics and natural polymers for tissue engineering applications with emphasis on bone tissue. We particularly emphasize on how material properties of the composites affect scaffold performance. PHA-based composites have demonstrated their biocompatibility with a range of tissues and their capacity to induce osteogenesis due to their piezoelectric properties. Electrospun PHB/PHBV fiber mesh in combination with human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs) were shown to improve vascularization in engineered bone tissues. For nerve and skin tissue engineering applications, natural polymers such as collagen and chitosan remain the gold standard but there is scope for development of scaffolds combining PHAs with other natural polymers which can address some of the limitations such as brittleness, lack of bioactivity and slow degradation rate presented by the latter. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This relaxation was absent on Triton-X-shells, while on erythrocytes and EMs it was inhibited by selective dissociation of either attachment sites between spectrin and bilayer.

{"title": "A wearable sensor system for medication adherence prediction.", "abstract": "Studies have revealed that non-adherence to prescribed medication can lead to hospital readmissions, clinical complications, and other negative patient outcomes. Though many techniques have been proposed to improve patient adherence rates, they suffer from low accuracy. Our objective is to develop and test a novel system for assessment of medication adherence.\nRecently, several smart pill bottle technologies have been proposed, which can detect when the bottle has been opened, and even when a pill has been retrieved. However, very few systems can determine if the pill is subsequently ingested or discarded. We propose a system for detecting user adherence to medication using a smart necklace, capable of determining if the medication has been ingested based on the skin movement in the lower part of the neck during a swallow. This, coupled with existing medication adherence systems that detect when medicine is removed from the bottle, can detect a broader range of use-cases with respect to medication adherence.\nUsing Bayesian networks, we were able to correctly classify between chewable vitamins, saliva swallows, medication capsules, speaking, and drinking water, with average precision and recall of 90.17% and 88.9%, respectively. A total of 135 instances were classified from a total of 20 subjects.\nOur experimental evaluations confirm the accuracy of the piezoelectric necklace for detecting medicine swallows and disambiguating them from related actions.

{"title": "Development of Omniphobic Desalination Membranes Using a Charged Electrospun Nanofiber Scaffold.", "abstract": "In this study, we present a facile and scalable approach to fabricate omniphobic nanofiber membranes by constructing multilevel re-entrant structures with low surface energy. We first prepared positively charged nanofiber mats by electrospinning a blend polymer-surfactant solution of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and cationic surfactant (benzyltriethylammonium). Negatively charged silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were grafted on the positively charged electrospun nanofibers via dip-coating to achieve multilevel re-entrant structures. Grafted SiNPs were then coated with fluoroalkylsilane to lower the surface energy of the membrane. The fabricated membrane showed excellent omniphobicity, as demonstrated by its wetting resistance to various low surface tension liquids, including ethanol with a surface tension of 22.1 mN/m. As a promising application, the prepared omniphobic membrane was tested in direct contact membrane distillation to extract water from highly saline feed solutions containing low surface tension substances, mimicking emerging industrial wastewaters (e.g., from shale gas production). While a control hydrophobic PVDF-HFP nanofiber membrane failed in the desalination/separation process due to low wetting resistance, our fabricated omniphobic membrane exhibited a stable desalination performance for 8 h of operation, successfully demonstrating clean water production from the low surface tension feedwater.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-04-12", "authors": ["JonghoLee", "ChanheeBoo", "Won-HeeRyu", "Andr\u00e9 DTaylor", "MenachemElimelech"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b02419"}

{"title": "Polymeric Biomaterials for Medical Implants and Devices.", "abstract": "In this review article, we focus on the various types of materials used in biomedical implantable devices, including the polymeric materials used as substrates and for the packaging of such devices. Polymeric materials are used because of the ease of fabrication, flexibility, and their biocompatible nature as well as their wide range of mechanical, electrical, chemical, and thermal behaviors when combined with different materials as composites. Biocompatible and biostable polymers are extensively used to package implanted devices, with the main criteria that include gas permeability and water permeability of the packaging polymer to protect the electronic circuit of the device from moisture and ions inside the human body. Polymeric materials must also have considerable tensile strength and should be able to contain the device over the envisioned lifetime of the implant. For substrates, structural properties and, at times, electrical properties would be of greater concern. Section 1 gives an introduction of some medical devices and implants along with the material requirements and properties needed. Different synthetic polymeric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride, polyethylene, polypropylene, polydimethylsiloxane, parylene, polyamide, polytetrafluoroethylene, poly(methyl methacrylate), polyimide, and polyurethane have been examined, and liquid crystalline polymers and nanocomposites have been evaluated as biomaterials that are suitable for biomedical packaging (section 2).

In order to give new insights into the mechanism of doping, the microscopic origin of the Fano resonance induced by the local structure was investigated in 5%Li-doped KTN single crystals by Raman scattering. The coupling between the continuum states and the transverse optical phonon near 196 cm(-1) (Slater mode) caused a Fano resonance. In the vicinity of the cubic-tetragonal phase transition temperature, TC-T = 31\u2009\u00b0C, the almost disappearance of the Fano resonance and the remarkable change of the central peak (CP) intensity were observed upon heating. The local symmetry of the polar nanoregions (PNRs), which was responsible for the symmetry breaking in the cubic phase, was determined to E(x, y) symmetry by the angular dependence of Raman scattering. The electric field induced the significant change in the intensity of both CP and Fano resonance.

Herein, we designed, synthesized, and characterized alternate copolymers of p(MAO-DMEA) (obtained by reaction between poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) and N,N-dimethylenediamine) and p(MAO-DMPA) (obtained by reaction between poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) and 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine) of different carbon space length (CSL) using a ring-opening zwitterionization. We coated these copolymers on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes using a self-assembled anchoring method. Two important design parameters-the CSL of polymers and the coating density of polymers on membrane-were extensively examined for their effects on the antifouling performance of the modified membranes using a series of protein, cell, and bacterial assays. Both zwitterionic-modified membranes with different coating densities showed improved membrane hydrophilicity, increased resistance to protein, bacteria, blood cells, and platelet adsorption. However, while p(MAO-DMEA) with two CSLs and p(MAO-DMPA) with three CSLs only differ by one single carbon between the amino and ammonium groups, such subtle structural difference between the two polymers led to the fact that the membranes self-assembled with MAO-DMEA outperformed those modified with MAO-DMPA in all aspects of surface hydration, protein and bacteria resistance, and blood biocompatibility. This work provides an important structural-based design principle: a subtle change in the CSL of polymers affects the surface and antifouling properties of the membranes. It can help to achieve the design of more effective antifouling membranes for blood contacting applications.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2016-04-06", "authors": ["AntoineVenault", "Wen-YuHuang", "Sheng-WenHsiao", "ArunachalamChinnathambi", "Sulaiman AliAlharbi", "HongChen", "JieZheng", "YungChang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00981"}
{"title": "Improving acoustic streaming effects in fluidic systems by matching SU-8 and polydimethylsiloxane layers.", "abstract": "This paper reports the use of acoustic waves for promoting and improving streaming in tridimensional polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cuvettes of 15mm width\u00d714mm height\u00d72.5mm thickness. The acoustic waves are generated by a 28\u03bcm thick poly(vinylidene fluoride) - PVDF - piezoelectric transducer in its \u03b2 phase, actuated at its resonance frequency: 40MHz. The acoustic transmission properties of two materials - SU-8 and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) - were numerically compared. It was concluded that PDMS inhibits, while SU-8 allows, the transmission of the acoustic waves to the propagation medium. Therefore, by simulating the acoustic transmission properties of different materials, it is possible to preview the acoustic behavior in the fluidic system, which allows the optimization of the best layout design, saving costs and time. This work also presents a comparison between numerical and experimental results of acoustic streaming obtained with that \u03b2-PVDF transducer in the movement and in the formation of fluid recirculation in tridimensional closed domains. Differences between the numerical and experimental results are credited to the high sensitivity of acoustic streaming to the experimental conditions and to limitations of the numerical method. The reported study contributes for the improvement of simulation models that can be extremely useful for predicting the acoustic effects of new materials in fluidic devices, as well as for optimizing the transducers and matching layers positioning in a fluidic structure.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-04-05", "authors": ["S OCatarino", "GMinas", "J MMiranda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.03.010"}

{"title": "Fully implantable hearing aid in the incudostapedial joint gap.", "abstract": "A fully implantable hearing aid is introduced which is a combined sensor-actuator-transducer designed for insertion into the incudostapedial joint gap (ISJ). The active elements each consist of a thin titanium membrane with an applied piezoelectric single crystal. The effectiveness of the operating principle is verified in a temporal bone study. We also take a closer look at the influence of an implantation-induced increase in middle ear stiffness on the transducer's output. An assembly of the transducer with 1\u00a0mm thickness is built and inserted into six temporal bones. At this thickness, the stiffness of the annular ligament is considerably increased, which leads to a loss in functional gain for the transducer. It is assumed that a thinner transducer would reduce this effect. In order to examine the performance for a prospective reduced pretension, we increased the gap size at the ISJ by 0.5\u00a0mm by removing the capitulum of the stapes in four temporal bones. The TM is stimulated with a broadband multisine sound signal in the audiological frequency range. The movement of the stapes footplate is measured with a laser Doppler vibrometer. The sensor signal is digitally processed and the amplified signal drives the actuator. The resulting feedback is minimized by an active noise control least mean square (LMS) algorithm which is implemented on a field programmable gate array. The dynamic range and the functional gain of the transducer in the temporal bones are determined. The results are compared to measurements from temporal bones without ISJ extension and to the results of Finite Elements Model (FE model) simulations. In the frequency range above 2\u00a0kHz a functional gain of 30\u00a0dB and more is achieved. This proposes the transducer as a potential treatment for high frequency hearing loss, e.g. for patients with noise-induced hearing loss. The transducer offers sufficient results for a comprehensive application. Adaptations in the transducer design or surgical approach are necessary to cope with ligament stiffening issues. These cause insufficient performance for low frequencies under 1\u00a0kHz.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2016-04-05", "authors": ["MartinKoch", "Till MoritzE\u00dfinger", "ThomasStoppe", "NikolozLasurashvili", "MatthiasBornitz", "ThomasZahnert"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2016.03.015"}

In this Review, we present a comprehensive review of the use of ferroelectric polymers, especially PVDF and PVDF-based copolymers/blends as potential components in dielectric nanocomposite materials for high energy density capacitor applications. Various parameters like dielectric constant, dielectric loss, breakdown strength, energy density, and flexibility of the polymer nanocomposites have been thoroughly investigated. Fillers with different shapes have been found to cause significant variation in the physical and electrical properties. Generally, one-dimensional and two-dimensional nanofillers with large aspect ratios provide enhanced flexibility versus zero-dimensional fillers. Surface modification of nanomaterials as well as polymers adds flavor to the dielectric properties of the resulting nanocomposites. Nowadays, three-phase nanocomposites with either combination of fillers or polymer matrix help in further improving the dielectric properties as compared to two-phase nanocomposites.

The effectiveness of this rate-independent modified P-I model is demonstrated by comparing simulation results of the developed model and the classic Prandtl-Ishlinskii model. Simulation results suggest that the rate-independent modified P-I model can describe hysteresis more precisely. Compared with the classical P-I model, the rate-independent modified P-I model reduces modeling error by more than 50%.

At characteristic frequencies that depend on the geometry of the device, it is possible to induce the formation of standing waves that can focus particles along desired fluidic streamlines within a bulk flow.

With inadequate needle visibility, these procedures may result in serious complications or a failed operation. This paper reports analysis of the modal behaviour of a previously proposed ultrasound-actuated needle configuration, which may overcome this problem by improving needle visibility in colour Doppler imaging. It uses a piezoelectric transducer to actuate longitudinal resonant modes in needles (outer diameter 0.8-1.2mm, length>65mm). The factors that affect the needle's vibration mode are identified, including the needle length, the transducer's resonance frequency and the gripping position. Their effects are investigated using finite element modelling, with the conclusions validated experimentally. The actuated needle was inserted into porcine tissue up to 30mm depth and its visibility was observed under colour Doppler imaging. The piezoelectric transducer is able to generate longitudinal vibration with peak-to-peak amplitude up to 4\u03bcm at the needle tip with an actuating voltage of 20Vpp. Actuated in longitudinal vibration modes (distal mode at 27.6kHz and transducer mode at 42.2kHz) with a drive amplitude of 12-14Vpp, a 120mm needle is delineated as a coloured line in colour Doppler images, with both needle tip and shaft visualised. The improved needle visibility is maintained while the needle is advanced into the tissue, thus allowing tracking of the needle position in real time. Moreover, the needle tip is highlighted by strong coloured artefacts around the actuated needle generated by its flexural vibration. A limitation of the technique is that the transducer mode requires needles of specific lengths so that the needle's resonance frequency matches the transducer.

In view of smaller deformation of PZT stack, a new structure is designed for actuation unit, which integrates the advantages of two modes (namely, diaphragm type and piston type) of the volume changing of pump chamber. In order to improve the static shear yield strength of ERFs, a composite ERFs valve is designed, which adopts the series-parallel plate compound structure. The prototype of the inchworm actuator has been designed and manufactured in the lab. Systematic test results indicate that the displacement resolution of the unconventional inchworm actuator reaches 0.038\u2009\u03bcm, and the maximum driving force and velocity are 42\u2009N, 14.8\u2009mm/s, respectively. The optimal working frequency for the maximum driving velocity is 120\u2009Hz.

{"title": "Nanoscale Manipulators: Review of Conceptual Designs Through Recent Patents.", "abstract": "Nanomanipulation techniques have gone through several phases to be used in scientific explorations not only to reveal more characteristics of nano, micro and mesoscopic phenomena but also to build functional nano-devices useful for specific applications. The nano-manipulator becomes a key instrument for technology bridging between sub-nano and mesoscale. The recent patents have exhibited integration of various functions in the nano-devices requiring sub-nanometer precision and highly stable manipulator with substantial pulling/pushing forces. This work reviews patents and works on conceptual designs of existing nanomanipulators with specific features. This includes design analysis leading to ultra-precision motion and stability with discussion of enabling technology. A novel integrated and numerically controlled instrument for nanomanipulation, visualization and inspection/characterization of materials at sub-nanoscale will be presented with a feature to keep the same datum for all operation and hence improve accuracy of samples.\nThis paper has undertaken a review search in a structured examination of bibliographic databases for published and issued patents using a focused review keyword of nano-manipulation. The quality of selected patents was appraised using standard tools. The characteristics of screened patents were described, and a deductive qualitative content analysis methodology was applied to understand the modeling and testing of nanomachining process, the exact construction of nanostructure arrays and the inspection of devices with complex features.\nThe paper encompassed forty patents. Fourteen patents exhibited the manipulation at the micro scale (MEMS manipulations), others outlined systems with sub-micron resolution and workspace range in mesoscale. Standard scale manipulation were described in 13 patents assuming only systems comprising positioning stages, arms and end-effectors where positioners are a few centimeters in size with workspace higher than one cm3. Finally, ten patents included in this review described the importance of end-effectors being extremely important in nanomanipulation as they do support the function defining the manipulation e.g. grippers, sprayers, Nano-tweezers.\nThe findings of this patents review confirm the relevance of the nanomanipulation of objects in 3D system coupled with real time imaging having higher resolution in comparison with the standard manipulators including AFM, TEM, STM, SEM or NSOM. In terms of tooling, AFM cantilever tips, etched tungsten tips or tips with electron beam deposition can be used to manufacture or develop nanodevices e.g. nanowires in in-situ SEM. In handling and manipulating in ambient conditions, commercial microfabricated grippers although available, are less used compared to CNT nanotweezers. Nanomanipulation is currently enabled for nanoscale samples by on-chip operations using promising MEMS and NEMS devices to relatively large samples by the meso and standard scale nanomanipulators. Manipulation is comprehensive and requires multiple functions enabled by various types of end-effectors and probes actuated with high precision. Piezo actuators are at the moment of great performance.

Here, we propose a new defect engineering route to the excellent piezoelectric properties, in which doped smaller acceptor and donor ions substituting bivalent A-sites are utilized to bring local lattice distortion and lower symmetry. A concrete paradigm is presented, (Li-Al) codoped BaTiO3 perovskite, that exhibits a largely thermo-stable piezoelectric constant (>300 pC/N) and huge mechanical quality factor (>2000). A systematic analysis including theoretical analysis and simulation results indicates that the Li(+) and Al(3+) ions are inclined to occupy the neighboring A-sites in the lattice and constitute a defect dipole (ionic pairs). The defect dipoles possess a kind of dipole moment which tends to align directionally after thermo-electric treatment. A mechanism related to the defect symmetry principle, phase transition, and defect migration is proposed to explain the outstanding piezoelectric properties.

We propose a multimodal sensing (i.e., contact based and airborne measurement of joint acoustic emission) system for at-home monitoring.\nWe used three types of microphones-electret, MEMS, and piezoelectric film microphones-to obtain joint sounds in healthy collegiate athletes during unloaded flexion/extension, and we evaluated the robustness of each microphone's measurements via: 1) signal quality and 2) within-day consistency.\nFirst, air microphones acquired higher quality signals than contact microphones (signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio of 11.7 and 12.4\u00a0dB for electret and MEMS, respectively, versus 8.4\u00a0dB for piezoelectric). Furthermore, air microphones measured similar acoustic signatures on the skin and 5\u00a0cm off the skin (\u223c4.5\u00d7 smaller amplitude). Second, the main acoustic event during repetitive motions occurred at consistent joint angles (intra-class correlation coefficient ICC(1, 1) = 0.94 and ICC(1, k) = 0.99). Additionally, we found that this angular location was similar between right and left legs, with asymmetry observed in only a few individuals.\nWe recommend using air microphones for wearable joint sound sensing; for practical implementation of contact microphones in a wearable device, interface noise must be reduced. Importantly, we show that airborne signals can be measured consistently and that healthy left and right knees often produce a similar pattern in acoustic emissions.\nThese proposed methods have the potential for enabling knee joint acoustics measurement outside the clinic/lab and permitting long-term monitoring of knee health for patients rehabilitating an acute knee joint injury.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2016-03-24", "authors": ["Caitlin NTeague", "SinanHersek", "HakanToreyin", "Mindy LMillard-Stafford", "Michael LJones", "Geza FKogler", "Michael NSawka", "Omer TInan"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2016.2543226"}

The excellent piezoelectric and electrical properties of bulk ferroelectrics are degraded when the ferroelectric is processed into thin films because the grain boundaries then form randomly. Controlling the nature of nucleation and growth are the keys to achieving a good crystalline thin-film. However, the sought after high-quality ferroelectric thin-film has so far been thought to be impossible to make, and research has been restricted to atomic-layer deposition which is extremely expensive and has poor reproducibility. Here we demonstrate a novel epitaxial-like growth technique to achieve extremely uniform and large rectangular-shaped grains in thin-film ferroelectrics by dividing the nucleation and growth phases. With this technique, it is possible to achieve 100-\u03bcm large uniform grains, even made available on Si, which is large enough to fabricate a field-effect transistor in each grain.

They can precisely distinguish sound waves in low to middle frequency region. These features make them especially suitable for noise detection.

An analytical theory is derived to describe the strain dependence of average magnetic domain-wall velocity. Moreover, one 180\u00b0 domain-wall cycle around the ring dissipates an ultrasmall amount of heat, as small as 0.2 fJ, approximately 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those in current-driven cases.

By comparing OMHPs with different atomic substitutions in the ABX3 architecture, we find that the displacement of the B-site cation contributes to nearly all of the piezoelectric response and that the competition between A-X hydrogen bond and B-X metal-halide bond in OMHPs controls the piezoelectric properties.

{"title": "Real-time monitoring of focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier opening via subharmonic acoustic emission detection: implementation of confocal dual-frequency piezoelectric transducers.", "abstract": "Burst-tone focused ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles has been demonstrated to be effective at inducing temporal and local opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which promises significant clinical potential to deliver therapeutic molecules into the central nervous system (CNS). Traditional contrast-enhanced imaging confirmation after focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure serves as a post-operative indicator of the effectiveness of FUS-BBB opening, however, an indicator that can concurrently report the BBB status and BBB-opening effectiveness is required to provide effective feedback to implement this treatment clinically. In this study, we demonstrate the use of subharmonic acoustic emission detection with implementation on a confocal dual-frequency piezoelectric ceramic structure to perform real-time monitoring of FUS-BBB opening. A confocal dual-frequency (0.55 MHz/1.1 MHz) focused ultrasound transducer was designed. The 1.1 MHz spherically-curved ceramic was employed to deliver FUS exposure to induce BBB-opening, whereas the outer-ring 0.55 MHz ceramic was employed to detect the subharmonic acoustic emissions originating from the target position. In stage-1 experiments, we employed spectral analysis and performed an energy spectrum density (ESD) calculation. An optimized 0.55 MHz ESD level change was shown to effectively discriminate the occurrence of BBB-opening. Wideband acoustic emissions received from 0.55 MHz ceramics were also analyzed to evaluate its correlations with erythrocyte extravasations. In stage-2 real-time monitoring experiments, we applied the predetermined ESD change as a detection threshold in PC-controlled algorithm to predict the FUS exposure intra-operatively. In stage-1 experiment, we showed that subharmonic ESD presents distinguishable dynamics between intact BBB and opened BBB, and therefore a threshold ESD change level (5.5 dB) can be identified for BBB-opening prediction. Using this ESD change threshold detection as a surrogate to on/off control the FUS exposure in stage-2 experiments, we demonstrated both excellent sensitivity (92%) and specificity (92.3%) in discriminating BBB-opening occurrence can be obtained in animal treatments, while concurrently achieving a high positive predicted value (95.8%). Wideband ESD was also highly correlated with the occurrence and level of erythrocyte extravasations (r\u2009(2)\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.81).

Even though gold (Au) based acoustic wave sensors have been utilized extensively for detecting Hg, the potential of using other metal surfaces such as silver (Ag) is yet to be thoroughly studied. Here, we developed Ag sensitive layer-based surface acoustic wave (SAW) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors and focused on their comparative analysis for Hg sensing applications with parameters such as the sensor sensitivity, selectivity, adsorption/desorption isotherm and Hg diffusion into the surface thoroughly studied. The SAW sensor was fabricated with nickel (Ni) interdigitated transducer (IDT) electrodes and a Ag thin film on the delay line of the device. In the case of the QCM sensor, the electrodes were constructed of Ag thin film and simultaneously employed as a sensitive layer. Mercury sensing experiments were conducted for a range of concentrations between 24-365 ppbv without/with the presence of some common industrial interfering gas species (i.e. ammonia, acetaldehyde, ethyl mercaptan, dimethyl disulphide, methyl ethyl ketone and humidity) at various operating temperatures in the range of 35-95 \u00b0C. The SAW sensor was found to possess up to 70 times higher response magnitudes than its QCM counterpart at 35 \u00b0C while up to 30 and 23 times higher response magnitudes were observed for the SAW sensor at elevated temperatures of 75 and 95 \u00b0C, respectively. Furthermore, the SAW sensor showed good selectivity (>89%) toward Hg(0) vapor in the presence of all the interferents tested at an operating temperature of 75 \u00b0C while the QCM sensor exhibited significant cross-sensitivity when ethyl mercaptan was introduced along with Hg(0) vapor.

For applications in multifrequency atomic force microscopy (MF-AFM), we illustrate that a single piezoelectric layer can be simultaneously used for multimode excitation and detection of the cantilever deflection. This is achieved by a charge sensor with a bandwidth of 10 MHz and dual feedthrough cancellation to recover the resonant modes that are heavily buried in feedthrough originating from the piezoelectric capacitance. The setup enables the omission of the commonly used piezoelectric stack actuator and optical beam deflection sensor, alleviating limitations due to distorted frequency responses and instrumentation cost, respectively. The proposed method benefits from a more than two orders of magnitude increase in deflection to strain sensitivity on the fifth eigenmode leading to a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio.

{"title": "Technology Assessment: Early Sense for Monitoring Vital Signs in Hospitalized Patients", "abstract": "The EarlySense Monitoring System has been developed to provide continuous monitoring of heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and bed motion for patients in medical/surgical, oncology, orthopedics, isolation, post-partum, skilled nursing facilities, long term acute care\nEarlySense is a \nResearch conducted in the 1990s suggested that, among patients on general hospital wards, delays in treatment can lead to clinical deterioration and changes in vital signs and mental function that precede deterioration are often missed.. These observations led to the development of \u201crapid response teams\u201d (RRTs) that are activated when a patient fulfills predefined criteria. The criteria are based on vital signs checks and assessment of mental status. Some systems also include decreased urinary output, oxygen saturation, difficulty breathing, increase in supplemental oxygen dose, and subjective concern detected by the nurse at the bedside. The Early Warning Scoring Systems (EWS), Modified EWS (MEWS), and the National EWS (NEWS) are commonly used sets of criteria. These systems are widely used in VA. In addition to indicating when to call the RRT, the systems also incorporate recommendations for the frequency of bedside assessment. In 2014, a systematic review from the VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program found that EWS/NEWS have strong predictive value for cardiac arrest and patient death and their use increases RRT calls, but the impact of EWS/NEWS on preventing patient mortality, transfers to the ICU, or length of hospital stay is uncertain. The ability to predict which patients are most likely to deteriorate has not been established. DeVita et al (2010) argue that while analyses of cardiac arrests and deaths indicate that most are preceded by vital signs lying outside normal ranges, most studies are retrospective, and because the total number of clinical deteriorations has not been determined, the ability of physiological abnormalities to predict risk of a serious event is unknown. Thus, in many circumstances, clinicians cannot predict which patients are most likely to deteriorate. In addition, lack of data prevents any estimate of how often severe deterioration leads to clinically adverse outcomes. In a study examining the association of delays in transfer to ICU, morbidity, and mortality, 11 physiological and laboratory markers of clinical instability were observed as having high sensitivity (88%) in identifying patients who were transferred to the ICU. These markers, however, lacked specificity (13%) and had very low positive predictive value (8%). This study suggests hospital staff cannot rely on markers alone to identify patients most at risk of deterioration without using considerable resources and incurring a high cost-benefit ratio. Because of the limitations in predicting patients at highest risk of a serious event, the ability of intermittent or continuous monitoring systems to detect severe physiological abnormalities in order to provide a true estimate of risk or to determine optimum response triggering values has not been fully established.,,,, Qualitative research suggests that nurses' worry or concern often precedes deterioration in vital signs, suggesting that better characterization of \u201cconcern\u201d might lead to detection of deterioration at an early stage when intervention to prevent adverse events may be more effective.\nThe rationale for continuous vital sign monitoring is that suboptimal vital sign monitoring prior to an RRT referral may contribute to suboptimal patient outcomes. A more specific rationale for the \nStandard nurse-led monitoring in conjunction with EWS or MEWS is the most commonly used alternative to continuous vital sign monitoring. Other low-acuity systems are also alternatives to EarlySense. They are similar to EarlySense but require leads attached to the patient, and some require cables to connect with the display. All of these systems capture respiratory rate and heart rate, and some capture blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, and ECG. Most contribute vital sign data directly to the electronic medical record. The market for low-acuity monitoring systems is growing rapidly, leading to intense technological development.

The composite membrane exhibits asymmetric wettability, with the modified surface being in-air hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic, and the unmodified surface remaining hydrophobic. By comparing the performance of the composite membrane and the pristine PVDF membrane in direct contact MD experiments using a saline emulsion with 1000 ppm crude oil (in water), we showed that the fabricated composite membrane was significantly more resistant to oil fouling compared to the pristine hydrophobic PVDF membrane. Force spectroscopy was conducted for the interaction between an oil droplet and the membrane surface using a force tensiometer. The difference between the composite membrane and the pristine PVDF membrane in their interaction with an oil droplet served to explain the difference in the fouling propensities between these two membranes observed in MD experiments. The results from this study suggest that underwater oleophobic coating can effectively mitigate oil fouling in MD operations, and that the fabricated composite membrane with asymmetric wettability can enable MD to desalinate hypersaline wastewater with high concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2016-03-10", "authors": ["ZhangxinWang", "DeyinHou", "ShihongLin"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.5b05976"}

It is recently discovered that strain engineering can be an active and effective approach in tuning the magnetic/transport properties of thin films. The primary method in strain modulation is via the converse piezoelectric effect of ferroelectrics, which is usually volatile due to the reliance of the required electric field. Also the maximum amount of deformation in ferroelectrics is usually limited to be less than 1%, and the corresponding magnetoelastic strain energy introduced to ferromagnetic films is on the order of 10(4) J/m(3), not enough to overcome magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (Ku) in many materials. Different from using conventional strain inducing substrates, this paper reports on the significantly large, reversible, and nonvolatile lattice strain in the L10-FePt films (up to 2.18%) using nonelectrically controlled shape memory alloy substrates. Introduced lattice strain can be large enough to effectively affect domain structure and magnetic reversal in FePt. A noticeable decrease of coercivity field by 80% is observed. Moreover, the coercivity field tunability using such substrates is nonvolatile at room temperature and is also reversible due to the characteristics of the shape memory effect.

{"title": "Glass-windowed ultrasound transducers.", "abstract": "In research and industrial processes, it is increasingly common practice to combine multiple measurement modalities. Nevertheless, experimental tools that allow the co-linear combination of optical and ultrasonic transmission have rarely been reported. The aim of this study was to develop and characterise a water-matched ultrasound transducer architecture using standard components, with a central optical window larger than 10 mm in diameter allowing for optical transmission. The window can be used to place illumination or imaging apparatus such as light guides, miniature cameras, or microscope objectives, simplifying experimental setups. Four design variations of a basic architecture were fabricated and characterised with the objective to assess whether the variations influence the acoustic output. The basic architecture consisted of a piezoelectric ring and a glass disc, with an aluminium casing. The designs differed in piezoelectric element dimensions: inner diameter, ID=10 mm, outer diameter, OD=25 mm, thickness, TH=4 mm or ID=20 mm, OD=40 mm, TH=5 mm; glass disc dimensions OD=20-50 mm, TH=2-4 mm; and details of assembly. The transducers' frequency responses were characterised using electrical impedance spectroscopy and pulse-echo measurements, the acoustic propagation pattern using acoustic pressure field scans, the acoustic power output using radiation force balance measurements, and the acoustic pressure using a needle hydrophone. Depending on the design and piezoelectric element dimensions, the resonance frequency was in the range 350-630 kHz, the -6 dB bandwidth was in the range 87-97%, acoustic output power exceeded 1 W, and acoustic pressure exceeded 1 MPa peak-to-peak. 3D stress simulations were performed to predict the isostatic pressure required to induce material failure and 4D acoustic simulations. The pressure simulations indicated that specific design variations could sustain isostatic pressures up to 4.8 MPa.The acoustic simulations were able to predict the behaviour of the fabricated devices. A total of 480 simulations, varying material dimensions (piezoelectric ring ID, glass disc diameter, glass thickness) and drive frequency indicated that the emitted acoustic profile varies nonlinearly with these parameters.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["TosteinYddal", "Odd HelgeGilja", "SandyCochran", "MichielPostema", "SpirosKotopoulis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.02.005"}

The LW-based acoustofluidic platform used in this study is advantageous in that the device is actuated over a range of frequencies without changing the device structure or electrode pattern. In addition, the device is simple to operate and cheap to fabricate. The LWs, produced on a piezoelectric substrate, attenuate inside the fluid and create acoustic streaming flow (ASF) in the form of a poloidal flow with toroidal vortices. The PS particles experience direct acoustic radiation force (ARF) in addition to being influenced by the ASF, which drive the concentration of particles to form a ring. This phenomenon was previously attributed to the ASF alone, but the present experimental results confirm that the ARF plays an important role in forming the particle ring, which would not be possible in the presence of only the ASF.

{"title": "A Combined Approach To Crooked Nose Deformity.", "abstract": "Crooked nose deformity is a complex anatomical deformity; therefore, repair remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a new technique for crooked nose deformity repair.\nTwenty-two patients underwent intraoperative evaluations and measurements, followed by surgery using the open rhinoplasty technique. Our method involves three major steps. First is the creation of an asymmetric medial oblique osteotomy using piezoelectric ultrasonic surgery and double lateral osteotomies, wherein the asymmetric bony ascending part of the maxillary bone at the base of the nasal vault is fractured, pushed in, and delivered to the face. Second is septoplasty with L-strut preservation. The L-strut is removed as a 1-cm block caudally from the septal stump of the keystone area. A (or double) fabricated batten cartilage graft is placed on the concave side of the deviation and sutured to cover the septal stump. The L-strut is then replaced and sutured on the batten graft, redirecting the septum toward the midline. Third is an overlapping cruroplasty on the side of the long asymmetrical lower lateral cartilage to equalize both wings and correct tip deviation.\nOur new technique was effective for the treatment of crooked nose deformity.\nOur technique of K-stone batten plasty with delivery to the face and overlapping cruroplasty may be an effective surgical method for crooked nose deformity.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Firstly, the composition dependence of thermorheological complexity of PMMA/PVDF blends in the melt was revealed. The molecular entanglement state involving intra- and interchain entanglements was found to govern the scenario of thermorheological complexity. Intriguingly, local heterogeneity was further demonstrated to exist in the melt-state blends with intermediate compositions, and its origin was depicted to be the interphase. The interphase, coupled with unfavourable interchain entanglements in those blends, could explain the reduced viscosity and speed-up relaxations, contributing to the overall thermorheological complexity. Besides, two experimental glass transition temperatures of blends were resolved in view of segment motions in the miscible phase and the crystal-amorphous interphase, and further assessed via the \"self-concentration\" concept. The presence of a crystal-amorphous interphase, likely leading to three distinct dynamics of segments in blends, was supposed to contribute to the dynamic heterogeneity in segment relaxations for PMMA/PVDF blends in the solid state. Lastly, effects of dynamic heterogeneity on dynamic mechanical properties were also evaluated.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["BoLu", "KhalidLamnawar", "AbderrahimMaazouz", "HuaguiZhang"], "doi": "10.1039/c5sm02659h"}

It is designed for easy fabrication and high reliability in outputting signals. In bionics, the fingerprint of the glabrous skin plays an important role during object handling. Therefore, in order to enhance friction and to provide better manipulation, the ridges of the fingertips were introduced into the design of the proposed tactile sensor.

{"title": "Feedback system for divertor impurity seeding based on real-time measurements of surface heat flux in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak.", "abstract": "Mitigation of the intense heat flux to the divertor is one of the outstanding problems in fusion energy. One technique that has shown promise is impurity seeding, i.e., the injection of low-Z gaseous impurities (typically N2 or Ne) to radiate and dissipate the power before it arrives to the divertor target plate. To this end, the Alcator C-Mod team has created a first-of-its-kind feedback system to control the injection of seed gas based on real-time surface heat flux measurements. Surface thermocouples provide real-time measurements of the surface temperature response to the plasma heat flux. The surface temperature measurements are inputted into an analog computer that \"solves\" the 1-D heat transport equation to deliver accurate, real-time signals of the surface heat flux. The surface heat flux signals are sent to the C-Mod digital plasma control system, which uses a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm to control the duty cycle demand to a pulse width modulated piezo valve, which in turn controls the injection of gas into the private flux region of the C-Mod divertor.

Likewise, other energy harvesters, acoustic energy harvesters (AEHs), have been developed and are gaining swift interest in last few years. This paper presents a review of AEHs reported in the literature for the applications of WSNs. Based on transduction mechanism, there are two types of AEHs: piezoelectric acoustic energy harvesters (PEAEHs) and electromagnetic acoustic energy harvesters (EMAEHs). The reported AEHs are mostly characterized under the sound pressure level (SPL) that ranges from 45 to 161 dB. The range for resonant frequency of the produced AEHs is from 146 Hz to 24 kHz and these produced 0.68 \u00d7 10(-6) \u03bcW to 30 mW power. The maximum power (30 mW) is produced by a PEAEH, when the harvester is subjected to a SPL of 161 dB and 2.64 kHz frequency. However, for EMAEHs, the maximum power reported is about 1.96 mW (at 125 dB and 143 Hz). Under the comparable SPLs, the power production by the reported EMAEHs is relatively better than that of PEAEHs, moreover, due to lower resonant frequency, the EMAEHs are more feasible for the low frequency band acoustical environment.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["Farid UllahKhan", "Muhammad UmairKhattak"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4942102"}

{"title": "An Investigation of Lateral Modes in FBAR Resonators.", "abstract": "Using first principles and the constitutive equations for a piezoelectric, we solve the 2D acoustic wave inside a single, infinite, piezoelectric membrane in order to study the dispersion of Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) lateral modes, with and without infinitely-thin electrodes. The acoustic eigenfunction is a dual wave, composed of longitudinal and shear components, able to satisfy the 2D acoustic boundary conditions at the vacuum interfaces. For the single piezoelectric slab we obtain analytical expressions of the dispersion for frequencies near the longitudinal resonant frequency (Fs) of the resonator. These expressions are more useful for the understanding of dispersion in FBARs and more elegant than numerical methods like Finite Element Modeling (FEM) and various matrix methods. We additionally find that the interaction between the resonator's electrodes and the acoustic wave modifies the lateral mode dispersion when compared to the case with no electrodes. When correctly accounting for these interactions the dispersion zero is placed clearly at Fs, unlike what is calculated from a 2D model without electrodes where the dispersion zero is placed at Fp. This is important since all experimental evidence of measures FBAR resonators shows that the dispersion zero is at Fs. Furthermore, we introduce an electrical current flow model for the propagating acoustic wave inside the electroded piezoelectric and based on this model we can discuss an electrode-loss mechanism for FBAR lateral modes which depends on dispersion. From our model it results that lateral modes with real kx have higher electrode dissipation if they are closer to the resonant frequency. This is consistent with the typical behavior of measured FBAR filters where the maximum lateral mode damage on the insertion loss takes place for frequencies immediately below Fs.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2016-03-02", "authors": ["TiberiuJamneala", "PaulBradley", "AlexandreShirakawa", "RobertThalhammer", "RichardRuby"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2531744"}

{"title": "An Improved Gaussian Mixture Model for Damage Propagation Monitoring of an Aircraft Wing Spar under Changing Structural Boundary Conditions.", "abstract": "Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technology is considered to be a key technology to reduce the maintenance cost and meanwhile ensure the operational safety of aircraft structures. It has gradually developed from theoretic and fundamental research to real-world engineering applications in recent decades. The problem of reliable damage monitoring under time-varying conditions is a main issue for the aerospace engineering applications of SHM technology. Among the existing SHM methods, Guided Wave (GW) and piezoelectric sensor-based SHM technique is a promising method due to its high damage sensitivity and long monitoring range. Nevertheless the reliability problem should be addressed. Several methods including environmental parameter compensation, baseline signal dependency reduction and data normalization, have been well studied but limitations remain. This paper proposes a damage propagation monitoring method based on an improved Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). It can be used on-line without any structural mechanical model and a priori knowledge of damage and time-varying conditions. With this method, a baseline GMM is constructed first based on the GW features obtained under time-varying conditions when the structure under monitoring is in the healthy state. When a new GW feature is obtained during the on-line damage monitoring process, the GMM can be updated by an adaptive migration mechanism including dynamic learning and Gaussian components split-merge. The mixture probability distribution structure of the GMM and the number of Gaussian components can be optimized adaptively. Then an on-line GMM can be obtained.

We further identified specific residues within the pore module that determine unitary conductance, pore blockage and ion selectivity for divalent and monovalent cations and anions. The non-pore-containing region of Piezo1 confers mechanosensitivity to mechano-insensitive trimeric acid-sensing ion channels, demonstrating that Piezo1 channels possess intrinsic mechanotransduction modules separate from their pore modules.

In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in ferroelectric oxide thin film technology-a field which is now a strong driving force in areas such as electronics, spintronics and photovoltaics. Here, we apply epitaxial strain engineering to tune the optical response of BiFeO3 thin films, and find a very large variation of the optical index with strain, corresponding to an effective elasto-optic coefficient larger than that of quartz. We observe a concomitant strain-driven variation in light absorption--reminiscent of piezochromism--which we show can be manipulated by an electric field. This constitutes an electrochromic effect that is reversible, remanent and not driven by defects.

A highly flexible Ni-Cr metal foil substrate with a conductive LaNiO3 bottom electrode enables the growth of flexible PZT film having high piezoelectric (140 pC/N) and pyroelectric (50 nC/cm(2)K) coefficients at room temperature. The flexible PZT-based NG effectively scavenges mechanical vibration and thermal fluctuation from sources ranging from the human body to the surroundings such as wind. Furthermore, it stably generates electric current even at elevated temperatures of 100 \u00b0C, relative humidity of 70%, and pH of 13 by virtue of its high Curie temperature and strong resistance for water and base. As proof of power generation under harsh environments, we demonstrate the generation of extremely high current at the exhaust pipe of a car, where hot CO and CO2 gases are rapidly expelled to air.

This reflex is greater in a rat model of simulated peripheral arterial disease in which a femoral artery is chronically ligated than it is in rats with freely perfused femoral arteries. The role played by the mechanically sensitive component of the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in ligated rats is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the mechano-gated channel inhibitor GsMTx4, a relatively selective inhibitor of mechano-gated Piezo channels, reduces the exercise pressor reflex in decerebrate rats with ligated femoral arteries. Injection of 10 \u03bcg of GsMTx4 into the arterial supply of the hindlimb reduced the pressor response to Achilles tendon stretch (a purely mechanical stimulus) but had no effect on the pressor responses to intra-arterial injection of \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP or lactic acid (purely metabolic stimuli). Moreover, injection of 10 \u03bcg of GsMTx4 into the arterial supply of the hindlimb reduced both the integrated pressor area (control 535 \u00b1 21, GsMTx4 218 \u00b1 24 mmHg\u00b7s; P < 0.01), peak pressor (control 29 \u00b1 2, GsMTx4 14 \u00b1 3 mmHg; P < 0.01), and renal sympathetic nerve responses to electrically induced intermittent hindlimb muscle contraction (a mixed mechanical and metabolic stimulus). The reduction of the integrated pressor area during contraction caused by GsMTx4 was greater in rats with ligated femoral arteries than it was in rats with freely perfused femoral arteries.

The well-known Stoney's equation, derived more than 100 years ago, conceals the film electrical properties with the replacement of substrate deformation induced by adsorptions of particles. This implicit expression provides a shortcut to circumvent the difficulty in identifying some film properties, however, it limits the capacity to ascertain the relation between surface stress variation and the surface charge state. In this paper, we present an analytical expression to quantify the cantilever deflection/surface stress and the film potential difference by combining the piezoelectric theory and Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrolyte solution.

Based on Parsegian's mesoscopic interaction potential, a multiscale prediction for the piezoelectric coefficient of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) film is done, and the results show that the distinctive size effect with variations in salt concentration and nucleotide number provides us with an opportunity to obtain a more sensitive potential-actuated microcantilever sensor by careful control of packing conditions.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2016-02-27", "authors": ["Neng-HuiZhang", "Jun-ZhengWu", "Wei-LieMeng", "Zou-QingTan"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/27/14/144001"}

{"title": "Micromanipulation of equine blastocysts to allow vitrification.", "abstract": "Embryo cryopreservation presents an essential method for banking of valuable genetics. However, in equine species the cryopreservation of embryos is complicated by three interacting factors: (1) the late entry of the embryo into the uterus (~6 days after ovulation); (2) the rapid expansion of the blastocyst; and (3) the formation of the equine embryonic capsule, a glycoprotein membrane that forms between the embryo and zona. Efforts to freeze or vitrify equine expanded blastocysts were initially met with little success. In addition, it was thought that breaching the capsule led to loss of embryo viability. We found that micromanipulation with the Piezo drill to puncture the capsule and collapse the blastocyst before vitrification provided a means for successful cryopreservation of equine expanded blastocysts, and that this can be done successfully using a standard sperm injection pipette. Modification of cryoprotectants and methods for vitrification and warming resulted in a technique that allowed successful vitrification of expanded equine blastocysts up to 650 \u00b5m diameter, with pregnancy rates approaching those for fresh embryos. After blastocyst collapse, vitrification is performed with ethylene glycol and galactose as cryoprotectants, and the embryo is cooled in a low-volume micropipette tip.

Important applications include diagnosis of early onset diseases such as arthritis and investigations into cellular mechanoresponse in tissue. Quantification of tissue mechanics at length and time scales relevant to biological processes, however, remains a technical challenge. Here, we present a new nanoindentation approach that is ideally suited to probe the viscoelastic properties of soft, hydrated tissues. We built a ferrule-top probe that uses wavelength modulation in a Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity configuration to detect cantilever deflection and to drive a feedback-controlled piezoelectric actuator. This technique allows us to control the static load applied onto the sample using an all-optical mm-sized probe. We extract the local elastic and viscous moduli of the samples by superposing a small oscillatory load and recording the indentation depth at the frequency of oscillation. By using a set of silicone elastomers with a range of stiffnesses representative of biological tissues, we demonstrate that the technique can accurately determine moduli over a wide range (0.1-100 kPa) and over a frequency range of 0.01-10 Hz. Direct comparison with macroscopic rheology measurements yields excellent quantitative agreement, without any fitting parameters. Finally, we show how this method can provide a spatially-resolved map of large variations in mechanical properties (orders of magnitude) across the surface of soft samples thanks to high sensitivity over large (>\u03bcm) cantilever deflections.

{"title": "Optimization of gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration process for seawater pretreatment.", "abstract": "Seawater pretreatment by gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration at 40 mbar has been investigated. In this system, a beneficial biofilm develops on the membrane that helps to stabilize flux. The effects of membrane type, prefiltration and system configuration on stable flux, biofilm layer properties and dissolved carbon removal were studied. The results show that the use of flat sheet PVDF membranes with pore sizes of 0.22 and 0.45 \u03bcm in GDM filtration achieved higher stabilized permeate fluxes (7.3-8.4 L/m(2)h) than that of flat sheet PES 100 kD membranes and hollow fibre PVDF 0.1 \u03bcm membranes. Pore constriction and cake filtration were identified as major membrane fouling mechanisms, but their relative contributions varied with filtration time for the various membranes. Compared to raw seawater, prefiltering of seawater with meshes at sizes of 10, 100 and 1000 \u03bcm decreased the permeate flux, which was attributed to removal of beneficial eukaryotic populations. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed that the porosity of the biofouling layer was more significantly related with permeate flux development rather than its thickness and roughness. To increase the contact time between the biofilm and the dissolved organics, a hybrid biofilm-submerged GDM reactor was evaluated, which displayed significantly higher permeate fluxes than the submerged GDM reactor. Although integrating the biofilm reactor with the membrane system displayed better permeate quality than the GDM filtration cells, it could not effectively reduce dissolved organic substances in the seawater. This may be attributed to the decomposition/degradation of solid organic substances in the feed and carbon fixation by the biofilm. Further studies of the dynamic carbon balance are required.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["BingWu", "FlorianHochstrasser", "EbrahimAkhondi", "No\u00ebmiAmbauen", "LukasTschirren", "MichaelBurkhardt", "Anthony GFane", "WouterPronk"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2016.02.021"}

The factors considered for experimental design were the UV (ultraviolet)-irradiation time, the concentrations of the initiator and solvent, and the kinds and concentrations of the silane coupling agent. The optimum operating conditions determined were UV-irradiation time of 25 min, an initiator concentration of 0-0.25 wt.%, solvent of N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC), and silane coupling agent KH570 with a concentration of 7 wt.%. The obtained optimal parameters were located in the valid region and the experimental confirmation tests conducted showed good accordance between predicted and experimental values. Under these optimal conditions, the water absorption of the grafted modified glass fiber was improved from 13.6% to 23%; the tensile strength was enhanced and the peeling strength of the glass fiber reinforced PVDF composite membrane was improved by 23.7% and 32.6% with an AM concentration at 1 wt.% and 2 wt.%. The surface composition and microstructure of AM grafted glass fiber were studied via several techniques including Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).

This study included 13 patients. An osteotomy was made with a piezoelectric device, and the IAN bundle was moved buccally. Dental implants were then inserted medial to the nerve bundle, and the inner surface of the buccal cortical bone plate was shaped to reduce its thickness. Finally, the bone plate was repositioned to restore the original shape and contour of the mandible. Neurosensory examinations of the lower lip and chin were performed using three tests: light touch, pain, and two-point discrimination. Three months after surgery, the function of the IAN was judged to be completely restored at 11 of the 13 surgical sites. Differences in the tests comparing the operated and non-operated sides were not significant. No implants were lost, and all patients were satisfied with the result.

A time window function was adopted to extract the desired signals from the P matrix analysis.

Using this method, the SAW in aluminum (Al) /128\u00ba-YXLiNbO3 PnCs was analyzed over 150 periods. Experiments were also conducted. To choose the appropriate size of the unit P matrix, the variance between experimental results and theoretical results, and time/memory cost were compared for different periods.

Additionally, container closure integrity of these samples was measured using helium leakage (physical container closure integrity) and compared to characterization data. The different capping equipment settings lead to residual seal force values from 7 to 115 N. High residual seal force values were achieved with high capping pre-compression force and a short distance between the capping plate and plunge. The choice of container closure system influenced the obtained residual seal force values. The residual seal force tester and piezoelectric measurements showed similar trends. All vials passed physical container closure integrity testing, and no stopper rupture was seen with any of the settings applied, suggesting that container closure integrity was warranted for the studied container closure system with the chosen capping setting ranges.\nThe vial capping process is a critical unit operation during drug product manufacturing, as it could possibly generate cosmetic defects or even affect container closure integrity.

Although imaging techniques are developing rapidly, it is not currently possible, in a fully active cochlea, to obtain detailed measurements of the motion of individual elements within a cross section of the organ of Corti. This motion is predicted using a two-dimensional finite-element model. The various solid components are modelled using elastic elements, the outer hair cells (OHCs) as piezoelectric elements and the perilymph and endolymph as viscous and nearly incompressible fluid elements. The model is validated by comparison with existing measurements of the motions within the passive organ of Corti, calculated when it is driven either acoustically, by the fluid pressure or electrically, by excitation of the OHCs. The transverse basilar membrane (BM) motion and the shearing motion between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina are calculated for these two excitation modes.

Here, we report the fabrication of a flexible self-powered ZnO/Spiro-MeOTAD hybrid heterojunction ultraviolet photodetector (UV PD). The obtained device has a fast and stable response to the UV light illumination at zero bias. Together with responsivity and detectivity, the photocurrent can be increased about 1-fold upon applying a 0.753% tensile strain. The enhanced performance can be attributed to more efficient separation and transport of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which is favored by the positive piezopotential modulated energy-band structure at the ZnO-Spiro-MeOTAD interface.

{"title": "Topographic analysis of the skull vibration-induced nystagmus test with piezoelectric accelerometers and force sensors.", "abstract": "Vibration-induced nystagmus is elicited by skull or posterior cervical muscle stimulations in patients with vestibular diseases. Skull vibrations delivered by the skull vibration-induced nystagmus test are known to stimulate the inner ear structures directly. This study aimed to measure the vibration transfer at different cranium locations and posterior cervical regions to contribute toward stimulus topographic optimization (experiment 1) and to determine the force applied on the skull with a hand-held vibrator to study the test reproducibility and provide recommendations for good clinical practices (experiment 2). In experiment 1, a 100 Hz hand-held vibrator was applied on the skull (vertex, mastoids) and posterior cervical muscles in 11 healthy participants. Vibration transfer was measured by piezoelectric sensors. In experiment 2, the vibrator was applied 30 times by two experimenters with dominant and nondominant hands on a mannequin equipped to measure the force. Experiment 1 showed that after unilateral mastoid vibratory stimulation, the signal transfer was higher when recorded on the contralateral mastoid than on the vertex or posterior cervical muscles (P<0.001). No difference was observed between the different vibratory locations when vibration transfer was measured on vertex and posterior cervical muscles. Experiment 2 showed that the force applied to the mannequin varied according to the experimenters and the handedness, higher forces being observed with the most experienced experimenter and with the dominant hand (10.3 \u00b1 1.0 and 7.8 \u00b1 2.9 N, respectively). The variation ranged from 9.8 to 29.4% within the same experimenter. Bone transcranial vibration transfer is more efficient from one mastoid to the other mastoid than other anatomical sites. The mastoid is therefore the optimal site for skull vibration-induced nystagmus test in patients with unilateral vestibular lesions and enables a stronger stimulation of the healthy side. In clinical practice, the vibrator should be placed on the mastoid and should be held by the clinician's dominant hand.", "journal": "Neuroreport", "date": "2016-02-13", "authors": ["GeorgesDumas", "AlexisLion", "PhilippePerrin", "EvaristeOuedraogo", "S\u00e9bastienSchmerber"], "doi": "10.1097/WNR.0000000000000539"}

Despite of the progress made in this rapidly-advancing field, a fundamental understanding and common standard for consistently quantifying and evaluating the performance of the various types of piezoelectric NGs is still lacking. In their recent study Crossley and Kar-Narayan (2015 Nanotechnology 26 344001), systematically investigated dynamical properties of piezoelectric NGs by taking into account the effect of driving mechanism and load frequency on NG performance. They further defined the NGs' figures of merit as energy harvested normalized by applied strain or stress for NGs under strain-driven or stress-driven conditions, which are commonly seen in the vibrational energy harvesting.

{"title": "Utilizing a Key Aptamer Structure-Switching Mechanism for the Ultrahigh Frequency Detection of Cocaine.", "abstract": "Aptasensing of small molecules remains a challenge as detection often requires the use of labels or signal amplification methodologies, resulting in both difficult-to-prepare sensor platforms and multistep, complex assays. Furthermore, many aptasensors rely on the binding mechanism or structural changes associated with target capture by the aptameric probe, resulting in a detection scheme customized to each aptamer. It is in this context that we report herein a sensitive cocaine aptasensor that offers both real-time and label-free measurement capabilities. Detection relies on the electromagnetic piezoelectric acoustic sensor (EMPAS) platform. The sensing interface consists of a S-(11-trichlorosilyl-undecanyl)benzenethiosulfonate (BTS) adlayer-coated quartz disc onto which a structure-switching cocaine aptamer (MN6) is immobilized, completing the preparation of the MN6 cocaine aptasensor (M6CA). The EMPAS system has recently been employed as the foundation of a cocaine aptasensor based on a structurally rigid cocaine aptamer variant (MN4), an aptasensor referred to by analogy as M4CA. M6CA represents a significant increase in terms of analytical performance, compared to not only M4CA but also other cocaine aptamer-based sensors that do not rely on signal amplification, producing an apparent K(d) of 27 \u00b1 6 \u03bcM and a 0.3 \u03bcM detection limit. Remarkably, the latter is in the range of that achieved by cocaine aptasensors relying on signal amplification. Furthermore, M6CA proved to be capable not only of regaining its cocaine-binding ability via simple buffer flow over the sensing interface (i.e., without the necessity to implement an additional regeneration step, such as in the case of M4CA), but also of detecting cocaine in a multicomponent matrix possessing potentially assay-interfering species. Finally, through observation of the distinct shape of its response profiles to cocaine injection, demonstration was made that the EMPAS system in practice offers the possibility to distinguish between the binding mechanisms of structure-switching (MN6) vs rigid (MN4) aptameric probes, an ability that could allow the EMPAS to provide a more universal aptasensing platform than what is ordinarily observed in the literature.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2016-02-13", "authors": ["Miguel A DNeves", "ChristopheBlaszykowski", "MichaelThompson"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04010"}

Piezo1, which has been identified in the transcriptome of mammalian cochlear hair cells, encodes a transmembrane protein that forms mechanosensitive channels in other tissues. We investigated the properties of the MET channel in outer hair cells (OHCs) of Piezo1 mice (postnatal day 6-9). The MET current was elicited by deflecting the hair bundle of OHCs using sinewave and step stimuli from a piezo-driven fluid jet. Apical and basal OHCs were investigated because the properties of the MET channel vary along the cochlea. We found that the maximal MET current amplitude and the resting open probability of the MET channel in OHCs were similar between Piezo1(+/-) haploinsufficient mice and wild-type littermates. The sensitivity to block by the permeant MET channel blocker dihydrostreptomycin was also similar between the two genotypes. Finally, the anomalous mechano-gated current, which is activated by sheer force and which is tip-link independent, was unaffected in OHCs from Piezo1(+/-) haploinsufficient mice.

It is highly soluble polymer and its solution property is studied by varying polarity in pure solvents (water, methanol, isopropanol) and also in mixed solvents (water-methanol and water-isopropanol) by measuring the hydrodynamic size (Z-average) of the particles by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The variation of Z-average size with temperature of the PD solution (0.2%, w/v) indicates a lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type phase transition (T(PL)) in aqueous medium, an upper critical solution temperature (UCST)-type phase transition (T(PU)) in isopropanol medium, and no such phase transition for methanol solution.

The proposed device, which comprises a 10:1 high-aspect-ratio parylene microneedle array and a chamber structure, was monolithically realized using a novel fabrication process. The vibrating motion of the microneedles was generated using a piezoelectric actuator. This device can be potentially applied to extract and collect blood by puncturing the dermis layer of human skin. The fabricated device is advantageous because of its biocompatibility, simple fabrication process, and low associated costs. Additionally, the graph of the measured extraction flow rate versus the pressure drop that is presented shows an agreement with the results predicted by analytical models.

Most of the photoacoustic (PA) energy of human coronary plaque lipids was found to lie in the frequency band between 2 and 15 MHz requiring a very broadband transducer, especially if a combination with intravascular ultrasound is desired. We have developed a broadband polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) transducer (0.6 \u00d7 0.6 mm, 52 \u03bcm thick) with integrated electronics to match the low capacitance of such a small polyvinylidene difluoride element (<5 pF/mm(2)) with the high capacitive load of the long cable (\u223c100 pF/m).

{"title": "Glycan involvement in the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to tears.", "abstract": "The human eye is constantly bathed by tears, which protect the ocular surface via a variety of mechanisms. The O-linked glycans of tear mucins have long been considered to play a role in binding to pathogens and facilitating their removal in the tear flow. Other conjugated glycans in tears could similarly contribute to pathogen binding and removal but have received less attention. In the work presented here we assessed the contribution of glycan moieties, in particular the protein attached N-glycans, presented by the broad complement of tear proteins to the adhesion of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of microbial keratitis and ulceration of the cornea. Our adhesion assay involved immobilising the macromolecular components of tears into the wells of a polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) microtitre filter plate and probing the binding of fluorescently labelled bacteria. Three P.\u00a0aeruginosa strains were studied: a cytotoxic strain (6206) and an invasive strain (6294) from eye infections, and an invasive strain (320) from a urinary tract infection (UTI). The ocular isolates adhered two to three times more to human tears than to human saliva or porcine gastric mucin, suggesting ocular niche-specific adaptation. Support for the role of the N-glycans carried by human tear proteins in the binding and removal of P.\u00a0aeruginosa from the eye was shown by: 1) pre-incubation of the bacteria with free component sugars, galactose, mannose, fucose and sialyl lactose (or combination thereof) inhibiting adhesion of all the P.\u00a0aeruginosa strains to the immobilised tear proteins, with the greatest inhibition of binding of the ocular cytotoxic 6206 and least for the invasive 6294 strain; 2) pre-incubation of the bacteria with N-glycans released from the commercially available human milk lactoferrin, an abundant protein that carries N-linked glycans in tears, inhibiting the adhesion to tears of the ocular bacteria by up to 70%, which was significantly more binding inhibition than by the same amount of intact human lactoferrin or by the plant-derived N-glycans released from the rice recombinant lactoferrin; 3) pre-incubation of the bacteria with N-linked glycans released from human tear proteins inhibiting the adhesion of the ocular P.\u00a0aeruginosa strains to immobilised tear proteins; 4) inhibition by the N-glycans from lactoferrin of the ability of an ocular strain of P.\u00a0aeruginosa to invade corneal epithelial cells; 5) removal of terminal sialic acid and fucose moieties from the tear glycoproteins with \u03b12-3,6,8 neuraminidase (sialidase) and \u03b11-2,3,4 fucosidase resulting in a reduction in binding of the UTI P.\u00a0aeruginosa isolate, but not the adhesion of the ocular cytotoxic (6206) or invasive (6294) isolates. Glycosidase activity was validated by mass spectrometry. In all cases, the magnitude of inhibition of bacterial adhesion by the N-glycans was consistently greater for the cytotoxic ocular strain than for the invasive ocular strain. Ocular P.\u00a0aeruginosa isolates seems to exhibit different adhesion mechanism than previously known PAI and PAII lectin adhesion.

In this particular case, sensors are used to detect dynamic mechanical loads at early stages after intervention of problems associated with prostheses implantation. The aim of this work is to select an adequate electrode for sensor applications capable, in an initial stage to avoid bone cell adhesion, but at a long stage, permit osteointegration and osteoinduction. This work reports on the evaluation of osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells behavior in terms of proliferation, adhesion and long-term differentiation of two different systems used as sensor electrodes: Ti1-xAgx and Ag-TiNx deposited by d.c. and pulsed magnetron sputtering at room temperature on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The results indicated an improved effect of Ag-TiNx electrodes compared with Ti1-xAgx and TiN, in terms of diminished cell adhesion and proliferation at an initial cell culture stage. Nevertheless, when cell culture time is longer, cells grown onto Ag-TiNx electrodes are capable to proliferate and also differentiate at proper rates, indicating the suitability of this coating for sensor application in prostheses devices.

Effects of HA/BaTiO3 composites with different porosities, with and without polarizing treatment on adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts were investigated in vitro. Results revealed that cell densities of the porous groups were significantly higher than those of the dense group (p<0.05), so did the alkaline phosphate (ALP) and bone gla protein (BGP) activities. Porosity of 50% group exhibited higher ALP activity and BGP activity than those of the 40% and 60% groups. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations revealed that osteoblasts adhered and stretched better on porous HA/BaTiO3 than on the dense one, especially HA/BaTiO3 with porosity of 50% and 60%. However, there was no significant difference in the cell morphology, cell densities, ALP and BGP activities between the polarized group and the non-polarized group (p>0.05).

{"title": "Active layers of high-performance lead zirconate titanate at temperatures compatible with silicon nano- and microeletronic [corrected] devices.", "abstract": "Applications of ferroelectric materials in modern microelectronics will be greatly encouraged if the thermal incompatibility between inorganic ferroelectrics and semiconductor devices is overcome. Here, solution-processable layers of the most commercial ferroelectric compound--morphotrophic phase boundary lead zirconate titanate, namely Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT)--are grown on silicon substrates at temperatures well below the standard CMOS process of semiconductor technology. The method, potentially transferable to a broader range of Zr:Ti ratios, is based on the addition of crystalline nanoseeds to photosensitive solutions of PZT resulting in perovskite crystallization from only 350\u2009\u00b0C after the enhanced decomposition of metal precursors in the films by UV irradiation. A remanent polarization of 10.0\u2009\u03bcC cm(-2) is obtained for these films that is in the order of the switching charge densities demanded for FeRAM devices. Also, a dielectric constant of ~90 is measured at zero voltage which exceeds that of current single-oxide candidates for capacitance applications. The multifunctionality of the films is additionally demonstrated by their pyroelectric and piezoelectric performance.

For a semi-infinite PE/PM or PM/PE medium, the free surface is parallel to the layer interface. Both PE and PM materials are assumed to be transversely isotropic solids. Dispersion equations are derived by the stiffness/transfer matrix methods, respectively. The effects of electric-magnetic (ME) boundary conditions at the free surface and the layer thickness ratios on dispersion curves are considered in detail. Numerical examples show that the results calculated by the two methods are the same. The dispersion curves of SH surface waves are below the bulk bands or inside the frequency gaps. The ratio of the layer thickness has an important effect not only on the bulk bands but also on the dispersion curves of SH surface waves. Electric and magnetic boundary conditions, respectively, determine the dispersion curves of SH surface waves for the PE/PM and PM/PE semi-infinite structures. The band structures of SH bulk waves are consistent for the PE/PM and PM/PE structures, however, the dispersive behaviors of SH surface waves are indeed different for the two composites.

{"title": "Analysis of dead zone sources in a closed-loop fiber optic gyroscope.", "abstract": "Analysis of the dead zone is among the intensive studies in a closed-loop fiber optic gyroscope. In a dead zone, a gyroscope cannot detect any rotation and produces a zero bias. In this study, an analysis of dead zone sources is performed in simulation and experiments. In general, the problem is mainly due to electrical cross coupling and phase modulation drift. Electrical cross coupling is caused by interference between modulation voltage and the photodetector. The cross-coupled signal produces spurious gyro bias and leads to a dead zone if it is larger than the input rate. Phase modulation drift as another dead zone source is due to the electrode contamination, the piezoelectric effect of the LiNbO3 substrate, or to organic fouling. This modulation drift lasts for a short or long period of time like a lead-lag filter response and produces gyro bias error, noise spikes, or dead zone. For a more detailed analysis, the cross-coupling effect and modulation phase drift are modeled as a filter and are simulated in both the open-loop and closed-loop modes.

The hydrophilicity, permeability and antifouling ability of the investigated membranes were evaluated in detail. It was found that the PSBMA chains brought highly-hydrophilic and strong fouling resistant characteristics to PVDF membranes due to the powerful hydration of zwitterionic surface.

A continuous filtration test using E. coli containing feedwater shows that the relative flux drop over GOQDs modified PVDF is 23%, which is significantly lower than those over pristine PVDF (86%) and GO-sheet modified PVDF (62%) after 10\u2009h of filtration. The presence of GOQD coating layer effectively inactivates E. coli and S. aureus cells, and prevents the biofilm formation on the membrane surface, producing excellent antimicrobial activity and potentially antibiofouling capability, more superior than those of previously reported two-dimensional GO sheets and one-dimensional CNTs modified membranes. The distinctive antimicrobial and antibiofouling performances could be attributed to the unique structure and uniform dispersion of GOQDs, enabling the exposure of a larger fraction of active edges and facilitating the formation of oxidation stress. Furthermore, GOQDs modified membrane possesses satisfying long-term stability and durability due to the strong covalent interaction between PVDF and GOQDs.

In each feedback scheme multiple mechanical modes of each oscillator can be cooled, and mode temperatures below 10 K are reached for the dominant mode, consistent with limits determined by the measurement noise of our system.

For each ejected droplet, a cell within the inkjet nozzle was observed to exhibit one of three possible behaviors which are termed: cell travel, cell ejection and cell reflection. Cell reflection is an undesirable phenomenon which may adversely affect an inkjet's capability in dispensing cells and a possible reason why it was previously reported that the rate of cells dispensed did not follow the expected Poisson distribution. Through the study of the cells motions, it was hypothesized that the rheological properties of the media in the cell suspension play an important role in influencing the cell behaviors exhibited. This was experimentally studied with the tracking of cells within the inkjet nozzle in a 10% w/v Ficoll PM400 cell suspension. The effect of cell reflection was eliminated using the higher density and viscosity Ficoll PM400 suspension.

Integration with PCB technology is highly desirable for affordable mass production. In addition, we systematically investigate the effects of electrodes with intervals in the range of 0.15 mm to 0.40 mm on the resultant PSS output voltage and current. The results show that at a strain of 0.5% and 5 Hz, a PSS with a gap interval 0.15 mm produces a maximum output voltage of 3 V and a maximum output current of 220 nA. Under the same dimensional constraints, the MNFs are massively connected in series (via accumulation of continuous MNFs across the gaps ) and in parallel (via accumulation of parallel MNFs on the same gap) simultaneously. Finally, encapsulation in a flexible polymer with different interval electrodes demonstrated that electrical superposition can be realized by connecting MNFs collectively and effectively in serial/parallel patterns to achieve a high current and high voltage output, respectively. Further improvement in PSSs based on the effect of cooperativity was experimentally realized by rolling-up the device into a cylindrical shape, resulting in a 130% increase in power output due to the cooperative effect. We assembled the piezoelectric MNF sensors on gloves, bandages and stockings to fabricate devices that can detect different types of human motion, including finger motion and various flexing and extensions of an ankle. The firmly glued PSSs were tested on the glove and ankle respectively to detect and harvest the various movements and the output voltage was recorded as \u223c1.5 V under jumping movement (one PSS) and \u223c4.5 V for the clenched fist with five fingers bent concurrently (five PSSs).

In particular, reducing the exposure or erosion of vaginal implants to obtain improved functional reconstruction is challenging. There is an urgent need for the development of new materials and/or products for POP treatment. A nanofibrous biomimetic mesh was recently developed to address this issue.\nIn this study, the basic properties of the newly developed mesh, including structural characteristics, mechanical properties, biological response of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, and tissue regeneration and biocompatibility in vivo, were evaluated and compared with those of Gynemesh\u2122PS.\nScanning electron microscopy and uniaxial tensile methods were used to evaluate microstructure and mechanical properties, respectively. Mesenchymal stem cell growth on the meshes was observed by fluorescence microscopy to visualize the expression of enhanced red fluorescent protein. Twenty-four mature female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1 (nanofibrous biomimetic mesh, Medprin, Germany, n=12) and group 2 (Gynemesh(TM)PS, Ethicon, USA; n=12). The posterior vaginal wall was incised from the introitus, and the mesh was then implanted. Three implants of each type were tested for 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Connective tissue organization, inflammation, vascularization, and regenerated tissue were histologically assessed.\nThe nanofibrous biomimetic mesh is a relatively heavy material and exhibited lower porosity than Gynemesh(TM)PS. The new mesh was stiffer than Gynemesh(TM)PS (p<0.001) but supported human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell attachment. Erosion of the grafts did not occur in any animal. The nanofibrous biomimetic mesh was encapsulated by a thicker layer of connective tissue and was associated with significantly greater inflammatory scores compared with Gynemesh(TM)PS. At 12 weeks, the vascularization of the new mesh was greater than that of Gynemesh(TM)PS (p<0.05). No significant difference in the thickness of the smooth muscle layer following implantation was observed between the two groups (p>0.05).\nThe nanofibrous biomimetic mesh is a candidate for reinforcing pelvic reconstruction. The mesh could be improved by decreasing its weight and stiffness and increasing its porosity.

{"title": "Numerical Characterization of Piezoceramics Using Resonance Curves.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials characterization is a challenging problem involving physical concepts, electrical and mechanical measurements and numerical optimization techniques. Piezoelectric ceramics such as Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) belong to the 6 mm symmetry class, which requires five elastic, three piezoelectric and two dielectric constants to fully represent the material properties. If losses are considered, the material properties can be represented by complex numbers. In this case, 20 independent material constants are required to obtain the full model. Several numerical methods have been used to adjust the theoretical models to the experimental results. The continuous improvement of the computer processing ability has allowed the use of a specific numerical method, the Finite Element Method (FEM), to iteratively solve the problem of finding the piezoelectric constants. This review presents the recent advances in the numerical characterization of 6 mm piezoelectric materials from experimental electrical impedance curves.

{"title": "Second harmonic generation microscopy reveals hidden polar organization in fluoride doped MIL-53(Fe).", "abstract": "Polar metal-organic frameworks have potential applications as functional non-linear optical, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric materials. Using second harmonic generation microscopy we found that fluoride doping of the microporous iron(iii) terephthalate MOF MIL-53(Fe) induces a polar organization in its structure, which was not previously detected with XRD. The polar order is only observed when both fluoride and guest molecules are present, and may be related to a complex interplay between the adsorbates and the framework, leading to a modification of the positioning of fluoride in the inorganic Fe-chains. Combined polarized second harmonic generation microscopy and scanning pyroelectric microscopy show that the polar axis is unidirectional and of the same sense over the whole crystal, extending up to 100 micrometers. This finding shows how MOF materials can be endowed with useful properties by doping MOFs with fluoride.", "journal": "Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)", "date": "2016-01-27", "authors": ["KarenMarkey", "TristanPutzeys", "PatriciaHorcajada", "ThomasDevic", "NathalieGuillou", "MichaelW\u00fcbbenhorst", "StijnVan Cleuvenbergen", "ThierryVerbiest", "Dirk EDe Vos", "Monique Avan der Veen"], "doi": "10.1039/c5dt04632g"}

The effects of mass ratio of driving electrode layer to film layer on the dispersion curve patterns and cut-off frequencies of the plane-strain waves were discussed in detail. Results show that the mass ratio does not change the trend of dispersion curves but larger mass ratio lowers corresponding frequency at a fixed wave number and may extend the frequency range for energy trapping.

In this study, we assessed the feasibility of a newly developed, piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet (ADPJ) for liver resection in a surviving swine model.\nTen domestic pigs underwent liver resection. Parenchymal transection and vessel skeletonization were performed using the ADPJ (group A, n = 5) or an ultrasonic aspirator (group U, n = 5). The water jet was applied at a frequency of 400 Hz and a driving voltage of 80 V. Physiological saline was supplied at a flow rate of 7 ml/min. After 7 days, the animals were killed and their short-term complications were examined and compared between the two groups.\nNo significant complications, such as massive bleeding, occurred in either group during the surgical procedures. The transection time per transection area was significantly shorter in group A than in group U (1.5 \u00b1 0.3 vs. 2.3 \u00b1 0.5 min/cm(2), respectively, P = 0.03). Blood loss per transection area was not significantly different between groups A and U (9.3 \u00b1 4.2 vs. 11.7 \u00b1 2.3 ml/cm(2), P = 0.6). All pigs in group A survived for 7 days. No postoperative bleeding or bile leakage was observed in any animal at necropsy.\nThe present results suggested that the ADPJ reduces transection time without increasing blood loss.

Interfacial and mechanical properties of PBX were investigated through molecular dynamics (MD) method, desensitizing mechanisms of fluorine-polymers for TKX-50 were researched by compression and bulk shear simulations. Results show that the binding energies (E bind ) between polymers (PVDF or PCTFE) and TKX-50 surfaces all rank in order of (011)\u2009>\u2009(100)\u2009>\u2009(010), shorter interatomic distance and the resulted higher potentials lead to higher E bind on TKX-50/PVDF interfaces than that on PCTFE/TKX-50 interfaces. Compared with TKX-50, the ductility of PBX is improved due to the isotropic mechanical property and flexibility of fluorine-polymers especially the PCTFE.

We analyze independently each type of loss and show the differences among them.

Frequently, material scientists and engineers use different languages, and the characteristic material coefficients do not have a straightforward translation to those specific electrical circuit components.

A series of fibers was produced from the same polymeric dope, in order to investigate the effect of selected spinning parameters, i.e., bore fluid composition and flowrate, on their properties. The morphology of the produced fibers was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Fibers were further characterized for their mechanical properties, porosity, bubble point, pore size distribution and pure water permeability (PWP). Some of the produced fibers exhibited high permeability (pure water permeability ~530 L/m\u00b2\u00b7h\u00b7bar), coupled to good mechanical resistance and pore size in the range of MF membranes.

Each bone sample received three implants of the same diameter using each of the techniques of piezosurgery and conventional twist drills. Time for preparation was taken and the temperature while performing the osteotomy was measured using infrared spectroscopy. The primary implant stability after osteotomy was measured using resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and extrusion torque (ET).

{"title": "Passive focusing techniques for piezoelectric air-coupled ultrasonic transducers.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel passive focusing system for Air-Coupled Ultrasonic (ACU) piezoelectric transducers which is inspired by the Newtonian-Cassegrain (NC) telescope concept. It consist of a primary spherical mirror with an output hole and a flat secondary mirror, normal to the propagation axis, that is the transducer surface itself. The device is modeled and acoustic field is calculated showing a collimated beam with a symmetrical focus. A prototype according to this design is built and tested with an ACU piezoelectric transducer with center frequency at 400 kHz, high-sensitivity, wideband and 25 mm diameter flat aperture. The acoustic field is measured and compared with calculations. The presented prototype exhibit a 1.5 mm focus width and a collimated beam up to 15 mm off the output hole. In addition, the performance of this novel design is compared, both theoretically and experimentally, with two techniques used before for electrostatic transducers: the Fresnel Zone Plate - FZP and the off-axis parabolic or spherical mirror. The proposed NC arrangement has a coaxial design, which eases the transducers positioning and use in many applications, and is less bulky than off-axis mirrors. Unlike in off-axis mirrors, it is now possible to use a spherical primary mirror with minimum aberrations. FZP provides a more compact solution and is easy to build, but presents some background noise due to interference of waves diffracted at out of focus regions. By contrast, off-axis parabolic mirrors provide a well defined focus and are free from background noise, although they are bulky and more difficult to build. Spherical mirrors are more easily built, but this yields a non symmetric beam and a poorly defined focus.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s EG\u00f3mez \u00c1lvarez-Arenas", "JorgeCamacho", "CarlosFritsch"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.01.001"}

This study presents a facile, rapid, in situ method to develop parahydrophobic coatings based on phase separation during photopolymerization. A comonomer resin of ethylene glycol diacrylate (EGDA) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate (PFDA) is modified with a thermoplastic additive (PVDF) to induce phase separation during polymerization. If applied to a glass substrate and photopolymerized, the EGDA/PFDA copolymer forms a homogeneous network with a single glass transition temperature (T(g)) and slight hydrophobicity (\u03b8(w) \u223c 114\u00b0). When the resin is modified with PVDF, phase separation occurs during photopolymerization producing a heterogeneous network with two T(g) values. The phase separation causes differences in composition and cross-link density within the network, which leads to local variations in polymerization shrinkage across the nonconstrained material interface. Domains with higher cross-link densities shrink and contract toward the bulk material more dramatically, permitting the formation of rough surfaces with submicron sized spheres enriched in PVDF dispersed in a continuous matrix of EGDA/PFDA copolymer. Both the surface roughness and hydrophobic components in the resin render these surfaces parahydrophobic with \u03b8(w) \u223c 150\u00b0, high water adhesion, and a similar morphology to rose petals observed in nature.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["Caroline RSzczepanski", "ThierryDarmanin", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricGuittard"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b10222"}

{"title": "Dynamic Electromechanical Coupling of Piezoelectric Bending Actuators.", "abstract": "Electromechanical coupling defines the ratio of electrical and mechanical energy exchanged during a flexure cycle of a piezoelectric actuator. This paper presents an analysis of the dynamic electromechanical coupling factor (dynamic EMCF) for cantilever based piezoelectric actuators and provides for the first time explicit expressions for calculation of dynamic EMCF based on arrangement of passive and active layers, layer geometry, and active and passive materials selection. Three main cantilever layer configurations are considered: unimorph, dual layer bimorph and triple layer bimorph. The actuator is modeled using standard constitutive dynamic equations that relate deflection and charge to force and voltage. A mode shape formulation is used for the cantilever dynamics that allows the generalized mass to be the actual mass at the first resonant frequency, removing the need for numerical integration in the design process. Results are presented in the form of physical insight from the model structure and also numerical evaluations of the model to provide trends in dynamic EMCF with actuator design parameters. For given material properties of the active and passive layers and given system overall damping ratio, the triple layer bimorph topology is the best in terms of theoretically achievable dynamic EMCF, followed by the dual layer bimorph. For a damping ratio of 0.035, the dynamic EMCF for an example dual layer bimorph configuration is 9% better than for a unimorph configuration. For configurations with a passive layer, the ratio of thicknesses for the passive and active layers is the primary geometric design variable. Choice of passive layer stiffness (Young's modulus) relative to the stiffness of the material in the active layer is an important materials related design choice. For unimorph configurations, it is beneficial to use the highest stiffness possible passive material, whereas for triple layer bimorph configurations, the passive material should have a low stiffness. In all cases, increasing the transverse electromechanical coupling coefficient of the active material improves the dynamic EMCF.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2016-01-20", "authors": ["Mostafa R ANabawy", "William JCrowther"], "doi": "10.3390/mi7010012\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/5/009\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.10.004\n10.1179/174367509X12447975734357\n10.1088/1748-3190/10/4/044002\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00249-6\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00552-5\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/2/304\n10.3233/JAE-140148\n10.1016/S0022-460X(02)01491-8\n10.1115/1.2890402\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009\n10.1109/84.311560\n10.1115/1.4001504\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055024\n10.1177/0959651814552810\n10.1109/58.764850\n10.1109/58.808857\n10.3989/cyv.2004.v43.i3.479\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2006.01.016\n10.1177/1045389X9700800205\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.02.065\n10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00178-0"}

{"title": "Steady State Response Analysis of a Tubular Piezoelectric Print Head.", "abstract": "In recent years, inkjet technology has played an important role in industrial materials printing and various sensors fabrication, but the mechanisms of the inkjet print head should be researched more elaborately. The steady state deformation analysis of a tubular piezoelectric print head, which can be classified as a plane strain problem because the radii of the tubes are considerably smaller than the lengths, is discussed in this paper. The geometric structure and the boundary conditions are all axisymmetric, so a one-dimensional mathematical model is constructed. By solving the model, the deformation field and stress field, as well as the electric potential distribution of the piezoelectric tube and glass tube, are obtained. The results show that the deformations are on the nanometer scale, the hoop stress is larger than the radial stress on the whole, and the potential is not linearly distributed along the radial direction. An experiment is designed to validate these computations.

{"title": "Surface modification of PVDF using non-mammalian sources of collagen for enhancement of endothelial cell functionality.", "abstract": "Although polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is non-toxic and stable in vivo, its hydrophobic surface has limited its bio-applications due to poor cell-material interaction and thrombus formation when used in blood contacting devices. In this study, surface modification of PVDF using naturally derived non-mammalian collagen was accomplished via direct surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerisation (SI-ATRP) to enhance its cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Results showed that Type I collagen was successfully extracted from fish scales and bullfrog skin. The covalent immobilisation of fish scale-derived collagen (FSCOL) and bullfrog skin-derived collagen (BFCOL) onto the PVDF surface improves the attachment and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, both FSCOL and BFCOL had comparable anti-thrombogenic profiles to that of commercially available bovine collagen (BVCOL). Also, cell surface expression of the leukocyte adhesion molecule was lower on HUVECs cultured on non-mammalian collagen surfaces than on BVCOL, which is an indication of lower pro-inflammatory response. Overall, results from this study demonstrated that non-mammalian sources of collagen could be used to confer bioactivity to PVDF, with comparable cell-material interactions and hemocompatibility to BVCOL. Additionally, higher expression levels of Type IV collagen in HUVECs cultured on FSCOL and BFCOL were observed as compared to BVCOL, which is an indication that the non-mammalian sources of collagen led to a better pro-angiogenic properties, thus making them suitable for blood contacting applications.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

We report a case of migration of a dental implant into the maxillary sinus, and discuss the benefits of its removal by a combination of endoscopically assisted and bone repositioning techniques.\nA 35-year-old Japanese man with a partially edentulous maxilla underwent implant placement at a private clinic. Three months later, at the time of abutment connection, the implant at the site of his maxillary right first molar was accidentally pushed into the sinus. The hole on the alveolar ridge made for placement of the implant was small and far from the dislocated implant, thus access was achieved in a transoral manner via the frontal wall of his maxillary sinus with an endoscopic approach. Piezoelectric instruments were used to perform an osteotomy. The bone lid was removed, and the implant was identified using a rigid endoscope and removed with a surgical aspirator, followed by repositioning of the bony segment; the area was secured with an absorbable suture. Removal of migrated implants should be considered in order to prevent possible sinusal disease complications.\nIn the present case, removal of a dental implant displaced into the maxillary sinus by use of a combination of endoscopically assisted and bone repositioning techniques proved to be a safe and reliable procedure.", "journal": "Journal of medical case reports", "date": "2016-01-14", "authors": ["ShinnosukeNogami", "KensukeYamauchi", "YujiTanuma", "KenjiOdashima", "AritsuneMatsui", "KenkoTanaka", "TetsuTakahashi"], "doi": "10.1186/s13256-015-0787-1\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2011.02417.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2007.01489.x\n10.1563/AAID-JOI-D-12-00206\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2007.01409.x\n10.1007/s10006-010-0243-8\n10.1620/tjem.180.27\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e3182710393\n10.1054/ijom.2003.0470\n10.1016/j.joms.2005.05.304"}

Finally, an output power enhancement of ten times was obtained.

Mechanical switching has been reported recently in ~5\u2009nm BaTiO3 and PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 epitaxial films; however it is still a challenge for a mechanical force to switch polarization of a slightly thicker film in the same way as an electric field. Here, we report that the polarization of a 70\u2009nm BiFeO3 epitaxial film can be completely switched by a mechanical force, and its domain evolution is similar to that observed with electrical switching. With the gradual increase of the field/force, new domains nucleate preferentially at domain boundaries, the \u03bcm-size domains commonly decompose to a mass of nm-size domains, and finally they may reorganize to \u03bcm-size domains which undergo 180(\u00b0) polarization switching through multi steps. Importantly, the complete mechanical switching of polarization was also established in the (0 0 1) film with a smooth surface. Furthermore, either upward or downward polarization can be read out nondestructively by a constant current.

{"title": "Energy barriers for dipole moment flipping in PVDF-related ferroelectric polymers.", "abstract": "Energy barriers for flipping the transverse dipole moments in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and related copolymers and terpolymers are predicted using the nudged elastic band method. The dipole moments flip individually along the chain, with an order and energy barrier magnitudes (0.1-1.2 eV) that depend on the chain composition and environment. Trifluoroethylene (TrFE) and chlorofluoroethylene (CFE) monomers have larger energy barriers than VDF monomers, while a chain in an amorphous environment has a similar transition pathway as that of an isolated molecule. In a crystalline environment, TrFE and CFE monomers expand the lattice and lower the energy barriers for flipping VDF monomers. This finding is consistent with experimental observations of a large electrocaloric effect in P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) terpolymers.", "journal": "The Journal of chemical physics", "date": "2016-01-10", "authors": ["Ying-JuYu", "Alan J HMcGaughey"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4939152"}
{"title": "Effects of Nanoporous Anodic Alumina Oxide on the Crystallization and Melting Behavior of Poly(vinylidene fluoride).", "abstract": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanotubes were fabricated by melt-wetting into porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates with two different interfacial properties: one is pristine AAO, and the other is modified by FOTS (AAO-F). Their crystallization and melting behaviors are compared with those of a bulk sample. For the PVDF in AAO-F, the nonisothermal crystallization temperature is slightly lower than that of bulk, and the melting temperature is similar to that of bulk. For the PVDF in pristine AAO, when the pore diameter is 200 nm, the crystallization is induced by two kinds of nucleation: heterogeneous nucleation and interface-induced nucleation. On the contrary, in the AAO template with pore diameter smaller than 200 nm, only interface-induced nucleation occurs. The melting temperature of PVDF crystals in the pristine AAO is much higher than that of bulk which can be attributed to the presence of an interfacial layer of PVDF on the template inner surface. The interaction between PVDF and AAO template produces the interfacial layer. Such an interfacial layer plays an important role in enhancing the melting temperature of PVDF crystals. The higher melting peak is always observed when the PVDF is nonisothermally crystallized in the AAO template irrespective of the thermal erasing temperature suggesting the interfacial layer is very stable on the AAO template surface. If the PVDF nanostructures are released from AAO template, the higher melting peak disappears with the enhancement of thermal erasing temperature.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

We report the fabrication of a high-performance flexible piezoelectric microgenerator based on lead-free inorganic piezoelectric Na0.47K0.47Li0.06NbO3 (NKLN) microcubes for the first time. The composite generator is fabricated using NKLN microcubes and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer on a flexible substrate. The flexible device exhibits excellent performance with a large recordable piezoelectric output voltage of 48 V and output current density of 0.43 \u03bcA/cm(2) under vertical compressive force of 2 kgf, for which an energy conversion efficiency of about 11% has been achieved. Piezoresponse and ferroelectric studies reveal that NKLN microcubes exhibited high piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) as high as 460 pC/N and a well-defined hysteresis loops with remnant polarization and coercive field of 13.66 \u03bcC/cm(2) and 19.45 kV/cm, respectively. The piezoelectric charge generation mechanism from NKLN microgenerator are discussed in the light of the high d33 and alignment of electric dipoles in polymer matrix and dielectric constant of NKLN microcubes.

Distinct relations were obtained between the AFM force spectroscopy measurements and calculated fouling resistance over the concentration polarization layer (CPL) and gel layer (GL). The measured maximum adhesion forces (Fad,max) were closely correlated with the CPL resistance (Rp), and the proposed molecular packing property (largely based on the shape of AFM force spectroscopy curve) of the APAM chains was related to the GL resistance (Rg). Calcium ions (Ca(2+)) and sodium ions (Na(+)) caused more severe fouling. In the presence of Ca(2+), the large Rp corresponded to high foulant-foulant Fad,max, resulting in high flux loss. In addition, the Rg with Ca(2+) was minor, but the flux recovery rate after chemical cleaning was the lowest, indicating that Ca(2+) created more challenges in GL cleaning. With Na(+), the fouling behavior was complicated and concentration-dependent. The GL structures with Na(+), which might correspond to the proposed molecular packing states among APAM chains, played essential roles in membrane fouling and GL cleaning.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2016-01-07", "authors": ["GuicaiLiu", "ShuiliYu", "HaijunYang", "JunHu", "YiZhang", "BoHe", "LeiLi", "ZhiyuanLiu"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.5b04098"}

Working with brown rats, Rattus norvegicus, as a model species, our overall objective was to test whether sound cues from pups could be developed as a means to enhance captures of rats in trap boxes.\nRecording vocalizations from three-day-old pups after removal from their natal nest with both sonic and ultrasonic microphones revealed frequency components in the sonic range (1.8-7.5 kHz) and ultrasonic range (18-24 kHz, 33-55 kHz, 60-96 kHz). In two-choice laboratory bioassays, playback recordings of these vocalizations induced significant phonotactic and arrestment responses by juvenile, subadult and adult female and male rats. The effectiveness of engineered 'synthetic' rat pup sounds was dependent upon their frequency components, sound durations and the sound delivery system. Unlike other speakers, a piezoelectric transducer emitting sound bursts of 21 kHz with a 63-KHz harmonic, and persisting for 20-300 ms, proved highly effective in attracting and arresting adult female rats. In a field experiment, a battery-powered electronic device fitted with a piezoelectric transducer and driven by an algorithm that randomly generated sound cues resembling those recorded from rat pups and varying in fundamental frequency (19-23 kHz), duration (20-300 ms) and intermittent silence (300-5000 ms) significantly enhanced captures of rats in trap boxes baited with a food lure and soiled bedding material of adult female rats.\nOur study provides proof of concept that rat-specific sound cues or signals can be effectively reproduced and deployed as a means to enhance capture of wild rats. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.", "journal": "Pest management science", "date": "2016-01-07", "authors": ["StephenTak\u00e1cs", "PawelKowalski", "GerhardGries"], "doi": "10.1002/ps.4219"}

Nonetheless, the mechanisms of polarization and strain coupling between grains of different nature in the composites remain unclear. To rationalize the coupling mechanisms we performed advanced piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) studies of 0.92BNT-0.06BT-0.02KNN/0.93BNT-0.07BT (ergodic/non-ergodic relaxor) composites. PFM is able to distinguish grains of different phases by characteristic domain patterns. Polarization switching has been probed locally, on a sub-grain scale. k-Means clustering analysis applied to arrays of local hysteresis loops reveals variations of polarization switching characteristics between the ergodic and non-ergodic relaxor grains.

Office inkjet printers can be used to generate flexible designs of functional materials on substrates on a large scale and in an inexpensive manner. Although creating patterns of conjugated polymers on paper using common office inkjet printers has been reported, only a few examples exist, such as polyaniline (PANI) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), because only water-compatible inks can be utilized. Herein, we describe the production of poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) patterns on paper by employing a reactive inkjet printing (RIJ) method. In this process, printing of a hydrophilic terephthaldehyde, bis(triphenylphosphonium salt) and potassium t-butoxide using a common office inkjet printer leads to formation PPV patterns as a consequence of an in situ Wittig reaction. In addition, microarrayed PPV patterns are also readily generated on solid substrates, such as glass and PDMS, when a piezoelectric dispenser system is employed. The in situ prepared PPV was found to be insoluble in water and chloroform. As a result, unreacted excess reagents and byproducts can be efficiently removed by washing with these solvents.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-01-06", "authors": ["SeonghoJeon", "SuminPark", "JihyeNam", "YoungjongKang", "Jong-ManKim"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b09705"}

We observe a strong quenching in the photoluminescence associated with the dissociation and spatial separation of electrons-holes quasi-particles at low applied acoustic powers. At the same applied powers, we note a relative preference for ionization of trions into excitons. This work also constitutes the first visual presentation of the surface displacement in one-layered MoS2 using laser Doppler vibrometry. Such observations are associated with the acoustically generated electric field arising from the piezoelectric nature of MoS2 for odd-numbered layers. At larger applied powers, the thermal effect dominates the behavior of the two-dimensional flakes.

DMN are routinely fabricated by dispensing liquid formulations into microneedle-shaped moulds. The liquid formulation within the mould is then dried to create dissolvable vaccine-loaded microneedles. The precision of the dispensing process is critical to the control of formulation volume loaded into each dissolvable microneedle structure. The dispensing process employed must maintain vaccine integrity. Wetting of mould surfaces by the dispensed formulation is also an important consideration for the fabrication of sharp-tipped DMN. Sharp-tipped DMN are essential for ease of percutaneous administration. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of a piezoelectric dispensing system to dispense picolitre formulation volumes into PDMS moulds enabling the fabrication of bilayer DMN. The influence of formulation components (trehalose and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) content) and piezoelectric actuation parameters (voltage, frequency and back pressure) on drop formation is described. The biological integrity of a seasonal influenza vaccine following dispensing was investigated and maintained voltage settings of 30 V but undermined at higher settings, 50 and 80 V. The results demonstrate the capability of piezoelectric dispensing technology to precisely fabricate bilayer DMN. They also highlight the importance of identifying formulation and actuation parameters to ensure controlled droplet formulation and vaccine stabilisation.", "journal": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "date": "2016-01-02", "authors": ["Evin AAllen", "ConorO'Mahony", "MichaelCronin", "ThomasO'Mahony", "Anne CMoore", "Abina MCrean"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2015.12.052"}

However, the response of carriers in QDMs to an in-plane (lateral) electric field remains largely unexplored. We computationally explore spin-mixing interactions in the molecular states of single holes confined in vertically stacked InAs/GaAs QDMs using atomistic tight-binding simulations. We systematically investigate QDMs with different geometric structure parameters and local piezoelectric fields. We observe both a relatively large Stark shift and a change in the Zeeman splitting as the magnitude of the lateral electric field increases. Most importantly, we observe that lateral electric fields induce hole-spin mixing with a magnitude that increases with increasing lateral electric field over a moderate range. These results suggest that applied lateral electric fields could be used to fine tune and manipulate, ", "journal": "Physical review.

Chewing has been used in wearable sensor systems for the automatic detection of food intake, but little work has been reported on the automatic measurement of chew count or chewing rate. This work presents a method for the automatic quantification of chewing episodes captured by a piezoelectric sensor system. The proposed method was tested on 120 meals from 30 participants using two approaches. In a semi-automatic approach, histogram-based peak detection was used to count the number of chews in manually annotated chewing segments, resulting in a mean absolute error of 10.40% \u00b1 7.03%. In a fully automatic approach, automatic food intake recognition preceded the application of the chew counting algorithm. The sensor signal was divided into 5-s non-overlapping epochs.

In doing this, a new model was developed where the two components of the HNWs were modeled as Euler beams coupled via the interphase vdW interaction. Based on the model, the dependence of the frequency on an applied electrical voltage was calculated for HNWs of different geometric sizes to reveal the voltage effect. The results were then compared with those calculated without considering the inter-phase vdW interaction.

{"title": "A Flexible 360-Degree Thermal Sound Source Based on Laser Induced Graphene.", "abstract": "A flexible sound source is essential in a whole flexible system. It's hard to integrate a conventional sound source based on a piezoelectric part into a whole flexible system. Moreover, the sound pressure from the back side of a sound source is usually weaker than that from the front side. With the help of direct laser writing (DLW) technology, the fabrication of a flexible 360-degree thermal sound source becomes possible. A 650-nm low-power laser was used to reduce the graphene oxide (GO).

The adsorption of human adenovirus 2 (HAdV-2) on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and a major membrane foulant, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), were measured in a quartz crystal microbalance. In 3-100mM CaCl2 solutions, irreversible adsorption of HAdV-2 was observed on both pristine and EPS-fouled PVDF surfaces. The HAdV-2 adsorption kinetics was successfully fitted with the random sequential adsorption (RSA) model. The applicability of the RSA model for HAdV-2 adsorption is confirmed by comparing the two fitting parameters, adsorption rate constant k(a) and area occupied by each adsorbed HAdV-2 particle a, with experimentally measured parameters. A linear correlation between the fitting parameter k(a) and the measured attachment efficiency was found, suggesting that the RSA model correctly describes the interaction forces dominating the HAdV-2 adsorption. By comparing the fitting parameter d(ads) with the hydrodynamic diameter of HAdV-2, we conclude that virus-virus and virus-surface interactions determine the area occupied by each adsorbed HAdV-2 particle, and thus influence the adsorption capacity.

The transducer is a Langevin type transducer which is composed of an exponential horn, four groups of PZT ceramics and a back beam. The exponential horn can focus the vibration energy, and can enlarge vibration amplitude and velocity efficiently. A bending vibration model of the transducer is first constructed, and subsequently an electromechanical coupling model is constructed based on the vibration model. In order to obtain the most suitable excitation position of the PZT ceramics, the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient is optimized by means of the quadratic interpolation method. When the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient reaches the peak value of 42.59%, the optimal excitation position (L1=22.52 mm) is found. The FEM method and the experimental method are used to validate the developed analytical model. Two groups of the FEM model (the Group A center bolt is not considered, and but the Group B center bolt is considered) are constructed and separately compared with the analytical model and the experimental model. Four prototype transducers around the peak value are fabricated and tested to validate the analytical model.

{"title": "The effect of PVDF-TrFE scaffolds on stem cell derived cardiovascular cells.", "abstract": "Recently, electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) scaffolds have been developed for tissue engineering applications. These materials have piezoelectric activity, wherein they can generate electric charge with minute mechanical deformations. Since the myocardium is an electroactive tissue, the unique feature of a piezoelectric scaffold is attractive for cardiovascular tissue engineering applications. In this study, we examined the cytocompatibility and function of pluripotent stem cell derived cardiovascular cells including mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (mES-CM) and endothelial cells (mES-EC) on PVDF-TrFE scaffolds. MES-CM and mES-EC adhered well to PVDF-TrFE and became highly aligned along the fibers. When cultured on scaffolds, mES-CM spontaneously contracted, exhibited well-registered sarcomeres and expressed classic cardiac specific markers such as myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, and connexin43. Moreover, mES-CM cultured on PVDF-TrFE scaffolds responded to exogenous electrical pacing and exhibited intracellular calcium handling behavior similar to that of mES-CM cultured in 2D. Similar to cardiomyocytes, mES-EC also demonstrated high viability and maintained a mature phenotype through uptake of low-density lipoprotein and expression of classic endothelial cell markers including platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and the arterial specific marker, Notch-1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of PVDF-TrFE scaffold as a candidate material for developing engineered cardiovascular tissues utilizing stem cell-derived cells. Biotechnol.

Although lattice strain induced charge separation was theoretically proposed, it has not been experimentally investigated for wurtzite structured ZnO nanomaterials. Tuning the lattice strain from compressive to tensile state along the ZnO c-axis can be achieved by a substitution of halogen dopant from fluorine to other halogen elements due to the ionic size difference between dopants and oxygen. With its focus on a group of nonmetal element induced lattice strain in ZnO-based nanomaterials, this work paves the way for enhancing the performance of wurtzite-type piezoelectric semiconductor nanomaterials via lattice strain strategy which can be employed to construct piezoelectric nanodevices with higher efficiency in a cost-effective manner.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-12-26", "authors": ["YangZhang", "CaihongLiu", "JingbinLiu", "JieXiong", "JingyuLiu", "KeZhang", "YudongLiu", "MingzengPeng", "AifangYu", "AihuaZhang", "YanZhang", "ZhiweiWang", "JunyiZhai", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b10345"}

In this work, we studied nonlinear dielectric properties of a biaxially oriented poly(vinylidene fluoride) (BOPVDF) film under both low and high electric fields. For fundamental nonlinear dielectric constants at low fields (<30 MV/m), Novocontrol high-voltage broadband dielectric spectroscopy (HVBDS) was accurate enough to measure up to the third harmonics. It was observed that the low-field dielectric nonlinearity for the BOPVDF disappeared above 10 Hz at room temperature, suggesting that the low-field dielectric nonlinearity originated from ionic migration of impurity ions rather than dipolar relaxation of the amorphous segments. Above the coercive field (EC \u2248 70 MV/m), bipolar electric displacement-electric field (D-E) loop tests were used to extract the nonlinear behavior for pure PVDF crystals, which had a clear origin of ferroelectric switching of polar crystalline dipoles and domains and nonpolar-to-polar (\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b4 \u2192 \u03b2) phase transformations. By using HVBDS, it was observed that the ferroelectric switching of polar crystalline dipoles and domains in BOPVDF above the EC always took place between 20 and 500 Hz regardless of a broad range of temperature from -30 to 100 \u00b0C.

There remains the possibility to correct the deformations using thin patches that exert a tangential strain on the rear side of the mirror: some research groups are already at work on this approach.

However, the traditional FETs are controlled by an externally supplied gate voltage, which may not be sensitive enough to directly interface with a mechanical stimulus for applications in electronic skin. Here we report a type of top-pressure/force-gated field effect transistors (PGFETs) based on a hybrid structure of a 2D MoS2 flake and 1D ZnO nanowire (NW) array. Once an external pressure is applied, the piezoelectric polarization charges created at the tips of ZnO NWs grown on MoS2 act as a gate voltage to tune/control the source-drain transport property in MoS2. At a 6.25 MPa applied stimulus on a packaged device, the source-drain current can be tuned for \u223c25%, equivalent to the results of applying an extra -5 V back gate voltage.

Here, we developed a flexible and self-powered GaN membrane-based ultraviolet (UV) photoswitch with high on/off ratio and excellent sensitivity. Even without any power supply, the driving force of UV photogenerated carriers can be well boosted by the combination of both built-in electric field and piezoelectric polarization field. The asymmetric metal-semiconductor-metal structure has been elaborately utilized to enhance the carrier separation and transport for highly sensitive UV photoresponse. Its UV on/off ratio and detection sensitivity reach to 4.67 \u00d7 10(5) and 1.78 \u00d7 10(12) cm\u00b7Hz(0.5) W(1-), respectively. Due to its excellent mechanical flexibility, the piezoelectric polarization field in GaN membrane can be easily tuned/controlled based on piezo-phototronic effect. Under 1% strain, a stronger and broader depletion region can be obtained to further enhance UV on/off ratio up to 154%.

We used a contactless under-the-mattress PS to monitor physiological vibrations resulting from breathing, pumping of the heart, and body movements, among individuals at home following hospitalization for heart failure (HF). Our objectives were to assess acceptability of the device in the home, to assess physiological patterns, and to determine if altered patterns correlate with readmission. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study of 30 patients discharged home following HF hospitalization. PS data included a continuous nightly assessment of heart rate, respiration rate, movement rate, rapid and shallow respiration duration, and a behaviour score. We utilized random forest classification to classify average nightly data by readmission status. Results We collected 640 nights of PS data from 29 patients. There were nine readmissions, of which four were for HF. PS monitoring was tolerated by all but one of the participants. We inspected continuous nightly physiological profiles and noted differences between patients who were and were not readmitted. Patients readmitted for HF had higher average heart and respiration rates, and more respiration variability. Average nightly respiratory rate was most predictive of readmission. Discussion We are the first to study nocturnal physiological patterns of HF patients at home using a contactless under-the-mattress monitoring system. We noted patterns that may be unique to patients at risk for readmission due to HF. Respiratory rate was the most important risk-adjusted associate of readmission for HF. Further studies should investigate the efficacy of home PS monitoring in HF populations.", "journal": "Journal of telemedicine and telecare", "date": "2015-12-17", "authors": ["Mosi KBennett", "MingyuanShao", "Eiran ZGorodeski"], "doi": "10.1177/1357633X15618810"}

{"title": "The performance characteristics of a piezoelectric ultrasonic dental scaler.", "abstract": "The objective of this work was to investigate the performance characteristics of a piezoelectric ultrasonic dental scaler using scanning laser vibrometry. The vibration characteristics of three standard piezoelectric tips were assessed with scanning laser vibrometry under various conditions: unconstrained, under a stream of flowing water, in a water tank, as well as subjected to loads to simulate clinical conditions. Subsequently, the tips were used to disrupt an in-vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, developed using a non-pathogenic Gram-negative species of Serratia (NCIMB40259). The laser vibrometry data showed that the oscillation pattern of the ultrasonic tip depends primarily on its shape and design, as well as on the generator power. Thin tips and high power settings induce the highest vibrations. Water irrigation of the tip and loads influence the tip performance by diminishing its vibration, while water volume increases it. Serratia biofilm was disrupted by the cavitation bubbles occurring around the scaler tip. The most effective biofilm removal occurred with the thinner tip. Understanding how the ultrasonic tip oscillates when in use and how it removes dental plaque is essential for gaining more knowledge regarding the cleaning mechanisms of the ultrasonic system. Cavitation may be used to remove plaque and calculus without a mechanical contact between the dental tip and the teeth. Better knowledge would enable dental specialists to understand and improve their techniques during routine cleaning of teeth. It will also lead to improving tip design and to the production of more effective instruments for clinical use.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["EPecheva", "R LSammons", "A DWalmsley"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2015.10.008"}

For this purpose, we explored the well-ordered array of isolated epitaxial BiFeO3/CoFe2O4/SrRuO3 heterostructured nanodots fabricated by nanoporous anodic alumina (AAO) template method. The arrayed heterostructured nanodots demonstrate well-established epitaxial structures and coexistence of piezoelectric and ferromagnetic properties, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and peizoeresponse/magnetic force microscopy (PFM/MFM). It was found that the heterostructured nanodots yield apparent ME coupling, likely due to the effective transfer of interface couplings along with the substantial release of substrate clamping. A noticeable change in piezoelectric response of the nanodots can be triggered by magnetic field, indicating a substantial enhancement of ME coupling. Moreover, an electric field induced magnetization switching in these nanodots can be observed, showing a large reverse ME effect.

With recent developments in the field of microscale actuation, there is increasing interest in replicating the functions available to conventional fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) flow cytometry in integrated on-chip systems, which have substantial advantages in cost and portability. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are ideal for many acoustofluidic applications, and have been used to perform such sorting at rates on the order of kHz. Essential to the accuracy of this sorting, however, is the dimensions of the region over which sorting occurs, where a smaller sorting region can largely avoid inaccurate sorting across a range of sample concentrations. Here we demonstrate the use of flow focusing and a highly focused SAW generated by a high-frequency (386 MHz), 10 \u03bcm wavelength set of focused interdigital transducers (FIDTs) on a piezoelectric lithium niobate substrate, yielding an effective sorting region only ~25 \u03bcm wide, with sub-millisecond pulses generated at up to kHz rates. Furthermore, because of the use of high frequencies, actuation of particles as small as 2 \u03bcm can be realized.

The influences of initial stress on the dispersive relation are considered based on the incremental stress theory. First, the incremental stress theory of elastic solid is extended to the magneto-electro-elasto solid. The governing equations, constitutive equations, and boundary conditions of the incremental stresses in a magneto-electro-elasto solid are derived with consideration of the existence of initial stresses. Then, the transfer matrices of a pre-stressed piezoelectric slab and a pre-stressed piezomagnetic slab are formulated, respectively. The total transfer matrix of a single cell in the phononic crystal is obtained by the multiplication of two transfer matrixes related with two adjacent slabs. Furthermore, the Bloch theorem is used to obtain the dispersive equations of in-plane and anti-plane Bloch waves. The dispersive equations are solved numerically and the numerical results are shown graphically. The oblique propagation and the normal propagation situations are both considered. In the case of normal propagation of elastic waves, the analytical expressions of the dispersion equation are derived and compared with other literatures.

These resonances vanish under thermal anneal in monodomain crystals while they remain stable in periodically poled samples with high domain wall densities. The low activation energy of 0.18\u2009eV suggests their electronic (bi-polaronic) origin. Resonant piezoelectric spectroscopy, RPS, shows two features in virgin samples: a relaxation peak at 420\u2009K and a rapid hardening when the sample was slowly heated to ~500\u2009K. The dynamic relaxation and the hardening are related to excitations and reorientations of Li defects. The relaxations and hardening are irreversibly suppressed by high temperature anneal. We do not observe domain wall related RPS resonances in annealed samples, which excludes the existence of highly charged walls. We suggest that domain walls stabilize polaronic states with (bi-)polarons located inside or near to the ferroelectric domain walls.", "journal": "Journal of physics.

{"title": "The mechano-gated channel inhibitor GsMTx4 reduces the exercise pressor reflex in decerebrate rats.", "abstract": "Mechanical and metabolic stimuli from contracting muscles evoke reflex increases in blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity. Little is known, however, about the nature of the mechano-gated channels on the thin fibre muscle afferents that contribute to evoke this reflex, termed the exercise pressor reflex. We determined the effect of GsMTx4, an inhibitor of mechano-gated Piezo channels, on the exercise pressor reflex evoked by intermittent contraction of the triceps surae muscles in decerebrated, unanaesthetized rats. GsMTx4 reduced the pressor, cardioaccelerator and renal sympathetic nerve responses to intermittent contraction but did not reduce the pressor responses to femoral arterial injection of compounds that stimulate the metabolically-sensitive thin fibre muscle afferents. Expression levels of Piezo2 channels were greater than Piezo1 channels in rat dorsal root ganglia. Our findings suggest that mechanically-sensitive Piezo proteins contribute to the generation of the mechanical component of the exercise pressor reflex in rats. Mechanical and metabolic stimuli within contracting skeletal muscles evoke reflex autonomic and cardiovascular adjustments. In cats and rats, gadolinium has been used to investigate the role played by the mechanical component of this reflex, termed the exercise pressor reflex. Gadolinium, however, has poor selectivity for mechano-gated channels and exerts multiple off-target effects. We tested the hypothesis that GsMTX4, a more selective mechano-gated channel inhibitor than gadolinium and a particularly potent inhibitor of mechano-gated Piezo channels, reduced the exercise pressor reflex in decerebrate rats. Injection of 10 \u03bcg of GsMTx4 into the arterial supply of the hindlimb reduced the peak pressor (control: 24 \u00b1 5, GsMTx4: 12 \u00b1 5 mmHg, P < 0.01), cardioaccelerator and renal sympathetic nerve responses to tendon stretch, a purely mechanical stimulus, but had no effect on the pressor responses to intra-arterial injection of \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP or lactic acid. Moreover, injection of 10 \u03bcg of GsMTx4 into the arterial supply of the hindlimb reduced the peak pressor (control: 24 \u00b1 2, GsMTx4: 14 \u00b1 3 mmHg, P < 0.01), cardioaccelerator and renal sympathetic nerve responses to electrically-induced intermittent hindlimb muscle contractions. By contrast, injection of 10 \u03bcg of GsMTx4 into the jugular vein had no effect on the pressor, cardioaccelerator, or renal sympathetic nerve responses to contraction. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses indicated that both Piezo1 and Piezo2 channel isoforms were natively expressed in rat dorsal root ganglia tissue. We conclude that GsMTx4 reduced the exercise pressor reflex in decerebrate rats and that the reduction was attributable, at least in part, to its effect on mechano-gated Piezo channels.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2015-11-27", "authors": ["Steven WCopp", "Joyce SKim", "VictorRuiz-Velasco", "Marc PKaufman"], "doi": "10.1113/JP271714"}
{"title": "Tyrosinase immobilized on a hydrophobic membrane.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane surfaces were ad hoc functionalized chemically to make them suitable for enzymatic immobilization. The process was performed by grafting the membrane surface with 1,4-diaminobutane and subsequently by activating it with glutarhaldehyde. The chemico-physical properties of the original PVDF membrane and of the modified membranes were studied by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and static contact angle measurements. The activated membranes were used as a support for covalent immobilization of tyrosinase. The activity of free and immobilized enzyme was studied and compared. The experimental data showing the specific activity of the immobilized enzyme are similar to the value obtained with the free one. This means that the immobilization procedure did not alter the catalytic properties of the tyrosinase. In addition, the surface modification of the PVDF made it a promising material to use in enzyme or biomolecule immobilization processes.", "journal": "Biotechnology and applied biochemistry", "date": "2015-11-27", "authors": ["CatiaAlgieri", "LauraDonato", "LidiettaGiorno"], "doi": "10.1002/bab.1462"}
{"title": "Effect of sonic stimulation on Bacillus endospore germination.", "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of sonic stimulation on Bacillus endospore germination. Germinating endospores in a microtiter plate were exposed to audible sound wave generated by an array of piezoelectric transducers. In situ germination kinetics was measured by terbium-dipicolinate fluorescence assay, optical density measurement and phase contrast microscopy. Fluorescence results revealed that sonic stimulation (5 kHz at 90 dB) promoted the germination speed by 43.7%\u00a0\u00b1 11.3% and final germination level by 61.7% \u00b1 11.9% of Bacillus atrophaeus. This acoustic energy absorbed by endospores is postulated to change membrane permeability and increase enzyme activities; thereby, expediting the germination process. This also raises the likelihood of dormant endospores undergoing germination because of a rapid release of unidentified chemical mediators for quorum sensing. On the other hand, acoustic effect was not observed in B. subtilis endospores. This may be attributed to the different spore aspect ratio, 1.43 \u00b1 0.05 for B. atrophaeus and 2.02 \u00b1 0.08 for B. subtilis, which results in a difference in specific absorption rates towards audible sound waves.

VISTA is based on a micro-thermogravimetry technique, widely used in different environments to study absorption and sublimation processes. The instrument core is a piezoelectric crystal microbalance, whose frequency variations are affected by variations of the mass of the deposited sample, due to chemical processes such as sublimation, condensation or absorption/desorption. The low mass (i.e. 40\u00a0g), the low volume (less than 10 cm(3)) and the low power (less than 1\u00a0W) required makes this kind of instrument very suitable for space missions.

To understand the origin of such a fruitful outcome from this type of polar/non-polar heterophase structure, comprehensive studies are conducted, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and finite element method (FEM) analyses. The TEM results show that the polar/non-polar composite has a core/shell structure in which the polar phase (core) is surrounded by a non-polar phase (shell). In situ electrical biasing TEM experiments visualize that the ferroelectric domains in the polar core are aligned even under an electric field of \u223c1 kV mm(-1), which is much lower than its intrinsic coercive field (\u223c3 kV mm(-1)). From the FEM analyses, we can find that the enhanced polarization of the polar phase is promoted by an additional internal field at the phase boundary which originates from the preferential polarization of the relaxor-like non-polar phase.

Backing blocks contain scatterers such as alumina particles interspersed in the epoxy matrix for the effective scattering and attenuation of ultrasound. Here, the surface integrity can be an issue, where the composite material may be damaged during machining because of differences in strength, hardness and brittleness of the hard alumina particles and the soft epoxy matrix. Poor surface integrity results in the formation of air cavities between the backing block and the piezoelectric element upon assembly, hence the increased reflection off the backing block and the eventual degradation in image quality. Furthermore, with an issue of poor surface integrity due to machining, it is difficult to increase alumina as scatterers more than a specific mass fraction ratio. In this study, we increased the portion of alumina within epoxy matrix by obtaining an enhanced surface integrity using a net shape fabrication method, and verified that this method could allow us to achieve higher ultrasonic attenuation.

A comparison of the microphone, cannula and piezoelectric sensor.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare to each other the methods currently recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) to measure snoring: an acoustic sensor, a piezoelectric sensor and a nasal pressure transducer (cannula). Ten subjects reporting habitual snoring were included in the study, performed at Landspitali-University Hospital, Iceland. Snoring was assessed by listening to the air medium microphone located on a patient's chest, compared to listening to two overhead air medium microphones (stereo) and manual scoring of a piezoelectric sensor and nasal cannula vibrations. The chest audio picked up the highest number of snore events of the different snore sensors. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of scoring snore events from the different sensors was compared to the chest audio: overhead audio (0.78, 0.98), cannula (0.55, 0.67) and piezoelectric sensor (0.78, 0.92), respectively. The chest audio was capable of detecting snore events with lower volume and higher fundamental frequency than the other sensors. The 200 Hz sampling rate of the cannula and piezoelectric sensor was one of their limitations for detecting snore events. The different snore sensors do not measure snore events in the same manner. This lack of consistency will affect future research on the clinical significance of snoring. Standardization of objective snore measurements is therefore needed. Based on this paper, snore measurements should be audio-based and the use of the cannula as a snore sensor be discontinued, but the piezoelectric sensor could possibly be modified for improvement.", "journal": "Journal of sleep research", "date": "2015-11-11", "authors": ["Erna SArnardottir", "BardurIsleifsson", "Jon SAgustsson", "Gunnar ASigurdsson", "Magdalena OSigurgunnarsdottir", "Gudjon TSigur\u0111arson", "GudmundurSaevarsson", "Atli TSveinbjarnarson", "SveinbjornHoskuldsson", "ThorarinnGislason"], "doi": "10.1111/jsr.12356"}
{"title": "Guided torsional wave generation of a linear in-plane shear piezoelectric array in metallic pipes.", "abstract": "Cylindrical guided waves based techniques are effective and promising tools for damage detection in long pipes. The essential operations are generation and reception of guided waves in the structures utilizing transducers. A novel in-plane shear (d36 type) PMNT wafer is proposed to generate and receive the guided wave, especially the torsional waves, in metallic pipes. In contrast to the traditional wafer, this wafer will directly introduce in-plane shear deformation when electrical field is conveniently applied through its thickness direction. A single square d36 PMNT wafer is bonded on the surface of the pipe positioned collinearly with its axis, when actuated can predominantly generate torsional (T) waves along the axial direction, circumferential shear horizontal (C-SH) waves along circumferential direction, and other complex cylindrical Lamb-like wave modes along other helical directions simultaneously. While a linear array of finite square size d36 PMNT wafers was equally spaced circumferentially, when actuated simultaneously can nearly uniform axisymmetric torsional waves generate in pipes and non-symmetric wave modes can be suppressed greatly if the number of the d36 PMNT wafer is sufficiently large. This paper first presents the working mechanism of the linear d36 PMNT array from finite element analysis (FEA) by examining the constructive and destructive displacement wavefield phenomena in metallic pipes. Furthermore, since the amplitude of the received fundamental torsional wave signal strongly depends on frequency, a series of experiments are conducted to determine the frequency tuning curve for the torsional wave mode. All results indicate the linear d36 PMNT array has potential for efficiently generating uniform torsional wavefield of the fundamental torsional wave mode, which is more effective in monitoring structural health in metallic pipes.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2015-11-10", "authors": ["WensongZhou", "Fuh-GwoYuan", "TongluShi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2015.10.021"}

Over the years, these instruments have been refined to minimize damage to the surrounding soft tissues and to maximize precision.\nThis article will present the evolution of the authors' current operative technique based on 185 clinical cases performed over an 19-month period using piezoelectric instrumentation (PEI).\nA two-part study of cadaver dissections and clinical cases was performed using PEI. Evolution of the authors' clinical technique and the operative sequence were recorded.\nThirty cadaver dissections and 185 clinical cases were performed using PEI, including 82 primary and 103 secondary cases. An extended subperiosteal dissection was developed to visualize all aspects of the open rhinoplasty including the osteotomies. Ultrasonic rhinosculpture (URS) was utilized in 95 patients to shape the bony vault without osteotomies. To date, 11 revisions (6%) have been performed. There were no cases of bone asymmetry, irregularity, or excessive narrowing requiring a revision.\nBased on the authors' experience, adoption of PEI is justified and offers more precise analysis and surgical execution with superior results in altering the osseocartilaginous vault. With extensive exposure, surgeons can make an accurate diagnosis of bony deformity and safely contour the bones to achieve narrowing and symmetry of the bony dorsum. Stable osteotomies can be performed under direct vision with precise mobilization and control. As a result of PEI, the upper third of the rhinoplasty operation is no longer shrouded in mystery.

Essentially, we demonstrate printing of a wide range of formulations for patient-ready, orodispersible drug dosage forms, without the risk of drug degradation by ink heating and of substrate damages (by contact printing). In addition, our printing process has been optimized to ensure that the drug doses can be loaded onto the orally dissolvable films without introducing defects, such as holes or tears, while retaining a smooth surface texture that promotes patient adherence and allows for uniform post-coatings.

It consists of an array of 9 \u00d712 piezoelectric elements mounted on the ASIC via an integration scheme that involves direct electrical connections between a bond-pad array on the ASIC and the transducer elements. The ASIC addresses the critical challenge of reducing cable count, and includes front-end amplifiers with adjustable gains and micro-beamformer circuits that locally process and combine echo signals received by the elements of each 3 \u00d73 subarray. Thus, an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of receive channels is achieved. Dedicated circuit techniques are employed to meet the strict space and power constraints of TEE probes. The ASIC has been fabricated in a standard 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process and consumes only 0.44 mW/channel. The prototype has been acoustically characterized in a water tank. The ASIC allows the array to be presteered across \u00b137\u00b0 while achieving an overall dynamic range of 77 dB.

{"title": "PVDF Multielement Lamb Wave Sensor for Structural Health Monitoring.", "abstract": "The characteristics of Lamb waves, which are multimodal and dispersive, provide both challenges and opportunities for structural health monitoring (SHM). Methods for nondestructive testing with Lamb waves are well established. For example, mode content can be determined by moving a sensor to different positions and then transforming the spatial-temporal data into the wavenumber-frequency domain. This mode content information is very useful because at every frequency each mode has a unique wavestructure, which is largely responsible for its sensitivity to material damage. Furthermore, mode conversion occurs when the waves interact with damage, making mode content an excellent damage detection feature. However, in SHM, the transducers are typically at fixed locations and are immovable. Here, an affixed polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) multielement sensor is shown to provide these same capabilities. The PVDF sensor is bonded directly to the waveguide surface, conforms to curved surfaces, has low mass, low profile, low cost, and minimal influence on passing Lamb waves. While the mode receivability is dictated by the sensor being located on the surface of the waveguide, both symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be detected and group velocities measured.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-11-06", "authors": ["BaiyangRen", "Cliff JLissenden"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2496423"}

While current in-vivo imaging techniques can provide a snapshot of the extent of bone growth, it is unable to provide a history of the healing process, which is important if any corrective surgery is required. Monitoring the time evolution of in-vivo mechanical loads using existing technology is a challenge due to the need for continuous power while maintaining patient mobility and comfort.\nThis paper investigates the feasibility of self-powered monitoring of the bone-healing process using our previously reported piezo-floating-gate (PFG) sensors. The sensors are directly integrated with a fixation device and operate by harvesting energy from microscale strain variations in the fixation structure.\nWe show that the sensors can record and store the statistics of the strain evolution during the healing process for offline retrieval and analysis. Additionally, we present measurement results using a biomechanical phantom comprising of a femur fracture fixation plate; bone healing is emulated by inserting different materials, with gradually increasing elastic moduli, inside a fracture gap.\nThe PFG sensor can effectively sense, compute, and record continuously evolving statistics of mechanical loading over a typical healing period of a bone, and the statistics could be used to differentiate between different bone-healing conditions.\nThe proposed sensor presents a reliable objective technique to assess bone-healing progress and help decide on the removal time of the fixation device.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2015-11-06", "authors": ["WassimBorchani", "KenjiAono", "NizarLajnef", "ShantanuChakrabartty"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2015.2496237"}

The native linear aromatic FF, FFF and aliphatic LL peptide nanoensembles of various shapes (nanotubes and nanospheres) have asymmetric elementary structure and demonstrate nonlinear optical and piezoelectric effects. At elevated temperature, 140-180 \u00b0C, these native supramolecular structures (except for native Cyc-FF nanofibers) undergo an irreversible thermally induced transformation via reassembling into a completely new thermodynamically stable phase having nanowire morphology similar to those of amyloid fibrils.

The reference center frequency and reference echo magnitude were selected as the center frequency and echo magnitude, measured by pulse-echo testing, of the ultrasonic transducer without IMN. Initial component values and topology of IMN were determined using the Smith chart, and pulse-echo testing was analyzed to verify the performance of the ultrasonic transducers with and without IMN. After several iterations between changing component values and topology of IMN, and pulse-echo measurement of the ultrasonic transducer with IMN, optimized component values and topology of IMN were chosen when the measured center frequency from pulse-echo testing was comparable to the target frequency, and the measured echo magnitude was at least 30% larger than the reference echo magnitude. Performance of an ultrasonic transducer with and without IMN was tested by observing a tangible dent on the surface of a plastic petridish and single cell response after an acoustic pulse was applied on a target cell.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2015-10-08", "authors": ["Min GonKim", "SangpilYoon", "Hyung HamKim", "K KirkShung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2015.09.016"}

Serrated inserts with similar geometry were coupled with each device (ST94 insert/test A and P0700 insert/test B). Osteotomies 10\u00a0mm long and 3\u00a0mm deep were performed in bone blocks resembling type II (dense) and type IV (soft) bone densities with and without irrigation. Thermal changes and time variations were recorded. The effects of bone density, irrigation, and device on temperature changes and time necessary to accomplish the osteotomies were analyzed.\nThermal analysis showed significant higher temperatures during piezosurgery osteotomies in hard bone without irrigation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The type of piezosurgical device did not influence thermal variations (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Time analysis showed that the mean time values necessary to perform osteotomies were shorter in soft bone than in dense bone (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nWithin the limitations of this in\u00a0vitro study, it may be concluded that the temperature increases more in piezosurgery osteotomies in dense bone without irrigation; the time to perform the osteotomy with piezosurgery is shorter in soft bone compared to hard bone; and the piezosurgical device have a minimal influence in the temperature and time variations when a similar tip design is used during piezosurgery osteotomies.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2015-10-07", "authors": ["R ADelgado-Ruiz", "DSacks", "APalermo", "J LCalvo-Guirado", "CPerez-Albacete", "G ERomanos"], "doi": "10.1111/clr.12709"}

Quantitative assessments of microscopic stress fields both ahead and behind the tip of Vickers indentation cracks propagated under increasing indentation loads were systematically made using a Raman microprobe with spatial resolution on the order of a single micrometer. Concurrently, crack opening displacement (COD) profiles were monitored on the same microcracks screened by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman eye clearly visualized different mechanisms operative in toughening Si3N4 and ZTA bioceramics (i.e., crack-face bridging and ZrO2 polymorphic transformation, respectively) as compared to the brittle behavior of monolithic Al2O3. Moreover, emphasis was placed on assessing not only the effectiveness but also the durability of such toughening effects when the biomaterials were aged in a hydrothermal environment. A significant degree of embrittlement at the biomaterial surface was recorded in the transformation-toughened ZTA, with the surface toughness reduced by exposure to the hydrothermal environment. Conversely, the Si3N4 biomaterial experienced a surface toughness value independent of hydrothermal attack. Crack-face bridging thus appears to be a durable surface toughening mechanism for biomaterials in joint arthroplasty.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-10-07", "authors": ["Bryan JMcEntire", "YutoEnomoto", "WenliangZhu", "MarcoBoffelli", "EliaMarin", "GiuseppePezzotti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.08.044"}

As expected for lattice ions displaced in an electric field, the proportionality constant is positive for all piezoelectric materials. The exceptions are poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers with trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)), which exhibit a negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient. Reported explanations exclusively consider contraction with applied electric field of either the crystalline or the amorphous part of these semi-crystalline polymers. To distinguish between these conflicting interpretations, we have performed in situ dynamic X-ray diffraction measurements on P(VDF-TrFE) capacitors. We find that the piezoelectric effect is dominated by the change in lattice constant but, surprisingly, it cannot be accounted for by the polarization-biased electrostrictive contribution of the crystalline part alone. Our quantitative analysis shows that an additional contribution is operative, which we argue is due to an electromechanical coupling between the intermixed crystalline lamellae and amorphous regions.

Rows of CF2 atomic groups, at 0.25 nm intervals, which marked the paths of segments of the PVDF molecules, were seen. The fact that an electron microscope image of a segment of a PVDF molecule depended upon the particular azimuthal direction, along which the segment was viewed, enabled observation of twist around the molecular axis.

Therefore, it has been gradually studied for damage evaluation in recent years. But for on-line impact monitoring in practical application, the main problem is how to realize the spatial-wavenumber filtering of impact signal when the wavenumber of high spatial resolution cannot be measured or the accurate wavenumber curve cannot be modeled. In this paper, a new model-independent spatial-wavenumber filter based impact imaging method is proposed. In this method, a 2D cross-shaped array constructed by two linear piezoelectric (PZT) sensor arrays is used to acquire impact signal on-line. The continuous complex Shannon wavelet transform is adopted to extract the frequency narrowband signals from the frequency wideband impact response signals of the PZT sensors. A model-independent spatial-wavenumber filter is designed based on the spatial-wavenumber filtering technique. Based on the designed filter, a wavenumber searching and best match mechanism is proposed to implement the spatial-wavenumber filtering of the frequency narrowband signals without modeling, which can be used to obtain a wavenumber-time image of the impact relative to a linear PZT sensor array. By using the two wavenumber-time images of the 2D cross-shaped array, the impact direction can be estimated without blind angle. The impact distance relative to the 2D cross-shaped array can be calculated by using the difference of time-of-flight between the frequency narrowband signals of two different central frequencies and the corresponding group velocities.

A gas combustion gun was constructed with a steel tube as the main component. Gas/air mixtures of acetylene, hydrogen, and ethylene were used as propellants for discharging a 46-mm caliber test projectile. Gas pressure in the combustion chamber was captured with a piezoelectric pressure sensor. Projectile velocity was measured with a ballistic speed measurement system. The maximum gas pressure, the maximum rate of pressure rise, the time parameters of the pressure curve, and the velocity and path of the projectile through the barrel as a function of time were determined according to the pressure-time curve. The maximum gas pressure was measured to be between 1.4 bar (ethylene) and 4.5 bar (acetylene). The highest maximum rate of pressure rise was determined for hydrogen at (dp/dt)max = 607 bar/s. The muzzle energy was calculated to be between 67 J (ethylene) and 204 J (acetylene). To conclude, this work provides basic information on the internal ballistics of homemade gas combustion guns.

However, this method has several shortcomings, such as long preparation time (30\u00a0min), complexity in operation, and contamination of red blood cells (RBCs). In this paper, a new PRP preparation approach was proposed and tested. Ultrasound waves (4.5\u00a0MHz) generated from piezoelectric ceramics can establish standing waves inside a syringe filled with the whole blood. Subsequently, RBCs would accumulate at the locations of pressure nodes in response to acoustic radiation force, and the formed clusters would have a high speed of sedimentation. It is found that the PRP prepared by the proposed device can achieve higher platelet concentration and less RBCs contamination than a commercial centrifugal device, but similar growth factor (i.e., PDGF-\u03b2\u03b2).

Errors, mostly originating from the design and manufacturing process, need to be identified and reduced before the robot is deployed in clinical trials.\nThe manipulator has undergone several experiments to evaluate the repeatability and accuracy (about 1 mm in air (in x or y direction) at the needle's reference point) of needle placement, which is an essential concern in percutaneous prostate interventions.\nThe acquired results endorse the sustainability, precision and reliability of the manipulator.

{"title": "Pursuing frequency standards and control: the invention of quartz clock technologies.", "abstract": "The quartz clock, the first to replace the pendulum as the time standard and later a ubiquitous and highly influential technology, originated in research on means for determining frequency for the needs of telecommunication and the interests of its users. This article shows that a few groups in the US, Britain, Italy and the Netherlands developed technologies that enabled the construction of the new clock in 1927-28. To coordinate complex and large communication networks, the monopolistic American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and national laboratories needed to determine and maintain a common 'standard' frequency measurement unit. Exploiting novel piezoelectric quartz methods and valve electronics techniques, researchers in these organizations constructed a new crystal-based frequency standard. To ensure its accuracy they compared it to an accepted absolute standard - an astronomical clock, constructing thereby the first quartz clock. Other groups, however, had different, though connected, technological aims, which originated from the diverse interests of the industrial, governmental and academic institutes to which they belonged, and for which they needed to measure, control and manipulate with frequencies of electric oscillations. The present article suggests a comparative examination of the research and development paths of these groups on their incentives, the technological and scientific resources they utilized, and the kind of research carried out in the various institutional settings.", "journal": "Annals of science", "date": "2015-06-23", "authors": ["ShaulKatzir"], "doi": "10.1080/00033790.2015.1008044"}

Surface instrumentation was carried out with controlled pressure for 20 and 30\u00a0seconds at two power settings. For each time and power setting, instrumentation was repeated four times with one instrumentation per disc quadrant. Surface topography analysis was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).

Surface element composition and rinsing solutions were evaluated using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and trace elemental analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), respectively.\nSEM photomicrographs and CLSM 3D surface plot images of instrumented machined and moderately roughened surfaces demonstrated severe surface topographical alterations with metallic tips and mild to moderate changes for plastic tip instrumented sites. ICPMS analysis of the rinsing solutions identified titanium and other metal traces with the use of metallic tips, and mainly titanium and carbon when plastic tips were used. Surface EDS analysis showed elemental traces of the ultrasonic tips.\nUltrasonic instrumentation with metallic or plastic tips created surface topographical and compositional changes.

Implants were placed and left for non-submerged healing. Osteotomy time, insertion torque, pain perception, probing depth, and modified gingival and plaque indices were recorded. Peri-implant sulcular fluid (PISF) was collected from four sites of each implant at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. PISF samples were analyzed by ELISA for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B-ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin. CB loss was assessed on periapical radiographs at the 12th and on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) at the 24th weeks. The influence of time and osteotomy method on biochemical and radiological parameters of CB loss employed statistical method of Brunner-Langer.\nOsteotomy time for PS group was significantly longer than the drill group (P < 0.05). Pain perception that was lower in the PS than in the drill group depended on osteotomy method (P < 0.05). PS group had lower RANKL total amount than the drill group (P < 0.05). Mean CB loss on periapical radiographs at the 12th week for PS and drill groups were 0.11 and 0.18 mm, respectively (P > 0.05). At the 24th week, PS and drill groups showed 0.11 and 0.12 mm CB losses on CBCT, respectively (P > 0.05). However, CB loss values did not depend on osteotomy modality (P > 0.05).\nPS may modify and reduce bone-destructive inflammatory response during implant osseointegration.

{"title": "Compensating for Tissue Changes in an Ultrasonic Power Link for Implanted Medical Devices.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic power transfer using piezoelectric devices is a promising wireless power transfer technology for biomedical implants. However, for sub-dermal implants where the separation between the transmitter and receiver is on the order of several acoustic wavelengths, the ultrasonic power transfer efficiency (PTE) is highly sensitive to the distance between the transmitter and receiver. This sensitivity can cause large swings in efficiency and presents a serious limitation on battery life and overall performance. A practical ultrasonic transcutaneous energy transfer (UTET) system design must accommodate different implant depths and unpredictable acoustic changes caused by tissue growth, hydration, ambient temperature, and movement. This paper describes a method used to compensate for acoustic separation distance by varying the transmit (Tx) frequency in a UTET system. In a benchtop UTET system we experimentally show that without compensation, power transfer efficiency can range from 9% to 25% as a 5 mm porcine tissue sample is manipulated to simulate in situ implant conditions. Using an active frequency compensation method, we show that the power transfer efficiency can be kept uniformly high, ranging from 20% to 27%. The frequency compensation strategy we propose is low-power, non-invasive, and uses only transmit-side measurements, making it suitable for active implanted medical device applications.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2015-06-09", "authors": ["HugoVihvelin", "JeffLeadbetter", "ManoharBance", "Jeremy ABrown", "Robert B AAdamson"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2421823"}

In both routes an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was used to hydrothermally treating the powders. In the first approach, the solution concentrations were 3M, 1M, and 0.5M. The second route used solution concentrations of 10M and 12.5M. After the hydrothermal treatments, the powders were heat treated in order to synthesize NaNbO3 . The products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rietveld refinement. The phases were identified by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rietveld refinement. It was observed that the molar concentrations of the solutions had opposing effects for each route. An antiferroelectric phase was found in both routes. In the niobium metallic route, a ferroelectric phase was also synthesized.

However it is often inadequately monitored in hospitals. We test the hypothesis that RespiraSense, a piezoelectric-based novel respiratory rate (RR) monitor which measures the differential motion of the chest and abdomen during respiratory effort, is not inferior to commonly used methods of respiratory rate measurement. Respiratory rate was compared between the developed RespiraSense device and both electrocardiogram and direct observation by nursing staff. Data was collected from 48 patients admitted to the post-anaesthesia care unit in a tertiary level hospital. The primary outcome measure was difference in average RR calculated over a 15 min interval between (1) RespiraSense and ECG and (2) RespiraSense and nurses' evaluation. The secondary outcome measure was the correlation between the respiratory rates measured using these three methods. The 95 % confidence interval for the difference in average RR between RespiraSense and ECG was calculated to be [-3.9, 3.1]. The 95 % confidence interval for the difference in average RR between RespiraSense and nurses' evaluation was [-5.5, 4.3].

Conventional biological markers were measured. Correlations of PWV measured by the 3 methods were poor (r = 0.39, r = 0.39, and r = 0.31 for PWV-A vs. PWV-C, PWV-A vs. PWV-E, and PWV-C vs. PWV-E, respectively, all p < 0.05).

We characterized the effect as a function of actuator displacement and contrast agent concentration.\nThe resonant effect allowed us to generate block-design \"modulation response maps\" indicating the contrast agent's location, as well as positive contrast images with suppressed background signal. We found that the acoustically induced rotary saturation (AIRS) effect stayed approximately constant across acoustic frequency and behaved monotonically over actuator displacement and contrast agent concentration.\nAIRS is a promising method capable of using acoustic vibrations to modulate the contrast from iron oxide nanoparticles and thus perform selective detection of the contrast agents, potentially enabling more accurate visualization of contrast agents in clinical and research settings.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2014-12-30", "authors": ["BoZhu", "ThomasWitzel", "ShanJiang", "Susie YHuang", "Bruce RRosen", "Lawrence LWald"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.25522"}

Numerous anatomical and surgical advancements in sinus lift surgery are still inspiring clinicians.\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the recent trends in sinus lift surgery focusing on implant survival, bone grafting, anatomical and surgical considerations, and their clinical implications on the practice of implant dentistry in atrophic posterior maxilla.\nWe performed an extensive search in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Trip, Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. Articles were critically reviewed to determine the level of evidence as per the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.\nComprehensive assessment of sinus septa, sinus pathology, and bone quality and quantity using three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography radiographs is important before placing implants in posterior maxilla. With a residual bone height of less than 5\u2009mm, the survival rate of implant decreases substantially. Lateral window approach can increase the vertical bone height to greater than 9\u2009mm, while osteotome approach can increase this height from 3 to 9\u2009mm. The perforation of Schneiderian membrane doubles the risk for the incidence of sinusitis or infection. The use of piezoelectric surgery allows adequate sinus lift while protecting soft tissues and minimizing patient discomfort.\nAlthough both osteotome and lateral window procedures can help clinicians in overcoming the challenges of placing implants in atrophic posterior maxilla, pre-implant residual bone height is crucial in determining the survival of these implants.
