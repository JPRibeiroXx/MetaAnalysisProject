{"title": "The effect of camphor on the male mice reproductive system.", "abstract": "In Iranian traditional medicine there is a belief that camphor is a suppressor of sexual activity. Based on this idea and since there are few studies on this issue, we evaluated the effect of camphor on histopathological changes of reproductive system in young male mice of balb/c racial type.\nThirty-six premature male balb/c mice, were divided into 3 paired groups of experimental, control, and sham (n = 6). Experimental groups 1 and 2 received 30 mg/kg camphor dissolved in olive oil (orally) for 10 and 20 days, respectively. The control groups received the same volume of olive oil during the same periods of time, and no intervention was done in sham groups. All groups were kept in the same environmental condition. At the end of exposure time, each group was anesthetized and their testes were removed for obtaining serial sections, and histological staining.\nComparing to the control groups less vascularization in testis tissue of experimental groups was seen. Furthermore, using stereological methods demonstrated that internal diameters of seminiferous tubules in experimental groups were significantly smaller than those in control groups (P <0.005). Also, the number of released sexual cells was lower in experimental groups (P <0.005). No meaningful difference was seen between controls and sham groups.\nAdministration of camphor and its effects on male mice reproductive system may result in significant structural changes, including vascularization and proliferation of sexual cells. This can affect maturation of seminiferous tubules and subsequently, reproductive function of testes in mice.", "journal": "Urology journal", "date": "2007-10-05", "authors": ["M RNikravesh", "MJalali"], "doi": null}
{"title": "The development of early, biological concepts, techniques, and methods for joint reconstruction.", "abstract": "This article describes the development of techniques for the surgical mobilization of ankylosed joints, with particular emphasis on \"interposition material,\" i.e. a substitute for the destroyed articular cartilage, used to present limitations of movement. In the 19th and 20th century, various different organic and non-organic materials were used experimentally as interposition material. The most commonly used tissue was fascia, but this was not fully satisfactory due its very low mechanical endurance. Research was then undertaken on using skin, given its resistance to pressure, better vascularization, and higher level of metabolic activity. The article describes one of the pioneering experiments, based on the observation of the first author, that under certain circumstances connective tissue cells undergo metaplasia into cartilage cells. The method of applying skin tissue in the place of the destroyed joint surface was successfully used in the past at the Orthopedics Clinic of the Cracow Academy of Medicine, under the direction of Prof. Juliusz Zaremba and his team. The research described here, conducted simultaneously in many places around the world, formed the foundation for our still growing knowledge in the area of multipotential human cells.

An experimental study using calf femurs as models confirmed the author's hypothesis that the areas most susceptible to mechanical stress are found in the immature subchondrial layer of the head and neck of the femoral bone. Further investigation of the results suggested that disturbances in the activity of the two growth zones (the epiphyseal growth cartilage and the growth plate) of the proximal femur contribute significantly to the etiology of Perthes' disease. The temporary abnormalities detected radiologically in the healthy femoral heads in about 30% of patients with unilateral Perthes' disease but without clinical symptoms are probably caused by temporary disturbances in the blood supply to these growth layers. These changes are radiological risk factors potentially leading to Perthes' disease. The author concludes that impaired blood flow within the growth layers additionally weakens the immature bone tissue of the femoral head and neck, which may lead to mechanical damage of the bone tissue itself, as well as to the epiphyseal blood vessels entering bony epiphysis. Gradual mechanical destruction of blood vessels in the area of the immature bone tissue below the epiphyseal growth cartilage can eventually initiate the irreversible onset of Perthes' disease.", "journal": "Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja", "date": "2007-07-10", "authors": ["GrzegorzKandzierski"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Fibula free flap for mandible reconstruction.", "abstract": "Microvascular mandibular reconstruction should be considered the procedure of choice for bone replacement in radiated tissue beds, orocutaneous fistulae with segmental bone loss, osteoradionecrotic mandibles, and for immediate composite tissue reconstruction. The free vascularized fibula has significant potential for the reconstruction of the mandible. We evaluated our clinical experience in 21 cases of mandible reconstruction with fibular flaps.\nBetween 1997 and 2002, we performed 7 free osseous fibula flaps and 14 osteocutaneous fibula flaps for a total of 21 mandible reconstructions in 21 patients (8 females, 13 males; mean age 41 years; range 22-58 years). Indications for mandibular resection were squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth, tongue, oropharynx, and/or alveolar ridge in 13 cases, ameloblastoma of the mandible in 4 cases, leiomyosarcoma of the mandible in 2 cases, and chondrosarcoma of the mandible in one case. There was a traumatic loss in one case. Of 21 patients, 17 were reconstructed primarily, and 4 patients had secondary reconstruction.\nAll flaps, except one, survived and their viability was confirmed by scintigraphy when available. The skin defect in this patient was repaired by local lip flap which needed commissurotomy later, but the patient refused bone reconstruction. In two cases, because of long-lasting orocutaneous fistula and saliva drainage without flap loss, we used a pectoralis major pedicled flap as a secondary procedure. In three cases, donor side skin healing problems were managed well by secondary intention or split-thickness regrafting. Two patients had temporary foot drop which recovered in an average of three months. Simple problems with wound healing such as dehiscence and delayed healing developed in five patients, which usually required only local antiseptic treatment. After the operation, patients began oral feeding and walking with crutches in the third week, adjuvant radiotherapy began in the 6th week, and walking without crutches in the eighth week.\nFibular bone allows to plan osteotomies in relation to the orientation of the bone and its vascular pedicle.

{"title": "Evolution of an in vivo bioreactor.", "abstract": "The ideal bone graft substitute requires osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic components. This study introduces an \"in vivo bioreactor,\" a model in which pluripotent cells are recruited from circulating blood to a vascularized coralline scaffold supplemented with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). The bioreactor generates new, ectopic host bone with the capability of vascularized tissue transfer. More importantly, bone is reproducibly formed in a closed and malleable environment. In a rat model, the superficial inferior epigastric vessels were isolated, ligated, and then threaded through a prefabricated coral cylinder (hydroxyapatite, ProOsteon 500). Experimental groups were characterized by the following variables: (1) with/without incorporation of vascular pedicle; (2) with/without addition of BMP-2 (0.02 mg/cm3). Scaffolds were harvested 6 weeks after implantation, embedded and sectioned. Tissue samples were decalcified, fixed, and stained with H&E, trichrome green, and CD31/PECAM-1 (a marker of endothelial cells). Vascularized coral scaffolds supplemented with BMP-2 presumably recruited circulating mesenchymal stem cells to generate bone. Bone formation was quantified through histological analysis, and reported as a percentage, area bone/area cross section scaffold x 100. Mean bone formation was 11.30%+/-1.19. All scaffolds supplied by the vascular pedicle, regardless of BMP-2 supplementation, demonstrated neo-vascular ingrowth. Scaffolds lacking a pedicle showed no evidence of vascular ingrowth or bone formation. This paper introduces a model of a novel \"in vivo bioreactor\" that has future clinical and research applications. The tissue engineering applications of the \"bioreactor\" include treatment of skeletal defects (nonunion, tumor post-resection reconstruction).

Ready-to-function BM releases mature and precursor cells migrating to the recipient tissues immediately after transplantation. Donor BM-derived cells home to recipient BM cavities and lymphoid organs (LO) and to lesser extent to the non-lymphoid tissues. Interestingly, no acute and subacute graft-versus-host reaction develops. Cellular microchimerism is detected with the presence of donor cells in recipient tissues, at least as long as the transplanted limb is not rejected. Free donor DNA appears in high concentrations in recipient tissues at the time of rejection. The biological significance of the cellular and DNA microchimerism is not clear. Slight prolongation of limb and free-flap skin grafts survival time may be attributed to microchimerism. The beneficial and unwanted effects of transplanted BM tissue should be taken into consideration in the clinical limb transplantation programme.

Among children, 3 of 11 undergoing the procedure developed ankle instability, in distinction to adults, none of whom developed this complication (P < .041). This reflects a disruption of normal ankle function that develops in skeletally immature patients with a short residual fibula but not in patients with a longer residual fibula (P < .008). When the sum of patient age in years and residual fibula length in centimeters was less than 16, 3 of 6 patients developed deformity, in contrast to no deformity developing in the remaining 23 when the sum was >16 (P < .004).

{"title": "Combined angiogenic and osteogenic factor delivery enhances bone marrow stromal cell-driven bone regeneration.", "abstract": "Bone formation is a coordinated process involving various biological factors. We have developed a scaffold system capable of sustained and localized presentation of osteogenic (BMP-4) and angiogenic (VEGF) growth factors and human bone marrow stromal cells to promote bone formation at an ectopic site. Combined delivery of these factors significantly enhanced bone formation compared with other conditions.\nTissue regeneration entails complex interactions between multiple signals and materials platforms. Orchestrating the presentation of these signals may greatly enhance the regeneration of lost tissue mass. Bone formation, for example, is dependent on the signaling of BMPs, molecules initiating vascularization (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), and osteogenic precursor cells capable of responding to these cues and forming bone tissue. It was hypothesized that combined and concerted delivery of these factors from biodegradable scaffolds would lead to enhanced bone formation.\nPoly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffolds containing combinations of condensed plasmid DNA encoding for BMP-4, VEGF, and human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) were implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of SCID mice. Implants (n = 6) were retrieved at 3, 8, and 15 weeks after implantation. Bone and blood vessel formation was determined qualitatively and quantitatively by methods including histology, immmunostaining, and muCT.\nScaffolds delivering VEGF resulted in a prominent increase in blood vessel formation relative to the conditions without VEGF. BMP-4 expression in scaffolds encapsulating condensed DNA was also confirmed at the 15-week time-point, showing the characteristic of long-term delivery in this system. Combined delivery of all three types of factors resulted in a significant increase in the quantity of regenerated bone compared with any factor alone or any two factors combined, as measured with DXA, X-ray, and histomorphometric analysis. Furthermore, bone formed with all three factors had elastic moduli significantly higher than any other condition.\nConcerted delivery of BMP-4, VEGF, and hBMSCs promoted greater bone formation relative to any single factor or combination of two factors.

{"title": "Modification of collagen matrices for enhancing angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The vascularization of engineered tissues in many cases does not keep up with the ingrowth of cells. Nutrient and oxygen supply are not sufficient, which ultimately leads to the death of the invading cells. The enhancement of the angiogenic capabilities of engineered tissues therefore represents a major challenge in the field of tissue engineering. The immobilization of angiogenic growth factors may be useful for enhancing angiogenesis. The most potent angiogenic growth factor specific to endothelial cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), occurs in several splice variants. The variant with 165 amino acids both has a high angiogenic activity and a high affinity for heparin. We therefore incorporated heparin molecules into collagen matrices by covalently cross-linking them to amino functions on the collagen. Physical binding of VEGF to the heparin may then prevent a rapid clearance from the implant, while the release rate may become coupled to the degradation of the collagen matrix. The modified matrices were characterized by determination of the extent of the heparin immobilization, the in vitro degradation rate by collagenase. For testing the angiogenic properties, non-modified and heparinized collagen specimens were--either loaded with VEGF or non-loaded--subcutaneously implanted on the back of rats. Specimens were explanted after varying periods of implantation, the dry weights and the hemoglobin contents, as well as immunostained histological sections were evaluated: heparinized collagen matrices loaded with VEGF are vascularized to a substantially higher extent as compared to non-modified matrices.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2005-04-07", "authors": ["ChangYao", "PascalePr\u00e9vel", "SabineKoch", "PeterSchenck", "Ernst MagnusNoah", "NorbertPallua", "GuySteffens"], "doi": "10.1159/000083730"}
{"title": "Intraparenchymal renal artery aneurysms. Case report with review and update of the literature.", "abstract": "Increased interest in aneurysms involving the renal artery and its branches has occurred during the past 3 decades. The prevalence of renal artery aneurysms is approximately 0.01%-1% in the general population as well as 2.5% in hypertensive patients undergoing angiography. Intraparenchymal renal artery aneurysms (IPRAAs) are rare since being detected in less than 10% of patients with renal artery aneurysms. The Authors report an unusual case of multiple small intrarenal artery aneurysms associated with a large IPRAA located in the mid portion of the right kidney. Usually, IPRAAs are secondary to diseases or injuries of the kidney vascular network. They are classified as true, false, saccular, fusiform, dissecting, and microaneurysms. Potential complications of IPRAAs include peripheral dissection, thrombosis, hypertension, renal infarction and rupture. IRAAs may be detected incidentally as well as present with urologic symptoms and signs related to complications. Actually, IRAAs are investigated by non invasive modalities including duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, spiral three-dimensional computed tomography angiography, and three-dimensional reconstructed rotational digital substraction angiography of the segmental and distant branches of the renal artery. Angiography with intrarterial injection of contrast material is the gold standard in diagnosing IPRAAs. Treatment options for IPRAAs include observation, aneurysmectomy with surgical repair, endovascular procedures, nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy. Observation is indicated for asymptomatic intraparenchymal renal artery aneurysms measuring less than 2 cm in diameter. Surgical repair of IPRAAs includes aneurysmectomy and reconstruction of the renal artery by in vivo or ex vivo technique. The procedure is indicated for IPRAAs causing renovascular hypertension, dissection, urologic symptoms, embolization, local expansion and women of childbearing age with a potential for pregnancy. In recent years, transcatheter arterial embolization has emerged as a simple, useful and effective technique in managing IRAAs. The procedure is performed by transfemoral catheterization as well as by superselective catheterization and embolization of interlobar arteries with 3F microcatheters. Endovascular occlusion is obtained by using gelatin sponge, steel coils, detachable baloons, and conventional non-detachable microcoils delivered through a microcatheter. Nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy are reserved for conditions precluding renal revascularization which include overt RAA rupture, covert RAA rupture, artery-to-vein fistula, renal cell carcinoma, end stage nephropaty, renal infarction, severe ischemic renal atrophy or complex intrarenal aneurysms.

On review of the fine needle aspiration biopsy specimen, the population of cells with more uniform nuclei with focal follicle formation, which initially was interpreted as cells originating from normal thyroid tissue, was seen to actually represent the follicular carcinoma component. Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is an interesting phenomenon and there are only few cases of MM metastasis to other tumors.

Acute lymphadenitis shows intensive hilar flow with RI<0.60; abscess of l.n. is anechoic with through transmission. Tuberculous l.n. are inhomogenously hypoechoic and rounded, with deformed hilar vascularization on CD, occasionally with centripetal flow. They may mimick malignant l.n. on CD due to vessel dislocation by granulomatous masses. L.n. in stage of micrometastasis are of similar structure as reactive l.n., with preserved hilar vascularization; as the metastasis grows, focal cortical expansion and/or destruction of intranodal structure with dislocation and compression of blood vessels may occur; vascular resistance is consecutively increased; in advanced stage of metastatic growth l.n. becomes rounded, hilum is not visible, cortex is heterogenous, occasionally with hyperechoic keratin deposits, unsharp nodal margin is the sign of extranodal neoplastic spread; mainly peripheral vascularization, with fragmentation, deformation and dislocation of intranodal vessels are seen on CD, with increased RI>0.80; necrotic areas are anechoic and avascular on CD. Lymphomatous nodes have preserved internal structure, sharp margins, hypoechoic cortex, frequently with through transmission; large arborized hilum may be displaced; abundant hilar flow is seen on CD, with normal or slightly increased vascular resistance. Although the sensitivity of B-mode and Doppler features of l.n. is mostly limited (false negative rate is significant), high specificity of some of them establishes sonography as a valuable complementary method in differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy: the presence of hilar vascularization with RI<0.40 accurately indicates acute lymphadenitis, while predominantly peripheral flow pattern and RI>0.80 are typical of metastatic l.n. High enddiastolic velocities (EDV>9 cm/s) are only rarely seen in metastases, while very low EDV<1 cm/s indicates metastatic lymphadenopathy. As sonography is very suitable imaging method for puncture guidance, B-mode and CD analysis of l.n. need to be combined with aspiration cytology whenever possible, as it may considerably improve the accuracy of non-invasive patient diagnostic work-up.

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transfer enhances surgical revascularization of necrotic bone.", "abstract": "Avascular necrosis of bone is a relatively common clinical condition caused by inflammatory conditions, steroid or other drug use, and trauma that affect many different sites in man. Revascularization of the necrotic bone is slow to occur, often resulting in bone resorption and eventual collapse of the involved bone. Rapid revascularization and subsequent bone remodeling may lead to improved outcomes. Surgical revascularization with arterovenous bundles (AV bundles) or vascularized bone grafts results in neoangiogenesis and bone remodeling. Gene transfer of an angiogenic factor to the vessel wall may be an additional strategy to further accelerate this process. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transfer to augment surgical revascularization of necrotic bone. An adenoviral vector, either with the VEGF gene (VEGF-A) or identical virus without the cDNA VEGF insert (ADV-DeltaE1) was used to transduce endothelial cells in rabbit saphenous arteries. The artery was then placed with its venae comitantes as an AV bundle into necrotic iliac crest bone in vivo. Angiogenesis in the necrotic bone was quantified by bone blood flow measurement and assessment of vessel density following microangiography.

This increase and the recurrence rate of leiomyomas from 15 to 30% points to the effect of myomas on the infertility. Mechanisms by which myomas may cause infertility are abnormal uterine contractility, elongation of the uterine cavity, and distortion of uterine vascularization. Surgery may have beneficial or adverse effects without clear data on its effect on the assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. The present study was undertaken to establish the impact of surgical removal of myomas on fertility and infertility of patients undergoing ART procedures.

In vitro adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the human mda-7/IL-24 gene (Ad-mda-7) results in ubiquitous growth suppression of human cancer cells with minimal toxicity to normal cells. Intratumoral administration of Ad-mda-7 to lung tumor xenografts results in growth suppression via induction of apoptosis and antiangiogenic mechanisms. Although these results are encouraging, one limitation of this approach is that its locoregional clinical application-systemic delivery of adenoviruses for treatment of disseminated cancer is not feasible at the present time. An alternative approach that is suitable for systemic application is non-viral gene delivery. We recently demonstrated that DOTAP:cholesterol (DOTAP:Chol) nanoparticles effectively deliver tumor suppressor genes to primary and disseminated lung tumors. In the present study, therefore, we evaluated nanoparticle-mediated delivery of the human mda-7/IL-24 gene to primary and disseminated lung tumors in vivo. We demonstrate that DOTAP:Chol efficiently delivers the mda-7/IL-24 gene to human lung tumor xenografts, resulting in suppression of tumor growth. Growth-inhibitory effects were observed in both primary (P=0.001) and metastatic lung tumors (P=0.02). Furthermore, tumor vascularization was reduced in mda-7/IL-24-treated tumors. Finally, growth was also inhibited in murine syngenic tumors treated with DOTAP:Chol-mda-7 nanoparticles (P=0.01). This is the first report demonstrating (1) systemic therapeutic effects of mda-7/IL-24 in lung cancer, and (2) antitumor effects of human mda-7 in syngeneic cancer models. Our findings are important for the development of mda-7/IL-24 treatments for primary and disseminated cancers.", "journal": "DNA and cell biology", "date": "2005-02-03", "authors": ["RajagopalRamesh", "IsaoIto", "YujiSaito", "ZhengWu", "Abner MMhashikar", "Deborah RWilson", "Cynthia DBranch", "Jack ARoth", "SunilChada"], "doi": "10.1089/dna.2004.23.850"}
{"title": "Novel strategy for soft tissue augmentation based on transplantation of fragmented omentum and preadipocytes.", "abstract": "Current therapeutic procedures for soft tissue augmentation still lack the ability to induce rapidly formation of adipose tissue and its long-term stability, which is determined by rapid revascularization. The omentum is highly vascularized with microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) and is composed mainly of adipocytes that produce an enormously high level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The aim of this study was to determine the potential usefulness of fragmented omentum tissues, with or without cotransplantation with preadipocytes, in soft tissue augmentation. Fragmented omentum tissues (approximately 500 mg) with or without preadipocytes (approximately 2.3 x 10(6)) isolated from epididymal adipose tissues were transplanted under the dorsal skin of Wistar rats by percutaneous injection and the tissues were left under the skin for up to 12 weeks. Regardless of cotransplantation with preadipocytes, the general morphological features of the transplanted tissue were as follows. The transplanted tissues, the weight loss of which was limited to 30-40%, contained viable adipocytes and some pseudocysts surrounded by fibrotic septa with minor inflammatory cell infiltration. High levels of triacylglycerol content, capillary density, and VEGF production were observed in transplanted tissues 12 weeks postoperation. Cotransplantation with preadipocytes enhanced adipose tissue formation significantly. These observations strongly indicate that transplantation of fragmented omentum tissues or cotransplantation with preadipocytes may be a promising therapeutic procedure for soft tissue augmentation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2005-02-03", "authors": ["TeiichiMasuda", "MasutakaFurue", "TakehisaMatsuda"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2004.10.1672"}
{"title": "[Anaemia and radiation therapy].", "abstract": "Anaemia is frequent in cancer and may increase tumour hypoxia that stimulates angiogenesis. However, erythropoietin is a hypoxia-inducible stimulator of erythropoiesis which seems to improve quality of life in cancer patients. Two recent phase III randomized studies showed negative results using erythropoietin in head and neck cancer patients and in metastatic breast cancer patients with impaired specific survival. In vitro and in vivo experiments have provided erythropoietin-receptor expression in endothelial cancer cells including malignant tumours of the breast, prostate, cervix, lung, head and neck, ovary, melanoma, stomach, gut, kidney etc. Biologic effect of erythropoietin and its receptor linkage induces proliferation of human breast cancer and angiogenesis and may limit anti-tumour effect of cancer treatment, in part, by tumour vascularization improvement. In addition, the use of exogenous erythropoietin could be able to favour tumour progression by improving tumour oxygenation and nutriment supply. If erythropoietin receptor were functional in human cancer, the assessment of erythropoietin receptor expression on tumour cell may help to select patients benefiting from exogenous erythropoietin. However, the relationship between erythropoietin receptor expression, tumour growth and exogenous erythropoietin, requires more studies. The results of recent clinical trials suggest that using erythropoietin should be avoided in non-anemic patients and discussed in patients receiving curative therapy.", "journal": "Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique", "date": "2005-02-01", "authors": ["FDenis", "ELartigau"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Genetic and hypoxic regulation of angiogenesis in gliomas.", "abstract": "Infiltrative astrocytic neoplasms are by far the most common malignant brain tumors in adults. Clinically, they are highly problematic due to their widely invasive nature which makes a complete resection almost impossible. Biologic progression of these tumors is inevitable and adjuvant therapies are only moderately effective in prolonging survival. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade IV), the most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma, can evolve from a lower grade precursor tumor (secondary GBM) or can present as high grade lesion from the outset, so-called de novo GBM. Molecular genetic investigations suggest that GBMs are comprised of multiple molecular genetic subsets. Notwithstanding the diversity of genetic alterations leading to the GBM phenotype, the vascular changes that evolve in this disease, presumably favoring further growth, are remarkably similar. Underlying genetic alterations in GBM may tilt the balance in favor of an angiogenic phenotype by upregulation of pro-angiogenic factors and down-regulation of angiogenesis inhibitors. Increased vascularity and endothelial cell proliferation in GBMs are also driven by hypoxia-induced expression of pro-angiogenic cytokines, such vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Understanding the contribution of genetic alterations and hypoxia in angiogenic dysregulation in astrocytic neoplasms will lead to the development of better anti-angiogenic therapies for this disease. This review will summarize the properties of angiogenic dysregulation that lead to the highly vascularized nature of these tumors.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2005-01-28", "authors": ["BalveenKaur", "ChaletTan", "Daniel JBrat", "Dawn EPost", "Erwin GVan Meir"], "doi": "10.1007/s11060-004-2752-5"}

Despite aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the prognosis of metastatic disease remains poor. In a nude mouse model of Ewing tumor xenografts, we recently showed that human type I interferons (IFNs) inhibit the growth of established xenografts. Combined therapy with human IFNs and ifosfamide (IFO), an alkylating agent widely used in high-dose chemotherapy of Ewing tumors, results in a strong synergistic antitumor effect. We have investigated the effect of IFNs/IFO treatment on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), three key mediators of tumor growth and angiogenesis, in tumor xenografts generated either from a primary tumor (EW7) or from a metastatic tumor (COH). COH tumors expressed 5-fold higher levels of VEGF than EW7 tumors. IFNs/IFO treatment reduced by >70% the amount of VEGF in COH and EW7 tumors. We did not detect constitutive MMP-9 activity in EW7 tumors. In contrast, the metastasis-derived COH tumor expressed very high levels of active MMP-9. Although the total amount of MMP-9 remained unchanged, active MMP-9 was reduced by up to 75% in IFNs/IFO-treated COH tumors. IFNs/IFO treatment triggered in both COH and EW7 tumors the downregulation of uPAR expression, a molecule involved in vascularization and endothelial cell migration.

Reasonably, those vessels should be the ones of interest in histological evaluations. In a previous study, we examined the diffusion of glucose from the microcirculation into immunoisolation devices that had been implanted subcutaneously in rats for various times (i.e., 1, 2, and 4 weeks and 3 months). The glucose kinetic data were then correlated with the number of vascular profiles within 15 and 250 microm from the device. Significant correlations were found only at 250 microm. To examine the relation further between function and vascularization, we used the histological samples from the previous study and counted vascular profiles within various distances between 15 and 400 microm from the device. The number was then correlated with the already available glucose kinetic data. The highest correlations were found at 75 and 100 microm (p < 0.05). We therefore suggest that vascular profiles within 100 microm should be used when evaluating the vascularity of tissue surrounding an immunoisolation device. We also studied neovascularization asymmetries between the side of the membrane facing the skin and that facing the muscle. At 1 and 2 weeks about half of the devices were mainly vascularized on the side facing the skin, whereas the rest were equally vascularized on the two sides.

In the control Group D, only the left tibial fascicle was transected and repaired. Five months postoperatively, the outcome of regeneration was evaluated by histology, by retrograde tracing, and by assessment of the contraction force of the gastrocnemius and tibial anterior muscles. The tracing experiments showed that muscle reinnervation was less abnormal in Group C than in Groups A and B. However, muscle contraction force was not better in Group C than in Groups A and B. With respect to the peroneal nerve innervated muscle, the contraction force in Group C was significantly lower than in Group B. The histologic picture indicated that this inferior result in Group C was due to nerve compression caused by fibrotic scar tissue at the site of the fascia graft. Results of this study show that a non-vascularized autologous fascial graft used as a barrier between two sutured nerve fascicles in adjacency reduces criss-crossing of regenerating axons between the fascicles, but causes significant nerve compression.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2005-01-05", "authors": ["Barbara SLutz"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2004-861524"}

We prepared small organ fragments whose geometry allows preservation of the natural epithelial/mesenchymal interactions and ensures appropriate diffusion of nutrients and gases to all cells. Fragments derived from lung are shown to behave as fairly independent units, to undergo a marked upregulation of angiogenic factors and to continue to function for several weeks in vitro in serum-free media. When implanted into hosts, they transcribe a similar array of angiogenic factors that specifically induce the formation of a potent vascular network. The angiogenic induction capacity of these fragments was also tested in a mouse and rat model of limb ischemia. We report that such fragments, when implanted in the vicinity of the ischaemic area, induce an angiogenic response which can rescue the ischaemia-induced damage.

However, the mechanism by which CXCL12/CXCR4 functions in blood vessel formation remains elusive. Here, we have found a novel mode of organ vascularization and determined the roles of CXCL12 in these processes. In the developing small intestine, many short interconnecting vessels form between larger superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the neighboring primary capillary plexus surrounding the primitive gut, and they elongate and become the arteries supplying the small intestine. Mice lacking CXCL12 or CXCR4 lack the interconnecting vessels but have normal venous networks. The mutants lack filopodial extension and intussusception from endothelial cells of SMAs seen in wild-type embryos. CXCR4 is specifically expressed in arteries in the developing mesenteries and its expression is severely reduced in CXCL12-/- embryos. Mice in which CXCR4 is specifically deleted in the endothelium reveal vascular defects identical to those observed in the conventional CXCR4-/- embryos. Together, CXCL12 acts on arterial endothelial cells of SMA to up-regulate CXCR4 and mediate the connection between the larger artery and neighboring capillary plexus in an organ-specific manner.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2005-01-01", "authors": ["ToshiakiAra", "KojiTokoyoda", "RikaOkamoto", "Pandelakis AKoni", "TakashiNagasawa"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2004-07-2563"}

Microvessel density (MVD) measurement is widely used to quantify angiogenesis in tissue sections of tumors, including cutaneous malignancies. The increasing number of successful renal transplantations worldwide is producing a progressive increase in patients at risk for non-melanoma skin cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and Bowen's disease (BD), and at significantly increased risk for metastatic SCC. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was any difference in angiogenesis between these tumor types in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and immunocompetent individuals (ICIs) and whether angiogenesis in these tumors was related to COX-2 expression. The study measured angiogenesis and COX-2 expression in BD, SCC, BCC, and normal skin from both RTRs and ICIs. Vessel counts were performed, and COX-2 immunoexpression was assessed semiquantitatively. The MVD counts differed significantly between normal skin and all tumor types. Significant differences in MVD density were found between all SCCs and BCCs. BCCs from RTRs had significantly greater MVD at the invasive front of the tumor than BCCs from ICIs. Increased COX-2 expression correlated with increased MVD in all tumors examined. These findings indicate a difference in vascular profiles between RTRs and ICIs in BCCs and suggest a relationship between COX-2 and angiogenesis that may provide a possible treatment target for skin tumors in these 2 patient populations.", "journal": "Human pathology", "date": "2004-12-25", "authors": ["AnthonyO'Grady", "PatrickO'Kelly", "Gillian MMurphy", "MaryLeader", "ElaineKay"], "doi": "10.1016/j.humpath.2004.08.010"}

Hypoxia-related factors carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) were visualized by immunohistochemistry, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA by in situ hybridization. Expression patterns of VEGF and CA9 are similar with regard to distribution (perinecrotic) and extent. HIF-1alpha expression occurs in a significantly smaller fraction of cases and only in a few tumor cells without clear association with necrosis. Expression of VEGF and CA9, but not HIF-1alpha, is associated with a bizarre angiogenic subtype. Combined expression of two or three hypoxia markers (high hypoxia score) associates with presence of necrosis, high proliferation index, bizarre vascular pattern, and increased cellularity. Univariate analysis indicated that patients with high hypoxia score had significantly shorter survival. On multivariate analysis, only proliferation index and extent of resection remained independent predictive factors.

Multinucleated giant cells (MGC) have been described in several other breast lesions raising an interesting differential diagnosis, mainly with benign disorders. Due to its rarity few cases have been described cytologically. We retrospectively reviewed 13 fine needle aspiration samples from nine patients with this variant of carcinoma. Nine corresponded to breast tumours and four to axillary, liver, subcutaneous and mediastinal metastatic lesions. The expression of CD68 by giant cells was evaluated immunocytochemically in six cases. All patients had a complete pathological study of the breast neoplasm. Smears showed a double component of epithelial and giant cells. Epithelial clusters were predominantly of intermediate size with irregular contours. Most were cohesive but others showed cellular dissociation with scarce to moderate cellular pleomorphism. Giant cells had well defined, deeply stained cytoplasm and round to elongated morphology. Two metastatic cases were devoid of them. Haemosiderin-laden macrophages were common in smears from breast tumours. In the six cases tested CD68 was expressed in MGC. Cytological features of mammary carcinoma with OCGC correlate closely with the histological ones. Most cases are clearly recognizable as malignant but in others cytological atypia may be minimal, mimicking a benign lesion.

Velocities in arterioles and venules were assessed with a high-resolution laser Doppler imager (LDI).

After registering the detected vascular network with the LDI scan, volumetric flows were calculated along the centerlines of the vessels. In vivo data were obtained from the hamster cheek pouch in 6 studies. Flow continuity of the flow map was evaluated by comparing the main flow (Q) with the sum of branch flows (Qs), averaging over the respective vessel segments incident to each bifurcation. The method was reproducible across the 6 studies with the correlation coefficient (r) between Qs and Q ranging from 0.913 to 0.986. In all, over 20,000 flow estimates from 360 vessel segments (24-160 microm in diameter) at 166 bifurcations were analyzed. With flow normalized between 0 and 1, the linear regression yielded: Qs = 1.03 Q + 0.006; r = 0.952, n = 166, P < 0.0005.

In the present study, we have investigated the role of the heparin-binding sites in the in vivo mechanism of action of endostatin. The majority of the heparin binding is mediated by arginines 155/158/184/270 in endostatin, but there is also a minor site constituted by arginines 193/194. Using endostatin mutants lacking either of these two sites, we show that inhibition of fibroblast growth factor-2-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane requires both heparin-binding sites. In contrast, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-A-induced chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis by endostatin was only dependent on the minor heparin-binding site (R193/194). These arginines were also required for endostatin to inhibit fibroblast growth factor-2- and vascular endothelial growth factor-A-induced chemotaxis of primary endothelial cells. Moreover, we show that a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 180-199 of human endostatin (which covers the minor heparin-binding site) inhibits endothelial cell chemotaxis and reduces tumor vascularization in vivo. Substitution of arginine residues 193/194 for alanine attenuates the antiangiogenic effects of the peptide.

Elevated expression of RhoA and RhoC, as well as the Rho effector proteins ROCK I and ROCK II, are commonly observed in human cancers and are often associated with more invasive and metastatic phenotypes. To examine how ROCK contributes to the progression of solid tumors, we established a conditionally activated form of ROCK II by fusing the kinase domain to the estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain (ROCK:ER). ROCK:ER-expressing colon carcinoma cells grown as tumors in immunocompromised nude mice organized into discrete clusters surrounding blood vessels. However, ROCK:ER activation resulted in the aggressive dissemination of tumor cells into the surrounding stroma, indicating that increased ROCK signaling is sufficient to promote invasion from solid tumors. In addition, tumors in which ROCK:ER was activated were more highly vascularized, indicating that ROCK contributes to tumor angiogenesis. ROCK:ER activation resulted in changes to epithelial morphology and organization that facilitated motility in vitro, likely by inducing the redistribution of proteins such as ezrin, as well as adherens junction and extracellular matrix-binding proteins.

It has also been reported that TWEAK can stimulate blood vessel formation in the rat cornea angiogenesis assay, but it is presently unknown whether this cytokine could play a role in the pathological angiogenesis associated with human diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy. In the present study we investigated whether TWEAK was expressed in human tumors and whether it could promote tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. TWEAK mRNA expression was detected in many tumor types by cDNA array hybridization analysis, and TWEAK protein expression was confirmed in human colon cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry. As an initial approach to address whether TWEAK might act as a tumor angiogenesis factor, we established several human embryonic kidney cell lines that constitutively secrete a soluble TWEAK protein and examined their growth properties in vitro and in vivo. We found that although TWEAK-overexpressing cells do not have a growth advantage in vitro, they form larger and more highly vascularized tumors in athymic mice when compared with control, vector-transfected cells.

Concurrently, CEACAM1 is up-regulated in the endothelia of adjacent angiogenic blood vessels. Mimicking the CEACAM1 down-regulation in the urothelium, CEACAM1 was silenced in bladder cancer cell lines 486p and RT4 using the small interfering RNA technique. CEACAM1 down-regulation was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analyses. CEACAM1 silencing leads to a significant up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and VEGF-D in quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Correspondingly, supernatants from the CEACAM1-overexpressing bladder cancer cell lines reduce, but those from CEACAM1 silencing induce endothelial tube formation and potentiate the morphogenetic effects of VEGF. These data suggest that the epithelial down-regulation of CEACAM1 induces angiogenesis via increased expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Inversely, CEACAM1 is up-regulated in endothelial cells of angiogenic blood vessels.

{"title": "Endothelial progenitor cells: characterization, pathophysiology, and possible clinical relevance.", "abstract": "Bone marrow and peripheral blood of adults contain a special sub-type of progenitor cells which are able to differentiate into mature endothelial cells, thus contributing to re-endothelialization and neo-vascularization. These angiogenic cells have properties of embryonal angioblasts and were termed endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In general, three surface markers (CD133, CD34 and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2) characterize the early functional angioblast, located predominantly in the bone marrow. Later, when migrating to the systemic circulation EPCs gradually lose their progenitor properties and start to express endothelial marker like VE-cadherin, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and von Willebrand factor.

In the context of possible therapeutic application of EPCs recent clinical studies employing these cells for neo-vascularization of ischemic organs have just been published.

{"title": "[Non-union in os scaphoideum and its surgical treatment: overview of literature].", "abstract": "Authors present an overview of surgical methods used for the treatment of os scaphoideum with a focus on currently most frequent operations. In the period between January 1998 and March 2004, the authors performed 100 operations on the scaphoid bone, of this 54times primary fixation and 46times surgery for non-union in 42 patients. The most frequent method was resection of non-union, implantation of tri-cortical bone graft and internal fixation (17times). This method is considered by the authors optimal in non-unions in the middle third of the bone without signs of avascular necrosis of the roximal pole. In 8 patients with signs of avascular necrosis of the proximal pole and in non-unions in the proximal third, reconstruction was done by vascularized bone graft after Zaidemberg. In case of the finding of a minimal sclerotic line without deformation or shortening of the bone the method of choice was compression of the non-union by a screw (Herbert screw, HBS, Synthes screw) in 8 patients. Intramedullary cancellous bone graft and internal fixation was used in 8 patients. However, the authors do not consider it as an optimal treatment as it does not guarantee preservation of the length of the bone until the healing of the non-union. This surgery was used by the authors only as an alternative when it was not possible to choose another method. Extirpation of the distal scaphoid bone (twice) and proximal carpectomy (twice, of this once together with the dennervation after Wilhelm) were performed in non-unions with marked osteoarthritic changes of the radiocarpal joint. In one patient the proximal pole was excised and replaced by tendon graft. The authors do not have experience in limited intercarpal arthrodesis, but most other authors currently prefer proximal carpectomy to this technically demanding operation.", "journal": "Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca", "date": "2004-12-17", "authors": ["PMan\u00e1k", "PDr\u00e1c"], "doi": null}

Cerebral hypoxia and/or ischaemia also produce hyperexpression of specific genes (c-fos, c-jun) which may be involved, in vulnerable districts, in the mechanisms of excitotoxic neuronal death. In the present study, we examined NTS in 23 adults, who died shortly after an ischaemic and/or hypoxic event, on transverse serial sections of the medulla, stained with haematoxylineosin, Nissl, Kl\u00fcver-Barrera and Luxol fast blue, and immunohistochemical staining by anti-tyrosine hydroxylase and anti-Fos. In 10 cases, at the level of the dorsal portion of the NTS, corresponding to the subnucleus gelatinosus, bilateral symmetrical hypereosinophilic areas and strong Fos-like immunoreactivity were detected. The hypoxic-ischaemic origin of these findings was supported by the strong hypereosinophilic appearance and shrinking of neurons, and by selective Fos-like immunoreactivity, the expression of Fos being mainly associated with cellular damage and subsequent death following hypoxic-ischaemic injury. In 7 other cases, Fos-like immunoreactivity was found at the level of the subnucleus gelatinosus, in the absence of hypereosinophilia or pyknosis in histological staining. The immediate-early gene expression induces to ascribe the absence of morphologically evident hypoxicischaemic lesions to the rapidity of death. The selective vulnerability of the subnucleus gelatinosus to hypoxic-ischaemic injury may not only be explained with reference to vascularization of the medullary tegmentum, but also to the structural and functional characteristics of the subnucleus itself.", "journal": "Italian journal of anatomy and embryology = Archivio italiano di anatomia ed embriologia", "date": "2004-12-16", "authors": ["AndreaPorzionato", "VeronicaMacchi", "Santo DFerrara", "AnnaParenti", "RaffaeleDe Caro"], "doi": null}

After 18 days of incubation, the generation of endothelial cells was assessed by flow cytometry. The generation of endothelial cells was compared with the degree of vascularization in the synovial tissues and with the microvessel densities in the synovium, as determined by microscopy. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) messenger RNA (mRNA) in CD34+ cells was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nThe generation of CD14+ cells from bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells from RA patients was comparable to that from control subjects. However, the generation of von Willebrand factor (vWF)-positive cells and CD31+/vWF+ cells from RA bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells was significantly higher than that from control subjects (P = 0.004 and P = 0.030, respectively). The generation of vWF+ cells from bone marrow CD34+ cells correlated significantly with the microvessel densities in the synovial tissues (r = 0.569, P = 0.021). Finally, RA bone marrow CD34+ cells expressed KDR mRNA at higher levels than OA bone marrow CD34+ cells.\nThese results indicate that RA bone marrow CD34+ cells have enhanced capacities to differentiate into endothelial cells in relation to synovial vascularization. The data therefore suggest that bone marrow CD34+ cells might contribute to synovial neovascularization by supplying endothelial precursor cells and, thus, play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA.", "journal": "Arthritis and rheumatism", "date": "2004-12-14", "authors": ["ShunseiHirohata", "TamikoYanagida", "AkihideNampei", "YasuoKunugiza", "HideoHashimoto", "TetsuyaTomita", "HidekiYoshikawa", "TakahiroOchi"], "doi": "10.1002/art.20729"}

This pathway is active during the formation of a corpus luteum, a highly vascularized, endocrine organ with a short life span during the nonpregnant state. In the pregnant state, the life span of corpora lutea is much longer because they play a critical role in supporting pregnancy development. We hypothesized that the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway plays a critical role in regulating angiogenic events in the corpora lutea of pregnancy. Injection of the neutralizing anti-VEGFR-2 antibody DC101 (ImClone Systems, Inc., New York, NY) on embryonic d 3.5 (preimplantation) or 6.5 (postimplantation) disrupts function of the corpora lutea of pregnancy in CD1 mice, as evidenced by a decrease in organ size, regression of luteal vessels, and a fall in progesterone secretion within 24 h postinjection. Inhibition of the VEGFR-2 caused removal of endothelial cells, mostly through endothelial cell detachment from the vascular basement membrane. Luteal steroid-producing epithelial cells were eliminated through apoptosis secondary to vasculature becoming dysfunctional. Disruption of luteal function caused arrest of embryonic development. The effect of antibody is specific to the ovary, because pregnancy progresses normally in ovariectomized, progesterone-replaced animals treated with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. Embryonic blood vessels were not affected directly by the antibody, because it did not reach the embryo. Administration of an antibody against VE-cadherin (E4G10), which specifically blocks endothelial proliferation, did not disrupt luteal function and pregnancy development. Thus, VEGFR-2-mediated endothelial cell signals are critical to maintain functionality of luteal blood vessels during pregnancy. Potential clinical applications of inhibitors of the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway include emergency contraception and medical treatment of ectopic and abnormal intrauterine pregnancies.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2004-12-14", "authors": ["Samuel APauli", "HongyanTang", "JeffWang", "PeterBohlen", "RobertPosser", "TiptonHartman", "Mark VSauer", "JanKitajewski", "Ralf CZimmermann"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2004-0765"}

Our recent data suggested that cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II) may play a role in the formation of vascular plexuses in developing corpora lutea of the rat. Here we examined the relationship between VEGF and the expression of prostaglandin (PG)- metabolizing enzymes in rat ovarian luteal cells. VEGF treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in the expression of COX-II and membrane-associated PGE synthase (mPGES) mRNA in cultured rat luteal cells. However, pretreatment of the luteal cells with a selective COX-II inhibitor, NS-398, abolished the VEGF-enhanced mPGES mRNA expression. VEGF also increased PGE2 secretion. Conversely, PGE2 dose-dependently stimulated VEGF mRNA expression. Furthermore, VEGF induced VEGF mRNA expression, but this effect was abolished by NS-398 pretreatment. These findings suggest that VEGF enhances PGE2 production by stimulating COX-II and mPGES expression in rat corpus luteum and that the effect of VEGF on luteal cells may be partially mediated by this stimulation of PGE2 production.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2004-12-14", "authors": ["TSakurai", "KTamura", "HKogo"], "doi": "10.1677/joe.1.05629"}

However, fibroblasts in the corneal stroma and the sclera did not express detectable levels of nectin-1. Ocular tissues from mice euthanized 7 days after corneal inoculation of HSV-1 frequently demonstrated corneal ulceration and inflammation and HSV-1 protein expression in the corneal epithelium, stroma, endothelium, conjunctiva, iris, and ciliary body but rarely in the retina. Ocular tissues from mice euthanized 7 months after HSV-1 inoculation demonstrated corneal epithelial and stromal inflammation, but HSV-1 protein expression was not detected. HSV-1 infection did not lead to a loss of nectin-1 expression in any of the tissues examined. In contrast to uninfected corneas, the inflamed and vascularized stroma of infected corneas contained mononuclear inflammatory cells, vascular cells, and fibroblasts that stained positive for nectin-1.\nFindings report that nectin-1 is widely expressed in murine ocular tissues. Only fibroblasts in the corneal stroma and sclera of uninfected tissues were devoid of nectin-1 expression. HSV-1-infected inflamed corneas contained some stromal fibroblasts with detectable nectin-1 expression, which potentially could be targeted by the virus.

We have developed a three-dimensional collagen-based coculture system to assess interactions between human endothelial cells (hECs) and human osteoblasts (hOBs) in vitro. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown as three-dimensional multicellular spheroids and seeded in a collagen matrix to assess sprouting of the spheroids, that is, formation of tubelike structures resembling early capillaries. Direct cell contact between hOBs and HUVECs was established by incorporating hOBs into the EC spheroids, thus forming heterogeneous cospheroids. Spatial organization of cospheroids and sprout configuration were assessed by immunohistochemical wholemount staining techniques and confocal laser microscopy. Cumulative sprout length of spheroids was quantitatively analyzed by digital imaging planimetry. In this model HUVECs and hOBs formed heterogeneous cospheroids with distinct spatial organization. The ability of HUVEC spheroids to form tubelike structures on angiogenic stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor was suppressed in heterogeneous HUVEC/hOB cospheroids.

Angiotensin II has pro-angiogenic effects via its AT1 subtype receptor whereas the AT2 angiotensin II receptor has pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties. Besides its effect on angiotensin II formation, some angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have pro-angiogenic effect by increasing the local concentration of bradykinin in ischemic tissues and, thus, by activation of its B2 receptor and then NO release.

In conclusion, fasciocutaneous rotational flaps provided tension-free, durable, innervated and well-vascularized skin coverage over the dural repair in all three referred patients, without using skin graft.

We also found evidence of massive infiltration and proliferation of activated antitumor pmel-1 cells in a variety of peripheral tissues, including lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and lungs, but not peripheral blood. Most importantly, evidence for T cell function, as measured by production of IFN-gamma, release of perforin, and activation of caspase-3 in target cells, was confined to Ag-expressing tumor.

Here, we characterize a putative UDP-glucose:thiohydroximate S-glucosyltransferase, UGT74B1, to determine its role in the Arabidopsis glucosinolate pathway. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that recombinant UGT74B1 specifically glucosylates the thiohydroximate functional group. Low Km values for phenylacetothiohydroximic acid (approximately 6 microm) and UDP-glucose (approximately 50 microm) strongly suggest that thiohydroximates are in vivo substrates of UGT74B1. Insertional loss-of-function ugt74b1 mutants exhibit significantly decreased, but not abolished, glucosinolate accumulation. In addition, ugt74b1 mutants display phenotypes reminiscent of auxin overproduction, such as epinastic cotyledons, elongated hypocotyls in light-grown plants, excess adventitious rooting and incomplete leaf vascularization. Indeed, during early plant development, mutant ugt74b1 seedlings accumulate nearly threefold more indole-3-acetic acid than the wild type. Other phenotypes, however, such as chlorosis along the leaf veins, are likely caused by thiohydroximate toxicity. Analysis of UGT74B1 promoter activity during plant development reveals expression patterns consistent with glucosinolate metabolism and induction by auxin treatment.

Synovial tissues with diffuse inflammatory infiltrates had high levels of TSP2, whereas synovial tissues with ectopic germinal center reactions and T cell-B cell aggregates produced low levels. Cell-based gene therapy with TSP2 was used to examine the in vivo effects of the matrix protein on neoangiogenesis and lymphoid organization. Human synovium-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse chimeras were treated with TSP2-transfected fibroblasts deposited into the peritoneum. Overexpression of TSP2 led to the accumulation of TSP2 protein in the inflamed synovium and resulted in a prompt inhibition of lesional vascularization. Beside its anti-angiogenic activity, TSP2 also suppressed the production of the proinflammatory mediators, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and induced the depletion of tissue-residing T cells. We propose that TSP2 is an endogenous regulator of angiogenesis and autoimmune inflammation in the synovium and represents a protective mechanism preventing ectopic lympho-organogenesis and persistent inflammation in this tissue site.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2004-12-08", "authors": ["Yong WookPark", "Young MoKang", "JoeButterfield", "MichaelDetmar", "J\u00f6rg JGoronzy", "Cornelia MWeyand"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63259-2"}

It has been previously reported that brassinosteroid analogues exert an antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and arenaviruses. In the present study, we report the chemical synthesis of compounds (22S,23S)-3beta-bromo-5alpha,22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one (2), (22S,23S)-5alpha-fluoro-3beta-22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one (3), (22S,23S)-3beta,5alpha,22,23-tetrahydroxy-stigmastan-6-one (4) as well as their antiherpetic activity both in a human conjunctive cell line (IOBA-NHC) and in the murine herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) experimental model. All compounds prevented HSV-1 multiplication in NHC cells in a dose dependent manner when added after infection with no cytotoxicity. Administration of compounds 2, 3, and 4 to the eyes of mice at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infection delayed and reduced the incidence of HSK, consisting mainly of inflammation, vascularization, and necrosis, compared to untreated, infected mice. However, viral titers of eye washes showed no differences among samples from treated and untreated mice. Since the decrease in the percentage of mice with ocular lesions occurred 5 days after treatment had ended, we suggest that brassinosteroids 2, 3, and 4 did not exert a direct antiviral effect in vivo, but rather may play a role in immune-mediated stromal inflammation, which would explain the improvement of the clinical signs of HSK observed.", "journal": "Steroids", "date": "2004-12-08", "authors": ["Flavia MMichelini", "Javier ARam\u00edrez", "AlejandroBerra", "Lydia RGalagovsky", "Laura EAlch\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1016/j.steroids.2004.04.011"}
{"title": "Angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors as potential anti-angiogenic agents for cancer therapy.", "abstract": "Angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are commonly used as safe antihypertensive agents, and it has recently been suggested that they decrease the risk of cancer development. Recent studies have revealed that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the development of many types of tumor. Angiotensin-II (AT-II) has many biological effects, including neo-vascularization, which plays a pivotal role in tumor development. AT-II induces a potent angiogenic factor, namely the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Some studies have proven that several ACE-Is are potent inhibitors of experimental tumor development and angiogenesis at clinically comparable doses. VEGF expression in tumors is also significantly suppressed by ACE-Is. When used in combination with the conventional anti-cancer drugs, ACE-Is exert more potent anti-tumor activities as compared with either single agent, in addition to suppression of the intra-tumoral angiogenesis. Furthermore, ACE-Is reportedly not only suppress tumor growth but also attenuate the carcinogenesis process in which angiogenesis is involved. Since ACE-Is are already in widespread clinical case without any serious adverse effects, they may represent a potential new strategy for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.", "journal": "Current cancer drug targets", "date": "2004-12-08", "authors": ["HitoshiYoshiji", "ShigekiKuriyama", "RyuichiNoguchi", "HiroshiFukui"], "doi": "10.2174/1568009043332790"}

The quality of visualization of colorectal lesions and the accuracy of differentiation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions using the NBI system were evaluated in comparison with results from conventional colonoscopy and with chromoendoscopy.\nFor pit pattern delineation, NBI was superior to conventional endoscopy (P < 0.001), but inferior to chromoendoscopy (P < 0.05). NBI achieved better visualization of the mucosal vascular network and of the hue of lesions than conventional endoscopy (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference between NBI and chromoendoscopy in differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions (both techniques had a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity 75 %). This was better than the results of conventional colonoscopy (sensitivity 83 %, specificity 44 %; P < 0.05 for specificity).\nThese results suggest that in the examination of colonic lesions the NBI system provides imaging features additional to those of both conventional endoscopy and chromoendoscopy.

CD97alpha, the extracellular domain of CD97, contains 3 to 5 fibrillin class 1 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide, and a mucin stalk. We show here that CD97alpha promotes angiogenesis in vivo as demonstrated with purified protein in a directed in vivo angiogenesis assay (DIVAA) and by enhanced vascularization of developing tumors expressing CD97. These data suggest that CD97 can contribute to angiogenesis associated with inflammation and tumor progression. Strong integrin alpha5beta1 interactions with CD97 have been identified, but alpha v beta3 also contributes to cell attachment. Furthermore, soluble CD97 acts as a potent chemoattractant for migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and this function is integrin dependent. CD97 EGF-like repeat 4 is known to bind chondroitin sulfate. It was found that coengagement of alpha5beta1 and chondroitotin sulfate proteoglycan by CD97 synergistically initiates endothelial cell invasion.

His earlier interest in growth, driven as much by mathematics as biology, gave way to transplantation at the beginning of World War II, treatment of burns patients being the driver. He interpreted the results of grafting autologous and allogeneic human skin, observed clinically and microscopically, as immunological; he identified accelerated donor-specific reactions to subsequent grafts as 'second set', and described cell (lymphocyte) mediated infiltration of allo- but not auto-grafts following initial vascularization, both in the patient context and in experimental animals. He became intrigued by the consequences of hematopoietic chimerism, from which his landmark discoveries on the induction of transplantation tolerance derive.

Type 1 diabetes results from an autoimmune-mediated destruction of the insulin-secreting beta-cells in the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas, whereas Type 2 diabetes is a disease of the older population which is due to systemic insulin resistance and reduced insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells. Surgical resection of the pancreas may also cause insulin-dependent diabetes depending on the size of the remaining pancreas. The long-term complications of diabetes are a direct result of the constantly elevated levels of blood glucose in the absence of an effective insulin treatment. Recent prospective studies such as the diabetes control and complication trial (DCCT) [N. Engl. J. Med. 329 (1993) 977] and the UK prospective diabetes study [Lancet 352 (1998) 837] have convincingly demonstrated that improved blood glucose control in all type diabetes reduces the risk of the development of the secondary complications of diabetes. Despite intensive insulin therapy, most individuals with insulin deficient diabetes are unable to maintain a blood glucose level in the normal range at all times. Therefore, the only way to ensure the long-term health of patients with diabetes is find a way of maintaining constant normoglycemia. It seems logical that the replacement of the islet tissue itself, either by transplanting a vascularized pancreatic allograft or by transplanting purified pancreatic islet cells, offers a better approach than simply replacing insulin that has been lost.

Hirel [2003] Plant Physiol Biochem 41: 565-576), we studied the localization of GDH in untransformed tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants grown either on low nitrate or on ammonium and in ferredoxin-dependent Glu synthase antisense plants. Production of GDH and its activity were strongly induced when plants were grown on ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. The induction mainly occurred in highly vascularized organs such as stems and midribs and was likely to be due to accumulation of phloem-translocated ammonium in the sap. GDH induction occurred when ammonia was applied externally to untransformed control plants or resulted from photorespiratory activity in transgenic plants down-regulated for ferredoxin-dependent Glu synthase. GDH was increased in the mitochondria and appeared in the cytosol of companion cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the enzyme plays a dual role in companion cells, either in the mitochondria when mineral nitrogen availability is low or in the cytosol when ammonium concentration increases above a certain threshold.", "journal": "Plant physiology", "date": "2004-11-26", "authors": ["Th\u00e9r\u00e8seTerc\u00e9-Laforgue", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricDubois", "SylvieFerrario-M\u00e9ry", "Marie-Anne Poude Crecenzo", "RajbirSangwan", "BertrandHirel"], "doi": "10.1104/pp.104.047548"}

To determine the functional roles of Mmp13, we generated Mmp13-null mice that showed profound defects in growth plate cartilage with markedly increased hypertrophic domains as well as delay in endochondral ossification and formation and vascularization of primary ossification centers. Absence of Mmp13 resulted in significant interstitial collagen accumulation due, in part, to the lack of appropriate collagenase-mediated cleavage that normally occurs in growth plates and primary ossification centers.

{"title": "Tumour angiogenesis: vascular growth and survival.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis starts at the edge of a malignant epithelial tumour concurrently with tumour cell invasion and stromatogenesis, i.e. the formation of specific connective tissue stroma amenable to easy penetration by endothelial and tumour cells. However, as the tumour continues its growth, the edge becomes the inner tumour area, and a new invading tumour front is formed by the multiplying malignant cells which outflank the initial edge. This process, which repeats itself again and again, forms the \"relay race\" model of tumour vascular growth and regression. At the heart of the tumour unfavourable environmental conditions prevail -- hypoxia, acidity, lack of nutrients, failure of waste removal, and apoptosis rather than proliferation. Blood vessels and tumour cells are greatly decreased, but do not vanish, as tumour cells are shifting to anaerobic glycolysis, and blood vessels are turning into anti-apoptotic pathways -- vascular survival ability (VSA). Thus, assessing vascular density (VD) by simply counting \"hot spots\" at the edge of a tumour, where conditions are most favourable, is futile; it may reflect tumour angiogenic activity (TAA), but is not representative of genuine tumour vasculature. By combining vessel counts at the invading tumour front with those of the inner tumour areas a complete picture of tumour VD can be achieved. The thus formed four patterns of vascularization, designated as \"edvin\" (edge vsinner tumour area), are: edvin 1: low TAA/low VSA; edvin 4: high TAA/high VSA; edvin 2: low TAA/high VSA; and edvin 3: high TAA/low VSA.

{"title": "Stochastic modeling of the tumor volume assessment and growth patterns in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "The growth pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising from cirrhosis is variable and depends on the degree of differentiation and vascularization. Because growth is not constant in the natural history of HCC, prediction of subsequent growth rate based on tumor volume doubling time and correlation with histological and ultrasonographical characteristics at the moment of initial diagnosis are usually unreliable. The aim of our study was to assess the growth patterns of HCC with the aid of stochastic modeling. Thus, we included in our study 27 patients with histologically proven HCC, which had multiple (more than three)follow-up ultrasound studies in a six months interval. The patients did not receive any treatment during the observation period. HCC was visualized by computer aided ultrasound imaging, obtaining both the primary size quantification and the edge-detection enhancement. By a bi-cubic B-spline interpolation of points on the edges (3-D Bezier approximation) we approximated the surfaces shapes, and using the hit or miss Monte Carlo method we accurately estimate the tumor volume. Starting from the previous tumor volumes time series recorded during the first six months of evolution we applied both a linear, exponential and logarithmic smoothing to forecast the future size of the HCC tumor in the next six months. Our conclusion was that a dynamic forecasting model of HCC volumes could be very accurate for the assessment of tumor volume doubling time usually obtained by two discrete volume measurements of the tumor.", "journal": "Bulletin du cancer", "date": "2004-11-26", "authors": ["AdrianS\u00e3ftoiu", "TudorelCiurea", "FlorinGorunescu", "IonRogoveanu", "ClaudiaGeorgescu"], "doi": null}

These studies focused on tumors derived following the subcutaneous injection of MDA-MB-435/LCC6 cells transfected with human c-erbB2 (LCC6(HER-2)) into SCID-Rag2M mice. LCC6(HER-2) tumors were more viable (H&E-stained tumor sections) than isogenic vector control tumors (LCC6(Vector)). Correspondingly, a 2.7-fold increase in trypan blue-excluding cells (P = 0.00056) and a 4.8-fold increase in clonogenic cells (P = 0.00146) were noted in cell suspensions derived from disaggregated LCC6(HER-2) versus LCC6(Vector) tumors. Tumor sections stained with the antibody detecting 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)-acetamide (EF5), a marker of hypoxia, showed a greater fraction of hypoxic tissue in LCC6(HER-2) tumors compared with control tumors. Flow cytometric analyses based on viable tumor cells (DNA content >/= 2N) in cell suspensions from disaggregated tumors confirmed that there were significantly more EF5-positive cells (i.e., hypoxic) in LCC6(HER-2) than in LCC6(Vector) tumors (16.41 +/- 8.1% and 5.96 +/- 4.1%, respectively; P = 0.0015). Protein levels of phosphorylated (Ser(536)) nuclear factor-kappaB p65 were significantly elevated in LCC6(HER-2) tumors (P = 0.00048), and a trend in increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein levels was observed in LCC6(HER-2) compared with LCC6(Vector) tumors. Despite the substantial viable hypoxic cell fraction and a 1.7-fold increase of vascular endothelial growth factor protein (P = 0.05) in LCC6(HER-2) tumors, no significant differences were found (P > 0.05) between LCC6(HER-2) and LCC6(Vector) vasculature (CD31 staining and Hoechst 33342 perfusion).

{"title": "Development and pathology of the hyaloid, choroidal and retinal vasculature.", "abstract": "During embryogenesis, the development and differentiation of the eye requires the concomitant formation of the neural/glial elements along with a dense vascular network. The adult neural retina is supported by two distinct vascular systems, the proper retinal vessels and the choroidal vessels. The two beds differ not only in their pattern of embryonic differentiation, but also in their function in the adult organism. The retinal vasculature has barrier properties similar to those observed in the brain, whereas the choroidal vessels display a highly fenestrated phenotype. The hyaloid vasculature is a transient embryonic vascular bed which is complete at birth in mammals and regresses contemporaneously with the formation of the retinal vasculature. The dependence of the retina on its blood supply makes it highly vulnerable to any vascular changes and indeed ocular diseases, such as proliferative retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and the hyperplastic primary vitreous, which are associated with abnormalities of the different vascular beds of the eye. A number of factors have been implicated in developmental and pathological changes in vessel formation and regression, including fibroblast growth factors, platelet-derived endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, among others. The purpose of this review is to describe and discuss new insights into the mechanisms and molecular cues involved in the development of the normal and pathological vascular systems of the eye.

{"title": "Ocular surface epithelial and stem cell development.", "abstract": "Phenotypic features and developmental events involved in the genesis of the limbo-corneal and conjunctival epithelia are described. Together, these two epithelia define the ocular surface. They derive from a small cohort of optic vesicle-induced PAX6+ head ectodermal cells that remain on the surface following lens vesicle formation by the main PAX6+ cell cohort. Both epithelia are stratified, and display wet, non-keratinizing phenotypes. The most significant spatial feature of the limbo-corneal epithelium is the segregation of its supporting stem and early precursor cells to the limbus, the outer vascularized rim separating the cornea from the conjunctiva. These stem cells express ABCG2, a xenobiotic transporter present in stem cells from other organs. ABCG2 transport activity excludes the DNA dye Hoechst 33342, allowing the isolation of the ocular stem cells by flow cytometry, as a unique cohort known as a side 'side population'. Limbal stem cells do not form gap junctions and exist as metabolically isolated entities. Tracking of expression changes in Cx43, the main gap junction protein expressed in both the pre-epithelial ectoderm and in the mature central corneal epithelium, indicates that a limbal stem cell phenotype starts developing very soon after lens vesicle invagination, in advance of the appearance of any recognizable anatomical sub-epithelial limbal feature. Differences in Cx43 expression also reveal the very early nature of the divergence in limbo-corneal and conjunctival lineages.

While previous studies suggest that shear stress may upregulate Cx43, it is not well understood if shear stress affects the expression of all endothelial connexins and to what extent. Endothelial cells on the upstream and downstream surfaces of cardiac valves are subjected to considerably different intensities of shear stress. We therefore reasoned that we could determine the extent hemodynamic forces affect the expression of Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 by comparing their immunohistochemical distribution on the upstream and downstream surfaces of rat cardiac valves. We found 70- to 200-fold greater expression of Cx43 in the endothelial cells on the upstream than on the downstream surfaces. However, Cx37 was expressed almost equally in the endothelial cells on upstream and downstream surfaces, and Cx40, a major connexin in most vascular endothelial cells, was not detected on either surface. In addition to the heterogeneity in Cx43 expression, endothelial cells on the upstream surface were 35% to 65% smaller than those on the corresponding downstream surface.

In this study, the optimal culture condition for induction of differentiation of epithelial progenitor cells from embryonic stem (ES) cells was determined for use in transplantation to damaged cornea in mice.\nMouse ES cells were cultured on Petri dishes coated with several extracellular matrix proteins, and the markers for epithelial cells were analyzed with RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The optimal condition for induction of epithelial progenitor cells was determined, and the progenitors were transplanted onto mouse eyes with corneal epithelia that had been damaged by exposure to n-heptanol.\nEpithelial progenitors were successfully induced by culturing mouse ES cells on type IV collagen for 8 days. These progenitors expressed keratin (K)12, which is specific to corneal epithelial cells, and cell surface CD44 and E-cadherin, both of which are essential in corneal epithelial wound healing. Complete re-epithelialization of the corneal surface occurred within 24 hours after transplantation. The resultant corneal epithelial cells expressed markers of the grafted cells, and no teratomata were observed during the follow-up period.\nEpithelial progenitors were successfully induced in vitro from ES cells and were applicable as grafts for treating corneal epithelial injury.

The vascular supply to the lateral compartment peroneal muscles was investigated in 10 fresh cadaveric lower limbs. The peroneal muscles are supplied by two principal sources arteries, the anterior tibial artery (ATA) and the peroneal artery (PA). The ATA is the dominant artery and supplies the proximal and middle thirds of these muscles. The PA is considered to be a supplementary vascular source and supplies the distal thirds of these muscles. After harvesting the PA in a fibular flap, regions of the peroneal muscles preoperatively vascularized by its branches become supplied through the anastomotic \"choke\" vessels between the ATA and the PA. Primary closure of the cutaneous defect increases the possibility of developing a pseudo-compartment syndrome with necrosis of the more precariously vascularized portions of the peroneal muscles. This complication is difficult to diagnosis early and the reason why we advocate that direct skin closure following composite harvest must be avoided.

{"title": "Approaches to improve angiogenesis in tissue-engineered skin.", "abstract": "A problem with tissue-engineered skin is clinical failure due to delays in vascularization. The aim of this study was to explore a number of simple strategies to improve angiogenesis/vascularization using a tissue-engineered model of skin to which small vessel human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were added. For the majority of these studies, a modified Guirguis chamber was used, which allowed the investigation of several variables within the same experiment using the same human dermis; cell type, angiogenic growth factors, the influence of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, mechanical penetration of the human dermis, the site of endothelial cell addition, and the influence of hypoxia were all examined. A qualitative scoring system was used to assess the impact of these factors on the penetration of endothelial cells throughout the dermis. Similar results were achieved using freshly isolated small vessel human dermal microvascular endothelial cells or an endothelial cell line and a minimum cell seeding density was identified. Cell penetration was not influenced by the addition of angiogenic growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor); similarly, including epidermal keratinocytes or dermal fibroblasts did not encourage endothelial cell entry, and neither did mechanical introduction of holes throughout the dermis. Two factors were identified that significantly enhanced endothelial cell penetration into the dermis: hypoxia and the site of endothelial cell addition. Endothelial cells added from the papillary surface entered into the dermis much more effectively than when cells were added to the reticular surface of the dermis.

{"title": "The relationship between temporal variation of hypoxia, polarographic measurements and predictions of tumour response to radiation.", "abstract": "The polarographic oxygen sensor is one of the most used devices for in vivo measurements of oxygen and many other measurement techniques for measuring tumour hypoxia are correlated with electrode measurements. Little is known however about the relationship between electrode measurements and the real tissue oxygenation. This paper investigates the influence of the temporal change of the hypoxic pattern on the electrode measurements and the tumour response. Electrode measurements and tumour response were simulated using a computer program that allows both the calculation of the tissue oxygenation with respect to the two types of hypoxia that might arise in tumours and the virtual insertion of the electrode into the tissue. It was therefore possible to control the amount of each type of hypoxia in order to investigate their influence on the measurement results. Tissues with several vascular architectures ranging from well oxygenated to poorly oxygenated were taken into consideration as might be seen in practice. The influence of the electrode measurements on the treatment outcome was estimated by calculating the tumour control probability for the tumours characterized either by the real or by the measured tumour oxygenation. We have simulated electrode oxygen measurements in different types of tissues, covering a wide range of tumour oxygenations. The results of the simulations showed that the measured distribution depends on the details of the vascular network and not on the type of hypoxia. We have also simulated the effects of the temporal change of the acute hypoxic pattern due to the opening and the closure of different blood vessels during a full fractionated treatment. The results of this simulation suggested that the temporal variation of the hypoxic pattern does not lead to significantly different results for the electrode measurements or the predicted tumour control probabilities. In conclusion, it was found that the averaging effect of the electrode leads to a systematic deviation between the actual oxygen distribution and the measured distribution. However, as the electrode reflects the general trends of the tissue oxygenation it has the potential of being used for the general characterization of tumour hypoxia even if the actual type of hypoxia measured by the electrode cannot be determined. Indeed, the change in time of the acute hypoxic region does not compensate for the lack of oxygenation at a specific moment and therefore does not influence the polarographic oxygen measurements.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2004-11-24", "authors": ["IulianaToma-Da\u015fu", "AlexandruDa\u015fu", "MikaelKarlsson"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/49/19/002"}

In the present study, we assessed the impact of single or combined MMP deficiencies in in vivo and in vitro models of angiogenesis (malignant keratinocyte transplantation and the aortic ring assay, respectively). MMP-9 was predominantly expressed by neutrophils in tumor transplants, whereas MMP-2 and MMP-3 were stromal. Neither the single deficiency of MMP-2, MMP-3, or MMP-9, nor the combined absence of MMP-9 and MMP-3 did impair tumor invasion and vascularization in vivo. However, there was a striking cooperative effect in double MMP-2:MMP-9-deficient mice as demonstrated by the absence of tumor vascularization and invasion. In contrast, the combined lack of MMP-2 and MMP-9 did not impair the in vitro capillary outgrowth from aortic rings. These results point to the importance of a cross talk between several host cells for the in vivo tumor promoting and angiogenic effects of MMP-2 and MMP-9.

We perform 2-D simulations based on a self-consistent parameter estimation that demonstrate fundamental convective and diffusive transport limitations in delivering anticancer drug into tumors, whether this delivery is via free drug administration (e.g., intravenous drip), or via 100 nm nanoparticles injected into the bloodstream, extravasating and releasing the drug that then diffuses into the tumoral tissue, or via smaller 1-10 nm nanoparticles that are capable of diffusing directly and targeting the individual tumor cell. Even in a best-case scenario involving: constant (\"smart\") drug release from the nanoparticles; a homogenous tumor of one cell type, which is drug-sensitive and does not develop resistance; targeted nanoparticle delivery, with resulting low host tissue toxicity; and for model parameters calibrated to ensure sufficient drug or nanoparticle blood concentration to rapidly kill all cells in vitro ; our analysis shows that fundamental transport limitations are severe and that drug levels inside the tumor are far less than in vitro , leaving large parts of the tumor with inadequate drug concentration. A comparison of cell death rates predicted by our simulations reveals that the in vivo rate of tumor shrinkage is several orders of magnitude less than in vitro for equal chemotherapeutic carrier concentrations in the blood serum and in vitro, and after some shrinkage the tumor may achieve a new mass equilibrium far above detectable levels. We also demonstrate that adjuvant anti-angiogenic therapy \"normalizing\" the vasculature may ameliorate transport limitations, although leading to unwanted tumor fragmentation. Finally, our results suggest that small nanoparticles equipped with active transport mechanisms (e.g., chemotaxis) would overcome the predicted limitations and result in improved tumor response.", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2004-11-19", "authors": ["JSinek", "HFrieboes", "XZheng", "VCristini"], "doi": "10.1023/B:BMMD.0000048562.29657.64"}

ART also inhibits growth of many transformed cell lines. In the present investigation, we show that ART inhibited the growth of normal human umbilical endothelial cells and of KS-IMM cells that we have established from a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion obtained from a renal transplant patient. The growth inhibitory activity correlated with the induction of apoptosis in KS-IMM cells. Apoptosis was not observed in normal endothelial cells, which, however, showed drastically increased cell doubling times upon ART treatment. ART strongly reduced angiogenesis in vivo in terms of vascularization of Matrigel plugs injected subcutaneously into syngenic mice. We conclude that ART represents a promising candidate drug for the treatment of the highly angiogenic Kaposi's sarcoma. As a low-cost drug, it might be of particular interest for areas of Kaposi's sarcoma endemics.

Halofuginone (HF) is a potent inhibitor of collagen type alpha1(I). In solid tumor models, HF has a potent antitumor and antiangiogenic effect in vivo, but its effect on brain tumors has not yet been evaluated. By employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we monitored the effect of HF on tumor progression and vascularization by utilizing an implanted malignant fibrous histiocytoma metastatic rat brain tumor model. Here we demonstrate that treatment with HF effectively and dose-dependently reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis. On day 13, HF-treated tumors were fivefold smaller than control (P < .001). Treatment with HF significantly prolonged survival of treated animals (142%; P = .001). In HF-treated rats, tumor vascularization was inhibited by 30% on day 13 and by 37% on day 19 (P < .05). Additionally, HF treatment inhibited vessel maturation (P = .03). Finally, in HF-treated rats, we noticed the appearance of a few clusters of satellite tumors, which were distinct from the primary tumor and usually contained vessel cores. This phenomenon was relatively moderate when compared to previous reports of other antiangiogenic agents used to treat brain tumors.

{"title": "Air breathing and ammonia excretion in the giant mudskipper, Periophthalmodon schlosseri.", "abstract": "The giant mudskipper, Periophthalmodon schlosseri, is an amphibious, obligate, air-breathing teleost fish. It uses its buccal cavity for air breathing and for taking and holding large gulps of air. These fish live in mud burrows at the top of the intertidal zone of mangrove mudflats; the burrow water may be hypoxic and hypercapnic and have high ammonia levels. The buccal epithelium is highly vascularized, with small diffusion distances between air and blood. The gill epithelium is densely packed with mitochondria-rich cells. Periophthalmodon schlosseri can maintain tissue ammonia levels in the face of high ammonia concentrations in the water. This is probably achieved by active ammonium ion transport across the mitochondria-rich cells via an apical Na/H+(NH4+) exchanger and a basolateral Na/K+(NH4+) ATPase. When exposed to air, the animal reduces ammonia production, but there is some increase in tissue ammonia levels after 24 h. There is no detoxification by increased production of glutamine or urea, but there is partial amino acid catabolism, leading to the accumulation of alanine. CO2 production and proton excretion cause acidification of the burrow water to reduce ammonia toxicity. The skin has high levels of cholesterol and saturated fatty acids decreasing membrane fluidity and gas, and therefore ammonia, permeability. Exposure to elevated environmental ammonia further decreases membrane permeability. Acidification of the environment and having a skin with a low NH3 permeability reduces ammonia influx, so that the fish can maintain tissue ammonia levels by active ammonium ion excretion, even in water containing high levels of ammonia.", "journal": "Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ", "date": "2004-11-18", "authors": ["D JRandall", "Y KIp", "S FChew", "J MWilson"], "doi": "10.1086/423745"}

In the current study, we investigated the role of mesangial cells (MCs) in endothelial vascularization by using a three-dimensional co-culture system in basement-membrane reconstruct gel (Matrigel).\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) and human MCs were used. In the contact co-culture system, ECs and MCs were mixed and then plated together onto Matrigel. In the non-contact co-culture system, MCs were cultured within an intercup chamber, which prevented direct physical contact with the ECs on the Matrigel but allowed both cell types to share culture medium. To visualize ECs and MCs, the cells were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes prior to the co-culture. A capillary-like network formation was observed under a fluorescent microscope and confocal microscope, and the length of the network formation was quantified by the image analyzer.\nECs barely formed capillary-like networks when cultured alone in growth factor-free medium. However, ECs cultured with MCs in a contact condition remarkably formed capillary-like networks (9.10+/-0.96 vs 0.20+/-0.07 mm/mm2 at 6 h, contact vs ECs alone, P<0.001). Direct contact between ECs and MCs was clearly demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Differentiation into branching capillary-like structures was also observed in the non-contact co-culture system (3.02+/-1.21 mm/mm2 at 6 h, P<0.001 vs ECs alone), but less prominently than in the contact co-culture condition. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was secreted from MCs, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescent study. Adding neutralizing antibodies against VEGF into the co-culture system partially inhibited capillary network formation.\nOur data indicate that MCs help ECs differentiate toward vascularization, in which the direct cell-cell contact between ECs and MCs plays an important role.

Enhancing myocardial neovascularization is a major goal of myocardial cell transplantation because it would provide patients, who cannot undergo conventional revascularization, with an alternative therapy. Additionally, neovascularization would provide the implanted cells with adequate microenvironment to enhance survival and function. This short review gives an overview of the effect of various cell transplantation strategies on myocardial neovascularization.

{"title": "Growth factor activation in myocardial vascularization: therapeutic implications.", "abstract": "A rapid growth of the coronary vasculature occurs during prenatal and early postnatal periods as precursor cells from the epi- and sub-epicardium differentiate, migrate and form vascular structures (vasculogenesis) which then fuse, branch and in some cases recruit cells to form three tunics (angiogenesis). These processes are tightly controlled by temporally and spatially expressed growth factors which are stimulated by metabolic and mechanical factors. The process of angiogenesis in the myocardium is not limited to developmental periods of life, but may occur when the heart is challenged by enhanced loading conditions or during hypoxia or ischemia. This review focuses on the activation of growth factors by metabolic and mechanical stimuli in the developing heart and in the adult heart undergoing adaptive responses. Experimental studies support the hypotheses that both metabolic (hypoxia) and mechanical (stretch) factors serve as powerful stimuli for the up-regulation of growth factors which facilitate angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Both hypoxia and stretch are powerful inducers of VEGF and its receptors, and provide for paracrine and autocrine signaling. In addition to the VEGF family, bFGF and angiopoietins play major roles in myocardial vascularization. Sufficient evidence supports the hypothesis that mechanical (e.g., bradycardia) and metabolic (e.g., thyroxine analogs) may provide effective non-invasive angiogenic therapies for the ischemic and post-infarcted heart.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2004-11-17", "authors": ["Robert JTomanek", "WeiZheng", "XinpingYue"], "doi": "10.1023/b:mcbi.0000044369.88528.a3"}

TGF-betaRI and -RII were enhanced within 3 days of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and remained elevated for up 7 days post-I/R; TGF-beta receptor expression was localized primarily in regenerating tubules within the outer medulla. A neutralizing TGF-beta antibody exacerbated cellular proliferation observed on day 3 postischemia but had no effect on day 1 or 2. TGF-beta antibody treatment had no measurable effect on loss of renal function or the restoration of renal function during the recovery response for up to 35 days postsurgery. However, ischemic injury resulted in modest renal hypertrophy that is due, in part, to in an increase in the number of interstitial cells in the postischemic kidney.

Anti-TGF-beta treatment substantially attenuated the renal hypertrophy, interstitial cellularity, and S100A4-positive cells present at 35 days post-I/R. Finally, TGF-beta immunoneutralization attenuated the loss of renal vascular density following recovery from I/R injury.

{"title": "Periodic Delta-like 4 expression in developing retinal arteries.", "abstract": "During vascular development, Notch signalling plays important roles in cell-cell communication and cell fate decisions. We studied expression of Notch 1-4 and its ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll4) in the developing retinal vasculature. Dll4 mRNA is strongly expressed in endothelial cells at the very tips of growing vessels ('tip cells') and also in arteries, where it is expressed in a segmented 'tiger's tail' pattern. This implies that developing retinal arteries contain different types of endothelial cells, Dll4-positive and Dll4-negative. The Dll4-positive stripes do not correspond to any obvious morphological property of the vascular network but correlate to some extent with the distribution of platelet derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) mRNA. However, PDGF-B expression is neither as artery-specific nor as clearly segmented as Dll4. Possible target cells for Dll4 signalling are retinal astrocytes (Notch1 positive), arterial pericytes (Notch3 positive) or arterial endothelial cells themselves (Notch4 positive). However, there is no clear reciprocity of Notch and Dll4 expression that allows identification of the interacting cells. Nevertheless, Dll4 stripes are a novel property of immature arteries, the origin and function of which remain to be explained.", "journal": "Gene expression patterns : GEP", "date": "2004-11-10", "authors": ["SuzanneClaxton", "MarcusFruttiger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.modgep.2004.05.004"}

During ovarian stimulation, follicles in PCOs required a lesser amount of FSH to acquire the same level of vascularization than the follicles in normal ovaries. In addition, hCG induced an increase in the follicular vascularization in both normal and PCOs. The follicle count correlated with the total vascularized volume in the ovaries throughout the IVF cycle.\nFollicles in PCOs seem to be less vascularized than the follicles in normal ovaries after GnRH treatment but not after gonadotropin stimulation.

The present study determined whether estrogen regulates these important aspects of primate development. VEG/PF mRNA levels were determined by competitive RT-PCR in isolated villous placental cells, and placental vascularization was assessed by image analysis. Placentas were obtained on d 60 of gestation (length of gestation is 184 d) from baboons in which estrogen levels on d 25-59 were increased by daily administration of aromatizable androstenedione or decreased by aromatase inhibitor CGS 20267. Androstenedione treatment increased maternal serum estradiol levels 3-fold (P < 0.01) and placental villous cytotrophoblast VEG/PF mRNA level to a value (mean +/- se, 26,836 +/- 5,625 attomoles/microg total RNA) 2.5-fold greater (P < 0.05) than that in untreated animals (11,645 +/- 1,746 attomoles/microg RNA).

{"title": "Gene transfer for therapeutic vascular growth in myocardial and peripheral ischemia.", "abstract": "Therapeutic vascular growth in the treatment of peripheral and myocardial ischemia has not yet fulfilled its expectations in clinical trials. Randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trials have predominantly shown the safety and feasibility but not the clear-cut clinically relevant efficacy of angiogenic gene or recombinant growth factor therapy. It is likely that growth factor levels achieved with single injections of recombinant protein or naked plasmid DNA are too low to induce any relevant angiogenic effects. Also, the route of administration of gene transfer vectors has not been optimal in many cases leading to low gene-transfer efficacy. Animal experiments using intramuscular or intramyocardial injections of adenovirus encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, VEGF-A), the mature form of VEGF-D, and fibroblast growth factors (FGF-1, -2, and -4) have shown high angiogenic efficacy. Adenoviral overexpression of VEGF receptor-2 ligands, VEGF-A and the mature form of VEGF-D, enlarge the preexisting capillaries in skeletal muscle and myocardium via nitric oxide(NO)-mediated mechanisms and via proliferation of both endothelial cells and pericytes, resulting in markedly increased tissue perfusion. VEGF also enhances collateral growth, which is probably secondary to increased peripheral capillary blood flow and shear stress. As a side effect of VEGF overexpression and rapid microvessel enlargement, vascular permeability increases and may result in substantial tissue edema and pericardial effusion in the heart. Because of the transient adenoviral gene expression, the majority of angiogenic effects and side effects return to baseline by 2 weeks after the gene transfer. In contrast, VEGF overexpression lasting over 4 weeks has been shown to induce the growth of a persistent vascular network in preclinical models. To improve efficacy, the choice of the vascular growth factor, gene transfer vector, and route of administration should be optimized in future clinical trials.

Most deaths from melanoma result from metastases. Semaphorins have been shown to inhibit neuronal and endothelial cell migration, but the effects of semaphorins on tumor metastasis have not been documented. We found that semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F) was markedly downregulated in highly metastatic human cell lines in vitro and in vivo, which suggested that it may be a metastasis inhibitor. Metastatic human melanoma cells were transfected with SEMA3F and implanted into mice; the resultant tumors did not metastasize. Rather, the primary tumors resembled benign nevi characterized by large areas of apoptosis, diminished vascularity, inhibition of hyperplasia in overlying epidermal cells, and encapsulated tumor borders delineated by thick layers of fibroblasts and collagen matrix. This phenotype is in stark contrast to highly invasive, vascular mock-transfected tumors. In vitro, tumor cells expressing SEMA3F had a diminished capacity to adhere and migrate on fibronectin. Consistent with semaphorin-mediated chemorepulsion of neurons, tumor cells expressing SEMA3F were chemorepulsive for vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells expressing neuropilin-2 (NRP2), a novel mechanism for a tumor angiogenesis inhibitor. The repulsive activity was abrogated by NRP2 RNA interference.

Netrin-1 stimulates proliferation, induces migration, and promotes adhesion of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells with a specific activity comparable to vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Our evidence indicates that the netrin receptor, Neogenin, mediates netrin signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells, but suggests that an unidentified receptor mediates the proangiogenic effects of Netrin-1 on endothelial cells. Netrin-1 also stimulates angiogenesis in vivo and augments the response to vascular endothelial growth factor.

Studies were conducted to identify the tumor-derived mediators and signaling pathways that lead to this increased endothelial cell motility. Using the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor model, these studies showed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) were the mediators that were responsible for the migration-stimulatory activity produced by the tumor cells. The response of endothelial cells to these tumor-derived motility-stimulatory factors involved a decline in the activity of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP-2A. Inhibition PP-2A either pharmacologically or genetically increased endothelial cell migration. Concurrent with the decline in PP-2A activity as a result of exposure to PGE2/TGFbeta was a loss of PP-2A co-precipitation with the inositol phosphatase PTEN and an increase in the PTEN serine phosphorylation level. Since hyperphosphorylation has been shown to inhibit the ability of PTEN to act as an antagonist to phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the role of PI3K in PGE2/TGFbeta-stimulated migration was examined.

{"title": "Immunohistochemical demonstration and semi-quantitation of vascular endothelial growth factor in recurrent versus non-recurrent nasal polyps.", "abstract": "The expression of some growth factors in nasal polyps has been examined, although investigations addressing the reason for recurrence in some patients are lacking. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is expressed by inflammatory cells, as well as by endothelial and epithelial cells of nasal polyps. To determine whether VEGF may play a role in the recurrence of nasal polyps, we aimed to compare VEGF expression in recurrent versus non-recurrent polyps. In addition, expression in polyps from asthmatic patients was compared with that in polyps from non-asthmatics.\nA total of 30 patients with newly diagnosed nasal polyposis were included. Polypectomy was performed at enrolment in the long-term follow-up study. Fifteen patients had only 1 polypectomy (non-recurrence group; median observation period 81 months) and 15 had a median of 6.4 polypectomies (multiple recurrence group; median observation period 108 months). Five of 10 patients with asthma belonged to the non-recurrence group and 5 to the recurrence group. The polyp obtained at the initial polypectomy was examined for expression of VEGF by immunohistochemistry, using a polyclonal antibody. A blinded semi-quantitation and comparison of the intensity of immunolabelling were performed in recurrent versus non-recurrent polyps, as well as in asthmatics versus non-asthmatics.\nVEGF expression was seen as varying staining of the polyp surface and gland epithelium, as well as of the vessel endothelium and some stromal mono- and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Semi-quantitation of the staining intensity showed no significant differences between recurrent and non-recurrent polyps, or between asthmatics and non-asthmatics.\nOur findings indicate that the level of immunohistochemical expression of VEGF in recurrent and nonrecurrent nasal polyposis is equivalent. Thus, the level of VEGF expression cannot predict a subsequent recurrence. The expression of VEGF is not upregulated in patients with asthma. Further studies are needed to determine the role of VEGF in nasal polyposis, with special reference to different stages of polyp formation, vascularization and growth.", "journal": "Acta oto-laryngologica", "date": "2004-11-02", "authors": ["PerCay\u00e9-Thomasen", "KnudLarsen", "PeterTingsgaard", "MirkoTos"], "doi": "10.1080/00016480310002096"}
{"title": "Influence of ovarian ornithine decarboxylase in folliculogenesis and luteinization.", "abstract": "LH plays a relevant role in folliculogenesis, ovulation, and luteinization. Although ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, is a target of LH in the ovary, the functional significance of ODC induction has remained elusive. Our study reveals that the blockade of the induction of ovarian ODC by means of the specific inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) affects folliculogenesis and luteinization. In immature female mice, DFMO was found to inhibit ovarian growth, the formation of Graafian follicles, and the secretion of progesterone and estradiol. In adult cycling females, the administration of DFMO on the evening/night of proestrus markedly decreased plasma progesterone levels at diestrus, which was associated to the decrease in the expression of steroidogenic factor 1, cytochrome cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme, and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in the ovary and to a reduced vascularization of the corpora lutea. These effects were not reverted by the administration of gonadotropins or prolactin. ODC immunoreactivity was also stimulated by LH in theca and granulosa cells of antral follicles but not in preantral follicles. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that elevated ODC values found in the ovary of immature and adult mice play a relevant function in ovarian physiology and that ODC/polyamines must be considered as important mediators of some of the effects of LH on follicular development and luteinization.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2004-10-30", "authors": ["Carmen MBastida", "Asunci\u00f3nCremades", "Maria TCastells", "Andr\u00e9s JL\u00f3pez-Contreras", "CarlosL\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda", "FranciscoTejada", "RafaelPe\u00f1afiel"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2004-1004"}

{"title": "Reconstruction of ablated rat rectus abdominis by muscle regeneration.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle regeneration is a powerful, naturally occurring process of tissue reconstruction that follows myofiber damage secondary to myotoxic injury that does not normally affect the tissue circulation and scaffold. The ablated tissue, in traumatology and free muscle grafts, is frequently replaced by scars. The final outcome is poor even after in situ myoblast seeding of the harvested muscle. The goal of this study was to identify protocols to reconstruct muscle tissue, even in such adverse environments. The authors applied a step-by-step approach to identify factors favoring the survival of autologous satellite cells and, thus, muscle regeneration. In a rat model of full-thickness rectus abdominis muscle ablation, autologous myoblasts were isolated from the explanted rectus abdominis and seeded in a homologous acellular matrix immediately after wall reconstruction (group 1, five animals). In group 2 (five animals), the ablated rectus abdominis was autografted in situ. In a third group of five rats, Marcaine was injected into both the autograft and the surrounding abdominal wall muscle. Three weeks after surgery, serial cross-sections of the reconstructed abdominal wall were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or embryonic myosin antibody, a well-characterized molecular marker of early myogenesis in development and regeneration. Percentages of the patch area covered by regenerated myofibers were determined by morphometry. When autologous myoblasts were seeded in a homologous acellular matrix, the only myofibers observed to regenerate were those along the border of the patch. Autografting of the middle third of the rectus abdominis muscle similarly resulted in scar formation. The few muscle cells in the graft core were scanty myoblasts that could be detected only by monoclonal embryonic myosin antibody. Although negative for myofiber regeneration, the results in both cases confirmed the mechanical patency of the patches with regard to abdominal organ support. Myofibers were successfully regenerated in the graft by injecting Marcaine into both the autograft and the surrounding muscles. Three weeks after surgery, the patch was paved with young, centrally nucleated myofibers intermixed with young myofibers and myotubes expressing embryonic myosin. The difference in percentage of patch area covered by regenerated myofibers in group 3 (Marcaine injection around the patch, 81.6 +/- 3.0 percent) (mean +/- SD) versus either group 1 (Myoblast-seeded acellular patch, 18.0 +/- 3.0 percent) or group 2 (Autograft, 25.8 +/- 7.0 percent) was statistically significant on independent t test analysis (p < 0.0001). Even an acellular matrix showed some myofiber regeneration after surrounding muscles had been injected with Marcaine. This is the first successful evidence of muscle reconstruction after full-thickness ablation of the middle third of the rectus abdominis. Muscle regeneration seems to be the result of successive waves of migration of angioblasts and then satellite cell-derived myoblasts from the muscles surrounding the patch. The results strongly suggest that vascularization of the scaffold and successive coordinate proliferation of the seeded cells are required for myoblasts to be able to migrate into the patch and differentiate up to myofiber stage.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-10-29", "authors": ["VincenzoVindigni", "FrancescoMazzoleni", "KatiaRossini", "MartaFabbian", "Maria ElenaZanin", "FrancoBassetto", "UgoCarraro"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000138253.96709.e5"}
{"title": "One-stage reconstruction of composite bone and soft-tissue defects in traumatic lower extremities.", "abstract": "Management of bone loss that occurs after severe trauma of open lower extremity fractures continues to challenge reconstructive surgeons. Sixty-one patients who had 62 traumatic open lower extremity fractures and combined bone and composite soft-tissue defects were treated with the following protocol: extensive debridement of necrotic tissues, eradication of infection, and vascularization of osteocutaneous tissue for one-stage bone and soft-tissue coverage reconstruction. The mechanism of injury included 49 motorcycle accidents (80.3 percent), five falls (8.2 percent), three crush injuries (4.9 percent), two pedestrian-automobile accidents (3.3 percent), and two motor vehicle accidents (3.3 percent). The bone defects were located in the tibia in 49 patients (79 percent; one patient had bilateral open tibial fractures), in the femur in seven patients (11.3 percent), in the calcaneus bone in four patients (6.5 percent), and in the metatarsal bones in two patients (3.2 percent). The size of soft-tissue defects ranged from 5 x 9 cm to 30 x 17 cm. The average length of the preoperative bony defect was 11.7 cm. The average duration from injury to one-stage reconstruction was 27.1 days, and the average number of previous extensive debridement procedures was 3.4. Fifty patients had vascularized fibula osteoseptocutaneous flaps, six had vascularized iliac osteocutaneous flaps, and five patients had seven combined vascularized rib transfers with serratus anterior muscle and/or latissimus dorsi muscle transfers. One patient received a second combined rib flap because the first combined rib flap failed. The rate of complete flap survival was 88.9 percent (56 of 63 flaps). Two combined vascularized rib transfers with serratus anterior muscle and latissimus dorsi muscle flaps were lost totally (3.2 percent) because of arterial thrombosis and deep infection, respectively. Partial skin flap losses were encountered in the five fibula osteoseptocutaneous flaps (7.9 percent). Postoperative infection for this one-stage reconstruction was 7.9 percent. Excluding the failed flap and the infected/amputated limb, the primary bony union rate after successful free vascularized bone grafting was 88.5 percent (54 of 61 transfers). The average primary union time was 6.9 months. The overall union rate was 96.7 percent (59 of 61 transfers). The average time to overall union was 8.5 months after surgery. Seven transferred vascularized bones had stress fractures, for a rate of 11.5 percent. Donor-site problems were noted in six fibular flaps, in two iliac flaps, and in one rib flap. The fibular donor-site problems were foot drop in one patient, superficial peroneal nerve palsy in one patient, contracture of the flexor hallucis longus muscle in two patients, and skin necrosis after split-thickness skin grafting in two patients. The iliac flap donor-site problems were temporary flank pain in one patient and lateral thigh numbness in the other. One rib flap transfer patient had pleural fibrosis.

Transfected cells were implanted intracerebrally into syngenic Fischer 344 rats. We demonstrated by means of magnetic resonance imaging that increased hAng-1 expression promoted a significant in vivo growth of intracerebral gliomas in rats. Overexpression of hAng-1 resulted in more numerous, more highly branched vessels, which were covered by pericytes. On the other hand, tumors derived from hAng-2-overexpressing cells were smaller than empty-plasmid control tumors. The tumor vasculature in these tumors was composed of aberrant small vascular cords, which were associated with few mural cells. Our results indicate that in the presence of hAng-1, tumors induce a more functional vascular network, which led to better tumor perfusion and growth.

GAS6 and Axl are both expressed in endothelial cells, where they are involved in many processes such as leukocyte transmigration through capillaries and neointima formation in injured vessels. Here, we show that Axl stimulation by GAS6 results in inhibition of the ligand-dependent activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 and the consequent activation of an angiogenic program in vascular endothelial cells. GAS6 inhibits chemotaxis of endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF-A isoforms, but not that triggered by fibroblast growth factor-2 or hepatocyte growth factor. Furthermore, it inhibits endothelial cell morphogenesis on Matrigel and VEGF-A-dependent vascularization of chick chorion allantoid membrane. GAS6 activates the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2), which is instrumental in the negative feedback exerted by Axl on VEGF-A activities. A dominant-negative SHP-2 mutant, in which Cys 459 is substituted by Ser, reverted the effect of GAS6 on stimulation of VEGF receptor 2 and endothelial chemotaxis triggered by VEGF-A.

Then, the fluorescence pharmacokinetics and the photodynamic effects of the porphyrin on CAM vessels were evaluated after intravenous administration of either a p-THPP solution (free drug) or the drug loaded into nanoparticles.

Despite recent advances in reconstruction techniques, total gastrectomy is still accompanied by various complications. As an alternative treatment, a tissue engineered stomach that replaces the mechanical and metabolic functions of a normal stomach is proposed. Stomach epithelium organoid units were isolated from syngeneic adult rats and seeded onto biodegradable polymers. These constructs were implanted into the omenta of recipient adult rats. All constructs were harvested for histologic and immunohistochemical examination at designated time points. Cyst-like structures were formed that showed the development of vascularized tissue with a neomucosa. Immunohistochemical staining for alpha-actin smooth muscle, gastric mucin, and proton pump indicated the presence of a smooth muscle layer and gastric epithelium, as well as the existence of parietal cells of the stomach mucosa, respectively. Epithelium derived stomach organoid units seeded on biodegradable polymers were transplanted in donor rats and have been shown to vascularize, survive, and regenerate into complex tissue resembling a native stomach.

Because the omentum is composed of lobes of adipose tissue with abundant blood vessels and has been used for organ reconstruction, we used the omentum as an in vivo culture system to promote cellular proliferation upon the scaffold. Two kinds of autogenous cells, oral epithelial cells and rib chondrocytes, obtained from canine were isolated and then seeded on porous poly-lactic-glycolic acid scaffolds of a pre-determined shape and size. Comparison was performed in two groups. In Group 1, cell-polymer constructs were cultured in vitro for 2 weeks, and in group 2, cell-polymer constructs were cultured in vitro for 1 week following the same protocol as group 1 but were then implanted into the omentum of same canines for the next week. We performed histologic analysis of tissue formation between the two groups. In group 1, seeded cells were presented spatially along the porous polymer surface only. However, in group 2, the cell-polymer constructs maintained their original dimensions and showed formation of a multicell layered structure with abundant blood vessels.

{"title": "Anatomical study of perforator arteries in the distally based radial forearm fasciosubcutaneous flap.", "abstract": "We investigated the anatomical vascular basis of the forearm fasciosubcutaneous flap (FSC-F), fed by the distal perforator arteries of the fascia. This type of flap was proposed, in hand reconstructive surgery, to avoid the disadvantages caused by axial-pattern reverse radial forearm fasciocutaneous flap, based on ligation and rotation of the radial artery (RA). In eight fresh cadaveric forearms, the RA was injected slowly with acrylic resin and the superficial flexor compartment was dissected. Then the FSC-F was raised from the lateral margins of the sample to the median RA axis, and the collaterals of the RA (number, interval of origin, and caliber) were evaluated. The fascial branches of RA (mean number +/- SD: 20 +/- 3) originated mainly from the radial and ulnar sides of the RA. In the distal forearm the vessels were more numerous (mean value = 11.3 vs. 8.9; Student's t-test, P < 0.05) but smaller in diameter (mean value = 0.45 mm vs. 0.63 mm; Student's t-test, P < 0.05). The perforator arteries forked in a T-shape following the main axis of the forearm and anastomosed in the fascial plane, forming longitudinal fan-shaped arterial chains giving rise to the vascular epifascial network. Histological (hematoxylin-eosin, azan-Mallory, Weigert) and immunohistochemical (anti-von Willebrand factor) study of the FSC-F at different levels of sampling was also carried out. The epifascial branches of distal sections were smaller in diameter (78.3 +/- 35.5 microm) than those of intermediate (105.7 +/- 28.7 microm; Newman-Keuls test, P < 0.01) and proximal (116.8 +/- 31.2 microm; Newman-Keuls test, P < 0.001) sections. Our findings indicate that the perforator arteries and epifascial branches are smaller in the distal forearm, so that during surgical dissection, the safety distance from the radial styloid should take into account that also in the presence of a sufficient number of vessels in the distal forearm their caliber could be inadequate to the hemodynamic request of the flap. Thus, rather than on a theoretic distance from the radial styloid, the length of the flap should be based on an accurate evaluation of the individual vascularization of the forearm case by case.", "journal": "Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2004-10-21", "authors": ["CesareTiengo", "VeronicaMacchi", "AndreaPorzionato", "FrancescoBassetto", "FrancoMazzoleni", "RaffaeleDe Caro"], "doi": "10.1002/ca.20009"}

However, success has been limited by the vigorous rejection response elicited against solid organs transplanted across species barriers. Mixed xenogeneic bone marrow chimeras resulting from the transplantation of a mixture of host and donor marrow (B10 mouse + F344 rat --> B10 mouse) results in donor-specific cross-species transplantation tolerance for subsequent nonvascularized skin and islet grafts. Furthermore, compared with fully xenogeneic chimeras (rat --> mouse), mixed xenogeneic chimeras exhibit superior immunocompetence for infectious agents in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that the immune system is intact. The ability to establish long-term humoral and cellular tolerance for primarily vascularized xenografts in vivo, in the setting of both recipient and donor Ig and effector cell production, has not previously been characterized. Mixed xenogeneic chimeras exhibit donor-specific humoral tolerance as evident by the absence of anti-donor Ab and Ab-dependent donor-specific cytotoxicity in vitro and intravascular IgM deposition within donor-strain (F344) cardiac xenografts in vivo. F344 cardiac xenografts are accepted (median > or =180 days) without clinical or histologic evidence of rejection, suggesting cellular tolerance. In contrast, MHC-disparate third-party mouse (B10.BR) and rat (ACI or WF) grafts are rejected (median of 23 and 41 days, respectively) in association with extensive mononuclear cell infiltration and vascular deposits of mouse IgM.

Recently, EGFR has been shown to increase the activity of NF-kappaB and to induce angiogenesis. In this report, we asked if IkappaBalphaM gene transfer into human glioma cell lines would inhibit tumorigenicity and angiogenesis in glioma. IkappaBalphaM inhibited in vitro and in vivo expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 8 (IL-8). Human glioma xenografts treated with IkappaBalphaM gene transfer exhibited significantly decreased angiogenesis both in an orthotopic and in an ectopic model. The decreased expression of VEGF and IL-8 directly correlated with decreased tumorigenicity, and tumor vascularization.

In the present study, we examined the expression of tumstatin in relationship with tumor vascularization in 34 bronchopulmonary human carcinomas. We observed a clear association between tumstatin expression and tumor vascularization. Indeed, a strong expression of tumstatin in the tumor environment correlated with a mildly developed vascular network. In contrast, tumstatin was absent or poorly detected in highly vascularized tumors. Moreover, alphavbeta3 integrin and tumstatin colocalized in capillary endothelial cells, suggesting a potential interaction between these 2 molecules.

{"title": "Progesterone supplement in pregnancy: an immunologic therapy?", "abstract": "One of the most interesting functions of the placenta is the regulation of the maternal immune response such that the fetal semi-allograft is tolerated during pregnancy. Trophoblasts are presumed to be essential to this phenomenon because they lie at the maternal-fetal interface, where they are in direct contact with cells of the maternal immune system. Trophoblasts do not express classic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Surprisingly, cytotrophoblasts express more HLA-G, a MHC class Ib molecule, as they invade the uterus. Progesterone plays an important role in postovulatory regulation of the menstrual cycle. If fertilization occurs, progesterone supports implantation of the ovum and maintains the pregnancy. Progesterone has been named the 'hormone of pregnancy', because in preparing the endometrium for embryo implantation and facilitating endometrial development, it is critical to the very survival of a pregnancy. In addition, this key hormone inhibits the rejection of T cell-mediated tissue and also decreases myometrial activity and sensitivity throughout pregnancy. The cellular actions of progesterone are mediated through intracellular progesterone receptors (PRs), which are well studied gene regulators, not express classic major histocompatibility complex. The more used paradigm is relative to the alteration of relationship TH1/TH2, but the complexity of the respective distributions of cytokines at the materno-fetal interface, strongly suggest that, as useful as it certainly was for a while, the Th1/Th2 paradigm must now be considered as an oversimplification. Rather, the existing data point to sequential windows and are suggestive of a system where an extreme complexity is allied to very precise timing and tuning. They also suggest that the materno-fetal relationship is not simply maternal tolerance of a foreign tissue, but a series of intricate mutual cytokine interactions governing selective immune regulation and also control of the adhesion and vascularization processes during this dialogue.

The pathological and immunohistochemical findings of an autopsy case of hemorrhagic moyamoya disease in a 69-year-old woman are described in the present report. The autopsy findings of the brain revealed cerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage with edema. The left anterior cerebral artery, bilateral middle cerebral arteries and left posterior cerebral artery were marked narrowing, and the other arteries revealed mild narrowing. Microscopically, the arteries of the circle of Willis showed narrowed lumen, fibrocellular intimal thickening, marked tortuousness of internal elastic lamina and attenuation of media. The thickened intima was composed of smooth muscle cells. The vessels with dilated or irregular-shaped lumen suggested abnormal vascular networks demonstrated by angiography. In this case, no correlation between the abnormal vascular network and expression of VEGF or VEGF receptor was disclosed. It was hypothesized that abnormal vascular networks might be composed of collateral vessels in relation to various pathological changes of the arteries, such as occlusion and stenosis, and intracranial hemorrhage in patients with moyamoya disease might occur as a result of rupture of arteries including abnormal vascular networks.", "journal": "Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology", "date": "2004-10-16", "authors": ["YoshinoriTakekawa", "TakehikoUmezawa", "YuichiUeno", "TatsuoSawada", "MakioKobayashi"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1440-1789.2004.00550.x"}
{"title": "Neointimal vascularization and intimal thickening in response to self-expanding stents: a swine model.", "abstract": "Neovascularization has been suggested as a biological response to vessel injury and associated with restenosis. Self-expanding (SE) stents generate a lasting force on the arterial wall and may lead to an increased arterial response with time.\nTo characterize the process of neovascularization with SE stents, and to correlate it with vascular injury, inflammation and intimal proliferation.\nSixty-nine SE stents were im-planted in 37 non-atherosclerotic pigs.Detailed, multisection histological examination was performed at 15 days, 1, 3 and 6 months post-deployment. Neo-vascularization in addition to other histologic parameters where determined and scored.\nIntravascular-ultrasound-based average vessel diameter was 3.3 +/- 0.04 mm; stent size was 3.75 +/- 0.35 mm leading to an oversizing ratio of 1.14 +/- 0.15. Intimal thickness (IT), inflammatory score (IFS) and vascularization score(VAS) reached peak values at three months (IT = 344 +/- 202 1m, IFS = 0.91 +/- 0.5, and VAS = 1.56 +/- 0.8). In contrast,the injury score (INS) continued to increase at all time-points, with maximum value at six months (INS = 1.6 +/- 0.7). Both vascularization and inflammation indices increased with an increase in the injury score (p < 0.01). When vessels were divided according to vascularization score (VAS <1.5 and >1.5) there was a significant difference in IT.\nNeovascularization in response to SE stents is a time-dependent phenomenon and interacts with injury and inflammation. The remodeling of the vessel wall caused by the sustained force of the SE stent on the arterial wall enhances the formation of neovascularization.

{"title": "VEGF is required for the maintenance of dorsal root ganglia blood vessels but not neurons during development.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent regulator of vascular function through its control of multiple endothelial cell functions. In addition to its key role in vascularization, VEGF has recently been shown to have neurotrophic activity during hypoxic stress. In the central and peripheral motor nervous system, VEGF treatment increased neuronal vascularization and perfusion, as well as having direct trophic effects on neurons and Schwann cells. However, the role of VEGF in the sensory nervous system remains unclear. To characterize the differential effects of VEGF on endothelial cells and neurons in sensory ganglia, we used explanted mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a culture system containing neurons and endothelial cells in close apposition. We show that VEGF is expressed by neurons and satellite cells, but not by endothelial cells or pericytes. On the other hand, the tyrosine kinase VEGF receptor VEGFR-2 was robustly expressed by endothelial cells throughout the extensive DRG capillary network, but not found at either the transcript or protein level in sensory neurons or other nonendothelial cells of the DRG. Both soluble receptor sequestration of VEGF and small molecule kinase inhibition of VEGFR-2 signaling rapidly disrupted the connectivity, branching, and structural integrity of the capillary network of embryonic DRG; this effect was no longer evident postnatally. However, VEGF inhibition showed no detectable effect on neuronal health at any stage analyzed.

The effects of these two agents on EGFR signaling, proliferation, apoptosis, and vascularization were evaluated. In addition, we analyzed, with cDNA arrays, changes in gene expression profiles induced by both agents.\nThe combined treatment with gefitinib and cetuximab resulted in a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and in superior inhibition of EGFR-dependent signaling and induction of apoptosis. In a series of in vivo experiments, single-agent gefitinib or cetuximab resulted in transient complete tumor remission only at the highest doses.

However, local accumulation of infused EPCs in these sites is poor, and the mechanisms responsible for their homing are largely unknown. We observed the expression of L-selectin, an adhesion receptor that regulates lymphocyte homing and leukocyte rolling and migration, on ex vivo expanded blood-derived human EPCs. When EPCs were subcloned in SV40-T large Ag-transfected isolates, the copresence of L-selectin and endothelial lineage markers was confirmed. We therefore demonstrated that the expression of L-selectin by EPCs was functional because it mediates interaction with a murine endothelial cell line (H.end) expressing L-selectin ligands by way of transfection with alpha(1,3/4)-fucosyltransferase. Indeed, adhesion of EPCs after incubation at 4 degrees C on a rotating platform was enhanced on alpha(1,3/4)-fucosyltransferase-transfected H.end cells compared with control vector-transfected cells, and treatment with anti-L-selectin Abs prevented this event. We then studied the role of L-selectin in EPC homing in vivo. H.end cells were implanted s.c. in SCID mice to form endothelioma tumors, and EPCs were subsequently i.v. injected. L-selectin+ EPCs localized into alpha(1,3/4)-fucosyltransferase-transfected endothelial tumors to a greater extent than in control tumors, and they were able to directly contribute to tumor vascularization by forming L-selectin+ EPC-containing vessels.

Recent evidence suggests that tumor cells can express some genes typically expressed by endothelial cells and form extracellular matrix-rich tubular networks, phenomena known as vasculogenic mimicry. We examined the effects of three angiogenesis inhibitors (i.e., anginex, TNP-470, and endostatin) on vasculogenic mimicry in human melanoma MUM-2B and C8161 cells and compared them with their effects in human endothelial HMEC-1 and HUVEC cells. Anginex, TNP-470, and endostatin markedly inhibited vascular cord and tube formation by HMEC-1 and HUVEC cells in vitro, whereas tubular network formation by MUM-2B and C8161 cells was relatively unaffected. Endothelial cells expressed higher mRNA and protein levels for two putative endostatin receptors, alpha5 integrin and heparin sulfate proteoglycan 2, than melanoma cells, suggesting a mechanistic basis for the differential response of the two cell types to angiogenesis inhibitors.

Studies in animals have suggested that PDGFR-beta inhibition reduces tumor interstitial fluid pressure, and thus increases the uptake of concomitantly administered drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in tumor vascular parameters could be detected in humans, and to assess whether CDP860 would be likely to increase the uptake of a concurrently administered small molecule in future studies.\nPatients with advanced ovarian or colorectal cancer and good performance status received intravenous infusions of CDP860 on days 0 and 28. Patients had serial dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging studies to measure changes in tumor vascular parameters.\nThree of eight patients developed significant ascites, and seven of eight showed evidence of fluid retention. In some patients, the ratio of vascular volume to total tumor volume increased significantly (P < .001) within 24 hours following CDP860 administration, an effect suggestive of recruitment of previously non-functioning vessels.\nThese observations suggest that inhibition of PDGFR-beta might improve delivery of a concurrently administered therapy. However, in cancer patients, further exploration of the dosing regimen of CDP860 is required to dissociate adverse effects from beneficial effects. The findings challenge the view that inhibition of PDGF alone is beneficial, and confirm that effects of PDGFR kinase inhibition mediate, to some extent, the fluid retention observed in patients treated with mixed tyrosine kinase inhibitors.", "journal": "Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology", "date": "2004-10-07", "authors": ["G CJayson", "G J MParker", "SMullamitha", "J WValle", "MSaunders", "LBroughton", "JLawrance", "BCarrington", "CRoberts", "BIssa", "D LBuckley", "SCheung", "KDavies", "YWatson", "KZinkewich-P\u00e9otti", "LRolfe", "AJackson"], "doi": "10.1200/JCO.2005.01.032"}

In vitro, CA-4-P destabilizes microtubules and causes endothelial cell death. In this study we analyze the mechanisms by which CA-4-P induces the death of proliferating endothelial cells. We demonstrate that at >/=7.5 nmol/L, CA-4-P damages mitotic spindles, arrests cells at metaphase, and leads to the death of mitotic cells with characteristic G(2)/M DNA content. Mitotic arrest was associated with elevated levels of cyclin B1 protein and p34(cdc2) activity. Inhibition of p34(cdc2) activity by purvalanol A caused mitotic-arrested cells to rapidly exit mitosis, suggesting that sustained p34(cdc2) activity was responsible for metaphase arrest. Pharmacological prevention of entry into mitosis protected cells from undergoing cell death, further establishing the link between mitosis and cell death induction by CA-4-P. CA-4-P-mediated cell death shared characteristics of apoptosis but was independent of caspase activation suggesting the involvement of a non-caspase pathway(s). These data suggest that induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells by CA-4-P is associated with prolonged mitotic arrest. Therefore, by activating cell death pathways, CA-4-P, in addition to being an effective anti-vascular agent, may also interfere with regrowth of blood vessels in the tumor.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2004-10-07", "authors": ["ChrysoKanthou", "OlgaGreco", "AnnaStratford", "IanCook", "RichardKnight", "OmarBenzakour", "GillianTozer"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63398-6"}

The effect of hypoxia on the very first stages of vascular development is, however, less well characterized. Here we show that hypoxic conditions (1% O2) potently stimulated formation of an extensive vascular network during a discrete stage of mouse embryonal stem cell differentiation. The morphological changes correlated with an expanding pool of endothelial cells and with activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor-d (Vegf-d) and Vegf receptor-3 genes. VEGF receptor-3 expression was confined to vascular endothelial cells and analysis of the lymphatic marker Prox-1 revealed no expansion of lymphatic endothelial cells. Administration of neutralizing antibodies against either VEGF receptor-3 or VEGF receptor-2 impaired vascular network formation, whereas neutralizing antibodies against VEGF receptor-1 potentiated development of immature vascular structures. In addition, sequestering of VEGF receptor-3 ligands reduced vascularization in a manner similar to neutralization of VEGF receptor-3.

{"title": "Oncogenic action of secreted phospholipase A2 in prostate cancer.", "abstract": "Mortality from prostate cancer is associated with progression of tumors to androgen-independent growth and metastasis. Eicosanoid products of both the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways are important mediators of the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in culture and regulate tumor vascularization and metastasis in animal models. Pharmacologic agents that block either COX or LOX products effectively reduce the size of prostate cancer xenografts. Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes regulate the provision of arachidonic acid to both COX- and LOX-derived eicosanoids, and a secreted form of the enzyme (sPLA(2)-IIA) is elevated in prostate cancer tissues. Here, we show by immunohistochemistry, in patients receiving androgen ablation therapy, that sPLA(2)-IIA remains elevated in remaining cancer cells relative to benign glands after treatment. Furthermore, sPLA(2)-IIA expression seen in benign glands is substantially decreased after androgen depletion, whereas cytosolic PLA(2)-alpha (cPLA(2)-alpha) levels are unchanged. sPLA(2)-IIA mRNA expression is detectable and inducible by androgen (0.01-10 nmol/L) in the androgen-sensitive cell line LNCaP, and exogenous addition of sPLA(2)-IIA (1-100 nmol/L), but not an inactive sPLA(2)-IIA mutant (H(48)Q), results in a dose-dependent increase in cell numbers or the fraction of cells in G(2)-M phase, which is inhibited by sPLA(2)-IIA-selective inhibitors. The effect of exogenous sPLA(2)-IIA can also be blocked by inhibition of cPLA(2)-alpha, suggesting a role for cPLA(2)-alpha in mediating sPLA(2)-IIAlpha action. sPLA(2)-IIA inhibitors suppressed basal proliferation in LNCaP cells and in the androgen-independent, sPLA(2)-positive cell line PC3 but not in the sPLA(2)-IIA-negative androgen-independent cell line DU145. Established PC3 xenograft tumors grew more slowly in mice treated with sPLA(2)-IIA inhibitors than those treated with saline only.

The CAM is a highly vascularized extraembryonic membrane that functions as a site for respiration, nutrient transport, and waste storage during embryonic development. After hatching, the CAM is usually discarded with the eggshell and can be used for chemical residue analysis. Chorioallantoic membranes have been used successfully to examine contaminant exposure and predict chemical concentrations in multiple species of birds and reptiles. In this study, we examined organochlorine (OC) pesticide concentrations in CAMs from eggs of Morelet's crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii) from northern Belize. Multiple OCs were detected in crocodile CAMs, including aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), heptachlor, lindane, and methoxychlor. Number and concentrations of OC compounds in CAMs were variable. The most prevalent contaminant detected was DDE, which occurred in 69% of CAMs, with concentrations ranging from 0.3 parts per billion (ppb) to 17.0 ppb. The OC burdens in crocodile CAMs confirm contamination of eggs and suggest exposure in embryos and maternal females. These results further support the use of CAMs as qualitative indicators of OC exposure in oviparous wildlife.

{"title": "Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD)", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor, is a homodimeric glycoprotein weighing ~45 kDa (1). The VEGF family consists of six groups: VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and the placental growth factor (PIGF) (2). Structurally, VEGFs are related to the platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), and they all contain the characteristic eight-cysteine residues known as the cysteine knot motif (3). Intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds are formed between these cysteine residues in conserved positions (2). VEGFs bind specifically to three cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinases, including fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) or VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) or VEGRF-2, and Flt-4 or VEGFR-3. Each VEGFR contains a 750-amino acid-residue extracellular domain that is organized into seven immunoglobulin-like folds. VEGF and VEGFRs have been implicated in angiogenesis in many solid tumors, including breast cancer, colon cancer, hepatoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer (3). VEGFR-2 (~220 kDa) is expressed exclusively in endothelial cells in cell differentiation, tumor vascularization, and metastasis. VEGF-A (the original VEGF) binds to the second and third extracellular immunoglobulin G loop of VEGFR-2 with a dissociation constant of ~100 pM (4). Hypoxia appears to be an important stimulus for producing VEGF in malignant and normal endothelial cells (3). Upon binding to its receptor VEGFR-2, VEGF-A elicits a pronounced angiogenic response, so it is considered as a predominant stimulator of angiogenesis.

{"title": "[The role of nutritional factors on the structure and function of the brain: an update on dietary requirements].", "abstract": "The brain is an organ elaborated and functioning from substances present in the diet. Dietary regulation of blood glucose level (via ingestion of food with a low glycemic index ensuring a low insulin level) improves the quality and duration of intellectual performance, if only because at rest the adult brain consumes 50 p. 100 of dietary carbohydrates, 80 p. 100 of them for energy purposes. The nature of the amino acid composition of dietary proteins contributes to good cerebral function; tryptophan plays a special role. Many indispensable amino acids present in dietary proteins help to elaborate neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Omega-3 fatty acids provided the first coherent experimental demonstration of the effect of dietary nutrients on the structure and function of the brain. First it was shown that the differentiation and functioning of cultured brain cells requires omega-3 fatty acids. It was then demonstrated that alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) deficiency alters the course of brain development, perturbs the composition and physicochemical properties of brain cell membranes, neurones, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes (ALA). This leads to physicochemical modifications, induces biochemical and physiological perturbations, and results in neurosensory and behavioral upset. Consequently, the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega-3) present in formula milks for infants (premature and term) conditions the visual and cerebral abilities, including intellectual abilities. Moreover, dietary omega-3 fatty acids are certainly involved in the prevention of some aspects of cardiovascular disease (including at the level of cerebral vascularization), and in some neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, as well as in dementia, notably Alzheimer's disease. Their deficiency can prevent the satisfactory renewal of membranes and thus accelerate cerebral aging. Iron is necessary to ensure oxygenation, to produce energy in the cerebral parenchyma, and for the synthesis of neurotransmitters. The iodine provided by the thyroid hormone ensures the energy metabolism of the cerebral cells. The absence of iodine during pregnancy induces severe cerebral dysfunction, leading to cretinism. Manganese, copper, and zinc participate in enzymatic mechanisms that protect against free radicals, toxic derivatives of oxygen. The use of glucose by nervous tissue implies the presence of vitamin B1. Vitamin B9 preserves memory during aging, and with vitamin B12 delays the onset of signs of dementia, provided it is administered in a precise clinical window, at the onset of the first symptoms.

Pathognomonic changes in the architectonics of the heart included reduction of regional blood flow and segmentary, discontinuously extended, and diffusely extended atherosclerotic obstruction. Changes in the index of blood supply to the myocardium corresponded to pronounced decrease in vascularization of the hypertrophic left ventricle. A correlation was found between the index of blood supply to the myocardium and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

{"title": "Effect of nutrient intake during pregnancy on fetal and placental growth and vascular development.", "abstract": "Remarkable diversity of size and health of offspring exists after normal pregnancies. When pregnancies are complicated by an extrinsic variable such as inappropriate maternal nutrition, birth weight and health of the neonate are substantially affected. The placenta is the organ through which respiratory gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged between the maternal and fetal systems. Thus, transplacental exchange provides for all the metabolic demands of fetal growth. Transplacental exchange is dependent upon uterine and umbilical blood flow, and blood flow rates are in turn dependent in large part upon vascularization of the placenta. Therefore, factors that influence placental vascular development will have a dramatic impact on fetal growth and development, and thereby on neonatal mortality and morbidity. Recent work from our laboratories has focused on the effects of nutrient intake during pregnancy on placental growth and vascular development. Both nutrient restriction of the adult dam and overnourishment of the adolescent dam during pregnancy suppress placental cell proliferation and vascularity. Furthermore, placental expression of angiogenic factors and their receptors, factors that are known to affect vascular growth, are perturbed by level of nutrition. Studies in this area will lead to improved methods to manage nutritionally-compromised pregnancies.", "journal": "Domestic animal endocrinology", "date": "2004-09-29", "authors": ["D ARedmer", "J MWallace", "L PReynolds"], "doi": "10.1016/j.domaniend.2004.06.006"}

After a 7 cm long midline laparotomy, a spindle-shaped 4 cm (maximum width) by 7 cm (length) fragment of PL-PU99 was sutured to the edges of the peritoneal, muscular, and fascial abdominal tissues, so that the biomaterial remained in contact with the exterior. The PL-PU99 composite is composed of a polypropylene mesh adhered to a sheet of polyurethane with an acrylic cement. At 7 and 14 days after implant, animals were sacrificed and specimens taken for morphological, ultrastructural, morphometry of the neoperitoneum, and immunohistochemical (macrophage reaction, RAM-11) analysis.\nNo death or signs of infection or rejection of the prostheses were recorded. No adhesions could be macroscopically observed between the composite and the intestinal loops. The biomaterial achieved a good seal, no leakage of fluids being detected. Fourteen days after implant, the neoperitoneum formed on the prosthesis was of an even structure and was made up of organized, vascularized connective tissue covered by an uninterrupted mesothelium.\nThe PL-PU99 prosthesis shows optimal behavior at the prosthesis/visceral peritoneum interface, making it ideal for its use in the temporary closure of the abdomen.

Experimental investigations indicate angiogenesis as a major regulator of bone metastasis development. Vascularization and angiogenic potential is known for most of the primary tumor types, but no studies investigated angiogenesis in bone metastases of human cancers. We have evaluated microvessel density of bone metastases of various cancer types (all adenocarcinomas) and compared to their primary tumors in paraffin samples of 39 patients. Microvessel density was determined by using the hot spot method and the blood vessel marker, CD34. The most vascularized adenocarcinoma was found to be renal cell cancer followed by lung adenocarcinoma, while breast cancer was heterogenous in this respect. Two patterns of modulation of the angiogenic phenotype in the bone metastases emerged in this study, which seemed to be cancer type specific: decreased angiogenic potential characterizing 45% of renal cell cancers and breast cancers of high vascularity in their primary, and increased angiogenic potential characterizing 40% of lung adenocarcinomas and breast cancers of low vascularity in their primary lesion. Our data demonstrate that i., the vascularization of bone metastases is frequently altered compared to the primary tumors, ii., patterns are different in the case of various cancer types.

{"title": "Component surgery of the cornea.", "abstract": "Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) has long been the standard procedure for treating irreversible opacification of the cornea from various diseases. The success rate of PKP is high compared with those in other organ transplants because of the low incidence of immunologic rejection. However, once rejection does occur, secondary procedures are inevitably less successful. Cases with vascularized corneas are also prone to undergo rejection, and severe disease causing total destruction of limbal tissue is considered a contraindication for surgery. Recent advances in corneal surgery aim at reducing surgical trauma to the host cornea by replacing only necessary cells and tissue. This approach not only reduces the risk of immunologic rejection but may also yield better refractive results. The various transplantable \"components\" of the cornea include the epithelium, epithelial stem cells, stroma, and endothelium. Cells from these components can be transplanted as lamellar sections of donor cornea or as sheets using biologic carriers and scaffolds. Procedures such as epithelial sheet transplants using amniotic membrane carriers, deep lamellar keratoplasty, and endothelial lamellar keratoplasty are already in clinical practice.

{"title": "Systematic analysis of hematopoietic, vasculogenetic, and angiogenetic phases in the developing embryonic avian lung, Gallus gallus variant domesticus.", "abstract": "In the embryonic lung of the domestic fowl, Gallus gallus variant domesticus, hematogenetic and vasculogenetic cells become ultrastructurally clear from day 4 of development. In the former group of cells, filopodial extensions coalesce, cytoplasm thickens, and accumulating hemoglobin displaces the nucleus peripherally while in the latter, conspicuous filopodial extensions and large nuclei develop as the cells assume a rather stellate appearance. From day 5, erythrocytes and granular leukocytes begin forming from cytoarchitecturally cognate hematogenetic cells. The cells become distinguishable when hemoglobin starts to accumulate in the erythroblasts and electron dense bodies form in the leukoblasts. Vasculogenesis begins from day 7 in different areas of the developing lung: erthrocytes (but not granular leukocytes) appear to attract committed vasculogenetic cells (angioblasts) that form an endothelial lining and vessel wall. Arrangement of angioblasts around forming blood vessels sets the direction along which the vessels sprout (angiogenesis). In some areas of the developing lung, through what seems like an inductive erythropoietic process, arcades of erythrocytes organize. Once endothelial cells surround such continuities, discrete vascular units organize. By day 10, the major parts of the in-built (intrinsic) pulmonary vasculature are assembled. Complete pulmonary circulation (i.e., through the exchange tissue) is not established until after day 18 when the blood capillaries start to develop. Since the precursory erythrocytes do not have a respiratory role, it is imperative that de novo erythropoiesis is essential for vasculogenesis. Diffuse (fragmentary) development and subsequent piecemeal assembly of the pulmonary vascular system may explicate the fabrication of a complex circulatory architecture that grants cross-current, counter-current, and multicapillary serial arterialization designs in the exchange tissue of the avian lung. The exceptional respiratory efficiency of the avian lung is largely attributable to the geometries (physical interfacing) between the bronchial and vascular elements at different levels of morphological organization.", "journal": "Tissue & cell", "date": "2004-09-24", "authors": ["J NMaina"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tice.2004.05.002"}

The eventual aesthetic outcome was satisfactory after a secondary surgery for nasal tip correction using conchal cartilage graft for tip framework. The procedure has allowed placement of the bone graft in an unscarred bed, with a complete inset of the vascularized full-thickness soft tissue cover. This provided the graft with the ideal vascular milieu for survival and consolidation and achieved an aesthetically acceptable soft tissue reconstruction of the nose with minimal donor-site morbidity.

Theoretically, this minimally invasive therapy should replace WOP because its risks and expense should be less. To date, however, no systematic comparisons of these 2 options have been reported.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of WOP and IIT performed at the University of Pennsylvania between September 2001 and February 2004. We compared a variety of parameters, including patient and graft survival, degree and duration of glucose homeostasis, procedural and immunosuppressive complications, and resources utilization.\nBoth WOP and IIT proved highly successful at establishing insulin independence in type I diabetic patients. Whole-organ pancreas recipients experienced longer lengths of stay, more readmissions, and more complications, but they exhibited a more durable state of normoglycemia with greater insulin reserves. Achieving insulin independence by IIT proved surprisingly more expensive, despite shorter initial hospital and readmission stays.\nDespite recent improvement in the success of IIT, WOP provides a more reliable and durable restoration of normoglycemia. Although IIT was associated with less procedure-related morbidity and shorter hospital stays, we unexpectedly found IIT to be more costly than WOP. This was largely due to IIT requiring islets from multiple donors to gain insulin independence. Because donor pancreata that are unsuitable for WOP can often be used successfully for IIT, we suggest that as IIT evolves, it should continue to be evaluated as a complementary alternative to rather than as a replacement for the better-established method of WOP.", "journal": "Annals of surgery", "date": "2004-09-24", "authors": ["AdamFrank", "ShaopingDeng", "XiaolunHuang", "ErgunVelidedeoglu", "Yong-SukBae", "ChengyangLiu", "PeterAbt", "RobertStephenson", "MuhammadMohiuddin", "ThavThambipillai", "EileenMarkmann", "MaralPalanjian", "MartySellers", "AliNaji", "Clyde FBarker", "James FMarkmann"], "doi": "10.1097/01.sla.0000140754.26575.2a"}

Here we describe a novel technique of heart retransplantation in the mouse. In this technique, a primarily vascularized heart graft is anastomosed to the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava of a syngeneic or immunodeficient allogeneic mouse, using standard techniques. Either 10 or 70 days later, the same graft is retransplanted into the abdomen of a second mouse by end-to-side anastomosis of the donor (first recipient) aortic and inferior vena cava's cuffs to the second recipient's abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. A greater than 90% success rate was achieved by using this microsurgical technique.

Between 1993-2000, 12 patients with segmental bone defects following forearm trauma were managed with vascularized fibular grafts: 6 males and 6 females, aged 39 years on average (range, 16-65 years). The reconstructed site was the radius in 8 patients and the ulna in 4. The length of bone defect ranged from 6-13 cm. In 4 cases, the fibular graft was harvested and used as a vascularized fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap. To achieve fixation of the grafted fibula, plates were used in 10 cases, and screws and Kirschner wires in 2. In the latter 2 cases, an external skeletal fixator was applied to ensure immobilization of the extremity. The follow-up period ranged from 10-93 months. Eleven grafts were successful. The mean period to obtain radiographic bone union was 4.8 months (range, 2.5-8 months). Fibular grafts allow the use of a segment of diaphyseal bone which is structurally similar to the radius and ulna and of sufficient length to reconstruct most skeletal defects of the forearm.

{"title": "Preoperative transarterial embolization of vertebral metastases.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative devascularization of spinal metastases in relation to the preembolization tumor vascularization degree and in relation to the intraoperative blood loss. Twenty-four patients underwent preoperative transarterial embolization of hypervascular spinal metastases. Each tumor was assigned a vascularization grade (I-III) according to tumor blush after contrast agent injection in the main feeding artery. Embolization was performed with polyvinyl alcohol particles in all patients. Surgical reports were reviewed in terms of estimated blood loss. A mild hypervascularization was found in three patients (group I), medium in six patients (group II) and extensive in 15 patients (group III). In 22 out of 24 patients embolization could be performed with a complete devascularization. In two patients, only partial embolization could be performed, due to the main feeding artery arising from the artery of Adamkiewicz. In patients with complete devascularization the mean intraoperative blood loss was 1,900 ml, whereas in the two patients who were not embolized it was 5,500 ml. Intraoperative blood loss was not correlated to the vascularization grade. Angiography and embolization could be performed in all patients without causing permanent neurologic deficit, skin or muscle necrosis. The surgeons concluded that radical tumor resection after embolization was facilitated. Intraoperative blood loss is not correlated with the pre-interventional vascularization degree, if complete devascularization can be achieved with embolization. Preoperative embolization of vertebral hypervascular tumors is safe, effective and facilitates tumor resection.", "journal": "European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society", "date": "2004-09-21", "authors": ["RaphaelGuzman", "SusanDubach-Schwizer", "PaulHeini", "Karl-OlofLovblad", "DanielKalbermatten", "GerhardSchroth", "LucaRemonda"], "doi": "10.1007/s00586-004-0757-6\n10.1007/s002709900165"}

Of the 54 cases, 42 were unilateral, showing a left predominance (25 cases), three of them with triple renal arteries on the opposite side. In six cases we encountered bilateral double renal arteries. Most often, the supplementary renal artery originated from the lateral side of the aorta (58%). Examination of the renal approach showed that in 28 cases the supplementary renal artery entered the kidney through the hilum (proper supplementary renal artery), in 16 cases it was inferior polar, in five cases it was superior polar and in five cases the supplementary renal artery terminated in two branches, equal in caliber, one polar and the other hilar, thus showing a combined character, identical with the manner of termination of the main renal artery. In most of the samples the supplementary renal artery ended with a bifurcation inside the kidney, either into the renal sinus (proper supplementary renal artery) or inside the renal parenchyma (polar supplementary renal artery). The course of the double renal arteries showed multiple variations: retroureteral passage of the supplementary renal artery (6 cases), right supplementary renal artery passing anterior to the inferior vena cava (5 cases), crossed course of the double renal arteries (5 cases). Double renal arteries may coexist with other uro-vascular variations, such as: double renal veins on the same side (4 cases) or on the opposite side (3 cases), double ureter on the same side (2 cases) or on the opposite side (1 case), persistence of the fetal renal lobulation on the adult kidney (3 cases) and genital artery originating from the supplementary renal artery (3 cases).", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2004-09-21", "authors": ["PBordei", "ESapte", "DIliescu"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-004-0272-9"}

While many of the reported in vitro actions have not been examined in the context of organ development in vivo, recent studies demonstrate that mice which lack or overexpress natriuretic peptides or receptors exhibit pronounced skeletal growth defects. This article discusses how natriuretic peptides and other factors appear to regulate bone growth as an example of how natriuretic peptides might participate in the ontogeny of other organ systems. Evidence indicating that natriuretic peptides regulate neural development is then reviewed. Natriuretic peptides and receptors exhibit complex expression patterns in the developing nervous system, where they have been shown to act on neural cells as early as at the embryonic neural tube stage. Interestingly, both bone and brain growth appear to utilize primarily CNP and the CNP-specific type B receptor, and perhaps the type C receptor. In vitro data indicate that CNP may act on developing neurons, astrocytes and Schwann cells like a classical growth factor, regulating proliferation, patterning, phenotypic specification, survival and axonal pathfinding. Natriuretic peptides might also have roles in the vascularization of the embryonic brain, establishment of the blood-brain and blood-nerve barriers, and perhaps in nerve regeneration.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS", "date": "2004-09-21", "authors": ["J AWaschek"], "doi": "10.1007/s00018-004-4159-z"}
{"title": "Distal angiogenesis: a new concept for lung vascular morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Although several molecular players have been described that play a role during the early phases of lung development, it is still unknown how the vasculature develops in relation to the airways. Two opposing models describe development of lung vasculature: one suggests that both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are involved, whereas the second describes vasculogenesis as the primary mechanism. Therefore, we examined the development of the murine pulmonary vasculature through a morphological analysis from the onset of lung development [9.5 days postcoital (dpc)] until the pseudoglandular stage (13.5 dpc). We analyzed fetal lungs of Tie2-LacZ transgenic mice as well as serial sections of wild-type lungs stained with endothelial-specific antibodies (Flk-1, Fli-1, and PECAM-1). Embryos were processed with intact blood circulation to maintain the integrity of the vasculature; hence individual vessels could be identified with accuracy through serial section analysis. Furthermore, circulating primitive erythrocytes, formed exclusively by the blood islands in the yolk sac, are trapped in vessels during fixation, which proves the connection with the embryonic circulation. We report that from the first morphological sign of lung development, a clear vascular network exists that is in contact with the embryonic circulation. We propose distal angiogenesis as a new concept for early pulmonary vascular morphogenesis. In this model, capillary networks surround the terminal buds and expand by formation of new capillaries from preexisting vessels as the lung bud grows. The fact that at an early embryonic stage a complete vascular network exists may be important for the general understanding of embryonic development.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Neuropilin-1 is required for endothelial tip cell guidance in the developing central nervous system.", "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that sprouting angiogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) is a guided process similar to the guidance of axons and insect tracheal tubes. Specialized tip cells of vessel sprouts navigate in response to local depots or gradients of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) is a transmembrane receptor with a repulsive function in axon guidance. Nrp-1 also binds the VEGF-A splice isoform VEGF165, stimulates angiogenesis, and is necessary for vascular development in the mouse. However, the morphogenetic events controlled by Nrp-1 in angiogenesis have not been defined. Here, we analyzed endothelial tip cell guidance in the CNS of Nrp-1-deficient mice. We focused our attention on the developing hindbrain, which is normally vascularized in a stereotyped manner. Initially, angiogenic sprouts extend along radial glia from the pial surface toward the ventricles, but in the subventricular zone (SVZ), they leave the radial path, turn laterally, and fuse to form a capillary plexus. Radial sprout elongation correlated with tip cell filopodia extensions along nestin-positive radial glial processes, but in the SVZ, the tip cell filopodia also extended perpendicular to the glial tracks and made contact with filopodia of the neighboring sprouts. In Nrp-1-deficient mice, the tip cell filopodia remained associated with the radial glia in the SVZ, which correlated with a failure of sprout turning and elongation across this region. As a result, the sprouts remained blind-ended forming glomeruloid tufts in the SVZ. These observations suggest that Nrp-1 plays an important role in allowing the endothelial tip cell filopodia to switch substrate and protrude in a new direction at a specific location in the developing brain.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2004-09-18", "authors": ["HolgerGerhardt", "ChristianaRuhrberg", "AlexandraAbramsson", "HajimeFujisawa", "DavidShima", "ChristerBetsholtz"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.20148"}

The basic event in IA is the formation of transvascular tissue pillars. Depending on location, timing, and frequency of pillar emergence, the IA process has different outcomes. In capillaries, a primary IA function is to expand the capillary bed in size and complexity (intussusceptive microvascular growth). It represents an alternative to capillary sprouting. Highly ordered pillar formation in a developing capillary network leads to the formation of vascular trees (intussusceptive arborization). In small arteries and veins, pillar formation at the vessels' branching angles leads either to remodeling of the branching geometry or even to vascular pruning (intussusceptive branching remodeling). It appears essential that future angiogenic research considers always both phenomena, sprouting and intussusception. Vascularization of tissues, organs, and tumors rely heavily on both mechanisms; neglecting one or the other would obscure our understanding of the angiogenesis process.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2004-09-18", "authors": ["Peter HBurri", "RuslanHlushchuk", "ValentinDjonov"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.20184"}

To dissect the mechanisms through which JNK signaling contributes to the transformation process we employed a recently generated constitutively active version of this kinase, SAPKbeta-MKK7, which behaves like a weakly transforming oncogene in vitro.

{"title": "Infection, fever, and exogenous and endogenous pyrogens: some concepts have changed.", "abstract": "For many years, it was thought that bacterial products caused fever via the intermediate production of a host-derived, fever-producing molecule, called endogenous pyrogen (EP). Bacterial products and other fever-producing substances were termed exogenous pyrogens. It was considered highly unlikely that exogenous pyrogens caused fever by acting directly on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center since there were countless fever-producing microbial products, mostly large molecules, with no common physical structure. In vivo and in vitro, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and other microbial products induced EP, subsequently shown to be interleukin-1 (IL-1). The concept of the 'endogenous pyrogen' cause of fever gained considerable support when pure, recombinant IL-1 produced fever in humans and in animals at subnanomolar concentrations. Subsequently, recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and other cytokines were also shown to cause fever and EPs are now termed pyrogenic cytokines. However, the concept was challenged when specific blockade of either IL-1 or TNF activity did not diminish the febrile response to LPS, to other microbial products or to natural infections in animals and in humans. During infection, fever could occur independently of IL-1 or TNF activity. The cytokine-like property of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal transduction provides an explanation by which any microbial product can cause fever by engaging its specific TLR on the vascular network supplying the thermoregulatory center in the anterior hypothalamus. Since fever induced by IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6 or TLR ligands requires cyclooxygenase-2, production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and activation of hypothalamic PGE2 receptors provides a unifying mechanism for fever by endogenous and exogenous pyrogens. Thus, fever is the result of either cytokine receptor or TLR triggering; in autoimmune diseases, fever is mostly cytokine mediated whereas both cytokine and TLR account for fever during infection.", "journal": "Journal of endotoxin research", "date": "2004-09-18", "authors": ["Charles ADinarello"], "doi": "10.1179/096805104225006129"}

In all cases, regardless of CDS findings, HRUS succeeded in detecting the twist as a snail shell-shaped mass measuring 11 to 33 mm.\nThe finding of a twisted spermatic cord is a highly reliable sign for the diagnosis of testicular torsion. Whereas normal intratesticular perfusion does not dispense with emergency exploratory surgery, direct and complete visualization of a nontwisted spermatic cord strongly indicates that surgery is unnecessary.

The incidental prostatic carcinomas of the decade 1990-99 diagnosed at our department were reexamined.

Tumour vascularization (angiogenesis) and epithelial texture were investigated by quantitative stereology. Learning vector quantization (LVQ) and support vector machines (SVM) were used for the purpose of prediction of tumour category from a set of 10 input variables (age, Gleason score, preoperative PSA value, immunohistochemical scores for proliferation and p53-overexpression, 3 stereological parameters of angiogenesis, 2 stereological parameters of epithelial texture). In a stepwise logistic regression analysis with the tumour categories T1a and T1b as dependent variables, only the Gleason score and the volume fraction of epithelial cells proved to be significant as independent predictor variables of the tumour category. Using LVQ and SVM with the information from all 10 input variables, more than 80 of the cases could be correctly predicted as T1a or T1b category with specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive value from 74-92%. Using only the two significant input variables Gleason score and epithelial volume fraction, the accuracy of prediction was not worse.

Autosomal dominant FEVR (adFEVR), a major form of FEVR and assigned to chromosome 11q13-23 (EVR1) locus, is caused by deletion mutations in the C- terminal region of the frizzled-4 (FZD4) gene. This paper describes the clinical phenotype of adFEVR in two Japanese families with two different mutations in the FZD4 gene.\nWe encountered three Japanese patients with adFEVR and studied them using mutation analysis of the FZD4 gene with PCR, sequencing, and a restriction enzyme digestion.\nTwo previously unreported missense mutations, p.H69Y and p.C181R, were identified in the N-terminal extra- cellular region of two of the patients. This region was highly conserved among other vertebrate species and FZD family members, unlike the C-terminal region. Co-segregation analysis revealed that all affected individuals carried one of these mutations, while unaffected individuals did not. The mutations were not detected in normal individuals (n=120). The affected individuals had mild to severe retinal abnormalities.\nFZD4 mutations in either the N- or C-terminal region underlie adFEVR, which indicates that FZD4 plays an important role in retinal angiogenesis.

The production of three-dimensional (3D) polymeric scaffolds with tailored macroporous architecture is thus a crucial step in promoting controlled vascularization and tissue growth within host environments. In this study, 3D poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds were manufactured by a thermally induced phase-separation (TIPS) technique. By controlling the quenching strategy, 3D interconnected PLGA scaffolds with tunable pore size and alignment were obtained and characterized with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A series of numerical heat-transfer models were established in an effort to describe the cooling process within the PLGA freezing regime.

In 30 Chinchilla Bastard rabbits weighing from 3700 to 4200 g, a skeletonized arteriovenous pedicle with distal ligation harvested from the femoral and saphena magna artery and vein was implanted beneath an 8 x 15 cm abdominal skin flap to investigate the neovascularisation process in the flap over the course of time. In order to prevent neovascularisation occurring from the underlying vascular bed into the flap, a silicon sheet measuring 8 x 15 cm x 0.25 mm was placed and fixed on the abdominal wall. Flap vitality and neovascularisation process in prefabricated flaps were evaluated by macroscopic observation, blood analysis, selective microangiography, histology and scintigraphy at the various time intervals of 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 days. The study results showed that newly formed vessels sprouting from the implanted pedicle were seen four days after pedicle implantation. With the retention time of pedicle in the flaps, they continued to grow, became meander and more dense. Respective connections between newly formed vessels and the originally available vasculature of the abdominal flap were markedly observed in the 12- and 16-day groups. Twenty days after prefabrication, the abdominal flap was completely perfused by the blood flow supplied from the newly implanted arteriovenous pedicle through newly formed vessels arising from the implanted pedicle and their rich vascular communications. The neovascularisation in the prefabricated flap consisted of the implanted pedicle, newly formed vessels, the originally available vasculature and their vascular connections. In comparison to the control group (the quantification was determined of 100 %), the vessel quantity in the prefabricated flap of the 20-day group had increased to 98.7 %.

Developing capillary sprouts can be assessed by means of videomicroscopy and angiogenetic drugs can be tested using this model. Hairless mice allow for direct, long-term observation of the microcirculation in burns as well as during healing of dermal wounds. The pathophysiology of diabetic wound healing can also be studied. A mouse model to assess flap microcirculation during ischemia/reperfusion injury with special emphasis on platelet/endothelium interaction in vivo is described. Platelets adherent to the inner vessel wall are known to trigger compromised perfusion in flaps. The model allows us to test anti-thrombotic drugs.

Sixteen male Wistar rats were used. The superiorly based rectangular dorsal skin flap 3 x 3 cm was elevated at the interscapular region. Through this opening, paraspinal muscle dissection and three-level bilateral laminectomy were done. Finally, a dura defect with a diameter of 3-4 mm was created. In the control group, laminectomy was performed as in the study group but the dura was left intact. Persistent CSF leakage was confirmed using isotope cisternography. At the end of 2-week study period, there was no necrosis, infection, or dehiscence of the flap in either group. On necroscopy, cyst formation over the dura defect was detected in 4 animals of the study group. Another gross finding in this group was intensive vascularization of the undersurface of the flap and wound bed. With HE staining, the tissue sections from the study group revealed new vessel formation with small diameter, increase in the reactional mesenchymal tissue, granulation tissue, degeneration of the striated muscle fibers, dystrophic calcifications, fat necrosis, and coagulation necrosis (ischemic necrosis).

Resulting constructs implanted in athymic mice for more than 40 weeks developed new bone, cartilage, and tendon and became vascularized, but cell types comprising the constructs were unidentified. The origin of cells in middle phalanx models implanted for 20 weeks in nude mice has been studied by in situ hybridization analyzing species-specific gene expression. Oligonucleotide probes homologous to species-specific gene sequences of bovine type II and X collagen, aggrecan, bone sialoprotein, biglycan, and osteopontin, and mouse decorin were labeled with (35)S and hybridized to respective serial sections of bovine tissue, mouse tissue, and phalanx constructs. In situ hybridization showed positive message and tissue-specific localization for all bovine-specific probes examined within cartilaginous and midshaft portions of constructs and negative message for the mouse-specific decorin probe. These data show that osteoblasts and chondrocytes comprising constructs are derived exclusively from their original bovine sources over 20 weeks of implantation.

{"title": "Controlled respiratory gas delivery to embryonic renal epithelial explants in perfusion culture.", "abstract": "During generation of artificial tissues high levels of oxygen are usually available whereas after implantation into a recipient's body the implant is not vascularized immediately, which leads to low oxygen partial pressures within the implanted tissue. Under these conditions cells will experience an oxygen shortage, contrasting with the abundance of oxygen during culture. It is uncertain whether tissues can be trained to tolerate such an acute hypoxic situation so that nonphysiological stress reactions and tissue necrosis can be avoided. To investigate the effects of varying oxygen levels on embryonic renal tissue in vitro we have been developing a model system combining continuous medium renewal with the ability to control levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide by gas equilibration through gas-permeable tubing. Renal embryonic tissue from neonatal rabbit was cultured in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium at 45, 90, 115, and 160 mmHg oxygen partial pressure for 14 days under continuous medium exchange in such a setup. After a 14-day culture period tissue sections were analyzed by cell biological methods and compared with fresh tissue histology. Surprisingly, embryonic renal explants survive and maintain good morphology for 14 days under all O(2) conditions tested. Expression of cytokeratin 19 within the established epithelium remains unchanged, indicating a structurally intact tissue. However, Na/K-ATPase is clearly downregulated under low O(2) conditions, whereas COX-2 expression increases drastically. An antiparallel effect of decreased O(2) concentrations on glycoprotein expression can be demonstrated with the lectin Dolichos biflorus agglutinin.

Male allogeneic DNA was detected in wounds for the first 4 weeks. All subsequent time points were negative apart from one biopsy at 6 weeks. The wounds took 4-9 weeks to heal, with the Apligraf exhibiting no features of engraftment. This was in contrast to the rapid healing seen in the SSG control group.

Papillary dermal fibroblasts had a normal spindle cell shape; in contrast, adipose tissue fibroblasts had a stellate cell shape, actin stress fibers containing alpha-smooth muscle actin, multiple narrow extensions at their edges, and longer focal adhesion plaques. After dynamic culture for 14 days in PEGT/PBT carrier scaffolds, cell numbers between the two cell sources were comparable, but tissue morphology was different between the cultured groups. In addition, papillary fibroblasts had deposited significantly more glycosaminoglycans (214 +/- 15 versus 159 +/- 21 microg, p < 0.001) and a lower amount of collagen (49 +/- 14 versus 111 +/- 25 microg of hydroxyproline, p < 0.001) than had adipose fibroblasts. Moreover, the latter constructs were significantly more contracted than the papillary fibroblast-cultured constructs (78 +/- 6 versus 96 +/- 3%, p < 0.001). In comparison with the influence of cultured dermal equivalents on wound healing, the transplantation of five groups (control acellular carrier, papillary fibroblast-seeded construct, adipose fibroblast-seeded construct, papillary fibroblast-cultured construct, and adipose fibroblast-cultured construct) to full-thickness wounds on the backs of athymic mice showed clear differences in angiogenesis and tissue ingrowth after 10 days, and in reepithelialization after 21 days. After 10 days, the level of vascular ingrowth in the carrier (von Willebrand staining) for the five groups was as follows: adipose fibroblast-cultured > papillary fibroblast-cultured = adipose fibroblast-seeded > papillary fibroblast-seeded > acellular carrier. After 21 days, only the acellular carriers were not vascularized and the papillary fibroblast-seeded constructs were not completely vascularized. Complete wound reepithelialization (92 +/- 12%) was observed only in the group treated with adipose cultured constructs. Wound contraction was not observed. Staining for HLA-ABC and alpha-smooth muscle actin showed that human fibroblasts had survived and that adipose fibroblasts continued to express the actin isoform. These results showed not only stimulation of skin repair when fibroblasts were present in the carrier, but also significant positive effects of the deposited extracellular matrix (ECM) in the carrier. In addition, the adipose fibroblast-seeded construct, and especially the adipose fibroblast-cultured construct, significantly stimulated angiogenesis and reepithelialization when compared with their corresponding papillary fibroblast constructs.

{"title": "Reconstruction of maxillary and mandibular defects using prefabricated microvascular fibular grafts and osseointegrated dental implants -- a prospective study.", "abstract": "The fibular flap can be used for a variety of indications. Recently, the treatment of four patients with severely atrophied upper jaws using a method to prefabricate the vascularized fibular graft has been published. This technique consists of a two-stage operation procedure that allows simultaneous prosthodontic rehabilitation and immediate placement of dental implants. In this paper eight patients with 29 ITI implants (Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland) who had reconstruction of either the upper or lower jaw are presented. The aim of the study was (i) to evaluate the behavior of the newly formed soft tissue around implants inserted in the fibula by applying periodontal parameters, (ii) to monitor prospectively the integration of the implants in the fibular graft, and (iii) to assess the osseous integration of the fibular graft used for reconstruction of the upper or lower jaw. Two implants failed during the observation time because of avascular bone at the distal end of the fibular graft. Stabilization of the graft, however, was never compromised. Due to the prefabrication firmly attached gingiva-like soft tissue could be provided preventing periimplant soft tissue inflammation and facilitating oral hygiene. After 1 year of observation the mean attachment level was similar to implants placed in original bone whereas vertical bone loss measured radiographically was lower in the present study. This may indicate that the remodeling of a bicortical bone requires a longer period of time compared with the bone of the alveolar crest. The prospective 1-year results are promising but long-term evaluation of periodontal and radiological parameters are required.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2004-09-10", "authors": ["ClaudeJaqui\u00e9ry", "DennisRohner", "ChristophKunz", "PeterBucher", "Fran\u00e7oisePeters", "Robert KSchenk", "BeatHammer"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0501.2004.01065.x"}

Six hearts belonging to donkeys of different age and sex constituted the material of the study. Following exposition of the arteries by means of injection of latex coloured with Rotring ink to a. coronaria sinistra and a. coronaria dextra, dissection was performed. The arterial vascularization of the heart in donkeys was determined to be supplied by a. coronaria sinistra and a. coronaria dextra which originate from the aorta. A. coronaria sinistra, measured to be larger than a. coronaria dextra, was determined to have its origin at the aorta, at the level of the free border of valvula semilunaris sinistra, and to extend between truncus pulmonalis and auricula sinistra. The mentioned artery was detected to give off two branches, namely, ramus interventricularis paraconalis and ramus circumflexus sinister which extend in sulcus interventricularis paraconalis and sulcus coronarius, respectively. However, a. coronaria dextra was determined to have its origin at the beginning of the aorta, at the level of valvula semilunaris dextra, and to extend to margo ventricularis dexter between truncus pulmonalis and auricula dexter. This study has revealed ramus interventricularis subsinuosus and ramus circumflexus dexter to intercommunicate by means of anastomosis and to form a. coronaria dexter. Examination of material revealed the absence of anastomosis between r. circumflexus sinister and r. circumflexus dexter. Branches named rami septales, originating from ramus interventricularis paraconalis and ramus interventricularis subsinuosus were determined to supply septum interventriculare. Ramus proximalis atrii sinistri was determined to have its origin at ramus circumflexus sinister whereas ramus proximalis venriculi dextri was determined to stem from the beginning of a. coronaria dextra in the material of this study.

Concerning the vascular pathology, the intra-arterial occlusive therapy can be used in some types of head and neck malformations, isolated or in association to surgery, to accomplish the complete removal of the \"nidus\" of the malformation, or for cosmetic purposes. Regarding the post traumatic arteriovenous fistulas, intra-arterial or intravenous embolization has been widely used and reported. The authors describe in this paper their experience with the endovascular management of carotid-cavernous post-traumatic fistulas, as well as with extracranial post traumatic a-v fistulas, related to the external carotid, vertebral and subclavian arterial branches. According to the location and type of the a-v shunt, several different strategies can be devised and diverse materials can be employed for embolization, like destacable microbaloons, cianocrilate, PVA particles and platin spirals. All the carotid-cavernous lesions were successfully occluded. In the extracranial lesions group, a successful result could not be obtained in one patient, who presented multiple a-v fistulas, and despite that he was clinically improved. In the present series of patients, only one case of cerebral thromboembolism was reported as a complication, with favourable outcome.

The disadvantage of this approach is frequently an obvious scar affecting the neck and a conspicuous hollow contour around the angle of the mandible in addition to a sweat secretion of the cheek (Frey syndrome). To overcome these disadvantages, especially the facial depressed deformity subsequent to parotid surgery, during the last several years, the author has concentrated on facelift incision used in combination with a hybrid SMAS rotation advancement flap. Twelve patients (7 male; 5 female) ranging in age from 32 to 73 years (mean age, 57.8 years) fulfilled the selection criterion of having a clinically benign discrete parotid lump with a benign preoperative fine-needle cytology result. Parotidectomy was performed using the modified facelift incision in conjunction with the rotation advancement hybrid SMAS flap. All patients were followed up every 3 months during the first year. During follow-up, the patients were specifically asked about their satisfaction with their postoperative appearance and whether they would consent to the operation again. The vascularized hybrid vicryl mesh/SMAS rotation advancement flap is clinically simple to perform and provides satisfactory cosmetic and functional results in patients undergoing conservative parotidectomy and prevents the gustatory sweating.

{"title": "Rapid lengthening of rabbit mandibular ramus by using nitinol spring: a preliminary study.", "abstract": "Nitinol is well known for its shape memory and superelasticity, which means it can return to its original shape from large deflections and produce moderate forces in the process. Based on these characteristics, the authors attempted to use an internal Nitinol spring for automatic lengthening of mandibular ramus. Twenty adult white rabbits underwent transverse osteotomy in unilateral mandibular ramus to remove a 15.0 mm condylar segment and L-osteotomy in remnant ramus to create a vascularized transport disc. The S-shaped Nitinol spring, with two ends bent as perpendicular underprops, was constricted and secured across the transverse gap of L osteotomy by the underprops. Six animals were killed 6 days after operation for observation of bone transport rate. Other surviving rabbits were killed 8 weeks later for morphologic and histologic examination. Mechanical testing revealed moderate output of tensile elasticity by constricted spring on shape recovery in 37 degrees C. Rapid lengthening of mandibular ramus, more than 9.0 mm in 5 to 6 days, and new bone formation in 8 weeks were found. The radiograph and histologic appearance of regenerated bone was similar to those seen with traditional distraction osteogenesis. This preliminary study demonstrates the possibility of spring-mediated rapid mandibular lengthening across an osteotomy.

{"title": "Effect of tendon release and delayed repair on the structure of the muscles of the rotator cuff: an experimental study in sheep.", "abstract": "Ruptures of the tendons of the rotator cuff lead to profound and possibly irreversible changes in the structure and physiological properties of the rotator cuff muscles. Muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration are important prognostic factors that affect the natural history and outcome of treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the amount of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration in an animal model and to determine whether the repair of a long-standing tendon tear can reverse these changes.\nThe infraspinatus tendon in six sheep was released and encased in a silicone tube to prevent spontaneous healing. The musculotendinous unit was allowed to retract for forty weeks. Throughout this period, the muscular changes were studied with use of computed tomography, histological analysis, and electron microscopy. At forty weeks, the elasticity, intramuscular pressure, and perfusion were measured intraoperatively and a tendon repair was carried out. The structural changes of the muscle were studied for thirty-five weeks after the repair. The animals were then killed, and the musculotendinous units were examined macroscopically and by computed tomography, histological analysis, and electron microscopy.\nAt the time of the tendon release, the infraspinatus showed no fatty changes. The force needed to cause a tendon excursion of 1 cm was a mean (and standard deviation) of 6.8 +/- 1 N. The application of tension on the tendon did not alter the perfusion and decreased the intramuscular pressure. After the tendon release, muscular atrophy developed and there was a significant increase (p < 0.001) in interfascicular and intrafascicular fat, representing fatty infiltration rather than fatty degeneration. Furthermore, there was an increase of interstitial connective tissue. At the time of the tendon repair, between forty and forty-two weeks after the release, there was a sevenfold poorer elasticity of the musculotendinous unit but preserved muscle perfusion. The structural changes increased six weeks after the repair and then recovered partially at twelve and thirty-five weeks thereafter but only to the amount demonstrated before the repair.\nMusculotendinous retraction induced by tendon release is associated with profound changes in the structure and function of the affected muscle. Vascularization, intramuscular pressure, and individual fiber composition are not markedly affected, and muscle fibers do not appear to degenerate. However, muscle atrophy, infiltration by fat cells, and an increase of interstitial connective tissue lead to impairment of the physiological properties of the muscle. These changes were irreversible under the conditions of this experiment with the repair technique used.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Another developmental event involving proteolysis is myelin formation, whereby the extensive processes elaborated from oligodendrocytes (OLs) enwrap axons. Here we find MMP-12 transcripts to be produced by OLs in much higher levels than other MMP members examined. MMP-12 activity correlated with the ability of OLs to extend processes in vitro, suggesting a role for MMP-12 in the morphological differentiation of OLs. This was corroborated by results that OL lineage cells from MMP-12 null mice were retarded in their ability to differentiate morphologically and that this deficiency was overcome by the exogenous addition of active MMP-12. Finally, the maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to OLs was significantly reduced in cultures from MMP-12 null mice compared with wild-type controls. We conclude that OL lineage cells express MMP-12 during their maturation and that MMP-12 activity has functional involvement both in maturation of OPCs and in the ability of OPCs and OLs to extend processes.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2004-09-03", "authors": ["Peter HLarsen", "V WeeYong"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2092-04.2004"}

In Id-deficient mice, tumor transplantation and proangiogenic factors fail to mobilize and recruit circulating endothelial precursor cells (CEPs) and hematopoietic cells, leading to defective tumor angiogenesis in various models. To investigate the requirement of Id genes and bone marrow incorporation in spontaneous prostate tumors, we crossbred Id mutant mice with the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Id1-/- Id3+/- TRAMP mice display delayed tumor growth at 24 weeks compared with wild-type TRAMP mice. Id1 and Id3 were strongly expressed in the endothelial cells of poorly differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma but not in the vasculature of well-differentiated tumors, a finding that is corroborated in human prostate tumor samples. In Id-deficient TRAMP mice, the poorly differentiated tumors show extensive hemorrhage, whereas well-differentiated tumors exhibit none. Transplantation with Id wild-type bone marrow significantly reduced the hemorrhage in poorly differentiated prostate adenocarcinomas with bone marrow-derived endothelial cells contributing to 14% of the tumor blood vessels. However, in well-differentiated prostate adenocarcinomas, there was little evidence of bone marrow-derived endothelial cell incorporation. These differences in the expression of Id genes, the effects of Id loss, and the recruitment of bone marrow-derived endothelial precursor cells in tumor vasculature between well-differentiated and poorly differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma suggest that tumor angiogenesis varies depending on the tumor grade.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2004-09-03", "authors": ["HaiqingLi", "William LGerald", "RobertBenezra"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1287"}

Deletion of ILK in zebra fish using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides results in marked patterning abnormalities of the vasculature and is similarly lethal. To dissect potential mechanisms responsible for these phenotypes, we performed ex vivo deletion of ILK from purified EC of adult mice. We observed downregulation of the active-conformation of beta1 integrins with a striking increase in EC apoptosis associated with activation of caspase 9. There was also reduced phosphorylation of the ILK kinase substrate, Akt. However, phenotypic rescue of ILK-deficient EC by wild-type ILK, but not by a constitutively active mutant of Akt, suggests regulation of EC survival by ILK in an Akt-independent manner. Thus, endothelial ILK plays a critical role in vascular development through integrin-matrix interactions and EC survival.

We recently isolated a novel macrocyclic compound, versipelostatin (VST), that inhibits transcription from the promoter of GRP78, a gene that is activated as part of the UPR. We examined the effect of VST on the UPR induced by glucose deprivation or other stressors and on tumor growth in vivo.\nHuman colon cancer HT-29, fibrosarcoma HT1080, and stomach cancer MKN74 cells were cultured in the absence of glucose or in the presence of glucose and a UPR-inducing chemical stressor (the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, the calcium ionophore A23187, or the hypoglycemia-mimicking agent 2-deoxyglucose [2DG]). The effect of VST on UPR induction was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis of the UPR target genes GRP78 and GRP94; by immunoblot analysis of the UPR transcriptional activators ATF6, XBP1, and ATF4; and by analyzing reporter gene expression in cells transiently transfected with a GRP78 promoter-reporter gene. Cell sensitivity to VST was examined with a colony formation assay and flow cytometry. In vivo antitumor activity of VST was assessed with an MKN74 xenograft model.\nVST inhibited expression of UPR target genes in glucose-deprived or 2DG-treated cells but not in cells treated with tunicamycin or A23187. VST also inhibited the production of the UPR transcriptional activators XBP1 and ATF4 during glucose deprivation. The UPR-inhibitory action of VST was seen only in conditions of glucose deprivation and caused selective and massive killing of the glucose-deprived cells. VST alone and in combination with cisplatin statistically significantly (P =.004 and P<.001 for comparisons with untreated control, respectively) inhibited tumor growth of MKN74 xenografts.\nDisruption of the UPR may provide a novel therapeutic approach to targeting glucose-deprived solid tumors.", "journal": "Journal of the National Cancer Institute", "date": "2004-09-02", "authors": ["Hae-RyongPark", "AkihiroTomida", "ShigeoSato", "YoshinoriTsukumo", "JisooYun", "TakaoYamori", "YoichiHayakawa", "TakashiTsuruo", "KazuoShin-ya"], "doi": "10.1093/jnci/djh243"}

In addition some chemokines have been reported to modulate cell survival and growth. Moreover, compelling evidence is accumulating that cancer cells may employ several mechanisms involving chemokine-chemokine receptor axes during their metastasis that also regulate the trafficking of normal cells. Of all the chemokines, stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), an alpha-chemokine that binds to G-protein-coupled CXCR4, plays an important and unique role in the regulation of stem/progenitor cell trafficking. First, SDF-1 regulates the trafficking of CXCR4+ haemato/lymphopoietic cells, their homing/retention in major haemato/lymphopoietic organs and accumulation of CXCR4+ immune cells in tissues affected by inflammation. Second, CXCR4 plays an essential role in the trafficking of other tissue/organ specific stem/progenitor cells expressing CXCR4 on their surface, e.g., during embryo/organogenesis and tissue/organ regeneration. Third, since CXCR4 is expressed on several tumour cells, these CXCR4 positive tumour cells may metastasize to the organs that secrete/express SDF-1 (e.g., bones, lymph nodes, lung and liver). SDF-1 exerts pleiotropic effects regulating processes essential to tumour metastasis such as locomotion of malignant cells, their chemoattraction and adhesion, as well as plays an important role in tumour vascularization. This implies that new therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis could have important applications in the clinic by modulating the trafficking of haemato/lymphopoietic cells and inhibiting the metastatic behaviour of tumour cells as well.

Tumor-infiltrating DCs migrated to tumor vessels and independently assembled neovasculature in vivo. Bone marrow-derived DCs underwent endothelial-like differentiation ex vivo, migrated to blood vessels and promoted the growth of tumors expressing high levels of Vegf-A. We show that beta-defensins and Vegf-A cooperate to promote tumor vasculogenesis by carrying out distinct tasks: beta-defensins chemoattract DC precursors through CCR6, whereas Vegf-A primarily induces their endothelial-like specialization and migration to vessels, which is mediated by Vegf receptor-2.", "journal": "Nature medicine", "date": "2004-08-31", "authors": ["Jose RConejo-Garcia", "FabianBenencia", "Maria-CeciliaCourreges", "EugeneKang", "AlishaMohamed-Hadley", "Ronald JBuckanovich", "David OHoltz", "AnnJenkins", "HanaNa", "LinZhang", "Daniel SWagner", "DionyssiosKatsaros", "RichardCaroll", "GeorgeCoukos"], "doi": "10.1038/nm1097"}

The aim of this study was to investigate mRNA expression for ANPT1, ANPT-2 and Tie2 in granulosa cells (GC) during follicular development in the cow.

The mRNA expression for ANPT-2 was drastically decreased in the follicles with E(2)>5 ng/ml. Tie2 mRNA expression remained unchanged at the different stages of follicular development. The present data show that ANPT-1 becomes predominant in the follicle producing high levels of E(2), indicating the possible switch-over from ANPT-2 (antagonist) to ANPT-1 (agonist).

The nerve in growth deep into annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus was observed mainly along the strip zone of granulation tissue in the painful discs.\nFindings indicate that the strip zone of granulation tissue with extensive innervation in the posterior part of the painful disc is the original site of the pain of discography and the discogenic low back pain. The strip zone of granulation tissue might originate from the injury and subsequent reparation of the margin of annulus fibrosus.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a series of patients with jugular foramen tumors who were surgically treated in the past 16 years, and to analyze the surgical technique, complications, and outcomes.\nThe authors retrospectively studied 102 patients with jugular foramen tumors treated between January 1987 and May 2004. All patients underwent surgery with a multidisciplinary method combining neurosurgical and ear, nose, and throat techniques. Preoperative embolization was performed for paragangliomas and other highly vascularized lesions. To avoid postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and to improve cosmetic results, the surgical defect was reconstructed with specially developed vascularized flaps (temporalis fascia, cervical fascia, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and temporalis muscle). A saphenous graft bypass was used in two patients with tumor infiltrating the internal carotid artery (ICA). Facial nerve reconstruction was performed with grafts of the great auricular nerve or with 12th/seventh cranial nerve anastomosis. Residual malignant and invasive tumors were irradiated after partial removal. The most common tumor was paraganglioma (58 cases), followed by schwannomas (17 cases) and meningiomas (10 cases). Complete excision was possible in 45 patients (77.5%) with paragangliomas and in all patients with schwannomas. The most frequent and also the most dangerous surgical complication was lower cranial nerve deficit. This deficit occurred in 10 patients (10%), but it was transient in four cases. Postoperative facial and cochlear nerve paralysis occurred in eight patients (8%); spontaneous recovery occurred in three of them. In the remaining five patients the facial nerve was reconstructed using great auricular nerve grafts (three cases), sural nerve graft (one case), and hypoglossal/facial nerve anastomosis (one case). Four patients (4%) experienced postoperative CSF leakage, and four (4.2%) died after surgery. Two of them died of aspiration pneumonia complicated with septicemia. Of the remaining two, one died of pulmonary embolism and the other of cerebral hypoxia caused by a large cervical hematoma that led to tracheal deviation.\nParagangliomas are the most common tumors of the jugular foramen region. Surgical management of jugular foramen tumors is complex and difficult. Radical removal of benign jugular foramen tumors is the treatment of choice, may be curative, and is achieved with low mortality and morbidity rates. Larger lesions can be radically excised in one surgical procedure by using a multidisciplinary approach. Reconstruction of the skull base with vascularized myofascial flaps reduces postoperative CSF leaks.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of moderate (40%) DR on the orthotopic growth of mouse and human brain tumors that differ in cell origin, angiogenicity, host environment, and biochemical composition.\nA malignant mouse astrocytoma (CT-2A) and a human glioma (U87-MG) were highly angiogenic and fast growing, whereas a mouse ependymoblastoma was less vascularized and slower growing. The tumors were evaluated for growth, cell proliferation, microvessel density, and apoptosis under DR and ad libitum feeding. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I levels were examined as angiogenic biomarkers.\nDR significantly decreased vascularity (factor VIII) and increased apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling) in all tumors. These effects were associated with enhanced caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in the CT-2A and ependymoblastoma tumors, but not in the U87-MG tumor. DR also caused reductions of serum insulin-like growth factor I and glucose levels.\nDR had significant antiangiogenic and proapoptotic effects in the three distinct brain tumor models. DR, however, had differential effects on cell proliferation, biomarkers of angiogenesis, and apoptosis, suggesting multiple mechanisms of action.

Chondrocyte dedifferentiation was monitored by the synthesis of cathepsin B by these cells. Chondrocytes freshly isolated at each subculture (subcultures 1-3) were stimulated with IL-17, IL-1beta or TNF-alpha. Supernatants were collected, immunoassayed for the production of VEGF and cathepsin B and assayed as the source of VEGF on the VEGF sensible ECV304 cell line. The cells were used to quantify intracellular cathepsin B enzymatic activity.\nIn differentiated conditions IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, but not IL-17, can inhibit the spontaneous secretion of VEGF by human OA, RA and FP chondrocytes, and IL-17 can restore the decrease in VEGF secretion caused by TNF-alpha. IL-17, together with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, can enhance VEGF secretion to various extents by dedifferentiated OA chondrocytes. This change in effect with respect to primary culture was observable for all cytokines at the beginning of dedifferentiation, when the production of VEGF by chondrocytes had dramatically fallen and the cathepsin B synthesis had increased. The amount of VEGF induced by cytokines on dedifferentiated chondrocytes never reached the amount of VEGF produced by differentiated chondrocytes. VEGF produced by chondrocytes stimulated the ECV304 cell line proliferation.\nThese results indicate that dedifferentiated OA chondrocytes secrete VEGF after stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines.

We have employed a spheroidal coculture system of endothelial cells (EC) and osteoblasts (OB) to study cell contact-dependent gene regulation between these two cell types that may play a role in regulating OB differentiation and EC angiogenic properties. Coculture spheroids differentiate spontaneously to organize into a core of OB and a surface layer of endothelial cells. Individual spheroid culture of EC or OB leads to significant alterations in gene expression compared to standard monolayer culture (upregulation of Tie-2 in EC; upregulation of angiopoietin-2 in osteoblasts). More importantly, spheroidal coculture of endothelial cells and osteoblasts leads to significant changes of gene expression in both cell populations (upregulation of VEGFR-2 in EC; downregulation of VEGF, and upregulation of alkaline phosphatase in osteoblasts). These changes are dependent on cell-cell contact and are not seen in stimulation experiments with conditioned supernatants.

We report here that attenuation of ILK expression in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells by RNA interference had marked effects on surface distribution of alpha5beta1 integrin and the organization of cell-matrix adhesions characterized by the disappearance of fibrillar (3D-like) adhesions that are rich in alpha5beta1 and paxillin, and associated fibrillar fibronectin matrix. This defect was not caused by a decrease in fibronectin mRNA levels or by intracellular retention of the protein. Adhesion to surface-adsorbed matrix proteins based on beta1 and beta3 integrin was enhanced following ILK depletion, whereas cell spreading, migration and multilayer alignment into capillary-like structures on Matrigel were impaired.

Although changes in the metabolism of insulin-like growth factor I and glucocorticoids have been proposed to modulate these cellular processes, limitations in blood supply could induce similar effects. To investigate this possibility, female Sprague Dawley rats were given an injection of 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea and fed purified diets ad libitum or at 60% ad libitum intake, i.e., 40% dietary energy restriction. Premalignant mammary pathologies and mammary adenocarcinomas obtained from these rats were processed for vascular density analysis via CD-31 immunostaining. Vascular density, measured as vessels/unit area, of premalignant mammary pathologies and adenocarcinomas from dietary energy restriction rats was reduced 31 and 39%, respectively (P < 0.01). This effect, which was observed in a 50-microm wide band of tissue surrounding each pathology, was exerted on blood vessels > 25 microm2. Conversely, intratumoral vascular density was unaffected by dietary energy restriction. cDNA microarray and Western blot analyses of adenocarcinomas for evidence of dietary energy restriction-mediated effects on vascularization revealed that only the level of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor protein Flk-1 was significantly reduced (P < 0.001). It appears that dietary energy restriction imposes limitations in the supply of blood to developing pathologies, an effect that could directly inhibit the carcinogenic process. The vascular density data imply that dietary energy restriction inhibited the growth of endothelial cells but leave unresolved the question of whether dietary energy restriction had a specific effect on angiogenesis.

The aim of this part of the study was microscopic evaluation of repair tissue thickness and its integration with surrounding cartilage, after autologous chondrocyte transplantation.\nRepair of partial thickness cartilage defect (ICRS III(o) grade) on distal femur joint surface was evaluated (25 adolescent rabbits). Procedures were performed in two groups: I--autologous chondrocyte transplantation under periosteal flap, II--periosteal graft. Chondrocytes were isolated from the cartilage specimens by enzymatic digestion and cultured in vitro. The follow-up periods were established at 4, 8, 12 weeks. Repair tissue was evaluated microscopically according to modified O'Driscoll scale.\nIn group I, 8 weeks after the procedure most of defects were filled with the newly formed tissue almost completely. Regenerate thickness after 4 and 12 weeks usually exceeded 1/2 of surrounding cartilage. In group II, 8 weeks after the procedure regenerate thickness amounted to at least 1/2 of surrounding cartilage, but 4- and 12-week observation revealed the decreased repair tissue thickness. In group I, 4 weeks after the procedure regenerative tissue was well integrated with surrounding cartilage, and this trait still gradually increased with time. In group II, there was partial integration or no integration of repair tissue with surrounding cartilage.\nObtained results indicate, that tissue formed after autologous chondrocyte transplantation with use of periosteal flap was better in its thickness and integration with surrounding cartilage, as compared to tissue formed after use of periosteum alone.

Different classifications separate vascular lesions of soft tissues into hemangiomas and vascular malformations on the basis of their natural history, location, cellular turnover, and histology. Soft-tissue vascular malformations are relatively common. These lesions can be categorized on MR imaging because of their typical appearance as multiple lobules with fat overgrowth and serpentine channels, depending on the vascular flow. The combination of conventional MR and MR angiography (MRA) enable the differentiation between low-flow and high-flow vascular malformations and allows a noninvasive diagnostic strategy.

Defects in the anterior lamella of the eyelids can be readily repaired with skin grafts or flaps but posterior lamellar reconstruction needs more complex applications. METHODS: We performed posterior lamellar eyelid reconstruction with posterior parts of the temporalis fascia, since their anatomical and histological features are very similar to the defects. Nine patients with skin tumors located on the periorbital region were treated with local skin flaps and deep layer of the temporalis fascia. RESULTS: Grafts were harvested very easily. There was no complication related with graft or donor site. Biopsy was performed in three cases and normal conjunctival elements were seen. Functional and acceptable aesthetically results were achieved in all patients. CONCLUSION: Ideal reconstructive material for replacement of the posterior lamina is still lacking. Tarsal reconstruction can be made with deep temporalis fascia with success since the thickness of the both tissues are very similar and also since the loose areolar layer of the temporalis fascia is very thin and highly vascularized, this layer can be used in reconstruction of the conjunctiva.

This method uses reasonable assumptions about the structure of the reduced scattering spectrum and basis absorption spectra for oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, which dominate tissue absorption in the visible region of the spectrum. Using a hybrid P3-diffusion description of light propagation, described originally by Hull and Foster [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 18, 584-599 (2001)] and suitable for short (approximately 1 mm) source-detector separations and optical properties of tissue at visible wavelengths, we create a forward model of the diffuse reflectance with four free parameters. We demonstrate that this model is able to recover accurately the hemoglobin concentrations and scattering properties from synthetic data generated by Monte Carlo simulation and from reflectance spectra acquired from tissue-simulating phantoms containing intact human erythrocytes. We show also that the method is capable of monitoring carbogen-induced changes in murine tumor oxygenation in vivo. The successful implementation of single, short detector separations enables the measurement of intratumor heterogeneities in hemoglobin oxygen saturation and responses to carbogen using a simple fiber-based probe design.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2004-08-13", "authors": ["Jarod CFinlay", "Thomas HFoster"], "doi": "10.1118/1.1760188"}
{"title": "Role of Sonic hedgehog in patterning of tracheal-bronchial cartilage and the peripheral lung.", "abstract": "Sonic hedgehog (Shh) was conditionally deleted in respiratory epithelial cells of the embryonic lung in vivo. Deletion of Shh before embryonic day (E) 13.5 resulted in respiratory failure at birth. While lobulation was not perturbed, the lungs were hypoplastic, with reduced branching of peripheral lung tubules, evident from E13.5. Smooth muscle and endothelial cells were absent or reduced, the latter in relationship to the loss of peripheral lung parenchyma. Tracheal-bronchial ring abnormalities occurred when Shh was deleted between E8.5 and E12.5. Deletion of Shh later in gestation (after E13.5) caused mild abrogation of peripheral branching morphogenesis but did not disrupt tracheal-bronchial development. Defects in branching morphogenesis and vascularization seen in Shh null mutant (Shh(-/-)) mice were substantially corrected when SHH was ectopically expressed in the respiratory epithelium; however, peripheral expression of SHH failed to correct cartilage abnormalities in the trachea and bronchi, indicating a spatial requirement for SHH expression near sites of cartilage formation. Expression of SHH by the respiratory epithelium plays an important role in the patterning of tracheal-bronchial mesenchyme required for formation of cartilage rings in conducting airways. SHH regulates branching morphogenesis and influences differentiation of the peripheral lung mesenchyme required for formation of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2004-08-12", "authors": ["Leigh-Anne DMiller", "Susan EWert", "Jean CClark", "YanXu", "Anne-Karina TPerl", "Jeffrey AWhitsett"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.20105"}

Following elimination of a latency phase and a threefold increase in the rate of distraction, there was a further delay in bone regeneration and a higher rate of non-union (60%). Instead of bone, the distraction gap was comprised of adipose or fibrous tissue. Once again, despite the rigorous distraction protocol, we detected equivalent PECAM staining within the distraction gap. In a minority of cases, cartilage and osseous tissues occupied the distraction gap likely by a prolonged process of endochondral ossification.\nHere, we have altered the mechanical environment in such a way to reproducibly create delays in skeletal regeneration.

{"title": "VEGF isoforms and their expression after a single episode of hypoxia or repeated fluctuations between hyperoxia and hypoxia: relevance to clinical ROP.", "abstract": "Fluctuations in oxygen are associated with the development of severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in humans. However, the causal relationships between oxygen variability and severe ROP remain unknown. We investigated whether isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were differentially stimulated by hypoxia and by repeated fluctuations between hypoxia and hyperoxia, and whether isoforms were differentially expressed in association with intravitreous neovascularization. We also determined whether pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) was dysregulated by oxygen fluctuations perhaps contributing to a delay in normal retinal vascular development.\nWe used the 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy (50/10 OIR) model that exposes newborn rat pups to repeated cycles of 24 h of 50% oxygen alternating with 24 h of 10% oxygen to cause a condition similar to human ROP. Animals were euthanized at postnatal day 2 (P2; after one cycle of 50/10% oxygen), P7 (after 3.5 cycles of 50/10% oxygen), and P14 (after seven cycles of 50/10% oxygen). Room air raised control rat pups were also exposed to a single episode of 24 h of hypoxia at P7 and P14 and assayed immediately afterwards. Retinal VEGF isoforms and PEDF were measured by RT-PCR. Total VEGF protein was measured by ELISA.\nWe found that repeated cycles of hyperoxia and hypoxia caused greater expression of VEGF protein compared to control than did a single cycle of hyperoxia and hypoxia. VEGF164 mRNA had a greater fold change over control after repeated oxygen fluctuations than after a single episode of hypoxia. However, the other isoforms, VEGF188 and VEGF120, were expressed to a similar degree regardless of whether the stimulus was a single episode of hypoxia or repeated fluctuations in oxygen. VEGF164 was the predominant isoform expressed at the time of maximal intravitreous neovascularization. Retinal PEDF expression was elevated in pups in the 50/10 OIR model compared to control at P7, immediately after 50% oxygen. PEDF expression in the experimental group was similar to control at P18, when intravitreous neovascularization occurred.\nRepeated fluctuations in oxygen results in a greater expression of the pathologic isoform, VEGF164, than does hypoxia alone. However, the other isoforms were upregulated to an equivalent degree over control by repeated fluctuations in oxygen or a single episode of hypoxia. Total VEGF protein was increased to a greater degree by repeated fluctuations in oxygen compared to a single cycle of oxygen. PEDF was increased over control early in the 50/10 OIR model and may play a role in the observed delay in retinal vascularization.

Since several peptides adopting a beta-sheet conformation have been shown to be anti-angiogenic, we investigated the effect of Abeta on angiogenesis. We show that in vitro, Abeta dose-dependently inhibits the formation of capillaries by human brain endothelial cells plated on Matrigel and stimulates capillary degeneration at high doses. Preparations of Abeta peptides containing a higher content of beta-sheet structures are more potently anti-angiogenic in vitro. Ex vivo, Abeta dose-dependently opposes angiogenesis in rat aortae and in human middle cerebral arteries. In vivo, Abeta dose dependently inhibits angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay and suppresses bFGF-induced blood vessel formation in the corneal micropocket and Matrigel plug assays. Since angiogenesis is required for tumor growth, we explored the effect of Abeta on human glioblastoma (U87MG) and human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) tumors. We show that intra-tumoral injection of Abeta potently inhibits the growth and vascularization of human glioblastoma and human lung adenocarcinoma tumor xenografts in nude mice.

Oncogenic activation of Neu can also occur through multiple molecular mechanisms, including a point mutation in the transmembrane domain, deletion of the extracellular domain and short in-frame deletions of 7-12 amino acids in the extracellular region proximal to the transmembrane domain. Because of the highly vascularized phenotype of breast and ovarian cancers and the contribution of the Neu receptor to the development and progression of these tumors, we investigated the effect of Neu on the expression of the tumor angiogenesis factor VEGF. Expression of various activated Neu receptors but not wild-type Neu in Rat-1 cells, leads to increased VEGF expression on mRNA as well as on protein level. This effect is mediated by transcriptional activation of the VEGF promoter via a cluster of Sp 1 binding sites. Molecular analysis of the activation mechanism of Sp 1 revealed that neither the VEGF promoter binding activity of Sp 1 nor the expression of Sp 1 is affected by Neu transformation of the cells. Instead, functional Neu-induced transactivation of Sp 1 was observed by using a GAL4-based transactivation assay.

Effects on tumor-induced vascularization were quantified using an anti-factor VIII-related antigen monoclonal antibody.\nZD6126 attenuated the growth of human A549 flank xenografts compared with untreated animals. Marked antitumor effects were observed when animals were treated with a combination of ZD6126 and fractionated radiation therapy with protracted tumor regression.

Finally, the addition of ZD6126 to ZD1839 and radiation therapy seemed to further improve tumor growth control, with a significant tumor growth delay compared with animals treated with single agent or with double combinations. Immunohistochemistry showed that ZD1839 induced a marked reduction in A549 tumor cell proliferation. Both ZD1839 and ZD6126 treatment substantially reduced tumor-induced angiogenesis.

We also studied the presence of T. whipplei in valves by immunohistochemical analysis, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In histologic analysis, Whipple endocarditis was characterized by significant fibrosis, a lack of calcifications, slight inflammation and vascularization, and vegetations of intermediate size. Inflammatory infiltrates consisted mainly of foamy macrophages and lymphocytes. We found that the detection of T. whipplei in cardiac valves, by immunohistochemical analysis, was correlated with the detection of the bacterium by culture and PCR. We report, for the first time, the immunodetection of T. whipplei in a surgically removed arterial embolus. Pathological and immunohistologic analyses may contribute to the diagnosis of Whipple endocarditis.", "journal": "The Journal of infectious diseases", "date": "2004-08-06", "authors": ["HubertLepidi", "FlorenceFenollar", "J StephenDumler", "Val\u00e9rieGauduchon", "LaraChalabreysse", "AntoineBammert", "Marie-FranceBonzi", "Fran\u00e7oiseThivolet-B\u00e9jui", "Fran\u00e7oisVandenesch", "DidierRaoult"], "doi": "10.1086/422845"}
{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor: basic science and clinical progress.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen in vitro and an angiogenic inducer in a variety of in vivo models. Hypoxia has been shown to be a major inducer of VEGF gene transcription. The tyrosine kinases Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and Flk-1/KDR (VEGFR-2) are high-affinity VEGF receptors. The role of VEGF in developmental angiogenesis is emphasized by the finding that loss of a single VEGF allele results in defective vascularization and early embryonic lethality. VEGF is critical also for reproductive and bone angiogenesis. Substantial evidence also implicates VEGF as a mediator of pathological angiogenesis. In situ hybridization studies demonstrate expression of VEGF mRNA in the majority of human tumors. Anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies and other VEGF inhibitors block the growth of several tumor cell lines in nude mice. Clinical trials with various VEGF inhibitors in a variety of malignancies are ongoing. Very recently, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab; Avastin) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy.

{"title": "Hedgehog signaling is essential for endothelial tube formation during vasculogenesis.", "abstract": "During embryonic development, the first blood vessels are formed through the aggregation and subsequent assembly of angioblasts (endothelial precursors) into a network of endothelial tubes, a process known as vasculogenesis. These first vessels generally form in mesoderm that is adjacent to endodermal tissue. Although specification of the angioblast lineage is independent of endoderm interactions, a signal from the endoderm is necessary for angioblasts to assemble into a vascular network and to undergo vascular tube formation. In this study, we show that endodermally derived sonic hedgehog is both necessary and sufficient for vascular tube formation in avian embryos. We also show that Hedgehog signaling is required for vascular tube formation in mouse embryos, and for vascular cord formation in cultured mouse endothelial cells. These results demonstrate a previously uncharacterized role for Hedgehog signaling in vascular development, and identify Hedgehog signaling as an important component of the molecular pathway leading to vascular tube formation.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2004-08-06", "authors": ["Steven AVokes", "Tatiana AYatskievych", "Ronald LHeimark", "JillMcMahon", "Andrew PMcMahon", "Parker BAntin", "Paul AKrieg"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.01304"}

Previous experimental studies showed altered expression of transforming growth factor-(TGF-)beta isoforms following surgery in irradiated graft beds. Altered levels of TGF-beta(1) are reported to promote fibrosis and to suppress vascularization during wound healing, whereas expression of TGF-beta receptor-III (TGF-betaR-III) is associated with vascularization. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of anti-TGF-beta(1) treatment on TGF-betaR-III-associated vascularization in the transition area between irradiated graft bed and graft.\nWistar rats (male, weight 300-500 g) underwent preoperative irradiation of the head and neck region with 40 Gy (four fractions of 10 Gy each; n = 16 animals). A free myocutaneous gracilis flap taken from the groin was then transplanted to the neck in all rats. The time interval between operation and transplantation was 4 weeks. Eight animals received 1 micro g anti-TGF-beta(1) into the graft bed by intradermal injection on days 1-7 after surgery. On days 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120, skin samples were taken from the transition area between transplant and graft bed and from the graft bed itself. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the ABC-POX method to analyze the TGF-betaR-III and E-selectin expression. Histomorphometry was performed to analyze the percentage and the area of positively stained vessels.\nA significantly higher expression of TGF-betaR-III was seen in the irradiated and anti-TGF-beta(1)-treated graft bed in comparison to the group receiving preoperative irradiation followed by transplantation alone. The percentage of TGF-betaR-III positively staining capillaries from the total amount of capillaries in the anti-TGF-beta(1)-treated graft bed was higher than in the group irradiated only. The total area of capillaries was also higher in the TGF-beta(1)-treated group.\nNeutralizing of TGF-beta(1) activity in irradiated tissue undergoing surgery leads to a higher expression of TGF-betaR-III and increased vascularization.

In the case of the alveolar ridge, a very effective technique for resolving this problem is distraction osteogenesis, introduced in this context about a decade ago. This technique is based on the gradual separation of a mobile but fully vascularized bone segment from the basal bone, leading to the formation of an intervening soft callus which gradually transforms to mature bone. A key researcher in the development of this technique was the Russian traumatologist Ilizarov. The present article reviews alveolar ridge distraction procedures and their clinical application.

Sonography was performed within 3 days before endoscopy. All procedures were performed by experienced examiners who were blinded to the clinical data and other results. Defined ultrasound parameters (bowel wall thickness, vascularization pattern) were used to determine a sonographic score of the activity. The degree of activity was scored from 1 (none) to 4 (high) by both ultrasound and ileocolonoscopy (pattern, extent of typical lesions). For each patient all segments of the colon and the terminal ileum were evaluated by both ultrasound and endoscopy. The weighted kappa test was used (StatXact software) for statistical analysis.\nIn total, 126 bowel segments were evaluated by both ultrasound and endoscopy. The study showed a high concordance of power Doppler sonography and ileocolonoscopy (weighted kappa by region: sigmoid colon: 0.81; transverse colon: 0.78; ascending colon: 0.75; cecum: 0.84; terminal ileum: 0.82). Highest concordance was found in the descending colon (weighted kappa: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83-0.98).\nCombination of B-mode and power Doppler sonography has a high accuracy in the determination of disease activity in Crohn's disease when compared to ileocolonoscopy.

The specific relations between cardiac arteries and veins may enable diffusible substances carried through the system of juxta-arterial cardiac veins to influence the regulation of the lumen of the coronary arteries. Arteriovenous anastomoses (6% of our 150 cases) permit direct communication between the arteries and veins bypassing the capillary circulation; it is assumed that these anastomoses prevent coagulation of blood in small veins. In cases of arterial occlusion, the myocardium is supplied by veins that allow retrograde vascularization of the myocardium. In 33% of our cases the posterior atrial branches (0.5-1.0 mm in diameter) of the coronary arteries ran through the wall of the coronary venous sinus on their way from the parent vessel, which lay in the coronary sulcus, to the left atrium. In 11% of the cases, the arterial branch that ran through the distal portion of the wall of the coronary sinus was the interatrial branch.

Due to the slow depletion of the vitamin A liver stores the pregnant rats carried to term and delivered pups under mild VAD conditions. Mothers and offspring were then kept under the same diet what resulted in a mean reduction of vitamin A plasma concentration of about 60% vs. controls during the whole experimental period. Pups were sacrificed on days 4, 10 and 21 and their lungs fixed and analyzed by means of a combined morphologic and morphometric investigation at light and electron microscopic levels.\nDuring the whole experiment, body weights of VAD animals were lower than controls with a significant decrease on day 10. On days 4, 10 and 21 the pulmonary structure was in a comparable gross morphologic state in both groups. Despite this morphologic normality, quantitative alterations in some functional parameters could be detected. On day 4, lung volume and the volume and surface area of air spaces were decreased, while the arithmetic mean barrier thickness and type 2 pneumocyte volume were increased in the VAD group. On day 21, some changes were again manifest mainly consisting in an augmentation of the vascularization and a decrease in interstitial volume in deficient animals.\nMild VAD causes no gross disturbances in the postnatal phases of lung development in rats. However, a body weight-related transient retardation of lung maturation was detectable in the first postnatal week. At 3 weeks, the VAD lungs showed a more mature vascular system substantiated by an increase in volume of both capillary volume and the large non-parenchymal vessels.

Type II flaps consisting of anterolateral thigh flap and anteromedial thigh flap supplied by separate branches from a single vascular source were elevated in 2 cases. Type III flaps, in which two anterior thigh flaps were harvested separately and constructed into a single flap with microvascular anastomosis, were elevated in 2 cases.

EDD has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, is involved in regulation of the DNA damage response, and may control hedgehog signaling, but a definitive biological role has yet to be established. To investigate the role of Edd in vivo, gene targeting was used to generate Edd knockout (Edd(Delta/Delta)) mice. While heterozygous mice had normal development and fertility, no viable Edd-deficient embryos were observed beyond E10.5, with delayed growth and development evident from E8.5 onward. Failed yolk sac and allantoic vascular development, along with defective chorioallantoic fusion, were the primary effects of Edd deficiency.

We have reported previously that CP2-null mice are viable with no obvious abnormality. LBP-1a provides redundant function in this context. We show here that mice lacking LBP-1a expression develop intrauterine growth retardation at embryonic day 10.5, culminating in death 1 day later. No focal intraembryonic cause for this CP2-independent defect is evident. In contrast, a significant reduction in the thickness of the labyrinthine layer of the placenta is observed in LBP-1a(-/-) animals. However, expression of trophoblast differentiation markers is unperturbed in this context, and complementation studies utilizing tetraploid wild-type cells failed to rescue or ameliorate the LBP-1a(-/-) phenotype, excluding a primary trophoblast defect. An explanation for these observations is provided by the prominent angiogenic defect observed in the mutant placentas.

{"title": "Recent advances in experimental molecular therapeutics for malignant gliomas.", "abstract": "The current lack of effective therapy for malignant gliomas has prompted the development of three primary foci of molecular research: anti-angiogenesis therapy, immunotherapy, and DNA- and RNA-based therapies. Angiogenesis inhibitors, designed to exploit the highly vascularized nature of gliomas, target endothelial cells and/or the extracellular matrix and bypass many of the problems of conventional chemotherapy. There may be easy access to the molecular target (e.g. blood vessels), reduced induction of drug resistance, and general lack of host toxicity. The relatively immunoprivileged status of the brain has also prompted use of immune stimulation as an anti-glioma strategy. Lines of attack include global cytokine therapy, vaccination with specific tumor antigens, dosing with monoclonal antibodies conjugated to radioisotopes or toxins, and ex vivo priming of lymphocytes. With regard to DNA- and RNA-based therapy, numerous oncogenic proteins have been targeted by antisense molecules administered alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy and radiation. In one tactic, termed \"suicide\" gene therapy, herpes simplex thymidine kinase has been transfected into glioma cells via a retrovirus; subsequent introduction of ganciclovir causes cytotoxicity in the transduced cells.

In the pituitary, unlike other tissues, vascularization is lower in adenomas compared to the normal gland. Despite this finding, a relationship between increased vascularity and some aspects of tumour behaviour such as size, invasiveness, surgical outcome and malignancy, has been demonstrated. The process of angiogenesis is the result of a balance of stimulating and inhibiting factors. It is likely that an interaction between gene expression (such as pituitary tumour transforming gene), hormonal stimuli including oestrogens, corticosteroids, dopamine, 16-kDa fragments of prolactin and growth hormone, somatostatin analogues, and pro- and anti-angiogenic growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor), determine the final angiogenic phenotype of pituitary tumours, and thus subsequent tumour behaviour.", "journal": "Frontiers of hormone research", "date": "2004-07-30", "authors": ["N Garciade la Torre", "J A HWass", "H ETurner"], "doi": "10.1159/000079042"}
{"title": "Excurrent duct system of the male turtle Chrysemys picta.", "abstract": "The epididymis and efferent duct system of the turtle Chrysemys picta were examined. Seminiferous tubules are drained by a series of ducts that form a rete exterior to the tunica albuginea. The rete is located lateral to the testis and consists of anastamosing tubules of varying diameters, lined by a simple epithelium consisting of squamous to cuboidal cells. The rete is highly vascularized. A series of tubules (efferent ductules) connect the rete to the epididymis proper. The efferent ductules are highly convoluted, running between the epididymal tubules and are of varying diameters. The simple columnar epithelium lining these tubules possesses tight junctions, with every third or fourth cell possessing long cilia that protrude into the lumen. The cytoplasm of these epithelial cells contains abundant mitochondria. In the central portion of the efferent ductule, epithelial cells possess granules that appear to be secreted into the lumen by an apocrine process. The epididymis proper is a single, long, highly convoluted tubule that receives efferent ductules along its entire length. It is lined by a pseudostratified epithelium containing several cell types. The most abundant cell (vesicular cell) lacks cilia, but has a darkly staining apical border due to numerous small vesicles immediately beneath the luminal membrane. The small vesicles appear to fuse with each other basally to form larger vesicles. These cells appear to have an absorptive function, and occasionally sperm are embedded in their cytoplasm. The second-most abundant cell is a basal cell found along the basement membrane. The number of these cells fluctuates throughout the year, being most abundant in late summer and early fall. A small narrow cell with an oval nucleus and darkly staining cytoplasm, extending from the basement membrane to the apical surface, is present in small numbers, particularly in the caudal regions of the epididymis. This cell is frequently found in association with another narrow cell having a rounded nucleus and abundant mitochondria in its cytoplasm.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2004-07-29", "authors": ["Hilary JHolmes", "Daniel HGist"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10251"}
{"title": "Reduction of adhesions with composite AlloDerm/polypropylene mesh implants for abdominal wall reconstruction.", "abstract": "Ventral hernia repair often includes the use of structural prosthetic materials, such as polypropylene mesh, that can induce dense abdominal adhesions to peritoneal structures. AlloDerm (LifeCell Corp., Branchburg, N.J.), a commercially available decellularized human dermal analogue with its native basement membrane components intact, is gradually revascularized and replaced with autologous tissue after implantation. The authors hypothesized that AlloDerm integrated with polypropylene mesh would reduce adhesions and provide a biodegradable scaffold to generate an autologous vascularized tissue layer separating the abdominal viscera from the mesh. Ventral hernia defects (3 x 1 cm) in 19 guinea pigs were repaired using an inlay technique with polypropylene mesh alone (n = 6) or with composite implants constructed by integrating polypropylene mesh and AlloDerm with its basement membrane surface oriented toward (polypropylene/AlloIn, n = 7) or away from (polypropylene/ AlloOut, n = 6) the peritoneal cavity. At 4 weeks, the authors determined the amount of mesh implant surface area covered by adhesions, the strength of the adhesions [graded from 0 (none) to 3], and the incidence of bowel adhesions. Histologic analyses were performed on full-thickness tissue sections from the repair sites. The mean surface areas affected by adhesions and mean adhesion strength were significantly lower in the polypropylene/AlloIn (area, 12.4 percent; mean grade, 1.0) and polypropylene/AlloOut (area, 9.5 percent; mean grade, 0.5) groups than in the polypropylene group (area, 79.5 percent; mean grade, 2.9); there were no such differences between the polypropylene/AlloIn and polypropylene/AlloOut groups. The bowel was adherent to 67 percent of polypropylene repairs and 0 percent of the composite mesh repairs. The AlloDerm was remodeled to form a vascularized tissue layer beneath the mesh in composite repairs, unlike the significantly thinner, dense scar layer that formed in the polypropylene repairs. Immunohistochemical labeling for factor VIII showed neovascularization throughout the AlloDerm. The AlloDerm thus functioned as a biodegradable tissue scaffold, guiding the formation of a thick, well-vascularized tissue layer separating the polypropylene mesh from intraperitoneal structures. This significantly reduced both the amount of surface area covered by adhesions and adhesion strength. Basement membrane orientation had no effect. Composite mesh implants composed of structural prosthetic materials integrated with AlloDerm may have useful clinical applications for abdominal wall reconstruction by reducing adhesions and providing a vascularized tissue layer to separate and protect the peritoneal structures from polypropylene mesh fibers.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-07-28", "authors": ["Charles EButler", "Victor GPrieto"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000132670.81794.7e"}

The postnatal differentiation of pericytes and arteriolar and venous SMCs followed with distinct intermediate phenotypes. SMC differentiation coincided with selection of major vessels from the primordial capillary bed. Maturation of radial arteriolar SMCs was indicated by the expression of calponin and caldesmon, proteins that play a role in the regulation of SMC contraction. The mere presence of immature mural cells did not confer vessel stability; rather vessel stability in the developing rat retina coincided with caldesmon and calponin expression in arteriolar SMCs.\nThis normative data and the identification of suitable in vivo markers of pericytes and SMCs will allow meaningful interpretation of the changes in these cell types. When examining the role of mural cells in developmental and pathologic vascularization, the results show that there is a need to use multiple-marker immunohistochemistry because of significant mural cell heterogeneity. The observation that the expression of caldesmon and calponin in arteriolar SMCs coincides with resistance to hyperoxia in the developing rat retina, lead us to suggest that maturation of SMCs and their consequent ability to regulate blood flow may play a key role in vessel stabilization.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2004-07-28", "authors": ["SuzanneHughes", "TailoiChan-Ling"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.03-1312"}

IL-12p70, a cytokine produced mainly by DC and macrophages, consists of two subunits, p40 and p35. IL-12p70 is an activator of T cells, while the IL-12p40 subunit serves as a natural antagonist for IL-12p70 action. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of IL-12p40 gene-modification on both the T-cell stimulatory activity of immature DC (imDC) and their ability to prolong cardiac allograft survival. IL-12p40 gene-modified imDC (DC-p40) exhibited a phenotype characteristic of imDC and displayed impaired T-cell allostimulatory ability in vitro. However, to our surprise, for murine vascularized heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT), administration of donor-derived DC-p40 7 days prior to transplantation did not prolong allograft survival but instead significantly exacerbated cardiac allograft rejection. Further study showed that DC-p40 augmented NK cell activity both in vitro and in vivo and enhanced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in vivo, which might be due to the increased IL-23 production by DC-p40. Our data suggested that although IL-12p40 gene-modified immature DC can induce T cell hyporesponsiveness in vitro, their ability to activate NK cells and induce IFN-gamma production counterbalances this, exacerbating cardiac allograft rejection. The unexpected effects of DC-p40 limit their value in promoting allograft survival in vivo and likely reflect the complexity of IL-12p40 biology.", "journal": "Immunology letters", "date": "2004-07-28", "authors": ["WenjiSun", "XiaoboHe", "ZhenhongGuo", "QuanxingWang", "XiaokangLi", "JaneRayner", "LihuangZhang", "JianliWang", "XuetaoCao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.imlet.2004.05.001"}

However, brain in vivo is a vascularized tissue, and there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of perfusion on brain mechanical properties. Furthermore, mechanical properties are often extracted from preconditioned tissue, and it remains unclear if these properties are representative of non-preconditioned tissue. We present non-preconditioned (NPC) and preconditioned (PC) relaxation responses of porcine brain (N = 10) obtained in vivo, in situ and in vitro, at anterior, mid and posterior regions of the cerebral cortex during 4mm indentations at either 3 or 1 mm/s. Material property characteristics showed no dependency on the site tested, thus revealing that cortical gray matter on the parietal and frontal lobes can be considered homogenous. In most cases, preconditioning decreased the shear moduli, with a more pronounced effect in the dead (in situ and in vitro) brain. For most conditions, it was found that only the long-term time constant of relaxation (tau > 20 s) significantly decreased from in vivo to in situ modes (p < 0.02), and perfusion had no effect on any other property.

Chondrocyte-seeded copolymer constructs and scaffolds alone were each implanted in dorsal skin flaps of athymic mice for up to 40 weeks. Retrieved specimens were examined by histological and molecular techniques. After 10 weeks of implantation, cell-seeded constructs developed cartilage as assessed by toluidine blue and safranin-O red staining; a vascular, perichondrium-like capsule enveloped these constructs; and tissue formation resembled the auricular shape molded originally. Cartilage matrix formation increased, the capsule persisted, and initial auricular configuration was maintained through implantation for 40 weeks. The presence of cartilage production was correlated with RT-PCR analysis, which showed expression of bovine-specific type II collagen and aggrecan mRNA in cell-seeded specimens at 20 and 40 weeks. Copolymer scaffolds monitored only for 40 weeks failed to develop cartilage or a defined capsule and expressed no mRNA. Extensive vascularization led to scaffold erosion, decrease in original size, and loss of contour and shape. These results demonstrate that poly(L-lactic acid-epsilon-caprolactone) copolymer seeded with articular chondrocytes supports development and maintenance of cartilage in a human ear shape over periods to 40 weeks in this implantation model.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2004-07-22", "authors": ["NoritakaIsogai", "ShinichiAsamura", "TsuyashiHigashi", "YoshitoIkada", "ShinichiroMorita", "JenifferHillyer", "RobinJacquet", "William JLandis"], "doi": "10.1089/1076327041348527"}
{"title": "Biochemical and enzymological aspects of the symbiosis between the deep-sea tubeworm Riftia pachyptila and its bacterial endosymbiont.", "abstract": "Riftia pachyptila (Vestimentifera) is a giant tubeworm living around the volcanic deep-sea vents of the East Pacific Rise. This animal is devoid of a digestive tract and lives in an intimate symbiosis with a sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacterium. This bacterial endosymbiont is localized in the cells of a richly vascularized organ of the worm: the trophosome. These organisms are adapted to their extreme environment and take advantage of the particular composition of the mixed volcanic and sea waters to extract and assimilate inorganic metabolites, especially carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The high molecular mass hemoglobin of the worm is the transporter for both oxygen and sulfide. This last compound is delivered to the bacterium which possesses the sulfur oxidizing respiratory system, which produces the metabolic energy for the two partners. CO2 is also delivered to the bacterium where it enters the Calvin-Benson cycle. Some of the resulting small carbonated organic molecules are thus provided to the worm for its own metabolism. As far as nitrogen assimilation is concerned, NH3 can be used by the two partners but nitrate can be used only by the bacterium. This very intimate symbiosis applies also to the organization of metabolic pathways such as those of pyrimidine nucleotides and arginine. In particular, the worm lacks the first three enzymes of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways as well as some enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines. The bacterium lacks the enzymes of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. This symbiotic organization constitutes a very interesting system to study the molecular and metabolic basis of biological adaptation.", "journal": "European journal of biochemistry", "date": "2004-07-22", "authors": ["ZoranMinic", "GuyHerv\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04248.x"}
{"title": "Genomic imprinting and environment in hereditary paraganglioma.", "abstract": "Hereditary paraganglioma (PGL) is characterized by the development of slow-growing and vascularized tumors in the paraganglionic system. PGL is caused by germ line heterozygous inactivating mutations in the SDHB (PGL4), SDHC (PGL3), or SDHD (PGL1) genes, which encode three of the four subunits of mitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase; SDH). Common tumor sites include the carotid body in the neck and paraganglia in the abdomen. The risk of tumor development associated with SDHD mutations is determined by the sex of the transmitting parent, because only a paternal transmission leads to tumorigenesis in the progeny. This transmission pattern suggests operation of genomic imprinting on the SDHD gene. There is also evidence that the risk of tumor development increases at higher altitudes among SDHD mutation carriers. Accordingly, the increased prevalence of SDHD mutations in the Netherlands, attributable to multiple founder mutations, has been explained in part by the low altitudes in this country, which presumably reduce gene penetrance and relax the natural selection. Thus, PGL caused by SDHD mutations represents an unusual example of an inherited monogenic tumor syndrome because the risk of tumorigenesis shows an absolute dependence on the sex of the transmitting parent and may be modified by a ubiquitous environmental factor.", "journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

Using intravital microscopy angiogenesis, leukocyte-endothelium interaction and mineralization were assessed for 12 days.\nAngiogenesis occurred at 32 hours in M18, but not before 57 hours in M16 (p = 0.002), with perfusion of these vessels at 42 hours (p = 0.005) and 65 hours (p = 0.1), respectively. Vessels reached a density three times as high as that of the recipient site at day 6, remaining constant until day 12 in M18, whereas in M16 vascular density increased from day 6 and reached that of M18 at day 12 (p = 0.04). Leukocyte-endothelium interaction showed sticker counts elevated by a factor of 4-5 in M18 as compared to M16. Mineralization of osteochondral grafts did not differ between M16 and M18, which significantly increased in both groups throughout the observation period.\nWe propose the faster kinetics in the angiogenic response to M18 and the elevated counts of sticking leukocytes to rest on the potential of establishing end-to-end anastomoses (inosculation) of the vascularized graft with recipient vessels.", "journal": "Acta orthopaedica Scandinavica", "date": "2004-07-21", "authors": ["Dominique ARothenfluh", "Thomas JDemhartner", "Christian RFraitzl", "Marco GCecchini", "ReinholdGanz", "MichaelLeunig"], "doi": "10.1080/00016470410001330"}

The inferior labial artery was derived from the facial artery or superior labial artery, and ran through the submucous tissue horizontally. The horizontal labiomental artery arising from the facial artery was located between the depressor labii inferioris muscle and orbicularis oris muscle. The vertical labiomental artery arose from the submental artery. These three arteries provided small vessels that traversed vertically. These small vessels and the small branches of the facial artery, that run superficial and deep to the orbicularis oris muscle, formed a vascular network in subcutaneous and submucous tissues and minute vessels branched off to the skin, mucosa, and muscles.", "journal": "Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery", "date": "2004-07-21", "authors": ["KenichiroKawai", "NobuakiImanishi", "HideoNakajima", "SadakazuAiso", "MasaoKakibuchi", "KoHosokawa"], "doi": "10.1080/02844310310019068"}
{"title": "Hemorheology and vascular control mechanisms.", "abstract": "Blood rheology is a well-known determinant of tissue perfusion and, according to the Poiseuille relation, hemodynamic resistance in a constant-geometry vascular network is directly proportional to blood viscosity. However, this direct relationship cannot be observed in all in vivo studies. Further, there are several reports indicating marked differences between the in vivo and ex vivo flow properties of blood. These differences can be explained, in large part, by considering special hemorheological mechanisms (e.g., Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect, axial migration) that are of importance in the microcirculation. Additionally, the influence of altered rheological properties of blood and its components on vascular control mechanisms requires consideration: (1) There is an indirect relation between blood rheology and microvascular tone that is mediated by tissue oxygenation, with a compensatory vasodilation occurring if tissue perfusion is impaired due to hemorheological deterioration; (2) Blood rheology may influence vascular tone through alterations of wall shear stress, which in turn determines endothelial generation of vasoactive substances (e.g., nitric oxide). This latter point is of particular relevance to the field of clinical hemorheology, since enhanced red blood cell aggregation has been shown to affect nitric oxide synthesis and thus control of vascular smooth muscle tone. Such multiple pathways by which hemorheological changes can affect vascular resistance help to explain the continuing difficulty of predicting correlations between in vivo and ex vivo hemorheological behavior; they also suggest the need for continued experimental studies in this area.", "journal": "Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation", "date": "2004-07-20", "authors": ["Oguz KBaskurt", "OzlemYalcin", "Herbert JMeiselman"], "doi": null}

Its symptoms include reduced fertility and severe pelvic pain. Mechanisms that maintain the ectopic growths and evoke symptoms are poorly understood. One factor not yet considered is that the ectopic growths develop their own innervation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the growths develop both an autonomic and a sensory innervation. We used a rat model of surgically induced ENDO whose growths mimic those in women. Furthermore, similar to women with ENDO, such rats exhibit reduced fertility and increased pelvic nociception. The ENDO was induced by autotransplanting, on mesenteric cascade arteries, small pieces of uterus that formed vascularized cysts. The cysts and healthy uterus were harvested from proestrous rats and immunostained using the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 and specific markers for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (sensory C and A delta fibers), substance P (SP) (sensory C and A delta fibers) and vesicular monoamine transporter (sympathetic fibers). Cysts (like the uterus) were robustly innervated, with many PGP9.5-stained neurites accompanying blood vessels and extending into nearby luminal epithelial layers. CGRP-, SP-, and vesicular monoamine transporter-immunostained neurites also were observed, with CGRP and SP neurites extending the furthest into the cyst lining. These results demonstrate that ectopic endometrial growths develop an autonomic and sensory innervation.

However, the proangiogenic activity of TRAIL was not mediated by endogenous expression of VEGF.

{"title": "The structure of the human semilunar plica at different stages of its development--a morphological and morphometric study.", "abstract": "In this study development of the semilunar plica was examined histologycally by making sections through the eyes of eleven foetuses at different stages of gestation, two newborns and an old man. We found that in the early stages of its development the semilunar fold covered a bigger part of the orbit and later did not keep up with the growth of the eyeball and the lids. In its development three different kinds of germinal glands could be seen in the semilunar plica. Beside poorly differentiated buds of the surface epithelium which can be classified as rudiments of the nictitating or Harderian gland, serous glands were detected which could be beginnings of Krause's glands. Additionally, a new kind of plica gland was identified in which ductular structures, with an onion skin appearance, could be discriminated from mucous acini. The surface of the plica developed slowly by an increase in the layers of its epithelium as well as by the maturation of the epithelial cells from a two-layered cuboidal to a multi-layered cylindrical epithelium. In general the palpebral side of the plica consisted of a higher number of epithelial layers and more goblet cells than its bulbar side. Moreover, the surface of the palpebral side appeared more irregular and enlarged by numerous pleatings of its epithelium. The initially loose mesenchymal connective tissue was soon condensed by firstly an increase of the number of cells and later by an increase in the fibre density. In the tight collagenous connective tissue no elastic or reticular fibres or cartilaginous structures could be found. Very dense vascularization of the plica semilunaris was seen early in development. The blood vessels rising from the root of the plica divided themselves into a central and a subepithelial vascular net. Later on, some of them showed an enlarged lumen and were covered by a thin layer of muscle cells. A few unmyelinated neurofibres were found next to blood vessels and glands. Muscle cells could not be detected. A very dense concentration of leukocytes in the plica even in early intrauterine development was very striking and could be observed in this kind for the first time. These were mostly lymphoplasmocytic elements but granulocytes and macrophages could also be seen around the blood vessels and in the subepithelial area where they were arranged as follicles. Some of these cells even passed through the epithelium and could be found in the conjunctival fissure. The discovery of dense infiltration with both specific and non-specific immune cells, abundant vascularization and secretory structures (goblet cells and surface enlargement) in the semilunar plica suggest that it plays an important role as a specialized organ in human eye protection.

{"title": "VEGF-R2 and neuropilin-1 are involved in VEGF-A-induced differentiation of human bone marrow progenitor cells.", "abstract": "Tumor growth and metastasis require the generation of new blood vessels, a process known as neo-angiogenesis. Recent studies have indicated that early tumor vascularization is characterized by the differentiation and mobilization of human bone marrow cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is one of the growth factors, which enhances their differentiation into endothelial cells, but little is known about the implication of the VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinases and about the implication of the VEGF-R co-receptor, neuropilin-1, in this process. In this context, the identification of the molecular pathways that support the proliferation and differentiation of vascular stem and progenitor cells was investigated in order to define the pharmaceutical targets involved in tissue vascularization associated with this process. For this purpose, an in vitro model of differentiation of human bone marrow AC133+ (BM-AC133+) cells into vascular precursors was used. In this work, we have demonstrated for the first time that the effect of VEGF-A on BM-AC133+ cells relies on an early action of VEGF-A on the expression of its tyrosine kinase receptors followed by an activation of a VEGF-R2/neuropilin-1-dependent signaling pathway. This signaling promotes the differentiation of BM-AC133+ cells into endothelial precursor cells, followed by the proliferation of these differentiated cells. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that VEGF inhibitors, acting at the level of VEGF-R2 and/or neuropilin-1, by inhibiting differentiation and proliferation of these cells, could be potentially active compounds to prevent progenitor cells to be involved in tumor angiogenesis leading to tumor growth.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2004-07-16", "authors": ["PierreFons", "Jean-PascalHerault", "NathalieDelesque", "Jo\u0113lTuyaret", "Fran\u00e7oiseBono", "Jean-MarcHerbert"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.20076"}
{"title": "The relationship between hypoxia and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Recent studies have generated a large amount of data supporting the hypothesis that hypoxia drives tumor angiogenesis. The relationship between the two is often considered a matter of supply and demand: ineffectively-vascularized tumor tissue becomes hypoxic, stimulating neoangiogenesis to improve the influx of oxygen, thereby diminishing the angiogenic drive. Although this paradigm is logically pleasing, much of what is known about tumor biology argues against such a straightforward relationship. In fact, some preclinical data convincingly shows that tumor hypoxia and angiogenesis do not always go hand in hand. It is important to begin to explore means of reconciling these discrepancies. Although poor oxygenation is a strong stimulus for tumor angiogenesis, (1) the pathogenesis of tumor hypoxia is much more complicated than the supply-demand paradigm lets on and (2) hypoxia is not necessarily sufficient or necessary for neovascularization to occur. These subtleties may help to explain why so much data disagrees with the current hypoxia-angiogenesis model and may begin to build a better understanding of the role hypoxia plays in tumor vascularization.

It is particularly suitable for intercalary or resection arthrodesis options. In the present series, a surgical reconstruction algorithm was used, enabling each patient to receive a personalized technique. During the years 1998 to 2002, 30 patients underwent limb-sparing surgery for long bone sarcoma. There were 18 males and 12 females. Their mean age was 23 years (range, 9 to 70 years). The diagnoses were Ewing's sarcoma (11 patients), osteogenic sarcoma (eight patients), chondrosarcoma (five patients), giant cell tumor of bone (three patients), high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma (two patients), and leiomyosarcoma of bone (one patient). The majority of tumors where located in the lower extremity (23 patients), mostly in the femur (15 patients with four tumors in the proximal femoral shaft, five tumors in the distal femoral shaft, five tumors in the whole femoral shaft, and one tumor in the proximal femoral head). In seven patients, the upper extremity was involved; in six patients, the radius was involved; and in one patient, the humerus was involved. The free fibula flap was used in three types of approaches: vascularized fibula as an osseous flap only (18 patients), a combination of a vascularized fibula flap in conjunction with an allograft (Capanna's technique; 10 patients), and a free double-barreled fibula (two patients). All flaps survived. Postoperatively, all patients were monitored clinically, radiologically, and by radioisotope bone scan studies. Callus formation and union were shown 2.6 to 8 months postoperatively. Patients who underwent lower extremity reconstruction were nonweightbearing for 3 to 9 months, with a transition period in which they used a brace and gradually increased weightbearing until full weightbearing was achieved. Eight patients had 11 recipient-site complications. Two patients (6.7 percent) had hematomas, and three patients (10 percent) had infection and dehiscence of the surgical wound with bone exposure in one patient; all complications resolved with conservative treatment only. Failure of the hardware fixation system occurred in two patients, mandating surgical correction. No fibula donor-site complications were recorded. In intercalary resections, the use of the vascularized fibula flap as an isolated osseous flap might be insufficient. Different body sites have different stress loads to carry, depending on the age of the patient and on his individual physical status. To achieve initial strength in the early period, the authors combined the free fibula flap with an allograft (Capanna's method) or augmented it as a double-barreled fibula. They propose a surgical algorithm to assist the surgeon with the preferred method for reconstruction of various long bone defects in different body locations at childhood or adulthood. Long bone reconstruction using a vascularized fibula flap, alone or in combination with an allograft, autogenous bone graft, or double-barreled fibula for limb-sparing surgery, is a safe and reliable method with a predictable bony union, good functional outcome, and a low complication rate.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-07-16", "authors": ["ArikZaretski", "AharonAmir", "IsaacMeller", "DavidLeshem", "YehudaKollender", "YoavBarnea", "JacobBickels", "ThomasShpitzer", "DeanAd-El", "EyalGur"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000122213.82011.c5"}

Furthermore, the existing scar assessment scales appear to attach little weight to the opinion of the patient. The newly developed Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale consists of two numeric scales: the Patient Scar Assessment Scale (patient scale) and the Observer Scar Assessment Scale (observer scale). The patient and observer scales have to be completed by the patient and the observer, respectively. The patient scale's consistency and the observer scale's consistency, reliability, and feasibility were tested. For the Vancouver Scar Scale, which is the most frequently used scar assessment scale at present, the same statistical measurements were examined and the results of the observer scale and the Vancouver scale were compared. The concurrent validity of the observer scale was tested with a correlation to the Vancouver scale. Furthermore, the authors examined which specific characteristics significantly influence the general opinion of the patient and the observers on the scar areas. Four independent observers have each used the observer scale and the Vancouver scale to assess 49 burn scar areas of 3 x 3 cm belonging to 20 different patients. Subsequently, the patients completed the patient scale for their scar areas. The (internal) consistency of both the patient and the observer scales was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha, 0.76 and 0.69, respectively), whereas the consistency of the Vancouver scale appeared not to be acceptable (alpha, 0.49). The reliability of the observer scale completed by a single observer was acceptable (r = 0.73). The reliability of the Vancouver scale completed by a single observer was lower (r = 0.69). The observer scale showed better agreement than the Vancouver scale because the coefficient of variation was lower (18 percent and 22 percent, respectively). The concurrent validity of the observer scale in relation to the Vancouver scale is high (r = 0.89, p < 0.001). Linear regression of the general opinions on scars of the observer and the patient showed that the observer's opinion is influenced by vascularization, thickness, pigmentation, and relief, whereas the patient's opinion is mainly influenced by itching and the thickness of the scar. Such an impact of itching and thickness of the scar on the patient's opinion is an important and novel finding.

{"title": "Contemporary skull base reconstruction.", "abstract": "Tumors of the skull base that would have been considered inoperable thirty or forty years ago are now routinely resected with reliable results due to the advancement of modern reconstructive techniques. High mortality rates were common prior to the use of vascularized tissue for skull base repair. However, the advent of local flap reconstruction for skull base defects in the 1960s revolutionized skull base surgery. The use of regional flaps in the 1970s and 1980s allowed skull base surgeons to perform more extensive surgeries, but complication rates were still quite high.\nExperience with free tissue reconstruction increased through the 1980s and 1990s and has become a reliable method to separate the intracranial from extracranial environments. Free tissue transfer has allowed surgeons to address the large volume defects created by extensive skull base resections and has provided dependable, vascularized tissue that is relatively resistant to adjuvant radiation. Local flaps have also become a powerful reconstructive tool in conjunction with free tissue transfer, and in some select cases, may be sufficient alone for reconstruction.\nThe prevention of serious complications after skull surgery has improved with the use of vascularized tissue. Depending on the anatomic site, the extent of the defect, and the quality of local tissues, either free tissue transfer and/or local flap reconstruction is preferred. Regional flap reconstruction should be reserved for cases where alternative reconstructive techniques are not available.", "journal": "Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery", "date": "2004-07-15", "authors": ["Jeffrey SMoyer", "Douglas BChepeha", "Theodoros NTeknos"], "doi": "10.1097/01.moo.0000131445.27574.be"}

Numerous advances in microsurgical technique, plating technology and instrumentation, and an understanding of donor site angiosomes have made consistent and reliable mandibular reconstruction possible. Refinements in technique continue to improve the functional and aesthetic outcomes of oromandibular reconstruction. This review discusses the current state-of-the-art techniques for mandibular reconstruction and highlights the latest innovations in technique.\nThe most common indication for oromandibular reconstruction remains ablative surgery for advanced neoplastic processes of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Reconstruction of these complex three-dimensional composite bony and soft-tissue defects is paramount for rehabilitation of form and function. Vascularized osseous free tissue transfer is the state-of-the-art for mandibular reconstruction. The long-term excellent functional and aesthetic outcomes of this technique have recently been reported. The most commonly used free flaps for mandibular reconstruction are the fibula, iliac crest, and scapula. Each of these typically accepts endosseous implants improving functional outcomes. The use of mandibular reconstruction plates and coverage with a soft-tissue flap remains a reconstructive option for selected patients. The latest refinements in technique include temporary intraoperative external fixation, the use of periosteal free flaps, distraction osteogenesis, and development of biodegradable biopolymer scaffolds for mandibular defects.\nOromandibular reconstruction, although a challenge for the head and neck reconstructive surgeon, is now reliable and highly successful with excellent long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes.", "journal": "Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery", "date": "2004-07-15", "authors": ["Ritvik PMehta", "Daniel GDeschler"], "doi": "10.1097/01.moo.0000131444.50445.9d"}

Autologous vascularized epiphyseal transfer is the only possible procedure that can meet both requirements.\nBetween 1993 and 2002, six patients with a mean age of 8.4 years (range, six to eleven years) who had a malignant bone tumor in the distal part of the radius underwent microsurgical reconstruction of the distal part of the radius with a vascularized proximal fibular transfer, including the physis and a variable length of the diaphysis. All of the grafts were supplied by the anterior tibial vascular network. The rate of survival and bone union of the graft, the growth rate per year, the ratio between the lengths of the ulna and the reconstructed radius, and the range of motion of the wrist were evaluated for five of the six patients who had been followed for three years or more.\nThe mean duration of follow-up of the six patients was 4.4 years (range, eight months to nine years). All six transfers survived and united with the host bone within two months postoperatively. The five patients who were followed for three years or more had consistent and predictable longitudinal growth. Serial radiographs revealed remodeling of the articular surface. The functional result was rated as excellent for all but one patient, in whom the distal part of the ulna had also been resected because of neoplastic involvement. No major complication occurred at the recipient site, whereas a peroneal nerve palsy occurred at the donor site in three patients. The palsy was transient in two patients, but it persisted in one. No instability of the knee joint was observed.\nAfter radical resection of the distal part of the radius because of a neoplasm in children, vascularized proximal fibular transfer, based on the anterior tibial artery, permits a one-stage skeletal and joint reconstruction, provides excellent function, and minimizes the discrepancy between the distal radial and ulnar lengths.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

The constructs implanted into the omenta of adult rats were harvested for examination at designated times. Nine rats underwent a second operation for anastomosis.\nThe constructs resulted in cyst-like formations showing vascularized tissue with neomucosa lining the lumen. The surface morphology as assessed using scanning electron microscopy was similar to that of a native stomach. Immunohistochemical staining for alpha-actin smooth muscle and gastric mucin indicated the presence of a smooth muscle layer and a well-developed gastric epithelium, respectively. The luminal surface of the anastomosed tissue-engineered stomach was well-covered with epithelium.\nEpithelium-derived stomach organoid units seeded on biodegradable polymers and transplanted into donor rats were shown to vascularize, survive, and regenerate into complex tissue resembling native stomach.

{"title": "Ovarian follicle vascularization in fasted pig.", "abstract": "The authors have investigated in the different classes of ovarian follicles the vascular area, the blood vessel distribution, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression and the VEGF secretion during equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) induced follicle growth in prepubertal gilts fed ad libitum or fasted. Immunohistochemistry staining of Von Willebrand factor showed that fasting caused a dramatic increase in the vascular area of medium-large tertiary follicles. The increase involved the two concentric vessel networks and the area between them that, becoming crossed by several anastomosis, modified the whole vessel architecture. Both in situ hybridization and in vitro culture experiments demonstrate that granulosa cells from medium-large follicles are engaged in a copious VEGF production upon eCG stimulation both in gilts fed ad libitum or fasted. More surprisingly, the production of VEGF becomes diffuse amongst theca cells of fasted animals thus recruiting a compartment that in condition of normal feeding regimen appears nearly quiescent. In conclusion, the data presented describe a local angiogenic process that develops in the follicle wall of growing antral follicle in case of acute severe food restriction.

Because CSS lack a vascular plexus, they vascularize more slowly than split-thickness autografts. Previously, CSS were prepared with dermal microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), which formed vascular analogs at a low frequency but did not contribute to increased vascularization after grafting. The present study addressed whether keratinocytes genetically modified to overexpress vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen, could improve the persistence and organization of ECs in CSS. CSS were prepared with control or VEGF-modified keratinocytes, with (CSS + ECs) or without added ECs, and were grafted to full-thickness wounds in athymic mice. Elevated VEGF expression was detected in VEGF-modified CSS and CSS + ECs compared with controls, but no significant difference in EC density in vitro was observed. After grafting, VEGF-modified CSS and CSS + ECs showed enhanced vascularization, and organization of human ECs into multicellular structures in CSS + ECs was observed. However, VEGF overexpression did not significantly enhance the proliferation of human ECs, suggesting that other factors may be required.

{"title": "Targeting angiogenesis for mammary cancer prevention: factors to consider in experimental design and analysis.", "abstract": "An experimental model developed to investigate premalignant stages of breast cancer was used to establish a rationale for designing experiments that target angiogenesis for cancer prevention. Blood vessels were identified via CD31 immunostaining, and all vessels that occurred in a 50 microm wide region circumscribing each pathology were counted using a digital imaging technique. The blood vessel density associated with terminal end buds was unaffected by carcinogen treatment, whereas vessel density was higher in intraductal proliferations and ductal carcinoma in situ than in terminal end buds (P < 0.001) and total vascularity increased with morphologic progression. In comparison with intraductal proliferation or ductal carcinoma in situ, mammary carcinomas had higher vascular density in the tissue surrounding the cancer with a marked increase in the number of blood vessels <25 microm(2). These data suggest that antiangiogenic chemopreventive agents would inhibit cancer occurrence if initiated at any premalignant stage of the carcinogenic process. Because increased vascular density observed during premalignancy could be explained by the size expansion of the lesion and its encroachment on a preexisting blood supply, by pathology-associated vessel expansion, and/or by angiogenesis, it remains to be determined if antiangiogenic agents will reduce the prevalence of premalignant lesions or cause their accumulation by blocking conversion to carcinomas. Failure to recognize the patterns of vascularization that accompany morphologic progression could limit the success of efforts to target angiogenesis for cancer prevention and lead to misinformation about how agents that affect blood vessel formation or growth inhibit the carcinogenic process.", "journal": "Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology", "date": "2004-07-13", "authors": ["Henry JThompson", "John NMcGinley", "PamelaWolfe", "Nicole SSpoelstra", "Katrina KKnott"], "doi": null}

Male chimeras and Chm+/Chm- females with paternal transmission of the mutation were viable and had photoreceptor degeneration reminiscent of human choroideremia. Here, we show that Chm-/Y males and Chm-/Chm+ females were retarded at e7.5 and died before e11.5 due to multiple defects of the extra-embryonic tissues. Mutant embryos exhibited deficiency of diploid trophoblasts associated with overabundance of giant cells. In yolk sac and placenta, severe defects in vasculogenesis were obvious. Chm-/Y males exhibited more pronounced phenotypes than Chm-/Chm+ females. The lethal genotypes could be rescued by tetraploid aggregation. Chm-/Chm+ females, but not Chm-/Y males, could also be rescued when their Chm+/Chm- mothers were mated with Mus spretus males. Backcross analysis suggested that the viability of interspecies hybrid Chm-/Chm+ females may be due to expression from the Chm allele on the M. spretus X-chromosome rather than a modifier effect.

Regeneration requires priming of hepatocytes to achieve competence for proliferation. This is the initiation phase, which is regulated by cytokines, including interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. During the subsequent proliferation, the hepatocyte population is expanded (the expansion phase), it being chiefly regulated by hepatocyte growth factor and transforming growth factor-alpha. Upon sensing of the required cell mass, the proliferation response is terminated (termination phase) and is mainly mediated by transforming growth factor-beta and activins.

Decreased tumor volumes after 6.12 and DC101 treatment correlated with increased tumor apoptosis and reduced vascularization, respectively, supporting the presence of autocrine VEGFR-1- and paracrine VEGFR-2-mediated pathways in lymphomagenesis. Inhibition of paracrine VEGF interactions (DC101) in these models was equivalent to their inhibition with rituximab. Combining DC101 with therapeutic agents (rituximab, 6.12, methotrexate) consistently improved tumor responses over those of single-agent therapy. These data support the further clinical development of VEGFR-targeted approaches for the therapy of aggressive DLBCL.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2004-07-09", "authors": ["Eunice SWang", "JulieTeruya-Feldstein", "YanWu", "ZhenpingZhu", "Daniel JHicklin", "Malcolm A SMoore"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2004-01-0226"}

{"title": "General innervation pattern and sensory corpuscles in the scapholunate interosseous ligament.", "abstract": "The scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) is biomechanically important in maintaining wrist motion and grip strength in the hand, but its possible sensory role in the dynamic muscular stability of the wrist joint has not been examined. The aim of this study was to use immunohistochemical methods to analyze the general innervation and the possible existence of sensory corpuscles in the SLIL. The ligament was excised in its entirety from 9 patients. Antibodies against the low-affinity p75 neurotrophic receptor (p75) were used to reveal sensory corpuscles as well as general innervation. Furthermore, antibodies against the general nerve marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) and the glial marker S-100 were used to additionally depict innervation and corpuscular structures. Blood vessels occurred in areas interspersed throughout the homogeneous collagenous structure. In these vascularized areas, the SLIL was found to be supplied with nerve fascicles and sensory corpuscles of both the Ruffini and lamellated type. p75 immunoreactivity (IR) was detected in association with the nerve fascicles and the corpuscles, particularly in their capsule. S-100 IR was found in the Schwann cells in the central regions of the corpuscle, and PGP 9.5 IR marked the axonal structures in the corpuscles. New information on neurotrophin receptor distribution in ligaments has been obtained here. The presence of nerve fascicles and particularly sensory corpuscles in the SLIL suggests that the ligament has a proprioceptive role in the stability of the wrist. The marked p75 IR further indicates that neurotrophins play a part in a proprioceptive system in the ligament, given the importance of neurotrophins in maintaining sensory function.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2004-07-09", "authors": ["ElisabetHagert", "Bj\u00f6rn-OveLjung", "StureForsgren"], "doi": "10.1159/000078427"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, time course and outcome of treatment of graft rejection after normal-risk PK and to identify possible risk factors for the recurrence of immune reactions and irreversible graft failure.\nThe study included 500 eyes from the prospective Erlanger Normal-risk Keratoplasty Study with a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 18 (median 40) months. Indications for PK were keratoconus in 48 %, Fuchs' dystrophy in 30 %, secondary bullous keratopathy in 11 %, non-vascularized corneal scars in 7 % and stromal dystrophies in 4 %. Standardized complete ophthalmological examinations were performed on a regular basis before, during the acute graft rejection and then regularly in a defined examination raster in an cornea out-patient service.\nDuring follow-up 29 eyes (5.6 %) developed an episode of endothelial graft rejection (23 eyes with acute diffuse and 6 eyes with chronic focal rejection type). Episodes of endothelial graft rejection clustered between 11 and 25 months postoperatively (15 from 29, 51.7 %). Most grafts (25 of 29) regained clarity after topical and systemic steroid treatment. Only 4 patients showed an irreversible graft failure requiring a repeat PK, all of whom had secondary bullous keratopathy as the primary indication for PK. Risk factors for irreversible graft failure were pre-existing anterior synechiae in 3 patients and secondary open angle glaucoma in pseudoexfoliation syndrome in one patient. Recurrence of graft rejection was seen in 5 patients (all with keratoconus) after a time interval of 8 to 12 months. Under very low topical steroid treatment no further recurrence was observed in all 5 patients up to 2 years.\nPatients should be followed-up on a regular base for longer postoperative periods, since most episodes of graft rejection were observed between 1 and 2 years after PK.

The exact function of the newly formed vessels in MM is, however, a matter of debate. It is believed that, in contrast to solid tumor growth, the bone marrow (BM) is a sufficiently vascularized organ to support expansion of the MM clone with no need for additional blood vessels. From this point of view, it could be that MM-associated angiogenesis is rather an epiphenomenon and that the newly formed microvessels form a chaotic network that does not contribute to the blood flow. We investigated whether these newly formed microvessels in MM are connected to the blood circulation. The intravenously injected ferritin 30 min prior to sacrifice was detected in 100% of the BM vessels of control mice. In MM-bearing mice, the ferritin tracer was found in 31% of the MM-associated vessels, indicating a connection with the peripheral blood circulation in these vessels.

There were no operative or postoperative complication and all the four patients had good limb function. The flap was found to be versatile as it could be used for either upper limb or lower limb and for large defects.

{"title": "Piscine islet xenotransplantation.", "abstract": "Tilapia, a teleost fish species with large anatomically discrete islet organs (Brockmann bodies; BBs) that can be easily harvested without expensive and fickle islet isolation procedures, make an excellent donor species for experimental islet xenotransplantation research. When transplanted into streptozotocin-diabetic nude or severe combined immunodeficient mice, BBs provide long-term normoglycemia and mammalian-like glucose tolerance profiles. However, when transplanted into euthymic recipients, the mechanism of islet xenograft rejection appears very similar to that of islets from \"large animal\" donor species such as the very popular fetal/neonatal porcine islet cell clusters (ICCs). Tilapia islets are more versatile than ICCs and can be transplanted (1) into the renal subcapsular space, the cryptorchid or noncryptorchid testis, or intraportally as neovascularized cell transplants; (2) as directly vascularized organ transplants; or (3) intraperitoneally after microencapsulation. Unlike the popular porcine ICCs, BBs function immediately after transplantation; thus, their rejection can be assessed on the basis of loss of function as well as other parameters. We have also shown that transplantation of tilapia BBs into nude mice can be used to study the possible implications of cross-species physiological incompatibilities in xenotransplantation. Unfortunately, tilapia BBs might be unsuitable for clinical islet xenotransplantation because tilapia insulin differs from human insulin by 17 amino acids and, thus, would be immunogenic and less biologically active in humans. Therefore, we have produced transgenic tilapia that express a \"humanized\" tilapia insulin gene. Future improvements on these transgenic fish may allow tilapia to play an important role in clinical islet xenotransplantation.", "journal": "ILAR journal", "date": "2004-07-02", "authors": ["James RWright", "BillPohajdak", "Bao-YouXu", "Joseph RLeventhal"], "doi": "10.1093/ilar.45.3.314"}

A better understanding of the biological behavior of metastatic and nonmetastatic breast tumors in older subjects may help to develop improved breast cancer therapies. In this study, we used syngeneic metastatic (4TO7cg) and nonmetastatic (64pT) mouse breast tumor models at three age levels to evaluate various characteristics that are considered to be important for effective anti-breast cancer immunotherapy. These included tumor size and growth, metastases, vascularization, gene expression levels of the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) Mage-b (homologous to human MAGE-B) in primary breast tumors and metastases, and the presence of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the inguinal lymph nodes at the site of the tumor. The primary breast tumors and metastases were generated by injection of mouse mammary tumor cell lines 4TO7cg or 64pT into a mammary fat pad of normal 3-, 9-, or 21/24-month old BALB/c mice. In the nonmetastatic breast tumor model, significantly smaller tumors were observed in old compared with young mice. This was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of CD8(+) T cells in inguinal lymph nodes and significantly higher Mage-b expression levels in the primary tumors at old age. In the metastatic (4TO7cg) breast tumor model, a less pronounced, not statistically significant, smaller tumor size was found in the old mice, without a difference in the percentage of CD8(+) T cells or Mage-b expression levels. However, in this mouse model almost all metastases showed high levels of Mage-b expression (2- to 3-fold higher than the primary tumors in the same animals) regardless of age.

The morpho-anatomical study was carried out through scanning electron and light microscopy. Nectar sugars were identified via gas chromatography. Nectar production and the effect of its removal on total nectar sugar amount were determined by using sets of bagged flowers.\nHymenopterans were visitors of most species, while hummingbirds visited I. rubriflora and sphingids I. alba. All the species had a vascularized discoidal nectary surrounding the ovary base with numerous open stomata with a species-specific distribution. All nectar samples contained amino acids and sugars. Most species had sucrose-dominant nectars. Flowers lasted a few hours. Mean nectar sugar concentration throughout the lifetime of the flower ranged from 34.28 to 39.42 %, except for I. cairica (49.25 %) and I. rubriflora (25.18 %). Ipomoea alba had the highest nectar volume secreted per flower (50.12 microL), while in the other taxa it ranged from 2.42 to 12.00 microL. Nectar secretion began as soon as the flowers opened and lasted for a few hours (in I. purpurea, I. rubriflora) or it was continuous during the lifetime of the flower (in the remaining species). There was an increase of total sugar production after removals in I. cairica, I. indica and I. purpurea, whereas in I. alba and I. rubriflora removals had no effect, and in I. hieronymi there was a decrease in total sugar production.\nThe chemical composition, production dynamics and removal effects of nectar could not be related to the pollinator guild of these species.

The development of new blood vessels in the ovary is essential to guarantee the necessary supply of nutrients and hormones to promote follicular growth and corpus luteum formation. In developing follicles, the pre-existing endothelial cells that form the vascular network in the theca layer markedly develop in response to the stimulus of several growth factors, mainly produced by granulosa cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The angiogenic factors also promote vessel permeability, thus favouring the antrum formation and the events inducing follicle rupture. After ovulation, newly formed blood vessels cross the basement membrane between theca and granulosa layers and continue a rapid growth to sustain corpus luteum development and function. The length of luteal vascular growth varies in cycling and pregnant animals and among species; both angiogenesis and subsequent angioregression are finely regulated by systemic and local factors.

Here, we investigated the role of the VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1/Flt-1) in the vascularization of 2 different experimental tumors in vivo. VEGFR-1 mutants were generated that lack the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of the VEGFR-1 mutants led to a strong reduction of tumor growth and angiogenesis in xenografted C6 glioma and in syngeneic BFS-1 fibrosarcoma. Histological analysis of the inhibited fibrosarcoma revealed reduced vascular density, decreased tumor cell proliferation as well as increased tumor cell apoptosis and the formation of necrosis. The retroviral gene transfer of the full length VEGFR-1 also caused a significant reduction of tumor growth in both models. The inhibitory effects of the VEGFR-1 mutants and the full length VEGFR-1 in BFS-1 fibrosarcoma were mediated through host tumor endothelial cells because the BFS-1 fibrosarcoma cells were not infected by the retrovirus. The formation of heterodimers between VEGFR-2 and full length or truncated VEGFR-1 was observed in vitro and might contribute to the growth inhibitory effect by modulating distinct signal transduction pathways.

The authors have found the flap to be advantageous for cranial base reconstruction and for resurfacing the face and oral cavity. The flap has been used successfully for reconstruction of traumatic upper and lower extremity defects, and it can be used as a pedicled flap or as a free tissue transfer. The perforating branches of the thoracodorsal artery offer a robust blood supply to a skin-soft-tissue paddle of 10 to 12 cm x 25 cm, overlying the latissimus dorsi muscle. The average pedicle length is 20 cm (range, 16 to 23 cm), which allows for a safe anastomosis outside the zone of injury in traumatized extremities; the flap can be made sensate by neurorrhaphy with sensory branches of the intercostal nerves. Vascularized bone can be transferred with this flap by taking advantage of the inherent vascular anatomy of the subscapular artery.

{"title": "Vascularized rib for facial reconstruction.", "abstract": "The reconstruction of maxillectomy defects is a complex problem encountered in plastic surgery. Defects can range in size and complexity from small defects requiring only soft tissue to complete maxillectomies requiring large tissue bulk, bone, and one or more skin paddles. The most difficult defects involve the skull base and orbit. The reconstructive surgeon is faced with the challenge of isolating the nasopharynx from the dura and globe while simultaneously restoring the bony framework of the maxilla and orbit to support the soft tissue of the cheek. The authors present a series of six reconstructions using a rectus abdominis muscle flap with associated vascularized rib for reconstruction of complex maxillectomy defects. This flap provides large soft-tissue bulk as well as bony support and a long vascular pedicle. A skin island can be taken with the flap, and the donor-site morbidity is comparable to that seen with a vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. Six flaps were used in five patients over a 20-month period. All patients had stable support of the orbit at follow-up with adequate soft-tissue coverage, and there were no incidences of visual changes.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-06-29", "authors": ["Steven PDavison", "James HBoehmler", "Jason CGanz", "BruceDavidson"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000127792.39150.b0"}

However, there is little information about the role of G-CSF and GM-CSF for tumor growth or progression. We were interested in the expression and potential role of both factors in human meningiomas, tumors of arachnoidal origin that account for about 20% of all primary intracranial tumors. Therefore, we analyzed immunohistochemically the protein expression of G-CSF, GM-CSF and their respective receptors in 30 meningioma tissues of different malignancy and histopathological type. Both factors and receptors were not expressed in the corresponding normal tissue. In contrast, G-CSF, GM-CSF and their receptors were expressed to a varying degree in human meningiomas. Increasing expression of both factors and receptors correlated significantly with enhanced proliferation in the tumor and thus with higher malignancy. In addition, a strong perivascular expression of G-CSF was associated with a highly vascularized tumor type. Thus, expression of both G-CSF and GM-CSF is associated with the expression of proliferation vascularization, two markers of an increasingly malignant tumor phenotype, suggesting a contribution of both factors to tumor progression.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2004-06-29", "authors": ["BernhardBraun", "ManfredLange", "ReinhardOeckler", "Margareta MMueller"], "doi": "10.1023/b:neon.0000027751.87894.f0"}

The development of selective MMPIs for tumor progression-associated MMPs is, thus, likely to offer improved therapeutic possibilities.\nThe anti-invasive capacity of a series of pyrimidine-trione derivatives was tested in vitro in a chemoinvasion assay, and the most potent compound was further evaluated in vivo in different human tumor xenograft models. The activity of this novel selective MMPI was compared with BB-94, a broad-spectrum inhibitor.\nRo-28-2653, an inhibitor with high selectivity for MMP-2, MMP-9, and membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, showed the highest anti-invasive activity in vitro. In vivo, Ro-28-2653 reduced the growth of tumors induced by the inoculation of different cell lines producing MMPs and inhibited the tumor-promoting effect of fibroblasts on breast adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, Ro-28-2653 reduced tumor vascularization and blocked angiogenesis in a rat aortic ring assay. In contrast, BB-94 up-regulated MMP-9 expression in tumor cells and promoted angiogenesis in the aortic ring assay.\nRo-28-2653, a selective and orally bioavailable MMPI with inhibitory activity against MMPs expressed by tumor and/or stromal cells, is a potent antitumor and antiangiogenic agent.

The overall postoperative complication rate was 20%; a diverticulum formed in 24 patients (9%) and in all it was repaired. Diverticulectomy was carried out by de-epithelialization of excess diverticular skin, so that two subcutaneous vascularized tissue wings could be created. After re-establishing distal urethral patency and neourethral closure, the de-epithelialized diverticular wings were folded and overlapped to form a mechanical support for the neourethral ventral wall; this procedure was termed 'pseudospongioplasty'.\nThere were no recurrences of diverticulum or any fistula formation. The only complication was urethral stenosis in two cases, which was successfully resolved by internal urethrotomy.\nRe-establishing patency and providing mechanical support are essential when repairing a urethral diverticulum.

{"title": "Periovulatory expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in the rat ovary.", "abstract": "Leukocytes, especially neutrophils and macrophages, traditional cellular regulators of the immune system, reside within the tissue architecture of the rodent and human ovary and dramatically increase in number, in response to gonadotropin, in the theca of preovulatory follicles. Evidence strongly suggests a modulatory role for leukocytes in ovarian tissue remodeling events, such as ovulation, luteinization, and luteolysis. The present study investigates the ovarian localization and potential gonadotropin regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an important factor in neutrophil and monocyte attachment to endothelium. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical detection and quantification of ICAM-1 mRNA and protein were carried out in ovaries of immature and eCG/hCG-primed rats during the periovulatory period (0, 6, 12, and 24 h post-hCG). While whole ovarian ICAM-1 mRNA levels did not vary significantly during the preovulatory period, ovarian follicles exhibited ICAM-1 mRNA and protein specifically within the thecal region, where mRNA expression increased 5-fold and protein expression increased 6-fold when comparing pre-hCG levels with those at the estimated time of ovulation (12 h post-hCG). Thecal ICAM-1 was most prevalent in highly vascularized regions as evidenced by serial staining with an endothelium-specific antibody. Granulosa layer ICAM-1 immunoactivity was acquired only during/after follicle rupture. These results show ICAM-1 is localized within the ovarian theca and its expression is associated with follicular development in periovulatory follicles, peaking in expression at the time of rupture. Additionally, ICAM-1 is expressed among granulosa-lutein cells of the ovulating follicle and developing corpus luteum. Taken together, these findings suggest rat ovarian ICAM-1 may be instrumental in the active recruitment of leukocytes into the preovulatory ovary and may have a role in corpus luteum formation.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2004-06-25", "authors": ["NigelBonello", "Melinda JJasper", "Robert JNorman"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.104.030650"}

In 10 adult sheep, critically sized defects of the calvaria were treated by gradual movement of a transport segment consisting of calvarial bone. The transport segments were either corticotomized (n = 5) or osteotomized (n = 5). The latency period was 5 days; the rate of distraction was 1 mm/d, extended for approximately 40 days. The consolidation period was 28 days. Specimens were investigated by conventional radiography, computed tomography scans, immunofluorescence, and histological examination. In both groups, transport osteogenesis resulted in a complete closure of the defect. The volume and thickness of newly formed bone at the defect site did not differ significantly between the groups, nor did the extent of vascularization. Bone formation and remodeling occurred during the entire period of distraction and consolidation. Osteotomized transport segments became smaller during distraction, whereas the volume of corticotomized segments remained relatively constant.

Previously we demonstrated that the Grp78 promoter is able to eradicate tumors using murine cells in immunocompetent models by driving expression of the HSV-tk suicide gene. Here, through the use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we provide direct evidence of spontaneous in vivo activation of the HSV-tk suicide gene driven by the Grp78 promoter in growing tumors and its activation by photodynamic therapy (PDT) in a controlled manner. In this report, we evaluated whether this promoter can be applied to human cancer therapy. We observed that the Grp78 promoter, in the context of a retroviral vector, was highly activated by stress and PDT in three different types of human breast carcinomas independent of estrogen receptor and p53. Complete regression of sizable human tumors was observed after prodrug ganciclovir treatment of the xenografts in immunodeficient mice. In addition, the Grp78 promoter-driven suicide gene is strongly expressed in a variety of human tumors, including human osteosarcoma. In contrast, the activity of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) long-terminal repeat (LTR) promoter varied greatly in different human breast carcinoma cell lines, and in some cases, stress resulted in partial suppression of the LTR promoter activity. In transgenic mouse models, the Grp78 promoter-driven transgene is largely quiescent in major adult organs but highly active in cancer cells and cancer-associated macrophages, which can diffuse to tumor necrotic sites devoid of vascular supply and facilitate cell-based therapy.

However, upper airway obstruction secondary to severe bleeding in the floor of the mouth has been occasionally reported as a rare but potentially fatal complication of implant surgery. This review presents critical hemorrhagic episodes, related to dental implantation in the anterior segments of the mandible, published to date. Massive internal bleeding in the highly vascularized region of the floor of the mouth is the result of an arterial trauma induced by instrumentation, usually through a perforation of the lingual cortical plate. Depending on the clinical situation, hemorrhage may commence immediately or with some delay after the vascular insult. The progressively expanding lingual, sublingual, submandibular, and submental hematomas have the tendency of displacing the tongue and floor of the mouth to obstruct the airway. Because the course of airway deterioration to complete occlusion may be rapid, ensuring a patent airway is of highest priority. Even though upper airway obstruction is potentially life-threatening, a secure airway was successfully established in all patients without fatal consequences. In most cases, resolution of hemorrhage required a surgical intervention for ligation of the bleeding vessels and hematoma evacuation. To reduce the probability of such a grave complication, preventive and precautionary measures to be taken before, during, and after implant placement in the anterior mandible are presented. Issues related to the level of surgical experience, fine regional arterial anatomy, radiographic and clinical evaluation of the osseous morphology, angulation and length of implants, and timing of hemorrhage onset are discussed.

PMMA leakage is a very frequent occurrence in vertebroplasty is also the main source of complications. Neurological complications are due to cement leakage into the spinal canal and less exceptionally into the intervertebral foramen. The transpedicular needle approach reduces the risk of cement leakage into the foramen. Pulmonary embolism of PMMA may occur when there is a failure to recognize venous migration of cement early during the procedure. Cortical destruction, presence of an epidural soft-tissue mass, highly vascularized lesions, and severe vertebral collapse are factors which increase the rate of complications, which is therefore much higher in metastatic than in osteoporotic vertebral collapse. Prevention of PMMA leakage-related complications is a multifactorial issue including procedure preparation, needle approach and placement, and cement application. The technical refinements which may help reduce the risk of PMMA leakage are reviewed in this article. Experimental data have shown that systemic reactions may occur during vertebroplasty in the absence of cement leakage. These reactions may be partly related to vascular embolism of bone marrow fat. Another controversial issue is a possible increase in the risk of vertebral collapse of adjacent vertebrae following vertebroplasty. Prospective randomized studies are needed to resolve this issue.", "journal": "Skeletal radiology", "date": "2004-06-19", "authors": ["J DLaredo", "BHamze"], "doi": "10.1007/s00256-004-0776-8"}

The expression of bone cell and fat cell transcription factors Cbfa1/Runx2 and PPARgamma2, were determined. Osteocalcin promoter activity was measured by co-transfecting the cells with the phOC-luc and pSV beta-Gal plasmids. Dexamethasone increased PPARgamma2 gene expression 2-fold, while Cbfa1/Runx2 gene expression and osteocalcin promoter activity decreased by 50-60%, and VEGF protein, measured by ELISA, decreased by 55%. These changes indicate enhanced adipogenesis and decreased osteogenesis by mesenchymal cells in vitro, together with a decrease in VEGF, a potent angiogeneic factor, suggesting that dexamethasone may shunt uncommitted osteoprogenitor cells in marrow from osteoblastic differentiation into the adipocytic pathway, leading to diminished vascularization and eventual osteonecrosis.", "journal": "Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA", "date": "2004-06-19", "authors": ["XudongLi", "LiJin", "QuanjunCui", "Gwo-JawWang", "GaryBalian"], "doi": "10.1007/s00198-004-1649-7"}

In two of 171 patients (1.2%), preoperative colonoscopy revealed pT1 adenocarcinomas of the colon which were completely removed by endoscopy, and a total of 62 adenomas were histopathologically diagnosed. Fifty-three patients (31%) had endoscopic evidence of asymptomatic diverticulosis. No complications were observed after colonoscopy.\nPreoperative colonoscopy prior to esophagectomy and intended gastric tube formation appears unnecessary from the surgical point of view, as intraoperative conversion to a colon interposition is rare.

SLO is known to have antitumor properties and was recently described as an inhibitor of tumor neovascularization. However, most studies did not discriminate between the respective activities of alkylglycerols and of fatty acids, which both have potent biological properties. In this work, a mouse model was used to investigate the antitumor effects of SLO and of alkylglycerols purified from the same source, both administered orally. We demonstrated that either pure alkylglycerols or SLO reduced the tumor growth in a similar manner, suggesting that alkylglycerols were involved in this effect. In alkylglycerol-treated mice, metastasis dissemination was reduced by 64 +/- 8%, whereas SLO effect was 30 +/- 9% below control. Purified alkylglycerols also decreased significantly plasmalogen content in tumors, whereas SLO had no such effect. Finally, we demonstrated that a 5-day treatment with alkylglycerols curtailed the presence in tumors of von Willebrand factor, a marker of endothelial cells. This result suggested an anti-angiogenic effect of alkylglycerols. In summary, alkylglycerols were shown to decrease the growth, vascularization, and dissemination of Lewis lung carcinoma tumors in mice.

One of the possible inducers of VEGF in tumor cells is nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesized by NO synthase and stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) in tumor cells. Here, we report that 2 of 9 human glioma cell lines, CCF-STTG1 and U-87MG, overproduced cyclic GMP (cGMP) and showed increased expression of both or either subunits of soluble GC1, GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3. Transfection of antisense GUCY1A3 or GUCY1B3 into these two glioma cell lines markedly reduced the content of cGMP and expression of VEGF. The angiogenic activity in vitro was subsequently inhibited, which was determined by induction of HUVEC cell growth. Furthermore, subcutaneous tumor formation by U-87MG cells in nude mice was dramatically suppressed to less than 0.05% in volume by transfection of either antisense GUCY1A3 or antisense GUCY1B3, which was accompanied by the significant decrease in vascular index to about 10%.

The prepuce morphology was analyzed by evaluation of the prepuce skin distribution, development and deformities. The development and course of blood vessels were analyzed using preputial illumination. According to morphology and blood supply, different types were compared.

Intravitreal membranes varied from loosely to highly organized. The extent of organization corresponded with increasing immunoreactivity for vimentin and GFAP, indicating their predominantly glial origin. They were never immunopositive for smooth muscle actin, nor were they vascularized. In all cases, they were associated with intravitreal hemorrhage. Additional common findings included epiretinal membranes, retinal neovascularization, preiridal fibrovascular membranes and glaucoma.

The following two studies investigate whether criss-crossing of regenerating rat sciatic nerve axons between tibial and peroneal nerve fascicles can be reduced by using a barrier at the coaption site. The left sciatic nerve was transected and repaired at mid-thigh as follows: epineural sutures (group A, A-II), fascicular repair of tibial and peroneal nerve fascicles (group B, B-II), fascicular repair of tibial and peroneal nerve fascicles separating the two fascicles with a pedicled fat flap (group C), Integra (group D) or non-vascularized autologous fascia (group C-II). In the control groups E and D-II, only the left tibial fascicle was transected and repaired. Four and 5 months postoperatively, the outcome of regeneration was evaluated by histology, by retrograde tracing, and by assessment of the muscle force of the gastrocnemius and tibial anterior muscles. The tracing experiments showed that specificity of muscle reinnervation significantly improved when a barrier was employed, which significantly or clearly improved muscle twitch tension in groups C and D. However, muscle contraction force was not better when fascia was used as barrier. The histological picture indicated that this inferior result in group C-II was due to nerve compression caused by fibrotic scar tissue at the site of the fascia graft. Results of this study show that a pedicle fat flap and Integra used as barrier significantly prevent aberrant reinnervation between two sutured nerve fascicles in adjacency resulting in improved motor recovery in rats.

{"title": "Fate of alphaGal +/+ pancreatic islet grafts after transplantation into alphaGal knockout mice.", "abstract": "Important phylogenetic differences between pig and human tissues prevent xenotransplantation from becoming a clinically feasible option. Humans lack the galactose-alpha1,3-galactose (alphaGal) epitope on endothelial cell surfaces and therefore have preformed anti-alphaGal antibodies. The role of these antibodies in rejection of non-vascular xenografts remains controversial. This study investigated the role of anti-alphaGal antibodies in rejection of non-vascularized alphaGal+/+ grafts in alphaGal -/- mice.\nalphaGal +/+ and alphaGal -/- pancreatic islets were transplanted under the renal capsule of streptozotocin-induced diabetic (1) alphaGal -/- mice and (2) alphaGal +/+ mice. alphaGal -/- recepients were immunized with rabbit red blood cell membranes (RRBCs) to produce elevated anti-alphaGal antibody levels.\nSix of the 18 alphaGal -/- mice rejected the alphaGal +/+ grafts within 68 days whereas indefinite graft survival was achieved in the control groups. Animals with surviving islet grafts were challenged with alphaGal +/+ skin grafts. Although all alphaGal +/+ skin grafts were rejected within 58 days, the islet grafts remained intact. This observation correlated with the level of alphaGal expression (which was very low on islets compared to skin) rather than the actual titre of anti-alphaGal antibody.\nThe results suggest that the level of alphaGal expression plays an important role in graft survival. Therefore, its removal is important in the development of a pig islet donor for future clinical therapy.", "journal": "Xenotransplantation", "date": "2004-06-16", "authors": ["Abhilash PChandra", "EvelynSalvaris", "Stacey NWalters", "LisaMurray-Segal", "HiltonGock", "Anne MLehnert", "Jeffrey K WWong", "Peter JCowan", "Anthony J Fd'Apice", "Philip JO'Connell"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1399-3089.2004.00138.x"}

The articular block is then rotated 180 degrees on the longitudinal axis of the thumb.\nAn anatomic study was performed on six fresh cadaveric upper limbs. The radial artery was injected with colored latex, 5 cm above the wrist. The peri-articular vascular network was studied. The feasibility of harvesting and rotating the articular bloc after double osteotomy of the first metacarpal basis and the trapezium was also studied.\nIn all the cases, the radial artery was present with branches supplying the peri-articular vascular network. After double osteotomy of the metacarpal base and of the trapezium, the articular bloc was harvested and rotated by 180 degrees. We describe the surgical technique.\nThe surgical technique has been confirmed with the first clinical cases. The double oblique osteotomy with rotation of the articular bloc corrects trapezium dysplasia and preserves first metacarpal abduction.

{"title": "[Vesicovaginal fistula].", "abstract": "Urinary fistula to the vagina has been described since the beginning of the written record. In developed nations, these fistulas are usually unfortunate complications of gynecologic or other pelvic surgery and radiotherapy. Historically, birth trauma accounted for most vesicovaginal fistulas, and it remains the major cause of urinary fistulas in many underdeveloped nations. Once a vesicovaginal fistula is suspected, a thorough vaginal examination should be performed to identify its size and location, especially in relation to the trigone and eliminate a ureterovaginal fistula which can be associated in up to 10% of cases. Numerous methods for the treatment of vesicovaginal fistulae have been described. Abdominal, and vaginal approaches are used for the repair of vesicovaginal fistulae. The approach selected is dependent on many factors, but is probably best determined by the experience and training of the surgeon. The techniques of the vaginal approach involve tension-free closure of the fistula with or without excision of the tract, creation of an anterior vaginal wall flap and appropriate use of vascularized interposition grafts. The abdominal approach may be used to treat all types of vesicovaginal fistulae and is the preferred approach when concomittant ureteral reimplantation is required. Postoperative care is similar for both vaginal and abdominal vesicovaginal fistula repair. Adequate uninterrupted bladder drainage is the most critical aspect of postoperative management.

{"title": "Distinct requirements for host CD80/CD86 costimulatory molecules in cardiac versus islet rejection.", "abstract": "The role of B7 family members CD80 and CD86 in providing costimulatory signals to T cells is well established. Interestingly, previous studies show that host CD80/CD86 expression is required for cardiac allograft rejection. However, the role for host costimulation by CD80/CD86 molecules for the rejection of neovascularized islet allografts and xenografts is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether islet allografts and/or rat islet xenografts required host CD80/CD86 molecules for acute rejection. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57Bl/6 (B6, H-2(b)) or B6 CD80/CD86 double-deficient mice were grafted with allogeneic BALB/c (H-2(d)) islet allografts or with WF (RT1(u)) islet xenografts. Nondiabetic B6 mice were grafted with BALB/c heterotopic cardiac allografts. Consistent with previous reports, BALB/c islet allografts were acutely rejected in wild-type B6 mice could survive long-term (>100 days) in B6 CD80/CD86-deficient animals. In stark contrast, both islet allografts and WF rat islet xenografts demonstrated acute rejection in both control B6 and in B6 CD80/CD86 deficient hosts. In conclusion, varied studies imply that the inherent pathways for rejecting primarily vascularized versus cellular allografts or xenografts may be distinct. The present study illustrates this concept by showing a marked difference in the role of host-derived CD80/CD86 costimulatory molecules for cardiac allograft versus islet allograft/xenograft rejection in vivo.

In this study, it is demonstrated that involucrin enhancer/promoter-dependent expression of human AR (INV-AR) in the suprabasal epidermis of transgenic mice also produces a cutaneous psoriasis-like phenotype. INV-AR mice possess a limited lifespan and scaling, papillomatous, erythematous skin with partial alopecia. INV-AR mouse histopathology also revealed epidermal hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, acanthosis, and an exaggerated dermal vasculature. A dermal and epidermal infiltrate was also evident and consisted of both neutrophils and CD3(+) T lymphocytes. The histology of synovial joints in both the INV-AR mice and the K14-ARGE mice of our previous investigation was examined. The histologic examination revealed that 3-week-old INV-AR transgenic mice displayed normal knee joint histology, while 2- to 3-week-old K14-ARGE transgenic mice frequently displayed synovitis, as exemplified by the presence of a mixed leukocytic infiltration, increased vascularization, and enhanced deposition of fibrous matrix in the knee synovium. These results demonstrate that AR overexpression in both the basal and suprabasal epidermis of transgenic mice induces a phenotype that mimics cutaneous psoriasis, while basal AR expression is also associated with synovial inflammation, a precursor to the psoriasis-associated arthropathy, psoriatic arthritis.

The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify a groucho homologue, Grg5, as a Runx2-interacting protein. Grg5 enhances Runx2 activity in a cell culture-based assay and by analyses of postnatal growth in mice we demonstrate that Grg5 and Runx2 interact genetically.

MRI analysis of HD has revealed a spontaneous resorption mechanism related with neo-vascularization. It appears that the interaction of activated macrophages with disc tissues leads to the generation of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is required for the induction of angiogenesis inducing factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or matrix degrading enzymes such as MMP-3, MMP-7 and plasmin. We hypothesized that these molecules play a crucial role during spontaneous HD resorption. In this study, we have examined the sequential expression of these molecules using a co-culture system which is composed of the interaction of activated macrophages and disc tissues as a model of the acute response of inflammation occurred in HD. We have also considered the mechanism of activating latent MMPs during HD resorption process. Current our results indicate that upregulation of both TNF-alpha mRNA and protein expressions occur first in the inflammation induced by HD. VEGF upregulation follows the increased level of TNF-alpha expression. Both plasmin and MMP-3 are upregulated at later time points. We also demonstrate that both TNF-alpha and VEGF induce upregulated expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Our previous work has demonstrated that TNF-alpha could upregulate the expression of VEGF, MMP-3 and MMP-7 in the co-culture system. It has been reported that plasmin could affect to activate latent MMPs. Based on these findings, we suggest that TNF-alpha acts as the initiator of inflammation following contact between macrophages and disc chondrocytes and that plasmin and u-PA play a crucial role in activation of MMPs.

The mean number of reconstructed epithelial cell layers was 1.7, 2.0, 1.85 and 2.7 at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks, respectively after transplantation (P = 0.342). Collagen IV, laminin and lectin-specific capillaries developed between the neoepithelium and the underlying muscular layer. Only two specimens showed signs of infection 2 weeks after transplantation.

{"title": "HIF activation by pH-dependent nucleolar sequestration of VHL.", "abstract": "Hypoxia and acidosis occur in a wide variety of physiological and pathological settings that include muscle stress, tumour development and ischaemic disorders. A central element in the adaptive response to cellular hypoxia is HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor), a transcription factor that activates an array of genes implicated in oxygen homeostasis, tumour vascularization and ischaemic preconditioning. HIF is activated by hypoxia, but undergoes degradation by the VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) tumour suppressor protein in the presence of oxygen. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia induction or normoxic acidosis can neutralize the function of VHL by triggering its nucleolar sequestration, a regulatory mechanism of protein function that is observed rarely. VHL is confined to nucleoli until neutral pH conditions are reinstated. Nucleolar sequestration of VHL enables HIF to evade destruction in the presence of oxygen and activate its target genes. Our findings suggest that an increase in hydrogen ions elicits a transient and reversible loss of VHL function by promoting its nucleolar sequestration.", "journal": "Nature cell biology", "date": "2004-06-08", "authors": ["KarimMekhail", "LakshmanGunaratnam", "Marie-EveBonicalzi", "StephenLee"], "doi": "10.1038/ncb1144"}

We found that high expression levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 correlated with the presence of metastatic disease in prostate cancer patients. Positive staining for CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4, was mainly present in the tumor-associated blood vessels and basal cell hyperplasia. Subcutaneous xenografts of PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate tumors that overexpressed CXCR4 in NOD/SCID mice were two- to threefold larger in volume and weight vs. controls. Moreover, blood vessel density, functionality, invasiveness of tumors into the surrounding tissues, and metastasis to the lymph node and lung were significantly increased in these tumors. Neutralizing the interactions of CXCL12/CXCR4 in vivo with CXCR4 specific antibodies inhibited the CXCR4-dependent tumor growth and vascularization. In vitro, CXCL12 induced the proliferation and VEGF secretion but not migration of PC3 and 22Rv1 cells overexpressing CXCR4. Similar effects of CXCR4 overexpression on tumor growth in vivo were also noted in two breast cancer lines, suggesting that the observed effect of CXCR4 is not unique to prostate tumor cells.

There is an emerging concept indicating that these trophic changes may be initiated by modifications of the vasculature. In the current study, we documented over a period of 14 d the serial alterations occurring in both endocrine and endothelial compartments during adrenal atrophy induced by ACTH suppression in mice. After dexamethasone perfusion, a rapid fall of plasmatic ACTH and corticosterone concentrations was observed within the first 24 h. During the first 4 d of treatment, adrenal weight and adrenal cortex cellularity decreased rapidly. This was correlated with an inhibition of cell proliferation and a massive induction of endocrine cell apoptosis. Between d 4 and d 14, a slower but sustained decay of adrenal cortex size and cellularity was observed. This second phase was associated with progressive loss of vascular endothelial growth factor protein expression in the endocrine cells and regression of the vascular network.

The diagnosis of PMCD was based on the presence of corneal thinning with ectasia of the normal cornea above or below the area of thinning with no evidence of scarring, vascularization, or lipid deposition and typical topographic features whenever topography was performed. A detailed history including the age of presentation, onset of symptoms, systemic diseases, atopy, and relevant family history was reviewed. The visual acuity (VA) at presentation; the location, extent, and degree of thinning; presence of concurrent keratoconus and keratoglobus; and complications, if any, were noted. The mode of visual rehabilitation; surgical procedure, if any; and the final VA achieved were analyzed.\nClinical features, associations, complications, and outcome of treatment.\nThere were 45 males (77.6%) and 13 females (22.4%). All cases were bilateral. In one eye, no clinical features of PMCD were seen, but the diagnosis was made based on topographic features of typical PMCD. The age of the patients ranged from 8 to 66 years, with a mean of 34.0+/-14.8. One patient (1.7%) had associated vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), 1 (1.7%) had Marfan's syndrome, and 1 (1.7%) had ocular hypertension.

At first, we quantified oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in follicular fluid from different size follicles; the granulosa cells collected from large follicles (>5 mm) were subjected for 18 h to normoxia (19% O2), partial (5% O2) or total hypoxia (1% O2). The effects of these conditions were tested on the main parameters of granulosa cell function, steroidogenesis and cell proliferation, and on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2-) production. Oxygen tension in follicular fluid was negatively related to follicular size, pointing out a gradual reduction during follicular growth. Severe hypoxic conditions determined a reduction of both 17beta estradiol and progesterone production, while partial hypoxia did not seem to affect them. Hypoxia increased VEGF as well as O2- production in swine granulosa cells without impairing cell growth; in addition, it decreased NO output.

In a complex vascular network, this blood shift is actually a function of time, estimated in a first approximation as Mshift(t)=(Ugr*t)/Rd (Rd: the resistance to downward blood flow). Thus, gravitational stress is proportional to the time spent upright GS=Ugr*Mshift(t)=(Ugr2*t)/Rd=(g2*h2*t)/Rd. From this analysis, regular, prolonged sitting typical of modern life should cause a significant increase in gravitational stress on the cardiovascular system, requiring advanced antigravitational response with sympathetic hyperactivity, vasoconstriction, volume overload, and arterial hypertension. The hypertensive effect of prolonged sitting has been demonstrated in clinical studies.\nEssential hypertension may be explained as adaptation to increased gravitational stress caused by regular, prolonged sitting.

Here, we investigated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin serum levels in nude or BALB/c mice bearing human lung tumors (Calu-6 and H460) or murine mammary tumors (M3MC, M-234p and M-234m), respectively. In these experimental models we previously found an association between in vivo generation of CAR and in vitro conversion of plasminogen into angiostatin. Serum endostatin level in CAR+ Calu-6-bearing mice was significantly higher than in CAR- H460 counterpart. Sera from mammary tumor-bearing mice showed similar levels of endostatin, regardless of their ability to induce CAR. Conversely, serum VEGF levels in mice bearing CAR+ tumors were lower than those found in CAR- tumor-bearing hosts. Immunostaining with an anti-CD31 antibody revealed that secondary tumors subjected to CAR were significantly less vascularized than primary tumors, while this difference was not observed in CAR- tumors. In vitro studies showed an inhibitory effect of sera from CAR-inducing tumors on endothelial cell proliferation as compared to normal sera, whereas sera from non-CAR-inducing tumors did not alter endothelial proliferation and, in some instances, even caused stimulation of endothelial proliferation. These data suggest that the antiangiogenic mechanism operating in concomitant antitumoral resistance is the result of an increase in the ratio of antiangiogenic/proangiogenic regulators.

In both normal and experimentally injured corneas, DPPIV activity was detected histochemically and in the tear fluid biochemically. In contrast to the normal cornea where DPPIV activity was absent and in the tear fluid where it was low, during continuous wearing of contact lenses or repeated irradiation of the cornea with UVB rays, slight DPPIV activity appeared first in the superficial layers of the corneal epithelium, while later increased activity was present in the whole epithelium. This paralleled elevated DPPIV activity in the tear fluid. Moreover, during continuous contact lens wear, the increased DPPIV activity in the tear fluid was, in many cases, coincidental with the presence of capillaries in the limbal part of the corneal stroma. After severe alkali burns when corneal ulcers appeared, collagen fragments were active for DPPIV, which was associated with high DPPIV activity in the tear fluid. In conclusion, Gly-Pro-AFC was found to be useful for comparative histochemical and biochemical studies on DPPIV activity in the experimentally injured rabbit eye. Using the method of the tear film collection by a short touch of substrate punches to the respective site of the cornea or conjunctiva we can show that in experimental injuries (wearing of contact lenses, irradiation of the cornea with UVB rays), the damaged corneal cells were the main source for DPPIV activity in the tear fluid.

Thus far, rapamycin's effects on immunity and cancer have been studied separately. Here we tested the effects of rapamycin, versus cyclosporine A (CsA), on established tumors in mice simultaneously bearing a heart allograft. In one tumor-transplant model, BALB/c mice received subcutaneous syngenic CT26 colon adenocarcinoma cells 7 days before C3H ear-heart transplantation. Rapamycin or CsA treatment was initiated with transplantation. In a second model system, a B16 melanoma was established in C57BL/6 mice that received a primary vascularized C3H heart allograft. In vitro angiogenic effects of rapamycin and CsA were tested in an aortic ring assay. Results show that CT26 tumors grew for 2 weeks before tumor complications occurred. However, rapamycin protected allografts, inhibited tumor growth, and permitted animal survival. In contrast, CsA-treated mice succumbed to advancing tumors, albeit with a functioning allograft. Rapamycin's antitumor effect also functioned in severe combined immunodeficient BALB/c mice. Similar effects of the drugs occurred with B16 melanomas and primary vascularized C3H allografts in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, in this model, rapamycin inhibited the tumor growth-enhancing effects of CsA. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that CsA promotes angiogenesis by a transforming growth factor-beta-related mechanism, and that this effect is abrogated by rapamycin.

A retrospective analysis of all patients treated with split-thickness skin grafts and postoperative radiotherapy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1995 to 2002 was performed. Parameters evaluated included indications for skin graft, defect size, time to postoperative radiotherapy, total radiotherapy dose, delays and interruptions in radiotherapy, wound complications, and the need for further skin grafting. There were 30 patients (23 men, 7 women) with a mean defect size of 152 +/- 132 cm2. All split-thickness skin grafts were placed on healthy vascular tissue beds. In most instances (67%) skin grafts were used to cover muscle flaps. Median time to initial radiotherapy after grafting was 8 weeks (range, 4-60 weeks). There was 1 delay and 4 interruptions in radiotherapy treatment. There were 2 partial skin graft losses (<20%) after radiation that healed with conservative treatment. There was 1 complete skin graft loss after radiotherapy that required regrafting. Split-thickness skin grafts can tolerate postoperative radiotherapy without significant complications. Postoperative external beam radiation can begin as early as 6 to 8 weeks after skin grafting.

At 12 weeks, 81.5% patients showed stabilization (+/-5 letters) in letter visual acuity score, and one patient showed improvement (gain of more than five letters) in letter visual acuity score. Reading speed levels and contrast requirement were found to be similar to pre-laser level at 3 months followup. At 12 weeks, moderate fluorescein leakage was seen in one eye, minimal leakage was seen in five eyes, absence of leakage was seen in 10 eyes, and progression was seen in two eyes.\nTranscleral diode laser treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascular membranes in ARMD may be an effective as well as safe alternative in the management of these patients.", "journal": "Journal of clinical laser medicine & surgery", "date": "2004-05-29", "authors": ["PradeepVenkatesh", "Raj KGupta", "LalitVerma", "H KTewari"], "doi": "10.1089/104454704774076136"}

CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 are over-expressed in malignant gliomas, which are highly vascularized tumors with a poor prognosis. We studied the expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in glioma cell lines, endothelial cells, tissue sections and endocavitary fluids from patients with gliomas. We then analyzed the proliferative and the apoptotic effect of CXCL12 in endothelial cells and glioma primary cultures. We observed the release of CXCL12 in supernatants of human brain microvascular endothelial cells and at variable levels, in post-surgical endocavitary fluids. CXCL12 was expressed in both glioma and endothelial cells as assessed by immunostaining of surgical brain sections. CXCR4 was found in cells lines and primary cultures from malignant gliomas as well as in endothelial cells and was increased by vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). CXCL12 inhibited bFGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells and increased the survival of endothelial cells. The survival of primary cells obtained from glioma specimens was also enhanced in the presence of CXCL12. We point out the presence and the release of CXCL12 in tumor microenvironment and we observed a modulating effect of CXCL12 on proliferation and survival of both endothelial and tumoral cells.

{"title": "Microvascular density does not correlate with histopathology and outcome in neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas.", "abstract": "Microvascular density (MVD), a marker for tumor angiogenesis, has been demonstrated to have prognostic significance in various malignancies. Previous studies have demonstrated that MVD is an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and that longer survival is associated with hypovascular tumors. The prognostic importance of MVD in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) has not been documented. We evaluated MVD in pancreatic NET and correlated it with clinicopathologic features and patient outcome to determine whether MVD is a useful prognostic indicator for these patients. Twenty-five pancreatic NETs from our archival files resected between 1981 and 2000 were identified. The mean MVD was determined for each tumor from the 3 most vascularized 200 x fields. Clinical follow-up ranged from 1 to 19 years, with a mean of 4.9 years. At last follow-up, 6 patients were dead of disease, 10 patients were alive without disease, 4 patients were alive with disease, and 5 patients were alive with disease status unknown. Mean MVD ranged from 43 to 527 microvessels per 200 x field. MVD did not correlate with tumor size, the examined histologic parameters, or patient outcome. MVD in pancreatic NET does not correlate with the clinicohistologic features evaluated in this study or with the patient outcome and is not a useful prognostic indicator in these patients. These results suggest that factors other than the simple number of microvessels are important in determining pancreatic NET behavior. However, most tumors were highly vascular, and additional studies may be helpful to clarify further the role of vascularity and assess the utility of antiangiogenic agents in the treatment of pancreatic NET.", "journal": "Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM", "date": "2004-05-28", "authors": ["GuangmingTan", "Adina MCioc", "DeliaPerez-Montiel", "E ChristopherEllison", "Wendy LFrankel"], "doi": "10.1097/00129039-200403000-00006"}

This gene encodes a protein of 278 amino acids with an amino-terminal signal peptide and two centrally located EGF-like domains. We have named this novel gene in accordance with the guidelines of the Mouse Genome Informatics group Egfl7, for EGF-like domain 7. Egfl7 mRNA is expressed in highly vascularized adult tissues such as the lung, heart, uterus, and ovary. In addition, Egfl7 is expressed early during mouse embryogenesis and in undifferentiated murine embryonic stem cells. The analysis of Egfl7 expression in embryonic day 9.5 embryos by in situ hybridization indicates that Egfl7 is expressed in vascular structures in both the embryo proper and the yolk sac and at sites of mesodermal precursors of angioblasts. Within the cell, EGFL7 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, suggesting that the protein is targeted for secretion. Indeed, recombinant EGFL7 is readily detectable in the supernatant media of transiently transfected HEK293 cells.

That tumor cells can be killed in vitro by tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells is testimony to the fact that the tumors are not inherently resistant to T cell killing, but rather that there is a failure in immune recognition and effector cell activation. Many reasons for this failure of the body's defense system have been suggested, including the inability of tumor-reactive lymphocytes to migrate to tumor tissue. Here we designed a strategy to improve homing of primary lymphocytes into vascularized tumors. As a homing molecule we selected the integrin alpha v beta 3 since it is expressed by angiogenic vascular endothelium in tumors. To promote lymphocyte adhesion to alpha v beta 3 we \"painted\" primary lymphocytes with a recombinant, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked high-affinity ligand for alpha v beta 3. These painted lymphocytes specifically bound to alpha v beta 3 in vitro and homed to vascularized, solid tumors in vivo.

Mice received intramuscular injection with adenoviral VEGF-A or either adenoviral LacZ or PBS as control, followed by surgical induction of acute hindlimb ischemia at day 3. At day 6, capillary density was increased in calf muscle of Ad.VEGF-treated versus control mice (P<0.01). However, angiographic score of collateral arteries was unchanged between Ad.VEGF-treated and control mice. More interestingly, an increase in myoglobin was observed in Ad.VEGF-treated mice. Active myoglobin was 1.5-fold increased in calf muscle of Ad.VEGF-treated mice (P< or =0.01). In addition, the number of myoglobin-stained myofibers was 2.6-fold increased in Ad.VEGF-treated mice (P=0.001).

Uterine implantation and subsequent vascularization increase oxygen exposure of the developing embryo, thereby altering the intracellular reduction-oxidation status. We tested whether Oct-4 could be regulated by these changes in reduction-oxidation status. We found that Oct-4 DNA binding was exquisitely sensitive to abrogation by oxidation but that the DNA binding of another ES cell transcription factor, FoxD3, was much less sensitive to oxidation. The reducing enzyme Thioredoxin (but not Ape-1) could restore DNA-binding activity of Oct-4. Thioredoxin was less effective at restoring the DNA-binding ability of FoxD3. It was also found that Thioredoxin (but not Ape-1) could physically associate with cysteines in the POU domain of Oct-4. Finally, overexpressing normal Thioredoxin increased the transcriptional activity of Oct-4, while overexpressing a mutant Thioredoxin decreased the transcriptional activity of Oct-4.

The mutant mice were macroscopically normal, and the skin capillary system was well established, demonstrating that keratinocyte-derived VEGF-A is not essential for angiogenesis in the skin during embryonic development.

{"title": "Membrane localization of v-ErbB is required but not sufficient for ligand-independent transformation.", "abstract": "The v-ErbB retroviral oncogene is a transduced, mutated copy of the avian EGF receptor gene, and its expression is sufficient to induce tumor formation in vivo. The structural alterations that release the oncogenic potential of the v-ErbB oncogene are similar to EGFR gene mutations described in human tumors. Thus, the study of v-ErbB tumor biology offers a useful model through which we can gain insight into the mechanism of EGFR-induced malignancies. Despite years of study, however, questions remain regarding the domains of v-ErbB required for oncogenicity. We sought to clarify the role of the transmembrane domain of v-ErbB during transformation using S3-v-ErbB, an acutely transforming retroviral oncogene isolated from avian sarcomas. Infection of primary fibroblasts with a retroviral vector containing S3-v-ErbB results in the formation of a transformation-associated phosphoprotein signaling complex, soft agar colony formation, and the rapid induction of highly vascularized sarcomas in vivo. To address contribution of the transmembrane domain of S3-v-ErbB during these processes, we constructed a mutant version of this oncogene with a precise deletion in this domain. Specifically, the S3-v-ErbB-TM- mutant was created through an in-frame deletion of the entire transmembrane domain.

Serum levels of VEGF, HGF and FGF-2 were determined in 18 patients whereas IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured in 19 patients. Sixteen of the 38 patients (42%) responded to thalidomide. The response rate was significantly higher in patients without EMP (59% vs 0%, p = 0.0006 ). VEGF serum levels were significantly higher in responding patients.

Healing promoters, including bone morphogenic proteins, fibroblast growth factors, and transforming growth factor-beta, regulate bone growth in experimental models, such as those employing a \"critical gap\" to establish nonunion, but have not been effective in clinical situations. This paradox may relate to the fact that such agents target cells, yet in the setting of a clinical nonunion or osteomyelitis, the affected area is frequently hypovascular and therefore deficient in target precursor cells. Wound healing is dependent on local tissue vascularity.

Clinical and imaging evaluation was used for the pre- and postoperative assessment of all patients. Apart of conventional radiographs obtained in all cases, 15 patients were also assessed postoperatively with MRI at 3 months. From these 15 patients, eight were assessed preoperatively with MRI whereas nine had serial MRI evaluations at 6 and 12 months. The clinical follow-up time of this subgroup of 15 patients ranged from 6 to 27 months.\nAll patients showed clinical signs of union within 12 weeks form the procedure and at the latest follow-up they experienced complete (10 cases) or almost complete (five cases) relief from pain. Both plain and contrast-enhanced MRI obtained at 3 months showed viability of the bone graft in all cases. At 3 months union was established with plain radiographs in 12 patients at both sides of the graft and in three patients between the graft and proximal pole. At 3 months plain MRI showed nonunion in four patients (two between graft and proximal pole, two between graft and distal pole and one at both sides of the graft) whereas contrast-enhanced MRI revealed only one case of nonunion between graft and proximal pole. Four patients were considered to have osteonecrosis of the proximal pole intraoperatively. Two of them showed necrosis of the proximal pole with preoperative and postoperative plain radiographs and three of them with plain postoperative MRI. Contrast-enhanced MRI at 3 months showed postoperative reversal of necrotic changes in all four scaphoids. MRI also revealed bone marrow oedema of the carpal bones surrounding the scaphoid in 14 cases. Serial MRI at 6 and 12 months, obtained in nine patients, revealed resolution of the bone marrow oedema of the surrounding bones and full graft incorporation in all cases.\nContrast-enhanced MRI is able to demonstrate the early union after treatment of scaphoid nonunions with vascularised bone grafts allowing thus earlier mobilisation.

A non-resorbable membrane filled with autogenous blood was placed in the experimental area and secured with titanium pins. After 1 and 2 weeks, vascularized connective tissue and new bone were generated in the space surrounding the defects in both the groups. The amount of vascularized connective tissue generated in Group B was greater than that in Group A at 1 week. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was expressed on the bone surrounding the perforation. The expression of ALP was more extensive in Group B than in Group A and was proportional to the breadth of perforation. At 2 weeks, the perforated region was almost covered with new bone in Group A. ALP was expressed at the periphery of newly formed bone. The expression of ALP was proportional to the breadth and height of perforation. At 6 weeks, semicircular outgrowth of bone towards the periphery of the perforated region was observed in both the groups. Newly formed bone volume and ALP expression in Group B were more extensive than those in Group A. At 12 weeks, the space was filled with bone and connective tissue in both the groups.

Sufficient treatment protocols not only contain complex surgical procedures but also sophisticated diagnostic tools, proper use of antibiotics, and intensive physical therapy right from the beginning. Even in light of these advanced treatment protocols, which have great impact on both patients and health care systems, persisting infection and residual functional deficits of the extremities are not rare. In cases of early (acute) infection, the main objective is to avoid chronification by diligent surgical interventions. The surgical principle is the meticulous debridement and lavage of the situs. Revision of only the epifascial layers is as inadequate as the simple reopening of the wound without excision of the whole wound including all tissue layers. In cases of chronic soft tissue and bone infection, radical debridement of all infected and scar tissue is also the basic requirement of treatment. Reconstruction of the soft tissue envelope is done by local or free flap surgery. Because of they are better resistant to infection, musculo(cutaneous)flaps are preferred. Bony reconstruction is done by autologous cancellous bone grafting (partial defects), segment transport (full thickness defects), or freely transplanted vascularized bone grafts (large partial defects). Both soft tissue and osseous reconstruction take a relatively long period of time requiring several operations and periods of hospitalization. These have to be discussed and explained to the patients extensively. If the required amount of resection and the capability of reconstruction do not coincide, the surgeon and the patient have to decide whether restoration of function without definitive infection care, symptomatic infection therapy, or amputation is the most proper treatment option according to the patient's everyday needs and lifestyle.

EPC-1 expression has been detected in a number of cultured cell lines, including lung and skin fibroblasts, retinal pigmented epithelial cells, and endometrial stromal fibroblasts. Furthermore, its expression has been shown to decline during replicative aging of these cells in culture. In this report, we describe our examination of the age-related changes in EPC-1 expression in situ in skin sections from donors of different ages. EPC-1 mRNA is detected primarily in the dermal layer of the skin and its expression declines with increasing donor age. This decline is statistically significant between young (less than 31 years old) and middle-aged (between 30 and 60 years old) donors, with the decline becoming less dramatic at older ages. This age-related decline in the expression of an angiogenic inhibitor contributes to the imbalance of angiogenic modulators that is observed during aging. In fact, this decline may reflect a compensatory change to help reverse the decline of angiogenesis marked by reduced abundance of microvessels. This downregulation of an angiogenesis inhibitor may, in turn, play a critical role in the development of diseases caused by abnormal vascularization. The potential role of the age-associated decline in EPC-1 expression in tissue remodeling and in the development of skin diseases with excessive angiogenesis may provide new insights into disease prevention.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2004-05-14", "authors": ["Mary KayFrancis", "StaciaAppel", "ChristineMeyer", "Samuel JBalin", "Arthur KBalin", "Vincent JCristofalo"], "doi": "10.1111/j.0022-202X.2004.22510.x"}

{"title": "Development of the primate area of high acuity. 1. Use of finite element analysis models to identify mechanical variables affecting pit formation.", "abstract": "Most primate retinas have an area dedicated for high visual acuity called the fovea centralis. Little is known about specific mechanisms that drive development of this complex central retinal specialization. The primate area of high acuity (AHA) is characterized by the presence of a pit that displaces the inner retinal layers. Virtual engineering models were analyzed with finite element analysis (FEA) to identify mechanical mechanisms potentially critical for pit formation. Our hypothesis is that the pit emerges within the AHA because it contains an avascular zone (AZ). The absence of blood vessels makes the tissue within the AZ more elastic and malleable than the surrounding vascularized retina. Models evaluated the contribution to pit formation of varying elasticity ratios between the AZ and surrounding retina, AZ shape, and width. The separate and interactive effects of two mechanical variables, intraocular pressure (IOP) and ocular growth-induced retinal stretch, on pit formation were also evaluated. Either stretch or IOP alone produced a pit when applied to a FEA model having a highly elastic AZ surrounded by a less elastic region. Pit depth and width increased when the elasticity ratio increased, but a pit could not be generated in models lacking differential elasticity. IOP alone produced a deeper pit than did stretch alone and the deepest pit resulted from the combined effects of IOP and stretch. These models predict that the pit in the AHA is formed because an absence of vasculature makes the inner retinal tissue of the AZ very deformable. Once a differential elasticity gradient is established, pit formation can be driven by either IOP or ocular growth-induced retinal stretch.", "journal": "Visual neuroscience", "date": "2004-05-13", "authors": ["A DSpringer", "A EHendrickson"], "doi": "10.1017/s0952523804041057"}

Thus, there is a need to define the spheroid size which enables maximal cell viability and productivity. We developed a combined theoretical and experimental approach to define this optimal spheroid size. Hepatocyte spheroids were formed in alginate scaffolds having a pore diameter of 100 microm, in rotating T-flasks or spinners, to yield a maximal size of 100, 200, and 600 microm, respectively. Cell viability was found to decrease with increasing spheroid size. A mathematical model was constructed to describe the relationship between spheroid size and cell viability via the oxygen mass balance equation. This enabled the prediction of oxygen distribution profiles and distribution of viable cells in spheroids with varying size. The model describes that no oxygen limitation will take place in spheroids up to 100 microm in diameter. Spheroid size affected the specific rate of albumin secretion as well; it reached a maximal level, i.e., 60 microg/million cells/day in 100-microm diameter spheroids. This behavior was depicted in an equation relating the specific albumin secretion rate to spheroid size. The calculated results fitted with the experimental data, predicting the need for a critical number of viable hepatocytes to gain a maximal albumin secretion. Taken together, the results on mass transport in spheroids and its effects on cell viability and productivity provide a useful tool for the design of 3D scaffolds with pore diameters of 100 microm.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2004-05-12", "authors": ["RachelGlicklis", "Jose CMerchuk", "SmadarCohen"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.20086"}

We report here the identification of a recessive mouse mutation termed shrunken-head (shru) that disrupts function of the Titin gene. Titin was found to be required for the initiation of proper heart contractions as well as for maintaining the correct overall shape and orientation of individual cardiomyocytes. Cardiac dysfunction in shrunken-head mutant embryos provided an opportunity to study the effects of lack of blood circulation on the morphogenesis of endothelial cells. Without blood flow, differentiating endothelial cells display defects in their shapes and patterns of cell-cell contact. These endothelial cells, without exposure to blood circulation, have an abnormal distribution within vasculogenic vessels.

Vascularization of placental villi starts at around day 21 post conception (p.c.) with a four somite embryo. At this stage progenitors of haemangiogenic cells differentiate to form first vessels. These progenitor cells are thought to be directly derived from mesenchymal cells rather than originating from fetal blood cells. We investigated the relation between differentiation of stromal cells towards endothelial cells and vascular structures and the expression pattern of the respective growth factors. Using transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry (for VEGF, Flt-1, Flk-1, CD14, CD34, and CD68) the development of placental vasculogenesis during very early stages of pregnancy (days 22-48 p.c.) was studied. We found that VEGF is strongly expressed in villous cytotrophoblast cells and subsequently in Hofbauer cells while its receptors Flt-1 and Flk-1 are found on vasculogenic and angiogenic precursor cells. The developmental expression and secretion of VEGF suggests its involvement in recruitment, maintenance and formation of first angiogenic cells and vessels. Interactions between VEGF and Flk-1 and Flt-1 may regulate placental vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in a paracrine and autocrine manner.

This paper presents a mathematical framework which describes the evolution of growth-induced stresses in tumors and gives new insights into both vascular collapse and tumor growth dynamics. The linear-elastic description of anisotropic growth adopted here provides the mechanical model with a realistic constitutive basis, incorporating both the solid and stress-relaxation characteristics of soft biological tissues. A particular distribution of spatially non-uniform growth is proposed which is considered representative of a vascular tumor. The stress distribution associated with this growth pattern predicts the onset of vascular collapse, producing the well-defined regions observed in vascular collapse experiments: a peripheral layer with open blood vessels adjacent to a region of vascular collapse, enclosing an inner region where the vessels are open.

Emulsion of lipiodol mixed with mitomycin C, and 5-FU bletilla microspheres were injected into the hepatic artery respectively, and saline was used as control agent. MR imaging was performed with turbo-flash sequence 14 d after tumor implantation and 7 d after interventional therapy. The steepest slopes (SS) of the signal intensity versus time curves were created for quantitative analysis, 7.5% Chinese ink gelatin solution was injected through ascending artery (17 cases) or portal vein (2 cases) for lesion microvessel area (MVA) measurement after the last MRI examination. The correlation between perfusion imaging and MVA was studied blindly.\nThe SS values at the rim of tumor in lipiodol group (mean, 49% per second) and bletilla group (mean, 35% per second) were significantly decreased (P<0.05) as compared with control group (mean, 124% per second), no difference was found between lipiodol and bletilla groups (P>0.05). In lipiodol group, the MVAs (24 974+/-11 836 microm(2)) in the center of the tumor were significantly smaller than those of the control group (35 510+/-15 675 microm(2)) (P<0.05), while the MVAs (80 031+/-22 745 microm(2)) around the tumor were significantly increased because small and dense plexuses appeared around the tumor which correlated to intense reaction of granulation tissue.

{"title": "Cardiac myocyte-specific HIF-1alpha deletion alters vascularization, energy availability, calcium flux, and contractility in the normoxic heart.", "abstract": "At a resting pulse rate the heart consumes almost twice-as much oxygen per gram tissue as the brain and more than 43 times more than resting skeletal muscle (1). Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot sustain anaerobic metabolism. Balancing oxygen demand with availability is crucial to cardiac function and survival, and regulated gene expression is a critical element of maintaining this balance. We investigated the role of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1alpha in maintaining this balance under normoxic conditions. Cardiac myocyte-specific HIF-1alpha gene deletion in the hearts of genetically engineered mice caused reductions in contractility, vascularization, high-energy phosphate content, and lactate production. This was accompanied by altered calcium flux and altered expression of genes involved in calcium handling, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism. These findings support a central role for HIF-1alpha in coordinating energy availability and utilization in the heart and have implications for disease states in which cardiac oxygen delivery is impaired. Heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygen. When oxygen supply does not match myocardial demand cardiac contractile dysfunction occurs, and prolongation of this mismatch leads to apoptosis and necrosis. Coordination of oxygen supply and myocardial demand involves immediate adaptations, such as coronary vasodilatation, and longer-term adaptations that include altered patterns of gene expression (2-4). How the expression of multiple genes is coordinated with oxygen availability in the heart and the impact of oxygen-dependent gene expression on cardiac function are insufficiently understood. Further elucidating these relationships may help clarify the molecular pathology of various cardiovascular disease states, including ischemic cardiomyopathy and myocardial hibernation (5, 6).", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2004-05-11", "authors": ["YanHuang", "Reed PHickey", "Jennifer LYeh", "DinggangLiu", "AgnesDadak", "Lawrence HYoung", "Randall SJohnson", "Frank JGiordano"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.04-1510fje"}

We present a review of the surgical outcomes.\nFrom December 2001 to January 2003, unilateral breast reconstruction was performed in 12 patients using the DIEP free flap at the same time of modified radical mastectomy in our department. The recipient vessels were the thoracodorsal artery and vein or the internal mammary artery and its venae concomitants.\nOf the 12 DIEP flaps, 1 was vascularized by a single perforator, 3 were vascularized by two perforators, 6 by three perforators, 1 by four an 1 by five perforators. One flap failed totally, likely due to previous multiple lower abdominal operations. The eleven reconstructed breasts achieved almost the same size and shape as the healthy sides. The time of patient getting out of bed ranged from 3 to 7 days and the mean hospital stay was 8.8 days. All patients were satisfied with the outcome. No complications were observed in the abdominal wall, including weakness, abdominal bulge or hernia.\nImmediate breast reconstruction facilitates the psychological rehabilitation and helps to avoid the dressing inconveniences resulted from total mastectomy. Free DIEP flap is a new and reliable technique for immediate breast reconstruction with autologous tissue. This flap offers the patients the same advantages as the TRAM flap and avoids its most important disadvantage of potential abdominal wall weakness, by preserving the continuity of the rectus abdominis muscle. The donor site morbidity is thus reduced and recovery is faster.

{"title": "Roles of unsaturated fatty acids (especially omega-3 fatty acids) in the brain at various ages and during ageing.", "abstract": "Among various organs, in the brain, the fatty acids most extensively studied are omega-3 fatty acids. Alpha-linolenic acid (18:3omega3) deficiency alters the structure and function of membranes and induces minor cerebral dysfunctions, as demonstrated in animal models and subsequently in human infants. Even though the brain is materially an organ like any other, that is to say elaborated from substances present in the diet (sometimes exclusively), for long it was not accepted that food can have an influence on brain structure, and thus on its function. Lipids, and especially omega-3 fatty acids, provided the first coherent experimental demonstration of the effect of diet (nutrients) on the structure and function of the brain. In fact the brain, after adipose tissue, is the organ richest in lipids, whose only role is to participate in membrane structure. First it was shown that the differentiation and functioning of cultured brain cells requires not only alpha-linolenic acid (the major component of the omega-3, omega3 family), but also the very long omega-3 and omega-6 carbon chains (1). It was then demonstrated that alpha-linolenic acid deficiency alters the course of brain development, perturbs the composition and physicochemical properties of brain cell membranes, neurones, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes (2). This leads to physicochemical modifications, induces biochemical and physiological perturbations, and results in neurosensory and behavioural upset (3). Consequently, the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega-3) present in formula milks for infants (premature and term) conditions the visual and cerebral abilities, including intellectual. Moreover, dietary omega-3 fatty acids are certainly involved in the prevention of some aspects of cardiovascular disease (including at the level of cerebral vascularization), and in some neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, as well as in dementia, notably Alzheimer's disease. Recent results have shown that dietary alpha-linolenic acid deficiency induces more marked abnormalities in certain cerebral structures than in others, as the frontal cortex and pituitary gland are more severely affected. These selective lesions are accompanied by behavioural disorders more particularly affecting certain tests (habituation, adaptation to new situations). Biochemical and behavioural abnormalities are partially reversed by a dietary phospholipid supplement, especially omega-3-rich egg yolk extracts or pig brain. A dose-effect study showed that animal phospholipids are more effective than plant phospholipids to reverse the consequences of alpha-linolenic acid deficiency, partly because they provide very long preformed chains. Alpha-linolenic acid deficiency decreases the perception of pleasure, by slightly altering the efficacy of sensory organs and by affecting certain cerebral structures. Age-related impairment of hearing, vision and smell is due to both decreased efficacy of the parts of the brain concerned and disorders of sensory receptors, particularly of the inner ear or retina. For example, a given level of perception of a sweet taste requires a larger quantity of sugar in subjects with alpha-linolenic acid deficiency. In view of occidental eating habits, as omega-6 fatty acid deficiency has never been observed, its impact on the brain has not been studied. In contrast, omega-9 fatty acid deficiency, specifically oleic acid deficiency, induces a reduction of this fatty acid in many tissues, except the brain (but the sciatic nerve is affected). This fatty acid is therefore not synthesized in sufficient quantities, at least during pregnancy-lactation, implying a need for dietary intake. It must be remembered that organization of the neurons is almost complete several weeks before birth, and that these neurons remain for the subject's life time. Consequently, any disturbance of these neurons, an alteration of their connections, and impaired turnover of their constituents at any stage of life, will tend to accelerate ageing. The enzymatic activities of sytivities of synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids are very limited in the brain: this organ therefore depends on an exogenous supply. Consequently, fatty acids that are essential for the brain are arachidonic acid and cervonic acid, derived from the diet, unless they are synthesized by the liver from linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. The age-related reduction of hepatic desaturase activities (which participate in the synthesis of long chains, together with elongases) can impair turnover of cerebral membranes. In many structures, especially in the frontal cortex, a reduction of cervonic and arachidonic acids is observed during ageing, predominantly associated with a reduction of phosphatidylethanolamines (mainly in the form of plasmalogens). Peroxisomal oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids decreases in the brain during ageing, participating in decreased turnover of membrane fatty acids, which are also less effectively protected against peroxidation by free radicals.", "journal": "The journal of nutrition, health & aging", "date": "2004-05-07", "authors": ["J MBourre"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Differential regulation of ANG2 and VEGF-A in human granulosa lutein cells by choriogonadotropin.", "abstract": "The growth and development of the corpus luteum after rupture of the follicle is a highly regulated process characterised by a rapid vascularization of the follicle surrounding granulosa cells. Vascularization is regulated by a large number of growth factors and cytokines whereas members of the angiopoietin family and VEGF-A are reported to play a principal role. The gonadotropic hormones luteinizing hormone and choriogonadotropin are reported to be essential for corpus luteum formation. In this study we investigated by RT PCR if the growth factors PGF, PDGF-A, PDGF-B, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, ANG1, ANG2, ANG3 and ANG4 are expressed in granulosa cells. We show the expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, PDGF-A, ANG1 and ANG2 in granulosa cells. Using RT-PCR and Real-Time PCR we demonstrate that angiopoietin 2 is downregulated in human granulosa cells in vitro after choriogonadotropin treatment whereas the expression of angiopoietin 1 is not significantly altered. The expression of VEGF on the RNA- and on the protein level was determined. It was shown that in granulosa cells VEGF is upregulated after choriogonadotropin treatment on the RNA level and that increasing concentrations of choriogonadotropin from 0 to 10 U/ml leads to an increasing amount of VEGF in the cell culture supernatants. The amount of VEGF in the supernatants reaches a plateau at 0.5 U/ml and is increased only slightly and not significantly after treatment of the cells with 10 U/ml choriogonadotropin compared to 0.5 U/ml. In total these findings suggests that in granulosa cells the mRNA of various growth factors is detectable by RT-PCR and that VEGF-A and ANG2 is regulated by the gonadotropic hormone choriogonadotropin.

The authors evaluated various biomechanical aspects of the second metatarsophalangeal joint, which included the mediolateral arc of movement of the second metatarsophalangeal joint in hyperextension when subjected to lateral stress loading; the different patterns of disruption at peak load; and the flexion and extension range of movement. Twenty-six cadaveric specimens were tested with a customized jig. The results showed that the mediolateral arc of movement of 114 degrees approximates that of the flexion and extension range of movement of 114.2 degrees. However, it differed in that it was equal in both directions, compared with an extension arc that was greater than a flexion arc. The peak load was approximately 100 N, and this resulted in fracture, avulsion, and ligament tear.

{"title": "Managing women with post-menopausal bleeding.", "abstract": "Transvaginal ultrasound examination can reliably distinguish women with post-menopausal bleeding (PMB) who are at low risk of endometrial pathology (endometrial thickness < or =4 mm) from those who are at high risk (endometrium > or =5 mm) and can rule out focally growing lesions in the uterine cavity using saline infusion into the cavity as a negative contrast agent (hydrosonography). The 5 mm cut-off is applicable irrespective of the use of hormone replacement therapy. It is justified to refrain from endometrial sampling in women with PMB and an endometrial thickness of < or =4 mm because the risk of endometrial cancer in these women is low (0.1-1.0%). However, it is not known whether these women need follow-up. About 80% of women with PMB and an endometrium of > or =5 mm have focally growing pathological lesions in the uterine cavity. These should be removed by operative hysteroscopy because dilatation and curettage (D and C) will fail to diagnose and remove a large proportion of these lesions. However, D and C is a reliable diagnostic method for women without focal lesions in the uterine cavity. It is not known whether simple outpatient sampling devices (e.g. Pipelle) are as reliable as D and C in women without focal lesions.

Matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-9 and cathepsin B have been shown to participate in the processes of tumor growth, vascularization and invasion of gliomas. In the present study, we used a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven DNA template approach to induce hairpin RNA (hpRNA)-triggered RNA interference (RNAi) to block MMP-9 and cathepsin B gene expression with a single construct. Transfection of a plasmid vector-expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for MMP-9 and cathepsin B significantly inhibited MMP-9 and cathepsin B expression and reduced the invasive behavior of SNB19, glioblastoma cell line in Matrigel and spheroid invasion models. Downregulation of MMP-9 and cathepsin B using RNAi in SNB19 cells reduced cell-cell interaction of human microvascular endothelial cells, resulting in the disruption of capillary network formation in both in vitro and in vivo models. Direct intratumoral injections of plasmid DNA expressing hpRNA for MMP-9 and cathepsin B significantly inhibited established glioma tumor growth and invasion in intracranial tumors in vivo. Further intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of plasmid DNA expressing hpRNA for MMP-9 and cathepsin B completely regressed pre-established tumors for a long time (4 months) without any indication of these tumor cells.

In the present study, we have investigated whether L-AT has comparable antiangiogenic effects on physiological angiogenesis of ovarian tissue. For this purpose, preovulatory follicles of Syrian golden hamsters were mechanically isolated and transplanted into dorsal skinfold chambers chronically implanted in L-AT- or AT-treated hamsters. Non-treated animals served as controls. Over 14 days after transplantation neovascularization of the follicular grafts was assessed in vivo by quantitative analysis of the newly developed microvascular network, its microvessel density, the diameter of the microvessels, their red blood cell velocity and volumetric blood flow as well as leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction using fluorescence microscopic techniques. In each group, all of the grafted follicles were able to induce angiogenesis. At day 3 after transplantation, sinusoidal sacculations and capillary sprouts could be observed, finally developing complete glomerulum-like microvascular networks within 5 to 7 days. Overall revascularization of grafted follicles did not differ between the groups studied. Interestingly, follicular grafts in L-AT- and AT-treated hamsters presented with higher values of microvessel diameters and volumetric blood flow, when compared to non-treated controls, which may be best interpreted as a reactive response to an increased release of vasoactive mediators. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates, that L-AT has no adverse effects on physiological angiogenesis of freely transplanted ovarian follicles.

Peritoneal tissue was analyzed for VEGF protein using immunohistochemistry.\nAt the end of 6 weeks, the rate of glucose transport (D/D0, where D is glucose concentration in the dialysate and D0 is glucose concentration in the dialysis solution before it is infused into the peritoneal cavity) was higher in group T (p < 0.05) than in group C. Dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D/P) of protein was lower in group T (p < 0.05) than in group C; D/P(urea), D/P(sodium), and drain volumes did not differ significantly between groups C and T. Dialysate VEGF and TGFbeta levels were lower in group T (p < 0.05) than in group C. Immunohistochemical studies also revealed less VEGF in the peritoneal membranes of group T. There were significantly more peritoneal blood vessels in group C (p < 0.05) than in group T, but the thickness of submesothelial matrix of the parietal peritoneum was not different between the two groups. The VEGF levels in the dialysate effluent correlated positively with the number of blood vessels per field (r = 0.622, p < 0.005).\nUsing a chronic inflammatory infusion model of PD in the rat, we show that dialysis with GDP-containing PD fluid is associated with increased VEGF production and peritoneal vascularization. Use of low GDP solutions may therefore be beneficial in maintaining the function and structure of the peritoneal membrane during long-term PD.", "journal": "Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis", "date": "2004-05-04", "authors": ["Sun-HeePark", "Eun-GyuiLee", "In-SanKim", "Yong-JinKim", "Dong-KyuCho", "Yong-LimKim"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Reconstruction of the breast conservation deformity.", "abstract": "The era of breast conserving treatment of early-stage breast carcinoma has created reconstructive challenges for the plastic surgeon. Although good to excellent cosmetic outcomes occur in the majority of patients, a significant number could benefit from additional reconstructive measures. Because of the need for continuing surveillance following breast-conserving therapy, estimated at 5-10% after fifteen years, plastic surgeons should choose techniques that do not interfere with the detection of recurrent breast carcinoma. Myocutaneous flaps-in particular, the latissimus dorsi and transverse rectus abdominis-have fulfilled the reconstructive needs of these patients by providing well-vascularized soft tissue. Postoperative radiological evaluation has demonstrated that these flaps are radiolucent, unlike breast implants that can obscure accurate mammographic interpretation.Myocutaneous flaps have been used for both immediate and delayed reconstruction of post-breast conservation deformities. The delayed approach offers the benefit of an established contour deformity that usually involves cutaneous, parenchymal, and nipple-areolar components. Moderate overcorrection of the defect has been advocated in anticipation of ongoing postradiation wound contraction and fibrosis. Immediate reconstruction of lumpectomy and partial mastectomy defects permits wider initial excision of the breast lesion, but can be compromised by positive histological margins.

We have systematically investigated whether coadministration of the mouse angiostatin kringle 1-3 gene (pFLAG-AngioK1/3) and the endostatin gene (pFLAG-Endo) complexed with cationic liposomes exhibits enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In vitro, the coexpressed mixture of angiostatin K1-3 and endostatin more effectively reduced angiogenesis in chorioallantoic membranes than either angiostatin K1-3 or endostatin alone. In vivo, subcutaneous co-administration of pFLAG-AngioK1/3 and pFLAG-Endo lipoplexes more effectively inhibited vascularization in Matrigel plugs implanted in mice than either one alone. Additionally, subcutaneous administration of these genes inhibited the growth and formation of pulmonary metastases of B16BL6 melanoma cells in mice. Compared to treatment with an empty vector, treatment with pFLAG-AngioK1/3 plus pFLAG-Endo inhibited 81% of tumor growth, while treatment with pFLAG-AngioK1/3 or pFLAG-Endo inhibited tumor growth 70 and 69%, respectively. Cotreatment with the two plasmids after primary tumor excision induced a 90% inhibition of pulmonary metastases versus 79% for pFLAG-AngioK1/3 or 80% for pFLAG-Endo individually.

These cells maintain endothelial characteristics such as marker expression, dependence on basic fibroblast growth factor for proliferation, and the ability to form tube structures on Matrigel. In addition, these cells do not show signs of tumorigenic transformation because their growth is contact-inhibited, serum-dependent, and anchorage-dependent. In addition, i-HUVEC do not grow or survive when implanted subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice. Notably, the i-HUVEC lines maintain normal p53-dependent checkpoint control, inducing expression of p21(Cip1/Waf1) in response to DNA damage. These cells subsequently decrease phosphorylation of pRb and arrest in G1. Furthermore, the i-HUVEC lines maintain normal p53-independent checkpoint control, inducing expression of p27(Kip1) in response to lovastatin treatment, with a subsequent decrease in pRb phosphorylation. Lovastatin-treated i-HUVEC lines undergo a G1 arrest that can be reversed with comparable kinetics to that of low passage HUVEC. Together these data demonstrate that telomerase-immortalized endothelial cells can retain normal phenotypes and cell cycle regulation.

Data were obtained retrospectively. Diagnoses were pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect in 11, tetralogy of Fallot in 6, and other forms of pulmonary stenosis or atresia in 6. Median age and weight at diagnosis were 9 years (range, 6 days to 43 years) and 24 kg (range, 2.6 to 60 kg). Fourteen patients had had a previous surgery. The occluded pulmonary artery was visualized at angiography by wedge injection or injection into the collateral circulation. The left pulmonary artery was occluded in 20 patients and the right pulmonary artery in 3. Criteria for reconstruction were estimated duration of occlusion <6 months and ratio of occluded to contralateral artery >0.2. Twelve patients fulfilled these criteria and underwent pulmonary artery reconstruction at a mean interval of 2 months (range, 6 days to 6 months) from evidence of occlusion. Six patients had pericardial patch reconstruction, 3 terminoterminal anastomosis, 2 thrombectomy, and 1 a Blalock-Taussig shunt. There was 1 late death. At a median follow-up of 4 years (2 months to 5 years), all patients underwent cardiac catheterization: in 8 patients the reconstructed artery was patent, in 3 reoccluded.

{"title": "Paired-related homeobox gene Prx1 is required for pulmonary vascular development.", "abstract": "Herein, we show that the paired-related homeobox gene, Prx1, is required for lung vascularization. Initial studies revealed that Prx1 localizes to differentiating endothelial cells (ECs) within the fetal lung mesenchyme, and later within ECs forming vascular networks. To begin to determine whether Prx1 promotes EC differentiation, fetal lung mesodermal cells were transfected with full-length Prx1 cDNA, resulting in their morphological transformation to an endothelial-like phenotype. In addition, Prx1-transformed cells acquired the ability to form vascular networks on Matrigel. Thus, Prx1 might function by promoting pulmonary EC differentiation within the fetal lung mesoderm, as well as their subsequent incorporation into vascular networks. To understand how Prx1 participates in network formation, we focused on tenascin-C (TN-C), an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein induced by Prx1. Immunocytochemistry/histochemistry showed that a TN-C-rich ECM surrounds Prx1-positive pulmonary vascular networks both in vivo and in tissue culture. Furthermore, antibody-blocking studies showed that TN-C is required for Prx1-dependent vascular network formation on Matrigel. Finally, to determine whether these results were relevant in vivo, we examined newborn Prx1-wild-type (+/+) and Prx1-null (-/-) mice and showed that Prx1 is critical for expression of TN-C and lung vascularization.

PEDF expression was increased in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) based on microarray analyses. Angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic lung diseases, we therefore hypothesized that regional abnormalities in vascularization occur in IPF as a result of an imbalance between PEDF and vascular endothelial growth factor. We demonstrated that vascular density is regionally decreased in IPF within the fibroblastic foci, and that within these areas PEDF was increased, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor was decreased. PEDF colocalized with the fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, particularly within the fibrotic interstitium and the fibroblastic focus, and prominently within the epithelium directly overlying the fibroblastic focus. This suggested that TGF-beta 1 might regulate PEDF expression. Using 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and human lung fibroblasts, we showed that PEDF was indeed a TGF-beta 1 target gene.

In the heart, substantial differences in microsphere density are seen at spatial resolutions <5 ml, implying perfusion heterogeneity. Microsphere deposition imaging permits a superior evaluation of the distribution pattern. Therefore, fluorescent microspheres (FMS) were applied, FMS deposition in the canine heart was imaged by epifluorescence microscopy in vitro, and the patterns were observed compared with MR images of iron oxide microspheres (IMS) obtained in vivo and in vitro. FMS deposition in myocardial slices revealed the following: 1) a nonrandom distribution, with sequentially applied FMS of different color stacked within the same vessel, 2) general FMS clustering, and 3) rather large areas devoid of FMS (n = 3). This pattern was also seen in reconstructed three-dimensional images (<1 nl resolution) of FMS distribution (n = 4). Surprisingly, the deposition pattern of sequentially applied FMS remained virtually identical over 3 days. Augmenting flow by intracoronary adenosine (>2 microM) enhanced local microsphere density, but did not alter the deposition pattern (n = 3). The nonrandom, temporally stable pattern was quantitatively confirmed by a three-dimensional intermicrosphere distance analysis of sequentially applied FMS. T2-weighted short-axis MR images (2-microl resolution) of IMS revealed similar patterns in vivo and in vitro (n = 6), as seen with FMS. The observed temporally stable microsphere patterns are not consistent with the notion that microsphere deposition is solely governed by blood flow.

We hypothesized that capsular vascularization achieved by local release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) would lead to enhanced function. Amperometric glucose sensor array disks, each with four indicating electrodes, were implanted into rats. Animals received local subcutaneous infusions of VEGF(165) via osmotic pumps at a location on the sensor face 2 mm from one of the electrodes (\"near units\"). \"Intermediate\" electrode units were 15 mm, and \"distant\" units were 22 mm, from the VEGF source. Every 2 weeks, a glucose infusion was given to assess sensor function by telemetry. Near units demonstrated a lower lag duration (delay after blood glucose) than intermediate and distant units. The mean absolute relative difference for near units was less than for distant units. The percentage of data pairs in the A region of the Clarke error grid of the near sensing units was greater than that of the distant units. Values for the functional measures for saline controls fell between near and distant VEGF values. Glucose sensor function was found to be more favorable in units immediately adjacent to the VEGF infusion port. The most likely cause for this finding is increased neovessel growth in the surrounding foreign body capsule.

Fifteen male mongrel dogs underwent orthotopic, free transfer of the left gracilis with microneurovascular anastomosis. After a minimum of 10 months' recovery, muscle biopsy specimens were obtained from the transfers and the contralateral controls and analyzed for relative fiber type areas and maximum activities of phosphorylase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HAD), and creatine phosphokinase. Biopsy specimens obtained before and after a 10 minute, 20-Hz contraction were analyzed for glucose, glycogen, glycolytic intermediates, phosphocreatine, total creatine, and adenine nucleotides (adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate, inosine monophosphate, and inosine). There was no significant transfer versus control difference in type I relative fiber area (45 +/- 4 percent versus 44 +/- 3 percent). Total creatine was significantly reduced in the transferred muscles relative to control (83.1 +/- 3.0 mmol/kg versus 100.6 +/- 5.1 mmol/kg dry weight). Maximal activities of phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, HAD, and creatine phosphokinase were diminished in transfers relative to controls, although hexokinase activity was significantly higher in the freely transferred gracilis muscles. During the 20-Hz contraction, muscle transfers produced less force initially, although the force/time integral over the 10-minute stimulation was similar in transfers (277 +/- 25 N/g/second) and controls (272 +/- 24 N/g/second). The contraction was associated with significant glvcogen use and lactate accumulation in both transfers and controls, although this was less pronounced for the transfers. Glycolytic flux appeared muted in the transfers relative to controls. Significant, similar high-energy phosphagen reductions and inosine monophosphate accumulation were noted during the contraction in both groups. Contractile activity is associated with the expected pattern of muscle metabolite changes following free vascularized transfer, indicating the components of cellular energy metabolism are not qualitatively altered after microneurovascular muscle transfer.

Differing from most birds studied, in adult male Rhea americana and several tinamous species the ureters were found to open into the coprodeum. In these species the urodeum receives only the vas deferens or oviduct. Similarly, in crocodiles Caiman crocodilus yacare, but not in lizards Tropidurus montanus and snakes Crotalus durissus terrificus, the ureters empty into the coprodeum. This similarity between ancient birds (ratites and tinamous) and crocodiles may indicate a primitive character linking reptiles and birds. This unusual position of the ureteral orifice can represent an adaptation to facilitate urine collection into the coprodeum and large intestine. Another possibility is that this variation in ureter position is a male reproductive strategy to avoid the mixture of urine and semen in the cloaca. There were no evident correlations between the location of the ureteral openings and the birds' habitat, diet, or histology of the coprodeal mucosa.

All 23 subjects had normal resting contrast echocardiograms without evidence of intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting. However, with cycle ergometer exercise, 21 of 23 (91%) of the subjects showed a delayed (>3 cardiac cycles) appearance of contrast bubbles in the left heart. This pattern is consistent with passage of contrast bubbles through the pulmonary circulation. Because the contrast bubbles are known to be significantly larger than pulmonary capillaries, we propose that they are traveling through direct arteriovenous intrapulmonary shunts. In all cases, the intrapulmonary shunting developed at submaximal oxygen uptakes [%maximal oxygen uptake = 59 +/- 20 (SD)] and once evident persisted at all subsequent work rates. Within 3 min of exercise termination, the contrast echocardiograms with bubble injection showed no evidence of intrapulmonary shunting.

Decalcified paraffin-embedded samples were then immunostained with the vascular endothelial marker CD 34. The quantification of endothelium as part of the whole cross section area was performed by means of a computerized optical method.\nThe extent of the pain sensation during discography ranged from 0-9 points on the VAS (average: 5.3 points, SD 3.1). On the histological quantification the total endothelial area per observed field varied from 0.04 to 7.39 % (average: 2.19 %, SD 1.62). The comparison of the pain extent on discography and the vascularization of the endplate resulted in a correlation coefficient after Spearman of rho = + 0.64 (p=0.0006).\nThe extent of vascularization in the degenerated endplates of a motion segment shows a moderate correlation with the self reported VAS scores after discography. Further investigations will have to clarify, whether neurogenic structures originating from vascular endothelium yield a better correlation to discogenic pain.", "journal": "Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und ihre Grenzgebiete", "date": "2004-04-24", "authors": ["MWeisskopf", "KBirnbaum", "MSagheri", "JLorenzen", "D CWirtz"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2004-818782"}

{"title": "Positive resection margins in partial penectomies: sites of involvement and proposal of local routes of spread of penile squamous cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Recurrence in patients with penile carcinoma occurs in about one third of cases, usually due to insufficient surgery or positive resection margins. An evaluation of surgical resection margins in penectomy specimens was performed to determine precise anatomic sites of tumor involvement, hoping to advance knowledge concerning the local routes of spread of penile carcinomas. A pathologic study of 80 partial penectomies revealed 14 positive margins. Margins were examined after their separation from the main specimen as follows: 1) proximal urethra and surrounding tissues consisting of urethral epithelium with Litree glands, lamina propria, corpus spongiosum, and penile fascia (periurethral cylinder); 2) proximal shaft with corresponding corpora cavernosa separated and surrounded by the tunica albuginea and penile fascia; and 3) skin of shaft with underlying corporal dartos. In 9 patients, only one site was involved by carcinoma, and in 5 there were multiple contiguous sites (for a total of 20 anatomic sites). The distribution of the various sites involved by carcinoma was as follows: urethral epithelium, 4 cases (2 in situ and 2 invasive carcinomas including intraluminal spread); lamina propria, 5 cases; corpus spongiosum, 3 cases; penile fascia, 6 cases; and corpora cavernosa and skin, 1 case each. One of the in situ lesions was discontinuous with the main glans tumor, and the other one was continuous with it. The penile fascia was the most commonly involved site followed by the urethral lamina propria and epithelium. Dissemination to outer skin, corpora cavernosa, and corpus spongiosum was less frequent. The highly vascularized and innervated loose connective tissue of the penile fascia appears to facilitate tumor spread. The urethra is either a pathway for in situ tumor progression from glans to urethra or part of a field prone to malignant transformation. The infrequent involvement of corpora cavernosa is probably due to the tunica albuginea acting as a barrier preventing tumor spread. Based on these observations and the examination of hundreds of penectomy specimens, we are proposing five probable routes of local spread for penile cancer: 1) horizontal and superficially spreading from one epithelial mucosal compartment (glans, coronal sulcus, and foreskin) to the other; 2) following the penile fascia; 3) through spaces created by feeding vessels in the tunica albuginea; 4) vertical spreading involving step-by-step different penile anatomic compartments; and 5) along the urethral epithelium.", "journal": "The American journal of surgical pathology", "date": "2004-04-24", "authors": ["Elsa FVelazquez", "AnaSoskin", "AdelaidaBock", "RicardoCodas", "Jose EBarreto", "Antonio LCubilla"], "doi": "10.1097/00000478-200403000-00012"}

The three diameters of the lesion were recorded; then the shape, margins, content (solid or cystic), and location were analyzed. A subjective assessment of the vascularization (vascular score) was obtained with power Doppler.\nTwenty-six patients had pelvic recurrence from endometrial cancer and 19 from cervical cancer. In 36 (80%) patients, the recurrence was a central pelvic mass located on the vaginal apex, while in six cases (13%), it was diagnosed as a pelvic side-wall recurrence, and in three (7%), the recurrence occupied the whole pelvis. The recurrences had diameters ranging from 1.0 to 6.8 cm (mean diameter: 3.0 cm, standard deviation: 1.5). In 44/45 cases (98%), the recurrence appeared as a solid nodular mass, while in one case (2%), it was defined as a cystic mass. In 32 (71%) women, the mass showed a hypoechoic content with respect to the surrounding bowel, while in 13 (29%), it manifested a nonhomogeneous content. Vascularization of the mass was assessed in all patients before surgery; in all cases, it was possible to visualize randomly dispersed blood vessels in the context of the relapse. The vascular score revealed scarce blood vessels in 19 relapses, moderate flow in 23, and abundant flow in three cases.\nKnowledge of the spectrum of ultrasonographic findings of pelvic relapses will help the physician in diagnosing a recurrent malignant disease at an early stage, when cure rates are high.

{"title": "Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances.", "abstract": "The cryopreservation of organs became an active area of research in the 1950s as a result of the rediscovery of the cryoprotective properties of glycerol by Polge, Smith, and Parkes in 1949. Over the ensuing four decades of research in this area, the advantages of vitrification, or ice-free cryopreservation, have become apparent. To date, experimental attempts to apply vitrification methods to vascularized whole organs have been confined almost entirely to the rabbit kidney. Using techniques available as of 1997, it was possible to vitrify blood vessels and smaller systems with reasonable success, but not whole organs. Beginning in 1998, a series of novel advances involving the control of cryoprotectant toxicity, nucleation, crystal growth, and chilling injury began to provide the tools needed to achieve success. Based on these new findings, we were first able to show that an 8.4M solution (VMP) designed to prevent chilling injury at -22 degrees C was entirely non-toxic to rabbit kidneys when perfused at -3 degrees C and permitted perfusion-cooling to -22 degrees C with only mild additional damage. We next investigated the ability of the kidney to tolerate a 9.3M solution known as M22, which does not devitrify when warmed from below -150 degrees C at 1 degrees C/min. When M22 was added and removed at -22 degrees C, it was sometimes [corrected] fatal, but when it was perfused for 25min at -22 degrees C and washed out simultaneously with warming, postoperative renal function recovered fully. When kidneys loaded with M22 at -22 degrees C were further cooled to an average intrarenal temperature of about -45 degrees C (about halfway through the putative temperature zone of increasing vulnerability to chilling injury), all kidneys supported life after transplantation and returned creatinine values to baseline, though after a higher transient creatinine peak. However, medullary, papillary, and pelvic biopsies taken from kidneys perfused with M22 for 25min at -22 degrees C were found to devitrify when vitrified and rewarmed at 20 degrees C/min in a differential scanning calorimeter.

{"title": "Hypoxia-activated tumor pathways of angiogenesis and pH regulation independent of anemia in head-and-neck cancer.", "abstract": "Anemia is considered a major factor that counteracts the efficacy of radiotherapy, presumably because of reduced oxygen availability that leads to tumor hypoxia. Nevertheless, anemia is not the only factor defining oxygen availability, because a poor and/or immature vascular network may prevent blood flow and tumor oxygenation. Furthermore, the ability of tumors to upregulate hypoxia-regulated molecular pathways may affect radiosensitivity by mechanisms independent of the traditional concept of \"oxygen effect.\"\nIn this study, we investigated whether the preoperative blood hemoglobin levels affect the activation status of hypoxia/angiogenic pathways (hypoxia inducible factors [HIF1 alpha and HIF2 alpha], carbonic anhydrase 9, differentiated embryo-chondrocyte protein, vascular endothelial growth factor, and microvessel density), in squamous cell head-and-neck cancer.\nHypoxia/angiogenesis pathways were equally activated in tumors, independent of the patient's hemoglobin levels. The expression of HIF alphas was associated with microvessel density (p = 0.01).\nIn the present study, we failed to show that a patient's anemia is a main contributor to the activation of hypoxia-regulated molecular pathways in squamous cell head-and-neck cancer. Impaired intratumoral blood flow or tumor-related gene/protein pathologic features may account for this finding. Targeting the hypoxia-regulated molecular cascade emerged as a complementary radiosensitization strategy for a large group of patients with hypoxic tumors, who are unlikely to benefit from conventional approaches aiming to improve intratumoral oxygen delivery through anemia correction.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2004-04-20", "authors": ["Michael IKoukourakis", "AlexandraGiatromanolaki", "EfthimiosSivridis", "JaromirPastorek", "IliasKarapantzos", "Kevin CGatter", "Adrian LHarris", "NoneNone"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.10.016"}

We hypothesized that echocardiographic contrast perfusion imaging would differentiate the neo-vascularization of malignancies from the avascularity of thrombi and the sparse vascularity of stromal tumors.\nSixteen patients with cardiac masses underwent power-modulation imaging after echocardiographic intravenous contrast administration. Pixel intensities in the mass and an adjacent section of myocardium were analyzed visually and by dedicated software. All masses had a pathologic diagnosis or resolved after anticoagulation. In a subset of patients, video-intensity curves of contrast replenishment in the mass and myocardium over time were generated. The post-impulse steady-state pixel intensity (A) and initial rate of contrast replenishment after impulse (beta) were compared with an index of blood vessel area on pathology.\nIn seven of 16 patients, contrast enhancement resulted in greater pixel intensity in the mass than in the adjacent myocardium. All of these masses were classified pathologically as malignant (n = 6) or benign and vascular (n = 1). Nine masses demonstrated decreased pixel intensity, compared with the myocardium, and were diagnosed pathologically as myxomas (n = 2) or thrombi (n = 5), or they resolved with anticoagulation (n = 2).

VAI is originally part of the adenovirus genome, and is characterized by high transcription rates, good stability due to its strong secondary structure and cytoplasmic localization. Transfection of U87 human glioblastoma cells with plasmid vectors encoding for this ribozyme resulted in a strong (-56%) reduction of VEGF secreted in the extracellular medium, indicating a good biological activity of the ribozyme.

When primary closure fails, conventional wisdom and the standard of care suggest local flap techniques for defect closure. For the large majority of patients, this approach is successful. There is, however, a small subset of patients who undergo multiple surgical procedures in unsuccessful attempts to close recalcitrant fistulae, particularly at the anterior, densely scarred, hard palate. In this setting, repair calls for the introduction of well-vascularized pliable tissue to close the defect and to avoid hampering further palatal growth. Local muscle flaps and oral axial pattern flaps have been advocated and used successfully. However, those approaches have their own drawbacks, such as multiple surgical interventions, patient compliance, and intraoral scarring. In an effort to avoid the problems associated with local flaps, distant microvascular tissue transfers were investigated. During a 6-year period, six free-tissue transfers were performed as a primary means of treating recalcitrant palatal fistulae. Three dorsalis pedis flaps and three osseous angular scapular flaps were used. The conditions of all patients improved, with five patients achieving complete long-term closure of the palatal defect. This experience indicates that modern microvascular techniques have reached a level of success commensurate with that of other flap techniques; therefore, it is concluded that free-tissue transfer should be considered as a primary means of addressing these difficult cleft problems.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-04-15", "authors": ["Anton HSchwabegger", "EricHubli", "MichaelRieger", "RobertGassner", "AnnetteSchmidt", "MilomirNinkovic"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000110370.67325.ed"}

We studied the therapeutic action of an angiostatic fragment of human thrombospondin 1 (named TSP1ang) on experimental glioma tumor growth. TSP1ang (enclosing amino acids 167-569) comprised the procollagen-homology domain and the three type I repeats of the original molecule. C6 glioma cells that stably express TSP1ang were generated, and their rate of in vitro growth did not appear to differ from that of C6 cells transfected with an empty plasmid. TSP1ang-expressing C6 cells were then injected either subcutaneously or intracerebrally into nude mice. The resulting tumors appeared to be less vascularized, but unexpectedly started to grow earlier and had a much more invasive phenotype than tumors derived from control C6 cells. They were also much more aggressive, since the mice bearing intracerebral TSP1ang-expressing tumor cells died before day 19 post-implantation, whereas all mice bearing control C6 tumors were alive at this time point. These results indicate that careful attention should be paid at designing smaller fragments from the multimodular angiostatic molecule TSP1 since, as observed in this study, it may unmask protumorigenic properties that counteract its antiangiogenic activity.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2004-04-13", "authors": ["Florencede Fraipont", "MichelleKeramidas", "MichelleEl Atifi", "Edmond MChambaz", "Fran\u00e7oisBerger", "Jean-JacquesFeige"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1207438"}

The incision was either sealed with ADAL bioadhesive, hydrated with balanced salt solution, or closed with 10-0 nylon surgical sutures. The incisions underwent weekly tensile strength testing and clinical, histopathologic, and confocal microscopy evaluations.\nClinical evaluation revealed good sealing and no incision leakage in any group. There was no anterior chamber reaction in any case. Compared with the hydrated group, there was somewhat more incisional vascularization and localized corneal opacity in the ADAL group, but there were no cases of severe corneal opacity or neovascularization. On histologic analysis, a slightly larger inflammatory reaction was noted in the ADAL group compared with the hydrated group. Tensile strength during the first week was statistically significantly greater in the ADAL group (2.93 Newtons) than in the control groups (1.40 Newtons, hydrated group; 1.43 Newtons, sutured group) (P < 0.001). Confocal microscopy study revealed a unique dendritic keratocyte shape and structure resembling shiny crystalline particles after disappearance of the adhesive from the cornea.\nCorneal surgical incisions sealed with ADAL adhesive have superior tensile strength in the first postoperative week compared with incisions closed with sutures or hydrated with salt solution.

Adequate skin coverage and fascia repair of the abdominal wall is necessary for achieving acceptable results. The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach to abdominal wall reconstruction using a free vascularized composite anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap with fascia lata.\nSeven patients with large full-thickness abdominal wall defects were successfully reconstructed by means of a composite ALT flap combined with vascularized fascia lata. The size of the skin islands ranged from 20 to 32 cm in length and 10 to 22 cm in width, and the vascularized fascia lata sheath measured 14 to 28 cm and 8 to 18 cm, respectively. Functional outcome of the abdominal wall strength and donor thigh morbidity were investigated by using a Cybex kinetic dynamometer.\nAll flaps survived. No postoperative ventral hernia occurred except for one mild inguinal incision hernia. Subjectively there were no significant donor site problems. Objective assessment was performed in 4 patients 2 years postoperatively. In the reconstructed abdomen, isokinetic concentric and eccentric measurements of extension/flexion ratios of the abdominal wall strength showed no apparent decrease compared with other references. Functional evaluation of quadriceps femoris muscle contraction forces after free ALT composite flap harvest showed an averaged deficit of 30% as compared with the contralateral legs.

Treatment of atrophic acne scars includes different invasive methods. In our study, we used a noninvasive method with local application of 0.05% tretinoin gel by iontophoresis. In patients with a tendency towards exacerbation, we performed mild peeling with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution 3-4 times during the treatment. Twenty-minute treatments were applied on 38 patients, 29 women and 9 men, during 3.5 months on average. Median age of patients was 21 years (range, 16-29). Clinical assessment included an assessment of scars, pore size, skin moisture, vascularization, and skin firmness and elasticity. As confirmed by photographs taken before and after therapy, the treatment proved to be clinically effective in decreasing acne scars and persistence of effects. Flattening of acne scars was observed in 79% of the patients. The results depended on duration of scars persistence as well as on a the type of scars. The best results were achieved with younger scars as well as with superficial and ice pick scars. Side effects involved a very mild retinoid dermatitis and more often acne exacerbation. The therapy was clinically effective and the patients accepted the treatment very easily.

{"title": "VEGFA is necessary for chondrocyte survival during bone development.", "abstract": "To directly examine the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in cartilage development, we conditionally knocked out Vegfa in chondrocytes, using the Col2a1 promoter to drive expression of Cre recombinase. Our study of Vegfa conditional knockout (CKO) mice provides new in-vivo evidence for two important functions of VEGFA in bone formation. First, VEGFA plays a significant role in both early and late stages of cartilage vascularization, since Vegfa CKO mice showed delayed invasion of blood vessels into primary ossification centers and delayed removal of terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes. Second, VEGFA is crucial for chondrocyte survival, since massive cell death was seen in joint and epiphyseal regions of Vegfa CKO endochondral bones. Chondrocytes in these regions were found to upregulate expression of Vegfa in wild-type mice at the time when massive cell death occurred in the Vegfa CKO mice. The expression of the VEGFA receptors Npr1 and Npr2 in epiphyseal chondrocytes and lack of blood vessel reduction in the vicinity of the cartilaginous elements in the Vegfa CKO mice raise the possibility that the observed cell death is the result of a direct involvement of VEGFA in chondrocyte survival. Interestingly, the extensive cell death seen in Vegfa CKO null bones had a striking similarity to the cell death phenotype observed when hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1a) expression was abolished in developing cartilage. This similarity of cell death phenotypes and the deficient VEGFA production in Hif1a null epiphyseal chondrocytes demonstrate that HIF1 alpha and VEGFA are components of a key pathway to support chondrocyte survival during embryonic bone development.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2004-04-10", "authors": ["ElazarZelzer", "RoniMamluk", "NapoleoneFerrara", "Randall SJohnson", "ErnestinaSchipani", "Bjorn ROlsen"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.01053"}

Thalidomide exhibits antiangiogenic activity and may provide additive or synergistic antitumor effects when given concurrently with temozolomide, an alkylating agent. To further evaluate this new concept of combining an antiangiogenic with an alkylating agent, efficacy and tolerability of thalidomide alone and in combination with temozolomide were explored in a single-institution, nonrandomized open-label phase II study.\nForty-four patients with GBMs, who received thalidomide for a period of at least three months, were evaluated for survival, time to tumor progression (TTP), and side effects. Microsurgical tumor extirpation and radiotherapy preceded chemotherapy. Nineteen patients (43%) received thalidomide only (T), and 25 patients (57%) had a combined chemotherapy of thalidomide and temozolomide (TT). Median thalidomide dosage was 200 mg/day. Median temozolomide dosage was 200 mg/m2/day for five days, in monthly cycles. Neuroradiological outcomes were assessed by a semiquantitative grading system.\nMedian survival was 103 weeks (95% CI, 65-141 weeks) for TT-patients and 63 weeks (95% CI, 49-77 weeks) for T-patients (p < 0.01). Median TTP for the TT-group was 36 weeks (95% CI, 20-52 weeks) and 17 weeks (95% CI, 13-21 weeks) for the T-group (p < 0.06). Neuroradiologically, 14 patients (56%) of the TT-group and six (32%) of the T-group had evidence of stable disease on at least two successive neuroradiological follow-ups. Progressive disease was found in nine patients (36%) of the TT-group and in 13 (68%) of the T-group. In two patients (8%) of the TT-group, a response with tumor regression was found. Thalidomide and concurrent temozolomide were safe and well tolerated with mild to moderate toxicities.\nThe combination of thalidomide and temozolomide in the treatment of GBM appears to be more effective than that of thalidomide alone with respect to survival, TTP, and neuroradiological documentation of progression, stable disease or response.

{"title": "Functional significance of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor expression on human glioma cells.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most important angiogenesis factors. In many tumors, VEGF plays a pivotal role for their vascularization and is necessary to supply the malignant tissue with oxygen and nutrients. However, VEGF receptors (VEGFR) have recently been detected also on some tumor cells, and autocrine mitogenic effects of VEGF have been suspected. Since glioma cells are known to produce large amounts of VEGF, we investigated VEGFR-expression and effects of VEGF on glioma cells. The three glioma cell lines and eight glioma cells cultivated from WHO grade IV gliomas investigated strongly expressed VEGF121 and VEGF165, but weakly either VEGFR-1 or -2, sometimes for both, as evidenced by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed a 1000- to 50-fold lower expression of VEGFR than in cultivated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In two glioma cell lines analyzed, VEGF induced a weak tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGFR, but downstream signal transduction effects on the mitogen-activated protein kinases p42/p44 or transcription factors like AP-1 or NFKB were within the background of the methods. In accordance, VEGF or the VEGFR agonists VEGF-D or placenta growth factor (P1GF) did not produce significant effects on glioma cell proliferation or VEGF production. We conclude that despite a low expression of VEGFR in some glioma cells functional effects are low and autocrine growth stimulatory effects within a glioma are minor.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2004-04-10", "authors": ["RolfMentlein", "FraukeForstreuter", "Hubertus MMehdorn", "JankaHeld-Feindt"], "doi": "10.1023/b:neon.0000021737.89357.cc"}

However, the side effects of GH have been poorly defined. In this study we determined the effect of GH on wound repair and its mechanisms of action at the wound site. For this purpose, we performed wound healing studies in transgenic mice overexpressing GH. Full thickness incisional and excisional wounds of transgenic animals developed extensive, highly vascularized granulation tissue. However, wound bursting strength was not increased. Wound closure was strongly delayed as a result of enhanced granulation tissue formation and impaired wound contraction. The latter effect is most likely due to a significantly reduced number of myofibroblasts at the wound site. By using in vitro studies with stressed collagen lattices, we identified GH as an inhibitor of transforming growth factor beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation, resulting in a reduction in fibroblast contractile activity. These results revealed novel roles of GH in angiogenesis and myofibroblast differentiation, which are most likely not mediated via insulin-like growth factors at the wound site.

In all patients the tumors were located in the thoracic region, and the most common entity was vertebral body metastasis (six cases), with renal cell carcinoma being the most common form of the disease (three cases).

The most common presentation was overt cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, manifesting as chest tube drainage (four cases) or as leakage through the wound (one case). A definitive diagnosis of SPF was established in four patients, with evidence of extraspinal leakage on an 111In-radionuclide CSF study. Although all patients initially underwent a trial of lumbar CSF drainage, all but one required open repair, including creation of intercostal muscle (three cases) and omental (one case) flaps.\nAfter spinal surgery in which the thorax is entered, a diagnosis of SPF should be considered in any patient with abnormal chest tube output, persistent pleural effusion, or clinical evidence of intracranial hypotension. The diagnosis should be confirmed by performing a radionuclide-labeled CSF study.

Tyrp1-Tag mice that develop early vascularized tumors of the retinal pigment epithelium were crossed with tyrp1-FGFR1-DN mice that express dominant-negative FGF receptors in the retinal pigment epithelium to generate bigenic mice. Initial angiogenesis-independent tumor growth progressed equally in tyrp1-Tag and bigenic mice with no significant differences in the number of dividing and apoptotic cells within the tumor. By contrast, at a later stage when tyrp1-Tag tumors rapidly expanded to fill the entire eye posterior chamber and migrate along the optic nerve toward the chiasma, bigenic tumors remained small and were poorly vascularized. Secondary tumors of small size developed in only 20% of bigenic mice by 1 month. Immunohistochemical analysis of secondary tumors from bigenic mice showed a reduction of angiogenesis and an increase in apoptosis in tumor cells. Tumor cells from bigenic mice expressed high levels of truncated FGF receptors and did not induce endothelial tube formation in vitro. All in all, this indicates that the tyrp1-Tag mouse may be a useful model to study selective tumor inhibition and the effect of antitumor therapy that targets a specific growth factor pathway.

{"title": "Identification of the CREB-binding protein/p300-interacting protein CITED2 as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha coregulator.", "abstract": "Like other nuclear receptors, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) use a wide variety of protein-protein interactions to properly regulate transcription of target genes. In an attempt to identify novel PPAR-interacting proteins, a cDNA expression library was screened with bacterially expressed PPARalpha. One of the genes identified as a PPARalpha-associated protein by interaction cloning was the CREB-binding protein/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail 2 (CITED2, also called p35srj/mrg1/msg1). This coactivator interacted directly with PPARalpha in the presence or absence of ligand predominantly via the ligand binding domain of the nuclear receptor. In transient transfection reporter assays, CITED2 acted as a dose-dependent coactivator of PPARalpha-dependent transcriptional regulation in the presence of several exogenous ligands. CITED2 also increased PPARgamma-dependent regulation of reporter genes but had no effect on PPARbeta activity. To determine whether CITED2 affects endogenous gene expression, this protein was stably overexpressed (CITED2+) or repressed by small inhibitor RNA (CITED2-) in immortalized mouse hepatocytes. Relative to the control stably transfected or CITED2-cells, CITED2+ cells had an increased rate of cell proliferation. Microarray analysis and real time PCR showed that several genes are differentially affected by PPARalpha ligands in CITED2+ versus CITED2-cells. Genes that were affected by PPARalpha ligands in a CITED2-modulatory manner include angiopoietin-like protein 4, forkhead C2, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, and MAPK phosphatase 1. Interestingly these genes share common functions in that they are known to promote vascularization and angiogenesis in response to hypoxia.

By using a procedure to harvest fresh choroidal tissue, we studied some basic characteristics of the adenylyl (AC) and guanylyl cyclase (GC) enzyme systems in this tissue using the 3H-cAMP/32P-ATP tracer method. Compared to respective baseline measurements (100+/-SEM%), AC activity was stimulated (p < 0.05) by forskolin (FSK, 477+/-59%), fluoroaluminate (AlF(4), 360+/-10.3%), isoproterenol (ISO, 129+/-5.5%), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP, 132+/-6.1%), calmodulin (CAM)+Mn2+ (196+/-69%), and dose-dependently by prostaglandin (PG) E2 (up to 162+/-3.6%). The antagonist drug calmidazolium inhibited the CAM-dependent increase but also blocked basal activity (47+/-2.0%) without affecting the FSK response. Other CAM blockers (TFP, W5) produced similar results but were not completely selective for CAM-activated cyclase. GDPbetaS, a blocker of G-protein coupling to AC did not affect AC responses to FSK, ISO, and AlF4, but decreased the response to PGE2.

{"title": "Concomitant reconstruction of mandibular basal and alveolar bone with a free fibular flap.", "abstract": "Repair of long-span mandibular defects with a free fibular flap is now a routine procedure. However, the bone height of the neo-mandible after reconstruction with a fibular flap is about half that of the dentulous mandible. When a fibular graft is placed only at the inferior border of the mandible, the resulting vertical discrepancy between the graft segment and the occlusal plane can adversely affect implant mechanics or denture stability and retention. To overcome these problems, we developed a technique for two-strut type mandibular reconstruction. A vascularized fibular segment is used to reconstruct the inferior basal portion of the neo-mandible, while a non-vascularized residual fibular segment is used to simulate the superior alveolar portion. We used this technique in 22 patients. Graft survival, graft resorption, and the ability to place implants were assessed as compared with those after the conventional one-strut type technique. The fibular segment grafted to the alveolar region was removed in one patient with intraoral wound dehiscence and in two with postoperative infection. All vascularized fibular flaps were successful. The resorption rate was 13.6+/-7.2% for non-vascularized segments and 3.0+/-3.7% for vascularized segments. Dental implants were placed in five of our 22 patients. The crown:fixture length ratio was improved to 1:1.7, as compared with a ratio of 1:1.21 with use of a conventional fibular flap.

Recent evidence indicates that a hypoxic environment such as that encountered in tumor masses regulates BMSC angiogenic properties by pathways that remain to be defined. It is also unclear as to what extent these marrow-derived precursor cells could contribute to the growth of endothelium-lined vessels at the vicinity of tumor masses. In this study, we found that BMSC exhibited the ability to generate three-dimensional capillary-like networks on Matrigel, and that this property was up-regulated by growth factors-enriched conditioned media isolated from several tumor-derived cell lines. In particular, basic fibroblast growth factor, a key mediator of angiogenesis, was found to be the most potent growth factor for inducing BMSC proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis. The setup of a new two-dimensional in vitro co-culture assay further showed that BMSC were massively recruited when cultured in the presence of either cancerous or differentiated EC lines. In vivo, subcutaneous co-injection of BMSC with U-87 glioma cells in nude mice resulted in the formation of highly vascularized tumors, where BMSC differentiated into CD31-positive cells and localized at the lumen of vascular structures. Our data suggest that BMSC could be recruited at the sites of active tumor neovascularization through paracrine regulation of their angiogenic properties.

{"title": "Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor production in islets improves islet graft vascularization.", "abstract": "Successful islet transplantation depends on the infusion of sufficiently large quantities of islets, of which only approximately 30% become stably engrafted. Rapid and adequate revascularization of transplanted islets is important for islet survival and function. Delayed and insufficient revascularization can deprive islets of oxygen and nutrients, resulting in islet cell death and early graft failure. To improve islet revascularization, we delivered human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) cDNA to murine islets, followed by transplantation under the renal capsule in diabetic mice. Diabetic animals receiving a marginal mass of 300 islets that were pretransduced with a VEGF vector exhibited near normoglycemia. In contrast, diabetic mice receiving an equivalent number of islets that were transduced with a control vector remained hyperglycemic. Immunohistochemistry with anti-insulin and anti-CD31 antibodies revealed a relatively higher insulin content and greater degree of microvasculature in the VEGF vector-transduced islet grafts, which correlated with significantly improved blood glucose profiles and enhanced insulin secretion in response to glucose challenge in this group of diabetic recipient mice. These results demonstrate that VEGF production in islets stimulates graft angiogenesis and enhances islet revascularization.

H&E staining was performed on tumors, along with Ki67 staining for cell proliferation and immunohistochemical terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling and CD31 analysis. Rapamycin-treated tumor vessels were also directly examined in dorsal skin-fold chambers for blood flow after thrombosis induction. Cell death in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was assessed by flow cytometry after annexin-V staining.\nRapamycin therapy alone inhibited tumor growth and metastasis more than gemcitabine, with remarkable long-term tumor control when the drugs were combined. Mechanistically, H&E analysis revealed tumor vessel endothelium damage and thrombosis with rapamycin treatment. Indeed, dorsal skin-fold chamber analysis of rapamycin-treated tumors showed an increased susceptibility of tumor-specific vessels to thrombosis. Furthermore, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling/CD31 double staining of orthotopic tumors demonstrated apoptotic endothelial cells with rapamycin treatment, which also occurred with human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. In contrast, gemcitabine was not antiangiogenic and, despite its known cytotoxicity, did not reduce proliferation in orthotopic tumors; nevertheless, rapamycin did reduce tumor proliferation.\nOur data suggest a novel mechanism whereby rapamycin targets pancreatic tumor endothelium for destruction and thrombosis.

Unfortunately, the cosmetic and functional complications that arise from postoperative muscular atrophy can be severe. Proper function of the muscle depends on proper innervation, vascularization, muscle tension, and the integrity of muscle fibers. In this study the authors describe the anatomy of the temporal muscle and report technical nuances that can be used to prevent its postoperative atrophy.\nThis study was designed to determine the susceptibility of the temporal muscle to injury during common surgical dissection. The authors studied the anatomy of the muscle and its vascularization and innervation in seven cadavers. A zygomatic osteotomy was performed followed by downward mobilization of the temporal muscle by using subperiosteal dissection, which preserved the muscle and allowed a study of its arterial and neural components. The temporal muscle is composed of a main portion and three muscle bundles. The muscle is innervated by the deep temporal nerves, which branch from the anterior division of the mandibular nerve. Blood is supplied through a rich anastomotic connection between the deep temporal arteries (anterior and posterior) on the medial side and the middle temporal artery (a branch of the superficial temporal artery [STA]) on the lateral side.\nBased on these anatomical findings, the authors recommend the following steps to preserve the temporal muscle: 1) preserve the STA; 2) prevent injury to the facial branches by using subfascial dissection; 3) use a zygomatic osteotomy to avoid compressing the muscle, arteries, and nerves, and for greater exposure when retracting the muscle; 4) dissect the muscle in subperiosteal retrograde fashion to preserve the deep vessels and nerves; 5) deinsert the muscle to the superior temporal line without cutting the fascia; and 6) reattach the muscle directly to the bone.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2004-03-24", "authors": ["Paulo A SKadri", "OssamaAl-Mefty"], "doi": "10.3171/jns.2004.100.3.0517"}

A similar correlation was found with the grade of peritumoral edema identified on preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scanning (p < 0.0001) or T2-weighted MR imaging sequences (p < 0.00001) and tumor pial vascularization as seen on angiography (p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the tumor-parenchyma interface on preoperative T2-weighted MR imaging sequences was not predictive of the surgical plane (p > 0.5). The worst clinical outcome was found in the tumors located in eloquent areas and in which a subpial plane was encountered at surgery (p = 0.03).\nPeritumoral edema on preoperative CT and MR studies and tumor pial vascularization as seen on selective angiography can be used to predict the surgical plane of cleavage in meningiomas. The association between tumor size and a subpial surgical plane may be explained by a more pial vascularization seen on angiography. Meningiomas with a location in eloquent cortex and a subpial dissection plane should be considered a high-risk group.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2004-03-24", "authors": ["Jorge EAlvernia", "Marc PSindou"], "doi": "10.3171/jns.2004.100.3.0422"}
{"title": "Nutrition pathways to the symphysis pubis.", "abstract": "The blood supply of the symphysis pubis is still the subject of some debate. Classic anatomy books state that this joint is avascular, whereas some published works have shown blood vessels in young specimens. As several articular discs such as the knee menisci are known to have blood vessels in their peripheries, we decided to investigate the possible nutrition pathways to the interpubic disc and ligaments. We used 60 Wistar rats, male and female, aged between 28 and 32 days, or between 90 and 100 days. Samples were processed using a variety of techniques: regular histology, immunohistochemestry, India ink injection and corrosion casting. The interpubic disc consisted of an inner bearing portion and an outer fibrous rim. The interpubic ligaments and the fibrous rim were well vascularized in all groups. Marrow contacts between the interpubic disc and the subchondral bone were also observed. Blood vessels formed an authentic arterial circle embracing the joint, from which blood vessels branched into capillary loops facing the avascular inner bearing portion of the disc. These results confirm the need for future studies on the human symphysis pubis, to provide more details on its structure, which would enable clinicians such as physiotherapists to improve prognosis and treatment design.

We show that Cyr61 can enhance tumorigenicity of glioma cells acting through activated integrin-linked kinase (ILK) to stimulate beta-catenin-TCF/Lef and Akt signaling pathways. Overexpression of Cyr61 occurred in highly tumorigenic glioma cell lines and in 68% of the most malignant glioblastoma multiforme brain tumors. Forced expression of Cyr61 in U343 glioma cells accelerated their growth in liquid culture, enhanced their anchorage-independent proliferation in soft agar, and significantly increased their ability to form large, vascularized tumors in nude mice. Overexpression of Cyr61 in the U343 cells led to the up-regulation of distinct integrins, including beta1 and alphanubeta3, which have been shown to interact with Cyr61 and ILK. The activity of ILK was increased dramatically in these cells. Overexpression of Cyr61 also resulted in the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and accumulation and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, leading to activation of the beta-catenin-TCF/Lef-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, forced expression of Cyr61 in the glioma cells activated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway, resulting in prominent phosphorylation of Akt and the antiapoptotic protein Bad.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of newly developed monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against TIRC7 in acute cardiac allograft rejection. Fully vascularized heterotopic allogeneic heart transplantation was performed in mice across a full-mismatch barrier (C57Bl/10 into CBA). Recipients received seven injections (day 0-7) of a novel anti-TIRC7 mAb or remained untreated. Graft survival, histology and ex vivo lymphocyte functions were tested. Targeting of TIRC7 with an anti-TIRC7 mAb diminishes lymphocyte infiltration into grafts resulting in delay of morphological graft damage and prolongation of allograft survival. The lymphocytes from anti-TIRC7 mAb-treated animals exhibit hypo-responsiveness without evidence of lymphocyte depletion against the donor allo-antigens. Proliferation and expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were down-regulated while interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 expression were spared. Moreover, anti-TIRC7 mAb enhanced up-regulation of CTLA-4 expression but suppressed up-regulation of CD25 on stimulated lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. Ligation of TIRC7 has important effects on the regulation of co-stimulatory signaling pathways associated with suppressing of T-cell activation.

Exogenous FGF-2 promoted formation of morphologically distinct, long slender vessels in the embryoid bodies, whereas VEGF-A-treated bodies displayed a compact plexus of capillaries. FGF-2 stimulation of embryonal stem cells under conditions where VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 function was blocked, led to formation of endothelial cell clusters, which failed to develop into vessels. FGFR-1(-/-) embryoid bodies responded to VEGF-A by establishment of the characteristic vascular plexus, but FGF-2 had no effect on vascular development in the absence of FGFR-1. The FGFR-1(-/-) embryoid bodies displayed considerably increased basal level of vessel formation, detected by immunohistochemical staining for platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)/CD31. This basal vascularization was blocked by neutralizing antibodies against VEGFR-2 or VEGF-A and biochemical analyses indicated changes in regulation of VEGFR-2 in the absence of FGFR-1 expression.

{"title": "Models for angiogenesis in gliomas.", "abstract": "During the last decades a lot of attention has been focussed on mechanisms of glioma vascularization, particularly in terms of investigating vascular growth factors and receptors. Recently, these efforts resulted in various approaches for antiangiogenic treatment strategies using in vitro cell culture systems as well as experimental orthotopic and non-orthotopic brain tumors. These basic science and preclinical trials need an assortment of models, which should allow investigating a variety of questions. Several objectives concerning basic endothelial cell (EC) characteristics can adequately be studied in vitro using EC monolayer assays. Three-dimensional spheroid techniques respect the more complex cell-cell and cell-environment interplay within a 3-dimensional culture. Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques offer a wide access to the genome of EC. Using these micro array or chip methods differences between micro- and macromolecular EC as well as variations within the gene pool of different organ specific EC can be assessed. To optimize the imitation of the crucial interaction of human gliomas with host endothelial cells, immunological cells and extracellular matrix, animal models are mandatory. An essential rule is to utilize an orthotopic model, since tumor-host-interaction is organ specific. To avoid alloimmunogenic responses, it is desirable to use weak or non-immunogenic glioma grafts, which is best accomplished in a syngeneic model. However, since rat gliomas poorly resemble human glioma growth patterns, human glioma xenografting into immunocompromized animals should be considered. In vivo-monitoring techniques like videoscopy via a cranial window or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow for functional studies and improve the validity of the model employed. Finally, it is essentially to recognize the limitations of each model considered and to select that model which seems to be most appropriate for the objectives to be investigated.", "journal": "Cancer treatment and research", "date": "2004-03-16", "authors": ["Roland HGoldbrunner", "MartinBendszus", "J\u00f6rg-ChristianTonn"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4419-8871-3_6"}
{"title": "Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Two distinct mechanisms, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis implement the formation of the vascular network in the embryo. Vasculogenesis gives rise to the heart and the first primitive vascular plexus inside the embryo and in its surrounding membranes, as the yolk sac circulation. Angiogenesis is responsible for the remodeling and expansion of this network. While vasculogenesis refers to in situ differentiation and growth of blood vessels from mesodermal derived hemangioblasts, angiogenesis comprises two different mechanisms: endothelial sprouting and intussusceptive microvascular growth (IMG). The sprouting process is based on endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation. IMG divides existing vessel lumens by formation and insertion of tissue folds and columns of interstitial tissue into the vessel lumen. The latter are termed interstitial or intervascular tissue structures (ITSs) and tissue pillars or posts. Intussusception also includes the establishment of new vessels by in situ loop formation in the wall of large veins. The molecular regulation of these distinct mechanisms is discussed in respect to the most important positive regulators, VEGF and its receptors flk-1 (KDR) and flt-1, the Angiopoietin/tie system and the ephrin-B/EpH-B system.

We then examined eruption of the lower first molar in the grafted mandibular bone and compared the results clinically, radiographically, and histologically.\nNormal tooth eruption was observed in the transplanted mandibles in the young dogs. In the mature dogs, eruption from the gingiva was delayed, whereas that from alveolar bone occurred normally in the transplanted mandibles. Further, the whole crown was covered with a cap of gingival tissue in the mature dogs, although this cap was not gingival overgrowth.\nTooth eruption is influenced by some unknown factors related to aging.

The innervation of the transplanted ileum mucosa was reduced as the number of nerve fibers in the mucosal villi was decreased. Besides these neuromorphologic changes the transplanted mucosa showed a slightly higher rate of shortened villi compared to normal ileum mucosa.\nAfter ileum mucosa transplantation the submucosal ganglia are smaller and less numerous.

After fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde the samples were frozen (-40 degrees C) and 14 micro m sections were stained with hemalaun and eosin. The lumen diameter, the mucosa, submucosa and colon muscle coat thickness, as well as the mucosal crypt depth were evaluated.\nThe diameter of the colon coat-ileum mucosa-complex was smaller than the diameter of normal ileum and colon with no significant stenosis. There were no marked differences in thickness of mucosa and depth of the mucosal crypts compared to the controls, but the transplanted mucosa showed a slightly higher rate of shortened villi. The submucosal layer was thicker following transplantation and showed good neovascularization. The circular muscle layer of the transplanted colon coat was up to 178% thicker and the thickness of the transplanted longitudinal muscle layer differed between 58% and 143% in comparison to normal colon.\nOnly a few histologic differences between transplanted and normal ileum mucosa could be observed after autologous-allotopic ileum mucosa transplantation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether local overexpression of endostatin could serve to diminish tumor growth of bladder cancer in vivo.\nWe examined the capability of lentiviral-mediated gene transfer in vitro and therapeutic effects of lentivirus-based vectors expressing endostatin on tumor growth using an orthotopic human bladder tumor model.\nWe found that self-inactivating lentivirus vectors containing green fluorescent protein, alone or in combination with endostatin, were capable of efficient and stable gene transfer to a variety of human bladder tumor cell lines. The production and secretion of endostatin from lentivirus-transduced KU-7 human bladder cancer cells was confirmed by Western blot and competitive enzyme immunoassay. Intravesical instillation of untransduced, green fluorescent protein control lentivirus-transduced, and endostatin-transduced KU-7 cells was performed in murine models to establish orthotopic tumors. Sustained long-term expression of endostatin was achieved in lentivirus-transduced orthotopic bladder tumors, and it was associated with decreased vascularization and inhibition of tumor growth. Lentivirus vector-mediated overexpression of endostatin did not affect the intrinsic production of basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor.\nThese findings suggest that lentivirus-mediated gene transfer might represent an effective strategy for expression of angioinhibitory peptides to achieve inhibition of human bladder cancer proliferation and tumor progression.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2004-03-12", "authors": ["EijiKikuchi", "SilviaMenendez", "MakotoOhori", "CarlosCordon-Cardo", "NoriyukiKasahara", "Bernard HBochner"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-03-0099"}

{"title": "Locally enhanced angiogenesis promotes transplanted cell survival.", "abstract": "A developing therapy for complete or partial loss of function in various tissues and organs involves transplanting an appropriate cell population, capable of compensating for the existing deficiencies. Clinical application of this type of strategy is currently limited by the death or dedifferentiation of the transplanted cells after delivery to the recipient. A delay in thorough vascularization of the implant area creates an environment low in oxygen and other nutrients, and likely contributes to the initial death of transplanted cells. We have addressed this problem by sustained delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an initiator of angiogenesis, from a porous polymer matrix utilized simultaneously for cell delivery. As expected from previous studies, VEGF delivered from these constructs elicited an enhanced angiogenic response over a 2-week period when implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice. Hepatocytes implanted using VEGF-containing matrices demonstrated significantly greater survival after 1 week in vivo as compared with cells implanted on matrices without growth factor. The results of this study therefore indicate that enhancing vascularization in the location of transplanted cells promotes their survival. In addition, this delivery system may be used in future studies to directly promote cell survival and function by also providing growth factors specific to the transplanted cells.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2004-03-11", "authors": ["Molly KSmith", "Martin CPeters", "Thomas PRichardson", "Jessica CGarbern", "David JMooney"], "doi": "10.1089/107632704322791709"}

Gingival fibroblasts were isolated from the healthy gingival tissues of the rat or the human, and cultured with 250-1000 ng/ml of CsA.\nReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses showed that expressions of some angiogenic genes such as angiopoietin 1, basic fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, and angiostatic genes such as angiopoietin 2, brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 and 2, and thrombospondin 1 were not changed significantly in both gingival tissues and cultured fibroblast cells under the CsA treatments. However, expression of thrombospondin 2 (TSP2) decreased dose- and time-dependently in rat and human gingival tissues. Western blot analyses showed that the expression of TSP2 protein was dose-dependently reduced by the CsA treatments in human cultured gingival fibroblasts.\nThese results indicate that the decrease in angiostatic TSP2 expression may be attributed to the CsA-induced gingival vascularization rather than to the increased expression of angiogenic genes.

Only VEGF and Tie1 were upregulated in response to hypoxia.\nHypoxia-induced islet vascularization may involve VEGF and Tie-induced signaling events. The results also show that cultured islets express genes which prevent angiogenesis concurrently with genes coding for factors stimulating angiogenesis.

In the present study, we have examined the ability of such VTL allografts to support thymopoiesis and induce transplantation tolerance across fully MHC-mismatched barriers. Six miniature swine recipients received fully MHC-mismatched VTL grafts with a 12-day course of tacrolimus. Three of these recipients were thymectomized before transplantation and accepted their VTL allografts long-term, with evidence of normal thymopoiesis. In contrast, three euthymic recipients rejected their VTL allografts. Donor renal allografts, matched to the donor VTL grafts, were transplanted without immunosuppression into two of the three thymectomized recipients, and one of the three euthymic recipients. These renal allografts were accepted by thymectomized recipients, but rejected by the euthymic recipient in an accelerated fashion. This study thus demonstrates that successful transplantation of a vascularized thymus across a fully MHC-mismatched barrier induces tolerance in this preclinical, large-animal model.

Neonatal mice lacking functional dehydrocholesterol Delta7-reductase (Dhcr7), a model for the human disease of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, die within 24 hours of birth. Although they have a number of biochemical and structural abnormalities, one cause of death is from apparent respiratory failure due to developmental pulmonary abnormalities.\nIn this study, we characterized further the role of cholesterol deficiency in lung development of these mice. Significant growth retardation, beginning at E14.5 through E16.5, was observed in Dhcr7-/- embryos. Normal lobation but smaller lungs with a significant decrease in lung-to-body weight ratio was noted in Dhcr7-/- embryos, compared to controls. Lung branching morphogenesis was comparable between Dhcr7-/- and controls at early stages, but delayed saccular development was visible in all Dhcr7-/- embryos from E17.5 onwards. Impaired pre-alveolar development of varying severity, inhibited cell proliferation, delayed differentiation of type I alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and delayed vascular development were all evident in knockout lungs. Differentiation of type II AECs was apparently normal as judged by surfactant protein (SP) mRNAs and SP-C immunostaining.

Standard bilateral sequential lung transplantation was performed with the transfer of the donor trachea into the recipient's abdomen, which was wrapped in the greater omentum and sutured into the abdominal wall, similar to a stoma. The patient received immunosuppression consisting of cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil, and cortisone.

In this study, we investigated the angiogenic activity of AFP and its possible role in the fetomaternal unit. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the AFP-binding protein(s) is expressed in blood vessels of chorionic villi from placentae of the second and the third but not of the first trimester during pregnancy. At low concentrations, AFP directly stimulates or enhances, respectively, vascular endothelial growth factor-induced proliferation and sprout formation of endothelial cells isolated from the placenta and the uterus possibly by a MAPK-dependent pathway. Furthermore, AFP enhances blood vessel formation in a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay in vivo. Interestingly, AFP has no proliferative or migratory effects on endothelial cells isolated from the umbilical vein in the absence of vascular endothelial growth factor.

{"title": "Differential expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor system in the gravid uterus of yorkshire and Meishan pigs.", "abstract": "Litter size in the pig is limited by uterine capacity, which is dependent on uterine size, placental size, and vascularity. Placentae of U.S. pig breeds, such as the Yorkshire, exhibit marked growth from mid to late gestation, increasing their surface area of endometrial attachment. In contrast, placentae of the prolific Chinese Meishan pig exhibit little growth from mid to late gestation; instead, they exhibit a marked and progressive increase in the density of placental blood vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic and permeability-enhancing factor that is produced and secreted by placentae of several species, including the pig. The activity of VEGF is mediated through two specific receptors (VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2), both of which are expressed by placental and endometrial tissues in pigs and are thought to play a role in mediating increased vascularization and/or permeability at the fetal-maternal interface. The objectives of the present study were to determine concentrations of VEGF in fetal blood and placental fluids as well as placental and adjacent endometrial mRNA expression of VEGF, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R2 on Days 30, 50, 70, 90, and 110 of gestation in Yorkshire and Meishan pigs. Day 90 Meishan conceptuses exhibited marked increases (P < 0.05) in placental VEGF mRNA expression as well as fetal blood and allantoic fluid concentrations of VEGF, which remained elevated through Day 110. In contrast, Yorkshire conceptuses failed to exhibit increases in placental VEGF mRNA expression or concentrations of VEGF in fetal blood or allantoic fluid until Day 110. Receptor mRNA expression patterns differed between Meishan and Yorkshire conceptuses, but no difference was found in their expression levels. Placental efficiency (fetal weight/placental weight) was higher (P < 0.05) on Days 90 and 110 in Meishan than in Yorkshire conceptuses. The earlier increase in VEGF protein and mRNA expression in the Meishan versus the Yorkshire conceptus may explain the previously reported increased vascularity and increased placental efficiency of this breed compared the Yorkshire breed.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2004-03-05", "authors": ["Kimberly AVonnahme", "Stephen PFord"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.103.026344"}

A 47-year-old woman presented with a long history of muscle pain, weakness, and visual disturbances. Over the last year, she developed diplopia and left sixth nerve palsy. No other neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities were found. Past medical and family history was unremarkable. Laboratory investigation disclosed hypophosphatemia, phosphaturia, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activity, and normal serum calcium levels. CT scans showed a lobulated mass arising on the meningeal surface of the cavernous sinus, measuring 3x 2 x 2 cm. The lesion was partially resected and microscopic examination revealed a highly vascularized tumor composed of primitive mesenchymal cells arranged whether in a patternless-pattern or surrounding thin-walled, branching vascular spaces and thick-walled hyalinized vessels. Other eye-catching features were microcystic areas, multinucleated osteoclastic-like giant cells, scattered islands of mature adipocytes, foci of hemorrhage, thrombosed medium-sized-to-large vessels, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. After surgery, the patient recovered from the muscle pain and weakness, with a significant improvement of serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels and phosphate blood levels. Taken together, the clinical and pathologic features were consistent with a diagnosis of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (mixed connective tissue variant) of the cavernous sinus in a setting of oncogenic osteomalacia. No further treatment was carried out. The patient has been followed for the last 4 years with no evidence of recurrent disease.

Free vascularized fibular grafting has been reported to be successful for patients with early stages of osteonecrosis, but little is known about its efficacy after the femoral head has collapsed.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the results in a consecutive series of 188 patients (224 hips) who had undergone free vascularized fibular grafting, between 1989 and 1999, for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the hip that had led to collapse of the femoral-head but not to arthrosis. The average duration of follow-up was 4.3 years (range, two to twelve years). We defined conversion to total hip arthroplasty as the failure end point, and we analyzed the contribution, to failure, of the size of the lesion, amount of preoperative collapse of the femoral head, etiology of the osteonecrosis, age of the patient, and bilaterality of the lesion. We used the Harris hip score to evaluate clinical status preoperatively and at the time of the most recent follow-up.\nThe overall rate of survival was 67.4% for the hips followed for a minimum of two years and 64.5% for those followed for a minimum of five years. The mean preoperative Harris hip score was 54.5 points, and it increased to 81 points for the patients in whom the surgery succeeded; 63% of the patients in that group had a good or excellent result. There was a significant relationship between the outcome of the grafting procedure and the etiology of the osteonecrosis (p = 0.017). Patients in whom the osteonecrosis was idiopathic, associated with alcohol abuse, or posttraumatic fared worse than did those with other causes, including steroid use. Survival of the joint was not significantly related to the size of the femoral head lesion, but there was an increased relative risk of conversion to total hip arthroplasty with increasing lesion size and amount of collapse. Neither patient age nor bilaterality significantly affected outcome.\nPatients with postcollapse, predegenerative osteonecrosis of the femoral head appear to benefit from free vascularized fibular grafting, with good overall survival of the joint and significant improvement in the Harris hip score. The results of this femoral head-preserving procedure in patients with postcollapse osteonecrosis are superior to those of core decompression and nonoperative treatment, as reported in the literature.

However, no animal model of CaP has been characterized that recapitulates the response of the human prostate vascular compartment to the evolving tumor microenvironment during CaP progression. We report that primary xenografts of human CaP and of noninvolved areas of the human prostate peripheral zone transplanted to athymic nude mice provide a unique model of human angiogenesis occurring in an intact human prostate tissue microenvironment. Angiogenesis in human kidney primary xenografts established from human renal cell carcinoma and noninvolved kidney tissue, a highly vascular organ and cancer, was compared with angiogenesis in xenografts from the relatively less vascularized prostate. Immunohistochemical identification of the human versus mouse host origin of the endothelial cells and of human endothelial cell proliferation in the human prostate and human kidney xenografts demonstrated that: (a) the majority of the vessels in primary xenografts of benign and malignant tissue of both organs were lined with human endothelial cells through the 30-day study period; (b) the mean vessel density was increased in both the CaP and benign prostate xenografts relative to the initial tissue, whereas there was no significant difference in mean vessel density in the renal cell carcinoma and benign kidney xenografts compared with the initial tissue; and (c) the number of vessels with proliferating endothelial cells in primary xenografts of CaP and benign prostate increased compared with their respective initial tissue specimens, whereas the number of vessels with proliferating endothelial cells decreased in the benign kidney xenografts.

{"title": "Morphology of the ovary of Caiman crocodilus (Crocodylia: Alligatoridae).", "abstract": "We describe the ovarian histology and characterize the folliculogenesis of adult females of Caiman crocodilus in order to compare them with other species of Reptilia. The gonad has a thin irregular cortex and a well-developed reticular stroma, composed of vascularized chordae, drained by large lymphatic vessels and separated by extensive lacunae. Simple cuboidal to squamous epithelium, dense connective tissue with numerous elastin fibers, and smooth muscle constitute the ovarian wall. This morphology is similar to that of other Crocodylia, Aves and Testudines. Germinal nests are distributed in the ovarian cortex, some of them with oogonia. Oocytes leave the germinal nests with a single layered cuboidal granulosa, remaining simple during vitellogenesis, as in other Archosauria and Testudines and different from Squamata. As the oocyte grows, the theca is formed by numerous fibroblasts, collagen fibers, and smooth muscle fibers, becoming very thick, highly vascularized and developing muscle bands at advanced vitellogenesis. Folliculogenesis shares morphological features with other species of Reptilia. The corpus luteum is similar to that described for Archosauria; during luteolysis, the theca shrinks and the amount of luteinic cells decreases. The relationship of the corpus luteum to vitellogenesis and egg maintenance is unclear in Crocodylia. Follicular regression in Caiman crocodilus corresponds to an invasive atresia type. Histological features seen in the ovary of Caiman crocodilus are similar to those described in Alligator mississippiensis indicating that these features could be shared among Crocodylia.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), combined with improved corrosion casting methods, reveal new morphological details that promise better diagnostics and treatment but also require expansion of clinical nomenclature.

A. prostatica is a small-size artery whose wall structure is similar to the arteries of the muscular type. V. prostatica is a small-size valved vein. The canine prostate has capsular, parenchymal, and urethral vascular zones. The surface vessels of the capsule are predominantly veins and the diameter of arterial vessels is larger than that of the veins. The trabecular vessels are of two types: direct and branched. The prostate parenchyma is supplied by branches of the trabecular vessels. The periacinary capillaries are fenestrated and form a net in a circular pattern. The processes of the myoepithelial cells embrace both the acins and the periacinar capillaries. In the prostate ductal system. there are spermatozoa.

The aim of this study was to compare the osteogenic potential of bone marrow-derived, culture expanded human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) adherent to different scaffolds composed of various calcium phosphates. Cells were loaded onto 2 x 2 mm cubes of coral calcium carbonate-derived apatite, bovine bone-derived apatite, synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA)/tricalcium phosphate (TCP) (60:40%), or synthetic HA/TCP (20:80%) and placed into the dorsum of SCID mice for 5 weeks. Subsequent histomorphometric analysis of bone formation within the cubes revealed the absence of bone formation within the coral-derived apatite and the bovine bone-derived apatite. Bone formation within synthetic HA/TCP scaffolds was measured to be 8.8% (+/-2.7%) and 13.8% (+/-3.6%) of the total tissue present for the 60:40% and 20:80% materials, respectively. Minimal resorption was observed at this early time point. Scanning electron microscopy evaluation of loaded scaffolds indicates that cell loading was not a variable affecting the different bone formation outcomes in these four scaffolds. In this ectopic model, different apatite-containing scaffolds of similar morphology and porosity demonstrated marked differences in their ability to support osteoinduction by implanted hMSCs.

{"title": "Vascularization of PEG-grafted macroporous hydrogel sponges: a three-dimensional in vitro angiogenesis model using human microvascular endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Vascular tissue can penetrate implants that have an interconnected porous structure. The extent of vascularization is heavily dependent on a number of factors, including the nature of the material as well as the size and porosity of the implant's pore morphology. Currently, it is still not clear what mechanisms are controlling this response. In this work, in vitro human microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) experiments employed in angiogenesis research have been adapted as a screening technique for biomaterial vascularization. Hydrogels composed of poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafts were capable of supporting in vitro tubule formation. The sizes and lengths of tubules were dependent upon the porosity of the polymer network and pore sizes. When compared to the pure PHEMA sponges, PEG-grafted networks possessed a more lattice-type structure, with greater pore interconnection. As a result, these polymers were better suited to supporting tubule formation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

In the current study, the gene expression profiles of thousands of genes in the developing postnatal mouse retina were analyzed and compared in a large-scale, unbiased microarray gene expression analysis.\nFor each of eight different time points during postnatal mouse retinal development, two separate sets of 30 retinas were pooled for RNA isolation, and gene expression was analyzed by hybridization to gene chips in triplicate (Mu74Av2; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Genes were sorted into clusters based on their expression profiles and intensities. Validation was accomplished by comparing the microarray expression profiles with real-time RT-PCR analysis of selected genes and by comparing selected expression profiles with predicted profiles based on previous studies.\nThe Mu74Av2 chip contains more than 6000 known genes and 6500 estimated sequence tags (ESTs) from the mouse Unigene database. Of these, 2635 known gene sequences and 2794 ESTs were expressed at least threefold above background levels during retinal development. Expressed genes were clustered based on expression profiles allowing potential functions for specific genes during retinal development to be inferred by comparison to developmental events occurring at each time point. Specific data and potential functions for genes with various profiles are discussed. All data can be viewed online at http://www.scripps.edu/cb/friedlander/gene_expression/.\nExpression analysis of thousands of different genes during normal postnatal mouse retinal development as reported in this study demonstrates that such an approach can be used to correlate gene expression with known functional differentiation, presenting the opportunity to infer functional correlates between gene expression and specific postnatal developmental events.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2004-02-27", "authors": ["Michael IDorrell", "EdithAguilar", "ChristophWeber", "MartinFriedlander"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.03-0806"}
{"title": "Impaired brain angiogenesis and neuronal apoptosis induced by conditional homozygous inactivation of vascular endothelial growth factor.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is essential for the differentiation of the primitive embryonic vascular system and has been implicated in the vascularization of organs. Recently, VEGF has also been proposed to play a role in neural development, neuroprotection, and adult neurogenesis. Here we have investigated the function of VEGF in the developing brain by cre-lox technology. We show that VEGF produced by the embryonic neuroectoderm is required for the vascularization and the development of the brain. Both the invasion and the directed growth of capillaries were severely impaired in the fore-, mid- and hindbrain of VEGF(lox/lox)/nestin-cre mouse embryos homozygous for a VEGF mutation in the neural tube. These observations demonstrate that VEGF, via local secretion by neural progenitors, induces brain angiogenesis and guides the growth of capillaries toward the ventricular zone. VEGF deficiency led to developmental retardation and progressive destruction of neural tissue in all brain regions. The defect was most pronounced in telencephalic structures, such as the hippocampus, and caused microcephaly. Taken together, the findings establish the critical importance of neuroectoderm-derived VEGF in the morphogenesis of the brain. VEGF acts as a key regulator of brain angiogenesis and provides instructive cues for the correct spatial organization of the vasculature.", "journal": "Thrombosis and haemostasis", "date": "2004-02-26", "authors": ["SabineRaab", "HeikeBeck", "AndreasGaumann", "AliY\u00fcce", "Hans-PeterGerber", "KarlPlate", "Hans-PeterHammes", "NapoleoneFerrara", "GeorgBreier"], "doi": "10.1160/TH03-09-0582"}

Forty patients undergoing an IVF cycle were collected and divided into two groups, a poor responder group (n=17) (estradiol <600 pg/mL or < or =3 oocytes retrieved) and normal responder group (n=23), based on their response to a standard down-regulation protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation.

We hypothesized that macroporous scaffolds of biomineralized 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide), which locally release vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF), would direct simultaneous regeneration of bone and vascular tissue. The presence of a bone-like biomineral substrate significantly increased regeneration of osteoid matrix (32 +/- 7% of total tissue area; mean +/- SD; p < 0.05) and mineralized tissue (14 +/- 2%; P < 0.05) within a rat cranium critical defect compared with a non-mineralized polymer scaffold (19 +/- 8% osteoid and 10 +/- 2% mineralized tissue). Further, the addition of VEGF to a mineralized substrate significantly increased the generation of mineralized tissue (19 +/- 4%; P < 0.05) compared with mineralized substrate alone. This appeared to be due to a significant increase in vascularization throughout VEGF-releasing scaffolds (52 +/- 9 vessels/mm(2); P < 0.05) compared with mineralized scaffolds without VEGF (34 +/- 4 vessels/mm(2)).

A medial wound (3 cm in diameter) and 2 lateral wounds (2 cm in diameter) were created at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of each metacarpus and metatarsus in 5 horses. Each medial wound and the proximolateral wound received an STS, P, PSIS, or NASP dressing on day 8 after wounding. The other lateral wound received an NASP dressing. Bacterial proliferation, inflammatory reaction (histologic changes), and drhessing vascularization were evaluated 6 d after application of the dressing. Percentages of contraction and epithelialization, as well as healing time, were determined when the wounds had completely epithelialized. The practical applicability of the different dressings to equine wound management was also assessed. No significant difference was detected in the parameters evaluated among the treated wounds or between the treated and control wounds. The biologic dressings had no effect on infection, inflammatory response, or healing time. Vascularization was not identified in any of the biologic dressings.

Other PTKIs undergoing clinical evaluation are also described, including epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, PKI166, and CI-1033) and PTKIs designed to disrupt tumor vascularization (SU5416, SU6668, SU11248, PTK787, and ZD6474). How might one apply current knowledge to the efficient development of new agents that would target as-yet-unexploited oncogenic PTKs such as chimeric anaplastic leukemia kinases or Janus kinases? Ideally, the targets should contain structurally distinct drug interaction epitopes, although it is not necessary that these epitopes be unique to a single target, because effective drugs may inhibit multiple kinases involved in an oncogenic process. Oral availability is a highly desirable feature because daily oral administration can maintain a sustained efficacious plasma concentration, whereas intermittent parenteral administration may not. Perhaps most importantly, one must verify the presence of an appropriate molecular target on a case-by-case basis before selecting a patient for PTKI therapy.

However, removal of an intracranial meningioma carries a higher risk of post-operative hemorrhage compared to surgery for other intracranial neoplasms. Because avoidance of post-operative hematoma is of vital interest for neurosurgical patients, the aim of this retrospective study was to analyze risk factors of post-operative hematoma associated with meningioma surgery. Two hundred and ninety six patients with intracranial meningiomas, operated between June 1998 and June 2002, were included in this study. Patients who developed a space-occupying post-operative intracranial hemorrhage and were treated surgically were identified. Data of patients with and without hematoma were retrospectively analyzed to identify risk factors associated with post-operative hematoma. Variables analyzed included patients' age, invasion of venous sinus by the meningioma, tumor vascularization, arachnoidal infiltration, pre-operative prophylaxis of thromboembolic events, peri-operative coagulation abnormalities, residual tumor, location and histology of the tumor. Outcome of patients with post-operative hematoma was assessed according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge and at three months. 21 patients (7.1 %) of 296 patients developed a post-operative intracranial hematoma requiring surgical evacuation. Age was significantly higher in the hematoma group 62.4 +/- 14.0 years compared to patients without post-operative hematoma 56.1 +/- 12.0 (p < 0.05; t-test). Patients older than 70 years had a six-fold increased risk to develop a post-operative hematoma (Chi2 test, 95% CI 1.949-13.224). Patients with post-operative hemorrhage had significant lower post-operative prothrombin time, fibrinogen and platelets immediately after surgery and lower platelets at day 1. None of the other parameters, including pre-operative routine coagulation values, differed significantly between patients with and without post-operative hemorrhage. Three patients with post-operative hematoma showed platelet dysfunction and three patients showed decreased FXIII activity. Of those patients with post-operative hemorrhage at three months follow up three patients (13%) succumbed from reasons not directly related to hemorrhage, one patient remained GOS 2 (4.3%), four patients (17.4%) were GOS 3 and 15 (65.4%) patients had favorable outcome (GOS 4 [one patient] and GOS5 [14 patients]). Meningioma surgery carries a higher risk for post-operative hematoma in the elderly.

This study examined the three-dimensional structure of both the external and internal vascularizations of the prenatal rat telencephalon from embryonic days 12 (E12) to 20 (E20).\nA microvascular casting method for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used in this study, along with vascular staining using gold-gelatin solution-autometallography (GGS-AMG) after intravascular injection of colloidal gold, as well as hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining for paraffin embedded specimens.\nIn GGS-AMG stains, E16 fetuses had a few short perforating cortical blood vessels (SPCVs); E17 fetuses had long perforating cortico-medullary vessels (LPCVs). Older fetuses had specific patterns of vascular networks in the cortex and the deeper subcortical part of the telencephalon. In the cortex, fine longitudinal blood vessels were connected by transverse channels. The deep telencephalon had fine blood vessels running in all directions. Using SEM, the external vascularization was already visible in E12 fetuses as arborizations of arterial branches, forming a mesh of fine vascular networks covering the telencephalon. A coralliform fine venous plexus was observed in the external vascularization of E16 fetuses. There were ring-like anastomoses and bud-like protrusions in the network of small blood vessels, most likely the angiogenesis of fetal vessels. From E12 to E16, an immature and incomplete internal vascularization began to appear. There were short blood vessels with ballooned terminals branching from the external vascularization. They penetrated the brain tissue to form networks in the superficial layer, comparable to SPCVs. In E17 to E20 fetuses, tortuous venous branches, straight arterial blood vessels, and a fine network of small blood vessels formed the external vascularization. There were fewer arterial than venous branches connecting to the fine networks of small blood vessels. LPCVs were noted at E17, at the time the white matter emerged. They branched from the external vascularization, and perpendicularly penetrated the brain surface, traversing the cortical plate, and entering into the deep brain. At E17, arterial and venous blood vessels could be clearly distinguished in the external vascularization. At E20, the cortex and white matter contained specific arrangements of networks of fine blood vessels, as seen by GGS-AMG staining.\nThese findings show that the development of both the external and internal vascularization follows the development of the telencephalon. In particular, the emergence of the cortical plate and white matter on E16 and E17 influence the development of both the internal and the external vascularization.

A color Doppler flowmeter was used to identify the original arterial and venous anastomoses, the vessels in the margin of the flap, and also across the flap inset. The main vascular pedicle was then manually compressed for 2 min and blood flow was again examined in the vessels at the margin of the flap. The flap vessels (post-anastomotic), the anastomoses, and the recipient vessels (pre-anastomotic) could be identified in every case. There was no evidence of anastomotic stenosis. No vessels (neo-vascularization) greater than 0.5 mm could be identified across the flap inset. Small arteries could be identified in the flap near the inset. These vessels emptied completely on manual compression of the vascular pedicle for 2 min and did not refill until the compression was released.

Here, an account is given of the role played by hypoxia-inducible factor in mediating the effects of oxygen on production of growth factor ligands and receptors which regulate angiogenesis and vessel maturation. However, it should be noted that, for the human placenta early in gestation, the normal (i.e. physiological) partial pressure of O(2)is low but this does not mean that the tissue is hypoxic. Thus, the mechanisms of regulating angiogenic growth factor production may differ at this time in comparison to those found later in gestation or in other tissues or organs. The vasculature in the placenta is plastic and changes markedly as gestation progresses. This is controlled by the complex interplay between physical factors and chemical factors including oxygen, growth factors and growth inhibitors. The companion reviews describe morphological features of normal and pathological development of the human placenta in the context of the factors discussed here.", "journal": "Placenta", "date": "2004-02-20", "authors": ["D SCharnock-Jones", "PKaufmann", "T MMayhew"], "doi": "10.1016/j.placenta.2003.10.004"}
{"title": "[Three-dimensional ultrasonographic uterine vascularization and embryo implantation].", "abstract": "During the last decade transvaginal color Doppler has played an important role in increasing the understanding of early human development. Although our knowledge of early pregnancy development has recently improved, little is known about the most critical period of human development: implantation. Recent advances in three-dimensional ultrasound have made studies of follicular development, ovulation and uterine receptivity more accurate. Three-dimensional ultrasound facilitates determination of the antral follicle number, ovarian volume calculation and analysis of the intensity of ovarian stromal blood flow in a short time without increasing the patient's discomfort. It is also possible to determine predictors of IVF outcome by three-dimensional ultrasound. Favorable ovarian stromal vascularity is associated with higher number of retrieved oocytes and increased pregnancy rates. The high degree of endometrial perfusion shown by color Doppler ultrasonography and on three-dimensional power Doppler histograms on the day of embryo transfer can indicate a more favorable endometrial milieu for successful in vitro fertilization. Uterine septum is the most common uterine abnormality occurring in infertile women. Three-dimensional ultrasound can be used as a screening method for detection of uterine abnormalities in patients suffering from infertility.", "journal": "Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction", "date": "2004-02-18", "authors": ["SKupesic"], "doi": "10.1016/s0368-2315(04)96398-3"}

To minimize these problems, we developed a transgenic (Tg) model system limited to a single T-cell receptor (TCR)/peptide/major histocompatibility complex molecule. Two alloantigen-specific CD4 T-cell clones were used to isolate cDNA encoding the TCRalpha and TCRbeta chains that recognize the Kd54-68/I-Ab epitope. Two different TCR Tg lines were produced in C57BL/6 (B6) mice and crossed onto the B6.Rag1-/- background. B6.Rag1-/- recipients of T cells from TCR Tg Rag1-/-mice promptly rejected B10.D2, but not irrelevant B10.BR, cardiac grafts.

{"title": "Novel targeting of apoptosis pathways for prostate cancer therapy.", "abstract": "Selection of treatment options for clinically localized prostate cancer is based on a host of factors including the patient's age, overall health status, potential complications, clinical tumor stage and Gleason score. It is widely acknowledged that androgen independent disease remains the main obstacle to improving the survival and quality of life in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Apoptosis as a genetically regulated process has a critical endpoint that coincides with the therapeutic goal of successful treatment of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer. Opportunities to alter the apoptotic threshold of prostate cancer cells using antisense technology and gene therapy certainly exist, but the scope and extent of their applicability and action depends upon research delineating the many subtleties within the apoptotic pathway. Most epithelial and endothelial cells undergo apoptosis when they loose contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM), via the phenomenon of anoikis. Signaling interaction between growth factor apoptosis-signaling pathways and cellular effectors of anoikis potential and tumor vascularity provides a new molecular basis for optimizing combination approaches for the effective treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Agents that induce epithelial or endothelial cell apoptosis by antagonizing integrin binding are considered for cancer therapy via their ability to inhibit tumor vascularization. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the therapeutic benefit of apoptosis induction within the context of tumor neovascularization inhibition, and provides an insight into the consequences of anoikis induction (by different agents) in targeting angiogenesis in prostate cancer cells.", "journal": "Current cancer drug targets", "date": "2004-02-18", "authors": ["Jason BGarrison", "NatashaKyprianou"], "doi": "10.2174/1568009043481623"}

{"title": "Human Fas-ligand expression on porcine endothelial cells does not protect against xenogeneic natural killer cytotoxicity.", "abstract": "Several human leukocyte subsets including natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) participate in cellular immune responses directed against vascularized pig-to-human xenografts. As these leukocytes express the death receptor Fas either constitutively (PMN) or upon activation (NK, CTL), we explored in vitro whether the transgenic expression of Fas ligand (FasL) on porcine endothelial cells (EC) is a valuable strategy to protect porcine xenografts. The porcine EC line 2A2 was stably transfected with human FasL (2A2-FasL) and interactions of 2A2-FasL with human leukocytes were analyzed using functional assays for apoptosis, cytotoxicity, chemotaxis, adhesion under shear stress, and transmigration. FasL expressed on porcine EC induced apoptosis in human NK and T cells, but did not protect porcine EC against killing mediated by human NK cells. 2A2-FasL released soluble FasL, which induced strong chemotaxis in human PMN. Adhesion under shear stress of PMN on 2A2-FasL cells was increased whereas transendothelial migration was decreased. In contrast, FasL had no effect on the adhesion of NK cells but increased their transmigration through porcine EC. Although FasL expression on porcine EC is able to induce apoptosis in human effector cells, it did not provide protection against xenogeneic cytotoxicity.

We have used the hamster-to-rat aortic transplant model to study characteristics of this phenomenon and to determine whether it could be controlled or prevented by immunosuppressive therapy. Golden Syrian hamster aortas were transplanted into untreated Lewis rats, athymic rats, and Lewis rats receiving cyclosporin (10 mg/kg), leflunomide (5, 10 or 15 mg/kg), or 10 mg/kg of both drugs. Grafts were harvested on days 2, 7, 14, 28 and 56. Grafts and recipient spleens were analysed using computerized morphometry, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Blood was taken on various days for the measurement of anti-hamster antibodies (flow cytometry) and of the leflunomide metabolite A77 127. In untreated rats, by day 56, transplanted aortas developed a cell-free media with a mature neointimal lesion consisting of actin-positive cells, CD4 T cells, and macrophages. There were large increases in anti-hamster immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG, collections of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells in splenic germinal centres, and IgM, C3 and C5a deposition in aortas. In athymic recipients, the media architecture was preserved, and the changes in the neointima and in anti-hamster IgM and IgG were markedly abrogated, but not prevented. In Lewis rats receiving leflunomide, absence of circulating or deposited IgM did not prevent neointimal formation by day 14. Combination treatment was the most effective at preventing neointimal formation and humoral changes. Leflunomide monotherapy was the least effective. There were no changes in peak concentrations of the main metabolite of leflunomide over 8 weeks.

{"title": "Perfusion of 99Tcm-labeled CD105 Mab into kidneys from patients with renal carcinoma suggests that CD105 is a promising vascular target.", "abstract": "There is strong published and unpublished evidence that our CD105 Mab E9, which is highly reactive with angiogenic endothelial cells, could be a useful reagent to target the vasculature of solid tumors in man. Since Mab E9 does not cross-react with animal tissues, we undertook here to evaluate its localization using human kidney as an ex vivo model. Perfusion was performed through the renal artery of 99Tcm-labeled purified CD105 Mab in freshly excised kidneys from 7 patients with renal carcinoma. In all 7 cases, immunoscintigraphs showed the presence of well-defined radioactive hot spots, which matched the positions of the tumors as identified by presurgery MRI scans and subsequent histopathologic examination. Importantly, in one instance, where a presurgery MRI scan had identified only one tumor, immunoscintigraphs showed 2 distinct hot spots of radioactivity. The pathology report confirmed that the additional hot spot corresponded to a small secondary well-vascularized tumor. The implication of this finding is that the radiolabeled Mab, E9, may be of use in the detection of metastatic disease. That the labeling of tumors was specific was confirmed when prior perfusion of unlabeled mab E9 in 2 kidneys completely blocked the localization of 99Tcm-conjugated Mab E9. Radioactivity in samples of tumor and normal tissue taken from 7 kidneys was counted in a gamma counter. In all cases, there was a greater uptake of radioactivity in tumors compared with the corresponding normal kidneys. The median values, adjusted per gram wet weight, for 99Tcm were 14.8 times (range, 4.8-113.0) greater in kidney tumors than in normal kidney tissue (p < 0.007). Immunofluorescent staining of cryostat sections of tumor tissues in each of the 7 cases showed strong and uniform localization of Mab E9 in tumor microvessels. Interestingly, chimeric staining of endothelial cells (ECs) was seen in an occasional microvessel segment. That is, while most of the ECs lining a microvessel were strongly stained, an occasional EC was negative. This was not an artifact of staining. Unstained ECs may be nonangiogenic or apoptotic since CD105 is a proliferation/activation-associated antigen. Further investigations are warranted to establish the pharmacokinetics of 99Tcm-labeled CD105 antibody in vivo.

Here we use human genetics as an approach to identify an angiogenic factor, VG5Q, and further define two genetic defects of VG5Q in patients with the vascular disease Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). One mutation is chromosomal translocation t(5;11), which increases VG5Q transcription. The second is mutation E133K identified in five KTS patients, but not in 200 matched controls. VG5Q protein acts as a potent angiogenic factor in promoting angiogenesis, and suppression of VG5Q expression inhibits vessel formation. E133K is a functional mutation that substantially enhances the angiogenic effect of VG5Q. VG5Q shows strong expression in blood vessels and is secreted as vessel formation is initiated. VG5Q can bind to endothelial cells and promote cell proliferation, suggesting that it may act in an autocrine fashion. We also demonstrate a direct interaction of VG5Q with another secreted angiogenic factor, TWEAK (also known as TNFSF12). These results define VG5Q as an angiogenic factor, establish VG5Q as a susceptibility gene for KTS, and show that increased angiogenesis is a molecular pathogenic mechanism of KTS.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2004-02-13", "authors": ["Xiao-LiTian", "RajkumarKadaba", "Sun-AhYou", "MugenLiu", "Ayse AnilTimur", "LinYang", "QiuyunChen", "PrzemyslawSzafranski", "ShaoqiRao", "LingWu", "David EHousman", "Paul EDiCorleto", "David JDriscoll", "JulianBorrow", "QingWang"], "doi": "10.1038/nature02320"}

The effect of immunosuppression withdrawal on physeal viability after bone-healing to the recipient site was investigated with use of a validated model for heterotopic microvascular transplantation of rabbit tibial physeal allografts. Our hypothesis was that an allograft survives after withdrawal of immunosuppression only if bone-healing, and therefore epiphyseal and metaphyseal vascular continuity, occurs between the transplanted physis and the recipient bone.\nPhyseal grafts with adjacent exposed epiphyseal and metaphyseal bone were transplanted to allogeneic recipients. Graft circulation was restored microsurgically. The immunosuppression regimen consisted of cyclosporine, administered for six weeks, followed by withdrawal of immunosuppression for four weeks. The animals were killed at ten weeks postoperatively. Group I consisted of twelve allografts that were transferred with bone contact between the transplanted graft and the iliac crest recipient site, whereas group II consisted of twelve allografts transplanted without bone contact. Control groups had identical surgical procedures without immunosuppression. Longitudinal growth was assessed by fine-detail radiography, and osseous union was evaluated histologically. Transplanted physes were evaluated histologically, and cellular viability was quantified by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare physeal viability between groups.\nFollowing immunosuppression withdrawal, the physeal grafts with bone contact had significantly greater viability indices (16.0 +/- 2.9 compared with 0.0 +/- 0.0, p < 0.005) and decreased longitudinal growth (5.1 +/- 1.9 mm compared with 10.3 +/- 3.5 mm, p < 0.05), and they demonstrated histological features that were consistent with continued viability associated with mild rejection compared with grafts transplanted without bone contact. Abnormalities of physeal architecture, however, were seen routinely. All control physes transferred without immunosuppression were nonviable and did not grow.\nThe viability of physeal allograft transplants is preserved following the withdrawal of immunosuppression, provided that the graft design and recipient site preparation allow for epiphyseal and metaphyseal neovascularization mediated by bone-healing between graft and recipient.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

{"title": "Expression of fibrillin-1 in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: a role in microcirculation adaptability.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: It has been suggested that the elastic network plays an important role in the tissue response to mechanical stress. The components of the elastic network have been poorly studied in liver diseases. Therefore, in this work, the expression and distribution of fibrillin-1 and elastin were studied in hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia and compared with surrounding liver and hepatocellular adenoma. METHODS: Immunohistochemical studies for fibrillin-1 and elastin were performed on unfixed cryostat sections of focal nodular hyperplasia (22 cases), hepatocellular adenoma (15 cases) and surrounding liver (34 cases). RESULTS: Surrounding normal liver showed only a continuous, thin and regular immunostaining of fibrillin-1 in the space of Disse, whereas elastin was nearly absent. In focal nodular hyperplasia, fibrillin-1 was more strongly expressed in the perisinusoidal space, compared with surrounding liver; in contrast, in adenomas fibrillin-1 immunostaining was irregular and very low in perisinusoidal space, more intense in peliotic areas. CONCLUSIONS: In focal nodular hyperplasia, the increased microfibrillar network containing fibrillin-1 in the space of Disse could reflect an adaptation of the sinusoidal wall to an increased arterial blood flow in sinusoids. In hepatocellular adenoma, the different patterns of fibrillin-1 could be related to the heterogeneity of the arterial vascularization and to the frequent necrotico-hemorrhagic changes.

Overexpression of heparanase resulted in increased levels of urinary protein and creatinine, suggesting an effect on kidney function, reflected also by electron microscopy examination of the kidney tissue. The hpa-tg mice exhibited a reduced food consumption and body weight compared with control mice. The effect of heparanase on tissue remodeling and morphogenesis was best demonstrated by the phenotype of the hpa-tg mammary glands, showing excess branching and widening of ducts associated with enhanced neovascularization and disruption of the epithelial basement membrane. The hpa-tg mice exhibited an accelerated rate of hair growth, correlated with high expression of heparanase in hair follicle keratinocytes and increased vascularization.

Here, we have overexpressed human caspase-9 by stable transfection in the SNB19 glioblastoma cell line, which normally expresses low levels of caspase-9. Our studies revealed that overexpression of caspase-9 coupled with radiation has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of glioma invasion as demonstrated by Matrigel assay (> 65%). Furthermore, sense caspase stable clones cocultured with fetal rat brain aggregates along with radiation showed complete inhibition as compared to the parental and vector controls. During in vitro angiogenesis, SNB19 cells cocultured with human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) showed vascular network formation after 48-72 h. In contrast, these capillary-like structures were inhibited when HMEC cells were cocultured with sense caspase stable SNB19 cells. This effect was further enhanced by radiation (5 Gy). Signaling mechanisms revealed that apoptosis is induced by cleavage of caspase-9 by radiation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3.

The aim of this study was to define the expression and angiogenic functions of microvascular CXCR4 and SDF-1/CXCL12 in the human intestinal tract. Studies of human colonic mucosa in vivo and primary cultures of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC) in vitro showed that the intestinal microvasculature expresses CXCR4 and its cognate ligand SDF-1/CXCL12. Moreover, SDF-1/CXCL12 stimulation of HIMEC triggers CXCR4-linked G proteins, phosphorylates ERK1/2, and activates proliferative and chemotactic responses.

Besides acquiring routine clinical and pathological data the tumours were assessed by scoring immunohistochemistry for proliferative activity and p53-overexpression. Tumour vascularization (angiogenesis) and epithelial texture variables were investigated by quantitative stereology. The data were evaluated by classical statistical methods (t-test, correlation analysis, logistic regression). Moreover, self-organizing feature maps (SOMs) were applied as an exploratory approach to unsupervised data analysis by artificial neural networks.\nThe proliferative fraction, p53 overexpression of tumour cell nuclei, preoperative prostate-specific antigen value and density of capillary vascularization correlated with the Gleason score in incidental prostatic carcinoma. In a stepwise logistic regression analysis with the tumour categories T1a and T1b as dependent variables, the Gleason score and the volume fraction of epithelial cells were significant independent predictors of the tumour category. The cases could be grouped into clusters of different degrees of malignancy using SOMs.\nTexture variables of tumour cells are of central importance for the extent of propagation in the prostate in incidental prostatic adenocarcinomas. Gleason score and quantitative stereological estimates of the volume fraction of tumour cells are significant predictors of T1a and T1b categories of incidental prostatic carcinoma.

{"title": "Effect of biomaterial properties on bone healing in a rabbit tooth extraction socket model.", "abstract": "In this work we sought to understand the effect of biomaterial properties upon healing bone tissue. We hypothesized that a hydrophilic polymer gel implanted into a bone tissue defect would impede the healing process owing to the biomaterial's prevention of protein adsorption and thus cell adhesion. To test this hypothesis, healing bone was investigated within a rabbit incisor extraction socket, a subcritical size bone defect that resists significant soft tissue invasion by virtue of its conformity. After removal of the incisor teeth, one tooth socket was left as an empty control, one was filled with crosslinked polymer networks formed from the hydrophobic polymer poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF), and one was filled with a hydrogel formed from the hydrophilic oligomer oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF). At five different times (4 days as well as 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks), jaw bone specimens containing the tooth sockets were removed. We analyzed bone healing by histomorphometrical analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections as well as immunohistochemically stained sections. The proposed hypothesis, that a hydrophilic material would hinder bone healing, was supported by the histomorphometrical results. In addition, the immunohistochemical results reflect molecular signaling indicative of the early invasion of platelets, the vascularization of wound-healing tissue, the differentiation of migrating progenitor cells, and the formation and remodeling of bone tissue. Finally, the results emphasize the need to consider biomaterial properties and their differing effects upon endogenous growth factors, and thus bone healing, during the development of tissue engineering devices.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Upon blood contact, proinflammatory proteins adsorb to the material and provide a substrate for monocyte binding and differentiation. Various heparin-coated polymers have been shown to reduce adsorption of proinflammatory proteins in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the effect of knitted, heparin-coated Dacron on the foreign body reaction was tested subcutaneously in rats. We hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory effect of heparin would reduce monocyte recruitment and differentiation and therefore limit the inflammatory reaction. An ongoing foreign body reaction, characterized by the presence of foreign body giant cells and high vascularization, was observed in uncoated as well as (heparin-)coated Dacron at up to 180 days of implantation. Also, a thin capsule was formed around each material up to this time. In conclusion, although heparin coatings might have an effect on the acute inflammatory response, we were not able to show a difference between heparin-coated and uncoated Dacron after 180 days' implantation in rats.

It is caused by a retrograde flow of arterial blood from a \"pump\" into an acardiac twin through placental arterial and venous connections. The heart function of the recipient twin is either blocked or insufficient to support perfusion of the upper body. Severe developmental anomalies ensue. While most acardiacs are anencepahalic, a few twins with a rudimental heart (\"hemicardiac\") are able to support a variably complex brain. Here we report three cases of hemicardiac twinning with neuronal migrational defects. The most severe abnormalities affected the supratentorial compartment. They can be conceptually divided in two groups. The first, which we tentatively linked to agenesis of the choroid plexus, can be described as a failure of prosencephalic unfolding. The resulting defects included collapsed neocortex, agenesis of the hippocampi and scrambled basal ganglia and diencephalon. The second group of lesions can be theoretically deduced to a result of disruption of the glia-pial boundary with subsequent formation of leptomeningeal heterotopia and zona cerebrovasculosa. Our observations highlight that even in the milieu of a normal genetic background, severe restriction of brain perfusion could lead to neuronal migration defects.

The metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are associated with multiple metabolic toxicities, which result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to an elevated tension of oxidative-redox stress and an accelerated atherosclerosis termed atheroscleropathy.\nThis atheroscleropathy is associated with accelerated angiogenesis within the vulnerable, thin-cap fibro-atheroma, prone to rupture resulting in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The resulting intimopathy with its neovascularization due to angiogenesis of the adventitial vasa vasorum (Vv) is prone to intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). These IPH are associated with destabilization of the vulnerable plaques resulting in plaque erosion and plaque rupture resulting in ACS. In atheroscleropathy the adventitial Vv invades the plaque in a malignant-like fashion and concurrently is associated with chronic inflammation, as macrophages are being deposited within the shoulder regions of these vulnerable plaques. These angiogenic Vv provide a custom delivery vascular network for multiple detrimental substrates, which further accelerates the growth of these vulnerable plaques and atheroscleropathy. There exists a vascularization paradox in MS and T2DM, in that, angiogenesis within the plaque is induced and arteriogenesis is impaired.\nThis review will attempt to provide a database of knowledge regarding the vascularization process (angiogenesis and arteriogenesis) and its mechanisms to better understand the increased cardiovascular risk and the increased morbidity and mortality associated with MS and T2DM.", "journal": "Cardiovascular diabetology", "date": "2004-02-06", "authors": ["Melvin RHayden", "Suresh CTyagi"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-2840-3-1\n10.1056/NEJM199901143400207\n10.1186/1475-2840-1-3\n10.1186/1475-2840-2-2\n10.1001/jama.281.8.727\n10.1001/jama.256.20.2859\n10.1097/00041433-199810000-00012\n10.1253/circj.66.783\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)82095-8\n10.1038/nm0603-677\n10.1056/NEJMoa035655\n10.1016/S0735-1097(98)00216-2\n10.1001/jama.281.10.921\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00255-7\n10.1006/jmcc.1999.1049\n10.1016/S0002-9149(02)02962-4\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00228-5\n10.1186/1479-5876-1-6\n10.1139/cjpp-74-8-983\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000069625.11230.96\n10.1016/S0741-5214(03)00555-X\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000030360.72503.56\n10.1073/pnas.0730843100"}

Central venous catheters are the preferred VA for RRT in the intensive care setting. Semi-rigid double-lumen polyurethane catheters may be considered for short-time use (up to 2-3 weeks). Soft silicone double-lumen or twin-catheters, preferably with subcutaneous tunnelling, are highly desirable for prolonged RRT (over 3 weeks). The femoral route is the first option in the presence of associated risk factors (respiratory failure, pulmonary oedema, bleeding...). The internal jugular route should be considered for mid-term use in order to facilitate the patient's mobilization and to reduce the risk of infection. The subclavian route should be avoided because of the risk of stenosis and/or thrombosis of the outflow vein.

{"title": "Osteocutaneous flap prefabrication in rats.", "abstract": "Composite tissue defects may involve skin, mucosa, muscle, and bone together or in combinations of two or three of these tissues. Defects involving bone and skin are frequently encountered. Osteocutaneous flaps may be used to reconstruct these composite tissue defects. Sometimes, it is not possible to obtain a vascular osteocutaneous flap. Another way of producing an osteocutaneous flap that has the desired feature is prefabrication. Prefabrication of osteocutaneous flaps can be performed in two ways: (1) a vascularized osseous flap may be grafted with skin and (2) an osteocutaneous flap can be prefabricated by implanting an osseous graft into an axial island flap. There are many articles describing osteocutaneous flap prefabrication, but there is no comparison of both methods in the literature. As an experimental model for osteocutaneous flap prefabrication, rat tail bone was chosen. For the experiments, five groups were formed. Each group contained 10 rats. In the first experimental group, a vascularized osseous segment was skin grafted and an osteocutaneous flap was prefabricated. In the second experimental group, an osseous graft was implanted into an axial skin flap. To compare viability of skin and bone components of the two prefabrication groups, vascularized tail bone was elevated with overlying skin in the third group, a bone flap was elevated in the fourth group, and a skin flap that had been prefabricated by using vascular implantation was elevated in the fifth group. The authors examined five rats in each group by microangiography at the end of 4 weeks. On microangiographic analysis, all groups showed patency of vascular pedicles. There was no difference among the groups from the point of view of vascular patency and bone appearance. Bone scintigraphy was performed on the five rats in each group. On bone scintigraphic scans, the bone component of flaps was visualized in all groups except for group 5. The mean radioactivity value on the flap side was 10,362 +/- 541.1 in group 1, 10,241 +/- 1173 in group 2, 10,696 +/- 647.1 in group 3, and 10,696 +/- 647.1 in group 4. When the radioactivity values on the flap side were compared, no statistically significant difference among groups was seen, except for group 5 (p < 0.05). To evaluate bone metabolic activity, the bone component of flap and remaining last tail bone was harvested and the radioactivity of each specimen was measured with a well-type gamma counter. The parameter of percentage radioactivity in counts per minute per unit per gram of tissue was calculated. The value of the bone component of the flap side and the value of normal bone were estimated and results were compared. The mean result was 0.86 +/- 0.08 in group 1, 0.88 +/- 0.07 in group 2, 0.87 +/- 0.07 in group 3, and 0.81 +/- 0.04 in group 4. The difference among all groups was not statistically significant. Histologic examination was performed on all rats in each group and demonstrated that the bony component was viable, showing a cellular bone marrow, osteoblasts along bony trabeculae, and vascular channels in bone-containing groups.

In a mouse model, in which the vascularization of a transplantable tumor was studied after bone marrow (BM) transplantation, we show that cells that express Tie-2, Sca-1, CD31 and CD45 function as both BM EPC and primitive hematopoietic stem cells. BM cells from transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the endothelial lineage-specific Tie-2 promoter (Tie-2 /GFP) were used to reconstitute irradiated (12 Gy) wild-type mice. Five donor BM cell populations were studied: (1) whole BM; (2) Sca-1-enriched BMC; (3) GFP/Tie-2+, Sca-1+ BMC; (4) GFP/Tie-2-, Sca-1+ BMC and (5) Sca-1-depleted BMC. After 4 weeks, the mice were injected with Tg.AC tumor cells. Three weeks later, sections from the tumors were stained for CD31 and examined for Tie-2-driven GFP expression. BM-derived endothelial cells were found only in mice transplanted with bone marrow containing populations of Tie-2+, Sca-1+ cells. As few as 3500 of these cells were sufficient to radioprotect lethally irradiated mice. Thus, we conclude that a rare subset of BMC (approximately 4 x 10(-3)%) with the putative properties of hemangioblasts have an active Tie-2 promoter.

Angiogenesis, or the growth of new tumor blood vessels, was initially the main target in the development of novel antitumor agents.

These vascular targeting agents (VTAs) exert their action by producing a rapid shutdown of tumor blood flow, resulting in ischemia and tumor cell necrosis.

From January 1996 until December 2002, 7 Hoffa fractures (6 patients) from a total of 79 distal femoral fractures were treated in the Department of Trauma Surgery, University Hospital of Giessen. The results were evaluated by Neer's score. For the evaluation of postoperative vascularization of the distal femur, clinical and radiological findings were compared with anatomical studies of the bone arteries by corrosion preparations. Fracture consolidation was seen in all cases. Patients with an isolated Hoffa fracture achieved a score of 89.0 (82-97) according to Neer. One patient suffering initially from nonunion achieved 68 points after bone union. One polytraumatized patient with bilateral Hoffa fracture achieved a satisfying result (score value of 72) and a bad result (score value of 38). Multiple small nutrient arteries of the distal femur originate from the \"rete articulare genus.\" They can be expected to ensure the arterial blood supply. Hoffa fracture is a very rare injury.

Cancer cells elicit the growth of new capillaries during neovascularization in a process termed angiogenesis. In diabetics, pathologic angiogenesis in various tissues is a clinical feature of many common complications. Therefore, the diabetic cancer patient warrants special consideration and extra care in the design of anti-angiogenic treatments without adverse side effects. Some treatment regimens that look promising in vitro, in animal models, or in early clinical trials may be contra-indicated for diabetics. This chapter will review the common complications of diabetes, with emphasis on the angiogenic pathology. Recent research related to the mechanism of action and basis for specificity of the anti-angiogenic peptide, angiostatin, will be the focus. The aim is to shed light on areas in which more research is needed with respect to angiostatin and other anti-angiogenic agents and the microenvironmental conditions that affect their activities, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for diabetic cancer patients.", "journal": "Recent progress in hormone research", "date": "2004-01-30", "authors": ["Miriam LWahl", "Tammy LMoser", "Salvatore VPizzo"], "doi": "10.1210/rp.59.1.73"}
{"title": "Comparison of surgical versus endovascular occlusion models in pig femoral arteries.", "abstract": "To compare an endovascular technique with a well established surgical approach to achieve long-term occlusions of large porcine arteries while preserving the integrity of periarterial tissue.\nThe femoral arteries in 11 pigs were occluded using surgical techniques on one side and blinded stent-grafts in the contralateral vessel. Feasibility, safety, primary and long-term success, and the extent of vascularization were determined over a 3-month period by conventional angiography and histological analysis. A subgroup of animals (n=5) was treated with a locally administered plasmid coding for vascular endothelial growth factor (pVEGF165) to compare both occlusion techniques under conditions of collateral growth induction.\nThe primary and long-term success rates for both occlusion models were 100%. Surgical occlusion of arteries resulted in a significant amount of scar dehiscence and local groin infection compared to the endograft-occluded side. There was no significant difference in capillary densities and collateralization of periarterial areas in a comparison of the occlusion technique: the cross-sectional area of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) was 300 +/- 24 mm2 for endovascular occlusion versus 320 +/- 23 mm2 for surgical occlusion (p=0.559). In the profunda femoris artery, respective values were 418 +/- 35 and 448 +/- 18 mm2 (p=0.474). The local delivery of pVEGF165 resulted in a significant increase in collateral growth in both occlusion models with comparable neovascularization: cross-sectional SFA area increased from 310 +/- 16 to 428 +/- 13 mm2 (p<0.0001); in the PFA, the area increased from 422 +/- 19 to 658 +/- 49 mm2 (p<0.0001).\nEndovascular arterial occlusions using blinded stent-grafts allow easy and safe creation of long-term occlusions. Previously described collateralization following surgical occlusions was not observed, indicating that those collaterals may be associated with wound healing rather than ischemia. The occlusion of arteries using blinded stent-grafts in pigs may therefore be an appropriate model for assessing the effects of angiogenic factors in vivo.", "journal": "Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists", "date": "2004-01-30", "authors": ["Markus GEngelmann", "MasumiShimizu", "JaroslavPelisek", "AlexandraFuchs", "AdamGolda", "ChoukriMekkaoui", "PeterFraunberger", "Pierre HRolland", "SigridNikol"], "doi": "10.1177/152660280401100109"}

Nutritional alterations during fetal and early postnatal periods, induced by either low protein or energy-restricted diets, produce beta-cell dysfunction. As a consequence, insulin secretion in response to different secretagogues is reduced, as is the number of beta-cells and the size and vascularization of islets. In this study, we used a cDNA macroarray technique and RT-PCR to assess the pattern of gene expression in pancreatic islets from rats fed isocaloric low (6 g/100 g, LP) and normal (17 g/100 g, NP) protein diets, after weaning. Thirty-two genes related to metabolism, neurotransmitter receptors, protein trafficking and targeting, intracellular kinase network members and hormones had altered expression (up- or down-regulated). RT-PCR confirmed the macroarray results for five selected genes, i.e., clusterin, secretogranin II precursor, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, phospholipase A(2) and glucose transporter. Thus, cDNA macroarray analysis revealed significant changes in the gene expression pattern in rats fed a low protein diet after weaning.

To determine which isomer mediates the antiangiogenic effects of CLA in vivo, the effects of diets supplemented with 5 or 10 g/kg c9,t11- or t10,c12-CLA isomers were compared in CD2F1Cr mice. Both isomers inhibited functional vascularization of a matrigel pellet in vivo and decreased serum VEGF concentrations; the t10,c12 isomer also decreased the proangiogenic hormone leptin (P < 0.05). Additionally, the t10,c12 isomer, but not c9,t11-CLA, rapidly induced apoptosis of the white and brown adipocytes as well as the preexisting supporting vasculature of the mammary fat pad (P < 0.05). Independent of this isomer-specific adipose apoptotic effect, both isomers induced a rapid and reversible decrease in the diameter of the unilocular adipocytes (P < 0.05). The ability of both CLA isomers to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo may contribute to their ability to inhibit carcinogenesis.

We synthesized a novel ATP-competitive KDR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently suppresses human and mouse KDR activity in enzyme (IC(50) = 7.8-19.5 nM) and cell-based assays (IC(50) = 8 nM). The compound was bioavailable in vivo, leading to a dose-dependent decrease in basal- and VEGF-stimulated KDR tyrosine phosphorylation in lungs from na\u00efve and tumor-bearing mice (IC(50) = 23 nM). Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics guided drug dose selection for antitumor efficacy studies. HT1080 nude mice xenografts were treated orally twice daily with vehicle, or 33 or 133 mg/kg of compound. These doses afforded trough plasma concentrations approximately equal to the IC(50) for inhibition of KDR autophosphorylation in vivo for the 33 mg/kg group, and higher than the IC(99) for the 133 mg/kg group. Chronic treatment at these doses was well-tolerated and resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth, decreased tumor vascularization, decreased proliferation, and enhanced cell death. Antitumor efficacy correlated with inhibition of KDR tyrosine phosphorylation in the tumor, as well as in a surrogate tissue (lung). Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics assessment indicated that the degree of tumor growth inhibition correlated directly with the extent of inhibition of KDR tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor or lung at trough.

Treatment with HRGP led to increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation in the tumors. In contrast, HRGP did not affect apoptosis or DNA synthesis in endothelial cells or tumor cells in vitro. The mechanism of action of HRGP involves rearrangement of focal adhesions and decreased attachment of endothelial cells to vitronectin and, as a consequence, reduced endothelial cell migration. By using truncated versions of HRGP, we demonstrate that the isolated 150 amino acid-residue His/Pro-rich domain, which is also released by spontaneous proteolysis from purified HRGP, mediates the inhibitory effect on chemotaxis. Moreover, the His/Pro-rich domain must be released from HRGP to exert its effect.

Inhibition of Tie2, using a kinase-deficient Tie2 construct, decreases growth of malignant human astrocytoma subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts. Tie2 inactivation disrupted the tumor vascularity, with a decrease in microvascular density, increased presence of abnormally dilated vessels, and loss of interaction between endothelial cells and surrounding smooth muscle cells, all collectively resulting in increased tumor cell apoptosis.

Remaining cells in the poorly perfused regions of tumors could be eradicated by C. novyi-NT. Mechanistic studies showed that the microtubule destabilizers, but not the microtubule stabilizers, radically reduced blood flow to tumors, thereby enlarging the hypoxic niche in which C. novyi-NT spores could germinate.

The expression of IL-8 by solid tumors is thought to be primarily due to intrinsic influences, such as constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). However, VEGF expression is responsive to glucose deprivation, suggesting that low concentrations of nutrients other than oxygen may play a role in triggering the pro-angiogenic phenotype. Glucose deprivation causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and alters gene expression through the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway. A branch of the UPR, known as the ER overload response (EOR), can cause NF-kappaB activation. Thus, we hypothesized that treatments that cause ER stress and deprivation of other nutrients, such as amino acids, would trigger the expression of angiogenic cytokines by breast cancer cell lines.\nWe found that glutamine deprivation and treatment with a chemical inducer of ER stress (tunicamycin) caused a marked induction of the secretion of both VEGF and IL-8 protein by a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (TSE cells). Glutamine deprivation, glucose deprivation and several chemical inducers of ER stress increased VEGF and IL-8 mRNA expression in TSE and other breast cancer cell lines cultured under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, though hypoxia generally diminished the effects of glucose deprivation. Of all amino acids tested, ambient glutamine availability had the largest effect on VEGF and IL-8 mRNA expression. The induction of VEGF mRNA expression, but not IL-8, was sustained and closely corresponded with the upregulated expression of the ER stress-responsive genes glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153 (GADD153).\nThese results suggest that nutrient deprivation within the solid tumor microenvironment might contribute to the activation of a pro-angiogenic phenotype.

Naked DNA intramuscular injection of an expression vector plasmid producing IL-12 resulted in significant, well-tolerated elevation of serum IL-12 levels. Injection of the IL-12 plasmid at least 2 days, and up to 20 days, before subcutaneous injection of matrigel with angiogenic factors resulted in strong prevention of angiogenesis in both C57/bl and nude mice. A single injection of the IL-12 plasmid contemporarily with the matrigel or 2 days after resulted in partial, statistically not significant, inhibition. Control plasmid injection did not affect either angiogenesis or angiogenesis inhibition by IL-12 protein in vivo. Angiogenesis inhibition was observed in NK cell-depleted C57/bl and nude mice as well as in IFN-gamma(-/-) and CXCR3(-/-) knockout mice, indicating that NK- and/or T-cell-initiated IFN-gamma-chemokine cascades were not involved in the angiogenesis inhibition observed in vivo. Finally, IL-12 plasmid DNA gene transfer significantly prevented the growth and vascularization of highly angiogenic KS-Imm Kaposi's sarcoma and TS/A murine mammary carcinoma tumors in nude and/or syngeneic mice.

Surgery remains the only treatment as the primary tumor and metastases resist radio- and chemotherapies. MTC produces high amounts of prostaglandins (PGs). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have an antitumoral effect, generally related to the decrease of PG levels. We assessed the therapeutic potential of indomethacin in a model of human (TT cells) tumors in nude mice. Indomethacin (1.5 or 2.0 mg/kg body weight.d for 7 wk) inhibited tumor volume by 49 or 77%, respectively, and decreased the plasma level of CT. Although the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling method revealed few apoptotic nuclei, the number of proliferating cells was significantly decreased (Ki-67 antigen study). Immunological effector recruitment and vascular network was not modified by treatment. The inducible synthesis enzyme, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), was revealed only in infiltrating cells, both in treated and control tumors. The expression of the constitutive synthesis enzyme COX-1 was diminished, and the expression of 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase, the key enzyme catabolizing PGs, was increased in treated tumors. Thus, our results demonstrated the potential of indomethacin, inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, to prevent MTC growth.

To determine if synthetic peptides also possessed these properties, we tested a series of polypeptides containing structural motifs from different proteins for their ability to bind [(3)H]hyaluronan, and identified one compound termed P4 that had a particularly strong interaction. Further studies revealed that P4 also inhibited the growth of tumor cells in tissue culture as well as on the chorioallantoic membranes of chicken embryos. In addition, expression vectors for P4 caused tumor cells to grow slower in nude mice and reduced their vascularization. The P4 peptide also inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membranes of chicken embryos. Studies on cultured cells indicated that P4 induced apoptosis, which was blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Confocal microscopy revealed that shortly after its uptake, P4 became associated with mitochondria. Immunoprecipitation indicated that P4 could bind to Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), which are associated with mitochondria and regulate apoptosis. This was also supported by the fact that P4 induced the release of cytochrome c from preparations of mitochondria. Taken together, these results suggest that P4 binds to Bcl-2 and related proteins and this activates the apoptotic cascade.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2004-01-22", "authors": ["NinfeiLiu", "Xue-MingXu", "JinguoChen", "LupingWang", "ShanminYang", "Charles BUnderhill", "LurongZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.11636"}

To study the in vivo antitumor activities of IL-21, TS/A murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells were genetically modified to secrete IL-21 (TS/A-IL-21). These cells developed small tumors that were subsequently rejected by 90% of s.c. injected syngeneic mice. Five days after injection, TS/A-IL-21 tumors showed numerous infiltrating granulocytes, NK cells, and to a lesser extent CD8(+) T cells, along with the expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. At day 7, CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells increased together with IFN-gamma, and the CXC chemokines IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and IFN-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant. The TS/A-IL-21 tumor displayed a disrupted vascular network with abortive sprouting and signs of endothelial cell damage. In vivo depletion experiments by specific Abs showed that rejection of TS/A-IL-21 cells required CD8(+) T lymphocytes and granulocytes. When injected in IFN-gamma-deficient mice, TS/A-IL-21 cells formed tumors that regressed in only 29% of animals, indicating a role for IFN-gamma in IL-21-mediated antitumor response, but also the existence of IFN-gamma-independent effects. Most immunocompetent mice rejecting TS/A-IL-21 cells developed protective immunity against TS/A-pc (75%) and against the antigenically related C26 colon carcinoma cells (61%), as indicated by rechallenge experiments. A specific CTL response against the gp70-env protein of an endogenous murine retrovirus coexpressed by TS/A and C26 cells was detected in mice rejecting TS/A-IL-21 cells.

We hypothesized that adipose tissue may contain progenitor cells with angiogenic potential and that therapy based on adipose tissue-derived progenitor cells administration may constitute a promising cell therapy in patients with ischemic disease.\nIn mice, cultured stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) cells from adipose tissue have a great proangiogenic potential, comparable to that of bone marrow mononuclear cells in the mouse ischemic hindlimb model. Similarly, cultured human SVF cells differentiate into endothelial cells, incorporate into vessels, and promote both postischemic neovascularization in nude mice and vessel-like structure formation in Matrigel plug. In vitro, these cells represent a homogeneous population of CD34- and CD13-positive cells, which can spontaneously express the endothelial cell markers CD31 and von Willebrand factor when cultured in semisolid medium. Interestingly, dedifferentiated mature human adipocytes have the potential to rapidly acquire the endothelial phenotype in vitro and to promote neovascularization in ischemic tissue and vessel-like structure formation in Matrigel plug, suggesting that cells of endothelial and adipocyte phenotypes may have a common precursor.\nThis study demonstrates, for the first time, that adipocytes and endothelial cells have a common progenitor. Such adipose lineage cells participate in vascular-like structure formation in Matrigel plug and enhance the neovascularization reaction in ischemic tissue.

{"title": "Re-evaluating therapeutic neovascularization.", "abstract": "Numerous animal studies have established that neo-vascularization of ischemic tissue can be enhanced with exogenous growth factors and small clinical studies have shown encouraging results. However, the two largest randomized clinical trials to date were negative. Mechanistically, the major stimuli for neo-vascularization are hypoxia and inflammation. Hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF-1) is a 'master switch' protein that is generated in response to hypoxia and binds to more than 40 hypoxia sensitive genes, inducing a panoply of angiogenic and protective metabolic responses. Inflammatory signals recruit T-lymphocytes and macrophages into areas of neo-vascularization which act as a source of angiogenic and arteriogenic factors. Although hypoxia and inflammation are interdependent in eliciting neo-vascular responses, angiogenesis appears to be hypoxia-dependent, whereas inflammation and hemodynamic factors drive arteriogenesis. The negative outcome of the two largest trials may have many reasons. There are issues relating to patient selection, choice of growth factor therapy, dosing and route administration, concomitant medication, trial design including the efficacy parameters that were selected and a lack of sufficient insight into the mechanisms that are responsible for neo-vascularization. In order to move forward the therapeutic objective should be switched to arteriogenesis although this process is even more poorly understood than angiogenesis. Genetic studies in mice with intrinsically different arteriogenic responses combined with studies in human populations with differences in the extent of collateral development may provide fundamental insight into arteriogenic mechanisms. Attention should also be focused on the way in which arteriogenesis is stimulated and the endpoints of clinical trials should be redefined.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2004-01-22", "authors": ["E Dde Muinck", "MSimons"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2003.10.002"}

To understand the evolution and regulation of this gene in vertebrates, we have isolated and characterized the zebrafish vegf-A gene and compared it with VEGF-A genes of human, mouse as well as an in silico isolated VEGF-A homologue from pufferfish. Our results indicate that the zebrafish vegf-A gene is organized similarly to mammalian and Fugu VEGF-A genes, with eight exons interrupted by seven introns. However, zebrafish vegf-A introns are generally larger than mammalian introns while Fugu VEGF-A introns are much smaller. Furthermore, zebrafish exon 6 (z6) has a unique sequence while Fugu's exon 6 is highly homologous to the mammalian counterparts. Alternative splicing generates multiple vegf-A mRNA isoforms in zebrafish with Vegf(121) as the dominant isoform in adult and Vegf(165) as the dominant isoform in early embryos. The exon z6 containing isoform Vegf(12345z678) is only detected in heart, muscle, and early embryos while another isoform Vegf-A(1234577)(a)(8) is only detected in heart. Furthermore, no conserved 5' flanking sequences between zebrafish and Fugu were observed while numerous conserved regions exist between human and mouse in this area. These results suggest both conserved and diverged functions of VEGF-A from fish to mammals since the separation of these two groups from their common ancestor about 450 million years ago and a diverged regulation of this gene since the separation of zebrafish from Fugu.

We have tested the importance of increased angiogenic signaling in the NeuYD [mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu(ndl)-YD5] mammary tumor model. Transgenic mice expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(164) from the MMTV promoter were generated. These mice expressed VEGF(164) RNA and protein at 20- to 40-fold higher levels throughout mammary gland development but exhibited normal mammary gland development and function. However, in combination with the NeuYD oncogene, VEGF(164) expression resulted in increased vascularization of hyperplastic mammary epithelium and dramatic acceleration of tumor appearance from 111 to 51 days. Gene expression profiling also indicated that the VEGF-accelerated tumors were substantially more vascularized and less hypoxic. The preferential vascularization of early hyperplastic portions of mammary epithelia in NeuYD;MMTV-VEGF animals was associated with NeuYD RNA expression, disorganization of the tight junctions, and overlapping transgenic VEGF expression. NeuYD;MMTV-VEGF(164) bigenic, tumor-bearing animals resulted in an average of 10 tumor cell colonies/lung lodged within vascular spaces. No similar lung colonies were found in control NeuYD mice with similar tumor burdens. Overall, these results demonstrate the angiogenic restriction of early hyperplastic mammary lesions.

We herein selected clones stably transfected with this anti-cathepsin L ScFv and analyzed them for changes in tumor growth and metastasis. We show that in stably transfected clones, anti-cathepsin L ScFv strongly inhibited the secretion of procathepsin L without modifying the intracellular amount or processing pattern of cathepsin L forms. Confocal analysis demonstrated colocalization of endogenous cathepsin L and anti-cathepsin L ScFv. In addition, expression of this ScFv strongly inhibited generation of tumor and metastasis by these human melanoma clones in nude mice. In vivo, the anti-cathepsin L ScFv-transfected cells produced tumors with decreased vascularization (angiogenesis) concomitant with increased apoptosis of tumor cells. Matrigel assay also demonstrated that melanoma invasiveness was completely abolished.

Removal of the endothelium caused a marked leftward shift of concentration responses to high K(+), U46619, 5-HT, and ET-1, and revealed contractile responses to phenylephrine and norepinephrine. In U46619-preconstricted arteries, BQ 123 converted ET-1-induced contractions to relaxations (maximal relaxation of 57 +/- 8%), which were subsequently blocked by the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788.

This phenotype was at least partly due to impaired vascularization surrounding the epiphysis, resulting in ectopically increased hypoxia and massive chondrocyte apoptosis in the interior of the epiphyseal cartilage. In addition to the vascular defect, we provide in vitro evidence that the VEGF(188) isoform alone is also insufficient to regulate chondrocyte proliferation and survival responses to hypoxia.

This system has potential application in the visual rehabilitation of other cases of corneal irregularity, including unsuccessful refractive surgery, ocular trauma, and keratoplasty.

However, tumor angiogenesis is not controlled simply by the presence of VEGF, and is likely regulated by several angiogenic factors produced by tumor and host cells. The goal of the present study was to determine the angiogenic profile of precancerous and cancerous lesions of the esophagus. Expression of mRNAs for VEGF, platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and interleukin (IL)-8 was examined in six esophageal carcinoma cell lines and fresh biopsy specimens from 16 patients with invasive esophageal carcinoma by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical analyses with antibodies against VEGF, PD-ECGF, bFGF, and IL-8 were performed on archival specimens of 60 normal esophageal mucosa, 11 dysplasias and 49 carcinomas of the esophagus. Microvessels were stained with anti-CD34 antibody and quantified by counting the number of vessels in a x200 field in the most vascularized areas of the tumor. Esophageal carcinoma cell lines and tumor tissues expressed mRNAs for one or more these angiogenic factors at various levels. An initial increase in vessel density and enhanced expression of PD-ECGF and VEGF were observed in dysplastic epithelium. Vessel density was significantly higher in more advanced lesions. bFGF and IL-8 were not expressed in dysplasias and mucosal carcinomas, but expression was increased in late stage squamous cell carcinoma. These findings suggest that the angiogenic switch is a very early event in the development of invasive carcinoma.

This becomes a major problem for studying long-term biological phenomena in photoprotection and epidermal skin cancers. We report here a simplified surgical technique in immunotolerant mice allowing long-term studies. The creation of a vascularized mouse skin flap is the key point of the surgical procedure. Long-term pigmentation of the xenografts seemed macroscopically successful, but surprisingly microscopy at 11 and 16 weeks postgrafting showed mostly dermal pigment aggregates and rare Melan-A positive dermal and epidermal pigment cells.

Application of sodium nitroprusside did not further increase arterial diameter following acetylcholine exposure. After washing out, arterial luminal diameters returned to initial values. Second exposure to vasoactive agents demonstrated that changes in diameter were reproducible with time and not different between left and right saphenous arteries.

The anatomic and neurophysiological basis for such a mechanism is the following: 1) a significant portion of group III and IV afferent fibers have been found in the vicinity and the adventitia of the arterioles and the venules; 2) both of these groups of afferent fibers can respond to mechanical stimuli; 3) a population of group III and IV fibers stimulated during muscle contraction has been found to be inhibited to various degrees by arterial occlusion; and 4) more recently, direct evidence has been obtained showing that a part of the group IV muscle afferent fibers is stimulated by venous occlusion and by injection of vasodilatory agents. The physiological relevance of sensing local distension of the vascular network at venular level in the muscles is clearly different from that of the large veins, since the former can directly monitor the degree of tissue perfusion. The possible involvement of this sensing mechanism in respiratory control is discussed mainly in the light of the ventilatory effects of peripheral vascular occlusions during and after muscular exercise. It is proposed that this regulatory system anticipates the chemical changes that would occur in the arterial blood during increased metabolic load and attempts to minimize them by adjusting the level of ventilation to the level of muscle perfusion, thus matching the magnitudes of the peripheral and pulmonary gas exchange.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2004-01-13", "authors": ["PhilippeHaouzi", "BrunoChenuel", "AndrewHuszczuk"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00597.2003"}

O2 toxicity is mediated through reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are constantly generated as byproducts of normal cellular metabolism, but their production is increased in various pathological states, and also upon exposure to exogenous oxidants, such as hyperoxia. Antioxidants, either enzymatic or nonenzymatic, protect the lung against the deleterious effects of ROS. Expression of various pulmonary antioxidants is developmentally regulated in many species so that the expression is increased toward term gestation, as if in anticipation of birth into an O2-rich extrauterine environment. Therefore, the lungs of prematurely born infants may be ill-adapted for protection against ROS. While premature birth interrupts normal lung development, the clinical condition necessitating the administration of high inhaled O2 concentrations may lead to permanent impairment of alveolar development. An understanding of the processes involved in lung growth, especially in alveolarization and vascularization, as well as in repair of injured lung tissue, may facilitate development of strategies to enhance these processes.", "journal": "Antioxidants & redox signaling", "date": "2004-01-10", "authors": ["Tiina MAsikainen", "Carl WWhite"], "doi": "10.1089/152308604771978462"}
{"title": "Effects of adrenomedullin on endothelial cells in the multistep process of angiogenesis: involvement of CRLR/RAMP2 and CRLR/RAMP3 receptors.", "abstract": "Recently, we demonstrated that U87 glioblastoma xenograft tumors treated with anti-adrenomedullin (AM) antibody were less vascularized than control tumors, suggesting that AM might be involved in neovascularization and/or vessel stabilization. Angiogenesis, the sprouting of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, is a multistep process that involves migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, remodeling of the extracellular matrix and functional maturation of the newly assembled vessels. In our study, we analyzed the role of AM on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) phenotype related to different stages of angiogenesis. Here we report evidence that AM promoted HUVEC migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. The action of AM is specific and is mediated by the calcitonin receptor-like receptor/receptor activity-modifying protein-2 and -3 (CRLR/RAMP2; CRLR/RAMP3) receptors. Furthermore, AM was able to induce HUVEC differentiation into cord-like structures on Matrigel. Suboptimal concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and AM acted synergistically to induce angiogenic-related effects on endothelial cells in vitro. Blocking antibodies to VEGF did not significantly inhibit AM-induced capillary tube formation by human endothelial cells, indicating that AM does not function indirectly through upregulation of VEGF. These findings suggest that the proangiogenic action of AM on cultured endothelial cells via CRLR/RAMP2 and CRLR/RAMP3 receptors may translate in vivo into enhanced neovascularization and therefore identify AM and its receptors acting as potential new targets for antiangiogenic therapies.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2004-01-09", "authors": ["SamanthaFernandez-Sauze", "ChristineDelfino", "KamelMabrouk", "ChristopheDussert", "OlivierChinot", "Pierre-MarieMartin", "FrancoisGrisoli", "L'HoucineOuafik", "Fran\u00e7oiseBoudouresque"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.11663"}

Proliferative and metabolic heterogeneity in these perinecrotic regions were assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, by immunocytological and by histochemical analyses. The borders of necrotic regions are comprised of glioma cells that express increased levels of the type 1 glucose transporter (GLUT-1) with rare cells having incorporated BrdU. By contrast, BrdU-positive glioma cells are located immediately adjacent to GLUT-1-positive cells bordering areas of necrosis. BrdU-positive glioma cells are also scattered throughout poorly vascularized, central regions of the tumor and are present at the highly vascularized tumor periphery. GLUT-1 expression increased considerably when C6 glioma cells were grown for 48 h under either the acidotic conditions of pH 6.8 or under hypoxic conditions. The perinecrotic GLUT-1-positive glioma cells in poorly vascularized, centrally located tumor regions demonstrated a 75% reduction in glycogen content and negligible glycogenolytic capacity, when compared with normal brain white matter. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) maintained 50% enzymatic activity compared to controls, while succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was 25% of control values. Based upon these findings, a metabolic model is proposed in which GLUT-1-positive perinecrotic cells are growth arrested and predominantly rely upon non-oxidative glycolysis. It is further postulated that BrdU-positive, GLUT-1-negative glioma cells within the poorly vascularized, central tumor region convert glucose-6-phosphate to nucleotide precursors for DNA replication.", "journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "date": "2004-01-09", "authors": ["FredricGorin", "WilliamHarley", "JoachimSchnier", "BruceLyeth", "ThomasJue"], "doi": "10.1007/s00401-003-0803-1"}

The use of indocyanine green angiography and subsequently of optical coherent tomography has widened our ability to study and understand the pathophysiology of this disorder. The primary abnormality involves the choroidal circulation, and the characteristic lesion is an inner choroidal vascular network of vessels ending in an aneurysmal bulge or outward projection, visible clinically as a reddish orange, spheroid, polyp-like structure. We have also recognized that individuals of African-American and Asian descents are more at risk for developing polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy as the disorder seems to preferentially affect pigmented individuals. However, it has been shown that while that still holds true, patients of other racial backgrounds may be afflicted. Particularly, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy has been found to be present in about 8-13% of white patients with clinical appearance of exudative age-related macular degeneration. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy has also been reported in Irish, French, German, and Italian patients. The natural course of the disease often follows a remitting-relapsing course, and clinically, it is associated with chronic, multiple, recurrent serosanguineous detachments of the retinal pigment epithelium and neurosensory retina with long-term preservation of good vision. Photodynamic treatment appears to be a promising alternative to conventional laser therapy, for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.

The purpose of this study was to develop a comparable model in mice, which could enable genetic mutants to be used to more extensively study the mechanisms of the angiogenesis, matrix production, and cellular migration and differentiation that occur in these models. A model that involves placing a split silicone tube around blood vessels in the mouse groin was developed and was demonstrated to successfully induce the formation of new vascularized tissue. Two vessel configurations, namely, a flow-through pedicle (n = 18 for three time points) and a ligated vascular pedicle (n = 18), were compared. The suitability of chambers constructed from either polycarbonate or silicone and the effects of incorporating either Matrigel equivalent (n = 18) or poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (n = 18) on angiogenesis and tissue production were also tested. Empty chambers, chambers with vessels only, and chambers with matrix only served as control chambers. The results demonstrated that a flow-through type of vascular pedicle, rather than a ligated pedicle, was more reliable in terms of patency, angiogenesis, and tissue production, as were silicone chambers, compared with polycarbonate chambers. Marked angiogenesis occurred with both types of extracellular matrix scaffolds, and there was evidence that native cells could migrate into and survive within the added matrix, generating a vascularized three-dimensional construct. When Matrigel was used as the matrix, the chambers filled with adipose tissue, creating a highly vascularized fat flap. In some cases, new breast-like acini and duct tissue appeared within the fat. When poly(dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid) was used, the chambers filled with granulation and fibrous tissue but no fat or breast tissue was observed. No significant amount of tissue was generated in the control chambers. Operative times were short (25 minutes), and two chambers could be inserted into each mouse.

The authors present their experience with 33 patients in whom massive thoracolumbar wounds and vertebral osteomyelitis developed following scoliosis surgery. Postoperative infection, due to the lack of vascularized tissue and presence of metallic hardware near the wound, is common and extremely counterproductive; within these cavernous wounds lie infected vertebrae, metallic hardware, and bone graft. The use of a modified and extended latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap to close and supply blood to wounds in the lower thoracic and thoracolumbar areas is described. This surgical approach, predicated on effective d\u00e9bridement along with reconstruction by transposition of vascularized tissue, allows the wound to close and drastically decreases the risk of postoperative infection. Furthermore, for wounds already infected, the procedure allows for closure and increased blood supply to the area, thus giving the wound a much greater ability to heal. For wounds involving the lumbosacral area, the authors combine this with a transposed gluteus maximus muscle flap to obtain coverage over the caudal extent of the wound.

The skin portion of the iliac osteocutaneous flap often necrotizes in cases without perforators of the deep circumflex iliac vessel. To overcome these problems, eight patients with established mandibular loss and no skin perforators of the deep circumflex iliac vessel were treated with a sequential vascularized iliac bone graft and a superficial circumflex iliac perforator flap with a single recipient vessel. Regarding the recipient vessels, the ipsilateral cervical vessels were used for four patients, and the contralateral facial and ipsilateral superficial temporal vessels were used for two cases each. The superficial circumflex iliac perforator flaps were 7 to 28 cm in length and 3 to 15 cm in width. The iliac bone grafts ranged from 7 to 13 cm in length, and three cases were repaired with the inner cortex of the iliac bone. There were no serious complications, such as flap necrosis or bone infection and resulting absorption. The advantages of this method are that both pedicles are very close to each other and of suitable diameter for anastomosis. Simultaneous flap elevation and preparation for the recipient site is possible. The skin flap and vascularized bone graft can be obtained from the same donor site. A single source vessel can nourish both the large skin area and bone sequentially. Longer dissection of the superficial circumflex iliac system to the proximal femoral division is unnecessary. A large flap can survive with a short segment of the superficial circumflex iliac system.

There were five female and eight male patients, with a mean age of 32 years (range, 17 to 50 years). The mean length of the mandibular defect was 8.8 cm (range, 5 to 13 cm). All free fibula flap procedures were successful, with no reexplorations or partial flap losses. There was no clinical or radiographic evidence of failure during the osseointegration process for any implant. With functional occlusal loading, the marginal bone loss around the implants was less than 1.5 mm in a mean follow-up period of 40 months (range, 18 to 70 months). There were no recurrences during that time. The technique described allows improved access to the bone at the time of reconstruction, immediate assessment of alveolar ridge relationships, and accurate fixation of the implant-fibula construct. The advantages of this procedure include a reduced risk of recurrence with segmental resection, reliable mandibular reconstruction, and reduction of the number of surgical procedures, allowing full oral rehabilitation in a shorter time. It is concluded that segmental mandibulectomy and immediate vascularized fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap reconstruction, with simultaneous placement of osseointegrated implants, represent an ideal treatment method for large ameloblastomas of the mandible.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-01-07", "authors": ["Jagdeep SChana", "Yang-MingChang", "Fu-ChanWei", "Yu-FenShen", "Chiu-PoChan", "Hsiu-NaLin", "Chi-YingTsai", "Seng-FengJeng"], "doi": "10.1097/01.PRS.0000097719.69616.29"}
{"title": "Total lower lip reconstruction with a composite radial forearm-palmaris longus tendon flap: a clinical series.", "abstract": "Large, full-thickness lip defects after head and neck surgery continue to be a challenge for reconstructive surgeons. The reconstructive aims are to restore the oral lining, the external cheek, oral competence, and function (i.e., articulation, speech, and mastication). The authors' refinement of the composite radial forearm-palmaris longus free flap technique meets these criteria and allows a functional reconstruction of extensive lip and cheek defects in one stage. A composite radial forearm flap including the palmaris longus tendon was designed. The skin flap for the reconstruction of the intraoral lining and the skin defect was folded over the palmaris longus tendon. Both ends of the vascularized tendon were laid through the bilateral modiolus and anchored with adequate tension to the intact orbicularis muscle of the upper lip. This procedure was used in 12 patients. Six patients had cancer of the lower lip, five patients had a buccal cancer involving the lip, and one patient had a primary gum cancer that extended to the lower lip. Total to near-total resection (more than 80 percent) of the lower lip was indicated in six patients. In two other patients, the cancer ablation included more than 80 percent of the lower lip and up to 40 percent of the upper lip. A radial forearm palmaris longus free flap was used in all cases for reconstruction of the defect. Free flap survival was 100 percent. At the time of final evaluation, which was 1 year after the operation, all patients had good oral continence at rest (static suspension) and had achieved sufficient oral competence when eating. Ten patients were able to resume a regular diet, and two patients could eat a soft diet. All patients regained normal or near-normal speech and had an acceptable appearance. The described refinement of the composite radial palmaris longus free flap technique allows the reconstruction of the lower lip with a functioning oral sphincter; the technique can be recommended for patients who need large lower lip resection. It provides functional recovery of the reconstructed lower lip synchronizing with the remaining upper lip.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-01-07", "authors": ["Seng-FengJeng", "Yur-RenKuo", "Fu-ChanWei", "Chih-YingSu", "Chih-YenChien"], "doi": "10.1097/01.PRS.0000090722.16689.9A"}
{"title": "Down-regulation of caveolin-1 in glioma vasculature: modulation by radiotherapy.", "abstract": "Primary brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas (GB), remain a challenge for oncology. An element of the malignant brain tumors' aggressive behavior is the fact that GB are among the most densely vascularized tumors. To determine some of the molecular regulations occuring at the brain tumor endothelium level during tumoral progression would be an asset in understanding brain tumor biology. Caveolin-1 is an essential structural constituent of caveolae that has been implicated in mitogenic signaling, oncogenesis, and angiogenesis. In this work we investigated regulation of caveolin-1 expression in brain endothelial cells (ECs) under angiogenic conditions. In vitro, brain EC caveolin-1 is down-regulated by angiogenic factors treament and by hypoxia. Coculture of brain ECs with tumoral cells induced a similar down-regulation. In addition, activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase is demonstrated. By using an in vivo brain tumor model, we purified ECs from gliomas as well as from normal brain to investigate possible regulation of caveolin-1 expression in tumoral brain vasculature. We show that caveolin-1 expression is strikingly down-regulated in glioma ECs, whereas an increase of phosphorylated caveolin-1 is observed. Whole-brain radiation treatment, a classical way in which GB is currently being treated, resulted in increased caveolin-1 expression in tumor isolated ECs. The level of tumor cells spreading around newly formed blood vessels was also elevated. The regulation of caveolin-1 expression in tumoral ECs may reflect the tumoral vasculature state and correlates with angiogenesis kinetics.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience research", "date": "2004-01-06", "authors": ["AnthonyR\u00e9gina", "JulieJodoin", "PaulKhoueir", "Yann\u00e8veRolland", "FranceBerthelet", "RobertMoumdjian", "LaurenceFenart", "RomeoCecchelli", "MichelDemeule", "RichardB\u00e9liveau"], "doi": "10.1002/jnr.10865"}

During early embryogenesis, Ets-1 is expressed in migrating neural crest cells from which melanocytes arise. In the present study, we analyzed Ets-1 expression in various melanocytic lesions and investigated its functional importance in malignant melanomas. We found that Ets-1 was upregulated both in vivo and in vitro in malignant melanoma, compared to benign melanocytic lesions and to primary melanocytes. Assessment of DNA-binding and transactivation assays documented a strong Ets activity in melanoma cells. Using an antisense strategy, the expression and activity of Ets-1 were reduced in the melanoma cell line Mel Im. This correlated with a diminished expression of several Ets-1 target genes known to be involved in invasion, such as MMP1, MMP3, uPA and integrin beta3. In line with these findings, the invasive potential of the melanoma cells measured in a Boyden Chamber model was reduced up to 60% after Ets-1 blockade. This can be attributed to the role of Ets-1 in transcriptional regulation of factors involved in invasion of melanoma cells. We conclude that over-expression of Ets-1 during melanoma development contributes to the malignant phenotype.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS", "date": "2004-01-06", "authors": ["TRothhammer", "J CHahne", "AFlorin", "IPoser", "FSoncin", "NWernert", "A-KBosserhoff"], "doi": "10.1007/s00018-003-3337-8"}

{"title": "Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and association with microvessel density in small-cell and non-small-cell lung carcinomas.", "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that tumor angiogenesis is a prognostic factor for various malignant neoplasms. Specifically, in non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) most reports show an association between neovascularization and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression as well as the presence of metastases and survival, although a few reports do not agree with these findings. Angiogenesis is not clearly characterized in small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs), since they are rarely treated by surgery, and thus the available tissue for biological characterization is sparse. The aim of the present study was to investigate angiogenesis and the expression of VEGF in lung tumors. We examined 88 non-small-cell and 39 small-cell lung carcinomas. Angiogenesis was estimated by determining microvessel counts, with the use of anti-CD31 and anti-factor VIII antibodies and expression of VEGF was also evaluated immunohistochemically. Our data showed that in NSCLCs angiogenesis was more prominent in poorly-differentiated neoplasms and correlated with VEGF expression, therefore it is at least in part mediated by the latter. Interestingly, in SCLCs a higher vascularization was noted. However, there was no strong association with VEGF expression. Thus, small-cell lung carcinoma may represent a suitable neoplasm for testing antiangiogenic drugs in combination with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, antiangiogenic therapy should not be targeted specifically to the VEGF pathway, since in SCLCs other mediators of angiogenesis may be important as well.", "journal": "Histology and histopathology", "date": "2004-01-01", "authors": ["DStefanou", "ABatistatou", "EArkoumani", "ENtzani", "N JAgnantis"], "doi": "10.14670/HH-19.37"}

{"title": "Hemangioblasts, angioblasts, and adult endothelial cell progenitors.", "abstract": "After decades of speculation, proof of embryonic hemangioblasts finally emerged a few years ago. Surprisingly, at about the same time, evidence for adult hemangioblasts began to appear, and recent single-cell bone marrow transplants have confirmed their existence. Embryonic and adult hemangioblasts appear to share antigenic determinants, including CD34, ACC133, and VEGFR2, although their phenotype may be plastic. They also respond to similar factors, prominent among them vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the adult, hemangioblasts reside principally in the bone marrow, although they may subsequently leave that niche to reside in nonhematopoietic tissues. A number of studies indicate that these cells or their progeny may be a significant source of endothelial cells in adult pathologic and nonpathologic vascularization, and may participate in vascular repair. In addition to hemangioblasts, a more differentiated source of endothelial cell progenitors may be present in the blood, namely, monocytes or monocytic-like cells. The relative importance of the two cell types in vivo is not clear, though endothelial cells derived from the two sources may not be identical, and hemangioblasts seem to provide a stimulus for differentiation of the monocytes. Treatment with exogenous bone marrow-derived cells can promote neovascularization, accelerate restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues, and improve cardiac function after infarct. Hence, there is great hope that either alone, in combination with angiogenic factors, or as gene therapy vectors, we can harness these cells to treat ischemic and vascular diseases in the relatively near future.", "journal": "The anatomical record.

The most recent advances in cell biology and tissue engineering have utilized various avascular and acellular collagen scaffolds with or without seeded cells. These techniques, however, are frequently complicated by tissue necrosis, contracture and resorption due to limited vascularization. We employed a new three-stage, evolving animal model with stage I optimizing the culture delivery vehicle, stage II employing a seeded vascularized capsule flap, and stage III adding a contractile matrix in the form of pedicled gracilis muscle prelaminated with autologous, in vitro-expanded urothelial cells to reconstruct an entire supratrigonal bladder-wall defect in rats.Specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), alpha(1)-actin staining, and a specific immunohistochemical staining (AE(1)&AE(3)-anticytoceratin monoclonal antibody stain) showed a continuous, multilayered, functioning urothelial lining along the transposed prelaminated gracilis flap in the animals of the final-stage experiment. Successful urinary reconstruction requires a contractile neoreservoir resistant to resorption over time and a stable, protective urothelial lining. We demonstrated that a gracilis muscle flap can be seeded with autologous cultured urothelial cells suspended in fibrin glue. This prelaminated flap can be safely transposed onto its pedicle and become successfully integrated into the remaining bladder wall, demonstrating urothelial lining and the potential to contract. Further studies in larger animals with urodynamic assessment is warranted to determine if this type of bladder-wall replacement technique is suitable for urinary reconstruction in humans.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2003-12-31", "authors": ["ThomasSchoeller", "Michael WNeumeister", "Georg MHuemer", "Robert CRussell", "SeanLille", "AngelaOtto-Schoeller", "GottfriedWechselberger"], "doi": "10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00518-0"}

The kinetics and impact of neovascular maturation and functionality, in dormancy, and growth of MLS spheroid xenografts were studied noninvasively by BOLD contrast MRI. MR data were supported by histologic staining for biotinylated albumin as a blood pool marker and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) as marker for perivascular mural cells. Although the tumor periphery showed higher levels of total and mature vasculature than normal skin, the fraction of mature out of the total vessels as detected by MRI vascular maturation index (VMI(MRI)) was significantly lower in the tumor both before and after tumor exit from dormancy. The neovasculature induced by the implanted spheroid was unstable and showed cycles of vessel growth and regression. Surprisingly, this instability was not restricted to the immature vessels, but rather included also regression of mature vessels. During dormancy, neovasculature was predominantly peripheral with no infiltration into the implanted spheroid. Infiltration of alpha-SMA positive stroma cells into the spheroid was associated with functional vascularization and tumor growth.

VEGF is a key growth factor during vascular development and one of its receptors, KDR, plays a pivotal role in endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation. The purpose of this study was to analyze VEGF and KDR gene expression patterns during the development of the human eye during the embryonic and fetal stages.\nThe gene expression of VEGF and KDR was analyzed by in situ hybridization in 7-week-old embryos and in 10- and 18-week-old fetuses. In addition, we performed VEGF and KDR immunohistochemistry experiments on 18-week-old fetus tissue sections.\nThese results clearly demonstrated that the levels of VEGF and KDR transcripts are correlated during the normal development of the ocular vasculature in humans. The complementarity between the patterns of VEGF and KDR during the early stages of development suggests that VEGF-KDR interactions play a major role in the formation and regression of the hyaloid vascular system (HVS) and in the development of the choriocapillaris. In later stages (i.e., 18-weeks-old fetuses), the expression of KDR seems to be linked to the development of the retinal vascular system. VEGF and KDR transcripts were unexpectedly detected in some nonvascular tissues-that is, in the cornea and in the retina before the development of the retinal vascular system.\nThe expression of VEGF and KDR correlates highly with the normal ocular vascularization in humans, but VEGF may also be necessary for nonvascular retinal developmental functions, especially for the coordination of neural retinal development and the preliminary steps of the establishment of the definitive stable retinal vasculature.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2003-12-24", "authors": ["Kar\u00efnGogat", "LaurenceLe Gat", "Lo\u00efcVan Den Berghe", "DominiqueMarchant", "AlexandraKobetz", "St\u00e9phanieGadin", "BernardGasser", "IsabelleQu\u00e9r\u00e9", "MarcAbitbol", "MauriceMenasche"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.02-1096"}

Recent studies indicate that CD103 expression endows peripheral CD8 cells with a unique capacity to access the epithelial compartments of organ allografts. In the present study we used a nonvascularized mouse renal allograft model to 1) define the mechanisms regulating CD103 expression by graft-infiltrating CD8 effector populations, and 2) identify the cellular compartments in which this occurs. We report that CD8 cells responding to donor alloantigens in host lymphoid compartments do not initially express CD103, but dramatically up-regulate CD103 expression to high levels subsequent to migration to the graft site. CD103+CD8+ cells that infiltrated renal allografts exhibited a classic effector phenotype and were selectively localized to the graft site. CD8 cells expressing low levels of CD103 were also present in lymphoid compartments, but three-color analyses revealed that these are almost exclusively of naive phenotype. Adoptive transfer studies using TCR-transgenic CD8 cells demonstrated that donor-specific CD8 cells rapidly and uniformly up-regulate CD103 expression following entry into the graft site. Donor-specific CD8 cells expressing a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor were highly deficient in CD103 expression following migration to the graft, thereby implicating TGF-beta activity as a dominant controlling factor. The relevance of these data to conventional (vascularized) renal transplantation is confirmed.

{"title": "Hepatitis B virus X protein induces angiogenesis by stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.", "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is closely involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a highly vascularized solid tumor. Here we show that HBx increases the transcriptional activity and protein level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and it also stimulates angiogenesis. HBx directly interacted with the bHLH/PAS domain of HIF-1alpha but not with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). HBx decreased the binding of pVHL to HIF-1alpha and prevented ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha.

{"title": "AAV-mediated gene transfer of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 inhibits vascular tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo.", "abstract": "The activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a universal feature of cellular invasion, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, which is counterbalanced and regulated by the natural tissue inhibitors of MMPs (Timps). Here we show that Timp1 gene transfer delivered by an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector inhibits tumor growth in a murine xenotransplant model. A human Kaposi's sarcoma cell line, forming highly vascularized tumors in vivo and having a high natural permissivity to AAV gene transfer, was transduced to express the Timp1 cDNA. AAV-Timp1-transduced cells secreted high levels of Timp1 that inhibited MMP2 and MMP9 gelatinolytic activity. Following subcutaneous inoculation in nude mice, the AAV-Timp1-transduced cells showed significantly reduced tumor growth when compared to control AAV-LacZ-transduced cells. In addition, direct intratumoral injection of AAV-Timp1 into pre-existing tumors significantly impaired the further expansion of the tumor mass. Histological analyses showed that the AAV-Timp1-transduced tumors had limited development of vascular structures and extensive areas of cell death, suggesting that Timp1 overexpression had an antiangiogenic effect. To further support this conclusion, we demonstrated that AAV-Timp1 transduction significantly reduced endothelial cell migration and the invasion of a Matrigel barrier and strongly inhibited angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. These results indicate that transfer and overexpression of the Timp1 gene is a promising therapeutic strategy to target tumor-associated angiogenesis in cancer gene therapy.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2003-12-19", "authors": ["SerenaZacchigna", "LorenaZentilin", "MonicaMorini", "RaffaellaDell'Eva", "Douglas MNoonan", "AdrianaAlbini", "MauroGiacca"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.cgt.7700657"}

In animal studies, we have reported that shock waves (SW) can promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through superoxide-mediated signal transduction (Wang, F. S., Wang, C. J., Sheen-Chen, S. M., Kuo, Y. R., Chen, R. F., and Yang, K. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 10931-10937) and vascularization of the bone-tendon junction. Here, we found that SW elevation of VEGF-A expression in human osteoblasts to be mediated by Ras-induced superoxide and ERK-dependent HIF-1alpha activation. SW treatment (0.16 mJ/mm(2), 1 Hz, 500 impulses) rapidly activated Ras protein (15 min) and Rac1 protein (30 min) and increased superoxide production in 30 min and VEGF mRNA expression in 6 h. Early scavenging of superoxide, but not nitric oxide, peroxide hydrogen, or prostaglandin E(2), reduced SW-augmented VEGF-A levels. Inhibition of superoxide production by diphenyliodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, was found to suppress VEGF-A expression. Transfection of osteoblasts with a dominant negative (S17N) Ras mutant abrogated the SW enhancement of Rac1 activation, superoxide synthesis, and VEGF expression. Further studies demonstrated that SW significantly promoted ERK activation in 1 h and HIF-1alpha phosphorylation and HIF-1alpha binding to VEGF promoter in 3 h. In support of the observation that superoxide mediated the SW-induced ERK activation and HIF-1alpha transactivation, we further demonstrated that scavenging of superoxide by superoxide dismutase and inhibition of ERK activity by PD98059 decreased HIF-1alpha activation and VEGF-A levels. Moreover, culture medium harvested from SW-treated osteoblasts increased vessel number of chick chorioallantoic membrane. Superoxide dismutase pretreatment and anti-VEGF-A antibody neutralization reduced the promoting effect of conditioned medium on angiogenesis. Thus, modulation of redox reaction by SW may have some positive effect on angiogenesis during bone regeneration.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2003-12-19", "authors": ["Feng-ShengWang", "Ching-JenWang", "Yeung-JenChen", "Per-RongChang", "Yu-TingHuang", "Yi-ChihSun", "Hueng-ChenHuang", "Ya-JuYang", "Kuender DYang"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M308013200"}

Notch4, which is the product of the proto-oncogene Int3 and an endothelial cell-specific mammalian isoform of Notch, accumulated in Fbw7(-/-) embryos, resulting in an increased expression of Hey1, which encodes a transcriptional repressor that acts downstream of Notch signaling and is implicated in vascular development.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess follicle survival after cryopreservation and transplantation of cat ovarian tissue into non-obese diabetic severely combined immunodeficient (NOD SCID) mice; and (2) evaluate the effects of gonadotropin treatments on follicular development in the transplanted tissue. Slices from the cat ovarian cortex were frozen and after thawing, transplanted under each kidney capsule of castrated male NOD SCID mice (eight xenografts in four mice). Sixty-two days after surgery, mice were randomly assigned (two per group) to gonadotropin-treated (eCG and hCG 88 h later) or control (saline-treated) groups. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, ovarian tissue was recovered and processed for histology. Fresh ovarian tissue from the same original source was similarly processed. Follicles were counted, measured, and classified as primordial, primary, secondary, or antral. Immunoreactive proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) stain was used to assess follicle viability. Microscopic examination revealed no evidence of necrosis or fibrosis. The grafts were well-vascularized, with follicles at all stages of development. Numbers of follicles in the transplanted tissue were markedly reduced compared to fresh tissue, with approximately 10% of follicles surviving freezing and transplantation procedures. Growing follicles positive for PCNA were found in all xenografts. Gonadotropin treatment did not alter the proportion of resting to growing follicles or mean follicle diameter by comparison with controls from untreated mice. By contrast, luteinization, but not ovulation, of antral follicles was observed only in grafts from treated mice. In summary, frozen-thawed cat ovarian cortex tissue not only survived xenotransplantation, it also contained follicles able to grow to antral stages.

A segment of the iliac crest was elevated on the vascular pedicle and its access to different parts of the acetabulum was evaluated. The average pedicle length was sufficient for coverage of the superior and anterior acetabular walls. The access to the posterior wall, however, required modification of the bone size. A vascularized pedicled iliac crest graft is suitable for the reconstruction of selected acetabular deficiencies.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2003-10-28", "authors": ["GKarakurum", "AG\u00fclec", "OB\u00fcy\u00fckbebeci"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-003-0180-4"}
{"title": "Dual roles of the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) during developmental vascularization.", "abstract": "Here we report that C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), a tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates the activity of Src and related kinases, is important for vascular development. In Csk(-/-) embryos, although vascular tubules were formed and organized into capillary-like networks during the initial genesis of blood vessels, the vessels failed to engage in normal sprout formation. In chimeric embryos containing both wild-type and Csk(-/-) cells, the presence of wild-type cells enabled Csk(-/-) endothelial cells to participate in branching morphogenesis. We suggest that wild-type cells may have supplied an angiogenic factor absent in Csk(-/-) cells. Despite the partial rescue of vascular development in chimeric embryos, the embryos failed to form vitelline vessels and died at E9.5. These results indicate that Csk is required both for angiogenic sprouting and vascular remodeling.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2003-10-25", "authors": ["Li-JuanDuan", "AkiraImamoto", "Guo-HuaFong"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2003-05-1701"}
{"title": "pH regulates vascular endothelial growth factor binding to fibronectin: a mechanism for control of extracellular matrix storage and release.", "abstract": "Hypoxia is one of the major signals that induces angiogenesis. Hypoxic conditions lead to reduced extracellular pH. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding to endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) increases at acidic pH (7.0-5.5). These interactions are dependent on heparan sulfate proteoglycans, but do not depend on the presence of VEGF receptors. Here we report that VEGF(165) and VEGF(121) binding to fibronectin also increased at acidic pH, and that these interactions are further enhanced by the addition of heparin. These results reveal that the accepted non-heparin-binding isoform of VEGF (VEGF(121)) is converted into a heparin-binding growth factor under acidic conditions. Interestingly, we did not observe increased binding of VEGF to collagen type I at acidic pH in the presence or absence of heparin, indicating that this effect is not a general property of all heparin-binding ECM proteins. The high level of VEGF binding at acidic pH was also rapidly reversed as demonstrated by increased rates of VEGF dissociation from fibronectin and fibronectin-heparin matrices as the pH was raised. The VEGF released from fibronectin retained its ability to stimulate the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 in endothelial cells. These results suggest that VEGF may be stored in the extracellular matrix via interactions with fibronectin and heparan sulfate in tissues that are in need of vascularization so that it can aid in directing the dynamic process of growth and migration of new blood vessels.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2003-10-23", "authors": ["Adrienne LGoerges", "Matthew ANugent"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M308482200"}
{"title": "Nicotine promoted colon cancer growth via epidermal growth factor receptor, c-Src, and 5-lipoxygenase-mediated signal pathway.", "abstract": "Nicotine [3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-pyridine], a major alkaloid in tobacco, has been implicated as playing a role in carcinogenesis. Our previous study showed that passive cigarette smoking promoted inflammation-associated colonic adenoma formation in mice, and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) plays an important role in this process. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether nicotine could stimulate colon cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in nude mice xenograft model and the possible mechanisms involved. Results showed that nicotine stimulated SW1116 colon cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Src phosphorylation levels together with protein expression of 5-LOX were also significantly enhanced in this proliferation process. Inhibitors of EGFR and c-Src alleviated the actions of nicotine on cell proliferation and 5-LOX protein expression. Combination of both agents produced additive effect. In contrast, 5-LOX inhibitor had no direct effect on the phosphorylation levels of EGFR and c-Src and yet inhibited cell proliferation. In the colon cancer xenograft model, nicotine also significantly enhanced tumor growth. This acceleration of tumor growth corresponded well with increased vascularization and its proangiogenic factors. Inhibitors of EGFR, c-Src, and 5-LOX all significantly impeded the tumor growth induced by nicotine. Together, nicotine can promote colonic tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Activation of the phosphorylated form of EGFR and c-Src followed by an increased 5-LOX expression are the prime pathogenic mechanisms in the tumorigenic process in the colon.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2003-10-22", "authors": ["Yi NYe", "Edgar S LLiu", "Vivian YShin", "William K KWu", "Jiing CLuo", "Chi HCho"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.103.058321"}
{"title": "Functional endothelial cells derived from rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "We have used rhesus monkey embryonic stem (ES) cells to study endothelial cell development. Rhesus ES cells (R366.4 cell line) exposed to medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) assumed a relatively uniform endothelial cell morphology and could be propagated and expanded with a consistent phenotype and normal karyotype. When placed in Matrigel, these rhesus ES cell-derived endothelial cells (RESDECs) formed capillary-like structures characteristic of endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analysis of RESDECs showed that they take up acetylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), express CD146, von Willebrand factor, and the integrin alpha v beta 3, and bind the lectin ulex europaeus agglutinin-1. These cells also express the VEGF receptor Flk-1 and secrete VEGF. When introduced in a Matrigel plug implanted subcutaneously in mice, RESDECs formed intact vessels and recruited new endothelial cell growth. In vivo function was demonstrated by coinjection of RESDECs with murine tumor cells subcutaneously into immunocompromised adult mice. RESDECs injected alone did not form measurable tumors. Tumor cells grew more rapidly and had increased vascularization when coinjected with the RESDECs. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the RESDECs participated in forming the tumor neovasculature. RESDECs provide a novel means to examine the mechanisms of endothelial cell development, and may open up new therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2003-10-18", "authors": ["Dan SKaufman", "Rachel LLewis", "Eric THanson", "RobertAuerbach", "JohannaPlendl", "James AThomson"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2003-03-0799"}
{"title": "Absence of OX-43 antigen expression in invasive capillary sprouts: identification of a capillary sprout-specific endothelial phenotype.", "abstract": "Endothelial cells exhibit a number of unique phenotypes, some of which are angiogenesis dependent. To identify a capillary sprout-specific endothelial phenotype, we labeled angiogenic rat mesentery tissue using a microvessel and capillary sprout marker (laminin), selected endothelial cell markers (CD31, tie-2, and BS-I lectin), and the OX-43 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a 90-kDa membrane glycoprotein of unknown function. In tissues that were stimulated through wound healing and compound 48/80 application, double-immunolabeling experiments with an anti-laminin antibody revealed that the OX-43 antigen was expressed strongly in all microvessels. However, the OX-43 antigen was completely absent from a large percentage (>85%) of the capillary sprouts that were invading the avascular tissue space. In contrast, sprouts that were introverting back into the previously vascularized tissue retained high levels of OX-43 antigen expression. Double-labeling experiments with endothelial markers indicated that the OX-43 antigen was expressed by microvessel endothelium but was absent from virtually all invasive capillary sprout endothelial cells. We conclude that the absence of OX-43 antigen expression marks a novel, capillary sprout-specific, endothelial cell phenotype. Endothelial cells of this phenotype are particularly abundant in capillary sprouts that invade avascular tissue during angiogenesis.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "The retrograde neurocutaneous island flap of the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve: anatomical basis and clinical application.", "abstract": "It is well known that a cutaneous artery is constantly located near a cutaneous peripheral nerve, forming a vascular plexus around it. This vascular axis can be either a true artery or an interlacing network, ensuring the vascularization of the nerve and giving off several neurocutaneous perforators to the skin. The anatomy of the accompanying arteries of the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve (DBUN) and their relationships with the dorsal branch of the ulnar artery (DBUA) were investigated in 22 fresh upper limbs injected with colored neoprene latex. A constant perineural vascularization of the terminal branch of the DBUN was observed in the fourth web space, connected distally with the corresponding dorsal metacarpal or palmar digital arteries. Our findings therefore provide anatomical bases for a new neurocutaneous island flap. Moreover, they allow us to describe a precise surgical technique in order to raise this flap over the larger branch of the DBUN, in the fourth intermetacarpal space. The flap is harvested on the medial aspect of the dorsum of the hand, and its point of rotation is located in the fourth web space, 1 cm proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint. It is supplied by a reversed flow originating from distal anastomoses of the perineural vessel with the dorsal metacarpal and digital palmar arteries in the fourth web space. This flap does not involve in its pedicle the distal course of the DBUA. It represents a pure neurocutaneous flap.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2003-09-25", "authors": ["VCasoli", "PV\u00e9rolino", "PP\u00e9lissier", "EKostopoulos", "PCaix", "VDelmas", "DMartin", "JBaudet"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-003-0174-2"}
{"title": "Cloned cattle fetuses with the same nuclear genetics are more variable than contemporary half-siblings resulting from artificial insemination and exhibit fetal and placental growth deregulation even in the first trimester.", "abstract": "The cloning of cattle by somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT) is associated with a high incidence of abnormal placentation, excessive fluid accumulation in the fetal sacs (hydrops syndrome), and fetal overgrowth. Fetal and placental development was investigated at Day 50, during placentome formation; at Day 100, when placentation was completed; and at Day 150, when the hydrops syndrome frequently develops. The NT fetuses were compared with contemporary half-siblings generated from in vitro-produced embryos or by artificial insemination (AI). Fetal cotyledon formation and vascularization of the chorioallantoic membranes was initiated normally in NT conceptuses, but fewer cotyledons successfully formed placentomes. By Day 100, the mean number of placentomes was significantly lower in surviving NT fetuses. Only those with normal placentome numbers were represented in surviving NT pregnancies at Day 150. The mean total caruncle tissue weight of the placentomes was significantly higher in the surviving NT groups at Days 100 and 150, irrespective of the placentome numbers, indicating that increased NT placental weight was caused by excessive uterine tissue growth. By Day 100, NT fetuses exhibited growth deregulation, and those that survived to Day 150 were 17% heavier than contemporary AI controls. Placentome, liver, and kidney overgrowth accompanied the hydrops syndrome at Day 150. The NT fetal overgrowth was not a consequence of in vitro embryo culture and showed no correlation with placental overgrowth. However, in vitro culture and incomplete reprogramming of the donor genome are epigenetic effects that may override genetic traits and contribute to the greater variability in placental and fetal development in the NT group compared with AI half-siblings.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2003-09-19", "authors": ["Rita S FLee", "A JamesPeterson", "Martyn JDonnison", "SusanRavelich", "Anita MLedgard", "NingLi", "Jan EOliver", "Andria LMiller", "Fleur CTucker", "BernhardBreier", "David NWells"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.103.020982"}
{"title": "Cathelicidins, multifunctional peptides of the innate immunity.", "abstract": "Cathelicidins comprise a family of mammalian proteins containing a C-terminal cationic antimicrobial domain that becomes active after being freed from the N-terminal cathelin portion of the holoprotein. Many other members of this family have been identified since the first cathelicidin sequences were reported 10 years ago. The mature peptides generally show a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity and, more recently, some of them have also been found to exert other biological activities. The human cathelicidin peptide LL-37 is chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes, mast cells, and T cells; induces degranulation of mast cells; alters transcriptional responses in macrophages; stimulates wound vascularization and re-epithelialization of healing skin. The porcine PR-39 has also been involved in a variety of processes, including promotion of wound repair, induction of angiogenesis, neutrophils chemotaxis, and inhibition of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity, whereas the bovine BMAP-28 induces apoptosis in transformed cell lines and activated lymphocytes and may thus help with clearance of unwanted cells at inflammation sites. These multiple actions provide evidence for active participation of cathelicidin peptides in the regulation of the antimicrobial host defenses.", "journal": "Journal of leukocyte biology", "date": "2003-09-10", "authors": ["MargheritaZanetti"], "doi": "10.1189/jlb.0403147"}
{"title": "Low oxygen consumption in the inner retina of the visual streak of the rabbit.", "abstract": "The oxygen requirements of different retinal layers are of interest in understanding the vulnerability of the retina to hypoxic damage in retinal diseases with an ischemic component. Here, we report the first measurements of retinal oxygen consumption in the visual streak of the rabbit retina, the region with the highest density of retinal neurons, and compare it with that in the less-specialized region of the retina underlying the vascularized portion of the rabbit retina. Oxygen-sensitive microelectrodes were used to measure oxygen tension as a function of retinal depth in anesthetized animals. Measurements were performed in the region of the retina containing overlying retinal vessels and in the center of the visual streak. Established mathematical analyses of the intraretinal oxygen distribution were used to quantify the rate of oxygen consumption in the inner and outer retina and the relative oxygen contributions from the choroidal and vitreal sides. Outer retinal oxygen consumption was higher in the visual streak than in the vascularized area (means +/- SE, 284 +/- 20 vs. 210 +/- 23 nl O2.min(-1) x cm(-2), P = 0.026, n = 10). However, inner retinal oxygen consumption in the visual streak was significantly lower than in the vascular area (57 +/- 4.3 vs. 146 +/- 12 nl O2 x min(-1) x cm(-2), P < 0.001). We conclude that despite the higher processing requirements of the inner retina in the visual streak, it has a significantly lower oxygen consumption rate than the inner retina underlying the retinal vasculature. This suggests that the oxygen uptake of the inner retina is regulated to a large degree by the available oxygen supply rather than the processing requirements of the inner retina alone.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Sonographic evaluation of brachial plexus pathology.", "abstract": "Pre-operative US examinations of the brachial plexus were performed with the purpose of exploring the potential of this technique in recognizing lesions in the region and defining their sonographic morphology, site, extent, and relations to adjacent anatomic structures, and comparing them to the surgical findings to obtain maximal confirmation. Twenty-eight patients with clinical, electro-conductive, and imaging findings suggestive of brachial plexus pathology were included in this study. There were four main etiology groups: post-traumatic brachial plexopathies; primary tumors (benign and malignant); secondary tumors; and post irradiation injuries. Twenty-one of the 28 patients underwent surgery. Advanced imaging (mostly MRI) served as an alternative gold standard for confirmation of the findings in the non-surgically treated group of patients. The US examinations were performed with conventional US units operating at 5- to 10-MHz frequencies. The nerves were initially localized at the level of the vertebral foramina and then were followed longitudinally and axially down to the axillary region. Abnormal US findings were detected in 20 of 28 patients. Disruption of nerve continuity and focal scar tissue masses were the principal findings in the post-traumatic cases. Focal masses within a nerve or adjacent to it and diffuse thickening of the nerve were the findings in primary and secondary tumors. Post-irradiation changes presented as nerve thickening. Color Doppler was useful in detecting internal vascularization within masses and relation of a mass to adjacent vessels. The eight sonographically negative cases consisted either of traumatic neuromas smaller than 12 mm in size and located in relatively small branches of posterior location or due to fibrotic changes of diffuse nature. Sonography succeeded in depicting a spectrum of lesions of traumatic, neoplastic, and inflammatory nature in the brachial plexus. It provided useful information regarding the lesion site, extent, and anatomic relationships; thus, the principal aims of the study were therefore met. Once the technique of examination is mastered, sonography should be recommended as part of the pre-operative evaluation process post-ganglionic brachial plexus pathology. Most disadvantages are related to the restricted field of view and inability to overcome bonny obstacles particularly in evaluating pre-ganglionic region. As sonography is frequently employed for investigation of the supraclavicular region, awareness of the radiologist to the findings described may enable the early recognition of pathologies involving or threatening to involve the brachial plexus.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2003-07-08", "authors": ["MosheGraif", "CarloMartinoli", "ShimonRochkind", "AnatBlank", "LeonorTrejo", "JudithWeiss", "AdaKessler", "Lorenzo EDerchi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00330-003-1997-2"}
