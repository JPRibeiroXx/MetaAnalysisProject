There is a large body of evidence indicating that DC play certain regulatory role in the process of induction of tolerance. Immaturity of DCs, bone marrow lineage, method of dissemination by infusion in suspension or from the vascularized bone marrow graft, location after transplantation and environment inhibiting their maturation seem to be the prerequisites for displaying their tolerogenic activity.

However, porcine molecules of the B7 family (e.g. CD86) are expressed on typical antigen presenting cells (APC) and also on vascular endothelial cells. Thus, in vascularized porcine xenografts the usage of therapeutic anti-B7 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) might be associated with damage of the endothelium.\nIn the present study we asked whether modulation of human T cell reactivity can be obtained by targeting molecules selectively expressed on pig leucocytes.\nMAb directed to pig CD45 were tested for their capacity to modulate the in vitro activation of human T cells induced by porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\nPorcine stimulatory cells induced significant proliferation of human T cells. In the presence of porcine CD45 mAb human T cell responses were reduced by 30-40%. The inhibitory effects were most pronounced when CD45RA mAb were used whereas mAb directed to CD45RC isoforms only moderately inhibited human T cell activation. The tested antibodies had no effects on human T cell activation induced by mitogens or by alloantigen.\nManipulation of CD45 molecules on pig leucocytes may reduce their potential to stimulate human T cells. In recipients of vascularized porcine xenografts the usage of anti-pig CD45 mAb could be an approach to block the direct pathway of T cell activation initiated by porcine APC without affecting the endothelium of the graft.", "journal": "Annals of transplantation", "date": "2004-04-30", "authors": ["TanjaBedke", "WiebkeBaars", "ReinhardSchwinzer"], "doi": null}

Tissue-scattering spectra provide insight into epithelial, collagen, and lipid contributions to breast density. Clinical studies of women with malignant tumors show that DOS is sensitive to processes such as increased tissue vascularization, hypoxia, and edema. In studies of healthy women, DOS detects variations in breast physiology associated with menopausal status, menstrual cycle changes, and hormone replacement. Current research involves using DOS to monitor tumor response to therapy and the co-registration of DOS with magnetic resonance imaging.

The only treatment option that is curative is liver transplantation. However, because of shortage of cadaveric organ donors and/or delay in their availability, only 10% of FHF patients ultimately receive a transplant. This has led to development of artificial liver support systems with an idea to bridge the time to transplantation and/or recovery from FHF. Initial support systems were based on the principles of hemodialysis, hemofiltration, plasma-exchange, and hemoperfusion through adsorbent media (e.g., charcoal). However, lack of clinical efficacy, problems of bioincompatibility and fear of loss of circulating hepatocyte-regeneration factors led to the search for alternate strategies. With the successful long-term propagation and culturing of human and pig hepatocytes, and the development of adequate biocompatible microcarrier modules, it is now possible to achieve sufficient density of hepatocytes per unit volume to develop bioartificial liver systems. These can be implanted transperitoneally but are subject to early destruction because of inadequate vascularization and immune attack from the host. Thus the major thrust is now to develop bioreactors, e.g., Extracorporeal Liver Assist Device (ELAD), Bioartificial Liver (BAL), etc. These contain human or pig hepatocytes implanted on hollow-fiber ultrafiltration cartridges. The patient's blood or plasma circulates through these bioreactors and after clearance of toxic compounds (via ultrafiltration and metabolism in hepatocytes) and addition of synthesized products, is returned to the patient.

{"title": "Pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity.", "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major cause of blindness in children in developed countries. ROP, a two-phase disease, is initiated with delayed retinal vascular growth after premature birth (phase I). Insufficient vascularization of the developing retina creates hypoxia, which precipitates the release of factors stimulating new and abnormal blood vessel growth (phase II). ROP develops because of abnormalities in both oxygen-regulated and non-oxygen-regulated factors, which affect both phases of the disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important oxygen-regulated factor that, if suppressed, inhibits normal vessel growth, but in excess, precipitates retinal neovascularization. A critical non-oxygen-regulated growth factor is insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Similar to VEGF, low levels of IGF-1 prevent normal vessel growth (phase I), and higher levels allow neovascularization (phase II). We found that premature infants who develop ROP have low levels of serum IGF-1 compared with age-matched infants without disease. IGF-1 is critical to normal vascular development.

The complications of genital mutilations are frequent for a number of reasons: the fact that the clitoris is highly vascularized, the nature of the mutilations, excision or infibulation, and the poor conditions of hygiene. The short term complications are pain, hemorrhage, shock, and urinary retention. Medium term complications include gangrene, septicemia, tetanus, pelvic inflammatory disease, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis B or C infections. Serious sequelae may occur, including infertility and gynecologic disorders, and sexual life is invariably altered. The main obstetrical complications of genital mutilations are genital lacerations involving the labia minor and the perineum, which can lead to hemorrhage and sequelae such as urinary or anal incontinence, recto-vaginal and vesico-vaginal fistulas. The role of doctors, which is delicate because these customs are entrenched, is to detect genital mutilations, repair them and prevent them, by participating in health education programs. The consequences of forcible childhood marriage are serious, besides the fact that this is a disguised form of rape. The obstetrical risks favored by the underdevelopment of the uterus and the pelvis, include uterine rupture, preeclampsia and eclampsia, and obstetrical hemorrhage. The fetus/neonate are jeopardized by these complications, which can result in perinatal asphyxia and death, as well as the high rates of intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. The impact of genital mutilations on delivery are compounded in childhood pregnancies for anatomical reasons, but also because these adolescents or children are extremely vulnerable and have poor access to perinatal care.

The aim of the present study was to determine the relationships between the vascular network and mRNA expressions of angiopoietins (Ang)-1, Ang-2 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and their receptors in follicles at different developmental stages during follicular development. Ovaries in gilts were collected 72 h after equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, 1250 IU) treatment for histological observation of the capillary network. Granulosa cells and thecal tissues in small (<4 mm), medium (4-5 mm) or large (>5 mm) individual follicles were collected for detection of mRNA expression of HGF, Ang-1 and Ang-2 in granulosa cells, and HGF receptor (HGF-R) and Tie-2 in the theca cells by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The number of capillaries in the thecal cell layer increased significantly in healthy follicles at all developmental stages in the eCG group compared with those in controls. The expression of Ang-1 mRNA declined in granulosa cells of medium and large follicles and the level of Ang-2 mRNA increased in granulosa cells of small follicles after eCG treatment. The ratio of Ang-2/Ang-1 increased in small, medium and large follicles from ovaries after eCG treatment, but Tie-2 mRNA expression in the theca cells did not change. The level of HGF mRNA increased in granulosa cells of small follicles after eCG treatment but HGF-R in theca cells was not increased by eCG. These data suggested that the angiopoietins might be associated with thecal angiogenesis during follicular development in eCG-treated gilts.", "journal": "The Journal of reproduction and development", "date": "2004-02-18", "authors": ["TakashiShimizu", "KojiIijima", "HiroshiSasada", "EimeiSato"], "doi": "10.1262/jrd.49.203"}
{"title": "Bypass of tumor drug resistance by antivascular therapy.", "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) presents a major obstacle for the successful chemotherapy of cancer. Its emergence during chemotherapy is attributed to a selective process, which gives a growth advantage to MDR cells within the genetically unstable neoplastic cell population. The pleiotropic nature of clinical MDR poses a great difficulty for the development of treatment strategies that aim at blocking MDR at the tumor cell level. Targeting treatment to the nonmalignant vascular network-the lifeline of the tumor-is a promising alternative for the treatment of drug-resistant tumors. The present study demonstrates that MDR in cancer can be successfully circumvented by photodynamic therapy (PDT) using an antivascular treatment protocol. We show that, although P-glycoprotein-expressing human HT29/MDR colon carcinoma cells in culture are resistant to PDT with Pd-bacteriopheophorbide (TOOKAD), the same treatment induces tumor necrosis with equal efficacy (88% vs 82%) in HT29/MDR-derived xenografts and their wild type counterparts, respectively. These results are ascribed to the rapid antivascular effects of the treatment, supporting the hypothesis that MDR tumors can be successfully eradicated by indirect approaches that bypass their inherent drug resistance. We suggest that with progress in ongoing clinical trials, TOOKAD-PDT may offer a novel option for local treatment of MDR tumors.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2004-02-18", "authors": ["DinaPreise", "OhadMazor", "NataliaKoudinova", "MordechaiLiscovitch", "AvigdorScherz", "YoramSalomon"], "doi": "10.1016/s1476-5586(03)80031-3"}

Concentration-time curves of ampicillin in plasma and TCF were determined in six horses following administration of 15 mg/kg ampicillin sodium, before and after the induction of local inflammation with 0.5% carrageenan. The calculated parameters were used to simulate various dosage-dosing interval combinations. Ampicillin was absorbed very rapidly following i.m. administration. Plasma concentrations were maximual between 18 and 21 min after administration. None of the plasma PK parameters were affected significantly by local (TC) inflammation. Penetration of ampicillin into and elimination from the TCF were affected significantly by inflammation and the half-life of elimination from the tissue fluid t1/2(d) was significantly shorter in inflammation. In the simulated dosage-dosing interval scenarios, only a dosage of 15 mg ampicillin/kg four times daily would successfully treat all ampicillin-susceptible bacterial isolates in well vascularized tissues. However a dosage as low as 10 mg/kg twice daily, would, in theory, treat all ampicillin-susceptible isolates in the inflamed poorly vascularized tissues.

{"title": "Dopaminergic neurons associate with blood vessels in neural transplants.", "abstract": "Neural transplantation is an attractive strategy for diseases that result in focal neurodegeneration such as Parkinson's disease, where there is a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. A major drawback to its application, however, is the poor survival of donor dopaminergic neurons. While neurons probably depend on host-derived substances delivered by either diffusion or the establishment of functional vascular connections, the relative importance of each delivery mechanism is not known. We investigated the topography of transplants of embryonic mesencephalic tissue and describe the spatial relationships between transplanted dopaminergic neurons, the host brain, and in-growing blood vessels. Results indicate that transplant vascularization shares features with developmental patterns of brain vascularization. Moreover, the topographical distribution of dopaminergic neurons reflected their proximity to the host brain as well as their distance from vascular elements. Zonal analysis revealed that the majority of dopaminergic neurons were found at or near the host-transplant interface at 1 week after transplantation. Nearest neighbor analysis demonstrated a descending exponential gradient of dopaminergic neurons as a function of their distance from vessels at the same time point. These patterns became more marked with time. Results suggest that rates and patterns of vascularization may be important determinants in the long-term survival of dopaminergic neurons.", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "date": "2004-02-11", "authors": ["DianaCasper", "EricFinkelstein", "Ira MGoldstein", "DavidPalencia", "YaacovYunger", "AnnPidel"], "doi": "10.1016/S0014-4886(03)00336-4"}

We used: 1) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to evaluate vascularization and new bone formation in the allograft, 2) kinetic [18F]-fluoride PET to produce quantitative images, interpreted as new bone formation in the allograft surrounding the femur stem, 3) [15O]-water PET to quantify bone blood flow, and 4) [15O]-carbon monoxide to determine blood volume. After surgery, all patients were evaluated twice: at 1-8 days and 12 months and 3 patients were also studied at 4 months. As early as at 8 days after surgery, blood flow and bone formation had increased greatly adjacent to the allograft. At 4 months blood flow and bone formation were about the same, but activity was highest in the graft material. At 1 year after surgery, blood flow had declined to the levels of the contralateral femur diaphysis in most of the graft bed.

Both the induction and inhibition of this process can have therapeutic benefits in various pathological conditions. Integrins are a structurally elaborate family of adhesion molecules; they participate in a wide range of biological processes, including angiogenesis. Endothelial cells are intimately involved in angiogenesis and are thought to mediate this function partially through the integrins on their cell membrane, which regulate cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. Extensive research into elucidating the mechanisms involved in the angiogenesis process have led to the discovery of a growing number of genes encoding pro- and anti-angiogenic proteins. A variety of gene therapy approaches have been used to deliver many of these genes to induce or inhibit the angiogenesis process with varying levels of success.

For their treatment, these patients depend on systemic anticancer therapy and supportive care.\nThis article reviews recent developments in systemic treatment of disseminated colorectal cancer.\nUntil recently, the fluoropyrimidines were the only cytotoxic drugs available, but during recent years three other classes of active conventional cytotoxic drugs and a new class of target-directed drugs have become available. New cytotoxic drug therapies include raltitrexed, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Patients receiving irinotecan experience a better quality of life than those treated with best supportive care alone. Irinotecan or oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU) and leucovorin are currently the most active treatment regimens. Oral prodrugs of 5-FU, such as capecitabine and uracil, have been developed in order to mimic the protracted infusion schedule of 5-FU, and these drugs may change the daily practice of palliative chemotherapy for colorectal cancer in the coming years. Therapeutic agents that target specific molecular processes that promote proliferation, vascularization and metastasis, and inhibit apoptosis, are being designed and may offer a rational approach to anticancer therapy. Examples of this novel approach are monoclonal antibodies and small molecules adhering to the epithelial growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor in order to inhibit growth stimulation and angiogenesis.\nThe current debate is no longer whether to use palliative chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal, but which patient will benefit from which combination and in what sequence.", "journal": "Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology.

We investigated this potential using the ECV304 cell line, which, although identified as a bladder carcinoma cell line, displays some endothelial characteristics, including tubule formation (differentiation) following appropriate stimulation. Differentiated ECV304 cells retained Gb3 expression/VT1 sensitivity. VT1 internalization and retrograde transport through the Golgi to the ER was observed. ECV304 xenografts in immunocompromised mice were invasive but surprisingly poorly vascularized. Intratumoural VT1 injection significantly reduced ECV304 xenograft growth and enhanced mouse survival. Gb3 expression was decreased in residual tumour, likely due to cell cycle arrest. Untreated ECV304 xenograft sections bound VT1 throughout the tumour. Anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) antibody staining for neovasculature showed only morphologically atypical, indistinct structures, unlabelled by VT1. Human bladder carcinoma samples were, in contrast, highly vascular and blood vessels were 100% co-labelled by anti-vWF antibody and VT1, with no extravascular staining. These results suggest that ECV304 xenografts are not characteristic of bladder carcinoma in terms of Gb3 expression, and that VT1 staining may provide a new reliable index of tumour neovasculature. We conclude that ECV304 cells are not an appropriate in vivo model of either tumour angiogenesis or bladder carcinoma.

Despite the excellent results demonstrated in the first 3 years of follow-up, infection, resorption, delay in consolidation and fracture led to 18% failures of the implant. Massive homoplastic graft is still a good means of reconstruction that allows for excellent functional results, but despite this intense research activity is required to improve its mechanical hold in time together with better and complete integration.", "journal": "La Chirurgia degli organi di movimento", "date": "2004-01-23", "authors": ["DDonati", "SGiacomini", "EGozzi", "CDi Bella", "MMercuri"], "doi": null}

She died at 13 days of age following a seizure. The genetic analysis concluded in a sporadic case of incontinentia pigmenti.\nThirty-eight cases of incontinentia pigmenti, associated with severe brain damage have been reported in the literature. The neurological manifestations appear rapidly after birth in the form of epilepsy. The seizures can lead to severe psychomotor retardation and, in most cases, precede the installation of motor deficiency. The lesions observed on imaging are hypodensity of varying localization and which do not correspond to any vascularization pattern. Autopsy reveals areas of brain tissue destruction. Recent genetic data suggest two physiopathological hypotheses, which both rely on NF-Kb dysfunction. The cutaneous cells expressing muted chromosome x exhibit a reduced rate of free NF-kB and are more sensitive to the apoptotic signals. Like the cutaneous cells, the brain tissue cells expressing muted chromosome x may be eliminated when becoming apoptotic. Furthermore, NF-kB is one of the links of the transduction system of the messages received by the VEGF receptor, the endothelial growth factor.

Using a total of 50 New Zealand White rabbits, two groups were randomized as experimental and control animals. In the experimental group (n = 30), a bipedicled dorsal scapular skin flap was anchored with sutures to the scapular bone, by bringing it into contact with the exposed dorsal surface of the bone after stripping the dorsal muscular attachments. Following 4 weeks of neovascularization, the prefabricated composite flaps were harvested, based on the caudally-based dorsal skin flap, after stripping the ventral muscular attachments of the bone. In the control group (n = 20), non-vascularized scapular bone grafts were implanted under bipedicled dorsal scapular skin flaps with sutures. After 4 weeks, prefabricated composite flaps were harvested, based on the caudally-based dorsal skin flap. In both groups, on day 7 after the second stage, the viability of the bony component of the flaps was evaluated by direct observation, scintigraphy, measurement of bone metabolic activity, microangiography, dye injection study, and histology. Results indicated that the bone segments in the experimental group demonstrated a greater survival than in the control group. The authors conclude that this technique of osteocutaneous flap prefabrication preserves the viability of the bony component with a soft-tissue vascular carrier, in contrast to the conventional method of pre-transfer grafting. The technique may be useful clinically in selected cases.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2004-01-15", "authors": ["MustafaAky\u00fcrek", "OmerOzkan", "M FaniBozkurt", "Tun\u00e7Safak"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2004-815645"}

The flap consists of thin and well-vascularized pliable tissue, with gliding properties excellent for covering exposed tendons. It is based on the branches of the thoracodorsal artery, which are raised in the flap, leaving the long thoracic nerve intact on the serratus muscle.

Most sarcomas affect patients who are older than 55 years; however, many young patients who are otherwise healthy, may present with malignant foot and ankle lesions. In addition to benign and malignant neoplasms, pseudotumorous conditions mimic neoplastic lesions and should be differentiated before any treatment is undertaken. Invasiveness is a characteristic of sarcomas. The foot is a terminal anatomic structure, with closed and tight compartments and well-vascularized tissues, that predispose it to hematogenous and lymphatic metastases. Patients who have a malignant foot tumor should be referred to an orthopedic oncologist for further evaluation and treatment. The goals of treatment include local tumor control, restoration of function and stability during standing and walking, long-term survival, and improved quality of life. In most cases, wide surgical margins require a ray, Syme, midtarsal, or below-the-knee amputation. Recent advances in chemotherapy and radiotherapy have allowed limb salvage procedures with wide tumor resections. Because overall survival is greatly improved in these patients, the reconstruction of skeletal defects needs to be more functional and durable.

However, ideal dental implant treatment cannot be achieved easily in patients who have undergone mandibular reconstruction with a free vascularized flap, usually because of the limited length, height, and width of the bone graft. Shorter implants (< 10 mm in length) therefore are occasionally used in vascularized fibula graft sites. In such cases, however, shorter implants tend to be overloaded, thereby endangering its longevity. In this article, we discuss how a magnetic abutment system was introduced for such a patient.

{"title": "Hypoxic induction of myocardial vascularization during development.", "abstract": "The development of the heart is closely linked to its temporally and spatially regulated vascularization. Hypoxia has been shown to stimulate myocardial capillary growth and improve myocardial perfusion during reperfusion in postnatal animals exposed to chronic or intermittent exposure to hypobaria. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is up-regulated by hypoxia via HIF-1alpha, and these two molecules are colocalized with presumptive regions of hypoxia. VEGF up-regulation in embryonic and fetal hearts correlates with vascular tube formation which progresses from an epicardial to endocardial direction prior to the establishment of a functional coronary circulation. Our studies on explanted embryonic quail hearts indicate that vascular tube formation is enhanced by hypoxia (5-10% O2) and inhibited by hyperoxia. Three splice variants of VEGF (122, 126, 190) were found to increase and decrease with hypoxia and hyperoxia, respectively. While VEGF synthesis is stimulated by hypoxia, there are differences in the vascular patterning between exogenous VEGF-induced vascularization and that induced by hypoxia. Thus, other, yet to be identified, molecules are recruited by hypoxia. Acute hypoxia selectively enhances at least three splice variants of VEGF-A, and also selectively up-regulates VEGFR-1 (flt-1). However, we suggest that VEGF-B, a ligand for VEGFR-1 may contribute to embryonic myocardial vascularization, since we have shown that it plays a key role in this process under normoxic conditions. A second mechanism by which hypoxia may play a role in vascularization of the heart is via its vasodilatory effects, once the coronary circulation is functional. Increased blood flow serves as a mechanical (stretch) trigger for activation of VEGF and its receptors. In sum, there is evidence that a relative hypoxia provides both metabolic and mechanical stimuli for vascular growth in the developing heart.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2004-01-10", "authors": ["Robert JTomanek", "Donald DLund", "XinpingYue"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4419-8997-0_10"}
{"title": "Hypoxia and Rho/Rho-kinase signaling. Lung development versus hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.", "abstract": "Intracellular signaling via the small GTP-binding protein RhoA and its downstream effector Rho-kinase plays a role in regulating diverse cellular functions, including cell contraction, migration, gene expression, proliferation, and differentiation. Rho/Rho-kinase signaling has an obligatory role in embryonic cardiac development, and low-level chemical activation of Rho promotes branching morphogenesis in fetal lung explants. Gebb has found that hypoxia markedly augments branching morphogenesis in fetal rat lung explants, and our preliminary results suggest this is associated with activation of RhoA. Whereas hypoxia-induced activation of Rho/Rho-kinase may promote fetal lung development, other evidence indicates it has adverse effects in the lungs of neonates and adults. When exposed at birth to the mild hypoxia of Denver's altitude (5,280 ft), the neonatal fawn-hooded rat (FHR) develops severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with impaired lung alveolarization and vascularization. We have observed that administration via the drinking water of the Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil to the nursing, Denver FHR mother for the first 2 to 3 weeks, and then directly to the Denver FHR pups for the next 7 to 8 weeks, ameliorates the lung dysplasia and PH. The adult Sprague-Dawley rat develops PH when exposed for 3 to 4 wk to a simulated altitude of 17,000 ft. We have found that this hypoxic PH is associated with activation of pulmonary artery Rho/Rho-kinase and is almost completely reversed by acute intravenous administration of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632. In addition, chronic in vivo treatment with Y-27632 reduces development of the hypoxic PH. In summary, hypoxic activation of Rho/Rho-kinase signaling may be important for fetal lung morphogenesis, but continued activation of this pathway in the neonate impairs postnatal lung development and re-activation in the adult contributes to development of PH.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2004-01-10", "authors": ["Ivan FMcMurtry", "Natalie RBauer", "Karen AFagan", "TetsutaroNagaoka", "Sarah AGebb", "MasahikoOka"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Epidermal growth factor enhances invasive activity of BeWo choriocarcinoma cells by inducing alpha2 integrin expression.", "abstract": "The trophoblast, an important component of the mammalian placenta, has several essential biological roles in the maintenance of pregnancy. First, trophoblast cells must attach to the uterine endometrium, and then they must invade to a depth at which the vascular network exists. Here, we investigated the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on alpha2 integrin expression, adhesiveness to collagen, and invasive activity using human BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. EGF induced the expression of alpha2 integrin mRNA and protein, as shown by Northern blotting, Western blotting, and flow cytometry. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion was enhanced by the addition of EGF, which suggests that the BeWo cells functionally differentiated similarly to normal trophoblasts. EGF also dose-dependently stimulated the invasiveness of BeWo cells. Antibody against alpha2 integrin inhibited this effect, suggesting that it may be mediated by an increase of cell surface integrin. EGF had no effect on the adhesiveness of BeWo cells to collagen, whereas it stimulated the chemokinetic activity in a dose-dependent manner. The increase of chemokinetic activity was suppressed by antibody against alpha2 integrin. These results suggest that EGF may induce alpha2 integrin expression in trophoblast cells, thereby enhancing their invasiveness into the endometrium via an increase of their chemokinetic activity.", "journal": "Endocrine journal", "date": "2004-01-08", "authors": ["YukiNakatsuji", "YukihiroNishio", "NaoyukiTani", "KazushigeAdachi", "MasahideOhmichi", "KojiHisamoto", "Ken-IchirouMorishige", "HirohisaKurachi", "KeiichiTasaka", "YujiMurata", "NariakiMatsuura"], "doi": "10.1507/endocrj.50.703"}
{"title": "Luteinizing hormone acts directly at granulosa cells to stimulate periovulatory processes: modulation of luteinizing hormone effects by prostaglandins.", "abstract": "The midcycle surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers events within the primate periovulatory follicle that culminate in follicle rupture and luteinization of the follicle wall; these events include the shift from primarily estrogen to primarily progesterone production, vascularization of the granulosa cell layer, and expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors (MMPs and TIMPs) thought to be necessary for follicle rupture. However, it is unknown if LH acts directly at granulosa cells to regulate these important periovulatory processes. The ovulatory LH surge also stimulates the production of prostaglandins (PGs) by the follicle just before follicle rupture, suggesting that LH may have both PG-dependent and PG-independent actions. To address these questions, gonadotropins were administered to adult female rhesus monkeys to stimulate the development of multiple, large preovulatory follicles. Granulosa cells were aspirated and maintained in vitro for up to 48 h in serum-free, chemically defined medium. Granulosa cells were cultured with LH alone or in combination with PGs to determine if these hormones act directly at granulosa cells to induce the production of factors implicated in periovulatory processes. LH treatment increased media progesterone (p < 0.05) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; p < 0.05) levels as well as stimulating expression of mRNAs for MMP-1 (p = 0.05), MMP-9 (p < 0.05), and TIMP-1 (p < 0.05), similar to the effects of an ovulatory dose of gonadotropin in vivo. PGE2 alone elevated media progesterone levels but decreased LH stimulation of MMP- 1 mRNA (p < 0.05). PGF2alpha reduced LH-stimulated TIMP-1 mRNA (p < 0.05) levels. These studies suggest a direct action of LH on granulosa cells to stimulate the processes involved in tissue remodeling and neovascularization, i.e., MMPs/TIMPs and angiogenic factors, as well as steroidogenesis. LH-stimulated PGs may have a regulatory role to modulate some effects of the LH surge, such as MMP/TIMP expression.", "journal": "Endocrine", "date": "2004-01-08", "authors": ["Diane MDuffy", "Richard LStouffer"], "doi": "10.1385/ENDO:22:3:249"}

Because data on the precursors of this cell lineage remain scarce and often contradictory, basal epithelial cells of second trimester fetal breasts were studied by light microscopy (LM) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Up to 20 wk of gestational age, the mammary rudiments only comprised roundish primary outgrowths, \"primary buds,\" more likely to represent immature nipples than true mammary tissue. At 21 wk secondary outgrowths, \"projections,\" extended from enlarged primary buds into well-vascularized layers of dense mesenchyme. Basal projection cells had a partial myoepithelial-like phenotype: they reacted with CD29, CD49f, CD104, keratin 14, vimentin, S100beta protein, and p63; furthermore, many became positive for keratin 17, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and CD10 (but not for keratin 19) between wk 21 and 25. The continuous basement membrane associated with the fetal mammary rudiments was strongly positive for collagens type IV and VII, and for laminin 5. Consistently strong and basally polarized staining for hemidesmosomal components suggested that although incompletely differentiated, most second trimester myoepithelial precursors might already mediate local epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, i.e., complex signaling pathways which are crucial for both orderly growth during development and maintenance of homeostasis during adult life.

The purpose of our study was to analyze the angiogenic pattern in squamous and basal cell carcinomas and to point out differences in microvessel density that could explain their different biological behaviour. Thirty-nine skin tumors (26 basal and 13 squamous cell carcinomas) were analyzed. In all samples, the microvessels density (MVD) and the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA (VEGFmRNA) were analyzed, together with the inter-relationship between these two variables. Using the median value of the entire series (33 vessels per 2.22 mm2), tumors with low and high MVD were identified. The majority of cancers with high vascularization belonged to the squamous histotype (12 of 39), while 19 of the 26 basal cell carcinomas showed a lower number of microvessels than the median value (p = 0.0001). The median value of VEGFcDNA quantitation allowed us to distinguish tumors with high VEGF expression (> 470 molecules cDNA) from those with low (< or = 470 molecules) VEGF expression: 20 of the 26 basal cell carcinomas showed low VEGF expression, while 11 of the 13 squamous cell carcinomas showed high VEGFcDNA levels (p = 0.0003). Moreover, a significant association between a high microvessel density and high VEGFmRNA levels (p = 0.006) was found. Furthermore, when studying VEGF expression by immunohistochemistry, we obtained similar results and noted a correlation with VEGFmRNA expression (p < 0.0001).

Using FPP from human CD46 transgenic pigs, we now report that the complement regulator, CD46, affords protection from antibody-mediated rejection when mouse anti-pig serum (MAPS) was administered to scid mice bearing PFF grafts from either CD46 transgenic or normal pigs. Indeed, whereas normal pig islets were destroyed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 0.1 to 0.2 ml of MAPS antibody, destruction of CD46-expressing transgenic islets required 0.5 ml, i.e. up to five times the amount. In contrast, there was no prolongation of the survival of CD46 transgenic mouse skin or heart major histocompatibility complex-compatible or -incompatible allografts--rejected by predominantly cellular immune mechanisms, as opposed to xenograft rejection.

Differential diagnosis was done by ultrasonography, cholescintigraphy and liver biopsy. The parafifin-embedded tissue sections of liver biopsies underwent immunohistochemistry with Ki67 to mark proliferation activity, cytokeratin to mark the proliferating ductuli, vimentin to mark Kupffer cells, and CD34 to mark capillary vessels. Number of ductuli per high power field, number of Ki-67 positive cells per ductus, number of Kupffer cells per high power field and number of capillary vessels per high power field were calculated. Independent T test was used for statistical evaluation.\nIndependent sample T test indicated that there is a significant difference for proliferating ductuli and proliferation activity between neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia. Biliary atresia cases represent more proliferating ductuli and proliferation activity in ductal epithelial cells than neonatal hepatitis cases. There is no statistical significance for Kupffer cell proliferation and vascularization.\nOur results indicate that, quantitative analysis of proliferating ductuli and proliferation activity of ductal epithelial cells may be helpful in differential diagnosis of neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia. Besides neither Kupffer cell proliferation nor vascularization are found to be useful in differential diagnosis.", "journal": "Hepato-gastroenterology", "date": "2003-12-31", "authors": ["SafiyeAktas", "GuldenDiniz", "RagipOrtac"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Regulation of heparanase gene expression by estrogen in breast cancer.", "abstract": "Numerous epidemiological studies clearly suggest that estrogen is one of the main driving forces in breast tumorigenesis, but precise mechanisms of cancer promotion by estrogen remain poorly understood. Classically, tumorigenic effects of estrogen have been attributed to its ability to directly promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells. In addition to abnormal proliferation, interactions between tumor cells and surrounding stromal components (e.g., enzymatic remodeling and degradation of extracellular matrix) are critical for cancer progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We now report that in breast carcinomas, estrogen may promote these pathological tumor-stromal interactions through up-regulation of heparanase gene expression. Heparanase is an endoglycosidase degrading heparan sulfate, of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix. This cleavage affects tumor-stromal interaction, neovascularization, local invasion, and metastatic spread. However, little is known about transcriptional regulation of the heparanase gene. We identified four putative estrogen response elements in the heparanase promoter region and found that transcription of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the heparanase promoter was significantly increased in estrogen-receptor positive MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells after estrogen treatment. Estrogen-induced heparanase mRNA transcription in estrogen receptor-positive, but not in estrogen receptor-negative, breast cancer cells, confirmed the promoter study data. The estrogen effects on heparanase mRNA expression levels were abolished in the presence of the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780, indicating that the classic estrogen receptor pathway is involved in transcriptional activation of heparanase. In vivo, exposure to estrogen augmented levels of heparanase protein in MCF-7 cells embedded in Matrigel plugs and correlated with increased plug vascularization. Collectively, our data suggest a new molecular pathway through which estrogen, independent of its proliferative effect, may induce heparanase overexpression and, thus, promote tumor-stromal interactions, critical for breast carcinoma development and progression.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-12-26", "authors": ["MichaelElkin", "IritCohen", "EyalZcharia", "AdamOrgel", "ZehavaGuatta-Rangini", "TamarPeretz", "IsraelVlodavsky", "Hynda KKleinman"], "doi": null}
{"title": "High heparanase activity in multiple myeloma is associated with elevated microvessel density.", "abstract": "Heparanase is an enzyme that cleaves heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans, and its expression has been associated with increased growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis of some tumors. Because myeloma tumor cells express high levels of the syndecan-1 heparan sulfate proteoglycan and because these tumors grow as highly vascularized aggregates within the bone marrow, we analyzed the activity, expression, and function of heparanase in myeloma patients. Analysis of heparanase activity in the plasma isolated from bone marrow biopsies of 100 patients reveals 86 positive for heparanase activity and 14 negative. The bone marrow samples can be further divided into three categories of heparanase activity, high activity (42 patients), low activity (44 patients), and negative (14 patients). In contrast to the bone marrow plasma, levels of heparanase activity in peripheral blood plasma of 29 myeloma patients were either negative or low, suggesting that in multiple myeloma, heparanase functions in the local microenvironment of the bone marrow and its activity is not significantly elevated systemically. Immunohistochemistry reveals that patients with high levels of heparanase activity often have tumor cells with intense staining for the enzyme. Interestingly, a marked heterogeneity among tumor cells was noted, with clusters of heavily stained cells surrounded by cells with weak or negative staining for heparanase. Analysis of microvessel density reveals a strikingly higher concentration of vessels in patients with high heparanase activity (78.96 vessels/mm(2)) as compared with patients negative for heparanase activity (25.03 vessels/mm(2)). When human myeloma cells transfected with the cDNA for heparanase are implanted in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, the resulting tumors exhibited a significantly higher microvessel density than did tumors established with control cells. Thus, expression of heparanase appears to play a direct role in enhancing microvessel density in these myeloma tumors. Because heparanase is known to stimulate angiogenesis, and because high microvessel density is associated with poor prognosis in myeloma, we conclude that heparanase expression likely plays an important role in regulating the growth and progression of myeloma, and that therapies designed to block heparanase activity may aid in controlling this cancer.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-12-26", "authors": ["ThomasKelly", "Hua-QuanMiao", "YangYang", "ElizabethNavarro", "PaulKussie", "YanHuang", "VeronicaMacLeod", "JonathanCasciano", "LijaJoseph", "FenghuangZhan", "MaurizioZangari", "BartBarlogie", "JohnShaughnessy", "Ralph DSanderson"], "doi": null}

External beam radiation of 14.4 Gy was administered with a daily dose of 1.8 Gy. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed based on visual acuity, the size of the membrane and the persistence or not of neovascular activity.\nWe observed stabilization of visual acuity in 44% of the cases at 6 months but only in 20% at 19 and 30 months. The mean initial visual acuity was measured at 0.2 at presentation and 0.1 at the final evaluation. At the end of the study, 60% of patients attained the level of legal blindness; 90% of patients developed a disciform scar, with persistence of neovascular activity in 27% of the cases. On fluorescein angiography, the size of pigment epithelium detachment increased more than one optic disc diameter in 20% of the cases at 1 year. On the other hand, no radiation complication was observed.\nThe visual and anatomical results of our study are similar to the natural progression of occult neovascular membrane.

We examined the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the semiquantification of ovarian, endometrial and subendometrial blood flow using 3D-PDA, virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL) and shell-imaging.\n3D-PDA was used to acquire 20 ovarian and 20 endometrial volumes from 40 different patients at various stages of in vitro fertilization treatment. VOCAL was then used to delineate the 3D areas of interest and the 'histogram facility' employed to generate three indices of vascularity: the vascular index, the flow index and the vascularization flow index. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was assessed by two-way, mixed, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and general linear modeling was used to examine for differences in the mean values between each observer.\nThe intraobserver reliability for both observers was extremely high and there were no differences in reliability between the observers for measurements of both volume and vascularity within the ovary or endometrium and its shells. With the exception of the outside subendometrial shell volumes, there were no significant differences between the two observers in the mean values obtained for either endometrial or ovarian volume and vascularity measurements. The interobserver reliability of measurements was equally high throughout with all measurements obtaining a mean ICC of above 0.985.\n3D-PDA and shell-imaging offer a reliable, practical and non-invasive method for the assessment of ovarian, endometrial and subendometrial blood flow.

Previous studies have suggested that IFNgamma can promote rejection and be important in tolerance induction.\nTo analyze the various IFNgamma-dependent functions in terms of T helpers 1 and 2 responses during rejection, we investigated mice deficient in the transcription factors (signal transducer of activated T cells [STAT]4 and 6) and IFNgamma in fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched vascularized cardiac transplants. Serum levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IFNgamma, and interleukin (IL)-1beta were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the graft-infiltrating cells were examined by immunohistochemical staining. To analyze a large panel of immune parameters, we determined the expression of chemokines, chemokine receptors, and clusters of differentiation markers by RNAase protection assays. The data were analyzed with algorithms that generated hierarchic clustering dendrograms. Also, the expression profiles of individual genes were determined with self-organizing maps.\nOur data show that both the STAT4- and STAT6-deficient groups have statistically prolonged graft survival (P<0.04 and P<0.01). Despite the absence of prolongation of graft survival in the IFNgamma-deficient group, our analysis of variance data show that more genes (18) were modulated in the IFNgamma-deficient group compared with the other two STAT4- and STAT6-deficient groups (five each).\nOur results indicate that IFNgamma plays a distinct role in the modulation of gene expression that includes STAT4-independent mechanisms.

{"title": "Radiation induced-tubulogenesis in endothelial cells is antagonized by the antiangiogenic properties of green tea polyphenol (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate.", "abstract": "Radiation therapy is a widely-used option for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors. Although effective, ionizing radiation (IR) may give rise to various side effects, including secondary tumors. In agreement with this, recent reports have demonstrated increased invasive potential in different tumor-derived cell lines following radiation treatment. Many of the molecular effects of IR specifically on the endothelial cells involved in tumor neo-vascularization remain unknown. In this study, we found that low sublethal single doses of IR applied to human umbilical vein endothelial cells stimulated cell migration and in vitro tubulogenesis. This correlated with an increase in membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) protein expression, a crucial enzyme that promotes endothelial cell migration and tube formation, and of caveolin-1, a protein that regulates tube formation. Cell adhesion was also promoted by IR, reflected in increased gene expression levels of cell surface beta(3) integrin. Pretreatment of the cells with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), a green tea catechin that possesses anti-angiogenic properties, prevented most of the IR-induced cellular and molecular events. These observations suggest that current protocols involving radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer can paradoxically promote angiogenesis, but can be improved by combination with anti-angiogenic molecules such as EGCg to target those tumor-derived endothelial cells that escaped IR-induced apoptosis.", "journal": "Cancer biology & therapy", "date": "2003-12-23", "authors": ["BorhaneAnnabi", "Ying-TaLee", "CharlesMartel", "AnthonyPilorget", "Jean-PaulBahary", "RichardB\u00e9liveau"], "doi": null}

HBx directly interacted with the bHLH/PAS domain of HIF-1alpha but not with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). HBx decreased the binding of pVHL to HIF-1alpha and prevented ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha. In HBx-transgenic mice, HIF-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor were strongly detected in the dysplastic lesion, where HBx was also more highly expressed than in the non-neoplastic region of the liver.

In animal studies, we have reported that shock waves (SW) can promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through superoxide-mediated signal transduction (Wang, F. S., Wang, C. J., Sheen-Chen, S. M., Kuo, Y. R., Chen, R. F., and Yang, K. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 10931-10937) and vascularization of the bone-tendon junction. Here, we found that SW elevation of VEGF-A expression in human osteoblasts to be mediated by Ras-induced superoxide and ERK-dependent HIF-1alpha activation. SW treatment (0.16 mJ/mm(2), 1 Hz, 500 impulses) rapidly activated Ras protein (15 min) and Rac1 protein (30 min) and increased superoxide production in 30 min and VEGF mRNA expression in 6 h. Early scavenging of superoxide, but not nitric oxide, peroxide hydrogen, or prostaglandin E(2), reduced SW-augmented VEGF-A levels. Inhibition of superoxide production by diphenyliodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, was found to suppress VEGF-A expression. Transfection of osteoblasts with a dominant negative (S17N) Ras mutant abrogated the SW enhancement of Rac1 activation, superoxide synthesis, and VEGF expression. Further studies demonstrated that SW significantly promoted ERK activation in 1 h and HIF-1alpha phosphorylation and HIF-1alpha binding to VEGF promoter in 3 h. In support of the observation that superoxide mediated the SW-induced ERK activation and HIF-1alpha transactivation, we further demonstrated that scavenging of superoxide by superoxide dismutase and inhibition of ERK activity by PD98059 decreased HIF-1alpha activation and VEGF-A levels. Moreover, culture medium harvested from SW-treated osteoblasts increased vessel number of chick chorioallantoic membrane. Superoxide dismutase pretreatment and anti-VEGF-A antibody neutralization reduced the promoting effect of conditioned medium on angiogenesis.

Antiangiogenic molecules can inhibit neovascularization in tumors and other sites, but their effect on CECs has not yet been determined. We hypothesize that angiogenic factors will increase the number of CECs, and conversely, antiangiogenic treatment will reduce these numbers. Mice treated with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) showed increased numbers of Flk-1-positive cells in peripheral blood and endothelial cell colonies compared with vehicle-treated controls. These changes were accompanied by increased bone marrow neovascularization. In contrast, mice that received VEGF and endostatin had significantly lower numbers of CECs and reduced bone marrow vascularization. Endostatin-induced apoptosis was probably responsible for the decreased number of CECs. Systemic delivery of a VEGF antagonist, soluble Flt-1, also inhibited the VEGF-induced increase in CECs. These results were further confirmed in a Tie2/LacZ mouse model, in which endostatin reduced the number of beta-galactosidase-expressing peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We propose that endothelial progenitor cells are a novel target for endostatin and suggest that the relative numbers of CECs can serve as a surrogate marker for the biological activity of antiangiogenic treatment.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-12-18", "authors": ["GunterSchuch", "John VHeymach", "MasashiNomi", "MarcelleMachluf", "JeremyForce", "AnthonyAtala", "Joseph PEder", "JudahFolkman", "ShaySoker"], "doi": null}

Herein, we created transgenic mice with prostate-specific expression of ligand-inducible FGFR1 or FGFR2, based on lipid-permeable dimerizing molecules, called chemical inducers of dimerization. Despite extensive homology and equivalent expression by both chimeric receptors in the ventral prostate gland, only FGFR1 triggers detectable nuclear translocation of Erk and progression to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Induction of PIN grade I-II, indicated by multiple layers of atypical cells, is seen consistently by 12 weeks of chemical inducers of dimerization treatment. By 6 months, more extensive nuclear atypia, thickened \"reactive\" stroma, and basement membrane herniation occurs, corresponding to PIN IV. By timed removal of FGFR1 signaling, we show that induced hyperplasia is reversible until extensive intraductal vascularization occurs, but continued progression requires prolonged FGFR1 signaling. Additionally, by highlighting differences between the two receptors and creating the foundation for controlling FGFR1 signaling during prostate cancer progression, a model of early stage prostate cancer is established for developing targeted intervention directed toward the FGFR signaling axis.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-12-18", "authors": ["Kevin WFreeman", "Bryan EWelm", "Rama DGangula", "Jeffrey MRosen", "MichaelIttmann", "Norman MGreenberg", "David MSpencer"], "doi": null}

The recent ability to isolate stem cells and study their specific capacity of self-renewal with the formation of different cell types has opened up exciting vistas to help the repair of damaged tissue and even the formation of new tissue. In the present review, we deal with the characteristics and sources that stem cells can be derived and cultured from. 2. We focus on the role that stem cell-derived vascular cells or endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) may play in (re)vascularization of ischaemic and engineered tissues. This so-called vasculogenesis resembles the embryological process in which 'haemangioblasts' differentiate in blood cells, as well as in primitive vessels. Although also derived from the blood-forming bone marrow, in adult life vasculogenic stem cells contribute only little to the regular vascular repair mechanisms: namely (i) angiogenesis (outgrowth of vessels from existing vessels); and (ii) arteriogenesis (monocyte-aided increase in the calibre of existing arteriolar collaterals). 3. Most attempts to increase vascular repair by stem cells involve the use of growth factors, which mobilize stem cells from bone marrow into the blood, sometimes combined with isolation and reinfusion of these cells after ex vivo expansion and differentiation into EPC. 4. Clear improved perfusion of ischaemic sites and new vasculature has been observed in vivo mostly in animal models. Specific homing or administration of these cells and regulated and quantitative expansion and (final) differentiation at these vascular (repair) sites are less studied, but are paramount for efficacy and safety. 5. In conclusion, the use of embryonic stem cells will still encounter ethical objections. Moreover, special attention and measures are needed to cope with the allogeneic barriers that these cells usually encounter. In general, the long and complicated ex vivo cultures to obtain sufficient offspring from the very small numbers of stem cells that can be obtained as starting material will be costly and cumbersome.

We demonstrated previously that radioresistant human wild-type Ras U87 glioblastoma can be radiosensitized in vitro by the specific farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of this compound on the hypoxic status and the vascularization of this tumor.\nU87 xenografts bearing mice were treated with 100 mg/kg of R115777 b.i.d. during 4 days. Hypoxia was assessed by measuring the binding of hypoxic cell marker pentafluorinated 2-nitroimidazole. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze angiogenesis and metalloproteinase-2 expression.\nWe demonstrated here that R115777 treatment induced a significant oxygenation of U87 xenografts (P<0.001) associated with a decrease of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha expression. This reduction of hypoxia was not due to a decrease of tumor size after R115777 treatment. This oxygenation was associated with a change in vessel morphology and with a significant decrease of the vessel density. Moreover, R115777 treatment reduced matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression in xenografts and inhibited matrix metalloproteinase 2 activity in vitro. These data strongly suggest that R115777 could increase this tumor oxygenation at least by interacting with angiogenesis.\nOur results demonstrate that R115777 treatment inhibits different pathways leading to the radioresistance of wild-type Ras expressing glioblastoma, including intrinsic radioresistance, hypoxia, and angiogenesis. These combined effects on glioblastoma underline the interest of associating R115777 with radiotherapy as a new treatment of these tumors of catastrophic prognosis.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2003-12-17", "authors": ["CarolineDelmas", "DaveEnd", "PhilippeRochaix", "GillesFavre", "ChristineToulas", "ElizabethCohen-Jonathan"], "doi": null}

To investigate the potential antitumoral efficacy of systemic TSP-2 therapy, we expressed a recombinant 80 kDa fragment of human TSP-2 (TSP-2/NTF), encompassing the N-terminal globular region through the three type 1 repeats, in human kidney 293 EBNA cells, using a modified pCEP4 expression vector. Daily intraperitoneal injections of TSP-2/NTF resulted in a significant inhibition of the growth of human A431 squamous cell carcinomas in vivo and in reduced tumor vascularization. To further investigate possible mechanisms of the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-2/NTF, several in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. TSP-2/NTF inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor induced migration of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and inhibited tube formation on Matrigel in vitro. TSP-2/NTF also inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor induced angiogenesis in an in vivo Matrigel assay. Moreover, TSP-2/NTF potently induced human dermal microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis in vitro but did not affect A431 tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis.

Observations have confirmed that the reduction of plasma volume is also a factor pathogenetically determinant in the provocation of a faint. During orthostatic stress, plasma volume shifts towards the interstitial spaces of the infra-diaphragmatic vascular network, thus, contributing greatly to the reduction in the circulating volume. The aim of the present study was to calculate whether during orthostasis there was indeed a reduction in plasma volume and to what extent in a population at high risk for fainting. A comparative study of 50 recurrent fainters and 37 controls was performed. Each group was studied both in a supine (before) and orthostatic (after) position. Blood samples were taken to determine the hematocrit and hemoglobin values. The percentage variation of these values was calculated in order to obtain the reduction in plasma volume, i. e., the expression of the amount of plasma accumulated in the interstitial spaces. A significant difference in hematocrit and hemoglobin variation (before vs. after) was found between patients and controls. Plasma volume variation before vs. after (17.1 % in patients vs. 8.6 % in controls) was then calculated using these measurements. The difference in plasma volume variation between patients and controls can be interpreted as a co-factor together with the pooling of plasma in the pathogenesis of reflex fainting.

We generated mice deficient in Fbw7 and found that the embryos died in utero at embryonic day 10.5-11.5, manifesting marked abnormalities in vascular development. Vascular remodeling was impaired in the brain and yolk sac, and the major trunk veins were not formed. In vitro para-aortic splanchnopleural explant cultures from Fbw7(-/-) embryos also manifested an impairment of vascular network formation. Notch4, which is the product of the proto-oncogene Int3 and an endothelial cell-specific mammalian isoform of Notch, accumulated in Fbw7(-/-) embryos, resulting in an increased expression of Hey1, which encodes a transcriptional repressor that acts downstream of Notch signaling and is implicated in vascular development.

Vessels from quail embryo were grown into a polyurethane fibroporous mesh and the samples were frozen-thawed and then implanted in rat subcutaneous dorsum. Results show that the process of revascularization, using the quail vessel remnants, occurred over the first 3 days after implantation and resulted in functional vessels. Rat endothelial cells were found in the quail templates on day 1. On day 2 the endothelial cells formed a confluent layer and started producing laminin. By this time approximately 70% of the rat vessel tissue in the implant had grown into quail vascular remnants, indicating that the quail vessels were extensively used as templates for host vessel ingrowth. Laminin production was increased and collagen production started by day 3, at which time the vessels were functional in that rat blood flowed through them. At 2 weeks host vessel density was approximately twice that of control samples; thus the implant substantially enhanced the size of the vascular network. For meshes that additionally received vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) seeding before implantation, vessel density at 2 weeks was enhanced over samples with quail embryo alone. However, the quail was found to have the greatest angiogenic effect above any of the implant components-quail, VEGF, and collagen.

In this study, the authors developed an animal model to test the hypothesis that replication-defective, adenovirus-mediated human BMP-2 gene transfer to bone marrow stromal cells enhances the autologous bone formation for repairing a critical-size craniofacial defect. The mesenchymal stromal cells of miniature swine were separated from the iliac crest aspirate and expanded in monolayer culture 1 month before implantation. The cultured mesenchymal stromal cells were infected with recombinant, replication-defective human adenovirus BMP-2, 7 days before implantation. Bilateral 2 x 5-cm2 cranial defects were created, leaving no osteogenic periosteum and dura behind. Mesenchymal stromal cells at 5 x 10(7)/ml were mixed with collagen type I to form mesenchymal stromal cell/polymer constructs. Mesenchymal stromal cells used for the control site were infected with adenovirus beta-Gal under the same conditions.

{"title": "Palliative cytostatic treatment of cervical carcinoma.", "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE: In patients recurring after primary therapy for cervical cancer, treatment remains palliative. In the present article we focus on treatment results with single cytostatic drugs or combinations in randomized trials in squamous cell cervical cancer.\nIn one randomized trial, monotherapy with platinum analogues lead to overall remission rates between 11% and 15% only. The median overall survival ranged between 5.6 and 6.5 months. Various combinations lead to overall remission rates between 21% and 31% and the median overall survival ranged between 7.3 and 14.3 months. The most active combinations were cisplatin/bleomycin/mitomycin C/vindesine, cisplatin/paclitaxel, and cisplatin/irinotecan. There are several smaller studies with cystostatic therapy in cervical adenocarcinoma. However, using 5-fluoruracil, ifosfamide, paclitaxel, or cisplatinum, only response rates between 15 and 30% can be achieved. Predictors of a favorable chemotherapy response include a higher performance status, higher age, extrapelvic recurrence sites (especially lung metastases), a recurrence-free interval > 1 year, and no previous radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nIn conclusion, palliative cytostatic therapy with single agents has moderate activity. Combinations are more active but also more toxic. In general, chemotherapy needs to be used earlier in the course of disease when tissue vascularization is preserved.", "journal": "European journal of gynaecological oncology", "date": "2003-12-09", "authors": ["EPetru", "ChBenedicic", "ASeewann", "HPickel"], "doi": null}

The experiments were carried out on 29 mongrel dogs. Chronic ischemia of the right hind extremity was simulated in 24 dogs (the superficial femoral artery was ligated just beneath the iliac artery and over its whole length as were all its collaterals). The significance of extremity ischemia was confirmed clinically, angiographically and morphologically. In the first group (19 dogs), the ischemized extremity underwent one month later concurrent tunneling of the femoral muscles and bone perforation in the diaphysis and metaphysis by exposure to high-intensive laser (Nd: YAG laser). The second group (5 dogs) served as control to study the response to ischemia. There were examined the area of laser-induced injury, the internal diameter of the capillaries and the diameter of muscle fibers, the specific area of the surface of blood vessels in the muscle and connective tissue. By the 60th day after exposure to laser an appreciable difference was recorded in the control and experimental groups: in the experimental group, angiography revealed a much greater number of vessels in the zone of the ligated femoral artery. Microscopy showed vascularized scars with muscle type arteries, active proliferation of endotheliocytes, formation of a new vascular bed. It is assumed that the tunneling of the ischemized extremity muscles concurrently with osteotrephination by high-intensive laser substantially restores blood flow in the distal segments of the ischemized extremities. Intensive development of the vascular network in the areas of the tunneling of the ischemized muscles of the hind extremities by exposure to high-intensive laser allows to compare this modality with universally used revascularization osteotrephination.", "journal": "Angiologiia i sosudistaia khirurgiia = Angiology and vascular surgery", "date": "2003-12-06", "authors": ["D IAlekhin"], "doi": null}

FAK catalytic activity, proline-rich domains, and location in focal contacts were all required for proper allocation and patterning of FN matrix. Cells lacking FAK in focal adhesions fail to translocate supramolecular complexes of integrin-bound FN and focal adhesion proteins along actin filaments to form mature fibrillar adhesions.

To address this problem we have developed a method of endothelial cell transplantation that promotes vascularization of human skin equivalents in vivo. Enhancement of vascularization by Bcl-2 overexpression was demonstrated by seeding human acellular dermis grafts with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) transduced with the survival gene Bcl-2 or an EGFP control transgene, and subcutaneous implantation in immunodeficient mice (n=18). After 1 month the grafts with Bcl-2-transduced cells contained a significantly greater density of perfused HUVEC-lined microvessels (55.0/mm3) than controls (25.4/mm3,P=0.026). Vascularized skin equivalents were then constructed by sequentially seeding the apical and basal surfaces of acellular dermis with cultured human keratinocytes and Bcl-2-transduced HUVEC, respectively. Two weeks after orthotopic implantation onto mice, 75% of grafts (n=16) displayed both a differentiated human epidermis and perfusion through HUVEC-lined microvessels. These vessels, which showed evidence of progressive maturation, accelerated the rate of graft vascularization.

{"title": "Altered corticogenesis and neuronal morphology in irradiation-induced cortical dysplasia: a Golgi-Cox study.", "abstract": "Cortical dysplasia has a strong clinical association with epilepsy and mental retardation, but the relationship between alterations in cortical structure and function in dysplasia-related disorders is poorly understood. The cerebral cortex of irradiated rats, an experimental model of cortical dysplasia, was studied using cresyl violet-stained sections and the Golgi-Cox method. The irradiated cortex is characterized by reductions in size, volume, and number of neurons and fibers reflecting the original lethal injury to neuronal precursors. Consequently, only neurons that survived this injury were able to continue their, albeit altered, development. The result is an altered corticogenesis characterized by neuronal, fiber circuitry, and microvascular alterations. Abnormal aggregates (nodules) of excitatory pyramidal neurons with altered dendritic profiles and functional territories are found between 200 and 400 microm from the pial surface. Their horizontal dendritic profiles and functional territories contrast with the vertical (columnar) dendritic profiles and functional territories of normal pyramidal neurons. This horizontal concentration of spiny dendrites and, hence, of excitatory synaptic contacts suggests a response to the presence of an abnormal horizontal plexus of afferent fibers terminals. Stellate neurons, some morphologically compatible with inhibitory basket cells, are also essential components of these nodules. Some neuronal nodules are characterized by a rich plexus of anastomotic capillaries that contrasts with the sparser vasculature of surrounding gray matter tissue. The presence of well-vascularized aggregates of altered pyramidal and inhibitory neurons suggests a high level of metabolic activity. Well-vascularized deep heterotopias are also found. We propose that the functional activity of well-vascularized neuronal nodules and heterotopias could play a role in the abnormal cortical function in this model.", "journal": "Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology", "date": "2003-12-06", "authors": ["MiguelMar\u00edn-Padilla", "Regina JTsai", "Michael AKing", "Steven NRoper"], "doi": "10.1093/jnen/62.11.1129"}
{"title": "Minor contribution of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitors to the vascularization of murine gliomas.", "abstract": "Until recently, it was generally accepted that the vascularization of solid tumors occurred exclusively through the sprouting and co-option from pre-existing blood vessels. Growing evidence now suggests that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EP) circulate in the blood and may play an important role in the formation of new blood vessels in certain tumors. Whether endothelial progenitors participate in the vascularization of brain tumors has not yet been evaluated. In this study, we examined the contribution of EP to tumor angiogenesis in a murine glioma tumor model. Donor bone marrow cells obtained from transgenic mice constitutively expressing beta-galactosidase or GFP either ubiquitously or transcriptionally regulated by an endothelial specific promotor Tie-2 were injected into lethally irradiated adult mice. After bone marrow reconstitution by donor cells, mice were implanted with syngeneic GL261 murine glioma cells. Morphological and confocal 3-dimensional analysis showed that the majority of the engrafted donor marrow cells were expressing hematopoietic and/or microglia markers, but did not appreciably contribute to the tumor vasculature. Implantation of glioma cells genetically engineered to overexpress VEGF produced highly vascularized tumors. However, the number of endothelial progenitors incorporated in the tumor vasculature did not increase. These data strongly suggest that neovascularization in the brain might fundamentally be regulated by the sprouting of pre-existing vessels and implicate that circulating endothelial progenitors do not play a significant role in this process.", "journal": "Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)", "date": "2003-12-06", "authors": ["M\u00e1rcia ReginaMachein", "SabineRenninger", "Elisetede Lima-Hahn", "Karl HPlate"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1750-3639.2003.tb00487.x"}

Some, but not all, of the published morphological evidence supports the view that the lipid undergoes a cycle of hydrolysis and re-esterification during translocation across the YSM. The present study aims to test this view by investigating the capacity of the YSM to perform esterification of free fatty acids to form acyl-lipids. YSM pieces (area vasculosa), obtained from the chicken embryo at day 10 of development, were incubated in vitro in medium containing [14C]-palmitic acid. Radioactivity was rapidly incorporated into the tissue lipid indicating a high capacity for esterification. The incorporation was linear with time during the 1-h incubation. Approximately 84% of the incorporated label was recovered in triacylglycerol, 12% was incorporated into phospholipid and less than 1% was detected in cholesteryl ester. [14C]-palmitic acid was incorporated primarily at the sn-1/3 positions in the triacylglycerol molecule and at the sn-1 position of phospholipid. The incorporation of label into tissue pieces obtained from the non-vascularized peripheral region of the YSM (area vitellina) was much more limited than that observed for the area vasculosa.

Vascular casts were made by injection of 4 : 1 liquid plastic mixture of mercox and methylmethacrylate. Areolar formation was first observed at 4.5 cm curved-crown-rump CVR length, while by 5-9 cm CVR length, the endometrial surface was uneven and studded with numerous uterine gland openings, where corresponding foetal areolae were barely detectable and the foetal areolar cells were of variable appearance and covered with long microvilli. At 10-13 cm CVR length the uterine gland openings developed irregular folds and the maternal areolar cells showed numerous apical blebs. At 14-29 cm CVR length the foetal areolae showed a great increase in height at the expense of their width. At 30-34 cm (CVR) length the maternal areolae appeared discoid and sharply demarcated from the surrounding inter-areolar tissues and the foetal areolae were rounded to irregular in shape with well-developed areolar rims. The vascular casts showed a widely meshed capillary network on the maternal areola, connecting with the pre- and post-capillary vessels, whereas the foetal side showed a relatively dense capillary meshwork.

Mechanisms that lead to variations in the prevalence, penetrance and expressivity of SDH subunit mutations remain to be clarified to improve the clinical management of PGL patients.

{"title": "A reinforced random walk model of tumour angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic strategies.", "abstract": "It is now well accepted that the growth of a tumour beyond approximately 2 mm in diameter is dependent on its ability to induce the growth of new blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis. This has raised hope that an anti-angiogenic treatment may be effective in the fight against cancer. Here we formulate, using the theory of reinforced random walks, an individual cell-based mathematical model of tumour angiogenesis in response to a diffusible angiogenic factor. The early stages of angiogenesis, in which endothelial cells (EC) escape the parent vessel and invade the extra-cellular matrix, are included in the model, as are the action of a proteolytic enzyme, EC proliferation and capillary branching and anastomosis. The anti-angiogenic potential of angiostatin, a known inhibitor of angiogenesis, is also examined. The capillary networks predicted by the model are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Proteolysis and proliferation are shown to be crucial for vascularization, whilst angiostatin is seen to be capable of limiting capillary growth.", "journal": "Mathematical medicine and biology : a journal of the IMA", "date": "2003-11-26", "authors": ["M JPlank", "B DSleeman"], "doi": "10.1093/imammb/20.2.135"}

Acellular collagen matrices were derived from processed donor rabbit corpora, using cell lysis techniques. Human corpus cavernosal muscle and endothelial cells were seeded on the acellular matrices. A total of 80 matrices, 20 without cells and 60 with cells, were implanted subcutaneously in athymic mice. An additional 36 matrices seeded with cells were maintained in culture for up to 4 weeks. Hydroxyproline quantification, Western blot analysis, RT-PCR, and scanning electron microscopy of the matrices, with and without cells, were performed at various time points. Animals were killed 3 days and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after implantation. Immunocytochemical and histological analyses were performed to confirm the muscle and endothelial phenotype. Organ bath studies were performed in order to determine the degree of tissue contraction. Western blot analysis detected alpha-actin, myosin, and tropomyosin proteins from human corporal smooth muscle cells. Expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtype m4 mRNA was demonstrated by RT-PCR from corporal muscle cells before and 8 weeks after seeding. The implanted matrices showed neovascularity into the sinusoidal spaces by 1 week after implantation. Increasing organization of smooth muscle and endothelial cells lining the sinusoidal walls was observed at 2 weeks and continued with time. The matrices were covered with the appropriate cell architecture 4 weeks after implantation.

Standard penetrating keratoplasty (PK) suffers from the inherent problems of surface corneal incisions and sutures and poor wound healing of vertical stromal wounds. This often results in high irregular astigmatism, unpredictable corneal power, and the risk of long-term visual loss from suture-induced vascularization, ulceration, rejection, and late wound rupture. This paper delineates five ideal goals of endothelial replacement, which include: (1) a smooth surface topography without significant change in astigmatism from preoperative to postoperative; (2) a highly predictable and stable corneal power; (3) a healthy donor endothelium that resolves all oedema; (4) a tectonically stable globe, safe from injury and infection; and (5) an optically pure cornea. Deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK) is a surgical method of endothelial replacement that is performed through a limbal scleral incision that leaves the surface of the recipient cornea untouched. The early results of this innovative surgery are discussed and compared to the results of PK in terms of fulfillment of the five ideal goals of endothelial replacement.

{"title": "Biopolymeric delivery matrices for angiogenic growth factors.", "abstract": "The development of new therapeutic approaches that aim to help the body exert its natural mechanisms for vascularized tissue growth (therapeutic angiogenesis) has become one of the most active areas of tissue engineering. Through basic research, several growth factor families and cytokines that are capable to induce physiological blood vessel formation have been identified. Indeed, preclinical and clinical investigations have indicated that therapeutic administration of angiogenic factors, such as the prototypic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), to sites of ischemia in the heart or the limb can improve regional blood flow. For new and lasting tissue vascularization, prolonged tissue exposure to these factors could be critical. Furthermore, as shown for VEGF, dosage must be tightly controlled, as excess amounts of VEGF can cause severe vascular leakage and hypotension. This review emphasizes natural and synthetic polymer matrices with respect to their development as vehicles for local and controlled delivery of angiogenic proteins, such as VEGF and bFGF, and their clinical applicability. In the dawn of experimental vascular engineering, new biomaterial schemes for clinical growth factor administration that take better account of biological principles of angiogenic growth factor function and the cell biological basis necessary to produce functional vasculature are evolving. Alongside their base function as protective embedment for angiogenic growth factors, these new classes of bioactive polymers are engineered with additional functionalities that better preserve growth factor activity and more closely mimic the in vivo release mechanisms and profiles of angiogenic growth factors from the extracellular matrix (ECM). Consequently, the preparation of both natural or completely synthetic materials with biological characteristics of the ECM has become central to many tissue engineering approaches that aim to deliver growth factors in a therapeutically efficient mode. Another promising venue to improve angiogenic performance is presented by biomaterials that allow sequential delivery of growth factors with complementary roles in blood vessel initiation and stabilization.", "journal": "Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology", "date": "2003-11-25", "authors": ["Andreas HZisch", "Matthias PLutolf", "Jeffrey AHubbell"], "doi": "10.1016/s1054-8807(03)00089-9"}

A dominant concept of peripheral tolerance has been that exposure of T cells to signal one, the TCR-MHC interaction, in the absence of signal two, or costimulation, is a major mechanism of peripheral tolerance. This model suggests that any cell type that expresses MHC-peptide complexes, be they of self or foreign origin, should have the capacity to tolerize antigen-specific T cells when critical costimulatory interactions are interrupted. However, a spectrum of responses, from permanent engraftment to rapid rejection, has been observed in various transplantation models utilizing costimulatory blockade. Therefore we undertook a series experiments to directly assess the tolerogenic potential of donor hematopoietic and parenchymal cells. We find that allogeneic tissues differ profoundly in their ability to promote peripheral tolerance concurrent with combined blockade of B7-CD28 and CD40-CD40L pathways. Non-vascularized and vascularized parenchymal grafts as well as donor-specific transfusions promote varying degrees of donor-specific hyporesponsiveness, but fail to induce donor-reactive T-cell deletion; whereas establishment of stable hematopoietic chimerism promotes specific tolerance mediated by deletion of donor-reactive cells in the periphery.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2003-11-25", "authors": ["Thomas RJones", "Andrew BAdams", "Nozomu JShirasugi", "Adam WBingaman", "Megan MDurham", "Thomas CPearson", "Christian PLarsen"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1600-6135.2003.00262.x"}

In these animals, the labyrinthine layer of the placenta is very thin and few foetal blood vessels are observed. ERK2 mutants can be rescued by the transgenic expression of ERK2, demonstrating that these abnormalities are caused by ERK2-deficiency. Although ERK2-deficient fetuses are much smaller than wild-type littermates, this seems to be secondary to malfunction of the placenta. When the placental defect is rescued by tetraploid-aggregation, ERK2-deficient foetuses grow as well as littermate controls.\nThese observations indicate that ERK2 is essential for placental development and suggest that ERK2 in the trophoblast compartment may be indispensable for the vascularization of the labyrinth.", "journal": "Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms", "date": "2003-11-19", "authors": ["NaoyaHatano", "YoshikoMori", "MasatsuguOh-hora", "AtsushiKosugi", "TakahikoFujikawa", "NaoyaNakai", "HitoshiNiwa", "Jun-ichiMiyazaki", "ToshiyukiHamaoka", "MasatoOgata"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00680.x"}

Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is an emerging interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of biology and engineering to the development of viable substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve the function of human tissues and organs. Tissue engineering science has provided critical new knowledge that will deepen our understanding of the phenotype of an important category of cell types-the muscle cells-and this knowledge may enable meaningful advances in musculoskeletal tissue engineering. There are two principle strategies for the replacement of impaired muscle tissues. One approach uses the application of isolated and differentiated cells (in vivo tissue engineering), using a transport matrix for the cell delivery; the other uses in vitro-designed and pre-fabricated tissue equivalents (in vitro tissue engineering). Future developments and the decision regarding which approach is more promising depend on the elucidation of the relationships among cell growth and differentiation, the three-dimensional environment, the architecture of the cells, and gene expression of the developmental process and the survival of the cells and integration in the host in in vivo experiments.

It is known that they suppress signal transduction pathways mediated by growth factors [e.g., epidermal growth factor (EGF)] through the AT(1) receptor in vascular endothelial cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that A-II activates the cell proliferation of prostate cancer as well as EGF. In addition, we showed that A-II induces the phosphorylations of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in prostate cancer cells. In contrast, ARB was shown to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells stimulated with EGF or A-II, the mechanism of which is through the suppression of MAPK or STAT3 phosphorylation by ARB. Oral administration of ARB to nude mice inhibited the growth of prostate cancer xenografts in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cells in a dose-dependent manner. Microvessel density was reduced in xenografts treated with ARB, which means ARB inhibits the vascularization of xenografts. Expression of AT(1) receptor mRNA was examined by reverse transcription-PCR using 10 pairs of human prostate cancer and normal prostate tissues. AT(1) receptor expression in human prostate cancer tissue was higher (9 of 10 cases) than that in normal prostate tissue.

Solid tumors recruit new blood vessels to support tumor growth, and unique epitopes expressed on tumor endothelial cells can function as targets for the anti-angiogenic therapy of cancer. An NGR peptide that targets aminopeptidase N, a marker of angiogenic endothelial cells, was coupled to the surface of liposomal doxorubicin (NGR-SL[DXR]) and was used to treat orthotopic neuroblastoma (NB) xenografts in SCID mice. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that liposomes coupled to NGR peptide had long-circulating profiles in blood. Their uptake into NB tumor was time dependent, being at least 10 times higher than that of nontargeted liposomes (SL[DXR]) after 24 h, with DXR spreading outside the blood vessels and into the tumors. No uptake was observed into tumors of mice treated with the mismatched peptide ARA-targeted SL[DXR]. Tumor-specific DXR uptake was completely blocked when mice were coinjected with a 50-fold molar excess of the soluble NGR peptide. Adrenal tumor-bearing mice treated with 2 mg/kg/week/x3 of NGR-SL[DXR] partly outlived the control mice (P < 0.001), whereas doses > 3 mg/kg/week/x3 were toxic. Histopathological analysis of cryosections taken from treated mice revealed pronounced destruction of the tumor vasculature with a marked decreased in vessel density. Double staining of tumors with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling and antifactor VIII antibody or antihuman NB demonstrated endothelial cell apoptosis in the vasculature, as well as increased tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, mice injected with 3 mg/kg/week/x3 of NGR-SL[DXR] displayed rapid tumor regression, as well as inhibition of metastases growth (P = 0.0002). One day after the third treatment, four of six mice showed no evidence of tumors, and the two others showed a >80% reduction in tumor mass and a >90% suppression of blood vessel density (P < 0.01). In contrast, mice treated with ARA-SL[DXR] formed large well-vascularized tumors. Finally, a metronomic administration of NGR-SL[DXR] (1 mg/kg/every other 2 days x 9) induced complete tumor eradication in all animals (P < 0.0001). Our strategy markedly enhanced the therapeutic index of DXR and enabled metronomic administration of therapeutic doses. A dual mechanism of action is proposed: indirect tumor cell kill via the destruction of tumor endothelium by NGR-targeted liposomes and direct tumor cell kill via localization of liposomal DXR to the tumor interstitial space.

At day 40, tissue was obtained at varying distances from the infusion port and capsular microvessels were counted using two histologic techniques. VEGF treatment led to a marked increase in capillary density. In tissue located 1 mm away from the infusion site, capillary density in VEGF-treated animals was 200-300% higher than in saline controls. Tissue located 13 mm away, but not 25 mm away, also demonstrated neovascularization. Serum obtained from a distant vein during the infusion did not show an elevated concentration of VEGF.

{"title": "Angiogenesis during primate placentation in health and disease.", "abstract": "Normal embryonic development is dependent upon a sufficient oxygen, nutrient and waste exchange through the placenta. In primates including humans, this exchange is attained by successful haemochorial placentation which requires the transformation of maternal intramyometrial spiral arterioles by trophoblast invasion to gain uteroplacental circulation, and establishment and maintenance of a competent fetoplacental vasculature. Thus, trophoblast and endothelial cell differentiation, proliferation and invasion occurring during placentation have to be tightly regulated. This review focuses on the diverse developmental steps during haemochorial placentation in humans and other primates and the possible involvement of angiogenic growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietins (Ang)) in these processes, highlighting the importance of specific actions of angiogenic ligand-receptor pairs. It is hypothesized that VEGF/VEGF-R1 and Ang-1/Tie receptor 2 (Tie-2) may regulate trophoblast differentiation and invasion; VEGF/VEGF-R2 and Ang-1/Tie-2 may promote fetoplacental vascular development and stabilization; and Ang-2/Tie-2 may be involved in maternal vascular remodelling.

{"title": "Laser Doppler perfusion monitoring of skin blood flow at different depths in finger and arm upon local heating.", "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to elucidate the vasodilatory response to local heating of the skin at two depths in two locations. To accomplish this, we measured skin blood flow in 12 healthy subjects using laser Doppler perfusion monitoring. A probe with two fibers separated 0.14 mm (superficial) and 0.25 mm (deeper) from the illuminating fiber was first attached to the distal phalanx of the index finger and thereafter to the dorsal forearm skin. Local heating was caused with a thermostatic probe holder set at 40 degrees C. We studied the perfusion value and its two components, velocity and concentration. All registrations were also subjected to frequency analysis. Laser Doppler values were generally higher in the fingertip than in forearm skin. Heating caused increased values at both locations. Concentration increased relatively more than velocity and this was most obvious in the forearm. There were only slight differences in response between superficial and deeper vascular components. Frequency analysis revealed a peak in perfusion and velocity obviously related to the heartbeat. Movement of the column of blood thus reached the peripheral vascular network without changing concentration. We conclude that local heating increases skin blood flow in fingertip and forearm skin by different adjustments of blood cell concentration and velocity, presumably depending on differing vascular anatomy and physiological control, but differences are of a rather minor character. Furthermore, responses differ just slightly in superficial compartments as probed with fibers separated up to 0.25 mm.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2003-11-12", "authors": ["CarolinFreccero", "FrankHolmlund", "SivBornmyr", "JanCastenfors", "Anne-MarieJohansson", "G\u00f6ranSundkvist", "HenrySvensson", "PerWollmer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2003.06.001"}

{"title": "High level of stabilized angiostatin mediated by adenovirus delivery does not impair the growth of human neuroblastoma xenografts.", "abstract": "Human neuroblastoma (NB) is a highly heterogeneous childhood cancer secreting a high level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Its vascularization has been clearly correlated with metastatic progression and poor outcome. Thus, molecules that target the vascular endothelium are regarded as new therapeutics of clinical interest. Angiostatin, an internal fragment of plasminogen containing the first four kringle structures, has been described as a powerful angiogenic inhibitor. We used a recombinant adenovirus encoding the human angiostatin kringle 1-3 directly fused to human serum albumin HSA (AdK3-HSA). Coupling to HSA has been previously shown to increase the in vivo half-life of this angiostatic factor, and to lead to tumor growth inhibition in the MDA-MB-231 carcinoma model. For the assessment of antiangiogenic gene therapy in the human NB IGR-N835 tumor model, 5 x 10(9) PFU of AdK3-HSA were intravenously injected in tumor-bearing athymic mice presenting either of the following experimental settings: early stage, established, and minimal residual tumors. No delay in tumor growth was observed in animals treated with AdK3-HSA as compared to those treated with the empty virus AdCO1. In early-stage tumors, kinetics of tumor occurrence and tumor growth were similar in AdK3-HSA- and AdCO1-treated animals. K3-HSA was found to be expressed at high levels (the mean value for the three experiments being 19.4+/-15.9 microg/ml) in the circulation of all animals up to 21-35 days after virus injection. In addition, IGR-N835 tumors were found to be highly vascularized and to release high amounts of angiogenic factors, in particular VEGF (665+/-370 pg/mg total protein). Thus, in spite of high circulating levels, K3-HSA may be unable to displace the NB proangiogenic switch. In this regard, a more promising target to inhibit NB angiogenesis seems to be the VEGF/VEGFR system.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2003-11-08", "authors": ["Jean-MarcJoseph", "C\u00e8lineBouquet", "PauleOpolon", "JackieMorizet", "Genevi\u00e8veAubert", "JochenR\u00f6ssler", "NicoleGross", "FrankGriscelli", "MichelPerricaudet", "GillesVassal"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.cgt.7700639"}
{"title": "A novel antisense inhibitor of MMP-9 attenuates angiogenesis, human prostate cancer cell invasion and tumorigenicity.", "abstract": "Androgen deprivation therapy causes a paradoxical elevation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including MMP-9 resulting in aggressive tumor phenotype in many patients with prostate cancer. In this study, we have evaluated a novel antisense phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomer (PMO) targeted against MMP-9 in models of angiogenesis and in human prostate xenograft in athymic mice. The treatment of androgen-independent DU145 human prostate cells with a 21-mer MMP-9 antisense PMO caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation compared to scrambled or MMP-2 antisense PMO at similar concentrations. This was associated with decreases in MMP-9 expression, gelatinolytic activity and increased stability of the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP-3), a proapoptotic factor and MMP-9 substrate. In vitro invasion assays revealed a 40-60% inhibition of DU145 cell invasion in the presence of 25 microM MMP-9 antisense PMO. A significant decrease in endothelial cell migration and vascularization was observed in the Matrigel plug assay in mice when treated intraperitoneally with 300 microg/day MMP-9 antisense for 21 days. In the highly vascular DU145 tumor xenografts, MMP-9 inhibition caused decreased tumor growth with regression in 50% of the animals. Histological analysis revealed increased apoptosis and fibrous tissue deposits in the MMP-9 antisense-treated tumors compared to the scrambled and saline controls. No apparent toxicity or mortality was associated with the MMP-9 PMO treatment. In summary, the MMP-9 antisense PMO inhibited in vitro prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and in vivo angiogenesis. These data establish the feasibility of developing a site-directed, nontoxic antisense therapeutic agent for inhibiting local invasion and metastasis.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2003-11-08", "authors": ["Carla ALondon", "Harmanjatinder SSekhon", "VikramArora", "David AStein", "Patrick LIversen", "Gayathri RDevi"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.cgt.7700642"}

Ocular infection secondary to systemic mycosis is reported far more frequently. Suspicion of a fungal corneal ulcer should be raised based on a history of underlying trauma, especially with plant material, geographic location, chronic use of topical antibiotics or corticosteroids, or an extremely prolonged course of disease despite appropriate treatment. Clinical signs observed with fungal keratitis may include blepharospasm, epiphora, miosis, corneal opacity, and vascularization. Unfortunately, none of these signs is specific to fungal infection. If fungal keratitis is suspected or confirmed, then aggressive medical therapy should be instituted. Medications used include topical antifungals, parasympatholytics, anticollagenases, and antibacterials as well as systemic anti-inflammatory drugs. Because there are very few fungicidal medications, the course of medical treatment for fungal corneal disease requires a prolonged duration with frequent re-examination and assessment.

{"title": "Corneal diagnostic procedures.", "abstract": "The cornea is the anterior, transparent portion of the fibrous tunic of the eye. It is continuous with the sclera at a transition called the limbus. In healthy conditions, the transparency of the cornea is maintained by the smooth, nonkeratinized, squamous epithelium, which is further enhanced by the precorneal tear film, the lack of corneal vascularization or pigmentation, the size and regular arrangement of the collagen fibrils that make up the corneal stroma, and the relative dehydration of the cornea (which is maintained by the endothelium and epithelium). The cornea can respond to adverse stimuli through vascularization, pigmentation, fibrosis, accumulation of cellular or noncellular infiltrate, and/or edema. Because of these limited responses, routine diagnostic procedures are critical in the diagnosis and treatment of corneal disorders.

{"title": "Microfractures and microcracks in subchondral bone: are they relevant to osteoarthrosis?", "abstract": "The existing data are consistent with the view that reactivation of the secondary center of ossification and not the stiffening of the metaphyseal trabecular bone is a mechanism of cartilage loss in idiopathic OA. The stiffening of the subchondral calcified structures would appear to be etiologically incidental and, as the arthrotic process progresses, sometimes locally transient. It is also now clear that although the apparent density of the subchondral cortical plate increases because of thickening of the plate as the OA process progresses, the elastic modulus of the bone might be reduced locally because of increases in vascularization and in the rate of bony remodeling subjacent to the cartilage. Microcracks in the subchondral mineralized tissues might contribute to degeneration of the hyaline cartilage by initiating vascular invasion of the calcified cartilage, leading to reactivation of the tidemark and enchondral ossification with subsequent thinning of the overlying articular cartilage. The thinning would tend to increase shear stresses at the base of the articular cartilage [38], overwhelming the ability of the cartilage to repair itself, resulting in cartilage degeneration. The pathogenesis of cartilage breakdown in OA is a biological and a mechanical process. OA can be understood only if the relationship between the mechanics and the biology is fully appreciated. Failure to properly absorb impact leads to microdamage in the subchondral plate and calcified cartilage. The authors believe that this action causes the secondary center of ossification at the tidemark to advance by enchondral ossification, leading to thickening of the mineralized tissues and thinning of the overlying hyaline articular cartilage. Microcracks will cause the initiation of targeted remodeling, accounting for the increased turnover and reduced material density of the subchondral plate. The resultant thinning of the articular cartilage might lead to initiation of further microdamage in bone and cartilage through a positive feedback mechanism, which can ultimately lead to complete loss of the articular cartilage. In this view, the mechanical overload that initiates microdamage of the subchondral bone provokes a biological response that potentiates the progression of articular cartilage damage in OA.", "journal": "Rheumatic diseases clinics of North America", "date": "2003-11-08", "authors": ["David BBurr", "Eric LRadin"], "doi": "10.1016/s0889-857x(03)00061-9"}
{"title": "Overexpression of the soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor in preeclamptic patients: pathophysiological consequences.", "abstract": "Several growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and placental growth factor (PlGF) are involved in the placental vascular development. We investigated whether dysregulation in the VEGF family may explain the defective uteroplacental vascularization characterizing preeclampsia. We compared pregnancies complicated by early onset severe preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation to normal pregnancies. Maternal plasma, placentas, and placental bed biopsies were collected. The mRNA levels of VEGF-A, PlGF, and their receptors were quantified in placentas and placental beds. Levels of VEGF-A, PlGF, and soluble VEGF receptor (VEGFR) were assessed in maternal plasma. In compromised pregnancies, elevated levels of VEGF-A and VEGFR-1 mRNAs may reflect the hypoxic status of the placenta. On contrast, the membrane-bound VEGFR-1 was decreased in the placental bed of preeclamptic patients. Preeclampsia was associated with low levels of circulating PlGF and increased levels of total VEGF-A and soluble VEGFR-1. Free VEGF-A was undetectable in maternal blood. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that VEGF-A and PlGF were localized in trophoblastic cells. Altogether, our results suggest two different pathophysiological mechanisms associated with preeclampsia. The first one is related to an overproduction of competitive soluble VEGFR-1 that may lead to suppression of VEGF-A and PlGF effects. The second one is the down-regulation of its membrane bound form (VEGFR-1) in the placental bed, which may result in the defective uteroplacental development.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "date": "2003-11-07", "authors": ["VassilisTsatsaris", "FredericGoffin", "CarineMunaut", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisBrichant", "Marie-RosePignon", "AgnesNoel", "Jean-PierreSchaaps", "DominiqueCabrol", "FrancisFrankenne", "Jean-MichelFoidart"], "doi": "10.1210/jc.2003-030528"}

Eleven had undergone unsuccessful closure with a buccal flap. Data recorded were patient age and sex, cause of fistula, signs and symptoms, interval from appearance of fistula to repair, fistula size, radiographic appearance, method of repair, and immediate and late complications.\nThere were 35 women and 28 men aged 21 to 71 years (mean 50.3 years). Surgery was performed 3 months to 20 years after injury (mean 1.8 years). Twenty-four patients had acute maxillary sinusitis and 39 had chronic sinusitis. The main causes of oroantral fistula were extraction of the second and first molars and pathological lesions within the sinus. Average fistula size was 2.3 cm x 1.6 cm. Fifty-one repairs were preceded by Caldwell-Luc operation. All fistulas were successfully closed with the palatal rotation-advancement flap, with minimal complications on long-term follow-up.\nThe palatal rotation-advancement flap is recommended for the late repair of oroantral fistula owing to its good vascularization, excellent thickness and tissue bulk, and easy accessibility; it also allows for the maintenance of the vestibular-sulcus depth.

{"title": "A multivessel model describing replenishment kinetics of ultrasound contrast agent for quantification of tissue perfusion.", "abstract": "To improve the quantification of tissue perfusion using intermittent sonography, a new model describing replenishment kinetics of microbubbles is proposed. The new approach takes into account the variability of blood flow velocities found in vivo, especially in tumors, and consistently describes the refilling process of microbubbles. Based upon this model, blood volume, blood velocity, blood flow and perfusion in 17 experimental tumors were calculated, and compared with the results obtained with the established, phenomenologically derived exponential kinetic model. In contrast to the existing model, our approach describes tissue vascularization more physiologically and allows deduction of a consistent new hyperbolic model for quantification of intermittent sonography. Blood volume and mean blood velocity did significantly correlate between both the new and the established model (k=0.99; k=0.94, both p<0.001). However, mean tumor blood velocity was lower (-19%, p<0.01) with the established model compared to the newly developed model. In addition, the range and distribution of blood flow velocities found in vivo can be estimated with the new model. Furthermore, it uses simpler mathematical fitting routines and allows easier data acquisition, which may allow a more practicable clinical application of intermittent sonography.

METHODS/CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old boy presented with an asymptomatic tumor of the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopy revealed an amelanotic, vascularized ciliary body tumor with exudative retinal detachment and partial transillumination. On ultrasound examination the tumor height was 8 mm and a low internal reflectivity was found. T2-weighted MRI scans showed a hypointense and T1-weighted scans a hyperintense intraocular mass with significant Gd-TPA enhancement. On the assumption that the diagnosis was consistent with an amelanotic ciliary body melanoma, a transscleral resection with adjuvant ruthenium-106 brachytherapy was performed. Visual acuity was 20/40 at 6 months after the operation.\nRoutine stains revealed a pleomorphic tumor composed mainly of spindle cells with palisading in some areas and a prominent intercellular fibrillary background. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for desmin, vimentin and actin. No reactivity with S-100 and HMB-45 was seen. Intracytoplasmatic filaments and micropinocytotic vesicles were detected by transmission electron microscopy. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of a ciliary body leiomyoma.\nTypical clinical features of leiomyoma include a dome-shaped configuration and translucency, but the final diagnosis can only be confirmed by histology with the aid of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.

Our aims were (a) to study the structural organization of the microvascular bed in prolactin (PRL)-producing adenomas and carcinomas, the most vascularized of pituitary tumors, by assessing microvascular structural entropy (MSE), and (b) to determine whether the degree of disorder of the capillary bed correlates with tumor cell proliferation as estimated by MIB-1 labeling, microvessel density (MVD), the most widely used method of quantifying blood vessel formation, and various clinicopathologic parameters (gender, age, tumor size and invasiveness). The morphometric study demonstrated statistically significant differences in MIB-1 labeling, MVD, and MSE between PRL-producing adenomas and carcinomas. Unlike MIB-1 labeling index (PRL-producing adenomas 1.5 +/- 0.27; carcinomas 15.0 +/- 4.04) and MVD (PRL-producing adenomas 2.7 +/- 0.34; carcinomas 4.2 +/- 0.72), the MSE values were significantly higher in adenomas (171.5 +/- 25.37) than in carcinomas (67.9 +/- 17.45). These results indicate that PRL-producing carcinomas have a less chaotic distribution of vessels than benign adenomas. In contrast to a lack of correlation between microvessel density and other morphometric parameters, a strong negative correlation was found between MSE and MIB-1 labeling index (r = 0.511, p = 0.003). It thus appears that regular, less chaotic microvascular geometry contributes to increased proliferative activity in PRL cell tumors.

EC expressed Bcl-xL and were protected from TNF-mediated apoptosis. Bcl-xL expression was inhibited by an adenosine A2 receptor antagonist. Human anti-pig XNA were shown to bind and induce cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) generation through these receptors. This activity was abolished by depletion of anti-galalpha(1-3)gal-specific XNA. In contrast, alloantibody caused adenosine production. Protection from TNF-mediated apoptosis was also mediated through A2 receptor but involved additional non-cAMP-dependent signaling. This study indicates a molecular mechanism common to both antibody-mediated cytoprotection and ischemic preconditioning and suggests a potential therapeutic avenue based on adenosine for improving the outcome of transplanted grafts in those patients with pre-existing anti-graft antibody.", "journal": "European journal of immunology", "date": "2003-10-28", "authors": ["AlexandrosDelikouras", "Lynette DFairbanks", "Anne HSimmonds", "Robert ILechler", "AnthonyDorling"], "doi": "10.1002/eji.200323566"}
{"title": "Developmental changes at the materno-embryonic interface in early pregnancy of the alpaca, Lamos pacos.", "abstract": "This study analyses the manner in which trophoblast cells adhere to uterine epithelium and the subsequent interactions that contribute to the establishment of epitheliochorial placentation in the alpaca Lama pacos. Specimens at the luteal and follicular phases and at 22, 26, 30 and 45 days of pregnancy (op) were processed for morphological studies. On day 15 op, the blastocysts are completely free within the uterine lumen, with implantation starting around day 20. On days 22 and 26 of gestation, the trophoblast is apposed to the epithelial surface of the uterus, with areas of contact and adhesion by means of complex interdigitation. Implantation sites occur prevalently in the left uterine horn, but an expanded trophoblast also occupies large extensions of the right horn, where the maternofetal interaction shows peculiar areas of apposition. As development continues, attachment areas become more extensive. On days 30 and 45, many secretory granules can be seen in the uterine epithelium, while giant multinucleate cells appear interposed between the remaining trophoblast cells, showing intense alkaline phosphatase activity, deposits containing iron and PAS-positive granules. Placental lactogen hormone is not present within the cytoplasm of the binucleate or multinucleate trophoblast cells. By day 30 of gestation, the trophoblast layer is lined by an extraembryonic connective tissue that by day 45 is well vascularized, thus indicating the starting point of placental formation. Fetal and maternal capillaries indent the epithelium and the trophoblast, narrowing the specialized areas of exchange, which occur along the entire maternofetal interface, characterizing the diffuse nature of this placenta.", "journal": "Anatomy and embryology", "date": "2003-10-28", "authors": ["L V MOlivera", "D AZago", "C J PJones", "EBevilacqua"], "doi": "10.1007/s00429-003-0346-1"}

In chimeric embryos containing both wild-type and Csk(-/-) cells, the presence of wild-type cells enabled Csk(-/-) endothelial cells to participate in branching morphogenesis. We suggest that wild-type cells may have supplied an angiogenic factor absent in Csk(-/-) cells.

To better understand the underlying pathophysiologic basis for this radiosensitization, the current study investigated whether short-term endostatin administration is linked to alterations in tumor vascular perfusion and oxygen delivery.\nThree daily doses of recombinant endostatin (20 mg/kg) were administered to two murine mammary carcinomas, the highly vascularized MCa-35 and the less vascularized MCa-4. Image analysis techniques were used to quantify (1) total and perfused vascular spacing, and (2) changes in tumor hypoxia as a function of distance from the nearest blood vessel.\nIn MCa-35 tumors, endostatin had no effect on vessel spacing, tumor hypoxia, or tumor growth. In MCa-4 tumors, total and perfused vessel spacings were also unchanged, but tumor growth was inhibited, and tumor hypoxia significantly decreased. These tumors demonstrated an increased vascular functionality suggestive of an increase in the number of intermittently perfused vessels, without corresponding alterations in tumor oxygen consumption rate.\nPoorly vascularized, hypoxic mammary carcinomas were much more responsive to short-term endostatin treatment than well-vascularized, more homogeneously oxygenated tumors. Oxygen levels in the responsive tumors were transiently improved after treatment, which could have substantial implications with respect to the therapeutic effectiveness of combining antiangiogenic agents with conventional therapies.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2003-10-25", "authors": ["Bruce MFenton", "Scott FPaoni", "Brian GGrimwood", "IvanDing"], "doi": "10.1016/s0360-3016(03)01430-5"}
{"title": "A cellular automaton model for tumour growth in inhomogeneous environment.", "abstract": "Most of the existing mathematical models for tumour growth and tumour-induced angiogenesis neglect blood flow. This is an important factor on which both nutrient and metabolite supply depend. In this paper we aim to address this shortcoming by developing a mathematical model which shows how blood flow and red blood cell heterogeneity influence the growth of systems of normal and cancerous cells. The model is developed in two stages. First we determine the distribution of oxygen in a native vascular network, incorporating into our model features of blood flow and vascular dynamics such as structural adaptation, complex rheology and red blood cell circulation. Once we have calculated the oxygen distribution, we then study the dynamics of a colony of normal and cancerous cells, placed in such a heterogeneous environment. During this second stage, we assume that the vascular network does not evolve and is independent of the dynamics of the surrounding tissue. The cells are considered as elements of a cellular automaton, whose evolution rules are inspired by the different behaviour of normal and cancer cells. Our aim is to show that blood flow and red blood cell heterogeneity play major roles in the development of such colonies, even when the red blood cells are flowing through the vasculature of normal, healthy tissue.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2003-10-25", "authors": ["TAlarc\u00f3n", "H MByrne", "P KMaini"], "doi": "10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00244-3"}

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is known to be a well-vascularized tumour. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of VEGF mRNA and receptor flt-1 mRNA (VEGF R1) in a clinical material of RCCs compared with clinicopathological variables and serum VEGF levels. Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen tumour tissue obtained from 61 patients. Expression of mRNA for VEGF121, VEGF165 and flt-1 were analysed using quantitative RT-PCR. Relative VEGF mRNA levels, corrected for corresponding cyclophilin value, were related to stage, grade, RCC type and survival time. Serum VEGF165 protein was analysed using a quantitative ELISA. Papillary RCC had significantly lower VEGF121 and flt-1 mRNA levels compared with conventional RCC (p=0.001). VEGF121 mRNA levels were significantly lower in locally advanced tumours in relation to tumours limited to the kidney and those with metastatic disease (p=0.047 and p=0.036). This statistical difference disappeared when only conventional RCCs were evaluated. No association was found between VEGF mRNA levels and nuclear grade. Patients with lower VEGF121 mRNA levels had significantly longer survival time compared with those with higher levels (when adjusted to stage, p=0.0097, log rank test). There was an inverse relation between VEGF165 mRNA and serum VEGF165 levels. The trend to lower VEGF121 mRNA levels in locally advanced RCC indicate that angiogenic activity and degradation might be up-regulated in tumours with a high ability to invade. The association with tumour progression shows that VEGF is a promising angiogenic factor especially important in conventional RCCs.

C57BL/6 mice were infected i.m. with adenovirus containing either beta-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) as control or the secreted extracellular isoform of SOD (Ad.ecSOD) 3 days before s.c. implantation of B16-F1 tumor cells. Serum SOD activity was elevated nearly approximately 5-fold over control animals. Two weeks after implantation, B16-F1 tumor size was 65% smaller in mice infected with Ad.ecSOD in comparison with mice infected with Ad.lacZ. However, the presence of SOD did not affect growth rates of B16-F1 cells in vitro. Consistent with smaller tumor volume, tumors from Ad.ecSOD-infected mice also expressed less vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Moreover, in vitro studies using B16-F1 cells confirm that SOD blunts oxidant-dependent VEGF expression. Importantly, CD31 expression and vessel density were markedly reduced in tumors from Ad.ecSOD-infected mice compared with controls.

On the basis of its high antitumor efficacy when delivered by the oral route, the compound is suitable for prolonged administration. This schedule of treatment has been reported as the most appropriate to exploit the antiangiogenic effects of cytotoxic drugs. The aim of the study was to investigate the antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of oral ST1481 in human tumor xenografts. In spite of a marginal drug effect against the s.c. growing A549 lung carcinoma following administration with an intermittent schedule (q4dx4 times, maximum tolerated dose: 2 mg/kg), tumor growth was strongly inhibited by a daily low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) prolonged administration. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a reduced number of microvessels in tumors of both treated groups versus controls and a significantly higher reduction in the daily versus the q4dx4-treated tumors (P < 0.0001, by Student's t test). In our experimental model, the relation between microvessel density and tumor size (r = 0.738, by the Spearman rank test) suggests a role of inhibition of tumor vasculature in tumor response. Significant inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (P < 0.0001 versus control tumors) was observed even with a very low drug dose (0.06 mg/kg) in the orthotopically implanted (i.d.) MeWo melanoma, under conditions causing minimal tumor growth inhibition. Additional evidences of the antiangiogenic activity of ST1481 were provided by antimotility effects on endothelial cells, in vivo inhibition of vascularization in the Matrigel assay, and down-regulation of the expression of the proangiogenic basic fibroblast growth factor in A549 tumor cells associated with inhibition of the pathway involving Akt.

{"title": "pH regulates vascular endothelial growth factor binding to fibronectin: a mechanism for control of extracellular matrix storage and release.", "abstract": "Hypoxia is one of the major signals that induces angiogenesis. Hypoxic conditions lead to reduced extracellular pH. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding to endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) increases at acidic pH (7.0-5.5). These interactions are dependent on heparan sulfate proteoglycans, but do not depend on the presence of VEGF receptors. Here we report that VEGF(165) and VEGF(121) binding to fibronectin also increased at acidic pH, and that these interactions are further enhanced by the addition of heparin. These results reveal that the accepted non-heparin-binding isoform of VEGF (VEGF(121)) is converted into a heparin-binding growth factor under acidic conditions. Interestingly, we did not observe increased binding of VEGF to collagen type I at acidic pH in the presence or absence of heparin, indicating that this effect is not a general property of all heparin-binding ECM proteins. The high level of VEGF binding at acidic pH was also rapidly reversed as demonstrated by increased rates of VEGF dissociation from fibronectin and fibronectin-heparin matrices as the pH was raised. The VEGF released from fibronectin retained its ability to stimulate the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 in endothelial cells. These results suggest that VEGF may be stored in the extracellular matrix via interactions with fibronectin and heparan sulfate in tissues that are in need of vascularization so that it can aid in directing the dynamic process of growth and migration of new blood vessels.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2003-10-23", "authors": ["Adrienne LGoerges", "Matthew ANugent"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M308482200"}

Our previous study showed that passive cigarette smoking promoted inflammation-associated colonic adenoma formation in mice, and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) plays an important role in this process. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether nicotine could stimulate colon cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in nude mice xenograft model and the possible mechanisms involved. Results showed that nicotine stimulated SW1116 colon cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Src phosphorylation levels together with protein expression of 5-LOX were also significantly enhanced in this proliferation process. Inhibitors of EGFR and c-Src alleviated the actions of nicotine on cell proliferation and 5-LOX protein expression. Combination of both agents produced additive effect. In contrast, 5-LOX inhibitor had no direct effect on the phosphorylation levels of EGFR and c-Src and yet inhibited cell proliferation. In the colon cancer xenograft model, nicotine also significantly enhanced tumor growth. This acceleration of tumor growth corresponded well with increased vascularization and its proangiogenic factors. Inhibitors of EGFR, c-Src, and 5-LOX all significantly impeded the tumor growth induced by nicotine. Together, nicotine can promote colonic tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo.

Abnormal leaflet anatomy was demonstrated in all patients with severe TR, with restricted leaflet motion in 10, leaflet shortening and thickening in the remainder, and dilatation of tricuspid valve annular insertion suggestive of rheumatic involvement.

{"title": "Therapeutic contact lenses: the role of high-Dk lenses.", "abstract": "Currently, the armamentarium of contact lenses that can be used for therapeutic effect provides a wider selection of lenses than ever before. If the therapeutic goal is protection and healing of the corneal epithelium, epithelial or stromal edema is best avoided, and the selection of a high-Dk silicone hydrogel (balafilcon A, lotrafilcon A) lens or a very thin membrane-type lens (crofilcon) is the best choice. If the goal is surface protection as well as stimulation of stromal wound vascularization, selection of a low-water content, thick, hydrophilic lens is the better option. If the patient is prone to lens loss or requires frequent replacement of the therapeutic lens, a prudent economic decision is to select a daily disposable moderate-water content lens. Specific circumstances may mandate the selection of a specific therapeutic lens. Patients with a prior history of active giant papillary conjunctivitis may be better served by the use of a crofilcon glyceryl methacrylate lens, which has a lower incidence of this complication. Patients who have dry eye may benefit from a higher-water content lens if adequate unpreserved tear supplementation is provided with or without punctal occlusion. The options when selecting a therapeutic contact lens are wider than ever before. Although the new generation of high-Dk lenses promises fewer limiting problems of vascularization and infection, one can use the older traditional therapeutic lenses when induced vascularization of the cornea is needed or when an economic necessity exists. Not all of the available lenses are FDA approved for therapeutic use, and such wear is an off-label use.

{"title": "Cell-demanded release of VEGF from synthetic, biointeractive cell ingrowth matrices for vascularized tissue growth.", "abstract": "Local, controlled induction of angiogenesis remains a challenge that limits tissue engineering approaches to replace or restore diseased tissues. We present a new class of bioactive synthetic hydrogel matrices based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and synthetic peptides that exploits the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) alongside the base matrix functionality for cellular ingrowth, that is, induction of cell adhesion by pendant RGD-containing peptides and provision of cell-mediated remodeling by cross-linking matrix metalloproteinase substrate peptides. By using a Michael-type addition reaction, we incorporated variants of VEGF121 and VEGF165 covalently within the matrix, available for cells as they invade and locally remodel the material. The functionality of the matrix-conjugated VEGF was preserved and was critical for in vitro endothelial cell survival and migration within the matrix environment. Consistent with a scheme of locally restricted availability of VEGF, grafting of these VEGF-modified hydrogel matrices atop the chick chorioallontoic membrane evoked strong new blood vessel formation precisely at the area of graft-membrane contact. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, these VEGF-containing matrices were completely remodeled into native, vascularized tissue. This type of synthetic, biointeractive matrix with integrated angiogenic growth factor activity, presented and released only upon local cellular demand, could become highly useful in a number of clinical healing applications of local therapeutic angiogenesis.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2003-10-18", "authors": ["Andreas HZisch", "Matthias PLutolf", "MartinEhrbar", "George PRaeber", "Simone CRizzi", "NeilDavies", "HugoSchm\u00f6kel", "DeonBezuidenhout", "ValentinDjonov", "PeterZilla", "Jeffrey AHubbell"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.02-1041fje"}

Rhesus ES cells (R366.4 cell line) exposed to medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) assumed a relatively uniform endothelial cell morphology and could be propagated and expanded with a consistent phenotype and normal karyotype. When placed in Matrigel, these rhesus ES cell-derived endothelial cells (RESDECs) formed capillary-like structures characteristic of endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analysis of RESDECs showed that they take up acetylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), express CD146, von Willebrand factor, and the integrin alpha v beta 3, and bind the lectin ulex europaeus agglutinin-1. These cells also express the VEGF receptor Flk-1 and secrete VEGF. When introduced in a Matrigel plug implanted subcutaneously in mice, RESDECs formed intact vessels and recruited new endothelial cell growth. In vivo function was demonstrated by coinjection of RESDECs with murine tumor cells subcutaneously into immunocompromised adult mice. RESDECs injected alone did not form measurable tumors. Tumor cells grew more rapidly and had increased vascularization when coinjected with the RESDECs. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the RESDECs participated in forming the tumor neovasculature.

NF-kappaB has been shown to be a crucial transcription factor that regulates CM expression on the surface of APC. We designed an antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) to specifically inhibit mRNA of mouse NF-kappaB, resulting in a deficiency in CM expression on APC that may prolong organ allograft survival. Anti-NF-kappaB ODN was delivered systemically by an osmotic pump implanted in the abdominal cavity of recipients following transplantation of vascularized heart allografts. The animals in control groups were given scrambled control ODN or were left untreated. Normal C3H (H2(k)) recipients rejected B10 (H2(b)) heart allografts at a median survival time (MST) of 15 days. A 14-day administration of 12.5 mg/kg/day anti-NF-kappaB ODN prolonged the survival of cardiac allografts to an MST of 25 days (P <0.05). In contrast, a scrambled control ODN was not effective (MST 17 days, P >0.05 compared to untreated controls). To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the immunosuppressive effect of anti-NF-kappaB ODN administration, graft infiltrating cells, spleen cells, and serum were collected from animals on day 7 posttransplant. Freshly isolated graft-infiltrating cells from anti-NF-kappaB ODN-treated recipients exhibited significantly decreased donor-specific CTL activity. Generation of CTL activity of spleen T cells from anti-NF-kappaB ODN-treated recipients was also impaired compared with untreated animals. Administration of anti-NF-kappaB ODN did not influence the titers of complement-dependent cytotoxic antibodies.

The tumor size ranged from 2 to 8 cm with an average size of 3.6 cm. While intermittent energy was supplied during thermoablation, multi-slice CT (Volume-Zoom, Siemens) and ultrasound were obtained. Ultrasound was performed with a multi-frequency transducer (3 - 7 MHz, LOGIQ 700, GE) and 0.5 to 1 ml of Optison as contrast agent. If necessary, the injection of the contrast agent was repeated after about 30 min. The mechanical index (MI) was set low (0.2 - 0.3) to prevent bubble destruction. Ultrasound power Doppler (PD), contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) and coded harmonic angiography (CHA) as subtraction mode of harmonic imaging were applied intermittently.\nOnly 21 of the 34 lesions showed increased intratumoral perfusion when the conventional B-Mode with PD was used. Similar to spiral CT, the tumor vascularization in the early arterial phase was only reliably visible with CHA after application of contrast agent. CHI with PD was best to detect increasing hypoperfusion of the tumors. When the energy supply was continued, hyperechoic border zones became visible around the central hypoechoic defects. The contrast between remaining tumor and surrounding liver tissue improved in CHI for up to 30 min after the bolus injection of contrast medium, considerably facilitating the evaluation of perfusion. Metal artifacts and the limited amount of contrast agent that can be safely administered interfered with monitoring the thermal ablation with spiral-CT. After an administered energy of maximal 100.000 watts, no more tumor vascularization was seen in 28 of 34 cases.

Here we examined the effects of bortezomib on apoptosis and angiogenesis in derivatives of two popular human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP-Pro5 and PC3M-Pro4). Bortezomib strongly inhibited proliferation in both cell lines in vitro, but the PC3M-Pro4 cells were significantly more sensitive than the LNCaP-Pro5 cells to bortezomib-induced apoptosis. The compound also significantly inhibited the growth of LNCaP-Pro5 and LNCaP-Pro4 tumor xenografts, but the mechanisms involved in tumor growth inhibition differed in the two models. Bortezomib-treated LNCaP-Pro5 tumors displayed reduced microvessel densities and vascular endothelial cell growth factor secretion and high levels of endothelial cell apoptosis consistent with angiogenesis inhibition. In contrast, PC3M-Pro4 tumors were poorly vascularized at baseline, and bortezomib failed to induce significant changes in microvessel density, angiogenic factor secretion, or endothelial cell death in this model. Rather, growth inhibition in the PC3M-Pro4 tumors was associated with direct increases in tumor cell death.

Primary reconstruction after resection of the condyle is often problematic because an early onset of adjuvant systemic therapy is required. In this case, the insertion of a Quinn joint prosthesis is presented after resection of a TMJ metastasis.\nWe report a hematogenic metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma in a 51-year old male who initially presented with increasing disclusion in the left molar region. Suspecting a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the TMJ, a condylectomy with immediate replacement by a total joint prosthesis was performed via a preauricular approach. Corresponding to the clinically and radiologically suspected diagnosis, the decalcified histological specimen presented as a metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma within the intracapsular region.\nThe healing period of the implanted modified Quinn prosthesis was fast and uncomplicated after resection of this, to our knowledge, first documented metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma of the intracapsular region. After early restoration of joint function and patient satisfaction, the required radiochemotherapy of further unresectable bony metastases could be started in time.\nThis example of an extremely rare case of a metastasis shows that such a total joint prosthesis appears to be a very good alternative to extended autogenous reconstruction or an unsatisfactory primary resection.

{"title": "The rational phase of therapeutic angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Largely disappointing results from early clinical trials have settled down the initial unrealistic hope that fueled therapeutic angiogenesis. Now that this research has reached a rational phase, every concept in the theory of neo-vascularization needs to be re-evaluated. Neo-vascularization in adult tissues has been described as the result of either arteriogenesis, angiogenesis or vasculogenesis. The contribution of these mechanisms to neo-vascularization in vivo can likely not be separated experimentally. All currently known growth factors are pleiotropic and induce the secondary release of other growth factors. A complete analysis of the efficacy of growth factors therefore should include parameters of arteriogenesis, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Current clinical studies have likely suffered from drug regimens with short exposure of a single growth factor. Although combinations of growth factors may be theoretically appealing to create robust sustained neo-vessels, preclinical and clinical study designs may become too complex. Instead, there is some evidence that prolonged exposure to a single growth factor might result in vessels that are resistant to regression. With the vast and rapidly growing body of data that is being obtained on growth factors and pro-angiogenic strategies, approaches will emerge that are more effective than the ones presently tested in the clinic. It remains imperative however, that these approaches are rationally based on fundamental and preclinical data.", "journal": "Minerva cardioangiologica", "date": "2003-10-11", "authors": ["M JPost", "MSimons"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Tubes of vascularized cartilage used for replacement of rabbit cervical trachea.", "abstract": "This study was performed to evaluate the healing process of vascularized cartilage tubes after reconstruction of circumferential tracheal defects in rabbits. Vascularized cartilage was obtained by applying ear cartilage to a vascularized fascia flap in the lateral thoracic area in 10 animals. Five animals (control group) were used to evaluate the viability of the vascularized cartilage after 2 weeks. Circumferential tracheal defects were reconstructed in 5 animals by means of tubes of vascularized cartilage with preservation of the established blood supply around the grafts. The experimental animals were followed until signs of dyspnea became apparent. After follow-up and euthanasia, cartilage viability and regeneration of respiratory epithelium were evaluated. A viable plate of cartilage that was intensely attached to the vascularized fascia flap was found in the control animals. The animals from the experimental group showed dyspnea after a mean follow-up period of 22.6 days because of cartilage necrosis with loss of airway support. Cartilage graft revascularization and remucosalization were limited to 18.1% of the initial surface area of the cartilage tube. Mucosal coverage was seen at the anastomoses, whereas the middle part of the cartilage tube underwent necrosis. We conclude that tubes of autologous cartilage show problematic healing when placed inside the airway. Migration of vascularized connective tissue, migration of respiratory epithelium, and preservation of the viability of the cartilaginous graft were limited to a short segment at the anastomotic sites.", "journal": "The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology", "date": "2003-10-11", "authors": ["Pierre RDelaere", "JoseHardillo"], "doi": "10.1177/000348940311200911"}

All women underwent a transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonographic exam. A study of the arterial vascular flow was made in all tumor areas, as well as an impedance evaluation of arterial vascular flow using the resistance index.\nLocalization of the vessels in the tumor revealed a greater proportion of malignant tumors with detectable internal vascular flows (64%) than benign tumors with such flows (22%). There was a considerable overlap of these findings. The use of contrast identified a greater number of vessels with confirmation in the totality of tumors, but did not improve the Doppler capacity in tumoral differentiation. Malignant tumors presented lower values of resistance index than the benign ones, whether or not contrast was used. The cutoff value for resistance index that better maximized the Doppler sensitivity and specificity was 0.55. Through this value, an increase of the sensitivity after contrast use was obtained, varying from 47% to 82%, while specificity remained statistically unchanged.\nAlthough the injection of a microbubble agent improved the sensitivity of the method detecting vascularization of tumors, a positive finding for vascularization by this method was not clinically useful in the differentiation of benign and malignant ovarian tumors.", "journal": "Revista do Hospital das Clinicas", "date": "2003-10-10", "authors": ["Eduardo CardosoBlanco", "Ayrton RobertoPastore", "Angela Maggio daFonseca", "Filomena MarinoCarvalho", "Jesus PaulaCarvalho", "Jos\u00e9 AristodemoPinotti"], "doi": "10.1590/s0041-87812003000400001"}

Finally the biocompatibility of the collagen-chitosan (10 wt% chitosan) scaffold treated with different cross-linking methods was evaluated using a in vivo animal test. A mild inflammatory reaction could be detected in the early stages, and GA treatment can decrease the inflammatory reaction in a long-term implantation. After implantation for four weeks, all kinds of scaffolds, especially the GA-treated scaffolds (Col-GA) were filled with a large number of fibroblasts and were vascularized to a certain extent.

{"title": "Invasion as limitation to anti-angiogenic glioma therapy.", "abstract": "The inhibition of tumor angiogenesis could be an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Prominent neovascularization is induced by these tumors, and microvascular proliferation is a malignancy grading criterion. However, glioma cells can also invade the brain diffusely over long distances without necessarily requiring angiogenesis. Experimentally, it was shown that especially during early stages of growth in rodent brain, glioma cells can coopt the preexistent host vasculature to recruit their blood supply in the absence of neovascularization. This phenomenon was only observed in orthotopic models in which the tumor cells were implanted into the brain which is a densely vascularized environment, but not in subcutaneous models in which tumor cells are implanted into a virtual space. Using an orthotopic mouse model, we analyzed whether systemic anti-angiogenic therapy with an antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) could inhibit intracerebral growth of xenografted human glioblastoma cells and what effect this treatment had on tumor morphology and invasiveness. We found that anti-angiogenic therapy inhibited tumor growth by 80% compared to buffer-treated controls. The intratumoral microvessel density was reduced by at least 40% in treated animals compared to controls. However, in mice treated with the anti-VEGFR-2 antibody, we noticed a striking increase in the number and total area of small satellite tumors clustered around the primary mass. These satellites usually contained central vessel cores, and tumor cells often had migrated along blood vessels over long distances to eventually reach the surface and spread in the subarachnoid space. Systemic anti-angiogenic therapy can thus apparently increase the invasiveness of gliomas in the orthotopic model. Tumor cell invasion was tightly associated with preexistent blood vessels, suggesting that increased cooption of the host vasculature could represent a compensatory mechanism that is selected for by inhibiting adequate tumor vascularization.", "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica.

It is not known whether DC exert their tolerogenic function in recipient lymphoid tissue, and whether they process shed alloantigen in the graft itself. To answer this question we created a chimeric heart model deprived of its own DC and repopulated by recipient DC. The rationale for this model was to observe whether recipient DC located in the graft attenuate recruitment and stimulation of recipient lymphocytes, subsequently prolonging graft survival. Vascularized bone marrow transplants (VBMTx) from the prospective recipient to the lethally irradiated heart donor, which function for a period of 14 days, were used to replace donor DC with prospective recipient DC. Hearts from chimeric LEW rats (with BN DC) were transplanted to untreated BN rats. Also, hearts from chimeric LEW rats (with BN DC) were returned to untreated LEW rats. Replacement of the donor heart with recipient DC did not prolong graft survival. Rather, it initiated a rejection reaction that was already present in the donor.

{"title": "The tissue engineeting puzzle: a molecular perspective.", "abstract": "The inability of biomaterial scaffolds to functionally integrate into surrounding tissue is one of the major roadblocks to developing new biomaterials and tissue-engineering scaffolds. Despite considerable advances, current approaches to engineering cell-surface interactions fall short in mimicking the complexity of signals through which surrounding tissue regulates cell behavior. Cells adhere and interact with their extracellular environment via integrins, and their ability to activate associated downstream signaling pathways depends on the character of adhesion complexes formed between cells and their extracellular matrix. In particular, alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3 integrins are central to regulating downstream events, including cell survival and cell-cycle progression. In contrast to previous findings that alphavbeta3 integrins promote angiogenesis, recent evidence argues that alphavbeta3 integrins may act as negative regulators of proangiogenic integrins such as alpha5beta1. This suggests that fibronectin is critical for scaffold vascularization because it is the only mammalian adhesion protein that binds and activates alpha5beta1 integrins. Cells are furthermore capable of stretching fibronectin matrices such that the protein partially unfolds, and recent computational simulations provide structural models of how mechanical stretching affects fibronectin function. We propose a model whereby excessive tension generated by cells in contact to biomaterials may in fact render fibronectin fibrils nonangiogenic and potentially inhibit vascularization. The model could explain why current biomaterials independent of their surface chemistries and textures fail to vascularize.", "journal": "Annual review of biomedical engineering", "date": "2003-10-07", "authors": ["ViolaVogel", "GretchenBaneyx"], "doi": "10.1146/annurev.bioeng.5.040202.121615"}

HIFU can deliver large amounts of thermal energy by using ultrasonic waves to induce tissue necrosis, without damaging intervening tissues. In contrast to diagnostic ultrasound where intensity levels are below 0.1 W/cm(2), HIFU can deliver 1,000 to 10,000 W/cm(2) at the focal spot.\nA protocol for HIFU-induced tissue coagulation in the fetus was developed in the ovine model. The fetal liver, lung, kidney, muscle, and placenta were targets for ultrasound-guided tissue ablation by a HIFU beam. All lesions were assessed macroscopically and by histologic analysis.\nIn all animals, a necrotic lesion, similar in size to the HIFU focus (approximately 1x9 mm), was achieved. The fetal heart rate remained stable immediately after the procedure.\nIn conclusion, HIFU ablation seems to be an effective means to coagulate even highly vascularized tissues in the fetus.

{"title": "Vascularization, high-volume solution flow, and localized roles for enzymes of sucrose metabolism during tumorigenesis by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.", "abstract": "Vascular differentiation and epidermal disruption are associated with establishment of tumors induced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Here, we address the relationship of these processes to the redirection of nutrient-bearing water flow and carbohydrate delivery for tumor growth within the castor bean (Ricinus communis) host. Treatment with aminoethoxyvinyl-glycine showed that vascular differentiation and epidermal disruption were central to ethylene-dependent tumor establishment. CO2 release paralleled tumor growth, but water flow increased dramatically during the first 3 weeks. However, tumor water loss contributed little to water flow to host shoots. Tumor water loss was followed by accumulation of the osmoprotectants, sucrose (Suc) and proline, in the tumor periphery, shifting hexose-to-Suc balance in favor of sugar signals for maturation and desiccation tolerance. Concurrent activities and sites of action for enzymes of Suc metabolism changed: Vacuolar invertase predominated during initial import of Suc into the symplastic continuum, corresponding to hexose concentrations in expanding tumors. Later, Suc synthase (SuSy) and cell wall invertase rose in the tumor periphery to modulate both Suc accumulation and descending turgor for import by metabolization. Sites of abscisic acid immunolocalization correlated with both central vacuolar invertase and peripheral cell wall invertase. Vascular roles were indicated by SuSy immunolocalization in xylem parenchyma for inorganic nutrient uptake and in phloem, where resolution allowed SuSy identification in sieve elements and companion cells, which has widespread implications for SuSy function in transport. Together, data indicate key roles for ethylene-dependent vascularization and cuticular disruption in the redirection of water flow and carbohydrate transport for successful tumor establishment.", "journal": "Plant physiology", "date": "2003-10-04", "authors": ["RebeccaW\u00e4chter", "MarkusLanghans", "RoniAloni", "SimoneG\u00f6tz", "AnkeWeilm\u00fcnster", "ArianeKoops", "LeopoldineTemguia", "IgorMistrik", "JanPavlovkin", "UweRascher", "KatjaSchwalm", "Karen EKoch", "Cornelia IUllrich"], "doi": "10.1104/pp.103.028142"}
{"title": "Flavonoid-related regulation of auxin accumulation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced plant tumors.", "abstract": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced plant tumors accumulate considerable concentrations of free auxin. To determine possible mechanisms by which high auxin concentrations are maintained, we examined the pattern of auxin and flavonoid distribution in plant tumors. Tumors were induced in transformants of Trifolium repens (L.), containing the beta-glucuronidase ( GUS)-fused auxin-responsive promoter ( GH3) or chalcone synthase ( CHS2) genes, and in transformants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., containing the GUS-fused synthetic auxin response element DR5. Expression of GH3::GUS and DR5::GUS was strong in proliferating metabolically active tumors, thus suggesting high free-auxin concentrations. Immunolocalization of total auxin with indole-3-acetic acid antibodies was consistent with GH3::GUS expression indicating the highest auxin concentration in the tumor periphery. By in situ staining with diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester, by thin-layer chromatography, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and two-photon laser-scanning microscopy spectrometry, tumor-specific flavones, isoflavones and pterocarpans were detected, namely 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), formononetin, and medicarpin. DHF was the dominant flavone in high free-auxin-accumulating stipules of Arabidopsis leaf primordia. Flavonoids were localized at the sites of strongest auxin-inducible CHS2::GUS expression in the tumor that was differentially modulated by auxin in the vascular tissue. CHS mRNA expression changes corresponded to the previously analyzed auxin concentration profile in tumors and roots of tumorized Ricinus plants. Application of DHF to stems, apically pretreated with alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid, inhibited GH3::GUS expression in a fashion similar to 1-N-naphthyl-phthalamic acid. Tumor, root and shoot growth was poor in inoculated tt4(85) flavonoid-deficient CHS mutants of Arabidopsis. It is concluded that CHS-dependent flavonoid aglycones are possibly endogenous regulators of the basipetal auxin flux, thereby leading to free-auxin accumulation in A. tumefaciens-induced tumors. This, in turn, triggers vigorous proliferation and vascularization of the tumor tissues and suppresses their further differentiation.", "journal": "Planta", "date": "2003-10-03", "authors": ["KatjaSchwalm", "RoniAloni", "MarkusLanghans", "WernerHeller", "SusanneStich", "Cornelia IUllrich"], "doi": "10.1007/s00425-003-1104-6"}

{"title": "Microvascular mechanisms by which the combretastatin A-4 derivative AC7700 (AVE8062) induces tumour blood flow stasis.", "abstract": "We previously reported that a novel combretastatin A-4 derivative, AC7700, has remarkable antitumour effects because of an irreversible stasis of tumour blood flow (TBF) and subsequent loss of nutrient supply to tumour tissue. Since early 2002, under the new designation AVE8062, AC7700 has undergone clinical trials in Europe and the US. Questions remain, however, concerning how AC7700 blocks TBF and why the TBF stasis does not recover. In this study, using a rat tumour LY80, a variant of Yoshida sarcoma, we examined whether TBF cessation after AC7700 administration is due to a direct action of the agent on tumour blood vessels. We constructed electrodes that can drop a small quantity of the drug solution directly at the site of blood flow measurement and inserted them subcutaneously and into the tumour. We compared the blood flow responses of normal vessels and tumour vessels after administration of 10-microl doses of various concentrations (0.2, 1, 10, and 50 mg ml(-1)) of the AC7700 solution. In addition, we assessed TBF stasis after i.v. and intra-arterial 10 mg x kg(-1) AC7700 administration in an LY80-induced kidney tumour. To determine why the TBF stasis is irreversible, we observed AC7700-induced changes in host arterioles and the tumour vascular network of the Sato lung carcinoma using a vital microscopic rat transparent chamber. Since an increase in tumour interstitial fluid pressure brings about a decrease in TBF, we also measured 10 mg x kg(-1) AC7700-induced changes in this pressure. The sensitivity of the blood flow response after intratumoral application of AC7700 was markedly higher in normal vessels relative to tumour vessels. Intra-arterial administration of AC7700 did not have stronger effects on TBF stasis than did i.v. administration. Intravital microscopy showed that AC7700 induced a powerful and long-lasting constriction of host arterioles, so that complete stasis of blood flow occurred in downstream vessels, which supplied blood to tumours. Owing to this stasis, the lumens of numerous tumour vessels narrowed or completely disappeared, and numerous erythrocytes stagnated in drainage vessels of the tumour vascular network. Haemolysis of these erythrocytes occurred after 2-3 h, resulting in complete thrombosis. There was no indication of reperfusion in vessels showing haemolysis. This haemolysis is thought to be the main cause for the irreversibility of TBF stasis. Since the tumour interstitial fluid pressure decreased after i.v. AC7700 administration, the possibility of stasis of TBF being caused by tumour vascular compression was excluded. All these results strongly suggest that the main target of AC7700 is host arterioles and that the stasis of TBF induced by AC7700 is not triggered by a direct action of the drug on tumour vessels.", "journal": "British journal of cancer", "date": "2003-10-02", "authors": ["KHori", "SSaito"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.bjc.6601261"}

However, it is difficult to apply collagen matrix to pressure ulcers, because they are usually accompanied by infection with discharge of excessive amounts of exudate or pus and generally exposed to external forces that prevent graft fixation. To overcome these difficulties, the authors demonstrated a novel procedure to exclude unfavorable exudate and external forces. The procedure resulted in successful fixation of the artificial dermis and induction of regeneration in poorly vascularized defects in every case. The histologic findings provided supporting evidence that collagen matrix acts as a scaffold for reconstruction of nearly normal vascular structures coursing perpendicularly in the upper layer of normal dermis.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2003-10-02", "authors": ["ShigeruIchioka", "NorihikoOhura", "NaomiSekiya", "MasahiroShibata", "TakashiNakatsuka"], "doi": "10.1097/01.SAP.0000067971.90978.8F"}

{"title": "The vascular network of tumours--what is it not for?", "abstract": "It is becoming almost a dogma that tumours cannot grow beyond 1-2 mm(3) unless they are supported by a rich vascular supply 1. It is true that tumours promote angiogenesis and that highly vascularized carcinomas have, in general, a more aggressive clinical course than carcinomas of low vascularization 23. However, a study of intratumoral angiogenesis reveals that the newly formed vessels are commonly deprived of those structural qualities that would allow them to perform an optimal oxygenation function 3. Thus, most tumours, irrespective of their angiogenic status, behave as if they were 'hypoxic', urging (via angiogenic mediators) for, what would look paradoxical at first sight, more defective angiogenesis. It is hypothesized that tumour cells can grow into solid neoplasms by exploiting the host's pre-existing vessels, without the need for new blood vessel formation. Neovascularization, however, may be important for tumours with an exophytic pattern of growth as these, by their very nature, lose the host's sheltering stroma. Shifting to anaerobic glycolysis and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways are complementary mechanisms for tumour cell survival and growth. Besides, continuous and indiscriminate production of a defective vascular network ensures an increased metastatic potential since the newly formed intratumoral vessels, simulating venular-like spaces, are easily permeable to tumour cells, facilitating metastases.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2003-10-01", "authors": ["EfthimiosSivridis", "AlexandraGiatromanolaki", "Michael IKoukourakis"], "doi": "10.1002/path.1355"}

{"title": "Effects of steroidal and non steroidal drugs on the neovascularization response induced by tumoral TA3 supernatant on CAM from chick embryo.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels from the existing vascular network, may result as a consequence of the increase or decrease of proangiogenic or antiangiogenic factors, respectively. The tumor itself could up-regulate the production of angiogenic factors. Recently, we established that the steroidal drug betamethasone in low concentration inhibit the neovascularization promoted by TA3 Ts on CAM of chick embryos. We describe here the effects of the non-steroidal drug ketoprofen, alone or in association with betamethasone, on the angiogenesis promoted by TA3 Ts on CAM. The main finding reported here is that the formation of new blood vessels is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of ketoprofen. The association of both drugs produced a synergistic effect, significantly decreasing tumoral supernatant angiogenesis. It is known that steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the enzymes required for the production of prostaglandins through a nuclear GR mediated mechanism. This may operate as a general mechanism in endothelial cells as well. Considering that the induction of COX 1 and COX2 are inhibited by ketoprofen, and that these enzymes are located in the stromal compartment of the CAM, we propose that its antiangiogenic effect may occur via inhibition of the two COX isoforms. In fact, we found that ketoprofen induced apoptosis in both the stromal fibroblast and endothelial cells. The potentiated effect of the combination of betamethasone and ketoprofen may have some therapeutic projections in the control of pathological angiogenesis.", "journal": "Biological research", "date": "2003-09-30", "authors": ["JorgeZ\u00fa\u00f1iga", "MarcelaFuenzalida", "An\u00edbalGuerrero", "JulioIllanes", "AlfredoDabancens", "EugeniaD\u00edaz", "DavidLemus"], "doi": "10.4067/s0716-97602003000200013"}

It is readily recognized by the intracellular accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) and HIF2alpha. Accumulation of HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha was detected immunohistochemically in a series of 46 nodular malignant melanomas of the skin (epithelioid cell variant), treated with wide local excision. The results were correlated with vascular density (VD) and expression of the angiogenesis-stimulating factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP). Further associations were sought with patient prognosis and the important histopathological features of Breslow's thickness, Clark's level of invasion, mitotic rate, inflammatory cell infiltrates and tumour ulceration. HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha accumulation in malignant melanomas was directly correlated with VEGF expression. Tumours with high VEGF or HIF2alpha expression were associated with a poorer prognosis on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Tumours displaying high VD were also associated with a poor prognosis, but only on univariate analysis. Such vascularized malignant melanomas had only a limited inflammatory cell response. TP and VEGF were frequently co-expressed. The value of Breslow's thickness and Clark's level in prognosis was reaffirmed, although only on univariate analysis. Overexpression of the transcription factors HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha are linked to VEGF expression in nodular malignant melanomas. Loss of immune surveillance, as indicated by a limited inflammatory cell response, was also associated with high angiogenic activity.

To identify a capillary sprout-specific endothelial phenotype, we labeled angiogenic rat mesentery tissue using a microvessel and capillary sprout marker (laminin), selected endothelial cell markers (CD31, tie-2, and BS-I lectin), and the OX-43 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a 90-kDa membrane glycoprotein of unknown function. In tissues that were stimulated through wound healing and compound 48/80 application, double-immunolabeling experiments with an anti-laminin antibody revealed that the OX-43 antigen was expressed strongly in all microvessels. However, the OX-43 antigen was completely absent from a large percentage (>85%) of the capillary sprouts that were invading the avascular tissue space. In contrast, sprouts that were introverting back into the previously vascularized tissue retained high levels of OX-43 antigen expression. Double-labeling experiments with endothelial markers indicated that the OX-43 antigen was expressed by microvessel endothelium but was absent from virtually all invasive capillary sprout endothelial cells. We conclude that the absence of OX-43 antigen expression marks a novel, capillary sprout-specific, endothelial cell phenotype.

The objective of the second part of the study was to evaluate and to compare tissue engineered cell-polymer constructs using calvarial osteoblasts (group I) and mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs; group II) for the reconstruction of critical-size and three-dimensionally complex cranial defects. In 30 New Zealand White rabbits, bilateral parietal critical-size defects were created. On the basis of computed tomography scans, customized PCL scaffolds with precisely controlled microarchitecture were fabricated, using a rapid prototyping technology. Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells and osteoblasts were isolated and expanded in culture. Osteoblasts (group I) and mesenchymal progenitor cells (group II) were seeded in combination with a fibrin glue suspension into 40 PCL scaffolds. After incubating for 3 days in static culture, the PCL scaffold-cell constructs as well as nonseeded PCL scaffolds (control group) were implanted into 15-mm-diameter calvarial defects. Reconstruction of the cranium and bone formation were evaluated after 3 months. In vivo results indicated osseous tissue integration within the implant and functionally stable restoration of the calvarium. Islands of early bone formation could be observed in X-ray radiographs and in histological sections. Implants showed a high cell:ECM ratio and a dense vascular network. Mechanical testing of the reconstructed area revealed partial integration with the surrounding corticocancellous calvarial bone. The amount (area) of calcification, measured by clinical computed tomography, indicated that cell-seeded constructs measured about 60% more than unrepaired or unseeded scaffolds. Mechanical investigations revealed that stiffness reached 52 +/- 29 and 44 +/- 16 MPa for MPC- and osteoblast-seeded scaffolds, respectively. The yield strength for the push-out tests was 180 +/- 36 N for normal calvarial bone, 90 +/- 1 N for unrepaired site, and 106 +/- 10 N for unseeded constructs, which is about 60% of normal bone strength. MPC- and osteoblast-seeded scaffolds indicated a yield strength of 149 +/- 15 and 164 +/- 42 N, respectively, which is about 85-90% of normal bone.

After tumor areas reached 1 cm2, the animals received a single fraction of 18-Gy radiation or intraperitoneal saline injection.

The reliance on long-term immunosuppression has prompted this study to achieve donor-specific transplantation tolerance in adult recipients using a nontoxic, nonmyeloablative protocol.\nFully mismatched, 4- to 6-week-old ACI (RT1Aa) and Wistar Furth (WF) rats were used as donors and recipients, respectively. Recipients were administered CTLA4-Ig at 2 mg/kg per day (alternate days) in combination with tacrolimus at 1 mg/kg per day (daily) from day 0 through day +10, antilymphocyte serum at 10 mg at day +10 (single dose), and total-body irradiation t 300 cGy (day 0) before bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) (day 0) with 100 x 10(6) T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells. Hindlimb transplants were performed 4 weeks postBMT. Multilineage donor hematopoiesis was determined pre- and posttransplant using flow cytometry. In vitro T-cell responses were evaluated by mixed lymphocyte reactivity assays.\nCD28 blockade in a transplant model of mixed chimerism effectively aborts T-cell clonal expansion in vitro and in vivo, inhibits the development of acute and chronic rejection of vascularized hindlimb allografts in rats (ACI limbs to ACI-->WF chimeras, n=5; WF limbs to ACI-->WF chimeras, n=4), and subsequently leads to long-term survival of allogeneic skin grafts (n=9).

Our demonstration that tolerance can be achieved with minimal preconditioning provides a rationale for application to large animals and humans and suggests that although composite tissue allografts may have a significant skin component (and are therefore felt to be highly antigenic), protocols used to induce tolerance to organ transplants may be equally applicable to composite-tissue allotransplantation.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2003-09-26", "authors": ["Robert DFoster", "SiPham", "SenLi", "AbdelouahabAitouche"], "doi": "10.1097/01.TP.0000079827.91675.A3"}

In the light of the fact that the angiogenic effect of VEGF is mediated by sustained formation of nitric oxide, the samples were also immunostained with 3 nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS) antibodies. The immunohistochemical findings of VEGF and its receptors were verified by immunoblotting techniques. Vascular density was highest in the cases with moderate valve stenosis, and the mean number of FVIII-positive blood vessels was 1.7 +/- 1.9 vessels/mm(2) in the diseased valves, whereas the normal valves contained no blood vessels. Vascular density was significantly higher in the cases showing chronic inflammation (P = 0.007). Interestingly, the patients receiving statin therapy had significantly lower vascular densities than those not receiving such therapy (P = 0.001). Diseased valves showed distinct VEGF, Flt-1, Flk-1, and eNOS positivity of activated endothelial, stromal fusiform myofibroblastic, and histocytic cells. In contrast, immunoreactivity for iNOS and nNOS was seen only in nonendothelial stromal cells, and their expression was weaker. Enhanced vascular density was significantly associated with increased expression of Flk-1 (P = 0.028 for endothelial and P = 0.009 for stromal cells) and with endothelial eNOS expression (P = 0.024).

A constant perineural vascularization of the terminal branch of the DBUN was observed in the fourth web space, connected distally with the corresponding dorsal metacarpal or palmar digital arteries. Our findings therefore provide anatomical bases for a new neurocutaneous island flap. Moreover, they allow us to describe a precise surgical technique in order to raise this flap over the larger branch of the DBUN, in the fourth intermetacarpal space. The flap is harvested on the medial aspect of the dorsum of the hand, and its point of rotation is located in the fourth web space, 1 cm proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Anatomical references concerning the thalamic arterial groups are contradictory and complex, preventing any solid application in practice. It is, therefore, difficult to produce reliable anatomical radio-clinical correlation. In this work, 12 adult human cerebellums (24 hemispheres) were dissected after intra-vascular injection. With care for clarification and standardization, the extra-parenchymal thalamic arteries were classified in six groups: pre-mamillary artery, perforating thalamic arteries, thalamo-geniculate arteries, perforating branches of the postero-medial, postero-lateral and anterior choroidal arteries. Variations in the pre-mamillary artery were rare. The origin of the perforating thalamic artery was unilateral in two of three cases. The origin of the thalamo-geniculate arteries arose between the posterior cerebral artery (53%) and the posterior choroidal arteries (43%). The postero-median choroidal artery was most often single and usually gave the perforating branches for the medial aspect of the thalamus. The postero-lateral choroidal artery was frequently multiple and essentially gave the perforating branches for the superior aspect of the thalamus. The pulvinarian branches most often rose from the postero-lateral choroidal arteries (two thirds of cases) and more rarely from the postero-median choroidal arteries (one third of cases). The anterior choroidal artery is a source of thalamic vascularization by its cisternal branches running towards the lateral thalamus. It can also participate in the vascularization of the pulvinar by the plexiform branches crossing the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle.

Gliomas, the most common brain tumours, are particularly highly vascularized and, therefore, serve as a model to elucidate the process of tumour angiogenesis and to investigate new anti-angiogenic therapies. This review describes the role of angiogenic factors in glioma angiogenesis and new strategies to inhibit glioma growth by application of anti-angiogenic substances. We focus on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), but also examine the role of angiopoietin and pleiotropic factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), pleiotrophin and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Strategies to inhibit glioma growth by reducing the action of angiogenic factors, by the application of anti-angiogenic substances such as angiostatin or endostatin, or inactivation of endothelial cells, are discussed. These new anti-angiogenic therapies appear to have a high potential not only for the treatment of gliomas, but also of other tumours.", "journal": "Die Naturwissenschaften", "date": "2003-09-25", "authors": ["RolfMentlein", "JankaHeld-Feindt"], "doi": "10.1007/s00114-003-0449-9"}
{"title": "A new composite facial and scalp transplantation model in rats.", "abstract": "There are limited sources of autogenous tissue available for reconstruction of severe facial and scalp deformities caused by extensive tumor ablation, burns, or trauma. Allografts from cadaveric sources may serve as a reconstructive alternative. However, technical and immunological aspects of harvesting and transplanting face and scalp flaps limit the routine use of such procedures. For evaluation of the feasibility of composite-tissue reconstruction, an experimental model of composite face/scalp flap transplantation in rats was designed. Technical aspects of the model, survival rates, and the complications encountered during development of the model are presented. A total of 64 animals, in three experimental groups, were studied. In group I, the anatomical study group (n = 6), the anatomical features of the face and scalp region in rats were explored. Groups II and III were the transplantation groups. Isograft transplantations were performed between identical Lewis rats (RT11 to RT11), and allografts were transplanted, across major histocompatibility complex barriers, between Lewis-Brown Norway rats (RT1l/n) and Lewis rats (RT11). In group II (the control group, n = 8), transplantation of nonvascularized composite face/scalp isografts and allografts was performed. In group III (the transplantation group, n = 50), vascularized face/scalp isografts (n = 36) and allografts (n = 14) were transplanted. Complications included partial or total flap necrosis, death attributable to food aspiration, and poor general condition. To prevent acute and chronic allograft rejection, cyclosporine A (16 mg/kg per day) therapy was initiated 24 hours after transplantation; the dose was tapered to 2 mg/kg per day within 4 weeks and was maintained at that level thereafter. Long-term survival (>170 days) was achieved, without any signs of rejection, with low-dose (2 mg/kg per day) cyclosporine A therapy.

Interest is great in attempting to speed re-epithelialization and healing so that patients can return to their normal activities as quickly as possible. Previous studies have demonstrated that wounds heal more quickly when they are covered and kept moist than when they are left open to the air. Until now, no study has been conducted to investigate whether the healing process of a superficial skin burn might be accelerated by the use of an autologous platelet gel as a biologic dressing. Our study of five pigs showed that autologous platelet gel can influence wound healing by stimulating an intense inflammatory process that leads to highly significant increases in the production of extracellular matrices and granulation tissue. The platelet gel accelerated vascular ingrowth, increased fibroblastic proliferation, and accelerated collagen production. However, the gel did not appear to accelerate re-epithelialization. The aggressive production of granulation tissue and the acceleration of collagen production might mean that autologous platelet gel will have a future role in the treatment of burns because the highly vascularized bed it helps create should promote the success of skin grafting in patients with deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns.", "journal": "Ear, nose, & throat journal", "date": "2003-09-25", "authors": ["Jenifer LHenderson", "Craig LCupp", "E VictorRoss", "Paul CShick", "Michael AKeefe", "Derin CWester", "TimothyHannon", "DevinMcConnell"], "doi": null}

Recent histopathological evidence showed a significant association between watershed cortical microinfarcts and AD indicating that cerebral hypoperfusion induces not only white matter damage, known as leuko-araiosis, but cortical border zone infarcts as well, further aggravating the degenerative process and worsening dementia. In late stages of Alzheimer's disease--in cases with neuropathologically confirmed definite AD--the occurrence of watershed cortical microinfarcts was ten times higher than in aged matched control cases. Congophilic angiopathy and perturbed hemodynamic factors were found to be important factors in the genesis of watershed microinfarcts. To consider the vulnerability of the cerebral blood flow and the perturbed cortical vascular network in AD is important.

The correction of such fistula is associated with a 10% to 40% failure rate. The key measure to ensure a successful repair is separation of the suture lines in the urethra and skin, using well vascularized elastic tissue. If the dartos fascia is unavailable and local penile skin is fibrotic as a result of previous operations, a tunica vaginalis flap may be considered. We report our experience with tunica vaginalis flap as an adjunct to fistula repair.\nWe used tunica vaginalis flap for the repair of recurrent urethrocutaneous fistulas in 14 children with a mean age of 7.6 years (range 3 to 15). All patients had undergone previous hypospadias repairs and previous attempts to close the fistula had failed. The mean number of fistulas per patient was 1.6 (range 1 to 4), and the locations were perineal (1), penoscrotal (3), midshaft (10), and subcoronal (8). The mean number of failed previous closures with local penile skin flaps was 2.4 (range 1 to 5). Surgery was initiated by injecting povidone solution via the urethral meatus to identify all fistulas. Calibration or cystoscopy excluded distal urethral strictures. Surgery was performed using a microscope and fistulas were closed primarily in 12 patients and with an onlay island flap in 2. The urethral suture line was covered with a flap of tunica vaginalis, which was harvested through a small scrotal incision and mobilized via a subcutaneous tunnel into the penis. The testis was then fixed to the scrotum. A urethral stent with or without suprapubic catheter drainage provided urinary diversion for 2 to 7 days.\nThe repair was successful in all patients. During a mean followup of 44 months (range 8 to 60) there was no evidence of recurrent fistulas or urethral strictures. Penile cosmesis was excellent, and all parents reported a straight penis when erected. No postoperative complications were encountered in the testicles.\nRepair of recurrent urethrocutaneous fistulas with a tunica vaginalis flap is highly effective regardless of fistula location.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene products negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. We found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is secreted by Tsc1- or Tsc2-null fibroblasts at high levels compared with wild-type cells. In Tsc1+/- mice, serum levels of VEGF were increased and appeared to be associated with the extent of tumor development. Rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, reduced the production of VEGF by Tsc1- and Tsc2-null fibroblasts to normal levels. Moreover, short-term treatment of Tsc1+/- mice with rapamycin at 20 mg/kg led to some changes in tumor morphology and a reduction in serum VEGF levels. These observations have three implications. First, TSC gene products regulate VEGF production through a mTOR signaling pathway. Second, serum VEGF levels may be a useful clinical biomarker to monitor the progression of TSC-associated lesions.

To determine whether the decreased motility we observed in vitro in c-Cbl(-/-) OCs translated into decreased cell migration in vivo, we analyzed the long bones of c-Cbl(-/-) mice during development. Initiation of vascularization and replacement of cartilage by bone were delayed in c-Cbl(-/-) mice, due to decreased osteoclast invasion of the hypertrophic cartilage through the bone collar. Furthermore, c-Cbl(-/-) mice show a delay in the formation of secondary centers of ossification, a thicker hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, and a prolonged presence of cartilaginous remnants in the spongiosa, confirming a decrease in resorption of the calcified cartilage. Thus, the decrease in motility of c-Cbl(-/-) osteoclasts observed in vitro results in a decreased ability of osteoclasts to invade and resorb bone and mineralized cartilage in vivo. These results confirm that c-Cbl plays an important role in osteoclast motility and resorbing activity.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2003-09-23", "authors": ["RiccardoChiusaroli", "ArchanaSanjay", "KimHenriksen", "Michael TEngsig", "William CHorne", "HuaGu", "RolandBaron"], "doi": "10.1016/s0012-1606(03)00299-9"}

Fetal and placental development was investigated at Day 50, during placentome formation; at Day 100, when placentation was completed; and at Day 150, when the hydrops syndrome frequently develops. The NT fetuses were compared with contemporary half-siblings generated from in vitro-produced embryos or by artificial insemination (AI). Fetal cotyledon formation and vascularization of the chorioallantoic membranes was initiated normally in NT conceptuses, but fewer cotyledons successfully formed placentomes. By Day 100, the mean number of placentomes was significantly lower in surviving NT fetuses. Only those with normal placentome numbers were represented in surviving NT pregnancies at Day 150. The mean total caruncle tissue weight of the placentomes was significantly higher in the surviving NT groups at Days 100 and 150, irrespective of the placentome numbers, indicating that increased NT placental weight was caused by excessive uterine tissue growth. By Day 100, NT fetuses exhibited growth deregulation, and those that survived to Day 150 were 17% heavier than contemporary AI controls. Placentome, liver, and kidney overgrowth accompanied the hydrops syndrome at Day 150. The NT fetal overgrowth was not a consequence of in vitro embryo culture and showed no correlation with placental overgrowth.

In this study, the ability of tissue-engineered cartilage constructs to support bone formation under controlled mechanical loading conditions was evaluated using a lapine hydraulic bone chamber model. Articular chondrocytes were seeded onto polymer disks, cultured for 4 weeks in vitro, and then transferred to empty bone chambers previously implanted into rabbit femoral metaphyses. The effects of chondrocyte viability within the implanted constructs and in vivo mechanical loading on bone formation were tested in separate experiments. After 4 weeks in vivo, biopsies from the chambers consisted of a complex composite of bone, cartilage, and fibrous tissue, with bone forming in direct apposition to the cartilage constructs. Microcomputed tomography imaging of the chamber biopsies revealed that the implantation of viable constructs nearly doubled the bone volume fraction of the chamber tissue from 0.9 to 1.6% as compared with the implantation of devitalized constructs in contralateral control chambers. The application of an intermittent cyclic mechanical load was found to increase the bone volume fraction of the chamber tissue from 0.4 to 3.6% as compared with no-load control biopsies.

We introduce a novel technique for restoration of such defects.\nThe blood supply to the thyroid gland by way of the inferior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid artery and vein are mobilized for transfer. One half to two thirds of the circumference of the adjacent tracheal rings are mobilized on the basis of the requirements of the stenotic segment.

{"title": "Advances in head and neck reconstruction.", "abstract": "There are numerous advances that have taken place over the last several years in head and neck reconstruction. In this article, the author has outlined three exciting developments. The first is in the area of palatomaxillary reconstruction using free tissue transfer. In select cases, depending on the nature of the defect, soft tissue flaps have been highly successful. However, in more extensive defects, the author chooses to transfer vascularized bone composite flaps to achieve successful dental restoration as well as closure of the palatal defect. Sensory restoration through the use of sensate flaps has been a topic of considerable controversy. The author presents his experience with three patients who underwent a unique reconstruction of the laryngopharynx that has demonstrated conclusively that targeted sensory restoration can be achieved through neural anastomoses. By anastomosing the sensory nerve to the superior laryngeal nerve, there are implicit physiologic implications with respect to the feedback that is achieved and its role in achieving glottic closure during deglutition. Extensive laryngeal reconstruction with subglottic involvement can be a very challenging problem. The author describes a new technique using vascularized tracheal autografts with the thyroid gland as a carrier. This provides the necessary ingredients for transferring a cartilaginous infrastructure within a thin layer of vascularized mucosa to restore the framework and the lining to the laryngotracheal region. Three patients have been restored who had extensive glottic and subglottic stenoses that have since been decannulated and are successfully eating as well as speaking.

In this process, Rho GTPases-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics control cell movement and organization of cell-to-matrix and cell-to-cell contacts. Time course analysis of RhoA and Rac1 activation matches specific morphological aspects of nascent pattern. RhoA-GTP increases early during EC adhesion and accumulates at sites of membrane ruffling. Rac1 is activated later and localizes in lamellipodia and at cell-to-cell contacts of organized cell chains. When ECs stretch and remodel to form capillary structures, RhoA-GTP increases again and associates with stress fibers running along the major cell axis. N17Rac1 and N19RhoA mutants impair pattern formation. Cell-to-cell contacts and myosin light chains (MLC) are targets of Rac1 and RhoA, respectively. N17Rac1 reduces the shift of beta-catenin and vascular endothelial cadherin to Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and impairs beta-catenin distribution at adherens junctions, suggesting that Rac1 controls the dynamics of cadherin-catenin complex with F-actin. During the remodeling phase of network formation, ECs show an intense staining for phosphorylated MLC along the plasma membrane; in contrast, MLC is less phosphorylated and widely diffused in N19RhoA ECs. Both N17Rac1 and N19RhoA have been used to investigate the role of wild type molecules in the main steps characterizing in vitro angiogenesis: (i) cell adhesion to the substrate, (ii) cell movement, and (iii) mechanical remodeling of matrix.

{"title": "Paracrine control of vascularization and neurogenesis by neurotrophins.", "abstract": "The neuronal system plays a fundamental role in the maturation of primitive embryonic vascular network by providing a paracrine template for blood vessel branching and arterial differentiation. Furthermore, postnatal vascular and neural regeneration cooperate in the healing of damaged tissue. Neurogenesis continues in adulthood although confined to specific brain regions. Following ischaemic insult, neural staminal cells contribute towards the healing process through the stimulation of neurogenesis and vasculogenesis. Evidence indicates that nerves and blood vessels exert a reciprocal control of their own growth by paracrine mechanisms. For instance, guidance factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and semaphorins, which share the ability of binding neuropilin receptors, play a pivotal role in the tridimensional growth pattern of arterial vessels and nerves. Animal models and clinical studies have demonstrated a role of VEGF-A in the pathogenesis of ischaemic and diabetic neuropathies. Further, supplementation with VEGF-A ameliorates neuronal recovery by exerting protective effects on nerves and stimulating reparative neovascularization. Human tissue kallikrein, a recently discovered angiogenic and arteriogenic factor, accelerates neuronal recovery by stimulating the growth of vasa nervorum. Conversely, the neurotrophin nerve growth factor, known to regulate neuronal survival and differentiation, is now regarded as a stimulator of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. These results indicate that angiogenesis and neurogenesis are paracrinally regulated by growth factors released by endothelial cells and neurons. Supplementation of these growth factors, alone or in combination, could benefit the treatment of ischaemic diseases and neuropathies.", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "date": "2003-09-13", "authors": ["CostanzaEmanueli", "PeterSchratzberger", "RudolfKirchmair", "PaoloMadeddu"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.bjp.0705458"}
{"title": "Structure, lymphatic vascularization and lymphocyte migration in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.", "abstract": "In this review, we consider the morphological aspects and topographical arrangement of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) (solitary and aggregate lymph nodules or Peyer's patches) and of vermiform appendix in the human child and in some mammals. The spatial arrangement of the vessels belonging to apparatus lymphaticus periphericus absorbens (ALPA) and of blood vessels within each lymphoid follicle as well as the ultrastructural characteristics of the lymphatic endothelium with high absorption capacity are considered. Particular attention is also paid to the morphological and biomolecular mechanisms inducing lymphocyte transendothelial migration to the bloodstream by means of lymphatic vessels as well as their passage from blood into lymphoid tissue through the high endothelial venules (HEVs). The preferential transendothelial passage of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils within ALPA vessels of the interfollicular area does not occur following the opening of intercellular contacts, but rather it occurs by means of 'intraendothelial channels'. In HEVs, on the contrary, the hypothesis is plausible that lymphocyte transendothelial migration into lymphoid tissue occurs through a channel-shaped endothelial invagination entirely independent of interendothelial contacts. The lymph of ALPA vessels of the single Peyer's patch is conveyed into precollector lymphatic vessels and into prelymph nodal collectors, totally independent of the ALPA vessels of the gut segments devoid of lymphoid tissue. The quantitative distribution of T lymphocytes in the lymph of mucosal ALPA vessels suggests a prevalent function of fluid uptake, whereas a reservoir and supply function is implicated for the vessels of interfollicular area. The precollector lymphatic vessels and prelymph nodal collectors are considered to be vessels with low absorption capacity, whose main function is lymph conduction and flow.", "journal": "Immunological reviews", "date": "2003-09-13", "authors": ["GiacomoAzzali"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1600-065x.2003.00072.x"}

Increased levels of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, may be critically important in wear debris-induced implant loosening after total joint arthroplasty.\nPeriprosthetic osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty occurs in association with formation of a vascularized granulomatous tissue in response to particulate debris.\nThis study examined expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the VEGF receptor in 10 periprosthetic tissues from loosened prostheses and quantified effects of titanium particles on VEGF release, intracellular signaling, and VEGF-dependent chemotaxis in primary cultures of human monocyte/macrophages.\nDouble immunofluorescent staining showed that VEGF and Flt-1 co-localized with cells positive for the macrophage marker, CD11b, in the periprosthetic tissues. Monocyte/macrophages challenged with titanium particles showed a dose- and time-dependent release of VEGF ranging from 2.8- to 3.1-fold and exhibited increased expression of VEGF121 and VEGF165 mRNAs, reaching levels up to 5.0- and 8.6-fold, respectively, by 48 h (p < 0.01).

{"title": "Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in pregnancy.", "abstract": "An adequate nutrient and substrate supply is essential for normal intrauterine development of the fetus. Disturbances in uterine blood supply are associated with higher perinatal morbidity and mortality caused by preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction. Adaptation of the uterine vasculature to the rising needs of the fetus occurs through both vasodilation and development of new vessels. Angiogenesis is the process of neovascularization from pre-existing blood vessels in response to hypoxia or substrate demands of tissues. The endometrium, decidua and placenta are sources rich of angiogenic growth factors. In general, the angiogenic process is initiated by growth factors such as bFGF, VEGF, or placental growth factor (PlGF). Through a complex signal transduction machinery mediated by respective receptor-tyrosine kinases, an increase in the permeability of the maternal vessels is achieved to permit growth and invasion of endothelial cells. Their chemotactic migration, formation of a vessel lumen, and functional maturation of new capillaries complete the angiogenic process that involves the expression of specific adhesion receptors and extracellular matrix-degrading proteases. During vasculogenesis, endothelial progenitor cells--angioblasts--form a primitive vascular network. This process occurs mainly during fetal development, although recruitment of angioblasts from bone marrow and peripheral blood in response to ischemic insult have been described in adults. Our recent data indicate a novel function for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormonal factor of trophoblastic origin in uterine adaptation to early pregnancy as well as in tumor invasion and underline the importance of hCG as an yet unrecognized angiogenic factor. Although there are striking similarities between, on the one hand, tumor invasion and tumor-induced vascularization and, on the other hand, trophoblast invasion and placental development, our understanding of the different molecular and functional aspects of these two different processes, in particular, the self-limitation of the trophoblastic invasion and vessels formation during gestation might allow the establishment of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of both tumor and pregnancy related pathology.", "journal": "European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology", "date": "2003-09-11", "authors": ["MarekZygmunt", "FriederikeHerr", "KarstenM\u00fcnstedt", "UweLang", "Olin DLiang"], "doi": "10.1016/s0301-2115(03)00168-4"}

The expression of CTGF in retinal pigment epithelial and CEC cultures was determined by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, and its regulation by vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor beta was determined. The effects of CTGF on bovine CEC proliferation, attachment, migration, and tube formation were measured.\nVascularized human choroidal neovascular membranes showed strong CTGF immunoreactivity.

The significant changes that have occurred in the past few decades in relation to the evolution of techniques for safe and effective total thyroidectomy are then summarized. In the last 25 years total thyroidectomy has replaced bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy as the preferred option for the management of all patients with bilateral benign multinodular goitre, Graves' disease, and all but very low-risk thyroid cancer patients. The principal change in operative technique has been the move from 'lateral dissection' to 'capsular dissection'. Associated with that has been a focus on 'encountering' the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), recognizing sympathetic-laryngeal nerve anastomoses, and routinely identifying the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN). Completeness of resection has been assured by moving from an anatomically based approach to an embryologically based approach. This requires an awareness of the vagaries of thyroid development including attention to pyramidal remnants, to abnormalities associated with the tubercle of Zuckerkandl, and to thyrothymic thyroid rests. Preservation of parathyroid function has moved from the time-consuming technique of dissection of a vascularized pedicle in all cases, to initially selective, and then routine, parathyroid autotransplantation.

We evaluated various morphometric characteristics of microvessels, highlighted by means of anti-CD34 immunohistochemistry, in the bone marrow of 44 patients with typical HCL, before and after treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Overall, bone marrow from 103 HCL patients and 20 controls was examined. Microvessel density (MVD) and several size- and shape-related parameters were quantified in the region of most intense vascularization using image analysis. MVD, size-related parameters and the percentage of branching microvessels were higher in HCL than in controls. Likewise, perimeter counts were higher in partial/non-responders than in complete responders. Achievement of complete response was accompanied by smaller calibre microvessels. IFN-alpha induced a decrease in MVD and branching values in cases with diffuse marrow involvement. In univariate analysis, progression-free survival was adversely affected by MVD, branching and major axis length. Multivariate analysis indicated that MVD/branching independently affected progression-free survival and the likelihood of complete response. Our data suggest that the generation of bone marrow microvessels indicated an increased risk of progression and IFN-alpha treatment failure in HCL.

Unitary recordings were made from 21 rapidly ('fast') adapting (18 FA I; 3 FA II) and 44 slowly adapting (17 SA I; 27 SA II) afferents via tungsten microelectrodes in the median nerve. Skin blood flow was measured over the pulp of a contralateral finger; ECG activity, blood pressure and respiration were also recorded. Cardiac modulation, present either as a simple pulse rhythm or as modulation of an on-going discharge, was expressed by 44% of the afferents. Only two out of 18 FA I units, and two out of three FA II units, exhibited cardiac rhythmicity, but their temporal coupling to the pulse was very tight. Modulation was more common for the slowly adapting afferents (57%), and more prevalent among the SA II (65%) than the SA I (47%) classes. Nine spontaneously active SA II afferents exhibited respiratory rhythmicity, their background discharge falling during inspiration. It is concluded that cardiac modulation is common for both classes of slowly adapting tactile afferents (but less common for the rapidly adapting afferents), which may have implications for the sensory signalling of tactile information.", "journal": "Experimental physiology", "date": "2003-09-05", "authors": ["Vaughan GMacefield"], "doi": "10.1113/eph8802548"}

The H-D antigens are N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (NeuGc) terminated gangliosides that are widely distributed in mammalian species but absent in humans. Upon exposure to a vascularized pig organ, the human recipient can be immunized by direct interaction with the pig tissue or/and by transfer of tissue/cells from the organ into the recipient. In the present work, we describe the release of cells from porcine kidneys upon perfusion and the expression of glycolipid based alphaGal, blood group A/O and H-D antigens in pig lymphocytes. Pig kidneys were flushed with 20 ml of NaCl or Lidocain containing 5000 U heparin, and thereafter perfused with 3000-ml perfusion solution and the cells released were counted and examined microscopically. Neutral glycolipid and ganglioside fractions were extracted from purified pig lymphocytes. The extracted components were characterized by thin layer chromatography, degradation and mass spectrometry. The expression of alphaGal and H-D epitopes on cells released from pig kidneys and purified pig lymphocytes were studied by immune electron microscopy. A total amount of about 300 x 106 leukocytes, mainly lymphocytes were released in the perfusate from the kidneys, of which about 100 x 106 cells were eluated in the 600 to 2400 ml perfusate fraction.

The corneas were evaluated by light microscopy at 1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 60 and 120 days after surgery. Clinically, there were no differences which would promote an advantage to any of the treatments. Light microscopy, however, revealed more extensive vascularization and more advanced wound healing in the W/US group, as well as a tendency towards early graft incorporation. Based on the present results, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound shows advantages, especially in situations where trophic support is a mandatory condition, facilitating better graft incorporation and rapid recovery of stromal organization.", "journal": "Veterinary ophthalmology", "date": "2003-09-03", "authors": ["F A MVicenti", "J LLaus", "J MCosta Neto", "I CTalieri", "C FCampos", "A TJorge", "A LFerreira", "A PFantinatti"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1463-5224.2003.00303.x"}
{"title": "Patterning of embryonic blood vessels.", "abstract": "Morphometric methods were developed to characterize the geometry of vascular patterns in avian and murine embryos. By using these methods, we found that networks of blood vessels formed during vasculogenesis share similar geometric properties (i.e., mean blood vessel diameters and avascular space diameters) regardless of developmental stage, location, or species in which they form. We also found that endothelial cell density within a unit area of an embryonic vasculature could be used to accurately distinguish between a small diameter, capillary-like vascular network (low endothelial cell density) and a large diameter, presinusoidal network (high endothelial cell density). Furthermore, we show that endothelial cell size remains constant in small and large diameter vessels, indicating that increased endothelial cell size is not the basis for diversity in vessel diameter.

{"title": "The marsupial placenta: a phylogenetic analysis.", "abstract": "The structure, physiology, and endocrinology of the yolk sac placenta of different marsupial groups is compared and phylogenetically analyzed to provide information on placental characters in the marsupial stem species. We conclude that the marsupial stem species possessed a functional yolk sac placenta. Histotrophic nutrition by uterine secretion decreased during late pregnancy and at least half of the yolk sac was vascularized at the time of shell coat rupture. Due to yolk sac fusion, the larger part of the avascular, bilaminar yolk sac could not serve as a placenta at late gestation in the polyovular marsupial stem species. The bilaminar yolk sac gained a relatively greater importance for nutrition in monovular australidelphians. In macropodids a greater proportion of the yolk sac remained bilaminar at the time of shell coat rupture than in the stem species. Another derived feature of macropodids is the sustained plasma progesterone synthesis that is in turn responsible for an extended secretory phase of the uterus and a lengthened gestation. The placenta of the marsupial stem species was probably capable of metabolising histo- and hemotrophes. Recognition of pregnancy during early stages of development is a derived character of macropodids that we suggest did not occur in the marsupial stem species. However, birth and birth behaviour were apparently induced by prostaglandins in the marsupial stem species. Although the yolk sac formed the definitive placenta, it is likely that the allantois provided a supplementary placental function in the marsupial stem species, but that the role of the allantois became progressively less important during the evolution of marsupial placentation.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

{"title": "Histology of the extraembryonic membranes of an oviparous snake: towards a reconstruction of basal squamate patterns.", "abstract": "An understanding of the evolutionary morphology of extraembryonic membranes in reptiles requires information about oviparous as well as viviparous species. We are studying histology and ultrastructure of the extraembryonic membranes of snakes to clarify the evolutionary history of reptilian fetal membranes, including determination of basal (ancestral) ophidian and squamate patterns. Microscopic anatomy of the membranes of oviparous corn snakes (Elaphe guttata) was examined using light and electron microscopy. At mid-development the inner surface of the eggshell is lined by two extraembryonic membranes, the chorioallantois and the omphalallantoic membrane. The chorioallantois consists of a bilayered cuboidal epithelium that overlies the allantoic blood vessels. During development, allantoic capillaries become more abundant, and the chorionic epithelium thins, decreasing the diffusion distance for respiratory gas exchange. The abembryonic pole of the egg is delimited by a bilaminar omphalopleure and isolated yolk mass, the latter of which is lined on its inner face by the allantois. The isolated yolk mass regresses developmentally, and patches of yolk droplets become isolated and surrounded by allantoic blood vessels. By late development, the abembryonic hemisphere has been fully vascularized by allantoic vessels, forming a \"secondary chorioallantois.\" With regard to its extraembryonic membranes, Elaphe gutatta is similar to viviparous snakes. However, this species exhibits features that have not previously been reported among squamates, perhaps reflecting its oviparous reproductive habits. Morphological evidence for the uptake of eggshell material by epithelia of the chorion and omphalopleure suggests that the potential for absorption by extraembryonic membranes predates the origin of viviparity.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

{"title": "Taurine supplementation of a low protein diet fed to rat dams normalizes the vascularization of the fetal endocrine pancreas.", "abstract": "In rats, an isoenergetic low protein diet (LP) given throughout gestation perturbs the development of the endocrine pancreas by reducing beta-cell mass and islet vascularization at birth. Taurine, an important amino acid during development, has been found to be low in fetal and maternal plasma. When added to a LP diet, taurine normalizes beta-cell mass. Therefore, we investigated the ability of taurine to correct altered islet vascularization. Rats were given 20% [control (C)] or 8% (LP) protein in the diet with or without supplementation with 25 g/L taurine (T) in drinking water (C+T and LP+T) during gestation and lactation. Immunostaining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1), a VEGF receptor, was performed on fetal and neonatal pancreatic sections. Blood vessel density and blood vessel number were analyzed morphometrically on semi-thin sections. Taurine supplementation restored a normal volume and numerical density of vessels in fetal islets. The number of cells showing immunoreactivity for VEGF and Flk-1 was reduced by 33 and 45%, respectively, in islet cells from LP fetuses. In 1-mo-old pups, VEGF-positive cells remained decreased by nearly 22%. Both VEGF and Flk-1 were restored in pancreatic endocrine cells of fetuses and pups given taurine. The LP diet induced a threefold overexpression of Flk-1 in ductal cells, which contain precursors of beta cells. However, taurine supplementation was without effect. In conclusion, underexpression of VEGF and Flk-1 is associated with the lower fetal islet vascularization induced by the maternal malnutrition. The addition of taurine to the maternal diet prevents such damage and has a potential role in islet vasculogenesis.", "journal": "The Journal of nutrition", "date": "2003-09-02", "authors": ["SamiraBoujendar", "EdithArany", "DavidHill", "ClaudeRemacle", "BrigitteReusens"], "doi": "10.1093/jn/133.9.2820"}

{"title": "Low oxygen consumption in the inner retina of the visual streak of the rabbit.", "abstract": "The oxygen requirements of different retinal layers are of interest in understanding the vulnerability of the retina to hypoxic damage in retinal diseases with an ischemic component. Here, we report the first measurements of retinal oxygen consumption in the visual streak of the rabbit retina, the region with the highest density of retinal neurons, and compare it with that in the less-specialized region of the retina underlying the vascularized portion of the rabbit retina. Oxygen-sensitive microelectrodes were used to measure oxygen tension as a function of retinal depth in anesthetized animals. Measurements were performed in the region of the retina containing overlying retinal vessels and in the center of the visual streak. Established mathematical analyses of the intraretinal oxygen distribution were used to quantify the rate of oxygen consumption in the inner and outer retina and the relative oxygen contributions from the choroidal and vitreal sides. Outer retinal oxygen consumption was higher in the visual streak than in the vascularized area (means +/- SE, 284 +/- 20 vs. 210 +/- 23 nl O2.min(-1) x cm(-2), P = 0.026, n = 10). However, inner retinal oxygen consumption in the visual streak was significantly lower than in the vascular area (57 +/- 4.3 vs. 146 +/- 12 nl O2 x min(-1) x cm(-2), P < 0.001). We conclude that despite the higher processing requirements of the inner retina in the visual streak, it has a significantly lower oxygen consumption rate than the inner retina underlying the retinal vasculature. This suggests that the oxygen uptake of the inner retina is regulated to a large degree by the available oxygen supply rather than the processing requirements of the inner retina alone.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Ovarian surface epithelial cells in close contact with the apical wall of preovulatory ovine follicles secrete a urokinase-type plasminogen activator in response to surge levels of gonadotropins. Urokinase activates latent collagenases and stimulates release of tumor necrosis factor alpha from thecal endothelium. Tumor necrosis factor alpha progressively induces matrix metalloproteinase gene expression, apoptosis, and inflammatory necrosis. Collagenolysis and cellular death are a prelude to stigma formation and ovarian rupture. Ovulation is blocked by intrafollicular injection of TNFalpha or MMP-2 antisera. Unruptured follicles luteinize but are deficient in collagenous/vascularized trabeculae, and produce less progesterone than their control luteal counterparts. It appears that TNFalpha, via MMP-2 induction, contributes to the reorganization of an ovulatory follicle into a fully competent corpus luteum.", "journal": "Connective tissue research", "date": "2003-08-30", "authors": ["William JMurdoch", "Michelle LGottsch"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Hypoxia inducible factor activates the transforming growth factor-alpha/epidermal growth factor receptor growth stimulatory pathway in VHL(-/-) renal cell carcinoma cells.", "abstract": "Bi-allelic-inactivating mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene are found in the majority of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (VHL(-/-) RCC). VHL(-/-) RCC cells overproduce hypoxia-inducible genes as a consequence of constitutive, oxygen-independent activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). While HIF activation explains the highly vascularized nature of VHL loss lesions, the relative role of HIF in oncogenesis and loss of growth control remains unknown. Here, we report that HIF plays a central role in promoting unregulated growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells by activating the transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) pathway. Dominant-negative HIF and enzymatic inhibition of EGF-R were equally efficient at abolishing EGF-R activation and serum-independent growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells. TGF-alpha is the only known EGF-R ligand that has a VHL-dependent expression profile and its overexpression by VHL(-/-) RCC cells is a direct consequence of HIF activation. In contrast to TGF-alpha, other HIF targets, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were unable to stimulate serum-independent growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells. VHL(-/-) RCC cells expressing reintroduced type 2C mutants of VHL, and which retain the ability to degrade HIF, fail to overproduce TGF-alpha and proliferate in serum-free media. These data link HIF with the overproduction of a bona fide renal cell mitogen leading to activation of a pathway involved in growth of renal cancer cells. Moreover, our results suggest that HIF might be involved in oncogenesis to a much higher extent than previously appreciated.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2003-08-29", "authors": ["LakshmanGunaratnam", "MelissaMorley", "AleksandraFranovic", "Nataliede Paulsen", "KarimMekhail", "Doris A EParolin", "EijiroNakamura", "Ian A JLorimer", "StephenLee"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M305502200"}
{"title": "Recurrence of olfactory groove meningiomas.", "abstract": "Despite apparent gross total resection, olfactory groove meningiomas have a high rate of late recurrence (average, 23%). In this retrospective study, we confirmed that the sites of these recurrences are the cranial base and paranasal sinuses. We postulated that these recurrences stem from conservative handling of the underlying invaded bone. Therefore, we analyzed patient outcomes according to the radicality of surgical resection.\nFifteen consecutive patients with a diagnosis of olfactory groove meningioma were treated surgically between 1992 and 2001 (nine new cases, six recurrent). Only patients with benign meningiomas were included; atypical and malignant meningiomas were excluded. Surgical resection included the dura and drilling of the underlying bone and resection of involved mucosa. We reviewed each patient's clinical records, radiological studies, sites of recurrence, grade of previous resection, and complications.\nOlfactory groove meningiomas invaded the underlying bone in 13 cases. All patients with recurrence had previously undergone a surgical resection corresponding only to Simpson Grade 2, which does not include the removal of underlying invaded bone. The sites of recurrence were in the cranial base or adjacent paranasal sinuses. The time to recurrence varied from 1 to 12 years (average, 7 yr; mean, 8 yr). Three patients had undergone one previous resection, two had undergone two previous resections, and one had undergone four previous operations. The ethmoid sinus was involved in all cases of recurrence, either with the sphenoid sinus or with an intracranial recurrence. Thirteen patients underwent complete resection of underlying bone and the invaded paranasal sinuses, then reconstruction of the anterior fossa. No patient died. There were three instances of cerebrospinal fluid leakage (one requiring operative repair), one case of delayed worsening vision after initial improvement, and two cases of transient cranial nerve palsy (Cranial Nerves III and IV). There was no recurrence at follow-up (average, 3.7 yr; range, 1-7.3 yr).\nThe cranial base and paranasal sinuses are sites of predilection for recurrence of olfactory groove meningiomas. Recurrence is the result of a direct extension attributable to incomplete resection of involved bone and regrowth at the edge of a previous surgical field. Extensive resection of all suspicious underlying bone is a complement to radical removal of these lesions.

However, the function of the secreted form of the protein in cancer has not been previously studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the antiangiogenic function of a secreted form of the MDA-7/IL-24 protein (sMDA-7/IL-24). In vitro, sMDA-7/IL-24 inhibited both endothelial cell differentiation and migration of endothelial cells induced by vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The sMDA-7/IL-24-mediated inhibitory effect was 10-50 times more potent than endostatin, IFN-gamma, and IFN-inducible protein 10 in vitro. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect was not mediated by IFN or IFN-inducible protein 10. IL-22 receptor mediated the antiangiogenic activity of sMDA-7/IL-24. Administration of a blocking antibody to IL-22 receptor in conjunction with sMDA-7/IL-24 led to abrogation of inhibition of endothelial differentiation. sMDA-7/IL-24 inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis as evidenced by reduced vascularization and hemoglobin content in in vivo Matrigel plug assays. In vivo, the growth of human lung tumor cells was significantly inhibited, and vascularization was reduced when the cells were mixed with 293 cells stably expressing sMDA-7/IL-24. Systemic administration of sMDA-7/IL-24 inhibited lung tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Associated with tumor growth inhibition was decreased tumor microvessel density and hemoglobin content, indicating the presence of antiangiogenic activity.

For the chemotherapeutical treatment of glioblastomas, the endothel cell is of special importance since due to its manifold metabolic and protective tasks within the blood-brain barrier, it already has a relatively high PGP expression under physiological conditions. The aim of the present study was to analyze the uptake of the antimitotic drug Doxorubicin (DOX) and the expression of PGP in human and rat glioblastoma cell lines and in a human endothelial cell line at different time points. In the following in vivo approach DOX enriched glioblastoma cells were transplanted into rats and the developed tumor was investigated histologically. The results showed an increased uptake and an enhanced expression of PGP at certain time points in every cell line. In the tissue a DOX release was mainly observed in perivascular surroundings. It was concluded that DOX enhanced the constitutive PGP expression which led to a subsequent exclusion of DOX in tumor cells but also in the endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature.

Survivin, the inhibitor of apoptosis protein, is up-regulated in vitro in vascular endothelial cells by angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). To evaluate the in vivo role of survivin in the brain in response to hypoxia/ischemia, we used a mouse model of stroke and show that 2 days after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, survivin is uniquely expressed by microvessels that form in the peri-infarct and infarct regions. The extent of vascularization of the infarct is dependent on expression of survivin, since vessel density is significantly reduced in mice with heterozygous deficiency of the survivin gene (survivin+/- mice), even though infarct sizes were not different. Hypoxia alone induces survivin expression in the brain, by cultured endothelial cells and by embryonic stem cells, but this response is at least partially independent of VEGF, hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha, or placental growth factor. Delineating the spatiotemporal pattern of expression of survivin after stroke, and the molecular mechanisms by which this is regulated, may provide novel approaches to therapeutically optimize angiogenesis in a variety of ischemic disorders.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2003-08-26", "authors": ["Edward MConway", "FemkeZwerts", "VeerleVan Eygen", "AstridDeVriese", "NobuoNagai", "WeiLuo", "D\u00e9sir\u00e9Collen"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63453-0"}

Using conventional epi-illuminescence microscopy, the convoluted architecture demonstrating branch points within capillaries, between capillaries and larger vessels, were clearly observed in uterine and subcutaneous gluteal fat samples. In adult endometrial tissue where angiogenesis occurs on a monthly basis, complex anastamosis of vessels and tenuous structures were clearly seen. Three-dimensional rendered surface models formed by examination of confocal z-stacks demonstrated the existence of the lumen within microvessels. Tissue prelabelled with UEA-1 was used to assist and verify the presence of endothelial cells in culture, during and after the isolation procedure. Additionally, UEA-1 was added to a uterine fibroblast-microvascular-endothelial cell coculture model to allow daily vital observations of changes in the phenotype of the endothelium.

Two to four normal vascularized intercostal nerves above the spinal cord injury site were obtained by cutting in the distal end at the midclavicular line. The proximal ends were disconnected from the levatores costarum. Nerves were then transferred to the vertebral canal through a submuscle tunnel and sutured with the selected fascicula of lumbar nerve roots (L 1/2 or L 3/4) by epiperineurial neurorrhaphy in the subdura or extradura. If the selected intercostal nerve was not of sufficient length to reach the specific lumbar region, a sural nerve segment was isolated, sheared into two segments, and attached to the intercostal nerve for grafting. Twenty-three patients, whose injury sites were between the thoracic T9 and T12 levels, were followed postoperatively for a period ranging from 2 to 11 (average: 3.5) years. Of these patients, 18 (78%) regained the stepping-forward function and were able to walk with crutches or other ambulatory assistive devices.

Paraffin sections were assessed immunohistochemically using antibodies against COX-2, CD34 (endothelial cells) and CD105 (proliferating vessels).

COX-2 positive tumours had significantly greater vascularization for proliferating vessels. In COX-2 negative tumours the MVD was 22.1, identified by CD34 immunostaining, and 3.4 for proliferating vessels (CD105), whereas COX-2 positive tumours had a MVD of 18.3 (CD34), and of 5.8, respectively (CD105).

Despite its low homology to mammalian gelatinase-B, the avian 75-kDa seems to function similarly in the context of endochondral bone formation.\nGelatinase B/metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, a zinc-dependent protease of the MMP family, is a key regulator in the final step of endochondral ossification. Recently an avian 75-kDa gelatinase B-like enzyme that shows low sequence similarity to the mammalian enzyme (59% on the protein level) was cloned and characterized. However, its expression pattern in the chicken growth plate and its role in bone formation have not, so far, been examined.\nBased on the published sequence, we cloned a 700-bp fragment from cDNA of the chicken growth plate and studied its expression pattern in primary chondrocytes. Because the basal expression level of gelatinase B was almost undetectable, we induced its expression by different culturing conditions, the most dramatic induction achieved by treatment with retinoic acid, which is known as an inducer of vascular invasion in the epiphyseal plates. The gelatinolitic activity, checked by zymography, detected bands corresponding to the gelatinase A and B as well as a new high-molecular weight band of approximately 200 kDa. We further studied the expression pattern of gelatinase B by in situ hybridization. The gelatinase B was expressed by the cells surrounding the blood vessels penetrating the growth plate and by chondrocytes located in the front of these vascular invasions in the borders between the bone and the cartilage, resembling the expression of mouse gelatinase B in the growth plate. The induction of rickets by a vitamin D-deficient diet reduced the expression levels of gelatinase B in the growth plate of 12-day-old chickens but did not affect the expression of gelatinase A mRNA.\nThe chicken growth plate has a distinctly different structure from the mammalian one: it is much wider, it contains more cells in each zone, and the blood vessels penetrate deeper into the hypertrophic zone. Nevertheless, the upregulation of the avian 75-kDa gelatinase B-like enzyme by vitamins A and D, coupled with its perivascular expression pattern in the growth plate, implies a similar role for the mammalian and avian genes in bone formation.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2003-08-22", "authors": ["ATong", "AReich", "OGenin", "MPines", "EMonsonego-Ornan"], "doi": "10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.8.1443"}

The results showed that the aorta branched out at the level of the cardiac outlet to form the left and right coronary arteries and right ramus coni arteriosi. Coronary arteries coursed and ramified in the myocardium. The left coronary artery divided to form the paraconal interventricular artery and left circumflex artery when it reached the coronary sulcus. The interventricular septum was vascularized by the septal branch of the paraconal interventricular artery and by the small septal branches. The left and right coronary arteries gave off all the branches reported in the literature for other species. When the ramus coni arteriosi originates from the right coronary artery, it is designated a third coronary artery. In conclusion, it was found that the coronary arteries of the porcupine had an \"intramyocardial course\" as in other rodents.

{"title": "Microvascular architecture of the fetal cotyledons in water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) during different stages of pregnancy.", "abstract": "To elucidate the morphological background of physiological differences between bovine and buffalo gestation forty-two placentae ranging from the 3rd to 10th month of pregnancy were used to study the microvascular architecture of the fetal cotyledons in the buffalo. The tissues were prepared for light and scanning electron microscopy by paraformaldehyde fixation and corrosion casting of the fetal cotyledonary vascular system. Histology and vascular casts revealed the buffalo fetal cotyledons to consist of a series of conical villous trees changing from a wide to slender shape during pregnancy, and with a base strictly facing the fetal side. The branches of these trees, intermediate and terminal villi, projected radially from the stem, thus representing a rough type of villous tree. A second type of tree lacked these branches and was therefore termed smooth villus. The rough type was most prevalent, and the intermediate and terminal villi showed capillary complexes arranged in stories by the 4th to 5th month of gestation. The stories became broader and denser with the progress of pregnancy (6th to 7th month of gestation), due to extensive growth of new capillaries and simultaneous development of convolutions causing the vascular ridges of the terminal villi to appear bushy. Near term (9th to 10th month) the capillary system became very dense, particularly at the margin of the vascular ridges, leaving only narrow spaces for the corresponding maternal septal tissue. In detail, at its base the trunk of each villous tree contained a single central stem artery which originated from the allantochorionic arterial system, and 1-3 parallel peripheral stem veins. When approaching the cone tip, these vessels branched into new stem arteries and veins, each giving rise to arterioles and venules according to the principle vascularization of the stem villus first, followed by intermediate and terminal villi. The capillary complex of the terminal villi consisted of arterial capillary limbs, capillary loops with sinusoidal dilatations and anastomoses, and venous capillary limbs. The latter converged into venules of terminal and intermediate villi which joined stem veins leading into allantochorionic veins. In conclusion, the fetal vasculature of the buffalo placentome was greatly increased from early pregnancy to near term. This was denoted by the general development of stem villous trees and an increase in the volume and density of the capillary system of the terminal villi, reflecting the increasing need of materno-fetal substance exchange in the buffalo placenta, particularly near term.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2003-08-20", "authors": ["Mahmoud M MAbd-Elnaeim", "Maria Aug\u00e9licaMiglino", "ChistianePfarrer", "RudolfLeiser"], "doi": "10.1016/S0940-9602(03)80053-5"}

Three-dimensional (3D) US can provide more accurate depiction of stereotypic vascular patterns than 2D US. This study investigated the efficacy of 3D power Doppler US versus angiography for demonstrating associated arteries of HCCs.\nA total of 24 HCCs with surrounding or intratumoral arteries detected by 2D power Doppler US were studied using a US machine equipped with power Doppler software and a built-in stereo image processing workstation. Serial 2D images were reconstructed into 3D images to analyze the distribution and routes of arteries associated with HCCs. These results were compared with angiographic findings.\nThree-dimensional US imaging of vasculature associated with HCCs in the 24 patients was categorized into 3 patterns: peripheral arteries around the tumor (pattern I, n = 9); no more than 4 intratumoral arteries with or without originating peripheral arteries (pattern II, n = 9); and prominent (more than 4) intratumoral arteries (pattern III, n = 6). Most feeding arteries shown in angiograms that could be demonstrated by 3D power Doppler US were in HCCs with pattern I and II vasculature. In HCCs with pattern III, the basket vascular pattern shown on angiograms could also be demonstrated on 3D power Doppler US. The vascular proficiency, including major feeding arteries and branches of feeding arteries,could be shown to significantly increase from pattern I to III on 3D power Doppler, but this method had a lower detection rate of smaller branches and neovascularization than angiographic study.\nThree-dimensional power Doppler US can effectively depict the associated arteries of HCCs, especially the major feeding arteries. Three vascularization patterns of HCCs were categorized in 3D images. There is a good correlation of the findings of 3D power Doppler US with angiographic study.

Dev. 110 (2002) 183). Here we first established that retinal expression of ephrin-B2 and its putative receptor EphB4 correlates with arterial and venous phenotype, respectively. Then we analyzed the expression pattern of msr/apj in the retinal vessels at various stages of postnatal development by in situ hybridization. In contrast to the expression of ephrin-B2 or EphB4, msr/apj transcripts can be detected as early as postnatal day P3. From P3 to P12, msr/apj expression in the vascular network is restricted to the venules and the associated capillaries. The msr/apj gene is thus an early and specific marker of the venous phenotype in the retinal vasculature.", "journal": "Gene expression patterns : GEP", "date": "2003-08-14", "authors": ["MagaliSaint-Geniez", "Claire BrandArgence", "BernardKnibiehler", "YvesAudigier"], "doi": "10.1016/s1567-133x(03)00062-0"}

This study investigated expression patterns of two major angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), in the distracted calluses following mandibular lengthening in a goat model.\nBilateral mandibular osteotomies were performed in 15 young adult goats. After a latency of 7 days, the mandibles were elongated using custom-made distractors with a rate of 1 mm/day for 10 days. Three animals each were sacrificed at the end of the delay phase, at 0, 7, 14, and 28 days after completion of distraction, respectively. The lengthened mandibles were harvested and processed for histological and immunohistochemical examinations.\nElevated cellular expression of VEGF and bFGF, with neovascularization in the distraction gap, was observed following mandibular lengthening. VEGF staining was noted in the endothelial cells and osteoblasts. bFGF staining was seen in the fibroblast-like cells, osteoblasts and immature osteocytes. Their strongest expression was found 0-7 days after the end of distraction, and declined with maturation of the newly formed bone.\nA temporal and spatial expression pattern of VEGF and bFGF was found during distraction osteogenesis in goat mandibles. It suggests that distraction forces can stimulate the production of VEGF and bFGF, which contribute to neovascularization and new bone formation during gradual distraction of the mandible. Application of angiogenic factors may be considered as a potential method to enhance angiogenesis and osteogenesis in osteodistraction, especially in sites without enough vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2003-08-14", "authors": ["JingHu", "ShujuanZou", "JihuaLi", "YuChen", "DazhangWang", "ZhanweiGao"], "doi": "10.1016/s1010-5182(03)00034-9"}

VHL-associated tumors are highly vascularized, a characteristic associated with overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The VHL protein (pVHL) is a component of the ubiquitin ligase E3 complex, targeting substrate proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomic degradation. Here, we report that the pVHL can directly bind to the human RNA polymerase II seventh subunit (hsRPB7) through its beta-domain, and naturally occurring beta-domain mutations can decrease the binding of pVHL to hsRPB7. Introducing wild-type pVHL into human kidney tumor cell lines carrying endogenous mutant non-functional pVHL facilitates ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of hsRPB7, and decreases its nuclear accumulation. pVHL can also suppress hsRPB7-induced VEGF promoter transactivation, mRNA expression and VEGF protein secretion. Together, our results suggest that hsRPB7 is a downstream target of the VHL ubiquitylating complex and pVHL may regulate angiogenesis by targeting hsRPB7 for degradation via the ubiquitylation pathway and preventing VEGF expression.", "journal": "The EMBO journal", "date": "2003-08-13", "authors": ["XiNa", "Hai OuDuan", "Edward MMessing", "Susan RSchoen", "Charlotte KRyan", "P Anthonydi Sant'Agnese", "Erica AGolemis", "GuanWu"], "doi": "10.1093/emboj/cdg410"}

{"title": "[Management of anastomotic fistula following excision of rectal cancer].", "abstract": "The risk of anastomotic leak after resection of cancers of the mid or low rectum with mesorectal excision is about 10%--the lower the colo-rectal or colo-anal anastomosis, the higher the risk of leak. If the fistula is asymtomatic and the leak is walled off, it is best to defer the closure of the diverting ileostomy for 2-3 months and to proceed only when a radiologic contrast study shows the fistula to have disappeared. More commonly, the anastomotic fistula presents as a pelvic abscess. It is simple and logical to drain the abscess into the digestive tube by enlarging the orifice of the fistula; this can usually be done with a brief general anesthetic. Less commonly, the abscess may present at some distance from the anastomotic leak; this calls for percutaneous drainage. If abscess drainage fails, if pelvic sepsis persists, or if the leak presents from the start as generalized peritonitis, laparotomy is called for in order to lavage the abscess cavity, place effective drains, and perform, if necessary, a diverting stoma upstream. Two strategies are possible: 1) drain placement at the leak site with upstream loop diverting stoma, or 2) takedown of the anastomosis, closure of the distal stump as a Hartmann pouch, and proximal end colostomy in the left lower quadrant. In the first instance, one must be sure the fistula has healed before stoma closure. In the second, the problem is to obtain (at a second stage) sufficient length of well-vascularized proximal colon to make an anastomosis to a short Hartmann pouch or to the anus in a pelvis scarred and inflamed by infection and radiation. A Soave procedure may allow an anastomosis with less risk to peri-rectal innervation and with less blood loss. Two maneuvers which may help to gain length are the Toupet technique for freeing the transverse mesocolon or the Deloyer technique of mobilizing the hepatic flexure.

Visual acuity was measured using Snellen lines and/or ETDRS. The feeder vessels were visualized with high-speed ICG angiography (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope, Heidelberg HRA, Heidelberg, Germany). Feeder vessels were identified as very thin vessels with early filling and rapid emptying. Feeder vessel closure was achieved by laser photocoagulation treatment with either minipulse infrared laser therapy (810 nm), microburst, or yellow laser (568 nm). Post-treatment high-speed ICG angiography follow-up was recommended to the patient immediately or the day after the treatment. The number of treatments and location of the feeder vessels in relation to the macula as well as FA, ICG, and visual acuity results were assessed. If necessary, other treatment techniques such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) were offered to the patient when leakage was still present.\nThe patients were followed for an average of 6.2 months (2-9 months). Twenty-six women and 14 men (mean age, 72 years; range, 51-95) were included. Eight patients demonstrated classic neovascularization, 32 presented occult neovascularization, including 17 cases of vascularized PED and 15 retrofoveal plaques.

{"title": "Role of arteries in oxygen induced vaso-obliteration.", "abstract": "In mice the retinal vasculature develops in the first postnatal week by spreading from the optic nerve head towards the retinal periphery. During this growth period, exposure to hyperoxia causes vaso-obliteration of capillaries in the retinal center but not in peripheral regions. High oxygen levels lead to downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important survival factor for vascular endothelial cells, which could explain the vaso-obliteration caused by hyperoxia. However, it is not clear why only capillaries in the center of the retina are affected. We therefore investigated how capillary obliteration correlates with VEGF mRNA distribution by in situ hybridization in retinal whole mount preparations. In mouse pups reared under normoxic conditions VEGF mRNA was detectable across the entire vascular network but was virtually absent in the immediate vicinity of arteries. This was true along developing retinal arteries but also around the optic nerve head through which the entire arterial blood supply for the retinal and hyaloid vasculature passes. In these areas capillaries were absent, resulting in so-called capillary free zones. Exposure to hyperoxia caused an expansion of areas with low VEGF mRNA which correlated with capillary obliteration in these regions. Combined capillary obliteration around the optic nerve head and along retinal arteries lead to a large capillary free zone in the center of the retina. Thus, our observations suggest that hyperoxia affects the retinal vasculature by reducing VEGF mRNA levels near arteries and causing a widening of capillary free zones.", "journal": "Experimental eye research", "date": "2003-08-09", "authors": ["SuzanneClaxton", "MarcusFruttiger"], "doi": "10.1016/s0014-4835(03)00153-2"}

Often the webs are positioned between the feathered abdomen and the egg during incubation, suggesting that either the abdomen, the feet, or both could transfer heat to the egg. We studied heat transfer from foot webs to eggs during incubation in Nazca boobies by spatially separating the feet from the abdomen using an oversized egg. We found that feet transfer heat to eggs independently of any heat that may be transferred from the abdomen. In addition, we found that incubating boobies had significantly greater vascularization in their foot webs, measured as a percentage of web area covered by vessels, than nonincubating boobies. We also found that males, whether incubating or nonincubating, had significantly less web vascularization than females.

{"title": "Problem of dural scarring in recording from awake, behaving monkeys: a solution using 5-fluorouracil.", "abstract": "In studies using single neuron recordings from awake, behaving monkeys, it is necessary to make repeated transdural penetrations using fragile microelectrodes. The tough connective tissue that accumulates after the dura mater is first exposed is often problematic because of electrode breakage and the mechanical stress to the underlying brain tissue caused by excessive dimpling during penetration. We describe the use of an antimitotic compound, 5-fluorouracil (5FU) to control the growth of this connective tissue. 5FU can be safely applied for short periods to the exposed dural tissue on a regular basis provided that it is thoroughly rinsed after application. The advantages of using 5FU are fourfold: first, it depresses fibroblast division and minimizes dural growth and scar tissue formation so that penetrations are easier with less electrode damage or breakage. Second, the frequency of surgical procedures required to remove this tissue are greatly reduced, which benefits both the experiment animal and the experiment. Third, 5FU reduces vascularization of the tissue so that its removal is far easier and without significant blood loss. Finally, 5FU seems to inhibit bacterial infections within the recording chamber. In macaque motor cortex, we performed a quantitative study of electrophysiological data recorded from monkeys with and without 5FU treatment. No significant deleterious side effects produced by 5FU could be detected. Likewise, histological examination of cortical tissue underlying treated dura did not reveal any obvious signs of damage by 5FU. We recommend this approach, with the appropriate safety precautions, to all those neurophysiologists using transdural microelectrode methods in chronically prepared experimental animals.

The lateral upper arm free flap (LUFF) presents an alternative method for the fasciocutaneous tissue transfer. We report on our experience with the LUFF in a 56-year-old male patient with a pT3pN0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx. A pharyngocutaneous fistula developed 5 days after pharyngolaryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection. The fistula was localized between the pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the esophagus and was closed with an LUFF from the left arm. Excellent flap adaptation to the remaining pharyngeal mucosa was observed. Although the length of the vascular pedicle and the diameter of the vessels in the LUFF are smaller than those in the RFFF, neither pedicle length nor vessel diameter proved to be a problem. The LUFF can be recommended as a well-vascularized, relatively safe and reliable flap for reconstruction of tubular structures such as the hypopharynx and the PES after tumor ablation and as an alternative to the RFFF.

Recently, hepatic cirrhosis in the course of virus-associated chronic hepatitis has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis CC. Histologically, 90-95% of CC are well differentiated adenocarcinomas. Usually the tumor grows slowly and metastazes late locally and even less frequently extrahepaticly. CC often causes symptoms by blocking the bile ducts, abdominal pain, weight loss, signs of portal hypertension, rare ascites and thrombophlebitis.

{"title": "The free deltoid flap: microscopic anatomy studies and clinical application to oral cavity reconstruction.", "abstract": "The deltoid free flap is a fasciocutaneous flap that should be thin, hairless, of an adequate size, and capable of sensory reinnervation. Because of its excellent color-matching and texture-matching characteristics, it has recently been widely used for the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects during oral and maxillofacial surgery. Furthermore, a characteristic of oral and maxillofacial soft-tissue defects is that they are not large; therefore, flap size will be small, allowing the donor site to be directly closed. Because of natural variation in parts of the anatomy, there has sometimes been great difficulty in clinical application. The authors decided to study this by performing anatomical studies of the deltoid region on 21 cadavers. The result indicates that the pedicle of the deltoid free flap penetrates the \"quadrangular space\" in 90 percent of cases but passes and does not penetrate the quadrangular space in the remaining cases. The authors also confirmed that the skin has a vascular network comprising five layers and, furthermore, that the vascular network of the deep fascia is dense. The authors also report six cases of its clinical use complicated by anatomic variation and local infection in which the deltoid flap showed a completely successful outcome.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2003-08-06", "authors": ["ZuolinWang", "KazuoSano", "TsugioInokuchi", "JiLi", "XingjianLan", "JojiSekine", "HisazumiIkeda"], "doi": "10.1097/01.PRS.0000070725.74647.1E"}
{"title": "A functional overlap of plasminogen and MMPs regulates vascularization during placental development.", "abstract": "Both plasminogen activators and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in a variety of developmental processes in the mouse during embryo implantation and placentation. We show here that pharmacological treatment of plasminogen-deficient mice with the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor galardin leads to a high rate of embryonic lethality. Implantation sites from plasminogen-deficient galardin-treated mice at 7.5 days post coitus (dpc) showed delay in both decidualization and invasion of maternal vessels into the decidua. At 8.5 dpc, half of the embryos were runted and still at the developmental stage of a 7.5 dpc embryo. Most embryos that escaped these initial defects eventually died, probably from defective vascularization and development of the labyrinth layer of the placenta, although a direct role on embryo development cannot be ruled out. These results demonstrate that the combination of MMPs and plasminogen is essential for the proper development of the placenta. Plasminogen deficiency alone and galardin treatment alone had much less effect and there was a pronounced synergism on both placental vascularization and embryonic lethality, indicating a functional overlap between plasminogen and MMPs.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2003-08-06", "authors": ["HeleneSolberg", "JulieRinkenberger", "KeldDan\u00f8", "ZenaWerb", "Leif RLund"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.00642"}

Impaired healing develops in 5-10% of all fractures, and manifests as delayed union or non-union. This paper deals with the problem of impaired healing as well as with methods of fracture healing enhancement.\nThere are many factors causing impaired fracture healing (inadequate vascularization, mechanical causes, infection, etc.), and it is very important to recognize the principle cause of delayed union and non-union, since therapy is based on eliminating the factor that causes it.\nThrough constant attempts to find adequate solutions and procedures in order to resolve the problem of impaired fracture healing, many alternatives in treatment of impaired healing have been developed. Some of these procedures may also be useful in treatment of fresh fractures, especially when it comes to fractures that are prone to delayed union and non-union more than usual. All currently known methods of healing enhancement may be classified as biological, mechanical and biophysical.\nCertain methods are in clinical use for several decades.

The acquisition of a functional blood supply seems to be rate-limiting for the ability of a tumor to grow beyond a certain size and to metastasize to other sites. Accumulating evidence indicates that hypoxia and the key transcriptional system, HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor), are the major triggers for new blood vessel growth in malignant tumors. Although vessel growth and maturation are complex and highly coordinated processes requiring the sequential activation of a multitude of factors, there is a consensus that vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin signaling represent crucial steps in tumor angiogenesis. Recent insights into cellular and molecular crosstalk suggest a model in which hypoxia, HIF, and several HIF target genes participate in the coordinated collaboration between tumor, endothelial, inflammatory/hematopoietic, and circulating endothelial precursor cells to enhance and promote tumor vascularization.

Mast cells uniquely populate all vascularized organs and tissues, including the upper and lower respiratory tree, even in healthy individuals.

The mechanisms responsible for constitutive mast cell development have been partly elucidated. Moreover, both in vitro studies and in vivo disease models indicate that mast cells have a remarkably flexible program of gene expression, and this program can be drastically altered by the T-cell-derived Th2 cytokines relevant to asthma. Moreover, the role of mast cells in innate immunity is now firmly established, and the capacity for numerous microbial pathogens to initiate their activation in vitro and in vivo suggest mechanisms by which microbes could initiate disease exacerbations.", "journal": "Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids", "date": "2003-08-05", "authors": ["Joshua ABoyce"], "doi": "10.1016/s0952-3278(03)00081-4"}

We examined VEGF165's ability to (1) alter the vascular network of the adult rat striatum, (2) influence the vascular growth of solid embryonic day 14 (E14) ventral mesencephalic (VM) grafts when placed into a VEGF-pretreated host striatum, (3) alter the function and survival of E14 VM grafts when transplanted into an adult DA-deleted striatum, and (4) influence cell survival and neurite growth in cultures of E14 VM cells. We demonstrate here that a single bolus injection of VEGF165 into the adult rat striatum significantly increases the amount of vasculature in the vicinity of the injection site in a delayed and transient manner when compared to saline controls. Transplanting solid E14 VM grafts into the VEGF165-pretreated striatum resulted in a homogeneous distribution of small blood vessels throughout the graft, a pattern that closely resembles mature adult vasculature. In contrast, grafts in the control condition contained a patchy distribution of heavily dilated vessels. Behavioral measurements indicate that VEGF pretreatment of the intrastriatal graft site accelerates recovery of amphetamine-induced rotational asymmetry in unilateral 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Unexpectedly, however, VEGF pretreatments failed to increase survival of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (THir) neurons in the grafts. In contrast to this finding in vivo, adding VEGF165 to glial-reduced E14 rat VM cultures produced a fourfold increase in THir cell survival and a doubling in the length of THir neurites. We conclude that with the proper method of delivery, VEGF165 may prove to be one of several strategies necessary to significantly improve the survival and function of fetal VM tissue grafts.", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "date": "2003-08-05", "authors": ["Mark RPitzer", "Caryl ESortwell", "Brian FDaley", "Susan OMcGuire", "DeannaMarchionini", "MatthewFleming", "Timothy JCollier"], "doi": "10.1016/s0014-4886(03)00100-6"}

We have investigated the potential of these cells to accelerate revascularization and healing in full-thickness skin wounds of hypoinsulinemic (streptozotocin-treated) diabetic mice. Wounds were injected with human CD34+ or CD34- peripheral blood mononuclear cells or no cells, and analyzed for vascularity and healing at various times thereafter. Treatment with CD34+ enriched cells decreased wound size by 4 days after treatment, accelerated epidermal healing, and rapidly and dramatically accelerated revascularization of the wounds compared to controls. Initially increased vascularization was mediated principally by an increase in vessel diameter, but later, both an increase in vascular size and number were observed.

{"title": "Morphogenesis of blood vessels in the head muscles of avian embryo: spatial, temporal, and VEGF expression analyses.", "abstract": "Adult skeletal muscle is a highly vascularized tissue, but the development of intramuscular endothelial networks has not been well studied. In quail embryos, QH1-positive angioblasts are present and moving throughout myogenic head mesoderm before the onset of primary myotube formation. On day 5 of incubation, concurrent with early myotube formation and aggregation, angioblasts establish a transient vascular plexus surrounding the myogenic condensations. Between days 5 and 9, the intramuscular vessels form an irregular network of endothelial cords and patent channels and only later are the parallel arrays of capillaries characteristic of adult muscles established. Microinjections using India ink, QH1, and Mercox resin reveal that these intramuscular capillaries are typically not connected to systemic vessels of the head until day 10, which is near the end of primary myogenesis and corresponds to the onset of muscular function. Morphometric analyses performed during primary myogenesis stages show a decrease in muscle cell density but no significant changes in intramuscular vascular density between days 5 and 9. This finding was surprising, as it is generally assumed that muscle growth requires elevated oxygen and nutrient levels. Moreover, there are no significant morphometric differences in vascular supply to embryonic fast and slow muscles. Endothelial tissue density is similar in slow muscles (oculorotatory, e.g., lateral rectus), fast muscles (mandibular depressor), and mixed muscles, in which the fiber types can be interspersed (jaw adductors) or segregated (branchiomandibular). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein is abundant in myotubes but not endothelial cells within both fast and slow head muscles at days 7 and 9. However, in some mixed muscles, only a minority of myotubes, which do not correspond to one specific fiber type, express VEGF. These results document a dynamic set of intramuscular and perimuscular angiogenic reorganizations during avian head myogenesis.

{"title": "Sural flap vascularization in arteritic patients: an anatomic study of 24 amputation specimens.", "abstract": "Obliterating arteriopathy of the lower limbs is a classic contraindication for neurocutaneous islands flaps, particularly the sural flap. But recent literature reports examples of its successful application in arteritic patients. The aim of this work was to study the vascular anatomy of the sural flap in patients suffering from arteriopathy and its possible clinical application. Twenty-four specimens of leg amputation were studied. The mean age of the amputated patients was 68.5 years. The clinical signs of arteriopathy had been present for 3-16 years. In 10 cases amputation was carried out directly, in 14 cases after failed revascularization. The results of the dissection showed the theoretical possibility of a sural flap in almost all the cases (23 of 24) despite certain anatomical peculiarities. In the upper part of the leg the arterial network of the sural communicating nerve dominates that of the sural nerve; this should allow the use of a sural flap centered on this vascular axis. In the lower part, the arterial network of the sural communicating nerve is sustained by the perforators of the peroneal artery, then by the branches of the calcaneal artery, and finally by the lateral tarsal artery, which should allow the use of a sural flap with a very distal pedicle. The authors propose a theory which suggests that the progressive evolution of arteriopathy and the concomitant development of a supply network involving the vascularization of the sensory nerves induces the \"anticipation\" of a sural flap.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2003-07-25", "authors": ["SMalokov", "DCasanova", "GMagalon", "ABranchereau"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-003-0141-y"}

The transplantation of exogenous cells with the inherent ability to contract has been put forward as one potential treatment strategy to increase contractility and cardiac performance. Besides skeletal myoblasts or stem cells from various sources, immature cardiomyocytes, such as fetal or neonatal cardiomyocytes, have been transplanted into normal, cryoinjured, infarcted myocardium, as well as into models of global heart failure. Survival of transplanted immature cardiomyocytes has been demonstrated up to 6-7 months, accompanied by vascularization of the grafted tissue. Transplants developed sarcomeric structures and other morphological features of differentiation. The principal possibility of cell-to-cell coupling between graft and host cells was demonstrated after cardiomyocyte transplantation into normal hearts and in some studies in damaged myocardium. But most long-term follow-up investigations in models of myocardial infarction reported that optimal integration of the engrafted cells appeared to be hindered by scar tissue, separating the transplant from the host. Nonetheless, in several studies, improved parameters of cardiac performance were demonstrated ex-vivo and in vivo. Potential mechanisms might involve beneficial effects on the remodeling process.

Rat remnant kidney is an established model of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and progression to end-stage renal failure. The morphologic lesions comprise nephron loss and regeneratory tubular hypertrophy, interstitial infiltration, predominately by macrophages, and progressive fibrosis. A critical role in this complex pathology was assigned to tubulointerstitial blood microvessels that regulate the supply of oxygen and nutrients of tubuli. Whereas some investigations reported a rarefaction of the vascular network in association with the degenerative cortical changes, others observed an increase in vascularization. Here these discrepant findings are addressed by reinvestigation of the vascularization of rat remnant kidneys by the use of two novel endothelial lineage specific, discriminatory markers, i.e., the membrane mucoprotein podoplanin with specificity for lymphatic endothelia, and the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane enzyme aminopeptidase P that is recognized by a monoclonal antibody designated JG12 and that is specifically expressed by endothelial cells of blood vessels only. The results obtained confirm a regional rarefaction of aminopeptidase P-positive blood microvessels; they also establish major changes in the renal lymphatic vasculature. Massive proliferation of lymphatic vessels was observed in fibrotic tubulointerstitial regions, whereas in kidneys of sham-operated rats, only a few lymphatic vessels were found adjoined with arteries. The lymphatic vessels frequently contained mononuclear cells that were also encountered in the interstitial spaces and expressed relative large amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor-C mRNA by in situ hybridization. Collectively, these results indicate that a large proportion of the microvessels encountered in the cortex of remnant kidneys are of lymphatic origin and cannot be discriminated by common endothelial markers, such as CD34, that are expressed by both lymphatic and blood endothelia cells. As lymphatic endothelial cells secrete chemokines that attract dendritic cells, it is possible that the increase in lymphatic vascularization could enhance the immunologic surveillance of remnant kidneys.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "date": "2003-07-23", "authors": ["KatsuyukiMatsui", "KatalynNagy-Bojarsky", "PirjoLaakkonen", "SigurdKrieger", "KarlMechtler", "ShunyaUchida", "SilvanaGeleff", "Duk-HeeKang", "Richard JJohnson", "DontschoKerjaschki"], "doi": "10.1097/01.asn.0000076078.50889.43"}
{"title": "Altered fracture repair in the absence of MMP9.", "abstract": "The regeneration of adult skeletal tissues requires the timely recruitment of skeletal progenitor cells to an injury site, the differentiation of these cells into bone or cartilage, and the re-establishment of a vascular network to maintain cell viability. Disturbances in any of these cellular events can have a detrimental effect on the process of skeletal repair. Although fracture repair has been compared with fetal skeletal development, the extent to which the reparative process actually recapitulates the fetal program remains uncertain. Here, we provide the first genetic evidence that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) regulates crucial events during adult fracture repair. We demonstrate that MMP9 mediates vascular invasion of the hypertrophic cartilage callus, and that Mmp9(-/-) mice have non-unions and delayed unions of their fractures caused by persistent cartilage at the injury site. This MMP9- dependent delay in skeletal healing is not due to a lack of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor expression, but may instead be due to the lack of VEGF bioavailability in the mutant because recombinant VEGF can rescue Mmp9(-/-) non-unions. We also found that Mmp9(-/-) mice generate a large cartilage callus even when fractured bones are stabilized, which implicates MMP9 in the regulation of chondrogenic and osteogenic cell differentiation during early stages of repair. In conclusion, the resemblance between Mmp9(-/-) fetal skeletal defects and those that emerge during Mmp9(-/-) adult repair offer the strongest evidence to date that similar mechanisms are employed to achieve bone formation, regardless of age.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2003-07-23", "authors": ["C\u00e9lineColnot", "ZacharyThompson", "TheodoreMiclau", "ZenaWerb", "Jill AHelms"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.00559"}

Yet over time, tumor cells producing active TSP1 do eventually form exponentially growing tumors. These tumors are composed of cells secreting unusually high amounts of the angiogenic stimulator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that are sufficient to overcome the inhibitory TSP1. Here, we use short double-stranded RNA (siRNA) to trigger RNA interference and thereby impair the synthesis of VEGF and ask if this inability to produce VEGF prevents the development of TSP1 resistance. Systemic in vivo administration of crude anti-VEGF siRNA reduced the growth of unaltered fibrosarcoma tumor cells, and when the anti-VEGF siRNA was expressed from tumor cells themselves, such inhibition was synergistic with the inhibitory effects derived from TSP1 secretion by the tumor cells.

{"title": "Hypertension and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Arterial Hypertension (AH) is characterized by reduced nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosteron-System (RAAS), vasoconstriction, and microvascular rarefaction. The latter contributes to target organ damage, especially in left ventricular hypertrophy, and may partially be due to impaired angiogenesis. Angiogenesis, the formation of new microvessels and microvascular networks from existing ones, is a highly regulated process that arises in response to hypoxia and other stimuli and that relieves tissue ischemia. In AH, angiogenesis seems impaired. However, blood pressure alone does not affect angiogenesis, and microvascular rarefaction is present in normotensive persons with a family history for AH. Normal or increased NO in several processes and diseases enables or enhances angiogenesis (e.g. in portal hypertension) and reduced NO biosynthesis (for example, in a rat model of AH, in other disease models in vivo, and in endothelial NO Synthase knock out mice) impairs angiogenesis. Angiogenic growth factors such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) induce NO and require NO to elicit an effect. Effector molecules and corresponding receptors of the RAAS either induce (Bradykinin, Angiotensin II) or perhaps inhibit angiogenesis.

To determine whether lipofection in other organs could be enhanced by increasing the degree of vascularization, we used a transgenic mouse model with tissue-specific angiogenesis in liver. Tail vein injection of N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP)/cholesterol lipoplexes resulted in increased lipoplex entrapment in hypervascularized liver but did not boost luciferase expression, suggesting that lipoplex delivery is not a sufficient condition for efficient organ lipofection. Because the intravenously injected lipoplexes migrated within seconds to lungs, we checked whether the effects of immediate contact with serum correlate with lung lipofection efficiency of different DOTAP-based formulations. Under conditions mimicking the injection environment, the lipoplex-serum interaction was strongly dependent on helper lipid and ionic strength: lipoplexes prepared in 150 mM NaCl or lipoplexes with high (>33 mol%) cholesterol were found to aggregate immediately. This aggregation process was irreversible and was inversely correlated with the percentage of lung cells that took up lipoplexes and with the efficiency of lipofection. No other structural changes in serum were observed for cholesterol-based lipoplexes. Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-based lipoplexes were found to give low expression, apparently because of an immediate loss of integrity in serum, without lipid-DNA dissociation.

The spongy lyophilized material was pressed into the shape of a minidisk to make the GDF-5-collagen composite. The GDF-5-collagen composite contained 1, 10, or 100-microg rhGDF-5. The control collagen composite contained 0-microg rhGDF-5. The GDF-5-collagen composite or control collagen composite was inserted beneath the calvarial periosteum of 4-week-old rats. At 3 weeks after implantation, the implants containing 1-microg rhGDF-5 had mostly induced new bone formation on the cranial side. In the implants containing 10- microg rhGDF-5, bone formation had proceeded to the center of the GDF-5-collagen composite from the periosteal and the cranial sides, and bone marrow was seen focally. The augmented bone showed a connected trabecular structure with abundant vascularization. The implants containing 100-microg rhGDF-5 were nearly entirely replaced by new bone with bone marrow, and the augmented bone was firmly connected with the original bone. Neither cartilage nor bone formation was found in the control collagen composite. Thus, we conclude that the GDF-5-collagen composite may be a superior biomaterial for bone augmentation and this composite could be useful as a local osteoinductive device.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2003-07-19", "authors": ["HiroyaKuniyasu", "YukitoHirose", "MorioOchi", "AkihiroYajima", "KunihikoSakaguchi", "MasaruMurata", "JensPohl"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1600-0501.2003.00817.x"}

VEGF acts via a family of receptors (VEGFRs) to mediate endothelial cell proliferation, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis. The VEGF genes from independent parapoxvirus isolates show an extraordinary degree of inter-strain sequence variation. We conducted functional comparisons of five representatives of the divergent viral VEGFs. These revealed that despite the sequence divergence, all were equally active mitogens, stimulating proliferation of human endothelial cells in vitro and vascularization of sheep skin in vivo with potencies equivalent to VEGF. This was achieved even though the viral VEGFs bound VEGFR-2 less avidly than did VEGF. Surprisingly the viral VEGFs varied in their ability to cross-link VEGFR-2, induce vascular permeability and bind neuropilin-1. Correlations between these three activities were detected. In addition it was possible to correlate these functional variations with certain sequence and structural motifs specific to the viral VEGFs. In contrast to the conserved ability to bind human VEGFR-2, the viral growth factors did not bind either VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-3. We propose that the extensive sequence divergence seen in the viral VEGFs was generated primarily by selection against VEGFR-1 binding.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2003-07-18", "authors": ["Lyn MWise", "NorihitoUeda", "Nicola HDryden", "Stephen BFleming", "CarolCaesar", "SallyRoufail", "Marc GAchen", "Steven AStacker", "Andrew AMercer"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M301194200"}

The predominant indications for PKP were pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (32%) and Fuchs' dystrophy (23%). Graft failure occurred in 10% (385) of the eyes. The most common causes of secondary graft failure were endothelial failure (29%) or immunologic endothelial rejection (27%). Survival of first time grafts was 90% at 5 years and 82% at 10 years. Initial regrafts had significantly lower 5-year and 10-year survival rates, 53% and 41%, respectively. The highest 5-year and 10-year survival rates were noted in primary grafts for eyes with a preoperative diagnosis of keratoconus (97% and 92%, respectively), or Fuchs' dystrophy (97% and 90%, respectively). Primary grafts for aphakic bullous keratopathy without intraocular lens placement had the lowest 5-year survival rate, 70%.\nThe 5-year and 10-year survival rates in this series demonstrate that PKP is a safe and effective treatment for the corneal diseases commonly transplanted in the United States. However, endothelial failure and immunologic graft rejection were persistent risks over the long term, supporting the need for continued patient follow-up. Regrafts, aphakic eyes without intraocular lens placement at the time of transplant, and corneas with deep stromal vascularization had reduced graft survival rates.

Animals were maintained on insulin therapy for at least 1 month, and then islets from mixed lymphocyte reaction mismatched primates were infused into the portal vein. Immediately before the islet allotransplant and for 6 additional days, primates were infused with RATG (20 mg/kg) and given a sirolimus dose to achieve a 24-hr trough level of 8 to 14 ng/mL.\nThe regimen resulted in profound peripheral and lymph node lymphocyte depletion for up to 1 month.

ICOS blockade has disparate effects on immune responses depending on the timing of blockade. Its role in transplantation immunity, however, remains incompletely defined. We used a vascularized mouse cardiac allograft model to explore the role of ICOS signaling at different time points after transplantation, targeting immune initiation (early blockade) or the immune effector phase (delayed blockade). In major histocompatibility-mismatched recipients, ICOS blockade prolonged allograft survival using both protocols but did so more effectively in the delayed-treatment group. By contrast, in minor histocompatibility-mismatched recipients, early blockade accelerated rejection and delayed blockade prolonged graft survival. Alloreactive CD4+ T cell expansion and alloantibody production were suppressed in both treatment groups, whereas only delayed blockade resulted in suppression of effector CD8+ T cell generation. After delayed ICOS blockade, there was a diminished frequency of allospecific IL-10-producing cells and an increased frequency of both IFN-gamma- and IL-4-producing cells. The beneficial effects of ICOS blockade in regulating allograft rejection were seen in the absence of CD28 costimulation but required CD8+ cells, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, and an intact signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 pathway.

The latest innovations are self-drilling, self-tapping screws and locking miniplates. These screws offer the prospect of less instrumentation and faster application. Preclinical testing has shown them to be substantially more retentive in cancellous bone, a significant advance in cancellous block bone grafting. Locking 2.0 miniplates utilize double threaded screws which both lock to the bone and the plate creating a mini-internal fixator. This results in a more rigid construct with less distortion of the fracture or osteotomy, screws which do not loosen and less interference with bone circulation since the plate is not pressed tightly against the bone. Locking miniplates are designed for midface application in the repair of fractures, osteotomies and defects. Three configurations in a variety of shapes and lengths are available for mandibular surgery. The thinner and medium varieties are useful in transoral plating of fractures utilizing the Champy technique. The heavier, longer variety are used in unilateral edentulous fractures in the symphysis and parasymphysis as well as an aid to tumor resection and reconstruction with both free and vascularized grafts.

Conventional management entails contracture release and thick split-thickness skin grafting. We investigated an alternative approach employing dermal regeneration template (Integra) for breast reconstruction in 12 consecutive patients who had suffered anterior chest wall burns in childhood. Integra is a bilayer material consisting of a collagen and chondroitin-6-sulfate dermal regeneration template and a temporary silicone epidermal layer. Portions of the scar contracture preventing the breast from assuming the desired shape and position were excised. Unmeshed Integra sheets were applied to the wound bed immediately following excision. Sufficient vascularization of the forming neodermis occurred within 28 days on average to enable removal of the silicone layer and placement of unmeshed 0.005in. epidermal autografts. Upon histological examination one month postoperatively, naturally-formed collagen fibres were observed in the dermal regeneration template. By one year, host collagen had typically completely replaced the Integra matrix, and elastic fibres were evident throughout the neodermis. Durable improvements in breast contour and shape were attained in all patients, and clinically-relevant recontracture of the graft site did not occur within the follow-up period. A statistically significant improvement of 6.0 (95% CI, 5.0-6.5) in Vancouver Scar Scale score was demonstrated at one year. A very high level of satisfaction in the outcome of reconstruction was expressed by 92% of the patients. Grafting with Integra provides an effective and well-tolerated alter-native to thick split-thickness grafting for breast reconstruction.

Expression of three catenins was detected by Western blot analysis and histochemical staining, using the antibody to each catenin. The level of beta catenin increased during nerve regeneration in both the vascularized and non-vascularized grafts, while the level of alpha and gamma catenins did not increase in both grafts. There was no difference in the level of the three catenins between the two methods of nerve grafting. Histochemical findings showed that at the 4th and 14th postoperative weeks, alpha and gamma catenins were stained diffusely in both grafts, while beta catenin was stained around the regenerating axons in both grafts. The degree of beta catenin was greater in the 4th postoperative week than in the 14th postoperative week, but no obvious difference in the degree of staining of the three catenins between two grafts was found.

MtT/E cells are known not to produce any pituitary hormone; however, they do produce the Pit-1 protein, which is known to be a common transcription factor in thyrotropes, somatotropes, and mammotropes. Although MtT/E is a clonal cell line, it exhibits two distinct phenotypes, fibroblastic (F-) and epithelial (E-) cells. We obtained subclonal cell lines from MtT/E cells with characters similar to those of F- and E-cells and called them MtT/E-G1 and MtT/E-B3, respectively. To examine tumor formation by these cells, we implanted them into female Fischer rats. One month later, typical pituitary tumors had appeared in MtT/E-B3-implanted rats; however, tumor formation by MtT/E-G1 was delayed. Interestingly, the tumors formed by MtT/E-B3 cells were intensely vascularized. To examine changes in tumor cell morphology, we performed primary culture and found that spindle-shaped cells appeared. These spindle-shaped cells were immunopositive for the Pit-1 protein, which suggests that they originated from MtT/E-B3 cells. Interestingly, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that both tumors and the cells obtained in primary culture expressed basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). By contrast, the original MtT/E-B3 cells did not express bFGF. These results suggested that MtT/E-B3 cells show a change in phenotype during tumor formation; that is, epithelial-type cells change into bFGFexpressing fibroblastic cells.

{"title": "Effects of chronic hypoxia on fetal coronary responses.", "abstract": "This review examines the effect of high altitude and/or chronic hypoxia on cardiac mechanisms that influence perfusion of the fetal heart (e.g., tissue metabolism, coronary vessel growth, and coronary blood flow and vessel responsiveness). In response to intrauterine hypoxia, the fetal heart may either reduce its energy demand or increase its substrate and oxygen delivery as a means of sustaining cardiac function. Cardiac glycolysis predominates as a metabolic pathway of ATP synthesis in the fetal heart under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. During prolonged oxygen insufficiency, normal cardiac function is sustained by anaerobic glycolysis relying primarily on high levels of stored glycogen in the heart. Chronic hypoxia increases coronary vessel growth and myocardial vascularization in fetal hearts, although the response may depend on the presence of ventricular hypertrophy. Recent studies demonstrate that high altitude hypoxia increases both resting fetal coronary flow and coronary flow reserve as an adaptive response toward increasing oxygen delivery. Hypoxia may also directly effect local vascular smooth muscle mechanisms, resulting in altered coronary artery reactivity to circulating vasoactive substances and contributing to enhanced perfusion. Further study is needed to understand the relative importance of each of these cardiac adaptations in contributing to fetal survival. It is likely that differences in fetal coronary responses to intrauterine hypoxia are highly dependent on the gestational age and relative maturity of the animal species.", "journal": "High altitude medicine & biology", "date": "2003-07-12", "authors": ["Loren PThompson"], "doi": "10.1089/152702903322022811"}
{"title": "The placenta at high altitude.", "abstract": "The influence of oxygen pressure on placental and villous vascular development is reviewed and considered relative to the natural experiment afforded by residence at high altitude. Data obtained from normal high altitude pregnancies are compared with those from IUGR and preeclampsia, conditions believed to be caused by placental hypoxia. High altitude placentas are characterized by increased villous vascularization, thinning of the villous membranes, proliferation of the villous cytotrophoblast, and reduced perisyncytial fibrin deposition relative to low altitude placentas. The significance of reduced fibrin deposition is unknown; it could be explained by less apoptosis along the barrier membrane, less syncytiotrophoblast turnover, or altered ratios of local proversus anticoagulant production. Increased villous capillary density and thinning of the villous membranes increases oxygen diffusion capacity and is generally considered a beneficial adaptation. Nonetheless, there is evidence that hypoxia and/or reduced blood flow reduce placental nutrient transporter densities, and this may act in additive or synergistic fashion to reduce birth weight at high altitude. The available literature on high altitude placentas derives from less than 100 pregnancies from three different continents and six different ethnic groups, and were acquired in pregnancies ranging from 2500 to 4300 m in altitude. Thus differences between studies are likely to be due to variation in altitude and/or to ethnic variation, which in turn may be due to differences in population history of residence at high altitude (e.g., Andeans vs. Europeans). Nonetheless, systematic examination of human placental development under conditions of lowered maternal arterial oxygen pressure (high altitude > 2700 m) may provide useful insights into the etiology of pathological conditions believed to be associated with placental hypoxia.", "journal": "High altitude medicine & biology", "date": "2003-07-12", "authors": ["StacyZamudio"], "doi": "10.1089/152702903322022785"}
{"title": "Metastasis of transgenic breast cancer in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene-deficient mice.", "abstract": "The plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) blocks the activation of plasmin(ogen), an extracellular protease vital to cancer invasion. PAI-1 is like the corresponding plasminogen activator uPA (urokinase-type plasminogen activator) consistently expressed in human breast cancer. Paradoxically, high levels of PAI-1 as well as uPA are equally associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. PAI-1 is thought to play a vital role for the controlled extracellular proteolysis during tumor neovascularization. We have studied the effect of PAI-1 deficiency in a transgenic mouse model of metastasizing breast cancer. In these tumors, the expression pattern of uPA and PAI-1 resembles that of human ductal breast cancer and plasminogen is required for efficient metastasis. In a cohort of 63 transgenic mice that were either PAI-1-deficient or wild-type sibling controls, primary tumor growth and vascular density were unaffected by PAI-1 status. PAI-1 deficiency also did not significantly affect the lung metastatic burden. These results agree with the virtual lack of spontaneous phenotype in PAI-1-deficient mice and humans and may reflect that the plasminogen activation reaction is not rate limiting for tumor vascularization and metastasis, or that there is a functional redundancy between PAI-1 and other inhibitors of the uPA/plasmin system, masking the effect of PAI-1 deficiency.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2003-07-11", "authors": ["KasperAlmholt", "Boye SNielsen", "Thomas LFrandsen", "NilsBr\u00fcnner", "KeldDan\u00f8", "MortenJohnsen"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1206601"}
{"title": "BNF-1, a novel gene encoding a putative extracellular matrix protein, is overexpressed in tumor tissues.", "abstract": "In an effort to identify novel genes relevant to tumor angiogenesis, we compared the genes expressed in a matched pair composed of vascularized breast tumor and its adjacent normal tissue obtained from the same cancer patient. Using differential display, we identified a cDNA fragment that was reproducibly upregulated in vascularized breast tumor. Up-regulation of this gene fragment in vascularized breast tumor was further verified by semi-quantitative PCR on the same RNA pair using gene-specific primers. The cDNA encoding the full-length ORF of that gene was then cloned by both 3' and 5' RACE. Sequence analysis showed that this gene encodes an ORF of 1353 bp having a hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence and a cleavage site. We named this novel gene BNF-1 (breast tumor novel factor 1). The mature protein of this gene contains cysteine-rich repeats that are a specific feature of several extracellular matrix proteins including thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-2, pro-collagen type 1, and von Willebrand Factor 1. PCR analysis of BNF-1 expression in a variety of human adult normal tissues revealed that BNF-1 is expressed predominantly in liver, heart, prostate, testis, and ovary. To further study the expression pattern of this novel gene in tumor tissues, we extended our analysis to additional matched pairs of tumor tissues obtained from breast, lung, and colon cancer patients. We show here that BNF-1 is over-expressed not only in breast tumors but also in lung and colon tumors.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2003-07-11", "authors": ["InminWu", "Marsha AMoses"], "doi": "10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00563-8"}
{"title": "Cellular mechanisms in retinal vascular development.", "abstract": "Since the pioneering work of Ashton and others, the primate retina has been thought to vascularize by a vasculogenic linkage of endothelial precursor cells. Recent investigations using specific histologic and morphologic criteria question the contribution of vasculogenesis to retinal development. Instead, in primates and mice cells previously designated as retinal angioblasts have been identified as astrocytes that form a vascular-like plexus preceding vessel invasion. Further, in primates and mice retinal vascularization proceeds via angiogenic sprouting from pre-existing vessels in all regions and stages. However, the developing retinal vasculature may utilize novel sources of endothelial cells, such as recruitment of circulating stem cells and redeployment of mural cells from regressing vessel segments.

{"title": "Comparative studies of high performance swimming in sharks I. Red muscle morphometrics, vascularization and ultrastructure.", "abstract": "Tunas (family Scombridae) and sharks in the family Lamnidae are highly convergent for features commonly related to efficient and high-performance (i.e. sustained, aerobic) swimming. High-performance swimming by fishes requires adaptations augmenting the delivery, transfer and utilization of O(2) by the red myotomal muscle (RM), which powers continuous swimming. Tuna swimming performance is enhanced by a unique anterior and centrally positioned RM (i.e. closer to the vertebral column) and by structural features (relatively small fiber diameter, high capillary density and greater myoglobin concentration) increasing O(2) flux from RM capillaries to the mitochondria. A study of the structural and biochemical features of the mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) RM was undertaken to enable performance-capacity comparisons of tuna and lamnid RM. Similar to tunas, mako RM is positioned centrally and more anterior in the body. Another lamnid, the salmon shark (Lamna ditropis), also has this RM distribution, as does the closely related common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus; family Alopiidae). However, in both the leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata) and the blue shark (Prionace glauca), RM occupies the position where it is typically found in most fishes; more posterior and along the lateral edge of the body. Comparisons among sharks in this study revealed no differences in the total RM quantity (approximately 2-3% of body mass) and, irrespective of position within the body, RM scaling is isometric in all species. Sharks thus have less RM than do tunas (4-13% of body mass). Relative to published data on other shark species, mako RM appears to have a higher capillary density, a greater capillary-to-fiber ratio and a higher myoglobin concentration. However, mako RM fiber size does not differ from that reported for other shark species and the total volume of mitochondria in mako RM is similar to that reported for other sharks and for tunas. Lamnid RM properties thus suggest a higher O(2) flux capacity than in other sharks; however, lamnid RM aerobic capacity appears to be less than that of tuna RM.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2003-07-09", "authors": ["DBernal", "CSepulveda", "OMathieu-Costello", "J BGraham"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.00481"}

As this reconstructed skin lacks any endothelial cells, our aim in this study was to develop an angiogenic reconstructed skin model in which to explore strategies to improve angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We report that culture of small-vessel human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HuDMECs) was achieved using magnetic beads coated with an antibody to platelet cell adhesion molecule as a means of purifying the culture. Keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and HuDMECs could be cultured from the same skin biopsy. Initial studies culturing HuDMECs and other sources of endothelial cells with the tissue-engineered skin showed that these cells were capable of slowly entering the dermis under standard culture conditions in vitro.

Clinically, precise dissection of brain parenchyma and various tumors was performed without complications. Even in meningiomas, with their very variable firmness, vascularization, and adherence to the surrounding brain, accurate dissection could be achieved. However, while tumor separation from the brain was attained with high accuracy and vessel preservation in all cases, only in softer lesions resection by aspiration under vessel preservation was possible with pressures below 20 bar.

{"title": "Sonographic evaluation of brachial plexus pathology.", "abstract": "Pre-operative US examinations of the brachial plexus were performed with the purpose of exploring the potential of this technique in recognizing lesions in the region and defining their sonographic morphology, site, extent, and relations to adjacent anatomic structures, and comparing them to the surgical findings to obtain maximal confirmation. Twenty-eight patients with clinical, electro-conductive, and imaging findings suggestive of brachial plexus pathology were included in this study. There were four main etiology groups: post-traumatic brachial plexopathies; primary tumors (benign and malignant); secondary tumors; and post irradiation injuries. Twenty-one of the 28 patients underwent surgery. Advanced imaging (mostly MRI) served as an alternative gold standard for confirmation of the findings in the non-surgically treated group of patients. The US examinations were performed with conventional US units operating at 5- to 10-MHz frequencies. The nerves were initially localized at the level of the vertebral foramina and then were followed longitudinally and axially down to the axillary region. Abnormal US findings were detected in 20 of 28 patients. Disruption of nerve continuity and focal scar tissue masses were the principal findings in the post-traumatic cases. Focal masses within a nerve or adjacent to it and diffuse thickening of the nerve were the findings in primary and secondary tumors. Post-irradiation changes presented as nerve thickening. Color Doppler was useful in detecting internal vascularization within masses and relation of a mass to adjacent vessels. The eight sonographically negative cases consisted either of traumatic neuromas smaller than 12 mm in size and located in relatively small branches of posterior location or due to fibrotic changes of diffuse nature. Sonography succeeded in depicting a spectrum of lesions of traumatic, neoplastic, and inflammatory nature in the brachial plexus. It provided useful information regarding the lesion site, extent, and anatomic relationships; thus, the principal aims of the study were therefore met. Once the technique of examination is mastered, sonography should be recommended as part of the pre-operative evaluation process post-ganglionic brachial plexus pathology. Most disadvantages are related to the restricted field of view and inability to overcome bonny obstacles particularly in evaluating pre-ganglionic region.

As BK virus (BKV) sequences were found in 100% of primary KS and 75% of KS cell lines, we established an experimental model to test whether BKV may be involved in the pathogenesis of KS. For this purpose, we transformed primary and spontaneously immortalized murine endothelial cells with BKV or with a plasmid containing BKV early region, which encodes BKV T antigen. Murine endothelial cells lost endothelial markers after transformation by BKV and, when inoculated s.c. in nude mice, induced tumors which regressed 7-30 days after onset, whereas spontaneously immortalized murine endothelial MHE cells induced progressing tumors, which brought the animals to death. Histologic examination showed an initial formation of vessels around the tumors, followed by the appearance of a dense population of fibroblasts and mononuclear cells in the peritumoral tissue. Subsequently, tumors appeared to be infiltrated by mononuclear cells and surrounded by a thick fibrous wall with scattered fibroblasts and without vessels. Areas of necrosis developed in the tumor mass and finally the neoplastic tissue completely degenerated. The medium conditioned by BKV-transformed cells induced proliferation and migration of human fibroblasts and NIH3T3 cells. These effects were inhibited by an anti-transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) antibody. Northern blot analysis revealed that BKV-transformed cells express a greater amount of TGF-beta1 RNA than normal murine endothelial cells. Besides, TGF-beta1 was not expressed in progressing tumors induced by spontaneously immortalized endothelial MHE cells, whereas it was highly expressed during the regression of tumors induced by BKV-transformed MHE and primary endothelial cells. Over-expression of TGF-beta1 may be responsible for the mononuclear cell infiltration, inhibition of angiogenesis and formation of the fibrotic wall around tumors, inducing tumor regression through tumor cell necrosis and nutritional starvation. These results prompt us to test whether production of TGF-beta1 is associated with spontaneous KS regression in human patients. In this case, KS regression could be induced or accelerated by any means that enhances TGF-beta1 production at the tumor site.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2003-07-08", "authors": ["AlfredoCorallini", "LauraPossati", "CeciliaTrabanelli", "EnricoGiraudo", "RominaRocchetti", "SimonaTalevi", "AntonellaCaputo", "FedericoBussolino", "GiuseppeBarbanti-Brodano"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgg096"}

To investigate the mechanisms responsible for survival of blood vessels in the developing retina, we characterized two VEGF-A receptors, VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1, also known as Flt-1) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, also known as Flk-1). Surprisingly, these two VEGF-A receptors differed markedly during normal retinal development in mice. At 5 days postpartum (P5), VEGFR-1 protein was colocalized with retinal vessels, whereas VEGFR-2 was detected only in the neural retina. Real-time RT-PCR identified a 60-fold induction of VEGFR-1 mRNA in retina from P3 (early vascularization) to P26 (fully vascularized), and no significant change in VEGFR-2 mRNA expression. Placental growth factor-1 (PlGF-1), which exclusively binds VEGFR-1, decreased hyperoxia-induced retinal vaso-obliteration from 22.2% to 5.1%, whereas VEGF-E, which exclusively binds VEGFR-2, had no effect on blood vessel survival. Importantly, under the same conditions, PlGF-1 did not increase vasoproliferation during (a). normal vessel growth, (b). revascularization following hyperoxia-induced ischemia, or (c). the vasoproliferative phase, indicating a selective function supporting blood vessel survival.

Previously, the lack of defined oligosaccharides has limited the exploration of these sugars as components of new therapeutics. The Pasteurella multocida HA synthase, pmHAS, a polymerizing enzyme that normally elongates HA chains rapidly (approximately 1-100 sugars/s), was converted by mutagenesis into two single-action glycosyltransferases (glucuronic acid transferase and N-acetylglucosamine transferase).

ErbB receptors (ErbB-1/epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4) were stably overexpressed in a polyclonal cell population as single or paired combinations using murine and human breast cell models. The overall numbers of known genes that are up- or down-regulated was significantly higher in cells and tumors overexpressing paired combinations of receptors compared with cells and tumors overexpressing single ErbB receptors. Genes encoding components of cell-cell structures, extracellular matrix, coagulation factors, and angiogenesis were predominantly affected by the most active ErbB receptor combinations and were predictive of the aggressive in vivo tumorigenicity, a feature that was not always seen in vitro. Among ErbB-regulated tumor microenvironment markers detected by the genomic analysis, thrombospondin 1, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, was additionally validated in relation to tumor growth phenotype. Thrombospondin 1 mRNA and protein were down-regulated by specific ErbB receptors, in vitro and in both rodent and human ErbB-induced tumors, consistent with the extent of tumor growth and tumor vascularization associated with specific ErbB receptors.

To understand the biologic features of an adhesion, the gene expressions in adhesive subacromial bursa were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The gene expressions in adhesive subacromial bursae were approximately threefold to fourfold greater than those in nonadhesive bursae for the genes for Type I and Type III procollagens, CD34 antigen in vascular endothelium, hyaluronan synthase-3, and interferon-gamma. The gene expression of interleukin-8 was predominant in adhesive bursa. The gene expressions of hyaluronan synthase-1, hyaluronan synthase-2, and interleukin-10 which is an antiadhesive cytokine were predominant in nonadhesive bursae. Chromatography analysis revealed that a hyaluronan, of which molecular weight was more than 100 kDa, was present in the cavity of nonadhesive subacromial bursae. It is suggested that pathologic fibrosis and vascularization are maintained by the presence of interferon-gamma and interleukin-8 in adhesive subacromial bursae and that high molecular weight hyaluronan or interleukin-10 plays a role for antiadhesion.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2003-07-03", "authors": ["MYoshida", "HFunasaki", "MSaito", "KKajitani", "KFujii"], "doi": "10.1097/01.blo.0000071757.07450.3f"}

Following the healing periods of 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months, the specimens were prepared with a combination of a microvascular cast method and a freeze-fracture technique, allowing observations to be made with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Under SEM, osteogenesis among the HA particles developed in a programmed sequence. The unfolding sequence revealed that the sinusoidal capillaries provided the initial evidence of vascularization preceding new bone formation, with microvessels creeping along the interparticular space among the HA particles. Having established an intimate contact existing between the microvessels, collagen fibres and the HA surface, the HA particles served as a supporting scaffold for the vessels to creep over and to connect with each other to form a vascular network. The way that the collagen fibres attached to the HA particles was either through globular depositions or via directly abutting themselves on to the HA surface. On closer inspection the osteoblasts with extracellular collagen fibrils were observed over the HA surface. By appositional growth, osteoblasts laid down a bone matrix in successive layers, forming a woven bone around the HA particles. As the implantation time increased, bony tissues gradually transformed into mature bone occupying all of the interparticular space. This study successfully revealed the spatial relationship between bone cells, collagen fibres and blood vessels in an osteogenetic sequence among HA particles, as revealed by a microvascular cast and the freeze-fracture method.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2003-07-02", "authors": ["Yih-WenGung", "Cheng-KungCheng", "Chen-YaoSu"], "doi": "10.1016/s1350-4533(03)00075-4"}
{"title": "Comparative anatomical study of the gracilis and coracobrachialis muscles: implications for facial reanimation.", "abstract": "Since the introduction of cross-facial nerve grafting and free vascularized muscle transfer for the treatment of longstanding facial paralysis, substantial progress has been made toward restoration of facial expression that is as normal as possible. Much of the focus has remained on the gracilis as a donor muscle. However, its inherent anatomical characteristics may preclude it from ever being more than simply a mass of contractile tissue in the face. The coracobrachialis muscle, which is the analogue in the arm of the lower limb adductor mass, was proposed as an alternative donor muscle because it was thought that certain features would allow it to improve on the overall results that are currently possible with the gracilis. A comparative anatomical study was conducted to gauge this potential. A total of 133 muscles were analyzed, including 96 dissected specimens, 16 arterial and 14 venous study specimens, and seven neurovascular study specimens. Anatomical parameters were recorded for each muscle and later tabulated. Histological analysis of the nerves to 10 gracilis and 10 coracobrachialis muscles was performed, and the findings were confirmed with intraneural dissection of an additional 20 nerves under an operating microscope. The coracobrachialis was observed to be a practical alternative to the gracilis. Indeed, it has many of the attributes that initially drew attention to the gracilis as a possible donor muscle, including a reliable neurovascular supply, minimal donor-site morbidity, and the option of having two teams operate simultaneously. In addition, it has a size, shape, and form that make it an excellent choice for transfer to the face. It could be easily attached in the face to provide static support as well as animation, because of its long proximal tendon, the thick intermuscular septum along its lateral surface, and, when present, the ligament of Struthers.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2003-07-02", "authors": ["G IanTaylor", "AdamCichowitz", "Soon GheeAng", "SugithaSeneviratne", "MarkAshton"], "doi": "10.1097/01.PRS.0000065909.86735.F7"}
{"title": "Treatment of the hands and feet in Apert syndrome: an evolution in management.", "abstract": "Apert syndrome is a relatively uncommon condition that is instantly recognizable on the basis of the pan-syndactylies involving both the hands and feet. For more than 10 years, the treatment of Apert syndrome hand and foot anomalies was approached in a comprehensive manner, with attempts to maximize the final results and minimize the total number of operations. Numerous conventions were abandoned in the development of this approach, with the introduction of some new methodologies, including (1) release of all 10 fingers, and toes, in only two operations, (2) elimination of routine digital amputations, (3) abandonment of the zigzag incision in favor of straight-line release, (4) substitution of equal-length anterior and posterior flaps for the long dorsal web space lining flap, (5) leaving of small areas of exposed bone without vascularized tissue coverage, and (6) performance of midphalangeal osteotomies, among older children, to improve hand function. Fifty-seven children with Apert syndrome have been treated at the author's center since 1990, and 43 underwent surgical treatment of their hands and feet by a single surgeon. Treatment can be separated into two phases, early (syndactyly releases) and late (functional osteotomies). Seventeen of those 43 patients were treated at the author's center from birth (type I, 11 patients; type II, two patients; type III, four patients), and 10 fingers and 10 toes were achieved for all patients in two operations. No digital amputations were performed for any of the 43 patients. However, four of 26 patients (15 percent) not treated at the author's center from birth had undergone at least one digital amputation before coming to the center. Twenty-two of those 26 patients required a two-stage syndactyly release to accomplish the separation of all 10 fingers and toes. Aside from the patients who had previously undergone amputations, all other patients successfully achieved 10 fingers and toes, except for one patient (38 of 39 patients, 97 percent). The average operative time for the first-stage syndactyly release of the hands and feet was 4 hours 11 minutes (range, 185 to 300 minutes), and that for the second stage was 3 hours 49 minutes (range, 160 to 300 minutes). Twenty-eight hands were treated with functional osteotomies, which involved permanent angulation of the fused phalanges at the proximal interphalangeal level, to create a \"position of function\" and provide pulp-to-pulp pinch. In addition, targeted osteotomies of the feet were performed for many of these patients, to decrease pain with walking. There were no major complications. Minor complications included one reexploration because of bleeding, early in the series. There were 13 incomplete secondary syndactylies that required a subsequent operative release (10 spaces treated at the author's center and three treated elsewhere), of a total of 342 spaces (3 percent author incidence). There were no scar contractures or functional limitations that required release. This distinctive protocol seemed to result in improved functional outcomes, with a reduction in the total number of operative procedures.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2003-07-02", "authors": ["Jeffrey AFearon"], "doi": "10.1097/01.PRS.0000065908.60382.17"}

Compounds that target either the integrins implicated in these interactions or the proteases responsible for matrix remodeling have been shown to halt tumor growth in murine models and are now in clinical trials.

{"title": "Antiangiogenic therapy against experimental glioblastoma using genetically engineered cells producing interferon-alpha, angiostatin, or endostatin.", "abstract": "Inhibition of angiogenesis has been considered among the most promising approaches to treat highly vascularized solid tumors such as glioblastoma. In this study, we designed and validated a new in vitro assay system based on the implantation of tumor cells into organotypic brain slice cultures. We evaluated the effects of local production of three endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, angiostatin, endostatin, and interferon (IFN)-alpha(1), using stably transfected rat (9L) and human (GL15) glioblastoma cells on tumor vascularization and growth. Despite similar effectiveness of the three proteins in a classic in vitro endothelial cell migration assay, IFN-alpha(1) demonstrated the most potent antiangiogenic effect in organotypic brain slice cultures. In vivo, after intracerebral implantation of such genetically modified glioblastoma cells, IFN-alpha(1) caused a dramatic decrease in tumor volume revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and by postmortem histology. The mechanisms of this antitumor effect were most likely caused by the major antiangiogenic action of the cytokine, because IFN-alpha(1) expression provoked a pronounced decrease in blood vessel density, which was accompanied by extensive necrosis in the body mass of the tumors. The median survival time of rats implanted intracerebrally with IFN-alpha-expressing 9L cells tripled, and was still significantly increased when these constituted only 1% of transplanted tumor cells. A similar effect was seen when 50% of the transplanted cells were replaced by IFN-alpha-expressing bone marrow stromal cells.

High levels of pro-MMP-9, pro-MMP-2, and active MMP-2 were detected in most canine tumors.

Unilateral ischaemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by permanent occlusion of the distal left middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Animals with stroke were kept alive for 1, 7, 14, 21 or 28 days after which time they were terminally anaesthetized. Vascular casts of infarcted areas, analyzed by scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that radially arranged neocortical arterioles and venules lost their regular patterns within one day of occlusion, and soon afterwards started to form a very dense network of anastomosing microvessels. At 1 week, vascular budding was visible at many sites. The smallest microvessels (4-10 microm) formed connections with the surrounding proliferating vessels similar to those in the normal brain. Survival of microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) was studied by double labeling of tissue sections using immunohistochemistry and antibodies to caspase-3, and TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells. ECs demonstrated intensive staining for caspase-3 and also staining by TUNEL, particularly near the infarct border, 14 days post-MCAO. These data support the hypothesis that growing blood vessels in ischaemic tissue form new connections, the pattern of which is similar to that in normal rat brain, but different to those formed in growing tumours.

They are similar to the porous basic structure and imitate the biological behavior of coralline implants. This article presents own clinical experience with hydroxyapatite implants from 1993 to 2003 and compares own results and other porous orbital implants in the international scientific literature.\nThe original hydroxyapatite implant is well tolerated and implant extrusion is rare. A retrospective analysis of 357 patients regarding this complication shows an extrusion rate of 2.6% over 10 years. The subjective positive tolerance of 71.2% corresponds to the results of international studies. After several stages of development the synthetic product (FCI3) is now comparable with the original product with regard to operative complications and subjective compatibility. Both orbital implants should be used with a protective covering to avoid premature extrusion and to facilitate suturing the extraocular muscles anterior. When using material from humane donors the material must be guaranteed to be completely sterile. The use of vicryl as an orbital plomb wrapping leads to contradictory reports in the literature. Hydroxyapatite ceramics in combination with silicone india rubber represent an alternative to the materials listed above and in this case a wrapping of the orbital plomb is unnecessary. Spherical orbital implants made of aluminum oxide (bioceramic implant) are an alternative to corraline hydroxyapatite implants. Because of their porous,crystalline structure bioceramic implants vascularize well. Porous polythylene orbital implants,which are not available in Germany, are economical, but due to their porosity and vascularization properties they are not comparable with pure hydroxyapatite or hydroxyapatite ceramics.\nThe dynamic development of the infant anopthalmus adapted to the size growth of the orbita and the exact volume replenishment of the adult orbita cannot yet be fulfilled with the presently available porous hydroxyapatite materials and is the subject of future research.", "journal": "Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft", "date": "2003-06-24", "authors": ["A GNorda", "H-WMeyer-R\u00fcsenberg"], "doi": "10.1007/s00347-003-0832-0"}

Since GPCRs play a crucial role in cellular communication and chemokine receptors play a prominent role in the immune system, the virally encoded GPCRs may be crucial determinants of viral action. The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, or human herpesvirus 8), implicated in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a highly vascularized tumor, encodes a GPCR, referred to as ORF74. This virally encoded receptor was found to induce tumorigenesis and transgenic expression of ORF74 induces an angioproliferative disease resembling KS. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), suggested to play a role in atherosclerosis, encodes four GPCRs, among which US28. This virally encoded GPCR is able to induce migration of smooth muscle cells, a feature essential for the development of atherosclerosis. Remarkably, the KSHV and some CMV-encoded GPCRs display constitutive activity, while their cellular homologs do not. It remains to be determined whether this phenomenon contributes to the pathogenesis of viral action. Also, the family of poxviruses encodes GPCRs of which the function is not clear yet.

For MRA a dedicated high-resolution three-dimensional gradient echo pulse sequence with a voxel size of 166 x 206 x 320 microm(3) was performed after injection of Gadomer-17. The image analysis included a correlation of intratumoral vessels with histology. Signal intensity measurements were performed in the vena cava, the tumor underlying muscle, and in various regions of the tumor. Signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR) and contrast-to-noise-ratios (CNR) were calculated from this measurement.\nHigh-resolution MRA allowed a clear distinction of intratumoral blood vessels. The mouse tumor model tended to be strongly vascularized with several intratumoral blood vessels clearly displayed by MRA. When correlated with histology, these intratumoral blood vessels had a size in the range of 300 to 400 microm. In contrast, rat tumors had only sparse capillary intratumoral blood vessels that could only be demonstrated by histology. In both tumor models, dilated blood vessels were observed in the subcutaneous tissue near the tumor. In general, areas with a strong contrast enhancement correlated with viable, well vascularized tumor regions, whereas non-enhancing tumor areas correlated with tumor necrosis or hypoxic areas.\nHigh-resolution three-dimensional MRA allows the visualization of intratumoral vasculature in rodent models.

To gain insights into VEGF-driven neovascularization in the adult, in general, and to uncover inherent obstacles in VEGF-based therapeutic angiogenesis, we have used a transgenic system for conditional \"on\" and \"off\" switching of VEGF expression in selected adult organs and analytical methods for three-dimensional visualization of the induced vascular network. VEGF induces massive accumulation of endothelial progenitor cells and their subsequent coalescence into new vascular loops. Continual ramification of the vasculature and fusion of adjacent vessels culminate in formation of hemangioma-like vessels. In the absence of guiding cues, abnormal branching patterns and random connections with the existing network are formed. Following cessation of the VEGF stimulus, the acquired network undergoes extensive hemodynamic remodeling acting to \"normalize\" its architecture. Premature withdrawal of VEGF leads to regression of most acquired vessels, thus challenging the utility of therapeutic approaches relying on short stimulus duration. Overproduction of VEGF leads also to highly disruptive edema, thereby emphasizing the need to uncouple VEGF-induced permeability from its angiogenic activity.

{"title": "How proteases regulate bone morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade most components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as many non-ECM molecules. MMPs participate in (1). degradation of ECM to allow cell migration; (2). alteration of the ECM microenvironment resulting in alteration in cellular behavior; (3). modulation of biologically active molecules by direct cleavage or release from ECM stores; (4). regulation of the activity of other proteases; and (5). cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We have sought to understand the role of MMPs during development and tissue repair in transgenic mice. Endochondral bone formation presents a particularly interesting developmental challenge. During this process, an avascular tissue (cartilage) is converted into one of the most highly vascularized tissues (bone) in the vertebrate body. Ossification begins with invasion of the calcified hypertrophic cartilage by capillaries. Apoptosis of the terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes, degradation of the cartilage matrix, and deposition of bone matrix by osteoblasts accompanies neovascularization of the growth plate. Remodeling of ECM results in a cavity filled with vascular channels containing hematopoietic cells. Our results reveal that MMP9, MMP13, and vascular endothelial growth factor are key regulators for the remodeling of the skeletal tissues.

Gene targeting studies in mice have identified a large number of genes that are essential for chorioallantoic development to give rise to the layer of the placenta called the labyrinth. Collectively, these studies reveal that a number of signaling pathways regulate four distinct phases of labyrinth development: chorioallantoic attachment (involving VCAM1 and its receptor alpha4 integrin, Bmp5/7, and Wnt7b, as well as the cochaperone Mrj), initiation of branching (involving the Gcm1 transcription factor to select sites of branch initiation), extension of villous branching (involving FGF, EGF, and HGF/Met signaling, through the Grb2/Sos1/Mek1/p38alpha MAPK pathway), followed by vascularization of the villous tree.

Because pancreatic endocrine cells or islets express high levels of vascular endothelial growth factors, VEGFs, we investigated the role of a particular VEGF, VEGF-A, on islet vascularization and islet function. By deleting VEGF-A in the mouse pancreas, we show that endocrine cells signal back to the adjacent endothelial cells to induce the formation of a dense network of fenestrated capillaries in islets. Interestingly, VEGF-A is not required for the development of all islet capillaries. However, the few remaining capillaries found in the VEGF-A-deficient islets are not fenestrated and contain an unusual number of caveolae. In addition, glucose tolerance tests reveal that the VEGF-A-induced capillary network is not strictly required for blood glucose control but is essential for fine-tuning blood glucose regulation. In conclusion, we speculate that islet formation takes place in two sequential steps: in the first step, signals from blood vessel endothelium induce islet formation next to the vessels, and in the second step, the islets signal to the endothelium. The second step involves paracrine VEGF-A signaling to elaborate the interaction of islets with the circulatory system.", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "date": "2003-06-20", "authors": ["EckhardLammert", "GuqiangGu", "MargaretMcLaughlin", "DennisBrown", "RolfBrekken", "Lewis CharlesMurtaugh", "Hans PeterGerber", "NapoleoneFerrara", "Douglas AMelton"], "doi": "10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00378-6"}

{"title": "Altitude is a phenotypic modifier in hereditary paraganglioma type 1: evidence for an oxygen-sensing defect.", "abstract": "Hereditary paraganglioma type 1 (PGL1) is characterized by slow-growing and vascularized tumors that often develop in the carotid body (CB) and is caused by mutations in the gene for succinate dehydrogenase D ( SDHD) of mitochondrial complex II. The mechanisms of tumorigenesis and the factors affecting penetrance and expressivity are unknown. Because chronic hypoxic stimulation at high altitudes causes sporadic CB paragangliomas, it has been hypothesized that the SDHD gene product may be involved in oxygen sensing. On this background, we examined genotype-phenotype-environment relationships and tested whether higher altitudes adversely affect the phenotype in PGL1. An analysis of 58 subjects from 23 families revealed that nonsense/splicing mutation carriers developed symptoms 8.5 years earlier than missense mutation carriers ( P<0.012). We also found that subjects who were diagnosed with single tumors at their first clinical evaluation lived at lower average altitudes and were exposed to lower altitude-years than those with multiple tumors ( P<0.012). Pheochromocytomas developed in six subjects (approximately 10%), five of whom had nonsense mutations ( P=0.052). Subjects with pheochromocytomas also lived at higher average altitudes and were exposed to higher altitude-years than those without them ( P=0.026). To test whether altitude is also associated with the more frequent detection of germ-line founder mutations among sporadic cases in The Netherlands than in the USA ( P=0.00033), we calculated population-weighted elevations of the two countries. We found that the population-weighted elevations were approximately 260 m for the US and 2 m for the central-western Netherlands ( P~0), where three Dutch founder mutations were discovered. This finding suggests that low altitudes in The Netherlands reduce penetrance and relax the natural selection on SDHD mutations. Collectively, these data suggest that higher altitudes and nonsense/splicing mutations are associated with phenotypic severity in PGL1 and support the hypothesis that SDHD mutations impair oxygen sensing.", "journal": "Human genetics", "date": "2003-06-18", "authors": ["KristinAstrom", "Joel ECohen", "Joan EWillett-Brozick", "Christopher EAston", "Bora EBaysal"], "doi": "10.1007/s00439-003-0969-6"}

To examine whether an isolated intestinal segment will support development of a heterotopic auxiliary liver, we studied the fate of liver microfragments in rats.\nSmall intestinal segments with intact circulation were created, and the small intestinal mucosa was removed. The intestinal segments were filled with autologous liver microfragments, and animals were studied for various periods.\nInitially, liver microfragments were engulfed by a serosanguineous exudate enriched in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, suggesting an early granulation-type response. Transplanted liver fragments were subsequently reorganized and showed morphologic integrity with typical hepatic lobular organization. Transplanted tissue contained healthy hepatocytes with abundant glycogen content. Transplanted liver remained intact in the small intestine for up to 40 days, although at later times portal fibrosis and bile ductular proliferation were apparent, despite the absence of cholestasis or hepatocellular abnormalities. In contrast, instillation of liver microfragments in the peritoneal cavity led to rapid loss of tissue integrity and phagocytotic clearance of transplanted tissue.\nSmall intestinal segments denuded of the mucosal layer can support heterotopically transplanted liver.

We then evaluated bone and vessel histomorphometry in secondary spongiosae by infusing vessels with a mixture of India ink/barium sulfate after 7 and 14 days of OVX. After 7 days expression of angiogenic and vasodilator factors decreased, concomitant with a decrease in the bone vessel number and possibly area. After 14 days all factors except FGF-2 exhibited either increased or normalized expression, which was associated with the stimulation of both bone formation and resorption. 17beta-Estradiol administration for 7 or 14 days prevented not only the OVX-induced changes in bone remodeling but also the morphological alterations observed in bone vessels.

Similarly, high expression levels were found in Huh-7 and HepG2 human tumor xenografts in SCID mice after systemic application of surface-shielded EGF-PEG-PEI/DNA complexes. Significant DNA uptake but low gene expression were found in the M-3 melanoma while no DNA uptake and no gene expression were found in KB, 518A2, A549, and SW480 xenograft tumor models. To elucidate the reasons for these differences, the tumors were analyzed for vascularization and infiltration of macrophages. Neuro2a, Huh-7, and HepG2 tumors are well vascularized, with a high density of partially immature blood vessels and low numbers of infiltrating macrophages. The M-3 melanoma is well vascularized correlating with significant DNA uptake, however, necrosis and intensive infiltration by macrophages lead to rapid degradation of DNA. In contrast, the KB, 518A2, A549, and SW480 tumors are poorly vascularized, correlating with undetectable DNA uptake and gene expression. Using two different vector systems the data indicate that gene delivery to tumors in vivo is affected by tissue-dependent factors.

{"title": "A novel interleukin-17 receptor-like protein identified in human umbilical vein endothelial cells antagonizes basic fibroblast growth factor-induced signaling.", "abstract": "We have previously utilized a combination of high throughput sequencing and genome-wide microarray profiling analyses to identify novel cell-surface proteins expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. One gene identified by this approach encodes a type I transmembrane receptor that shares sequence homology with the intracellular domain of members of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) receptor family. Real-time quantitative PCR and Northern analyses revealed that this gene is highly expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in several highly vascularized tissues such as kidney, colon, skeletal muscle, heart, and small intestine. In addition, we also found that it is also highly expressed in the ductal epithelial cells of human salivary glands, seminal vesicles, and the collecting tubules of the kidney by in situ hybridization. This putative receptor, which we have termed human SEF (hSEF), is also expressed in a variety of breast cancer tissues. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, this receptor is capable of forming homomeric complexes and can interact with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 1. Overexpression of this receptor inhibits FGF induction of an FGF-responsive reporter gene in human 293T cells. This appears to occur as a result of specific inhibition of p42/p44 ERK in the absence of upstream MEK inhibition. This inhibitory effect is dependent upon a functional intracellular domain since deletion mutants missing the IL-17 receptor-like domain lack this inhibitory effect. These findings are consistent with the recent discovery of the zebrafish homologue, Sef (similar expression to fgf genes), which specifically antagonizes FGF signaling when ectopically expressed in zebrafish or Xenopus laevis embryos. Based on sequence and functional similarities, this novel IL-17 receptor homologue represents a potential human SEF and is likely to play critical roles in endothelial or epithelial functions such as proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2003-06-17", "authors": ["Ruey-BingYang", "Chi Kin DomingosNg", "Scott MWasserman", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 GK\u00f6m\u00fcves", "Mary EGerritsen", "James NTopper"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M305022200"}
{"title": "[Therapeutic perspectives in heart failure]].", "abstract": "Many different diseases may lead to heart failure. Nevertheless, the symptoms and pathophysiological changes in heart failure are uniform as are the basic principles of treatment. Although significant progress has been achieved in understanding the biology of heart failure and the therapeutic options, the quality of life of heart failure patients and their survival are often poor. Since cardiac transplantation as a final therapeutic option is limited by the availability of donor organs, new strategies and technologies need to be explored to treat the failing heart effectively. Approaches to improve the medical therapy of heart failure mainly focus on strategies to escape the vicious circle of decreased contractility and neurohumoral activation. Substances with promising experimental and clinical results include neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, endothelin antagonists or cytokine inhibitors, e.g. TNF antagonists. Mechanical and electrical devices are under development such as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), biventricular pacemakers and artificial hearts, which may become valuable alternative therapies. Gene therapy approaches aim to improve the vascularization of the heart, the Ca-homeostasis of the myocytes or the survival of cardiac cells in disease. Finally, cellular cardiomyoplasty is a relatively novel approach to replace or support the cardiomyocytes of the diseased heart by implanting new ones. Which cell type under which conditions will turn out to be the most suitable is still unknown and subject to debate. Ongoing clinical studies will only help to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of this technique but not determine its long-term efficacy. It is highly desirable that one of these new therapeutic strategies or a combination of them will have a significant impact on the future management of heart failure. Currently, our main clinical focus must be to treat as many patients as possible with drugs that are known to improve symptoms and survival, like ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, cardiac glycosides, diuretics and spironolactone.", "journal": "Zeitschrift fur arztliche Fortbildung und Qualitatssicherung", "date": "2003-06-17", "authors": ["JochenM\u00fcller-Ehmsen", "Robert HSchwinger"], "doi": null}

They identified a total of 95 cutaneous perforators of the peroneal artery greater then 0.3 mm in 20 legs. The average number of cutaneous perforators was 4.8 (range: three to seven) per leg. The cutaneous perforators were either musculocutaneous (34 percent) or septocutaneous (66 percent). The musculocutaneous perforators were found predominantly in the upper two-thirds of the lower leg; the septocutaneous perforators were located in the lower two-thirds of the leg. The external diameter of the cutaneous perforators at the posterior border of the fibula was 0.6 (range: 0.3 to 1.5) mm. The blood supply of the proximal fibula epiphysis and fibula head was found not to be in the vascular territory of the peroneal artery. These results are the basis of the established osteoseptocutaneous fibula transfer, the peroneal fasciocutaneous free flap, and the double-paddle peroneal tissue transfer that all require dissection of highly vascularized tissue adjacent to the fibula, in order to reach the peroneal vessels.

The animals were exposed 6 h/d, 5 d/w for 4 weeks to (a) broadband noise centered at 8 kHz (92 or 97dB SPL), or b) styrene (700 ppm). Auditory sensitivity was tested by recording evoked potentials from the inferior colliculus. Histological analyses of the organ of Corti, stria vascularis, and the spiral ganglions were also performed. Aged controls showed outer hair cell (OHC) loss at the basal and apical regions of the organ of Corti, and an increase in pigmentation concomitant to a decrease in vascularization of the stria vascularis, along with elevated thresholds relative to young controls. The 92-dB noise caused similar threshold shifts in both age groups, whereas the 97-dB noise caused more threshold shifts in the aged group compared to the young group. Recovery of the hearing thresholds depended both on the intensity of the noise and on the age of the animals. Aged rats had minimal hair cell loss as a result of styrene exposure, whereas young animals showed significant OHC loss, particularly in third row. Despite significant loss of OHCs, the young subjects showed styrene-induced threshold shifts only at high frequencies. In summary, the data show that : (a) there is an influence of age on both noise-induced and styrene-induced threshold shift and hair cell loss in rats and (b) the cochlea appear to have a redundancy in the number of OHCs, thus threshold shift does not necessarily occur with significant OHC loss.", "journal": "Noise & health", "date": "2003-06-14", "authors": ["PCampo", "BPouyatos", "RLataye", "GMorel"], "doi": null}

The internal layer consists of type II collagen-positive fibrocartilage. Scanning electron microscopy revealed three distinct layers in the acetabular labrum: (1) the articular surface was covered by a meshwork of thin fibrils; (2) beneath the superficial network, there is a layer of lamella-like collagen fibrils; (3) the majority of the collagen fibrils are oriented in a circular manner. Blood vessels enter the labrum from the adjacent joint capsule. The distribution of vessels within the labrum is not homogenous. Blood vessels can be detected only in the peripheral one-third of the labrum. The internal part is avascular.\nThe result of this study demonstrates that the structure of the acetabular labrum is highly significant for the direction of traumatic and dysplastic labral lesions. The biomechanical analysis of the structure suggests that the labrum is stressed by compressive load.

Transgenic HUVEC were scattered in tumors, but not in normal mouse tissues; immunohistochemical analysis revealed their selective homing to tumor vascular structures, over 50% of which contained beta-gal(+) cells. Injection of beta-gal-transduced human fibroblasts was also associated with transgenic cell incorporation into tumor masses; however, beta-gal(+) fibroblasts did not home to tumor blood vessels and were only localized within the tumor stroma.

Renal transplantation and oral cysteamine have improved the general prognosis of the disease, and ocular manifestations are now the most common complication. This long-term follow-up study describes the sequence of ocular manifestations in patients with nephropathic cystinosis treated with oral and topical cysteamine.\nData were recorded for all patients with cystinosis examined between 1980 and 2000. For each patient, photophobia and visual acuity were evaluated and slit-lamp and fundus examinations were performed. For some patients, an electroretinogram was also performed.\nTwenty-nine patients were observed during this period. They received oral and topical cysteamine. Photophobia and loss of visual acuity generally began by 10 years of age but were severe only after 15 years of age. Peripheral corneal epithelial infiltration appeared in the first few years of life. Infiltration evolved toward the depth and center of the cornea during the second decade of life. Retinopathy was present in 51.7% of the patients, with 3 cases of maculopathy and 3 cases of flattening on electroretinogram.\nPhotophobia and corneal infiltration, although generally severe after 15 years of age, could be treated with topical cysteamine and corneal transplantation. Retinal infiltration, previously described as frequent and potentially blinding, is currently observed in only half of these patients, with mild visual impairment.

Ten patients and six age-matched, healthy control subjects were included in this study. The postoperative periods ranged from 6 to 87 months. Subjective donor-site morbidity was assessed with a patient questionnaire and the Enneking system. For quantification of donor-site morbidity, gait was evaluated during normal walking, walking under visual and cognitive constraints, and walking at a velocity higher than the preferred one. In general, the patient perception of donor-site morbidity was low. Complaints were frequently mentioned, however, including pain (60 percent), dysesthesia (50 percent), a feeling of ankle instability (30 percent), and inability to run (20 percent). Gait analyses revealed that patients walked at a lower preferred velocity, compared with control subjects. Furthermore, they demonstrated significant increases in the coefficients of variation of stride time during walking under visual and cognitive loads and during walking at a velocity higher than the preferred one, compared with normal walking. These increases were not observed for control subjects. These findings suggest that the reautomatization of gait is affected among patients.

Twenty-six patients presented with type IIIB open fractures, nine with type IIIC open fractures, and 15 with chronic osteomyelitis. Seven patients underwent primary amputation, and reconstruction was attempted for 43 patients. The mean bone defect size was 7.7 cm (range, 3 to 20 cm). Bone reconstruction was achieved with conventional bone grafts in 16 cases, in association with either local (13 cases) or free (three cases) flaps. Vascularized bone transfer was performed in 24 cases, with either osteocutaneous groin flaps (10 cases), soleus-fibula flaps (12 cases), or osteocutaneous lateral arm flaps (two cases). For three patients, bone reconstruction was performed with a technique that combines the induction of a membrane around a cement spacer with the use of an autologous cancellous bone graft. Infections were observed to be responsible for prolonged hospital stays and treatment failures. The cumulative rates of sepsis were 4.6 percent at 1 week after injury and 62.8 percent at 2 months. Vascular complications were also related to infections and were responsible for four secondary amputations. One patient asked for secondary amputation because of a painful nonfunctional lower limb. Bone healing occurred in 37 of 43 cases, and the average time to union was 9.5 months, with an average of 8.7 procedures. The mean lengths of stay were 49 days for conventional bone grafts and 62 days for vascularized bone grafts. All of the 50 patients were able to walk, with an average time of 14 months. All of the patients with amputations underwent prosthetic rehabilitation. Patients mostly complained about the reconstructed limb (62.8 percent). Joint stiffness was present in 40 percent of the cases. Other long-term complications were pain (nine cases), lack of sensation (five cases), infection (five cases), and pseudarthrosis (one case).

Twenty-five rabbits were randomly assigned to one of three groups: primary closure (n = 5), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (GoreTex; W.L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) repair (n = 10), or AlloDerm (LifeCell) repair (n = 10). The rabbits in the primary closure group received a 7 cm x 0.5 cm full-thickness abdominal wall defect that was closed primarily. A 7 cm x 3 cm full-thickness abdominal wall defect was created in the other two groups. The defects were repaired with a GoreTex Mycromesh (W.L. Gore), or AlloDerm (LifeCell) patch. At 30 days, the following endpoints were evaluated: (1) incidence of herniation; (2) presence of intra-abdominal adhesions; (3) the breaking strength of the patch-fascial interface; and (4) evaluation of graft vascularization by fluorescein dye infusion and histological analysis. There was no incidence of herniation in any of the rabbits. Visceral adhesions to the patch were found in all animals in the Gore-Tex (W.L. Gore) group but in none in the AlloDerm (LifeCell) group. The size of the patch was unchanged in all the rabbits except for two rabbits in the AlloDerm (LifeCell) group that stretched 1 cm in the transverse dimension. The change in size was not statistically significant (p = 0.17) when compared with the change in size in the Gore-Tex (W.L. Gore) group. The mean breaking strength of the primary closure group was significantly higher (521.2 N/mm2 +/- 223.0) than that of the two patch-repair groups (p < 0.05).

{"title": "Angiogenic effects of prostaglandin E2 are mediated by up-regulation of CXCR4 on human microvascular endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) increases the expression of CXCR4 on endothelial cells, rendering these cells more responsive to stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), an angiogenic CXC chemokine and unique ligand for CXCR4. Here, we show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) mediates the effects of bFGF and VEGF in up-regulating CXCR4 expression on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs). Forskolin or 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine (IBMX), 2 inducers of adenylate cyclase, markedly enhanced, whereas cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors including aspirin, piroxicam, and NS398 markedly inhibited CXCR4 expression on HMECs. Furthermore, the ability of PGE2 to augment in vitro tubular formation in SDF-1alpha containing matrigel was inhibited completely by blocking CXCR4. Treatment of bFGF- or VEGF-stimulated HMECs with COX inhibitors blocked tubular formation by about 50% to 70%. Prostaglandin-induced human endothelial cell organization and subsequent vascularization can be inhibited to a greater extent by a neutralizing antibody to human CXCR4 in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Additionally, VEGF- and bFGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo was also inhibited by about 50% by NS-398 or piroxicam, and this inhibitory effect was accompanied by decreased expression of CXCR4 on murine endothelial cells. Consequently, by inducing CXCR4 expression, prostaglandin accounts for about 50% of the tubular formation in vitro and in vivo angiogenic effects of VEGF and bFGF. Moreover, augmentation of CXCR4 expression by VEGF, bFGF, and PGE2 involves stimulation of transcription factors binding to the Sp1-binding sites within the promoter region of the CXCR4 gene. These findings indicate that PGE2 is a mediator of VEGF- and bFGF-induced CXCR4-dependent neovessel assembly in vivo and show that angiogenic effects of PGE2 require CXCR4 expression.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2003-06-07", "authors": ["RosalbaSalcedo", "XiaZhang", "Howard AYoung", "NelsonMichael", "KenWasserman", "Wei-HongMa", "ManuelaMartins-Green", "William JMurphy", "Joost JOppenheim"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2002-11-3400"}

Elevated expression of several angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-8, has been detected in primary cutaneous melanomas, and the importance of these mediators in promoting melanoma angiogenesis and metastasis has been confirmed in tumor xenotransplant models. Based upon these findings, several clinical trials of angiogenesis inhibitors have been initiated in human melanoma patients and are currently underway.

{"title": "The indications and outcomes in the use of osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap.", "abstract": "Whether secondary to cancer surgery ablation or trauma, surgeons are faced with defects of the mandible or maxilla that would be best reconstructed with a thin, pliable soft tissue component and vascularized bone. A subset of these challenging wounds do not require the bicortical bone necessary to reestablish structural integrity or to retain a dental prosthesis, because the soft tissue needs are more critical than the bony needs. It is this niche that the radial forearm osteofaciocutaneous free flap (RFOFF) fulfills well. In the past, potential and real donor site morbidity has precluded the routine use of this flap. New methods to reduce this morbidity have rekindled our use of this flap. PROCEDURES USED: A retrospective review of patients with defects of the mandible or maxilla treated with the RFOFF from July 1, 1997, to December 31, 2000, was performed. After flap harvest, the donor site was rigidly fixated. A skin graft was placed, and a volar splint was applied for 7 days. The arm was then fully mobilized. Parameters examined were defect location, donor site complications, flap survival, fistula occurrence, plate fracture, and/or extrusion.\nThirty-four patients were reconstructed with the RFOFF with a follow-up of 10-54 months. Seven patients had an anterior maxillectomy defect, and 27 patients had a lateral mandibulectomy defect with associated tongue/tonsillar fossa and/or palate defect. There were no cases of flap failure or donor site radius fracture. During the follow-up period, there were no plate fractures or intraoral exposures as evidenced by clinical and radiographic evaluation. Fistulas occurred in five patients; all healed without surgical intervention.\nWith rigid fixation of the residual radius, donor site morbidity has been minimized, and indications for this flap have expanded. Specifically the anterior maxillary arch and the ascending ramus, angle, and posterior body of the mandible (nontooth-bearing areas) are the sites most amenable to the thin bony stock of the harvested radius. The pliable forearm skin is ideal for the soft tissue defects. We believe that the RFOFF with bone has a definite role in the reconstruction of select head and neck defects.", "journal": "Head & neck", "date": "2003-06-05", "authors": ["Douglas BVillaret", "Neal AFutran"], "doi": "10.1002/hed.10212"}

Free vascularized fibular grafting has been reported to be successful for patients with early stages of osteonecrosis, but little is known about its efficacy after the femoral head has collapsed.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the results in a consecutive series of 188 patients (224 hips) who had undergone free vascularized fibular grafting, between 1989 and 1999, for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the hip that had led to collapse of the femoral head but not to arthrosis. The average duration of follow-up was 4.3 years (range, two to twelve years). We defined conversion to total hip arthroplasty as the failure end point, and we analyzed the contribution, to failure, of the size of the lesion, amount of preoperative collapse of the femoral head, etiology of the osteonecrosis, age of the patient, and bilaterality of the lesion. We used the Harris hip score to evaluate clinical status preoperatively and at the time of the most recent follow-up.\nThe overall rate of survival was 67.4% for the hips followed for a minimum of two years and 64.5% for those followed for a minimum of five years. The mean preoperative Harris hip score was 54.5 points, and it increased to 81 points for the patients in whom the surgery succeeded; 63% of the patients in that group had a good or excellent result. There was a significant relationship between the outcome of the grafting procedure and the etiology of the osteonecrosis (p = 0.017). Patients in whom the osteonecrosis was idiopathic, associated with alcohol abuse, or posttraumatic fared worse than did those with other causes, including steroid use. Survival of the joint was not significantly related to the size of the femoral head lesion, but there was an increased relative risk of conversion to total hip arthroplasty with increasing lesion size and amount of collapse. Neither patient age nor bilaterality significantly affected outcome.\nPatients with postcollapse, predegenerative osteonecrosis of the femoral head appear to benefit from free vascularized fibular grafting, with good overall survival of the joint and significant improvement in the Harris hip score. The results of this femoral head-preserving procedure in patients with postcollapse osteonecrosis are superior to those of core decompression and nonoperative treatment, as reported in the literature. Patients with larger lesions and certain diagnoses, such as idiopathic and alcohol-related osteonecrosis, have worse outcomes.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Pkb alpha-/- placentae display significant hypotrophy, with marked reduction of the decidual basalis and nearly complete loss of glycogen-containing cells in the spongiotrophoblast, and exhibit decreased vascularization. Pkb alpha-/- placentae also show significant reduction of phosphorylation of PKB and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase.

{"title": "Loss of Bmp7 and Fgf8 signaling in Hoxa13-mutant mice causes hypospadia.", "abstract": "In humans and mice, mutations in Hoxa13 cause malformation of limb and genitourinary (GU) regions. In males, one of the most common GU malformations associated with loss of Hoxa13 function is hypospadia, a condition defined by the poor growth and closure of the urethra and glans penis. By examining early signaling in the developing mouse genital tubercle, we show that Hoxa13 is essential for normal expression of Fgf8 and Bmp7 in the urethral plate epithelium. In Hoxa13(GFP)-mutant mice, hypospadias occur as a result of the combined loss of Fgf8 and Bmp7 expression in the urethral plate epithelium, as well as the ectopic expression of noggin (Nog) in the flanking mesenchyme. In vitro supplementation with Fgf8 restored proliferation in homozygous mutants to wild-type levels, suggesting that Fgf8 is sufficient to direct early proliferation of the developing genital tubercle. However, the closure defects of the distal urethra and glans can be attributed to a loss of apoptosis in the urethra, which is consistent with reduced Bmp7 expression in this region. Mice mutant for Hoxa13 also exhibit changes in androgen receptor expression, providing a developmental link between Hoxa13-associated hypospadias and those produced by antagonists to androgen signaling. Finally, a novel role for Hoxa13 in the vascularization of the glans penis is also identified.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2003-06-05", "authors": ["Emily AMorgan", "Susan BNguyen", "VirginiaScott", "H ScottStadler"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.00530"}

The results obtained indicate a 10 years of follow-up incidence of diabetic retinopathy of 37.50% (being the proliferative form 13.46%) and the incidence of microalbuminuria is of 20.19%. The appearance of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is associated to the presence of diastolic hypertension, while the appearance of microalbuminuria is related to the elevation of levels of HbAlc. The results obtained in the proliferative diabetic retinopathy and microalbuminuria incidence are similar to those of other authors. At the end of the study four groups of patients are configured depending on whether they present proliferative diabetic retinopathy and/or microalbuminuria.

Decreased vascularization during wound repair in mice deficient for CRAMP, the murine homologue of LL-37/hCAP-18, shows that cathelicidin-mediated angiogenesis is important for cutaneous wound neovascularization in vivo.

This laboratory has previously reported the induction of tolerance in the discordant xenogeneic model of pig-to-rodent thymic transplantation. We also have described a miniature swine model of fully mismatched allogeneic composite vascularized thymokidney transplantation that induced transplantation tolerance. We tested a combination of these approaches in a clinically relevant pig-to-primate model of xenotransplantation.\nComposite thymokidney grafts were prepared 40 to 80 days before transplantation by the autologous implantation of thymic tissue under the renal capsule of human decay-accelerating factor transgenic swine. Baboons received xenotransplants of both human decay-accelerating factor composite thymokidneys and omental implants of thymic tissue. Recipients were treated with an immunosuppressive-conditioning regimen including thymectomy or thymic irradiation, extracorporeal immunoadsorption of anti-alphaGal antibodies and T-cell depletion. Recipients were followed for indicators of xenograft rejection, T-cell depletion and reconstitution, anti-alphaGal antibody levels, and mixed lymphocyte responses. Immunologic responses were studied in those animals that survived for more than 3 weeks.\nThymokidney xenografts survived for up to 30 days, with evidence of viable thymic epithelium and Hassall's corpuscles under the renal capsule and in the omental implants, and with evidence of few host lymphocytes. Three animals demonstrated donor-specific unresponsiveness, while maintaining normal alloresponses, in mixed-lymphocyte-response assays performed after immunosuppression had been stopped. Rejected grafts demonstrated humoral damage without evidence of cellular infiltrates. After graftectomy, one animal maintained donor-specific cellular unresponsiveness and stable anti-alphaGal antibody levels for more than 2 months.\nWe concluded that composite thymokidney and thymic-tissue xenotransplantation from swine to baboons can induce donor-specific cellular unresponsiveness and stable anti-alphaGal antibody levels, suggesting avoidance of sensitization after xenotransplantation.

After intraportal delivery of this vector, high-level, stable transgene expression of angiostatin lasting for at least 6 months was observed locally in hepatocytes. Gene transfer of AAV-angiostatin via the portal vein led to significant suppression of the growth of both nodular and metastatic EL-4 lymphoma tumors established in the liver and prolonged the survival time of the mice.

The anti-angiogenic activity of angiostatin was independent of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

The purpose of the protocol was to compare corneal endothelial morphology changes after wearing rigid gas-permeable (RGP) Menicon Z contact lenses, continuously for up to 30 days, with ACUVUE (Johnson & Johnson Vision Care) hydrogel contact lenses, worn for up to 6 nights of extended wear.\nSixty patients, who were adapted to RGP daily wear and soft contact lens daily wear, were recruited at two study sites. The thirty subjects who wore RGP daily wear lenses were fitted with the Menicon Z (tisilfocon A, oxygen permeablility [Dk] = 163) RGP contact lens comprised the test group. The control group subjects (n = 30 former users of daily wear soft contact lenses) were fitted with ACUVUE (etafilcon A, Dk = 28) hydrogel contact lenses. After a 2-week adaptation period of daily wear, subjects began extended wear. Endothelial imaging was performed at the two study sites in this multicenter study (University Hospitals of Cleveland/Case Western Reserve University Department of Ophthalmology [CWRU] and The Ohio State University [OSU]). The hydrogel lens group was instructed to wear their lenses for 7 days and 6 nights before discarding the lenses and to sleep with no lenses on the seventh night. The RGP group was permitted to wear the lenses for up to 30 days and 29 consecutive nights before removing the lenses for cleaning and overnight soaking.\nCWRU had 24 patients (12 soft contact lens and 12 rigid contact lens) and OSU had 21 patients (12 soft contact lens and 9 rigid contact lens) who completed the study and were included in the analyses. Patients who were withdrawn from the study at CWRU included one RGP patient dropped out because of pregnancy; one RGP patient developed vascularized limbal keratitis and discomfort; one could not be fitted with a bitoric RGP; two soft lens patients moved from the area, and one dropped out because of dry eyes. At OSU, four patients dropped out due to discomfort (two in each lens type);one moved from the study area; one decided not to participate soon after the consent visit; one had worries of reduced vision at 6 months; one subject's attitude changed prior to the 6 month visit; and one subject was withdrawn for reasons of poor study schedule compliance.\nThe Menicon Z lens wearers in this study did not show significant endothelial cell morphology changes after 1 year of nearly continuous contact lens wear. This finding is particularly important considering the RGP wearers in this study were older by a average of 10 years (mean age approximately 40) and had worn their contact lenses an average of almost 10 years longer than the soft contact lens wearers.", "journal": "Eye & contact lens", "date": "2003-05-29", "authors": ["Joseph TBarr", "BrianPall", "Loretta BSzczotka", "G LynnMitchell", "WilliamGleason"], "doi": "10.1097/00140068-200301000-00004"}

A dense network of blood capillaries centripetally irrigates the adrenal gland, allowing every endocrine cell to be in contact with an endothelial cell. The pituitary hormone ACTH controls the coordinated development of the vasculature and the endocrine tissue mass. This suggests that paracrine secretions between steroidogenic adrenocytes and capillary endothelial cells participate in the control of adrenocortical homeostasis. Besides its effect on the vascular tone of arteries, ACTH induces the expression of the angiogenic cytokine VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor-A) in primary cultures of adrenocortical cells. This growth factor is a specific mitogen for endothelial cells and is likely to mediate the hormonal control of adrenocortical vascularization through a paracrine mechanism. The newly discovered angiogenic factor EG-VEGF (endocrine-gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor), the expression of which is restricted to endocrine glands and which is preferentially mitogenic for endocrine tissue-derived endothelial cells, is another candidate mediator of great potential interest.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2003-05-28", "authors": ["Micha\u00eblThomas", "MichelleKeramidas", "EmmanuelleMonchaux", "Jean-JacquesFeige"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.10333"}

We report 104 cases of sinonasal-type hemangiopericytoma diagnosed between 1970 and 1995 from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. There were 57 females and 47 males ranging in age from 5 to 86 years (mean 62.6 years). The most common clinical presentation was airway obstruction (n = 57) and/or epistaxis (n = 54), with symptoms averaging 10 months in duration. The tumors involved the nasal cavity alone (n = 47) or also a paranasal sinus (n = 26), were polypoid, and measured an average of 3.1 cm. Histologically, the tumors were submucosal and unencapsulated and showed a diffuse growth with fascicular (n = 37) to solid (n = 50) to focally whorled (n = 7) patterns. The tumor cells were uniform in appearance with minimal pleomorphism and had spindle-shaped (n = 82) to round/oval (n = 18) nuclei with vesicular to hyperchromatic chromatin and eosinophilic to amphophilic to clear-appearing cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders. Multinucleated (tumor) giant cells were identified in a minority of cases (n = 5). Mitotic figures were inconspicuous and necrosis was absent. The tumors were richly vascularized, including staghorn-appearing vessels that characteristically had prominent perivascular hyalinization (n = 92). An associated inflammatory cell infiltrate that included mast cells and eosinophils was noted in the majority of cases (n = 87). The immunohistochemical profile included reactivity with vimentin (98%), smooth muscle actin (92%), muscle specific actin (77%), factor XIIIa (78%), and laminin (52%). Surgery was the treatment of choice for all of the patients; adjunctive radiotherapy was given to four patients. Recurrences developed in 18 patients within 1-12 years from diagnosis.

Fetal-derived trophoblast giant cells invade into the uterus where they gain access to the maternal blood circulation to ensure sufficient nutrient supply of the embryo. In serial sections through early- to mid-gestation conceptuses, we have determined the exact distance of trophoblast invasion and the expression of angiogenic, vasodilatory, and anticoagulative factors that are likely to influence remodeling and redirection of the maternal circulatory system. Trophoblast derivatives were detected at a distance as far as approximately 300 microm from the placental border, where they are allocated exclusively along the mid-line of the decidua. The farthest invading cells characteristically expressed proliferin and proliferin-related protein, hormones that affect endothelial cell migration and vascularization. Occasionally, these cells replaced the normal vascular endothelium and acquired a \"pseudo-endothelial\" shape. Complete vascular disintegration was observed 50-80 microm outside of the placental border where maternal blood was entirely lined by a trophoblast giant cell-derived network of blood sinuses. This transition in blood space lining correlated with trophoblast expression of various vasodilatory and anticoagulative factors that are likely to promote blood flow toward the placenta. Analysis of teratocarcinoma-like tumors demonstrated that trophoblast giant cell-induced promotion and redirection of blood flow is not restricted to the uterine environment. These results show that trophoblast giant cells have the intrinsic capacity to attract and increase blood flow and to gradually displace the vascular endothelium resulting in the formation of canals entirely lined by trophoblast cells.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2003-05-23", "authors": ["MyriamHemberger", "TadashigeNozaki", "MitsukoMasutani", "James CCross"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.10291"}

In the present article, we describe the construction of a novel porous alginate scaffold that incorporates tiny poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres capable of controlling the release of angiogenic factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The microspheres are an integral part of the solid alginate matrix, and their incorporation does not affect the scaffold porosity or pore size. In vitro, bFGF was released from the porous composite scaffolds in a controlled manner and it was biologically active as assessed by its ability to induce the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. The controlled delivery of bFGF from the three-dimensional scaffolds accelerated the matrix vascularization after implantation on the mesenteric membrane in rat peritoneum. The number of penetrating capillaries into the bFGF-releasing scaffolds was nearly fourfold higher than into the control scaffolds (those incorporating microspheric BSA and heparin but not bFGF). At day 10 posttransplantation, capillary density in the composite scaffolds was 45 +/- 3/mm(2) and it increased to 70 +/- 7/mm(2) by day 21. The released bFGF induced the formation of large and matured blood vessels, as judged by the massive layer of mural cells surrounding the endothelial cells. The control over bFGF delivery and localizing its effects to areas of need, may aid in the wider application of bFGF in therapeutic angiogenesis as well as in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

To improve the life quality of such patients, implantation or bone grafting-combined implantation was utilized to functionally reconstruct the jaw defects.\n1. Fragmental or full mandibular defects were reconstructed by vascularized or non-vascularized bone grafts in combination with immediate or delayed implants. 2. The unilateral maxillary defect with an edentulous counter-side was rehabilitated by a prosthesis secured on implants placed on the healthy side. 3. For bilateral maxillary defect, implants were placed in the zygmatic bone or augmented zygmatic bone to support a prosthesis with magnetic retention.\n64 jaw defects (10 in maxilla; 54 in mandible) were reconstructed by three different methods to restore the appearance and functions. The longest follow-up period was 12 years and the shortest 5 year, only 6 implants were lost due to failure of osseointegration. The implant survival rate for the maxillary defects was 97.5%, for the mandibular defects with vascularized bone grafts was 97.1%, and with non-vascularized bone grafts was 97.7%.\nImplants-borne prosthesis is an applicable technique in restoration of maxillary defects. In case of insufficient zygomatic thickness, bone augmentation is often needed prior to implantation. As for the mandibular reconstruction, bone grafting in combination with implantation is an ideal method. Compared to non-vascularized bone grafting, the vascularized method is much more suitable for bone grafting beds with poor blood supply. From the practical point of view, non-vascularized bone graft in combination with implantation is more practicable. The reduced off-body time of bone grafts from donor to recipient site keeps most of osteoblasts vital and enables simultaneous implants to achieve osseointegration.

To investigate the relative impact of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on tumor growth and neovascularization, we generated tumor cell transfectants differing for VEGF and/or FGF-2 expression. Human endometrial adenocarcinoma HEC-1-B-derived Tet-FGF-2 cells that express FGF-2 under the control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter (Tet-off system) were further transfected with a VEGF(121) anti-sense (AS-VEGF) cDNA. Next, Tet-FGF-2 and AS-VEGF/Tet-FGF-2 cells were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice that received tetracycline or not in the drinking water. Simultaneous expression of FGF-2 and VEGF in Tet-FGF-2 cells resulted in fast-growing lesions characterized by high blood vessel density, patency and permeability, and limited necrosis. Blood vessels were highly heterogeneous in size and frequently associated with pericytes. Inhibition of FGF-2 production by tetracycline caused a significant decrease in tumor burden paralleled by a decrease in blood vessel density and size. AS-VEGF expression resulted in a similar reduction in blood vessel density associated with a significant decrease in pericyte organization, vascular patency, and permeability. The consequent decrease in tumor burden was paralleled by increased tumor hypoxia and necrosis. A limited additional inhibitory effect was exerted by simultaneous down-regulation of FGF-2 and VEGF expression. These findings demonstrate that FGF-2 and VEGF stimulate vascularization synergistically but with distinctive effects on vessel functionality and tumor survival. Blockade of either one of the two growth factors results in a decrease in blood vessel density and, consequently, in tumor burden. However, inhibition of the expression of VEGF, but not of FGF-2, affects also vessel maturation and functionality, leading to tumor hypoxia and necrosis.

Hyperplasia and hypervascularity of the ovarian theca interna and stroma are also prominent features of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a leading cause of infertility. Compelling evidence indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of the cyclical corpus luteum angiogenesis. However, the nature of the factor(s) that mediate angiogenesis in PCOS is less clearly understood. Endocrine gland-derived (EG)-VEGF has been recently identified as an endothelial cell mitogen with selectivity for the endothelium of steroidogenic glands and is expressed in normal human ovaries. In the present study, we compared the expression of EG-VEGF and VEGF mRNA in a series of 13 human PCOS and 13 normal ovary specimens by in situ hybridization. EG-VEGF expression in normal ovaries is dynamic and generally complementary to VEGF expression in both follicles and corpora lutea. A particularly high expression of EG-VEGF was detected in the Leydig-like hilus cells found in the highly vascularized ovarian hilus. In PCOS ovaries, we found strong expression of EG-VEGF mRNA in theca interna and stroma in most of the specimens examined, thus spatially related to the new blood vessels. In contrast, VEGF mRNA expression was most consistently associated with the granulosa cell layer and sometimes the theca, but rarely with the stroma. These findings indicate that both EG-VEGF and VEGF are expressed in PCOS ovaries, but in different cell types at different stages of differentiation, thus suggesting complementary functions for the two factors in angiogenesis and possibly cyst formation.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2003-05-22", "authors": ["NapoleoneFerrara", "GretchenFrantz", "JenniferLeCouter", "LisaDillard-Telm", "ThinhPham", "AparnaDraksharapu", "ThomasGiordano", "FranklinPeale"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64322-2"}

We hypothesized FIV-mediated gene transfer could provide long-term gene expression, and improved allograft survival. FIV-vIL-10 and FIV-beta-gal were produced using the FELIX vector system.

In allogeneic grafts transduced with FIV-IL-10, a number of the chemokine genes were suppressed.

We report the case of a 15-years-old girl who was injured in a motorcycle accident and presented with a femoral shaft fracture and a concomitant ipsilateral anterior hip dislocation. Operative management consisted of an attempted closed reduction of the femoral fracture, which was unsuccessful; thus, an external fixator was temporarily applied. Subsequently, the hip dislocation was treated by open reduction through an anterolateral approach. Finally, the femoral fracture was securely stabilized using an unreamed femoral intramedullary nail. The postoperative course was uneventful. MRI follow-up after 6 weeks did not reveal any sign of mangled vascularization of the femoral head and radiographs demonstrated normal bony healing of the shaft fracture. Due to the fact that there is no definitive surgical strategy for this rare combination of injuries, concomitant ipsilateral femoral fracture and anterior hip dislocation is an interesting and challenging situation for the trauma surgeon which requires a subtle and exact surgical technique in order to achieve satisfying results.", "journal": "Der Unfallchirurg", "date": "2003-05-17", "authors": ["WGrechenig", "GPeicha", "CBoldin", "JMayr"], "doi": "10.1007/s00113-003-0583-z"}

By analogy to human RCC in which mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene result in accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha) and up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), we investigated the regulation of HIF and its target gene VEGF in rat RCC resulting from Tsc-2 defects. To examine HIFalpha activity, a panel of rat renal epithelial cells were analyzed for expression of HIF1alpha and the homologous protein, HIF2alpha, under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. RCC-derived cell lines exhibited high basal levels of HIF activity as determined using hypoxia response element-luciferase reporter constructs. HIF2alpha was stabilized in RCC-derived cell lines and in five of six primary tumors compared with normal kidney, which was consistent with the high levels of hypoxia response element-reporter activity observed in the cell lines. Primary RCCs that developed in Eker rats were highly vascularized, which was similar to their human counterparts. Furthermore, reverse-transcriptase PCR and immunoblotting demonstrated that VEGF was abundantly expressed in both rat RCC cell lines and primary tumors. The 120-, 164-, and 188-amino-acid isoforms of VEGF were expressed at the RNA and protein levels in RCC-derived cell lines, although only a single band was observed in primary tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that RCC caused by loss of the Tsc-2 tumor suppressor gene (which retain wild-type Vhl) up-regulate VEGF via a HIF2alpha-mediated mechanism. Thus, loss of Tsc-2 and VHL tumor suppressor gene function appears to have similar consequences in Eker rats and humans respectively, identifying dysregulation of HIFalpha and VEGF expression as a common pathway for the development of RCC in different species and in tumors with different molecular etiologies.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-05-17", "authors": ["Matt YuLiu", "LorenzPoellinger", "Cheryl LWalker"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Immunotherapy of tumors with vaccine based on quail homologous vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.", "abstract": "The breaking of immune tolerance of \"self-antigens\" associated with angiogenesis is an attractive approach to cancer therapy by active immunity. We used vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) as a model antigen to explore the feasibility of the immunotherapy with a vaccine based on a xenogeneic homologous protein. To test this concept, we prepared a quail homologous VEGFR-2 protein vaccine (qVEGFR) based on quail VEGFR-2. At the same time, a protein vaccine based on the corresponding ligand-binding domain of mouse self-VEGFR-2 (mVEGFR) was also prepared and used as a control. We found that immunotherapy with qVEGFR was effective at protective and therapeutic antitumor immunity in several solid and hematopoietic tumor models in mice. Autoantibodies against mouse VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) were identified by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-VEGFR antibody-producing B cells were detectable by ELISPOT. Endothelial deposition of immunoglobulins developed within tumor. VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation was inhibited in vitro by immunoglobulins from qVEGFR-immunized mice. Antitumor activity was caused by the adoptive transfer of the purified immunoglobulins. Antitumor activity and production of autoantibodies against Flk-1 could be abrogated by the depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Angiogenesis was apparently inhibited within the tumors, and the vascularization of alginate beads was also reduced. No marked toxicity was found in the immunized mice.

Fifteen consecutive cases of CSF fistulas treated at the authors' institution were retrospectively reviewed. All patients presented with otorrhea. Eleven patients had previously undergone ear surgery. A middle fossa approach was followed in all cases. The authors used a thin but watertight and vascularly preserved temporalis muscle flap that had been dissected from the medial side of the temporalis muscle and was laid intracranially on the floor of the middle fossa, between the repaired dura mater and petrous bone. The median follow-up period was 2.5 years. None of the patients experienced recurrence of otorrhea or meningitis. There was no complication related to the intracranial temporalis muscle flap (for example, seizures or increased intracranial pressure caused by muscle swelling). One patient developed hydrocephalus, which resolved after the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt 2 months later. The thin, vascularized muscle flap created an excellent barrier against the recurrence of CSF fistulas and also avoided the risk of increased intracranial pressure caused by muscle swelling.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that both iodine-131 (131I) and yttrium-90 (90Y) are suitable radionuclides for RIT. Iodine-131 and 90Y differ markedly in their physical properties including half-life, path length, type of energy emissions, intracellular stability, and the organs targeted by the free radionuclide. Both radionuclides can be safely administered in the outpatient setting under current Nuclear Regulatory Commission guidelines. Potential advantages of 131I for RIT include availability, stable chemistry, longer half-life, and an emission spectrum that allows for dosimetric studies and therapy with the same immunoconjugate. By contrast, 90Y has a longer path length and superior intracellular stability compared with 131I. Yttrium-90 may therefore be preferable to 131I for patients with bulky disease, poorly vascularized solid tumors, or when targeting internalized antigens. Although 90Y emits no gamma photon, dosimetry studies for 90Y RIT can be performed using a surrogate radionuclide such as indium-111. Both 131I- and 90Y-labeled anti-CD20 antibodies have demonstrated efficacy in treating relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

{"title": "Perspectives of new potential therapeutic applications of somatostatin analogs.", "abstract": "At the present time only two long-acting somatostatin (SS) analogs, octreotide and lanreotide, are commonly used in the routine therapy. Both analogs have a high affinity mainly to a somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2). The established indications for SS analogs treatment include acromegaly, neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, and some gastro-enterologic diseases (pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleedings, refractory diarrheas, pancreatic and intestinal fistulas). The recent investigations allow to predict the enlargement of therapeutic applications of SS analogs. It concerns pituitary tumors other than somatotropinoma, tumors of other endocrine glands like thyroid and adrenal gland, as well as some non-endocrine tumors. The progress depends on the introduction of new SS analogs with high affinity for SS receptor subtypes other than SSTR2, because some tumors present the high expression of SSTR1 (e.g. prostatic cancers) or SSTR5 (e.g. colonic cancers). Great hopes are connected with the coupling of SS analogs with the radioactive isotopes or non-radioactive cytotoxic agents to destruct the neoplastic cells highly expressing the specific subtypes of SS receptors. The pre- or postoperative in vivo imaging of SS receptors by means of the receptor scintigraphy, as well as the post-operative identification of SS receptor subtypes in the excised tumor tissues using immunohistochemistry, should play an important role in the prediction of the effects of SS analog treatment. Beside oncology, new therapeutic applications of SS analogs could be presumed among others in ophthalmology; it concerns the treatment of progressive Graves-Basedow ophtalmopathy, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and corneal diseases connected with corneal vascularization.", "journal": "Neuro endocrinology letters", "date": "2003-05-14", "authors": ["MarekPawlikowski", "GabrielaMelen-Mucha"], "doi": null}

Surgical challenges are often encountered because of the limited amounts of native tissue available. We investigated the feasibility of using vaginal epithelial and smooth muscle cells for the engineering of vaginal tissues in vivo. Vaginal epithelial and smooth muscle cells of female rabbits were grown, expanded in culture, and characterized immunocytochemically. Vaginal epithelial and smooth muscle cells were seeded on polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds at 10 x 10(6) and 20 x 10(6) cells/cm(3), respectively. The cell-seeded scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted into nude mice. The animals were killed 1, 4, and 6 weeks after implantation. Immunocytochemical and histochemical analyses were performed with pancytokeratins AE1/AE3 and with smooth muscle-specific alpha-actin antibodies to confirm the reconstituted tissue phenotype. Western blot analyses and electrical field stimulation studies were also performed to further characterize the tissue-engineered constructs. Vaginal epithelial cells were serially identified with anti-pancytokeratins AE1/AE3 at all culture stages. Smooth muscle cells in culture stained positively with alpha-smooth muscle actin antibodies. One week after implantation in vivo, the retrieved polymer scaffolds demonstrated multilayered tissue strips of both cell types, and penetrating native vasculature was also noted. Increased organization of the smooth muscle and epithelial tissue was evident by 4 weeks. There was no evidence of tissue formation in the controls. Immunocytochemical analyses using anti-pancytokeratins confirmed the presence of vaginal epithelial cells in each of the constructs. Anti-alpha-actin smooth muscle antibodies also confirmed the presence of multilayered smooth muscle fibers and tissue at each time point. Western blot analyses of the scaffolds confirmed the expression of cytokeratin and smooth muscle actin proteins when compared with controls. The contractile properties of the tissue-engineered vaginal constructs in response to electrical field stimulation were similar to those of normal vaginal tissue.

{"title": "Angiogenesis: basic and clinical aspects.", "abstract": "The cardiovascular system is the first functional organ system to develop in the vertebrate embryo. A widely accepted view is that blood vessels arise through two mechanisms during development, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. New vessels in the adult arise mainly through angiogenesis, although vasculogenesis also may occur. The existence of a postnatal vasculogenesis is also supported by the evidence that both endothelial cells and endothelial precursor cells co-exist in the circulation. Angiogenesis is a biological process by which new capillaries are formed and it occurs in many physiological and pathological conditions. It is controlled by the net balance between molecules that have positive and negative regulatory activity and this concept had led to the notion of the \"angiogenic switch\", depending on an increased production of one or more of the positive regulators of angiogenesis. Considerable benefit can be derived in the clinical setting from manipulating angiogenesis, either positively or negatively. There is a variety of important clinical situations in which it would be desiderable to promote angiogenic processes, such as situations in which it would be desiderable to promote angiogenic processes, such as for the induction of collateral vascularization in an ischemic heart or limb.

This IRES structure caused enhanced synthesis and increased secretion of the mature protein both in HEK-293 and in COS-7 cells, when compared to the basic construct. Both p/hVEGF165 and p163/hVEGF165 vectors were tested for in vivo angiogenic activity on a novel hirudinean model. As expected, the p/hVEGF165 vector injected as naked DNA was able to induce angiogenesis in the non-vascularized muscular tissue of Hirudo medicinalis. This model also allowed us to monitor intracellular synthesis of VEGF165 and subsequent interstitial secretion from muscle cells. Interestingly, significantly larger muscle tissue areas underwent marked angiogenesis when the improved vector p163/hVEGF165 was injected in H. medicinalis. It thus appears that the p163/hVEGF165 construct allows enhanced expression of the human VEGF165 gene, which in turn is responsible for increased secretion of biologically active growth factor by transduced cells.

{"title": "Arterial supply of the penis in the New Zealand rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.).", "abstract": "In the present study, the distributional pattern of the penile artery and the vessels joining the blood supply of the penis were investigated in the New Zealand rabbit. Eight adult rabbits were used in the study. In order to exhibit the vascular network by dissection, latex was injected via the abdominal aorta. The main vessel which supplies blood to the penis, the penile artery, is a branch of the internal pudendal artery. It divides into two branches which form the deep and dorsal penile arteries at the level of the ischiadic arch. The deep penile artery penetrates the tunica albuginea, and forms the arterial network of corpus cavernosum penis. On the other hand, the dorsal penile artery gives off three small branches for the subischiocavernosus muscle and at the level of the attachment of this muscle sends two small branches for the preputium.

{"title": "Islet transplantation, stem cells, and transfusion medicine.", "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of exogenous insulin, morbidity and mortality caused by type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) continue to place a significant burden on society, both in terms of human suffering and cost. The transplantation of vascularized pancreas, usually performed concurrently with renal transplantation, can cure type 1 DM, as shown by results in more than 15000 such transplants over about 30 years. Transplantation of isolated pancreatic islets, instead of the whole organ, however, offers an attractive alternative that minimizes surgery and its complications. Although islet transplantation initially met with only modest success (only about 9% insulin independence at 1 year posttransplant), recent changes in patient selection criteria, number and treatment of islets transplanted, and better immunosuppressive regimens dramatically improved the results; spawning widespread enthusiasm for islet transplantation. Despite this promise, organ/islet availability remains an important limitation to this technology. A solution to the problem of limited materials for transplantation may be in the use of stem/progenitor cells. This article reviews the background of the current enthusiasm for pancreatic islet cell transplantation, highlights future research trends in the field, and suggests that the new islet-related cellular therapies belong within the domain of transfusion medicine.", "journal": "Transfusion medicine reviews", "date": "2003-05-07", "authors": ["LennartL\u00f6gdberg", "Stephen LSgan", "Christian PLarsen", "Christopher DHillyer"], "doi": "10.1053/tmrv.2003.50006"}
{"title": "Leprdb diabetic mouse bone marrow cells inhibit skin wound vascularization but promote wound healing.", "abstract": "Bone marrow stem cells participate in tissue repair processes and may have roles in skin wound repair. Diabetes is characterized by delayed and poor wound healing, and type 1 diabetes seems to lead to stem cell dysfunction. Hence, stem cell dysfunction could contribute to poor healing, and stem cell-based therapies may be efficacious in diabetic wounds. We investigated the potential of exogenous stem cells to promote skin healing and possible effects of type 2 diabetes on stem cell function. Mouse bone marrow cells from nondiabetic and diabetic mice were enriched for putative stem cells and injected under skin wounds of nondiabetic or type 2 diabetic Leprdb mice. Using histology and morphometry, vascularization and healing in treated and untreated mice were analyzed. We anticipated a correlation between improved wound healing and vascularization, because therapies that increase tissue vascularization tend to enhance wound healing. Our data indicate that exogenous nondiabetic bone marrow-derived cells increase vascularization and improve wound healing in Leprdb mice but have little effect on nondiabetic controls. In contrast, Leprdb-derived marrow cells inhibit vascularization but promote wound healing in Leprdb mice. Thus, adult stem cell function may be impaired by type 2 diabetes; the ability to promote vascularization and wound healing are distinct functions of bone marrow cells; and neovascularization and wound healing may not be tightly coupled. Additionally, we observed little incorporation of injected cells into wound structures, suggesting that improved healing is mediated through mechanisms other than direct differentiation and incorporation of the cells.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2003-05-06", "authors": ["VesnaStepanovic", "OlaAwad", "ChunhuaJiao", "MartineDunnwald", "Gina CSchatteman"], "doi": "10.1161/01.RES.0000074906.98021.55"}
{"title": "Nonlinear simulation of tumor growth.", "abstract": "We study solid tumor ( carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. The tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. A new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. One parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). The other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. Both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. Our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. We demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. This leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. Away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. Interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. This is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.", "journal": "Journal of mathematical biology", "date": "2003-05-03", "authors": ["VittorioCristini", "JohnLowengrub", "QingNie"], "doi": "10.1007/s00285-002-0174-6"}
{"title": "Phenotypic flexibility of structure and function of the digestive system of Japanese quail.", "abstract": "Organisms adjust their phenotype to fluctuating conditions of the environment and to changing internal demands. We report flexible responses of the gizzard and the small intestine of Japanese quail to a high-fibre diet. Switching from a standard diet to a high-fibre diet results in a highly significant increase in gizzard size, intestine length, mucosal surface, thickness of the intestinal muscular layer and vascularization of the mucosa. After diet switching, increased or decreased gizzard size results from changes in cell size, i.e. smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hypotrophy, respectively. Increased cell proliferation is not the cause of increase in gizzard size. In the small intestine, however, we found elevated levels of cell proliferation after diet switching and conclude that increased capacity (upregulation) of the small intestine is based on increased rates of mitosis in the intestinal crypts. It is highly probable that elevated levels of cell proliferation in the crypts are balanced by elevated levels of cell extrusion at the tip of intestinal villi. The lipid contents of the liver were reduced, indicating that lipid stores in the liver were mobilized to fuel the flexible response of the gastrointestinal tract.

An inhibitor targeting VEGFRs in endothelial cells (SU5416) is effective against early-stage angiogenic lesions, but not large, well-vascularized tumors. In contrast, a kinase inhibitor incorporating selectivity for PDGFRs (SU6668) is shown to block further growth of end-stage tumors, eliciting detachment of pericytes and disruption of tumor vascularity. Importantly, PDGFRs were expressed only in perivascular cells of this tumor type, suggesting that PDGFR(+) pericytes in tumors present a complimentary target to endothelial cells for efficacious antiangiogenic therapy. Therapeutic regimes combining the two kinase inhibitors (SU5416 and SU6668) were more efficacious against all stages of islet carcinogenesis than either single agent. Combination of the VEGFR inhibitor with another distinctive kinase inhibitor targeting PDGFR activity (Gleevec) was also able to regress late-stage tumors.

Whereas PTEN/MMAC has been shown to possess antiangiogenic action, constitutively active EGFR or p53 gene defects have been associated with proangiogenic action. In this article, we asked if PTEN/MMAC gene transfer into human glioma cells that possess inactivating mutations of the PTEN/MMAC gene but also express either constitutively active EGFR (U87DeltaEGFR cells) or possess an inactivating mutation of p53 (U251 cells) still display inhibited angiogenesis in orthotopic and ectopic models of gliomas. Human glioma xenografts treated with PTEN/MMAC gene transfer exhibited significantly decreased vascularity both in an orthotopic and in an ectopic model.

We have found that a short treatment with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) induces tolerance to fully mismatched mouse islet allografts, and that this tolerance is stable to challenge with donor-type spleen cells and allows acceptance of donor-type vascularized heart grafts. This effect is enhanced by co-administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a selective inhibitor of T and B cell proliferation, that also has effects similar to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) on DCs. Graft acceptance is associated with impaired development of type 1 CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells and an increased percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory cells expressing CD152 in the spleen and in the draining lymph node. Transfer of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells from tolerant mice protects 100% of the syngeneic recipients from islet allograft rejection. CD4(+)CD25(+) cells that are able to inhibit the T cell response to a pancreatic autoantigen and to significantly delay disease transfer by pathogenic CD4(+)CD25(-) cells are also induced by treatment of adult nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice with a selected vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand. This treatment arrests progression of insulitis and Th1 cell infiltration, and inhibits diabetes development at non-hypercalcemic doses. The enhancement of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells able to mediate transplantation tolerance and to arrest type 1 diabetes development by a short oral treatment with small organic compounds that induce tolerogenic DCs, like VDR ligands, suggests possible clinical applications of this approach.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2003-05-03", "authors": ["LucianoAdorini"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb06057.x"}

Our model involves engraftment of fully allogeneic T cell depleted donor bone marrow cells in low dose irradiated and anti-CD3 treated major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-disparate recipient mice. To investigate whether vascularized organ grafts are accepted in our model, we performed heterotopic heart transplantations in our mixed chimeric mice. Chimeric mice permanently accepted hearts from the bone marrow donor (>130 days) and rapidly rejected third party-type allografts (median survival time 9 days). Untreated control recipient mice rejected both donor- and third party-type allografts. In addition, mice that accepted their cardiac grafts, donor-specific acceptance of skin grafts was observed.

In pregnancy, blood flow in the placenta is crucial for sustaining normal growth and development of the fetus. This is the first AVP receptor study in the placenta and fetal membranes. The aim was to compare, quantitatively, the level of V1a gene expression with that of a known marker for vascularization, aquaporin 1 (AQP1). V1a and AQP1 gene expression did not correlate; placental V1a mRNA levels were significantly upregulated at 45 and 66+/-1 compared with 27, 100+/-4, and 140 days (term approximately 150 days). V1a mRNA levels were much lower in fetal membranes in which no significant difference across gestation was observed. In situ hybridization histochemistry localized V1a gene expression in the maternal component of the placenta similar to the receptor-binding studies using 125I-labeled [d(CH2)5, sarcosine7] vasopressin. No AVP gene expression was observed in the placenta and fetal membranes, which eliminates local AVP production. This increase in V1a expression at 45 and 66+/-1 days of gestation correlates with the period of maximal placental growth in the sheep and suggests that AVP and V1a receptors may play a hitherto unrecognized role in placental growth, differentiation, and/or function, particularly in the deleterious effects of heat stress, early in pregnancy, on fetal growth.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2003-05-02", "authors": ["IreneKoukoulas", "JohnRisvanis", "RebeccaDouglas-Denton", "Louise MBurrell", "Karen MMoritz", "E MarelynWintour"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.102.013458"}

Although embryos are usually semiallogeneic with their mother, viviparous animals are required to allow these embryos to develop inside the maternal body, but must also eliminate an \"invasion\" by nonself. In colonial ascidians of the family Botryllidae, when two colonies are brought into contact at their growing edges, a hemolytic rejection reaction occurs between allogeneic colonies. Morula cells, a type of hemocyte, are the major effector cells in the hemolytic rejection. Morula cells infiltrate and aggregate where the two colonies make contact, and then discharge their vacuolar contents, which contain phenoloxidase and quinones. In viviparous botryllids, colonial contact at artificially cut surfaces always results in colonial fusion and establishment of a common vascular network even between allogeneic colonies in which the growing-edge contact results in rejection. This colonial fusion between incompatible colonies (surgical fusion) suggests that the allorecognition sites are not distributed in the vascular system in which the embryos are brooded. It is supposed that a common ancestor of the viviparous species lost the capacity for allorecognition in their vascular system to protect its embryos from alloreactivity, when it changed from ovoviviparous to viviparous in the course of evolution. The limited distribution of allorecognition sites would be a solution to the embryo-parent histoincompatibility in viviparity.", "journal": "Zoological science", "date": "2003-04-30", "authors": ["EuichiHirose"], "doi": "10.2108/zsj.20.387"}

Twenty-four specimens of amputated limbs of patients suffering from arteriopathy of the lower limbs allowed us to study the vascular anatomy of this flap after intra-arterial injection of colored latex. At the time of the amputation the average age of the patients was 68.5 years. The clinical signs of arteriopathy had been present for 3-16 years. In 10 cases the amputation was performed directly, in 14 cases after an unsuccessful attempt at revascularization. The dissection results revealed certain specificities in the vascularization of the LSMF with arteriopathy. The perforating branch of the peroneal artery was found in all cases. The descending branch of this perforating artery was found to be patent in 22 cases but slim in five cases. It was absent in two cases. The superficial peroneal nerve and its vascular network always participated in the vascularization of the flap.

Cytokeratin 12 stained very weakly in the peripheral and superficial corneal epithelium in 12-month-old Pax6(+/-) mice.\nCorneal abnormalities in Pax6(+/-) mice are similar to those in aniridia-related keratopathy in PAX6(+/-) patients. This extends the relevance of this mouse model of human aniridia to include corneal abnormalities. Incursion of goblet cells suggests impaired function of Pax6(+/-) limbal stem cells, abnormal expression of cytokeratin 12 may result in greater epithelial fragility, and corneal opacities in older mice may reflect poor wound-healing responses to accumulated environmental insults.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2003-04-26", "authors": ["ThayaRamaesh", "J MartinCollinson", "KannaRamaesh", "Matthew HKaufman", "John DWest", "BaljeanDhillon"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.02-0576"}
{"title": "Association between an increased surface area of peritoneal microvessels and a high peritoneal solute transport rate.", "abstract": "The peritoneal solute transport rate (PSTR) often increases, especially for small solutes, during long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment. Although the mechanism by which PSTR increases in PD patients is not known, it is likely that an increased PSTR reflects an increased surface area of the peritoneal capillary and post-capillary venules (microvessels), but this has not previously been investigated. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between PSTR and peritoneal microvessel alterations in biopsy specimens of peritoneum obtained from PD patients after various times on PD, and the possible contribution of the duration of PD in relation to these alterations.\nTissue from the parietal peritoneum was obtained from 22 PD patients (age 48.5 +/- 9.0 years, duration of PD 66.3 +/- 46.6 months, incidence of peritonitis 0.3/patient-year). The patients were subdivided into three groups according to duration of PD: zero months (group 0, n = 4), less than 60 months (group I, n = 7), and more than 60 months (group II; n = 11).\nFor each specimen, the relative microvessel area (RVA) calculated as total area of microvessels/total area of peritoneal field, and the relative microvessel number (RVN), calculated as number of microvessels/total area of peritoneal field, were determined. The ratio RVA/RVN was used to assess the average area of microvessels. The PSTR was evaluated for creatinine, glucose, beta2-microglobulin, and albumin using the peritoneal equilibration test.\nThe dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratio (D/P) for creatinine showed a significant positive correlation with both RVA (rho = 0.77, p < 0.001) and RVA/RVN (rho = 0.51, p = 0.01), but not with RVN. The D/P for beta2-microglobulin correlated with RVA (rho = 0.51, p = 0.015) but not with RVN or RVA/RVN. No differences were found between the three groups in the values for RVN, whereas there was an apparent significant increase in RVA with time on PD (p < 0.001 for group 0 vs both groups I and II). Furthermore, in high transporters, RVA tended to be higher in group II than in group I.\nThe present study demonstrates for the first time that an increased peritoneal solute transport rate (for both creatinine and beta2-microglobulin) is associated with an increased surface area of peritoneal microvessels, especially in patients on long-term PD treatment. This indicates that increased vascularization and/or dilatation of peritoneal microvessels may play a key role in the development of a high PSTR.", "journal": "Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis", "date": "2003-04-26", "authors": ["MiwakoNumata", "MasaakiNakayama", "SatoshiNimura", "MakioKawakami", "BengtLindholm", "YoshindoKawaguchi"], "doi": null}

Overexpression of recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) by such xenografts induced functional and morphologic alterations of preexisting vessels. We now describe the effects of VEGF-A expression on visualization of these brain tumors in mice by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using gadolinium diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) and ultra small paramagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO) as contrast agents. Brain lesions derived from (mock-transfected) Mel57 cells were undetectable in MRI after Gd-DTPA injection. However, the majority of such lesions became visible after injection of USPIO, due to the lower vascular density in the lesions as compared to the surrounding parenchyma. In contrast, VEGF-A-expressing lesions were visualized using Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI by a rapid circumferential enhancement, due to leaky peritumoral vasculature. USPIO-enhanced MRI of these tumors corroborated the immunohistochemic finding that peritumorally located, highly irregular and dilated vessels were present, while intratumoral vessel density was low. Our study shows that VEGF-A is a key factor in imaging of brain neoplasms. Our data also demonstrate that, at least in brain, blood-pool agent-enhanced MRI may be a valuable diagnostic tool to detect malignancies that are not visible on Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Furthermore, the involvement of VEGF-A in MRI visibility suggests that care must be taken with MRI-based evaluation of antiangiogenic therapy, as anti-VEGF treatment might revert a tumor to a co-opting phenotype, resulting in loss of contrast enhancement in MRI.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2003-04-25", "authors": ["WilliamLeenders", "BennoK\u00fcsters", "JeroenPikkemaat", "PieterWesseling", "DirkRuiter", "ArendHeerschap", "JelleBarentsz", "Robert M Wde Waal"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.11102"}

Hypoxia is considered to be an important factor in the aetiology of tendon degeneration.\nStatements from the literature regarding the vascularization of the Achilles tendon are controversial. We determined the vascular density of the Achilles tendon using a new method involving antibodies against laminin, a component of the basement membrane.\nThe blood supply of the Achilles tendon mainly arose from the anterior paratenon of the tendon from which vessels run into the tendon. The proximal part of the tendon was supplied by a recurrent branch of the posterior tibial artery, while the distal part of the tendon was vascularized by the rete arteriosum calcaneare, supplied by the fibular and posterior tibial arteries. An avascular area could be seen close to the insertion of the tendon to the calcaneus. Three regions with different vascular density could be determined in the Achilles tendon. The distal part of the Achilles tendon had a vascular density of 56.6 vessels/cm(2). In the middle part of the tendon, the vascular density was much lower: 28.2 vessels/cm(2). The proximal part of the tendon had a vascular density of 73.4 vessels/cm(2).\nThe reduced vascularization in the tendon waist may be a predisposing factor for degeneration and spontaneous rupture of the human Achilles tendon.", "journal": "Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery", "date": "2003-04-25", "authors": ["ThoreZantop", "BernhardTillmann", "WolfPetersen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00402-003-0491-2"}

The dynamic studies included color Doppler sonography in 22 individuals (44 hands) and five-channel plethysmography in 40 individuals (40 right hands). It was found that the ulnar artery is dominant at the elbow, but after originating its collateral branches, the radial artery becomes the dominant artery in the distal forearm and, consequently, constitutes the major source of vascularization to the hand.

{"title": "Procoagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms in human placenta.", "abstract": "The placenta is a highly vascularized organ functioning as the interface between fetal blood, which is confined within the villous blood vessels, and maternal blood, which flows in decidual arteries and washes the intervillous spaces in contact with syncytiotrophoblast (STB) cells. The STB adopts vascular characteristics such as the presence of von Willebrand factor (vWF), CD31 markers, adhesion molecules, and coagulation components. The special structure of the placenta requires efficient mechanisms for fast activation and localized regulation of coagulation. The presence of procoagulant and anticoagulant components on placental vascular endothelial cells (EC) and STB is essential for hemostasis. Activation of coagulation may be a favored process, as suggested by elevated fibrin depositions documented in some pathologic states. Increased localized procoagulant components such as tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1, PAI-2), are associated with some pregnancy complications. Several anticoagulants regulate placental coagulation: tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is primarily produced in EC; TFPI-2, a variant of TFPI, has been purified from the placenta and was identified in the STB lining the villi; thrombomodulin, a membrane glycoprotein that activates protein C, is localized in EC and apical membranes of STB; annexin V, an anticoagulant that binds to negative membrane phospholipids, is abundant on normal placental STB, whereas reduced STB annexin V was associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The placenta is a putative source of coagulation components.

{"title": "Transoral carbon-dioxide laser resection of hypopharyngeal carcinoma.", "abstract": "In hypopharyngeal carcinoma, open partial resection is rarely feasible because of the high rate of chronic aspiration. Transoral laser surgery, however, is not associated with major swallowing problems. Between 1991 and 1995, a total of 29 patients with cancer of the hypopharynx were treated using laser surgical resection. In 25 patients, a neck dissection was performed, and 26 patients were radiated postoperatively. The 5-year overall survival was 48% and tumor-related survival 58%. The outcome was significantly ( P<0.048) dependent on the preoperative lymph node status (N(0)=74%, N(+)=34% overall survival). Accordingly, the 5-year survival in stage I and stage II tumors was 71% and in stage III and IV tumors 47%. The highest local control rate was achieved in patients with carcinoma of the hypopharyngeal walls. A major advantage of laser surgery is that resurfacing of the wounds takes place per secundam. No reconstructions with free vascularized grafts have to be performed. There were no functional deficits regarding speech and swallowing in 94%, 100% and 100% of the surviving patients without local recurrence after 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively. No patient had to have a tracheostomy intraoperatively.

Regulation of HIF occurs mainly through oxygen-dependent destruction of its alpha subunit. In the presence of oxygen, two HIFalpha prolyl residues undergo enzymatic hydroxylation, which is required for its proteasomal degradation. We therefore tested whether pharmacological activation of HIFalpha by hydroxylase inhibitors may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemic diseases. Three distinct prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors-l-mimosine (L-Mim), ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-DHB), and 6-chlor-3-hydroxychinolin-2-carbonic acid-N-carboxymethylamid (S956711)-demonstrated similar effects to hypoxia (0.5% O2) by inducing HIFalpha protein in human and rodent cells. L-Mim, S956711, and, less effectively, 3,4-DHB also induced HIF target genes in cultured cells, including glucose transporter 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, as well as HIF-dependent reporter gene expression. Systemic administration of L-Mim and S956711 in rats led to HIFalpha induction in the kidney. In a sponge model for angiogenesis, repeated local injection of the inhibitors strongly increased invasion of highly vascularized tissue into the sponge centers.

We describe the development and application of the directed in vivo angiogenesis assay (DIVAA) and demonstrated that it is reproducible and quantitative. This assay consists of subcutaneous implantation of semiclosed silicone cylinders (angioreactors) into nude mice. Angioreactors are filled with only 18 micro l of extracellular matrix premixed with or without angiogenic factors. Vascularization within angioreactors is quantified by the intravenous injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran before their recovery, followed by spectrofluorimetry. Angioreactors examined by immunofluorescence show cells and invading angiogenic vessels at different developmental stages. The minimally detectable angiogenic response requires 9 days after implantation and >/=50 ng/ml (P < 0.01) of either fibroblast growth factor-2 or vascular endothelial growth factor. Characterization of this assay system demonstrates that the FITC-labeled dextran quantitation is highly reproducible and that levels of FITC-dextran are not significantly influenced by vascular permeability. DIVAA allows accurate dose-response analysis and identification of effective doses of angiogenesis-modulating factors in vivo. TNP-470 potently inhibits angiogenesis (EC(50) = 88 pmol/L) induced by 500 ng/ml of fibroblast growth factor-2. This inhibition correlates with decreased endothelial cell invasion. DIVAA efficiently detects differences in anti-angiogenic potencies of thrombospondin-1 peptides (25 micro mol/L) and demonstrates a partial inhibition of angiogenesis ( approximately 40%) in a matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2-deficient mouse compared with that in wild-type animals.

Whereas VEGF is up-regulated in only a portion of anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), it is overexpressed in most glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and the level of expression is correlated with grade of glioma. To explore the possibility that VEGF may act as a driving force in the progression of AA to GBM, the VEGF isoforms VEGF(121) and VEGF(165) were overexpressed in genetically modified, mutant H-Ras-transformed human astrocytes that on intracranial implantation form AA-like tumors. The ability of the VEGF isoforms to stimulate growth, angiogenesis, oxygenation, and the formation of necrotic GBM-like tumors was then monitored. The parental mutant H-Ras-modified astrocytes expressed four times more endogenous VEGF than normal human astrocytes, but on intracranial implantation formed hypovascular, hypoxic, small AA-like tumors. Whereas these modest levels of VEGF overexpression were insufficient to drive oxygenation and GBM formation, an additional 8-fold increase in VEGF expression mediated by retroviral infection with constructs encoding either VEGF (121) or VEGF (165) resulted in cells which, after intracranial implantation, formed tumors that were larger, more vascular, and better oxygenated than those formed by the mutant H-ras parental cells. However, the tumors formed by the cells expressing exogenous VEGF (121) or VEGF (165) retained the phenotype of AA, lacking areas of necrosis that are the hallmark of the GBM phenotype. These results suggest that whereas the VEGF(121) and VEGF(165) isoforms can contribute to glioma vascularization, oxygenation, and growth, they do not in and of themselves drive the formation of the GBM phenotype.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-04-19", "authors": ["YukihikoSonoda", "MasayukiKanamori", "Dennis FDeen", "Shi-YuanCheng", "Mitchel SBerger", "Russell OPieper"], "doi": null}

Promoters are generally tested in transgenic mice before generating transgenic pigs. Several promoters have been used to drive endothelial cell-specific expression in mice but none have yet been tested in pigs. We compared the promoters of three human genes that are predominantly expressed in vascular endothelium: intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) and endoglin. Expression of human complement regulatory proteins (hCRPs), directed by each of the promoters in mice, was largely restricted to vascular endothelium and leukocyte subpopulations. However, expression from the PECAM-1 promoter was weak in liver and non-uniform in the small vessels of heart, kidney, and lung. Conversely, expression from the endoglin promoter was consistently strong in the small vessels of these organs but was absent in larger vessels. The ICAM-2 promoter, which produced strong and uniform endothelial expression in all organs examined, was therefore used to generate hCRP transgenic pigs. Leukocytes from 57 pigs containing at least one intact transgene were tested for transgene expression by flow cytometry. Forty-seven of these transgenic pigs were further analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of liver biopsies, and 18 by staining of heart and kidney sections. Only two of the pigs showed expression, which appeared to be restricted to vascular endothelium in heart and kidney but was markedly weaker than in transgenic mice produced with the same batch of DNA. Thus, in this case, promoter performance in mice and pigs was not equivalent. The weak expression driven by the human ICAM-2 promoter in pigs relative to mice suggests the need for additional regulatory elements to achieve species-specific gene expression in pigs.", "journal": "Xenotransplantation", "date": "2003-04-16", "authors": ["Peter JCowan", "Trixie AShinkel", "NellaFisicaro", "James WGodwin", "CarmeloBernab\u00e9u", "NuriaAlmendro", "CarlosRius", "Andrew JLonie", "Mark BNottle", "Peter LWigley", "KathyPaizis", "Martin JPearse", "Anthony J Fd'Apice"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1399-3089.2003.01140.x"}

Recently, a number of additional costimulatory pathways have been described and preliminary data suggest that they play important roles in alloimmunity. However, the interactions between these different pathways are not well understood. We studied the effect of targeting ICOS ligand, B7RP1, in a rat cardiac transplant model, with and without concomitant blockade of the B7 pathway using CTLA4Ig. In a fully mismatched WF to LEW vascularized cardiac allograft model, without therapy, grafts were acutely rejected (MST 10.8 +/- 1.6 days). Early (day of transplant) B7RP1 blockade with ICOSIg alone had little effect on graft survival and rather than being additive with B7 blockade, ICOSIg abrogated the prolonged graft survival induced by CTLA4Ig treatment. By contrast, delayed (day 2 post-transplant) blockade of B7RP1 did not have such an effect. These findings were not related to cytokine deviation but may be in part related to the pattern of down-regulation of B7.2 expression following early B7RP1 blockade.

Here, we characterized rejection of skin and vascularized cardiac allografts in these mice, which we term ABM (for anti-bm12). In vivo proliferative experiments reveal that all CD4 T cells in ABM mice react to bm12 antigens. Surprisingly, while ABM mice have accelerated (compared to B6 recipients) rejection of bm12 skin allografts, they, like B6 recipients, fail to acutely reject bm12 cardiac allografts. This is not due to lack of immunogenicity of bm12 hearts, as these grafts are acutely rejected by primed ABM recipients, although not by primed B6 recipients. Lastly, long-term surviving bm12 grafts in ABM recipients are relatively free from chronic rejection (compared with B6 recipients), which may be due to skewing of the CD4 repertoire towards direct alloreactivity, and consequent lack of CD4 mediated indirect allorecognition as evidenced by the lack of IgG deposition in those grafts.

In some respects, KS is analogous to other angioproliferative diseases, in that KS lesions are highly vascularized and promoted by inflammatory cytokines. However, unlike other cancers or inflammatory mediated vascular diseases, KS is unique in that the KS lesional cells both express and respond to the complete angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Therefore, the angiogenic phenotype, which is crucial for cancer progression, is inherent to KS tumor cells. Due to the recognized importance of angiogenesis in cancer progression, numerous angiostatic agents are being investigated as potential therapeutic agents. One such agent is endostatin, which is a 20-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII that has demonstrated potent angiostatic activities at both the in vivo and in vitro levels. Since endostatin is recognized as a potent angiostatic agent, the majority of in vitro endostatin studies have evaluated its effects on endothelial cells. Although KS cells are speculated to arise from endothelial cell precursors and KS lesions are highly vascularized, no previous studies have investigated endostatin-KS cell interactions. This present study evaluated endostatin's effects on KS tumor cell: (i) signal transduction (endostatin internalization and transcription factor activation), and (ii) migration and invasion (functional activity assays and tropomysin co-localization). Our results show that KS cells rapidly internalize endostatin and that endostatin initiates activation of the transcription activating factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activating protein 1 (AP-1). Our data also show that internalized endostatin co-localizes to tropomysin microfilaments and acts to inhibit KS cell migration and invasion in response to the clinically relevant angiogenic cytokines VEGF and bFGF.

SDF-1 is also a potent chemoattractant for T cells and has roles in both inflammation and immune homeostasis. Our group has previously demonstrated that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is activated in SDF-1-stimulated T cells and is indeed required for SDF-1-mediated chemotaxis. In this study Jurkat clones were established, stably expressing dominant negative constructs of class IA and class IB PI 3-kinases under the control of the tetracycline off inducible gene system, to determine the relative roles of these PI 3-kinases in SDF-1 signaling. Our results show that expression of either kinase-dead PI3Kgamma (KD-PI3Kgamma) or Deltap85 (a construct unable to bind class I(A) p110alpha, -beta, or -delta) leads to a partial inhibition of SDF-1-stimulated protein kinase B phosphorylation, but had no effect on SDF-1-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2. Functional studies demonstrated that expression of KD-PI3Kgamma markedly inhibited SDF-1-mediated chemotaxis, typically eliciting 40-60% inhibition. Interestingly, the expression of Deltap85 also leads to inhibition of the SDF-1-mediated chemotactic response, albeit to a much lesser extent than achieved with the KD-PI3Kgamma mutant, typically in the range of 20-40% inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition of chemotaxis by the expression of dominant negative class IA or class IB PI 3-kinases could be enhanced by the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002.

We therefore studied angiogenesis in 25 patients: 14 with glioblastoma multiforme and 11 with grade I meningioma. Our aim was to assess how angiogenesis conditions growth and necrosis. The patients underwent MRI with standard and perfusion sequences. We calculated the volume of each tumour; for the glioblastomas the solid portion was taken as the difference between the overall volume and the volume of any necrotic portion. In the glioblastomas, we found an inverse relationship between blood volume and the size of the tumour, whereas in the meningiomas there was of a direct relationship. These correlations confirm in vivo the knowledge about necrosis in glioblastomas and its relationship to their inadequate vascular network. On the contrary, grade 1 meningiomas show an equilibrium between their microcirculation and the cellular component.", "journal": "Neuroradiology", "date": "2003-04-11", "authors": ["MPrincipi", "MItaliani", "AGuiducci", "IAprile", "MMuti", "GGiulianelli", "POttaviano"], "doi": "10.1007/s00234-002-0937-1"}

The complication of urethrocutaneous fistula in hypospadias surgery as a result of using this technique is also evaluated.\nA retrospective review (July 1999 to September 2002) identified 180 pediatric patients who had undergone primary hypospadias surgery by a single surgeon. A modified technique of harvesting a vascularized dartos pedicle was incorporated in 111 hypospadias repairs. A ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle of tissue was used to cover a modified urethroplasty as described by Snodgrass.\nThe intraoperative meatal position before urethroplasty was subcoronal in 95 cases, penile/midshaft in 11 and penoscrotal in 5. The majority of patients (90 of 111) were younger than 12 months at surgery. Ages ranged from 5 months to 16 years (mean 21.1 months). Of the 111 patients reconstruction using the ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle to cover the urethroplasty was successful in 109 (98.2%), and at followup they have an acceptable cosmetic result with no evidence of urethrocutaneous fistula. In 1 patient with distal hypospadias a urethrocutaneous fistula developed, which was recognized 20 months postoperatively. Another patient with penoscrotal hypospadias had a proximal fistula at 6 months. There were no recognized intraoperative urethral injuries or complications. Followup ranged from 3 to 38 months (mean 19.1).\nThe ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle urethral coverage procedure is an easy and reliable technique to harvest adequate vascularized tissue to cover a hypospadias urethroplasty.

Currently, the armamentarium of therapeutic contact lenses allows the clinician to select lenses that not only protect the corneal surface but also assist in modulation of the healing process. This article summarizes the available contact lenses, the conditions most amenable to treatment, and the decision-making process that allows optimal selection of a therapeutic contact lens for a specific patient. Many of the hydrophilic soft contact lenses used for cosmetic correction are not approved for therapeutic use but have been used in an off-label manner as therapeutic lenses. Communicating with the patient is important when recommending the use of a therapeutic contact lens, explaining the goals of therapy, warning about the risks contingent upon contact lens use, and determining whether the lens is being used in an off-label fashion. The advances in contact lens technology have opened new options for use of therapeutic contact lenses. With a new generation of high-Dk lenses whose makers promise fewer limiting problems of vascularization and infection, the utility of the older, traditional therapeutic lenses can be enhanced and the more selective application of individual lenses can be permitted.

{"title": "Tissular insemination of progenitor endothelial cells: the problem, and a suggested solution.", "abstract": "The contribution of circulating precursor endothelial cells (CPEC) to adult angiogenesis is now well established. However, the mechanism of their tissular engrafting remains poorly understood. The classical paradigm of \"sprouting\" cannot accommodate the main features of the CPEC-based angiogenic process. Additionally, vasculogenesis based on the differentiation of angioblasts, as defined in the embryonic stages, is not applicable to adult neo-vascularization either. In search for a solution to this dilemma, I suggest that the ability of monocytes/macrophages to produce tunnels, as effect of their protease-dependent migration in the extracellular matrices, is instrumental for the tissular insemination of CPEC. Here I present in vivo and in vitro experimental evidence for the existence of tunnels, and for their colonization by monocytes/macrophages and by other cells, including CPEC. As a paradigm of CPEC behavior, the tunneling model (in an extended sense) may also explain the propagation of the endothelium with arteriolar phenotype within the pre-existent downstream capillary network. Thus, the sprouting mechanism might be a valid explanation for the formation of new capillaries and venules, whereas CPEC would contribute mostly, if not exclusively, to the extension of arteriolar branches of microvasculature. Adult angiogenesis occurs therefore as a multifunctional process based on intercellular cooperation, in which there are involved endothelial cells (EC) or their precursors, as well as other cell types. In specific circumstances, the lumen (i.e. the tunnel) may occur before the \"definitive\" microvessel. Therefore the very notion of microvessel may need to be extended, to include the tunnels.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2003-04-04", "authors": ["Nicanor IMoldovan"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4615-0169-5_10"}
{"title": "Evidence from a leukemia model for maintenance of vascular endothelium by bone-marrow-derived endothelial cells.", "abstract": "The maintenance of tissues of virtually all organs depends on a sufficient blood supply. During embryogenesis, primitive blood vessels are formed de novo by the aggregation of angioblasts, a process that is termed vasculogenesis. In postnatal life, the development of new blood vessels is restricted to the female reproductive tract (during the ovulatory cycle) and to sites of wound healing, and occurs through a process called angiogenesis, i.e. the sprouting of new vessels from the preexisting vasculature. However, neovascularization can also occur under pathological conditions, e.g. tumor cells can \"switch on\" angiogenesis. New blood vessels bring in nutrients and proteins, so the tumor mass can expand. In fact, neovascularization appears to be one of the crucial steps in the transition of a tumor from a small cluster of malignant cells to a visible macroscopic tumor capable of spreading to other organs via the vasculature throughout the body. The association of tumor growth with the development of a vascular network was recognized nearly a century ago. Using a leukemia model, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), we were able to provide evidence for the existence of a hemangioblastic progenitor cell in the bone marrow of adult humans. Using the pathognomonic BCR-ABL-fusion gene as a genetic marker present in virtually all bone marrow derived cells of patients with CML, we were able to show that endothelial cells belong to the malignant cell clone, since they also contain the BCR-ABL-fusion gene. Our data suggest that CML arises from a hemangioblastic progenitor cell, the progeny of which are malignant blood cells and genotypically clonal endothelial cells. Thus, we provide substantial evidence that indeed a hemangioblast exists in the bone marrow of human adults. In addition, our data imply that normal as well as genotypically malignant bone-marrow-derived endothelial cells can contribute to maintenance angiogenesis in the vascular endothelium, a condition that is consistent with postnatal vasculogenesis. These findings were recently confirmed by other groups and should help in elucidating the pathophysiology of malignant and nonmalignant disorders. The integration of bone-marrow-derived endothelial cells into the vascular endothelium has implications for the development of vascular targeting strategies (e.g., gene therapy) for vascular diseases, inflammatory disorders, and cancer. The characterization of the hemangioblast at a clonal level as well as the translation of these findings into a clinically applicable concept for the delivery of therapeutic genes to malignant tumors is currently in progress in our laboratory.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2003-04-04", "authors": ["EberhardGunsilius"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4615-0169-5_3"}

Ideally, these two procedures are combined in one operation, utilizing a soft tissue flap with an attached vascularized bone fragment. The lateral arm flap can provide such an osteoseptocutaneous flap and has been utilized clinically with success; however, the vascular anatomy of the flap, especially the humeral fragment, has not been described in detail previously, and there is broad disagreement concerning its innervation. In this study, the arteries and nerves of 24 fresh cadaver arms were dissected after injection of colored latex. The levels of origin of the periosteal arteries of the humerus were also documented. The lateral arm flap has a consistent arterial supply from three septocutaneous perforating branches that are arranged in a predictable pattern. The lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus is vascularized by direct branches of the posterior branch of the radial collateral artery and by arteries that arise from muscular branches supplying adjacent muscles. The innervation of the lateral arm flap is by the inferior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm. Knowledge of the consistent vascular anatomy of the lateral humerus and soft tissue of the donor site allows an osteoseptocutaneous flap to be raised safely with an appropriate technique.

Expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF was examined in 4 colorectal carcinoma cell lines (COLO320DM, COLO201, DLD-1, WiDr) and 149 colorectal carcinoma tissues (10 fresh specimens, 139 archival, paraffin-embedded specimens). HIF-1alpha protein levels were increased by hypoxia in 3 of 4 colorectal carcinoma cell lines (COLO201, DLD-1, WiDr), and VEGF mRNA levels were also increased by hypoxia in the same cell lines.

Of 139 archival specimens of colorectal carcinoma, 81 (58.3%) expressed HIF-1alpha protein at a high level. HIF-1alpha expression was correlated with tumor invasion, tumor stage, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion and liver metastasis. Moreover, HIF-1alpha expression was correlated significantly with VEGF expression and microvessel density.

We tested whether continuous perimuscular administration of Spalax vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) DNA could increase tissue perfusion in a murine hindlimb ischemia model. Placebo or VEGF +/- internal ribosome entry site (IRES) was continuously administrated perimuscularly in the ischemic zone by using an infusion pump. None of the mice in the VEGF-treated group (>50 microg) developed visible necrosis vs. 33% of the placebo group. Microscopic necrosis was observed only in the placebo group. Spalax VEGF muscular infiltration resulted in a faster and more complete restoration of blood flow. The restoration of blood flow by VEGF was dose-dependent and more robust and rapid when using the VEGF-IRES elements. The flow restoration using continuous perimuscular infiltration was faster than single i.m. injections. Vessel density was higher in the VEGF and VEGF-IRES (-) groups compared with the placebo. Continuous perimuscular administration of angiogenic gene therapy offers a new approach to restore blood flow to an ischemic limb. Incorporation of an IRES element may assist in the expression of transgenes delivered to ischemic tissues.

During the first three years of follow-up the reconstruction underwent important morphological changes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk of fracture of the reconstructed proximal femur, once the physiological loads are restored, associated with a short, slow but unprotected level walk. Subject-specific finite element models of the operated femur, and of the intact contralateral one, were generated from a computed tomography exam, taken for routine clinical monitoring at month 33 of follow-up. The material properties were mapped on to the mesh and a loading condition comprising the hip joint reaction and the abductor muscle force was simulated. The risk of fracture was locally estimated, for the operated and intact femur, using the ratio between the bone tissue strength and the predicted Von Mises equivalent stress, taking into account the different behaviours of the bone tissue in tension or compression. The results showed that although the fibula grew dramatically during follow-up, the reconstructed femur had not recovered the whole mechanical strength of a normal femur. The reconstructed femoral neck seemed to be weaker than the contralateral one and hence at a higher fracture risk. However, no region reached the failure limit, so the model predicted no fracture of the femur if a short, slow but unprotected walk were allowed.

The patients were examined twice by the first observer and once by the second observer. The acquired volume datasets were analyzed using the VOCAL imaging program, enabling the assessment of ovarian volume, vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), vascularization flow index (VFI) and mean grayness (MG). For these parameters the intraclass (intra-CC) and interclass (inter-CC) correlation coefficients, within-observer and between-observers repeatability coefficient (r) and limits of agreement were calculated.\nBoth intraobserver and interobserver repeatability of ovarian volume measurements were considered very good with an intra-CC value of 1.00 and inter-CC value of 0.99, respectively. Also VI, FI, VFI and MG measurements were repeatable by a single observer, the intra-CC ranging from 0.82 to 0.91. The interobserver reproducibility was also good for VI, VFI and MG measurements (inter-CC values 0.73, 0.70 and 0.81, respectively), but for FI measurements the reproducibility was poor (inter-CC = 0.29, r = 7.87).\nIn general, the intraobserver reproducibility was better than interobserver reproducibility for all parameters. The volume assessments were reproducible both by one observer and by two separate observers. The intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were acceptable for VI, VFI and MG, whereas for FI the interobserver reproducibility was poor. Our results suggest that measurement of gray-scale and color Doppler flow indices is reproducible thus allowing them to be used in clinical practice and research.", "journal": "Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology", "date": "2003-04-01", "authors": ["I YJ\u00e4rvel\u00e4", "PSladkevicius", "A HTekay", "SCampbell", "GNargund"], "doi": "10.1002/uog.62"}

Severe infection and extensive tissue necrosis were present prior to surgical operation in 12 patients. Eleven patients were treated with pedicled omental flaps, and 9 patients with free omental flaps. The size of the omental flaps ranged from 20 cm x 12 cm to 38 cm x 23 cm.\nAll the omental flaps survived. Healing at the first intention of the wounds was achieved in 17 cases. The on-top skin grafts resulted in partial necrosis of lipid liquefaction developed in the omentum and healed with dressing change in 2 cases. A sinus tract of osteomyelitis occurred in one case and healed after delayed excision of the necrosed bone. Follow-up study of all cases from 3 to 24 months showed no recurrent wounds and post-operative abdominal complication. Recovery with acceptable appearance and restoration of function was satisfactory.\nGreater omentum provides a well-vascularized tissue with lymphatic ducts for wound coverage. It has strong resistance against infection. It is very malleable and can be molded easily.

In 47 patients (group I), use of omentum was prophylactic to aid in the healing of closures or anastomoses considered to be at high risk for failure. In 32 patients (group II), omentum was used in the treatment of problems complicated by established infection. In 6 patients (group III), omentum was used for coverage of prosthetic chest wall replacements after extensive chest wall resection.\nOverall, omental transposition was successful in its prophylactic or therapeutic purpose in 88% of these difficult cases (75/85).

Mobilization and recruitment of these cells are essential for tissue revascularization. Physiological stress, secondary to tissue injury or tumor growth, results in the release of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes mobilization of stem cells to the circulation, contributing to the formation of functional vasculature. VEGF interacts with its receptors, VEGFR2 and VEGFR1, expressed on endothelial and hematopoietic stem cells, and thereby promotes recruitment of these cells to neo-angiogenic sites, accelerating the revascularization process. The mobilization of stem cells from marrow is a dynamic process, regulated by shear stress imparted by blood flow, and the activation of metalloproteinases that induce the release of 'Kit ligand', facilitating egress from the marrow to the circulation.

Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring polymer associated with various cellular processes involved in wound healing, such as angiogenesis. Hyaluronic acid also presents unique advantages: it is easy to produce and modify, hydrophilic and nonadhesive, and naturally biodegradable. We prepared a range of glycidyl methacrylate-HA (GMHA) conjugates, which were subsequently photopolymerized to form crosslinked GMHA hydrogels. A range of hydrogel degradation rates was achieved as well as a corresponding, modest range of material properties (e.g., swelling, mesh size). Increased amounts of conjugated methacrylate groups corresponded with increased crosslink densities and decreased degradation rates and yet had an insignificant effect on human aortic endothelial cell cytocompatibility and proliferation. Rat subcutaneous implants of the GMHA hydrogels showed good biocompatibility, little inflammatory response, and similar levels of vascularization at the implant edge compared with those of fibrin positive controls.

The vascularisation of human telencephalon takes place by means of an angiogenic mechanism, which starts at the beginning of corticogenesis and actively proceeds up to the last neuronal migration, when the basic scheme of the vascular network has been drawn. Our study focused on VEGF during this critical developmental period with the aim of identifying the cells that express VEGF and of correlating the events of angiogenesis with the main events of cerebral cortex formation. The results show that in fetal human brain VEGF protein is located on multiple cell types, cells proper to the nervous tissue, neuroepithelial cells, neuroblasts and radial glia cells, and non-neuronal cells, endothelial and periendothelial cells.

{"title": "Validation and analysis of a mathematical model of a replication-competent oncolytic virus for cancer treatment: implications for virus design and delivery.", "abstract": "Motivated by the rapid expansion in the development of replication-competent viral agents for the treatment of solid tumors, we formulated and analyzed a three-dimensional mathematical model of a tumor that is infected by a replication-competent virus. We initially considered three patterns of intratumoral injection in which a fixed fraction of cells are initially infected with the virus throughout (a) the entire tumor, (b) the tumor core, and (c) the tumor rim, respectively. For each injection pattern, an approximate analysis of the model provides a simple and accurate condition for whether the virus will eradicate the tumor. The model was then generalized to incorporate nutrient-limited necrosis and an innate immune response against virus-infected tumor cells. Recent preclinical and clinical data were used to validate the model and estimate key parameter values. Our analysis has the following implications: even in the absence of an immune response, tumor eradication requires widespread distribution of the virus within the tumor at the time of infection; core or rim injections alone may result in tumor escape, particularly in a well-vascularized tumor; the more rapidly a virus lyses infected cells the more effective it will be at controlling the tumor; and the innate immune response to the virus can potentially prevent the virus from controlling the tumor, even with repeat injections. Therefore, in addition to diffuse intratumoral infection, tumor eradication by oncolytic adenovirus will probably require potent suppression of innate immune clearance mechanisms (e.g., by replacement of adenovirus E3 genes), combinations with traditional (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) treatments, and/or concomitant therapeutic gene expression with resultant bystander effects.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-03-22", "authors": ["Lawrence MWein", "Joseph TWu", "David HKirn"], "doi": null}

Flow cytometric analyses of recipient peripheral blood and bone marrow were carried out at 4 to 6 days, 18 to 21 days, 6 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after transplantation.\nThe rats that received tacrolimus therapy achieved prolonged composite graft acceptance more than 12 months, whereas GFP skin grafts were rejected at 47 days under the same immunosuppressive protocol. Numerous GFP lymphocytes and granulocytes were detected within the recipient bone marrow for the first 6 weeks post limb transplantation. These cells remained relatively stable for more than 12 months.\nThe results showed that donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells engrafted in recipient bone marrow and differentiated to lymphocytes and granulocytes after limb transplantation. The vascularized bone marrow, transplanted as a part of the hind limb, could have contributed to mixed chimerism and worked as the bone-marrow source in the recipients.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2003-03-18", "authors": ["TakashiAjiki", "MasafumiTakahashi", "SeiichiroInoue", "YasunaruSakuma", "ShigetakaOyama", "TakashiKaneko", "YojiHakamata", "TakashiMurakami", "AkihiroKume", "YuseiKariya", "YuichiHoshino", "EijiKobayashi"], "doi": "10.1097/01.TP.0000054617.54222.02"}

Control sections of the bowel were also monitored by PPG.\nCardiac output dropped for each level of PEEP and returned to basal levels on volume restabilization and on removal of PEEP. Central venous pressure and pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures increased for each level of PEEP and only returned to basal levels on removal of PEEP. PsO(2) values dropped for each level of PEEP and returned to basal levels on volume restabilization and on removal of PEEP. PsCO(2) levels rose, and PPG wave amplitude dropped, for each level of PEEP; these two variables only returned to basal levels on removal of PEEP. PPG values for the control sections reflected those of the anastomotic area.\nPEEP affects surface oxygen values at the level of the gastroplasty by means of its effect on cardiac output.

{"title": "Placentation in garter snakes. II. Transmission EM of the chorioallantoic placenta of Thamnophis radix and T. sirtalis.", "abstract": "Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the ultrastructure of the allantoplacenta of garter snakes during the last half of gestation. This placenta occupies the dorsal hemisphere of the egg and is formed through apposition of the chorioallantois to the inner lining of the uterus. The uterine epithelium consists of flattened cells with short, irregular microvilli and others that bear cilia. The lamina propria is vascularized and its capillaries lie at the base of the uterine epithelial cells. The chorionic epithelium consists of a bilayer of squamous cells that are particularly thin superficial to the allantoic capillaries. Neither the chorionic epithelium nor the uterine epithelium undergoes erosion during development. Although a thin remnant of the shell membrane intervenes between fetal and maternal tissue at mid-gestation, it undergoes fragmentation by the end of gestation. Thus, uterine and chorionic epithelial are directly apposed in some regions of the allantoplacenta, forming continuous cellular boundaries at the placental interface. During development, capillaries proliferate in both the uterine and chorioallantoic tissues. By late gestation, the interhemal diffusion distance has thinned in some areas to less than 2 microm through attenuation of the uterine and chorionic epithelia. Morphologically, the allantoplacenta is well adapted for its function in gas exchange. However, the presence of cytoplasmic vesicles, ribosomal ER, and mitochondria in the chorionic and uterine epithelial cells are consistent with the possibility of additional forms of placental exchange.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2003-03-14", "authors": ["Daniel GBlackburn", "Rachel LLorenz"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10083"}

The mass connecting to the ventricle wall mimicked a hemorrhagic tumor and the other part mimicked a cystic mass. Cerebral angiography demonstrated arteriovenous shunt in the right lateral ventricle wall. The operative findings revealed that the part arising from the ventricle wall contained hematoma showing various stages of coagulation and that the cystic mass visible on MRI was a granulomatous solid mass. Histologic examination revealed that the capsules of both were compatible with chronic encapsulated intracerebral hematomas.\nIn the present case, one part of the mass contained only granulomatous tissue, indicating the possibility that the mass was undergoing spontaneous resolution.

Use of vascularized autologous tissue may decrease the incidence of reherniation as tissue incorporation and growth may be improved. The authors report our early experience using a local muscle advancement flap with microneural anastomosis for those children in whom reherniation develops after prosthetic patch placement.\nSeven patients with CDH (6 left and 1 right) whose synthetic diaphragmatic patch separated from the chest wall resulting in a clinically significant recurrent hernia were followed up with prospectively. After dissecting the ipsilateral latissimus dorsi off the chest wall and dividing the thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle (based on its lumbar blood supply), the synthetic patch was removed via an eighth intercostal incision. The muscle flap was placed into the hemithorax through the bed of the tenth rib and sutured in place over a Vicryl mesh scaffold. The thoracodorsal nerve was anastomosed to the phrenic nerve. Functional analysis of the flap was performed in 4 patients.\nAge at placement of the muscle graft ranged from 2 months to 48 months (median, 24 months). There has been no evidence of reherniation after placement of the muscle graft. Long-term outcome and functional analysis of the flap was available in 4 patients (mean, 19 months). Two infants had fluoroscopic and sonographic evidence of nonparadoxical neodiaphragmatic motion. In one of these, electromyographic evidence of function was documented with a phrenic nerve conduction velocity of 22 meters per second. The third infant showed no evidence of neodiaphragmatic motion, and the fourth infant had paradoxical motion.\nThis is the first direct documentation of phrenic nerve function in an infant with CDH.

Plasminogen-related protein B, which antagonizes various endothelial cell activities, also elicited a significant inhibition of neoplastic growth, albeit with reduced effectiveness. The combination of the two agents resulted in only a modest further repression of tumor growth over that associated with ET-743 treatment alone, as measured by tumor volume (82% versus 76% inhibition, respectively). However, analysis of the extent of tumor necrosis and vascularization of the tumor revealed that the coadministration of the two compounds was clearly more effective, eliciting a 2.5-fold increase in tumor necrosis relative to single-agent treatment. The combination therapy also was most effective at antagonizing tumor-associated microvessel formation, as assessed by CD31 immunostaining, suggesting that combination therapy may hold promise for treating CHSA.

The growth and differentiation of cultured ECs were enhanced in response to exposure to BMSC conditioned medium (CM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays demonstrated that both mouse and human BMSCs secreted significant quantities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (2.4-3.1 ng/10(6) cells per day). Furthermore, eliminating the activity of BMSC-secreted VEGF with blocking antibodies completely blocked the CM effects on cultured ECs.

Tissue grew spontaneously in association with an intense angiogenic sprouting from the loop and almost filled the chamber, resulting in a mean amount of tissue in chambers of 0.23 g with no added matrix scaffold and 0.33 g of tissue in PLGA-filled chambers after 4 weeks of incubation. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a greater volume of tissue could be generated when the same-size vessel loop was inserted into a larger (1.9 ml) chamber. In four groups of five rats, an arteriovenous shunt sandwiched between two disks of PLGA, used as a scaffold for structural support, was placed inside a large polycarbonate growth chamber. Tissue and PLGA weight and volume, as well as histological characteristics of the newly formed tissue, were assessed at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Tissue weight and volume showed a strong linear correlation. Tissue weight increased progressively from 0.13 +/- 0.04 g at 2 weeks to 0.57 +/- 0.06 g at 6 weeks (p < 0.0005). PLGA weight decreased progressively from 0.89 +/- 0.07 g at 2 weeks to 0.20 +/- 0.09 g at 8 weeks (p < 0.0005).

The advantages of this flap are as follows: (1) the operative field is the same; (2) the radial artery is preserved; (3) it is thin, pliable, and hairless and thus can supply a gliding surface for tendons beneath it; (4) when it involves a palmaris longus tendon and/or the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, it can be used as a vascularized tendon or nerve graft; and (5) in view of the flow-through type of the pedicle of the flap, the digital artery can be reconstructed simultaneously.

However, transplanted bone segments for mandibular reconstruction may be too short for a correct interarch alignment, which is a prerequisite for further functional rehabilitation. Extraoral distraction osteogenesis was performed in the neomandible of five patients after tumor resection following neoadjuvant radiotherapy-chemotherapy. The neomandible was distracted bilaterally in two patients and unilaterally in three patients. Gradual distraction was applied at a rate of 0.5 mm twice a day after osteotomy in the region of vascularized fibular and scapular reconstruction. An average sagittal bone gain of 11 mm was achieved following active distraction. In three patients, the distraction procedure rendered good results with full compensation of the deficit; in one patient, the sagittal bone gain did not compensate for a lateral deviation of the mandible; and in another patient, the fixation pins loosened and had to be reaffixed. Osteodistraction is a treatment option in patients in whom vascularized bone grafts have been used for mandibular reconstruction, but due to contractures or lack of hard and soft tissues, no satisfactory interarch alignment could be achieved. Distraction procedures in irradiated and reconstructed neomandibles bear a higher risk of failure and complications than those in nonirradiated tissues. A correct and stable intermaxillary relation always has to be attempted in the first surgical approach, as osteodistraction cannot be suggested as a routine procedure in this special group of patients.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2003-03-06", "authors": ["PeterKessler", "StefanSchultze-Mosgau", "Friedrich WilhelmNeukam", "J\u00f6rgWiltfang"], "doi": "10.1097/01.PRS.0000049115.87004.92"}

Peaks corresponding to the predicted masses of all five pentapeptides were detected in Aplysia neurons by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Northern analysis revealed that expression of the precursor is abundant in the abdominal ganglion, much less in the pedal and cerebral ganglia, and rarely seen in the buccal and pleural ganglia. PRQFVa-positive neurons, mapped by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, were present in all the central ganglia. PRQFVa immunopositive processes were observed in the gut, particularly in association with the vasculature. Some arteries and other highly vascularized tissues, such as the gill and the kidney, also contain numerous PRQFVa immunopositive processes. Application of synthetic PRQFVa suppresses not only contractions of the gut but also contractions of vasculature. PRQFVa is expressed in some of the neurons within the feeding circuitry and application of synthetic PRQFVa was found to decrease the excitability of some (B4/5 and B31/32) but not all (B8) neurons of the buccal feeding circuit.

Moreover it could detect the decrease of the caliber of the intracranial arteries and the disappearance of hemangiomatous malformations even though the patient had not received any treatment for the cutaneous hemangioma. We think that this syndrome, which still has no definite name, has a parallel spontaneous biological process with progressing vascular size during the first months or years of life and, later, the vessels regress slowly but progressively, leading to a small caliber or even the occlusion of the vessels of the cutaneous hemangioma and of the abnormal extracranial and intracranial arteries.

Ligation of CD53 triggers a survival response and reduces the number of cells that enter apoptosis. In CD53- stimulated cells there is a significant reduction in caspase activation, measured by caspase processing of poly ADP-ribose polymerase, as well as a reduction in the fragmentation of DNA. CD53- stimulated cells also have an increase in the level of bcl-X(L) and a reduction of bax protein, two components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, changing their ratio by 24-fold in the direction of survival.

Multiparous ewes were fed to 50% (nutrient restricted) or 100% (control fed) of total digestible nutrients from Days 28 to 78 of gestation. All ewes were weighed weekly and diets adjusted for individual weight loss or gain. Ewes were killed on Day 78 of gestation and gravid uteri recovered. Fetal body and organ weights were determined, and numbers, morphologies, diameters, and weights of all placentomes were obtained. From Day 28 to Day 78, restricted ewes lost 7.4% of body weight, while control ewes gained 7.5%. Maternal and fetal blood glucose concentrations were reduced in restricted versus control pregnancies. Fetuses were markedly smaller in the restricted group than in the control group. Further, restricted fetuses exhibited greater right- and left-ventricular and liver weights per unit fetal weight than control fetuses.

{"title": "Assessment of placental fractional moving blood volume using quantitative three-dimensional power doppler ultrasound.", "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the placental fractional moving blood volume is different with advancing gestational age (GA), we assessed the vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization-flow index (VFI) of the placenta in normal pregnancy by using three-dimensional (3-D) power Doppler ultrasound (US). We enrolled 100 healthy pregnant women with gestational age between 20 to 40 weeks for this study. Three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography was used to assess the VI, FI and VFI in each case. Our results showed that the linear regression equations for VI, FI and VFI, by using GA as the independent variable, were VI = 0.27107 x GA -4.02748 (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001), FI = 0.56115 x GA + 34.28945 (r = 0.49, p < 0.001), and VFI = 0.15663 x GA -2.53810 (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001), respectively. In addition, the VI, FI and VFI values of the placental flow were also positively correlated with the fetal growth indices, namely, biparietal diameter, occipitofrontal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and estimated fetal weight (all p values < 0.001). In conclusion, our study illustrates that the fractional moving blood volume of the placenta is positively correlated with the increment of gestational age and the fetal growth indices.

{"title": "Isolated preparations of ocular vasculature and their applications in ophthalmic research.", "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to outline the techniques and applications for isolated ocular vascular preparations and their significance to ophthalmic research. Various isolated ocular vascular preparations have been utilized in studies of ocular vascular biology, physiology and pharmacology, including work in both normal and diseased conditions. However, there is still significant potential for further studies to improve our understanding of the ocular circulation and its regulation. Experience has shown that there is no single preparation capable of addressing all of the questions that must be answered if a complete understanding of mechanisms of vascular regulation in the eye is to be achieved. Rather, it is necessary to select the appropriate preparation and techniques to address each individual question in the most appropriate manner. In this review, particular emphasis is placed on the applications for isolated ocular preparations and the relevance of such studies to our understanding of the pathogenesis of eye diseases involving the vasculature. Examples are given where therapeutic approaches in diabetes and glaucoma are assessed in terms of their impact on the vasoactive properties of the ocular vasculature.A significant heterogeneity is present in the different parts of the ocular vasculature, not only in the structural and functional properties of vessel itself, but also in terms of the tissue environment and innervation. A single vasoactive agent may also have different effects when applied to the inside or the outside of the same region of a vessel. The vasoactive response of the vascular system as a whole is what determines the rate of blood flow through the system, but this is regulated by a multitude of factors in different regions of the vascular network. Isolating individual components of the ocular vasculature is readily achievable for the extraocular vessels such as the ophthalmic or ophthalmocilliary arteries, which can be studied in myograph type systems measuring the mechanical vasoactive force generated by the vessel. Retinal vessels from very large animals can also be studied in this way, but the small diameter of the retinal vessels in most species requires a perfusion rather than myograph based technique. Perfusion based studies of vessel diameter in response to vasoactive stimuli can be applied to individual retinal arteries and their branches. Perfusion of more complex elements of the ocular vasculature such as isolated segments of the retina or ciliary body, or whole isolated perfused eyes may use the perfusate pressure as the determinant of vasoactive state. However, when several components of the ocular vasculature are being perfused simultaneously it may be difficult to separate out the contribution from the different vascular elements. The advantage of isolated preparations is that systemic influences can be eliminated, and vascular components can be studied that are inaccessible in vivo. The disadvantage is that no matter how well controlled the in vitro environment may be, it will always be a relatively poor mimic of the in vivo conditions. However, such in vitro work has certainly improved our understanding of the vasoactive properties of different regions of the ocular vasculature in both health and disease.", "journal": "Progress in retinal and eye research", "date": "2003-02-27", "authors": ["Dao-YiYu", "Er-NingSu", "Stephen JCringle", "Paula KYu"], "doi": "10.1016/s1350-9462(02)00044-7"}

{"title": "IL-1 is required for tumor invasiveness and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Here, we describe that microenvironmental IL-1 beta and, to a lesser extent, IL-1 alpha are required for in vivo angiogenesis and invasiveness of different tumor cells. In IL-1 beta knockout (KO) mice, local tumor or lung metastases of B16 melanoma cells were not observed compared with WT mice. Angiogenesis was assessed by the recruitment of blood vessel networks into Matrigel plugs containing B16 melanoma cells; vascularization of the plugs was present in WT mice, but was absent in IL-1 beta KO mice. The addition of exogenous IL-1 into B16-containing Matrigel plugs in IL-1 beta KO mice partially restored the angiogenic response. Moreover, the incorporation of IL-1 receptor antagonist to B16-containing plugs in WT mice inhibited the ingrowth of blood vessel networks into Matrigel plugs. In IL-1 alpha KO mice, local tumor development and induction of an angiogenic response in Matrigel plugs was less pronounced than in WT mice, but significantly higher than in IL-1 beta KO mice. These effects of host-derived IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were not restricted to the melanoma model, but were also observed in DA/3 mammary and prostate cancer cell models. In addition to the in vivo findings, IL-1 contributed to the production of vascular endothelial cell growth factor and tumor necrosis factor in cocultures of peritoneal macrophages and tumor cells. Host-derived IL-1 seems to control tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness. Furthermore, the anti-angiogenic effects of IL-1 receptor antagonist, shown here, suggest a possible therapeutic role in cancer, in addition to its current use in rheumatoid arthritis.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2003-02-25", "authors": ["ElenaVoronov", "Dror SShouval", "YakovKrelin", "EmanuelaCagnano", "DanielBenharroch", "YoichiroIwakura", "Charles ADinarello", "Ron NApte"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0437939100"}

{"title": "Systemic administration of a recombinant adenovirus encoding a HSA-Angiostatin kringle 1-3 conjugate inhibits MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and metastasis in a transgenic model of spontaneous eye cancer.", "abstract": "We previously reported that intratumoral injection of AdK3, a recombinant adenovirus encoding human angiostatin kringle (K) 1 to 3, inhibits tumor vascularization and tumor growth. To reduce the serum clearance of this factor, we constructed an adenovirus (AdK3-HSA) that carries a chimeric gene encoding a fusion protein between angiostatin K1-3 and human serum albumin (HSA). This conjugate inhibited endothelial cell proliferation as efficiently as K1-3. K3-HSA serum concentrations in immunodeficient mice systemically injected with AdK3-HSA were dramatically higher than in AdK3-injected mice. Furthermore, the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors grafted into nude mice that had been injected intravenously with AdK3-HSA was inhibited by 79% (versus 17% with AdK3). In TRP-1/SV40 Tag transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop eye tumors with brain metastases, intravenous injections of AdK3-HSA in newborn mice blocked metastatic dissemination efficiently and significantly, and prolonged survival by 3 weeks. After 2 months, only 46% of AdK3-HSA-treated animals developed micrometastases, whereas 94% of the AdCO1-injected group displayed numerous macrometastases. Nevertheless, ocular tumor growth was not modified because of impaired diffusion of the conjugate in the eye compartment. Our results show that HSA genetic coupling is an efficient way to increase the pharmacokinetics of circulating angiogenic inhibitors and thus their antitumoral activity.", "journal": "Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy", "date": "2003-02-25", "authors": ["CBouquet", "EFrau", "POpolon", "EConnault", "MAbitbol", "FGriscelli", "PYeh", "MPerricaudet"], "doi": "10.1016/s1525-0016(02)00057-6"}

{"title": "Mucinous colon carcinomas with microsatellite instability have a lower microvessel density and lower vascular endothelial growth factor expression.", "abstract": "We determined the association between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, microvessel density (MVD) and microsatellite instability (MSI) or the histological type in colon adenocarcinomas. Sixty-six cases were studied, 28 MSI+ and 38 MSI-. MSI phenotype was determined using polymerase chain reaction. MVD was assessed after CD31 staining in ten x400 fields (0.96 mm(2)) in the most vascularized areas. VEGF and COX-2 expression were studied by means of immunohistochemistry. MVD positively correlated with the levels of VEGF expression (P=10(-4)) and also with the levels of COX-2 expression (P=0.007). MVD and VEGF expression were lower in MSI+ carcinomas (P=0.002 and P=0.03 respectively). When mucinous tumors were excluded from the statistical analysis, the association between low MVD, low VEGF and MSI status disappeared (P=0.5, P=1, respectively). MSI+ mucinous carcinomas had a lower MVD and VEGF expression than other MSI+ carcinomas (P=0.008 and P=0.004, respectively) and MSI- mucinous carcinomas (P=0.01 and P=0.001, respectively). COX-2 expression was lower in medullary carcinomas (P=0.001). In conclusion, mucinous MSI+ colon carcinomas represent a special group of colon adenocarcinomas relating to angiogenesis, with a lower MVD and VEGF expression than both MSI- mucinous carcinomas and MSI+ non-mucinous carcinomas. A low COX-2 expression could be related to the medullary phenotype. However, this has to be confirmed in a larger series.

The diagnosis of FAS is traditionally made on liver-spleen scintigraphy and finding Howell-Jolly bodies within erythrocytes. In this retrospective study, our goal was to identify any characteristic sonographic findings of the spleen in patients with FAS in an attempt to determine whether the diagnosis of FAS can be made sonographically.\nIn a review of all medical and sonographic records from the period of January 1, 1985, through December 31, 2001, we identified 24 patients (11 men, 13 women) in whom FAS had been diagnosed by liver-spleen scintigraphy (n = 13) or the finding of Howell-Jolly bodies (n = 11). The following sonographic parameters were determined: size of spleen (small, normal, or large), echotexture of the spleen (homogeneous versus inhomogeneous), echogenicity (isoechoic versus hyperechoic), presence of focal splenic lesions, and patterns of splenic vascularization as determined by color Doppler sonography (absent flow, hilar flow, or parenchymal flow).\nThe spleen was small in 20 patients (83%) and normal in the other 4 (17%). Echotexture was homogeneous in 13 patients (54%) and inhomogeneous in 11 (46%). The spleen was isoechoic in 18 cases (75%) and hyperechoic in 6 (25%). Six patients (25%) had focal lesions. Color Doppler sonography showed absent flow in 4 patients (17%), hilar flow in 17 (71%), and hilar and parenchymal vascularization in 3 (12%).\nSonographic findings in the spleen of patients with FAS are characterized predominantly by a small spleen with absence of parenchymal vascularization on color Doppler sonography in most cases.

{"title": "New insights into saccular development and vascular formation in lung allografts under the renal capsule.", "abstract": "The study of distal lung morphogenesis and vascular development would be greatly facilitated by an in vitro or ex vivo experimental model. In this study we show that the growth of mouse embryonic day 12.5 lung rudiments implanted underneath the kidney capsules of syngeneic or immunodeficient hosts follows closely lung development in utero. The epithelium develops extensively with both proximal and distal differentiation to the saccular stage. The vasculature also develops extensively. Large blood vessels accompany large airways and capillaries develop within the saccular walls. Interestingly, vessels in the lung grafts develop from endothelial progenitor cells endogenous to the explants and host vessels do not vascularize the grafts independently. This suggests that embryonic lungs possess mechanisms to prevent the inappropriate ingrowth of surrounding vessels. However, vessels in the lung grafts do connect to host vessels, showing that embryonic lungs have the ability to stimulate host angiogenesis and recruit host vessel connections. These data support the hypothesis that the lung vasculature develops by both vasculogenic and angiogenic processes: a vascular network develops in situ in lung mesenchyme, which is then connected to angiogenic processes from central vessels. The lung renal capsule allograft is thus an excellent model to study the development of the pulmonary vasculature and of late fetal lung development that requires a functional blood supply.", "journal": "Mechanisms of development", "date": "2003-02-20", "authors": ["Thiennu HVu", "YemisrachAlemayehu", "ZenaWerb"], "doi": "10.1016/s0925-4773(02)00451-3"}

Injection of immature bone marrow-derived DC, however, was shown to prime in vivo alloreactive CD4 T lymphocytes toward type 2 cytokine-producing cells in the absence of CD8 T-cell activation.\nWe undertook the present study to determine whether Th2-immunization by immature DC could lead to allograft rejection. We first analyzed, in the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen-disparate B6-anti-bm12 combination, the capacity of immature DC to regulate the activity of alloreactive CD4 T cells. We then determined, in this model of weak antigenicity, whether injection of bm12 DC in B6 recipients before transplantation could modify the survival of vascularized bm12 cardiac allografts.\nWe confirmed that in vitro immature DC are poor stimulators of T-cell alloresponse. However, when given in vivo, immature bm12 DC primed anti-bm12 T cells for the production of interleukin (IL)-4. Moreover, they induced the acute rejection of bm12 cardiac allograft. The process of rejection was dependent on IL-4 because immunization of IL-4-deficient mice did not trigger rejection.\nAllogeneic immature DC generated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor are potent stimulators of primary alloreactive response in vivo and prime for transplant rejection.

Because of the short half life of these agents, repeated administration of proteins is required to achieve significant graft survival. Furthermore, there is limited information regarding the effect of cosimulatory blockade on the survival of composite tissue allografts. Therefore, we examined the effect of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of CTLA4Ig or CD40Ig gene or both in composite tissue allotransplantation.\nThe hind limbs removed from male ACI rats (RT1 ) were transplanted into female Lewis rats (RT1 ) heterotopically. The recombinant adenovirus carrying CTLA4Ig (AxCTLA4Ig) or CD40Ig (AxCD40Ig) was intravenously administered after limb transplantation.\nLimb allograft survival was significantly prolonged by either AxCTLA4Ig or AxCD40Ig treatment at 1 x 10 plaque forming unit (mean survival time [MST] of 39.4+/-6.0 and 13.0+/-2.9, respectively) compared with the adenovirus vector containing beta-galactosidase-treated group (MST of 4.8+/-0.8). Combination of AxCTLA4Ig and AxCD40Ig led to significant prolongation of graft survival (MST of 49.2+/-6.6).

Here we evaluated whether an endothelium-expressed receptor tyrosine phosphatase, CD148 (DEP-1/PTPeta), participates in developmental vascularization.

Homozygous mutant mice died at midgestation, before embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), with vascularization failure marked by growth retardation and disorganized vascular structures.

Homozygous mutant mice displayed enlarged vessels comprised of endothelial cells expressing markers of early differentiation, including VEGFR2 (Flk1), Tal1/SCL, CD31, ephrin-B2, and Tie2, with notable lack of endoglin expression. Increased endothelial cell numbers and mitotic activity indices were demonstrated.

{"title": "Vascularization of the developing chick limb bud: role of the TGFbeta signalling pathway.", "abstract": "The developing vertebrate limb has fascinated developmental biologists and theoreticians for decades as a model system for investigating cell fate, cell signalling and tissue interactions. We are beginning to understand the mechanisms and signalling pathways that control and regulate the outgrowth and formation of the limb bud into a differentiated identifiable limb by late embryogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of the vasculature of the developing limb are far from being completely understood. The vasculature supplies oxygen, nutrients and signals to developing tissues, allowing them to develop and grow. Moreover, a lot of evidence recently points to molecules involved in morphological development also controlling vascular development. Thus understanding how the vasculature forms and is patterned in the developing limb may further our understanding of limb development. In this review I outline how blood vessels are formed and maintained and how the developing chick limb is vascularized. I also review the role of the TGFbeta superfamily signalling pathway in the development of the chick limb vasculature: in particular, how antagonizing TGFbeta signalling in the developing chick limb has shed new light on the role vascular smooth muscle cells play in vessel calibre control and how this work has added to our understanding of TGFbeta superfamily signal transduction.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2003-02-18", "authors": ["NeilVargesson"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00133.x"}
{"title": "A new role for corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-2: suppression of vascularization.", "abstract": "The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of receptors and ligands are known to have potent effects on vasculature function. Our recent data has described a novel role of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-2 (CRFR2) as a tonic inhibitor of neovascularization. CRFR2 is found in both endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the vasculature, where its function has been elusive. From investigation into the role of CRFR2 as a determinant of tissue vascularization, it was discovered that mice deficient for CRFR2 become hypervascularized postnatally and express increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Mechanistically, CRFR2 activation in vitro was found to result in reduced VEGF release from SMCs, an inhibition of SMC proliferation, and an inhibition of capillary tube formation in collagen gels. Treatment of a subcutaneously injected gel matrix with a CRFR2 agonist inhibited growth factor-induced vascularization in vivo. Western blots for the cell-cycle retinoblastoma protein (Rb)--essential for cell-cycle progression, showed decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb following CRFR2 agonist treatment in SMCs--supporting a role for CRFR2 in regulation of SMC proliferation. These results suggest that CRFR2 is a critical component of a novel pathway necessary for tonic inhibition of adult neovascularization, and that CRFR2 may be a potential target for therapeutic modulation of angiogenesis.", "journal": "Trends in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2003-02-15", "authors": ["Tracy LBale", "Frank JGiordano", "Wylie WVale"], "doi": "10.1016/s1050-1738(02)00214-1"}

Transgenic mice that overexpress PDGF-B in the photoreceptors (rho/PDGF-B mice) develop traction retinal detachment. In the present study, a detailed histopathological analysis was performed in rho/PDGF-B mice. In these transgenic mice, endothelial cells, pericytes, and glial cells begin to proliferate at postnatal day 7 (P7). All three cell types increase in numbers, forming a highly vascularized cell mass, which reaches a maximum thickness at P14. Cords of endothelial cells and glia invade the retina and exert traction, generating retinal folds; however, the deep capillary bed never forms. Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (GSA)-positive endothelial cells form tubes and penetrate the retina to the level of the outer plexiform layer, but they never interconnect to form the deep capillary bed. The vessels within the cell mass are patent, but have a very immature morphology. They often are thin-walled with fenestrations. Pericytes and glial cells are usually found in clusters and are not associated with the abnormal vessels. The lack of this association may account for the failure to form a mature vasculature.", "journal": "Brain research.

Molecular techniques for HPV screening and genotyping using the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism were employed on the cytologic specimens.\nThe thin-layer preparations were of moderate to high cellularity. There were loose aggregates of or isolated small round cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, thin but irregular nuclear membrane, hyperchromatic nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli and scanty cytoplasm. Tumor cell cannibalism was commonly found. Small groups of tumor cells with nuclear molding were noted. There was also obvious tumor diathesis in the background. The necrotic debris was admixed with isolated small round cells, apoptotic bodies and nuclear dust. Associated koilocytosis or squamous intraepithelial lesions were not seen. Histologic examination of the tumor biopsies showed classic features of small cell carcinoma associated with squashing artifacts and vascularized stroma. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of HPV DNA (either type 18 or 16) in all the three liquid-based cytology samples.\nWhile the cytomorphologic features of small cell carcinoma of the cervix or vagina in thin-layer preparations are slightly different from those in conventional smears, due mainly to the absence of smearing effect, recognition of the subtle but characteristic appearance can enhance the accuracy of the cytologic diagnosis.

The effects of TSP-1 on adenoma formation and development into cancerous lesions has been evaluated in the Min(/+) (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mouse model. These mice develop multiple adenomas in the small intestine due to a mutation in the homologous APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene. As in its human counterpart, these adenomas may progress to carcinomas. Intestines of APC(Min/+) mice were dissected and histologic evaluation of adenomas was then conducted. Significant increases in vascularization and proliferation were observed in adenomatous, as compared with normal, mucosa. TSP-1 immunostaining revealed significant decreases in the number and intensity of positive cells in adenomas, as compared with normal mucosa. TSP-1 scores were inversely correlated with vascularity and proliferation rate. Cross breeding of mice homozygous for a deletion of the TSP-1 gene (TSP-1(-/-)) with mice heterozygous for the APC gene mutation (APC(Min/+)), resulted in animals that showed a significant increase in adenoma number and diameter. Also, histopathological examination of these adenomas showed accelerated dysplasic changes, carcinoma in situ and early invasion, compared with their APC(Min/+) littermates. Moreover, a significant decrease of TUNEL-positive cells was observed in intestinal adenomas of TSP-1(-/-)/APC(Min/+) mice.

{"title": "Platelet-endothelial interaction in tumor angiogenesis and microcirculation.", "abstract": "Activated platelets release angiogenic growth factors and have therefore been proposed to contribute to tumor angiogenesis within a potentially prothrombotic tumor microcirculation. The aim of the study was to investigate interactions of platelets with the angiogenic microvascular endothelium of highly vascularized solid tumors during growth and in response to endothelial stimulation in comparison with normal subcutaneous tissue. Experiments were performed in the dorsal skinfold chamber preparation of C57BL/6J mice bearing the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC-1) or methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma (BFS-1). Fluorescently labeled rolling and adherent platelets, red blood cell velocity, and vessel diameters were assessed by intravital fluorescence microscopy on days 1, 3, 8, and 14 after tumor cell implantation. Slightly elevated numbers of rolling platelets were observed in the early stages of tumor angiogenesis at day 1 (control, 1.7 +/- 0.6; LLC-1, 3.4 +/- 1.8; BFS-1, 3.0 +/- 0.7 [1/mm/s], P <.05) and day 3 (control, 1.6 +/- 0.6; LLC-1, 4.1 +/- 1.7, P <.05; BFS-1, 2.3 +/- 0.5 [1/mm/s]) after tumor cell implantation. Endothelial stimulation with calcium ionophore A23187 at day 14 after tumor cell implantation resulted in a minor increase to 2.1 +/- 0.4 (LLC-1) and 1.8 +/- 0.8 (BFS-1) rolling platelets (1/mm/s) in tumor microvessels compared with 4.9 +/- 0.9 in controls (P <.05). Platelet adherence was not observed.

A low molecular weight acidic molecule like trypan blue and various high molecular weight molecules such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), heparin and protamine were all retained within the hydrogel, while a low molecular weight basic molecule like toluidine blue was rapidly released from the hydrogel. In the present work, we examined the retaining capability of the chitosan hydrogel for growth factors and controlled release of growth factors from the chitosan hydrogel in vitro and in vivo. Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor(165) (VEGF(165)), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were mixed with Az-CH-LA aqueous solution to form growth factor-incorporated chitosan hydrogels. About 10-25% of the growth factor was released from a growth factor-incorporated chitosan hydrogel into PBS within the first day, after which no further substantial release took place. The growth factors interacted with Az-CH-LA molecules poly-ion complexation, and probably were unable to be released after the first day under the in vitro nondegradation conditions of the hydrogel. Although the FGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF(165)-incorporated chitosan hydrogels on a culture plate significantly stimulated HUVEC growth, the stimulating activity of the growth factor-incorporated chitosan hydrogel was completely cancelled out by washing the hydrogel with PBS solution for 3 days or more. The stimulating activity on the HUVEC growth were however highly recovered by treating the washed growth factor-incorporated chitosan hydrogel during 7 days with chitinase and chitosanase to partly degrade the hydrogel, strongly suggesting that the growth factors within the hydrogel retained their biologically active forms. The chitosan hydrogel (100 microl) when implanted into the back of a mouse was biodegraded in about 10-14 days. When FGF-1- and FGF-2-incorporated chitosan hydrogels were subcutaneously implanted into the back of a mouse, significant neovascularization was induced near the implanted site of the FGF-1- and FGF-2-incorporated chitosan hydrogels. Furthermore, addition of heparin with either FGF-1 or FGF-2 into the hydrogel resulted in a significantly enhanced and prolonged vascularization effect. These results indicate that the controlled release of biologically active FGF-1 and FGF-2 with heparin is caused by biodegradation of the chitosan hydrogel, and subsequent induction of vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Distribution patterns of the membrane glycoprotein CD44 during the foreign-body reaction to a degradable biomaterial in rats and mice.", "abstract": "Although biomaterials have been used in the clinical setting for a long time, little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying the foreign-body reaction (FBR). A good understanding of these mechanisms is requisite for the controlled regulation of the FBR needed to prevent adverse tissue reactions and thus to improve the function of the biomaterial. Macrophages are essential in the inflammatory reaction in, as well as around, the implants, and they also are believed to initiate most of the adverse responses. Typically, during the FBR macrophages become activated and fuse into multinucleated giant cells (MnGCs). CD44, an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed on a broad spectrum of cell types, is involved in MnGC formation in vitro and in inflammation processes in general. In vivo it is not known whether CD44 is part of a specific protein machinery that enables macrophage fusion or whether it has additional functions in the FBR. In the present in vivo study, CD44 expression patterns were followed in rats and mice during the FBR to a degradable collagen type I biomaterial. We found that CD44 is upregulated on all migrating cells and on newly formed blood vessels at the onset of the FBR and that MnGCs, up to week 15 postimplantation, expressed CD44. Although no evidence was found that CD44 participates in macrophage fusion leading to multinucleation, it nevertheless may be an interesting target molecule for modulating the FBR in vivo, possibly by affecting cell activation, cell migration towards the biomaterial, vascularization, and MnGC formation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Its blood vessel course and development were schematically presented. In 65 patients in whom the prepuce was not used for urethroplasty or penile body skin reconstruction the specimen was removed and its blood vessels were identified after injection with gelatin and Indian ink. The results of the 2 methods were compared.\nBased on the predominant blood vessels we classified preputial vascularization in hypospadias cases into groups, including 1-1 blood vessel predominant in 43%, 2-2 blood vessels predominant in 12%, 3-an H-like form with communication between 2 well developed blood vessels in 14% and 4-a net-like form with no predominant blood vessels in 29%. After comparing the results of the illumination technique versus specimen study in the same preputial tissue the illumination method was confirmed to be precise and easy to perform.\nVascularization of the prepuce is crucial for hypospadias repair.

LipofectAMINE/pDNA and Superfect/pDNA complexes showed high transfection efficiency in rapidly dividing Jurkat cells, but low transfection in non-dividing human islets.

To exclude endogenously secreted hVEGF, real time RT-PCR experiment was repeated using pCAGGS vector-specific forward primer and hVEGF gene-specific reverse primer. In this case, both non-transfected islets and the islets transfected with LipofectAMINE/pCMS-EGFP complexes showed negligible amplification of hVEGF. On glucose challenge, insulin release from LipofectAMINE/pCAGGS-hVEGF transfected human islets increased from 10.78 +/- 4.56 to 65 +/- 5 ng/ml, suggesting little adverse effect on islet beta cell response to glucose challenge. The low transfection efficiency is due to the islets being a cluster of approximately 1000 non-dividing cells.

The incidence of the former is said to be high, ranging from 36 to 70%. It has been found that vascular distribution of the endometrium in adenomyosis is diversely different from fertile patients without adenomyosis. For example, hysteroscopy revealed that approximately half of the patients have abnormal vascularization. In these patients, vascular distribution was generally irregular, and vessels were thick, dilated, and/or reticular in some patients. Moreover, morphometric analysis of the endometrium revealed that in the fertile women, the mean surface area, total surface area, and total number of capillaries, all increased significantly in the secretory phase compared to the proliferative phase. In contrast, the above parameters increased in the adenomyosis group in both the proliferative phase and secretory phase compared to the fertile women. In particular, the total surface area of capillaries per mm(2) markedly rose, by 11.6 times, compared to that of the proliferative phase in the fertile women. These findings suggest that regulatory factors involved in the vascular proliferation are diversely exaggerated, and that the abnormal vascularization of the endometrium is closely related with hypermenorrhea.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2003-02-05", "authors": ["HirotakaOta", "ToshinobuTanaka"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.10282"}

The size of the ALT flaps ranged from 10 to 16 cm in length and 6 to 9 cm in width. All flaps included vascularized fascia lata, which was rolled to serve as vascularized tendon graft (range 8 x 6 cm to 10 x 8 cm) for reconstruction of the Achilles tendon defect.

Functional outcome of the recipient ankle and donor thigh morbidity were investigated by using a kinetic dynamometer comparing reconstructed sides with the healthy contralateral limbs. This assessment was performed in two patients at 2 years postoperatively. In the reconstructed ankles, isokinetic concentric measurements of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion showed a deficit of 30% and 40%, respectively. Functional evaluation of quadriceps femoris muscle contraction forces after free ALT composite flap harvest showed a 10% to 25% deficit. However, there were no difficulties in daily ambulating.

The blood vessels run on the inner surface of these nerve fiber bundles (epivascularization) and, accordingly, the accompanying astrocytes lie mostly facing the vitreous body from which they are separated only by the inner limiting membrane of the retina. The arrangement of the astrocytes around blood vessels leads to the formation of structures known as glial tufts. Fragments (N = 3) or whole pieces (N = 3) of the medullated nerve fiber region of three-month-old male rabbits (Orictolagus cuniculus) were fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by osmium tetroxide, and their thin sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope. Randomly located discontinuities (up to a few micrometers long) of the basement membrane of the inner limiting membrane of the retina were observed in the glial tufts.

Seventy-eight mature New Zealand white rabbits were used. The harvested medial meniscus for the allotransplantation was frozen and stored at -80 degrees C for 2 weeks. After resecting the medial meniscus, an allogenic meniscus was transplanted in the anatomical position (group A). The surface of the graft was covered by a vascularized synovial flap (group B), a free synovial flap (group C), or a fibrin clot (group D). The animals were killed 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after transplantation, and the transplants were examined by gross inspection, histology, and microangiography. Connective tissue infiltration into the matrix of the graft was found to begin at 6 weeks (2/5 menisci) and to be complete at 8 weeks (5/5 menisci) in group B, whereas it began at 8 weeks (1/5) in group A.

However, little is known about the fate and movement of cells into or out of autogenous free tissue transfers, including vascularized bone grafts. The purpose of this study was to identify systemic chimerism in vascularized bone grafts by transplantation of a vascularized tibiofibular graft from isogenous (inbred) male Lewis rats to female recipients. Donor (male) cells could be identified in the recipient (female) tissues by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis for a Y chromosome-specific DNA sequence. Chimerism was assessed at 1, 12, 18, and 24 weeks after transplantation. Competitive polymerase chain reaction study using the specific primers for a Y-chromosome marker ( gene) and an autosomal gene (GAPDH) allowed detection of small amounts of male cells in a large pool of female cells and measurement of their relative proportions as a function of time. Of 19 nonimmunosuppressed recipients, nine animals (47 percent) showed low-level chimerism (<0.1 percent) in the peripheral blood. Nine (47 percent), three (16 percent), and two (11 percent) recipients showed high-level chimerism (>1 percent) in the spleen, liver, and thymus, respectively, at final assessment. Donor cells were detected in all bone grafts and in six contralateral tibial bones (i.e., 67 percent of sampled contralateral tibial bones) at 18 and 24 weeks after transplantation. Twenty-four recipients were immunosuppressed with FK506 (tacrolimus) to suppress reaction to a minor histocompatibility barrier present on the Y chromosome. In this group, 14 animals (58 percent) showed low-level chimerism in peripheral blood and 12 (50 percent), eight (33 percent), and one (4 percent) recipients showed high-level chimerism in the spleen, thymus, and liver, respectively. Transplanted cells were detected in nine contralateral tibial bones (i.e., 60 percent of sampled contralateral tibial bones) at 12 and 18 weeks after surgery. The results indicate that polymerase chain reaction for the Y chromosome is a useful tool for differentiating between donor and recipient cell populations experimentally using sex-mismatched tissues in a rat model.

An exact computational methodology is developed yielding an analytic proof. For a class of structurally heterogeneous asymmetric vascular networks, if all the individual vessels share a common distensibility relation when the total network flow is changed, this methodology proves that each vessel will continue to receive the same fraction of the total network flow. This constant flow partitioning occurs despite a redistribution of pressures, which may result in a decrease in the diameter of one and an increase in the diameter of the other of two vessels having a common diameter at a common pressure. This theoretical observation, taken along with published experimental observations on pulmonary vessel distensibilities, suggests that vessel diameter-independent distensibility in the pulmonary vasculature may be an evolutionary adaptation for preserving the spatial distribution of pulmonary blood flow in the face of large variations in cardiac output.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We utilized a genetic approach to demonstrate that loss of Vhl is sufficient not only to stabilize HIF-alpha subunits under normoxia, but also fully activate HIF-mediated responses. These studies have implications for the hierarchy of signaling events leading to HIF stabilization, nuclear translocation, and target gene expression.

Some mouse hosts received anti-CD45RB, anti-CD154, and anti-CD11a (costimulatory blockade). E28 pig metanephroi were < 0.2 mm in diameter and contained only metanephric blastema and segments of ureteric bud. Pig metanephroi transplanted into pigs underwent growth and differentiation of nephrons over a 2 week period without the need for costimulatory blockade of hosts. In contrast, pig metanephroi did not grow or differentiate in mice that received no costimulatory blockade. However, by 2 weeks posttransplantation in mice in which costimulation was blocked, metanephroi from E28 pigs had enlarged, become vascularized, and had formed mature tubules and glomeruli. By 3 weeks posttransplantation in mice, metanephroi had grown to the point that they were approximately half the volume of the native mouse kidney.

The concept of CDI-guided interstitial laser therapy is therefore a further development based on the above mentioned therapeutic regime.\nWe examined 55 patients suffering from vascular lesions of different localization and extent pre-, intra-, and post-operatively using color-Doppler imaging (CDI). All vascular lesions were classified due to their vascularization pattern. As accurate diagnosis was imperative we decided on possible laser treatment depending on the CDI-classification.\nIntra-operative use of CDI rendered possible fiber-guidance by sonographic navigation and therefore precise treatment of aberrant vessels and well-perfused tumor areas.

CDI allowed post-operative proof of diminution of tumor vascularization in all cases.\nCDI-guided interstitial Nd:YAG laser therapy is a minimally-invasive technique which allows replacement of conventional surgical procedures while achieving good cosmetic and functional results.CDI broadens the therapeutic possibilities in contrast to the former therapeutic concept of US-guided laser therapy due to pre-, intra and post-operative utilization of this imaging technique while significantly diminishing the intra-operative risk for the patient.", "journal": "HNO", "date": "2003-01-31", "authors": ["COffergeld", "SSchellong", "IngridHackert", "ASchmidt", "K-BH\u00fcttenbrink"], "doi": "10.1007/s00106-002-0664-2"}

ORF74 activates several cellular signaling pathways in the absence of added ligands, and NIH 3T3 cells expressing ORF74 are tumorigenic in nude mice. We have generated a line of transgenic (Tg) mice with ORF74 driven by the simian virus 40 early promoter. A minority (approximately 30%) of the Tg mice, including the founder, developed tumors resembling Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesions, which occurred most typically on the tail or legs. The tumors were highly vascularized, had a spindle cell component, expressed VEGF-C mRNA, and contained a majority of CD31(+) cells. CD31 and VEGF-C are typically expressed in KS. Tumors generally (but not always) occurred at single sites and most were relatively indolent, although several mice developed large visceral tumors. ORF74 was expressed in a minority of cells in the Tg tumors and in a few other tissues of mice with tumors; mice without tumors did not express detectable ORF74 in any tissues tested. Cell lines established from tumors expressed ORF74 in a majority of cells, expressed VEGF-C mRNA, and were tumorigenic in nude mice. The resultant tumors grew rapidly, metastasized, and continued to express ORF74. Cell lines established from these secondary tumors also expressed ORF74 and were tumorigenic.

For example, multiple rejection episodes of the skin have been noted in clinical hand transplant patients. We have previously demonstrated tolerance to vascularized musculoskeletal allografts in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched miniature swine treated with 12 days of cyclosporine. This regimen did not reproducibly lead to tolerance to subsequent frozen donor skin grafts. However, such skin grafts did not have a primary vascular supply. The aim of this study was to determine if tolerance to limb allografts with a vascularized skin component could be achieved with MHC matching and a 12-day course of immunosuppression.\nHind limb grafts harvested with a 100 cm(2) cutaneous paddle were transplanted heterotopically into six MHC-matched, minor antigen-mismatched miniature swine. All animals received a 12-day course of cyclosporine. One control animal was not immunosuppressed. Grafts were evaluated with biweekly biopsies and tissue viability determined by histologic analysis. To test for sensitization, frozen donor skin grafts were applied to all animals that survived to postoperative day 100.\nAll treated animals (n=6) were tolerant to their musculoskeletal allografts at the time of necropsy (>100 days) regardless of the status of the epidermis. One animal demonstrated tolerance to the skin for more than 180 days. The other five animals demonstrated prolonged survival of the epidermal portion of the graft. The control animal rejected the graft epidermis at 10 days postoperatively. Frozen donor skin grafts demonstrated accelerated rejection (<10 days) in three of the animals and led to simultaneous rejection of both the epidermis of the allograft and the skin graft in the long-term tolerant animal. The rejection of the skin grafts did not break tolerance to the musculoskeletal portion in any of the animals.\nAll animals exhibited indefinite survival of the musculoskeletal portion of their allografts but only prolonged survival of the epidermis. The loss of the graft skin appears to be the result of an isolated immune reaction to the skin, and, in particular, the epidermis.

MR images obtained 9 to 15 weeks after HA insertion in all 14 patients had some degree of central enhancement (Grade III) and 11 had homogeneous enhancement throughout the implant (Grade IV or V). Seven patients in the homogeneous group were believed to have particularly intense enhancement patterns (Grade V).

In addition, many studies point to a role of angiogenesis as a predictor of response to both antiangiogenic and conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. For a conclusive evaluation, however, further studies covering all clinically relevant subgroups of patients are needed. Novel therapeutic approaches with inhibitors of angiogenesis are promising, although the adaptation of most experimentally proven approaches to clinical practice appears to be a laborious process. Furthermore, for an appropriate clinical evaluation of these drugs, newly defined endpoints of treatment and new monitoring systems reflecting their mode of action and the anticipated biological effects are required.\nThe prognostic and predictive value of angiogenic factors and microvessel density has been confirmed.

Our previous in vitro studies in a rat model indicated that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a potent angiogenic agent for fetal lung endothelial cells. To assess its role on human vascular lung development, we first examined the expression of IGF-I/II and IGF receptor type I (IGF-IR) in human embryonic and fetal lung tissues at 4-12 wk of gestation. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of IGF-I/II-IGF-IR ligands and mRNA transcripts in embryonic lungs as early as 4 wk gestation. Immunotargeting using an anti-IGF-IR neutralizing antibody on human fetal lung explants demonstrated a significant blockade of IGF-IR signaling. Inactivation of IGF-IR resulted in a loss of endothelial cells, accompanied by dramatic changes in fetal lung explant morphology. Terminal transferase dUTP end-labeling assay and TEM studies of anti-IGF-IR-treated lungs demonstrated numerous apoptotic mesenchymal cells. Rat embryonic lung explant studies further validated the importance of the IGF-IGF-IR system for lung vascular development.

Compared with sporadic ones, the tumors in VHL disease develop at an earlier age and often multifocally. Histologic features of VHL tumors are characterized by their high degree of vascularization and the presence of a clear cell component. Hypervascularization is induced by overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and because the principal function of VHL protein is the negative regulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs including VEGF mRNA, inactivation of VHL gene plays critical roles in angiogenesis of the VHL tumors. In addition, since VHL protein is also required for the down-regulation of transcription activity of certain genes for the cell growth and cell cycle, inactivation of VHL gene may contribute to tumorigenesis of the VHL tumors. A significant difference in the frequency of types of VHL gene mutation has been noted among the affected families, known as the genotype-phenotype correlations.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2003-01-23", "authors": ["ToshiakiSano", "HidehisaHoriguchi"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.10253"}

The biologic relevance of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis in the control of hair cycling, however, has remained unknown. We studied the expression and biologic role of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) during the induced adult hair follicle cycle in wild-type, TSP-1 deficient, and TSP-1 overexpressing transgenic mice. TSP-1 expression was absent from hair bulb and dermal papilla cells during early to mid-anagen but was highly upregulated throughout the catagen involution phase. In TSP-1 deficient mice, the follicle growth phase was significantly prolonged, associated with increased perifollicular vascularization and vascular proliferation. Conversely, hair follicle growth was delayed in K14/TSP-1 transgenic mice that expressed high levels of TSP-1 in outer root sheath keratinocytes, associated with reduced perifollicular vascularization. These effects were most probably mediated via its antiangiogenic effects because TSP-1 did not affect the growth of cultured murine vibrissae in the absence of a functional vascular system.

Tumour sections were immunostained for von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to visualize blood vessels; for endothelial-specific nitric-oxide-synthase (EC-NOS), as a marker of endothelial cell activation; and for Ki-67 to evaluate endothelial cell proliferation. It was found that endothelial cells lining venous vessels located in peritumoural fibrous tissue were intensely EC-NOS-positive and occasionally Ki-67-positive. Capillary vessels of tumour papillae were not stained for Ki-67 and were weakly EC-NOS-positive. Primary cultures of papillary carcinoma cells were used as a potential source of factors active on endothelial cells. It was found that thyroid tumour cells contain RNAs for angiopoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF-C; moreover, they release large amounts of VEGF into culture supernatants and exert chemotactic activity in vitro for the endothelial cell line SIEC. The ability of papillary carcinoma cells to release angiogenic factors could be stimulated in vitro. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; 25 ng/ml) induced a 1.2- to 5-fold increase in the amount of VEGF released by tumour cells and a 1.2- to 4.2-fold increase in the amount of chemotactic activity present in culture supernatants.

To monitor therapeutic effects, improved noninvasive analyses of functional data are required, in addition to the assessment of tumor volume and histology. Here, we report on sequential monitoring of vascularization of human squamous cell carcinomas growing as heterotransplants in nude mice using MRI. Using a custom-developed animal coil in a conventional whole-body 1.5 T MRI scanner, dynamic T1w sequences were recorded after i.v. injection of Gd-DTPA in tumors grown for 17, 21, 25, 29 and 33 days. Amplitude and the exchange rate constant (k(ep)) were calculated according to a 2-compartment model, discriminating intravascular and interstitial spaces, and correlated with tumor size and histology. High-resolution imaging of small heterotransplants from 100 to 1,000 mm(3) was achieved, clearly discriminating vital and necrotic areas. Preceding the development of necroses, which were hyperintense in T2w images and confirmed with histology, a local decrease of amplitude and k(ep) values was observed. Significantly higher amplitudes were found in tumor periphery than in central parts, correlating well with the vascular pattern obtained by immunocytochemistry. Tumor size correlated negatively with amplitude, probably as a result of increasing necrotic areas, whereas the reason for the observed increase of k(ep) value with tumor size remains unclear.

Twenty control bone marrows and 15 cases of CML in blastic phase were also studied. Microvessel density (MVD), total vascular area (TVA) and several size- and shape-related parameters were quantitated in the region of most intense vascularization using image analysis. Overall, the group of chronic phase CML had higher MVD and size-related parameters and more branching microvessels than controls. Blastic phase was characterized by increased numbers of microvessels with a rounder shape and smaller caliber than chronic phase. A positive correlation emerged between marrow fibrosis and MVD as well as between white blood cell counts and rounder vessel sections. No relationship existed between microvascular parameters and Hasford or Sokal prognostic scores. In univariate analysis, overall and progression-free survival were adversely affected by MVD, size-related parameters, increased platelet count, age and spleen size. Multivariate analysis indicated that microvessel area was related to progression-free survival, whereas both MVD and area were significant prognosticators of overall survival, even when Hasford or Sokal scores are introduced into the model.

These reconstructed joints were then followed for an average of 12.5 years. These patients represent the entire series and were all successfully contacted and reevaluated for this article. Measures of opening, deviation, excursion, symmetry, and clinical symptoms relating to the reconstructed joints are evaluated.\nMean preoperative interincisal aperture was 12 mm, and postoperative aperture 48.5 mm. Three unilaterally treated patients had lateral excursion with opening. The mean deflection was 4.3 mm toward the operated side. Lateral and protrusive movements were limited in reconstructed joints, but up to 3 mm of protrusion was shown at 12.5 years. Subjectively, all patients rated their function as acceptable and were able to occlude and masticate without difficulty. Symmetry at rest was improved by surgery.\nVascularized metatarsal joints represent a potentially suitable long-term substitute for condylar reconstruction. This limited series shows the technical viability of the procedure. A larger series may be warranted to compare this promising technique with conventional methods of temporomandibular joint reconstruction.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2003-01-14", "authors": ["Leopoldo ELanda", "ChristopherGordon", "NicolasDahar", "George CSotereanos"], "doi": "10.1053/joms.2003.50048"}
{"title": "Vascularization and tissue infiltration of a biodegradable polyurethane matrix.", "abstract": "Urethanes are frequently used in biomedical applications because of their excellent biocompatibility. However, their use has been limited to bioresistant polyurethanes. The aim of this study was to develop a nontoxic biodegradable polyurethane and to test its potential for tissue compatibility. A matrix was synthesized with pentane diisocyanate (PDI) as a hard segment and sucrose as a hydroxyl group donor to obtain a microtextured spongy urethane matrix. The matrix was biodegradable in an aqueous solution at 37 degrees C in vitro as well as in vivo. The polymer was mechanically stable at body temperatures and exhibited a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 67 degrees C. The porosity of the polymer network was between 10 and 2000 microm, with the majority of pores between 100 and 300 microm in diameter. This porosity was found to be adequate to support the adherence and proliferation of bone-marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and chondrocytes in vitro. The degradation products of the polymer were nontoxic to cells in vitro. Subdermal implants of the PDI-sucrose matrix did not exhibit toxicity in vivo and did not induce an acute inflammatory response in the host. However, some foreign-body giant cells did accumulate around the polymer and in its pores, suggesting its degradation is facilitated by hydrolysis as well as by giant cells. More important, subdermal implants of the polymer allowed marked infiltration of vascular and connective tissue, suggesting the free flow of fluids and nutrients in the implants. Because of the flexibility of the mechanical strength that can be obtained in urethanes and because of the ease with which a porous microtexture can be achieved, this matrix may be useful in many tissue-engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

In the glands of both sexes only one acinar cell type was found. The cell is characterized by the presence of numerous lipid vacuoles of variable size and by a small number of PAS-positive, electron-dense granules distributed throughout the cytoplasm, which are predominant at the basal portion of each acinar cell. The duct system is well developed within the gland. The content of lipid vacuoles within the acinar cells is secreted from the apical portions by exocytosis, indicating the exocrine function of the organ. Apart from the lipid vacuoles, both acinar and ductal luminal contents of the Harderian gland also contain accretion of electron-dense materials. The vascularization within the Harderian gland is unique in that two capillary types (small fenestrated and irregular sinusoidal capillaries) could be demonstrated. The presence of fenestrated capillaries together with other morphological features (such as accumulation of the small electron-dense granules at the basal pole and the presence of basolateral microvilli) near the basal portion of the acinar cells suggest that the Harderian gland in T. glis might also be involved in an endocrine function.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2003-01-10", "authors": ["WisuitPradidarcheep", "SomlukAsavapongpatana", "ThawornMingsakul", "RaksawanPoonkhum", "SomneukNilbu-nga", "ReonSomana"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10066"}

We have found that a short treatment with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induces tolerance to fully mismatched mouse islet allografts that is stable to challenge with donor-type spleen cells and allows acceptance of donor-type vascularized heart grafts. This effect is enhanced by co-administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a selective inhibitor of T and B cell proliferation that has also effects similar to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on DCs. Graft acceptance is associated with an increased percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory cells in the spleen and in the draining lymph node that can protect 100% of syngeneic recipients from islet allograft rejection. CD4(+)CD25(+) cells, able to inhibit the T cell response to a pancreatic autoantigen and to significantly delay disease transfer by pathogenic CD4(+)CD25(-) cells, are also induced by treatment of adult nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice with 1,25-dihydroxy-16,23Z-diene-26,27-hexafluoro-19-nor vitamin D(3) (BXL-698).

{"title": "Targeting the tumor blood vessel network to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy.", "abstract": "It has been well established that the vascularization of solid tumors is a prerequisite if a clinically relevant size is to be reached. For progressive tumor growth, the vessel network must continuously expand to satisfy the neoplastic cells' nutritional needs and waste product removal requirements. This utter reliance of the tumor on its vasculature provides a logical target for new approaches to cancer therapy. Indeed, there currently exists a great deal of enthusiasm for the development of interventions that compromise the growth and/or function of the tumor neovasculature. Two primary directions are being pursued. Inhibitors of angiogenesis seek to interrupt the angiogenic process to prevent new vessel formation. Antivascular approaches aim to cause direct damage to the tumor endothelium and thus lead to extensive secondary neoplastic cell death. The application of such strategies as adjuvants to conventional radiation treatments offers unique opportunities to develop more effective cancer therapies.", "journal": "Seminars in radiation oncology", "date": "2003-01-10", "authors": ["Dietmar WSiemann", "WenyinShi"], "doi": "10.1053/srao.2003.50005"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of additional phytohormone signals in the vascularization required for rapid tumor proliferation. In stem tumors of Ricinus communis L., free auxin and zeatin riboside concentrations increased within 2 weeks to 15-fold the concentrations in control stem tissue. Auxin and cytokinin immunolocalization revealed the highest concentrations within and around tumor vascular bundles with concentration gradients. The time-course of changes in free auxin concentration in roots was inversely correlated with that in the tumors. The high ethylene emission induced by increased auxin- and cytokinin correlated with a 36-fold accumulation of abscisic acid in tumors. Ethylene emitted from tumors and exogenously applied ethylene caused an increase in abscisic acid concentrations also in the host leaves, with a diminution in leaf water vapor conductance. Jasmonic acid concentration reached a maximum already within the first week of bacterial infection. A wound effect could be excluded. The results demonstrate the concerted interaction of a cascade of transiently induced, non-T-DNA-encoded phytohormones jasmonic acid, ethylene and abscisic acid with T-DNA-encoded auxin and zeatin riboside plus trans-zeatin, all of which are required for successful plant tumor vascularization and development together with inhibition of host plant growth.", "journal": "Planta", "date": "2003-01-10", "authors": ["DmitryVeselov", "MarkusLanghans", "WolframHartung", "RoniAloni", "IvoFeussner", "ClaudiaG\u00f6tz", "SvetlanaVeselova", "StefanSchlomski", "ChristophDickler", "KnutB\u00e4chmann", "Cornelia IUllrich"], "doi": "10.1007/s00425-002-0883-5"}
{"title": "Genetic analysis of three-dimensional shape of mouse lung tumors reveals eight lung tumor shape-determining (Ltsd) loci that are associated with tumor heterogeneity and symmetry.", "abstract": "Most lung tumor linkage studies focus on identifying loci that confer susceptibility or resistance irrespective of the tumor types developed. However, different mouse strains develop different types of lung tumors. A major obstacle for genetic studies of these differences is the lack of reproducible, quantitative, and uniform assessment of tumor type. We have previously described a new variable (Rratio) that assesses the three-dimensional shape of lung tumors in a quantifiable way and showed that nonspherical tumors are correlated with tumor heterogeneity and with a tendency to asymmetrical growth (N. Tripodis and P. Demant, Exp. Lung Res., 27: 521-531, 2001). In the present study, we use the Rratio variable to search for quantitative trait loci affecting tumor phenotype. We tested the F(2) cross between the susceptible strain O20 and the recombinant congenic strain OcB-9. Both develop mixed alveolar and papillary lung tumors, and the OcB9 tumors are, on average, more elongated than the O20 ones. We mapped eight new lung tumor shape-determining loci (Ltsd1-8) involved in mutual interactions. Two of these loci, Ltsd1 and Ltsd3, seem to play a major role in tumor shape formation. The Ltsd4 locus was confirmed in a second F(2) cross between strain O20 and the recombinant congenic strain OcB-6. Genotype-phenotype associations show that nonspherical tumors are correlated with tumor heterogeneity and nonsymmetrical (focal) development of structures. Most of the new Ltsd loci map in regions where susceptibility to lung cancer (Sluc) loci have been previously mapped, raising the question of whether they are identical or closely linked loci. Based on models of tumor growth indicating that supply of nutrients and the ability to create a capillary network may be shape-determining factors (G. P. Pescarmona et al., Med. Hypoth., 53: 497-503, 1999), we suggest as likely candidates for the Ltsd loci genes involved in angiogenesis, vascularization, and capillary patterning. This is the first set of loci that affects qualitative aspects of lung tumors and may provide biologically and clinically interesting indicators of lung tumor progression.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-01-09", "authors": ["NikosTripodis", "PeterDemant"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Inhibition of skin tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo by activation of cannabinoid receptors.", "abstract": "Nonmelanoma skin cancer is one of the most common malignancies in humans. Different therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these tumors are currently being investigated. Given the growth-inhibiting effects of cannabinoids on gliomas and the wide tissue distribution of the two subtypes of cannabinoid receptors (CB(1) and CB(2)), we studied the potential utility of these compounds in anti-skin tumor therapy. Here we show that the CB(1) and the CB(2) receptor are expressed in normal skin and skin tumors of mice and humans. In cell culture experiments pharmacological activation of cannabinoid receptors induced the apoptotic death of tumorigenic epidermal cells, whereas the viability of nontransformed epidermal cells remained unaffected. Local administration of the mixed CB(1)/CB(2) agonist WIN-55,212-2 or the selective CB(2) agonist JWH-133 induced a considerable growth inhibition of malignant tumors generated by inoculation of epidermal tumor cells into nude mice. Cannabinoid-treated tumors showed an increased number of apoptotic cells. This was accompanied by impairment of tumor vascularization, as determined by altered blood vessel morphology and decreased expression of proangiogenic factors (VEGF, placental growth factor, and angiopoietin 2).

In the best-defined model of autoimmune disease, murine experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), for example, brain-protein-specific autoimmune responses of both major classes, type-1 and type-2, have been implicated in causing brain pathology. We induced type-1 and type-2 autoimmunity to myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) in C57.BL/6 mice. Instead of using pertussis toxin (PTX) to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is the classic procedure, we set an aseptic cerebral injury (ACI) to see what the consequences of pre-primed, autoreactive type-1 and type-2 memory T cells gaining access to the brain in the course of sterile tissue injury would be. Neither of these autoimmune response types induced pathology; on the contrary, both accelerated re-vascularization and post-traumatic healing. The data suggest that induction of either type-1 or type-2 autoimmune responses is not inherently noxious to the host, but can have beneficial effects on tissue repair.

Arterioles, venules, and capillaries can be directly visualized, and the movement of individual blood cells through them can be observed. The present study was performed to investigate the use of prefabricated acellular dermal matrix with an arteriovenous unit for the repair of abdominal muscle defects. OPS imaging was used to determine the presence of a functional microcirculation in the neovascularized matrix. In Sprague-Dawley rats, vascularized matrix was prefabricated by placing the superficial epigastric artery and vein on a 2-cm x 2-cm implant-type acellular dermal matrix in the thigh. Three weeks after implantation, the matrix-arteriovenous unit was elevated as an axial-type flap and a 2-cm x 2-cm full-thickness block of abdominal muscle immediately superior to the inguinal ligament was resected. Additional procedures were performed according to group: no repair (group 1, n = 20); repair with nonvascularized acellular dermal matrix (group 2, n = 20); repair with devascularized acellular dermal matrix (group 3, = 20); and repair with vascularized acellular dermal matrix (group 4, n = 20). OPS imaging (field of view, 1 mm in diameter; scan depth range, 0.2 mm) was performed on both sides of each flap on a total of 10 random distal regions before and after pedicle transection in group 3 and with the pedicle preserved in group 4. Hernia rate and duration of survival were compared for 21 days. OPS imaging showed directional blood cell movement through the capillary network in all areas scanned in group 4. No microvascular perfusion was observed after pedicle transection in group 3. Hernia rates of 100, 80, 90, and 0 percent were seen in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Median survival times of 9, 11.5, 9, and 21 postoperative days were noted in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Histopathologic analysis with factor VIII revealed full-thickness infiltration of the matrix by endothelial cells, signifying newly formed blood vessels. Repair of abdominal muscle defects using vascularized acellular dermal matrix resulted in no hernia and survival of all animals for the duration of study. However, repairs using avascular or devascularized matrix resulted in significant rates of hernia and decreased survival. Acellular dermal matrix can be prefabricated into vascularized tissue using an arteriovenous unit and used successfully to repair abdominal muscle defects. OPS imaging allowed for high-contrast direct visualization of microcirculation in previously acellular tissue following prefabrication with an arteriovenous unit.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-12-24", "authors": ["SeumChung", "AlexesHazen", "Jamie PLevine", "GermaniaBaux", "Wendy-Ann MOlivier", "Herman TYee", "Michael SMargiotta", "Nolan SKarp", "Geoffrey CGurtner"], "doi": "10.1097/01.PRS.0000034934.05304.ED"}

In this study, the temporal and spatial expression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2, 4, and 7 was examined in a rabbit model of mandibular distraction osteogenesis. Fourteen skeletally mature male rabbits were studied. After osteotomy, a distractor was applied to one side of the mandible. After 1 week of latency, distraction was initiated at 0.25 mm every 12 hours for 3 weeks (distraction period), followed by a 3-week consolidation period. Two animals were killed each week after surgery. The generate bone was analyzed for the expression of BMP-2, -4, and -7 by using standard bone histological and immunohistochemical techniques. BMP-2 and -4 were highly expressed in osteoblastic cells during the distraction period and in chondrocytes during the consolidation period. BMP-7 demonstrated relatively minor expression in osteoblastic cells during the distraction period. All BMPs were strongly expressed in vascularized connective tissue during the distraction period.

To determine if placental structure is altered so as to impair function despite increased size, the effect of maternal protein restriction on the composition and vascularization of the placenta in the rat was determined. Pregnant rats were randomized to receive either a normal protein (20 per cent) or an isocaloric low (8 per cent) protein diet. Placentae were studied at day 18 of gestation. Tissue sections were stained with biotinylated Bandeiraea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin to allow identification of foetal capillaries, and analysed using stereological techniques. Protein restriction increased total placental volume, but decreased the proportion of the placental volume composed of labyrinth. Consequently the total volumes of labyrinthine tissue and of foetal and maternal blood space were not different between the two groups. Protein restriction increased the surface area density and total surface area of the materno-foetal interface, but did not alter foetal capillary surface area, diameter or length. This study found that maternal protein restriction is associated with an increase in placental size, and that this enlargement is accompanied by increases in some, but not all, structural correlates of function.", "journal": "Placenta", "date": "2002-12-24", "authors": ["C BDoherty", "R MLewis", "ASharkey", "G JBurton"], "doi": "10.1053/plac.2002.0858"}

Superficial and deep branches of the inferior medial genicular artery contribute to an arterial arch that courses deep to the PA insertion. A widespread array of small vessels and nerve fibers penetrate the PA insertion and course along the length of the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons. Computer analysis revealed that the mean diameter of the vessels decreased from 2201 microm at the insertion to 661 microm midway along the length of the tendon (mean tendon length = 17 cm; range = 13-21 cm); the cross-sectional area of the vessels per histologic section decreased from 336.37-137.05 microm(2).

At her 5-year follow-up visit, we assessed placental involution by measuring serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin and by using color and pulsed Doppler sonography. The dynamics of the regression of placental volume yielded a bimodal curve: a phase of decrease over the first 2 months, coincident with a reduction in vascularization, followed by stability that lasted 6-8 months, and a second phase of gradual volume reduction.

{"title": "Steroid hormone regulation of angiogenesis in the primate endometrium.", "abstract": "The human endometrium develops new capillaries from existing microvessels, i.e. angiogenesis, which then undergo maturation and remodeling, i.e. investment of microvessels with periendothelial mural cells, into a new vascular network during each menstrual cycle. Improper vascularization of the endometrium may cause implantation failure and infertility. Estrogen and progesterone have pivotal roles in establishing this vascular bed, but the cellular sites and mechanisms of action of these steroid hormones are incompletely understood. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1, and angiopoietin-2 and their receptors are expressed in the human and nonhuman primate endometrium and interact to control vascular development and remodeling. VEGF synthesis within and neovascularization of the endometrium seem to be sustained and ongoing processes designed to progressively promote growth and development of the endometrium with advancing stages of the menstrual cycle. However, estrogen rapidly upregulates VEGF expression by endometrial glandular epithelial and stromal cells in vivo in the nonhuman primate and in vitro in the human. Reports of the effects of progesterone on endometrial VEGF formation, however, are inconsistent and may reflect regulatory actions on particular isoforms of VEGF. In addition, estrogen has effects on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, which may be direct or mediated by VEGF. Very little is known, however, about the steroid hormone regulation of other angiostimulatory and angioinhibitory factors, e.g. angiopoietin-1 and -2, in the endometrium. Moreover, the role of steroid hormones acting directly, or indirectly via VEGF and other angiogenic factors, on expression of integrins, cell adhesion and other molecules required for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions important for angiogenesis in the human and nonhuman primate endometrium is largely unknown. Finally, further study is needed of cell-specific responsivity and function in the human endometrium with respect to steroid hormone regulation of angiogenesis.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library", "date": "2002-11-29", "authors": ["Eugene DAlbrecht", "Gerald JPepe"], "doi": "10.2741/1001"}
{"title": "Circulation is established in a stepwise pattern in the mammalian embryo.", "abstract": "To better understand the relationship between the embryonic hematopoietic and vascular systems, we investigated the establishment of circulation in mouse embryos by examining the redistribution of yolk sac-derived primitive erythroblasts and definitive hematopoietic progenitors. Our studies revealed that small numbers of erythroblasts first enter the embryo proper at 4 to 8 somite pairs (sp) (embryonic day 8.25 [E8.25]), concomitant with the proposed onset of cardiac function. Hours later (E8.5), most red cells remained in the yolk sac. Although the number of red cells expanded rapidly in the embryo proper, a steady state of approximately 40% red cells was not reached until 26 to 30 sp (E10). Additionally, erythroblasts were unevenly distributed within the embryo's vasculature before 35 sp. These data suggest that fully functional circulation is established after E10. This timing correlated with vascular remodeling, suggesting that vessel arborization, smooth muscle recruitment, or both are required. We also examined the distribution of committed hematopoietic progenitors during early embryogenesis. Before E8.0, all progenitors were found in the yolk sac. When normalized to circulating erythroblasts, there was a significant enrichment (20- to 5-fold) of progenitors in the yolk sac compared with the embryo proper from E9.5 to E10.5. These results indicated that the yolk sac vascular network remains a site of progenitor production and preferential adhesion even as the fetal liver becomes a hematopoietic organ. We conclude that a functional vascular system develops gradually and that specialized vascular-hematopoietic environments exist after circulation becomes fully established.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2002-10-31", "authors": ["Kathleen EMcGrath", "Anne DKoniski", "JeffreyMalik", "JamesPalis"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2002-08-2531"}
{"title": "Sole activation of three luminal adenosine receptor subtypes in different parts of coronary vasculature.", "abstract": "In isolated guinea pig hearts saline perfused at constant flow, adenosine A(1), A(2A), and A(3) (A(x)) agonists covalently bound to a large polymer (Pol; 2,000 kDa) were intracoronarily administered, and three effects were studied: dromotropic, vascular and inotropic. The rank order of potencies were the following: dromotropic (Pol-A(2A)Pol-A(1)>Pol-A(3)) and vascular and inotropic (Pol-A(2A)> or =Pol-A(1)Pol-A(3)), where the rank order of potency for Pol-A(x) depends on the part of the coronary vascular network involved; i.e., there is a vascular heterogeneity. The large size of Pol-A(x) prevents extravascular diffusion and causes it to act solely in the endothelial luminal surface. This implies their cardiac effects are due to endothelial mediators. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) synthesis with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and indomethacin, respectively, show that the three cardiac effects of Pol-A(1) were mediated by NO and PG, whereas for Pol-A(2A) and Pol-A(3) the mediator was mainly NO but not PG.

Allogenic transplantation was performed on 12-week-old male DA rats with the major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) RT1a (as the donor) and age-matched male Lewis rats with MHC RT1l (as the recipient), and isogenic transplantation was performed on 12-week-old male Lewis rats.

Bone biochemical markers, mineral density, and strength were measured at the end of the study period. Serum levels of osteocalcin (OC) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) level were higher in the allogenic transplanted rats than in the isogenic transplanted rats. In the allogenic transplanted rats, the cerivastatin treatment decreased urinary DPD levels, but not serum OC nor PTH levels. Furthermore, the cerivastatin treatment improved bone mineral density of the allogenic transplanted bones and bone strength of the allogenic reconstructed bones.

As the UVB component of sunlight is a major contributor to photocarcinogenesis, we aimed to explore the effects of UVB radiation on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression, using the immortalized keratinocyte cell line HaCaT as a model for transformed premalignant epithelial cells. In the present paper, we studied the molecular mechanism of UVB-induced VEGF providing a major angiogenic activity in tumour progression and invasion. After 12-24 h of UVB irradiation, a 2.4- to 2.7-fold increase in endogenous VEGF protein level was measured, correlating with an up to 2.5-fold induction of promoter-based reporter gene constructs of VEGF. Furthermore, we identified a GC-rich UVB-responsive region between -87 and -65 bp of the VEGF promoter. In electrophoretic mobility-shift assays, this region binds Sp1-dependent protein complexes constitutively and an additional UVB-inducible protein complex distinct from Sp1 protein. The transcription factor AP-2 (activator protein-2) was detected as a component of the UVB-inducible protein complex. The critical role of the AP-2/Sp1 (specificity protein 1) cluster was supported by demonstration of a significant reduction of UVB-mediated promoter activity upon deletion of this recognition site. The specificity of this region for UVB irradiation was demonstrated using PMA, which increased VEGF activity in HaCaT cells after transient transfection of the deleted promoter construct.
