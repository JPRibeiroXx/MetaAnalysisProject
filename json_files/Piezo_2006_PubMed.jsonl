{"title": "The use of trichloroacetic acid imprinted polymer coated quartz crystal microbalance as a screening method for determination of haloacetic acids in drinking water.", "abstract": "An alternative screening method for haloacetic acids (HAAs) disinfection by-products in drinking water is described. The method is based on the use of piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) transducing system, where the electrode is coated with a trichloacetic acid-molecularly imprinted polymer (TCAA-MIP). This MIP comprises a crosslinked poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate-co-4-vinylpyridine). The coated QCM is able to specifically detect the analytes in water samples in terms of the mass change in relation to acid-base interactions of the analytes with the MIP. The TCAA-MIP coated QCM showed high specificity for the determination of TCAA in aqueous solutions containing inorganic anions, but its sensitivity reduced in water samples containing hydrochloric acid due to a mass loss at the sensor surface. Cross-reactivity studies with HAA analogs (dichloro-, monochloro-, tribromo-, dibromo-, and monobromo-acetic acids) and non-structurally related TCAA molecules (acetic acid and malonic acid) indicated that recognition of the structurally related TCAA compounds by the TCAA-MIP-based QCM is due to a carboxylic acid functional group, and probably involves a combination of both size and shape selectivity. The total response time of sensor is in the order of 10min. The achieved limits of detection for HAAs (20-50mugl(-1)) are at present higher than the actual concentrations found in real-life samples, but below the guidelines for the maximum permissible levels (60mugl(-1) for mixed HAAs). Recovery studies with drinking water samples spiked with TCAA or spiked with mixtures of HAAs revealed the reproducibility and precision of the method. The present work has demonstrated that the proposed assay can be a fast, reliable and inexpensive screening method for HAA contaminants in water samples, but further refinement is required to improve the limits of detection.", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2008-10-31", "authors": ["RoongnapaSuedee", "WimonIntakong", "Franz LDickert"], "doi": "10.1016/j.talanta.2006.04.033"}

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is responsible of several infections in humans, like pneumonia, meningitis and endocarditic. MRSA is also a major cause of hospital-acquired infections worldwide. The antibiotics resistance is conferred by the gene mecA, codifying for an anomalous protein. Two different immobilisation procedures of the probe specific for mecA gene are reported: immobilisation via streptavidin-biotin interaction and direct immobilisation of thiolated probes. After the study with synthetic oligonucleotides, the system has been applied to the analysis of bacterial DNA from MRSA, amplified by polymerase chain reaction. These samples were pre-treated with two different denaturation procedures and the performances of the sensor in the two cases were compared. The two immobilisation methods and denaturation protocols were here used to study the influences of these parameters on the performances of the sensor, applied here to the detection of the mecA gene.

The ALP samples treated with piezoelectric surgery showed a rapid increase, with peak at 30 min, and then declined rapidly within the next 10 minutes. A second experiment was performed to evaluate 4 cutting instruments: drill bits high speed turbine (T1); drill bits contra-angle (T2) Piezoelectric insertions (T3), and manual instruments (controls). This second experiment was to evaluate the ALP activity at 30 min. The T1 samples produced the highest results (3,66499 +- 0,51394); control groups had a lower response (0,72793 +- 0,22353), while the T2 group produced statistically significant higher results (2,77793 +- 0,40553) than T3 (1,16608 +- 0,32676).

The system was composed of two 3-axis piezoelectric element accelerometers, a pair of touch sensors made of thin stainless steel sheets, an analog-digital(AD) converter and a personal computer (PC). Fingerstalls,with these sensors, were attached to subject's index finger and thumb. The acceleration and output of the touch sensors were recorded using the PC during the finger taps movements. Intervals between the single finger taps movements were calculated from the measured output of the touch sensors. Velocities during the single finger taps movements were calculated by integrating the measured acceleration. The amplitudes were calculated by integrating the velocities. The standard deviation of the single finger taps intervals, average of maximum single finger taps velocities and average of maximum single finger taps amplitudes were calculated from them. They were used as features for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The developed system was used to conduct finger taps tests employing 27 normal subjects and 16 Parkinson's diseases subjects. The subjects were asked to execute continuous finger taps movement for 60 s.

A thickness shear mode (TSM) acoustic wave in a piezoelectric thin film is desirable for probing liquid samples because of the poor coupling of shear waves into the liquid.

Furthermore, FBARs can be easily fabricated to operate at higher frequencies, yielding greater sensitivity. An array of sensors offers the possibility of redundancy, allowing for statistical decision making as well as immediate corroboration of results.

These signals provide information about the respiratory activity and heart apex pulse. A comparative analysis was performed both in the time and frequency domain and results were discussed. Moreover, the same transducer used at high frequencies is able to generate ultrasound signals which can bounce off the target organ, the heart, and receive the back-propagated echoes. The experimental validation was done by means of a comparison between the spatial interval inferred from time delay of the return echoes detected by the transducer and the actual distance from the target.

This study presents the utility of the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for direct sub-proteome profiling and membrane protein characterization by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The hydrophobic adsorption of protein, particularly membrane proteins, on the PVDF surface enables efficient on-PVDF washing to remove high concentrations of detergents and salts, such as up to 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The enhanced spectrum quality for MALDI detection is particularly notable for high molecular weight proteins. By using on-PVDF washing prior to MALDI detection, we obtained protein profiles of the detergent-containing and detergent-insoluble membrane fractions from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Similar improvements of signal-to-noise ratios were shown on the MALDI spectra for proteins electroblotted from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) onto the PVDF membrane. We have applied this strategy to obtain intact molecular weights of the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) composed of three intrinsic membrane-bound proteins, PmoA, PmoB, and PmoC. Together with peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry, post-translational modifications including N-terminal acetylation of PmoA and PmoC and alternative C-terminal truncation of PmoB were identified.

Although many applications for ultrafiltration were already suggested, only few were implemented on an industrial scale. Among those techniques, turbulence promoter can be more simple and effective in overcoming membrane fouling and enhancing membrane flux. As for the result that turbulence promoter increase fluid velocity, wall shear rates and produce secondary flows or instabilities, the influence of turbulence promoter was investigated on permeate flux during produced water ultrafiltration and the potential application of this arrangement for an industrial development. Experimental investigations were performed on 100 KDa molecular weight cut-off PVDF single-channel tubular membrane module using four kinds of turbulence promoters. It is observed that the significant flux enhancement in the range of 83%-164% was achieved while the hydraulic dissipated power per unit volume of permeate decreased from 31%-42%, which indicated that the using of turbulence promoter is more efficient than operation without the turbulence promoter. The effects of transmembrane pressure and cross-flow velocity with and without turbulence promoter were studied as well.

At room temperature (20 degrees C), polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane (PVDF-HFM) was employed. In the procedure of extraction, 4 microL of organic solvent (toluene) was used in individual extraction. Pethidine was used as the internal standard (IS) in the sample analysis by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The optimized conditions for tramadol extraction was as follows: toluene as organic solvent, 4 mL sample solution added with 0.1 mL of 1 mol/L NaOH solution, extraction time of 15 mm, and stirring speed of 300 r/min. The sample solutions, containing a series of concentrations of tramadol, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 mg/L, were analyzed. The good linearities were obtained for water, human urine and human plasma samples with the correlation coefficients of 0.999 7, 0.994 8 and 0.998 5, respectively. The detection limits can reach 0.01 mg/L for water and human urine and 0.05 mg/L for human plasma.

The sensor is fabricated from bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT), using a customized process in which micro electro-discharge machining is used to form a steel tool that is subsequently used for batch-mode ultrasonic micromachining of bulk PZT ceramic. The resulting sensor is 50 microm thick and 200 microm in diameter. It is placed in the biopsy needle cavity, against a steel diaphragm which is 300 microm diameter and has an average thickness of 23 microm. Devices were tested in materials that mimic the ultrasound characteristics of human tissue, used in the training of physicians, and with porcine fat and muscle tissue. In both schemes, the magnitude and frequency of an electrical impedance resonance peak showed tissue-specific characteristics as the needle was inserted. For example, in the porcine tissue, the impedance peak frequency changed approximately 13 MHz from the initial 163 MHz, and the magnitude changed approximately 1600 Omega from the initial 2100 Omega, as the needle moved from fat to muscle. Samples including oils and saline solution were tested for calibration, and an empirical tissue contrast model shows an approximately proportional relationship between measured frequency shift and sample acoustic impedance.

For the blend of PVDF/PA11 = 65/35, the TEM image shows that many nanometer-sized PAl1 particles are dispersed in the PVDF domain to form a special type of domain-in-domain morphology. In contrast, no PVDF nano-dispersion was observed in the PA11 phase. The effects of both the screw rotation speed and the mixing time on the blend structure were systematically studied. It shows that the extruder screw rotation speed and the mixing time are two critical factors to prepare the nanostructured blends.

Every crystal unit of the fabricated piezoelectric IgE micro-array immunosensor can oscillate without interfering each other. A multi-channel 2 x 5 model micro-array immunosensor as compared with the traditional one-channel immunosensor can provide eight times higher detection speeds for IgE assay. The anti-IgE antibody is deposited on the gold electrode's surface of 10 MHz AT-cut quartz crystals by SPA (staphylococcal protein A), and serves as an antibody recognizing layer. The highly ordered antibody monolayers ensure well-controlled surface structure and offer many advantages to the performance of the sensor. The uniform amount of antibody monolayer coated by the SPA is good, and non-specific reaction caused by other immunoglobulin in sample is found. The fabricated PZ immunosensor can be used for human IgE determination in the range of 5-300 IU/ml with high precision (CV is 4%). 50 human serum samples were detected by the micro-array immunosensor, and the results agreed well with those given by the commercially ELISA test kits.

The performance of the dental handpiece was experimentally evaluated with respect to rotational speed, torque, and specific finishing energy under the applied clinical finishing conditions. The results show that the rotational speeds of the dental handpiece decreased by increasing either the depth of cut or the feed rate at a constant clinically applied air pressure and water flowrate. They also decreased when increasing both the tangential and normal finishing forces. The specific finishing energy decreased with an increase in either depth of cut or feed rate, while the finishing torque increased as either the depth of cut or the feed rate was increased.

Peak stress, time to peak stress, and impact duration were taken from data recorded by the instrument. Three cartilage biomechanical properties (aggregate modulus, Poisson's ratio, and permeability) were acquired by creep indentation, and tissue morphology rated on a standardized scale was also determined. When subjected to the high level of impact, articular cartilage showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in all three impact metrics and morphology. This high level of impact also resulted in a 37 per cent decrease in the aggregate modulus of the tissue. Lower drop heights resulted in more consistent impact curves, demonstrated less standard deviation, and did not change the biomechanical properties of the tissues.

Our objectives were to characterize the motion of the PZE driver and determine the relationship between columella footplate motion (displacement/ velocity) and the cochlear microphonic recorded from the recessus scala tympani (CMrst). At each frequency, displacement of the PZE driver probe tip was linearly related to the applied voltage over a wide range of attenuation levels (-60 to -20 dBre:50 Vp-p). The mean displacement across frequencies (100-4000 Hz) was 0.221+/-0.042 micromp-p for a constant applied voltage level of -20 dBre:50 Vp-p. Displacement was within 1.5 dB of the mean for this stimulus level at all frequencies except for 4000 Hz, where it was approximately 3 dB higher (p < 0.01). CMrst amplitudes in hatchlings were larger than amplitudes in embryos (p=0.003). For a given frequency, CM was linearly related to footplate displacement and velocity at both ages. The transform ratio of CMrst/A (CM amplitude/displacement) increased at approximately 6 dB/octave at frequencies between 100 and 1000 Hz in hatchlings suggesting that cochlear impedance (Zc) was resistive at these frequencies.

European community legislators have therefore restricted the veterinary use of antibiotics and banned them as growth-promoting food additives in stock breeding (1831/2003/EC). The monitoring of such legislation requires technology for precise and straightforward on-site quantification of antibiotics in farm samples and food products without the need for extensive laboratory equipment and trained personnel. Capitalizing on bacterial transcriptional regulators (TetR, PIP, E), which are dose-dependently released from their cognate operators (tetO, PIR, ETR) upon binding of specific classes of antibiotics (tetracycline, streptogramins, macrolides) we have designed an easy-to-handle dipstick-based assay for detection of antibiotic levels in serum, meat and milk whose detection limits are up to 40-fold below licensed threshold values. The generic dipstick consists of either nitrocellulose, nylon or polyvinylidenfluorid (PVDF) membrane strips coated with streptavidin and immobilized biotinylated operator DNA, which acts as capture DNA to bind hexa-histidine (His(6))-tagged bacterial biosensors. Antibiotics present in specific samples triggered the dose-dependent release of the capture DNA-biosensor interaction, which, after dipping into two different solutions, results in a correlated conversion of a chromogenic substrate by a standard His(6)-targeted enzyme complex. This can be quantified by comparison of the dipstick to a standardized color scale or by assessing the terminal solution at 450nm. As demonstrated using serum, meat and milk samples spiked with 14 different antibiotics, the dipstick technology provided sensitive detection in a rapid assay format, and could be employed to monitor non-authorized use of antibiotics and to discover novel antibiotics.", "journal": "Journal of biotechnology", "date": "2007-01-02", "authors": ["NilsLink", "WilfriedWeber", "MartinFussenegger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiotec.2006.11.011"}

Using finite-element software, the first longitudinal and second lateral-bending frequencies of the vibrator are shown to be very close when its dimensions are 8 mm x 2.16 mm x 1 mm. So one single frequency power should be able to drive the motor. However, in practice the motor is found to be hard to move with a single frequency power because of its small vibration amplitudes and big frequency difference between its longitudinal and bending resonance, which is induced by the boundary condition variation. To drive the motor effectively, an amplitude modulation drive is used by superimposing two signals with nearly the same frequencies, around the resonant frequency of the vibrators of the linear motor. When the amplitude modulation frequency is close to the resonant frequency of the vibrator's surroundings, experimental results show that the linear motor can move back and forward with a maximum thrust force (over 0.016 N) and a maximum velocity (over 50 mm/s).", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2006-12-26", "authors": ["YangMing", "BenHanson", "Martin CLevesley", "Peter GWalker", "Kevin GWatterson"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2006.191"}

{"title": "An EMG screening method (dysphagia limit) for evaluation of neurogenic dysphagia in childhood above 5 years old.", "abstract": "Oropharyngeal dysphagia is not rare in older children before the adult age, especially the patients with cerebral palsy. Non-invasive simple tests are needed for the evaluation of children with neurogenic dysphagia including the patients with cerebral palsy. So we aimed to evaluate non-invasive ways to screen for dysphagia in children and the usefulness of this almost new electrophysiologic method for the detection of dysphagia in children with cerebral palsy. Twenty-eight healthy children and 12 patients with cerebral palsy were investigated for the applicability of this method. The movement of the larynx was monitored using a simple piezoelectric wafer sensor and submental surface EMG activity was recorded by bipolar silver-chloride electrodes taped under the chin over the submental muscle complex. The onset and duration of pharyngeal swallowing was recorded from submental-suprahyoid muscles such as the mylohyoid-genitohyoid-anterior digastric complex. By this method, the maximal water volume capacity was measured in single swallows with progressively increasing water volumes, this was called 'dysphagia limit'. The healthy control children revealed to swallow the bolus at once maximally 11.2+/-0.4 and 2.5 ml in average. Dysphagia limit varied from 7 to above 20 ml water volume from age 5-16 years old. Patients with cerebral palsy had the dysphagia limit of 7.7+/-1.8 and 6.4 ml in average. The dysphagia limit was significantly reduced in patients with cerebral palsy (p<0.05).

The most efficient way to fight drug-resistant bacteria is to detect their colonies, identify their type, monitor their growth, and destroy them before they reach the human body.

In particular, the effects of melt quenching, cold drawing, and annealing just below the melting region are studied with respect to potential possibilities and limitations for improving the piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of PA 11. A relaxation map is obtained from DRS that shows especially the crossover region where the cooperative alpha relaxation and the local beta relaxation merge into a single high-temperature process. No fundamental difference between quenched, cold-drawn, and annealed films is found, though in the cold-drawn (ferroelectric) film the alpha relaxation is suppressed and slowed down, but it is at least partly recovered by subsequent annealing. It is concluded that there exists an amorphous phase in all structures, even in the cold-drawn film. The amorphous phase can be more rigid or more viscoelastic depending on preparation. Cold drawing not only leads to crystallization in a ferroelectric form but also to higher rigidity of the remaining amorphous phase. Annealing just below the melting region after cold drawing causes a stronger phase separation between the crystalline phase and a more viscoelastic amorphous phase.", "journal": "The Journal of chemical physics", "date": "2006-12-15", "authors": ["PeterFr\u00fcbing", "AlexanderKremmer", "ReimundGerhard-Multhaupt", "AnnaSpanoudaki", "PolycarposPissis"], "doi": "10.1063/1.2360266"}

NaCIO was fed to the membrane module at a dosage of 0.5 mg/L and maintained during filtration. To observe the effect of raw water, three types of raw and processed waters, including river surface water, coagulated water and coagulated-settled water, were employed. In the case of river surface water, the transmembrane pressure increased abruptly in 500 hours operation. On the contrary, no significant increase in transmembrane pressure was observed for coagulated water and coagulated-settled water for 1200 hours operation. The turbidity of permeate was lower than the detection limit for all applied waters. The removal efficiency for humic substances in coagulated water and coagulated-settled water was approximately ten times higher than that in surface river water. And, the removal efficiency for TOC and DOC was approximately two times higher than that in surface river water. From the results of the operation, it can be observed that it is possible to maintain stable operation at 0.9 m(3)/m(2)-day filtration flux through a combination of pre-coagulation and pre-chlorination. However, the water quality of permeate was the best when the pre-coagulation-sedimentation process was combined with pre-chlorination.

This PE-FET has been applied as a force/pressure sensor for measuring forces in the nanonewton range and even smaller with the use of smaller NWs.

{"title": "A comparative study of the cytoskeleton binding drugs nocodazole and taxol with a mammalian cell quartz crystal microbalance biosensor: different dynamic responses and energy dissipation effects.", "abstract": "The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to create piezoelectric whole-cell biosensors utilizing either living endothelial cells (ECs) or the metastatic human mammary cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 adhering to the gold QCM surface under in vitro growth conditions. We utilized the whole-cell QCM biosensors for the detection of the effects of varying concentrations of the microtubule binding drugs taxol and nocodazole by measuring changes in the QCM steady state frequency (Deltaf) and motional resistance (DeltaR), shift values. Using 0.11-50 microM nocodazole, we observed the Deltaf shift values of the biosensors, consisting of 20,000 ECs, to decrease significantly in magnitude (nearly 100%) to a limiting value, in a dose-dependent fashion, over a 5- to 6-h incubation period following drug addition. This effect is consistent with nocodazole's known disruption of intracellular microtubules. On the other hand, 10 microM taxol caused little alteration in Deltaf over the same time period, consistent with its microtubule hyperstabilization effect. When the EC QCM biosensor Deltaf shift values were normalized by the number of ECs found firmly attached to the QCM surface via trypsin removal and electronic counting, the dose curve was shifted to lower nocodazole concentrations, resulting in a more sensitive drug biosensor. The kinetics of the Deltaf decrease with increasing nocodazole concentrations measured by the EC QCM biosensor was found to be similar at all drug concentrations and was well fit by a single first-order exponential decay equation. For all nocodazole doses, t(0.5) was invariant, averaging t(0.5)=0.83+/-0.14 h. These data demonstrate that a single dynamic sensing system within the cell, the microtubules, is disrupted by the addition of nocodazole and this process is sensed by the cell QCM biosensor. This interpretation of the data was confirmed by a fluorescence light microscopy investigation of ECs undergoing treatment with increasing nocodazole doses using a fluorescent antibody to alpha-tubulin. These studies revealed a corresponding loss of the spread morphology of the cells, concomitant with a rearrangement of the extended native microtubules into increasingly large aggregates with the cells eventually lifting from the surface in significant numbers at 50 microM. At 6 microM nocodazole, partial reversibility of the EC QCM biosensor was demonstrated. These results indicate that the EC QCM biosensor can be used to detect and study EC cytoskeleton alterations and dynamics.

Significantly, it is observed that the band gaps of a phononic crystal slab are distinct from those of bulk acoustic waves propagating in the plane of an infinite two-dimensional phononic crystal with the same composition.

The materials utilized for this study included nonporous polycarbonate (PC) sheets, polyamide (PA) nanofiltration composite membranes and porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microfiltration membranes (nominal pore size: 0.65 microm). Coupons of each material were placed in a biologically active annular reactor for up to 300 days, and subjected to a constant shear field (0.12 N m(-2)), which induced sessile microbial growth from acetate amended municipal tap water. Acoustic monitoring was non-destructively executed by traversing coupons in a constant temperature water bath using a spherically focused 20-MHz immersion transducer. This semi-automated system was configured to obtain reflections from 50 regions (c.a. 120x10(3) microm2) distributed evenly near the centerline of each coupon. The resulting reflected power distributions were compared with standard biochemical and microscopic assays that described surface associated biofilms. When compared to clean (virgin) conditions, biofilms growing on coupons induced consistent attenuations in reflection amplitude, which caused statistically significant shifts in reflected power (p<0.01). Using exocellular polysaccharides as a surrogate measure of total biofilm mass, UFDR was able to detect biofilms developing on any of the materials tested at surface-averaged masses < or = 150 microg cm(-2). Above these threshold levels, increasing amounts of exocellular polysaccharides correlated with significant decreases in total reflected power (TRP). The distribution of biomass on the coupon surfaces determined by acoustic spectra was consistent with that observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM).

In this study, sonomicrometry was used in an ovine model to compute systolic leaflet curvature at varying afterloads and states of contractility.\nThe anterior leaflet of 12 sheep was instrumented with 5 piezoelectric transducers in a cruciate array. Systolic blood pressure ranged from 90 to 200 mm Hg with increasing phenylephrine hydrochloride infusion. Epinephrine was used to vary contractile state. Leaflet curvature was calculated continuously (200 Hz) during systole.\nAnterior leaflet curvature in the septolateral direction was double that in the intercommisural direction. There were also significant changes in leaflet curvature during systole. Curvature in neither direction was affected by afterload. Epinephrine augmented intercommisural curvature in a dose-independent fashion, whereas it had no effect on curvature in the septolateral direction.\nDynamic mitral anterior leaflet geometry was found to be amazingly constant over a wide range of hemodynamic conditions.

Extension of treatment time with cysteine beyond 3h did not further increase fertilization rates, suggesting that cysteine promoted early developmental events after ICSI (e.g. decondensation of sperm chromatin). There was no effect of cysteine supplementation on oocyte glutathione levels after ICSI. Pretreatment of spermatozoa for 3h with 1.71 mM cysteine did not improve fertilization rates.

When the sensor element contacts an object a change in the resonance frequency is observed, and this feature has been utilized in sensor systems to describe physical properties of different objects. For medical applications it has been used to measure stiffness variations due to various patho-physiological conditions. In this study the sensor's ability to measure the stiffness of prostate tissue, from two excised prostatectomy specimens in vitro, was analysed. The specimens were also subjected to morphometric measurements, and the sensor parameter was compared with the morphology of the tissue with linear regression. In the probe impression interval 0.5-1.7 mm, the maximum R(2) > or = 0.60 (p < 0.05, n = 75). An increase in the proportion of prostate stones (corpora amylacea), stroma, or cancer in relation to healthy glandular tissue increased the measured stiffness. Cancer and stroma had the greatest effect on the measured stiffness. The deeper the sensor was pressed, the greater, i.e., deeper, volume it sensed.

None of the monitoring tools now available has proved effective for its early detection. In this study we investigated the efficacy of acoustic analysis for the detection of OLI. We collected lung sounds from 11 patients undergoing thoracic surgery requiring the placement of a double-lumen tube. Recordings of separate lung ventilation were performed after induction and confirmation of adequate tube positioning, before surgery. Samples of lung sounds were collected by three piezoelectric microphones, one on each side of the chest and one on the right forearm, for background noise sampling. The samples were filtered, the signals' energy envelopes were calculated, and segmentation to breath and rest periods was performed. Each respiration was classified into one of the three categories: bilateral ventilation, selective right-lung ventilation, or selective left-lung ventilation, on the basis of the ratio between the energy signals of each lung. OLI was accurately identified in 10 of the 11 patients during right OLI and in all 11 patients during left OLI. This study suggests that acoustic monitoring is effective for the detection of selective lung ventilation and may be useful for early diagnosis of OLI.", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "date": "2006-11-24", "authors": ["ShaiTejman-Yarden", "DrorLederman", "IsraelEilig", "AlexanderZlotnik", "NathanWeksler", "ArnonCohen", "Gabriel MGurman"], "doi": "10.1213/01.ane.0000240909.48774.49"}

In this paper, we demonstrate the application of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to nanoscale imaging of internal structure of human teeth by monitoring the local mechanical response to an electrical bias applied via a conductive tip. It is shown that PFM is capable of detecting dissimilar components of dental tissues, namely, proteins and calcified matrix, which have resembling morphology but different piezoelectric properties. It is demonstrated that collagen fibrils revealed in chemically treated intertubular dentin exhibit high piezoelectric activity and can be visualized in PFM with spatial resolution of 10 nm. Evidence of the presence of protein inclusions of 100-200 nm wide and several micrometers long in tooth enamel has been obtained. Furthermore, it is found that the peritubular dentin and intertubular dentin exhibit different piezoelectric behavior suggesting different concentration of collagen fibrils. The obtained results demonstrate a high potential of PFM in providing an additional insight into the structure of dental tissues.

{"title": "Neurite guidance on protein micropatterns generated by a piezoelectric microdispenser.", "abstract": "In this study, we developed a microdispenser technique in order to create protein patterns for guidance of neurites from cultured adult mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The microdispenser is a micromachined silicon device that ejects 100 picolitre droplets and has the ability to position the droplets with a precision of 6-8 microm. Laminin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to create adhesive and non-adhesive protein lines on polystyrene surfaces (cell culture dishes). Whole-mounted DRGs were then positioned close to the patterns and neurite outgrowth was monitored. The neurites preferred to grow on laminin lines as compared to the unpatterned plastic. When patterns were made from BSA the neurites preferred to grow in between the lines on the unpatterned plastic surface. We conclude that microdispensing can be used for guidance of sensory neurites. The advantages of microdispensing is that it is fast, flexible, allows deposition of different protein concentrations and enables patterning on delicate surfaces due to its non-contact mode of operation. It is conceivable that microdispensing can be utilized for the creation of protein patterns for guiding neurites to obtain in vitro neural networks, in tissue engineering or rapid screening for guiding proteins.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2006-11-18", "authors": ["PerGustavsson", "FredrikJohansson", "MartinKanje", "LarsWallman", "Cecilia ErikssonLinsmeier"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.028"}

The model provides the droplet size, the solute concentration, the droplet velocity, and the shear stress of the droplet at impact as a function of the distance between the nozzle and the substrate. With some additional experimental information such as the size change of the film with spray distance and the viscosity of the solution, the growth rate of the film and the shear rate of the droplet at impact can be determined. Growth rate is shown to define distinct regimes of film formation. In those regimes, only a single factor or a limited number of factors controls the film morphology. The most important factors include the shear rate and the surface energy. It is found that at a specific range of growth rates only the shear rate determines the morphology of the polymer film. Growth rate, as the defining quantity of film morphology, is not limited to polymer solutions.

Good initial stability is crucial to avoid stem loosening and bone cracking, therefore, the surgeon must achieve optimal press-fitting. A possible approach to solve this problem and assist the surgeon in achieving the optimal compromise, involves the use of vibration analysis. The present study aimed to design and test a prototype device able to evaluate the primary mechanical stability of a cementless prosthesis, based on vibration analysis. In particular, the goal was to discriminate between stable and quasi-stable implants; thus the stem-bone system was assumed to be linear in both cases. For that reason, it was decided to study the frequency responses of the system, instead of the harmonic distortion. The prototype developed consists of a piezoelectric exciter connected to the stem and an accelerometer attached to the femur. Preliminary tests were performed on four composite femurs implanted with a conventional stem. The results showed that the input signal was repeatable and the output could be recorded accurately.

PZT and CF tip positions, as well as sarcomere length (SL), are simultaneously monitored in real time, and passive/active forces are calculated from CF bending. Cell force and length were dynamically adjusted by corresponding changes in PZT position, to achieve isometric, isotonic, or work-loop style contractions. Functionality of the technique was assessed by studying FL behavior of guinea pig intact cardiomyocytes. End-diastolic and end-systolic FL relations, obtained with varying preload and/or afterloads, were near linear, independent of the mode of contraction, and overlapping for the range of end-diastolic SLs tested (1.85-2.05 micro m). Instantaneous elastance curves, obtained from FL relation curves, showed an afterload-dependent decrease in time to peak elastance and slowed relaxation with both increased preload and afterload.

The constraining layer of the ACLD treatment is considered to be made of a piezoelectric, fiber-reinforced composite (PFRC) material with enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient that quantifies the in-plane actuating force due to the electric field applied across the thickness of the layer. The Young's modulus and the mass density of the FG plates are assumed to vary exponentially along the thickness of the plate, and the Poisson's ratio is assumed to be constant over the domain of the plate. A finite-element model has been developed to model the open-loop and closed-loop dynamics of the FG plates integrated with two patches of ACLD treatment. The frequency response of the plates revealed that the active patches of ACLD treatment significantly improve the damping characteristics of the FG plates over the passive damping. Emphasis has been placed on investigating the effect of variation of piezoelectric fiber angle in the constraining layer of the ACLD treatment on the attenuating capability of the patches. The analysis also revealed that the activated patches of the ACLD treatment are more effective in controlling the vibrations of FG plates when the patches are attached to the surface of the FG plates with minimum stiffness than when they are attached to the surface of the same with maximum stiffness.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2006-11-10", "authors": ["Manas CRay"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2006.155"}

Then bond it onto a semi-infinite mm2 piezoelectric substrate. For a X- or Y-cut of the substrate, a Love wave can propagate in the resulting structure and the corresponding dispersion equation is derived analytically. It turns out that when the upper (free) face of the layer is metalized, a fully explicit treatment can also be conducted in the case of a Y-cut rotated about Z. In the case of a germanium layer over a potassium niobate substrate, the wave exists at any wavelength for X-and Y-cuts but this ceases to be the case for rotated cuts, with the appearance of forbidden ranges. By playing on the cut angle, the Love wave can be made to travel faster than, or slower than, or at the same speed as, the shear bulk wave of the layer. A by-product of the analysis is the derivation of the explicit secular equation for the Bleustein-Gulyaev wave in the substrate alone, which corresponds to an asymptotic behavior of the Love wave.

Many biophysical factors such as number of daily loading cycles, bone strain, strain-induced interstitial fluid flow, molecular transport, and modulation of intramedullary pressure have been considered as potential mediators in mechanotransduction of bone. Using a knee loading modality that enhances anabolic responses in mouse hindlimb, we addressed a question: Do oscillatory loads applied to the knee induce dynamic alteration of intramedullary pressure in the femoral medullary cavity? To answer this question, mechanical loads were applied to the knee with a custom-made piezoelectric loader and intramedullary pressure in the femoral medullary cavity was measured with a fiber optic pressure sensor. We observed that in response to sinusoidal forces of 0.5 Hz and 10 Hz, pressure amplitude increased up to 4-N loads and reached a plateau at 130 Pa. This amplitude significantly decreased with a loading frequency above 20 Hz. To confirm alteration of intramedullary pressure, real-time motion of microparticles in a glass tube inserted to the femoral medullary cavity ex vivo was visualized. Taken together, these data reveal that knee loading dynamically alters intramedullary pressure as a function of loading intensities and frequencies.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2006-10-31", "authors": ["PingZhang", "MinSu", "YunlongLiu", "AndrewHsu", "HirokiYokota"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2006.09.018"}

This approach utilizes the fact that the components of such tensors are usually given in field-free principal axes as power series in the field strength, neglecting terms beyond a chosen power of the field. It is shown that for a biaxial or uniaxial medium, the finite number of iterations, which guarantees exact reduction of all the initial terms up to the required power in the series expansions of all off-diagonal elements, can always be found. Moreover, a fixed sequence of rotations in the Jacobi algorithm can be predicted. These findings allow one to derive analytical formulas in noniterative form for a given highest order of the effects being considered and also to optimize numerical iterative diagonalization procedures. Formulas for eigenvalues and eigenvectors applicable to biaxial and uniaxial mediums perturbed by the linear and quadratic effects are presented.

The quartz is excited by a voltage pulse applied on the electrodes, and its surface is scanned by a laser vibrometer that measures the out-of-plane displacements. The classical theory of bending of thin disks is used to describe the flexural modes at frequencies lower than the first thickness shear resonance (6 MHz). A fairly good agreement is found between experimental and theoretical results for the forced mode shapes and for the resonance frequencies. However, it appears that the two springs used to maintain the disk in position introduce extra clamping conditions. Several source shapes were studied, among which a collection of an arbitrary number of forces is particularly useful. The two-dimensional wavenumber representation shows the presence of anisotropy related to the crystallographic axes at higher frequencies, which is not predicted by the model.

{"title": "Trajectory tracking of piezoelectric positioning stages using a dynamic sliding-mode control.", "abstract": "Trajectory tracking performance of a piezoelectric positioning stage almost depends on whether the tracking controller can effectively compensate the inherent hysteresis phenomenon. In this paper, a dynamic sliding-mode control (DSMC) with backstepping is proposed for the trajectory tracking of the piezoelectric positioning stage, which is suitable for a component of scanning microscopes. An equivalent model developed from a linear motion dynamics with addition of the hysteresis nonlinearity and strain-dependent function first is proposed to approximately represent the dynamics of motion of a one-dimensional piezoelectric positioning stage. Then, based on the equivalent model, the DSMC with an asymptotical sliding surface is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of the piezoelectric positioning stage. Moreover, the analysis of stability can be completed by mathematics, and the convergence rate of the tracking error can be governed by the choice of the control parameter values. Using the DSMC to trajectory tracking control, the piezoelectric positioning stage becomes more suitable for practical applications, especially with the need of various trajectories tracking in microscopy. To validate the proposed control scheme, a computer-based controller and a piezoelectric positioning stage with a capacitive displacement sensor are implemented.

We have recently shown that pharmacologic activation of a neuronal subpopulation within the PPT, induced by micropipette injection of glutamate in nanoliter volumes, can produce respiratory rhythm disturbances and changes in genioglossus muscle activity in anesthetized rats. The aim of this study was to determine whether the respiratory pattern disturbance and increased genioglossus muscle tone induced by glutamate injection within the PPT are mediated by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors within the PPT. Experiments were performed in eight adult male spontaneously breathing Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized using nembutal. Respiratory movements were monitored by piezoelectric strain gauge. Three-barrel glass pipettes were used to pressure inject glutamate (as a probe for respiratory modulating sites), ketamine (an NMDA channel blocker), and oil-red dye (to aid in histological verification of the injection sites) within the PPT. Electroencephalograms were recorded from the sensorimotor cortex, the hippocampus, and the pons, contralateral to the injection site. Electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the genioglossus muscle. The typical response to glutamate injection within the PPT respiratory-modulating region was immediate apnea followed by tachypnea and increased genioglossal tonic activity. The noncompetitive NMDA receptor channel-antagonist ketamine, injected at the same site and in the same volume as glutamate (5 nl), blocked respiratory dysrhythmia and genioglossal EMG responses to subsequent glutamate injections. For the first time, the present results suggest that respiratory rhythm and upper airway muscle tone are controlled by the activation of pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus NMDA receptors.", "journal": "Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung", "date": "2006-10-13", "authors": ["JasnaSaponjic", "MiodragRadulovacki", "David WCarley"], "doi": "10.1007/s11325-006-0075-9"}

We tested the hypothesis that our sine wave model and phase angle analysis of regional dyssynchrony in a canine model could also assess dyssynchrony of contraction during regional ischemia. Hence we compared intracoronary esmolol and matched regional ischemia in 10 anesthetized open-chest dogs. Regional and total LV volumes (conductance catheter), piezoelectric crystal shortening, and LV pressures were measured before, during, and after esmolol-induced apical dyskinesis and matched regional ischemia. We defined regional phase angle of contraction (alpha) as the relative distance, measured in degrees, that regional minimal volume differed from global end-systole. We also compared maximal stroke volume (SV), observed effective SV (that portion of regional SV contributing to total SV for each treatment), and calculated effective SV (total regional SV x cosine alpha). Dobutamine infusion increased homogeneity of regional alpha relative to baseline. Both esmolol and ischemia significantly delayed (P < 0.05) apical contraction as quantified by increased alpha (12.4 degrees +/- 28.1 degrees to 27.4 degrees +/- 30.4 degrees and 54.2 degrees +/- 32.6 degrees , respectively) (mean +/- sd) and decreased regional effective SV (4.7 +/- 2.5 mL to 3.6 +/- 2.2 mL and 4 +/- 2.5 mL, respectively) relative to baseline.

A capture probe was designed with the potential point mutation site located at the 3' end and a thiol group at the 5' end to be immobilized on the gold electrode surface of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Successive hybridization with the target DNA and detection probe of nano-Au-labeled DNA forms a double-strand DNA (dsDNA). After the DNA ligase reaction and denaturing at an elevated temperature, the QCM frequency would revert to the original value for the target with single-base mismatch, whereas a reduced frequency response would be obtained for the case of the perfect match target. In this way, the purpose of point mutation discrimination could be achieved. The current approach is demonstrated with the identification of a single-base mutation in artificial codon CD17 of the beta-thalassemia gene, and the wild type and mutant type were discriminated successfully. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image showing that plenty of gold nanoparticles remained on the electrode surface demonstrated that the nano-Au label served as an efficient signal amplification agent in QCM assay.

Used for the experimental investigation of surface wave propagation along a 2D surface, laser ultrasonic leads to three dimensional (3D) space-time signal collections. The classical high resolution signal processing methods or 3D Fourier Transforms can be used in order to extract the wave propagation information, however these methods are not adapted for identifying where and when the waves are generated. In order to quantify these transient aspects in the space-time-wave number-frequency domains, the 3D Gabor transform is introduced. The 3D Gabor transform properties are presented. The potential of the 3D Gabor for the identification of the local and transient complex wave numbers is illustrated on the propagation of surface waves on a piezoelectric quartz (AT cut, 6 MHz). In this experimental study, the quartz is excited by a voltage pulse and the quartz surface is scanned by a laser vibrometer. The 3D Gabor analysis shows that the circular electrodes borders generate anti-phase surface waves that propagates outside the electrodes, with a strong energy contribution in the low frequency domain (<1 MHz). The transient analysis also points out, for higher frequencies, where the surface waves are generated and how they propagate with respect of both to the geometry of the electrodes and the crystallographic axis of the quartz.

{"title": "Knee loading stimulates cortical bone formation in murine femurs.", "abstract": "Bone alters its architecture and mass in response to the mechanical environment, and thus varying loading modalities have been examined for studying load-driven bone formation. The current study aimed to evaluate the anabolic effects of knee loading on diaphyseal cortical bone in the femur.\nUsing a custom-made piezoelectric loader, 0.5-N loads were laterally applied to the left knee of C57/BL/6 mice at 5, 10, 15, and 20 Hz for 3 minutes per day for 3 consecutive days. Animals were sacrificed for examination 13 days after the last loading. The contralateral femur was used as a non-loading control, and the statistical significance of loading effects was evaluated with p < 0.05.\nAlthough diaphyseal strains were measured as small as 12 mustrains, bone histomorphometry clearly demonstrated frequency-dependent enhancement of bone formation. Compared to a non-loading control, bone formation on the periosteal surface was significantly enhanced. The loading at 15 Hz was most effective in elevating the mineralizing surface (1.7 x; p < 0.05), mineral apposition rate (1.4 x; p < 0.001), and bone formation rate (2.4 x; p < 0.01). The loading at 10 Hz elevated the mineralizing surface (1.4 x; p < 0.05), mineral apposition rate (1.3 x; p < 0.01), and bone formation rate (1.8 x; p < 0.05). The cross-sectional cortical area and the cortical thickness in the femoral diaphysis were significantly increased by loading at 10 Hz (both 9%) and 15 Hz (12% and 13%, respectively).\nThe results support the anabolic effects of knee loading on diaphyseal cortical bone in the femur with small in situ strain, and they extend our knowledge on the interplay between bone and joints. Strengthening the femur contributes to preventing femoral fractures, and the discovery about the described knee loading might provide a novel strategy to strengthen osteoporotic bones. Further analyses are required to understand the biophysical and molecular mechanism behind knee loading.", "journal": "BMC musculoskeletal disorders", "date": "2006-09-21", "authors": ["PingZhang", "MinSu", "Shigeo MTanaka", "HirokiYokota"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2474-7-73\n10.1016/0002-9343(93)90379-4\n10.1016/S1359-6446(01)01872-4\n10.1016/j.bone.2003.11.022\n10.1016/S0021-9290(03)00127-1\n10.1114/1.1483863\n10.1007/s002239900566\n10.1007/s00774-005-0603-x\n10.2187/bss.18.41\n10.1016/j.bone.2003.11.011\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00997.2005\n10.1359/JBMR.050806\n10.1359/jbmr.2001.16.12.2291\n10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00871-2\n10.1007/BF02406130\n10.1007/s007760070029\n10.1016/S8756-3282(98)00165-3\n10.1016/S8756-3282(98)00118-5\n10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.10.1737\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00038.2006\n10.1016/0021-9290(90)90048-8\n10.1016/S0021-9290(99)00143-8\n10.1073/pnas.0505193102\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2004.04.012\n10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.3.493\n10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.9.1613\n10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00842-6\n10.1038/35088122\n10.1359/JBMR.0301251\n10.1016/S0945-053X(02)00003-3\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00123.x\n10.2187/bss.19.245"}

Two cell lines, rat epithelial cells (WB F344) and lung melanoma cells (B16F10) were used. The cells were adhered and grown on the gold surface of the sensor pre-coated with adsorbed layer of extracellular matrix proteins as vitronectin and laminin. The process of cell attachment and spreading on the gold surface was continuously monitored and displayed by changes of the resonant frequency Deltaf and resistance DeltaR values of the piezoelectric resonators. The initial phase of cell attachment and spreading induced a decrease of frequency and increase of resistance relating viscoelastic properties of the cell monolayer on the sensing surface. The steady-state of both shifts was achieved after a few hours. The presence and state of cells on the surface was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy. The obtained results demonstrate that the piezoelectric sensor is suitable for studies of the cell adhesion processes.

In [section sign] 1, we briefly discuss the lyotropic phase behaviour of lipids, focusing attention on non-lamellar structures, and their geometric/topological relationship to fusion processes in lipid membranes. Possible pathways for transitions between different cubic phases are also outlined. In [section sign] 2, we discuss the effects of hydrostatic pressure on lipid membranes and lipid phase transitions, and describe how the parameters required to predict the pressure dependence of lipid phase transition temperatures can be conveniently measured. We review some earlier results of inverse bicontinuous cubic phases from our laboratory, showing effects such as pressure-induced formation and swelling. In [section sign] 3, we describe the technique of pressure-jump synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We present results that have been obtained from the lipid system 1:2 dilauroylphosphatidylcholine/lauric acid for cubic-inverse hexagonal, cubic-cubic and lamellar-cubic transitions. The rate of transition was found to increase with the amplitude of the pressure-jump and with increasing temperature. Evidence for intermediate structures occurring transiently during the transitions was also obtained. In [section sign] 4, we describe an IDL-based 'AXcess' software package being developed in our laboratory to permit batch processing and analysis of the large X-ray datasets produced by pressure-jump synchrotron experiments. In [section sign] 5, we present some recent results on the fluid lamellar-Pn3m cubic phase transition of the single-chain lipid 1-monoelaidin, which we have studied both by pressure-jump and temperature-jump X-ray diffraction. Finally, in [section sign] 6, we give a few indicators of future directions of this research. We anticipate that the most useful technical advance will be the development of pressure-jump apparatus on the microsecond time-scale, which will involve the use of a stack of piezoelectric pressure actuators. The pressure-jump technique is not restricted to lipid phase transitions, but can be used to study a wide range of soft matter transitions, ranging from protein unfolding and DNA unwinding and transitions, to phase transitions in thermotropic liquid crystals, surfactants and block copolymers.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions.

{"title": "Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: dynamic strain evaluation of the graft.", "abstract": "The study is focused on the biomechanical aspects of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction procedures with an emphasis on evaluating the dynamic strain of materials commonly used for this purpose. Separate and multiple, equally tensioned strands of hamstring grafts used for the reconstruction of the ACL were biomechanically tested and compared to original ACL and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts, using tissue samples from cadavers. The study was focused on measuring such material properties as the strength, stiffness, maximum load, and elongation at maximum load of the original ACL, BPTB graft, and single tendon hamstring (gracilis and semitendinosus) grafts, continued by double strands and finally by four-strand graft (STG) evaluation. Fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used, which had been clamped and tensioned equally. The measurement was performed by drop-weight testing, using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer as a basic sensor of the dynamic movements of the gripping clamps, with parallel correlation by a piezoelectric transducer. The grafts for experiments were obtained from 21-paired knees. The measurement was performed at room temperature (21 degrees C) after 24 h of thawing at 4 degrees C. All the specimens were measured for their response to the dynamic tensile load. The maximum strength values were obtained and calculated for the appropriate section area of the specimen. The tensioned strands of the original ACL showed a maximum average load of 1,246 +/- 243 N in the section area of about 30 mm(2) (max. stress 41.3 MPa); the strands of BPTB grafts showed values of 3,855 +/- 550 N in the section area of 80 mm(2) (max. stress 40.6 MPa); the gracilis tendons showed 925 +/- 127 N in the section area of 10 mm(2) (max. stress 95.1 MPa) and the semitendinosuss yielded a result of 2,050 +/- 159 N in the area of 20 mm(2) (max. stress 88.7 MPa). Of all the materials, the original ACL have the lowest strength and stiffness in respect of their biomechanical properties. BPTB grafts showed a slightly higher value of maximum stress, while both the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons showed double the value of maximum load per section area-tensile stress. Two- and four- combined hamstring strands clamped together and equally tensioned with a drop-weight had the combined tensile strength properties of the individual strands within the estimated range of measurement errors. No significant changes in maximum loads/stresses were observed under impact loading conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that equally tensioned four-strand hamstring-tendon grafts have higher initial tensile properties than those in other varieties of samples. From a biomechanical point of view, they seem to be a reasonable alternative procedure for ACL reconstruction.", "journal": "Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA", "date": "2006-09-15", "authors": ["MilanHandl", "MilanDrz\u00edk", "GiulianoCerulli", "CtiborPov\u00fdsil", "JurajChlp\u00edk", "FerdinandVarga", "EvzenAmler", "Tom\u00e1sTrc"], "doi": "10.1007/s00167-006-0175-x"}

The actual Pt|Nafion area of contact was determined by coulometric analysis of the characteristic voltammetric features of Pt, using the tip as the working electrode and a much larger Pt gauze attached to the other side of the Nafion as a counter-reference electrode, yielding for some of the interfaces examined values equivalent to as low as 35 000 Pt surface atoms. This rather versatile arrangement allows experiments to be performed in both inert (Ar) and reactive atmospheres, such as oxygen or hydrogen on either or both sides of the membrane, under controlled humidity conditions, and thus sheds light into such phenomena as changes in the overall faradaic currents induced by plastic deformations of the Nafion as well as fundamental aspects of mass transport at reactant gas|Pt|Nafion three-boundary interfaces of relevance to polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs).", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

The aim of this study was to examine whether an activity monitor could be used to detect elevated interexercise (i.e. 'resting') activity in atopic dogs compared to healthy dogs. Five healthy dogs and six dogs with atopic dermatitis were fitted with a collar-mounted activity monitor (Actiwatch) that recorded the piezo-electric voltage generated over 15-s epochs for 7 days.

{"title": "Low coherence interferometry of the cochlear partition.", "abstract": "Interferometric measurement of the vibration of the organ of Corti in the isolated guinea pig cochlea was conducted using low-coherence light (1310+/-47 nm wavelength) from a superluminescent diode. The short coherence length of the light source localized measurements along the axial direction to within a approximately 10-microm window (in tissue), even when using a low numerical-aperture lens. The ability to accomplish this is important because measurement of the vibration of the basal-turn organ of Corti is generally done via a small hole in the bone of the cochlea, which effectively limits the numerical aperture. The axial localization, combined with the inherent sensitivity of the method, allowed distinct measurements of the basilar membrane (BM) and the putative reticular lamina (RL) vibration using only the native tissue reflectance, that is without requiring the use of reflective particles. The system was first operated in a scanning mode as an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system to yield an image of the organ of Corti. The reflectance of intensity from the BM and RL was 8x10(-5) and 8x10(-6), respectively. The internal structure between the BM and RL presented a variable reflectivity of about 10(-7). A mirror would define a reflectance of 1.00. Then the instrument was operated as a homodyne interferometer to measure the displacement of either the BM or RL. Vibration at 16 kHz was induced by a piezoelectric actuator, causing whole movement of a dissected cochlea. After calibration of the system, we demonstrated clear measurement of mechanically driven vibration for both the BM and RL of 0.30 nm above a noise floor equivalent to 0.03 nm.

The newly developed blocker of the transient outward current (I(to)) and ultrarapid delayed rectifier current (I(Kur)) AVE0118 prolongs atrial action potential duration and might therefore enhance atrial contractility. We compared the ability of AVE0118 to restore atrial contraction after cardioversion of AF with the efficacy of conventional positive inotropic compounds in the goat model of AF.\nEighteen goats were chronically instrumented with epicardial electrodes, a pressure transducer in the right atrium, and piezoelectric crystals to measure right atrial diameter. Atrial contractility and refractoriness and QT duration were measured before and after 1 week (3 to 8 days) of AF induced by repetitive burst pacing. The measurements were repeated after administration of digoxin (0.02 mg/kg), dobutamine (5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)), the Ca2+ sensitizer EMD57033 (1 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)), the L-type Ca2+ channel agonist BayY5959 (0.1 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)), and AVE0118 (0.01 to 0.2 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)). The effect of AVE0118 on the configuration of atrial monophasic action potentials was determined for comparison. After 1 week of AF, atrial contractility during sinus rhythm or slow atrial pacing was reduced to <10%. Digoxin and dobutamine failed to increase atrial contractility. EMD57033 restored 41% and BayY5959 restored 48% of atrial contractility at baseline. BayY5959 significantly prolonged QT duration by 24.7%.

{"title": "Effective prevention of microbial biofilm formation on medical devices by low-energy surface acoustic waves.", "abstract": "Low-energy surface acoustic waves generated from electrically activated piezo elements are shown to effectively prevent microbial biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices. The development of biofilms by four different bacteria and Candida species is prevented when such elastic waves with amplitudes in the nanometer range are applied. Acoustic-wave-activated Foley catheters have all their surfaces vibrating with longitudinal and transversal dispersion vectors homogeneously surrounding the catheter surfaces. The acoustic waves at the surface are repulsive to bacteria and interfere with the docking and attachment of planktonic microorganisms to solid surfaces that constitute the initial phases of microbial biofilm development. FimH-mediated adhesion of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to guinea pig erythrocytes was prevented at power densities below thresholds that activate bacterial force sensor mechanisms. Elevated power densities dramatically enhanced red blood cell aggregation. We inserted Foley urinary catheters attached with elastic-wave-generating actuators into the urinary tracts of male rabbits. The treatment with the elastic acoustic waves maintained urine sterility for up to 9 days compared to 2 days in control catheterized animals. Scanning electron microscopy and bioburden analyses revealed diminished biofilm development on these catheters. The ability to prevent biofilm formation on indwelling devices and catheters can benefit the implanted medical device industry.", "journal": "Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy", "date": "2006-08-31", "authors": ["ZadikHazan", "JonaZumeris", "HaroldJacob", "HananRaskin", "GeraKratysh", "MosheVishnia", "NaamaDror", "TildaBarliya", "MathildaMandel", "GadLavie"], "doi": "10.1128/AAC.00418-06"}

Some prostate tumours are stiffer than the surrounding normal tissue, and it could therefore be of interest to measure prostate tissue stiffness. Resonance sensor technology based on piezoelectric resonance detects variations in tissue stiffness due to a change in the resonance frequency. An impression-controlled resonance sensor system was used to detect stiffness in silicone rubber and in human prostate tissue in vitro using two parameters, both combinations of frequency change and force. Variations in silicone rubber stiffness due to the mixing ratio of the two components could be detected (p<0.05) using both parameters. Measurements on prostate tissue showed that there existed a statistically significant (MANOVA test, p<0.001) reproducible difference between tumour tissue (n=13) and normal healthy tissue (n=98) when studying a multivariate parameter set. Both the tumour tissue and normal tissue groups had variations within them, which were assumed to be related to differences in tissue composition. Other sources of error could be uneven surfaces and different levels of dehydration for the prostates. Our results indicated that the resonance sensor could be used to detect stiffness variations in silicone and in human prostate tissue in vitro.

The ultrasound transmission imaging system used, the AcoustoCam (Imperium Inc., MD) allows ultrasonic images to be captured using principles similar to that of a CCD-type camera that collects light. Ultrasound energy is focused onto a piezoelectric array by an acoustic lens system, creating a gray scale acoustic image. In this work, the pixel values from the acoustic images were assigned acoustic attenuation values by imaging polyacrylamide phantoms of varying known attenuation. After the calibration procedure, data from heated polyacrylamide/bovine serum albumin (BSA) based tissue-mimicking (TM) phantoms and porcine livers were acquired. Samples were heated in water at temperatures of 35, 45, 55, 65, and 75 degrees C for 1 h. Regions of interest were chosen in the images and acoustic attenuation values before and after heating were compared. An increase in ultrasound attenuation was found in phantoms containing BSA and in porcine liver. In the presence of BSA, attenuation in the TM phantom increased by a factor of 1.5, while without BSA no significant changes were observed. The attenuation of the porcine liver increased by up to a factor of 2.4, consistent with previously reported studies.

However, no PZT system has been reported for simultaneous and continuous monitoring of HR and BR, possibly due to difficulties in eliminating noises and errors caused by the amplitude fluctuation of heart sounds and breathing movements. These difficulties were overcome by custom-designed analogue circuitry and a microprocessor program, resulting in detection of HR and BR with a high reliability compared to the values obtained from ECG and a conventional airflow sensor.

A local Lamb wave approach is used to describe the generation of such modes, and the validity of this theory is investigated over the entire volume fraction range. It is shown that, when the parasitic mode is primarily generated by Lamb wave activity in the passive phase, both active materials demonstrate similar behavior. However, at higher volume fractions, the first order mode is related to the lateral resonance of the active material, and quite different behavior may be observed between the two sets of devices. The phase velocity of the parasitic modes in each device configuration was investigated by a combination of experimental measurement on a number of transducers along with simulations using the finite-element code PZFlex.

A technology for harvesting electricity from the environment.", "abstract": "This paper presents the experimental observation of piezoelectric generation from a single ZnO wire/belt for illustrating a fundamental process of converting mechanical energy into electricity at nanoscale. By deflecting a wire/belt using a conductive atomic force microscope tip in contact mode, the energy is first created by the deflection force and stored by piezoelectric potential, and later converts into piezoelectric energy. The mechanism of the generator is a result of coupled semiconducting and piezoelectric properties of ZnO. A piezoelectric effect is required to create electric potential of ionic charges from elastic deformation; semiconducting property is necessary to separate and maintain the charges and then release the potential via the rectifying behavior of the Schottky barrier at the metal-ZnO interface, which serves as a switch in the entire process. The good conductivity of ZnO is rather unique because it makes the current flow possible. This paper demonstrates a principle for harvesting energy from the environment. The technology has the potential of converting mechanical movement energy (such as body movement, muscle stretching, blood pressure), vibration energy (such as acoustic/ultrasonic wave), and hydraulic energy (such as flow of body fluid, blood flow, contraction of blood vessels) into electric energy that may be sufficient for self-powering nanodevices and nanosystems in applications such as in situ, real-time, and implantable biosensing, biomedical monitoring, and biodetection.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2006-08-10", "authors": ["JinhuiSong", "JunZhou", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1021/nl060820v"}

In this field, electromagnetic transformers may be replaced with significant benefit by piezoelectric transformers (PT). In a PT, the input electrical energy is transferred to the output by an acoustical means, using the direct and converse effects of piezoelectric materials. Its main advantages over an electromagnetic transformer are no magnetic noise generation, small size, high power density, and high efficiency. This paper deals with an innovative technique that produces a significant improvement of the power capability of piezoelectric transformers. This technique is based on a particular output voltage processing of the PT. Its effect is a vibration level reduction of the PT structure while keeping the output power practically constant. Vibration level is a critical parameter that determines the maximum power capability of a given PT. Thus, the new processing reduces significantly the losses of the PT.

This system enabled ultrasound fields to be mapped over an aperture of 40 mm, in 50-microm steps with an optically defined element size of 50 microm and an acquisition time of 50 ms per step. The sensor comprised a 38-microm polymer film FPI which was directly vacuum-deposited onto an impedance-matched polycarbonate backing stub.

Mixture effects of polymer-polymer interactions are incorporated into the diffusion coefficient. The melting temperature, activation energy of diffusion, and phase transition enthalpy also depend on the blending fraction and lead to characteristic kinetic behavior of crystallization. The influence of different blending fractions is presented through the time dependence of polymer concentration, number and size of crystals, and crystallinity (in Avrami plots). Computational results indicate how overall crystallization kinetics can be expressed approximately by the Avrami equation. The nucleation rate decreases as the blending fraction of the second polymer component increases. The investigation suggests that blending influences crystal growth rate mainly through the deposition-rate driving force and growth-rate coefficient.

Its lattice constants are a = 0.808 73 nm and c = 0.497 98 nm. The primitive cell of the CNGS crystal contains only one formula unit (23 atoms). The vibration modes were measured with Raman spectroscopy technique, assigned with ab initio molecular orbit calculation method. In order to model the crystal, two clusters Ca3NbGa2SiO12 and Ca3NbGaSi2O12 were designed, and calculations were carried out on them. Their configurations were optimized, and the vibration frequencies were calculated with UHF method. By investigating the force constants and activities of the assigned Raman spectra, the structure of CNGS crystal was analyzed, and its layer structure and piezoelectric properties were confirmed.

{"title": "A KLM-circuit model of a multi-layer transducer for acoustic bladder volume measurements.", "abstract": "In a preceding study a new technique to non-invasively measure the bladder volume on the basis of non-linear wave propagation was validated. It was shown that the harmonic level generated at the posterior bladder wall increases for larger bladder volumes. A dedicated transducer is needed to further verify and implement this approach. This transducer must be capable of both transmission of high-pressure waves at fundamental frequency and reception of up to the third harmonic. For this purpose, a multi-layer transducer was constructed using a single element PZT transducer for transmission and a PVDF top-layer for reception. To determine feasibility of the multi-layer concept for bladder volume measurements, and to ensure optimal performance, an equivalent mathematical model on the basis of KLM-circuit modeling was generated. This model was obtained in two subsequent steps. Firstly, the PZT transducer was modeled without PVDF-layer attached by means of matching the model with the measured electrical input impedance. It was validated using pulse-echo measurements. Secondly, the model was extended with the PVDF-layer. The total model was validated by considering the PVDF-layer as a hydrophone on the PZT transducer surface and comparing the measured and simulated PVDF responses on a wave transmitted by the PZT transducer. The obtained results indicated that a valid model for the multi-layer transducer was constructed. The model showed feasibility of the multi-layer concept for bladder volume measurements. It also allowed for further optimization with respect to electrical matching and transmit waveform. Additionally, the model demonstrated the effect of mechanical loading of the PVDF-layer on the PZT transducer.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2006-08-01", "authors": ["E J WMerks", "J M GBorsboom", "NBom", "A F Wvan der Steen", "Nde Jong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2006.05.129"}
{"title": "Characterization of a factor from bovine intestine that protects against Cryptosporidium parvum infection.", "abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that causes intestinal infection in a variety of mammals. We have previously described a factor in adult rat or adult bovine intestinal mucosa that protects against C. parvum infection when fed to susceptible infant rats. This factor is absent in intestinal mucosa from bovine calves. In the present study we describe the further characterization of the active component of bovine intestinal mucosa. The ability to protect infant rats against C. parvum infection was found to be associated with the extrinsic membrane protein fraction of the intestinal mucosa. Extrinsic membrane preparations from adult cows, adult rats, and calves were separated by SDS-PAGE. A band with apparent molecular mass of 54 kDa was seen in preparations from adult rat and cow, but not calf. Protein was transferred to PVDF membrane and from this the band was excised and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis using a gas-phase protein sequenator. A 15-amino acid consensus sequence was generated with homology to leucine aminopeptidase (LAP). Purified LAP was purchased from a commercial source and tested for ability to protect infant rats against C. parvum infection. Rats fed LAP from 7 to 11 days of age and challenged with C. parvum at 9 days were significantly less infected than controls upon necropsy at 15 days of age. These data suggest that a protein with N-terminal sequence homology to LAP may reduce susceptibility of infant rats to C. parvum infection.", "journal": "Veterinary parasitology", "date": "2006-07-28", "authors": ["DhuhaAkili", "MohammadHeidari", "Lisa MWelter", "Timothy AReinhardt", "James AHarp"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.06.015"}

These components are encased in a stainless steel holder, allowing easy hand manipulation during ear surgery. The probe is activated with an electric signal at around 1,600 Hz. The system is controlled with a laptop computer, and the results are presented as the ratio of the ossicular resistance (ROR) to a reference value as a percentage. One measurement takes 10 ms. The device was applied in four selected patients during ear surgery.\nSeveral measurements in two of the cochlear implantees showed a greater difference in the RORs of the stapes (15-20% in Case 1 and 35-45% in Case 2), whereas the RORs of the malleus and incus were within the same range. This was thought to correspond to the partial cochlear calcification noted in Case 2. In Case 3, who underwent surgery because of otosclerosis, the ROR of the stapes was high, ranging from 70 to 80%. When measured for the malleus-incus fixation anomaly (Case 4), the ROR of the malleus and incus was in the range of 60 to 70%. Owing to the limited surgical view, the ROR of the stapes could not be measured. No problems related to the measurements with this device were noted.\nThe design, principles, measuring procedures, and preliminary results of our new tool for testing ossicular mobility are reported.

{"title": "Consideration of stiffness and mass effects of relatively thicker electrodes with Mindlin plate theory.", "abstract": "Mindlin plate theory has been widely used in the high-frequency vibrations of piezoelectric crystal plates with emphasis on its applications in crystal resonator analysis and design. The plate equations were derived without considering the effect of electrodes from the beginning. But continuing efforts have been made to include the mechanical effect, or the mass loading, through the consideration of the mass ratio of the electrodes and crystal blank. Such a consideration has been effective for relatively thin electrodes before, but the ever-increasing mass ratio has been pressing further improvement to take into account relatively thicker electrodes. To extend Mindlin plate equations for these applications, we derive the plate equations systematically with the approximation of displacements in electrodes with those in the crystal blank. As a result, both mass and stiffness effects of electrodes are considered through ratios of the thickness, density, and elastic constants of the electrodes to those of the crystal blank, respectively, and the plate equations are modified accordingly. A practical design of the electrodes and crystal blank are analyzed to demonstrate the necessity of such modifications to Mindlin plate equations.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2006-07-19", "authors": ["JiWang"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2006.1642521"}
{"title": "Finite-element simulation of wave propagation in periodic piezoelectric SAW structures.", "abstract": "Many surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices consist of quasiperiodic structures that are designed by successive repetition of a base cell. The precise numerical simulation of such devices, including all physical effects, is currently beyond the capacity of high-end computation. Therefore, we have to restrict the numerical analysis to the periodic substructure. By using the finite-element method (FEM), this can be done by introducing periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) at special artificial boundaries. To be able to describe the complete dispersion behavior of waves, including damping effects, the PBC has to be able to model each mode that can be excited within the periodic structure. Therefore, the condition used for the PBCs must hold for each phase and amplitude difference existing at periodic boundaries. Based on the Floquet theorem, our two newly developed PBC algorithms allow the calculation of both, the phase and the amplitude coefficients of the wave. In the first part of this paper we describe the basic theory of the PBCs. Based on the FEM, we develop two different methods that deliver the same results but have totally different numerical properties and, therefore, allow the use of problem-adapted solvers. Further on, we show how to compute the charge distribution of periodic SAW structures with the aid of the new PBCs. In the second part, we compare the measured and simulated dispersion behavior of waves propagating on periodic SAW structures for two different piezoelectric substrates. Then we compare measured and simulated input admittances of structures similar to SAW resonators.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2006-07-19", "authors": ["ManfredHofer", "NormanFinger", "G\u00fcnterKovacs", "JoachimSch\u00f6berl", "SabineZaglmayr", "UlrichLanger", "ReinhardLerch"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2006.1642518"}

{"title": "Gastrointestinal motility during cardiopulmonary bypass: a sonomicrometric study.", "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is known to impair the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known about the movement behavior of the gastrointestinal tract during CPB. This study was aimed to assess the gastrointestinal motility with sonomicrometry, a distance measurement using ultrasound, in a porcine model of CPB. Twelve pigs weighing 70-112 kg were having a standard hypothermic CPB for 120 min either with the nonpulsatile flow (n = 6) or the pulsatile flow (n = 6). Before CPB, piezoelectric echo crystals were placed either along the longitudinal or the circular axis of the pylorus. Patterns of gut movement and the total sonomicrometric activity (TSA) were recorded at several time intervals during experiments as qualitative and quantitative parameters of gut motility. Results showed that the intact regular rhythmic pattern of gut movement was detected before CPB. This pattern changed little when CPB started, but it disappeared at 60 min when the body temperature lowered down to 32 degrees Celsius. During the same period, the TSA reduced significantly along the longitudinal as well as the circular directions of the pylorus. There was no significant difference between the nonpulsatile and pulsatile groups. Gut blood flow reduced significantly in both groups, but it was not associated with the reduced sonomicrometric activity. In conclusion, gastrointestinal motility during CPB can be measured qualitatively and quantitatively by sonomicrometry in a large animal model. Suppression of gut motility during CPB does not seem to be associated with the mode of perfusion but with the reduced body temperature during the hypothermic phase of CPB.", "journal": "Artificial organs", "date": "2006-07-14", "authors": ["Y JohnGu", "Thom Lde Kroon", "Jan MElstrodt", "GerhardRakhorst"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1525-1594.2006.00257.x"}

The natural frequencies corresponding to several modes of deformation of an OHC with intracellular and extracellular fluids are calculated from this model. Our results suggest that the best frequency in the cochlea at the position where the OHC is located corresponds to different modes of deformation of the OHC, depending on the OHC length. For short OHCs, the best frequency is close to the natural frequency of the axisymmetric mode; for long OHCs, it is close to the natural frequencies of the beam-like bending and pinched modes.

{"title": "Piezoelectric transducer design via multiobjective optimization.", "abstract": "The design of piezoelectric transducers is usually based on single-objective optimization only. In most practical applications of piezoelectric transducers, however, there exist multiple design objectives that often are contradictory to each other by their very nature. It is impossible to find a solution at which each objective function gets its optimal value simultaneously. Our design approach is to first find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, which can be considered to be best compromises among multiple design objectives. Among these Pareto-optimal solutions, the designer can then select the one solution which he considers to be the best one. In this paper we investigate the optimal design of a Langevin transducer. The design problem is formulated mathematically as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem. The maximum vibration amplitude and the minimum electrical input power are considered as optimization objectives. Design variables involve continuous variables (dimensions of the transducer) and discrete variables (the number of piezoelectric rings and material types). In order to formulate the optimization problem, the behavior of piezoelectric transducers is modeled using the transfer matrix method based on analytical models. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are applied in the optimization process and a set of Pareto-optimal designs is calculated. The optimized results are analyzed and the preferred design is determined.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2006-07-04", "authors": ["BFu", "THemsel", "JWallaschek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2006.05.087"}

A low-frequency transceiver set-up, based on a high-voltage BPV Steinkamp instrument and two 50 kHz probes, has been used to measure pulse travel times by ultrasonic through-transmission testing. In complementary fashion, an Erudite MK3 test equipment with an electromagnetic vibrator and two piezoelectric sensors has also been employed to measure ultrasonic velocity by means of a resonance-based method, using the same types of granite varieties. In addition, a comprehensive set of physical/mechanical properties have also been analyzed, according to Spanish regulations in force, by means of alternative methods including destructive techniques such as strength, porosity, absorption, etc. A large number of samples, representing the most important varieties of granites from quarries of Extremadura, have been analyzed using the above-mentioned procedures. Some results obtained by destructive techniques have been correlated with those found using ultrasonic techniques.

{"title": "Model based analysis of piezoelectric transformers.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric transformers are increasingly getting popular in the electrical devices owing to several advantages such as small size, high efficiency, no electromagnetic noise and non-flammable. In addition to the conventional applications such as ballast for back light inverter in notebook computers, camera flash, and fuel ignition several new applications have emerged such as AC/DC converter, battery charger and automobile lighting. These new applications demand high power density and wide range of voltage gain. Currently, the transformer power density is limited to 40 W/cm(3) obtained at low voltage gain. The purpose of this study was to investigate a transformer design that has the potential of providing higher power density and wider range of voltage gain. The new transformer design utilizes radial mode both at the input and output port and has the unidirectional polarization in the ceramics. This design was found to provide 30 W power with an efficiency of 98% and 30 degrees C temperature rise from the room temperature.

The model was found to successfully predict the characteristics of the transformer. Excellent matching was found between the computed and experimental results.

{"title": "Lamb waves beam deviation due to small inclination of the test structure in air-coupled ultrasonic NDT.", "abstract": "In Lamb waves inspection, an air-coupled transmitter transducer is oriented at a specific angle such that it generates a pure Lamb mode which propagates along the structure and interacts with any existing defects. For this inspection system, amplitude losses appears when small inclinations of the tested structure occurs. An important factor which affects directly these losses has been observed, it consists of the Lamb waves beam (LWB) deviation due to this bad alignment. In this work, a simple expression of LWB deviation has been deduced. This expression includes the test structure angle, phase velocity of generated Lamb mode, and the phase velocity of waves propagating in the coupled medium. A(0) Lamb mode is generated and detected in 1 mm thick aluminium plate sample using 1 MHz PZ27 piezoelectric transducers of 20 mm of diameter. Experimental LWB deviation angles are measured for different inclination angles of the test sample. A comparative study is released with theoretical results. For 1 degree of misalignment in the aluminium plate inclination, and transducers separation distance of 35 mm, LWB deviation angle is around 7 degrees and the amplitude is reduced by around 11%. Then, for a large separation distance, we must move the receiver transducer to detect the deviated LWB. It is shown that, for both theoretical and experimental studies, the LWB deviation and its measured amplitude are very sensitive to the alignment of the tested structure with respect to the transmitter-receiver transducers plane.

Experiments have been carried out on membranes prepared by non-solvent-induced phase inversion method, using PVDF-co-hexafluoropropylene (Kynarflex 2800) and PVDF homopolymer (Kinar 460), and adding LiCl and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) in order to modulate the pore structure. From a theoretical point of view, the free Gibbs energy balance for the formation of a critical nucleus has been adapted to nonporous surfaces, thus obtaining a mathematical correlation between the energy nucleation barrier, the membrane porosity, and the contact angle between protein solution and polymeric substrate. The energetic barrier to heterogeneous nucleation was found to increase at higher contact angles-according to the prediction of classical theory-and to decrease at higher porosity. For instance, the predicted deltaG(het)/deltaG(hom) ratio for PVDF-Kynarflex (PVP 2.5%) membrane with porosity of 0.11 was 0.30, 35% lower with respect to the value calculated by the Volmer equation for a dense polymeric matrix having the same contact angle (87.4 +/- 5.8 degrees). In addition, the effect of the membrane pore size, porosity, and thickness on the removal rate of solvent have been discussed. For example, the transmembrane flux through PVDF-Kynar (LiCl 5.0%) membrane was 12% inferior than the one measured under the same experimental conditions through PVDF-Kynarflex (LiCl 7.5%) membrane, the latter having similar pore size and thickness but higher porosity (0.44 vs 0.32).

The plasmon band transition is monitored with time in the reaction mixture for three sets of experiments by UV-vis spectroscopy. The plasmon band absorbance increases sigmoidally with log(time). Analysis of the data with the Avrami equation yields an exponent n value between 1.5 and 2.0, indicating two-dimensional nucleation with linear or diffusion controlled growth.

The WAXS and FTIR studies indicate the formation of piezoelectric beta-polymorphic PVF2 in the nanocomposites. The DSC study indicates some increase of the melting point and enthalpy of fusion of PVF2 in the nanocomposite, although with increase in Ag nanoparticle concentration the increase is smaller. The crystallization temperatures of PNCs also increased, indicating nucleating effect of Ag nanoparticles in the composite. In the TGA curves, the PNCs exhibit a three-step degradation process. The degradation temperatures of PNCs are lower than that of PVF2. The storage modulus data indicate a significant reinforcement of the mechanical property in the PNCs where also the reinforcement effect decreases with increasing nanoparticle concentration. Both the loss modulus and tan delta plots indicate two peaks; the lower temperature peak has been attributed for glass transition temperature, whereas the higher one has been attributed to a similar type relaxation process for the crystalline-amorphous interface. The increase in the glass transition is marginal for the PNCs, but the increase of later transition temperature is somewhat higher.

A key issue on the development of such transducers is their efficient coupling to air media (impedance mismatch between the piezoelectric material and air is 90 dB or more). Adaptation layers are used in order to attain good matching and avoid possible serious signal degradation. However, the introduction of these matching layers modify the transducer surface behaviour and, consequently, radiation characteristics are altered, making the usual idealization criteria (of uniform surface movement) adopted for field simulation purposes inaccurate. In our system, we have a concave linear-array transducer of 64 elements (electrically coupled by pairs) working at 0.8 MHz made of PZ27 rectangular piezoceramics (15 mm x 0.3 mm) with two matching layers made of polyurethane and porous cellulose bonded on them. Experimental measurements of the acoustic aperture of single excited array elements have shown an increment on the geometrical dimensions of its active surface. A sub-millimeter vibrometer laser scan has revealed an extension of the aperture beyond the supposed physical single array element dimensions. Non-uniform symmetric apodized velocity surface vibration amplitude profile with a concave delay contour indicates the presumed existence of travelling wave phenomena over the surface of the outer array matching layer. Also, asymptotic propagation velocities around 2500 m/s and attenuation coefficient between 15 and 20 dB/mm has been determined for the travelling waves showing clear tendencies.

Waves are excited by a macro-piezoelectric plate with electrodes on the top and bottom surfaces and, as a result, waves propagate into the adjacent fluid.

When an inhomogeneity in a fluid is exposed to an ultrasonic field the acoustic radiation force results; this is found by integrating the pressure over the surface of the particle, retaining second order terms, and taking the time average. Thus, due to the presence of a pressure field in the fluid in which the particles are suspended, a force field is created. The particles are then collected at the locations of the force potential minima. In the device described here, the force field is used to position particles into lines.

This configuration not only removes the rotor in a conventional type of traveling wave ultrasonic motor but also changes the interaction between the rotor and the stator of the motor so that it improves the output performance of the motor. Although an electric brush is added to the ultrasonic motor, it is easy to be fabricated because of the low speed of motor. The finite element method was used to compute the vibration modes of an ultrasonic motor with a diameter of 100mm to optimize the design of the motor. A 9th mode was chosen as the operation mode with a resonance frequency about 25 kHz. According to the design, a prototype was fabricated. Its performance was measured.

{"title": "The giant electromechanical response in ferroelectric relaxors as a critical phenomenon.", "abstract": "The direct conversion of electrical energy to mechanical work by a material is relevant to a number of applications. This is illustrated by ferroelectric 'relaxors' such as Pb(Mg(1/3)Nb(2/3))O(3)-PbTiO(3) (PMN-PT; refs 5, 6): these materials exhibit a giant electromechanical (piezoelectric) response that is finding use in ultrasonic and medical applications, as well as in telecommunications. The origins of this effect are, however, still unclear. Here we show that the giant electromechanical response in PMN-PT (and potentially other ferroelectric relaxors) is the manifestation of critical points that define a line in the phase diagram of this system. Specifically, in the electric-field-temperature-composition phase diagram of PMN-PT (the composition being varied by changing the PT concentration), a first-order paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition terminates in a line of critical points where the piezoelectric coefficient is maximum. Above this line, supercritical evolution is observed. On approaching the critical point, both the energy cost and the electric field necessary to induce ferroelectric polarization rotations decrease significantly, thus explaining the giant electromechanical response of these relaxors.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2006-06-23", "authors": ["ZKutnjak", "JPetzelt", "RBlinc"], "doi": "10.1038/nature04854"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric linear motor concepts based on coupling of longitudinal vibrations.", "abstract": "Classically, rotary motors with gears and spindle mechanisms are used to achieve translatory motion. In means of miniaturization and weight reduction piezoelectric linear motors are of interest. Several ultrasonic linear motors found in literature base on the use of two different vibration modes. Most often flexural and longitudinal modes are combined to achieve an elliptic micro-motion of surface points. This micro-motion is converted to direct linear (or translatory) motion of a driven slider. To gain high amplitudes of the micro-motion and thus having a powerful motor, the ultrasonic vibrator should be driven near the eigenfrequency of its modes. Additionally, low mechanical and electrical losses lead to increased efficiency and large amplitude magnification in resonance. This demands a geometrical design that fits the eigenfrequencies of the two different modes. A frequency-deviation of only a few percent leads to non-acceptable disturbance of the elliptical motion. Thus, the mechanical design of the vibrators has to be done very carefully. Within this contribution we discuss different motor designs based on the coupling of two the same longitudinal vibrations within one structure to generate an elliptic motion of surface points. Different concepts based on piezoelectric plates and Langevin transducers are compared. Benefits and drawbacks against the combination of longitudinal and bending modes will be discussed.

Despite the large number of applications, generally approved principles and objective criteria for parameter settings which allow an efficient operation are non-existent. The empirical selections of the running parameters often impede an optimization in terms of produce and reproducibility. One proposal for an objective description of the processes is the characterization of the sound field in the cleaning bath, which causes cavities, and subsequently, the cleaning process. Sound field measurements in the appropriate frequency range from 20kHz up to more then 1MHz incorporate a number of problems, such as large sensors disturbing the sound field, a lack of accuracy and the risk of being destroyed by cavitation bubbles. Measurement systems based on optical fiber tips and piezo-electrical hydrophones will be presented, which fulfil the accuracy requirements and withstand ultrasound fields with high power and cavitation. The spatial distribution of sound field parameters such as positive and negative peak pressure, amplitudes of fundamentals, harmonics and sub-harmonics as well as the energy density and spectral density in several frequency ranges are determined in experiments. Finally, the determined field parameters are related to the cavitation effects by means of photometric analysis of perforated aluminium foil.

This article reviews recent developments in theoretical modeling that have increased our knowledge of the operation of this fascinating cell. The earliest models aimed at capturing experimental observations on voltage-induced cellular length changes and capacitance were based on isotropic elasticity and a two-state Boltzmann function. Recent advances in modeling based on the thermodynamics of orthotropic electroelastic materials better capture the cell's voltage-dependent stiffness, capacitance, interaction with its environment and ability to generate force at high frequencies. While complete models are crucial, simpler continuum models can be derived that retain fidelity over small changes in transmembrane voltage and strains occurring in vivo. By its function in the cochlea, the OHC behaves like a piezoelectric-like actuator, and the main cellular features can be described by piezoelectric models. However, a finer characterization of the cell's composite wall requires understanding the local mechanical and electrical fields. One of the key questions is the relative contribution of the in-plane and bending modes of electromechanical strains and forces (moments). The latter mode is associated with the flexoelectric effect in curved membranes. New data, including a novel experiment with tethers pulled from the cell membrane, can help in estimating the role of different modes of electromechanical coupling.

In HCC sera, occurrences of autoantibodies against these proteins were 7/15 (46.7%), 5/15 (33.3%), 5/15 (33.3%), and 6/15 (40.0%), respectively, whereas 2/20 (10.0%), 7/20 (35.0%), 0/20 (0.0%), and 2/20 (10.0%) were in control sera. Immunoblot analysis using commercially available purified proteins was performed to confirm the specificity of autoantibodies. By statistical analysis, autoantibodies against HSP70, peroxiredoxin, and Mn-SOD showed significantly high-frequency immunoreaction in HCC sera.

The layers are subject to opposing piezoelectric polarization and the device is assumed to be loaded by semi-infinite isotropic media at the two principal faces. Block diagram representations of the transducer acting as both a generator and a receiver of ultrasound are developed in conjunction with the equivalent model of the electrical admittance. When expressed in this manner, the underlying cause and effect relationships are identified, with the important contribution of the piezoelectric boundary highlighted. Comparisons with the conventional single-layer transducer are made throughout and the major physical differences in terms of transduction performance are discussed. The new model is compared with finite element analysis and good agreement is also demonstrated with experimental data. A key aspect of the methodology is the provision of a more intuitive understanding of such device behavior.

{"title": "Manufacturing of prestressed piezoelectric unimorphs using a postfired biasing layer.", "abstract": "A novel manufacturing method for prestressed piezoelectric unimorphs is introduced and the actuator properties are examined. Prestressed PZT 5A and PZT 5H unimorphs with piezo material thickness of 250 microm and 375 microm were manufactured by using sintering and thermal shrinkage of the prestressing material. The process was carried out by screen printing a layer of AgPd paste on one side of the sintered bulk ceramic. As an alternative method, dielectric low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) tape was used as the prestressing material. Different configurations were tested to obtain high displacements and to make a comparison between materials. After firing, the samples were poled, and the displacement versus load characteristics of the resulting actuators were investigated. A maximum displacement of 118 microm was obtained from a 250 microm thick, prestressed PZT 5H actuator with a diameter of 25 mm, in which LTCC tape was used as the prestressing layer. Similarly, the PZT 5H material provided a maximum displacement of 63 microm with a screen-printed AgPd prestressing layer. The manufacturing method described offers a novel approach for the production of a wide range of integrated active structures on, for instance, an LTCC circuit board. This is especially important because piezoelectric bulk materials with high piezoelectric coefficients can be used to produce high displacements.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2006-06-13", "authors": ["Jari AJuuti", "HeliJantunen", "Veli-PekkaMoilanen", "SeppoLepp\u00e4vuori"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2006.1632674"}

Pseudo-cubic lattice parameters have led to considerable controversy over the symmetry of the structure, which was found to be rhombohedral in the space group R3m at both temperatures. Atomic coordinates have been determined for the first time.

{"title": "Improved drug delivery properties of PVDF membranes functionalized with beta-cyclodextrin--application to guided tissue regeneration in periodontology.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a membrane for guided tissue regeneration applicable in periodontology that could release antimicrobial agent during the healing period. Our strategy consisted to graft beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), a molecule that is known to form inclusion complexes with a large variety of drugs, onto PVDF membranes. Grafting occurred by using citric acid that provoked a crosslinking reaction of beta-CD, and the resulting polymer was imprisoned into the porous structure of the PVDF membrane. The reaction produced a weight increase of the membrane, the range of which depended on the temperature and on the time of curing applied in the process. The biological behavior of the membranes evaluated by proliferation and vitality tests showed good proliferation and improved activity of L132 epithelial cells on the raw and on the grafted membranes. Doxycyclin (DOX) and chlorhexidine (CHX) were used as antimicrobial agents. Their inclusion into the beta-CD cavity in aqueous solutions was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. After the impregnation of the membranes with DOX and CHX, their release was studied in vitro in batch type experiments and measured by UV spectrophotometry. Low amounts of DOX and CHX were delivered from the raw membranes within the first few hours of tests.

The time courses of the resonant frequency and the equivalent parameters of the sensor were simultaneously obtained during BSA adsorption and TA-BSA binding. Compared with the bare gold electrode, the Au colloid-modified gold electrode showed better biocompatibility, and the absorption capacity for BSA was increased by approximately 2.4 times. The observed frequency decrease was ascribed to the mass increase of the sensor surface resulting from the TA-BSA binding, which is believed to result mainly from the hydrogen bonding from FT-IR characterization. The maximal molar binding ratio of TA binding to immobilized BSA obtained from the frequency shift of the adsorbed BSA and TA was estimated to be 10.3:1. On the basis of the frequency decrease with time, the kinetics of the binding was quantitatively studied.

{"title": "Piezo dispensed microarray of multivalent chelating thiols for dissecting complex protein-protein interactions.", "abstract": "The fabrication of a novel biochip, designed for dissection of multiprotein complex formation, is reported. An array of metal chelators has been produced by piezo dispensing of a bis-nitrilotriacetic acid (bis-NTA) thiol on evaporated gold thin films, prestructured with a microcontact printed grid of eicosanethiols. The bis-NTA thiol is mixed in various proportions with an inert, tri(ethylene glycol) hexadecane thiol, and the thickness and morphological homogeneity of the dispensed layers are characterized by imaging ellipsometry before and after back-filling with the same inert thiol and subsequent rinsing. It is found that the dispensed areas display a monotonic increase in thickness with increasing molar fraction of bis-NTA in the dispensing solution, and they are consistently a few Angstr\u00f6ms thicker than those prepared at the same molar fraction by solution self-assembly under equilibrium-like conditions. The bulkiness of the bis-NTA tail group and the short period of time available for chemisorption and in-plane organization of the dispensed thiols are most likely responsible for the observed difference in thickness. Moreover, the functional properties of this biochip are demonstrated by studying multiple protein-protein interactions using imaging surface plasmon resonance. The subunits of the type I interferon receptor are immobilized as a composition array determined by the surface concentration of bis-NTA in the array elements. Ligand dissociation kinetics depends on the receptor surface concentration, which is ascribed to the formation of a ternary complex by simultaneous interaction of the ligand with the two receptor subunits.

Nuclear transfer was performed by direct injection of donor cells, using a piezo drill, and standard activation was by injection of sperm factor followed by culture with 6-dimethylaminopurine. There was no difference in blastocyst development between embryos produced with roscovitine-treated or confluent donor cells (3.6% for either treatment). Addition of injection of roscovitine or culture with cycloheximide at the time of activation did not affect blastocyst development. Overall, transfer of eight blastocysts produced using roscovitine-treated donor cells and our standard activation protocol yielded three pregnancies, of which two (25% of transferred embryos) resulted in delivery of viable foals. Flow cytometric evaluation showed that roscovitine treatment significantly increased the proportion of cells classified as small, in comparison to growth to confluence or serum deprivation, but did not significantly affect the proportion of cells in G0/G1 (2N DNA content). Transfer of one blastocyst produced using roscovitine-treated donor cells, with addition of roscovitine injection at activation, yielded one pregnancy which was lost before 114 days' gestation. Transfer to recipients of two blastocysts produced using confluent donor cells with addition of cycloheximide at activation gave no resulting pregnancies. We conclude that roscovitine treatment of donor cells yields equivalent blastocyst production after nuclear transfer to that for confluent donor cells, and that direct injection of roscovitine-treated donor cells, followed by activation using sperm extract, is compatible with efficient production of viable cloned foals.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2006-06-01", "authors": ["KHinrichs", "Y HChoi", "C CLove", "Y GChung", "D DVarner"], "doi": "10.1530/rep.1.01095"}

To alleviate non-specific adsorption of serum proteins, modification of the quartz crystal surface by different protocols and the composition of the assay medium have been investigated. The results indicate that the background interference can be substantially minimized through modifying the quartz crystal surface with a bovine serum albumin (BSA) layer and introducing an appropriate amount of BSA in the assay medium.

However, the use of photoplethysmography (PPG) in PTT measurement can be limited in events of poor peripheral perfusion. Uninterrupted PTT monitoring may also not be achievable when less cooperative patients distribute the PPG probe due to its prominent light source. Hence, there is a need for an alternative method to measure PTT in such incidents.\nIn this study, the piezoelectric (PIEZO) technique to detect pulsations from a human wrist above the radial artery to estimate PTT is presented. 17 healthy adults (11 male; age range of 21-33 years) were recruited to compare PTT and heart rate (HR) differences between the PPG and PIEZO methods. These time-related derivations were made with respect to an electrocardiogram (ECG).\nThe timing consistency of the PIEZO transducer shows significant correlations (p < 0.01) to those derived from the ECG and a pulse oximeter. Particularly, there is a high level of agreement of < 1 beat per minute (bpm) difference in HR estimates observed when compared to the two commercial devices in the respective Bland-Altman plots. Comparison of PTT obtained from the PIEZO transducer against the PPG signal shows constantly lower values due to the shorter path length it requires to propagate. A regression equation was formulated to relate the PTT values acquired from both these signals.\nPreliminary findings herein suggest that the PIEZO technique can be useful as an alternative for PTT monitoring.

{"title": "Modelling, fabrication and characterization of a polymeric micromixer based on sequential segmentation.", "abstract": "Effective and fast mixing is important for many microfluidic applications. In many cases, mixing is limited by molecular diffusion due to constrains of the laminar flow in the microscale regime. According to scaling law, decreasing the mixing path can shorten the mixing time and enhance mixing quality. One of the techniques for reducing mixing path is sequential segmentation. This technique divides solvent and solute into segments in axial direction. The so-called Taylor-Aris dispersion can improve axial transport by three orders of magnitudes. The mixing path can be controlled by the switching frequency and the mean velocity of the flow. Mixing ratio can be controlled by pulse width modulation of the switching signal. This paper first presents a simple time-dependent one-dimensional analytical model for sequential segmentation. The model considers an arbitrary mixing ratio between solute and solvent as well as the axial Taylor-Aris dispersion. Next, a micromixer was designed and fabricated based on polymeric micromachining. The micromixer was formed by laminating four polymer layers. The layers are micro machined by a CO(2) laser. Switching of the fluid flows was realized by two piezoelectric valves. Mixing experiments were evaluated optically. The concentration profile along the mixing channel agrees qualitatively well with the analytical model. Furthermore, mixing results at different switching frequencies were investigated.

{"title": "The effect of chitosan and PVDF substrates on the behavior of embryonic rat cerebral cortical stem cells.", "abstract": "In this study, the behavior of neural stem cells from embryonic rat cerebral cortex were compared on the chitosan and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) substrates at single-cell and neurosphere level. It was found that chitosan and PVDF substrates inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of single neural stem cells. It seemed that single-cell cultures on both substrates show cells remained dormant. However, neurospheres could exhibit different or similar behavior on these two substrates, which is dependent on the presence or absence of serum. More cells migrated outside from the neurospheres and longer processes extended from differentiated cells on chitosan than on PVDF when neurospheres were cultured in the serum-free medium. On the contrary, when serum was added to the culture system, chitosan and PVDF could induce the neurosphere-forming cells into an extensive cellular substratum of protoplasmic cells upon which process-bearing cells spread. In addition, based on the immunocytochemical analysis, the percentages of differentiated cell phenotypes of neurospheres cultured on chitosan and PVDF substrates became similar in the presence of serum. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that biomaterials may stimulate or inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells according to the complex environmental conditions. The information presented here should be useful for the development of biomaterials to regulate the preservation, proliferation, and differentiation of neural stem cells.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2006-05-12", "authors": ["Chih-HuangHung", "Yen-LingLin", "Tai-HorngYoung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.04.021"}

These conditions included stretching and shearing the skin at a length scale of 0.3mm using an apparatus comprising a pair of piezoelectric benders arranged to increase the stiffness/free deflection tradeoff when compared to ordinary cantilevered benders. It was then possible to test the skin with up to 80% of tangential strain. With feedback control, it was also possible to create isotonic and isometric testing conditions. The results showed much variability across subjects and it was seen that the glabrous skin exhibited nonlinear stiffening in tangential traction. The skin was consistently more elastic across the ridges than along the ridges regardless of the location of the sample on the fingerpad. The skin behaved visco-elastically but relaxed about twice as fast than it crept.

Finishing forces, surface roughness, and morphology were investigated as functions of finishing conditions. The tangential and normal forces were measured using a piezoelectric dynamometer and a data processing system. The results indicated that these forces increased with either the depth of cut or with the feed rate, in the ranges of 0.12-0.31 N and 0.45-1.09 N, respectively. However, an increase in either depth of cut or feed rate affected neither the surface roughness measured using a stylus profilometer nor the morphology observed under a scanning electron microscope. The finished porcelain surfaces were found to consist of the microfracture and chipping areas, ductile removal areas, smeared areas, and debris. Irregular fracture and chipping resulted from the extension of lateral/median cracks; ductile micromachining was attributed to the plastic deformation accompanied by distributed microcracks. It was determined that a combination of the microfracture and ductile micromachining was the primary mechanism for material removal.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Cavitation-enhanced ultrasound thermal therapy by combined low- and high-frequency ultrasound exposure.", "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a novel approach for enhancing ultrasound-induced heating by the introduction of acoustic cavitation using simultaneous sonication with low- and high-frequency ultrasound. A spherical focused transducer (566 or 1155 kHz) was used to generate the thermal lesions, and a low-frequency planar transducer (40 or 28 kHz) was used to enhance the bubble activity. Ex vivo fresh porcine muscles were used as the target of ultrasound ablation. The emitted signals and the signals backscattered from the bubble activity were also recorded during the heating process by a PVDF-type needle hydrophone, and thermocouples were inserted to measure temperatures. Compared with the lesions formed by a single focused transducer, the size of the lesions generated by this approach were as much as 140% larger along the axial direction and 200% larger along the radial direction for combined 566- and 40-kHz sonication. They were 47% and 66% larger along the axial and radial directions, respectively, for combined 1155- and 28-kHz sonication. Cavitation activities enhanced by low-frequency ultrasound were confirmed by the presence of subharmonics in the spectrum and temperature increase as a result of increased tissue absorption. These observations imply that cavitation-enhanced lesions can be generated without reducing the penetration ability; they also show the advantage of producing larger and more uniform thermal lesions by multiple sonications. This technique provides an easy and effective way to achieve cavitation-enhanced heating, and may be useful for generating large and deep-seated thermal lesions.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2006-05-09", "authors": ["Hao-LiLiu", "Wen-ShiangChen", "Jhao-SyongChen", "Tzu-ChingShih", "Yung-YawChen", "Win-LiLin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.01.010"}

{"title": "A new technical approach to quantify cell-cell adhesion forces by AFM.", "abstract": "Cell-cell adhesion is a complex process that is involved in the tethering of cells, cell-cell communication, tissue formation, cell migration and the development and metastasis of tumors. Given the heterogeneous and complex nature of cell surfaces it has previously proved difficult to characterize individual cell-cell adhesion events. Force spectroscopy, using an atomic force microscope, is capable of resolving such individual cell-cell binding events, but has previously been limited in its application due to insufficient effective pulling distances. Extended pulling range is critical in studying cell-cell interactions due to the potential for large cell deformations. Here we describe an approach to such experiments, where the sample stage can be moved 100 microm in the z-direction, by closed loop, linearized piezo elements. Such an approach enables an increase in pulling distance sufficient for the observation of long-distance cell-unbinding events without reducing the imaging capabilities of the atomic force microscope. The atomic force microscope head and the piezo-driven sample stage are installed on an inverted optical microscope fitted with a piezo-driven objective, to allow the monitoring of cell morphology by conventional light microscopy, concomitant with force spectroscopy measurements.

{"title": "Fabrication and use of high-speed, concentric h+- and Ca2+-selective microelectrodes suitable for in vitro extracellular recording.", "abstract": "Ion-selective microelectrodes (ISMs) have been used extensively in neurophysiological studies. ISMs selective for H(+) and Ca(2+) are notable for their sensitivity and selectivity, but suffer from a slow response time, and susceptibility to noise because of the high electrical resistance of the respective ion exchange cocktails. These drawbacks can be overcome by using a \"coaxial\" or \"concentric\" inner micropipette to shunt the bulk of the ion exchanger resistance. This approach was used decades ago to record extracellular [Ca(2+)] transients in cat cortex, but has not been subsequently used. Here, we describe a method for the rapid fabrication of concentric pH- and Ca(2+)-selective microelectrodes useful for extracellular studies in brain slices or other work in vitro. Construction was simplified compared with previous implementations, by using commercially available, thin-walled borosilicate glass, drawing an outer barrel with a rapid taper (similar to a patch pipette), and by use of a quick and reliable silanization procedure. Using a piezoelectric stepper to effect a rapid solution change, the response time constants of the concentric pH and Ca(2+)-electrodes were 14.9 +/- 1.3 and 5.3 +/- 0.90 ms, respectively. Use of these concentric ISMs is demonstrated in rat hippocampal slices. Activity-dependent, extracellular pH, and [Ca(2+)] transients are shown to arise two- to threefold faster, and attain amplitudes two- to fourfold greater, when recorded by concentric versus conventional ISMs. The advantage of concentric ISMs for studies of ion transport and ion diffusion is discussed.", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "date": "2006-05-05", "authors": ["NataliyaFedirko", "NataliyaSvichar", "MitchellChesler"], "doi": "10.1152/jn.00258.2006"}

The diaphragm structures were piezoelectric unimorphs consisting of Pb(Zr0.52,Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) films and thermally grown silicon oxide (SiO2) layers. For electrical excitation, ring-shaped interdigitated (IDT) electrodes formed on the top of the PZT layer were used to induce strain in the diaphragms. The diaphragm structures behaved much like circular membranes in which the membrane tension was approximately 206 N/m, at the fundamental modes. For higher modes, the resonance frequencies deviated from the theoretical values due to the finite stiffness of the diaphragms. Under mechanical drive, both symmetric and asymmetric modes were excited. However, for electrical excitation, the symmetric modes were dominant due to the symmetry of the driving IDT electrodes. At a pressure of 727 Torr, the quality factor was approximately 250, and this rose to 2000 at pressures below 1 Torr. When a forward bias was applied to the diaphragm, the membrane tension decreased, but under reverse biases the tension increased. However, because of repoling under reverse biases greater than the coercive field of the PZT film, the achievable increase in the membrane tension was limited. In the diaphragm structure, the nonlinear vibration was governed by geometric nonlinearity rather than material nonlinearity.

Oral surgeons have started using a newly developed ultrasound bone scalpel when performing precise osteotomies. By using a frequency of 25-29 kHz only mineralized tissue is cut, sparing the soft tissue. This reduces the risk of nerve lesions. As there is a lack of experience with this technique in the field of orthopaedic bone surgery, we performed the first ultrasound osteotomy in hand surgery.\nWhile performing a correctional osteotomy of the 5th metacarpal bone we used the Piezosurgery Device from Mectron [Italy] instead of the usual oscillating saw. We will report on our experience with one case, with a follow up time of one year.\nThe cut was highly precise and there were no vibrations of the bone. The time needed for the operation was slightly longer than the time needed while using the usual saw. Bone healing was good and at no point were there any neurovascular disturbances.\nThe Piezosurgery Device is useful for small long bone osteotomies. Using the fine tip enables curved cutting and provides an opportunity for new osteotomy techniques.

In the development of this process, various approaches were taken, including reduction of power demand, chemical consumption and sludge disposal costs. To address power demand reductions, air supply requirements for membrane cleaning were reduced. The process adopted an improved membrane that requires less air for cleaning than conventional membranes. It also introduced cyclic aeration, which alternately supplies washing air to the two series of membrane units. Adoption of biological phosphorus removal eliminated chemical costs for phosphorus removal and contributed to the reduction of sludge disposal costs.

This study investigated gene expression in cloned mouse embryos derived from cumulus cell donor nuclei, in comparison with in vivo fertilized mouse embryos, at progressive developmental stages. Enucleation was carried out by the conventional puncture method rather than by the piezo-actuated technique, whereas nuclear transfer was achieved by direct cumulus nuclear injection. Embryonic development was monitored from chemically induced activation on day 0 until the blastocyst stage on day 4. Poor developmental competence of cloned embryos was observed, which was confirmed by lower cell counts in cloned blastocysts, compared with the in vivo fertilized controls. Subsequently, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze and compare embryonic gene expression at the 2-cell, 4-cell, and blastocyst stages, between the experimental and control groups. The results showed reduced expression of the candidate genes in cloned 2-cell stage embryos, as manifested by poor developmental competence, compared with expression in the in vivo fertilized controls. Cloned 4-cell embryos and blastocysts, which had overcome the developmental block at the 2-cell stage, also showed up-regulated and down-regulated expression of several genes, strongly suggesting incomplete nuclear reprogramming.

The use of fiber optic hydrophones can overcome some of the limitations associated with traditional polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) hydrophones for calibration of acoustic fields. Compared to standard PVDF hydrophones, FOPH systems generally have larger bandwidths, enhanced spatial resolution, reduced directionality, and greater immunity to electromagnetic interference, though they can be limited by significantly lower sensitivities. The FOPH system presently described employs a 100-microm multimode optical fiber as the sensing element and incorporates a 1-W laser diode module, 2 x 2 optical coupler, and general-purpose 50-MHz silicon p-i-n photodetector. Wave forms generated using the FOPH system and a reference PVDF hydrophone are compared, and intrinsic and substitution methods for calibrating the FOPH system are discussed. The voltage-to-pressure transfer factor is approximately 0.8 mV/MPa (-302 dB re 1 V/microPa), though straightforward modifications to the optical components in the FOPH system are discussed that can significantly increase this value.

A gold-coated piezoelectric-excited millimeter-sized cantilever (PEMC) sensor of 6-mm2 sensing area was fabricated, where resonant frequency decreases upon mass increase. The resonant frequency in air of the detection peak was 45.5 +/- 0.01 kHz. SAMs of C11-thiols (in absolute ethanol) with different end groups was prepared on the PEMC sensor and then exposed to buffer solution containing HSA at 10 microg/mL. The resonant frequency decreased exponentially and reached a steady-state value within 30 min. The decrease in resonant frequency indicates that the mass of the sensor increased due to HSA adsorption onto the SAM layer. The frequency change obtained for the HSA adsorption on CH3-, COOH-, and OH-terminated SAM were 520.8 +/- 8.6 (n = 3), 290.4 +/- 6.1 (n = 2), and 210.6 +/- 8.1 Hz (n = 3), respectively.

The total dimensions of the electric energy generator are 5.08 x 11.6 x 7.7 cm3. The rectangular, box-shaped body of the overall structure is made using 3.2-mm thick plastic. Slits are made on two opposite faces of the box so that two columns and six rows of bimorph actuators can be inserted. Each row of bimorph actuators is separated from each other by a gap of 6 mm, and the two columns of bimorphs are separated from each other by a gap of 6.35 mm. In between the two columns, a cylindrical rod is inserted consisting of six rectangular hooks. The hooks are positioned in such a way that each of them just touches the two bimorphs on either side in a particular row. As the wind flows across the generator, it creates a rotary motion on the attached fan that is converted into vertical motion of the cylindrical rod using the cam-shaft mechanism. This vertical motion of the cylindrical rod creates oscillating stress on the bimorphs due to attached hooks.

Lower frequency reaches greater depth, but results in low resolution. For clear image, some gel is usually applied between the probe and the skin contact surface. For prostate positioning, axial and sagittal scans are performed, and the volume contours from computed tomography (CT) planning are superimposed on the ultrasound images obtained before radiation delivery at the linear accelerator. The planning volumes are then overlaid on the ultrasound images and adjusted until they match.

Displacement was also measured for bilateral osteotomy during muscle stimulation from a subgroup of 12 pigs.\nThe osteotomy site demonstrated significant mobility during power strokes of mastication with an average magnitude of 0.3 to 0.4 mm. Distinct patterns of displacement were associated with different locations, and the patterns varied between chewing sides. The most common pattern was lengthening at the superior-lateral and shortening at both inferior sites. Similar amounts of displacement were observed during the stimulation of jaw-closers (masseter and medial pterygoid), but the patterns produced by these muscles did not completely explain the masticatory pattern.

Fourteen kidneys were removed immediately after ablation to evaluate the side-effects and the effects in the focal zone, and 10 kidneys were removed delayed after 1, 7 and 10 days.

After 7 and 10 days, there was a well-demarcated coagulation necrosis in vivo.\nUsing this device, extracorporeally applied HIFU can ablate healthy kidney tissue in vivo in combination with diagnostic online ultrasonography.

{"title": "Variation of force applied during external cephalic version with different patients' characteristic and outcome of version.", "abstract": "To compare the degree of force applied during external cephalic version, between different patients' characteristic and outcomes of version.\nIt is a prospective observational study in a cohort of patients undergoing external cephalic version at or above 36 weeks of gestation. During external cephalic version, the operator wore a pair of pressure-sensing gloves which had ultra-thin piezo-resistive pressure sensors positioned on the palmer surface. Readings from each of the sensors were recorded in real time throughout each version attempt and analyzed by a computer program. The pressure exerted on individual sensors over time, the pressure-time integral (PTI; mmHg s), was calculated for each sensor from the start to the end of each version attempted. The degree of force applied for each attempt (PTI-A) was represented by the sum of pressure-time integrals across all sensors. PTI-A was analyzed in relation to different patients' characteristics and outcome of version.\nNinety-two patients were recruited, 73% of whom had a successful external cephalic version. The median PTI-A of the successful attempt in women who completed version after 1 and 2 attempts were 17,180 and 17,736 mmHg s, respectively. They were significantly lower than that of the women who required 3 or more attempts for a successful version (32,351 mmHg s), as well as the highest PTI-A among all attempts received by women who finally had a failed version (31,638 mmHg s) (p <0.05, Kruskal-Wallis Test and Dunn test). Within the same subject, there was no difference in PTI-A between the successful attempt and the preceding failed attempt, suggesting that the failure may not be due to insufficient force but rather to inefficient application of the force. Uterine tone was found to be the only clinical variable that was significantly associated with the degree of applied force during a version (p < 0.05). A tenser uterus was associated with a stronger applied force.\nThe degree of force required for a successful version is highly variable, being lowest when version can be completed within 2 attempts, but doubled when 3 or more attempts are required. Failure of version is usually not due to inadequate force but inefficient application of force. Uterine tone is significantly related to the degree of applied force, with stronger force being exerted when the uterus is tense.", "journal": "Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica", "date": "2006-03-15", "authors": ["Tak YeungLeung", "Daljit SinghSahota", "Lin WaiChan", "Wing YeeFok", "Lai WaLaw", "Tze KinLau"], "doi": "10.1080/00016340500408440"}

Fourier transformation of the resultant space-time displacement histories is then employed to obtain phase velocity as a function of frequency. Experimental verification in the case of antisymmetrical stimulation is provided by means of a high-power Q-switched laser source that is used to excite guided waves in the plate.

Examples of dispersion data are provided for aluminum, and excellent correlation between the data sets and conventional Rayleigh-Lamb theory for plate structures was obtained.

{"title": "Quality factor concept in piezoceramic transformer performance description.", "abstract": "A new general approach based on the quality factor concept to piezoceramic transformer (PT) performance description is proposed. The system's quality factor, material elastic anisotropy, and coupling factors of the input and output sections of an electrically excited and electrically loaded PT fully characterize its resonance and near-resonance behavior. The PT efficiency, transformation ratio, and input and output power were analytically analyzed and simulated as functions of the load and frequency for the simplest classical Langevin-type and Rosen-type PT designs. A new formulation of the electrical input impedance allows one to separate the power consumed by PT from the power transferred into the load. The system's PT quality factor takes into account losses in each PT \"input-output-load\" functional components. The loading process is changing PT input electrical impedance on the way that under loading the minimum series impedance is increasing and the maximum parallel impedance is decreasing coincidentally. The quality-factors ratio, between the states of fully loaded and nonloaded PT, is one of the best measures of PTs dynamic performance--practically, the lower the ratio is, the better PT efficiency. A simple and effective method for the loaded PT quality factor determination is proposed. As was found, a piezoceramic with low piezoelectric anisotropy is required to provide maximum PT efficiency and higher corresponding voltage gain.

The congruent composition determined here was 48.460 Li2O-mol%, corresponding to the LSAW velocity (42 degrees YX-LiTaO3) of 3125.3 m/s, and the absolute relationship between the LSAW velocity and chemical composition was obtained. Simulations on the variation of the melt and crystal compositions in a mass production of 100 crystals were conducted as a function of the composition of the starting material around the congruent composition. The result showed that the distributions of the melt and crystal compositions within and among the crystals varied largely with the material composition, providing the relationship of the material composition with the maximum composition variation for the 100 crystals. Based on these results, we verified the relationships between the tolerance of the material composition variation and the tolerances for the SH-type SAW velocity, LSAW velocity, and Curie temperature. The material composition needs to be constrained to within +/- 0.007 Li2O-mol% around the congruent composition to mass-produce the crystals with reliable homogeneity, satisfying the tolerance of +/- 0.01% in the SAW velocity.

The sampling probe mass spectrometer system was used to sample and detect lysozyme that had been deposited onto a glass slide using a piezoelectric spotter or murine gamma-interferon affinity captured on a glass slide using surface-immobilized anti-gamma-interferon antibody. The detection level for surface-deposited lysozyme (spot size < or =200 microm) was approximately 1.0 fmol (approximately 100 fmol/mm2) as determined from the ability to measure accurately the protein molecular mass from the mass spectrum acquired by sampling the deposit. These detection limits may be sufficient for certain applications in which protein fractions from a separation method are collected onto a surface. Radiolabeled proteins were used to quantify the surface density of immobilized antibody and the efficiency of capture of the gamma-interferon on glass and higher surface area ceramic supports. The capture density of gamma-interferon at surface saturation ranged from about 23 to 50 fmol/mm2 depending on the capture surface. Nonetheless, mass spectrometric detection of affinity capture protein was successful in some cases, but the results were not reproducible.

This was achieved through solubilization in mixed negatively charged micelles. Under the experimental conditions used, no significant fouling of the membrane comprising of cellulose, polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene fluoride was observed, with no retardation of ultrafiltration. The introduction of a nonionic surfactant to SDS reduced the critical micelle concentration of mixed micelles and then the concentration of surfactants in the permeate, i.e., from 8.3 x 10(-3)M for SDS to 2.0 x 10(-3) M for the mixture of SDS:OMC-10 = 4:1. Such a tailored surfactant mixture enabled the authors to achieve 93-94% retention of methylene blue using a hydrophilic membrane made of cellulose.

{"title": "Influence of test capacitor features on piezoelectric and dielectric measurement of ferroelectric films.", "abstract": "This paper presents both theoretical and numerical analyses of the piezoelectric and dielectric responses of a highly idealized film-on-substrate system, namely, a polarized ferroelectric film perfectly bonded to an elastic silicon substrate. It shows that both effective dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the films change with the size and configuration of the test capacitor. There exists a critical electrode size that is smaller than the diameter of the commonly used substrate. The effective film properties converge to their respective constrained values as capacitor size increases to the critical size. If capacitor size is smaller than the critical size, the surface displacement at the top electrode deviates from the net thickness change in response to an applied voltage because the film is deformable at the film/substrate interface. The constrained properties of the films depend only on those of bulk ferroelectrics but are independent of film thickness and substrate properties. The finding of the critical capacitor size together with analytical expressions of the constrained properties makes it possible to realize consistent measurement of piezoelectric and dielectric properties of films.

The nonlinear technique, synchronized switch damping (SSD), is implemented. The device is a pulse-tube termination equipped with piezoelements, which allows performant damping of the vibration resulting from an incident acoustic wave. Due to this damping, both reflected and transmitted wave are reduced. In the semipassive damping approach proposed in this paper, energy degradation is strongly enhanced when the piezoelements are continuously switched from open to short circuit synchronously to the strain. This technique has been developed following two strategies. The first is SSD on a short circuit in which the piezoelement is always in open circuit, except for a very brief period at each strain extremum where it is short-circuited. The second approach is SSD on an inductor. The process is very similar, except that instead of forcing the voltage to zero, the voltage is exactly reversed using a controlled oscillating discharge of the piezoelement capacitor on an inductor during switch drive. Due to this switching mechanism, a phase shift appears between the strain and the resulting voltage, thus creating energy dissipation. Following SSD on an piezoelement, attenuations of 15 dB in reflection and 7 dB in transmission were obtained.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2006-02-04", "authors": ["DGuyomar", "AFaiz", "LPetit", "CRichard"], "doi": "10.1121/1.2141361"}

By contrast with centralized MIMO controllers used to actively control the vibrations or the sound radiation of extended structures, decentralized control using independent local control loops only requires identification of the diagonal terms in the plant matrix. However, it is difficult to a priori predict the global stability of such decentralized control. In this study, the general situation of noncollocated actuator-sensor pairs was considered. Frequency domain gradient and Newton-Raphson adaptation of decentralized control were analyzed, both in terms of performance and stability conditions. The stability conditions are especially derived in terms of the adaptation coefficient and a control effort weighting coefficient. Simulations and experimental results are presented in the case of a simply supported panel with four PZT-PVDF pairs distributed on it. Decentralized vibration control is shown to be highly dependent on the frequency, but can be as effective as a fully centralized control even when the plant matrix is not diagonal-dominant or is not strictly positive real (not dissipative).", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2006-02-04", "authors": ["MatthieuBaudry", "PhilippeMicheau", "AlainBerry"], "doi": "10.1121/1.2139624"}

Sensing parameters such as CCD integration time, pupil sampling and beam steering amplitude are tested on the bench and in vivo on several volunteers to optimize real-time optical correction. The system allows closed-loop operation at a frame rate of 55 Hz and reduces ocular aberration up to lambda/5 residual RMS over a 6 mm pupil. Aberration correction and mirror control stability clearly increase when smaller beam steering amplitudes synonymous of higher wavefront sensing sensitivity are used.

Detection of pathogen (Bacillus anthracis (BA) at 300 spores/mL) and BSA (1 mg/mL) were investigated under both stagnant and flow conditions. Two flow cell designs were evaluated by characterizing flow-induced resonant frequency shifts. One of the flow cells labeled SFC-2 (hold-up volume of 0.3 mL), showed small fluctuations (+/-20 Hz) around a common resonant frequency response of 217 Hz in the flow rate range of 1-17 mL/min. The total resonant frequency change obtained for the binding of 300 spores/mL in 1h was 90+/-5 Hz (n=2), and 162+/-10 Hz (n=2) under stagnant and flow conditions, respectively. Binding of antibodies, anti-BA and anti-BSA, were more rapid under flow than under stagnant conditions. The sensor was repeatedly exposed to BSA with an intermediate release step.

However, conventional diagnoses such as visual observation and thermography required about 1 week to obtain results and these methods cannot give quantitative information on the adhesion of a skin graft. We proposed a new method for monitoring adhesion of grafted skin that is based on measurement of photoacoustic signals. To investigate the validity of the method, we performed experiments using rat autografts models.\nGrafted skin in a rat was irradiated with 200 microJ, 532-nm nanosecond laser pulses, and photoacoustic signals were detected with a piezoelectric transducer placed on the skin at various postgrafting time. Temporal profiles of the signals were converted to depth profiles using an assumed sound velocity of 1,500 m/second. Histological analysis was performed to observe neovascularities formed in the grafts.\nAt 6 hours postgrafting, a photoacoustic signal peak appeared in the depth region corresponding to the graft. The results of histological analysis also showed formation of neovascularities in the graft after 6 hours postgrafting, indicating that photoacoustic signal peaks observed in the graft originated from the neovascularities, which are an indication of graft adhesion. For up to 24 hours postgrafting, no significant difference was observed between the results of visual observation and laser Doppler imaging of the same grafted skins.\nWe have demonstrated that photoacoustic signals originating from neovascularities in grafts can be sensitively detected in the early postgrafting period, suggesting the validity of photoacoustic measurement for adhesion monitoring of skin grafts.", "journal": "Lasers in surgery and medicine", "date": "2006-01-05", "authors": ["MutsuoYamazaki", "ShunichiSato", "DaizohSaitoh", "YoshiakiOkada", "HiroshiAshida", "MinoruObara"], "doi": "10.1002/lsm.20272"}

The mutation investigated is in the TP53 gene, which results inactivated in most cancer types. TP53 gene maps on chromosome 17 (17p13.1).

In particular, those occurring in the structurally important L2 and L3 zinc-binding domains, have been linked to patient prognosis and more strongly to radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance in several major cancers. For this reason, the identification of these mutations represents an important clinical target and biosensors could represent good candidate for fast mutation screening. In this paper, a DNA-based piezoelectric biosensor for the detection of the TP53 gene mutation at codon 248 is reported. A biotinylated probe was immobilised on the sensor surface via dextran-streptavidin modified surfaces. The sensor was optimised using synthetic oligonucleotides. Finally, the sensor system was successfully applied to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified real samples of DNA extracted from two cell lines, one normal (wild-type) and one mutated, carrying the mutation at codon 248 of the TP53 gene.

The vibrational amplitude at a frequency corresponding to the radial resonance shows a statistically significant change over time. The initial period of inflammation is marked by a significant reduction in amplitude, which is indicative of an increase in viscous dissipation of the tissue. As collagen displaces the cellular response, the amplitude continues to decrease. Finally, as the tissue matures, the capsule becomes stiffer, and the viscous dissipation lessens. These results are consistent with qualitative assessments of explanted capsules. Strain gauges encased in a monolithic block of silicone exhibited a greater degree of variability, yet show similar trends over time. The strain increases in the initial 4-week period and remains relatively steady over the following 4 weeks.

Three different codes, namely, chirp signal and two sinusoidal sequences were investigated. The sequences were phase modulated with 13 bits Barker code and 16 bits Golay complementary codes. Moreover, two reference signals generated as two and sixteen cycle sine tone bursts were examined. Planar, 50% (fractional) bandwidth, 15 mm diameter source transducer operating at 2 MHz center frequency was used in all measurements. The experimental data were collected using computerized scanning system and recorded using wideband, PVDF membrane hydrophone (Sonora 804). The measured echoes were compressed, so the complete pressure field in the investigated location before and after compression could be compared. In addition to a priori anticipated increase in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for the decoded pressure fields, the results indicated differences in the pressure amplitude levels, directivity patterns, and the axial distance at which the maximum pressure amplitude was recorded. It was found that the directivity patterns of non-compressed fields exhibited shapes similar to the patterns characteristic for sinusoidal excitation having relatively long time duration. In contrast, the patterns corresponding to compressed fields resembled those produced by brief, wideband pulses. This was particularly visible in the case of binary sequences. The location of the maximum pressure amplitude measured in the 2 MHz field shifted towards the source by 15 mm and 25 mm for Barker code and Golay code, respectively. The results of this work may be applicable in the development of new coded excitation schemes.

This paper provides a critical review of current sensory systems and the potential of a selection of electroactive polymers for sensory applications in hand prostheses. Candidate electroactive polymers are reviewed in terms of their relevant advantages and disadvantages, together with their current implementation in related applications. Empirical analysis of one of the most novel electroactive polymers, ionic polymer metal composites (IPMC), was conducted to demonstrate its potential for prosthetic applications. With linear responses within the operating range typical of hand prostheses, bending angles, and bending rates were accurately measured with 4.4+/-2.5 and 4.8+/-3.5% error, respectively, using the IPMC sensors. With these comparable error rates to traditional resistive bend sensors and a wide range of sensitivities and responses, electroactive polymers offer a promising alternative to more traditional sensory approaches. Their potential role in prosthetics is further heightened by their flexible and formable structure, and their ability to act as both sensors and actuators.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2005-11-02", "authors": ["ElaineBiddiss", "TomChau"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2005.09.009"}

Following determination of isokinetic peak torque (PT) and the isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), 10 adults (mean+/-SD age=22.8+/-2.7yrs) performed randomly ordered, submaximal step muscle actions of the dominant forearm flexors in 20% increments from 20% to 80% PT and MVC. Surface MMG signals were recorded simultaneously from a contact sensor and an accelerometer placed over the belly of the biceps brachii muscle. During the isokinetic and isometric muscle actions, the contact sensor and accelerometer resulted in linear increases in normalized MMG amplitude with torque (r(2) range=0.84-0.97) but the linear slope of the normalized MMG amplitude versus isokinetic torque relationship for the accelerometer was less (p<0.10) than that of the contact sensor. There was no significant (p>0.05) relationship for normalized MMG mean power frequency (MPF, %max) versus isokinetic and isometric torque for the contact sensor, but the accelerometer demonstrated a quadratic (R(2)=0.94) or linear (r(2)=0.83) relationship for the isokinetic and isometric muscle actions, respectively. There were also a number of significant (p<0.05) mean differences between the contact sensor and accelerometer for normalized MMG amplitude or MPF values. These findings indicated that in some cases involving dynamic and isometric muscle actions, the contact sensor and accelerometer resulted in different torque-related responses that may affect the interpretation of the motor control strategies involved.", "journal": "Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology", "date": "2005-10-26", "authors": ["Travis WBeck", "Terry JHoush", "Glen OJohnson", "Joseph PWeir", "Joel TCramer", "Jared WCoburn", "Moh HMalek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jelekin.2005.07.013"}

The construction employed a combination of the piezoelectric biosensor for glycated haemoglobin and the flow-through photometric sensor for total haemoglobin (Hb). The modification of gold electrodes with 3-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) as a specific ligand was studied; the chemisorbed conjugate of APBA with a long-chain thiocompound provided the best affinity for HbA1c. The effect of various operating parameters, such as flow rate and instrumental setup, was optimised. The total haemoglobin content was analysed as absorbance of the haemoglobin-cyanide derivative at 540 nm. Only one standard (calibrator) diluted in various ratio was necessary for calibration and 1 microl of blood was sufficient for analysis. The full range of HbA1c content (4-15%) in blood can be analysed; the working ranges of total and glycated haemoglobin were 50-2000 and 10-90 microg/ml, respectively.

{"title": "Membrane chromatographic immunoassay method for rapid quantitative analysis of specific serum antibodies.", "abstract": "This paper discusses a membrane chromatographic immunoassay method for rapid detection and quantitative analysis of specific serum antibodies. A type of polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) microfiltration membrane was used in the method for its ability to reversibly and specifically bind IgG antibodies from antiserum samples by hydrophobic interaction. Using this form of selective antibody binding and enrichment an affinity membrane with antigen binding ability was obtained in-situ. This was done by passing a pulse of diluted antiserum sample through a stack of microporous PVDF membranes. The affinity membrane thus formed was challenged with a pulse of antigen solution and the amount of antigen bound was accurately determined using chromatographic methods. The antigen binding correlated well with the antibody loading on the membrane. This method is direct, rapid and accurate, does not involve any chemical reaction, and uses very few reagents. Moreover, the same membrane could be repeatedly used for sequential immunoassays on account of the reversible nature of the antibody binding. Proof of concept of this method is provided using human hemoglobin as model antigen and rabbit antiserum against human hemoglobin as the antibody source.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2005-10-01", "authors": ["RajaGhosh"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.20707"}

Antibody specific to Bacillus anthracis (BA, Sterne strain 7702) spores was immobilized on PEMC sensors, and exposed to spores (300 to 3x10(6) spores/mL). The resonant frequency decreased at a rate proportional to the spore concentration and reached a steady state frequency change of 5+/-5 Hz (n=3), 92+/-7 Hz (n=3), 500+/-10 Hz (n=3), 1030+/-10 Hz (n=2), and 2696+/-6 Hz (n=2) corresponding to 0, 3x10(2), 3x10(3), 3x10(4), and 3x10(6) spores/mL, respectively. The reduction in resonant frequency is proportional to the change in cantilever mass, and thus the observed changes are due to the attachment of spores on the sensor surface. Selectivity of the antibody-functionalized sensor was determined with samples of BA (3x10(6)/mL) mixed with Bacillus thuringiensis (BT; 1.5x10(9)/mL) in various volume ratios that yielded BA:BT ratios of 1:0, 1:125, 1:250, 1:500 and 0:1. The corresponding resonance frequency decreases were, respectively, 2345, 1980, 1310, 704 and 10 Hz. Sample containing 100% BT spores (1.5x10(9)/mL and no BA) gave a steady state frequency decrease of 10 Hz, which is within noise level of the sensor, indicating excellent selectivity. The observed binding rate constant for the pure BA and BT-containing samples ranged from 0.105 to 0.043 min-1 in the spore concentration range 300 to 3x10(6)/mL. These results show that detection of B. anthracis spore at a very low concentration (300 spores/mL) and with high selectivity in presence of another Bacillus spore (BT) can be accomplished using piezoelectric-excited millimeter-sized cantilever sensors.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2005-09-20", "authors": ["Gossett ACampbell", "RajMutharasan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2005.08.001"}
{"title": "Measurement of 5-HT4 receptor-mediated esophageal responses by digital sonomicrometry in the anesthetized rat.", "abstract": "In vitro studies have demonstrated a 5-HT4 receptor-mediated relaxation of the pre-contracted rat esophagus. However, it is unclear whether 5-HT4 receptor agonists affect resting esophageal tone in vivo. The activity of 5-HT and several well-established 5-HT4 receptor agonists (tegaserod, BIMU-8, cisapride, renzapride, and mosapride) was investigated in a novel in vivo model designed to measure esophageal relaxation using the technique of digital sonomicrometry.\nMiniature piezo-electric crystals were implanted externally in a longitudinal orientation on the distal esophagus of isoflurane-anesthetized, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Measurement of the time for transmission of ultrasonic pulses between the implanted crystals provided a continuous recording of inter-crystal distance and hence esophageal muscle length.\nFollowing cumulative intravenous administration, 5-HT (1-100 microg/kg), tegaserod (1-1000 microg/kg), BIMU-8 (3-3000 microg/kg), renzapride (10-3000 microg/kg), cisapride (30-3000 microg/kg), and mosapride (30-10,000 microg/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in esophageal inter-crystal distance. The mean ED50 values for tegaserod, BIMU-8, renzapride, cisapride, and mosapride were 11, 49, 51, 141, and 1825 microg/kg, respectively. Pre-treatment with the selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, piboserod (SB-207266; 1 mg/kg subcutaneously) significantly attenuated the effects of intravenous tegaserod (1-1000 microg/kg). Following cumulative intraduodenal administration (0.03-10 mg/kg), tegaserod and mosapride exhibited a dose-dependent increase in esophageal inter-crystal distance. The doses associated with a 10% increase in muscle length from the resting level were 2.6 and>10 mg/kg for tegaserod and mosapride, respectively.\nIn conclusion, dose-dependent, 5-HT4 receptor agonist-mediated increases in longitudinal muscle length in the rat esophagus were observed in vivo using the technique of digital sonomicrometry.

{"title": "Effect of modulation of serotonergic, cholinergic, and nitrergic pathways on murine fundic size and compliance measured by ultrasonomicrometry.", "abstract": "Reduced fasting or postprandial gastric volumes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia. The mechanisms that underlie the control of gastric fundic volume are incompletely understood, partly because of an inability to accurately measure fundic volume in vivo in small animals. Small animals are useful models to evaluate mechanisms, e.g., in knockout animals. The aim of this study was to determine whether an ultrasonometric technique accurately monitors fundic contraction and relaxation in mice in vivo and to determine the effect of modulation of cholinergic, nitrergic, and serotonergic pathways on fundic size and compliance in the intact mouse innervated stomach. Two to four piezoelectric crystals (diameter 1 mm, 24-microm resolution) were glued to the serosal side of fundus and used to measure distance. Validation studies showed excellent correlation between measured changes and actual changes in distances between crystals and excellent reproducibility. The expected responses to pharmacological modulation with bethanechol and nitroglycerin were demonstrated. Atropine increased the distance between the crystals, suggesting a baseline cholinergic regulation of fundic volume. Bethanechol, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, and the 5-HT1B/D agonist sumatriptan decreased the distance between the crystals, suggesting fundic contraction. Atropine, nitroglycerin, and buspirone caused an increase in intercrystal distance consistent with fundic relaxation. Fundic compliance was investigated by changing intragastric pressure via an implanted catheter. Sumatriptan increased compliance, whereas buspirone increased the distance between crystals but did not change compliance. The data suggest that ultrasonomicrometry is a useful tool that can reproducibly and accurately measure changes in fundic size and the response to pharmacological agents.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The circuit design consists of a circuit with a piezoelectric quartz crystal (SPQC) and a pair of electrodes. This system can provide dynamic data monitoring on a web-page via the Internet. Immersion of the electrodes in a cell culture with bacteria inoculums resulted in a change of frequency caused by the impedance change due to microbial metabolism and the adherence of bacteria on the surface of the electrodes.

Intended as one part in a complete portable, battery operated ultrasound sensor system, focus has been to achieve small size and low power consumption. An optimized ASIC driver stage is mounted directly on the piezoelectric transducer and connected using wire bond technology. The absence of wiring between driver and transducer provides excellent pulse control possibilities and eliminates the need for broad band matching networks. Estimates of the sensor power consumption are made based on the capacitive behavior of the piezoelectric transducer. System behavior and power consumption are simulated using SPICE models of the ultrasound transducer together with transistor level modelling of the driver stage. Measurements and simulations are presented of system power consumption and echo energy in a pulse echo setup. It is shown that the power consumption varies with the excitation pulse width, which also affects the received ultrasound energy in a pulse echo setup. The measured power consumption for a 16 mm diameter 4.4 MHz piezoelectric transducer varies between 95 microW and 130 microW at a repetition frequency of 1 kHz. As a lower repetition frequency gives a linearly lower power consumption, very long battery operating times can be achieved.

Subjects walked on a treadmill in a VR environment and a non-VR environment at each of three walking speeds: 0.9, 1.1, and 1.3 m/s. In the VR environment, an endless corridor with colored vertical stripes comprising the walls was projected onto a hemispherical screen placed in front of the treadmill. The speed of the moving corridor image was matched to the speed of the treadmill to create the illusion that subjects were walking through the endless corridor. Spatiotemporal data during gait were collected with an instrumented treadmill housing two piezoelectric force platforms. Gait parameters reflective of gait instability (stride length, step width, variability in stride velocity, and variability in step width) were compared between the VR and non-VR environments. Subjects walked in the VR environment with reduced stride lengths (p = 0.001), increased step widths (p = 0.001), and with increased variability in stride velocity (p < 0.001) and step width (p = 0.002).
