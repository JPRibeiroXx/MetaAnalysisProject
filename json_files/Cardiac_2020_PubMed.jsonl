{"title": "Structural Regulation of Myocytes in Engineered Healthy and Diseased Cardiac Models.", "abstract": "The development of cardiac models that faithfully recapitulate heart conditions is the goal of cardiac biomedical research. Among the numerous limitations of current models, replication of the cardiac microenvironment is one of the key challenges, and the effect of mechanical cues remains obscure in cardiac tissue. In this paper, different topological structures in the engineered cardiac models are summarized, and mechanical regulation of myocyte morphology and functional responses are discussed. Microenvironmental cues in vivo are influencing cardiac functions from cellular to tissue levels, and replications of these micro and macro features in the in vitro cardiac model shed light on cardiac research from a mechanistic point of view. With simple manipulation of topology, both physiological and pathological cardiac constructs can be remodeled to investigate the origin of abnormal cell phenotypes and functional responses in cardiac diseases. The integration of topological guidance with heart-on-a-chip devices is covered briefly and limitations of the current cardiac constructs are also addressed for future advancements in personalized medicine.", "journal": "ACS applied bio materials", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["JingYu", "PingqiangCai", "XiaodongChen"], "doi": "10.1021/acsabm.0c01270"}
{"title": "Nanovolcano microelectrode arrays: toward long-term on-demand registration of transmembrane action potentials by controlled electroporation.", "abstract": "Volcano-shaped microelectrodes (nanovolcanoes) functionalized with nanopatterned self-assembled monolayers have recently been demonstrated to report cardiomyocyte action potentials after gaining spontaneous intracellular access. These nanovolcanoes exhibit recording characteristics similar to those of state-of-the-art micro-nanoelectrode arrays that use electroporation as an insertion mechanism. In this study, we investigated whether the use of electroporation improves the performance of nanovolcano arrays in terms of action potential amplitudes, recording durations, and yield. Experiments with neonatal rat cardiomyocyte monolayers grown on nanovolcano arrays demonstrated that electroporation pulses with characteristics derived from analytical models increased the efficiency of nanovolcano recordings, as they enabled multiple on-demand registration of intracellular action potentials with amplitudes as high as 62\u2009mV and parallel recordings in up to ~76% of the available channels. The performance of nanovolcanoes showed no dependence on the presence of functionalized nanopatterns, indicating that the tip geometry itself is instrumental for establishing a tight seal at the cell-electrode interface, which ultimately determines the quality of recordings. Importantly, the use of electroporation permitted the recording of attenuated cardiomyocyte action potentials during consecutive days at identical sites, indicating that nanovolcano recordings are nondestructive and permit long-term on-demand recordings from excitable cardiac tissues. Apart from demonstrating that less complex manufacturing processes can be used for next-generation nanovolcano arrays, the finding that the devices are suitable for performing on-demand recordings of electrical activity from multiple sites of excitable cardiac tissues over extended periods of time opens the possibility of using the devices not only in basic research but also in the context of comprehensive drug testing.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["Beno\u00eet X EDesbiolles", "Etiennede Coulon", "NicolasMa\u00efno", "ArnaudBertsch", "StephanRohr", "PhilippeRenaud"], "doi": "10.1038/s41378-020-0178-7\n10.1016/0304-4165(67)90052-9\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.06.002\n10.1002/j.1460-2075.1982.tb01257.x\n10.1016/0006-291X(82)91531-5\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302367\n10.1021/ac302462s\n10.2147/IJN.S27421\n10.1007/s12393-010-9017-1\n10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00066-0\n10.1016/S0169-409X(97)00034-3\n10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00067-2\n10.2174/1875397301206010087\n10.1038/nnano.2011.249\n10.3389/fncir.2013.00038\n10.1038/nnano.2017.3\n10.1038/s41551-019-0455-7\n10.3389/fneng.2012.00021\n10.1039/c2lc40091j\n10.1038/srep27110\n10.3389/fnins.2018.00212\n10.1038/ncomms4206\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02209\n10.1073/pnas.0909250107\n10.1038/srep32485\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b03163\n10.1021/nl303163y\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.160549\n10.1152/ajpheart.1992.263.4.H1128\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b04752\n10.1109/TBME.2005.847523\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.10.061807.160518\n10.1186/s40169-018-0212-7\n10.1007/s00216-006-0327-3\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77370-4\n10.1038/s41378-019-0052-7\n10.1021/nn500393p\n10.1161/01.RES.0000214537.44195.a3\n10.1039/b605937f\n10.1063/1.4942457\n10.1161/01.RES.68.1.114\n10.1038/nnano.2012.8\n10.1103/PhysRevE.66.052901\n10.1007/s00424-002-1000-0\n10.1038/s41565-018-0222-z"}

However, these platforms can show striking discrepancies in efficacy and side effects when compared to human trials. These differences can lengthen the drug development process and even lead to drug withdrawal from the market. The establishment of preclinical drug screening platforms that have higher relevancy to physiological conditions is desirable to facilitate drug development. Here, a heart-on-a-chip platform, incorporating microgrooves and electrical pulse stimulations to recapitulate the well-aligned structure and synchronous beating of cardiomyocytes (CMs) for drug screening, is reported. Each chip is made with facile lithographic and laser-cutting processes that can be easily scaled up to high-throughput format. The maturation and phenotypic changes of CMs cultured on the heart-on-a-chip is validated and it can be treated with various drugs to evaluate cardiotoxicity and cardioprotective efficacy.

{"title": "Huoxin pill attenuates myocardial infarction-induced apoptosis and fibrosis via suppression of p53 and TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 pathways.", "abstract": "Huoxin Pill (HXP), a Traditional Chinese Medicine, is used widely to treat patients with coronary heart disease and angina pectoris in China. However, the underlying protective mechanism of HXP on cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis has never been evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of HXP in a myocardial infarction (MI) mouse model. The mice were randomly divided into 3 groups and subjected to surgical ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery or sham surgery (n\u2009=\u20096 for each group) and treated with HXP (50\u2009mg/kg/day) or saline by gavage for 2 weeks. At 2 weeks post MI, we found that HXP significantly enhanced myocardial function and attenuated the increase of heart weight index (HWI) and pathological changes in MI mice. RNA-sequencing and KEGG pathway analyses identified 660 differentially expressed genes and multiple enriched signaling pathways including p53 and TGF-\u03b2. In support of these findings, HXP attenuated cardiac apoptosis and decreased p53 and Bax protein expression, while increasing Bcl-2 protein expression in cardiac tissues of MI mice. Furthermore, HXP treatment inhibited cardiac fibrosis and significantly down-regulated TGF-\u03b21 protein expression and Smad2/3 phosphorylation in cardiac tissues. In summary, HXP can improve cardiac function in mice after MI by attenuating cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis partly via supression of the p53/Bax/Bcl-2 and TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 pathways.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2021-07-30", "authors": ["ZhiqingShen", "AlingShen", "XiaopingChen", "XiangyanWu", "JianfengChu", "YingCheng", "MeizhongPeng", "YouqinChen", "NathanielWeygant", "MeizhuWu", "XiaoyingLin", "JunPeng", "KejiChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110618"}
{"title": "Elastomer-Grafted iPSC-Derived Micro Heart Muscles to Investigate Effects of Mechanical Loading on Physiology.", "abstract": "Mechanical loading plays a critical role in cardiac pathophysiology. Engineered heart tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) allow rigorous investigations of the molecular and pathophysiological consequences of mechanical cues. However, many engineered heart muscle models have complex fabrication processes and require large cell numbers, making it difficult to use them together with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to study the influence of mechanical loading on pharmacology and genotype-phenotype relationships. To address this challenge, simple and scalable iPSC-derived micro-heart-muscle arrays (\u03bcHM) have been developed. \"Dog-bone-shaped\" molds define the boundary conditions for tissue formation. Here, we extend the \u03bcHM model by forming these tissues on elastomeric substrates with stiffnesses spanning from 5 to 30 kPa. Tissue assembly was achieved by covalently grafting fibronectin to the substrate. Compared to \u03bcHM formed on plastic, elastomer-grafted \u03bcHM exhibited a similar gross morphology, sarcomere assembly, and tissue alignment. When these tissues were formed on substrates with different elasticity, we observed marked shifts in contractility. Increased contractility was correlated with increases in calcium flux and a slight increase in cell size. This afterload-enhanced \u03bcHM system enables mechanical control of \u03bcHM and real-time tissue traction force microscopy for cardiac physiology measurements, providing a dynamic tool for studying pathophysiology and pharmacology.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2021-07-20", "authors": ["JingxuanGuo", "Daniel WSimmons", "GhiskaRamahdita", "Mary KMunsell", "KasoorelopeOguntuyo", "BrennanKandalaft", "BrandonRios", "MissyPear", "DavidSchuftan", "HuanzhuJiang", "Spencer PLake", "Guy MGenin", "NathanielHuebsch"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00318"}

However, quantitative analysis of heterogeneity on cardiac optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is lacking.

Our proposed method applies a dropout-based Monte Carlo sampling technique to measure the model uncertainty. The heterogeneity information is extracted by decoupling the intra/inter-tissue heterogeneity and tissue boundary uncertainty from the uncertainty measurement. We empirically demonstrate that our model can highlight the subtle features from OCT images, and the heterogeneity information extracted is positively correlated with the tissue heterogeneity information from corresponding histology images.", "journal": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

The cardiac damage during VMC is not mainly due to the direct cytotoxic effect of the virus on cardiomyocytes but mostly involves the induction of immune responses. Integrin CD11b plays an important role in immune response, for instance, in the induction of Th17 cells. However, the role of CD11b in the pathogenesis of VMC remains largely unknown. In the present study, a mouse model of VMC was established by CVB3 infection and CD11b was knocked down in the VMC mice by transfection with siRNA-CD11b. The expression of CD11b and IL-17 in heart tissues, frequency of Th17 cells in spleen tissues and serum IL-17 levels were measured using quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and ELISA. Results showed that CVB3 infection caused the pathological changes in heart tissues with the increases in the following indexes: expression of CD11b and IL-17 in heart tissues, frequency of Th17 cells in spleen tissues and serum IL-17 levels. The expression of CD11b was positively correlated with IL-17 expression in heart tissues. Depletion of CD11b attenuated the damage caused by CVB3 and decreased the frequency of Th17 cells in spleen tissues as well as in IL-17, IL-23 and STAT3 expression in heart tissues. In summary, our findings reveal that disruption of CD11b function reduced CVB3-induced myocarditis, suggesting that CD11b may be a novel therapeutic target for VMC.", "journal": "Open life sciences", "date": "2021-04-06", "authors": ["HengWei", "Chong-KaiLin", "Sheng-JianLu", "Yu-XinWen", "ShuaiYuan", "Yan-LiLiu"], "doi": "10.1515/biol-2020-0085"}

Nanomedicine approaches represent a major focus for improving chemotherapy, but have met limited success. To overcome the limitations of chemotherapy drugs, we have developed a novel Single Protein Encapsulation (SPE)-based drug formulation and delivery platform and tested its utility in improving doxorubicin (DOX) treatment. Using this methodology, a series of SPEDOX complexes were generated by encapsulating various numbers of DOX molecules into a single human serum albumin (HSA) molecule. UV/fluorescence spectroscopy, membrane dialysis, and dynamic light scattering techniques showed that SPEDOXs are stable and uniform as monomeric HSA and display unique properties distinct from those of DOX and DOX-HSA mixture. Furthermore, detailed procedures to precisely monitor and control both DOX payload and binding strength to HSA were established. Breast cancer xenograft tumor studies revealed that SPEDOX-6 treatment displays improved pharmacokinetic profiles, higher antitumor efficacy, and lower DOX accumulation in the heart tissue compared with unformulated DOX.

{"title": "Stem cell therapy of myocardial infarction: a promising opportunity in bioengineering.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a life-threatening disease resulting from irreversible death of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and weakening of the heart blood-pumping function. Stem cell-based therapies have been studied for MI treatment over the last two decades with promising outcome. In this review, we critically summarize the past work in this field to elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of treating MI using pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) including both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult stem cells, and cardiac progenitor cells. The main advantage of the latter is their cytokine production capability to modulate immune responses and control the progression of healing. However, human adult stem cells have very limited (if not 'no') capacity to differentiate into functional CMs in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, PSCs can be differentiated into functional CMs although the protocols for the cardiac differentiation of PSCs are mainly for adherent cells under 2D culture. Derivation of PSC-CMs in 3D, allowing for large-scale production of CMs via modulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway with defined chemicals and medium, may be desired for clinical translation. Furthermore, the technology of purification and maturation of the PSC-CMs may need further improvements to eliminate teratoma formation after in vivo implantation of the PSC-CMs for treating MI. In addition, in vitro derived PSC-CMs may have mechanical and electrical mismatch with the patient's cardiac tissue, which causes arrhythmia. This supports the use of PSC-derived cells committed to cardiac lineage without beating for implantation to treat MI. In this case, the PSC derived cells may utilize the mechanical, electrical, and chemical cues in the heart to further differentiate into mature/functional CMs in situ. Another major challenge facing stem cell therapy of MI is the low retention/survival of stem cells or their derivatives (e.g., PSC-CMs) in the heart for MI treatment after injection in vivo. This may be resolved by using biomaterials to engineer stem cells for reduced immunogenicity, immobilization of the cells in the heart, and increased integration with the host cardiac tissue. Biomaterials have also been applied in the derivation of CMs in vitro to increase the efficiency and maturation of differentiation. Collectively, a lot has been learned from the past failure of simply injecting intact stem cells or their derivatives in vivo for treating MI, and bioengineering stem cells with biomaterials is expected to be a valuable strategy for advancing stem cell therapy towards its widespread application for treating MI in the clinic.", "journal": "Advanced therapeutics", "date": "2021-03-06", "authors": ["BinJiang", "LiYan", "James GShamul", "MaxwellHakun", "XiaomingHe"], "doi": "10.1002/adtp.201900182"}
{"title": "Regional Differences in the Ghrelin-Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor Signalling System in Human Heart Disease.", "abstract": "The hormone ghrelin and its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) are expressed in myocardium. GHSR binding activates signalling pathways coupled to cardiomyocyte survival and contractility. These properties have made the ghrelin-GHSR axis a candidate for a biomarker of cardiac function. The dynamics of ghrelin-GHSR are altered significantly in late stages of heart failure (HF) and cardiomyopathy, when left ventricular (LV) function is failing. We examined the relationship of GHSR with ghrelin in cardiac tissue from patients with valvular disease with no detectable changes in LV function.\nBiopsy samples from the left ventricle and left atrium were obtained from 25 patients with valvular disease (of whom 13 also had coronary artery disease) and preserved LV ejection fraction, and compared to control samples obtained via autopsy. Using quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy, levels of GHSR were determined using [Dpr\nA positive correlation between GHSR and ghrelin was apparent in only diseased tissue.

{"title": "Anthocyanin Protects Cardiac Function and Cardiac Fibroblasts From High-Glucose Induced Inflammation and Myocardial Fibrosis by Inhibiting IL-17.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the major causes of death in diabetic patients. Its pathogenesis involves inflammation and fibrosis that damages the heart tissue and impairs cardiac function. Interleukin (IL)-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in a variety of chronic inflammatory processes can serve as an attractive therapeutic target. Anthocyanin, a water-soluble natural pigment, possesses impressive anti-inflammatory activity. However, its role in DCM is unclear. Hence, we investigated the protective effect of anthocyanin on the cardiovascular complications of diabetes using a mouse type 1 diabetes mellitus model induced by streptozotocin. Cardiac function and structural alterations in diabetic mice were tested by echocardiography, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and Masson trichrome staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the distribution and deposition of IL-17 and collagen I and III from the left ventricular tissues of diabetic mice. Cell viability was measured using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. Protein levels of IL-17, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-17 and collagen I and III were detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence, and their mRNA levels were quantified using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We observed that anthocyanin lowered blood glucose, improved cardiac function, and alleviated inflammation and fibrosis in the heart tissue of diabetic mice. Meanwhile, anthocyanin reduced the expression of IL-17 in high-glucose-treated cardiac fibroblasts and exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect. Deposition of collagen I and III was also decreased by anthocyanin, suggesting that anthocyanin contributes to alleviating myocardial fibrosis. In summary, anthocyanin could protect cardiac function and inhibit IL-17-related inflammation and fibrosis, which indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetes mellitus-related complications.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2021-02-20", "authors": ["ErYue", "YahanYu", "XinyaoWang", "BingLiu", "YunlongBai", "BaofengYang"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2020.593633\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.11.064\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03356.x\n10.1016/j.jaut.2012.12.013\n10.1016/j.molmed.2016.01.001\n10.4049/jimmunol.1800189\n10.3390/nu11092107\n10.3390/ijms20143394\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.12.020\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.05.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314665\n10.1002/kjm2.12229\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2015.05.007\n10.1177/0960327112450885\n10.1093/jnci/59.3.941\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304108\n10.1038/cddis.2016.490\n10.1186/s12933-019-0816-2\n10.1007/s10620-019-05969-w\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.863\n10.1007/s00441-018-2974-z\n10.1002/glia.23530\n10.1016/j.jhep.2014.12.011\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03240.x\n10.1016/j.tips.2018.02.010\n10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-15-0091\n10.1016/0022-2828(81)90318-7\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.108874\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00243\n10.1155/2015/728741\n10.2337/db11-0477\n10.1161/01.res.49.6.1268\n10.1016/j.phrs.2012.11.008\n10.1177/1074248419876632\n10.1016/j.jaci.2016.07.025\n10.1002/ptr.6485\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.10.007\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.10.010\n10.1038/s41419-018-1029-4\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.06.026\n10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.223\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.01.001\n10.1007/s00109-014-1176-8\n10.1096/fj.201701242RR\n10.1080/21691401.2019.1687492"}

{"title": "Review on Mechanical Support and Cell-Based Therapies for the Prevention and Recovery of the Failed Fontan-Kreutzer Circulation.", "abstract": "Though the current staged surgical strategy for palliation of single ventricle heart disease, culminating in a Fontan circulation, has increased short-term survival, mounting evidence has shown that the single ventricle, especially a morphologic right ventricle (RV), is inadequate for long-term circulatory support. In addition to high rates of ventricular failure, high central venous pressures (CVP) lead to liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, lymphatic dysfunction, kidney failure, and other comorbidities. In this review, we discuss the complications seen with Fontan physiology, including causes of ventricular and multi-organ failure. We then evaluate the clinical use, results, and limitations of long-term mechanical assist devices intended to reduce RV work and high CVP, as well as biological therapies for failed Fontan circulations.

In addition, fewer researches have considered its influence on cardiomyocyte viability and potential benefits for myocardial tissue remodeling.\nIn this study, stearic acid (SA) (solid lipid) and oleic acid (OA) (liquid lipid) were utilized to produce nanostructured lipid carries (NLCs) (various ratios of SA to OA and water amount, F1: 80:20 [30 ml water], F2: 80:20 [60 ml water], F3: 70:30 [30 ml water], and F4: 70:30 [60 ml water]) containing SP and their particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and release profile were measured. The purpose of encapsulating SP in NLCs was to provide a sustain release system. Meanwhile, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay with different concentrations of SP-loaded NLCs (SP-NLCs) was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the NLCs on rat myocardium cells (H9C2).\nIncrease of oil content to 10 wt% reduced the particle size from 486 nm (F1) to 205 nm (F2). Zeta potential of the samples at around -10 mV indicated their agglomeration tendency. After 48 h, SP-NLCs with the concentrations of 5 and 25 \u03bcM showed significant improvement in cell viability while the same amount of free SP-induced cytotoxic effect on the cells. SP-NLCs with higher concentration (50 \u03bcM) depicted cytotoxic effect on H9C2 cells.\nIt can be concluded that 25 \u03bcM SP-NLCs with sustain release profile had a beneficial effect on cardiomyocytes and can be used as a mean to improve cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of medical signals and sensors", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["MehrzadFalak", "MehdiMehdikhani", "JalehVarshosaz", "BatoolHashemibeni", "MehdiEbrahimian-Hosseinabadi"], "doi": "10.4103/jmss.JMSS_46_19"}

However, the specific mechanism of Arctigenin against myocardial infarction remains largely unknown. Here, both acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (AMI/R) rat model and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced myocardial cell injury model were constructed to explore the underlying role of AMPK/SIRT1 pathway in Arctigenin-mediated effects. The experimental data in our study demonstrated that Arctigenin ameliorated OGD-mediated cardiomyocytes apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, Arctigenin activated AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and downregulated NF-\u03baB phosphorylation in OGD-treated cardiomyocytes, while inhibiting AMPK or SIRT1 by the Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) or SIRT1-IN-1 (a SIRT1 inhibitor) significantly attenuated Arctigenin-exerted protective effects on cardiomyocytes. In the animal experiments, Arctigenin improved the heart functions and decreased infarct size of the AMI/R-rats, accompanied with downregulated oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic levels in the heart tissues. What's more, Arctigenin enhanced the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and repressed NF-\u03baB pathway activation. Taken together, our data indicated that Arctigenin reduced cardiomyocytes apoptosis against AMI/R-induced oxidative stress and inflammation at least via AMPK/SIRT1 pathway.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["Cheng-YinLiu", "YiZhou", "TaoChen", "Jing-ChaoLei", "Xue-JunJiang"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2020.616813\n10.3390/ijms20133153\n10.1371/journal.pone.0217090\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2018.12.005\n10.1038/aps.2018.32\n10.3892/mmr.2018.8482\n10.1002/jcb.25509\n10.1016/j.tcb.2015.10.013\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.07.001\n10.7150/thno.25674\n10.1038/emm.2016.16\n10.1111/j.1939-1676.2012.00905.x\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.11.023\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2020.113302\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243170\n10.1007/s11655-019-3040-810.1007/s11655-019-3040-8\n10.1007/s10571-016-0355-2\n10.1038/s41374-019-0340-8\n10.1248/bpb.b18-00257\n10.1016/j.cbi.2018.01.005\n10.18632/aging.103078\n10.1007/s10753-014-9969-z\n10.1007/s13105-019-00678-4\n10.1002/jcp.29031\n10.2174/1573402111666150529130922\n10.21037/cdt.2020.01.02\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00268\n10.1016/j.jphs.2019.02.008\n10.1007/s10456-020-09720-2\n10.1038/s41434-018-0045-4\n10.1152/ajpheart.00065.2019\n10.1159/000493038\n10.1155/2020/4717258\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.05.003\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.172618\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.062\n10.1042/BSR20194030\n10.3892/mmr.2018.8420\n10.1159/000354532\n10.1007/s00395-019-0773-7\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.02.019\n10.1093/cvr/cvx227\n10.1152/physrev.00026.2013"}

{"title": "A Proteomic Atlas of Cardiac Amyloid Plaques.", "abstract": "In vivo mechanisms of amyloid clearance and cardiac tissue damage in cardiac amyloidosis are not well understood.\nWe aimed to define and quantify the amyloid plaque proteome in cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) and light chain amyloidosis (AL) and identify associations with patient characteristics and outcomes.\nA proteomics approach was used to identify all proteins in cardiac amyloid plaques, and to compare both normal and diseased controls. All proteins identified within amyloid plaques were defined as the expanded proteome; only proteins that were enriched in comparison to normal and disease controls were defined as the amyloid-specific proteome.\nProteomic data from 292 patients with ATTR and 139 patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis were included; 160 and 161 unique proteins were identified in the expanded proteomes, respectively. In the amyloid-specific proteomes, we identified 28 proteins in ATTR, 19 in AL amyloidosis, with 13 proteins overlapping between ATTR and AL. ATTR was characterized by a higher abundance of complement and contractile proteins and AL by a higher abundance of keratins. We found that the proteome of kappa AL had higher levels of clusterin, a protective chaperone, and lower levels of light chains than lambda despite higher levels of circulating light chains. Hierarchical clustering identified a group of patients with worse survival in ATTR, characterized by high levels of PIK3C3, a protein with a central role in autophagy.\nCardiac AL and ATTR have both common and distinct pathogenetic mechanisms of tissue damage. Our findings suggest that autophagy represents a pathway that may be impaired in ATTR and should be further studied.", "journal": "JACC.

{"title": "Twenty-four-hour normothermic perfusion of isolated ex\u00a0vivo hearts using plasma exchange.", "abstract": "Cross-circulation of plasma from a paracorporeal animal allows successful ex\u00a0vivo heart perfusion (EVHP) for 3\u00a0days. Little is known about the feasibility of prolonged EVHP without a paracorporeal animal. These experiments evaluated plasma exchange (PX) that infuses fresh plasma, whereas an equal amount is removed to replace paracorporeal cross-circulation.\nTen hearts were procured from 8 to 10\u00a0kg piglets and maintained with EVHP. The EVHP circuit was primed with platelet- and leukocyte-reduced blood. Plasma obtained from stored porcine blood (4\u00b0C for \u22647\u00a0days) was infused and removed with a plasma separator at 1\u00a0mL/h/g cardiac tissue (n\u00a0=\u00a05) in the PX group. Controls (n\u00a0=\u00a05) used the same EVHP without PX. Antegrade aortic perfusion was adjusted to reach physiologic coronary flow of 0.7 to 1.2\u00a0mL/min/g, normothermia (37\u00b0C), and hemoglobin \u22658\u00a0g/dL. Viability was assessed by hemodynamic metrics, metabolic assays, and histopathology.\nAll PX hearts remained viable for 24\u00a0hours compared with only 1 control (P\u00a0=\u00a0.015). Coronary resistance was higher in the PX versus controls (1.06\u00a0\u00b1 0.06\u00a0mm Hg/mL/min; 0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0mm Hg/mL/min [P\u00a0<\u00a0.05]). Lactate\u00a0levels were lower in PX (2.8-4.2\u00a0mmol/L) versus controls (3.6-7.6\u00a0mmol/L) (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). PX demonstrated a trend toward preservation of left ventricle systolic pressure (63.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.9\u00a0mm Hg) versus controls (37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.0\u00a0mm Hg) (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05). In mixed effect models, oxygen consumption was higher with PX (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Histopathologic evaluation confirmed extensive myocardial degeneration and worse interstitial edema in controls.\nThese results demonstrate that EVHP can be successfully maintained for at least 24\u00a0hours using continuous PX.

{"title": "Alcohol Ablation of Cardiac Tissues Quantified and Evaluated Using CIELAB Euclidean Distances.", "abstract": "Ethanol solubilizes cell membranes, making it useful for various ablation applications. We examined the effect of time and alcohol type on the extent of ablation, quantified as Euclidean distances between color coordinates. We obtained biopsy punch samples (diameter, 6 mm) of left atrial appendage, atrial, ventricular, and septal tissue from porcine hearts and placed them in transwell plates filled with ethanol or methanol for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 min. Control samples were taken for each time point. At each time point, samples were collected, cut transversely, and photographed. With use of a custom MATLAB program, all images were analyzed in the CIELAB color space, which is more perceptually uniform than the red-green-blue color space. Euclidean distances were calculated from CIELAB coordinates. The mean and standard error of these distances were analyzed. Two-way analysis of variance was used to test for differences among time points, and 2-tailed t tests, for differences between the alcohol datasets at each time point. Generally, Euclidean distances differed significantly between all time points, except for those immediately adjacent, and methanol produced larger Euclidean distances than ethanol did. Some tissue showed a plateauing effect, potentially indicating transmurality. Mean Euclidean distances effectively indexed alcohol ablation in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, we found that methanol ablated tissue more effectively than ethanol did. With ethanol, the extent of ablation for atrial tissue was largest at 60 min. We conclude that to achieve full transmurality in clinical applications, ethanol must remain in contact with atrial tissue for at least one hour.", "journal": "Texas Heart Institute journal", "date": "2021-01-21", "authors": ["AshleyRook", "Mathews MJohn", "AllisonPost", "MehdiRazavi"], "doi": "10.14503/THIJ-19-7140"}
{"title": "Early cardiac injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome: comparison of two experimental models.", "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by diffuse lung damage, inflammation, oedema formation, and surfactant dysfunction leading to hypoxemia. Severe ARDS can accelerate the injury of other organs, worsening the patient\u00b4s status. There is an evidence that the lung tissue injury affects the right heart function causing cor pulmonale. However, heart tissue changes associated with ARDS are still poorly known. Therefore, this study evaluated oxidative and inflammatory modifications of the heart tissue in two experimental models of ARDS induced in New Zealand rabbits by intratracheal instillation of neonatal meconium (100 mg/kg) or by repetitive lung lavages with saline (30 ml/kg). Since induction of the respiratory insufficiency, all animals were oxygen-ventilated for next 5 h. Total and differential counts of leukocytes were measured in the arterial blood, markers of myocardial injury [(troponin, creatine kinase - myocardial band (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LD)] in the plasma, and markers of inflammation [tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, interleukin (IL)-6], cardiovascular risk [galectin-3 (Gal-3)], oxidative changes [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT)], and vascular damage [receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)] in the heart tissue. Apoptosis of heart cells was investigated immunohistochemically. In both ARDS models, counts of total leukocytes and neutrophils in the blood, markers of myocardial injury, inflammation, oxidative and vascular damage in the plasma and heart tissue, and heart cell apoptosis increased compared to controls. This study indicates that changes associated with ARDS may contribute to early heart damage what can potentially deteriorate the cardiac function and contribute to its failure.", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2021-01-21", "authors": ["PMikolka", "PKosutova", "SBalentova", "DCierny", "JKopincova", "MKolomaznik", "MAdamkov", "ACalkovska", "DMokra"], "doi": "10.33549/physiolres.934591\n10.1186/s13054-016-1470-7\n10.1016/S0002-9610(97)89552-9\n10.3855/jidc.7585\n10.1002/path.1491\n10.1164/rccm.201002-0250OC\n10.1007/s00431-007-0596-7\n10.1183/16000617.0116-2016\n10.1203/01.PDR.0000082017.97479.39\n10.1016/S2213-2600(18)30429-6\n10.1097/MCC.0b013e3283427295\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.06.013\n10.2119/2007-00130.Flierl\n10.2119/molmed.2010.00138\n10.1186/cc8168\n10.3390/ijms20164004\n10.1089/jamp.2009.0775\n10.1155/2013/691830\n10.1186/s12871-015-0045-5\n10.1186/s12890-019-0803-0\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.04.036\n10.33549/physiolres.933531\n10.33549/physiolres.934047\n10.1080/01902148.2017.1420272\n10.33549/physiolres.934364\n10.1016/j.resp.2014.10.006\n10.1183/09031936.03.00120102\n10.1007/BF02912874\n10.7861/clinmedicine.11-6-615\n10.4021/jocmr761w\n10.1007/s00134-004-2363-9\n10.1001/jama.282.1.54\n10.1378/chest.14-0877\n10.1371/journal.pone.0169190\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040515\n10.1097/MCC.0b013e3282f2405b\n10.1016/j.molimm.2009.12.015\n10.1080/13543784.2020.1699531\n10.1164/ajrccm.157.6.9709092\n10.3978/j.issn.2305-5839.2014.09.10\n10.1080/jmf.16.2.125.130\n10.1089/ars.2007.1940\n10.1159/000486542\n10.1186/s12931-019-1220-x\n10.1165/rcmb.2008-0348TR"}
{"title": "Xanthine oxidase inhibition attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice.", "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that high serum uric acid (UA) is associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Although xanthine oxidase (XO) activation is a critical regulatory mechanism of the terminal step in ATP and purine degradation, the pathophysiological role of cardiac tissue XO in LV dysfunction remains unclear. We herein investigated the role and functional significance of tissue XO activity in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Either doxorubicin (10\u00a0mg/kg) or vehicle was intraperitonially administered in a single injection to mice. Mice were treated with or without oral XO-inhibitors (febuxostat 3\u00a0mg/kg/day or topiroxostat 5\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 8 days starting 24\u00a0h before doxorubicin injection. Cardiac tissue XO activity measured by a highly sensitive assay with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and cardiac UA content were significantly increased in doxorubicin-treated mice at day 7 and dramatically reduced by XO-inhibitors. Accordingly, XO-inhibitors substantially improved LV ejection fraction (assessed by echocardiography) and LV developed pressure (assessed by ex vivo Langendorff heart perfusion) impaired by doxorubicin administration. This was associated with an increase in XO-derived hydrogen peroxide production with concomitant upregulation of apoptotic and ferroptotic pathways, all of which were reduced by XO-inhibitors. Furthermore, metabolome analyses revealed enhanced purine metabolism in doxorubicin-treated hearts, and XO-inhibitors suppressed the serial metabolic reaction of hypoxanthine-xanthine-UA, the paths of ATP and purine degradation. In summary, doxorubicin administration induces cardiac tissue XO activation associated with impaired LV function. XO-inhibitors attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity through inhibition of XO-derived oxidative stress and cell death signals as well as the maintenance of cardiac energy metabolism associated with modulation of the purine metabolic pathway.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2021-01-21", "authors": ["YoshiroTanaka", "TomohisaNagoshi", "AkiraYoshii", "YuheiOi", "HirotakeTakahashi", "HarukaKimura", "KeiichiIto", "YusukeKashiwagi", "Toshikazu DTanaka", "MichihiroYoshimura"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.10.303"}

Scientists have debated various theories regarding how and why flow reversals occur. Here we explore the electrophysiological basis for reversals by simulating action potential propagation in an idealized model of the tubelike tunicate heart. Using asymptotic formulas for action potential duration and conduction velocity, we propose tunicate-specific parameters for a two-current ionic model of the action potential. Then, using a kinematic model, we derive analytical criteria for reversals to occur. These criteria inform subsequent numerical simulations of action potential propagation in a fiber paced at both ends. In particular, we explore the role that variability of pacemaker firing rates plays in generating reversals, and we identify various favorable conditions for triggering retrograde propagation.

However, such scaffolds are hydrophobic and difficult to functionalize. Here, we show that adding 30% of poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) elastomer within PLA leads to PLA:PGS scaffolds with improved biological properties, depending on the processing parameters. Two categories of fibers were produced by blend electrospinning, with diameters of 600 and 1300 nm. The resulting fibers were cured at 90 or 120 \u00b0C to achieve two different cross-linking densities. The designed scaffolds were considered for cytocompatibility, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and chemical and mechanical properties. Our results demonstrated that the presence of PGS increases the hydrophilicity of the material and thus improves surface functionalization by Matrigel or laminin coating, commonly used cell culture matrices. PLA:PGS scaffolds associated with Matrigel or laminin allow an increased material-cell interaction. Moreover, the cardiomyocytes seeded on such scaffolds acquire a morphology similar to that observed in native tissue, the result being more remarkable on fibers having the smallest diameter and the highest PGS cross-linking density. In addition, these scaffolds induce neovascularization without an inflammatory response and foreign body giant cell response after grafting on a mouse heart.

{"title": "Magnetically Active Cardiac Patches as an Untethered, Non-Blood Contacting Ventricular Assist Device.", "abstract": "Patients suffering from heart failure often require circulatory support using ventricular assist devices (VADs). However, most existing VADs provide nonpulsatile flow, involve direct contact between the blood flow and the device's lumen and moving components, and require a driveline to connect to an external power source. These design features often lead to complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, device thrombosis, and driveline infections. Here, a concept of magnetically active cardiac patches (MACPs) that can potentially function as non-blood contacting, untethered pulsatile VADs inside a magnetic actuationsystem is reported. The MACPs, which are composed of permanent magnets and 3D-printed patches, are attached to the epicardial surfaces, thus avoiding direct contact with the blood flow. They provide powerful actuation assisting native heart pumping inside a magnetic actuation system. In ex vivo experiments on a healthy pig's heart, it is shown that the ventricular ejection fractions are as high as 37% in the left ventricle and 63% in the right ventricle.

{"title": "Anisotropic Cardiac Conduction.", "abstract": "Anisotropy is the property of directional dependence. In cardiac tissue, conduction velocity is anisotropic and its orientation is determined by myocyte direction. Cell shape and size, excitability, myocardial fibrosis, gap junction distribution and function are all considered to contribute to anisotropic conduction. In disease states, anisotropic conduction may be enhanced, and is implicated, in the genesis of pathological arrhythmias. The principal mechanism responsible for enhanced anisotropy in disease remains uncertain.

To meet these targets, we presented a novel and robust strategy for sustainable development aiming at the marine pollution via recycling and upgrading the waste biomass-sea squirts and serving as a renewable resource for functional bio-scaffold patch in tissue engineering. We firstly demonstrated that the tunic cellulose derived natural self-conductive scaffolds successfully served as functional cardiac patches, which significantly promote the maturation and spontaneous contraction of cardiomyocytes both in vitro and enhance cardiac function of MI rats in vivo.

{"title": "Methods for isolation and transcriptional profiling of individual cells from the human heart.", "abstract": "Global transcriptional profiling of individual cells represents a powerful approach to systematically survey contributions from cell-specific molecular phenotypes to human disease states but requires tissue-specific protocols. Here we sought to comprehensively evaluate protocols for single cell isolation and transcriptional profiling from heart tissue, focusing particularly on frozen tissue which is necessary for study of human hearts at scale.\nUsing flow cytometry and high-content screening, we found that enzymatic dissociation of fresh murine heart tissue resulted in a sufficient yield of intact cells while for frozen murine or human heart resulted in low-quality cell suspensions across a range of protocols. These findings were consistent across enzymatic digestion protocols and whether samples were snap-frozen or treated with RNA-stabilizing agents before freezing. In contrast, we show that isolation of cardiac nuclei from frozen hearts results in a high yield of intact nuclei, and leverage expression arrays to show that nuclear transcriptomes reliably represent the cytoplasmic and whole-cell transcriptomes of the major cardiac cell types. Furthermore, coupling of nuclear isolation to PCM1-gated flow cytometry facilitated specific cardiomyocyte depletion, expanding resolution of the cardiac transcriptome beyond bulk tissue transcriptomes which were most strongly correlated with PCM1\nOur results confirm the validity of single-nucleus but not single-cell isolation for transcriptional profiling of individual cells from frozen heart tissue, and establishes PCM1-gating as an efficient tool for cardiomyocyte depletion.

Therefore, it has been hypothesized that ginger aqueous extraction can ameliorate labetalol-induced histological, ultrastructural changes, DNA damage, and apoptosis in fetal heart tissue. To achieve the aim of this study, sixty pregnant female albino rats were divided into 4 groups (15 each). Group I (Control). Group II received ginger (200\u00a0mg/kg). Group III received labetalol (300\u00a0mg/kg). Group IV received labetalol first followed by ginger. All groups were orally injected daily during the organogenesis phase of gestation i.e., from the 6th to the 15th day, and sacrificed at the 20th day of gestation. Results showed that labetalol-induced marked histological and ultrastructural alterations. Also, there was severe DNA damage and an increase in the apoptotic rates determined by Annexin-V/PI dual staining assay.

The heart is a vital organ which supplies nutrients and oxygen to all parts of the body. Heart failure (HF) has been conventionally described as a disease associated with cardiac tissue damage caused by systemic inflammation, arrhythmia and conduction defects. Cardiac inflammation and subsequent tissue damage is orchestrated by the infiltration and activation of various immune cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, natural killer cells, and T and B cells into the myocardium. After tissue injury, monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes, and function as key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration and fibrosis. Disturbance in resident macrophage functions such as uncontrolled production of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and inefficient generation of an anti-inflammatory response or unsuccessful communication between macrophages and epithelial and endothelial cells and fibroblasts can lead to aberrant repair, persistent injury, and HF.

{"title": "Tuning multilayered polymeric self-standing films for controlled release of L-lactate by electrical stimulation.", "abstract": "We examine different approaches for the controlled release of L-lactate, which is a signaling molecule that participates in tissue remodeling and regeneration, such as cardiac and muscle tissue. Robust, flexible, and self-supported 3-layers films made of two spin-coated poly(lactic acid) (PLA) layers separated by an electropolymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) layer, are used as loading and delivery systems. Films with outer layers prepared using homochiral PLA and with nanoperforations of diameter 146 \u00b1 70 experience more bulk erosion, which also contributes to the release of L-lactic acid, than those obtained using heterochiral PLA and with nanoperforations of diameter 66 \u00b1 24. Moreover, the release of L-lactic acid as degradation product is accelerated by applying biphasic electrical pulses. The four approaches used for loading extra L-lactate in the 3-layered films were: incorporation of L-lactate at the intermediate PEDOT layer as primary dopant agent using (1) organic or (2) basic water solutions as reaction media; (3) substitution at the PEDOT layer of the ClO", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2021-01-04", "authors": ["AnnaPuiggal\u00ed-Jou", "Jes\u00fasOrdo\u00f1o", "Luis JDel Valle", "SoledadP\u00e9rez-Amodio", "ElisabethEngel", "CarlosAlem\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.12.049"}

Engineered cardiac patches represent valuable tools for myocardial repair following infarction and are generally constituted of a suitable biomaterial populated by CMs and supportive cell types. Among those, ECs are required for tissue vascularization and positively modulate CM function. To direct the function of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived CM and EC seeded on biomaterials, we replicated cell-collagen interactions, which regulate cellular behaviour in the native myocardium, using triple-helical peptides (THPs) that are ligands for collagen-binding proteins. THPs enhanced proliferation and activity of CMs and ECs separately and in co-culture, drove CM maturation and enabled coordinated cellular contraction on collagen films. These results highlight the importance of collagen interactions on cellular response and establish THP-functionalized biomaterials as novel tools to produce engineered cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2021-01-02", "authors": ["MariaColzani", "Jean-DanielMalcor", "Emma JHunter", "SemihBayraktar", "MurrayPolkinghorne", "ThomasKrieg", "RuthCameron", "SerenaBest", "Richard WFarndale", "SanjaySinha"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120612\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.07.054\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.09.010\n10.1007/s00246-011-9888-9\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.010\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.1038/s41551-018-0271-5\n10.1038/s41598-017-09217-x\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.143149\n10.1016/j.addr.2013.12.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1271/bbb.63.2144\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.07.034\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.006\n10.1074/jbc.M210313200\n10.1074/jbc.275.1.35\n10.1016/j.matbio.2010.10.004\n10.1074/jbc.M301370200\n10.1073/pnas.1112388109\n10.1074/jbc.M710001200\n10.1073/pnas.0808452105\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.044\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.07.050\n10.1038/s41587-019-0197-9\n10.1242/dev.143438\n10.1371/journal.pone.0150323\n10.1096/fasebj.14.5.669\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1002/jcp.25312\n10.1111/jcmm.12027\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.006\n10.1098/rstb.2007.2121\n10.1038/nmat2316\n10.1042/BST0360241\n10.1039/c2sm25903f\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.04.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.06.001\n10.1002/ijc.23216\n10.1073/pnas.91.8.3448\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.036509\n10.1242/dev.119271\n10.1038/ncb3205\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.06.006\n10.1074/jbc.M004111200"}
{"title": "Molecular docking analyses of Escin as regards cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity: In vivo and in Silico studies.", "abstract": "This study aims to investigate whether Escin (ES) can protect against Cyclophosphamide (CPM)-induced cardiac damage. The experimental rats were categorized as Control, CPM (200\u00a0mg/kg), ES (10\u00a0mg/kg), and CPM\u00a0+\u00a0ES Groups, each having 6 members. Their heart tissues were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and the structural changes were investigated under the light microscope. The biochemical markers of ischemia modified albumin (IMA), creatine kinase (CK-MB), antioxidant activity indicators Catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were measured using blood samples. Besides, the effects of CPM, ES, and CPM\u00a0+\u00a0ES upon CAT and SOD activities were shown via molecular docking studies. In the Single-Dose CPM group, CK-MB and IMA levels significantly increased while SOD and CAT levels significantly decreased. However, the heart tissues were damaged. CK-MB and IMA levels significantly decreased in CP+ ES Group. On the other hand, SOD, and CAT levels significantly increased and reduced the damage remarkably. Our findings showed that ES treatment successfully reduced the toxic effects upon the rats. The conclusion is that ES treatment can help protect the heart tissue against CPM-induced toxicity.

{"title": "Piperine Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis of Human Gastric Cancer Cells by Downregulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)/Akt Pathway.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Piperine has been reported to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in various cancer cells. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and underlying mechanism of piperine in human gastric cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of piperine (concentrations of 0-300 \u03bcM) on the proliferation of human gastric cancer SNU-16 cells and normal human gastric epithelial GES-1 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot were used to determine cell apoptosis and the expression level of protein (Cyto C, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, Bad, Bcl-xl, PI3K, pPI3K, Akt, and pAkt), respectively. To further investigate the anti-tumor mechanism of piperine in SNU-16 cells, we used a small-molecule Akt activator SC79 in this study. The in vivo mechanism of piperine against gastric cancer was evaluated using a xenograft tumor model. RESULTS The results showed that piperine inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of SNU-16 cells. Piperine upregulated the protein expression of Bax, Bad, Cyto C, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-3, but downregulated the protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, pPI3k, and pAkt. However, SC79 reversed the function of piperine on the apoptosis-related proteins. An in vivo study revealed that, compared with the control group, the tumor volume of mice treated with piperine was significantly reduced. Piperine enhanced cleaved caspase-3 expression but decreased Ki-67 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the nontoxicity effect of piperine was confirmed by H&E staining analysis in kidney and heart tissues of mice. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that piperine inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "date": "2021-01-01", "authors": ["HanyuChen", "HongqingSheng", "YushuoZhao", "GuanghuiZhu"], "doi": "10.12659/MSM.928403"}
{"title": "Cardiovascular aspects of COVID-19.", "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a pulmonary disease, but also affects the cardiovascular system in multiple ways. In this review, we will summarise and put into perspective findings and debates relating to the diverse aspects of cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19. We will review evidence for the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the risk of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 susceptibility and course, and the mechanism of acute and long-term myocardial injury. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses membrane-bound angiotensin converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry. ACE2 is part of an important counter-regulatory circuit antagonising the harmful effects of angiotensin II on lung and heart. Modulation of ACE2 may therefore affect disease susceptibility and disease course. However, observational clinical studies and one randomised trial have so far not yielded evidence for harmful or beneficial effects of blockers of the RAAS during COVID-19. Age, gender, and multi-morbidity all increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases do so only minimally, but they may aggravate the disease course. Direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the heart tissue and myocytes is rare. Nevertheless, COVID-19 may lead to myocarditis-like acute cardiac injury, characterised by myocardial oedema, but lacking extensive myocyte loss and lymphocytic infiltration. Independent of this, increases in cardiac biomarkers (troponin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, D-dimer) are frequent, especially in the phase of severe systemic inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and quantitatively associated with poor outcome. The pulmonary infection may result initially in right ventricular dysfunction, but in cases with severe systemic infection hypoxia, hyperinflammation and cytokine storm heart failure may eventually ensue. Unlike other infections and inflammatory states, COVID-19 does not appear to trigger acute coronary syndromes. In children, even mild COVID-19 can induce a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with Kawasaki-like symptoms frequently accompanied by cardiogenic shock.", "journal": "Swiss medical weekly", "date": "2021-01-01", "authors": ["David J.Kurz", "Franz RobertEberli"], "doi": "10.4414/smw.2020.20417"}
{"title": "Composite Backward Differentiation Formula for the Bidomain Equations.", "abstract": "The bidomain equations have been widely used to model the electrical activity of cardiac tissue. While it is well-known that implicit methods have much better stability than explicit methods, implicit methods usually require the solution of a very large nonlinear system of equations at each timestep which is computationally prohibitive. In this work, we present two fully implicit time integration methods for the bidomain equations: the backward Euler method and a second-order one-step two-stage composite backward differentiation formula (CBDF2) which is an L-stable time integration method. Using the backward Euler method as fundamental building blocks, the CBDF2 scheme is easily implementable. After solving the nonlinear system resulting from application of the above two fully implicit schemes by a nonlinear elimination method, the obtained nonlinear global system has a much smaller size, whose Jacobian is symmetric and possibly positive definite. Thus, the residual equation of the approximate Newton approach for the global system can be efficiently solved by standard optimal solvers. As an alternative, we point out that the above two implicit methods combined with operator splittings can also efficiently solve the bidomain equations. Numerical results show that the CBDF2 scheme is an efficient time integration method while achieving high stability and accuracy.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-01-01", "authors": ["XindanGao", "Craig SHenriquez", "WenjunYing"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2020.591159\n10.1007/BF02446967\n10.1360/SSPMA2013-00100\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.275.1.H301\n10.1080/10255842.2011.554410\n10.1098/rstb.1985.0001\n10.1109/TBME.2004.834275\n10.1111/j.1365-246X.1997.tb00998.x\n10.1080/10255840903067072\n10.1063/1.166300\n10.1007/b98841\n10.1137/S106482759325154X\n10.1090/S0025-5718-96-00748-X\n10.1002/nla.381\n10.1109/TBME.2006.880875\n10.1109/10.784149\n10.1137/1.9780898718003\n10.1016/j.mbs.2005.01.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.00794.2003\n10.1016/j.jcp.2003.11.014\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.07.012\n10.1007/s10439-007-9337-3\n10.1109/TBME.2006.879425\n10.1109/TBME.2008.925673"}
{"title": "Stability of spatially discordant repolarization alternans in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiac alternans, a period-2 behavior of excitation and contraction of the heart, is a precursor of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. One form of alternans is repolarization or action potential duration alternans. In cardiac tissue, repolarization alternans can be spatially in-phase, called spatially concordant alternans, or spatially out-of-phase, called spatially discordant alternans (SDA). In SDA, the border between two out-of-phase regions is called a node in a one-dimensional cable or a nodal line in a two-dimensional tissue. In this study, we investigate the stability and dynamics of the nodes and nodal lines of repolarization alternans driven by voltage instabilities. We use amplitude equation and coupled map lattice models to derive theoretical results, which are compared with simulation results from the ionic model. Both conduction velocity restitution induced SDA and non-conduction velocity restitution induced SDA are investigated. We show that the stability and dynamics of the SDA nodes or nodal lines are determined by the balance of the tensions generated by conduction velocity restitution, convection due to action potential propagation, curvature of the nodal lines, and repolarization and coupling heterogeneities.

However, simultaneously acquiring multi-color fluorescence images require additional optical elements and devices, which are bulky, wavelength specific, and not cost-effective. In this paper, wavelength-coded volume holographic gratings (WC-VHGs) based optical sectioning fluorescence microscopy is proposed to simultaneously offer multi-color fluorescence images with fine out-of-focus background rejection. Due to wavelength degeneracy, multiplexed WC-VHGs are capable of acquiring multi-wavelength fluorescence images in a single shot, and displaying the laterally separated multi-wavelength images onto CCD. In our system optical sectioning capability is achieved through speckle illumination and HiLo imaging method.

In the absence of an effective treatment, different drugs with unknown effectiveness, including antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), with or without concurrent administration with azithromycin (AZM), have been tested for treating COVID-19 patients with developed pneumonia. However, the efficacy and safety of HCQ and/or AZM have been questioned by recent clinical reports. Direct effects of these drugs on the human heart remain very poorly defined. To better understand the mechanisms of action of HCQ +/- AZM, we employed bioengineered human ventricular cardiac tissue strip (hvCTS) and anisotropic sheet (hvCAS) assays, made with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hvCMs), which have been designed for measuring cardiac contractility and electrophysiology, respectively. Our hvCTS experiments showed that AZM induced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect which could be aggravated by HCQ; electrophysiologically, as revealed by the hvCAS platform, AZM prolonged action potentials and induced spiral wave formations. Collectively, our data were consistent with reported clinical risks of HCQ and AZM on QTc prolongation/ventricular arrhythmias and development of heart failure. In conclusion, our study exposed the risks of HCQ/AZM administration while providing mechanistic insights for their toxicity. Our bioengineered human cardiac tissue constructs therefore provide a useful platform for screening cardiac safety and efficacy when developing therapeutics against COVID-19.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2020-12-30", "authors": ["Andy On-TikWong", "BimalGurung", "Wing SumWong", "Suet YeeMak", "Wan WaiTse", "Chloe MLi", "Deborah KLieu", "Kevin DCosta", "Ronald ALi", "Roger JHajjar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.12.014"}
{"title": "The protective effect of the cardiac thioredoxin system on the heart in the case of iron overload in mice.", "abstract": "Iron, which is essential for many vital biological processes, causes significant clinical pathologies in the case of its deficiency or excess. Cardiovascular protective pathways are activated by iron therapy. However, determining the appropriate iron concentration is essential to protect heart tissue from iron-induced oxidative stress. The thioredoxin system is one of the antioxidant systems that protect cells against oxidative stress. Moreover, it allows the binding of many transcription factors for apoptosis, myocardial protection, the stimulation of cell proliferation, and angiogenesis processes, especially the regulation of the cardiovascular system. This study's goal was to understand how iron overload affects the gene and protein levels of the thioredoxin system in the mouse heart.\nBALB/c mice were randomly separated into two groups. The iron overload group was administered with intraperitoneal injections of an iron-dextran solution twice a week for three weeks. In parallel, the control group was intraperitoneally given Dextran 5 solution. The total iron content, the total GSH level, the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio, and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) activity were demonstrated spectroscopically. Changes in the iron metabolism marker genes and thioredoxin system genes were examined by qPCR. The quantitative protein expression of TXNRD1 and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) was examined by western blotting.\nThe iron content of the heart increased in the iron overload group. The expression of hepcidin (Hamp) and ferroportin (Fpn) increased with iron overload. However, decreased expression was observed for ferritin (Fth). No changes were revealed in the GSH level and GSH/GSSG ratio. The gene expression of thioredoxin 1 (Txn1), Txnrd1, and Txnip did not change. TXNRD1 activity and protein expression increased significantly, while the protein expression of TXNIP decreased significantly.\nIn the case of iron overload, the cardiac thioredoxin system is affected by the protein level rather than the gene level.

Cardiac tissue sections were analyzed to determine collagen deposition in the left ventricular free wall (anterior, lateral, and posterior portions), interventricular septum, and right ventricle. Within the iMVP-SCD cases, the endocardial-to-epicardial distribution of fibrosis within the left ventricle was specifically characterized.\nSeventeen cases with iMVP-SCD were matched 1:1 with 17 controls, yielding 149 samples and 1788 histologic regions. The iMVP-SCD group had increased left ventricular (anterior, lateral, and posterior; all P <.001) and interventricular septum fibrosis (P <.001), but similar amounts of right ventricular fibrosis (P = .62) compared to controls. In iMVP-SCD, left ventricular fibrosis was significantly higher in the lateral and posterior walls compared to the anterior wall and interventricular septum (all P <.001). Within the lateral and posterior walls, iMVP-SCD cases had a significant endocardial-to-epicardial gradient of cardiac fibrosis (P <.01) similar to other known conditions that cause cardiac remodeling.\nOur study indicates that nonuniform left ventricular remodeling with both localized and generalized left ventricular fibrosis is important in the pathogenesis of SCD in individuals with MVP.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2020-12-29", "authors": ["Hui-ChenHan", "Sarah AParsons", "Claire LCurl", "Andrew WTeh", "Antonia J ARaaijmakers", "Anoop NKoshy", "TrisheLeong", "Louise MBurrell", "DavidO'Donnell", "Jitendra KVohra", "Jonathan MKalman", "PrashanthanSanders", "David LHare", "OmarFarouque", "Lea M DDelbridge", "Han SLim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.12.021"}

Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are inert chemicals with good biocompatibility, and unique physico-chemical properties that have recently led to their applications in numerous fields. In this study, we combined the advantages of protein-phospholipid complexes and PFC emulsions and then synthesized protein-loaded PFC nanoemulsions (PNEs) to test whether, after inhalation, these nanoemulsions could deliver therapeutic proteins to the heart. After preparing protein-phospholipid complexes by lyophilization, we obtained PNEs by extrusion. The particle size and surface charge of PNEs were about 140 nm and -50 mV, respectively. In vitro results showed that the PNEs had a fine particle fraction of 35% and exhibited sustained protein release. Translocation studies were done using three types of pulmonary epithelial cells, and ~7% translocation was observed in the Calu-3 cell line. Further, they were easily absorbed by cells and had therapeutic effects in culture. In vivo results showed that the PNEs successfully delivered proteins to the myocardial tissue of rats and reduced ischemic myocardial injury caused by acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

{"title": "miRNAs may play a major role in the control of gene expression in key pathobiological processes in Chagas disease cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Chronic Chagas disease cardiomyopathy (CCC), an especially aggressive inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy caused by lifelong infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of cardiomyopathy in Latin America. Although chronic myocarditis may play a major pathogenetic role, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for its severity. The aim of this study is to study the genes and microRNAs expression in tissues and their connections in regards to the pathobiological processes. To do so, we integrated for the first time global microRNA and mRNA expression profiling from myocardial tissue of CCC patients employing pathways and network analyses. We observed an enrichment in biological processes and pathways associated with the immune response and metabolism. IFN\u03b3, TNF and NFkB were the top upstream regulators. The intersections between differentially expressed microRNAs and differentially expressed target mRNAs showed an enrichment in biological processes such as Inflammation, inflammation, Th1/IFN-\u03b3-inducible genes, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and mitochondrial/oxidative stress/antioxidant response. MicroRNAs also played a role in the regulation of gene expression involved in the key cardiomyopathy-related processes fibrosis, hypertrophy, myocarditis and arrhythmia.

In continuation of our previous work, the present study was envisaged to explore the key regulators responsible for cardiac damage associated with chronic seizures using whole transcriptome and proteome analysis in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy.\nA standard lithium-pilocarpine protocol was used to induce recurrent seizures in rats. The isolated rat heart tissue was subjected to transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. An integrated approach of RNA-Seq, proteomics, and system biology analysis was used to identify key regulators involved in seizure-linked cardiac changes. The analyzed differential expression patterns and network interactions were supported by gene and protein expression studies.\nAltogether, 1157 differentially expressed genes and 1264 proteins were identified in the cardiac tissue of epileptic animals through RNA-Seq and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, respectively. The network analysis revealed seven critical genes-STAT3, Myc, Fos, Erbb2, Erbb3, Notch1,\u00a0and\u00a0Mapk8-that could play a role in seizure-mediated cardiac changes. The LC-MS/MS analysis supported the activation of the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway in the heart of epileptic animals.

The rats in the sham-operation group only underwent thoracotomy, without myocardial infarction injury. Meanwhile, the rats in model group and miR-204 mimics group were utilized to establish the models of myocardial infarction, and then, intervened with normal saline and miR-204 mimics, respectively. The morphology of myocardial tissues was observed via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect the expression of Caspase-3. Target genes of miR-204 were analyzed using bioanalysis software. Western blotting (WB) assay was applied to measure the relative protein expression of SIRT1. MiR-204 expression and the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of SIRT1 and p53 were measured via quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Furthermore, cell apoptosis was determined through terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay.\nHE staining showed that the morphology of myocardial tissues was normal in sham-operation group. Severe myocardial tissue injury was visible in model group, and the injury was relieved in miR-204 mimics group when compared with model group. The results manifested that the positive expression of Caspase-3 in cardiac tissues increased remarkably in the model group and miR-204 mimics group in comparison with sham-operation group (p<0.05). Meanwhile, it was evidently lower in miR-204 mimics group than model group (p<0.05). Based on the analysis via bioanalysis software, SIRT1 was the target gene of miR-204. WB results revealed that the relative protein expression level of SIRT1 was elevated notably in the other two groups compared with the 2sham-operation group (p<0.05). However, it was markedly lowered in miR-204 mimics group in contrast with model group (p<0.05). QRT-PCR results demonstrated that the model group and miR-204 mimics group exhibited distinctly lower expression of miR-204 but higher mRNA expressions of SIRT1 and p53 than sham-operation group (p<0.05). However, miR-204 mimics group exhibited prominently higher expression of miR-204 but lower mRNA expressions of SIRT1 and p53 than model group (p<0.05). Finally, the results of TUNEL assay demonstrated that the apoptosis rate increased remarkably in the model group and miR-204 mimics group when compared with sham-operation group (p<0.05).

The group without STZ treatment was given placebo as a control group. The experiment lasted 70 days. The histology of myocardium and biomarkers of antioxidants, myocardial injury, pro-inflammatory cytokines, pro-apoptotic proteins and phosphorylation of key proteins in PI3K/AKT pathway were assessed.\nBiochemical analysis showed that GLS treatment significantly reduced the blood glucose (-20.3%) and triglyceride (-20.4%) levels compared to diabetic group without treatment. GLS treatment decreased the content of MDA (-25.6%) and activity of lactate dehydrogenase (-18.9%) but increased the activity of GSH-Px (65.4%). Western blot analysis showed that GLS treatment reduced the expression of both alpha-smooth muscle actin and brain natriuretic peptide. Histological analysis on the cardiac tissue micrographs showed that GLS treatment reduced collagen fibrosis and glycogen reactivity in myocardium. Both Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that GLS treatment decreased the expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors (cytokines IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1) as well as apoptosis regulatory proteins (Bax, caspase-3 and -9), but increased Bcl-2. Moreover, GLS treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in PI3K/AKT pathway, eg, p-AKT p-PI3K and mTOR.\nThe results indicated that GLS treatment alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy by reducing hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and further attenuating the fibrosis and myocardial dysfunction induced by STZ through stimulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.", "journal": "Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy", "date": "2020-12-19", "authors": ["FahmiShaher", "ShuqiuWang", "HongbinQiu", "YuHu", "YuZhang", "WeiqunWang", "HishamAl-Ward", "Mahfoudh A MAbdulghani", "SalemBaldi", "ShaoboZhou"], "doi": "10.2147/DMSO.S281527\n10.1016/j.diabres.2018.02.023\n10.1016/0002-9149(72)90595-4\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.2011.03535.x\n10.2337/db08-0329\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn156\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.07.033\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.07.129\n10.1007/s11154-010-9131-7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.014\n10.1371/journal.pone.0134139\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.01.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052013\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1469\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000143096.15099.ce\n10.18632/oncotarget.3131\n10.2174/138920109789978757\n10.1016/j.intimp.2009.06.005\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970317)70:6<699::AID-IJC12>3.0.CO;2-5\n10.1002/ptr.2650060604\n10.1248/cpb.29.3611\n10.1371/journal.pone.0047873\n10.1186/s12944-015-0045-y\n10.1007/s11010-006-9409-y\n10.1371/journal.pone.0061687\n10.1016/j.bcp.2014.01.040\n10.1016/j.carres.2012.02.029\n10.1016/S0008-6215(01)00075-1\n10.1248/cpb.50.623\n10.1271/bbb.65.2384\n10.1016/S0031-9422(01)00450-2\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.07.017\n10.1016/j.carres.2007.12.004\n10.1016/j.lfs.2005.07.017\n10.1055/s-2006-962057\n10.1055/s-2007-969507\n10.1016/S0031-9422(00)83748-6\n10.1124/jpet.118.248369\n10.1016/j.jim.2018.03.004\n10.3892/etm.2015.2759\n10.2147/DDDT.S109287\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60471-6\n10.1515/CCLM.2000.027\n10.1097/MD.0000000000002776\n10.1016/j.febslet.2009.11.022\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101339\n10.1136/bmj.328.7439.585\n10.12659/MSMBR.907162\n10.1186/s12967-014-0364-1\n10.1089/ars.2011.4313\n10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311448\n10.1136/hrt.2005.068270\n10.1096/fj.05-4095fje\n10.1007/s11010-015-2483-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.14.1382\n10.1161/01.RES.81.4.627\n10.1007/s00395-007-0673-0\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.02.021\n10.1254/jphs.10047FP\n10.1126/science.275.5303.1129\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.017\n10.1242/dev.137075"}
{"title": "Mechanisms of Premature Ventricular Complexes Caused by QT Prolongation.", "abstract": "QT prolongation, due to lengthening of the action potential duration in the ventricles, is a major risk factor of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. A widely known consequence of QT prolongation is the genesis of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are associated with arrhythmias through the generation of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). However, the vast majority of the EADs observed experimentally in isolated ventricular myocytes are phase-2 EADs, and whether phase-2 EADs are mechanistically linked to PVCs in cardiac tissue remains an unanswered question. In this study, we investigate the genesis of PVCs using computer simulations with eight different ventricular action potential models of various species. Based on our results, we classify PVCs as arising from two distinct mechanisms: repolarization gradient (RG)-induced PVCs and phase-2 EAD-induced PVCs. The RG-induced PVCs are promoted by increasing RG and L-type calcium current and are insensitive to gap junction coupling. EADs are not required for this PVC mechanism. In a paced beat, a single or multiple PVCs can occur depending on the properties of the RG. In contrast, phase-2 EAD-induced PVCs occur only when the RG is small and are suppressed by increasing RG and more sensitive to gap junction coupling. Unlike with RG-induced PVCs, in each paced beat, only a single EAD-induced PVC can occur no matter how many EADs in an action potential. In the wide parameter ranges we explore, RG-induced PVCs can be observed in all models, but the EAD-induced PVCs can only be observed in five of the eight models. The links between these two distinct PVC mechanisms and arrhythmogenesis in animal experiments and clinical settings are discussed.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2020-12-18", "authors": ["ZhaoyangZhang", "Michael BLiu", "XiaodongHuang", "ZhenSong", "ZhilinQu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2020.12.001"}

Hearts were irradiated in vivo with a single 2 Gy dose during the resveratrol administration and metabolite profiles of heart tissue were analyzed by the untargeted HR-MAS NMR approach twenty weeks after irradiation. The administration of resveratrol mitigated the radiation-induced decline in the content of choline-containing compounds and unsaturated lipids, which might reflect the stabilization of cell membrane structure against radiation-related damage. Results obtained with this mouse model suggest that the resveratrol supplementation may prevent metabolic changes related to radiation-induced damage in the heart.", "journal": "Acta biochimica Polonica", "date": "2020-12-18", "authors": ["MichalinaGramatyka", "PiotrWid\u0142ak", "DorotaGabry\u015b", "RolandKulik", "MariaSok\u00f3\u0142"], "doi": "10.18388/abp.2020_5403"}

As one of the most outstanding technology, cardiac patches hold the potential to restore cardiac function clinically. Consisted of two components: therapeutic ingredients and substrate scaffolds, the fabrication of cardiac patches requires both advanced bioactive molecules and biomaterials. In this review, we will present the most state-of-the-art cardiac patches and analysis their compositional details.

{"title": "VDAC1 in the diseased myocardium and the effect of VDAC1-interacting compound on atrial fibrosis induced by hyperaldosteronism.", "abstract": "The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a key player in mitochondrial function. VDAC1 serves as a gatekeeper mediating the fluxes of ions, nucleotides, and other metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane, as well as the release of apoptogenic proteins initiating apoptotic cell death. VBIT-4, a VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor, was recently shown to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, as validated in mouse models of lupus and type-2 diabetes. In the present study, we explored the expression of VDAC1 in the diseased myocardium of humans and rats. In addition, we evaluated the effect of VBIT-4 treatment on the atrial structural and electrical remodeling of rats exposed to excessive aldosterone levels. Immunohistochemical analysis of commercially available human cardiac tissues revealed marked overexpression of VDAC1 in post-myocardial infarction patients, as well as in patients with chronic ventricular dilatation\\dysfunction. In agreement, rats exposed to myocardial infarction or to excessive aldosterone had a marked increase of VDAC1 in both ventricular and atrial tissues. Immunofluorescence staining indicated a punctuated appearance typical for mitochondrial-localized VDAC1. Finally, VBIT-4 treatment attenuated the atrial fibrotic load of rats exposed to excessive aldosterone without a notable effect on the susceptibility to atrial fibrillation episodes induced by burst pacing. Our results indicate that VDAC1 overexpression is associated with myocardial abnormalities in common pathological settings.

A totally new approach for scaffold functionalization with peptides is based on Molecular Imprinting technology. In this work, imprinted particles with recognition properties toward laminin and fibronectin bioactive moieties were synthetized and used for the functionalization of biomimetic sponges, which were based on a blend of alginate, gelatin, and elastin. Functionalized sponges underwent a complete morphological, physicochemical, mechanical, functional, and biological characterization. Micrographs of functionalized sponges showed a highly porous structure and a quite homogeneous distribution of imprinted particles on their surface. Infrared and thermal analyses pointed out the presence of interactions between blend components. Biodegradation and mechanical properties appeared adequate for the aimed application. The results of recognition tests showed that the deposition on sponges did not alter the specific recognition and binding behavior of imprinted particles.

{"title": "Graphene-based materials enhance cardiomyogenic and angiogenic differentiation capacity of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro - Focus on cardiac tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Cell-based therapies have recently emerged as promising strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising cell type that represent a class of adult stem cells characterized by multipotency, high proliferative capacity, paracrine activity, and low immunogenicity. To improve the functional and therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, novel biomaterials are considered as scaffolds/surfaces that promote MSCs growth and differentiation. One of them are graphene-based materials, including graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Due to the unique physical, chemical, and biological properties of graphene, scaffolds comprising GO/rGO have been examined as novel platforms to improve the differentiation potential of human MSCs in vitro. We verified different i) size of GO flakes, ii) reduction level, and iii) layer thickness to select the most suitable artificial niche for MSCs culture. The results revealed that graphene-based substrates constitute non-toxic substrates for MSCs. Surfaces with large flakes of GO as well as low reduced rGO are the most biocompatible for MSCs propagation and do not affect their proliferation and survival. Interestingly, small GO flakes and highly reduced rGO decreased MSCs proliferation and induced their apoptosis. We also found that GO and rGO substrates did not alter the MSCs phenotype, cell cycle progression and might modulate the adhesive capabilities of these cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that both materials promoted the cardiomyogenic and angiogenic differentiation capacity of MSCs in vitro. Thus, our data indicates that graphene-based surfaces represent promising materials that may influence the therapeutic application of MSCs via supporting their pro-regenerative potential.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

In this regard, a series of thermosensitive and injectable hydrogels with similar physicomechanical properties of cardiac tissue can be an ideal candidate for delivering human unrestricted somatic stem cells (hUSSCs) and improve the quality of cell therapy. Here, we designed N-isopropylacrylamide/acrylic acid/N-acryloxysuccinimide/2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-poly lactide (NIPAAm/AAc/NAS/HEMAPLA) hydrogel via ring-opening polymerization for encapsulation of the cells. To improve biological activities, biomaterials like hyaluronic acid (HA), Aloe vera (AV), and silk fibroin (SF) were added with pure hydrogel (Pgel). The modulus of hydrogels was estimated between 68.1 and 74.63\u202fkPa that was similar to the normal cardiac modulus. Moreover, the elastic region increased by adding biomaterials to Pgel. The results of RT-PCR and ICC demonstrated that the most expression of early genes (GATA4, NKX2.5) was related to Pgel/AV/SF group. In contrast, the highest expression of other genes (GJA1, TNNI3, MYH6) was observed in Pgel/HA/SF. The presence of biomaterials in the structure of hydrogel can play a key role in cell fate and the induction of cell differentiation as a factor influencing mechanotransduction.

{"title": "Comparison of chloroquine-like molecules for lysosomal inhibition and measurement of autophagic flux in the brain.", "abstract": "Measurement of autophagic flux in\u00a0vivo is critical to understand how autophagy can be used to combat disease. Neurodegenerative diseases have a special relationship with autophagy, which makes measurement of autophagy in the brain a significant research priority. Currently, measurement of autophagic flux is possible through use of transgenic constructs, or application of a lysosomal inhibitor such as chloroquine. Unfortunately, chloroquine is not useful for measuring autophagic flux in the brain and the use of transgenic animals necessitates cross-breeding of transgenic strains and maintenance of lines, which is costly. To find a drug that could block lysosomal function in the brain for the measurement of autophagic flux, we selected compounds from the literature that appeared to have similar properties to chloroquine and tested their ability to inhibit autophagic flux in cell culture and in mice. These chemicals included chloroquine, quinacrine, mefloquine, promazine and trifluoperazine. As expected, chloroquine blocked lysosomal degradation of the autophagic protein LC3B-II in cell culture. Quinacrine also inhibited autophagic flux in cell culture. Other compounds tested were not effective. When injected into mice, chloroquine caused accumulation of LC3B-II in heart tissue, and quinacrine was effective at blocking LC3B-II degradation in male, but not female skeletal muscle. None of the compounds tested were useful for measuring autophagic flux in the brain. During this study we also noted that the vehicle DMSO powerfully up-regulated LC3B-II abundance in tissues. This study shows that chloroquine and quinacrine can both be used to measure autophagic flux in cells, and in some peripheral tissues. However, measurement of flux in the brain using lysosomal inhibitors remains an unresolved research challenge.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2020-12-15", "authors": ["C\u00e9liaFourrier", "ValerieBryksin", "KathrynHattersley", "Leanne KHein", "JulienBensalem", "Timothy JSargeant"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.12.008"}
{"title": "Optimizing Anisotropic Polyurethane Scaffolds to Mechanically Match with Native Myocardium.", "abstract": "Biodegradable cardiac patch is desirable to possess mechanical properties mimicking native myocardium for heart infarction treatment. We fabricated a series of anisotropic and biodegradable polyurethane porous scaffolds via thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) and tailored their mechanical properties by using various polyurethanes with different soft segments and varying polymer concentrations. The uniaxial mechanical properties, suture retention strength, ball-burst strength, and biaxial mechanical properties of the anisotropic porous scaffolds were optimized to mechanically match native myocardium. The optimal anisotropic scaffold had a ball burst strength (20.7 \u00b1 1.5 N) comparable to that of native porcine myocardium (20.4 \u00b1 6.0 N) and showed anisotropic behavior close to biaxial stretching behavior of the native porcine myocardium.

In this study, we investigated the differentiation of BMS-189453-induced H7 human ESCs (hESCs) and purified ESCs in the treatment of induced acute MI.\nBMS-189453 was used to induce the differentiation of H7 hESCs into myocardial ESCs. We further purified ESCs cells. The expression levels of the myocardial-specific protein cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and the ventricular-specific protein Myosin Light Chain 2 (MLC-2V) were detected by western blot. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of iroquois homeobox 4 (IRX4), an important transcription factor related to ventricular muscle development. Ultrasound, radionuclides, and Holter monitoring were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of ESCs on acute MI induced in pigs.\nCompared with untreated myocardial tissue, myocardial ESCs and purified ESCs improved the outcome in pigs with MI. Treatment with non-purified ESCs and purified ESCs improved the myocardial perfusion grade and ventricular wall motion score index, increased the viable myocardial ratio (VMR), improved the ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and reduced the MI area. Further, compared with non-purified ESCs, purified ESCs resulted in fewer side effects and reduced the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.\nIn the pig model of acute MI, treatment with ESCs significantly improved myocardial function, increased myocardial mass, and reduced scar tissue formation. Purified ESCs have a better treatment effect than non-purified ESCs and can reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.

Cardiac complications can occur in patients with COVID-19 and can be fatal in severe cases. Recently, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 used the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor to gain entry into the host cell. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect heart tissues and the potential mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 have not been determined.\nTo investigate the expression of ACE2 in heart tissues, we performed a bioinformatic analysis from public databases involving mRNA and protein expression. The correlation between ACE2 expression and virus-related genes was analyzed using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. Gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were performed to explore the roles of ACE2.\nACE2 expression in the heart was significantly higher than that in the lung. Compared with the other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 was increased in the heart. Moreover, the mRNA expression of ACE2 was substantially upregulated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Importantly, the expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with genes that regulate viral reproduction and transmission. The GO and PPI analyses showed that the functions of proteins interacting with ACE2 were significantly enriched in the regulation of the viral process and inflammatory response.\nOur study provided bioinformatics evidence that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the heart could contribute to COVID-19-mediated myocardial damage via the virus-induced cytopathic effect, triggering a cardiac inflammatory storm. Therefore, the close monitoring of cardiac function and early clinical intervention may be pivotal to preventing cardiac injury-related mortality in patients with COVID-19.", "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "date": "2020-12-15", "authors": ["WeiqiWang", "SilinLv", "WenqiangGan", "ZifanZeng", "MinYang"], "doi": "10.21037/atm-20-2755\n10.1136/pgmj.2005.037515\n10.5144/0256-4947.2016.78\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02153.x\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8\n10.1001/jama.2020.1585\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052\n10.1126/science.abb2507\n10.1126/science.1260419\n10.1093/nar/30.1.207\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btx143\n10.1093/nar/gkx247\n10.1093/nar/gky1131\n10.1038/75556\n10.1038/s41467-019-09234-6\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehi114\n10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X\n10.1016/j.virusres.2007.01.022"}

This study assessed the modulatory activities of selected polyphenols on the hematotoxic, cardiotoxic, and hepatotoxic effects of crude acetylene. Wistar rats were exposed to 58\u00a0000\u2009ppm crude acetylene for 10\u2009min at 12\u2009h intervals for 30\u2009days. Some exposed groups were treated with 50\u2009mg/kg rutin, quercetin, gallic acid, or tannic acid. Indices of hematological disorder, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular and hepatocellular injuries were evaluated in animals. The results showed a decrease in the levels of hematological indices in crude acetylene-exposed animals except for white blood cell count which was increased. Decreased activity/level of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and ferric reducing antioxidant power with increased lipid peroxidation was observed in animals exposed to crude acetylene. Activities of transaminases, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, and level of bilirubin were increased while the plasma albumin level was decreased. Dyslipidemia, increased activities of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-MB, and severe histopathological damage to hepatic and cardiac tissues were also observed in animals exposed to the gas. These deleterious hematological, biochemical, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in crude acetylene-toxified rats treated with the polyphenols. Tannic acid exhibited better activity than gallic acid while quercetin showed a superior activity to rutin.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of microRNA (miR)-34a on myocardial fibrosis in DCM and its potential mechanism of targeting Pin-1 signaling. Vimentin and Pin-1 proteins in mouse cardiac tissues were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Locked nucleic acid in situ hybridization was used to measure miR-34a expression in cardiac tissues. Primary mouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were transfected with a mimics control/miR-34a mimics or Pin-1 plasmid and cultured in high-glucose (HG) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The miR-34a levels were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The apoptosis and viability of transfected cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays respectively. A cell migration experiment and dual-luciferase reporter assay were also performed. The body weight and fasting blood glucose of DCM mice were significantly higher than those in the control (CTL) group. In addition, DCM mice had decreased serum insulin levels and impaired cardiac function. The number of CFs in the DCM group was higher than in the CTL group and Pin-1 expression was upregulated. The expression level of miR-34a in the cardiac tissue of mice in the DCM group was obviously downregulated compared with the CTL group. The HG stimulation of CFs for 48\u2009h significantly downregulated the expression level of miR-34a and was associated with increased Type I collagen expression, cell viability, and migration and decreased apoptosis. However, these effects could be reversed by overexpressing miR-34a in HG-induced CFs. Furthermore, we found that Pin-1 was a direct target of miR-34a. Our results suggest that miR-34a can attenuate myocardial fibrosis in DCM by reducing Type I collagen production, cell viability, and migration and increasing the apoptosis of CFs by targeting Pin-1 signaling.", "journal": "Cell biology international", "date": "2020-12-09", "authors": ["Xiao-LongZhang", "GangZhang", "Ze-HongBai"], "doi": "10.1002/cbin.11512"}

{"title": "The Genetic Evidence of Burn-Induced Cardiac Mitochondrial Metabolism Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Burn-induced cardiac dysfunction is thought to involve mitochondrial dysfunction, although the mechanisms responsible are unclear. In this study, we used our established model of in vivo burn injury to understand the genetic evidence of burn-induced mitochondrial confusion dysfunction by describing cardiac mitochondrial metabolism-related gene expression after burn. Cardiac tissue was collected at 24 hours after burn injury. An O2K respirometer system was utilized to measure the cardiac mitochondrial function. Oxidative phosphorylation complex activities were determined using enzyme activity assays. RT Profiler PCR array was used to identify the differential regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. The quantitative qPCR and Western blotting were applied to validate the differentially expressed genes. Burn-induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction was supported by the finding of decreased state 3 respiration, decreased mitochondrial electron transport chain activity in complex I, III, IV, and V, and decreased mitochondrial DNA-encoded gene expression as well as decreased levels of the corresponding proteins after burn injury. Eighty-four mitochondrial metabolism-related gene profiles were measured. The mitochondrial gene profile showed that 29 genes related to mitochondrial energy and metabolism was differentially expressed. Of these 29 genes, 16 were more than 2-fold upregulated and 13 were more than 2-fold downregulated. All genes were validated using qPCR and partial genes were correlated with their protein levels.

{"title": "Circadian Rhythms of Early Afterdepolarizations and Ventricular Arrhythmias in a Cardiomyocyte Model.", "abstract": "Sudden cardiac arrest is a malfunction of the heart's electrical system, typically caused by ventricular arrhythmias, that can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) within minutes. Epidemiological studies have shown that SCD and ventricular arrhythmias are more likely to occur in the morning than in the evening, and laboratory studies indicate that these daily rhythms in adverse cardiovascular events are at least partially under the control of the endogenous circadian timekeeping system. However, the biophysical mechanisms linking molecular circadian clocks to cardiac arrhythmogenesis are not fully understood. Recent experiments have shown that L-type calcium channels exhibit circadian rhythms in both expression and function in guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes. We developed an electrophysiological model of these cells to simulate the effect of circadian variation in L-type calcium conductance. In our simulations, we found that there is a circadian pattern in the occurrence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are abnormal depolarizations during the repolarization phase of a cardiac action potential that can trigger fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Specifically, the model produces EADs in the morning, but not at other times of day. We show that the model exhibits a codimension-2 Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation that serves as an organizing center for different types of EAD dynamics. We also simulated a two-dimensional spatial version of this model across a circadian cycle. We found that there is a circadian pattern in the breakup of spiral waves, which represents ventricular fibrillation in cardiac tissue. Specifically, the model produces spiral wave breakup in the morning, but not in the evening. Our computational study is the first, to our knowledge, to propose a link between circadian rhythms and EAD formation and suggests that the efficacy of drugs targeting EAD-mediated arrhythmias may depend on the time of day that they are administered.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2020-12-08", "authors": ["Casey ODiekman", "NingWei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2020.11.2264"}

The levels of this isoform in the hearts of patients with cardiac hypertrophy were found to be significantly decreased. In the pressure overload mouse model, the levels of circYap were reduced in mouse hearts with transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Upon circYap plasmid injection, the cardiac fibrosis was attenuated, and the heart function was improved along with the elevation of cardiac circYap levels in\u00a0TAC mice. Tropomyosin-4 (TMP4) and gamma-actin (ACTG) were identified to bind with circYap in cardiac cells and mouse heart tissues. Such bindings led to an increased TPM4 interaction with ACTG, resulting in the inhibition of actin polymerization and the following fibrosis.

Intermittent tachypacing in aEHTs induces some electrical alterations found in AF and induces an arrhythmic spontaneous beating pattern, but does not affect resting force.

NLRP3 inflammasome activation may underlie obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance, and NLRP3 deficient mice exposed to high fat diet (HFD) appear to be protected from left ventricle (LV) concentric remodeling. Herein, we investigated if these beneficial effects were associated with alterations in plasma metabolites, using metabolomic and lipidomic analysis, and gut microbiota composition, using 16S rRNA sequencing of cecum content, comparing NLRP3 deficient and wild type (WT) mice on HFD and control diet. Obese NLRP3 deficient mice had lower systemic ceramide levels, potentially resulting attenuating inflammation, altered hepatic expression of fatty acids (FA) with lower mono-saturated FA and higher polyunsaturated FA levels, potentially counteracting development of liver steatosis, downregulated myocardial energy metabolism as assessed by proteomic analyses of LV heart tissue, and different levels of bile acids as compared with WT mice. These changes were accompanied by an altered composition of gut microbiota associated with decreased systemic levels of tri-methylamine-N-oxide and lipopolysaccharide, potentially inducing attenuating systemic inflammation and beneficial effects on lipid metabolism.

{"title": "Fast-relaxing cardiomyocytes exert a dominant role in the relaxation behavior of heterogeneous myocardium.", "abstract": "Substantial variation in relaxation rate exists among cardiomyocytes within small volumes of myocardium; however, it is unknown how this variability affects the overall relaxation mechanics of heart muscle. In this study, we sought to modulate levels of cellular heterogeneity in a computational model, then validate those predictions using an engineered heart tissue platform. We formulated an in silico tissue model composed of half-sarcomeres with varied relaxation rates, incorporating single-cell cardiomyocyte experimental data. These model tissues randomly sampled relaxation parameters from two offset distributions of fast- and slow-relaxing populations of half-sarcomeres. Isometric muscle twitch simulations predicted a complex relationship between relaxation time and the proportion of fast-versus slow-relaxing cells in heterogeneous tissues. Specifically, a 50/50 mixture of fast and slow cells did not lead to relaxation time that was the mean of the relaxation times associated with the two pure cases. Rather, the mean relaxation time was achieved at a ratio of 70:30 slow:fast relaxing cells, suggesting a disproportionate impact of fast-relaxing cells on overall tissue relaxation. To examine whether this behavior persists in vitro, we constructed engineered heart tissues from two lines of fast- and slow-relaxing human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Cell tracking via fluorescent nanocrystals confirmed the presence of both cell populations in the 50/50 mixed tissues at the time of mechanical characterization. Isometric muscle twitch relaxation times of these mixed-population engineered heart tissues showed agreement with the predictions from the model, namely that the measured relaxation rate of 50/50 mixed tissues more closely resembled that of tissues made with 100% fast-relaxing cells.

{"title": "Enhancing Matured Stem-Cardiac Cell Generation and Transplantation: A Novel Strategy for Heart Failure Therapy.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent studies have shown that stem cells (SCs) including bone marrow mesenchymal stem (BMSC), embryonic bodies (EB), embryonic stem (ESC), human induced pluripotent stem (hiPSC)-derived cardiac cells generation, and transplantation treated myocardial infarction (MI) in vivo and in human. However, the immature phenotypes compromise their clinical application requiring immediate intervention to improve stem-derived cardiac cell (S-CCs) maturation. Recently, an unbiased multi-omic analysis involving genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics identified specific strategies for the generation of matured S-CCs that may enhance patients' recovery processes upon transplantation. However, these strategies still remain undisclosed. Here, we summarize the recently discovered strategies for the matured S-CC generation.

{"title": "Dual Function of iPSC-Derived Pericyte-Like Cells in Vascularization and Fibrosis-Related Cardiac Tissue Remodeling In Vitro.", "abstract": "Myocardial interstitial fibrosis (MIF) is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, increased myocardial stiffness, functional weakening, and compensatory cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy. Fibroblasts (Fbs) are considered the principal source of ECM, but the contribution of perivascular cells, including pericytes (PCs), has gained attention, since MIF develops primarily around small vessels. The pathogenesis of MIF is difficult to study in humans because of the pleiotropy of mutually influencing pathomechanisms, unpredictable side effects, and the lack of available patient samples. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer the unique opportunity for the de novo formation of bioartificial cardiac tissue (BCT) using a variety of different cardiovascular cell types to model aspects of MIF pathogenesis in vitro. Here, we have optimized a protocol for the derivation of hPSC-derived PC-like cells (iPSC-PCs) and present a BCT in vitro model of MIF that shows their central influence on interstitial collagen deposition and myocardial tissue stiffening. This model was used to study the interplay of different cell types-i.e., hPSC-derived CMs, endothelial cells (ECs), and iPSC-PCs or primary Fbs, respectively. While iPSC-PCs improved the sarcomere structure and supported vascularization in a PC-like fashion, the functional and histological parameters of BCTs revealed EC- and PC-mediated effects on fibrosis-related cardiac tissue remodeling.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-12-02", "authors": ["MonikaSzepes", "AnnaMelchert", "JuliaDahlmann", "JanHegermann", "ChristopherWerlein", "DannyJonigk", "AxelHaverich", "UlrichMartin", "RuthOlmer", "InaGruh"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21238947\n10.1152/ajpcell.00328.2012\n10.2353/ajpath.2008.080433\n10.1038/ncomms3823\n10.1164/rccm.201212-2297OC\n10.1152/ajpheart.00358.2011\n10.14670/HH-24.909\n10.1007/978-3-030-11093-2_11\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.232934\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.048264\n10.1159/000345524\n10.1038/nbt.2107\n10.7554/eLife.10036\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00154\n10.1073/pnas.1306562110\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.302598\n10.4155/fmc.13.22\n10.1016/j.scr.2010.03.005\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.09.017\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.09.001\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.03.017\n10.1089/ten.tec.2010.0405\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs349\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.008\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.08.011\n10.1093/cvr/cvy154\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.10.015\n10.1002/adhm.201601434\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119741\n10.1016/j.diff.2016.06.004\n10.1016/j.gdata.2014.10.006\n10.1016/j.stem.2018.05.027\n10.1038/nature15695\n10.1038/nprot.2014.102\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.12.008\n10.1093/nar/29.9.e45\n10.1038/srep29933\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.019\n10.1016/j.neuron.2008.01.003\n10.1038/nature09522\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00706\n10.1007/s10456-014-9439-0\n10.1038/ncb3205\n10.1016/j.mvr.2013.07.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0022086\n10.1186/s13036-019-0139-6\n10.3390/cells9010188\n10.1038/ni.2477\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302533\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.121\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.12.024\n10.1152/ajpheart.00359.2011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.016\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.09.007\n10.1002/adhm.201600571\n10.1371/journal.pone.0194706\n10.1021/acscentsci.9b00052\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1044/1092-4388(2002/004)\n10.1073/pnas.0908381106\n10.1038/s41598-017-14053-0\n10.1073/pnas.1919394117\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.083\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.1186/s12929-018-0459-8\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.196113\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306565\n10.1038/s41598-019-43759-6\n10.3389/fmed.2015.00059\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.06.015\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0220573\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0253\n10.1089/hgtb.2012.248\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.08.021\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.12.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018293\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1038/nmeth.3901\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102"}

A compensatory attempt of the heart to enhance its functional performance after MI is to undergo cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In the past, reducing the levels of ROS in the cardiomyocytes has been linked to suppression of cardiac hypertrophy. Notably, cerium oxide nanoparticles (nCe) have been used extensively to protect the cells from oxidative damage by efficiently scavenging cellular ROS. Furthermore, fibrous matrices such as nanofibers are emerging as promising substrates for engineering implantable cardiac patches. In this study, we describe the fabrication of nCe-decorated polycaprolactone (PCL) and PCL-gelatin blend (PCLG) nanofibers prepared using electrospinning. Characterization by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and contact angle goniometry confirmed the presence of nCe on PCL or PCLG nanofibers (PCLG-Ce) of \u2248300\u00a0nm fiber diameter. nCe-based PCLG scaffolds were cytocompatible with a variety of cell types, including primary cells.

Existing protocols for cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs utilize a 2D culture system. However, the efficiency of hiPSC differentiation to cardiomyocytes in 3D culture systems has not been extensively explored. In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs to functional cardiomyocytes on 3D nanofibrous scaffolds. Coaxial polycaprolactone (PCL)-gelatin fibrous scaffolds were fabricated by electrospinning and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. hiPSCs were cultured and differentiated into functional cardiomyocytes on the nanofibrous scaffold and compared with 2D cultures. To assess the relative efficiencies of both the systems, SEM, immunofluorescence staining and gene expression analyses were performed. Contractions of differentiated cardiomyocytes were observed in 2D cultures after 2\u00a0weeks and in 3D cultures after 4\u00a0weeks. SEM analysis showed no significant differences in the morphology of cells differentiated on 2D versus 3D cultures. However, gene expression data showed significantly increased expression of cardiac progenitor genes (ISL-1, SIRPA) in 3D cultures and cardiomyocytes markers (TNNT, MHC6) in 2D cultures. In contrast, immunofluorescence staining showed no substantial differences in the expression of NKX-2.5 and \u03b1-sarcomeric actinin. Furthermore, uniform migration and distribution of the in situ differentiated cardiomyocytes was observed in the 3D fibrous scaffold.

{"title": "Cholecystokinin peptide signaling is regulated by a TBX5-MEF2 axis in the heart.", "abstract": "The procholecystokinin (proCCK) gene encodes a secreted peptide known to regulate the digestive, endocrine, and nervous systems. Though recently proposed as a biomarker for heart dysfunction, its physiological role in both the embryonic and adult heart is poorly understood, and there are no reports of tissue-specific regulators of cholecystokinin signaling in the heart or other tissues. In the present study, mRNA of proCCK was observed in cardiac tissues during mouse embryonic development, establishing proCCK as an early marker of differentiated cardiomyocytes which is later restricted to anatomical subdomains of the neonatal heart. Three-dimensional analysis of the expression of proCCK and CCKAR/CCKBR receptors was performed using in situ hybridization and optical projection tomography, illustrating chamber-specific expression patterns in the postnatal heart. Transcription factor motif analyses indicated developmental cardiac transcription factors TBX5 and MEF2C as upstream regulators of proCCK, and this regulatory activity was confirmed in reporter gene assays. proCCK mRNA levels were also measured in the infarcted heart and in response to cyclic mechanical stretch and endothelin-1, indicating dynamic transcriptional regulation which might be leveraged for improved biomarker development. Functional analyses of exogenous cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) administration were performed in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and the results suggest that CCK-8 does not act as a differentiation modulator of cardiomyocyte subtypes. Collectively, these findings indicate that proCCK is regulated at the transcriptional level by TBX5-MEF2 and neurohormonal signaling, informing use of proCCK as a biomarker and future strategies for upstream manipulation of cholecystokinin signaling in the heart and other tissues.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2020-11-30", "authors": ["Robert SLeigh", "Heikki JRuskoaho", "Bogac LKaynak"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2020.170459"}
{"title": "The nutrient sensing pathways FoxO1/3 and mTOR in the heart are coordinately regulated by central leptin through PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4. Implications in cardiac remodeling.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes is often associated with hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance, while other studies support that leptin has cardioprotective effects. Besides, the role of leptin in regulating cardiac atrophy or hypertrophy remains to be clearly defined. In fact, in rats with normal leptin sensitivity, the molecular underpinnings of the effects of central leptin regulating cardiac structural pathways remain poorly understood.\nHence, we assessed the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) leptin infusion on cardiac remodeling analyzing FOXO1/3 and mTORC1 pathways, focusing special attention to PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 as mediator of central leptin's effects on cardiac metabolism.\nMale 3-months-old Wistar rats, infused with icv leptin (0.2\u202f\u03bcg/day) for 7\u202fdays, were daily co-treated intraperitoneally with the specific PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 antagonist GSK0660, at 1\u202fmg/kg per day along leptin treatment.\nCentral leptin regulated dynamically, in an opposite manner, the network between FOXOs and mTORC1 and induced an atrophy-related gene program in cardiac tissue. Leptin activated the anti-hypertrophic kinase GSK3\u03b2 and increased the protein levels of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)/Atrogin-1 involved in limiting cardiac hypertrophy. FOXO1 activity and the expression of their target genes, Sod2 and Lpl, were also increased in the heart upon central leptin infusion. Besides, Beclin-1 and LC3B-II, gene products of the autophagic pathway response, were upregulated, while the content and expression levels of phenotypic markers of cardiac hypertrophy as ANP and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, gene product of Myh7 were significantly decreased. On the other hand, mTORC1 activity and OXPHOS protein levels were decreased suggesting a key role of central leptin preventing cardiac oxidative stress. In fact, the content of carbonylated proteins, TBARS and ROS/RSN were not increased in cardiac tissue in response to central leptin infusion. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, via in vivo administration of the selective antagonist GSK0660, blunted the induction of FOXO1/3, Atrogin-1, MuRF1 and GSK3\u03b2 in the heart mediated by icv leptin infusion.\nOur results demonstrate that, in lean rats with normal leptin sensitivity, central leptin regulates nutrient sensing pathways in heart contributing to balance cardiac remodeling through the anti- and pro-hypertrophic programs, and in this process is involved PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4.", "journal": "Metabolism: clinical and experimental", "date": "2020-11-30", "authors": ["BlancaRubio", "CristinaMora", "CristinaPintado", "LorenaMazuecos", "AlejandroFern\u00e1ndez", "VirginiaL\u00f3pez", "AntonioAndr\u00e9s", "NildaGallardo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154453"}
{"title": "A Simulation Study of the Role of Mechanical Stretch in Arrhythmogenesis during Cardiac Alternans.", "abstract": "The deformation of the heart tissue due to the contraction can modulate the excitation, a phenomenon referred to as mechanoelectrical feedback (MEF), via stretch-activated channels. The effects of MEF on the electrophysiology at high pacing rates are shown to be proarrhythmic in general. However, more studies need to be done to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In this work, we investigate the effects of MEF on cardiac alternans, which is an alternation in the width of the action potential that typically occurs when the heart is paced at high rates, using a biophysically detailed electromechanical model of cardiac tissue. We observe that the transition from spatially concordant alternans to spatially discordant alternans, which is more arrhythmogenic than concordant alternans, may occur in the presence of MEF and when its strength is sufficiently large. We show that this transition is due to the increase of the dispersion of conduction velocity.

However, vinblastine-caused myocardial damage has been continually reported. The underlying molecular mechanism of the myocardial damage remains unknown. Here, we show that vinblastine induces myocardial damage and necroptosis is involved in the vinblastine-induced myocardial damage both in vitro and in vivo. The results of WST-8 and flow cytometry analysis show that vinblastine causes damage to H9c2 cells, and the results of animal experiments show that vinblastine causes myocardial cell damage. The necrosome components, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), are significantly increased in vinblastine-treated H9c2 cells, primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and rat heart tissues. And the downstream substrate of RIP3, mixed lineage kinase domain like protein (MLKL) was also increased. Pre-treatment with necroptosis inhibitors partially inhibits the necrosome components and MLKL levels and alleviates vinblastine-induced myocardial injury both in vitro and in vivo. This study indicates that necroptosis participated in vinblastine-evoked myocardial cell death partially, which would be a potential target for relieving the chemotherapy-related myocardial damage.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2020-11-29", "authors": ["HuilingZhou", "LijunLiu", "XiaolongMa", "JianWang", "JinfuYang", "XinminZhou", "YifengYang", "HaidanLiu"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-020-03985-3"}

Complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac tissue damage, secondary infections, isolated coagulopathy and pulmonary embolism have been reported with COVID-19 disease.\nA 79-year-old woman admitted to the emergency room (ER) had complaints of fever and cough. The patient was admitted to the ER with the suspicion of COVID-19. Samples were collected with a nasopharyngeal swab and confirmed as COVID-19. In addition, a chest CT examination was performed. In the first evaluation after admittance, the D-dimer value was measured as 450 \u03bcg/L. In the follow-up of the patient, on the 18th day, increased respiratory distress and high D-dimer level (7893 \u03bcg/L) were detected in the laboratory findings.\nA chest CT scan had ground-glass opacities compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. A giant cavitary lesion was detected following the development of pulmonary embolism after COVID-19 disease.\nIn rare cases of COVID-19 cavitation development may occur after pulmonary infarction.

Mouse heart tissue was isolated and digested for total RNA extraction and then subjected to next-generation RNA-sequencing. Expression profiles of circRNAs and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were also constructed. Overall, 48 upregulated and 16 downregulated circRNAs were found to be statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the DOX-injected group. Bioinformatics analysis revealed several potential biological pathways that might be related to apoptosis caused by DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, using qRT-PCR, we found that a circRNA coded by the Arhgap12 gene, termed circArhgap12, was upregulated in the mouse heart tissue upon DOX intervention. CircArhgap12 enhanced apoptotic cell rate, as assessed using terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay, and increased reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde release as well as superoxide dismutase and caspase-3 activation. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that circArhgap12 could sponge miR-135a-5p. In rat primary cardiomyocytes, we found that si-circArhgap12 promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress by sponging the miR-135a-5p inhibitor. Using bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay, we found that miR-135a-5p might have a potential target site for ADCY1 mRNA.\nOur research demonstrated that the expression profile of circRNAs was modified significantly and that circArhgap12 might play a competitive role among endogenous RNAs in mouse cardiomyocytes during DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.\nOur study may provide a preliminary understanding of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity modulated by circRNA and its competing endogenous RNAs network.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2020-11-28", "authors": ["XuejunWang", "ZijieCheng", "JiaXu", "MengwenFeng", "HaoZhang", "LiZhang", "LingmeiQian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118788"}

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in the development of EH by regulating the expression of specific target genes. However, little is known about the role of miRNAs in CMV-induced EH. In the present study, we compared the miRNA expression profiles of samples from normal and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-infected C57BL/6 mice using high-throughput sequencing analysis.\nWe collected the thoracic aorta, heart tissues, and peripheral blood from 20 normal mice and 20 MCMV-infected mice. We identified differentially expressed miRNAs in the peripheral blood samples and predicted their target genes using bioinformatics tools. We then experimentally validated them using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and the target genes with double luciferase reporter gene assay.\nWe found 118 differentially expressed miRNAs, among which 9 miRNAs were identified as potential MCMV infection-induced hypertension regulators. We then validated the expression of two candidate miRNAs, mmu-miR-1929-3p and mcmv-miR-m01-4-5p, using qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of endothelin A receptor (Ednra) messenger RNA (mRNA) contained a binding site for mmu-miR-1929-3p. Collectively, our data suggest that MCMV infection can raise the blood pressure and reduce mmu-miR-1929-3p expression in C57BL/6 mice.

Furthermore, ZBN restored ISO-mediated antioxidant status, increased level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and tissue phospholipids to the near-normal levels. Besides, ZBN pre-treatment significantly reduced the level of inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, NF-\u03baB, and IL-1\u03b2) in ISO-induced MI in rats.

Here, in vitro and in vivo activities of SLB, SLB+BZ, and BZ against T. cruzi Y strain were evaluated. Cytotoxicity of SLB in VERO cells by the MTT method revealed IC50 of 250.22 \u03bcM. The trypanocidal activity evaluated by resazurin method in epimastigotes showed that SLB 25 \u03bcM inhibited parasite growth. SLB IC50 and selectivity index (SI) for amastigote were 79.81 \u03bcM and 3.13, respectively. SLB100+BZ10 showed higher parasite inhibition (91.44%) than SLB or BZ. Swiss mice infected with Y strain were treated with SLB, SLB+BZ, and BZ. Parasitemia was evaluated daily and 90, 180, and 240 days after treatment in surviving animals by hemoculture, blood qPCR, and after euthanasia, by qPCR in\u00a0heart tissue. SLB\u00a0monotherapy was not able to control the parasitemia/mortality of the animals. Parasitological negativation of 85.7-100% was observed in the experimental groups treated with SLB+BZ. Although SLB had shown activity against T. cruzi in vitro, it was not active in mice. Thus, the results of the therapeutic effect observed with SLB+BZ may be interpreted as a result from BZ action.", "journal": "Parasitology research", "date": "2020-11-26", "authors": ["Fernanda Karoline Vieira da SilvaTorchelsen", "Thaila MartinsSilva", "Matheus MarquesMilagre", "Rafael RodriguesSilva", "Levi Eduardo SoaresReis", "Renata Tupinamb\u00e1Branquinho", "Glenda NicioliSilva", "Martade Lana"], "doi": "10.1007/s00436-020-06944-5\n10.3390/molecules22111942\n10.1128/AAC.00617-13\n10.1016/j.exppara.2006.12.007\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.05.002\n10.1007/s00436-013-3398-z\n10.1128/aac.37.9.1993\n10.3389/fmicb.2018.00205\n10.1590/s0074-02762009000400002\n10.1590/S0074-02762002000100001\n10.1016/S0166-6851(03)00093-8\n10.1128/AAC.00038-08\n10.1155/2015/292797\n10.17420/ap6401.129\n10.1016/0035-9203(87)90020-4\n10.1007/s00011-013-0640-1\n10.7705/biomedica.v29i3.15\n10.1007/s001090000169\n10.1017/S0031182019001276\n10.1016/0022-1759(83)90303-4\n10.1016/s0166-6851(01)00350-4\n10.3390/molecules23071560\n10.1128/AAC.02410-16\n10.1007/s00436-006-0126-y\n10.1590/0074-0276130496\n10.1016/j.molbiopara.2009.05.005\n10.1590/S1984-82502012000300002\n10.4062/biomolther.2014.138\n10.1093/carcin/20.11.2101"}
{"title": "SARS-CoV-2 Infected Cardiomyocytes Recruit Monocytes by Secreting CCL2.", "abstract": "Heart injury has been reported in up to 20% of COVID-19 patients, yet the cause of myocardial histopathology remains unknown. In order to study the cause of myocardial pathology in COVID-19 patients, we used a hamster model to determine whether following infection SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, can be detected in heart tissues. Here, we clearly demonstrate that viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is present in cardiomyocytes in the hearts of infected hamsters. Interestingly, functional cardiomyocyte associated gene expression was decreased in infected hamster hearts, corresponding to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). This data using an animal model was further validated using autopsy heart samples of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we show that both human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-derived CMs) and adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that CCL2 is secreted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to monocyte recruitment. Increased CCL2 expression and macrophage infiltration was also observed in the hearts of infected hamsters. Using single cell RNA-seq, we also show that macrophages are able to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection of CMs. Overall, our study provides direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects CMs in vivo and proposes a mechanism of immune-cell infiltration and pathology in heart tissue of COVID-19 patients.", "journal": "Research square", "date": "2020-11-26", "authors": ["ShuibingChen", "LiuliuYang", "BenjaminNilsson-Payant", "YulingHan", "FabriceJaffr\u00e9", "JiajunZhu", "PengfeiWang", "TuoZhang", "DavidRedmond", "SeanHoughton", "RasmusM\u00f8ller", "DaisyHoagland", "ShuHoriuchi", "JoshuaAcklin", "JeanLim", "YaronBram", "ChanelRichardson", "VasurethaChandar", "AlainBorczuk", "YaoxingHuang", "JennyXiang", "DavidHo", "RobertSchwartz", "BenjamintenOever", "ToddEvans"], "doi": "10.21203/rs.3.rs-94634/v1"}
{"title": "Immunogenicity in Stem Cell Therapy for Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "Despite enormous advances in the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart disease remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Thus, there is a need for novel CVD therapeutics. CVD appears to be a custom-made scenario for applying stem cell therapy. Although human pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes to regenerate injured heart tissue and restore post-myocardial infarction cardiac function, several obstacles need to be overcome before cell therapy can be applied in CVD patients. One of these major hurdles is the immunological barrier. Currently, long-term immunosuppressant treatment is necessary for allogenic stem cell or organ transplantation to prevent rejection. However, the long-term use of immunosuppressants may cause serious adverse events such as nephrotoxicity, severe infections and malignancy. Thus, overcoming this immunological hurdle is crucial for the clinical application of stem cell therapy in cardiac regeneration.

{"title": "ACE2 Interaction Networks in COVID-19: A Physiological Framework for Prediction of Outcome in Patients with Cardiovascular Risk Factors.", "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19) is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of the study was to characterize the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) functional networks with a focus on CVD.\nUsing the network medicine approach and publicly available datasets, we investigated ACE2 tissue expression and described ACE2 interaction networks that could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, lungs and nervous system. We compared them with changes in ACE-2 networks following SARS-CoV-2 infection by analyzing public data of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). This analysis was performed using the Network by Relative Importance (NERI) algorithm, which integrates protein-protein interaction with co-expression networks. We also performed miRNA-target predictions to identify which miRNAs regulate ACE2-related networks and could play a role in the COVID19 outcome. Finally, we performed enrichment analysis for identifying the main COVID-19 risk groups.\nWe found similar ACE2 expression confidence levels in respiratory and cardiovascular systems, supporting that heart tissue is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of ACE2 interaction networks in infected hiPSC-CMs identified multiple hub genes with corrupted signaling which can be responsible for cardiovascular symptoms. The most affected genes were EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), FN1 (Fibronectin 1), TP53, HSP90AA1, and APP (Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein), while the most affected interactions were associated with MAST2 and CALM1 (Calmodulin 1). Enrichment analysis revealed multiple diseases associated with the interaction networks of ACE2, especially cancerous diseases, obesity, hypertensive disease, Alzheimer's disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. Among affected ACE2-network components connected with the SARS-Cov-2 interactome, we identified AGT (Angiotensinogen), CAT (Catalase), DPP4 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4), CCL2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2), TFRC (Transferrin Receptor) and CAV1 (Caveolin-1), associated with cardiovascular risk factors. We described for the first time miRNAs which were common regulators of ACE2 networks and virus-related proteins in all analyzed datasets. The top miRNAs regulating ACE2 networks were miR-27a-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-302c-5p, hsa-miR-587, hsa-miR-1305, hsa-miR-200b-3p, hsa-miR-124-3p, and hsa-miR-16-5p.\nOur study provides a complete mechanistic framework for investigating the ACE2 network which was validated by expression data. This framework predicted risk groups, including the established ones, thus providing reliable novel information regarding the complexity of signaling pathways affected by SARS-CoV-2. It also identified miRNAs that could be used in personalized diagnosis in COVID-19.", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "date": "2020-11-26", "authors": ["ZofiaWicik", "CerenEyileten", "DanielJakubik", "S\u00e9rgio NSim\u00f5es", "David CMartins", "RodrigoPav\u00e3o", "Jolanta MSiller-Matula", "MarekPostula"], "doi": "10.3390/jcm9113743\n10.1056/NEJMoa2001017\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994\n10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017\n10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9\n10.7326/0003-4819-141-9-200411020-00006\n10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70204-4\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1286\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047049\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317015\n10.3390/cells9071652\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.307708\n10.1101/2020.01.31.929042\n10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100052\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa267\n10.1101/2020.08.24.20170175\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02153.x\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.046941\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00702\n10.1007/s00134-020-05985-9\n10.1128/JVI.02560-09\n10.1016/j.peptides.2011.08.009\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.09.041\n10.1093/database/bay003\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1186/1471-2105-16-S19-S9\n10.3390/cells7120249\n10.1038/s41598-017-07238-0\n10.1093/nar/gkn923\n10.1186/1471-2105-14-128\n10.1093/nar/gku631\n10.1186/s12933-019-0918-x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.07.001\n10.1038/nrg2918\n10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30287-X\n10.1371/journal.pone.0210431\n10.3390/jcm9040982\n10.7554/eLife.59177\n10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102597\n10.1093/bib/bbx066\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001095\n10.1371/journal.pone.0199435\n10.1038/s41467-020-17189-2\n10.1080/07391102.2020.1823887\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.08.003\n10.1038/s41569-020-0360-5\n10.1007/s11427-020-1705-0\n10.1002/path.1560\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.06.060\n10.1210/jendso/bvaa082\n10.1101/2020.03.21.20037267\n10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418\n10.1097/JU.0000000000001246.02\n10.1080/22221751.2020.1760144\n10.1073/pnas.1621436114\n10.1002/cphy.c100053\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2004.05.004\n10.1128/IAI.69.6.3877-3882.2001\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.196543\n10.3389/fcell.2019.00200\n10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.030\n10.3390/ijms19061705\n10.1371/journal.pone.0056655\n10.1016/j.febslet.2007.11.085\n10.1007/s11906-014-0431-2\n10.1038/nature00786\n10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01487-3\n10.3389/fmed.2020.00335\n10.1038/cr.2008.15\n10.1186/s13567-018-0551-9\n10.1101/2020.05.05.079194\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.22058\n10.1002/adma.202004901\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034609\n10.1111/j.1574-695X.1994.tb00434.x\n10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108165\n10.1073/pnas.1619109114\n10.3390/v10090448\n10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108125\n10.1080/mic.10.3-4.273.288\n10.1002/path.2067\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5\n10.1042/BSR20170347\n10.1186/s12943-019-1129-5\n10.1093/emboj/18.5.1280\n10.1002/rmv.1967\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.07.007\n10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190703\n10.1038/srep40342\n10.1074/jbc.M117.805937\n10.1111/apt.15197\n10.4049/jimmunol.1701692\n10.2217/bmm-2018-0132\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa071\n10.1097/ccm.0000000000004315\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104718\n10.1111/jnc.14208\n10.1007/s00392-017-1096-z\n10.1002/ejhf.332\n10.1016/j.gene.2019.144191\n10.1186/s12974-016-0771-8\n10.1007/s12026-018-9060-1\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.04.023\n10.1186/s12936-020-03360-z\n10.1186/1471-2334-14-506\n10.1042/BSR20194433\n10.18632/oncotarget.24205\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.05.059"}

{"title": "Ethanol Extract of Chinese Hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida) Fruit Reduces Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Rats with Doxorubicin-Induced Chronic Heart Failure.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Chinese hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida) fruit is a traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of digestive system and cardiovascular diseases. The fruit contains polyphenol compounds, such as epicatechin, that have anti-inflammatory activity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an alcohol extract of hawthorn fruit (HAE) on inflammation and oxidative stress in rats with doxorubicin-induced chronic heart failure (CHF). MATERIAL AND METHODS Rats were intraperitoneally injected with doxorubicin to induce CHF and subsequently treated with HAE intragastrically once daily for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters were assessed, and enzyme-linked immunoassays were used to detect the levels of cardiac injury markers (brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase-MB, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, copeptin, and adrenomedullin), oxidative stress markers (glutathione peroxidase and malondialdehyde), and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-1\u00df, and tumor necrosis factor-a). The IL-1\u00df, IL-6, glutathione peroxidase-1, and catalase mRNA levels were also measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Our findings indicated that HAE exerts a cardioprotective effect, as shown by improved echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters, decreased activity of serum myocardial enzymes, reduced serum levels of CHF markers, and inhibited inflammatory response in cardiac tissue. In addition, HAE treatment downregulated the mRNA expression of IL-1\u00df and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and upregulated the mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 and catalase compared with untreated doxorubicin-induced CHF rats. CONCLUSIONS HAE shows promise for the prevention and treatment of CHF. The cardioprotective effect of HAE appears to be related to inhibition of both the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in vivo.", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "date": "2020-11-25", "authors": ["FangzhouCheng", "WenlongJiang", "XiaoshuanXiong", "JuanChen", "YunzhiXiong", "YinghongLi"], "doi": "10.12659/MSM.926654"}

The cloud point extraction efficiently enriched membrane proteins using a single extraction, eliminating the need for time-consuming ultracentrifugation steps. Subsequently, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with an MS-compatible mobile phase (59% water, 40% isopropanol, 1% formic acid) was used to remove the residual surfactant and fractionate intact proteins (6-115 kDa). The fractions were separated further by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) coupled with MS for protein characterization.

{"title": "Cardiovascular tissue regeneration system based on multiscale scaffolds comprising double-layered hydrogels and fibers.", "abstract": "We report a technique to reconstruct cardiovascular tissue using multiscale scaffolds incorporating polycaprolactone fibers with double-layered hydrogels comprising fibrin hydrogel surrounded by secondary alginate hydrogel. The scaffolds compartmentalized cells into the core region of cardiac tissue and the peripheral region of blood vessels to construct cardiovascular tissue, which was accomplished by a triple culture system of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) with C2C12 myoblasts on polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers along with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in fibrin hydrogel. The secondary alginate hydrogel prevented encapsulated cells from migrating outside scaffold and maintained the scaffold structure without distortion after subcutaneous implantation. According to in vitro studies, resultant scaffolds promoted new blood vessel formation as well as cardiomyogenic phenotype expression of ADSCs. Cardiac muscle-specific genes were expressed from stem cells and peripheral blood vessels from HUVECs were also successfully developed in subcutaneously implanted cell-laden multiscale scaffolds. Furthermore, the encapsulated stem cells modulated the immune response of scaffolds by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines for successful tissue construction.

They could be particularly valuable in restoring cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the potential of biologically active compounds, namely, angiotensin II, retinoic acid (RA), epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), vitamin C alone, and the combinations of RA, EGCG, and vitamin C with angiotensin II to induce cardiomyogenic differentiation of AF-MSCs. We observed that the upregulated expression of cardiac gene markers (NKX2-5, MYH6, TNNT2, and DES) and cardiac ion channel genes (sodium, calcium, the potassium) also the increased levels of Connexin 43 and Nkx2.5 proteins. Extracellular flux analysis, applied for the first time on AF-MSCs induced with biologically active compounds, revealed the switch in AF-MSCS energetic phenotype and enhanced utilization of oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. Moreover, we demonstrated changes in epigenetic marks associated with transcriptionally active (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H4hyperAc) or repressed (H3K27me3) chromatin. All in all, we demonstrated that explored biomolecules were able to induce alterations in AF-MSCs at the phenotypic, genetic, protein, metabolic, and epigenetic levels, leading to the formation of cardiomyocyte progenitors that may become functional heart cells in vitro or in vivo.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-11-25", "authors": ["MonikaGasi\u016bnien\u0117", "ElvinaValatkait\u0117", "Aist\u0117Navakauskait\u0117", "R\u016btaNavakauskien\u0117"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21228752\n10.1089/scd.2007.0036\n10.1155/2015/319238\n10.1095/biolreprod.105.046029\n10.1038/nbt1274\n10.1016/j.advms.2014.08.001\n10.1002/term.308\n10.1002/jcb.28092\n10.1016/j.tips.2010.08.001\n10.15283/ijsc18126\n10.1007/BF00744871\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0433\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000064899.53876.A3\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.116\n10.1002/dvdy.24366\n10.1016/j.diff.2017.04.001\n10.1038/cr.2011.195\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.05.127\n10.3892/or.2015.3802\n10.1155/2017/5615647\n10.1080/10428194.2017.1339881\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.09.005\n10.1096/fj.04-1716fje\n10.1111/j.1745-7254.2007.00495.x\n10.4097/kjae.2010.58.2.169\n10.3346/jkms.2010.25.3.380\n10.3727/096368915X689622\n10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04284.x\n10.1186/1471-2121-7-14\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002213\n10.1002/jcp.26845\n10.1080/14653240600855905\n10.1007/s11010-018-3373-1\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00471.2016\n10.1136/hrt.2005.066878\n10.1089/scd.2008.0292\n10.1038/nbt.2005\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.04.016\n10.1155/2016/7513252\n10.18632/oncotarget.6277\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.10.002\n10.1093/toxsci/kfs233\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.10.014\n10.1093/cvr/cvn098\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80611-X\n10.1073/pnas.94.21.11399\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.01.015\n10.1083/jcb.201012049\n10.1152/ajpcell.00359.2012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0022550\n10.1155/2016/6465307"}

D.\u00a0acutus envenomation can result in coagulopathy and lead to death if not treated correctly. A 20-year-old man was discovered with a severely swollen left thigh with overlying dark purple, discolored skin. He was immediately transported to hospital. Laboratory examinations revealed dysfunctional coagulation and fluid-electrolyte imbalances. He died 2\u00a0h later despite resuscitation efforts. Surveillance footage revealed that he had walked through a grass field while returning home that night. Autopsy and pathological examination findings revealed a large area of muscle necrosis of the left thigh, renal tubular necrosis, and hepatocyte necrosis. Potential fang marks were found on the decedent's jeans. Due to our suspicions, we performed specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and detected D.\u00a0acutus venom in the kidneys, left thigh muscle, liver, lung, spleen, and heart tissues of the decedent.

Many proofs show that circular RNA plays an important role in the development of AMI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of circSAMD4A in H/R-induced myocardial injury. The levels of circular SAMD4A (circSAMD4A) were detected in the heart tissues of AMI mice and H/R-induced H9C2 cells, and the circSAMD4A was suppressed in AMI mice and H/R-induced H9C2 cells to investigate its' function in AMI. The levels of circSAMD4A and miR-138-5p were detected by real-time quantitative PCR, and MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. TUNEL analysis and Annexin V-FITC were used to determine apoptosis. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was detected by Western blot. IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were detected by ELISA kits. The study found that the levels of circSAMD4A were up-regulated after H/R induction and inhibition of circSAMD4A expression would reduce the H/R-induced apoptosis and inflammation. MiR-138-5p was down-regulated in H/R-induced H9C2 cells. circSAMD4A was a targeted regulator of miR-138-5p.

{"title": "Rare genetic variation at transcription factor binding sites modulates local DNA methylation profiles.", "abstract": "Although DNA methylation is the best characterized epigenetic mark, the mechanism by which it is targeted to specific regions in the genome remains unclear. Recent studies have revealed that local DNA methylation profiles might be dictated by cis-regulatory DNA sequences that mainly operate via DNA-binding factors. Consistent with this finding, we have recently shown that disruption of CTCF-binding sites by rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) can underlie cis-linked DNA methylation changes in patients with congenital anomalies. These data raise the hypothesis that rare genetic variation at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) might contribute to local DNA methylation patterning. In this work, by combining blood genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, whole genome sequencing-derived SNVs from 247 unrelated individuals along with 133 predicted TFBS motifs derived from ENCODE ChIP-Seq data, we observed an association between the disruption of binding sites for multiple TFs by rare SNVs and extreme DNA methylation values at both local and, to a lesser extent, distant CpGs. While the majority of these changes affected only single CpGs, 24% were associated with multiple outlier CpGs within \u00b11kb of the disrupted TFBS. Interestingly, disruption of functionally constrained sites within TF motifs lead to larger DNA methylation changes at nearby CpG sites. Altogether, these findings suggest that rare SNVs at TFBS negatively influence TF-DNA binding, which can lead to an altered local DNA methylation profile. Furthermore, subsequent integration of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq profiles from cardiac tissues enabled us to observe an association between rare SNV-directed DNA methylation and outlier expression of nearby genes. In conclusion, our findings not only provide insights into the effect of rare genetic variation at TFBS on shaping local DNA methylation and its consequences on genome regulation, but also provide a rationale to incorporate DNA methylation data to interpret the functional role of rare variants.", "journal": "PLoS genetics", "date": "2020-11-21", "authors": ["AlejandroMartin-Trujillo", "NihirPatel", "FelixRichter", "BharatiJadhav", "ParasGarg", "Sarah UMorton", "David MMcKean", "Steven RDePalma", "ElizabethGoldmuntz", "DorotaGruber", "RichardKim", "Jane WNewburger", "George APorter", "AlessandroGiardini", "DanielBernstein", "MartinTristani-Firouzi", "Jonathan GSeidman", "Christine ESeidman", "Wendy KChung", "Bruce DGelb", "Andrew JSharp"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1009189\n10.1126/science.1242429\n10.1038/nature10808\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1004663\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000952\n10.1371/journal.pone.0055923\n10.1038/nature11632\n10.1038/nature19057\n10.1126/science.1262110\n10.1038/nature24267\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002144\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.12.023\n10.1038/nrg1655\n10.1101/gad.9.19.2325\n10.1038/366362a0\n10.1038/ng.946\n10.1038/s41467-018-04540-x\n10.1038/nature10716\n10.1093/nar/gks1221\n10.1038/nature11247\n10.1074/jbc.R113.512517\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.03.027\n10.1038/s41467-017-01586-1\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.029\n10.1126/science.aar3146\n10.1101/gad.239749.114\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.072\n10.1038/nature11082\n10.1016/j.molcel.2017.08.006\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.12.009\n10.1093/nar/gkw691\n10.1038/s41467-018-03082-6\n10.1101/gr.131201.111\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.07.012\n10.1038/ncomms3262\n10.1182/bloodadvances.2017005710\n10.1186/s13148-018-0450-y\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.04.007\n10.1038/ng1057\n10.1016/j.patter.2020.100014\n10.1186/s13059-016-1066-1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.300297\n10.1371/journal.pone.0191319\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324\n10.1101/gr.107524.110\n10.1038/ng.806\n10.1002/0471250953.bi1110s43.From\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btn224\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts680\n10.1186/1471-2105-13-86\n10.1101/gr.139105.112\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btz202\n10.1093/nar/gkt214\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt656"}
{"title": "Myocardial involvement in coronavirus disease 19.", "abstract": "In late 2019, a\u00a0cohort of patients presenting with pneumonia of unclear etiology in Wuhan, China, heralded the outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beta-coronavirus infections have been associated with tachyarrhythmias and signs and symptoms of heart failure. The emergence of SARS coronavirus\u00a02 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, has rapidly developed into a\u00a0pandemic, and a\u00a0large number of infected patients have been reported to have underlying cardiovascular disease.\nSince there are only scant published data regarding cardiovascular burden in the wake of viral epidemics, this study aimed to evaluate cardiac involvement in COVID-19.\nThis prospective cohort study included 40 adult inpatients at two centers in Germany. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were included in the study, which focused on the potential cardiac involvement of SARS-CoV\u20112. It was based on laboratory parameters as well as electro- and echocardiographic values to determine the impact of SARS-CoV\u20112 virus on heart tissues.\nThe conducted investigations confirmed the relationship between the presence of acute cardiac injury and COVID-19.\nMyocardial injury and impaired myocardial function due to COVID-19 are common; however, no correlation was established between cardiac laboratory or echocardiographic values and mortality. Cardiovascular monitoring upon COVID-19 infection is crucial to determine the burden of cardiac involvement.\nHINTERGRUND: Ende 2019 markierte eine Kohorte von Patienten aus Wuhan, China, die sich mit Pneumonie unklarer \u00c4tiologie vorstellten, den Ausbruch der \u201ecoronavirus disease\u00a019\u201c (COVID-19).

Bei einer Gro\u00dfzahl infizierter Patienten wird \u00fcber eine bestehende Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankung berichtet. ZIEL: Da die publizierten Daten zur kardiovaskul\u00e4ren Last im Rahmen von Virusepidemien nur sp\u00e4rlich sind, wurde in der vorliegenden Studie die kardiale Beteiligung bei COVID-19 untersucht.\nIn die prospektive Kohortenstudie wurden 40 erwachsene station\u00e4re Patienten aus zwei deutschen Zentren eingeschlossen. Einschluss fanden erwachsene Patienten mit COVID-19-Diagnose gem\u00e4\u00df dem vorl\u00e4ufigen Leitfaden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO). Die Studie konzentrierte sich auf die potenzielle kardiale Beteiligung von SARS-CoV\u20112. Auf Basis von Laborparametern sowie elektro- und echokardiographischen Daten wurde der Einfluss des SARS-CoV-2-Virus auf Herzgewebe bestimmt.\nDie Untersuchungen best\u00e4tigten die Beziehung zwischen dem Vorliegen akuter kardialer Sch\u00e4den und COVID-19.\nCOVID-19-bedingte Myokardsch\u00e4den und Myokardfunktionsst\u00f6rungen sind h\u00e4ufig, es fand sich jedoch keine Korrelation zwischen kardialen Labor- oder echokardiographischen Werten und der Mortalit\u00e4t.

{"title": "Advances in 3D bioprinting technology for cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is still one of the leading causes of death in the world, and heart transplantation is the current major treatment for end-stage cardiovascular diseases. However, because of the shortage of heart donors, new sources of cardiac regenerative medicine are greatly needed. The prominent development of tissue engineering using bioactive materials has creatively laid a direct promising foundation. Whereas, how to precisely pattern a cardiac structure with complete biological function still requires technological breakthroughs. Recently, the emerging three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology for tissue engineering has shown great advantages in generating micro-scale cardiac tissues, which has established its impressive potential as a novel foundation for cardiovascular regeneration. Whether 3D bioprinted hearts can replace traditional heart transplantation as a novel strategy for treating cardiovascular diseases in the future is a frontier issue.

Adriamycin has a much stronger affinity for myocardial tissue than other body tissues. Cancer patients treated with adriamycin are prone to toxic damage to heart tissue. Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is a novel antioxidant enzyme in metabolic diseases, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of PRDX6 in myocardial injury.\nSixty male specific-pathogen-free Wistar rats were enrolled and divided equally into the control group (control), the Adriamycin group, the Adriamycin + empty vector lentivirus (Adriamycin + LV) group, and the Adriamycin + Peroxiredoxin 6 overexpression (Adriamycin + PRDX6) group. Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and immunohistochemistry were used in this research.\nThe myocardial tissues of the Adriamycin group had significantly lower expression levels of PRDX6 and PRDX6 mRNA than those of the control group, and the myocardial tissues of the Adriamycin + PRDX6 rats had significantly higher expression levels of PRDX6 and PRDX6 mRNA than those of the Adriamycin + LV group.

{"title": "JavaCyte, a novel open-source tool for automated quantification of key hallmarks of cardiac structural remodeling.", "abstract": "Many cardiac pathologies involve changes in tissue structure. Conventional analysis of structural features is extremely time-consuming and subject to observer bias. The possibility to determine spatial interrelations between these features is often not fully exploited. We developed a staining protocol and an ImageJ-based tool (JavaCyte) for automated histological analysis of cardiac structure, including quantification of cardiomyocyte size, overall and endomysial fibrosis, spatial patterns of endomysial fibrosis, fibroblast density, capillary density and capillary size. This automated analysis was compared to manual quantification in several well-characterized goat models of atrial fibrillation (AF). In addition, we tested inter-observer variability in atrial biopsies from the CATCH-ME consortium atrial tissue bank, with patients stratified by their cardiovascular risk profile for structural remodeling. We were able to reproduce previous manually derived histological findings in goat models for AF and AV block (AVB) using JavaCyte. Furthermore, strong correlation was found between manual and automated observations for myocyte count (r\u2009=\u20090.94, p\u2009<\u20090.001), myocyte diameter (r\u2009=\u20090.97, p\u2009<\u20090.001), endomysial fibrosis (r\u2009=\u20090.98, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and capillary count (r\u2009=\u20090.95, p\u2009<\u20090.001) in human biopsies. No significant variation between observers was observed (ICC\u2009=\u20090.89, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

{"title": "VEGF-B Promotes Endocardium-Derived Coronary Vessel Development and Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "Recent discoveries have indicated that, in the developing heart, sinus venosus and endocardium provide major sources of endothelium for coronary vessel growth that supports the expanding myocardium. Here we set out to study the origin of the coronary vessels that develop in response to vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) in the heart and the effect of VEGF-B on recovery from myocardial infarction.\nWe used mice and rats expressing a VEGF-B transgene, VEGF-B-gene-deleted mice and rats, apelin-CreERT, and natriuretic peptide receptor 3-CreERT recombinase-mediated genetic cell lineage tracing and viral vector-mediated VEGF-B gene transfer in adult mice. Left anterior descending coronary vessel ligation was performed, and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine-mediated proliferating cell cycle labeling; flow cytometry; histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical methods; single-cell RNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis; microcomputed tomography; and fluorescent- and tracer-mediated vascular perfusion imaging analyses were used to study the development and function of the VEGF-B-induced vessels in the heart.\nWe show that cardiomyocyte overexpression of VEGF-B in mice and rats during development promotes the growth of novel vessels that originate directly from the cardiac ventricles and maintain connection with the coronary vessels in subendocardial myocardium. In adult mice, endothelial proliferation induced by VEGF-B gene transfer was located predominantly in the subendocardial coronary vessels. Furthermore, VEGF-B gene transduction before or concomitantly with ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery promoted endocardium-derived vessel development into the myocardium and improved cardiac tissue remodeling and cardiac function.\nThe myocardial VEGF-B transgene promotes the formation of endocardium-derived coronary vessels during development, endothelial proliferation in subendocardial myocardium in adult mice, and structural and functional rescue of cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction. VEGF-B could provide a new therapeutic strategy for cardiac neovascularization after coronary occlusion to rescue the most vulnerable myocardial tissue.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2020-11-19", "authors": ["MarkusR\u00e4s\u00e4nen", "IbrahimSultan", "JenniferPaech", "Karthik AmudhalaHemanthakumar", "WeiYu", "LiqunHe", "JuanTang", "YingSun", "RuslanHlushchuk", "XiuzhengHuan", "EmmaArmstrong", "Oleksiy-ZakharKhoma", "EeroMervaala", "ValentinDjonov", "ChristerBetsholtz", "BinZhou", "RiikkaKivel\u00e4", "KariAlitalo"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050635"}

{"title": "Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors for Millimetric-Scale Temperature Monitoring of Cardiac Tissue Undergoing Radiofrequency Ablation: A Feasibility Assessment.", "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most widely used technique for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. A variety of factors, such as the electrode tip shape, the force exerted on the tissue by the catheter and the delivered power, combine to determine the temperature distribution, and as consequence, the lesion shape and size. In this context, being able to know the temperature reached in the myocardium during the RFA can be helpful for predicting the lesion dimensions to prevent the occurrence of undesired tissue damage. The catheters used so far in such procedures provide single-point temperature measurements within the probe (by means of embedded thermocouples or thermistors), so no information regarding the temperature changes occurring in myocardial tissues can be retrieved. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBGs) to perform multi-point and millimetric-scale temperature measurements within myocardium subjected to RFA. The assessment has been performed on ex vivo porcine myocardium specimens undergoing RFA. Data show the feasibility of the proposed solution in providing spatial temperature distribution within the myocardial tissue during the entire RFA. These high-resolved measurements may allow reconstructing the temperature distribution in the tissue. This study lays the foundations for the implementation of 3D thermal maps to investigate how the supplied power, treatment time, force of contact and irrigation flow of the catheter influence the thermal effects within the tissue.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-11-19", "authors": ["MartinaZaltieri", "GretaAllegretti", "CarloMassaroni", "EmilianoSchena", "Filippo MariaCauti"], "doi": "10.3390/s20226490\n10.1253/circj.CJ-13-1129\n10.1161/01.CIR.89.3.1074\n10.1046/j.1460-9592.2003.00123.x\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.961169\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2004.04.019\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1996.tb00511.x\n10.1056/NEJM199902183400707\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2005.50135.x\n10.1007/s10840-013-9824-4\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1991.tb01353.x\n10.1016/j.jacep.2018.03.020\n10.1161/01.CIR.86.5.1469\n10.1161/01.CIR.90.3.1279\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a059422\n10.1016/j.jacep.2019.12.015\n10.1046/j.1460-9592.2003.00123.x\n10.1186/s12968-017-0323-0\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.942433\n10.1016/S0301-5629(01)00519-1\n10.1109/10.398644\n10.1080/02656730500159103\n10.3109/02656736.2014.922221\n10.1016/j.yofte.2018.03.007\n10.3390/s20113200\n10.1007/978-1-4615-5787-6_11\n10.1063/1.89881\n10.1016/S0017-9310(03)00301-6\n10.1016/j.jacep.2017.08.016\n10.3390/s16071144"}

Diabetes is associated with profound pathophysiological changes in the heart. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of diabetes on gene expression and DNA methylation in cardiac cells.\nTranscriptome analysis of heart tissue from mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes revealed only 39 genes regulated, whereas cell type-specific analysis of the diabetic heart was more sensitive and more specific than heart tissue analysis and revealed a total of 3205 differentially regulated genes in five cell types. Whole genome DNA methylation analysis with basepair resolution of distinct cardiac cell types identified highly specific DNA methylation signatures of genic and regulatory regions. Interestingly, despite marked changes in gene expression, DNA methylation remained stable in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Integrated analysis of cell type-specific gene expression enabled us to assign the particular contribution of single cell types to the pathophysiology of the diabetic heart. Finally, analysis of gene regulation revealed ligand-receptor pairs as potential mediators of heterocellular interaction in the diabetic heart, with fibroblasts and monocytes showing the highest degree of interaction.\nIn summary, cell type-specific analysis reveals differentially regulated gene programs that are associated with distinct biological processes in diabetes.

These include adult stem cell populations (mesenchymal stem cells) and pluripotent stem cells (including autologous human induced pluripotent stem cells or allogenic human embryonic stem cells) with the latter undergoing differentiation to form functional cardiac cells. The ideal biomaterial for cardiac tissue engineering needs to have suitable material properties with the ability to support efficient attachment, growth, and differentiation of the cardiac cells, leading to the formation of functional cardiac tissue. In this review, we have focused on the use of biomaterials of natural origin for CTE. Natural biomaterials are generally known to be highly biocompatible and in addition are sustainable in nature. We have focused on those that have been widely explored in CTE and describe the original work and the current state of art. These include fibrinogen (in the context of Engineered Heart Tissue, EHT), collagen, alginate, silk, and Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Amongst these, fibrinogen, collagen, alginate, and silk are isolated from natural sources whereas PHAs are produced via bacterial fermentation. Overall, these biomaterials have proven to be highly promising, displaying robust biocompatibility and, when combined with cells, an ability to enhance post-MI cardiac function in pre-clinical models. As such, CTE has great potential for future clinical solutions and hence can lead to a considerable reduction in mortality rates due to CVD.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine",

{"title": "Inflammatory Cytokines Alter Mesenchymal Stem Cell Mechanosensing and Adhesion on Stiffened Infarct Heart Tissue After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has demonstrated its potential in repairing infarct heart tissue and recovering heart function after myocardial infarction (MI). However, its therapeutic effect is still limited due to poor MSC engraftment at the injury site whose tissue stiffness and local inflammation both dynamically and rapidly change after MI. Whether and how inflammatory cytokines could couple with stiffness change to affect MSC engraftment in the infarct zone still remain unclear. In this study, we characterized dynamic stiffness changes of and inflammatory cytokine expression in the infarct region of rat heart within a month after MI. We found that the tissue stiffness of the heart tissue gradually increased and peaked 21 days after MI along with the rapid upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in the first 3 days, followed by a sharp decline.

Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3), an activator of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), has been identified to elicit anti-inflammatory effects via the NF-\u03baB pathway. However, the function of Rg3 in MI remains unknown. In the present study, a MI rat model was established by coronary artery ligation and treated with Rg3 to explore whether Rg3 could inhibit inflammation in MI rats by inhibiting the SIRT1/NF-\u03baB pathway. At 28 days post-MI, it was identified that Rg3 not only decreased the ST-segment ECG values in MI rats, but also significantly decreased serum LDH, CK-MB and cTnI levels in MI rats. In addition, Rg3 also significantly decreased serum tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels and increased serum IL-10 levels in MI rats. In the heart tissues of the MI rats, Rg3 attenuated myocardial pathological changes and cell apoptosis caused by MI, decreased the gene expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, but increased the gene expression level of IL-10. In addition, the expression levels of the SIRT1 and transcription factor RelB proteins were significantly increased following Rg3 treatment, and the expression level of p-p65/p65 protein was significantly decreased in the heart tissues of MI rats with Rg3 treatment compared with that in heart tissues of MI rats without Rg3 treatment.

While glucose tolerance was significantly improved in empagliflozin treated mice, body weight and fasting insulin levels were comparable in both groups. Cardiac insulin signaling activity indicated by reduced proteinkinase B (AKT) phosphorylation was significantly decreased in the empagliflozin treated group. Remarkably, mitochondrial mass estimated by citrate synthase activity was significantly elevated in empagliflozin treated mice. Accordingly, mitochondrial morphology was significantly altered upon treatment with empagliflozin as analysed by transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, short-term empagliflozin therapy was associated with a changed cardiac tissue cytokine expression in favor of an anti-inflammatory pattern.

The survival rate, body weight, myocardial histopathological changes, viral load, cytokine levels and antiviral gene expression in cardiac tissues of both groups were investigated. Our study indicated that the expression of Senp2 in primary cardiomyocytes was upregulated by CVB3 infection. Moreover, deletion of Senp2 in the heart exacerbated CVB3 infection-induced myocarditis, facilitated CVB3 viral replication and downregulated the expression of antiviral proteins. In conclusion, our findings suggest a protective role for SENP2 in CVB3-induced VMC.", "journal": "International immunopharmacology", "date": "2020-11-14", "authors": ["KangweiWang", "ZaixueJiang", "XiaomeiLu", "YaozhongZhang", "XuYuan", "DongLuo", "ZitianLin", "YongZuo", "QingmingLuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106941"}
{"title": "Chitosan-stabilized selenium nanoparticles alleviate cardio-hepatic damage in type 2 diabetes mellitus model via regulation of caspase, Bax/Bcl-2, and Fas/FasL-pathway.", "abstract": "The present study was carried out to explore a novel strategy with the hypothesis that the combined treatment with standard antidiabetic drug metformin (MET) and chitosan stabilized nanoparticles (CTS-Se-NPs) may have a potential role on insulin level, hepatic damage and apoptosis, and cardiac injury markers of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in rat model. T2DM was induced by a high fat diet (HFD) for 8\u00a0weeks and a single injection of a low dose streptozotocin (STZ) (35\u00a0mg/kg) in Sprague Dawley rats. A total number of one hundred rats were divided into five groups; the first served as a control (non-diabetic) group and the other four groups served as diabetic rats. The treatments were even mono or combined therapy by CTS-Se-NPs and/or MET for 8\u00a0weeks. A group was given only MET (500\u00a0mg/kg bw/day), another was administered only CTS-Se-NPs at a dose of 2\u00a0mg se/kg/day, while the last group was given both of them (co-treated group). Biochemical, molecular and histopathological analyses were conducted to figure out the efficiency of the treatment by the monotherapeutic mode or combination therapy on the insulin level, oxidants/antioxidants status, inflammatory mediators, hepatic and cardiac injury biomarkers and apoptotic/anti-apoptotic gene expressions. Our results indicated that HFD/STZ-induced toxic effects on the serum, hepatic and cardiac tissues including a remarkable elevation of the oxidative and inflammatory mediators, and up-regulation of the apoptotic genes (Bax, Caspase-3, Fas, Fas-L) expression. Histologically, the heart tissue revealed various degenerative, vascular and inflammatory alterations characteristic to murine cardiomyopathy. Besides, livers from HFD-STZ-treated rats showed numerous cytotoxic, circulatory and inflammatory alterations. Combined therapy with MET and CTS-Se-NPs resulted in a better remarkable anti-diabetic effect demonstrated by substantial decreases in fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and elevated with up-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene (BCL-2) and down-regulation of apoptotic genes after 8\u00a0weeks of treatment than that revealed in the monotherapeutic strategy. In addition, it ameliorated the damage of cardiac and hepatic tissues and reduced lipid accumulation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and restored the antioxidant capacity. It could be concluded that, the combined strategy applied in the current study have a potential role to limit the diabetic complications and restore insulin resistance to a higher extent than monotherapeutic strategy and could be considered a promising therapeutic alternative in T2DM rat model.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2020-11-13", "authors": ["Amany Abdel-RahmanMohamed", "Safaa IKhater", "AhmedHamed Arisha", "Mohamed M MMetwally", "GomaaMostafa-Hedeab", "Eman SEl-Shetry"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2020.145288"}

{"title": "A Pilot Study of Cardiac MRI in Breast Cancer Survivors After Cardiotoxic Chemotherapy and Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy.", "abstract": "Node-positive breast cancer patients often receive chemotherapy and regional nodal irradiation. The cardiotoxic effects of these treatments, however, may offset some of the survival benefit. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an emerging modality to assess cardiac injury. This is a pilot trial assessing cardiac damage using CMR in patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) regional nodal irradiation using heart constraints.\nNode-positive breast cancer patients (2000-2008) treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and 3DCRT regional nodal irradiation (including the internal mammary chain nodes) with heart ventricular constraints (V25 < 10%) were invited to participate. Cardiac tissues were contoured and analyzed separately for whole heart (pericardium) and for combined ventricles and left atrium (myocardium). CMR obtained ventricular function/dimensions, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), global longitudinal strain (GLS), and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as measures of cardiac injury and/or early fibrosis. CMR parameters were correlated with dose-volume constraints using Spearman correlations.\nFifteen left-sided and five right-sided patients underwent CMR. Median diagnosis age was 50 (32-77). No patients had baseline cardiac disease before regional nodal irradiation. Median time after 3DCRT was 8.3 years (5.2-14.4). Median left-sided mean heart dose (MHD) was 4.8 Gy (1.1-11.2) and V25 was 5.7% (0-12%). Median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 63%. No abnormal LGE was observed. No correlations were seen between whole heart doses and LVEF, LV mass, GLS, or LV dimensions. Increasing ECV did not correlate with increased heart or ventricular doses. However, correlations between higher LV mass and ventricular mean dose, V10, and V25 were seen.\nAt a median follow-up of 8.3 years, this cohort of node-positive breast cancer patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and regional nodal irradiation had no clinically abnormal CMR findings. However, correlations between ventricular mean dose, V10, and V25 and LV mass were seen.

{"title": "Shikonin Ameliorates LPS-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction by SIRT1-Dependent Inhibition of NLRP3 Inflammasome.", "abstract": "Shikonin (SHI) is an anti-inflammatory agent extracted from natural herbs. It is still unknown whether SHI ameliorates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac dysfunction. This study aims to explore the protective effects of SHI on LPS-induced myocardial injury and its mechanism. The LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction mouse model was employed to investigate the protective effects of SHI. In the present study, we found that SHI treatment improved the survival rate and cardiac function and remarkably ameliorated the release of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration in heart tissue of LPS-treated mice.

In addition, SHI significantly upregulated silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) expression and suppressed the upregulation of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, and caspase-1 activity in heart tissues induced by LPS.

{"title": "High prevalence of Babesia microti in small mammals in Beijing.", "abstract": "Babesiosis is an emerging tick-borne zoonotic infectious disease. Babesia microti is responsible for most cases of human babesiosis globally. It is important to investigate the prevalence of B. microti in the mammalian host population of a specific region in order to elucidate mechanisms of pathogen transmission and to define geographic areas where humans face the greatest risk of exposure. The aim of this study is to understand the prevalence and genotypes of B. microti in the small mammals that are found in Beijing, China.\nWe trapped small mammals from all of the 16 urban, suburban, and outer suburban districts of Beijing during the years 2014, 2017 and 2018. Genomic DNA was extracted from the heart tissues individually and the Babesia 18S rRNA gene was detected by PCR. The genotypes of B. microti were identified based on sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis. The morphology of the parasites was observed under light microscopy. The risk factors were analyzed statistically based on both univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression.\nA total of 1391 small mammals were collected. Positive infection of B. microti was detected in 12.1% (168/1391) of small mammals from 15 out of the 16 districts. Both Kobe-type and U.S.-type B. microti, accounting for 9.5% and 2.7%, respectively, were identified. Classic diverse morphologic forms of B. microti were observed. Specific types of ecological habitats including shrub areas, broad-leaved forest, and cropland were revealed to be risk factors associated with B. microti infection.\nThis study demonstrated the wide prevalence of B. microti infection in eight species of small mammals in Beijing, with Kobe-type more prevalent than U.S.-type. This study provides fundamental information for the development of informed prevention and control measures by public health authorities; the data gathered indicates a need for further monitoring of both clinical diseases in individuals presenting with babesiosis-like symptoms, as well as the infection status of ticks in high risk areas.", "journal": "Infectious diseases of poverty", "date": "2020-11-13", "authors": ["Chun-YanWei", "Xiao-MeiWang", "Zhen-ShengWang", "Zhi-HuaWang", "Zeng-ZhiGuan", "Lian-HuiZhang", "Xiang-FengDou", "HengWang"], "doi": "10.1186/s40249-020-00775-3\n10.1128/CMR.00083-18\n10.3201/eid2208.150195\n10.20506/rst.34.2.2385\n10.1016/j.ttbdis.2009.11.003\n10.1128/JCM.00504-17\n10.1128/CMR.13.3.451\n10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.79\n10.1016/j.ijppaw.2012.11.003\n10.1016/j.ijpara.2018.11.007\n10.1292/jvms.66.785\n10.1292/jvms.67.825\n10.1093/molbev/msw054\n10.1016/j.ttbdis.2015.10.010\n10.1128/JCM.39.6.2178-2183.2001\n10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00177-2\n10.1017/S0950268817001686\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0005898\n10.1089/vbz.2017.2196\n10.1007/s00436-016-5128-9\n10.1017/S0031182008004356\n10.1128/JCM.39.12.4316-4322.2001\n10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.04.014\n10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.01.003\n10.3341/kjo.2013.27.5.316\n10.1128/JCM.00027-08"}
{"title": "Micromechanical poroelastic and viscoelastic properties of ex-vivo soft tissues.", "abstract": "Soft biological tissues demonstrate strong time-dependent mechanical behavior, arising from their intrinsic viscoelasticity and fluid flow-induced poroelasticity. It is increasingly recognized that time-dependent mechanical properties of soft tissues influence their physiological functions and are linked to several pathological processes. Nevertheless, soft tissue time-dependent characteristics, especially their micromechanical variation with tissue composition and location, remain poorly understood. Nanoindentation is a well-established technique to measure local elastic properties but has not been fully explored to determine micro-scale time-dependent properties of soft tissues. Here, a nanoindentation-based experimental strategy is implemented to characterize the micro-scale poroelastic and viscoelastic behavior of mouse heart, kidney, and liver tissues. It is demonstrated that heart tissue exhibits substantial mechanical heterogeneity where the elastic modulus varies spatially from 1 to 30\u00a0kPa. In contrast, both kidney and liver tissues show relatively homogeneous response with elastic modulus 0.5-3\u00a0kPa. All three tissues demonstrate marked load relaxation under constant indentation, where the relaxation behavior is observed to be largely dominated by tissue viscoelasticity. Intrinsic permeability varies among different tissues, where heart tissue is found to be less permeable compared to kidney and liver tissues. Overall, the results presented herein provide key insights into the time-dependent micromechanical behavior of different tissues and can therefore contribute to studies of tissue pathology and tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2020-11-12", "authors": ["Mohammad RIslam", "JitkaVirag", "Michelle LOyen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2020.110090"}
{"title": "Capturing Cardiogenesis in Gastruloids.", "abstract": "Organoids are powerful models for studying tissue development, physiology, and disease. However, current culture systems disrupt the inductive tissue-tissue interactions needed for the complex morphogenetic processes of native organogenesis. Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be coaxed to robustly undergo fundamental steps of early heart organogenesis with an in-vivo-like spatiotemporal fidelity. These axially patterned embryonic organoids (gastruloids) mimic embryonic development and support the generation of cardiovascular progenitors, including first and second heart fields. The cardiac progenitors self-organize into an anterior domain reminiscent of a cardiac crescent before forming a beating cardiac tissue near a putative primitive gut-like tube, from which it is separated by an endocardial-like layer. These findings unveil the surprising morphogenetic potential of mESCs to execute key aspects of organogenesis through the coordinated development of multiple tissues.

{"title": "Immunohistochemical detection of Lp25 and LipL32 proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscles of fatal human leptospirosis.", "abstract": "Leptospirosis is an acute infection caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira, which affects humans and animals in all world. In severe forms of the disease, kidneys, liver and lungs are the main affected organs, resulting in acute kidney injury, jaundice and pulmonary hemorrhage. Previous post-mortem studies have shown that lesions are not limited to these organs. Cardiac and striated muscle injuries have already been reported, but the pathophysiology of cardiac and skeletal lesions in leptospirosis is not fully understood. It has been suggested that the tissue damage observed in leptospirosis could be directly mediated by leptospires or by their toxic cellular components. LipL32 and Lp25 are leptospira membrane proteins with unknown functions, that are present only in pathogenic strains of Leptospira spp. Both proteins induce skeletal muscle lesions similar to those observed when normal guinea pigs are inoculated with leptospires. Through immunohistochemistry, this study showed the presence of LipL32 and Lp25 proteins on muscle cell membranes and in the underlying cytoplasm of skeletal muscles, as well as focal lesions in cardiac tissues of fatal cases of leptospirosis. Altogether, these results reinforce that both proteins can be important factors in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.", "journal": "Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo", "date": "2020-11-12", "authors": ["Silvia D'AndrettaIglezias", "Patr\u00edcia Antonia EstimaAbreu", "CristinaKanamura", "Antonio Jos\u00e9Magaldi", "Antonio CarlosSeguro", "Thales DeBrito"], "doi": "10.1590/S1678-9946202062085"}
{"title": "Identification of circulating hub long noncoding RNAs associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using weighted correlation network analysis.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most commonly inherited heart diseases and the leading cause of sudden cardiac death among adolescents and young adults. Circulating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have demonstrated potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in several cardiovascular diseases. However, the circulating extracellular lncRNA expression profile of patients with HCM remains unclear. Plasma lncRNA expression was evaluated in patients with HCM and healthy controls using a human lncRNA microarray. A weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and linear models for microarray data (Limma) were used. GSE68316 data from cardiac tissue in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were analysed for further validation. Using WGCNA, two modules (referred to as the magenta and the light\u2011yellow module) were identified that were positively associated with HCM. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that lncRNAs in the magenta module targeted 'heart growth'. Using Limma, a total of 290 lncRNAs were differentially expressed (210 upregulated and 80 downregulated) in the plasma of HCM patients, compared with controls. Moreover, combined WGCNA and Limma analysis demonstrated that 27 hub lncRNAs in the magenta module and 13 hub lncRNAs in the light\u2011yellow module were significantly upregulated, compared with the controls. Moreover, of the 40 differentially expressed hub lncRNAs identified in the two modules, three circulating lncRNAs (lnc\u2011P2RY6\u20111:1, ENST00000488040 and ENST00000588047) were also significantly upregulated in the HCM cardiac tissue validation dataset.

{"title": "Ameliorative effects and mechanism of crocetin in arsenic trioxide\u2011induced cardiotoxicity in rats.", "abstract": "Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is commonly used to treat patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia since it was authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the 1970s, but its applicability has been limited by its cardiotoxic effects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects and underlying mechanism of crocetin (CRT), the critical ingredient of saffron. Sprague\u2011Dawley rats were then randomly divided into four groups (n=10/group): i)\u00a0Control group; ii)\u00a0ATO group, iii)\u00a0CRT\u2011low (20\u00a0mg/kg) group; and iv)\u00a0CRT\u2011high (40\u00a0mg/kg) group. Rats in the Control and ATO groups were intraperitoneally injected with equal volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and CRT groups were administered with either 20\u00a0and\u00a040\u00a0mg/kg CRT. Following 6\u00a0h, all groups except the Control group were intraperitoneally injected with 5\u00a0mg/kg ATO over 10\u00a0days. Cardiotoxicity was indicated by changes in electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns, morphology and marker enzymes. Histomorphological changes in the heart tissue were observed by pathological staining. The levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde and catalase in the serum were analyzed using colometric commercial assay kits, and the levels of reactive oxygen species in the heart tissue were detected using the fluorescent probe dihydroethidium. The expression levels of inflammatory factors and activities of apoptosis\u2011related proteins were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of silent information regulator of transcription 1 were measured using western blotting. Cardiotoxicity was induced in male Sprague\u2011Dawley rats with ATO (5\u00a0mg/kg). CRT (20\u00a0and\u00a040\u00a0mg/kg) and ATO were co\u2011administered to evaluate possible cardioprotective effects. CRT significantly reduced the heart rate and J\u2011point elevation induced by ATO in rats. Histological changes were evaluated via hematoxylin and eosin staining. CRT decreased the levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione\u2011peroxidase and catalase, and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, CRT downregulated the expression levels of the pro\u2011inflammatory factors IL\u20111, TNF\u2011\u03b1, IL\u20116, Bax and p65, as well as increased the expression of Bcl\u20112. It was also identified that CRT enhanced silent information regulator of transcription 1 protein expression. Thus, the present study demonstrated that CRT treatment effectively ameliorated ATO\u2011induced cardiotoxicity. The protective effects of CRT can be attributed to the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Therefore, CRT represents a promising therapeutic method for improving the cardiotoxic side effects caused by ATO treatment, and additional clinical applications are possible, but warrant further investigation.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2020-11-12", "authors": ["ZhifengZhao", "JinghanLi", "BinZheng", "YingranLiang", "JingShi", "JianpingZhang", "XueHan", "LiChu", "XiChu", "YonggangGao"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2020.11587"}

{"title": "Evaluation of the bilateral cardiac afferent distribution at the spinal and vagal ganglia by retrograde labeling.", "abstract": "The identity of sensory neurons innervating the heart tissue and the extent of information reported to the brain via these neurons are poorly understood. In order to evaluate the multidimensional distribution and abundance of the cardiac spinal and vagal afferents, we assessed the retrograde labeling efficiency of various tracers, and mapped the cardiac afferents qualitatively and quantitatively at the bilateral nodose ganglia (NGs) and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). From the five different retrograde tracers evaluated, Di-8-ANEPPQ yielded reproducibly the highest labeling efficiency of cardiac afferents. We demonstrated specific cardiac afferents at NGs and C4 to T11 DRG segments. Next, the 2D reconstruction of the tissue sections and 3D imaging of the whole NGs and DRGs revealed homogeneous and bilateral distribution of cardiac afferents. The quantitative analyses of the labeled cardiac afferents demonstrated approximately 5-6% of the soma in NGs that were equally distributed bilaterally. The neuronal character of Di-8-ANEPPQ labeled cells were validated by coimmunostaning with pan-neuronal marker Tuj-1. In addition, the cell diameters of labeled cardiac sensory neurons were found smaller than 20\u00a0\u03bcm, implying the nociceptor phenotype confirmed by co-labeling with TRPV1 and Di-8-ANEPPQ. Importantly, co-labeling with two distinct tracers Di-8-ANEPPQ and WGA-647 demonstrated exclusively the same cardiac afferents in DRGs and NGs, validating our findings. Collectively, our findings revealed the cardiac afferents in NGs bilaterally and DRGs with the highest labeling efficiency reported, spatial distribution and quantitation at both 2D and 3D levels, furthering our understanding of this novel neuron population.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2020-11-11", "authors": ["TAkgul Caglar", "Z BDurdu", "M UTurhan", "M YGunal", "M SAyd\u0131n", "GOzturk", "ECagavi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.brainres.2020.147201"}
{"title": "Deubiquitinase Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 10 Deficiency Regulates Sirt6 signaling and Exacerbates Cardiac Hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Background Cardiac hypertrophy (CH) is a physiological response that compensates for blood pressure overload. Under pathological conditions, hypertrophy can progress to heart failure as a consequence of the disorganized growth of cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue. USP10 (ubiquitin-specific protease 10) is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family of cysteine proteases, which are involved in viral infection, oxidative stress, lipid drop formation, and heat shock. However, the role of USP10 in CH remains largely unclear. Here, we investigated the roles of USP10 in CH. Methods and Results Cardiac-specific USP10 knockout (USP10-CKO) mice and USP10-transgenic (USP10-TG) mice were used to examined the role of USP10 in CH following aortic banding. The specific functions of USP10 were further examined in isolated cardiomyocytes. USP10 expression was increased in murine hypertrophic hearts following aortic banding and in isolated cardiomyocytes in response to hypertrophic agonist. Mice deficient in USP10 in the heart exhibited exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis following pressure overload stress, which resulted in worsening of cardiac contractile function. In contrast, cardiac overexpression of USP10 protected against pressure overload-induced maladaptive CH. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that USP10 activation and interaction with Sirt6 in response to angiotensin II led to a marked increase in the ubiquitination of Sirt6 and resulted in Akt signaling downregulation and attenuation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Accordingly, inactivation of USP10 reduced Sirt6 abundance and stability and diminished Sirt6-induced downstream signaling in cardiomyocytes. Conclusions USP10 functions as a Sirt6 deubiquitinase that induces cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and triggers maladaptive CH.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2020-11-11", "authors": ["Dian-HongZhang", "Jie-LeiZhang", "ZhenHuang", "Lei-MingWu", "Zhong-MinWang", "Ya-PengLi", "Xin-YuTian", "Ling-YaoKong", "RuiYao", "Yan-ZhouZhang"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.120.017751"}

To this end, we have used mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction and imaged adjacent cardiac tissue sections by microfocus X-ray diffraction and second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging. In this way, the acto-myosin structure was probed in a spatially resolved manner for entire heart sections. From the recorded diffraction data, spatial maps of diffraction intensity, anisotropy and orientation were obtained, and fully automated analysis depicted the acto-myosin filament spacing and direction. X-ray diffraction\u00a0presented an overview of entire heart sections and revealed that in regions of severe cardiac remodeling the muscle mass is partly replaced by connective tissue and the acto-myosin lattice spacing is increased at these regions. SHG imaging revealed sub-cellular structure of cardiac tissue and complemented the findings from X-ray diffraction by revealing micro-level distortion of myofibrils, immune cell infiltration at regions of cardiac remodeling and the development of fibrosis down to the scale of a single collagen fibril.

Thirty male rats were randomized into 5 groups: (1) sham; (2) control; (3) \u03c9-3 PUFA; (4) AA; (5) \u03c9-3 PUFA + AA. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced and untreated for 6 min followed by defibrillation after 8 min of CPR. Infusion of drug or vehicle occurred at the start of CPR.

{"title": "3D bioprinting of mechanically tuned bioinks derived from cardiac decellularized extracellular matrix.", "abstract": "3D bioprinting is a powerful technique for engineering tissues used to study cell behavior and tissue properties in vitro. With the right formulation and printing parameters, bioinks can provide native biological and mechanical cues while allowing for versatile 3D structures that recapitulate tissue-level organization. Bio-based materials that support cellular adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation - including gelatin, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and alginate - have been successfully used as bioinks. In particular, decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) has become a promising material with the unique ability to maintain both biochemical and topographical micro-environments of native tissues. However, dECM has shown technical limitations for 3D printing (3DP) applications posed by its intrinsically low mechanical stability. Herein, we report hydrogel bioinks composed of partially digested, porcine cardiac decellularized extracellular matrix (cdECM), Laponite-XLG nanoclay, and poly(ethylene glycol)-diacrylate (PEG-DA). The Laponite facilitated extrusion-based 3DP, while PEG-DA enabled photo-polymerization after printing. Improving upon previously reported bioinks derived from dECM, our bioinks combine extrudability, shape fidelity, rapid cross-linking, and cytocompatibility in a single formulation (> 97% viability of encapsulated human cardiac fibroblasts and > 94% viability of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes after 7 days). The compressive modulus of the cured hydrogel bioinks was tunable from 13.4-89 kPa by changing the concentration of PEG-DA in the bioink formulation. Importantly, this span of mechanical stiffness encompasses ranges of tissue stiffness from healthy (compressive modulus ~5-15 kPa) to fibrotic (compressive modulus ~30-100 kPa) cardiac tissue states. The printed constructs demonstrated shape fidelity, adaptability to different printing conditions, and high cell viability following extrusion and photo-polymerization, highlighting the potential for applications in modeling both healthy and fibrotic cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2020-11-10", "authors": ["Yu JungShin", "Ryan TShafranek", "Jonathan HTsui", "JelishaWalcott", "AlshakimNelson", "Deok-HoKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2020.11.006"}
{"title": "Bioactivation of clozapine by mitochondria of the murine heart: Possible cause of cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "The mechanism of clozapine-associated cardiotoxicity has not been elucidated. The formation of a reactive nitrenium ion from the drug has been suggested as the cause, however, the reason why the heart is a target remains unknown. The heart is one of the most perfused organs; therefore, it contains a large number of mitochondria per cell; these organelles are responsible for both oxygen metabolism and energy production due to high energy expenditure. Given that mitochondria play critical roles in cellular homeostasis and maintenance, this study tested the hypothesis that cardiac mitochondria are both a target and initiator of clozapine-induced cardiotoxicity through activating the drug. We investigated whether murine heart receives a relatively high amount of systemically administered drug (20 mg/kg, i.p., Wistar albino rats) and whether cardiac mice (Swiss albino) and rat (Wistar albino) mitochondria locally activate clozapine (100 \u03bcM) to a reactive metabolite. We observed a relatively large distribution of clozapine to heart tissue as well as the formation of reactive metabolites by cardiac mitochondria in situ. Mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) in cardiac tissue responsible for biotransformation of clozapine were also characterized. CYP3A4 has been found to be the major enzyme catalyzes CLZ bioactivation, while CYP1A largely and CYP3A4 partially catalyzes the formation of stable metabolites of CLZ. At 100 \u03bcM concentration, clozapine caused a significant decline in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in vitro as much as positive control (antimycin A), while it did not induce mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening.

Macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been reportedly involved in the regulation of cellular responses to MI. Thus, we sought to clarify the mechanism by which macrophage-derived EVs regulate this process. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine microRNA-150 (miR-150) expression in an MI mouse model with ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-exposed cardiomyocytes. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter gene assay were adopted to identify the correlation of miR-150 with tumor protein 53 (TP53) expression in cardiomyocytes. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted in H/R-induced cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocytes incubated with EVs from miR-150 mimic-transfected macrophages, or MI-model mice treated with EVs from miR-150 mimic-transfected macrophages. hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining assays were used for detecting inflammatory infiltration and cell apoptosis. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by dead cardiomyocytes was measured with an LDH kit, and the apoptosis-related proteins, Bax, and cleaved-caspase 3 were determined by Western blot analysis. miR-150 expression was downregulated in the infarcted cardiac tissues of MI mice. Macrophage-derived EVs could transfer miR-150 into cardiomyocytes, where it directly targeted and suppressed TP53. Furthermore, miR-150 suppressed phosphatase and tensin homology (PTEN) and activated p-Akt to upregulate IGF-1 expression. Furthermore, increased expression of EV-derived miR-150 prevented cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro, as evidenced by downregulated Bax and cleaved-caspase 3 and upregulated Bcl2 and alleviated MI in vivo.

{"title": "Acute ozone exposure can cause cardiotoxicity: Mitochondria play an important role in mediating myocardial apoptosis.", "abstract": "To clarify the cardiotoxicity induced by acute exposure to different concentrations of ozone in both gender rats and explore the underlying mechanisms.\nA total of 240 rats were randomly sorted into 6 groups with equal numbers of male and female rats in each group. The rats were subjected to ozone inhalation at concentrations of 0, 0.12, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0\u00a0ppm, respectively, for 6\u00a0h. After ozone exposure, function indicators, myocardial injury indexes and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in blood were assayed.\nHigh ozone exposure resulted in sustained ventricular tachycardia in male and female rats. Myocardial apoptosis in male rats started from 1.0\u00a0ppm ozone, and that in female rats started from 2.0\u00a0ppm ozone (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Caspase-9 increased significantly from 0.12\u00a0ppm ozone (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in both gender rats, while caspase-3 was initially activated at 0.5\u00a0ppm ozone. From 1.0\u00a0ppm ozone, mitochondrial cristae and myofilaments dissolved. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax decreased significantly from 0.12\u00a0ppm and MRCC-IV decreased significantly from 2.0\u00a0ppm by ozone.\nAcute ozone exposure can cause paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia in rats. Moreover, the changes of inflammatory factors in the heart tissues of female and male rats after ozone exposure were greater than those of oxidative stress. This study reported for the first time that 6\u00a0h ozone exposure does not cause acute cardiomyocyte necrosis, but promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mitochondrial-dependent manner.

Different chitosan hydrogels were generated using polymers of four degrees of acetylation, ranging from 2.5% to 38%, because the degree of acetylation affects their degradation and biological activity. The hydrogels were adjusted to a 3% final polymer concentration. After complete macromolecular characterization of the chitosans and study of the mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels, they were sutured onto the surface of the myocardium, first in rat after four-weeks of coronary ligation (n=58) then in mice with cardiomyopathy induced by a cardiac-specific invalidation of serum response factor (n=20). The implantation of the hydrogels was associated with a reversion of cardiac function loss with maximal effects for the acetylation degree of 24%. The extent of fibrosis, the cardiomyocyte length-to-width ratio, as well as the genes involved in fibrosis and stress were repressed after implantation. Our study demonstrated the beneficial effects of chitosan hydrogels, particularly with polymers of high degrees of acetylation, on cardiac remodeling in two cardiomyopathy models.

Besides, CF-to-Cardiac myofibroblast differentiation is commanded by TGF-b, through SMAD signaling pathways, and these last cells are strongly implicated in cardiac fibrosis. In the heart IFN-\u03b2 is produced by CF; however, the role of IFN-\u03b2, STAT proteins, and STAT-homo or heterodimers in the regulation of CF function with or without a fibrotic environment is unknown. CF were isolated from hearts of adult rats, and by western blot analysis we studied STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 phosphorylation and through specific siRNA against these proteins we analyzed their role in CF functions such as differentiation (\u03b1-SMA expression); and pro-collagen type-I synthesis and secretion expression levels; collagen gels contraction and CF migration. In cultured adult rats CF, IFN-\u03b2 increases phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3. Both STAT1 and STAT2 were involved in decreasing \u03b1-SMA and CF migration induced by TGF-\u03b21. Also, IFN-\u03b2 through STAT1 regulated pro-collagen type-I protein expression levels, and collagen gels contraction induced by TGF-\u03b21. STAT3 was not involved in any effects of IFN-\u03b2 studied.

We identified a novel cell surface marker, the G protein-coupled receptor lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4 (LPAR4), specific to cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and determined its functional significance and therapeutic potential. During in\u00a0vitro differentiation of mouse and human PSCs toward cardiac lineage, LPAR4 expression peaked after 3-7\u00a0days of differentiation in cardiac progenitors and then declined. In\u00a0vivo, LPAR4 was specifically expressed in the early stage of embryonal heart development, and as development progressed, LPAR4 expression decreased and was non-specifically distributed. We identified the effective agonist octadecenyl phosphate and a p38 MAPK blocker as the downstream signal blocker. Sequential stimulation and inhibition of LPAR4 using these agents enhanced the in\u00a0vitro efficiency of cardiac differentiation from mouse and human PSCs. Importantly, in\u00a0vivo, this sequential stimulation and inhibition of LPAR4 reduced the infarct size and rescued heart dysfunction in mice. In conclusion, LPAR4 is a novel CPC marker transiently expressed only in heart during embryo development.

{"title": "Cellular channelopathy mediated by hypergravity: IL-6-mediated Nkcc1 activation and enhanced Trpm2 expression in rat atrium.", "abstract": "Although cardiac tissue is considered a target of gravitational force (g-force), the mechanism of hypergravity on the ion modulation or identification of ion transporters is still unknown. Thus, we determine the effect of hypergravity on a physical force-sensitive cytokine, IL-6 and its related channel activity to investigate rat cardiac function changes in response to accelerated g-force. Serum IL-6 levels and intracellular calcium levels of the right atrium were moderately increased under hypergravity stimulation (4g). IL-6 was involved in the modulation of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (Nkcc) activity. Surprisingly, the right atrium under 4g revealed significantly enhanced Nkcc1 activity. The use of IL-6 on the NKCC1-overexpressed or native NKCC-expressing cells also showed enhanced NKCC1 activity. Hypergravity conditions were also involved in the oxidative stress activated Trpm2 channel and revealed an enhanced expression of the Trpm2 channel under 4g in the rat right atrium. In conclusion, hypergravity revealed that moderate increases in serum IL-6 and enhanced Nkcc1 activity was modulated by IL-6. In addition, enhanced Trpm2 channel expression could be involved in the increased intracellular calcium levels of the right atrium under hypergravitational force. We therefore address that enhanced physical force-sensitive cytokine and oxidative stress by the gravitational force mediate activation of the cotransporter involved in possibilities of edema and calcium loading in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2020-11-08", "authors": ["MinjeongJi", "Hyun JiKim", "Chi BumAhn", "Kuk HuiSon", "Jeong HeeHong"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-020-03299-2\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.03.067\n10.1038/s41598-017-05935-4\n10.1113/jphysiol.1997.sp021932\n10.1016/j.ceca.2005.11.006\n10.1113/JP271378\n10.1007/s00424-013-1390-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0197594\n10.2174/1573403X14666180702152436\n10.1152/physrev.00011.2011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0068140\n10.1007/s10517-018-4301-9\n10.2203/dose-response.05-008.Minois\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.060\n10.1538/expanim.56.309\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3382-11.2011\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.281.2.H515\n10.1007/s00424-013-1316-y\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.282319\n10.1042/cs0880103\n10.1038/s41598-019-42829-z\n10.1016/j.autneu.2014.07.010\n10.18632/oncotarget.9372"}

To utilize human iPSC-derived CMs, the establishment of three-dimensional (3D) heart tissues from iPSC-derived CMs and other heart cells, and a sensitive bioassay system to depict physiological heart function are anticipated. We have developed a heart-on-a-chip microdevice (HMD) as a novel system consisting of dynamic culture-based 3D cardiac microtissues derived from human iPSCs and microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based microfluidic chips. The HMDs could visualize the kinetics of cardiac microtissue pulsations by monitoring particle displacement, which enabled us to quantify the physiological parameters, including fluidic output, pressure, and force. The HMDs demonstrated a strong correlation between particle displacement and the frequency of external electrical stimulation. The transition patterns were validated by a previously reported versatile video-based system to evaluate contractile function. The patterns are also consistent with oscillations of intracellular calcium ion concentration of CMs, which is a fundamental biological component of CM contraction. The HMDs showed a pharmacological response to isoproterenol, a \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist, that resulted in a strong correlation between beating rate and particle displacement.

However, there is paucity of information on the potential functional alterations that magnetic fields from mobile phone could cause to the heart. This study investigated heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure (BP) and lipid profile in Wistar rats exposed to electromagnetic field radiation from a dual transceiver mobile phone (DTrMP).\nTwenty-one male albino Wistar rats (140-180\u00a0g) were randomly assigned to two major groups positioned 5\u00a0m apart as follows: control: no phone (n=7) and treatment group (n=14) continuously exposed to electromagnetic field from Tecno T312 DTrMP 900/1800\u00a0MHz set in silence mode. Experimental treatment consisted in 10\u00a0min calls/day, directed to this device for a period of six weeks. Seven animals from the treatment group were allowed to recover for a period of two weeks after exposure. HRV, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial BP were noninvasively investigated, while serum lipid profile and heart tissue nitric oxide (NO) activities were determined using standard procedures.\nThere was significant (p<0.05) increase in systolic, diastolic, mean arterial BP and a decrease in HRV. Serum high density lipoproteins decreased, while total cholesterol, atherogenic indices, and heart NO levels increased significantly in the radiation exposed animals. The alterations observed in exposed animals remained unchanged even after the recovery period.\nThese results suggest that exposure to electromagnetic radiation from dual transceiver mobile phones could be a risk factor to increase in blood pressure.", "journal": "Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology", "date": "2020-11-05", "authors": ["JamilDauda Usman", "MikailUmar Isyaku", "Adesoji AdedipeFasanmade"], "doi": "10.1515/jbcpp-2020-0047"}
{"title": "Taurine mitigates cirrhosis-associated heart injury through mitochondrial-dependent and antioxidative mechanisms.", "abstract": "Cirrhosis-induced heart injury and cardiomyopathy is a serious consequence of this disease. It has been shown that bile duct ligated (BDL) animals could serve as an appropriate experimental model to investigate heart tissue injury in cirrhosis. The accumulation of cytotoxic chemicals (e.g., bile acids) could also adversely affect the heart tissue. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment are the most prominent mechanisms of bile acid cytotoxicity. Taurine (Tau) is the most abundant non-protein amino acid in the human body. The cardioprotective effects of this amino acid have repeatedly been investigated. In the current study, it was examined whether mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis-induced heart injury. Rats underwent BDL surgery. BDL animals received Tau (50, 100, and 500 mg/kg, i.p.) for 42 consecutive days. A significant increase in oxidative stress biomarkers was detected in the heart tissue of BDL animals. Moreover, it was found that heart tissue mitochondrial indices of functionality were deteriorated in the BDL group. Tau treatment significantly decreased oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial function in the heart tissue of cirrhotic animals. These data provide clues for the involvement of mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of heart injury in BDL rats. On the other hand, Tau supplementation could serve as an effective ancillary treatment against BDL-associated heart injury. Mitochondrial regulating and antioxidative properties of Tau might play a fundamental role in its mechanism of protective effects in the heart tissue of BDL animals.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental hepatology", "date": "2020-11-05", "authors": ["KhadijehMousavi", "HosseinNiknahad", "AminGhalamfarsa", "HamidrezaMohammadi", "NegarAzarpira", "Mohammad MehdiOmmati", "RezaHeidari"], "doi": "10.5114/ceh.2020.99513\n10.2478/s11756-020-00429-7"}

{"title": "Glycosylation of Serum Clusterin in Wild-Type Transthyretin-Associated (ATTRwt) Amyloidosis: A Study of Disease-Associated Compositional Features Using Mass Spectrometry Analyses.", "abstract": "Wild-type transthyretin-associated (ATTRwt) amyloidosis is an age-related disease that causes heart failure in older adults. This disease frequently features cardiac amyloid fibril deposits that originate from dissociation of the tetrameric protein, transthyretin (TTR). Unlike hereditary TTR (ATTRm) amyloidosis, where amino acid replacements destabilize the native protein, in ATTRwt amyloidosis, amyloid-forming TTR lacks protein sequence alterations. The initiating cause of fibril formation in ATTRwt amyloidosis is unclear, and thus, it seems plausible that other factors are involved in TTR misfolding and unregulated accumulation of wild-type TTR fibrils. We believe that clusterin (CLU, UniProtKB P10909), a plasma circulating glycoprotein, plays a role in the pathobiology of ATTRwt amyloidosis. Previously, we have suggested a role for CLU in ATTRwt amyloidosis based on our studies showing that (1) CLU codeposits with non-native TTR in amyloid fibrils from ATTRwt cardiac tissue, (2) CLU interacts only with non-native (monomeric and aggregated) forms of TTR, and (3) CLU serum levels in patients with ATTRwt are significantly lower compared to healthy controls. In the present study, we provide comprehensive detail of compositional findings from mass spectrometry analyses of amino acid and glycan content of CLU purified from ATTRwt and control sera. The characterization of oligosaccharide content in serum CLU derived from patients with ATTRwt amyloidosis is novel data. Moreover, results comparing CLU oligosaccharide variations between patient and healthy controls are original and provide further evidence for the role of CLU in ATTRwt pathobiology, possibly linked to disease-specific structural features that limit the chaperoning capacity of CLU.", "journal": "Biochemistry", "date": "2020-11-04", "authors": ["Celia MTorres-Arancivia", "DeborahChang", "William EHackett", "JosephZaia", "Lawreen HConnors"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00590"}

Factors that disrupt corin folding, intracellular trafficking, cell surface expression, and zymogen activation are expected to impair corin function. To date, CORIN variants that reduce corin activity have been identified in hypertensive patients. In addition to the heart, corin expression has been detected in non-cardiac tissues, where corin and ANP participate in diverse physiological processes. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in corin biosynthesis and post-translational modifications. We also discuss tissue-specific corin expression and function in physiology and disease.", "journal": "Biochemical Society transactions", "date": "2020-10-31", "authors": ["NingzhengDong", "YayanNiu", "YueChen", "ShijinSun", "QingyuWu"], "doi": "10.1042/BST20190760"}

However, confocal endomicroscopic images are formed by point-by-point scanning in both lateral and axial directions, which results in long image acquisition time. Here, an endomicroscope with telecentric configuration is presented to achieve nonmechanical and rapid axial scanning for volumetric fluorescence imaging. In our system, optical sectioning in wide-field fashion is obtained through HiLo imaging with a digital micromirror device. Axial scanning, without mechanical moving parts, is conducted by digital focus adjustment using an electrically tunable lens, offering constant magnification and contrast. We demonstrate imaging performance of our system with optically sectioned images using fluorescently labeled beads, as well as ex vivo mice cardiac tissue samples. Our system provides multiple advantages, in terms of improved scanning range, and reduced image acquisition time, which shows great potentials for three-dimensional biopsies of volumetric biological samples.", "journal": "Journal of biophotonics", "date": "2020-10-31", "authors": ["HawHsiao", "Chen-YenLin", "SunilVyas", "Kuang-YuhHuang", "J AndrewYeh", "YuanLuo"], "doi": "10.1002/jbio.202000335"}

{"title": "IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) as a novel radiation countermeasure after radiation exposure in mice.", "abstract": "Recent studies suggested that radiation exposure causes local and systemic inflammatory responses and induces cell and tissue damage. We have reported that IL-18 plays an important role in radiation-induced injury. Here, we demonstrate that IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a natural antagonist of IL-18, was significantly increased (1.7-63 fold) in mouse serum on day 1 after 0.5-10\u00a0Gy TBI. However, this high level of IL-18BP was not sufficient to neutralize the active IL-18 in irradiated mice, resulting in a radiation dose-dependent free IL-18 increase in these mice's serum which led to pathological alterations to the irradiated cells and tissues and finally caused animal death. Administration of recombinant human (rh) IL-18BP (1.5\u00a0mg/kg) with single (24, 48 or 72\u00a0h post-TBI) or double doses (48\u00a0h and 5\u00a0days post-TBI) subcutaneous (SC) injection increased 30-day survival of CD2F1 mice after 9\u00a0Gy TBI 12.5-25% compared with the vehicle control treated group, respectively. Furthermore, the mitigative effects of rhIL-18BP included balancing the ratio of IL-18/IL-18BP and decreasing the free IL-18 levels in irradiated mouse serum and significantly increasing blood cell counts, BM hematopoietic cellularity and stem and progenitor cell clonogenicity in mouse BM. Furthermore, IL-18BP treatment inhibited the IL-18 downstream target interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 expression in mouse BM, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the irradiated mouse heart tissues, attenuated the stress responsive factor GDF-15 (growth differentiation factor-15) and increased the intestine protector citrulline level in total body irradiated mouse serum, implicating that IL-18BP may protect multiple organs from radiation-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. Our data suggest that IL-18 plays a key role in radiation-induced cell and tissue damage and dysfunction; and for the first time demonstrated that IL-18BP counters IL-18 activation and therefore may mitigate/treat radiation-induced multiple organ injuries and increase animal survival with a wider therapeutic window from 24\u00a0h and beyond after lethal doses of radiation exposure.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-10-31", "authors": ["XianghongLi", "WanchangCui", "LisaHull", "LiWang", "TianzhengYu", "MangXiao"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-75675-5\n10.3389/fimmu.2015.00422\n10.3389/fimmu.2012.00288\n10.1667/RR15087.1\n10.1155/2019/3010342\n10.3389/fimmu.2012.00315\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109249\n10.1667/RR14768.1\n10.1093/rheumatology/ken257\n10.1097/HP.0000000000000494\n10.1016/S0014-5793(99)00148-9\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80013-8\n10.1073/pnas.97.3.1190\n10.1006/cyto.2001.0914\n10.1084/jem.20190669\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000020546.30940.92\n10.1074/jbc.M804236200\n10.2119/molmed.2014.00034\n10.1186/s12950-015-0089-9\n10.1016/j.jss.2015.12.026\n10.3389/fimmu.2012.00239\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.072\n10.1016/j.smim.2013.10.014\n10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-212608\n10.1007/s00411-006-0076-x\n10.4049/jimmunol.1303051\n10.4103/0971-4065.98756\n10.1667/RR13398.1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0122258\n10.4049/jimmunol.170.4.2100\n10.1002/ana.20322\n10.1002/eji.200425124\n10.1177/1091581814554929\n10.21769/BioProtoc.3465\n10.1002/jcp.27370\n10.1016/j.jaut.2009.08.002\n10.1093/rheumatology/kew300\n10.1667/RR14238.1\n10.1111/joim.12718\n10.1002/jor.24472\n10.1667/RR14305.1\n10.1667/RR15137.1\n10.1007/s00520-017-3854-x\n10.1667/RR14555.1\n10.1097/HP.0b013e3182a4dd2c\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2014.07.007\n10.1038/jid.2014.201\n10.3390/ijms20030649\n10.1038/s41598-017-09767-0\n10.1128/AAC.02781-14\n10.1139/cjpp-2017-0121\n10.1016/j.exer.2007.06.013\n10.1089/ars.2012.5149\n10.1186/1741-7015-8-34\n10.1155/2015/490842\n10.1016/j.clnu.2008.02.005"}
{"title": "Myocardial Gene Expression Signatures in Human Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) constitutes half of all HF but lacks effective therapy. Understanding of its myocardial biology remains limited because of a paucity of heart tissue molecular analysis.\nWe performed RNA sequencing on right ventricular septal endomyocardial biopsies prospectively obtained from patients meeting consensus criteria for HFpEF (n=41) contrasted with right ventricular septal tissue from patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, n=30) and donor controls (n=24). Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering tested for transcriptomic distinctiveness between groups, effect of comorbidities, and differential gene expression with pathway enrichment contrasted HF groups and donor controls. Within HFpEF, non-negative matrix factorization and weighted gene coexpression analysis identified molecular subgroups, and the resulting clusters were correlated with hemodynamic and clinical data.\nPatients with HFpEF were more often women (59%), African American (68%), obese (median body mass index 41), and hypertensive (98%), with clinical HF characterized by 65% New York Heart Association Class III or IV, nearly all on a loop diuretic, and 70% with a HF hospitalization in the previous year. Principal component analysis separated HFpEF from HFrEF and donor controls with minimal overlap, and this persisted after adjusting for primary comorbidities: body mass index, sex, age, diabetes, and renal function. Hierarchical clustering confirmed group separation. Nearly half the significantly altered genes in HFpEF versus donor controls (1882 up, 2593 down) changed in the same direction in HFrEF; however, 5745 genes were uniquely altered between HF groups. Compared with controls, uniquely upregulated genes in HFpEF were enriched in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis/electron transport, pathways downregulated in HFrEF. HFpEF-specific downregulated genes engaged endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and angiogenesis. Body mass index differences largely accounted for HFpEF upregulated genes, whereas neither this nor broader comorbidity adjustment altered pathways enriched in downregulated genes. Non-negative matrix factorization identified 3 HFpEF transcriptomic subgroups with distinctive pathways and clinical correlates, including a group closest to HFrEF with higher mortality, and a mostly female group with smaller hearts and proinflammatory signaling. These groupings remained after sex adjustment.

{"title": "The Future of Direct Cardiac Reprogramming: Any ", "abstract": "Direct cardiac reprogramming has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to treat and regenerate injured hearts through the direct conversion of fibroblasts into cardiac cells. Most studies have focused on the reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). The first study in which this technology was described, showed that at least a combination of three transcription factors, GATA4, MEF2C and TBX5 (GMT cocktail), was required for the reprogramming into iCMs in vitro using mouse cells. However, this was later demonstrated to be insufficient for the reprogramming of human cells and additional factors were required. Thereafter, most studies have focused on implementing reprogramming efficiency and obtaining fully reprogrammed and functional iCMs, by the incorporation of other transcription factors, microRNAs or small molecules to the original GMT cocktail. In this respect, great advances have been made in recent years. However, there is still no consensus on which of these GMT-based varieties is best, and robust and highly reproducible protocols are still urgently required, especially in the case of human cells. On the other hand, apart from CMs, other cells such as endothelial and smooth muscle cells to form new blood vessels will be fundamental for the correct reconstruction of damaged cardiac tissue. With this aim, several studies have centered on the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs) able to give rise to all myocardial cell lineages. Especially interesting are reports in which multipotent and highly expandable mouse iCPCs have been obtained, suggesting that clinically relevant amounts of these cells could be created. However, as of yet, this has not been achieved with human iCPCs, and exactly what stage of maturity is appropriate for a cell therapy product remains an open question. Nonetheless, the major concern in regenerative medicine is the poor retention, survival, and engraftment of transplanted cells in the cardiac tissue. To circumvent this issue, several cell pre-conditioning approaches are currently being explored. As an alternative to cell injection, in vivo reprogramming may face fewer barriers for its translation to the clinic. This approach has achieved better results in terms of efficiency and iCMs maturity in mouse models, indicating that the heart environment can favor this process. In this context, in recent years some studies have focused on the development of safer delivery systems such as Sendai virus, Adenovirus, chemical cocktails or nanoparticles.

Small-molecule BET protein inhibitors such as JQ1 have demonstrated efficacy in reversing cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in preclinical models. Yet, genetic studies elucidating the biology of BET proteins in the heart have not been conducted to validate pharmacological findings and to unveil potential pharmacological side effects.\nBy engineering a cardiomyocyte-specific BRD4 knockout mouse, we investigated the role of BRD4 in cardiac pathophysiology. We performed functional, transcriptomic, and mitochondrial analyses to evaluate BRD4 function in developing and mature hearts.\nUnlike pharmacological inhibition, loss of BRD4 protein triggered progressive declines in myocardial function, culminating in dilated cardiomyopathy. Transcriptome analysis of BRD4 knockout mouse heart tissue identified early and specific disruption of genes essential to mitochondrial energy production and homeostasis. Functional analysis of isolated mitochondria from these hearts confirmed that BRD4 ablation triggered significant changes in mitochondrial electron transport chain protein expression and activity. Computational analysis identified candidate transcription factors participating in the BRD4-regulated transcriptome. In particular, estrogen-related receptor \u03b1, a key nuclear receptor in metabolic gene regulation, was enriched in promoters of BRD4-regulated mitochondrial genes.\nIn aggregate, we describe a previously unrecognized role for BRD4 in regulating cardiomyocyte mitochondrial homeostasis, observing that its function is indispensable to the maintenance of normal cardiac function.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2020-10-29", "authors": ["Soo YoungKim", "XinZhang", "Gabriele GSchiattarella", "FranciscoAltamirano", "Thais A RRamos", "Kristin MFrench", "NanJiang", "Pamela ASzweda", "Bret MEvers", "Herman IMay", "XiangLuo", "HongliangLi", "Luke ISzweda", "ViniciusMaracaja-Coutinho", "SergioLavandero", "Thomas GGillette", "Joseph AHill"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047239"}

Peptidomics is an emerging field of proteomics that has attracted much attention because it can be used to study the composition and content of endogenous peptides in various organisms. Endogenous peptides participate in various biological processes and are important sources of candidates for drug development. To explore peptide changes related to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and to find peptides with cardioprotective function, we compared the expression profiles of peptides in the hearts of DOX-treated and control mice by mass spectrometry. The results showed that 236 differential peptides were identified upon DOX treatment, of which 22 were upregulated and 214 were downregulated. Next, we predicted that 31 peptides may have cardioprotective function by conducting bioinformatics analysis on the domains of each precursor protein, the predicted score of peptide biological activity, and the correlation of each peptide with cardiac events. Finally, we verified that a peptide (SPFYLRPPSF) from Cryab can inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis, reduce the production of reactive oxygen species, improve cardiac function, and ameliorate myocardial fibrosis in vitro and vivo.

Understanding the impact of ECM remodeling on cardiac cells during heart failure (HF) is essential to prevent adverse ventricular remodeling and restore organ functionality in affected patients.\nWe aimed to (1) identify consistent modifications to cardiac ECM structure and mechanics that contribute to HF and (2) determine the underlying molecular mechanisms.\nWe first performed decellularization of human and murine ECM (decellularized ECM) and then analyzed the pathological changes occurring in decellularized ECM during HF by atomic force microscopy, 2-photon microscopy, high-resolution 3-dimensional image analysis, and computational fluid dynamics simulation. We then performed molecular and functional assays in patient-derived cardiac fibroblasts based on YAP (yes-associated protein)-transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) mechanosensing activity and collagen contraction assays. The analysis of HF decellularized ECM resulting from ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as from mouse infarcted tissue, identified a common pattern of modifications in their 3-dimensional topography. As compared with healthy heart, HF ECM exhibited aligned, flat, and compact fiber bundles, with reduced elasticity and organizational complexity. At the molecular level, RNA sequencing of HF cardiac fibroblasts highlighted the overrepresentation of dysregulated genes involved in ECM organization, or being connected to TGF\u03b21 (transforming growth factor \u03b21), interleukin-1, TNF-\u03b1, and BDNF signaling pathways. Functional tests performed on HF cardiac fibroblasts pointed at mechanosensor YAP as a key player in ECM remodeling in the diseased heart via transcriptional activation of focal adhesion assembly.

Carbon nanotubes present a unique opportunity in the world of tissue engineering through reparation and regeneration of the myocardium, an otherwise irreparable tissue.\nThe high burden of cardiovascular disease has prompted research into cardiac tissue engineering applications. Carbon-nanotube incorporation into extracellular matrix-mimicking-scaffolds has shown to improve cardiomyocyte conductivity, viability, mechanical strength, beating behavior, and have protected them from damage to a certain degree. These are promising findings that have the potential of becoming the focus of future cardiac tissue engineering research.", "journal": "Expert review of clinical pharmacology", "date": "2020-10-27", "authors": ["ParidhiGhai", "ThomasMayerhofer", "Rajesh KumarJha"], "doi": "10.1080/17512433.2020.1841634"}

GDF11 (Growth Differentiation Factor 11) has been reported to generate cytoprotective effects in phylogenesis and multiple diseases, but the mechanism that GDF11 contributes to cardioprotection of MI and cardiomyocytes pyroptosis remains poorly understood. In our study, we first determined that GDF11 was abnormally downregulated in the heart tissue of MI mice and hypoxic cardiomyocytes. Moreover, AAV9-GDF11 markedly alleviated heart function in MI mice. Meanwhile, GDF11 overexpression also decreased the pyroptosis of hypoxic cardiomyocytes. PROMO and JASPAR prediction software found that transcription factor HOXA3 was predicted as an important regulator of NLRP3, and was confirmed by ChIP assay. Further analysis identifying GDF11 promoted the Smad2/3 pathway resulted in HOXA3 overexpression.

PKD has recently emerged as a nutrient-sensing kinase that is activated in high-lipid environments, such as in obesity. However, the role of PKD signaling in cardiac glucose metabolism and cardiac function in both normal and obese conditions remains unknown.\nA cardiac-specific and inducible dominant negative (DN) PKD mouse model was developed. Echocardiography was used to assess cardiac function, while metabolic phenotyping was performed, including stable isotope metabolomics on cardiac tissue in mice fed either regular chow or a high-fat diet (43% calories from fat).\nCardiac PKD activity declined by \u223c90% following DN PKD induction in adult mice. The mice had diminished basal cardiac glucose clearance, suggesting impaired contraction-mediated glucose uptake, but normal cardiac function. In obesity studies, systolic function indices were reduced in control mice, but not in cardiac DN PKD mice. Using targeted stable isotope metabolomic analyses, no differences in glucose flux through glycolysis or the TCA cycle were observed between groups.\nThe data show that PKD contributes to cardiac dysfunction in obesity and highlight the redundancy in cardiac glucose metabolism that maintains cardiac glucose flux in\u00a0vivo.

The objective of the study was to establish the effects of grain amaranth feed supplementation on calcium, s100al protein and antioxidant levels on the brain-heart axis in diabetic male Wistar rats. Methods The study involved six groups (n=5) with DM being induced in 20 rats. To the diabetic rats, Group I received mixtard\u00ae, Group II was positive control, Groups III and IV received GA feed supplementation at 25 and 50%. In the nondiabetic rats (n=10), Group V received 50% grain amaranth while Group VI was the negative control. The brain and heart tissues were harvested after five weeks and processed using standard methods. Results Grain amaranth feed supplementation led to improved calcium levels in DM as compared to the positive control. This also led to increased s100a1, antioxidant levels in the brain-heart axis during DM. This then protected the tissues against oxidative damage, thus preserving tissue function and structure.

They resemble embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and have the ability to differentiate into cell lineage of all three germ-layer, including cardiomyocytes (CMs). The CMs can be generated from iPSCs by inducing embryoid bodies (EBs) formation and treatment with activin A, bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), and inhibitors of Wnt signaling. However, these iPSC-derived CMs are a heterogeneous population of cells and require purification and maturation to mimic the in vivo CMs. The matured CMs can be used for various therapeutic purposes in regenerative medicine by cardiomyoplasty or through the development of tissue-engineered cardiac patches. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the isolation of iPSC and their differentiation, purification, and maturation into clinically usable CMs. Newer small molecules have also been identified to substitute the reprogramming factors for iPSC generation as well as for direct differentiation of somatic cells into CMs without an intermediary pluripotent state. This review provides a concise update on the generation of iPSC-derived CMs and their application in personalized cardiac regenerative medicine.

Current approaches to monitoring of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (CIC) as well as model systems that develop in vivo or in vitro CIC platforms fail to notice early signs of CIC.

Here, a model is presented for investigating CIC where not only induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiac tissues are interacted with BC tissues on a dual-organ platform, but electrochemical immuno-aptasensors can also monitor cell-secreted multiple biomarkers. Fibrotic stages of iPSC-derived cardiac tissues are promoted with a supplement of transforming growth factor-\u03b2\u20091 to assess the differential functionality in healthy and fibrotic cardiac tissues after treatment with doxorubicin (DOX). The production trend of biomarkers evaluated by using the immuno-aptasensors well-matches the outcomes from conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, demonstrating the accuracy of the authors' sensing platform with much higher sensitivity and lower detection limits for early monitoring of CIC and BC progression.

In addition, the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, Pro-caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were increased in heart tissues of DCM mice and high glucose-treated HL-1 cells, which was repressed by GAS5 up-regulation.

Moreover, GAS5 regulated AHR expression by sponging miR-34b-3p. Furthermore, GAS5 overexpression suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation-mediated pyroptosis by regulating miR-34b-3p/AHR axis. In summary, our study demonstrates that GAS5 acts as a competing endogenous RNA to enhance AHR expression by sponging miR-34b-3p, which consequently represses NLRP3 inflammasome activation-mediated pyroptosis to improve DCM.

{"title": "Autofluorescence properties of balloon polymers used in medical applications.", "abstract": "For use in medical balloons and related clinical applications, polymers are usually designed for transparency under illumination with white-light sources. However, when illuminated with ultraviolet (UV) or blue light, most of these materials autofluoresce in the visible range, which can be a concern for modalities that rely on tissue autofluorescence for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.\nA search for published information on spectral properties of polymers that can be used for medical balloon manufacturing revealed a scarcity of published information on this subject. The aim of these studies was to address this gap.\nThe autofluorescence properties of polymers used in medical balloon manufacturing were examined for their suitability for hyperspectral imaging and related applications. Excitation-emission matrices of different balloon materials were acquired within the 320- to 620-nm spectral range. In parallel, autofluorescence profiles from the 420- to 620-nm range were extracted from hyperspectral datasets of the same samples illuminated with UV light. The list of tested polymers included polyurethanes, nylon, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyether block amide (PEBAX), vulcanized silicone, thermoplastic elastomers with and without talc, and cyclic olefin copolymers, known by their trade name TOPAS.\nEach type of polymer exhibited a specific pattern of autofluorescence. Polyurethanes, PET, and thermoplastic elastomers containing talc had the highest autofluorescence values, while sheets made of nylon, PEBAX, and TOPAS exhibited negligible autofluorescence. Hyperspectral imaging was used to illustrate how the choice of specific balloon material can impact the ability of principal component analysis to reveal the ablated cardiac tissue.\nThe data revealed significant differences between autofluorescence profiles of the polymers and pointed to the most promising balloon materials for clinical implementation of approaches that depend on tissue autofluorescence.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "date": "2020-10-22", "authors": ["HudaAsfour", "JeremyOtridge", "RobertThomasian", "CinnamonLarson", "NarineSarvazyan"], "doi": "10.1117/1.JBO.25.10.106004\n10.1097/DAD.0b013e31829bad10\n10.1016/j.cgh.2006.11.013\n10.3892/ijo.24.1.59\n10.1111/dme.12005\n10.1002/jbio.200910059\n10.1117/1.JBO.18.2.026010\n10.4081/ejh.2014.2461\n10.1117/1.1413209\n10.1152/ajpheart.01158.2007\n10.3791/4115\n10.1088/0031-9155/58/15/5009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1093/geronj/45.2.M33\n10.1098/rsif.2012.1004\n10.1080/01913123.2018.1544953\n10.1161/CIRCEP.114.001750\n10.1152/ajpheart.01141.2011\n10.1002/jbio.201600071\n10.1371/journal.pone.0167760\n10.1007/s13239-020-00476-w\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.12.014\n10.1002/app.26085\n10.1117/1.1369411\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.040\n10.1177/088532829901400104\n10.1007/BF02584557\n10.1039/C6RA14525F\n10.15420/aer.2015.4.1.58\n10.1111/jce.13698\n10.1038/nrcardio.2013.165\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31927-X\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2016.07.505\n10.1177/0194599813510867\n10.1002/jbm.820070405\n10.1002/cnm.3173\n10.1002/jbm.b.33414\n10.1097/00006123-200004000-00027\n10.1351/pac200577050801\n10.1007/s10404-010-0605-4\n10.1562/0031-8655(2003)0780384MFEMRT2.0.CO2\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2016.03.009\n10.1038/s41598-018-26696-8\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.11.020\n10.1146/annurev.physchem.47.1.555\n10.1117/1.JBO.21.10.104003\n10.1177/1553350615569076\n10.1007/s12156-009-0032-5\n10.1186/s13287-016-0396-y\n10.3389/fonc.2017.00314\n10.1364/OE.18.017364\n10.3390/s130303242"}

{"title": "Multiscale cardiac imaging spanning the whole heart and its internal cellular architecture in a small animal model.", "abstract": "Cardiac pumping depends on the morphological structure of the heart, but also on its subcellular (ultrastructural) architecture, which enables cardiac contraction. In cases of congenital heart defects, localized ultrastructural disruptions that increase the risk of heart failure are only starting to be discovered. This is in part due to a lack of technologies that can image the three-dimensional (3D) heart structure, to assess malformations; and its ultrastructure, to assess organelle disruptions. We present here a multiscale, correlative imaging procedure that achieves high-resolution images of the whole heart, using 3D micro-computed tomography (micro-CT); and its ultrastructure, using 3D scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In a small animal model (chicken embryo), we achieved uniform fixation and staining of the whole heart, without losing ultrastructural preservation on the same sample, enabling correlative multiscale imaging. Our approach enables multiscale studies in models of congenital heart disease and beyond.\nThe heart is our hardest-working organ and beats around 100,000 times a day, pumping blood through a vast system of vessels to all areas of the body. Specialized heart cells make the heart contract rhythmically, enabling it to work efficiently. Contractile molecules inside these cells, called myofibrils, align within the heart cells, and heart cells align to each other, so that the heart tissue contracts effectively. However, when the heart has defects or is diseased this organization can be lost, and the heart may no longer pump blood efficiently, leading to sometimes life-threatening complications. For example, around one in a hundred newborn babies suffer from congenital heart defects, and despite medical advances, these conditions remain the main cause of non-infectious mortality in children. Many cases of congenital heart disease are diagnosed before a baby is born during an ultrasound scan. However, these scans, as well as subsequent diagnostic tools, lack the precision to detect problems within the heart cells. Now, Rykiel et al. used two complementary imaging techniques known as micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy to acquire pictures of the whole heart as well as of the organization inside the heart cells. This made it possible to capture the structure of the heart tissue at both micrometer (the whole heart) and nanometer resolution (the inside of the cells), and to study what happens within the heart and its cells when the heart has a defect. Rykiel et al. tested the imaging technology on the hearts of chicken embryos, at stages equivalent to a five to six-month-old human fetus, and compared a healthy heart with a heart with a defect called tetralogy of Fallot. They found that the tissues in the heart with a defect had a sponge-like appearance, with increased space in between cells. Moreover, the myofibrils of the heart with a defect were aligned differently compared to those in the normal heart.

However, the imaging technology used in this study offers the possibility of examining the heart at an unprecedented level of detail.

{"title": "Adjustments of cardiac mitochondrial phenotype in a warmer thermal habitat is associated with oxidative stress in European perch, Perca fluviatilis.", "abstract": "Mitochondria are playing key roles in setting the thermal limits of fish, but how these organelles participate in selection mechanisms during extreme thermal events associated with climate warming in natural populations is unclear. Here, we investigated the thermal effects on mitochondrial metabolism, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial gene expression in cardiac tissues of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) collected from an artificially heated ecosystem, the \"Biotest enclosure\", and an adjacent reference area in the Baltic sea with normal temperatures (~\u200923\u00a0\u00b0C and\u2009~\u200916\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, at the time of capture in summer). Fish were sampled one month after a heat wave that caused the Biotest temperatures to peak at\u2009~\u200931.5\u00a0\u00b0C, causing significant mortality. When assayed at 23\u00a0\u00b0C, Biotest perch maintained high mitochondrial capacities, while reference perch displayed depressed mitochondrial functions relative to measurements at 16\u00a0\u00b0C. Moreover, mitochondrial gene expression of nd4 (mitochondrial subunit of complex I) was higher in Biotest fish, likely explaining the increased respiration rates observed in this population. Nonetheless, cardiac tissue from Biotest perch displayed higher levels of oxidative damage, which may have resulted from their chronically warm habitat, as well as the extreme temperatures encountered during the preceding summer heat wave. We conclude that eurythermal fish such as perch are able to adjust and maintain mitochondrial capacities of highly aerobic organs such as the heart when exposed to a warming environment as predicted with climate change. However, this might come at the expense of exacerbated oxidative stress, potentially threatening performance in nature.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-10-21", "authors": ["NicolasPichaud", "AndreasEkstr\u00f6m", "SophieBreton", "FredrikSundstr\u00f6m", "PiotrRowinski", "Pierre UBlier", "ErikSandblom"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-74788-1\n10.1038/nclimate3296\n10.3389/fmars.2018.00349\n10.1152/physiol.00040.2018\n10.1073/pnas.1101766108\n10.1098/rspb.2013.2612\n10.3354/cr00879\n10.1242/jeb.151217\n10.1242/jeb.118851\n10.1139/cjz-2013-0183\n10.1038/ncomms11447\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.10.020\n10.1038/nature09407\n10.1890/12-2060.1\n10.1073/pnas.1015178108\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064120\n10.1242/jeb.098798\n10.1186/s12983-017-0205-1\n10.1146/annurev.ph.57.030195.000315\n10.1242/jeb.02628\n10.1038/420027a\n10.1242/jeb.120444\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.12.037\n10.1007/s00360-007-0173-4\n10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.12.008\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2013.06.008\n10.1016/j.marenvres.2014.01.007\n10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.04.009\n10.1016/j.cbpb.2004.05.013\n10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.05.050\n10.1038/nclimate2457\n10.1086/499990\n10.1146/annurev.ph.57.030195.000355\n10.1016/j.cbpc.2004.05.003\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1006517\n10.1016/S0168-9525(01)02338-1\n10.1152/ajpregu.00542.2010\n10.1242/jeb.040261\n10.1007/s10863-012-9473-9\n10.1111/mec.13945\n10.1152/ajpregu.00008.2016\n10.1038/s41598-019-54165-3\n10.1242/jeb.150698\n10.1016/j.biocel.2009.03.013\n10.1007/s00360-016-1010-4\n10.1242/jeb.01057\n10.1242/jeb.134312\n10.1021/ed800088n\n10.1111/j.0269-8463.2004.00841.x\n10.1093/icb/icr097\n10.1242/jeb.01977\n10.1016/j.jtherbio.2007.01.004\n10.1016/j.cbpb.2015.10.001\n10.1016/j.cbpc.2005.11.017\n10.1098/rspb.2015.1028\n10.1152/ajpregu.00530.2015\n10.1093/gbe/evv078\n10.1242/jeb.133025\n10.3389/fnins.2016.00603\n10.1016/S0009-2797(03)00002-4\n10.1038/srep45778\n10.1242/jeb.152421\n10.1093/icb/icy085\n10.1016/0003-2697(85)90442-7\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1093/molbev/mst197"}
{"title": "Analysis of DCM associated protein alterations of human right and left ventricles.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement and impaired myocardial function. Endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) enable immunohistochemical and molecular characterization of this disease. However, knowledge about specific molecular patterns and their relation to cardiac function in both ventricles is rare. Therefore, we performed a mass spectrometric analysis of 28 paired EMBs of left (LV) and right ventricles (RV) of patients with DCM or suspected myocarditis allowing quantitative profiling of 743 proteins. We analysed associations between protein abundance of LV and RV as well as the echocardiographic parameters LVEF, TAPSE, LVEDDI, and RVEDDI by linear regression models. Overall, more LV than RV proteins were associated with LV parameters or with RVEDDI. Most LV and RV proteins increasing in level with impairing of LVEF were annotated to structural components of cardiac tissue. Additionally, a high proportion of LV proteins with metabolic functions decreased in level with decreasing LVEF. Results were validated with LV heart sections of a genetic murine heart failure model. The study shows, that remodelling and systolic dysfunction in DCM is mirrored by distinct alterations in protein composition of both ventricles. Loss of LV systolic function is reflected predominantly by alterations in proteins assigned to metabolic functions in the LV whereas structural remodelling was more obvious in the RV. Alterations related to intermediate filaments were seen in both ventricles and highlight such proteins as early indicators of LV loss of function. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study report protein sets in the RV and the LV being associated with ventricular function and remodelling in DCM. Protein abundances in the LV and the RV emphasize and expand current knowledge on pathophysiological changes in heart failure and DCM. While RV and LV EMBs do not differ concerning diagnostic assessment of inflammatory status and virus persistence, additional information reflecting disease severity associated protein alterations can be gained by EMB protein profiling. RV and LV protein data provided complementary information. The protein pattern of the LV reflects metabolic changes and an impaired energy production, which is associated with the degree of LV systolic dysfunction and remodelling and may yield important information about the disease status in DCM. On the other hand, at this disease stage of DCM with still preserved RV function, RV alterations in structural proteins may reflect myocardial compensatory protective mechanisms for maintenance of structure and cellular function. The study highlight particular proteins being of interest as heart failure biomarkers in both ventricles which seem to reflect the severity of the disease. Further comparative studies between different HF aetiologies have to evaluate those proteins as markers specific for DCM.", "journal": "Journal of proteomics", "date": "2020-10-20", "authors": ["SabineAmeling", "JuliaBischof", "MarcusD\u00f6rr", "StephanieK\u00f6nemann", "KlausEmpen", "KerstinWeitmann", "KarinKlingel", "DanielBeug", "Vishnu MukundDhople", "UweV\u00f6lker", "ElkeHammer", "Stephan BFelix"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jprot.2020.104018"}
{"title": "Extracellular Vesicles of GMSCs Alleviate Aging-Related Cell Senescence.", "abstract": "Healthy aging is a complex biological process with progressive accumulation of senescent cells characterized by stable cell cycle arrest, resulting in impaired homeostasis, regenerative potential, and gradual functional decline in multiple tissues and organs, whereby the aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling networks plays a central role. Herein, we explored the effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (GMSC-EVs) on oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence in human endothelial cells and skin fibroblasts and their antiaging potentials. Our results showed that GMSC-EVs robustly abrogated oxidative stress-induced upregulation in the expression of cellular senescence-related genes, such as \u03b2-galactosidase, p21, p53, and \u03b3H2AX, and mTOR/pS6 signaling pathway, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and skin fibroblasts. Meanwhile, GMSC-EVs restored oxidative stress-induced impairment in proliferation and tube formation by HUVECs. Systemic administration of GMSC-EVs attenuated aging-associated elevation in the expression levels of p21, mTOR/pS6, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 in skin and heart tissues of aged mice. These findings suggest that GMSC-EVs could be a potential alternative source of cell-free product for attenuation of aging-related skin and vascular dysfunctions due to their potent inhibitory effects on oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence in endothelial cells and skin fibroblasts.", "journal": "Journal of dental research", "date": "2020-10-20", "authors": ["H ZShi", "J CZeng", "S HShi", "HGiannakopoulos", "Q ZZhang", "A DLe"], "doi": "10.1177/0022034520962463"}

{"title": "Methods for histological characterization of cryo-induced myocardial infarction in a rat model.", "abstract": "Ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery has been commonly employed to induce myocardial infarction (MI) in animals; however, it is known to pose setbacks in the form of cardiac arrhythmias and unpredictable areas of necrotic damage. Cryo-infarction is an alternate method that has been adopted to create a reproducible model of a myocardial injury. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to thoracotomy followed by cryo-induced infarction of the heart, while the control-sham group was only subjected to thoracotomy following which the heart was collected from all animals. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed to determine cardiac muscle density, fiber length, and fiber curvature. Observations revealed reduced muscle density, cardiac fiber length, and distorted fibers in infarcted tissue sections. Gomori's Trichrome staining was performed on tissue sections to study the effects of post MI on collagen, which showed enhanced intensity of collagen staining indicating fibrosis for the experimental models as compared to the sham models, an established consequence to myocardial injury. Immunohistochemical staining of the tissue sections with DAPI and connexin-43 (Cx-43) revealed that there was reduced DAPI staining and a less pronounced expression of Cx-43 in the experimental samples as compared to the sham samples. Results implied significant cell damage resulting from the cryo-infarction, subsequently disrupting and disaggregating the functional Cx-43 junction in cardiac myocytes, which is essential for normal and healthy cardiac physiology and function.

We aimed to find potential network for circRNA-related competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in atrial fibrillation (AF).\nThe circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression profiles in the heart tissue from AF patients were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and analyzed comprehensively. Differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs), differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were identified, followed by the establishment of DEcircRNA-DEmiRNA-DEmRNA regulatory network. Functional annotation analysis of host gene of DEcircRNAs and DEmRNAs in ceRNA regulatory network was performed. In vitro experiment and electronic validation were used to validate the expression of DEcircRNAs, DEmiRNAs, and DEmRNAs.\nA total of 1611 DEcircRNAs, 51 DEmiRNAs, and 1250 DEmRNAs were identified in AF. The DEcircRNA-DEmiRNA-DEmRNA network contained 62 circRNAs, 14 miRNAs, and 728 mRNAs. Among which, two ceRNA regulatory pairs of hsa-circRNA-100053-hsa-miR-455-5p-TRPV1 and hsa-circRNA-005843-hsa-miR-188-5p-SPON1 were identified. In addition, six miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs including hsa-miR-34c-5p-INMT, hsa-miR-1253-DDIT4L, hsa-miR-508-5p-SMOC2, hsa-miR-943-ACTA1, hsa-miR-338-3p-WIPI1, and hsa-miR-199a-3p-RAP1GAP2 were also obtained. MTOR was a significantly enriched signaling pathway of host gene of DEcircRNAs. In addition, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were remarkably enriched signaling pathways of DEmRNAs in DEcircRNA-DEmiRNA-DEmRNA regulatory network. The expression validation of hsa-circRNA-402565, hsa-miR-34c-5p, hsa-miR-188-5p, SPON1, DDIT4L, SMOC2, and WIPI1 was consistent with the integrated analysis.\nWe speculated that hsa-circRNA-100053-hsa-miR-455-5p-TRPV1 and hsa-circRNA-005843-hsa-miR-188-5p-SPON1 interaction pairs may be involved in AF.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2020-10-17", "authors": ["TaoLiu", "GuoruZhang", "YalingWang", "MingyueRao", "YangZhang", "AnjunGuo", "MeiWang"], "doi": "10.1155/2020/8037273\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.012061\n10.1056/NEJMoa1707855\n10.1186/1472-6963-14-329\n10.3389/fgene.2019.00526\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.01.045\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.11912\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.01.017\n10.1164/rccm.201601-0165RR\n10.1172/JCI84669\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.03.022\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.07.036\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv713\n10.3389/fgene.2019.00108\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1126/science.1241359\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.07.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.258723\n10.1016/j.gene.2019.02.098\n10.1111/bph.14064\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.11.010\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.06.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030933\n10.1007/s12013-009-9063-6\n10.1074/mcp.M114.046813\n10.2337/db11-0952\n10.1016/j.molonc.2011.11.001\n10.1126/scisignal.aaf5967\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.01.160\n10.1093/cid/cix506\n10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2018.09.018\n10.1186/1471-2164-15-509\n10.1093/cvr/cvr155\n10.1155/2015/592512\n10.1038/s41598-018-28118-1\n10.1172/jci.insight.122929\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.813576\n10.1038/nature11739\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079629\n10.7150/ijms.21660\n10.6515/ACS.201803_34(2).20170926A\n10.1111/jcmm.12242\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.02.004\n10.1172/JCI43008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311147\n10.1186/s13023-016-0407-1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.309345\n10.1016/S0002-9149(01)02290-1\n10.1253/circj.CJ-07-1087\n10.1002/clc.4960200609\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)00511-8\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2004.05.060\n10.1016/j.echo.20c06.03.011\n10.1378/chest.86.4.595\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.06.065\n10.1093/ejechocard/jep054\n10.1093/ehjci/jet024\n10.1016/0735-1097(94)00529-Y\n10.1253/circj.CJ-09-0140"}

Compared with WT mice, the levels of LDH, CK-MB, AST, and cTn-I in serum and MDA in heart tissues of db/db mice increased significantly. Activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in heart tissues of db/db mice decreased significantly.

{"title": "Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Engineered Cardiac Tissues From Patient-Specific Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes Reveals Abnormal Developmental Trajectory and Intrinsic Contractile Defects in Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome.", "abstract": "Background To understand the intrinsic cardiac developmental and functional abnormalities in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) free from effects secondary to anatomic defects, we performed and compared single-cell transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses of patient- and healthy subject-derived human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and engineered tissue models. Methods and Results We derived hiPSC lines from 3 patients with PAIVS and 3 healthy subjects and differentiated them into hiPSC-CMs, which were then bioengineered into the human cardiac anisotropic sheet and human cardiac tissue strip custom-designed for electrophysiological and contractile assessments, respectively. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of hiPSC-CMs, human cardiac anisotropic sheet, and human cardiac tissue strip was performed to examine the transcriptomic basis for any phenotypic abnormalities using pseudotime and differential expression analyses. Through pseudotime analysis, we demonstrated that bioengineered tissue constructs provide pro-maturational cues to hiPSC-CMs, although the maturation and development were attenuated in PAIVS hiPSC-CMs. Furthermore, reduced contractility and prolonged contractile kinetics were observed with PAIVS human cardiac tissue strips. Consistently, single-cell RNA sequencing of PAIVS human cardiac tissue strips and hiPSC-CMs exhibited diminished expression of cardiac contractile apparatus genes. By contrast, electrophysiological aberrancies were absent in PAIVS human cardiac anisotropic sheets. Conclusions Our findings were the first to reveal intrinsic abnormalities of cardiomyocyte development and function in PAIVS free from secondary effects. We conclude that hiPSC-derived engineered tissues offer a unique method for studying primary cardiac abnormalities and uncovering pathogenic mechanisms that underlie sporadic congenital heart diseases.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2020-10-17", "authors": ["Yin-YuLam", "WendyKeung", "Chun-HoChan", "LinGeng", "NicodemusWong", "DavidBreni\u00e8re-Letuffe", "Ronald ALi", "Yiu-FaiCheung"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.120.016528\n10.1161/HCG.0000000000000043."}

{"title": "Endothelial extracellular vesicles contain protective proteins and rescue ischemia-reperfusion injury in a human heart-on-chip.", "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from various stem cell sources induce cardioprotective effects during ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). These have been attributed mainly to the antiapoptotic, proangiogenic, microRNA (miRNA) cargo within the stem cell-derived EVs. However, the mechanisms of EV-mediated endothelial signaling to cardiomyocytes, as well as their therapeutic potential toward ischemic myocardial injury, are not clear. EV content beyond miRNA that may contribute to cardioprotection has not been fully illuminated. This study characterized the protein cargo of human vascular endothelial EVs (EEVs) to identify lead cardioactive proteins and assessed the effect of EEVs on human laminar cardiac tissues (hlCTs) exposed to IRI. We mapped the protein content of human vascular EEVs and identified proteins that were previously associated with cellular metabolism, redox state, and calcium handling, among other processes. Analysis of the protein landscape of human cardiomyocytes revealed corresponding modifications induced by EEV treatment. To assess their human-specific cardioprotection in vitro, we developed a human heart-on-a-chip IRI assay using human stem cell-derived, engineered cardiac tissues. We found that EEVs alleviated cardiac cell death as well as the loss in contractile capacity during and after simulated IRI in an uptake- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that EEVs increased the respiratory capacity of normoxic cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that vascular EEVs rescue hlCTs exposed to IRI possibly by supplementing injured myocytes with cargo that supports multiple metabolic and salvage pathways and therefore may serve as a multitargeted therapy for IRI.", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "date": "2020-10-16", "authors": ["MoranYadid", "Johan ULind", "Herdeline Ann MArdo\u00f1a", "Sean PSheehy", "Lauren EDickinson", "FeyisayoEweje", "Maartje M CBastings", "BenjaminPope", "Blakely BO'Connor", "Juerg RStraubhaar", "BogdanBudnik", "Andre GKleber", "Kevin KitParker"], "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.aax8005"}
{"title": "Myeloid differentiation factor 2 in the heart: Bench to bedside evidence for potential clinical benefits?", "abstract": "Cardiac inflammation has been involved in many pathological processes in the heart including cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, adverse remodeling, and dysfunction. Myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) is a key mediating protein that has been shown to contribute to the inflammatory process. MD2 is required for the activation of TLR4 in the form of dimerization complex. Upon activation of TLR4, the signal can be sent through either myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (Myd88) or toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) proteins to activate the inflammatory response in cardiac tissue, after which the inflammatory cytokines and genes are produced. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a positive correlation was demonstrated between the serum MD2 levels and mortality rate. Therefore, MD2 inhibition should provide beneficial effects in inflammation related to cardiac diseases such as obesity and heart failure. Multiple inhibitors of TLR4/MD2 interaction reportedly attenuated cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in animals with obesity and heart failure. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the reports from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies regarding the role of MD2 and the effects of MD2 inhibitors on cardiac inflammation, dysfunction, fibrosis, and remodeling.

It is characterized by the emergence of myofibroblasts and early activation of pro-fibrotic signaling pathways before adverse ventricular remodeling and progression of HF. Boron has been reported in recent years to augment the innate immune system and cell proliferation, which play an important role in the repair and regeneration of the injured tissue. Currently, the effect of boron on cardiac contractility and remodeling is unknown. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the effect of boron supplementation on cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis and regeneration in a rat model myocardial infarction (MI)-induced HF. MI was induced in animals and borax, a sodium salt of boron, was administered for 7\u00a0days, p.o., 21\u00a0days post-injury at a dose level of 4\u00a0mg/kg body weight. Transthoracic echocardiographic analysis showed a significant improvement in systolic and diastolic functions with boron treatment compared to saline control. In addition, boron administration showed a marked reduction in myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis in the injured hearts, highlighting a protective effect of boron in the ischemic heart. Interestingly, we observed a tenfold increase of nuclei in thin myocardial sections stained positive for the cell cycle marker Ki67 in the MI boron-treated rats compared to saline, indicative of increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in MI hearts, highlighting its potential role in regeneration post-injury. We similarly observed increased Ki67 and BrdU staining in cultured fresh neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Collectively, the results show that boron positively impacted MI-induced HF and attenuated cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis, two prominent features of HF. Importantly, boron has the potential to induce cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and potentially cardiac tissue regeneration after injury.

Then, MEG3 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) were silenced and microRNA-223 (miR-223) was over-expressed in the VMC mice, followed by determination of ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS). Dual-luciferase reporter assay was introduced to test the interaction among MEG3, TRAF6 and miR-223. Macrophages were isolated from cardiac tissues and bone marrow, and polarization of M1 or M2 macrophages was induced. Then, the expressions of components of NLRP3 inflammatory body (NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1), M1 markers (CD86, iNOS and TNF-\u03b1) and M2 markers (CD206, Arginase-1 and Fizz-1) were measured following MEG3 silencing. In the VMC mouse model, MEG3 and TRAF6 levels were obviously increased, while miR-223 expression was significantly reduced. Down-regulation of MEG3 resulted in the inhibition of TRAF6 by promoting miR-223. TRAF6 was negatively correlated with miR-223, but positively correlated with MEG3 expression.

The diagnosis of cardiac involvement is often delayed and yields an adverse prognosis.\nin this review, the authors report current literature on advances in pharmacotherapy for cardiac amyloidosis, mainly focused on AL and ATTR amyloidosis treatment.\nMost pharmacological trials in amyloidosis patients, both AL and TTR, are directed to study the effects of drugs on polyneuropathy. However, since cardiac involvement carries a prominent negative survival impact in amyloidosis patients, future research should be more focused on amyloidosis cardiomyopathy as primary endpoint. Additionally, in AL amyloidosis therapies are mainly derived from experience on multiple myeloma treatment. In this specific setting, possible future research could particularly focus on immunotherapeutic agents able to optimize the standard chemotherapy results and, thus, allowing a larger population of patients to be treated by bone marrow stem cell transplantation.", "journal": "Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy", "date": "2020-10-13", "authors": ["RSpoladore", "GFalasconi", "MMarcatti", "SDi Maio", "GFiore", "MSlavich", "AMargonato", "ATurco", "GFragasso"], "doi": "10.1080/14656566.2020.1836159"}

{"title": "Scalable Biomimetic Coaxial Aligned Nanofiber Cardiac Patch: A Potential Model for \"Clinical Trials in a Dish\".", "abstract": "Recent advances in cardiac tissue engineering have shown that human induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) cultured in a three-dimensional (3D) micro-environment exhibit superior physiological characteristics compared with their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts. These 3D cultured hiPSC-CMs have been used for drug testing as well as cardiac repair applications. However, the fabrication of a cardiac scaffold with optimal biomechanical properties and high biocompatibility remains a challenge. In our study, we fabricated an aligned polycaprolactone (PCL)-Gelatin coaxial nanofiber patch using electrospinning. The structural, chemical, and mechanical properties of the patch were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunocytochemistry (ICC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-spectroscopy, and tensile testing. hiPSC-CMs were cultured on the aligned coaxial patch for 2 weeks and their viability [lactate dehydrogenase (LDH assay)], morphology (SEM, ICC), and functionality [calcium cycling, multielectrode array (MEA)] were assessed. Furthermore, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and MEA were used to evaluate the cardiotoxicity and physiological functionality of the cells in response to cardiac drugs. Nanofibers patches were comprised of highly aligned core-shell fibers with an average diameter of 578 \u00b1 184 nm. Acellular coaxial patches were significantly stiffer than gelatin alone with an ultimate tensile strength of 0.780 \u00b1 0.098 MPa, but exhibited gelatin-like biocompatibility. Furthermore, hiPSC-CMs cultured on the surface of these aligned coaxial patches (3D cultures) were elongated and rod-shaped with well-organized sarcomeres, as observed by the expression of cardiac troponin-T and \u03b1-sarcomeric actinin. Additionally, hiPSC-CMs cultured on these coaxial patches formed a functional syncytium evidenced by the expression of connexin-43 (Cx-43) and synchronous calcium transients. Moreover, MEA analysis showed that the hiPSC-CMs cultured on aligned patches showed an improved response to cardiac drugs like Isoproterenol (ISO), Verapamil (VER), and E4031, compared to the corresponding 2D cultures. Overall, our results demonstrated that an aligned, coaxial 3D cardiac patch can be used for culturing of hiPSC-CMs. These biomimetic cardiac patches could further be used as a potential 3D ", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2020-10-13", "authors": ["NareshKumar", "DivyaSridharan", "ArunkumarPalaniappan", "Julie ADougherty", "AndrasCzirok", "Dona GretaIsai", "MuhamadMergaye", "Mark GAngelos", "Heather MPowell", "MahmoodKhan"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2020.567842\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.09.044\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.12.036\n10.1080/00914037.2019.1581198\n10.3390/ijms16035517\n10.1093/toxsci/kfx289\n10.3390/membranes8030062\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0687\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.09.014\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.07.013\n10.4252/wjsc.v11.i12.1065\n10.1186/s12860-015-0067-3\n10.1371/journal.pone.0116281\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.07.065\n10.1016/b978-0-08-100979-6.00006-9\n10.1039/c8ra08187e\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.10.025\n10.1159/000477436\n10.1161/circulationaha.117.030785\n10.1016/j.jphs.2018.06.005\n10.1016/j.scr.2016.04.014\n10.1093/toxsci/kft113\n10.1007/s12010-019-03147-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0059482\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.05.025\n10.1002/app.25965\n10.3390/ijms19030745\n10.1002/jbm.a.33200\n10.1161/circresaha.117.305365\n10.1093/rb/rbz017\n10.1371/journal.pone.0126338\n10.5483/bmbrep.2016.49.1.165\n10.1016/j.vascn.2017.02.001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.014\n10.3390/cells8111331\n10.1042/bcj20170780\n10.4252/wjsc.v11.i1.33\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077538\n10.1093/cvr/cvr132\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.10.007\n10.4070/kcj.2018.0312\n10.1038/aps.2017.183\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00934\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.036\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.12.001\n10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00110-8\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.07.009\n10.1039/c9ra05012d\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.05.024\n10.4161/org.6.4.12909\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.06.036\n10.1039/c7bm00323d\n10.1161/circresaha.117.310738\n10.1007/s10439-005-3037-7\n10.1093/toxsci/kfy264\n10.1021/bm050743i\n10.3389/fphar.2019.01093\n10.1016/j.copbio.2016.03.014\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.036\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00087"}

However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect on CVD has not been clearly elucidated yet.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the potential cardioprotective mechanism of SBP in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) model rats by applying proteomic approach.\nThe rat model of MI was generated by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Eighteen rats were randomly divided into three groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06 each): the MI group, MI group treated with SBP (SBP), and sham-operated group (SOG). Cardiac function in the experimental groups was assessed by echocardiography analyses after 15 days of treatment. A label-free quantitative proteomic approach was utilized to investigate the whole proteomes of heart tissues from the groups above on the day of the operation (Day 0) and 15 days later (Day 15). The differentially expressed proteins were subsequently analyzed with bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the expression levels of two promising proteins were validated by Western blotting.\nThe echocardiography analyses showed that SBP treatment significantly preserved the cardiac function of MI rats. Additionally, quantitative proteomics identified 389 differentially expressed proteins, and 15 proteins were considered as logical candidates for explaining the cardioprotective effect of SBP. Bioinformatic analysis of these differentially expressed proteins revealed that the proteins involved in cellular mitochondrial energy metabolism processes, such as fatty acid beta-oxidation and aerobic respiration, were significantly regulated under SBP treatment, of which fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) and myoglobin (MB) were significantly downregulated in the MI model group compared with the SOG group and returned to the basal level with SBP treatment, confirmed by Western blotting.\nThe results of our study suggest that the cardioprotective effects of SBP are achieved through the preservation of energy metabolism in the heart tissue of MI rats.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2020-10-12", "authors": ["FengYu", "YueYu", "SaisaiTian", "YantingZhou", "XianglingChen", "JiYe", "QianLiu", "XikeXu", "HuZhou", "WeidongZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2020.113460"}

The MCT groups received intraperitoneal injection (60 mg/kg) of MCT and remained exposed to the substance for 15 days (G15, n = 10), 30 days (G30, n = 10) and 37 days (G37, n = 20). At the end of each period, the animals were sacrificed, and pulmonary and cardiac tissues were collected for anatomopathological and morphometric analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used, considering a level of significance of 5%.\nIn the lungs of MCT animals, lesions related to pulmonary arteriopathy were found, including muscularization of the arterioles, hypertrophy of the middle layer and concentric neointimal lesions. Complex lesions were observed in MCT groups, described as plexiform and plexiform-like lesions. Right ventricular hypertrophy was evidenced by increased thickness and diameter of the cardiomyocytes and a significant increase in the right ventricular wall thickness (p <0.0000).\nThe MCT model was able to generate moderate-severe pulmonary arteriopathy associated with secondary right ventricular hypertrophy. The 37-day survival rate was 50%. To our knowledge, this study was the first to note the presence of complex vascular lesions, similar to those observed in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, in an isolated MCT model.

{"title": "Membranes for Modelling Cardiac Tissue Stiffness In Vitro Based on Poly(trimethylene carbonate) and Poly(ethylene glycol) Polymers.", "abstract": "Despite the increased expenditure of the pharmaceutical industry on research and development, the number of drugs for cardiovascular diseases that reaches the market is decreasing. A major issue is the limited ability of the current in vitro and experimental animal models to accurately mimic human heart disease, which hampers testing of the efficacy of potential cardiac drugs. Moreover, many non-heart-related drugs have severe adverse cardiac effects, which is a major cause of drugs' retraction after approval. A main hurdle of current in vitro models is their inability to mimic the stiffness of in vivo cardiac tissue. For instance, poly(styrene) petri dishes, which are often used in these models, have a Young's modulus in the order of GPa, while the stiffness of healthy human heart tissue is <50 kPa. In pathological conditions, such as scarring and fibrosis, the stiffness of heart tissue is in the >100 kPa range. In this study, we focus on developing new membranes, with a set of properties for mimicry of cardiac tissue stiffness in vitro, based on methacrylate-functionalized macromers and triblock-copolymers of poly(trimethylene carbonate) and poly(ethylene glycol). The new membranes have Young's moduli in the hydrated state ranging from 18 kPa (healthy tissue) to 2.5 MPa (pathological tissue), and are suitable for cell contraction studies using human pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes. The membranes with higher hydrophilicity have low drug adsorption and low Young's moduli and could be suitable for drug screening applications.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2020-10-08", "authors": ["IrisAllijn", "MarceloRibeiro", "Andr\u00e9Poot", "RobertPassier", "DimitriosStamatialis"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes10100274\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.850677\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.03.008\n10.1002/app.41050\n10.1039/b612140c\n10.1177/1087057108327326\n10.1021/ac300771z\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.11.062\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.12.014\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.09.017\n10.3233/CH-151936\n10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01721\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.07.009\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.025\n10.1016/S0169-409X(00)00129-0\n10.1021/jm020017n\n10.1088/0953-8984/22/19/194116\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.044\n10.1016/S1369-7021(05)71079-8\n10.1172/JCI69830\n10.1172/JCI34472\n10.1093/cvr/cvn041\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.12.024\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.08.045\n10.1152/ajpheart.00799.2013\n10.1016/0022-2828(91)90215-8\n10.1002/cm.20290\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.182469\n10.1038/s41596-018-0076-8\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.036"}

{"title": "Delayed global feedback in the genesis and stability of spatiotemporal\u00a0excitation\u00a0patterns in paced biological excitable media.", "abstract": "Biological excitable media, such as cardiac or neural cells and tissue, exhibit memory in which a change in the present excitation may affect the behaviors in the next excitation. For example, a change in calcium (Ca2+) concentration in a cell in the present excitation may affect the Ca2+ dynamics in the next excitation via bi-directional coupling between voltage and Ca2+, forming a delayed feedback loop. Since the Ca2+ dynamics inside the excitable cells are spatiotemporal while the membrane voltage is a global signal, the feedback loop is then a delayed global feedback (DGF) loop. In this study, we investigate the roles of DGF in the genesis and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns in periodically-paced excitable media using mathematical models with different levels of complexity: a model composed of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo units, a 3-dimensional physiologically-detailed ventricular myocyte model, and a coupled map lattice model. We investigate the dynamics of excitation patterns that are temporal period-2 (P2) and spatially concordant or discordant, such as subcellular concordant or discordant Ca2+alternans in cardiac myocytes or spatially concordant or discordant Ca2+ and repolarization alternans in cardiac tissue. Our modeling approach allows both computer simulations and rigorous analytical treatments, which lead to the following results and conclusions. When DGF is absent, concordant and discordant P2 patterns occur depending on initial conditions with the discordant P2 patterns being spatially random. When the DGF is negative, only concordant P2 patterns exist. When the DGF is positive, both concordant and discordant P2 patterns can occur. The discordant P2 patterns are still spatially random, but they satisfy that the global signal exhibits a temporal period-1 behavior.

{"title": "Noninvasive Radioablation of Ventricular Tachycardia.", "abstract": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs most commonly in the presence of structural heart disease or myocardial scarring from prior infarction. It is associated with increased mortality, especially when it results in cardiac arrest outside of a hospital. When not due to reversible causes (such as acute ischemia/infarction), placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for prevention of future sudden death is indicated. The current standard of care for recurrent VT is medical management with antiarrhythmic agents followed by invasive catheter ablation for VT that persists despite appropriate medical therapy. Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation (STAR) is a novel, noninvasive method of treating VT that has been shown to reduce VT burden for patients who are refractory to medical therapy and/or catheter ablation, or who are unable to tolerate catheter ablation. STAR is the term applied to the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy for the treatment of arrhythmogenic cardiac tissue and requires collaboration between an electrophysiologist and a radiation oncologist. The process involves identification of VT substrate through a combination of electroanatomic mapping and diagnostic imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) followed by carefully guided radiation therapy. In this article, we review currently available literature describing the utilization, efficacy, safety profile, and potential future applications of STAR for the management of VT.", "journal": "Cardiology in review", "date": "2020-10-06", "authors": ["Ammar MAthar", "Christopher CNabors", "KartikDhaduk", "SrikanthYandrapalli", "AnantJain", "Chitti RMoorthy", "Edward CHalperin", "SeiIwai", "William HFrishman", "JasonJacobson"], "doi": "10.1097/CRD.0000000000000321"}

{"title": "The protective effect of L-glutamine against acute Cantharidin-induced Cardiotoxicity in the mice.", "abstract": "Cantharidin (CTD) is a compound which have the potential to be exploited as an antitumor drug, and it has been demonstrated antitumor effects in a variety of cancers. However, the use is limited due to its severe toxicity. It has reported that it can induce fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Fortunately, we found that L-glutamine can alleviate cardiac toxicity caused by cantharidin in mice.\nTo investigate the protective effect of L-glutamine, we used a high dose of cantharidin in mice to create a model of cardiotoxicity. In the experimental mice, glutamine was given orally half an hour before they were administrated with cantharidin. The mice of control group were intraperitoneally injected with DMSO solution. The general state of all mice, cardiac mass index, electrocardiogram change and biological markers were determined. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining) of heart tissue was carried out in each group to reflect the protective effect of glutamine. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the injury and cardio-protection, multiple oxidative stress indexes were determined and succinate dehydrogenase activity was evaluated.\nThe results showed that L-glutamine (Gln) pretreatment reduced weight loss and mortality.

Notably, myocardium has extremely limited regeneration potential due to the loss or death of cardiomyocytes (i.e., the cells of which the myocardium is comprised) upon MI. A variety of stem cells and stem cell-derived cardiovascular cells, in situ cardiac fibroblasts and endogenous proliferative epicardium, have been exploited to provide renewable cellular sources to treat injured myocardium. Also, different strategies, including direct injection of cell suspensions, bioactive molecules, or cell-incorporated biomaterials, and implantation of artificial cardiac scaffolds (e.g., cell sheets and cardiac patches), have been developed to deliver renewable cells and/or bioactive molecules to the MI site for the myocardium regeneration. This article briefly surveys cell sources and delivery strategies, along with biomaterials and their processing techniques, developed for MI treatment. Key issues and challenges, as well as recommendations for future research, are also discussed.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2020-10-02", "authors": ["LihongHe", "XiongbiaoChen"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202001175"}
{"title": "Human-Recombinant-Elastin-Based Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting of Vascularized Soft Tissues.", "abstract": "Bioprinting has emerged as an advanced method for fabricating complex 3D tissues. Despite the tremendous potential of 3D bioprinting, there are several drawbacks of current bioinks and printing methodologies that limit \u00a0the ability to print elastic and highly vascularized tissues. In particular, fabrication of complex biomimetic structure that are entirely based on 3D bioprinting is still challenging primarily due to the lack of suitable bioinks with high printability, biocompatibility, biomimicry, and proper mechanical properties. To address these shortcomings, in this work the use of recombinant human tropoelastin as a highly biocompatible and elastic bioink for 3D printing of complex soft tissues is demonstrated. As proof of the concept, vascularized cardiac constructs are bioprinted and their functions are assessed in vitro and in vivo. The printed constructs demonstrate endothelium barrier function and spontaneous beating of cardiac muscle cells, which are important functions of cardiac tissue in vivo. Furthermore, the printed construct elicits minimal inflammatory responses, and is shown to be efficiently biodegraded in vivo when implanted subcutaneously in rats. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of the elastic bioink for printing 3D functional cardiac tissues, which can eventually be used for cardiac tissue replacement.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2020-10-02", "authors": ["SohyungLee", "Ehsan ShirzaeiSani", "Andrew RSpencer", "YvonneGuan", "Anthony SWeiss", "NasimAnnabi"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202003915\n10.3389/conf"}

All formulations were assessed by spectroscopic techniques (Raman and UV-Vis) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To estimate the therapeutic effect of DOX-AuGSs in liver cancer, murine HepG2 cells were used to induce a hepatic carcinoma model in nude mice. The survival time of the tumor-bearing mice, body weight and tumor volume were measured and recorded. The cytokines were used to detect the serum inflammatory factors, and the blood cell analyzer was used to determine the blood cell content of different groups of nude mice. The outcomes demonstrate that DOX-AuGCs significantly suppressed the tumor growth derived from human HepG2 injection and reduce the tumor index without affecting the body weight of mice. Moreover, DOX-AuGCs significantly reduced the serum levels of cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 P70.

Reversing left ventricular (LV) myocardial fibrosis has been considered as a key goal for curing chronic hypertension and has been a hot field of research in recent years. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at PC6 on hypertension-induced myocardial fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Thirty SHRs were randomized into model, SHR + EA, and SHR + Sham EA groups with WKY rats as a normal control. EA was applied once a day for 8 consecutive weeks. The cardiac fibrosis as well as the underlying mechanisms were investigated. After 8 weeks of EA treatment at PC6, the enhanced myocardial fibrosis in SHRs was characterized by an increased ratio of left ventricular mass index (LVMI), collagen volume fraction (CVF), and elevated content of hydroxyproline (Hyp) as well as the upregulated expression of collagen I and collagen III in myocardium tissue of SHRs. All these abnormal alterations in the SHR + EA group were significantly lower compared to the model group. In addition, EA at PC6 significantly improved the pathological changes of myocardial morphology. Meanwhile, the increased levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 in the serum or heart tissue of SHRs were also markedly diminished by EA.

{"title": "Mesenchymal stem cell secretions improve donor heart function following ex\u00a0vivo cold storage.", "abstract": "Heart transplantation is the gold standard of treatments for end-stage heart failure, but its use is limited by extreme shortage of donor organs. The time \"window\" between procurement and transplantation sets the stage for myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, which constrains the maximal storage time and lowers use of donor organs. Given mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived paracrine protection, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of MSC-conditioned medium (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) when added to ex\u00a0vivo preservation solution on ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial damage in donor hearts.\nMouse donor hearts were stored at 0\u00b0C-4\u00b0C of <1-hour cold ischemia (<1hr-I), 6hr-I\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, 6hr-I\u00a0+\u00a0MSC-CM, 6hr-I\u00a0+\u00a0MSC-EVs, and 6hr-I\u00a0+\u00a0MSC-CM from MSCs treated with exosome release inhibitor. The hearts were then heterotopically implanted into recipient mice. At 24\u00a0hours postsurgery, myocardial function was evaluated. Heart tissue was collected for analysis of histology, apoptotic cell death, microRNA (miR)-199a-3p expression, and myocardial cytokine production.\nSix-hour cold ischemia significantly impaired myocardial function, increased cell death, and reduced miR-199a-3p in implanted hearts versus <1hr-I. MSC-CM or MSC-EVs in preservation solution reversed the detrimental effects of prolong cold ischemia on donor hearts. Exosome-depleted MSC-CM partially abolished MSC secretome-mediated cardioprotection in implanted hearts. MiR-199a-3p was highly enriched in MSC-EVs. MSC-CM and MSC-EVs increased cold ischemia-downregulated miR-199a-3p in donor hearts, whereas exosome-depletion neutralized this effect.\nMSC-CM and MSC-EVs confer improved myocardial preservation in donor hearts during prolonged cold static storage and MSC-EVs can be used for intercellular transport of miRNAs in heart transplantation.", "journal": "The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery", "date": "2020-09-29", "authors": ["MeijingWang", "LiangliangYan", "QianzhenLi", "YangYang", "MarkTurrentine", "KeithMarch", "I-WenWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.08.095"}

{"title": "Excessive ROS production and enhanced autophagy contribute to myocardial injury induced by branched-chain amino acids: Roles for the AMPK-ULK1 signaling pathway and \u03b17nAChR.", "abstract": "Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are diet derived and essential amino acids that are termed branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). BCAA are widely used as dietary supplements to boost muscle growth and enhance exercise performance. However, the effects of BCAA on myocardial function are largely unknown. This study was designed to investigate whether BCAA affect heart function and, if so, to further explore the underlying molecular basis for the observed effects.\nC57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups, the control group received solvent (water) and the BCAA group received 2% BCAA dissolved in water, for a successive period of 12\u00a0weeks. Compared with control, BCAA treatment significantly increased water consumption without changing body weight or diet consumption; heart tissue BCAA levels were increased, markers representative of myocardial injury in heart tissue including c-reactive protein and cardiac muscle troponin were increased ; and creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase were increased in serum; severe myocardial fibrosis was observed by Masson staining, which was accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased superoxide dismutase activity in heart tissue; both p-AMPK and p-ULK1 were significantly increased as was autophagy, judged by the presence of LC3 by western blotting and immunofluorescence, increased numbers of autophagosomes were found by transmission electron microscopy in the BCAA group. In vitro, 20\u00a0mmol/L BCAA significantly decreased cell viability and increased the production of ROS, as well as the expression of p-AMPK/AMPK and p-ULK1/ULK1 in cultured H9C2 cells. Treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) improved cell viability and reversed ROS changes. Decreased H9C2 cell viability induced with 20\u00a0mmol/L BCAA was reversed by either blocking AMPK or inhibition of ULK1. Furthermore, blocking AMPK significantly decreased p-ULK1/ULK1, while inhibition of ULK1 reversed the enhanced expression of LC3-II/LC3-I induced by BCAA. Excessive ROS production and decreased cell viability induced by BCAA were further confirmed in primary cultured murine cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Tebuconazole induced oxidative stress and histopathological alterations in adult rat heart.", "abstract": "TEB belongs to the family of triazole fungicides and it is used to protect agricultural crop plants from fungal pathogens. The information regarding its cardiotoxic effects through different pathways particularly by perturbing the oxidative balance and causing damage to the myocardium is still limited. In the present study, oxidative and histopathologic damages caused by TEB in the cardiac tissue of male adult rats, were evaluated. Rats were exposed orally to TEB at 0.9, 9, 27 and 45\u202fmg/kg b.w. for 28\u202fdays. Results showed that following TEB treatment malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC), advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP), antioxidant enzyme activities (GPx and GR) and GSSG levels increased, while GSH levels and thus the GSH/GSSG ratio decreased. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) initially increased at the doses of 0.9, 9 and 27\u202fmg/kg b.w. and then decreased at the dose of 45\u202fmg/kg b.w. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that TEB increased SOD1, CAT and HSP70 protein levels after 24\u202fh. Furthermore, TEB induced various histological changes in the myocardium, including leucocytic infiltration, hemorrhage congestion of cardiac blood vessels and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Therefore, our investigation revealed, that TEB exhibits cardiotoxic effects by changing oxidative balance and damaging the cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Pesticide biochemistry and physiology", "date": "2020-09-28", "authors": ["Yosra BenOthm\u00e8ne", "HibaHamdi", "InesAmara", "SalwaAbid-Essefi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104671"}
{"title": "Chronic cardiac structural damage, diastolic and systolic dysfunction following acute myocardial injury due to bromine exposure in rats.", "abstract": "Accidental bromine spills are common and its large industrial stores risk potential terrorist attacks. The mechanisms of bromine toxicity and effective therapeutic strategies are unknown. Our studies demonstrate that inhaled bromine causes deleterious cardiac manifestations. In this manuscript we describe mechanisms of delayed cardiac effects in the survivors of a single bromine exposure. Rats were exposed to bromine (600\u00a0ppm for 45\u00a0min) and the survivors were sacrificed at 14 or 28\u00a0days. Echocardiography, hemodynamic analysis, histology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biochemical analysis of cardiac tissue were performed to assess functional, structural and molecular effects. Increases in right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure and LV end-diastolic wall stress with increased LV fibrosis were observed. TEM images demonstrated myofibrillar loss, cytoskeletal breakdown and mitochondrial damage at both time points. Increases in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reflected myofibrillar damage and increased LV wall stress. LV shortening decreased as a function of increasing LV end-systolic wall stress and was accompanied by increased sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inactivation and a striking dephosphorylation of phospholamban. NADPH oxidase 2 and protein phosphatase 1 were also increased. Increased circulating eosinophils and myocardial 4-hydroxynonenal content suggested increased oxidative stress as a key contributing factor to these effects. Thus, a continuous oxidative stress-induced chronic myocardial damage along with phospholamban dephosphorylation are critical for bromine-induced chronic cardiac dysfunction.

The male Sprague - Dawley rats underwent ischemia via ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery and received morphine (3\u00a0mg/kg; i.p.) for five consecutive days. Seven days post-MI, morphine led to significant reduction in MMP - 2 activity, apoptotic cell death and fibroblast density.

Recent studies have shown that fibroblasts do not respond homogeneously to heart injury. Because of the limited set of bona fide fibroblast markers, a proper characterization of fibroblast population heterogeneity in response to cardiac damage is lacking. The purpose of this study was to define CF heterogeneity during ventricular remodeling and the underlying mechanisms that regulate CF function.\nCollagen1\u03b11-GFP (green fluorescent protein)-positive CFs were characterized after myocardial infarction (MI) by single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, and functional assays. Swine and patient samples were studied using bulk RNA sequencing.\nWe identified and characterized a unique CF subpopulation that emerges after MI in mice. These activated fibroblasts exhibit a clear profibrotic signature, express high levels of Cthrc1 (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1), and localize into the scar. Noncanonical transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling and different transcription factors including SOX9 are important regulators mediating their response to cardiac injury. Absence of CTHRC1 results in pronounced lethality attributable to ventricular rupture. A population of CFs with a similar transcriptome was identified in a swine model of MI and in heart tissue from patients with MI and dilated cardiomyopathy.\nWe report CF heterogeneity and their dynamics during the course of MI and redefine the CFs that respond to cardiac injury and participate in myocardial remodeling.

Major cardiac involvement is a potentially lethal feature in severe cases. We sought to describe the underlying pathophysiological mechanism in COVID-19 lethal cardiogenic shock.\nWe report on a 48-year-old male COVID-19 patient with cardiogenic shock; despite extracorporeal life support, dialysis, and massive pharmacological support, this rescue therapy was not successful. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA was detected at autopsy in the lungs and myocardium. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of type II pneumocytes, lymphocytes in the lung interstitium, and pulmonary microemboli. Moreover, patchy muscular, sometimes perivascular, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, were seen in the cardiac tissue. The lymphocytes 'interlocked' the myocytes, resulting in myocyte degeneration and necrosis. Predominantly, T-cell lymphocytes with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 1.7 infiltrated the interstitial myocardium, reflecting true myocarditis. The myocardial tissue was examined for markers of ferroptosis, an iron-catalysed form of regulated cell death that occurs through excessive peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Immunohistochemical staining with E06, a monoclonal antibody binding to oxidized phosphatidylcholine (reflecting lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis), was positive in morphologically degenerating and necrotic cardiomyocytes adjacent to the infiltrate of lymphocytes, near arteries, in the epicardium and myocardium. A similar ferroptosis signature was present in the myocardium of a COVID-19 subject without myocarditis. In a case of sudden death due to viral myocarditis of unknown aetiology, however, immunohistochemical staining with E06 was negative. The renal proximal tubuli stained positively for E06 and also hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a reactive breakdown product of the lipid peroxides that execute ferroptosis. In the case of myocarditis of other aetiology, the renal tissue displayed no positivity for E06 or 4-HNE.\nThe findings in this case are unique as this is the first report on accumulated oxidized phospholipids (or their breakdown products) in myocardial and renal tissue in COVID-19.

{"title": "[New thoughts about study on cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in mediating delaying effect of electroacupuncture on myocardial remodeling of chronic hypertension].", "abstract": "Chronic hypertension evoked aberrant myocardial remodeling is the main reason for progressive death from heart failure. It is of great clinical significance to find effective prevention and treatment methods to block this pathological process. It has been shown that imbalance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) induced by chronic hypertension, i.e., hyper-excitation of sympathetic nerve system and suppression of parasympathetic (vagal) nerve system, activates immune cells-mediated inflammatory responses, and exacerbates the pathological remodeling of cardiac tissue. Except the negative inotropic outcomes, excitation of vagal nerves also has an anti-inflammatory effect which is mediated by activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP). Previous studies showed that electroacupuncture (EA) could exert anti-hypertensive and systematic anti-inflammatory effects by increasing vagal activity. In addition, preliminary study from our lab demonstrated that EA was able to alleviate the pathological progress from hypertension to cardiac hypertrophy. However, the potential role of CAIP in restoring hypertension induced aberrant myocardial remodeling is still unknown. Herein, based on the alteration of ANS function in hypertension and EA's impact on vagal activity, we propose novel research ideas that EA could attenuate the pathological process of hypertension induced abnormal myocardial remodeling via activating CAIP.\n\u6162\u6027\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u5f15\u8d77\u81ea\u4e3b\u795e\u7ecf\u529f\u80fd\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4ea4\u611f\u6d3b\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u526f\u4ea4\u611f(\u8ff7\u8d70)\u6d3b\u52a8\u53d7\u5230\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7531\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u708e\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u800c\u8ff7\u8d70\u795e\u7ecf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9664\u5177\u6709\u8d1f\u6027\u5fc3\u529b\u4f5c\u7528\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u53d1\u6325\u80c6\u78b1\u80fd\u6297\u708e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7535\u9488\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8ff7\u8d70\u795e\u7ecf\u53d1\u6325\u964d\u538b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6297\u708e\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7535\u9488\u53ef\u5ef6\u7f13\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u2014\u5fc3\u808c\u80a5\u539a\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u80c6\u78b1\u80fd\u6297\u708e\u901a\u8def\u5728\u7535\u9488\u7f13\u89e3\u6162\u6027\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u2014\u5fc3\u808c\u91cd\u6784\u75c5\u7406\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u72b9\u672a\u53ef\u77e5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u81ea\u4e3b\u795e\u7ecf\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u2014\u5fc3\u808c\u91cd\u6784\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u523a\u5bf9\u80c6\u78b1\u80fd\u6297\u708e\u901a\u8def\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u80c6\u78b1\u80fd\u6297\u708e\u901a\u8def\u53c2\u4e0e\u4ecb\u5bfc\u9488\u523a\u5ef6\u7f13\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u2014\u5fc3\u808c\u91cd\u6784\u75c5\u7406\u8fdb\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002.", "journal": "Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research", "date": "2020-09-23", "authors": ["Juan-JuanXin", "Yu-XueZhao", "QunLiu", "Jun-HongGao", "Xiao-ChunYu"], "doi": "10.13702/j.1000-0607.190396"}

This article aims to investigate the role of SOX2OT in MF. We constructed HF mouse models by subcutaneous injection of isoprenaline (ISO). Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were treated with ISO to induce MF.Hematoxylin-eosin, Masson, and Sirius-red staining were used to identify myocardial injury and collagen deposition in heart tissues. The relationship among SOX2OT, miR-138-5p, TGF-\u03b21, and Smad3 were evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay. The gene and protein expression were verified by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. We found that SOX2OT was up-regulated in HF mice and ISO-induced CFs. SOX2OT knockdown reduced myocardial injury and collagen deposition in HF mice. The expression of collagen I, \u03b1-SMA, TGF-\u03b21, and p-Smad3 were inhibited by SOX2OT down-regulation in HF mice and ISO-induced CFs. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 was a target gene of miR-138-5p and indirectly regulated by SOX2OT. SOX2OT promoted MF in HF by activating TGF-\u03b21/Smad3, and then Smad3 interacted with the SOX2OT promoter and formed a positive feedback loop. In conclusion, our work verifies that SOX2OT/Smad3 feedback loop promotes MF in HF. Thus, SOX2OT is potentially a novel therapeutic target for MF in HF.", "journal": "IUBMB life", "date": "2020-09-23", "authors": ["YaliOu", "ChunfengLiao", "HeLi", "GuolongYu"], "doi": "10.1002/iub.2375"}
{"title": "Mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiovascular disease: Current status of translational research/clinical and therapeutic implications.", "abstract": "Mitochondria provide energy to the cell during aerobic respiration by supplying ~95% of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules via oxidative phosphorylation. These organelles have various other functions, all carried out by numerous proteins, with the majority of them being encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Mitochondria occupy ~1/3 of the volume of myocardial cells in adults, and function at levels of high-efficiency to promptly meet the energy requirements of the myocardial contractile units. Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA), which contains 37 genes and is maternally inherited. Over the last several years, a variety of functions of these organelles have been discovered and this has led to a growing interest in their involvement in various diseases, including cardiovascular (CV) diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction relates to the status where mitochondria cannot meet the demands of a cell for ATP and there is an enhanced formation of reactive-oxygen species. This dysfunction may occur as a result of mtDNA and/or nDNA mutations, but also as a response to aging and various disease and environmental stresses, leading to the development of cardiomyopathies and other CV diseases. Designing mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies aiming to maintain or restore mitochondrial function has been a great challenge as a result of variable responses according to the etiology of the disorder. There have been several preclinical data on such therapies, but clinical studies are scarce. A major challenge relates to the techniques needed to eclectically deliver the therapeutic agents to cardiac tissues and to damaged mitochondria for successful clinical outcomes. All these issues and progress made over the last several years are herein reviewed.", "journal": "Medicinal research reviews", "date": "2020-09-23", "authors": ["Antonis SManolis", "Antonis AManolis", "Theodora AManolis", "Naomi EApostolaki", "Evdoxia JApostolopoulos", "HelenMelita", "NikiKatsiki"], "doi": "10.1002/med.21732"}

Mechanical properties are fundamental to this process, involved in a complex interplay with function, morphology, and mechanotransduction. In the current work, we propose a pressurization technique applied to the zebrafish atrium to quantify mechanical properties of the myocardium under passive tension. By further measuring deformation, we obtain a pressure-stretch relationship that is used to identify constitutive models of the zebrafish embryonic cardiac tissue. Two-dimensional results are compared with a three-dimensional finite element analysis based on reconstructed embryonic heart geometry. Through these steps, we found that the myocardium of zebrafish results in a stiffness on the order of 10\u00a0kPa immediately after the looping stage of development.

To facilitate the clinical implementation of this approach, we examined the key variables that can influence ablation-induced spectral changes, including the drop in myocardial NADH levels, the release of lipofuscin-like pigments, and the increase in diffuse reflectance of the cardiac muscle beneath the endocardial layer.

However, the severe cardiotoxicity of DOX limits its application. ADP355 is an adiponectin-based active peptide with anti-liver fibrosis and atherosclerosis properties. It remains unclear the effects and involved mechanisms of ADP355 in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected DOX once a week to induce heart failure while receiving ADP355 treatment daily for 4 weeks. At the end of experiment, blood and heart tissues were collected. We found that ADP355 markedly improved DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction and histopathological damage, and decreased serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase levels. The anti-apoptotic activity of ADP355 was indicated by reduction in TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 expression, along with decreased BCL2-associated X protein/B cell lymphoma 2 (BAX/BCL2) levels in heart tissues. Additionally, ADP355 markedly increased DOX-decreased cell viability by reducing BAX/BCL2, but inhibited reactive oxygen species production in H9c2 cells. Mechanistically, ADP355 attenuated expression of DOX-reduced nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase 2, as well as mRNA levels of Nrf2 downstream targets. Furthermore, ADP355 activated sirtuin 2 and its target genes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ADP355 alleviates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting myocardial apoptosis and oxidative stress through Nrf2 and sirtuin 2 signaling pathways.

{"title": "Automatic Quantification of Cardiomyocyte Dimensions and Connexin 43 Lateralization in Fluorescence Images.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes' geometry and connexin 43 (CX43) amount and distribution are structural features that play a pivotal role in electrical conduction. Their quantitative assessment is of high interest in the study of arrhythmias, but it is usually hampered by the lack of automatic tools. In this work, we propose a software algorithm (Myocyte Automatic Retrieval and Tissue Analyzer, MARTA) to automatically detect myocytes from fluorescent microscopy images of cardiac tissue, measure their morphological features and evaluate the expression of CX43 and its degree of lateralization. The proposed software is based on the generation of cell masks, contouring of individual cells, enclosing of cells in minimum area rectangles and splitting of these rectangles into end-to-end and middle compartments to estimate CX43 lateral-to-total ratio. Application to human ventricular tissue images shows that mean differences between automatic and manual methods in terms of cardiomyocyte length and width are below 4 \u03bcm. The percentage of lateral CX43 also agrees between automatic and manual evaluation, with the interquartile range approximately covering from 3% to 30% in both cases. MARTA is not limited by fiber orientation and has an optimized speed by using contour filtering, which makes it run hundreds of times faster than a trained expert. Developed for CX43 studies in the left ventricle, MARTA is a flexible tool applicable to morphometric and lateralization studies of other markers in any heart chamber or even skeletal muscle.

In a previous study using fresh-frozen post mortem samples of the cardiac left ventricle of Mayak workers and non-irradiated controls, we observed radiation-induced alterations in the heart proteome, mainly downregulation of mitochondrial and structural proteins. As the control group available at that time was younger than the irradiated group, we could not exclude age as a confounding factor. To address this issue, we have now expanded our study to investigate additional samples using archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Importantly, the control group studied here is older than the occupationally exposed (>500 mGy) group. Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis showed that proteins involved in the lipid metabolism, sirtuin signaling, mitochondrial function, cytoskeletal organization, and antioxidant defense were the most affected. A histopathological analysis elucidated large foci of fibrotic tissue, myocardial lipomatosis and lymphocytic infiltrations in the irradiated samples. These data highlight the suitability of FFPE material for proteomics analysis.

Male Wistar rats were treated for 8 days with isoproterenol (4.5\u00a0mg/kg; i. p.) and with farnesol (50\u00a0\u03bcM; i. p.). Hearts were subjected to evaluation of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), coronary pressure, electrocardiogram, histopathological analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and pro- and anti-apoptosis protein expression. The results showed that severe impairment of LVDP induced by cardiac hypertrophy was significantly prevented by farnesol treatment. Moreover, farnesol attenuated electrocardiographic changes that are characteristic of cardiac hypertrophy, as well as prevented the increase of fibrosis and migration of inflammatory cells in cardiac tissue. Additionally, farnesol treatment prevented the increase of cardiac ROS generation and restored the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and catalase. It was also evidenced that farnesol decreased the ERK1/2, Bax and Caspase 3 activation, and an increase of AKT and Bcl-2 protein expression, which can be associated with the pathological cardiac remodeling and also with cardioprotection mediated by farnesol, respectively. These results suggest that farnesol is a novel therapeutic agent for amelioration of cardiac hypertrophy in rats.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2020-09-22", "authors": ["Diego SantosSouza", "Tatiane de OliveiraBarreto", "Jos\u00e9 Evaldo Rodrigues deMenezes-Filho", "LuanaHeimfarth", "PaulaRhana", "Thallita KellyRabelo", "Michael Nadson SantosSantana", "Aim\u00e9e ObolariDur\u00e7o", "Michael Ramon de LimaConcei\u00e7\u00e3o", "Lucindo Jos\u00e9Quintans-J\u00fanior", "Adriana GibaraGuimar\u00e3es", "Jader SantosCruz", "Carla Maria Lins deVasconcelos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173583"}

On the 5th day of the experiment, all groups were injected with 45 mg/kg DXR into the tail vein. On the 8th day of the experiment, ECG recordings were performed under anaesthesia.\nThymoquinone reduced the PR, QRS and QTc intervals, which were increased by DXR, while melatonin only reduced the QTc interval. Melatonin had a protective effect against the histopathological changes induced by DXR, while TQ did not demonstrate such an effect. DXR increased CK-MB, IL-6, MDA, IL-1, IL-18 levels and decreased SOD in the cardiac tissue. MEL reduced the levels of CK-MB, MDA, NO, SOD, IL-1, IL-6, IL-18. Meanwhile, TQ only reduced CK-MB, IL-1 and IL-18.\nOur study showed that DXR induces cardiac injury and that melatonin improves biochemical parameters and offers histological protection; while thymoquinone improves ECG parameters and causes partial recovery of biochemical parameters (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 41).", "journal": "Bratislavske lekarske listy", "date": "2020-09-22", "authors": ["D YildizPehlivan", "GDurdagi", "E OzOyar", "SAkyol", "MOzbek"], "doi": "10.4149/BLL_2020_123"}

Linsitinib, a novel anti-cancer drug, showed promising results in pre-clinical models of Ewing Sarcoma (ES), where it suppressed tumor growth. However, a Phase II clinical trial in several European centers with patients showed relapsed and/or refractory ES. We report an integrated, open setting, imaging and sampling accessible, polysulfone-based platform, featuring minimal hydrophobic compound binding. Two bioengineered human tissues - bone ES tumor and heart muscle - were cultured either in isolation or in the integrated platform and subjected to a clinically used linsitinib dosage. The measured anti-tumor efficacy and cardiotoxicity were compared with the results observed in the clinical trial. Only the engineered tumor tissues, and not monolayers, recapitulated the bone microenvironment pathways targeted by linsitinib, and the clinically-relevant differences in drug responses between non-metastatic and metastatic ES tumors. The responses of non-metastatic ES tumor tissues and heart muscle to linsitinib were much closer to those observed in the clinical trial for tissues cultured in an integrated setting than for tissues cultured in isolation. Drug treatment of isolated tissues resulted in significant decreases in tumor viability and cardiac function. Meanwhile, drug treatment in an integrated setting showed poor tumor response and less cardiotoxicity, which matched the results of the clinical trial. Overall, the integration of engineered human tumor and cardiac tissues in the integrated platform improved the predictive accuracy for both the direct and off-target effects of linsitinib.

The implanted patches should mimic the micromechanical environment of native myocardium for effective integration and optimum mechanical function. In this study, we engineered compliant silicone scaffolds infused with cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. Porous scaffolds are fabricated by extrusion 3D printing of room-temperature-vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber. The stiffness and strength of scaffolds are tailored by designing a polymer strand arrangement during 3D printing. Single-strand scaffold design is found to display a tensile Young's modulus of \u223c280 kPa, which is optimum for supporting CMs without impairing their contractility. Uniform distribution of cells in the scaffold is observed, ascribed to 3D migration facilitated by interconnected porous architecture. The patches demonstrated synchronized contraction 10 days after seeding scaffolds with CMs. Indentation measurements reveal that the contracting cell-scaffold patches display local moduli varying from \u223c270 to 530 kPa, which covers the upper spectrum of the stiffness range displayed by the human heart.

{"title": "Robust Cardiac Regeneration: Fulfilling the Promise of Cardiac Cell Therapy.", "abstract": "We review the history of cardiac cell therapy, highlighting lessons learned from initial adult stem cell (ASC) clinical trials. We present pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) as a leading candidate for robust regeneration of infarcted myocardium but identify several issues that must be addressed before successful clinical translation.\nWe conducted an unstructured literature review of PubMed-listed articles, selecting the most comprehensive and relevant research articles, review articles, clinical trials, and basic or translation articles in the field of cardiac cell therapy. Articles were identified using the search terms adult stem cells, pluripotent stem cells, cardiac stem cell, and cardiac regeneration or from references of relevant articles, Articles were prioritized and selected based on their impact, originality, or potential clinical applicability.\nSince its inception, the ASC therapy field has been troubled by conflicting preclinical data, academic controversies, and inconsistent trial designs. These issues have damaged perceptions of cardiac cell therapy among investors, the academic community, health care professionals, and, importantly, patients. In hindsight, the key issue underpinning these problems was the inability of these cell types to differentiate directly into genuine cardiomyocytes, rendering them unable to replace damaged myocardium. Despite this, beneficial effects through indirect paracrine or immunomodulatory effects remain possible and continue to be investigated. However, in preclinical models, PSC-CMs have robustly remuscularized infarcted myocardium with functional, force-generating cardiomyocytes. Hence, PSC-CMs have now emerged as a leading candidate for cardiac regeneration, and unpublished reports of first-in-human delivery of these cells have recently surfaced. However, the cardiac cell therapy field's history should serve as a cautionary tale, and we identify several translational hurdles that still remain. Preclinical solutions to issues such as arrhythmogenicity, immunogenicity, and poor engraftment rates are needed, and next-generation clinical trials must draw on robust knowledge of mechanistic principles of the therapy.\nThe clinical transplantation of functional stem cell-derived heart tissue with seamless integration into native myocardium is a lofty goal. However, considerable advances have been made during the past 2 decades. Currently, PSC-CMs appear to be the best prospect to reach this goal, but several hurdles remain.

{"title": "Human cardiac fibroblasts expressing VCAM1 improve heart function in postinfarct heart failure rat models by stimulating lymphangiogenesis.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide. After an ischemic injury, the myocardium undergoes severe necrosis and apoptosis, leading to a dramatic degradation of function. Numerous studies have reported that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) play a critical role in heart function even after injury. However, CFs present heterogeneous characteristics according to their development stage (i.e., fetal or adult), and the molecular mechanisms by which they maintain heart function are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to explore the hypothesis that a specific population of CFs can repair the injured myocardium in heart failure following ischemic infarction, and lead to a significant recovery of cardiac function. Flow cytometry analysis of CFs defined two subpopulations according to their relative expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). Whole-transcriptome analysis described distinct profiles for these groups, with a correlation between VCAM1 expression and lymphangiogenesis-related genes up-regulation. Vascular formation assays showed a significant stimulation of lymphatic cells network complexity by VCFs. Injection of human VCAM1-expressing CFs (VCFs) in postinfarct heart failure rat models (ligation of the left anterior descending artery) led to a significant restoration of the left ventricle contraction. Over the course of the experiment, left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening increased by 16.65% \u00b1 5.64% and 10.43% \u00b1 6.02%, respectively, in VCF-treated rats. Histological examinations revealed that VCFs efficiently mobilized the lymphatic endothelial cells into the infarcted area. In conclusion, human CFs present heterogeneous expression of VCAM1 and lymphangiogenesis-promoting factors. VCFs restore the mechanical properties of ventricular walls by mobilizing lymphatic endothelial cells into the infarct when injected into a rat heart failure model. These results suggest a role of this specific population of CFs in the homeostasis of the lymphatic system in cardiac regeneration, providing new information for the study and therapy of cardiac diseases.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2020-09-17", "authors": ["TakahiroIwamiya", "Bertrand-DavidSegard", "YuimiMatsuoka", "TomomiImamura"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0237810\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02799\n10.1172/JCI37456\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1016/j.trsl.2018.07.012\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.010\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.05.002\n10.4330/wjc.v11.i10.221\n10.1016/j.phrs.2015.07.001\n10.1007/s11897-005-0002-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209809\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00147\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.042\n10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0535\n10.1172/JCI31487\n10.1172/JCI118092\n10.1152/ajpheart.00028.2019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302530\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.02.005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020143\n10.1161/JAHA.118.009565\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.002\n10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115880\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0701742\n10.1371/journal.pone.0134666\n10.1155/2016/4656539\n10.1080/14653240600855905\n10.1038/ncb2014\n10.1097/ccm.0b013e318186b843\n10.1007/s13277-016-5112-0\n10.1101/gad.13.8.1037\n10.1016/j.drudis.2012.11.013\n10.1002/jcb.10155\n10.1152/ajprenal.00352.2010\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000282198.60701.94\n10.1038/nm905\n10.1016/j.scr.2016.08.007\n10.4161/cbt.8.23.10138\n10.1371/journal.pone.0103440\n10.1073/pnas.95.24.14389\n10.1074/jbc.M110673200\n10.1096/fj.13-238998\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.06.013\n10.5114/aoms.2015.49217\n10.1111/cas.12476\n10.18632/oncoscience.180\n10.1038/nature14483\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.150433\n10.3389/fphar.2014.00001\n10.1242/dev.120576\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.07914.x\n10.3748/wjg.v21.i3.878\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259960\n10.1038/onc.2017.244\n10.1172/JCI13729\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1263\n10.1038/nrm757\n10.1007/s00441-016-2407-9\n10.1101/cshperspect.a021873\n10.1172/JCI40295\n10.1038/nm738\n10.1038/s41467-019-08626-y\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.045\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.031\n10.1371/journal.pone.0023657\n10.1016/j.reth.2016.01.005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313835\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035144\n10.3390/jcm5020027\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.938217\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.01.001\n10.1161/01.res.68.6.1713\n10.1152/ajpheart.1985.249.4.H834\n10.1007/s00395-011-0232-6\n10.1038/s41569-018-0087-8\n10.1089/lrb.2009.0014\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031794\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00439.x"}

This study investigated the regulatory mechanism and role of SOX11 in congenital heart abnormality in a hyperglycemic environment. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed decreased SOX11 protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the heart tissue of diabetic offspring compared with the control group. A Sequenom EpiTYPER MassArray showed that methylation sites upstream in SOX11 region 1 were increased in the diabetic group compared with the control group. Luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR showed that Dnmt3b overexpression decreased SOX11 promoter activity and its mRNA level, whereas Dnmt3a had little effect on regulating SOX11 expression. Furthermore, we found that Dnmt3L cooperated with Dnmt3b to regulate SOX11 gene expression. Additionally, the function of SOX11 silencing was analyzed by using small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and apoptotic assays showed that SOX11 downregulation inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.

Interestingly from this analysis, a plot of critical amplitude of action potential versus wave number revealed the growth rate of modulational instability (MI) is an increasing function of the thermoelectric couplings; [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], under fixed conditions of nonlinear electrical couplings. In order to verify our analytical predictions through the study the long-time evolution of the modulated cardiac impulses, numerical computation is finally carried out. Numerical experiment revealed the existence of localized coherent structures with some recognized features of synchronization. Through the mechanism of MI, changes in thermoelectrical couplings promote wave localization and mode transition in electrical activities in the cell lattice.

RNA-sequencing was then performed to explore the potential mechanisms and transcriptional changes in the process. The metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acid was significantly altered in DOX-treated murine heart, and Acot1 was one of the leading-edge core genes. We then investigated the role of Acot1 to ferroptosis that was reported recently to be related to DIC. The induction of ferroptosis in the DOX-treated heart was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, and the inhibition of ferroptosis using Fer-1 effectively prevented the cardiac injury as well as the ultrastructure changes of cardiomyocyte mitochondrial. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments proved the downregulation of Acot1 in DIC, which can be partially prevented with Fer-1 treatment. Overexpression of Acot1 in cell lines showed noteworthy protection to ferroptosis, while the knock-down of Acot1 sensitized cardiomyocytes to ferroptosis by DIC. Finally, the heart tissue of \u03b1MHC-Acot1 transgenic mice presented altered free fatty acid composition, indicating that the benefit of Acot1 in the inhibition of ferroptosis lies biochemically and relates to its enzymatic function in lipid metabolism in DIC. The current study highlights the importance of ferroptosis in DIC and points out the potential protective role of Acot1 in the process. The beneficial role of Acot1 may be related to its biochemical function by shaping the lipid composition. In all, Acot1 may become a potential treating target in preventing DIC by anti-ferroptosis.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2020-09-17", "authors": ["YunchangLiu", "LipingZeng", "YongYang", "ChenChen", "DaowenWang", "HongWang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41419-020-02948-2"}

{"title": "The molecular mechanism involved in cardioprotection by the dietary flavonoid fisetin as an agonist of PPAR-\u03b3 in a murine model of myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "The methodology exploring the cardioprotective potential of the flavonoid Fisetin through its ability to modulate PPAR-\u03b3 was unraveled in the present study. Computational modelling through molecular docking based binding study of interactions between Fiestin and PPAR-\u03b3 revealed the potential role of Fisetin as an agonist of PPAR-\u03b3. A murine model of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury was used to explore this further. Male Wistar Rats were randomly assigned to five groups. Fisetin (20\u00a0mg/kg; p. o) was administered for 28 days. Ischemia was induced for 45\u00a0min on the 29th day followed by 60\u00a0min of reperfusion. Fisetin pretreatment upregulated the expression of PPAR-\u03b3 in heart tissue significantly Cardioprotection was assessed by measurement of hemodynamic parameters, infarct size, ELISA for oxidative stress, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay for apoptosis, and western blot analysis for MAPK proteins and inflammation. PPAR-\u03b3 activation by fisetin led to significantly reduced infarct size, suppression of oxidative stress, reduction of cardiac injury markers, alleviation of inflammation, and inhibition of apoptosis The MAPK-based molecular mechanism showed a rise in a key prosurvival kinase, ERK1/ERK2 and suppression of JNK and p38 proteins. The aforementioned beneficial findings of fisetin were reversed on the administration of a specific antagonist of PPAR-\u03b3. In conclusion, through our experiments, we have proved that fisetin protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury and the evident cardioprotection is PPAR-\u03b3 dependant. In conclusion, our study has revealed a prime mechanism involved in the cardioprotective effects of fisetin. Hence, Fisetin may be evaluated in further clinical studies as a cardioprotective agent in patients undergoing reperfusion interventions.", "journal": "Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2020-09-15", "authors": ["ShankyGarg", "Sana IrfanKhan", "Rajiv KumarMalhotra", "Manish KumarSharma", "ManojKumar", "PunitKaur", "Tapas ChandraNag", "NoneRumaRay", "JagritiBhatia", "Dharamvir SinghArya"], "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2020.108572"}

The interaction between mitochondria and sarcomere directly affect cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction and is also involved in mechano-transduction through the cytoskeletal proteins that tether together the mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

This study was conducted to use scanned proton beams for ablation of cardiac tissue, investigate electrophysiological outcomes, and characterize the process of lesion formation in a porcine model using particle therapy.\nTwenty-five animals received scanned proton beam irradiation. ECG-gated computed tomography scans were acquired at end-expiration breath hold. Structures (atrioventricular junction or left ventricular myocardium) and organs at risk were contoured. Doses of 30, 40, and 55 Gy were delivered during expiration to the atrioventricular junction (n=5) and left ventricular myocardium (n=20) of intact animals.\nIn this study, procedural success was tracked by pacemaker interrogation in the atrioventricular junction group, time-course magnetic resonance imaging in the left ventricular group, and correlation of lesion outcomes displayed in gross and microscopic pathology. Protein extraction (active caspase-3) was performed to investigate tissue apoptosis. Doses of 40 and 55 Gy caused slowing and interruption of cardiac impulse propagation at the atrioventricular junction. In 40 left ventricular irradiated targets, all lesions were identified on magnetic resonance after 12 weeks, being consistent with outcomes from gross pathology.

Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) non-diabetic rats were used as controls. LETO rats were divided into 3 groups: a high fat diet (HFD) group with a 22% increase in caloric intake, a CR group, and a group fed AL. At 40\u00a0weeks of age, the telomere length was significantly shorter in the heart tissue of HFD rats but was not altered by CR in experimental rats with or without CR, however, telomerase activity in both strains of CR rats was significantly elevated. Protein expression of IGF-1, Sirt 1 and phospho-FoxO1 was increased in both CR groups. Echocardiography showed that CR preserved LV diastolic function with a significantly shorter E-wave deceleration time and a greater E/A ratio compared with the AL groups. These findings suggest that CR protocol increased telomerase activity without changing of telomere length, enhanced autophagy and improved LV diastolic function in animal model of diabetes rats.

A total of 36 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a normal group (n=12), a model group (n=12) and an miR-195 antagomir group (n=12). In the normal group, the heart was exposed only, and normal saline was intraperitoneally injected after operation. In the model group, the acute MI model was established. In the miR-195 antagomir group, the acute MI model was also established, and miR- 195 antagomir was intraperitoneally injected. The samples were collected at 2 weeks after surgery. Then cardiac function was detected via echocardiography, and the morphology of heart tissues was observed via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Moreover, the expression of Collagen I was determined using immunohistochemistry, the protein expressions of TGF-\u03b21, Smad3 and Smad7 were detected using Western blotting, and the expression of miR-195 was detected via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). It was found by echocardiography that, compared with those in the normal group, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) significantly declined, while left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDd) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVDs) significantly rose in the other two groups (P<0.05). In comparison with the model group, the miR-195 antagomir group had significantly increased LVEF and LVFS, and significantly decreased LVDd and LVDs (P<0.05). The immunohistochemistry results showed that the mean optical density of tissues with positively expressed Collagen I was obviously higher in the other two groups than that in the normal group (P<0.05), while it was obviously lower in the miR-195 antagomir group than that in the model group (P<0.05). According to the results of Western blotting, the protein expressions of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad3 were evidently increased, while the protein expression of Smad7 was evidently decreased in the other two groups compared with those in the normal group (P<0.05).

The aim of this preliminary study is to assess the feasibility of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) photon and proton therapy (PT) plans for the treatment of VT, adopting robust optimization technique for both irradiation techniques.\nECG gated CT images (in breath hold) were acquired for one patient. Conventional planning target volume (PTV) and robust optimized plans (25GyE in single fraction) were simulated for both photon (IMRT, 5 and 9 beams) and proton (SFO, 2 beams) plans. Robust optimized plans were obtained both for protons and photons considering in the optimization setup errors (5\u00a0mm in the three orthogonal directions), range (\u00b13.5%) and the clinical target volume (CTV) motion due to heartbeat and breath-hold variability.\nThe photon robust optimization method, compared to PTV-based plans, showed a reduction in the average dose to the heart by about 25%; robust optimization allowed also reducing the mean dose to the left lung from 3.4. to 2.8\u00a0Gy for 9-beams configuration and from 4.1 to 2.9\u00a0Gy for 5-beams configuration. Robust optimization with protons, allowed further reducing the OAR doses: average dose to the heart and to the left lung decreased from 7.3\u00a0Gy to 5.2 GyE and from 2.9\u00a0Gy to 2.2 GyE, respectively.\nOur study demonstrates the importance of the optimization technique adopted in the treatment planning system for VT treatment.

Previous studies have found that microRNAs play an important role in regulating sepsis-induced myocardial depression. miR-150-5p is involved in many biological processes; however, the mechanism underlying its role in sepsis-induced myocardial depression is still unclear. In this study, we generated rat models of septic shock induced by lipopolysaccharide. Whole genomic RNA sequencing was performed on 12 left ventricles collected after LPS treatment to identify miRNAs. Most of the target genes of the differently expressed microRNAs were involved in apoptosis, according to Gene Ontology. We also observed apoptosis in the heart tissue and in H9C2 cardiomyocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, indicating that cell apoptosis may be an important mechanism in sepsis-induced myocardial depression. Furthermore, the expression of miR-150-5p was reduced, and overexpression of miR-150-5p with mimics resulted in a decrease in apoptosis, decreased expression of cleaved caspase3 and Bax, and increased expression of Bcl-2. Additionally, after H9C2 cells were transfected with miR-150-5p mimics or an inhibitor, the expression of Akt2 decreased or increased, respectively. These findings suggest that miR-150-5p can alleviate apoptosis and may be a novel therapeutic target for sepsis-induced myocardial depression.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2020-09-11", "authors": ["Xiao GengZhu", "Tie NingZhang", "RiWen", "Chun FengLiu"], "doi": "10.1155/2020/3023186\n10.1001/jama.2016.0287\n10.1159/000487126\n10.1007/s00134-006-0142-5\n10.1097/CCM.0B013E31816596BC\n10.1164/rccm.201412-2323OC\n10.3892/etm.2018.7116\n10.1038/nrg2843\n10.1093/infdis/jiw449\n10.1007/s10753-019-01060-8\n10.4161/viru.26083\n10.1002/jcb.27955\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.07.020\n10.1261/rna.5248604\n10.1038/ng2135\n10.7717/peerj.5721\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000002851\n10.1097/MCC.0000000000000507\n10.1155/2017/8326749\n10.26355/eurrev_201805_14993\n10.3892/etm.2019.7657\n10.1016/j.intimp.2017.11.038\n10.4049/jimmunol.1801008\n10.1002/jcb.27108\n10.3390/ijms18030565\n10.1074/jbc.M513087200\n10.1007/s00246-010-9879-2\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.09.015\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000001613\n10.1007/s00395-015-0526-1\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.11.077\n10.1155/2019/7832376\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.04.020\n10.1093/infdis/jix138\n10.1126/science.292.5522.1728"}

Our previous study demonstrated that a traditional Chinese medicine formula, Qiang-Xin 1 (QX1), ameliorates cardiac tissue damage in septic mice; however, the underlying pharmacology mechanism remains to be elucidated. The present study was aimed at clarifying the protective mechanism of the QX1 formula on sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. The moderate sepsis model of mice was established by cecal ligation and puncture surgery. Treatment with the QX1 formula improved the 7-day survival outcome, attenuated cardiac dysfunction, and ameliorated the disruption of myocardial structure in septic mice. Subsequent systems pharmacology analysis found that 63 bioactive compounds and the related 79 candidate target proteins were screened from the QX1 formula. The network analysis showed that the QX1 active components quercetin, formononetin, kaempferol, taxifolin, cryptotanshinone, and tanshinone IIA had a good binding activity with screened targets. The integrating pathway analysis indicated the calcium, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways may be involved in the protective effect of the QX1 formula on sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.

Electrospinning is an attractive fabrication method for cardiac TE scaffolds because it produces fibers that demonstrate the optimal potential for mimicking the complex structure of the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM). iPSCs theoretically offer the capacity to generate limitless numbers of CMs for use in TE hearts, however these iPSC-CMs are electrophysiologically, morphologically, mechanically, and metabolically immature compared to adult CMs. This presents a functional limitation to their use in cardiac TE, and research aiming to address this limitation is presented in this review.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-09-10", "authors": ["Taylor CookSuh", "Alaowei YAmanah", "Jessica MGluck"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering7030105\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000558\n10.1161/circulationaha.108.191259\n10.1111/ajt.15676\n10.1016/j.copbio.2011.04.004\n10.1038/s42003-018-0202-8\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1016/j.cophys.2017.08.001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1016/j.coph.2018.07.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.847731\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.042\n10.1002/adma.200701978\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.07.138\n10.1002/jbm.b.33547\n10.1016/j.msec.2006.05.019\n10.1002/term.1978\n10.1016/j.cej.2018.01.010\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2007.01.005\n10.3390/ijms15033640\n10.1163/1568562041959991\n10.1002/jbm.a.33272\n10.1080/09205063.2017.1394711\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2017.05.006\n10.1002/jbm.b.34444\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.04.002\n10.1016/b978-0-12-398358-9.00025-2\n10.2174/156802608783790893\n10.2144/000113754\n10.1038/mt.2013.59\n10.1002/stem.772\n10.1002/jcb.25912\n10.1021/bm070313n\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0452\n10.1002/jbm.a.34156\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.02.023\n10.3390/ijms19030745\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0294\n10.2217/17435889.2.6.929\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.01.098\n10.1039/C8RA08187E\n10.1007/s10965-010-9397-1\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2005.06.043\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.06.036\n10.1088/0957-4484/26/29/291002\n10.1002/anie.200805179\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.11.037\n10.1007/s40097-016-0189-y\n10.3390/ma9020073\n10.1002/pen.23704\n10.1002/adfm.201502142\n10.1155/2013/789289\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.065\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.01.052\n10.1002/jemt.23282\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.778795\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227512\n10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.52\n10.1089/scd.2014.0427\n10.1172/JCI200112131\n10.1073/pnas.1002077107\n10.3390/ijms18061173\n10.1002/term.2117\n10.1002/bit.26504\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.09.001\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0141176\n10.1155/2016/2634013\n10.1039/C7BM00323D\n10.1016/j.scr.2016.04.014\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.035\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.07.004\n10.1073/pnas.94.10.5444\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.07.012"}

In an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the left circumflex coronary artery of New Zealand White rabbits (n = 9) was occluded by ligature for 1 h, followed by reperfusion. A specific care protocol was applied before, during, and after the intervention, and the results were compared with those of a sham operated group (n = 7). After 5 weeks, programmed stimulation and high-resolution mapping were performed on isolated and perfused hearts using the Langendorff technique. The infarct size determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride inside of the area at risk (thioflavin-S) was then determined. The area at risk was similar in both groups (54.33% (experimental infarct group) vs. 58.59% (sham group), ns). The infarct size was 73.16% as a percentage of the risk area.

{"title": "Exercise training delays cardiac remodeling in a mouse model of cancer cachexia.", "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the impact of cancer cachexia and previous aerobic exercise training (AET) on cardiac function and structure in tumor bearing mice.\nColon adenocarcinoma cells 26 (CT26) were subcutaneously injected in BALB/c mice to establish robust cancer cachexia model. AET was performed on a treadmill during 45\u00a0days, 60\u00a0min/5\u00a0days per week. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac morphology was assessed by light microscopy. The protein expression levels of mitochondrial complex were analyzed by Western blotting. The mRNA levels of genes related to cardiac remodeling and autophagy were analyzed by quantitative Real-Time PCR.\nOur data confirms CT26 tumor bearing mice as a well-characterized and robust model of cancer cachexia. CT26 mice exhibited cardiac remodeling and dysfunction characterized by cardiac atrophy and impaired left ventricle ejection fraction paralleled by cardiac necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis. AET partially reversed the left ventricle ejection fraction and led to significant anti-cardiac remodeling effect associated reduced necrosis, inflammation and cardiac collagen deposition in CT26 mice. Reduced TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels, increased mitochondrial complex IV protein levels and partial recovery of BNIP3 mRNA levels in cardiac tissue were associated with the cardiac effects of AET in CT26 mice. Thus, we suggest AET as a powerful regulator of key pathways involved in cardiac tissue homeostasis in cancer cachexia.\nOur study provides a robust model of cancer cachexia, as well as highlights the potential and integrative effects of AET as a preventive strategy for reducing cardiac damage in cancer cachexia.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2020-09-09", "authors": ["L GFernandes", "G CTobias", "A OPaix\u00e3o", "P MDourado", "V AVoltarelli", "P CBrum"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118392"}

Both Mel and BDM inhibited the formation of contraction bands in the isolated hearts with IR injury.\nMel can alleviate myocardial IR injury in isolated rat hearts by inhibiting cardiac contracture, the mechanism of which may involve the upregulation of ATP in the cardiac myocytes to lessen the tear of membrane and reduce cell content leakage.\n\u63a2\u8ba8\u892a\u9ed1\u7d20\uff08Mel\uff09\u6291\u5236\u631b\u7f29\u6539\u5584\u5927\u9f20\u79bb\u4f53\u5fc3\u810f\u7f3a\u8840\u518d\u704c\u6ce8\uff08IR\uff09\u635f\u4f24\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u673a\u5236\u3002\n\u91c7\u7528Langendorff\u79bb\u4f53\u5fc3\u810f\u704c\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u7f3a\u8840\u518d\u704c\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c40\u53eaSD\u5927\u9f20\u6309\u968f\u673a\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a4\u7ec4\uff0810\u53ea/\u7ec4\uff09\u3002\u6b63\u5e38\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08Control\uff09\uff1a\u6b63\u5e38\u704c\u6ce8175 min\uff1bIR\u7ec4\uff1a\u5168\u5fc3\u7f3a\u884045 min\uff0c\u518d\u704c\u6ce8120 min\uff1bMel+IR\u7ec4\uff1a\u7528Mel\uff085 \u03bcmol/L\uff09\u704c\u6ce81 min\uff0c\u5168\u5fc3\u7f3a\u884045 min\uff0c\u7528Mel\uff085 \u03bcmol/L\uff09\u518d\u704c\u6ce85 min\uff0cKrebs-Henseleit\u6db2\u518d\u704c\u6ce8115 min\uff1b\u631b\u7f29\u6291\u5236\u52422, 3-\u4e01\u4e8c\u916e\u5355\u809f\uff08BDM\uff09\u5e72\u9884\u7f3a\u8840\u518d\u704c\u6ce8\u7ec4\uff08BDM+IR\uff09\uff1a\u7528BDM\uff0820 mmol/L\uff09\u704c\u6ce81 min\uff0c\u5168\u5fc3\u7f3a\u884045 min\uff0c\u7528BDM\uff0820 mmol/L\uff09\u518d\u704c\u6ce85 min\uff0cKH\u6db2\u518d\u704c\u6ce8115 min\u3002\u4ee5\u5fc3\u808c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u9762\u79ef\u3001caspase-3\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u8272\u7d20c\uff08cytochrome c\uff09\u548ccleaved caspase-3\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\u5404\u7ec4\u5fc3\u808c\u635f\u4f24\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u4ee5HE\u67d3\u8272\u3001\u51a0\u8109\u6d41\u51fa\u6db2\u4e2d\u4e73\u9178\u8131\u6c22\u9176\uff08LDH\uff09\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u808c\u9499\u86cb\u767d\uff08I cTnI\uff09\u542b\u91cf\u3001\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u8212\u5f20\u672b\u538b\uff08LVEDP\uff09\u548c\u7535\u955c\u89c2\u5bdf\u808c\u539f\u7ea4\u7ef4\u6536\u7f29\u5e26\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5404\u7ec4\u5fc3\u810f\u631b\u7f29\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2dATP\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n\u4e0eControl\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cIR\u7ec4\u5fc3\u808c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u9762\u79ef\u3001caspase-3\u6d3b\u6027\u3001cytochrome c\u548ccleaved caspase-3\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff08\nMel\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u631b\u7f29\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584\u5fc3\u808c\u7f3a\u8840\u518d\u704c\u6ce8\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u5176\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u589e\u52a0\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec6\u80de\u5185ATP\u542b\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5fc3\u808c\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u635f\u4f24\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u808c\u819c\u6495\u88c2\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ec6\u80de\u5185\u5bb9\u7269\u7684\u6f0f\u51fa\u6709\u5173\u3002", "journal": "Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University", "date": "2020-09-09", "authors": ["LinghengKong", "NaSun", "LanlanWei", "LijunZhang", "YulongChen", "LiChang", "XingliSu"], "doi": "10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.07.07\n10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2017.10.009\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.032\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302744\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.01.024\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305348\n10.3969/j.issn.1673-4254.2016.05.007\n10.1113/EP085063\n10.2174/1570159X14666161228122115\n10.1016/j.arr.2016.11.007\n10.1111/jpi.12490\n10.1111/jpi.12433\n10.1111/jpi.12371\n10.1007/s00018-017-2618-6\n10.1111/jpi.12299\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.07.007\n10.1111/jpi.12070\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.11.025\n10.3892/ijmm.2016.2737\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309538\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304495\n10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.11.011\n10.14814/phy2.12606\n10.1161/01.CIR.85.3.1160\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01025-5\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.07.128"}
{"title": "Ryanodine Receptor Type 2: A Molecular Target for Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane- and Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene-Mediated Cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE) are ubiquitously found in the environment and linked to cardiovascular diseases-with a majority of the work focused on hypertension. Studies investigating whether DDx can interact with molecular targets on cardiac tissue to directly affect cardiac function are lacking. Therefore, we investigated whether o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDE, or p,p'-DDE (DDx, collectively) can directly alter the function of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) by assessing their effect(s) on hiPSC-CMs Ca2+ dynamics. DDx (0.1-10\u2009\u00b5M) affected hiPSC-CMs synchronous Ca2+ oscillation frequency in a concentration-dependent manner, with p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE also decreasing Ca2+ stores. HEK-RyR2 cells cultured under antibiotic selection to induce expression of wild-type mouse ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) are used to further investigate whether DDx alters hiPSC-CMs Ca2+ dynamics through engagement with RyR2, a protein critical for cardiac muscle excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). Acute treatment with 10\u2009\u00b5M DDx failed to induce Ca2+ release in HEK293-RyR2, whereas pretreatment with DDx (0.1-10\u2009\u00b5M) for 12- or 24-h significantly decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores in HEK-RyR2 cells challenged with caffeine (1\u2009mM), an RyR agonist. [3H]ryanodine-binding analysis using murine cardiac RyR2 homogenates further confirmed that all DDx isomers (10\u2009\u00b5M) can directly engage with RyR2 to favor an open (leaky) confirmation, whereas only the DDT isomers (10\u2009\u00b5M) modestly (\u226410%) inhibited SERCA2a activity. The data demonstrate that DDx increases heart rate and depletes Ca2+ stores in human cardiomyocytes through a mechanism that impairs RyR2 function and Ca2+ dynamics.\nDDT/DDE interactions with RyR2 alter cardiomyocyte Ca2+ dynamics that may contribute to adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with exposures.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2020-09-08", "authors": ["Kim MTruong", "WeiFeng", "Isaac NPessah"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfaa139"}
{"title": "ANO1 relieves pressure overload-induced myocardial fibrosis in mice by inhibiting TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to measure the expression of anoctamin 1 (ANO1) in myocardial tissues of mice with pressure overload-induced myocardial fibrosis, and to further investigate the effect of ANO1 on myocardial fibrosis in mice and its mechanism.\nA total of 40 male C57/B6 mice aged 6-8 weeks old were divided into 2 groups using a random number table, namely sham operation group (Sham group, n=20) and thoracic aortic constriction group (TAC group, n=20). Meanwhile, 20 ANO1 transgenic (TG) mice aged 6-8 weeks old were enrolled for TAC as TAC + ANO1 TG group. At 8 weeks after TAC, ejection fraction (EF%) and fraction shortening (FS%) in each group of mice were detected via echocardiography. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining assays were conducted to measure the protein expression of ANO1 in myocardial tissues of mice in each group. The pathological changes in myocardial tissues of mice were evaluated through hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed to measure the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of hypertrophy markers atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in myocardial tissues of mice in each group. The deposition of collagen fibers in heart tissues was determined by Masson staining assay. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining assay was carried out to detect the apoptosis of myocardial cells and fibroblasts in heart tissues. Additionally, the protein expressions of oxidative stress markers superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in myocardial tissues were detected as well. Finally, Western blotting was employed to detect the effect of ANO1 overexpression on the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/Smad3 signaling pathway-related proteins in myocardial tissues of mice.\nAt 8 weeks after TAC, ANO1 expression was overtly reduced in myocardial tissues of mice (p<0.05). Echocardiographic results showed that ANO1 overexpression significantly alleviated TAC-induced cardiac function deterioration in mice (p<0.05). The mRNA expression levels of ANP and BNP in myocardial tissues of TAC + ANO1 TG group were evidently lower than those in TAC group (p<0.05). Meanwhile, myocardial interstitial collagen deposition was significantly ameliorated in TAC + ANO1 TG group compared with TAC group (p<0.05). ANO1 overexpression notably mitigated the apoptosis of myocardial cells and oxidative stress in mice with cardiac pressure overload (p<0.05). Western blotting results further indicated that after overexpression of ANO1, the protein levels of TGF-\u03b2 and phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) were significantly inhibited in mice undergoing TAC (p<0.05).\nIn the case of cardiac pressure overload in mice, ANO1 is lowly expressed in myocardial tissues. Meanwhile, its overexpression is able to attenuate pressure overload-induced myocardial fibrosis in mice by repressing the TGF-\u03b2/smad3 signaling pathway. All our findings indicate that ANO1 can serve as a potential gene target for the treatment of myocardial fibrosis in the future.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2020-09-08", "authors": ["J-CKong", "W-QMiao", "YWang", "S-FZhou"], "doi": "10.26355/eurrev_202008_22646"}
{"title": "Development of a bioreactor system for pre-endothelialized cardiac patch generation with enhanced viscoelastic properties by combined collagen I compression and stromal cell culture.", "abstract": "Treatment of terminal heart failure still poses a significant clinical problem. Cardiac tissue engineering could offer autologous solutions for the replacement of nonfunctional myocardial tissue. So far, soft matrix construction and missing large-scale prevascularization prevented the application of sizeable cardiac repair patches. We developed a novel bioreactor system for semi-automatic compression of a collagen I hydrogel applying 16 times higher pressure than in previous studies. Resistance towards compression stress was investigated for multiple cardiac-related cell types. For scaffold prevascuarization, a tubular cavity was imprinted during the compaction process. Primary cardiac-derived endothelial cells (ECs) were isolated from human left atrial appendages (HLAAs) and characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunocytology. EC were then seeded into the preformed channel with dermal fibroblasts as interstitial cell component of the fully cellularized patch. After 8 days of constant perfusion culture within the same bioreactor, scaffold dynamic modulus and cell viability were analyzed. Endothelial proliferation and vessel maturation were examined by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. Our design allowed for scaffold production and dynamic culture in a one-stop-shop model. Enhanced compression and cell-mediated matrix remodeling induced a significant increase in scaffold stiffness while ensuring excellent cell survival. For the first time, we could isolate HLAA-derived EC with proliferative potential. ECs within the central channel proliferated during flow culture, continuously expressing endothelial markers (CD31) and displaying basal membrane synthesis (collagen IV, ultrastructural analysis). After 7 days of culture, a complete endothelial monolayer could be observed. Covering cells aligned themselves in flow direction and developed mature cell-cell contacts.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2020-09-08", "authors": ["CarolinKrziminski", "SebastianKammann", "JanHansmann", "FrankEdenhofer", "GudrunDandekar", "HeikeWalles", "MarcusLeistner"], "doi": "10.1002/term.3129"}

An automated image processing was developed to identify individual myofibrils and extract data about their organization. We observed a structural aging-dependent remodeling in mdx cardiomyocytes affecting sarcomere sinuosity, orientation and length that could not be anticipated from standard optical imaging.

{"title": "Beyond genomics-technological advances improving the molecular characterization and precision treatment of heart failure.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. In the past 20\u00a0years, there has been an overwhelming focus on developing therapeutics that target common downstream disease pathways thought to be involved in all forms of heart failure independent of the initial etiology. While this strategy is effective at the population level, individual responses vary tremendously and only approximately one third of patients receive benefit from modern heart failure treatments. In this perspective, we propose that DCM should be considered as a collection of diseases with a common phenotype of left ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction rather than a single disease entity, and that mechanism-based classification of disease subtypes will revolutionize our understanding and clinical approach towards DCM. We discuss how these efforts are central to realizing the potential of precision medicine and how they are empowered by the development of new tools that allow investigators to strategically employ genomic and transcriptomic information. Finally, we outline an investigational strategy to (1) define DCM at the patient level, (2) develop new tools to model and mechanistically dissect subtypes of human heart failure, and (3) harness these insights for the development of precision therapeutics.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2020-09-05", "authors": ["Kory JLavine", "Michael JGreenberg"], "doi": "10.1007/s10741-020-10021-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001878\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001879\n10.7326/0003-4819-152-6-201006010-01006\n10.7326/0003-4819-152-11-201006010-01006\n10.1001/jama.296.15.1867\n10.1001/jama.298.10.1171\n10.1056/NEJM199605233342101\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.059\n10.1172/jci.insight.94382\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.11.059\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.878\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309396\n10.1172/JCI62862\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.033200\n10.1093/cvr/cvy083\n10.1186/s13073-017-0410-8\n10.3390/genes5010214\n10.1038/s41467-019-13690-5\n10.1146/annurev-med-041717-085853\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.06.022\n10.1073/pnas.1910962116\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.001938\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.10.011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00571.2005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.106.146670\n10.1016/j.hfc.2017.12.002\n10.1529/biophysj.107.107557\n10.1007/s11897-017-0351-y\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003863\n10.1126/science.aav8130\n10.1126/science.aat5031\n10.1038/s41467-018-07582-3\n10.1126/science.aax6648\n10.1126/science.aaf2403\n10.1038/s41598-019-53899-4\n10.1073/pnas.90.9.3993\n10.1074/jbc.M113.450668\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.07.018\n10.1074/jbc.M800554200\n10.1007/s12471-016-0815-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.039\n10.1007/s00018-012-0927-3\n10.1126/sciadv.1500511\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1172/JCI12131\n10.1126/science.1225829\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001\n10.1152/physrev.00036.2015\n10.1038/nm.3225\n10.3389/fphys.2017.01111\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307580\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1096/fasebj.14.5.669\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.016\n10.1089/ten.a.2007.0092\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.12.052\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.11.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310363\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003552\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314505\n10.1038/s41467-019-12354-8\n10.1161/HCG.0000000000000043\n10.1038/s41586-019-1406-x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0213768\n10.1038/ncomms7955\n10.1038/srep22788\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.055\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032273\n10.1096/fasebj.11.8.9240969\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00120\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1073/pnas.0900174106\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0341\n10.1038/srep24726\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2019.0118\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0347\n10.1177/1087057110388269\n10.1038/s41598-019-54665-2\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.12.007\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01568\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf2584\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001883\n10.1038/s41467-018-06193-2\n10.1126/science.1200113\n10.1126/science.aad3456\n10.1038/nature23305\n10.15252/emmm.201505047\n10.1073/pnas.022628899"}

The aim of this study is to explore the protective efficacy of piperine supplementation against the inflammatory response in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MI. Masson Trichome staining was executed to determine myocardial tissue architecture. Immunohistochemistry was performed for IL-6, TNF-\u03b1. RT-PCR studies were performed to ascertain the gene expression of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, eNOS, MMP-2, MMP-9, and collagen-III. Western blotting was performed to determine expression of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, Nrf-2, NF-\u0199B, Cox-2, p-38, phospho-p38, ERK-1/2, phospho-ERK-1/2, and collagen-I. HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, and iNOS expression were significantly upregulated with concomitant decline in eNOS expression in the heart myocardial tissue of rats received ISO alone whereas piperine pretreatment prevented these changes in ISO administered rats. Current results revealed ROS-mediated activation of MAPKs, namely, p-p38, p-ERK1/2 in the heart tissue of ISO administered group. Piperine pretreatment significantly prevented these changes in ISO treated group. NF-\u03baB is involved in the modulation of gene expressions responsible for tissue repair. ISO-induced NF-\u03baB-p65 expression was significantly reduced in the group pretreated with piperine and mitigated extent of myocardial inflammation. A significant increase in cardiac fibrosis upon ISO treatment was reported due to the increased hydroxyproline content, MMP-2 & 9 and upregulation of collagen-I protein compared to control group.

Recently, we developed functional human and pig heart slice biomimetic culture systems that preserve the viability and functionality of 300\u00a0\u03bcm heart slices for up to 6\u00a0days. Here, we tested the reliability of this culture system for testing the cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs. We tested three anti-cancer drugs (doxorubicin, trastuzumab, and sunitinib) with known different mechanisms of cardiotoxicity at three concentrations and assessed the effect of these drugs on heart slice viability, structure, function and gene expression. Slices incubated with any of these drugs for 48\u00a0h showed diminished in viability as well as loss of cardiomyocyte structure and function. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing of doxorubicin-treated tissues demonstrated a significant downregulation of cardiac genes and upregulation of oxidative stress responses. Trastuzumab treatment downregulated cardiac muscle contraction-related genes consistent with its clinically known effect on cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, sunitinib treatment resulted in significant downregulation of angiogenesis-related genes, in line with its mechanism of action. Similar to hiPS-derived-cardiomyocytes, heart slices recapitulated the expected toxicity of doxorubicin and trastuzumab, however, slices were superior in detecting sunitinib cardiotoxicity and mechanism in the clinically relevant concentration range of 0.1-1\u00a0\u03bcM.

{"title": "Me2SO perfusion time for whole-organ cryopreservation can be shortened: Results of micro-computed tomography monitoring during Me2SO perfusion of rat hearts.", "abstract": "Cryopreservation of whole organs and specific tissues is an important and continually expanding field of medicine. The protocols currently used for organ preservation do not ensure survivability and functionality; the protocols for ovarian tissue lead to acceptable outcomes, but these are still capable of further improvement. In general, cryopreservation protocols need to be optimized. One important approach to improving cryopreservation protocols in general involves reducing exposure to cytotoxic cryoprotective agents prior to freezing. This study, therefore, evaluated the real-time tissue penetration of dimethyl sulfoxide, a cryoprotective agent that is widely used in cryopreservation. Dimethyl sulfoxide penetration in rat hearts perfused with a 15% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide solution was examined in real-time using dynamic contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography imaging. Viability of cardiomyocytes was not significantly affected by the dimethyl sulfoxide perfusion procedure. Two different perfusion rates were evaluated and compared with perfusion using a common iodine-based contrast agent (iomeprol). The dynamic contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography imaging data showed that dimethyl sulfoxide flushes both the extracellular and intracellular spaces in rat heart tissue to 95% equilibration after \u2248 35 s via perfusion. Subsequent wash-out via perfusion is completed to 95% within \u2248 49 s. The equilibration duration routinely used in dimethyl sulfoxide-based protocols for cryopreservation should therefore be questioned. Shorter incubation duration would perhaps be sufficient, as well as being beneficial in relation to cell survivability. It would be helpful to have techniques for non-invasive real-time monitoring of the penetration of cryoprotective agents and such techniques should be used to revise cryopreservation protocols.

In this study, we found that miR-221-3p is highly expressed in vascular tissue, especially in endothelial cells, and increased miR-221-3p was observed in heart tissue of HF patients and transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced HF mice. To explore the role of miR-221-3p in endothelial cells, microRNA (miRNA) mimics and inhibitors were employed in vitro. Overexpression of miR-221-3p inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and cord formation in vitro, while inhibition of miR-221-3p showed the opposite effect. Anti-argonaute 2 (Ago2) coimmunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and western blotting were performed to verify the target of miR-221-3p. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) was identified as a miR-221-3p target, and the adverse effects of miR-221-3p on endothelial cells were alleviated by HIF-1\u03b1 re-expression. In vivo, a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia (HLI) was developed to demonstrate the effect of miR-221-3p on angiogenesis. AntagomiR-221-3p increased HIF-1\u03b1 expression and promoted angiogenesis in mouse ischemic hindlimbs. Using the TAC model, we clarified that antagomiR-221-3p improved cardiac function in HF mice by promoting cardiac angiogenesis. Furthermore, serum miR-221-3p was detected to be negatively correlated with heart function in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Our results conclude that miR-221-3p inhibits angiogenesis of endothelial cells by targeting HIF-1\u03b1 and that inhibition of miR-221-3p improves cardiac function of TAC-induced HF mice.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that this pacing-induced alternans can be prevented by performing constant diastolic interval (DI) pacing, in which DI is independent of APD. However, constant DI pacing is difficult to implement in experimental settings since it requires the real-time measurement of APD. A more practical way was proposed based on electrocardiograms (ECGs), which give an indirect measure of the global DI relaxation period through the TR interval assessment. Previously, we demonstrated that constant TR pacing prevented alternans formation in isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. However, the efficacy of \"local\" constant DI pacing vs \"global\" constant TR pacing in preventing alternans formation has never been investigated. Thus, the purpose of this study was to implement an ECG-based constant TR pacing in a 1D numerical model of human ventricular tissue and to compare the dynamical behavior of cardiac tissue with that resulted from a constant DI pacing. The results showed that both constant TR and constant DI pacing prevented the onset of alternans until lower basic cycle length when compared to periodic pacing. For longer cable lengths, constant TR pacing was shown to exhibit greater control on alternans than constant DI pacing.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2020-09-03", "authors": ["SanketThakare", "JosephMathew", "SharonZlochiver", "XiaopengZhao", "Elena GTolkacheva"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0005432"}
{"title": "Role of sialidase Neu3 and ganglioside GM3 in cardiac fibroblasts activation.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a key physiological response to cardiac tissue injury to protect the heart from wall rupture. However, its progression increases heart stiffness, eventually causing a decrease in heart contractility. Unfortunately, to date, no efficient antifibrotic therapies are available to the clinic. This is primarily due to the complexity of the process, which involves several cell types and signaling pathways. For instance, the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway has been recognized to be vital for myofibroblasts activation and fibrosis progression. In this context, complex sphingolipids, such as ganglioside GM3, have been shown to be directly involved in TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1 (TGF-R1) activation. In this work, we report that an induced up-regulation of sialidase Neu3, a glycohydrolytic enzyme involved in ganglioside cell homeostasis, can significantly reduce cardiac fibrosis in primary cultures of human cardiac fibroblasts by inhibiting the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, ultimately decreasing collagen I deposition. These results support the notion that modulating ganglioside GM3 cell content could represent a novel therapeutic approach for cardiac fibrosis, warranting for further investigations.", "journal": "The Biochemical journal", "date": "2020-09-02", "authors": ["AndreaGhiroldi", "MarcoPiccoli", "PasqualeCreo", "FedericaCirillo", "PaolaRota", "SaraD'Imperio", "GiuseppeCiconte", "Michelle MMonasky", "EmanueleMicaglio", "AndreaGaratti", "MassimoAureli", "Emma VeronicaCarsana", "LorenzoMenicanti", "CarloPappone", "LuigiAnastasia"], "doi": "10.1042/BCJ20200360"}
{"title": "A Potential Role for Excess Tissue Iron in Development of Cardiovascular Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure.", "abstract": "Murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of total body radiation (TBI) have a significant loss of heart vessel endothelial cells, along with increased tissue iron, as early as 4 mo post-TBI. The goal of the current study was to determine the possible role for excess tissue iron in the loss of coronary artery endothelial cells. Experiments used the H-ARS mouse model with gamma radiation exposure of 853 cGy (LD50/30) and time points from 1 to 12 wk post-TBI. Serum iron was elevated at 1 wk post-TBI, peaked at 2 wk post-TBI, and returned to non-irradiated control values by 4 wk post-TBI. A similar trend was seen for transferrin saturation, and both results correlated inversely with red blood cell number. Perls' Prussian Blue staining, used to detect iron deposition in heart tissue sections, showed myocardial iron was present as early as 2 wk following irradiation. Pretreatment of mice with the iron chelator deferiprone decreased tissue iron but not serum iron at 2 wk. Coronary artery endothelial cell density was significantly decreased as early as 2 wk vs. non-irradiated controls (P<0.05), and the reduced density persisted to 12 wk after irradiation. Deferiprone treatment of irradiated mice prevented the decrease in endothelial cell density at 2 and 4 wk post-TBI compared to irradiated, non-treated mice (P<0.03).

{"title": "Ectonucleotidases from trypomastigotes from different sources and various genetic backgrounds of Trypanosoma cruzi potentiate their infectivity and host inflammation.", "abstract": "Distinct populations of Trypanosoma cruzi interact with mammalian cardiac muscle cells causing different inflammation patterns and low heart functionality. During T. cruzi infection, the extracellular ATP is hydrolyzed to tri- and/or diphosphate nucleotides, based on the infectivity, virulence, and regulation of the inflammatory response. T. cruzi carries out this hydrolysis through the T. cruzi ectonucleotidase, NTPDase-1 (TcNTPDase-1). This study aimed to evaluate the role of TcNTPDase-1 in culture rich in metacyclic trypomastigote forms (MT) and cell culture-derived trypomastigote forms (CT) from Colombiana (discrete typing unit - DTU I), VL-10 (DTU II), and CL (DTU VI) strains of T. cruzi. For this, we measured TcNTPDase-1 activity in suramin-treated and untreated parasites and infected J774 cells and C57BL/6 mice with suramin pre-treated parasites to assess parasitic and inflammatory cardiac profile in the acute phase of infection. Our data indicated a higher TcNTPDase-1 activity for ATP in culture rich in metacyclic trypomastigote forms from Colombiana strain in comparison to those from VL-10 and CL strains. The cell culture-derived trypomastigote forms from CL strain presented higher capacity to hydrolyze ATP than those from Colombiana and VL-10 strains. Suramin inhibited ATP hydrolysis in all studied parasite forms and strains. Suramin pre-treated parasites reduced J774 cell infection and increased nitrite production in vitro. In vivo studies showed a reduction of inflammatory infiltrate in the cardiac tissues of animals infected with cell culture-derived trypomastigote forms from suramin pre-treated Colombiana strain.

{"title": "Sex-Specific Programming of Cardiac DNA Methylation by Developmental Phthalate Exposure.", "abstract": "Phthalate plasticizers are ubiquitous chemicals linked to several cardiovascular diseases in animal models and humans. Despite this, the mechanisms by which phthalate exposures cause adverse cardiac health outcomes are unclear. In particular, whether phthalate exposures during pregnancy interfere with normal developmental programming of the cardiovascular system, and the resulting implications this may have for long-term disease risk, are unknown. Recent studies suggest that the effects of phthalates on metabolic and neurobehavioral outcomes are sex-specific. However, the influence of sex on cardiac susceptibility to phthalate exposures has not been investigated. One mechanism by which developmental exposures may influence long-term health is through altered programming of DNA methylation. In this work, we utilized an established mouse model of human-relevant perinatal exposure and enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to investigate the long-term effects of diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) exposure on DNA methylation in the hearts of adult male and female offspring at 5\u2009months of age (n\u2009=\u20095-7 mice per sex and exposure). Perinatal DEHP exposure led to hundreds of sex-specific, differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the heart. Pathway analysis of DMCs revealed enrichment for several pathways in females, including insulin signaling, regulation of histone methylation, and tyrosine phosphatase activity. In males, DMCs were enriched for glucose transport, energy generation, and developmental programs. Notably, many sex-specific genes differentially methylated with DEHP exposure in our mouse model were also differentially methylated in published data of heart tissues collected from human heart failure patients. Together, these data highlight the potential role for DNA methylation in DEHP-induced cardiac effects and emphasize the importance of sex as a biological variable in environmental health studies.", "journal": "Epigenetics insights", "date": "2020-08-31", "authors": ["Laurie KSvoboda", "KaiWang", "Raymond GCavalcante", "KariNeier", "Justin AColacino", "Maureen ASartor", "Dana CDolinoy"], "doi": "10.1177/2516865720939971\n10.1101/783209v1\n10.1002/jcp.29386."}

{"title": "Transcriptomic study of lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis damage in a mouse heart model.", "abstract": "Sepsis is an emergency systemic illness caused by pathogen infection and the combined result of the underactivity and overactivity of a patient's own immune system. However, the molecular mechanism of this illness remains largely unknown. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected to establish a sepsis model, and heart tissue was used to analyze transcriptome changes in mice. LPS injection was used to develop a sepsis model, which resulted in cardiac tissue rearrangement and inflammatory response activation. An RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome assay using mouse heart tissue with or without LPS injection showed that 3,326 and 1,769 genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively (>2-fold changes; P<0.05). Furthermore, these differentially expressed genes were classified into 20 pathways, including 'Wnt signaling pathway', 'VEGF signaling pathway' and 'TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway', and these altered genes were enriched in 41 Gene Ontology terms. The application of Wnt3a inhibited the activation of the LPS-induced inflammatory response and activated Wnt signaling, as well as protecting against LPS-mediated cardiac tissue damage in mice. In contrast, inhibition of Wnt signaling by injection of its inhibitor IWR induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and resulted in cardiac structure derangement, which was similar to the symptoms caused by injection of LPS, suggesting that LPS-induced damage to heart tissue may be via inhibition of Wnt signaling. The present analyses showed that Wnt signaling serves a pivotal role in sepsis development and may improve our understanding of the molecular basis underlying sepsis.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2020-08-29", "authors": ["CunrongChen", "JuntingWeng", "DexiangFang", "JianfeiChen", "MinChen"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2020.9086\n10.1093/infdis/141.1.55\n10.1084/jem.86.1.29\n10.1001/jama.2016.0287\n10.1001/jama.2016.0288\n10.1007/s00134-006-0517-7\n10.1097/00003246-200107001-00035\n10.1038/nature01326\n10.1007/s11897-014-0247-z\n10.1164/ajrccm.164.3.2009052\n10.1086/421997\n10.1186/cc5783\n10.1007/s00134-008-1268-4\n10.1155/2010/985614\n10.1007/s12272-012-0901-5\n10.1186/cc11884\n10.1007/s00134-012-2613-1\n10.1016/S2213-2600(14)70290-5\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.08.043\n10.1126/sciadv.1602096\n10.2741/1304\n10.4103/2321-3868.123072\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.06.016\n10.1074/jbc.R600015200\n10.1073/pnas.96.10.5522\n10.1038/nrg1427\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.10.018\n10.1126/science.1144090\n10.1093/emboj/16.13.3797\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r36\n10.1038/nmeth.1923\n10.1038/nbt1305\n10.1177/0192623311429973\n10.1093/nar/30.1.42\n10.1093/nar/gkn863\n10.1101/gr.6202607\n10.1097/00003246-199909000-00012\n10.1053/j.jvca.2010.11.026\n10.1089/zeb.2014.0995\n10.1159/000088478\n10.1038/ng1001-117\n10.1093/cvr/cvu263\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148252"}

The toxic effects of high-content insecticidal pyrethroid formulations are available in 0.05 g, 1.17 g, and 0.04 g pyrethroid-instilled products, namely burning coils, pyrethroid-soaked mats, and liquid formulations of pyrethroids that release pyrethroid vapor/smoke upon heating. They provided 5.46 g/kg, 21.15 g/kg, and 4.24 g/kg of toxicants to the experimental animals over a total of 3 weeks/5 h per os (p.o.) administration, producing necrosis, hyperemia, and fatty changes in the liver; fiber separation in cardiac muscles; atrophy, lymphatic infiltration, blood vessel congestion, and hyperemia in the heart tissues of the experimental animals. The glomerular tuft necrosis, cytoplasmic degeneration of renal tubular cells, necrotic tubules, congestion, and dilatation of blood vessels were observed in the kidney tissue of intoxicated animals. Air-space enlargement, interstitial inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration aggregates, connective tissue infiltration by inflammatory cells, and hyperemia were found in the lung tissues. The pyrethroid toxicants also produced nervous tissue degeneration and decreased neurons in the brain, which were observed through histopathological examinations of the brain, lungs, heart, kidneys, and liver. The protective effects of ascorbic acid (AA/vitamin C) and \u03b1-tocopherol (E307/vitamin E) at 100 mg/kg oral doses administered daily for the entire period of the toxicant exposure of three weeks to the experimental mice, aged between 3-4 months and weighing \u224830 g, ameliorated the tissue damage, as observed through the histopathological examinations. The ascorbic acid caused recovery of the liver, kidney, brain, and heart tissue damage, while \u03b1-tocopherol was effective at ameliorating the damage in the kidneys and lung tissue compared with the control groups.

{"title": "The Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Properties of n-3 PUFAs: Their Role in Cardiovascular Protection.", "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids with 18, 20 or 22 carbon atoms, which have been found able to counteract cardiovascular diseases. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in particular, have been found to produce both vaso- and cardio-protective response via modulation of membrane phospholipids thereby improving cardiac mitochondrial functions and energy production. However, antioxidant properties of n-3 PUFAs, along with their anti-inflammatory effect in both blood vessels and cardiac cells, seem to exert beneficial effects in cardiovascular impairment. In fact, dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs has been demonstrated to reduce oxidative stress-related mitochondrial dysfunction and endothelial cell apoptosis, an effect occurring via an increased activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. On the other hand, n-3 PUFAs have been shown to counteract the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both vascular tissues and in the myocardium, thereby restoring vascular reactivity and myocardial performance. Here we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 PUFAs in vascular and cardiac tissues and their implication in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2020-08-29", "authors": ["FrancescaOppedisano", "RobertaMacr\u00ec", "MicaelaGliozzi", "VincenzoMusolino", "CristinaCarresi", "JessicaMaiuolo", "FrancescaBosco", "SaverioNucera", "MariaCaterina Zito", "LorenzaGuarnieri", "FedericaScarano", "CaterinaNicita", "Anna RitaCoppoletta", "StefanoRuga", "MiriamScicchitano", "RoccoMollace", "ErnestoPalma", "VincenzoMollace"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines8090306\n10.21037/cdt.2017.03.20\n10.1007/s40292-019-00309-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.04.007\n10.1177/1074248407313821\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000482\n10.1001/jamacardio.2017.5205\n10.1007/s11010-017-3104-z\n10.3390/ijms21072618\n10.3390/nu10101561\n10.3390/nu8010023\n10.1007/s12013-014-0407-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.015176\n10.3945/an.114.006981\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.12.003\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.12.004\n10.1080/10408398.2015.1126549\n10.1124/pr.57.2.1\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.06.038\n10.1194/jlr.M026179\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2016.12.004\n10.1186/s12974-018-1232-3\n10.1007/s10557-013-6457-x\n10.1007/s10974-016-9459-z\n10.1016/j.vph.2016.01.005\n10.2459/01.JCM.0000289279.95427.e2\n10.20455/ros.2019.865\n10.1042/CS20110663\n10.3390/md13020838\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.06.063\n10.1017/S0007114512001584\n10.1146/annurev.ph.57.030195.003513\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.1991.tb01383.x\n10.2337/dc09-S330\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.05.035\n10.3390/ijms20133294\n10.3390/ijms20123022\n10.1016/j.biochi.2006.10.009\n10.1016/j.plefa.2006.11.005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035508\n10.1155/2015/791978\n10.1186/s12974-015-0304-x\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2015.08.002\n10.1016/j.dsx.2016.06.024\n10.3390/jcm5030032\n10.1016/j.plipres.2010.01.002\n10.3389/fcvm.2015.00038\n10.1371/journal.pone\n10.3389/fimmu.2012.00298\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2017.01.018\n10.1038/nature13479\n10.1016/j.drudis.2014.06.023\n10.1016/j.cmet.2013.10.006\n10.1128/IAI.02444-14\n10.1152/ajpheart.01057.2009\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.04.003\n10.4049/jimmunol.177.9.5902\n10.1194/jlr.M047357\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.010\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00211.x\n10.1016/j.phanu.2015.11.003\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.215848\n10.1016/j.numecd.2016.07.011\n10.1152/physrev.00003.2017\n10.1016/j.vph.2017.02.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0192484\n10.3390/nu9121289\n10.1016/j.coph.2020.04.009\n10.1096/fj.201802445R\n10.3390/nu11102279\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2007.07.023\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.05.001\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.002\n10.3109/10715762.2010.485992\n10.1371/journal.pone.0187934\n10.1002/clc.23185\n10.1152/ajpcell.00174.2012\n10.1016/j.plefa.2010.11.004\n10.1055/s-0038-1661603\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2018.09.005\n10.1186/s12933-019-0887-0\n10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601269\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.10.056\n10.1155/2020/2342837\n10.3390/nu6020799\n10.1155/2013/712949\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2019.08.011\n10.1038/s41440-018-0102-9\n10.1038/s41598-018-19193-5\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000014682.14181.F2\n10.5551/jat.RV17013\n10.1016/j.ihj.2014.05.006\n10.1093/ajcn/86.2.324\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000709\n10.4330/wjc.v10.i9.74\n10.2217/bmm-2017-0110\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.08.020\n10.3390/nu10060775\n10.3390/cells8121651\n10.1016/j.ahj.2012.08.014\n10.1016/j.ejim.2018.06.005\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.03.005\n10.3390/nu9010018\n10.1194/jlr.M062034\n10.1007/s12013-015-0554-3\n10.1038/s41598-017-01470-4\n10.3109/09637486.2013.812619\n10.1093/ndtplus/sfr046\n10.1161/01.ATV.13.1.98\n10.1042/cs0640091\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000057393.97337.AE\n10.7762/cnr.2020.9.1.63\n10.1016/j.clnu.2017.03.027\n10.1533/9781845693114.1.3\n10.3390/nu11051067\n10.1056/NEJMoa021437\n10.1016/j.envres.2016.06.001\n10.1056/NEJMoa020157\n10.1016/j.envint.2015.11.020\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61239-8"}

{"title": "Tissue- and isoform-specific protein complex analysis with natively processed bait proteins.", "abstract": "Protein-protein interaction analysis is an important tool to elucidate the function of proteins and protein complexes as well as their dynamic behavior. To date, the analysis of tissue- or even cell- or compartment-specific protein interactions is still relying on the availability of specific antibodies suited for immunoprecipitation. Here, we aimed at establishing a method that allows identification of protein interactions and complexes from intact tissues independent of specific, high affinity antibodies used for protein pull-down and isolation. Tagged bait proteins were expressed in human HEK293T cells and residual interactors removed by SDS. The resulting tag-fusion protein was then used as bait to pull proteins from tissue samples. Tissue-specific interactions were reproducibly identified from porcine retina as well as from retinal pigment epithelium using the ciliary protein lebercilin as bait. Further, murine heart-specific interactors of two gene products of the 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase type 1 (cGK1) were investigated. Here, specific interactions were associated with the cGK1\u03b1 and \u03b2 gene products, that differ only in their unique amino-terminal region comprising about 100 aa. As such, the new protocol provides a fast and reliable method for tissue-specific protein complex analysis which is independent of the availability or suitability of antibodies for immunoprecipitation. SIGNIFICANCE: Protein-protein interaction in the functional relevant tissue is still difficult due to the dependence on specific antibodies or bait production in bacteria or insect cells. Here, the tagged protein of interest is produced in a human cell line and bound proteins are gently removed using SDS. Because applying the suitable SDS concentration is a critical step, different SDS solutions were tested to demonstrate their influence on interactions and the clean-up process. The established protocol enabled a tissue-specific analysis of the ciliary proteins lebercilin and TMEM107 using pig eyes. In addition, two gene products of the 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase type 1 showed distinct protein interactions in mouse heart tissue. With the easy, fast and cheap protocol presented here, deep insights in tissue-specific and functional relevant protein complex formation is possible.", "journal": "Journal of proteomics", "date": "2020-08-28", "authors": ["TinaBeyer", "FranziskaKlose", "AnnaKuret", "FelixHoffmann", "RobertLukowski", "MariusUeffing", "KarstenBoldt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jprot.2020.103947"}

The diastolic dysfunction contributes to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which in the aging population is more common in women. This report examines its progression over 12\u00a0weeks in aging C57BL/6J mice and correlates its development with changes in macrophage polarization and collagen deposition.Aged C57BL/6J mice were injected with dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) ligand 1 (DCSL1, an anti-inflammatory agent) or saline for 12\u00a0weeks. Echo and Doppler measurements were performed before and after 4 and 12\u00a0weeks of treatment. DCSL1 prevented the worsening of diastolic dysfunction over time in females but not in males. Cardiac single cell suspensions analyzed by flow cytometry revealed changes in the inflammatory infiltrate: (1) in males, there was an increased total number of leukocytes with an increased pro-inflammatory profile compared with females and they did not respond to DCSL1; (2) by contrast, DCSL1 treatment resulted in a shift in macrophage polarization to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in females. Notably, DCSL1 preferentially targeted tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1", "journal": "GeroScience", "date": "2020-08-28", "authors": ["JoAnnTrial", "RodrigoDiaz Lankenau", "AudeAngelini", "Jorge ETovar Perez", "George ETaffet", "Mark LEntman", "Katarzyna ACieslik"], "doi": "10.1007/s11357-020-00255-4\n10.1073/pnas.0810163105\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.116.003688\n10.18632/aging.101881\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034271\n10.1016/j.jchf.2019.01.004\n10.1056/NEJMoa051530\n10.1084/jem.174.6.1549\n10.1021/ja072944v\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.899732\n10.1186/s13075-015-0839-3\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.019\n10.1096/fj.12-220145\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.06.022\n10.1096/fj.14-268136\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0018\n10.1073/pnas.1500956112\n10.1016/s0002-9149(00)01165-6\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.09.081\n10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00663-6\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.12.004\n10.1161/01.cir.56.2.273\n10.1189/jlb.3HI1114-531R\n10.1002/ejhf.67\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303204\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043594\n10.1002/eji.201747431\n10.1016/j.it.2004.09.015\n10.1016/s0735-1097(02)02696-7\n10.1093/gerona/glv143\n10.4049/jimmunol.164.12.6166\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-022516-034339\n10.1016/j.cjca.2010.12.042\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.12.006\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.09.065\n10.1172/JCI75005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023361\n10.1016/j.jchf.2019.03.011\n10.1189/jlb.0810463\n10.1172/JCI28549\n10.1111/imcb.12310\n10.1016/j.hfc.2018.08.002\n10.3389/fimmu.2013.00287\n10.1007/s00395-017-0623-4\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.02.025\n10.1371/journal.pone.0199938\n10.1152/ajpheart.00073.2005"}
{"title": "Cells, Materials, and Fabrication Processes for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer worldwide, with myocardial infarction (MI) responsible for approximately 1 in 6 deaths. The lack of endogenous regenerative capacity, added to the deleterious remodelling programme set into motion by myocardial necrosis, turns MI into a progressively debilitating disease, which current pharmacological therapy cannot halt. The advent of Regenerative Therapies over 2 decades ago kick-started a whole new scientific field whose aim was to prevent or even reverse the pathological processes of MI. As a highly dynamic organ, the heart displays a tight association between 3D structure and function, with the non-cellular components, mainly the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM), playing both fundamental active and passive roles. Tissue engineering aims to reproduce this tissue architecture and function in order to fabricate replicas able to mimic or even substitute damaged organs. Recent advances in cell reprogramming and refinement of methods for additive manufacturing have played a critical role in the development of clinically relevant engineered cardiovascular tissues. This review focuses on the generation of human cardiac tissues for therapy, paying special attention to human pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives. We provide a perspective on progress in regenerative medicine from the early stages of cell therapy to the present day, as well as an overview of cellular processes, materials and fabrication strategies currently under investigation. Finally, we summarise current clinical applications and reflect on the most urgent needs and gaps to be filled for efficient translation to the clinical arena.", "journal": "Frontiers in

{"title": "Antianemia Drug Roxadustat (FG-4592) Protects Against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity by Targeting Antiapoptotic and Antioxidative Pathways.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is broadly used in treating various malignant tumors. However, its cardiotoxicity limits its clinical use. Roxadustat (FG-4592) is a new hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PHD) inhibitor and has been approved for treating anemia in chronic kidney diseases (CKD) patients. However, the role of FG-4592 in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remains unknown. In this study, mouse cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography, plasma LDH/CK-MB, and heart HE staining. Cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and HIF-target genes were evaluated in mouse cardiac tissue and cardiac cells exposed to DOX with FG-4592 pretreatment.

However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can affect multiple organs is still unclear. In this study, postmortem percutaneous biopsies of multiple organs from deceased patients were performed to understand the histopathological changes caused by COVID-19.\nBiopsy specimens of pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic and lymphoid tissues were obtained from three patients, who died due to COVID-19 pneumonia. H&E stain, Masson trichrome stain, immunohistochemistry stain and in-situ hybridisation were used.\nPulmonary damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). In the early phase, the histological findings were mainly those of exudative features of DAD. The later phase was characterised by organisation of DAD combined with bacterial pneumonia. No serious damage was found in the bronchiolar epithelium and submucosal glands. The hepatic tissue revealed features of ischaemic necrosis, but findings suggestive of mild lobular hepatitis were also observed. The lymphoid tissue revealed features of non-specific acute lymphadenitis. The cardiac tissue revealed changes of underlying disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were not detected in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and lymphocytes of lymph nodes.\nCOVID-19 predominantly involves the pulmonary tissue, causes DAD and aggravates the cardiovascular disease. However, other extrapulmonary tissues did not reveal any virus-specific findings, but were affected by multiple factors. The findings in this report caution the pathologists that they should not mistakenly attribute all the histological features to CoV infection.

{"title": "Mathematical modelling of the mechano-electric coupling in the human cardiomyocyte electrically connected with fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibroblasts are interspersed within mammalian cardiac tissue. Fibroblasts are mechanically passive; however, they may communicate electrically with cardiomyocytes via gap junctions and thus affect the electrical and mechanical activity of myocytes. Several in-silico studies at both cellular (0D) and ventricular (3D) levels analysed the effects of fibroblasts on the myocardial electrical function. However, none of them addressed possible effects of fibroblast-myocyte electrical coupling to cardiomyocyte mechanical activity. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for studying both electrical and mechanical responses of the human cardiomyocyte to its electrotonic interaction with cardiac fibroblasts. Our simulations have revealed that electrotonic interaction with fibroblasts affects not only the mechanical activity of the cardiomyocyte, comprising either moderate or significant reduction of contractility, but also the mechano-calcium and mechano-electric feedback loops, and all these effects are enhanced as the number of coupled fibroblasts is increased. Obtained results suggest that moderate values of the myocyte-fibroblast gap junction conductance (less than 1\u00a0nS) can be attributed to physiological conditions, contrasting to the higher values (2\u00a0nS and higher) proper rather for pathological situations (e.g. for infarct and/or border zones), since all mechanical indexes falls down dramatically in the case of such high conductance.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2020-08-28", "authors": ["AnastasiaBazhutina", "Nathalie ABalakina-Vikulova", "AlexanderKursanov", "OlgaSolovyova", "AlexanderPanfilov", "Leonid BKatsnelson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.08.003"}

Transcriptome analyses revealed RBM20 as an important regulator of cardiac alternative splicing. RBM20 mutations are especially localized in exons 9 and 11 including the highly conserved arginine and serine-rich domain (RS domain). Here, we investigated in several cardiomyopathy patients, the previously described RBM20-mutation p.Pro638Leu localized within the RS domain. In addition, we identified in a patient the novel mutation p.Val914Ala localized in the (glutamate-rich) Glu-rich domain of RBM20 encoded by exon 11. Its impact on the disease was investigated with a novel TTN- and RYR2-splicing assay based on the patients' cardiac messenger RNA. Furthermore, we showed in cell culture and in human cardiac tissue that mutant RBM20-p.Pro638Leu is not localized in the nuclei but causes an abnormal cytoplasmic localization of the protein. In contrast the splicing deficient RBM20-p.Val914Ala has no influence on the intracellular localization. These results indicate that disease-associated variants in RBM20 lead to aberrant splicing through different pathomechanisms dependent on the localization of the mutation.

{"title": "Inhibition of the long non-coding RNA NEAT1 protects cardiomyocytes from hypoxia in vitro via decreased pri-miRNA processing.", "abstract": "While restoration of coronary blood flow to the ischemic heart is the most effective strategy for reducing infarct size, reperfusion injury represents a significant limiting factor on clinical outcomes in myocardial infarction patients. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has been shown to inhibit reperfusion injury and represents an attractive model for studying cardioprotective signal transduction pathways. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a structurally and functionally heterogenous class of RNA transcripts with unknown roles in IPC-induced cardioprotection. Through microarray-based expression profiling of 31,423 lncRNAs in cardiac tissue from IPC mice, we identified the nuclear transcript Neat1 to be rapidly and robustly decreased in response to IPC. siRNA-mediated knock down of Neat1 reduced apoptosis and necrosis in murine cardiomyocytes (CM) and human iPS-derived CMs in response to prolonged hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation, assessed with Annexin V/propidium iodide-staining, a Caspase 3/7 activity assay, LDH release, and western blot for cleaved Caspase 3. Mechanistically, Neat1 was shown to regulate processing of pro-apoptotic microRNA-22 (miR-22) in murine and human CM nuclei using a luciferase reporter assay. Hypoxia-induced downregulation of Neat1 was shown to result in accumulation of unprocessed pri-miRNA and decreased availability of biologically active miRNA, including miR-22. Addition of exogenous synthetic miR-22 reversed the protective effect of Neat1 knock down in human iPS-CM. In conclusion, we have identified the nuclear lncRNA Neat1 as part of a conserved oxygen-sensitive feedback mechanism by regulation of miRNA processing and a potential target in cardioprotection.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2020-08-23", "authors": ["OlofGidl\u00f6f", "KerstinBader", "SelviCelik", "MarioGrossi", "ShinichiNakagawa", "TetsuroHirose", "BernhardMetzler", "Bj\u00f6rnOlde", "DavidErlinge"], "doi": "10.1038/s41419-020-02854-7"}
{"title": "Biomaterials Loaded with Growth Factors/Cytokines and Stem Cells for Cardiac Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction causes cardiac tissue damage and the release of damage-associated molecular patterns leads to activation of the immune system, production of inflammatory mediators, and migration of various cells to the site of infarction. This complex response further aggravates tissue damage by generating oxidative stress, but it eventually heals the infarction site with the formation of fibrotic tissue and left ventricle remodeling. However, the limited self-renewal capability of cardiomyocytes cannot support sufficient cardiac tissue regeneration after extensive myocardial injury, thus, leading to an irreversible decline in heart function. Approaches to improve cardiac tissue regeneration include transplantation of stem cells and delivery of inflammation modulatory and wound healing factors. Nevertheless, the harsh environment at the site of infarction, which consists of, but is not limited to, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and deficiency of nutrients, is detrimental to stem cell survival and the bioactivity of the delivered factors. The use of biomaterials represents a unique and innovative approach for protecting the loaded factors from degradation, decreasing side effects by reducing the used dosage, and increasing the retention and survival rate of the loaded cells. Biomaterials with loaded stem cells and immunomodulating and tissue-regenerating factors can be used to ameliorate inflammation, improve angiogenesis, reduce fibrosis, and generate functional cardiac tissue.

Mice carrying C26 colon adenocarcinoma display cachexia (i.e., premature death and body wasting with muscle, fat and cardiac tissue depletion), high levels of inflammatory cytokines and subsequent splenomegaly. We tested whether such drugs protected these mice from cachexia. Ten-week-old mice were inoculated with C26 cells and three days later randomized to receive intravenously vehicle or 0.05 mg/kg ET743 or 0.07 mg/kg PM01183, three times a week for three weeks. ET743 or PM01183 extended the lifespan of C26-mice by 30% or 85%, respectively, without affecting tumor growth or food intake. Within 13 days from C26 implant, both drugs did not protect fat, muscle and heart from cachexia. Since PM01183 extended the animal survival more than ET743, we analyzed PM01183 further.

Recently, anti-fibrotic circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified in human and rodent cardiac tissue. In vivo (rodent) experiments proved cardiac anti-fibrotic effects of the natural compounds bufalin and lycorine by downregulating miRNA-671-5p, associated with a theoretic increase in the tissue level of circRNA CDR1as. Accordingly, we hypothesized that both anti-fibrotic drugs may inhibit focal myocardial fibrosis of the remodeled left ventricle (LV) also in a translational large animal model of heart failure (HF). Domestic pigs were repeatedly treated with subcutaneous injections of either bufalin, lycorine, or saline, (n = 5/group) between days 7-21 post acute myocardial infarction (AMI). At the 2-month follow-up, both bufalin and lycorine led to significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis. Bufalin treatment additionally led to smaller end-diastolic volumes, higher LV ejection fraction (EF), and increased expression of CDR1as of the AMI region. Elevated tissue levels of the circRNA CDR1as in the AMI region of the pig heart correlated significantly with LV and right ventricular EF, LV stroke volume, and negatively with infarct size. In conclusion, we successfully identified the circRNA CDR1as in pig hearts and show a significant association with improved LV and RV function by anti-fibrotic therapies in a translational animal model of HF.", "journal": "Biomolecules", "date": "2020-08-23", "authors": ["JuliaMester-Tonczar", "JohannesWinkler", "PatrickEinzinger", "EnaHasimbegovic", "NinaKastner", "DominikaLukovic", "KatrinZlabinger", "AndreasSpannbauer", "DeniseTraxler", "SandorBatkai", "ThomasThum", "MariannGy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si"], "doi": "10.3390/biom10081180\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001878\n10.5935/abc.20160005\n10.1007/BF03086131\n10.1016/j.ddmec.2007.12.006\n10.1038/srep43958\n10.3109/08977194.2011.595714\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.6.2849\n10.1016/S0022-2828(05)82390-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042559\n10.1073/pnas.1422997112\n10.3390/ijms14011370\n10.1093/carcin/bgy039\n10.1159/000487457\n10.1186/1743-422X-8-483\n10.1038/emboj.2011.359\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.03.020\n10.1186/s12935-019-0959-y\n10.3389/fnmol.2016.00025\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151753\n10.1093/dnares/dsx022\n10.1073/pnas.0805038105\n10.1038/s41467-020-14349-2\n10.3758/s13428-019-01246-w\n10.1002/ejhf.223\n10.3892/ol.2018.8700\n10.1038/nature11928\n10.1186/2045-3701-4-56\n10.1038/srep22384\n10.1038/srep12453\n10.1126/science.aam8526\n10.3390/biom9090429\n10.1038/s41598-018-27987-w\n10.1371/journal.pone.0158347"}
{"title": "Osthole Reduces Mouse IOP Associated With Ameliorating Extracellular Matrix Expression of Trabecular Meshwork Cell.", "abstract": "Elevation of IOP in POAG is thought to involve excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the trabecular meshwork (TM), leading to an increase in outflow resistance of the aqueous humor. Osthole, a coumarin derivative extracted from the fruit of a variety of plants, such as Cnidium monnieri, is reported to prevent profibrotic responses by inhibiting Smad signaling pathway activated by TGF-\u03b2 in liver, kidney, and cardiac tissues. We tested if osthole can (1) inhibit TGF-\u03b22-induced extracellular matrix expression in cultured human TM (HTM) cells, and (2) lower TGF-\u03b22-induced ocular hypertension in the mouse.\nCultured HTM cells were treated with 5 ng/mL TGF-\u03b22 for 48 hours, then with osthole for 24 hours. The expressions of fibronectin, collagen type IV, and laminin were assessed by quantitative PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. BALB/cJ mice were injected intravitreally with an adenoviral vector encoding a bioactive mutant of TGF-\u03b22 (Ad.hTGF-\u03b22226/228) in one eye to induce ocular hypertension, with the uninjected contralateral or Ad.Empty-injected eye serving as controls. Mice were then treated with a daily intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg osthole. Conscious mouse IOP values were measured using a TonoLab rebound tonometer.\nIn cultured HTM cells, stimulation with TGF-\u03b22 increased expressions of fibronectin, collagen IV, and laminin. These in vitro changes were significantly and completely mitigated by osthole (10 \u00b5M). Daily intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg/kg osthole, starting either at day 0 (same day as Ad.hTGF-\u03b22226/228 injection) or at day 14, significantly decreased TGF-\u03b22-induced ocular hypertension in the mouse. In contrast, osthole did not affect IOP of control eyes.\nThese results demonstrated that osthole is capable of reducing TGF-\u03b22-induced extracellular matrix expression in cultured HTM cells. It also reduced TGF-\u03b22-induced ocular hypertension in the mouse.

{"title": "Long non-coding RNA SAP30-2:1 is downregulated in congenital heart disease and regulates cell proliferation by targeting HAND2.", "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in many diseases. However, their involvement in CHD is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of dysregulated lncRNAs in CHD. We used Gene Expression Omnibus data mining, bioinformatics analysis, and analysis of clinical tissue samples and observed that the novel lncRNA SAP30-2:1 with unknown function was significantly downregulated in damaged cardiac tissues from patients with CHD.

Muscle MRI was consistent with previous studies of ANO5-RD with increased T1 signal in the posterior and medial compartments of the upper leg and the posterior compartment of the lower leg. Cardiac studies using echocardiography and cardiac MRI revealed dilation of the aortic root and thickening of the aortic valve without significant stenosis in 3/10 patients. There was evidence of abnormal late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MRI in 2/10 patients. In ANO5-RD, the development of cardiac fibrosis, edema or inflammation as demonstrated by LGE has not yet been reported.

This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of epigenetic regulation of NR2F2 in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) development. In the present study, immunohistochemical staining showed that NR2F2 protein expression was significantly higher in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tissues of TOF cases compared with controls. The methylation status of the CpG island shore (CGIS) of the NR2F2 gene was decreased in TOF cases, and the CpG site 3 in the CGIS region of NR2F2 promoter was a differential methylation site. Furthermore, the methylation level of the CpG site 3 and the NR2F2 protein expression were significantly negatively correlated in TOF patients. In\u00a0vitro functional analysis revealed that RXR\u03b1 could upregulate the NR2F2 gene by directly binding to the CGIS in the NR2F2 promoter, while hypomethylation of the NR2F2 promoter via treatment with 5-azacytidine influenced the affinity of RXR\u03b1 to its binding sites, as shown by ChIP-qPCR. These findings suggest that promoter hypomethylation activates NR2F2 by enhancing RXR\u03b1 binding to NR2F2 CGIS in the development of TOF.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2020-08-21", "authors": ["LiXiaodi", "YeMing", "XuHongfei", "ZhuYanjie", "GuRuoyi", "XiaojingMa", "ShengWei", "HuangGuoying"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.110"}

{"title": "In vitro controlled release of extracellular vesicles for cardiac repair from poly(glycerol sebacate) acrylate-based polymers.", "abstract": "Cell therapy to restore cardiac function in chronic heart failure has been extensively studied. However, its therapeutic value is limited due to poor cell engraftment and survival and the therapeutic outcomes have been attributed to paracrine secretions such as extracellular vesicles (EV). The direct use of EV is an attractive therapeutic strategy and it has been shown that the kinetics of delivery of the EV to the targeted tissue may impact the outcomes. However, there are currently no technologies to deliver EV to the heart in a controlled and tunable manner. The objective of this study was to design a controlled release system, based on a photocurable adhesive polymer, to locally deliver EV to the cardiac tissue. We have first demonstrated that the adhesive polymer, PGSA-g-EG, did not impact the EV bioactivity in vitro and was biocompatible in vivo when tested in a rat model. Importantly, the polymer remained attached to the heart surface for at least 1 month. We have then evaluated and optimized the in vitro release kinetics of the EV from the PGSA-g-EG polymer. Freeze-dried EV formulations were developed to tune the release kinetics and maximize the loading in the polymeric material. Moreover, despite the instability of the EV in aqueous medium at 37\u00b0C, the PGSA-g-EG polymer was able to release bioactive EV for at least 14 days. Overall, these results suggest that the PGSA-g-EG is a suitable material to promote the controlled delivery of bioactive EV over an extended period of time. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Extracellular vesicles (EV) are an investigational class of therapeutics that has shown promise to restore cardiac function following an ischemic event. Furthermore, its translation to the clinics is expected to pose less regulatory challenges than cell-based therapies. However, EV therapeutic outcomes are likely to be impacted by the route of administration and the kinetics of delivery to the target tissue. Therefore, there is a need for biomaterial-based technologies to deliver, in a controlled and tunable manner, EV to the heart. The present study describes the use of PGSA-g-EG polymer as an adhesive cardiac patch with potential to enable the controlled delivery of bioactive EV over an extended period of time to the cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2020-08-20", "authors": ["ThomasHamada", "Julie L NDubois", "Val\u00e9rieBellamy", "LaetitiaPidial", "AlbertHag\u00e8ge", "Maria NPereira", "PhilippeMenasch\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2020.08.015"}
{"title": "Protective effects of deferoxamine on lead-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.", "abstract": "Because of the numerous industrial applications of lead (Pb), Pb poisoning is an important public health threat in the world particularly in developing and industrialized countries. Oxidative stress is one of the important mechanisms of Pb-mediated toxicity. Deferoxamine (DFO) is an iron chelating agent that has recently shown antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects. This study investigated the protective capacity of DFO against Pb-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. We used five groups in this study: control, DFO (300 mg/kg), Pb (50 mg/kg), DFO (150 mg/kg) + Pb, DFO (300 mg/kg) + Pb. DFO was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before intraperitoneal injection of Pb for 5 days. After drug treatment, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH), and antioxidant enzymes were measured in serum and heart samples. The results showed that pretreatment with DFO reduced Pb-induced oxidative stress markers in serum and cardiac tissues. We found that LDH and LPO levels were significantly increased in Pb-treated rats and decreased with DFO pre-administration. Furthermore, the decreased activities of total antioxidant capacity, and GSH were observed after Pb treatment. However, DFO administration effectively prevented the Pb-induced alterations of these antioxidant enzymes activities. In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that DFO has protective effects in Pb-induced cardiotoxicity in rats, probably due to its antioxidant action and inhibition of oxidative stress.", "journal": "Toxicology and industrial health", "date": "2020-08-20", "authors": ["AlirezaGazeri", "AzadehAminzadeh"], "doi": "10.1177/0748233720947231"}

Studies have shown intrinsic myocardial defects but do not sufficiently explain developmental defects in the endocardial-derived cardiac valve, septum, and vasculature. Here, we identify a developmentally impaired endocardial population in HLHS through single-cell RNA profiling of hiPSC-derived endocardium and human fetal heart tissue with an underdeveloped left ventricle. Intrinsic endocardial defects contribute to abnormal endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, NOTCH signaling, and extracellular matrix organization, key factors in valve formation. Endocardial abnormalities cause reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and maturation by disrupting fibronectin-integrin signaling, consistent with recently described de novo HLHS mutations associated with abnormal endocardial gene and fibronectin regulation.

Here, we aim to develop a three-dimensional hetero-cellular model to analyse the electric interaction between fibroblasts and human cardiomyocytes in vitro using selective optogenetic de- or hyperpolarization of fibroblasts.\nNIH3T3 cell lines expressing the light-sensitive ion channel Channelrhodopsin2 or the light-induced proton pump Archaerhodopsin were generated for optogenetic depolarization or hyperpolarization, respectively, and characterized by patch clamp. Cardiac bodies consisting of 50% fibroblasts and 50% human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were analysed by video microscopy and membrane potential was measured with sharp electrodes. Myofibroblast activation in cardiac bodies was enhanced by transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21)-stimulation. Connexin-43 expression was analysed by qPCR and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Illumination of Channelrhodopsin2 or Archaerhodopsin expressing fibroblasts induced inward currents and depolarization or outward currents and hyperpolarization. Transforming growth factor-\u03b21-stimulation elevated connexin-43 expression and increased cell-cell coupling between fibroblasts as well as increased basal beating frequency and cardiomyocyte resting membrane potential in cardiac bodies. Illumination of cardiac bodies generated with Channelrhodopsin2 fibroblasts accelerated spontaneous beating, especially after TGF-\u03b21-stimulation. Illumination of cardiac bodies prepared with Archaerhodopsin expressing fibroblasts led to hyperpolarization of cardiomyocytes and complete block of spontaneous beating after TGF-\u03b21-stimulation. Effects of light were significantly smaller without TGF-\u03b21-stimulation.\nTransforming growth factor-\u03b21-stimulation leads to increased hetero-cellular coupling and optogenetic hyperpolarization of fibroblasts reduces TGF-\u03b21 induced effects on cardiomyocyte spontaneous activity.

{"title": "An emerging role of regulatory T-cells in cardiovascular repair and regeneration.", "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that immune cells play an important role in the regulation of tissue repair and regeneration. After injury, danger signals released by the damaged tissue trigger the initial pro-inflammatory phase essential for removing pathogens or cellular debris that is later replaced by the anti-inflammatory phase responsible for tissue healing. On the other hand, impaired immune regulation can lead to excessive scarring and fibrosis that could be detrimental for the restoration of organ function. Regulatory T-cells (Treg) have been revealed as the master regulator of the immune system that have both the immune and regenerative functions. In this review, we will summarize their immune role in the induction and maintenance of self-tolerance; as well as their regenerative role in directing tissue specific response for repair and regeneration. The latter is clearly demonstrated when Treg enhance the differentiation of stem or progenitor cells such as satellite cells to replace the damaged skeletal muscle, as well as the proliferation of parenchymal cells including neonatal cardiomyocytes for functional regeneration. Moreover, we will also discuss the reparative and regenerative role of Treg with a particular focus on blood vessels and cardiac tissues.

However, there remains an urgent need for the development of a method capable of accurately measuring the contractile force of physiologically relevant 3D myocardial tissues to facilitate the prediction of human heart tissue drug sensitivity. To this end, our laboratory has developed a novel drug screening model that measures the contractile force of cardiac cell sheets prepared using temperature-responsive culture dishes. To circumvent the difficulties that commonly arise during the stacking of cardiomyocyte sheets, we established a stacking method using centrifugal force, making it possible to measure 3D myocardial tissue. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were seeded in a temperature-responsive culture dish and processed into a sheet. The cardiac cell sheets were multilayered to construct 3D cardiac tissue. Measurement of the contractile force and cross-sectional area of the multilayered 3D cardiac tissue were then obtained and used to determine the relationship between the cross-sectional area of the cardiac tissue and its contractile force.

Despite substantial strides in understanding the ECM, scaffold fabrication processes of sufficient product robustness and bioactivity require further investigation, owing to the complexity of the natural ECM. A promising bioacive platform for cardiac tissue engineering is that of decellularized porcine cardiac ECM (pcECM, used here as a soft tissue representative model). However, this platform's complexity and batch-to-batch variability serve as processing limitations in attaining a robust and tunable cardiac tissue-specific bioactive scaffold. To address these issues, we fabricated 3D composite scaffolds (3DCSs) that demonstrate comparable physical and biochemical properties to the natural pcECM using wet electrospinning and functionalization with a pcECM hydrogel. The fabricated 3DCSs are non-immunogenic in vitro and support human mesenchymal stem cells' proliferation. Most importantly, the 3DCSs demonstrate tissue-specific bioactivity in inducing spontaneous cardiac lineage differentiation in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and further support the viability, functionality, and maturation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Genomic characterization reveals novel mechanisms underlying the valosin-containing protein-mediated cardiac protection against heart failure.", "abstract": "Chronic hypertension is a key risk factor for heart failure. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Our previous studies found that the valosin-containing protein (VCP), an ATPase-associated protein, was significantly decreased in the hypertensive heart tissues. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that restoration of VCP protected the heart against pressure overload-induced heart failure. With a cardiac-specific transgenic (TG) mouse model, we showed that a moderate increase of VCP was able to attenuate chronic pressure overload-induced maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. RNA sequencing and a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis further demonstrated that overexpression of VCP in the heart normalized the pressure overload-stimulated hypertrophic signals and repressed the stress-induced inflammatory response. In addition, VCP overexpression promoted cell survival by enhancing the mitochondria resistance to the oxidative stress via activating the Rictor-mediated-gene networks. VCP was also found to be involved in the regulation of the alternative splicing and differential isoform expression for some genes that are related to ATP production and protein synthesis by interacting with long no-coding RNAs and histone deacetylases, indicating a novel epigenetic regulation of VCP in integrating coding and noncoding genomic network in the stressed heart. In summary, our study demonstrated that the rescuing of a deficient VCP in the heart could prevent pressure overload-induced heart failure by rectifying cardiac hypertrophic and inflammatory signaling and enhancing the cardiac resistance to oxidative stress, which brought in novel insights into the understanding of the mechanism of VCP in protecting patients from hypertensive heart failure.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2020-08-17", "authors": ["NingZhou", "XinChen", "JingXi", "BenMa", "ChristianaLeimena", "ShaunrickStoll", "GangjianQin", "CharlesWang", "HongyuQiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2020.101662"}

Last, we enrolled patients with stage D HF and sampled their blood before and after taking 5 to 9 days of oral nicotinamide riboside (NR), a NAD precursor.RESULTSWe demonstrated that HF is associated with both reduced respiratory capacity and elevated proinflammatory cytokine gene expressions. In our in vitro model, MitoDAMP-treated PBMCs secreted IL-6 that impaired mitochondrial respiration by reducing complex I activity. Last, oral NR administration enhanced PBMC respiration and reduced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in 4 subjects with HF.CONCLUSIONThese findings suggest that systemic inflammation in patients with HF is causally linked to mitochondrial function of the PBMCs. Increasing NAD levels may have the potential to improve mitochondrial respiration and attenuate proinflammatory activation of PBMCs in HF.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT03727646.FUNDINGThis study was funded by the NIH, the University of Washington, and the American Heart Association.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2020-08-14", "authors": ["BoZhou", "Dennis Ding-HwaWang", "YanhuaQiu", "SophiaAirhart", "YaxinLiu", "AprilStempien-Otero", "Kevin DO'Brien", "RongTian"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI138538\n10.1016/j.ejheart.2008.08.005\n10.1186/s12872-018-0815-3\n10.1001/jama.289.2.194\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.302317\n10.1042/BCJ20170714\n10.1161/01.RES.0000043825.01705.1B\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000077913.60364.D2\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000124490.27666.B2\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038010\n10.1172/JCI120849\n10.1172/JCI120845\n10.1038/ni.1831\n10.1038/nature09663\n10.1210/er.2009-0026\n10.1172/JCI83260\n10.4162/nrp.2019.13.1.3\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.043\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.026099\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022495\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.12.087\n10.1038/labinvest.2013.53\n10.1136/jcp.34.10.1083\n10.1056/NEJMcibr1003521\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2016.06.013\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2004.08.041\n10.1371/journal.pone.0186459\n10.4049/jimmunol.1301490\n10.1038/cr.2011.20\n10.1111/imr.12621\n10.1097/01.shk.0000226341.32786.b9\n10.1074/jbc.271.16.9535\n10.1007/s10863-011-9361-8\n10.7554/eLife.06376\n10.7150/ijbs.15153\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.023\n10.1093/hmg/ddy278\n10.1042/CS20160685\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032626\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.05.073\n10.1179/1351000212Y.0000000001\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.009\n10.1186/s12967-018-1690-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0046364\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600244"}

Seventy-five rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 15): sham group, ISO group, low-dose group (1.2 mg/kg/days for 7 days), medium-dose group (1.8 mg/kg/days for 7 days), and high-dose group (3.6 mg/kg/days for 7 days). Routine HE staining and Masson staining were performed to observe myocardial histopathology. The expression of oxidative stress-related indicators, heart tissue apoptosis-related proteins, and JNK and p-JNK proteins were measured for different groups.\nCompared with the sham group, the T wave value of the ISO group was significantly increased (p < 0.01). When allicin was administered, the T wave values at different time points in all groups were all decreased. Compared with the sham group, the ratio of eNOS, Bcl-2/Bax was significantly decreased, and p-eNOS, iNOS, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Cyt-c were significantly elevated in the ISO group (p < 0.05). After allicin was administered, significant changes in these proteins were observed in the medium- and high-dose groups. There was no significant change in the expression of JNK protein in the ISO group compared with the sham group; however, the expression of eNOS and p-JNK protein were significantly upregulated (p < 0.01) and the expression of p-eNOS and iNOS were significantly downregulated (p < 0.01).

Then, we hypothesized laminin-221 may have an adjuvant effect on therapeutic efficacy by enhancing cell viability and survival after transplantation of 3-dimensional engineered cardiac tissue (ECT) to a rat model of myocardial infarction. Methods and Results In vitro study indicates the impacts of laminin-221 on hiPS-CMs were analyzed on the basis of mechanical function, mitochondrial function, and tolerance to hypoxia. We constructed 3-dimensional ECT containing hiPS-CMs and fibrin gel conjugated with laminin-221. Heart function and in vivo behavior were assessed after engraftment of 3-dimensional ECT (laminin-conjugated ECT, n=10; ECT, n=10; control, n=10) in a rat model of myocardial infarction. In vitro assessment indicated that laminin-221 improves systolic velocity, diastolic velocity, and maximum capacity of oxidative metabolism of hiPS-CMs. Cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase production revealed that laminin-221 improved tolerance to hypoxia. Furthermore, analysis of mRNA expression revealed that antiapoptotic genes were upregulated in the laminin group under hypoxic conditions. Left ventricular ejection fraction of the laminin-conjugated ECT group was significantly better than that of other groups 4 weeks after transplantation. Laminin-conjugated ECT transplantation was associated with significant improvements in expression levels of rat vascular endothelial growth factor. In early assessments, cell survival was also improved in laminin-conjugated ECTs compared with ECT transplantation without laminin-221. Conclusions In vitro laminin-221 enhanced mechanical and metabolic function of hiPS-CMs and improved the therapeutic impact of 3-dimensional ECT in a rat ischemic cardiomyopathy model.

Herein we report an inhibitory role of Nrf2, a key transcription factor of cellular defense, in regulating cardiac senescence in infarcted hearts as well as a therapeutic potential of targeting Nrf2-mediated suppression of cardiac senescence in the treatment of MI-induced cardiac dysfunction. MI was induced by left coronary artery ligation for 28\u00a0days in mice. Heart tissues from the infarct border zone were used for the analyses. The MI-induced cardiac dysfunction was associated with increased myocardial cell senescence, oxidative stress and apoptosis in adult wild type (WT) mice.

The current study was aimed to investigate the underlying molecular pathways which may contribute in revealing the protective effects of Pistacia integerrima against BPA induced oxidative stress. The dose of 100\u00a0\u00b5g/kg BW of BPA, 200\u00a0mg/kg BW P. integerrima, and 4\u00a0mg/kg BW melatonin was administered to Sprague Dawley rats. Present results of western blotting and qRT-PCR showed the increased expression of p53, PUMA and Drp1, while downregulation of Ubc13 in heart tissues of BPA treated group whereas the levels were reversed upon treatment with P. integerrima. The role of BPA in heart tissue apoptosis was further confirmed by the increased level of P-p53, cytochrome C and disrupted cellular architecture whereas the P. integerrima has shown its ameliorative potential by mitigating the adverse effects of BPA. Moreover, the oxidant, antioxidant, lipid, and liver markers profile has also revealed the therapeutic potential of P. integerrima by maintaining the levels in the normal range.

Numerous studies find that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play pivotal roles in a variety of biological functions. However, the role of circ_0068655 in MI and human induced pluripotent stem-derived cardiomyocytes (HCMs) remains unknown.\nThe expression of circ_0068655, miR-498, and PRKC apoptosis WT1 regulator (PAWR) in human MI heart tissues and hypoxia subjected HCMs was evaluated with qRT-PCR and Western blot. The effects of circ_0068655 on hypoxia-induced apoptotic death and cell migration in HCMs were evaluated with qRT-PCR, cell viability, cell death ELISA (POD), and Caspase-3 activity assay, and Trans-well assay, respectively. Furthermore, luciferase assay, qRT-PCR, biotin-labeled miRNA pulldown assay, and Western blot were employed in the functional studies.\nWe found that the expression of circ_0068655 and PAWR was enhanced in MI patients and hypoxia subjected HCMs; by contrast, the expression of miR-498 decreased. Inhibited expression of circ_0068655 in HMCs counteracted hypoxia-induced apoptotic death and impaired cell migration, in sharp contrast to circ_0068655 knockdown.

Compared with those in the control group, the mice in the model group had significantly lower expression of miR-223-3p. However, significantly higher mRNA and protein expression levels of NLRP3 were observed (P<0.05). After modeling, miR-223-3p overexpression downregulated the expression levels of NLRP3 mRNA, Bax and NLRP3 protein, as well as inhibited endothelial cell apoptosis (P<0.05), while the inhibition of miR-223-3p expression upregulated the expression levels and promoted apoptosis. In conclusion, miR-223-3p expression is low, however, NLRP3 is highly expressed in the heart tissue of HGHF-induced diabetic mice. miR-223-3p reduces the injury of MCMECs and inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis in mice by regulating the expression of NLRP3.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2020-08-09", "authors": ["BoDeng", "YingHu", "XiaSheng", "HuijunZeng", "YananHuo"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2020.8864\n10.7326/M15-3016\n10.1001/jama.2017.0947\n10.1038/ng.3943\n10.2174/1381612823666170124125826\n10.1093/cvr/cvw235\n10.1371/journal.pone.0108468\n10.1159/000445609\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2014.01.012\n10.1038/cddis.2016.451\n10.1073/pnas.1100255108\n10.18632/oncotarget.12302\n10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.05.007\n10.2337/dc16-2050\n10.4239/wjd.v8.i4.120\n10.1007/s11136-016-1481-5\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.03.013\n10.1007/s10557-017-6725-2\n10.1186/s12906-019-2443-6\n10.1007/s00395-014-0415-z\n10.1161/JAHA.116.004878\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.02.012\n10.1186/s13075-015-0555-z\n10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2017.12.014\n10.1007/s10654-018-0380-1\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.01.012"}
{"title": "Time Course of Gene Expression Profile in Renal Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury in Mice.", "abstract": "Ischemic renal failure is an inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the heart. The organ responds to the stimulus and undergoes tissue remodeling that can result in cardiac hypertrophy. This study aimed to characterize the cardiac global gene expression profile in renal ischemia/reperfusion (IR) model using microarray technology. To do that, left kidney ischemia was induced in male C57BL/6 mice for 60 minutes, followed by reperfusion (IR) for 5, 8, 15, or 20 days post ischemia (dpi). Total cardiac tissue RNA was extracted and hybridized to chips with 35,000 mouse genes. The GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array Expression chip (Affymetrix) was used, and CEL files generated were processed with DNA-Chip-Analyzer (dCHIP) software. Subsequent analysis considered only differences among groups of at least 1.2-fold (up or down) expression changes. Analyses of the samples indicated positive modulation of 17,413 genes and 405 pathways and negative modulation of 18,287 genes and 300 pathways. A narrower analysis of genes related to inflammation, metabolism, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and channels/ion transport was performance, and it was correlated with IR injury, corroborating previous data from literature. Renal IR induced a global shift in cardiac tissue gene expression; in particular, genes related to the inflammatory system and cardiomyocyte function were changed.

Studies have revealed that the efficacy of MSCs is mainly attributed to their capacity to secrete numerous trophic factors that promote angiogenesis, inhibit apoptosis, and modulate the immune response. There is growing evidence that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing a cargo of lipids, proteins, metabolites, and RNAs play a key role in this paracrine mechanism. In particular, encapsulated microRNAs have been identified as important positive regulators of angiogenesis in pathological settings of insufficient blood supply to the heart, thus opening a new path for the treatment of CVD.

{"title": "COVID-19 as a viral functional ACE2 deficiency disorder with ACE2 related multi-organ disease.", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the agent of COVID-19, shares a lineage with SARS-CoV-1, and a common fatal pulmonary profile but with striking differences in presentation, clinical course, and response to treatment. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 (SARS), COVID-19 has presented as an often bi-phasic, multi-organ pathology, with a proclivity for severe disease in the elderly and those with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Whilst death is usually related to respiratory collapse, autopsy reveals multi-organ pathology. Chronic pulmonary disease is underrepresented in the group with severe COVID-19. A commonality of aberrant renin angiotensin system (RAS) is suggested in the at-risk group. The identification of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor allowing viral entry to cells precipitated our interest in the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We propose that COVID-19 is a viral multisystem disease, with dominant vascular pathology, mediated by global reduction in ACE2 function, pronounced in disease conditions with RAS bias toward angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) over ACE2. It is further complicated by organ specific pathology related to loss of ACE2 expressing cells particularly affecting the endothelium, alveolus, glomerulus and cardiac microvasculature. The possible upregulation in ACE2 receptor expression may predispose individuals with aberrant RAS status to higher viral load on infection and relatively more cell loss. Relative ACE2 deficiency leads to enhanced and protracted tissue, and vessel exposure to angiotensin II, characterised by vasoconstriction, enhanced thrombosis, cell proliferation and recruitment, increased tissue permeability, and cytokine production (including IL-6) resulting in inflammation. Additionally, there is a profound loss of the \"protective\" angiotensin (1-7), a vasodilator with anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, antiproliferative, antifibrotic, anti-arrhythmic, and antioxidant activity. Our model predicts global vascular insult related to direct endothelial cell damage, vasoconstriction and thrombosis with a disease specific cytokine profile related to angiotensin II rather than \"cytokine storm\". Our proposed mechanism of lung injury provides an explanation for early hypoxia without reduction in lung compliance and suggests a need for revision of treatment protocols to address vasoconstriction, thromboprophylaxis, and to minimize additional small airways and alveolar trauma via ventilation choice. Our model predicts long term sequelae of scarring/fibrosis in vessels, lungs, renal and cardiac tissue with protracted illness in at-risk individuals. It is hoped that our model stimulates review of current diagnostic and therapeutic intervention protocols, particularly with respect to early anticoagulation, vasodilatation and revision of ventilatory support choices.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2020-08-08", "authors": ["RosemaryGan", "Nicholas PRosoman", "David J EHenshaw", "Euan PNoble", "PeterGeorgius", "NigelSommerfeld"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110024"}

Very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was decreased in the plasma of ISO-administered rats. A heart mitochondrial fraction of the ISO rats showed a significant decrease in the activities of mitochondrial enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase. The activities of lysosomal enzymes (\u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, cathepsin-B, and cathepsin-D) were increased significantly in the heart tissue homogenate of disease control rats.

Using these tools, Danon patient-derived cardiac tissue, primary fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were analyzed. Metabolic profiling indicated LAMP-2 deficiency promoted a switch toward glycolysis accompanied by rerouting of tryptophan metabolism. Cardiomyocytes' energetic balance and NAD+/NADH ratio appeared to be maintained despite mitochondrial aging. In turn, metabolic adaption was accompanied by a senescence-associated signature. Similarly, Danon fibroblasts appeared more stress prone and less biomechanically compliant. Overall, shaping of both morphology and metabolism contributed to the loss of cardiac biomechanical competence that characterizes the clinical progression of Danon disease.", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "date": "2020-08-06", "authors": ["GiorgiaDel Favero", "AloisBonifacio", "Teisha JRowland", "ShanshanGao", "KunhuaSong", "ValterSergo", "Eric DAdler", "LuisaMestroni", "OrfeoSbaizero", "Matthew R GTaylor"], "doi": "10.3390/jcm9082457\n10.1038/35022604\n10.1016/j.mam.2006.08.005\n10.1007/s11910-003-0040-y\n10.1242/jcs.184770\n10.1097/GIM.0b013e31820ad795\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.09.024\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.05.007\n10.1002/stem.2015\n10.1073/pnas.1808618116\n10.1002/mus.21811\n10.1007/s10038-007-0184-8\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.01.020\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001105\n10.1038/s41598-018-24351-w\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1093/nar/gkn923\n10.1093/nar/gkz401\n10.1534/g3.112.003202\n10.1093/nar/gkm427\n10.1093/nar/gki624\n10.1038/srep13388\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.12.020\n10.1155/2015/271983\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.06.001\n10.1038/srep29082\n10.4172/2157-7633.1000436\n10.1681/ASN.2019020111\n10.1002/jcp.26924\n10.1186/s13287-018-0895-0\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01523\n10.1126/science.1209038\n10.3389/fcell.2018.00031\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.027\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00727\n10.1074/mcp.RA117.000425\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.026099\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.05.023\n10.1038/nature02263\n10.1093/nar/gkt1076\n10.1093/nar/gkx1089\n10.1016/j.trsl.2019.03.004\n10.1111/1440-1681.12753\n10.1039/c0an00459f\n10.1002/jrs.4607\n10.1186/s12931-018-0801-4\n10.1111/1751-2980.12882\n10.1152/ajplung.00300.2014\n10.1038/srep38489\n10.1038/s41598-019-39419-4\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.06.311\n10.1002/path.4115\n10.1152/ajplung.00220.2017\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04433\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2006.05.004\n10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02646.x\n10.1073/pnas.1906643116\n10.1186/s10020-019-0074-5\n10.1038/s41598-018-29809-5\n10.15252/embj.201592862\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302095\n10.1186/s10020-018-0005-x\n10.1111/bph.12475\n10.7150/jca.14274\n10.2174/1871520616666161031143301\n10.1111/bph.13422\n10.1002/lary.26254\n10.1021/pr501221g\n10.1038/s42255-018-0013-8\n10.1002/jcp.25998\n10.1016/j.cca.2019.08.029\n10.1074/mcp.RA118.000583\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.01.023\n10.1038/s41598-018-21519-2\n10.1074/mcp.RA119.001390\n10.1242/dev.120576\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.04.027\n10.1016/j.exger.2019.110797\n10.1038/srep19618\n10.1016/j.exger.2019.110805"}
{"title": "Dynamic Properties of Heart Fragments from Different Regions and Their Synchronization.", "abstract": "The dynamic properties of the heart differ based on the regions that effectively circulate blood throughout the body with each heartbeat. These properties, including the inter-beat interval (IBI) of autonomous beat activity, are retained even in in vitro tissue fragments. However, details of beat dynamics have not been well analyzed, particularly at the sub-mm scale, although such dynamics of size are important for regenerative medicine and computational studies of the heart. We analyzed the beat dynamics in sub-mm tissue fragments from atria and ventricles of hearts obtained from chick embryos over a period of 40 h. The IBI and contraction speed differed by region and atrial fragments retained their values for a longer time. The major finding of this study is synchronization of these fragment pairs physically attached to each other. The probability of achieving this and the time required differ for regional pairs: atrium-atrium, ventricle-ventricle, or atrium-ventricle. Furthermore, the time required to achieve 1:1 synchronization does not depend on the proximity of initial IBI of paired fragments. Various interesting phenomena, such as 1:n synchronization and a reentrant-like beat sequence, are revealed during synchronization. Finally, our observation of fragment dynamics indicates that mechanical motion itself contributes to the synchronization of atria.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-08-06", "authors": ["ShinArai", "KentoLloyd", "TomonoriTakahashi", "KazukiMammoto", "TakashiMiyazawa", "KeiTamura", "TomoyukiKaneko", "KentaroIshida", "YuutaMoriyama", "ToshiyukiMitsui"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering7030081\n10.1038/35065745\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.01.016\n10.1152/physrev.00018.2007\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300522\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aah5457\n10.1161/01.CIR.14.1.38\n10.1016/0002-8703(47)90085-9\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2006.00637.x\n10.1002/bit.24725\n10.1152/physrev.00002.2005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.748053\n10.1038/1991104a0\n10.1007/978-1-4614-8244-4_7\n10.1038/scientificamerican1293-102\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.08.031\n10.1038/nbt.3268\n10.5772/22870\n10.23937/2378-2951/1410100\n10.1016/j.ccep.2015.03.012\n10.1007/BF01907093\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.04.034\n10.1007/BF01869344\n10.1039/C7BM00171A\n10.1209/0295-5075/86/18001\n10.1007/BF01009349\n10.1038/srep04670\n10.1038/nature26001\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2014.07.009\n10.1113/JP270532\n10.1016/j.cma.2016.05.031\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2009.11.001\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.09.010\n10.1016/S1361-8415(97)85013-X\n10.1111/j.1440-169X.1990.00233.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvr167\n10.1113/jphysiol.1984.sp015461\n10.1085/jgp.111.1.95\n10.1073/pnas.0501539102\n10.1063/1.4999465\n10.1063/1.4747709\n10.1152/ajpheart.01233.2007\n10.1073/pnas.0809148106\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.025\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.015057\n10.1098/rsob.150038\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.018\n10.1006/excr.1994.1154\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.10.037\n10.1161/CIRCEP.108.829341\n10.1113/jphysiol.2008.153395\n10.1242/dev.090332\n10.1529/biophysj.108.136473\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.01.010\n10.1529/biophysj.106.101410\n10.1529/biophysj.106.091892\n10.1161/01.RES.86.12.1193\n10.1242/jcs.162891\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.231910\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458"}
{"title": "Retene, pyrene and phenanthrene cause distinct molecular-level changes in the cardiac tissue of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) larvae, part 2 - Proteomics and metabolomics.", "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are global contaminants of concern. Despite several decades of research, their mechanisms of toxicity are not very well understood. Early life stages of fish are particularly sensitive with the developing cardiac tissue being a main target of PAHs toxicity. The mechanisms of cardiotoxicity of the three widespread model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) retene, pyrene and phenanthrene were explored in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) early life stages. Newly hatched larvae were exposed to sublethal doses of each individual PAH causing no detectable morphometric alterations. Changes in the cardiac proteome and metabolome were assessed after 7 or 14\u00a0days of exposure to each PAH. Phase I and II enzymes regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor were significantly induced by all PAHs, with retene being the most potent compound. Retene significantly altered the level of several proteins involved in key cardiac functions such as muscle contraction, cellular tight junctions or calcium homeostasis. Those findings were quite consistent with previous reports regarding the effects of retene on the cardiac transcriptome. Significant changes in proteins linked to iron and heme metabolism were observed following exposure to pyrene. While phenanthrene also altered the levels of several proteins in the cardiac tissue, no clear mechanisms or pathways could be highlighted. Due to high variability between samples, very few significant changes were detected in the cardiac metabolome overall. Slight but significant changes were still observed for pyrene and phenanthrene, suggesting possible effects on several energetic or signaling pathways. This study shows that early exposure to different PAHs can alter the expression of key proteins involved in the cardiac function, which could potentially affect negatively the fitness of the larvae and later of the juvenile fish.", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "date": "2020-08-05", "authors": ["CyrilRigaud", "AndreasEriksson", "AnneRokka", "MortenSkaugen", "JennaLihavainen", "MarkkuKein\u00e4nen", "HeliLehtivuori", "Eeva-RiikkaVehni\u00e4inen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141161"}
{"title": "Acute administration of metformin prior to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury protects brain injury.", "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia is the malperfusion of cardiac tissue due to a blockage in a coronary artery. Subsequent return of blood flow to the ischemic area of the heart, results in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the heart and other organs, including the brain. Besides the cardioprotective effects of metformin on the heart against cardiac I/R injury, metformin also reduced neuronal injury in a stroke model. However, the effects of metformin on the brain following cardiac I/R injury has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we hypothesize that metformin reduces brain damage via decreasing brain mitochondrial dysfunction, microglial hyperactivity, and Alzheimer's proteins in rats after cardiac I/R injury. Rats (n\u00a0=\u00a050) received either a sham operation (n\u00a0=\u00a010) or cardiac I/R (n\u00a0=\u00a040). Cardiac I/R was induced by 30\u00a0min of cardiac ischemia, followed by 120\u00a0min of reperfusion. Rats in cardiac I/R group were divided into 4 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a010/group); vehicle, metformin 100\u00a0mg/kg, metformin 200\u00a0mg/kg, and metformin 400\u00a0mg/kg. Metformin was given via femoral vein at 15\u00a0min prior to cardiac ischemia. At the end of reperfusion, brains were removed to determine dendritic spine density, brain mitochondrial function, microglial morphology, and amyloid beta formation. Cardiac I/R injury led to brain mitochondrial dysfunction, microglial hyperactivation, amyloid beta formation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and reduced dendritic spine density with an increase in AMPK activation. All doses of metformin improved brain pathologies in rats with cardiac I/R injury possibly via activating cerebral AMPK.

Resolvin E1 (RvE1) is derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which has been reported to exert beneficial effects on DOX-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. This study was designed to investigate whether RvE1 protects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and the underlying mechanism was explored. DOX (20\u00a0mg/kg, one injection, i.p.) was used to induce DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice. At 5\u00a0days after DOX administration, the effect of RvE1 was assessed by measuring cardiac function, oxidative stress, autophagy and apoptosis in cardiac tissue. We used an AKT inhibitor and rapamycin to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that RvE1 inhibited the DOX-induced decrease in body weight and heart weight, the reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening, and the increase in lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase myocardial bound and cardiomyocyte vacuolization. Compared to the control group, the DOX group exhibited increased oxidative stress, autophagy and apoptosis in cardiac tissue, which were alleviated by treatment with RvE1. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathways were responsible for RvE1-mediated regulation of DOX-induced oxidative stress, autophagy and myocardial apoptosis.

It is often associated with specific channelopathies in cardiac tissue, yet how precisely the changes in ionic channels affect the electrical activity of cardiac cells is still an open question. Even though sodium channel mutations that underlie cardiac syndromes like the Long-Q-T and the Brugada-syndrome are known to affect a number of channel parameters simultaneously, previous studies have predominantly focused on the persistent late component of the sodium current as the causal explanation for an increased risk of heart arrhythmias in these cardiac syndromes. A systematic analysis of the impact of other important sodium channel parameters is currently lacking. Here, we investigate the reduced ten-Tusscher-model for single human epicardium ventricle cells and use mathematical bifurcation analysis to predict the dependence of the cardiac action potential on sodium channel activation and inactivation time-constants and voltage dependence. We show that, specifically, shifts of the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation curve can lead to drastic changes in the action potential dynamics, inducing oscillations of the membrane potential as well as bistability.

This trial (Eudra-CT 2009-015826-13) evaluated the clinical and biochemical effects of ubiquinol in 50 elderly patients affected by severe aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement and randomized to either placebo or 400 mg/day ubiquinol from 7 days before to 5 days after surgery. Plasma and cardiac tissue CoQ10 levels and oxidative status, circulating troponin I, CK-MB (primary endpoints), IL-6 and S100B were assessed.

Despite several decades of research, their mechanisms of toxicity are still poorly understood. This study explores the mechanisms of cardiotoxicity of the three widespread model PAHs retene, pyrene and phenanthrene in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) early life stages. Newly hatched larvae were exposed to each individual compound at sublethal doses causing no significant increase in the prevalence of deformities. Changes in the cardiac transcriptome were assessed after 1, 3, 7 and 14\u00a0days of exposure using custom Salmo salar microarrays. The highest number of differentially expressed genes was observed after 1 or 3\u00a0days of exposure, and retene was the most potent compound in that regard. Over-representation analyses suggested that genes related to cardiac ion channels, calcium homeostasis and muscle contraction (actin binding, troponin and myosin complexes) were especially targeted by retene. Pyrene was also able to alter similar myosin-related genes, but at a different timing and in an opposite direction, suggesting compound-specific mechanisms of toxicity. Pyrene and to a lesser extent phenanthrene were altering key genes linked to the respiratory electron transport chain and to oxygen and iron metabolism. Overall, phenanthrene was not very potent in inducing changes in the cardiac transcriptome despite being apparently metabolized at a slower rate than retene and pyrene. The present study shows that exposure to different PAHs during the first few days of the swim-up stage can alter the expression of key genes involved into the cardiac development and function, which could potentially affect negatively the fitness of the larvae in the long term.", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "date": "2020-08-02", "authors": ["CyrilRigaud", "AndreasEriksson", "AlekseiKrasnov", "EmmaWincent", "HannuPakkanen", "HeliLehtivuori", "JanneIhalainen", "Eeva-RiikkaVehni\u00e4inen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141031"}

In the present study we describe a novel protective immuno-modulatory function of CAP in inflammation. Among the three members of the Sorbs family of adapter molecules, which include CAP (Sorbs1), ArgBP2 (Sorbs2), and Vinexin (Sorbs3), CAP consistently down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and myeloid-derived leukocytes, after Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Upon the same TLR stimulation, ArgBP2 partially down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in mouse fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, while Vinexin rather promoted their production. Mechanistically, CAP limited pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by suppressing the phosphorylation of Inhibitor of kappa B (I\u03baB) kinase (I\u03ba\u03ba)-\u03b1 and I\u03ba\u03ba-\u03b2 and their downstream NF-\u03baB-dependent signalling pathway. Molecular affinity between CAP and I\u03ba\u03ba-\u03b1/ I\u03ba\u03ba-\u03b2 was necessary to block the NF-\u03baB pathway. The CAP-dependent inhibitory mechanism - in vivo exclusively IL-6 inhibition - was confirmed after collecting blood from mice with systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in the heart tissue collected from mice infected with the cardiotropic Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Taken together, CAP down-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the normal function of the NF-\u03baB pathway.

However, no further analysis for gene regulation has been performed in target tissues of model mice during hACE2 overproduction. To characterize changes in global gene expression in the hearts and kidneys of rtTA/hACE2 double transgenic (dTg) mice in response to hACE2 overexpression, total RNA extracted from these tissues from dTg mice after doxycycline (Dox) treatment was hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays. Briefly, dTg mice were generated by cross-mating p\u03b1-MHC/rtTA Tg mice with pTRE/hACE2 Tg mice. The expression level of hACE2 protein was determined to be high in hearts, kidneys, and brains of dTg mice, whereas lung, liver, and testis tissues expressed low levels. The level of hACE2 was significantly enhanced in hearts and kidneys of the Dox+dTg group compared to that in Vehicle+dTg mice although consistent levels of mouse ACE2 (mACE2) remained in the same tissues. Based on the microarray analysis of heart tissue, 385 genes were differentially expressed, including 168 upregulated and 217 downregulated, when comparing non-Tg and Vehicle+dTg mice, whereas 216 genes were differentially expressed, including 136 upregulated and 80 downregulated, between Vehicle+dTg and Dox+dTg mice. In the kidneys, 402 genes were differentially expressed, including 159 upregulated and 243 downregulated, between non-Tg and Vehicle+dTg mice. Dox-treated dTg mice exhibited the differential expression of 4735 genes including 1636 upregulated and 3109 downregulated. Taken together, these findings suggested that several functional groups and individual genes can be considered biomarkers that respond to hACE2 overexpression in dTg mice. Moreover, our results provided a lot of useful information to predict physiological responses when these dTg mice are applied as a susceptible model for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV, COVID-19) in both vaccine and drug development.", "journal": "Laboratory animal research", "date": "2020-08-01", "authors": ["Su HaeLee", "Seung WanJee", "Dae YounHwang", "Jong KooKang"], "doi": "10.1186/s42826-020-00056-y"}

However, serum concentrations of T3 and T4 are often normal or subclinically low, necessitating an alternative serum biomarker for low cardiac TH function to guide treatment of these patients. The clinical literature suggests that serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels are inversely associated with serum triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) levels. The objective of this study was to investigate BNP as a potential serum biomarker for TH function in the heart.\nTwo animal models of thyroid hormone deficiency: (1) 8-weeks of propyl thiouracil-induced hypothyroidism (Hypo) in adult female rats were subsequently treated with oral T3 (10 \u03bcg/kg/d) for 3, 6, or 14 days; (2) HF induced by coronary artery ligation (myocardial infarction, MI) in adult female rats was treated daily with low dose oral T3 (5 \u03bcg/kg/d) for 8 or 16 wks.\nSix days of T3 treatment of Hypo rats normalized most cardiac functional parameters. Serum levels of BNP increased 5-fold in Hypo rats, while T3 treatment normalized BNP by day 14, showing a significant inverse relationship between serum BNP and free or total T3 concentrations. Myocardial BNP mRNA was increased 2.5-fold in Hypo rats and its expression was decreased to normal values by 14 days of T3 treatment. Measurements of hemodynamic function showed significant dysfunction in MI rats after 16 weeks, with serum BNP increased by 4.5-fold and serum free and total T3 decreased significantly. Treatment with T3 decreased serum BNP while increasing total T3 indicating an inverse correlation between these two biologic factors (\nResults from the two models of TH dysfunction confirmed an inverse relationship between tissue and serum T3 and BNP, such that the reduction in serum BNP could potentially be utilized to monitor efficacy and dosing of T3 treatment.

Macrophages and cardiomyocytes are two cell types in which the MR plays a central role in the cardiac tissue response to injury, renovascular hypertension and oxidative stress for example. Macrophages are critical for resolution of tissue injury and wound healing and their pleiotropic actions are central to the development of many forms of heart, renal and vascular disease.

Studies have demonstrated the ability of stem cells to both generate cardiac tissues in vitro and aid in the recovery of cardiovascular function in vivo in animal models. However, the long-term efficacy of stem cells as regenerative therapy is still unknown. Exploration of alternative therapies is underway, including the use of cardiac growth factor neuregulin-1 (NRG-1). Research has demonstrated that NRG-1 not only has direct effects on cardiomyocytes (CM) but also acts within the tissues supporting the CM. Transplantation of NRG-1 into ischemic cardiac tissue mitigates the progression of heart failure and can reverse cardiac remodeling.

{"title": "Identifying the key regulators that promote cell-cycle activity in the hearts of early neonatal pigs after myocardial injury.", "abstract": "Mammalian cardiomyocytes exit the cell cycle shortly after birth. As a result, an occurrence of coronary occlusion-induced myocardial infarction often results in heart failure, postinfarction LV dilatation, or death, and represents one of the most significant public health morbidities worldwide. Interestingly however, the hearts of neonatal pigs have been shown to regenerate following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) occuring on postnatal day 1 (P1); a recovery period which is accompanied by an increased expression of markers for cell-cycle activity, and suggests that early postnatal myocardial regeneration may be driven in part by the MI-induced proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. In this study, we identified signaling pathways known to regulate the cell cycle, and determined of these, the pathways persistently upregulated in response to MI injury. We identified five pathways (mitogen associated protein kinase [MAPK], Hippo, cyclic [cAMP], Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription [JAK-STAT], and Ras) which were comprehensively upregulated in cardiac tissues collected on day 7 (P7) and/or P28 of the P1 injury hearts. Several of the initiating master regulators (e.g., CSF1/CSF1R, TGFB, and NPPA) and terminal effector molecules (e.g., ATF4, FOS, RELA/B, ITGB2, CCND1/2/3, PIM1, RAF1, MTOR, NKF1B) in these pathways were persistently upregulated at day 7 through day 28, suggesting there exists at least some degree of regenerative activity up to 4 weeks following MI at P1.

Due to the rarity of this condition, additional studies and case reports are required to better understand and manage late-onset neonatal lupus cardiomyopathies.\nA 4-week-old female, born to a mother with known anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La autoantibodies, presents with classic cutaneous manifestations for neonatal lupus and is found to have left bundle branch block, severely dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%, and a thin echogenic dyskinetic ventricular septum.

Because ATTR often presents as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), it has been largely underdiagnosed. Once considered incurable with a grave prognosis, ATTR cardiomyopathy has seen the development of promising alternatives for diagnosis and treatment, with early diagnosis and treatment of ATTR cardiomyopathy highly beneficial due to its high mortality rate. For instance, diagnosing ATTR cardiomyopathy previously required a cardiac biopsy, but new modalities, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and radionuclide bone scans, show promise in accurately diagnosing ATTR cardiomyopathy. Ongoing research and clinical trials have focused on identifying new treatments which primarily target amyloid fiber formation by inhibiting TTR gene expression, stabilizing the TTR tetramer, preventing oligomer aggregation, or affecting degradation of amyloid fibers. In this review, we describe the advances made in the diagnosis and treatment of ATTR in order to increase awareness of the disease and encourage a lower threshold for ATTR workup.

{"title": "Three-dimensional scaffold-free microtissues engineered for cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), persist as the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The limited regenerative capacity of the myocardium presents significant challenges specifically for the treatment of MI and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). Traditional therapeutic approaches mainly rely on limiting the induced damage or the stress on the remaining viable myocardium through pharmacological regulation of remodeling mechanisms, rather than replacement or regeneration of the injured tissue. The emerging alternative regenerative medicine-based approaches have focused on restoring the damaged myocardial tissue with newly engineered functional and bioinspired tissue units. Cardiac regenerative medicine approaches can be broadly categorized into three groups: cell-based therapies, scaffold-based cardiac tissue engineering, and scaffold-free cardiac tissue engineering. Despite significant advancements, however, the clinical translation of these approaches has been critically hindered by two key obstacles for successful structural and functional replacement of the damaged myocardium, namely: poor engraftment of engineered tissue into the damaged cardiac muscle and weak electromechanical coupling of transplanted cells with the native tissue. To that end, the integration of micro- and nanoscale technologies along with recent advancements in stem cell technologies have opened new avenues for engineering of structurally mature and highly functional scaffold-based (SB-CMTs) and scaffold-free cardiac microtissues (SF-CMTs) with enhanced cellular organization and electromechanical coupling for the treatment of MI and HF.

The implantation of the MSC loaded BG/\u03b3-PGA/CS composite hydrogel in the mice AMI model showed a significant improvement in the therapeutic efficacy with improved cardiac function, attenuation of heart remodeling, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and accelerated vascularization. The in vitro cell experiments demonstrated that the BG/\u03b3-PGA/CS hydrogel activated the intercellular interaction between MSCs and CMs, which resulted in reduced cell apoptosis and enhanced angiogenesis.

Limitations to these applications still exist due in part to the need for more robust structural support, organization, and electromechanical function of engineered cardiac tissues. It is well accepted that heterotypic cellular interactions impact the phenotype of cardiomyocytes. The current study evaluates the functional effects of coculturing adult human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs) in 3D engineered tissues on excitation and contraction with the goal of recapitulating healthy, nonarrhythmogenic myocardium in vitro. A small population (5% of total cell number) of hCFs in tissues improves tissue formation, material properties, and contractile function. However, two perturbations to the hCF population create disease-like phenotypes in engineered cardiac tissues. First, increasing the percentage of hCFs to 15% resulted in tissues with increased ectopic activity and spontaneous excitation rate. Second, hCFs undergo myofibroblast activation in traditional two-dimensional culture, and this altered phenotype ablated the functional benefits of hCFs when incorporated into engineered cardiac tissues. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that human cardiac fibroblast number and activation state modulate electromechanical function of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes and that a low percentage of quiescent hCFs are a valuable cell source to advance a healthy electromechanical response of engineered cardiac tissue for regenerative medicine applications.", "journal": "Stem cells international", "date": "2020-07-30", "authors": ["Cassady ERupert", "Tae YunKim", "Bum-RakChoi", "Kareen L KCoulombe"], "doi": "10.1155/2020/9363809\n10.3390/ijms18091873\n10.1089/scd.2014.0533\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.023\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131446\n10.1016/J.BIOMATERIALS.2018.01.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306985\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1089/TEN.TEA.2010.0557\n10.1089/TEN.TEA.2011.0278\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.757286\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0044\n10.3892/br.2015.522\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.57\n10.1016/0022-2828(89)91498-3\n10.1016/0022-2828(92)93383-U\n10.1186/scrt403\n10.1253/circj.CJ-16-1003\n10.1161/01.RES.0000214537.44195.a3\n10.1152/ajpcell.1992.263.5.C959\n10.1093/cvr/cvx163\n10.1073/pnas.1611184114\n10.1007/s12195-016-0462-7\n10.1007/s10439-017-1841-5\n10.1186/1471-2105-9-482\n10.1242/jcs.03340\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0068\n10.1155/2017/7648409\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.10.003\n10.1002/jcb.21154\n10.1007/BF00585633\n10.1007/BF00925930\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.12.021\n10.1161/01.RES.0000122382.19400.14\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.01.027\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2006.09.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0036\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2016.0257\n10.1136/hrt.80.3.251\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00795.x\n10.1113/expphysiol.1994.sp003819\n10.1165/rcmb.2012-0050OC\n10.1126/sciadv.aao4881\n10.1016/S0014-4827(02)00015-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0086865\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0169\n10.1016/0022-2828(80)90080-2\n10.1161/01.RES.0000143901.37063.2f\n10.1371/journal.pgen.0020119\n10.1113/jphysiol.2007.144121\n10.1038/s41598-019-45078-2\n10.1023/A:1007992824966\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.006\n10.1038/cddiscovery.2017.38\n10.1016/0735-1097(92)90122-4\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31820cda19\n10.1093/cvr/cvq329\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.005\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31821209ee\n10.1016/j.carpath.2009.12.002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00341.2009\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.04.005\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01306"}

From this analysis we chose to focus, as proof of principle, on two miRNAs from the miR-125 family, miR-125a and miR-351, and two of their potential mRNA targets, Xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein 1 (", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["Allison LesherWilliams", "Vedbar SKhadka", "Ma C TAnagaran", "KatieLee", "AbigailAvelar", "YoupingDeng", "Ralph VShohet"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00041.2020\n10.1073/pnas.1401724111\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072278\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011693\n10.1038/ejhg.2015.125\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2009.01.009\n10.1186/1471-2164-13-552\n10.1159/000268088\n10.1074/mcp.M113.027649\n10.1093/bib/bby054\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05042.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvw031\n10.1007/s11010-015-2598-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00472.2006\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300137\n10.1038/s41580-018-0045-7\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.108883\n10.1007/s00335-005-0120-1\n10.1161/JAHA.117.006320\n10.1126/science.1059796\n10.1242/jcs.158451\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.05.006\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2016.09.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0216610\n10.1016/j.yrtph.2016.03.005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.09.012\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.958975\n10.1101/gad.991402\n10.1159/000443095\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.034\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.018\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1074/jbc.RA119.010315\n10.14806/ej.17.1.200\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.08.013\n10.1152/physrev.00014.2006\n10.1073/pnas.1922650117\n10.1093/nar/gkt393\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.3390/ijms17121987\n10.1038/nrd.2016.246\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.021\n10.1186/1756-8722-6-6\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.12.012\n10.1093/cvr/cvw259\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151127\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.08.043\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq013\n10.1038/ncomms8916\n10.1038/ncomms1770\n10.1016/B978-0-12-800180-6.00003-7\n10.2741/4072\n10.1007/978-1-4939-6866-4_10\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.08.004\n10.1016/j.jacep.2018.03.006\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00130.2017\n10.1152/ajpheart.00617.2018\n10.1002/ejhf.223\n10.1038/s41418-018-0063-1\n10.1016/j.cmet.2010.03.001\n10.1111/jcmm.13880\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.10.108\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.096\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079805\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.04.003"}

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of thymol against adrenaline-induced myocardial injury in rats.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease represents a vital global disease burden. This study aims to assess the possible cardioprotective effect of thymol against adrenaline-induced myocardial injury (MI) in rats. Furthermore the effect of thymol on cardiac function biomarkers, electrocardiogram (ECG) alterations, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and histopathological changes was assessed. MI was induced by adrenaline (2 mg/kg, s.c.) injected as a single dose for 2 consecutive days (24 h apart). Normal and control groups received the vehicle for 21 consecutive days. The other 3 groups were orally administered thymol (15, 30, 60 mg/kg) for 21 consecutive days and on day 22, adrenaline was injected as a single dose for 2 consecutive days. Then ECG examination, biochemical, histopathological, immunohistochemical analyses were carried out. Thymol reversed adrenaline-induced reduction of heart rate, prolongation of RR interval and elevation of ST interval. Thymol pretreatment significantly reduced serum aspartate dehydrogenase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) levels in MI rats. Oral pretreatment with thymol increased reduced glutathione (GSH), reduced malondialdehyde (MDA), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) cardiac contents in MI rats. Additionally, thymol administration significantly decreased protein expression of caspase-3, increased Bcl-2 protein expression in cardiac tissue and ameliorated histopathological changes. This study reveals that thymol exerted cardioprotective effect against adrenaline-induced MI in rats evidenced by improving cardiac function, attenuating ECG and histopathological changes which may be partly mediated through its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effect.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["Salma AEl-Marasy", "Sally AEl Awdan", "AzzaHassan", "Heba M IAbdallah"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04431"}

A major adverse effect is acute cardiotoxicity; yet, its mechanism has not been elucidated. Fucoidan is a multifunctional and nontoxic polysaccharide that is widely studied because of its favorable biological activities and safety. Hence, we proposed that fucoidan may play a protective role in DOX-induced acute cardiotoxicity without causing additional side effects. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with a single high dose of DOX to induce acute cardiac injury. Fucoidan was administered orally before DOX injection and AG490, a JAK2 inhibitor, was applied to verify the participation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In vitro, H9C2 cells were treated with the same drugs at different concentrations and intervention times. in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that DOX administration induced myocardial damage accompanied by acceleratory apoptosis and deficient autophagy in heart tissues or cells, which could be significantly improved by fucoidan supplement. AG490 partly abolished the cardioprotective effects of fucoidan, suggesting the involvement of JAK2 signaling. Additionally, western blotting revealed DOX-induced JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation, which was enhanced by fucoidan and weaken by AG490. Hence, fucoidan exerted a favorable effect on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by enhancing autophagy and suppressing apoptosis in a JAK2/STAT3-dependent manner, which may provide a promising and novel therapeutic strategy against negative chemotherapy-induced effects.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["JieZhang", "ZhenzhuSun", "NaLin", "WenqiangLu", "XingxiaoHuang", "JingfanWeng", "ShiminSun", "ChuanjingZhang", "QiYang", "GuozhongZhou", "HangyuanGuo", "JufangChi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110534"}

Studies have shown its association with molecular mechanisms related to cardiomyocytes redox balance. However, the microstructure and ultrastructure of cardiac tissue, as well as the activity of its antioxidant defenses front of disturbances in the mineral bioavailability induced by arsenic are still scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate if arsenic exposure might induce structural and ultrastructural damages in cardiac tissue, including pathological remodeling of the parenchyma and stroma. Moreover, its impact on micromineral distribution and antioxidant enzymes activity in heart tissue was also evaluated.\nAdult male Wistar rats were divided into three groups that received 0, 1 and 10\u00a0mg/L sodium arsenite in drinking water for eight weeks. The hearts were collected and subjected to structural and ultrastructural analysis, mineral microanalysis and antioxidant enzymes quantification. Functional markers of cardiac damages were evaluated using serum samples.\nArsenic exposure induced dose-dependent structural and ultrastructural remodeling of cardiac tissue, with parenchyma loss, increase of stroma components, collagen deposition, and pathological damages such as inflammation, sarcomere disorganization, mitochondria degeneration and myofilament dissociation. Moreover, this metalloid was bioaccumulated in the tissue affecting its micromineral content, which resulted in antioxidant imbalance and increased levels of oxidative stress and cardiac markers.\nTaken together, our findings indicate that the heart is a potential target to arsenic toxicity, and long-term exposure to this metalloid must be avoided, once it might induce several cardiac tissue pathologies.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["Ana Cl\u00e1udia FerreiraSouza", "John Lennonde Paiva Coimbra", "Luiz Ot\u00e1vio Guimar\u00e3esErvilha", "Daniel Silva SenaBastos", "Jamile Fernanda SilvaCossolin", "Elizi\u00e1ria CardosoSantos", "Leandro Licurside Oliveira", "MarianaMachado-Neves"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118132"}

To understand the inter-strain cellular and molecular mechanisms of radiation sensitivity, adult males of two strains of minipig, one with higher radiosensitivity, the Gottingen minipig (GMP), and another strain with comparatively lower radiosensitivity, the Sinclair minipig (SMP), were exposed to total body irradiation (TBI). Since Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling is associated with radiation sensitivity and regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis, we investigated the link between dysregulation of cardiac IGF-1 signaling and radiosensitivity.

{"title": "The Regulatory Role of T Cell Responses in Cardiac Remodeling Following Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Ischemic injury to the heart causes cardiomyocyte and supportive tissue death that result in adverse remodeling and formation of scar tissue at the site of injury. The dying cardiac tissue secretes a variety of cytokines and chemokines that trigger an inflammatory response and elicit the recruitment and activation of cardiac immune cells to the injury site. Cell-based therapies for cardiac repair have enhanced cardiac function in the injured myocardium, but the mechanisms remain debatable. In this review, we will focus on the interactions between the adoptively transferred stem cells and the post-ischemic environment, including the active components of the immune/inflammatory response that can mediate cardiac outcome after ischemic injury. In particular, we highlight how the adaptive immune cell response can mediate tissue repair following cardiac injury. Several cell-based studies have reported an increase in pro-reparative T cell subsets after stem cell transplantation. Paracrine factors secreted by stem cells polarize T cell subsets partially by exogenous ubiquitination, which can induce differentiation of T cell subset to promote tissue repair after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the mechanism behind the polarization of different subset after stem cell transplantation remains poorly understood. In this review, we will summarize the current status of immune cells within the heart post-MI with an emphasis on T cell mediated reparative response after ischemic injury.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["TabitoKino", "MohsinKhan", "SadiaMohsin"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21145013\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu299\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.01.073\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1038/nri3800\n10.1002/dvdy.10239\n10.1161/01.RES.82.4.458\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.044164\n10.3109/08916934.2011.647134\n10.1172/JCI123859\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.116.003688\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.00639\n10.1056/NEJMoa070829\n10.3390/cells9020295\n10.1152/ajpheart.00401.2012\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00434-5\n10.1007/s00011-017-1060-4\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.10.002\n10.1186/1755-1536-5-15\n10.1016/j.cyto.2014.09.011\n10.1073/pnas.1621047114\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.649244\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.04.023\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.03.040\n10.1016/j.clim.2008.01.009\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz516\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.02.079\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.863\n10.1161/JAHA.112.004408\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2009.06.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.00928.2007\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.08.005\n10.1016/j.clim.2011.07.003\n10.1097/01.mca.0000236288.94553.b4\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs263\n10.4049/jimmunol.0903681\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1261\n10.1152/ajpheart.00112.2019\n10.1038/s41586-019-1546-z\n10.1073/pnas.1015623108\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00198\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303895\n10.1038/s41467-018-04908-z\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.05.009\n10.1016/j.immuni.2009.04.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304072\n10.1042/CS20140672\n10.1152/ajpheart.00328.2014\n10.1159/000355303\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300521\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.03.011\n10.1038/cr.2016.40\n10.1128/MCB.00467-07\n10.1073/pnas.1007098108\n10.1152/ajpheart.00654.2018\n10.1074/jbc.M110.103408\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.09.012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036053\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx393\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000509\n10.1161/01.RES.83.1.15\n10.1161/01.RES.0000135902.99383.6f\n10.1007/s00392-011-0327-y\n10.1002/jcb.20886\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2004.03.034\n10.1002/jcb.23119\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.03.007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307654\n10.1093/cvr/cvz040\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.012\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03874.x\n10.3349/ymj.2017.58.5.1031\n10.3109/08820139.2011.607877\n10.1038/mt.2015.44\n10.1007/s00125-015-3808-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301202\n10.1152/ajpheart.00144.2019\n10.1002/stem.2054\n10.1084/jem.184.3.1101\n10.1096/fj.06-6558com\n10.1189/jlb.3RU0316-144R\n10.1073/pnas.91.9.3652\n10.1161/01.RES.0000163017.13772.3a\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.02.051\n10.1001/jama.2012.25321\n10.1016/j.healun.2014.02.009\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.092627\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.08.724\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303180\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007412\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310712"}

A total of 58\u00a0significantly differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in the db/db sample. Among these, six upregulated circRNAs and seven downregulated circRNAs were detected by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR and analyzed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Furthermore, based on the predicted binding site with microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in DCM, five circRNAs (mmu_circ_0000652, mmu_circ_0000547, mmu_circ_0001058, mmu_circ_0000680 and novel_circ_0004285) were shown to serve as competing endogenous (ce)RNAs. The corresponding miRNAs and mRNAs of the ceRNAs were also verified, and two promising circRNA\u2011miRNA\u2011mRNA regulatory networks were determined. Finally, internal ribosome entry site prediction combined with open reading frame prediction indicated that it was highly possible that mmu_circ_0001160 encoded a protein. In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of the circRNA expression profile during the early phase of DCM was performed, and two promising circRNA\u2011miRNA\u2011mRNA regulatory networks were identified.

{"title": "Identification of potential biomarkers for predicting the early onset of diabetic cardiomyopathy in a mouse model.", "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by metabolic derangements that cause a shift in substrate preference, inducing cardiac interstitial fibrosis. Interstitial fibrosis plays a key role in aggravating left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), which has previously been associated with the asymptomatic onset of heart failure. The latter is responsible for 80% of deaths among diabetic patients and has been termed diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Through in silico prediction and subsequent detection in a leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice model (db/db), we confirmed the presence of previously identified potential biomarkers to detect the early onset of DCM. Differential expression of Lysyl Oxidase Like 2 (LOXL2) and Electron Transfer Flavoprotein Beta Subunit (ETF\u03b2), in both serum and heart tissue of 6-16-week-old db/db mice, correlated with a reduced left-ventricular diastolic dysfunction as assessed by high-resolution Doppler echocardiography. Principal component analysis of the combined biomarkers, LOXL2 and ETF\u03b2, further displayed a significant difference between wild type and db/db mice from as early as 9\u00a0weeks of age. Knockdown in H9c2 cells, utilising siRNA of either LOXL2 or ETF\u03b2, revealed a decrease in the expression of Collagen Type I Alpha1 (COL1A1), a marker known to contribute to enhanced myocardial fibrosis. Additionally, receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis of the proposed diagnostic profile showed that the combination of LOXL2 and ETF\u03b2 resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.813, with a cut-off point of 0.824, thus suggesting the favorable positive predictive power of the model and further supporting the use of LOXL2 and ETF\u03b2 as possible early predictive DCM biomarkers.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-07-25", "authors": ["RabiaJohnson", "XolisaNxele", "MartinCour", "NonhlakaniphoSangweni", "TraceyJooste", "NkanyisoHadebe", "EbrahimSamodien", "MongiBenjeddou", "MikatekoMazino", "JohanLouw", "SandrineLecour"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-69254-x\n10.1016/0002-9149(72)90595-4\n10.1186/s13098-017-0225-1\n10.1007/s10741-012-9313-3\n10.1161/circulationaha.106.679597\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.03.013\n10.1210/er.2003-0012\n10.3904/kjim.2016.208\n10.1038/nrcardio.2010.165\n10.1186/s12933-017-0506-x\n10.1155/2016/6143129\n10.1186/1475-2840-9-89\n10.1038/ncomms13710\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.02.012\n10.1074/mcp.M700478-MCP200\n10.1155/2013/461967\n10.1007/s11906-004-0035-3\n10.1016/S0026-0495(00)90588-2\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.07.063\n10.1007/s00380-017-0978-3\n10.1111/jdi.12250\n10.1152/ajpheart.00238.2018\n10.1093/cvr/cvv214\n10.1080/1061186x.2018.1550649\n10.18388/abp.2014_1898\n10.2337/db07-0481\n10.1007/s10549-017-4497-9\n10.1186/s12933-015-0173-8\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2011.08.003\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2012.09.012\n10.1002/mnfr.201500656"}

In this study, scaffold fabrication from the solubilized cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) accompanied with alginate and chitosan for CTE was carried out. The influence of blending ratios on chemical and physical properties of the scaffolds including FTIR spectroscopy, porosity, pore size, and their mechanical properties were investigated. The porosity of scaffolds was more than 96% with very high swelling rate while maintaining their stability in PBS solution. Blending ECM with chitosan and alginate significantly improve the tensile strength of ECM. FTIR spectrum of scaffolds demonstrated interaction of solubilized ECM with two opposite-charged polysaccharides. The proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on the ternary scaffolds using MTS assay, revealed that blending ECM with polysaccharides at ratio of 75: 25 (E75/P25) led to improve the proliferation of hMSCs on scaffolds. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed the porous structure and the presence of hMSCs cells inside the pores. In addition, histological analysis confirmed that cardiomyocyte penetration inside scaffolds after 7\u00a0days of culture.

The rats were divided into four groups with eight rats each: Group I, control group; Group II, ischemia group; Group III, I/R group; Group IV, I/R + iloprost group. Surgical intervention was performed in each group and after the procedures, heart tissues were obtained and examined histopathologically. Results No significant pathological finding was found in Group I and II while degeneration of muscle fibers and interstitial edema was observed in group III and dilation of the vessels was detected in Group IV.

LMNA mutations predominantly affect mesoderm-derived cell lineages in diseases collectively termed as laminopathies that include dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, different forms of muscular dystrophies, and premature aging syndromes as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome. At present, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating tissue-specific manifestations of laminopathies are still limited.\nTo gain deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of a novel LMNA splice-site mutation (c.357-2A\u2009>\u2009G) in an affected family with cardiac disease, we conducted deep RNA sequencing and pathway analysis for nine fibroblast samples obtained from three patients with cardiomyopathy, three unaffected family members, and three unrelated, unaffected individuals. We validated our findings by quantitative PCR and protein studies.\nWe identified eight significantly differentially expressed genes between the mutant and non-mutant fibroblasts, that included downregulated insulin growth factor binding factor protein 5 (IGFBP5) in patient samples. Pathway analysis showed involvement of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway consistent with previous studies. We found no significant differences in gene expression for Lamin A/C and B-type lamins between the groups. In mutant fibroblasts, RNA-seq confirmed that only the LMNA wild type allele predominately was expressed, and Western Blot showed normal Lamin A/C protein levels.\nIGFBP5 may contribute in maintaining signaling pathway homeostasis, which may lead to the absence of notable molecular and structural abnormalities in unaffected tissues such as fibroblasts. Compensatory mechanisms from other nuclear membrane proteins were not found. Our results also demonstrate that only one copy of the wild type allele is sufficient for normal levels of Lamin A/C protein to maintain physiological function in an unaffected cell type. This suggests that affected cell types such as cardiac tissues may be more sensitive to haploinsufficiency of Lamin A/C. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of disease with a possible explanation for the tissue specificity of LMNA-related dilated cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "BMC medical genetics", "date": "2020-07-24", "authors": ["Halida PWidyastuti", "Trina MNorden-Krichmar", "AnnaGrosberg", "Michael VZaragoza"], "doi": "10.1186/s12881-020-01088-w"}
{"title": "Angiotensin-(1-7) Improves Integrated Cardiometabolic Function in Aged Mice.", "abstract": "Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) is a beneficial renin-angiotensin system (RAS) hormone that elicits protective cardiometabolic effects in young animal models of hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The impact of Ang-(1-7) on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes during aging, however, remains unexplored. This study tested the hypothesis that Ang-(1-7) attenuates age-related elevations in blood pressure and insulin resistance in mice. Young adult (two-month-old) and aged (16-month-old) male C57BL/6J mice received Ang-(1-7) (400 ng/kg/min) or saline for six-weeks via a subcutaneous osmotic mini-pump. Arterial blood pressure and metabolic function indices (body composition, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance) were measured at the end of treatment. Adipose and cardiac tissue masses and cardiac RAS, sympathetic and inflammatory marker gene expression were also measured. We found that chronic Ang-(1-7) treatment decreased systolic and mean blood pressure, with a similar trend for diastolic blood pressure. Ang-(1-7) also improved insulin sensitivity in aged mice to levels in young mice, without effects on glucose tolerance or body composition. The blood pressure-lowering effects of Ang-(1-7) in aged mice were associated with reduced sympathetic outflow to the heart. These findings suggest Ang-(1-7) may provide a novel pharmacological target to improve age-related cardiometabolic risk.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-07-24", "authors": ["Amanda JMiller", "Sarah SBingaman", "DarrenMehay", "DanielaMedina", "Amy CArnold"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21145131\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246876\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.01.001\n10.1016/S0002-9149(01)02321-9\n10.1007/s10286-018-0572-5\n10.1016/j.tips.2011.07.006\n10.1186/s13293-019-0247-5\n10.1038/hr.2012.161\n10.1093/ndt/12.6.1093\n10.2165/00002512-200623020-00004\n10.1016/j.cger.2009.01.007\n10.1097/00004872-200209000-00035\n10.1152/ajpendo.00281.2018\n10.1016/j.phrs.2012.05.001\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000035396.27909.40\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31821324b6\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.06.014\n10.1152/physrev.00023.2016\n10.1093/ajh/hpz146\n10.1152/ajpheart.00937.2006\n10.1152/ajpendo.90678.2008\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06935\n10.1016/j.peptides.2014.07.002\n10.1152/ajpheart.01145.2002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00768.2016\n10.1177/1470320318789332\n10.1155/2016/6731093\n10.1016/j.metabol.2019.154048\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.106.086587\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000073843.56046.45\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.155895\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00407.x\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00601.2003\n10.1186/s13293-016-0110-x\n10.1155/2012/192567\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01847\n10.1152/ajpheart.00803.2009\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.149815\n10.1016/j.amjhyper.2007.02.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312806\n10.1186/s13098-020-0523-x\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.200493\n10.1186/s13293-019-0251-9\n10.2337/db12-0792\n10.1042/CS20190573\n10.1210/en.2016-1247\n10.1016/j.peptides.2014.07.023\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142512\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000242642.42177.49\n10.1152/ajpendo.00192.2017\n10.1161/01.HYP.34.2.296\n10.1161/01.HYP.29.1.394"}

The use of new biomaterials with enhanced biological and physical properties has opened the door to new approaches in cardiovascular applications. Elastin-based materials are biomaterials with some of the most promising properties. Indeed, these biomaterials have started to yield good results in cardiovascular and angiogenesis applications. In this review, we explore the latest trends in elastin-derived materials for cardiac regeneration and the different possibilities that are being explored by researchers to regenerate an infarcted muscle and restore its normal function. Elastin-based materials can be processed in different manners to create injectable systems or hydrogel scaffolds that can be applied by simple injection or as patches to cover the damaged area and regenerate it. Such materials have been applied to directly regenerate the damaged cardiac muscle and to create complex structures, such as heart valves or new bio-stents that could help to restore the normal function of the heart or to minimize damage after a stroke. We will discuss the possibilities that elastin-based materials offer in cardiac tissue engineering, either alone or in combination with other biomaterials, in order to illustrate the wide range of options that are being explored. Moreover, although tremendous advances have been achieved with such elastin-based materials, there is still room for new approaches that could trigger advances in cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2020-07-23", "authors": ["IsraelGonzalez de Torre", "MatildeAlonso", "Jose-CarlosRodriguez-Cabello"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2020.00657\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.081\n10.1039/b919452p\n10.1002/bdrc.21016\n10.1002/adfm.201300570\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aai7466\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.43\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx391\n10.1055/s-0034-1383430\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.07.014\n10.1097/00000658-195203000-00006\n10.1097/00000658-195409000-00008\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00054\n10.1056/NEJM196611172752002\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.10.069\n10.1042/bj.3180149\n10.1042/bj3230863u\n10.1074/jbc.270.30.17778\n10.1042/BA20030105\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.10.017\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.06.024\n10.1039/C3BM60293A\n10.1152/ajpheart.1997.273.5.H2091\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.014\n10.1681/ASN.2015040346\n10.4172/2157-7552.S11-003\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.10.010\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0394\n10.1021/acs.biomac.8b01211\n10.1021/bi0610092\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057\n10.1093/rb/rbz003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.06.025\n10.1073/pnas.0505047102\n10.1001/archsurg.1958.01290040061008\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.10.029\n10.1002/chem.200800180\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.09.082\n10.1002/9783527689934.ch13\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.10.016\n10.1002/mabi.201800147\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00340\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0018\n10.1007/s10856-019-6232-z\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2018.06.026\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab10a5\n10.1161/01.ATV.12.9.1008\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01409-5\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.03.002\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.03.027\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.006\n10.1039/C6BM00300A\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2009.11.006\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00294-1\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034102\n10.1083/jcb.126.2.563\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00220\n10.1163/156856201753252516\n10.21037/jtd.2017.12.92\n10.1002/term.2562\n10.1002/ajmg.1320340115\n10.1126/science.276.5317.1423\n10.1055/s-2001-17807\n10.1002/jbm.b.30247\n10.1088/1748-605X/aa6eb6\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.020\n10.1098/rsif.2010.0223\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.02.017\n10.1055/s-0030-1268970\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.060\n10.1038/nm1364\n10.1056/NEJMc071536\n10.1038/nrdp.2016.6\n10.1089/ten.teb.2017.0350\n10.1126/science.1247663\n10.3389/fbioe.2015.00045\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.08.001\n10.1242/dev.093500\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.10.018\n10.1002/adhm.201600300\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00046\n10.1136/hrt.2005.086934\n10.1016/j.addr.2012.03.009\n10.1093/ejcts/ezr221\n10.1016/0021-9150(92)90132-Z\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/4/045009\n10.1093/rb/rby022\n10.1016/j.matbio.2013.04.003\n10.1007/s10439-016-1605-7\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.009\n10.1242/jcs.01613\n10.1016/j.addr.2018.03.003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00564.2004\n10.1586/14779072.6.5.669\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-061008-124903\n10.12688/f1000research.15096.1\n10.1533/9780857097033.1.3\n10.1016/0003-4975(95)00263-K\n10.1182/blood.V97.8.2323\n10.1038/376062a0\n10.1109/IEMBS.2005.1615574\n10.1016/S1010-7940(03)00094-0\n10.1161/01.CIR.102.suppl_3.III-22\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx772\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.047\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.07.048\n10.1002/adma.200990152\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.12.044\n10.1007/s13239-011-0039-5\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0550\n10.1021/bi034837t\n10.1080/07391102.1992.10508661\n10.1002/bip.360290419\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0263\n10.2459/JCM.0b013e3283117d37\n10.1016/j.jvs.2012.02.030\n10.1038/s41467-017-00418-6\n10.1177/10454411910020030301\n10.1021/jp972167t\n10.1002/anie.199308191\n10.1002/bip.360320913\n10.1016/S0300-8932(01)76480-9\n10.1002/jbm.820280310\n10.1016/S0021-9290(97)00122-X\n10.1016/j.matbio.2019.07.005\n10.1093/ejcts/ezt328\n10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2580001.x\n10.1007/s00268-006-0731-z\n10.1002/adhm.201900742\n10.1089/ten.tec.2013.0258\n10.1126/science.2934816\n10.5949/UPO9781846314438\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.07.022\n10.1016/j.biocel.2008.03.017\n10.1021/ma020892i\n10.1016/j.jvs.2013.08.018\n10.1038/ncpcardio0112\n10.1093/icvts/ivs447\n10.1038/421884a\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311213"}

Plumbagin is a major bioactive compound that occurs in the Plumbago indica and P. zeylanica with numerous therapeutic benefits. The current research exploration was planned to investigate the therapeutic role of plumbagin against doxorubicin stimulated cardiotoxicity in rats. The cardiotoxicity was stimulated to the rats by administering the 2.5 mg/kg of doxorubicin for 14\u2009days with concurrent supplementation with plumbagin. The hemodynamic parameters were studied by using the tail-cuff plethysmography. The lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status was examined by the standard procedures. The myocardial function and damage markers were assessed with the help of commercial kits. The expression status of inflammatory markers and PI3K/Akt signaling markers were investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting analysis, respectively. The plumbagin supplementation appreciably regained the body weight and heart weight of the investigational animals. Hemodynamic parameters and antioxidants statuses were escalated by the plumbagin treatment. The severe elevation in the cardiac damage markers and inflammatory markers were noticeably ameliorated by the plumbagin treatment. The plumbagin treatment also assuaged the overexpression of inflammatory and apoptotic proteins in the heart tissues of doxorubicin-challenged rats. The histopathological analysis revealed that the plumbagin appreciably protected the heart tissues from the doxorubicin-induced damages. The findings of this exploration evidenced that plumbagin treatment attenuated the doxorubicin-stimulated cardiotoxicity in rats.", "journal": "Environmental toxicology", "date": "2020-07-22", "authors": ["ZheLi", "ArunachalamChinnathambi", "SulaimanAli Alharbi", "FuyuYin"], "doi": "10.1002/tox.23002"}

However, the effects on GXST on myocardial injury (MI) have not been studied in detail. In these experiments, we found that GXST administration decreased MI-associated ventricular remodeling (VR) with a reduction in interventricular septal thickness in diastole (IVSd), left ventricular posterior wall diameter in systole (LVPWs), and left ventricular posterior wall diameter in diastole (LVPWd) to ameliorate cardiac function and architecture, as measured by echocardiography. Furthermore, histological analysis showed that GXST could ameliorate pathological alterations in the myocardium. And Sirius red staining, wheat germ agglutinin staining and inflammation-related immunohistochemistry results showed that GXST ameliorated the fibrosis areas, cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1). In addition, GXST upregulated intercellular junction proteins (N-cad and Cx-43) and downregulated the angiogenesis-related proteins (PDGF and VEGFA), myocardial fibrosis-related proteins (TGF-\u03b21), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9).

{"title": "Pharmacological activation of CB2 receptor protects against ethanol-induced myocardial injury related to RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis.", "abstract": "Chronic ethanol abuse can lead to harmful consequences for the heart, resulting in systolic dysfunction, variability in the heart rate, arrhythmia, and cardiac remodelling. However, the precise molecular mechanism responsible for ethanol-induced cardiomyopathy is poorly understood. In this regard, the present study aimed to describe the RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-mediated necroptotic cell death that may be involved in ethanol-induced cardiomyopathy and characterize CBR-mediated effects on the signalling pathway and myocardial injury. We performed an ethanol vapour administration experiment to analyse the effects of ethanol on cardiac structure and function in male C57BL/6J mice. Ethanol induced a significant decline in the cardiac structure and function, as evidenced by a decline in ejection fraction and fractional shortening, and an increase in serum Creatine Kinase levels, myocardial collagen content, and inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, ethanol also upregulated the expression levels of necroptosis-related markers such as p-RIP1, p-RIP3, and p-MLKL in the myocardium. Nec-1 treatment exerted significant cardioprotective effects by salvaging the heart tissue, improving the cardiac function, and mitigating inflammation and necroptosis. In addition, ethanol abuse caused an imbalance in the endocannabinoid system and regulated two cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R) in the myocardium. Treatment with selective CB2R agonists, JWH-133 or AM1241, markedly improved the cardiac dysfunction and reduced the ethanol-induced necroptosis in the myocardium. Altogether, our data provide evidence that ethanol abuse-induced cardiotoxicity can possibly be attributed to the RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis. Moreover, pharmacological activation of CB2R may represent a new cardioprotective strategy against ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2020-07-19", "authors": ["XiaochenLiu", "DingangZhang", "XiaoruDong", "RongzheZhu", "YonghongYe", "LiliangLi", "YanJiang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-020-03828-1"}

{"title": "When Stiffness Matters: Mechanosensing in Heart Development and Disease.", "abstract": "During embryonic morphogenesis, the heart undergoes a complex series of cellular phenotypic maturations (e.g., transition of myocytes from proliferative to quiescent or maturation of the contractile apparatus), and this involves stiffening of the extracellular matrix (ECM) acting in concert with morphogenetic signals. The maladaptive remodeling of the myocardium, one of the processes involved in determination of heart failure, also involves mechanical cues, with a progressive stiffening of the tissue that produces cellular mechanical damage, inflammation, and ultimately myocardial fibrosis. The assessment of the biomechanical dependence of the molecular machinery (in myocardial and non-myocardial cells) is therefore essential to contextualize the maturation of the cardiac tissue at early stages and understand its pathologic evolution in aging. Because systems to perform multiscale modeling of cellular and tissue mechanics have been developed, it appears particularly novel to design integrated mechano-molecular models of heart development

{"title": "Nanoparticle-Mediated Drug Delivery for Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease.", "abstract": "The regenerative capacity of an adult cardiac tissue is insufficient to repair the massive loss of heart tissue, particularly cardiomyocytes (CMs), following ischemia or other catastrophic myocardial injuries. The delivery methods of therapeutics agents, such as small molecules, growth factors, exosomes, cells, and engineered tissues have significantly advanced in medical science.

{"title": "A Percutaneous Catheter for In Vivo Hyperspectral Imaging of Cardiac Tissue: Challenges, Solutions and Future Directions.", "abstract": "Multiple studies have shown that spectral analysis of tissue autofluorescence can be used as a live indicator for various pathophysiological states of cardiac tissue, including ischemia, ablation-induced damage, or scar formation. Yet today there are no percutaneous devices that can detect autofluorescence signals from inside a beating heart. Our aim was to develop a prototype catheter to demonstrate the feasibility of doing so.\nHere we summarize technical solutions leading to the development of a percutaneous catheter capable of multispectral imaging of intracardiac surfaces. The process included several iterations of light sources, optical filtering, and image acquisition techniques. The developed system included a compliant balloon, 355 nm laser irradiance, a high-sensitivity CCD, bandpass filtering, and image acquisition synchronized with the cardiac cycle. It enabled us to capture autofluorescence images from multiple spectral bands within the visible range while illuminating the endocardial surface with ultraviolet light. Principal component analysis and other spectral unmixing post-processing algorithms were then used to reveal target tissue.\nBased on the success of our prototype system, we are confident that the development of ever more sensitive cameras, recent advances in tunable filters, fiber bundles, and other optical and computational components makes it possible to create percutaneous catheters capable of acquiring hyper or multispectral hypercubes, including those based on autofluorescence, in real-time.

{"title": "Effect of insulin on natriuretic peptide gene expression in porcine heart.", "abstract": "Gut hormones affect cardiac function and contractility. In this study, we examined whether insulin affects the cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene expression and release of proANP-derived peptides in pigs. Anaesthetized pigs were included in an experimental study comparing the effect of hyperinsulinemia in 15 pigs submitted to two different protocols versus 11 control pigs receiving saline infusion. Phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 was determined by western blotting with a pAkt-Thr308 antibody. The mRNA contents of ANP and BNP were determined with real-time PCR; plasma and cardiac tissue proANP was measured with an immunoluminometric assay targeted against the mid-region of the propeptide and a processing-independent assay. Insulin stimulation increased phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 in both left atrium and left ventricle of porcine hearts (p\u202f<\u202f0.005). No change was observed in ANP and BNP mRNA contents in the right or left atrium. BNP mRNA contents in the left ventricle, however, decreased 3-fold (p\u202f=\u202f0.02) compared to control animals, whereas the BNP mRNA content in the right ventricle as well as ANP mRNA content in the right and left ventricle did not change following hyperinsulinemia. Moreover, the peptide contents did not change in the four cardiac chambers. Finally, proANP concentrations in plasma did not change during the insulin infusion compared to the control animals. These results suggest that insulin does not have direct effect on atrial natriuretic peptide expression but may have a role in the left ventricle.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2020-07-15", "authors": ["DijanaTerzic", "Nora EZois", "IngridHunter", "ChristinaChristoffersen", "PeterPlomgaard", "Lisbeth H\u00f8ierOlsen", "StineRingholm", "HenriettePilegaard", "Jens PGoetze"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2020.170370"}

The postmortem diagnosis and prevention of SCD remain primary challenges in the medical community due to the lack of reliable diagnostic biomarkers. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is a sensitive surface analysis technique for analyzing tissue slices with high spatial resolution. Here, ToF-SIMS followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were employed to study the SCD mouse myocardium samples and obtain high-resolution chemical mappings and mass spectra. Distinction between normal control (NC) and acute \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) activation-induced SCD groups was primarily due to the changes of diacylglycerols (DAG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and sphingomyelin (SM) in positive mode. Meanwhile, chemical mapping of the myocardium showed different lipid distributions in the SCD mouse myocardium. The metabolite alterations in mouse models were further verified by analyzing the heart tissue sections of a 28-year-old woman that died from isoprenaline injection. This pilot study demonstrated the significance of ToF-SIMS in characterizing the lipid variations in SCD heart tissues and might contribute to the postmortem diagnosis of SCD, the discovery of molecule candidates to discriminate the progression of SCD and the understanding of the potential postmortem diagnostic significance of SCD.", "journal": "The Analyst", "date": "2020-07-15", "authors": ["Jia-QianLou", "YueCao", "You-JiaYu", "LiHu", "Zheng-ShengMao", "PingHuang", "XinHua", "FengChen"], "doi": "10.1039/d0an00768d"}

{"title": "Heart failure-induced atrial remodelling promotes electrical and conduction alternans.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is associated with an increased propensity for atrial fibrillation (AF), causing higher mortality than AF or HF alone. It is hypothesized that HF-induced remodelling of atrial cellular and tissue properties promotes the genesis of atrial action potential (AP) alternans and conduction alternans that perpetuate AF. However, the mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility to atrial alternans in HF remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of how HF-induced atrial cellular electrophysiological (with prolonged AP duration) and tissue structural (reduced cell-to-cell coupling caused by atrial fibrosis) remodelling can have an effect on the generation of atrial AP alternans and their conduction at the cellular and one-dimensional (1D) tissue levels. Simulation results showed that HF-induced atrial electrical remodelling prolonged AP duration, which was accompanied by an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content and Ca2+ transient amplitude. Further analysis demonstrated that HF-induced atrial electrical remodelling increased susceptibility to atrial alternans mainly due to the increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) Ca2+ reuptake, modulated by increased phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation, and the decreased transient outward K+ current (Ito). The underlying mechanism has been suggested that the increased SR Ca2+ content and prolonged AP did not fully recover to their previous levels at the end of diastole, resulting in a smaller SR Ca2+ release and AP in the next beat. These produced Ca2+ transient alternans and AP alternans, and further caused AP alternans and Ca2+ transient alternans through Ca2+\u2192AP coupling and AP\u2192Ca2+ coupling, respectively. Simulation of a 1D tissue model showed that the combined action of HF-induced ion channel remodelling and a decrease in cell-to-cell coupling due to fibrosis increased the heart tissue's susceptibility to the formation of spatially discordant alternans, resulting in an increased functional AP propagation dispersion, which is pro-arrhythmic. These findings provide insights into how HF promotes atrial arrhythmia in association with atrial alternans.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2020-07-14", "authors": ["NaZhao", "QinceLi", "KevinZhang", "KuanquanWang", "RunnanHe", "YongfengYuan", "HengguiZhang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008048\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.026054\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018614\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.191\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.08.048\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.10.019\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01380\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv513\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000509\n10.1093/cvr/cvp216\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.11.017\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.12.028\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.019893\n10.1038/nrd3682\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.02.555\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.37\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01383\n10.1161/CIRCEP.107.754788\n10.1161/01.cir.101.22.2631\n10.1161/01.cir.90.5.2213\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.04.016\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000090688.49283.67\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.02.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.977827\n10.1253/circj.69.1368\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.07.039\n10.1093/cvr/cvt087\n10.1093/cvr/cvv045\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.11.020\n10.1161/01.cir.102.14.1664\n10.1161/01.RES.0000156891.66893.83\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.502831\n10.1161/01.RES.0000224540.97431.f0\n10.1161/01.RES.0000119923.64774.72\n10.1152/ajpheart.00302.2012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.213975\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.852228\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.007\n10.1016/j.medici.2017.04.004\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000142052.03565.87\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.4.H1767\n10.1085/jgp.117.2.119\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.006641\n10.1016/j.bpj.2008.10.056\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.07.016\n10.1152/ajpheart.00185.2017\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008\n10.1161/01.res.0000019783.88094.ba\n10.1063/1.1497505\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.01.032\n10.1093/europace/euu255\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.026\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006594\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.275.5.H1635\n10.23919/CinC49843.2019.9005821\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307836\n10.1161/01.res.53.6.815\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2001.00196.x\n10.1161/hh1901.096702\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn140\n10.1097/00005344-199502000-00014\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000109501.47603.0C\n10.1093/cvr/cvx167\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.113\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.11.008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00609.2007\n10.1529/biophysj.105.071340\n10.1152/ajpheart.00079.2012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.656504\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.07.023"}
{"title": "Targeting muscle-enriched long non-coding RNA H19 reverses pathological cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Pathological cardiac remodelling and subsequent heart failure represents an unmet clinical need. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as crucial molecular orchestrators of disease processes, including that of heart diseases. Here, we report on the powerful therapeutic potential of the conserved lncRNA H19 in the treatment of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.\nPressure overload-induced left ventricular cardiac remodelling revealed an up-regulation of H19 in the early phase but strong sustained repression upon reaching the decompensated phase of heart failure. The translational potential of H19 is highlighted by its repression in a large animal (pig) model of left ventricular hypertrophy, in diseased human heart samples, in human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and in human engineered heart tissue in response to afterload enhancement. Pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in H19 knock-out mice was aggravated compared to wild-type mice. In contrast, vector-based, cardiomyocyte-directed gene therapy using murine and human H19 strongly attenuated heart failure even when cardiac hypertrophy was already established. Mechanistically, using microarray, gene set enrichment analyses and Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation DNA-Sequencing, we identified a link between H19 and pro-hypertrophic nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signalling. H19 physically interacts with the polycomb repressive complex 2 to suppress H3K27 tri-methylation of the anti-hypertrophic Tescalcin locus which in turn leads to reduced NFAT expression and activity.\nH19 is highly conserved and down-regulated in failing hearts from mice, pigs and humans. H19 gene therapy prevents and reverses experimental pressure-overload-induced heart failure.

It prompts inflammation, immune activation, and oxidative stress in the bloodstream and organs of rats. Thus, we theorized that the metabolism of purines, an immunomodulatory mechanism, is altered in cells involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases.\nTherefore, we induced acute hyperlipidemia in Wistar rats with Poloxamer-407 and euthanized the animals 36\u00a0h later. The leucocyte differential, the rate of purine metabolism on the surface of platelets and heart cells, and markers of oxidative stress in the heart tissue were evaluated. These parameters were also assessed in animals pretreated for 30\u00a0days with curcumin and/or rutin.\nHyperlipidemia increased the hydrolyses of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in platelets. In heart cells, the metabolism of ATP and adenosine (ADO) were increased, while ADP hydrolysis was reduced. Additionally, lipid damage and antioxidant defenses were increased in heart homogenates. Hyperlipidemic rats also\u00a0exhibited a reduced percentage of eosinophils and lymphocytes.\nTogether, these findings are indicative of an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in hyperlipidemic rats. The pretreatments with antioxidants reverted some of the changes prompted by hyperlipidemia preventing detrimental changes in the cells and tissues.

The role of glycolysis and the glycolysis-related lncRNAs in CF activation are unknown. Thus, we aimed to investigate the role of glycolysis in CF activation and to identify the glycolysis-related lncRNAs involved.\nGlycolysis-related lncRNAs were searched and their expression profiles were validated in activated human CF (HCF) and human failing heart tissues. Expression of the target lncRNA was manipulated to determine its effects on HCF activation and glycolysis. The underlying mechanisms of lncRNA-dependent glycolysis regulation were also addressed.\nHCF activation induced by transforming growth factor-\u03b21 was accompanied by an enhanced glycolysis, and 2-Deoxy-d-glucose, a specific glycolysis inhibitor, dramatically attenuated HCF activation. Twenty-eight glycolysis-related lncRNAs were identified and Linc00092 expression was changed mostly upon HCF activation. In human heart tissue, Linc00092 is primarily expressed in cardiac fibroblasts. Linc00092 knockdown activated HCFs with enhanced glycolysis, while its overexpression rescued the activated phenotype of HCFs and down-regulated glycolysis. Restoration of glycolysis abolished the anti-fibrotic effects conferred by Linc00092. Linc00092 inhibited ERK activation in activated HCFs, and ERK inhibition counteracted the fibrotic phenotype in Linc00092 knockdown HCFs.\nThese results revealed that Linc00092 could attenuate HCF activation by suppressing glycolysis. The inhibition of ERK by Linc00092 may play an important role in this process. Together, this provides a better understanding of the mechanism of CF activation and may serve as a novel target for cardiac fibrosis treatment.", "journal": "Cellular signalling", "date": "2020-07-13", "authors": ["Zhi-TengChen", "Hai-FengZhang", "MengWang", "Shao-HuaWang", "Zhu-ZhiWen", "Qing-YuanGao", "Mao-XiongWu", "Wen-HaoLiu", "YongXie", "Jing-TingMai", "YingYang", "Jing-FengWang", "Yang-XinChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109708"}

However, the beneficial effect of the agents has been claimed to be independent of cholesterol reduction as there is no significant change in the plasma cholesterol level in myocarditis. In the present study, using experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) rats as an animal model, we demonstrated that EAM induced elevation of cholesterol level and impaired cholesterol efflux capacity in the cardiac tissue. Moreover, serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) content was reduced and HDL function associated protein Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity was decreased. Besides, the major structural protein within HDL, Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) expression in the cardiac tissues was significantly reduced while the level of serum ApoA1 was not significantly altered. Importantly, cholesterol depleting agent methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) alleviated the development of EAM, as monitored by decreased ratio of heart weight to body weight (HW/BW), decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition, improved cardiac function, reduced expression of apoptosis-related protein Bax, Fas, FasL and caspase-3 and increased level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.

Novel therapeutic entry points to counteract maladaptive signalling include the modulation of non-coding RNA molecules such as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). We here questioned if the lncRNA candidate H19 exhibits regulatory potential in the setting of myocardial infarction. Initial profiling of H19 expression revealed a dynamic expression profile of H19 with upregulation in the acute phase after murine cardiac ischemia. In vitro, we found that oxygen deficiency leads to H19 upregulation in several cardiac cell types. Repression of endogenous H19 caused multiple phenotypes in cultivated murine cardiomyocytes including enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, at least partly through attenuated vitamin D signalling. Unbiased proteome analysis revealed further involvement of H19 in mRNA splicing and translation as well as inflammatory signalling pathways. To study H19 function more precisely, we investigated the phenotype of systemic H19 loss in a genetic mouse model of H19 deletion (H19 KO). Infarcted heart tissue of H19 KO mice showed a massive increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines after ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) without significant effects on scar formation or cardiac function but exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy indicating pathological cardiac remodeling. H19-dependent changes in cardiomyocyte-derived extracellular vesicle release and alterations in NF-\u03baB signalling were evident. Cardiac cell fractionation experiments revealed that enhanced H19 expression in the proliferative phase after MI derived mainly from cardiac fibroblasts. Here further research is needed to elucidate its role in fibroblast activation and function. In conclusion, the lncRNA H19 is dynamically regulated after MI and involved in multiple pathways of different cardiac cell types including cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac inflammation.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2020-07-11", "authors": ["LisaHobu\u00df", "ArianaFoinquinos", "MiraJung", "FranziskaKenneweg", "KeXiao", "YongWang", "KarinaZimmer", "JanetRemke", "AnnetteJust", "JulietteNowak", "ArneSchmidt", "AndreasPich", "StephaneMazlan", "Stella MReamon-Buettner", "Gustavo CamposRamos", "StefanFrantz", "JanikaViereck", "XavierLoyer", "ChantalBoulanger", "Kai CWollert", "JanFiedler", "ThomasThum"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.07.001"}
{"title": "The quest for diagnostic approaches of cardiac involvement in polymyositis and dermatomyositis.", "abstract": "Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation of skeletal muscle, primarily manifesting as chronic muscle weakness. Extramuscular organs can also be affected. Cardiac involvement is one of the visceral organ damages whose prevalence is underestimated and is a marker of poor prognosis leading to irreversible dysfunction or even death. Although early and accurate recognition of cardiac involvement remains a key barrier to improving survival in PM/ DM patients, considerable progress has been made, and an overview will be provided in this review. The new concept of multimodality imaging, which involves an integrated approach of echocardiography (Echo), cardiac magnetic resonance and sometimes positron emission tomography (PET), can facilitate diagnosis. The development of ultrasound technology, including strain analysis, stress Echo and contrast-enhanced Echo, helps disclose early cardiac dysfunction more sensitively than conventional Echo. Cardiac magnetic resonance unveils silent, acute or chronic myocarditis in PM/DM and is used to monitor treatment efficacy due to its excellent tissue characterization. PET can be useful thanks to the appearance of new tracers that can eliminate the effects of glucose uptake by normal cardiomyocytes. The sensitivity of endomyocardial biopsy may be increased by targeted sampling with the guidance of cardiac imaging.

In this study, 56 Wistar albino male rats (estimated body weights 250-400\u00a0g) were divided into eight groups (n\u00a0=\u00a07). Group 1 (Control) received no drug. Group 2 (ISO) was given 180\u00a0mg/kg of isoproterenol subcutaneously (s.c.); two doses were administered at 24-h intervals on days 29 and 30 of the experiment. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were given valsartan (30\u00a0mg/kg orally), C21 (0.03\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneally), and a combination of Valsartan\u00a0+\u00a0C21, respectively, for 30\u00a0days.

Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the rats at the beginning and end of the experiment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG alterations were monitored via a carotid artery cannula at the end of the experiment.

Also, the protective effect of C21 on myocardial injury was superior to that of valsartan. According to the results of echocardiographic and biochemical evaluations, C21, and Valsartan showed protective effects against heart failure.

In this work, we describe a method to simulate realistic MAP and intermediate forms, which are multiphasic electrograms different from an ideal MAP. The key ideas of our method are the formation of compressed zones and junctional spaces-regions of the extracellular and bath or blood pool directly in contact with electrodes that exhibit a pressure-induced reduction in electrical conductivity-and the presence of a complex network of passive components that acts as a high-pass filter to distort and attenuate the signal that reaches the recording amplifier. The network is formed by the interaction between the passive tissue properties and the double-layer capacitance of electrodes. The MAP and intermediate forms reside on a continuum of signals, which can be generated by the change of the model parameters.

The metabolites of fats known as fatty acids provide most of the energy for cardiac tissue, serve as building blocks for membranes and regulate important signaling cascades. Despite their importance, excess fat intake can cause cardiac dysfunction. The detrimental effects of high-fat diet (HFD) on cardiac health are widely investigated in long-term studies but the short-term effects of fats have not been thoroughly studied. To elucidate the near-term effects of a HFD on the growth and maturation of late adolescent heart we subjected 11-week-old mice to an 8-week long HFD (42% of calories from fat, 42% from carbohydrate, n\u00a0=\u00a08) or chow diet (12% of calories from fat, 66% from carbohydrate, n\u00a0=\u00a07) and assessed their effects on the heart in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that excessive fat feeding interferes with normal maturation of the heart indicated by the lack of increase in dimensions, volume, and stroke volume of the left ventricles of mice on high fat diet that were evident in mice on chow diet. In addition, differences in regional strain during the contraction cycle between mice on HFD and chow diet were seen. These changes were associated with reduced activity of the growth promoting PI3K-Akt1 signaling cascade and moderate changes in glucose metabolism without changes in calcium signaling.

To date, no study is available for biochemical analysis of diazepam in cardiac dysfunction. This study aimed to determine the effect of diazepam in stress-induced cardiac dysfunctions in rats. Male Wistar Albino rats were divided into four groups with six animals in each group for 90 days of the experimental protocol. Group1 served as a Normal Control (NC), Groups 2, as a Disease Control (DC), Group 3 as a Diazepam Control (DIC), and Group 4 as a Disease\u2009+\u2009Diazepam Treatment (DDT). Disease Control and Disease\u2009+\u2009Diazepam Treatment animals exposed to regular stress by forced swimming exercise method for 3 months. Diazepam Control and Disease\u2009+\u2009Diazepam Treatment received 5\u2009mg/kg/p.o the daily dose of diazepam. At the end of the protocol, animals were sacrificed, heart preserved, blood collected, and utilized for biochemical estimations. Heart weight was increased in DC as compared to NC. Serum levels of cardiac biomarkers, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatine kinase-MB (CPK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and troponin I (TnI) were significantly increased in DC as compared to NC. Heart tissue examined for histological changes. The altered serum levels of CPK, CPK-MB, LDH, hs-CRP, and TnI were significantly restored by the treatment of diazepam. Serum levels of Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, and Magnesium was increased in DC animals as compared to NC. The altered ionic level was also restored by the treatment of diazepam. Level of various cardiac markers and ions in the plasma were also slightly elevated in DIC. Histopathological studies are also in agreement with serological examinations and bonafide cardioprotective influences of diazepam in cardiac dysfunction.

These observations have now translated to the pediatric arena. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess safety and efficacy of cell-based therapies in animal and human studies of pediatric heart disease.\nA literature search was conducted to examine the effects of cell-based therapies on: (i) safety and (ii) cardiac function. In total, 18 pre-clinical and 13 human studies were included. Pre-clinical: right ventricular dysfunction was the most common animal model (80%). Cardiac-derived (28%) and umbilical cord blood (24%) cells were delivered intravenously (36%) or intramyocardially (35%). Mortality was similar between cell-based and control groups (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.05, 17.41).

{"title": "Single-cell analysis of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and spike protein priming expression of proteases in the human heart.", "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly binds to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) to facilitate cellular entry. Compared with the lung or respiratory tract, the human heart exhibits greater ACE2 expression. However, little substantial damage was found in the heart tissue, and no viral particles were observed in the cardiac myocytes. This study aims to analyse ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein proteases at the single-cell level, to explore the cardiac involvement in COVID-19 and improve our understanding of the potential cardiovascular implications of COVID-19.\nWith meta-analysis, the prevalence of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients varies from 2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0-5%, I2 = 0%] in non-ICU patients to 59% (95% CI 48-71%, I2 = 85%) in non-survivors. With public single-cell sequence data analysis, ACE2 expression in the adult human heart is higher than that in the lung (adjusted P < 0.0001). Inversely, the most important S protein cleavage protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine protease-2) in the heart exhibits an extremely lower expression than that in the lung (adjusted P < 0.0001), which may restrict entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiac cells. Furthermore, we discovered that other S protein proteases, CTSL (cathepsin L) and FURIN (furin, paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme), were expressed in the adult heart at a similar level to that in the lung, which may compensate for TMPRSS2, mediating cardiac involvement in COVID-19.\nCompared with the lung, ACE2 is relatively more highly expressed in the human heart, while the key S protein priming protease, TMPRSS2, is rarely expressed. The low percentage of ACE2+/TMPRSS2+ cells reduced heart vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 to some degree.

ADSCs constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein were established from F344 rats and transplanted as a cell sheet over the left ventricle 3\u00a0days after left anterior descending artery ligation with or without an overlying cardiac patch.

{"title": "Effects of Lipids and Lipoproteins on Mesenchymal Stem Cells Used in Cardiac Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have two characteristics of interest for this paper: the ability to self-renew, and the potential for multiple-lineage differentiation into various cells. MSCs have been used in cardiac tissue regeneration for over a decade. Adult cardiac tissue regeneration ability is quite low; it cannot repair itself after injury, as the heart cells are replaced by fibroblasts and lose function. It is therefore important to search for a feasible way to repair and restore heart function through stem cell therapy. Stem cells can differentiate and provide a source of progenitor cells for cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and supporting cells. Studies have shown that the concentrations of blood lipids and lipoproteins affect cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and obesity. Furthermore, the MSC lipid profiles, such as the triglyceride and cholesterol content, have been revealed by lipidomics, as well as their correlation with MSC differentiation. Abnormal blood lipids can cause serious damage to internal organs, especially heart tissue. In the past decade, the accumulated literature has indicated that lipids/lipoproteins affect stem cell behavior and biological functions, including their multiple lineage capability, and in turn affect the outcome of regenerative medicine.

We hypothesize that existing signs of immaturity of the cell models result from an improper mechanical environment. With the presented study, we aimed at validating the newly developed FLEXcyte96 technology with respect to physiological responses of hiPSC-CMs to pharmacological compounds with known inotropic and/or cardiotoxic effects.\nhiPSC-CMs were cultured in a 96-well format on hyperelastic silicone membranes imitating their native mechanical environment. Cardiomyocyte contractility was measured contact-free by application of capacitive displacement sensing of the cell-membrane biohybrids. Acute effects of positive inotropic compounds with distinct mechanisms of action were examined. Additionally, cardiotoxic effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anthracyclines were repetitively examined during repeated exposure to drug concentrations for up to 5\u00a0days.\nhiPSC-CMs grown on biomimetic membranes displayed increased contractility responses to isoproterenol, S-Bay K8644 and omecamtiv mecarbil without the need for additional stimulation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib, vandetanib, nilotinib, gefitinib, A-674563 as well as anthracycline idarubicin showed the expected cardiotoxic effects, including negative inotropy and induction of proarrhythmic events.\nWe conclude that the FLEXcyte 96 system is a reliable high throughput tool for invitro cardiac contractility research, providing the user with data obtained under physiological conditions which resemble the native environment of human heart tissue.

{"title": "4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal attenuates 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 activity.", "abstract": "Elevated cellular oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage are key contributors to impaired cardiac function in diabetes. During chronic inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipid peroxidation results in the formation of reactive aldehydes, foremost of which is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE). 4HNE forms covalent adducts with proteins, negatively impacting cellular protein function. During conditions of elevated oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage such as modification by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG) is repaired by 8-oxoguanine glycosylase-1 (OGG-1). Based on these facts, we hypothesized that 4HNE forms adducts with OGG-1 inhibiting its activity, and thus, increases the levels of 8OHG in diabetic heart tissues. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated OGG-1 activity, 8OHG and 4HNE in the hearts of leptin receptor deficient db/db mice, a type-2 diabetic model. We also treated the recombinant OGG-1 with 4HNE to measure direct adduction. We found decreased OGG-1 activity (P\u2009>\u2009.05), increased 8OHG (P\u2009>\u2009.05) and increased 4HNE adducts (P\u2009>\u2009.05) along with low aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 activity (P\u2009>\u2009.05). The increased colocalization of OGG-1 and 4HNE in cardiomyocytes suggest 4HNE adduction on OGG-1. Furthermore, colocalization of 8OHG and OGG-1 with mitochondrial markers TOM 20 and aconitase, respectively, indicated significant levels of oxidatively-induced mtDNA damage and implicated a role for mitochondrial OGG-1 function. In vitro exposure of recombinant OGG-1 (rOGG-1) with increasing concentrations of 4HNE resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in OGG-1 activity. Mass spectral analysis of trypsin digests of 4HNE-treated rOGG-1 identified 4HNE adducts on C28, C75, C163, H179, H237, C241, K249, H270, and H282. In silico molecular modeling of 4HNE-K249 OGG-1 and 4HNE-H270 OGG-1 mechanistically supported 4HNE-mediated enzymatic inhibition of OGG-1. In conclusion, these data support the hypothesis that inhibition of OGG-1 by direct modification by 4HNE contributes to decreased OGG-1 activity and increased 8OHG-modified DNA that are present in the diabetic heart.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2020-07-07", "authors": ["GuodongPan", "MandarDeshpande", "HaiyanPang", "Paul MStemmer", "Nicholas JCarruthers", "Colin TShearn", "Donald SBackos", "Suresh SPalaniyandi"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.29814\n10.1111/j.0305-1870.2005.04247.x\n10.1128/MCB.00624-06\n10.1002/em.22087\n10.1074/jbc.M116.754481\n10.1074/jbc.M111.316497\n10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.39.1.67\n10.1042/BJ20151227\n10.3109/10715762.2011.653968\n10.1021/acschembio.5b00452\n10.1152/physrev.00018.2001\n10.1002/jcc.10378\n10.1038/srep22086\n10.1177/1535370213520109\n10.1371/journal.pone.0163158\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.68.1.255\n10.1016/s0891-5849(02)00807-9\n10.1021/tx0600043\n10.1155/2016/1390861\n10.1074/jbc.M608989200\n10.1016/j.dnarep.2019.102667\n10.1371/journal.pone.0051697\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.011\n10.2337/db07-1579\n10.1159/000291964\n10.1080/10590500902885684\n10.1093/nar/gkh224\n10.1016/j.dnarep.2014.03.030\n10.1152/ajpheart.00157.2011"}

Numerous animal and cell models have been used to examine the effects of drugs, yet these responses often differ in humans. Human cardiac slices offer an advantage for drug testing in that they are directly derived from viable human hearts. In addition to having preserved multicellular structures, cell-cell coupling, and extracellular matrix environments, human cardiac tissue slices can be used to directly test the effect of innumerable drugs on adult human cardiac physiology. What distinguishes this model from other heart preparations, such as whole hearts or wedges, is that slices can be subjected to longer-term culture. As such, cardiac slices allow for studying the acute as well as chronic effects of drugs. Furthermore, the ability to collect several hundred to a thousand slices from a single heart makes this a high-throughput model to test several drugs at varying concentrations and combinations with other drugs at the same time. Slices can be prepared from any given region of the heart. In this protocol, we describe the preparation of left ventricular slices by isolating tissue cubes from the left ventricular free wall and sectioning them into slices using a high precision vibrating microtome. These slices can then either be subjected to acute experiments to measure baseline cardiac electrophysiological function or cultured for chronic drug studies.

Furthermore, DOX-induced rats showed augmented inflammatory mediators (nuclear factor-\u03baB [NF-kB], tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], and interleukin-1\u03b2 [IL-1\u03b2]) and increased PI3K/Akt signaling proteins (PI3K, p-Bad/Bad, caspase-3, and p-Akt), whereas decreased oxidative markers (HO-1 and NQO-1) and p-PTEN were observed. Nimbolide-supplemented rats showed reduced activity/levels of cardiac markers and TBARS levels in serum and heart tissue. Levels of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants were augmented in the heart tissue of nimbolide-supplemented rats.

{"title": "Engineering anisotropic human stem cell-derived three-dimensional cardiac tissue on-a-chip.", "abstract": "Despite significant efforts in the study of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), they persist as the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Considerable research into human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) has highlighted their immense potential in the development of in vitro human cardiac tissues for broad mechanistic, therapeutic, and patient-specific disease modeling studies in the pursuit of CVD research. However, the relatively immature state of hPSC-CMs remains an obstacle in enhancing clinical relevance ofengineered cardiac tissue models. In this study, we describe development of a microfluidic platform for 3D modeling of cardiac tissues, derived from both rat cells and hPSC-CMs, to better recapitulate the native myocardium through co-culture with interstitial cells (specifically cardiac fibroblasts), biomimetic collagen hydrogel encapsulation, and induction of highly anisotropic tissue architecture. The presented platform is precisely engineered through incorporation of surface topography in the form of staggered microposts to enable long-term culture and maturation of cardiac cells, resulting in formation of physiologically relevant cardiac tissues with anisotropy that mimics native myocardium. After two weeks of culture, hPSC-derived cardiac tissues exhibited well-defined sarcomeric striations, highly synchronous contractions, and upregulation of several maturation genes, including HCN1, KCNQ1, CAV1.2, CAV3.1, PLN, and RYR2. These findings demonstrate the ability of the proposed engineered platform to mature animal- as well as human stem cell-derived cardiac tissues over an extended period of culture, providing a novel microfluidic chip with the capability for cardiac disease modeling and therapeutic testing.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2020-07-06", "authors": ["JaimesonVeldhuizen", "JoshuaCutts", "David ABrafman", "Raymond QMigrino", "MehdiNikkhah"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120195"}

Nanomaterials have been used in the regeneration of tissues such as bone, dental and neural tissue in the body and have increased hope for revitalizing of damaged tissues. Conductive carbon base nanomaterials with its superior physicochemical properties have emerged as promising materials for cardiovascular application. In this study, we applied a biosynthetic collagen scaffold containing carbon nanofiber for regenerating of damaged heart tissue. The collagen-carbon nanofiber scaffold was fabricated and fully characterised. The scaffold was grafted on the affected area of myocardial ischemia, immediately after ligation of the left anterior descending artery in the wistar rat's model. After 4\u00a0weeks, histological analyses were performed for investigation of formation of immature cardio-myocytes, epicardial cells, and angiogenesis. Compared to untreated hearts, this scaffold significantly protects heart tissue against injury. This improvement is accompanied by a reduction in fibrosis and the increased formation of a blood vessel network and immature cardio-myocytes in the infarction heart.

Serological analysis indicated that all the aborted ewes were confirmed positive for agglutination to Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii)antibody. The investigation of the aborted fetuses showed the blood-stained fluid in the thoracic and abdominal cavity. Most of the aborted fetuses had also enlarged, congested, and friable livers and lungs. The placenta was swollen, reddish, and friable, and its cotyledons also spotted with whitish foci. T. gondii tachyzoites were also demonstrated in the placental sections of some aborted ewes. Severe congestion, necrosis, and infiltration of multinucleated cells were the most predominant histopathological changes of the aborted fetuses, as well as presented tissue cysts, tachyzoites, and bradyzoites in the liver, brain, heart, and lung. There were also several clusters of dark purple banana-shaped T. gondii tachyzoites within the brain and heart tissues in most of the examined aborted fetuses in different flocks. T. gondii tachyzoites were also detected from the peritoneal ascites of mice inoculated experimentally 12 days following the infection. Moreover, T. gondii tissue cysts were detected from the impression smears of the mice brains 32 days after the infection.

This study aims to evaluate the contribution of ferroptosis to ischemia or reperfusion injury, and lay a basis for precise therapy of myocardial infarction. The Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat hearts were subjected to ischemia for different duration or the hearts were treated with 1\u00a0h-ischemia plus different duration of reperfusion. The myocardial injury was assessed by biochemical assays and hematoxylin & eosin (HE) staining. The ferroptosis was evaluated with the levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), iron, and malondialdehyde. Iron chelator (deferoxamine) was applied to verify the contribution of ferroptosis to ischemia and reperfusion injury. The results showed that ischemic injury (infarction and CK release) was getting worse with the extension of ischemia, but no significant changes in ferroptosis indexes (ACSL4, GPX4, iron, and malondialdehyde) in cardiac tissues were observed. Differently, the levels of ACSL4, iron, and malondialdehyde were gradually elevated with the extension of reperfusion concomitant with a decrease of GPX4 level. In the ischemia-treated rat hearts, no significant changes in myocardial injury were observed in the presence of deferoxamine, while in the ischemia/reperfusion-treated rat hearts, myocardial injury was markedly attenuated in the presence of deferoxamine concomitant with a reduction of ferroptosis. Based on these observations, we conclude that ferroptosis occurs mainly in the phase of myocardial reperfusion but not ischemia.

We show that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition suppresses CM maturation, while contact removal prevents CMs from cell cycle exit. Remarkably, contact removal enabled 10 to 25 times greater expansion beyond GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition alone. Mechanistically, persistent CM proliferation required both LEF/TCF activity and AKT phosphorylation but was independent from yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling.

To overcome this problem, cardiac tissue engineering is considered a promising approach by using implantable artificial blood vessels, injectable gels, and cardiac patches (to name a few) made from biodegradable polymers. Biodegradable polymers are classified into two main categories: natural and synthetic polymers. Natural biodegradable polymers have some distinct advantages such as biodegradability, abundant availability, and renewability but have some significant drawbacks such as rapid degradation, insufficient electrical conductivity, immunological reaction, and poor mechanical properties for cardiac tissue engineering. Synthetic biodegradable polymers have some advantages such as strong mechanical properties, controlled structure, great processing flexibility, and usually no immunological concerns; however, they have some drawbacks such as a lack of cell attachment and possible low biocompatibility. Some applications have combined the best of both and exciting new natural/synthetic composites have been utilized. Recently, the use of nanostructured polymers and polymer nanocomposites has revolutionized the field of cardiac tissue engineering due to their enhanced mechanical, electrical, and surface properties promoting tissue growth.

{"title": "Targeting Cardiac Stem Cell Senescence to Treat Cardiac Aging and Disease.", "abstract": "Adult stem/progenitor are a small population of cells that reside in tissue-specific niches and possess the potential to differentiate in all cell types of the organ in which they operate. Adult stem cells are implicated with the homeostasis, regeneration, and aging of all tissues. Tissue-specific adult stem cell senescence has emerged as an attractive theory for the decline in mammalian tissue and organ function during aging. Cardiac aging, in particular, manifests as functional tissue degeneration that leads to heart failure. Adult cardiac stem/progenitor cell (CSC) senescence has been accordingly associated with physiological and pathological processes encompassing both non-age and age-related decline in cardiac tissue repair and organ dysfunction and disease. Senescence is a highly active and dynamic cell process with a first classical hallmark represented by its replicative limit, which is the establishment of a stable growth arrest over time that is mainly secondary to DNA damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation elicited by different intrinsic stimuli (like metabolism), as well as external stimuli and age. Replicative senescence is mainly executed by telomere shortening, the activation of the p53/p16", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2020-07-02", "authors": ["EleonoraCianflone", "MicheleTorella",

{"title": "An Uncertainty Modeling Framework for Intracardiac Electrogram Analysis.", "abstract": "Intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) are electrical signals measured within the chambers of the heart, which can be used to locate abnormal cardiac tissue and guide catheter ablations to treat cardiac arrhythmias. EGMs may contain large amounts of uncertainty and irregular variations, which pose significant challenges in data analysis. This study aims to introduce a statistical approach to account for the data uncertainty while analyzing EGMs for abnormal electrical impulse identification. The activation order of catheter sensors was modeled with a multinomial distribution, and maximum likelihood estimations were done to track the electrical wave conduction path in the presence of uncertainty. Robust optimization was performed to locate the electrical impulses based on the local conduction velocity and the geodesic distances between catheter sensors. The proposed algorithm can identify the focal sources when the electrical conduction is initiated by irregular electrical impulses and involves wave collisions, breakups, and spiral waves. The statistical modeling framework can efficiently deal with data uncertainties and provide a reliable estimation of the focal source locations. This shows the great potential of a statistical approach for the quantitative analysis of the stochastic activity of electrical waves in cardiac disorders and suggests future investigations integrating statistical methods with a deterministic geometry-based method to achieve advanced diagnostic performance.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-07-02", "authors": ["AmirhosseinKoneshloo", "DongpingDu", "YunchengDu"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering7020062\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1038/415219a\n10.1001/archinte.168.6.581\n10.1161/CIRCEP.108.824789\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2187054\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.04.027\n10.1161/CIRCEP.108.843284\n10.1111/jce.12331\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.01.011\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00589\n10.1111/jce.13882\n10.1111/jce.14456\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.08.002\n10.3390/e20010057\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.08.027\n10.1063/1.5024248\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.03.001\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.10.019\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2055056\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.11.017\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2019.12.010\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.04.031\n10.1111/jce.13177\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.275.1.H301\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2562918\n10.1111/jce.14201"}
{"title": "Protective effect of alpha-pinene against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction through NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Monoterpenes present in the essential oils exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the preventive effect of alpha-pinene (AP), a monoterpene, against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction and inflammation in Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with AP (50 mg/kg body weight (bw)) administration for 21 days and ISO (85 mg/kg bw) was administered subcutaneously for last two consecutive days (20th day and 21st day). We noticed that there was an increased activity of cardiac marker enzymes in ISO-treated rats. We also observed that elevated levels of lipid peroxidative indices decreased activities of antioxidant status in plasma, erythrocyte, and heart tissue in ISO-induced rats. Furthermore, ISO-treated rats showed an increase in the levels of inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum. Besides, we confirmed the upregulated expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells in ISO-induced rat heart tissue. Conversely, we found that AP pretreatment significantly decreased levels of cardiac markers like serum cardiac troponin T and cardiac troponin I, lipid peroxidative markers, and restored antioxidants status in ISO-treated rats. Besides, AP administration attenuated ISO-induced inflammatory marker expression. The present findings demonstrated that AP significantly protects the myocardium and exerts cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in experimental rats.", "journal": "Human & experimental toxicology", "date": "2020-07-01", "authors": ["BZhang", "HWang", "ZYang", "MCao", "KWang", "GWang", "YZhao"], "doi": "10.1177/0960327120934537"}
{"title": "An essential role for cardiolipin in the stability and function of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.", "abstract": "Calcium uptake by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter coordinates cytosolic signaling events with mitochondrial bioenergetics. During the past decade all protein components of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter have been identified, including MCU, the pore-forming subunit. However, the specific lipid requirements, if any, for the function and formation of this channel complex are currently not known. Here we utilize yeast, which lacks the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, as a model system to address this problem. We use heterologous expression to functionally reconstitute human uniporter machinery both in wild-type yeast as well as in mutants defective in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, or cardiolipin (CL). We uncover a specific requirement of CL for in vivo reconstituted MCU stability and activity. The CL requirement of MCU is evolutionarily conserved with loss of CL triggering rapid turnover of MCU homologs and impaired calcium transport. Furthermore, we observe reduced abundance and activity of endogenous MCU in mammalian cellular models of Barth syndrome, which is characterized by a partial loss of CL. MCU abundance is also decreased in the cardiac tissue of Barth syndrome patients. Our work raises the hypothesis that impaired mitochondrial calcium transport contributes to the pathogenesis of Barth syndrome, and more generally, showcases the utility of yeast phospholipid mutants in dissecting the phospholipid requirements of ion channel complexes.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2020-07-01", "authors": ["SagnikaGhosh", "WritobanBasu Ball", "Travis RMadaris", "SubramanyaSrikantan", "MuniswamyMadesh", "Vamsi KMootha", "Vishal MGohil"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2000640117"}
{"title": "Cardiac-specific methylation patterns of circulating DNA for identification of cardiomyocyte death.", "abstract": "Correct detection of human cardiomyocyte death is essential for definitive diagnosis and appropriate management of cardiovascular diseases. Although current strategies have proven utility in clinical cardiology, they have some limitations. Our aim was to develop a new approach to monitor myocardial death using methylation patterns of circulating cell-free DNA (cf-DNA).\nWe first examined the methylation status of FAM101A in heart tissue and blood of individual donors using quantitative methylation-sensitive PCR (qMS-PCR). The concentrations and kinetics of cardiac cf-DNA in plasma from five congenital heart disease (CHD) children before and after they underwent cardiac surgery at serial time points were then investigated.\nWe identified demethylated FAM101A specifically present in heart tissue. Importantly, our time course experiments demonstrated that the plasma cardiac cf-DNA level increased quickly during the early post-cardiac surgery phase, peaking at 4-6\u2009h, decreased progressively (24\u2009h) and returned to baseline (72\u2009h). Moreover, cardiac cf-DNA concentrations pre- and post-operation were closely correlated with plasma troponin levels.\nWe proposed a novel strategy for the correct detection of cardiomyocyte death, based on analysis of plasma cf-DNA carrying the cardiac-specific methylation signature. Our pilot study may lead to new tests for human cardiac pathologies.", "journal": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "date": "2020-07-01", "authors": ["QinLiu", "JianMa", "HuaDeng", "Shu-JunHuang", "JiaoRao", "Wei-BinXu", "Jing-SiHuang", "Shan-QuanSun", "LiangZhang"], "doi": "10.1186/s12872-020-01587-x"}

All tissues were examined under light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Expressions of caveolin (Cav)-1 in the lung and Cav-1 and Cav-3 in the heart were examined immunohistochemically.\nThe MIL\u00a0+\u00a0IR group had significantly a lower magnitude of oxidative stress than the IR group both in the lung and heart (lung: P\u00a0=\u00a00.03 for MDA and 0.001 for GSH and heart: P\u00a0=\u00a00.002 for MDA and 0.000 for GSH). In light microscopy, the MIL\u00a0+\u00a0IR group had statistically a lower total injury score than the IR group for both the lung and heart tissue (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.04, respectively). In TEM, regression of mitochondrial degeneration and lamellar bodies in type II pneumocytes in the lungs and obvious improvements in disruption at the intercalated discs and mitochondrial degeneration in the hearts in the MIL\u00a0+\u00a0IR group were detected compared with the IR group. The expression of both Cav-1 and Cav-3 in the MIL\u00a0+\u00a0IR group was improved compared with the IR group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03 for both).\nMIL attenuates remote injury of heart and lung in lower body IR by inhibiting oxidative stress. Moreover, Cav-1 and Cav-3 might have a potential role in MIL-induced cardioprotection.", "journal": "Annals of vascular surgery", "date": "2020-07-01", "authors": ["EsinAk", "KorayAk", "Unsal VeliUstandag", "ElifKervancioglu-Demirci", "EbruEmekli-Alturfan", "Sule\u00c7etinel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.avsg.2020.06.050"}

In the past decade, gene therapy has become a promising treatment option for heart disease, owing to its efficiency and exceptional therapeutic effects. In an effort to repair the damaged tissue post-MI, various studies have employed DNA-based or viral gene therapy but have faced considerable hurdles due to the poor and uncontrolled expression of the delivered genes, edema, arrhythmia, and cardiac hypertrophy. Synthetic modified mRNA (modRNA) presents a novel gene therapy approach that offers high, transient, safe, nonimmunogenic, and controlled mRNA delivery to the heart tissue without any risk of genomic integration. Due to these remarkable characteristics combined with its bell-shaped pharmacokinetics in the heart, modRNA has become an attractive approach for the treatment of heart disease. However, to increase its effectiveness in vivo, a consistent and reliable delivery method needs to be followed. Hence, to maximize modRNA delivery efficiency and yield consistency in modRNA use for in vivo applications, an optimized method of preparation and delivery of modRNA intracardiac injection in a mouse MI model is presented.

In particular, the fabrication of 3-D cardiac tissues is greatly anticipated. However, hierarchical organization of 3-D tissues is still unknown. In regenerative medicine and drug discovery, noninvasive evaluation methods of 3-D tissues including inside of it play a key role. In this study, we report on noninvasive methods of analyzing bio-fabricated 3-D cardiac tissues using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and image analysis. Three-dimensional cardiac tissues were fabricated by coating of extracellular matrix nanofilms onto a cell surface using a layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. At first, we investigated the relationship between surface beating and its thickness to assess the value of internal analysis. The results showed that the surface beating was influenced by the thickness. Next, we tried to quantitatively evaluate the internal beating of 3-D cardiac tissues. We also confirmed the methods by changing the beating properties through the administration of isoproterenol. Our results demonstrated that the beating properties of 3-D cardiac tissues differed by depth. The results of this study suggest that information on the internal properties of 3-D cardiac tissue was necessary to understand how it functions. The combination of OCT and image analysis can be used to evaluate the internal beating properties, including changes in beating induced by a drug.

Heart failure - a heterogeneous syndrome - is a major and increasing health care problem worldwide and a leading cause of hospitalization and morbidity in elderly. Adequate heart tissue regeneration in human is lacking. Challenges to engineer heart tissue and employ it in vitro or in regenerative medicine remain to be solved.

{"title": "Microenvironment stiffness requires decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix to promote heart regeneration in the neonatal mouse heart.", "abstract": "The transient period of regeneration potential in the postnatal heart suggests molecular changes with maturation influence the cardiac response to damage. We have previously demonstrated that injury and exercise can stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult heart suggesting a sensitivity to exogenous signals. Here, we consider whether exogenous fetal ECM and mechanically unloading interstitial matrix can drive regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI) surgery in low-regenerative hearts of day5 mice. Compared to controls, exogenous fetal ECM increases cardiac function and lowers fibrosis at 3 weeks post-injury and this effect can be augmented by softening heart tissue. In vitro experiments support a mechano-sensitivity to exogenous ECM signaling. We tested potential mechanisms and observed that fetal ECM increases nuclear YAP localization which could be enhanced by pharmacological stabilization of the cytoskeleton. Blocking YAP expression lowered fetal ECM effects though not completely. Lastly we observed mechanically unloading heart interstitial matrix increased agrin expression, an extracellular node in the YAP signaling pathway. Collectively, these data support a combined effect of exogenous factors and mechanical activity in altering agrin expression, cytoskeletal remodeling, and YAP signaling in driving cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity and regeneration in postnatal non-regenerative mice. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: With the purpose of developing regenerative strategies, we investigate the influence of the local niche on the cardiac injury response. We conclude tissue stiffness, as anticipated in aging or disease, impairs regenerative therapeutics. Most novel, mechanical unloading facilitates enhanced cardiac regeneration only after cells are pushed into a permissive state by fetal biomolecules. Specifically, mechanical unloading appears to increase extracellular agrin expression that amplifies fetal-stimulation of nuclear YAP signaling which correlates with observed increases of cell cycle activity in cardiomyocytes. The results further suggest the cytoskeleton is critical to this interaction between mechanical unloading and independently actived YAP signaling. Using animal models, tissue explants, and cells, this work indicates that local mechanical stimuli can augment proliferating-permissive cardiomyocytes in the natural cardiac niche.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2020-06-27", "authors": ["XinmingWang", "SubhadipSenapati", "AkinolaAkinbote", "BhargaveeGnanasambandam", "Paul S-HPark", "Samuel ESenyo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2020.06.032"}
{"title": "Pressure overload generates a cardiac-specific profile of inflammatory mediators.", "abstract": "Mechanisms that contribute to myocardial fibrosis, particularly in response to left ventricular pressure overload (LVPO), remain poorly defined. To test the hypothesis that a myocardial-specific profile of secreted factors is produced in response to PO, levels of 44 factors implicated in immune cell recruitment and function were assessed in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and compared with levels produced in a model of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Mice subjected to PO were assessed at 1 and 4 wk. Protein from plasma, LV, lungs, and kidneys were analyzed by specific protein array analysis in parallel with protein from mice subjected to silica-instilled PF. Of the 44 factors assessed, 13 proteins were elevated in 1-wk PO myocardium, whereas 18 proteins were found increased in fibrotic lung. Eight of those increased in 1-wk LVPO were not found to be increased in fibrotic lungs (CCL-11, CCL-12, CCL-17, CCL-19, CCL-21, CCL-22, IL-16, and VEGF). Additionally, six factors were increased in plasma of 1-wk LVPO in the absence of increases in myocardial levels. In contrast, in mice with PF, no factors were found increased in plasma that were not elevated in lung tissue. Of those factors increased at 1 wk, only TIMP-1 remained elevated at 4 wk of LVPO.

{"title": "[Study of the influence of etoxidol on expression of follistatin-like protein-1 (FSTL-1) in myocardium after experimental infarction in rats].", "abstract": "In heart attack, FSTL-1 is actively secreted by cardiomyocytes, accelerates growth of heart myofibrils and stimulates of vascular endothelial growth factor expression. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of Etoxidol on synthesis of FSTL-1 in rats after myocardial infarction. The experiments were performed on Wistar rats weighing 250-350 g with simulated myocardial infarction or intact (group 5). Animals of control groups (groups 1, 2) were treated with saline for 7 and 14 days; Ethoxidol (24 mg/kg) was injected to animals of experimental groups (group 3, 4) (the daily dose was 6.36 mg/animal) for 6 or 14 days. The injection volume was 0.2 ml. At the beginning and at the end of the study plasma concentrations of FSTL-1 were determined by the ELISA method. Myocardial FSTL-1 gene expression was determined by real-time PCR. At the end of the experiments, the hearts were also used for histochemical analysis. To determine the size of the scar formed after the modeled heart attack, we used the classic Mallory staining method. The results show that the development of experimental acute myocardial infarction is accompanied by a significant increase in FSTL-1 expression in the heart, which was detected on the 7th day and stored increased by 14 days after a heart attack. After therapy with Ethoxidol, a tendency to a decrease in the expression of FSTL-1 by the 14th day was observed; it coincided with the dynamics of the plasma protein FSTL-1 level. It can be assumed that the downregulation trend in the FSTL-1 expression is associated with a more effective repair process after a heart attack, since FSTL-1 increases precisely in response to myocardial damage and decreases when the incentives for its expression from damaged heart tissue are reduced. Indirectly, this assumption is confirmed by the detected tendency to reduce the size of post-infarction fibrosis in the treatment with Ethoxidol. The results indicate the ability of Ethoxidol to influence FSTL-1 synthesis of in rats after myocardial infarction.\nPri infarkte FSTL-1 aktivno sekretiruetsia kardiomitsitami, uskoriaet rost miofibrill serdtsa i stimuliruet \u00e9kspressiiu faktora rosta \u00e9ndoteliia sosudov.

In the present study, we analyzed by PCR and Sanger sequencing methods the presence of specific parasite DNA within brain and heart tissues of 313 individuals of five synanthropic small mammal species (Apodemus sylvaticus, Mus spretus, M. musculus, Rattus rattus, and Crocidura russula) collected in Barcelona metropolitan area (NE Spain). In addition, PCR-RFLP and microsatellites were also used as tools for genotypic characterization of T. gondii and N. caninum, respectively. Specific DNA of T. gondii, N. caninum, and Sarcocystis spp. was detected in 0.3% (n\u2009=\u20091), 1.3% (n\u2009=\u20094), and 3.8% (n\u2009=\u200912) of the animals, respectively. No mixed infections were observed. Crocidura russula stood out as the main host for Sarcocystis spp. Toxoplasma gondii-specific DNA detected in a house rat was genetically characterized by PCR-RFLP, presenting type II and III alleles (SAG1 [II], SAG3 [II], GRA6 [II], c22-8 [III], Apico [III]). Also, unsuccessful DNA sequencing and microsatellite typing were attempted in N. caninum-positive samples, which suggested a lack of PCR specificity and open avenues to speculate the host competence of rodents for N. caninum. Likewise, Sarcocystis spp. identity was studied by alignment and phylogenetic analyses of cox1 and 28S rRNA sequences from the 14 positive samples. It resulted in at least three unknown organisms closely similar (95.7-100% cox1-sequence homology) to Sarcocystis pantherophisi from the Eastern rat snake (Pantherophis alleghaniensis) (KU891603), suggesting together with 28S rRNA sequences analyses, three Sarcocystis sp. with a life cycle conformed by rodents as intermediate host (IH) and snakes as definitive hosts (DH) infecting the periurban micromammals surveyed.

{"title": "Coronary vessel formation in development and disease: mechanisms and insights for therapy.", "abstract": "The formation of new blood vessels after myocardial infarction (MI) is essential for the survival of existing and regenerated cardiac tissue. However, the extent of endogenous revascularization after MI is insufficient, and MI can often result in ventricular remodelling, progression to heart failure and premature death. The neutral results of numerous clinical trials that have evaluated the efficacy of angiogenic therapy to revascularize the infarcted heart reflect our poor understanding of the processes required to form a functional coronary vasculature. In this Review, we describe the latest advances in our understanding of the processes involved in coronary vessel formation, with mechanistic insights taken from developmental studies. Coronary vessels originate from multiple cellular sources during development and form through a number of distinct and carefully orchestrated processes. The ectopic reactivation of developmental programmes has been proposed as a new paradigm for regenerative medicine, therefore, a complete understanding of these processes is crucial. Furthermore, knowledge of how these processes differ between the embryonic and adult heart, and how they might be more closely recapitulated after injury are critical for our understanding of regenerative biology, and might facilitate the identification of tractable molecular targets to therapeutically promote neovascularization and regeneration of the infarcted heart.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

Whether SDH inhibition yields protection in diabetic individuals and translates into human cardiac tissue remain unknown. In isolated perfused hearts from 24 weeks old male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and age matched non-diabetic control rats and atrial trabeculae from patients with and without diabetes, we compared infarct size, contractile force recovery and mitochondrial function. The cardioprotective effect of a 10\u2009minutes DiMAL administration prior to global ischemia and ischemic preconditioning (IPC) was evaluated. In non-diabetic hearts exposed to IR, DiMAL 0.1\u2009mM reduced infarct size compared to IR (55\u2009\u00b1\u20097% vs. 69\u2009\u00b1\u20096%, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Mitochondrial respiration was reduced by DiMAL 0.6\u2009mM compared to sham and DiMAL 0.1\u2009mM (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

{"title": "Structural alterations and inflammation in the heart after multiple trauma followed by reamed versus non-reamed femoral nailing.", "abstract": "Approximately 30,000 patients with blunt cardiac trauma are recorded each year in the United States. Blunt cardiac injuries after trauma are associated with a longer hospital stay and a poor overall outcome. Organ damage after trauma is linked to increased systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns. However, the interplay between polytrauma and local cardiac injury is unclear. Additionally, the impact of surgical intervention on this process is currently unknown. This study aimed to determine local cardiac immunological and structural alterations after multiple trauma. Furthermore, the impact of the chosen fracture stabilization strategy (reamed versus non-reamed femoral nailing) on cardiac alterations was studied.\n15 male pigs were either exposed to multiple trauma (blunt chest trauma, laparotomy, liver laceration, femur fracture and haemorrhagic shock) or sham conditions. Blood samples as well as cardiac tissue were analysed 4 h and 6 h after trauma. Additionally, murine HL-1 cells were exposed to a defined polytrauma-cocktail, mimicking the pro-inflammatory conditions after multiple trauma in vitro.\nAfter multiple trauma, cardiac structural changes were observed in the left ventricle. More specifically, alterations in the alpha-actinin and desmin protein expression were found. Cardiac structural alterations were accompanied by enhanced local nitrosative stress, increased local inflammation and elevated systemic levels of the high-mobility group box 1 protein. Furthermore, cardiac alterations were observed predominantly in pigs that were treated by non-reamed intramedullary reaming. The polytrauma-cocktail impaired the viability of HL-1 cells in vitro, which was accompanied by a release of troponin I and HFABP.\nMultiple trauma induced cardiac structural alterations in vivo, which might contribute to the development of early myocardial damage (EMD). This study also revealed that reamed femoral nailing (reamed) is associated with more prominent immunological cardiac alterations compared to nailing without reaming (non-reamed). This suggests that the choice of the initial fracture treatment strategy might be crucial for the overall outcome as well as for any post-traumatic cardiac consequences.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2020-06-26", "authors": ["MeikeBaur", "BirteWeber", "InaLackner", "FlorianGebhard", "RomanPfeifer", "PaoloCinelli", "SaschaHalvachizadeh", "MichelTeuben", "MiriamLipiski", "NikolaCesarovic", "Hans-ChristophPape", "MiriamKalbitz"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0235220\n10.1186/1757-7241-22-9\n10.1016/j.injury.2014.08.051\n10.1007/s00268-016-3650-7\n10.1002/bjs.1800790123\n10.1038/s41598-017-18088-1\n10.1097/md.0000000000004248\n10.1007/s00402-011-1311-8\n10.1016/j.injury.2006.08.040\n10.3928/01477447-20140401-52\n10.1302/0301-620x.83b7.11593\n10.1016/j.injury.2017.04.017\n10.1097/01.ta.0000243203.38466.e0\n10.1016/j.aat.2013.03.007\n10.1084/jem.183.3.949\n10.1371/journal.pone.0187270\n10.1302/0301-620x.81b2.8988\n10.1097/00005373-199304000-00010\n10.1007/s00068-015-0504-1\n10.1038/srep39659\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.00013\n10.1097/shk.0000000000001400\n10.1371/journal.pone.0216862\n10.1097/shk.0000000000001400\n10.1016/S0940-2993(00)80111-6\n10.1016/j.bja.2018.03.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0187327\n10.1038/s41390-019-0505-6\n10.1016/j.bbi.2019.05.013\n10.1161/01.res.88.3.333\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.008\n10.1016/s0008-6363(00)00145-0\n10.1002/1097-0029(20010201)52:3<301::AID-JEMT1015>3.0.CO;2-Q\n10.1152/ajpcell.00458.2008\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181ef455b\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00406\n10.1161/01.RES.0000116143.74830.A9\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.05.010\n10.1111/j.1399-0004.2010.01512.x\n10.1083/jcb.200710049\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.04.004\n10.1302/0301-620x.90b3.19688\n10.1016/j.injury.2011.02.011\n10.1016/j.injury.2010.06.025\n10.1016/s0020-1383(10)70018-8\n10.1016/j.autrev.2004.08.009\n10.1016/j.ceca.2010.02.002\n10.1038/ncomms13344\n10.1007/s12576-016-0509-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.06.014\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00014\n10.6061/clinics/2019/e729\n10.1007/s10456-008-9093-5\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.01.014\n10.1096/fj.14-268730\n10.1096/fj.14-268730\n10.4049/jimmunol.1600091\n10.1152/japplphysiol.01149.2003\n10.4049/jimmunol.1600091"}
{"title": "Molecular Mechanisms of Cardiomyocyte Death in Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Homeostatic regulation of cardiomyocytes plays a crucial role in maintaining the normal physiological activity of cardiac tissue. Severe cardiotoxicity results in cardiac diseases including but not limited to arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and myocardial hypertrophy. Drug-induced cardiotoxicity limits or forbids further use of the implicated drugs. Such drugs that are currently available in the clinic include anti-tumor drugs (doxorubicin, cisplatin, trastuzumab, etc.), antidiabetic drugs (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone), and an antiviral drug (zidovudine). This review focused on cardiomyocyte death forms and related mechanisms underlying clinical drug-induced cardiotoxicity, including apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis, necroptosis, pryoptosis, and ferroptosis.

Recent studies and omics approaches suggest that phenotypic traits of longevity could converge in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway. The present study focuses on the comparative approach in heart tissue from 8 mammalian species with a ML ranging from 3.5 to 46\u00a0years. Gene expression, protein content, and concentration of regulatory metabolites of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) were measured using droplet digital PCR, western blot, and mass spectrometry, respectively. Our results demonstrate (1) the existence of differences in species-specific gene expression and protein content of mTORC1, (2) that the achievement of a high longevity phenotype correlates with decreased and inhibited mTORC1, (3) a decreased content of mTORC1 activators in long-lived animals, and (4) that these differences are independent of phylogeny.

{"title": "NLRX1 knockout aggravates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced heart injury and attenuates the anti-LPS cardioprotective effect of CYP2J2/11,12-EET by enhancing activation of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome.", "abstract": "NLRX1 weakens lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-\u03baB activation on immune cells. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase 2J2 (CYP2J2) attenuates LPS-induced cardiac injury by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation. However, it is still unclear whether NLRX1 could reduce LPS-induced heart damage and whether it is involved in the anti-LPS cardioprotective effect of CYP2J2. In this study, we found that NLRX1 knockout further exacerbated LPS-induced heart injury and up-regulated the proinflammatory cytokines in serum and heart tissue, and weakened the inhibitory effect of CYP2J2 on the harmful effects caused by LPS. We also found that LPS treatment induced ubiquitination of NLRX1 and promoted its binding to IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 in myocardial tissue, which should theoretically inhibit NF-\u03baB activation. However, LPS eventually leads to activation of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Under the action of LPS, CYP2J2 further promoted the ubiquitination of NLRX1 and its binding to IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, impaired NF-\u03baB activation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRX1 knockout notably aggravated LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and attenuated the inhibitory effects of CYP2J2 on NF-\u03baB signal and NLRP3 inflammasome. More, CYP2J2 reduced LPS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial depolarization in heart cells, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRX1 knockdown aggravated mitochondrial depolarization induced by LPS and weakened the protective effect of CYP2J2 on mitochondrial potential, although it had no significant effect on reactive oxygen species production. Together, these findings demonstrated that NLRX1 knockout aggravated LPS-induced heart injury and weakened the anti-LPS cardioprotective effect of CYP2J2 by enhancing activation of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2020-06-24", "authors": ["GangZhao", "XiaotingWang", "SabrinaEdwards", "MeiyanDai", "JianfengLi", "LujinWu", "RongXu", "JinxiangHan", "HaitaoYuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173276"}

We have examined the protective role of flaxseed (FS) against diesel exhaust particles (DEPs)- and/or fenitrothion (FNT)-induced fetal cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis. A total of 48 timed pregnant rats were divided into eight groups (n\u2009=\u20096). The first group was saved as the control and the second fed on 20% FS diet. Animals in the third, fourth, and fifth groups were administered with DEPs (2.0\u00a0mg/kg), FNT (3.76\u00a0mg/kg), and their combination, respectively, while the sixth, seventh, and eighth groups were supplemented with 20% FS through intoxication with DEPs, FNT, and their combination, respectively. Our results revealed that DEPs and/or FNT significantly elevated the level of protein carbonyl and superoxide dismutase activity in the fetal cardiac tissues. However, the catalase activity and total thiol level were decreased; besides the histopathological alterations were remarked. Moreover, DEPs and/or FNT exhibited significant down-regulation in the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and paraoxonase-1 gene expression, and up-regulation in the apoptotic (Bax and caspase-3) gene expression along with DNA fragmentation. Remarkably, FS supplementation significantly ameliorated the fetal cardiac oxidative injury, down-regulated the expression of the apoptotic genes, up-regulated the anti-apoptotic and paraoxonase-1 gene expression, reduced DNA fragmentation, and alleviated the myocardial cell architectures. These findings revealed that FS attenuates DEPs- and/or FNT-induced apoptotic cell death by repairing the disturbance in the anti-apoptotic/pro-apoptotic gene balance toward cell survival in the fetal myocardial cells.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2020-06-24", "authors": ["Khairy AIbrahim", "Hala AAbdelgaid", "Mohamed AliEl-Desouky", "Abdelgawad AliFahmi", "Mohamed MAbdel-Daim"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-020-09585-3"}

Here, the design and fabrication of a unique patch are presented with distinct regions for adhesion and function, resulting in a biomaterial patch resembling the Band-Aid. The adhesive region contains a novel polymer, synthesized to incorporate a molecule capable of adhesion to tissue, dopamine. The desired polymer composition for patch development is selected based on chemical assessment and evaluation of key physical properties such as swelling and elastic modulus, which are tailored for use in soft tissue applications. The selected polymer formulation, referred to as the adhesive patch (AP) polymer, demonstrates negligible cytotoxicity and improves adhesive capability to rat cardiac tissue compared to currently used patch materials.

Moreover, QDG treatment reduced the degree of myocardial fiber disarray, degeneration and necrosis of myocardial cells, expression of ANP and BNP, as well as collagen content of SHRs. Moreover, we further assessed the effect of QDG treatment on cardiac inflammation and found that QDG treatment reduced CD68 protein expression, decreased levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in both serum and cardiac tissues, as well as suppressed activation of NF-\u03baB pathway in cardiac tissues of SHRs.

We aimed to investigate the roles of lncRNA MIAT and miR-330-5p in modulating inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in lipopolysachariden (LPS)-induced septic cardiomyopathy. Serum and heart tissue were collected from in vivo septic mice model, ELISA and qRT-PCR were used to measure the expression of pro-inflammation cytokines, MIAT and miR-330-5p, respectively. The knockdown of MIAT and overexpression of miR-330-5p were conducted to assess their effects on regulating inflammation response and intracellular oxidative stress in LPS-stimulated HL-1 cells. The reactive oxygen (ROS) level, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), GSH/GSSH ratio, and lipid peroxidation assessment (MDA) were used to evaluate the intracellular oxidative stress. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the association between MIAT and miR-330-5p, TRAF6 and miR-330-5p, respectively. In septic mice, the expression of MIAT and pro-inflammation cytokines was elevated while the expression of miR-330-5p decreased. Knockdown of MIAT or overexpression of miR-330-5p restrained inflammation and oxidative stress induced by LPS in vitro; MIAT directly targeted miR-330-5p to regulate NF-\u03baB signaling, and miR-330-5p targeted against TRAF6 to suppress the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling. We determined that lncRNA MIAT directly binds to miR-330-5p to activate TRAF6/NF-\u03baB signaling axis and further promotes inflammation response as well as oxidative stress in LPS-induced septic cardiomyopathy.

Joint exposure of TCS, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, hereafter referred to as TCS-DT, contributes severe toxicity to aquatic organisms. There is currently a paucity of data regarding TCS-DT molecular toxicity, especially on cardiac diseases. We used zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism, and evaluated the molecular-level cardiotoxicity induced by TCS-DT from embryonic to adult stages. TCS-DT exposure prominently led to phenotypic malformations, such as pericardial cysts, cardiac bleeding, increased SV-BA distance, decreased heart rate and reduced ejection fraction, as well as abnormal swimming behavior. Analyses of the GO and KEGG pathways revealed enrichment pathways related to cardiac development and screened for significantly down-regulated adrenaline signaling in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac marker genes (amhc, cmlc2, vmhc, and nkx2.5) were obtained through protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and expressed as down-regulation by WISH. After chronic exposure to TCS-DT from 30 to 90-dpf, both body mass and heart indexes prominently increased, showing myocardial hypertrophy, abnormal heart rate and histopathological injury. Heart tissue damage included disordered and ruptured myocardial fibers, broken and dissolved myofilaments, nuclear pyknosis, mitochondrial injury and inflammatory cell infiltration. Further, abnormal changes in a series of cardiac functions-related biomarkers, including superoxide dismutase, triglyceride, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase MB, provided evidence for cardiac pathological responses.

Oxypaeoniflorin (OPA) has been found to be the main constituent of Paeonia veitchii Lynch. This study was conducted to explore the effect of OPA on MI/R injury and its potential mechanism. An in vivo MI/R injury model was established by transient coronary ligation in BALB/c mice, and an in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model was established with rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells. Echocardiographic assessments demonstrated that OPA significantly reduced disruption of cardiac function and improved the indicators of ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results suggested that OPA significantly reduced the release of myocardial infarction-related factors, such as the creatine kinase (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Additionally, hematoxylin-eosin (HandE) staining demonstrated that OPA markedly inhibited the myocardial apoptosis and necrosis caused by MI/R. Consistently, the results obtained from the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays revealed that OPA obviously reversed the H/R-induced decrease in cell activity and increase in apoptosis of H9c2 cells. Furthermore, western blot assays indicated that OPA inhibited apoptosis by activating the Sirt1 (silent information regulator factor 2 related enzyme 1)/Foxo1(forkhead transcription factor FKHR) signaling pathway in myocardial tissues and H9c2 cells. Collectively, these novel findings are the first to provide strong evidence that OPA attenuates MI/R injury by activating the Sirt1 (silent information regulator factor 2 related enzyme 1)/Foxo1(forkhead transcription factor FKHR) signaling-mediated anti-apoptotic pathway.", "journal": "Acta biochimica Polonica", "date": "2020-06-19", "authors": ["KaiWang", "WeiHu"], "doi": "10.18388/abp.2020_5206"}

{"title": "Molecular and Biomechanical Clues From Cardiac Tissue Decellularized Extracellular Matrix Drive Stromal Cell Plasticity.", "abstract": "Decellularized-organ-derived extracellular matrix (dECM) has been used for many years in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The manufacturing of hydrogels from dECM allows to make use of the pro-regenerative properties of the ECM and, simultaneously, to shape the material in any necessary way. The objective of the present project was to investigate differences between cardiovascular tissues (left ventricle, mitral valve, and aorta) with respect to generating dECM hydrogels and their interaction with cells in 2D and 3D. The left ventricle, mitral valve, and aorta of porcine hearts were decellularized using a series of detergent treatments (SDS, Triton-X 100 and deoxycholate). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics yielded the ECM proteins composition of the dECM. The dECM was digested with pepsin and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4). Upon warming to 37\u00b0C, the suspension turns into a gel. Hydrogel stiffness was determined for samples with a dECM concentration of 20 mg/mL. Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASC) and a combination of ASC with human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVEC) were cultured, respectively, on and in hydrogels to analyze cellular plasticity in 2D and vascular network formation in 3D. Differentiation of ASC was induced with 10 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b21 and SM22\u03b1 used as differentiation marker. 3D vascular network formation was evaluated with confocal microscopy after immunofluorescent staining of PECAM-1. In dECM, the most abundant protein was collagen VI for the left ventricle and mitral valve and elastin for the aorta. The stiffness of the hydrogel derived from the aorta (6,998 \u00b1 895 Pa) was significantly higher than those derived from the left ventricle (3,384 \u00b1 698 Pa) and the mitral valve (3,233 \u00b1 323 Pa) (One-way ANOVA, ", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2020-06-18", "authors": ["Gabriel RomeroLiguori", "T\u00e1cia Tavares AquinasLiguori", "S\u00e9rgio Rodriguesde Moraes", "ViktorSinkunas", "VincenzoTerlizzi", "Joris Avan Dongen", "Prashant KSharma", "Luiz Felipe PinhoMoreira", "Martin ConradHarmsen"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2020.00520\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.09.035\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0036\n10.1517/14796694.1.1.23\n10.1074/jbc.M803142200\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.08.041\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77225-5\n10.1083/jcb.200107049\n10.1016/j.trsl.2013.11.003\n10.1007/s12195-008-0022-x\n10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333194\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.023\n10.1371/journal.pone.0133056\n10.1016/j.mimet.2006.04.023\n10.1038/s41467-018-02906-9\n10.1038/ncomms7365\n10.1038/nmat4489\n10.1074/jbc.M703341200\n10.1074/jbc.M109.096479\n10.1155/2012/979351\n10.1016/s1350-4533(02)00010-3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.072\n10.3109/08977198909069082\n10.22203/ecm.v023a31\n10.1186/s13287-016-0418-9\n10.1007/s12265-011-9304-0\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2016.0538\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.12.015\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.08.008\n10.3109/03008208209160269\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.037\n10.1111/jcmm.12776\n10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19970601)65:3<395::aid-jcb9>3.0.co;2-n\n10.1088/0957-4484/25/1/014011\n10.1007/s00125-018-4713-0\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0605\n10.1042/bj3020527\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601768\n10.1155/2016/6397820\n10.1517/14712598.2010.534079\n10.5507/bp.2013.076\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.026\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1047-2_10\n10.1088/0957-4484/22/49/494015\n10.1007/s10856-016-5730-5\n10.1002/jbm.b.33865\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.03.005\n10.1091/mbc.e04-08-0695\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.12.007\n10.1038/labinvest.3780385\n10.1590/1414-431X20176382\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0189\n10.1155/2019/5387850\n10.1186/1423-0127-17-56\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.05.004\n10.4161/cc.28401\n10.1002/adma.201303680\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2012.0088\n10.4081/or.2012.e36\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.158\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.11.022\n10.1111/asj.12116\n10.1152/ajpheart.00321.2005\n10.1016/j.exer.2015.02.015\n10.1016/j.jim.2010.09.008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.022\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.02.019\n10.1159/000324896\n10.1128/mBio.00497-13\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0620\n10.1177/0885328216656099\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000121425.42966.F1\n10.1074/jbc.M109540200\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0425\n10.1016/j.matbio.2015.05.005\n10.1006/excr.1999.4540\n10.1089/biores.2015.0030\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.068\n10.1039/C4RA07915A\n10.1016/j.jsb.2003.08.002\n10.3791/2109\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.06.030\n10.1038/ng1557\n10.1074/jbc.M110.188615\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.11.046\n10.1016/S0741-5214(97)70254-4\n10.1016/j.exer.2011.08.009\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.045\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.888\n10.1002/btm2.10078\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.05.012\n10.1002/jbm.a.35850\n10.1002/stem.2726\n10.1038/nrm1130\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0592\n10.22203/eCM.v027a17\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.01.009\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.03.024\n10.1038/s41598-017-16201-y\n10.1159/000322399\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.03.016\n10.1039/C5TB02564H\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.12.035\n10.1002/hep.22193\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.06.051\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.01.027\n10.1021/acsami.5b09746\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.12.035\n10.1128/MCB.24.2.638-650.2004\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.02.006"}
{"title": "Insights From Computational Modeling Into the Contribution of Mechano-Calcium Feedback on the Cardiac End-Systolic Force-Length Relationship.", "abstract": "In experimental studies on cardiac tissue, the end-systolic force-length relation (ESFLR) has been shown to depend on the mode of contraction: isometric or isotonic. The isometric ESFLR is derived from isometric contractions spanning a range of muscle lengths while the isotonic ESFLR is derived from shortening contractions across a range of afterloads. The ESFLR of isotonic contractions consistently lies below its isometric counterpart. Despite the passing of over a hundred years since the first insight by Otto Frank, the mechanism(s) underlying this protocol-dependent difference in the ESFLR remain incompletely explained. Here, we investigate the role of mechano-calcium feedback in accounting for the difference between these two ESFLRs. Previous studies have compared the dynamics of isotonic contractions to those of a single isometric contraction at a length that produces maximum force, without considering isometric contractions at shorter muscle lengths.

Baicalein (BL) is a natural flavone with multiple therapeutic properties. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential protective effect of BL supplementation in hypercholesterolaemic rats. Rats were fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) for six weeks and then orally administered BL at two doses (25 and 50 mg/kg body weight/day) for four weeks. Serum lipids, liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes, renal markers, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-10 (IL-10), caspase-3, nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin-2 (PGE-2) were measured. In renal, hepatic, and cardiac tissues, thiobarbituric acid-reactive (TBARS) substance, glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were measured. The altered levels of lipoproteins, aminotransferases, creatine kinases, and urea in hypercholesterolemic animals were significantly corrected by BL. Inflammatory and apoptotic biomarkers were also markedly attenuated in the HCD group following BL treatment. Hypercholesterolemia considerably induced the lipid peroxidation product, TBARS, and oxidative radicals in cardiac, hepatic, and renal tissues, which were attenuated by BL treatment, particularly, at the 50 mg/kg/day dose. BL enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase that were suppressed by HCD. Histological alterations induced by cholesterol overload in cardiac, hepatic, and renal tissues were ameliorated by BL supplementation. Our results show that the BL treatments (25 and 50 mg/kg/day) to HCD fed rats improved all the altered parameters. These results demonstrate that BL treatment improves cardiac, renal and hepatic dysfunctions in hypercholesterolaemic rats by activation of cellular antioxidant enzymes and/or suppression of inflammatory cytokines.", "journal": "International journal of medical sciences", "date": "2020-06-18", "authors": ["Abdulaziz MsAlSaad", "MohamedMohany", "Mohammed SAlmalki", "IbrahimAlmutham", "Abdulwahab AAlahmari", "MohammedAlSulaiman", "Salim SAl-Rejaie"], "doi": "10.7150/ijms.46108"}

Preventive, diagnostic, and treatment measures available for CVDs are not very useful, which demands promising alternative methods. Nanoscience and nanotechnology open a new window in the area of CVDs with an opportunity to achieve effective treatment, better prognosis, and less adverse effects on non-target tissues. The application of nanoparticles and nanocarriers in the area of cardiology has gathered much attention due to the properties such as passive and active targeting to the cardiac tissues, improved target specificity, and sensitivity.

{"title": "Targeted Metabolomic Analysis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB Mouse Model Reveals an Imbalance of Branched-Chain Amino Acid and Fatty Acid Metabolism.", "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are inherited disorders of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism. The defective digestion of GAGs within the intralysosomal compartment of affected patients leads to a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from cardiovascular disease to neurological impairment. The molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of the disease downstream of the genetic mutation of genes encoding for lysosomal enzymes still remain unclear. Here, we applied a targeted metabolomic approach to a mouse model of PS IIIB, using a platform dedicated to the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders, in order to identify amino acid and fatty acid metabolic pathway alterations or the manifestations of other metabolic phenotypes. Our analysis highlighted an increase in the levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: Val, Ile, and Leu), aromatic amino acids (Tyr and Phe), free carnitine, and acylcarnitines in the liver and heart tissues of MPS IIIB mice as compared to the wild type (WT). Moreover, Ala, Met, Glu, Gly, Arg, Orn, and Cit amino acids were also found upregulated in the liver of MPS IIIB mice. These findings show a specific impairment of the BCAA and fatty acid catabolism in the heart of MPS IIIB mice. In the liver of affected mice, the glucose-alanine cycle and urea cycle resulted in being altered alongside a deregulation of the BCAA metabolism. Thus, our data demonstrate that an accumulation of BCAAs occurs secondary to lysosomal GAG storage, in both the liver and the heart of MPS IIIB mice. Since BCAAs regulate the biogenesis of lysosomes and autophagy mechanisms through mTOR signaling, impacting on lipid metabolism, this condition might contribute to the progression of the MPS IIIB disease.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-06-18", "authors": ["ValeriaDe Pasquale", "MariannaCaterino", "MicheleCostanzo", "RobertaFedele", "MargheritaRuoppolo", "Luigi MichelePavone"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21124211\n10.21037/atm.2018.11.39\n10.1038/s41572-018-0025-4\n10.1074/jbc.R110.134452\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.01.006\n10.1042/EBC20170055\n10.1036/ommbid.165\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.07.013\n10.1016/j.beem.2014.08.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131662\n10.1016/j.omtm.2018.05.002\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2018.08.003\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2018.01.003\n10.1038/s41419-017-0187-0\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.165539\n10.3390/cells9040979\n10.3390/ijms21072515\n10.1111/jnc.14672\n10.1111/jnc.14632\n10.3390/ijms21072566\n10.3390/ijms21041204\n10.1073/pnas.96.25.14505\n10.3390/biom10030355\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2009.06.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0233050\n10.1159/000477493\n10.1007/s10545-017-0074-y\n10.1007/s10545-017-0080-0\n10.1007/s11011-017-0009-1\n10.1016/j.cca.2017.09.024\n10.1186/s12967-018-1625-1\n10.3390/ijms20020446\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.01.024\n10.3390/metabo9020036\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.10.013\n10.1074/jbc.M109.020818\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2016.12.025\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00853\n10.3390/ijms19040954\n10.1042/bj20031048\n10.1074/jbc.M705124200\n10.4161/auto.3906\n10.4161/auto.5227\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1046671\n10.1172/JCI94130\n10.15698/mic2016.12.546\n10.1016/j.cmet.2016.03.013\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.023\n10.1038/ncb1753\n10.1126/science.1157535\n10.1016/j.molmed.2012.05.007\n10.1038/ncb2152\n10.1126/science.1232044\n10.1074/jbc.M116.732511\n10.1242/jcs.222570\n10.4161/auto.19469\n10.1126/science.1204592\n10.1042/EBC20170027\n10.1111/jnc.14564\n10.1016/j.molmed.2016.12.003\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00239\n10.3390/jcm9020344\n10.1093/brain/awu355\n10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.020\n10.1016/j.nmd.2012.01.009\n10.1021/jm400947b\n10.1002/ar.21353\n10.1038/s41598-018-22869-7\n10.1039/C5MB00736D\n10.3390/ijms19113580\n10.1039/C4MB00729H\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2014.08.020\n10.1096/fj.201800724R\n10.3390/ijms21020582"}
{"title": "Transcriptome analysis reveals molecular strategies in gills and heart of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) under hypoxia stress.", "abstract": "The gills and heart are two major targets of hypoxia in fish. However, the molecular responses in fish gills and heart to hypoxia challenge remain unclear. Here, RNA-Seq technology was used to study the gene expression profiles in gills and heart of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) at 6, 24, and 48\u00a0h after hypoxia stress. A total of 1,546 and 2,746 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in gills and heart, respectively. Expression changes of nine genes in each tissue were further validated by the qPCR. Based on KEGG and Gene ontology enrichments, we found that various innate immunity-related genes, such as complement components (C1qs, C2, C3, C6, and C7), chemokines (CCL3, CCL17, CCL19, CCL25, and CXCL8_L3), chemokine receptors (CCR9, CXCR1, and CXCR3), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), were significantly down-regulated in gills and/or heart, suggesting that innate immune processes mediated by these genes may be inhibited by hypoxia. The genes involved in both glycolysis pathway (LDHA) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (IDH2 and OGDH) were up-regulated in gills and heart of hypoxic large yellow croakers, possibly because gill and heart tissues need enough energy to accelerate gas exchange and blood circulation. Hypoxia also affected the ion transport in gills of large yellow croaker, through down-regulating the expression levels of numerous classical ion transporters, including HVCN1, SLC20A2, SLC4A4, RHBG, RHCG, and SCN4A, suggesting an energy conservation strategy to hypoxia stress. All these results indicate that the immune processes, glycolytic pathways, and ion transport were significantly altered in gills and/or heart of large yellow croaker under hypoxia, possibly contributing to maintain cellular energy balance during hypoxia. Our data, therefore, afford new information to understand the tissue-specific molecular responses of bony fish to hypoxia stress.", "journal": "Fish & shellfish immunology", "date": "2020-06-17", "authors": ["YinnanMu", "WanruLi", "ZuyunWei", "LianghuaHe", "WeiniZhang", "XinhuaChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fsi.2020.06.028"}

In cardiac repairs specifically, approaches are developed for intramyocardial delivery of cells and the epicardial delivery of tissue-engineered cardiac patches, providing benefit of cell localization and tissue structure, respectively. However, to improve cell retention and integration, there is a need for the intramyocardial delivery of functional tissues while preserving anisotropic muscle alignment. Here, a biodegradable z-wire scaffold that supports the scalable gel-free production of an array of functional cardiac tissues in a 384-well plate format is developed. The z-wire scaffold design supports cellular alignment, provides tunable mechanical support, and allows for tissue contraction. When the scaffold is imparted with magnetic properties, individual tissues can be assembled with macroscopic alignment under magnetic guidance. When used in combination with a customized surgical delivery tool, z-wire tissues can be injected directly into the myocardial wall, with controlled tissue orientation according to the injection path. This modular tissue engineering approach, in combination with the use of smart scaffolds, can expand opportunity in functional tissue delivery.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2020-06-17", "authors": ["Luis EduardoPortillo-Esquivel", "VibudhaNanduri", "FengZhang", "WenbinLiang", "BoyangZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202000358"}

Especially young BHV recipients may experience a structural valve deterioration caused by an immune reaction in which \u03b1-Gal and Neu5Gc are potential target antigens. The expression of these and other carbohydrate antigens in animal tissues used for production of BHV was explored. Protein lysates of porcine aortic and pulmonary valves, and porcine, bovine and equine pericardia were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-carbohydrate antibodies and lectins. N-glycans were released by PNGase F digestion and O-glycans by \u03b2-elimination. Released oligosaccharides were analyzed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 102 N-glycans and 40 O-glycans were identified in animal heart tissue lysates. The N- and O-glycan patterns were different between species. \u03b1-Gal and Neu5Gc were identified on both N- and O-linked glycans, N,N\u00b4-diacetyllactosamine (LacdiNAc) on N-glycans only and sulfated O-glycans. The relative amounts of \u03b1-Gal-containing N-glycans were higher in bovine compared to equine and porcine pericardia. In contrast to the restricted number of proteins carrying \u03b1-Gal and LacdiNAc, the distribution of proteins carrying Neu5Gc-determinants varied between species and between different tissues of the same species. Porcine pericardium carried the highest level of Neu5Gc-sialylated O-glycans, and bovine pericardium the highest level of Neu5Gc-sialylated N-glycans.

Trif knockout mice and their littermates were osmotically administrated with aldosterone (50 \u03bcg/kg per day) for 21 and 42 days. The cardiac structural analysis, functional parameters, and mitochondrial function were measured. Aldosterone dose- or time-dependently increased the levels of TRIF in primary mouse cardiomyocytes or mouse heart tissues. Trif deficiency protected against aldosterone-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and dysfunction. Moreover, Trif deficiency also suppressed aldosterone-induced cardiac inflammatory response and mitochondrial injuries. Mechanistically, overexpression of cardiac microRNAs (miR)-34a reversed the cardiac benefits of Trif deficiency in aldosterone-treated mice. Taken together, Trif/miR-34a axis could provide a novel molecular mechanism for explaining aldosterone-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and functional disorders.", "journal": "Clinical science (London, England : 1979)", "date": "2020-06-17", "authors": ["ShaojunLi", "WeiCao", "BaiWang", "EnboZhan", "JianXu", "ShufengLi"], "doi": "10.1042/CS20200249"}
{"title": "Cardiac transcriptional and metabolic changes following thoracotomy.", "abstract": "Non-cardiac surgery is associated with significant cardiovascular complications. Reported mortality rate ranges from 1.9% to 4% in unselected patients. A postoperative surge in pro-inflammatory cytokines is a well-known feature and putative contributor to these complications. Despite much clinical research, little is known about the biomolecular changes in cardiac tissue following non-cardiac surgery. In order to increase our understanding, we analyzed whole-transcriptional and metabolic profiling data sets from hearts of mice harvested two, four, and six weeks following isolated thoracotomy. Hearts from healthy litter-mates served as controls. Functional network enrichment analyses showed a distinct impact on cardiac transcription two weeks after surgery characterized by a downregulation of mitochondrial pathways in the absence of significant metabolic alterations. Transcriptional changes were not detectable four and six weeks following surgery. Our study shows distinct and reversible transcriptional changes within the first two weeks following isolated thoracotomy.

Despite its vast therapeutic uses, it is known to trigger strict cardiac toxicity. The objective of the current study was to examine the protective role of metformin (MET) and/or low dose radiation (LDR) on cardiotoxicity and apoptosis induced by CP in rats. CP (200\u00a0mg/kg i.p) induces cardiotoxicity and apoptosis as indicated by elevation of troponin, cardiac caspase-3 and Endothelin-I (ET-1). While, treatment with MET (150\u00a0mg/kg, orally for 14\u00a0days) and/or LDR (0.5\u00a0Gy) before CP hindered CP-induced toxicity. By estimating the apoptotic index (BAX/Bcl-2 ratio) CP showed significantly the highest BAX/Bcl-2 ratio. Administration of MET and/or LDR showed a significant improvement in oxidative stress indices and reverse the inhibitory effect of CP on SIRT-1. Also, Histological examination of cardiac tissues showed a sign of necrosis of myocardium after CP treatment.

In treatment two groups, the electroacupuncture was also performed 48 and 24 hr before the operation, with the same protocol as treatment 1. Control 1 and control 2 groups had the same procedures like the treatment ones, except for acupuncture. Immediately after reperfusion, the samples of brains and hearts were taken and prepared for microscopic examination. Histopathological study of the heart in the control and treatment groups showed the breakage of myofibrils, hyaline necrosis, edema and disorganization of myocytes. The severity of cardiac lesions was decreased in both treatment groups in comparison with the controls. Brain in control and treatment groups showed ischemic necrosis, disorganization of the neurons in the hippocampus, and edema. The severity of lesions was reduced in the treatment groups and showed a significant difference between the control and treatment 1.

Hence the present research was focussed to scientifically prove the effect of T. bellirica in support of its traditionally claimed use as cardioprotective agent.\nThe aim and objective of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of T. bellirica (Roxb.) against drugs viz. Doxorubicin (DOX) and Isoproterenol (ISO) induced cardiotoxicity in wistar albino rats.\nCardiotoxicity was induced using DOX (15\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) and ISO (85\u00a0mg/kg s.c.) models. Methanolic extract of T. bellirica (METB) was subjected to rats in two different doses (low dose of 250\u00a0mg/kg p.o.; and high dose of 500\u00a0mg/kg p.o.) for the purpose of investigation of various biochemical markers present in cardiac tissue as well as in blood serum, in order to assess the improvement in drugs induced cardiotoxicity. Also, the histopathological study was carried out in terms of ultrastructural changes occurred in the myocardium during drugs induced cardiomyopathy, to ensure the proposed cardioprotective effect of METB.\nBiochemical investigation of cardiac tissue using METB showed significant decrease in CK-MB (creatine kinase-muscle/brain) activity and MDA (malondialdehyde) levels and increase in GSH (reduced glutathione) levels. It also increased the activity of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase). In serum, METB increased the levels of oxidative stress markers like ALP (alkaline phosphatase), UA (uric acid), ALT (alanine transferase), and AST (aspartate transaminase) near to their normal values as in control group. The use of METB also decreased the levels of total cholesterol and TGs (triglycerides) in serum and significantly increased HDL (high density lipoprotein) levels. Treatment with METB also proved a considerable restoration in histopathological findings of myocardium.\nIn the present study it was concluded that T. bellirica fruit has profound potential for the treatment of drugs induced cardiotoxicity suggesting the consumption of T. bellirica for cardiac benefits during routine treatment of cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2020-06-14", "authors": ["RahulChaudhary", "RichaSingh", "RajeevVerma", "PrashantKumar", "NitinKumar", "LubhanSingh", "SadishKumar S"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2020.113080"}

{"title": "Toward Cardiac Regeneration: Combination of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Therapies and Bioengineering Strategies.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases represent the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Multiple studies have been conducted so far in order to develop treatments able to prevent the progression of these pathologies. Despite progress made in the last decade, current therapies are still hampered by poor translation into actual clinical applications. The major drawback of such strategies is represented by the limited regenerative capacity of the cardiac tissue. Indeed, after an ischaemic insult, the formation of fibrotic scar takes place, interfering with mechanical and electrical functions of the heart. Hence, the ability of the heart to recover after ischaemic injury depends on several molecular and cellular pathways, and the imbalance between them results into adverse remodeling, culminating in heart failure. In this complex scenario, a new chapter of regenerative medicine has been opened over the past 20 years with the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These cells share the same characteristic of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but are generated from patient-specific somatic cells, overcoming the ethical limitations related to ESC use and providing an autologous source of human cells. Similarly to ESCs, iPSCs are able to efficiently differentiate into cardiomyocytes (CMs), and thus hold a real regenerative potential for future clinical applications. However, cell-based therapies are subjected to poor grafting and may cause adverse effects in the failing heart. Thus, over the last years, bioengineering technologies focused their attention on the improvement of both survival and functionality of iPSC-derived CMs. The combination of these two fields of study has burst the development of cell-based three-dimensional (3D) structures and organoids which mimic, more realistically, the ", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2020-06-13", "authors": ["MartaMazzola", "ElisaDi Pasquale"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2020.00455\n10.1186/s12929-014-0100-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.108\n10.1038/d41586-018-05278-8\n10.3390/polym11122113\n10.1371/journal.pone.0201650\n10.1021/acsami.7b15019\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1039/C5RA01851J\n10.1371/journal.pone.0196714\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.727420\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029055\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.03.009\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.11.026\n10.1371/journal.pone.0173222\n10.1039/C9BM00434C\n10.1002/adfm.201908612\n10.1371/journal.pone.0173222\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00050\n10.7554/eLife.47970\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.499\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.12.019\n10.1101/786657\n10.1016/j.jbiosc.2014.04.001\n10.1038/srep03733"}

{"title": "Pro-Senescence and Anti-Senescence Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Aging: Cardiac MicroRNA Regulation of Longevity Drug-Induced Autophagy.", "abstract": "Chronological aging as well as biological aging accelerated by various pathologies such as diabetes and obesity contribute to cardiovascular aging, and structural and functional tissue damage of the heart and vasculature. Cardiovascular aging in humans is characterized by structural pathologic remodeling including cardiac and vascular fibrosis, hypertrophy, stiffness, micro- and macro-circulatory impairment, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction precipitating heart failure with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction, and cardiovascular cell death. Cellular senescence, an important hallmark of aging, is a critical factor that impairs repair and regeneration of damaged cells in cardiovascular tissues whereas autophagy, an intracellular catabolic process is an essential inherent mechanism that removes senescent cells throughout life time in all tissues. Several recent reviews have highlighted the fact that all longevity treatment paradigms to mitigate progression of aging-related pathologies converge in induction of autophagy, activation of AMP kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin pathway, and inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). These longevity treatments include health style changes such as caloric restriction, and drug treatments using rapamycin, the first FDA-approved longevity drug, as well as other experimental longevity drugs such as metformin, rapamycin, aspirin, and resveratrol.

In this study, we aimed to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in hypoxia adaptation in Tibetan chickens and Daheng broilers, to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying hypoxia induction. RNA sequencing results revealed that a total of 5504 lncRNAs and 16,779 microRNAs were differentially expressed in four Tibetan chickens and four Daheng broilers; 70 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 113 lncRNAs were down-regulated in the Tibetan chickens compared to the expression levels in the Daheng broilers. The differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were enriched in the following Gene ontology terms: protein complex localization, small-molecule metabolic process, and RNA splicing. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that the DElncRNAs were mainly enriched in pathways that regulate cell junctions and intercellular spaces and oxygen or energy metabolism, mainly involved in hypoxic adaption. Moreover, a predicted ceRNA network with five DElncRNAs interacted with three miRNAs that acted on 42 pathways through 19 target genes.

It remains poorly understood whether pro-inflammatory factors released from non-cardiac tissues contribute to the non-autonomous regulation of age-related cardiac dysfunction. Here, we report that age-dependent induction of cytokine unpaired 3 (upd3) in Drosophila oenocytes (hepatocyte-like cells) is the primary non-autonomous mechanism for cardiac aging. We show that upd3 is significantly up-regulated in aged oenocytes. Oenocyte-specific knockdown of upd3 is sufficient to block aging-induced cardiac arrhythmia. We further show that the age-dependent induction of upd3 is triggered by impaired peroxisomal import and elevated JNK signaling in aged oenocytes. We term hormonal factors induced by peroxisome dysfunction as peroxikines. Intriguingly, oenocyte-specific overexpression of Pex5, the key peroxisomal import receptor, blocks age-related upd3 induction and alleviates cardiac arrhythmicity. Thus, our studies identify an important role of hepatocyte-specific peroxisomal import in mediating non-autonomous regulation of cardiac aging.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2020-06-12", "authors": ["KeruiHuang", "TingMiao", "KaiChang", "JinohKim", "PingKang", "QiuhanJiang", "Andrew JSimmonds", "FrancescaDi Cara", "HuaBai"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16781-w"}

Secondly, we used the RegRNA website to predict downstream miRNA, and we performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. RESULTS CircCDYL was downregulated in myocardial tissues and hypoxia myocardial cells, and overexpression and downregulation of circCDYL improved and aggravated, respectively, heart function after AMI. CircCDYL overexpression and downregulation can promote and inhibit, respectively, proliferation of cardiomyocytes in vitro. Finally, we found that circCDYL can sponge miR-4793-5p and regulate its expression, and then miR-4793-5p regulates APP expression.

The larvae within brooding adults sampled during 2017 and 2018 were also preserved. Molecular analysis of all samples was performed in 2019. The DNA of B. exitiosa was confirmed to be present within the gill tissue of one oyster within the Portsmouth wild fishery seabed population (n\u00a0=\u00a048), sampled in November 2015; the congeneric parasite Bonamia ostreae was not detected in this individual. This is the earliest record of B. exitiosa in the Solent. Concurrent presence of both B. ostreae and B. exitiosa, determined by DNA presence, was confirmed in the gill and heart tissue of three mature individuals from broodstock cages sampled in October 2017 (n\u00a0=\u00a099), two from a location on the River Hamble and one from the Camber Dock in Portsmouth Harbour. B. exitiosa was not detected in the November 2018 broodstock populations. A total of six larval broods were positive for B. exitiosa, with five also positive for B. ostreae. None of the brooding adults were positive for B. exitiosa suggesting that horizontal transmission from the surrounding environment to the brooding larvae is occurring.

{"title": "Bipolar Radiofrequency Ablation on Explanted Human Hearts: How to Ensure Transmural Lesions.", "abstract": "Bipolar radiofrequency (RF) clamps have been shown to be capable of reproducibly creating transmural lesions with a single ablation in animal models. Unfortunately in clinical experience the bipolar clamps have not been as effective and often require multiple ablations to create conduction block. This study created a new experimental model using fresh, cardioplegically arrested human hearts turned down for transplant to evaluate the performance of a nonirrigated bipolar RF clamp.\nNine human hearts turned down for transplant were harvested, and the Cox-Maze IV lesion set was performed with a nonirrigated bipolar RF clamp. In the first 7 hearts a single ablation was performed for each lesion. In the last 2 hearts a set of 2 successive ablations without unclamping were performed. The heart tissue was stained with 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride. Each ablation lesion was cross-sectioned to assess lesion depth and transmurality.\nA single ablation with the bipolar RF clamp resulted in 89% (469/529) of the histologic sections and 65% (42/65) of the lesions being transmural.

Improvement of the selectivity of transgene expression can be achieved through incorporation of target sites (TSs) for miRNA-122 and miRNA-206 into the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the expression cassette. Here, we aimed to generate such miRNA-122- and miRNA-206-regulated AAV9 vector for a therapeutic, heart-specific overexpression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). We successfully validated the vector functionality in murine cell lines corresponding to tissues targeted by AAV9. Next, we evaluated biodistribution of transgene expression following systemic vector delivery to HO-1-deficient mice of mixed C57BL/6J\u00a0\u00d7 FVB genetic background. Although AAV genomes were present in the hearts of these animals, HO-1 protein expression was either absent or significantly impaired. We found that miRNA-122, earlier described as liver specific, was present also in the hearts of C57BL/6J\u00a0\u00d7 FVB mice. Various levels of miRNA-122 expression were observed in the hearts of other mouse strains, in heart tissues of patients with cardiomyopathy, and in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in which we also confirmed such posttranscriptional regulation of transgene expression. Our data clearly indicate that therapeutic utilization of miRNA-based regulation strategy needs to consider inter-individual variability.", "journal": "Molecular therapy.

Surface coating the TiOxNPs with polyacrylic acid (PAA) showed low toxicity to the living body and excellent radiosensitizing effect on cancer cells. Herein, we evaluated the mechanism of radiosensitization by PAA-TiOxNPs in comparison with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) which represent high-atomic-number nanoparticles that show a radiosensitizing effect through the emission of secondary electrons. The anticancer effects of both nanoparticles were compared by induction of apoptosis, colony-forming assay, and the inhibition of tumor growth. PAA-TiOxNPs showed a significantly more radiosensitizing effect than that of AuNPs. A comparison of the types and amounts of ROS generated showed that hydrogen peroxide generation by PAA-TiOxNPs was the major factor that contributed to the nanoparticle radiosensitization.

{"title": "Heart-derived fibroblasts express LYPD-1 and negatively regulate angiogenesis in rat.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is regulated by a balance between promoting and inhibitory mechanisms. Although angiogenesis-promoting mechanisms have been well studied in ischemic heart diseases, angiogenesis-inhibitory mechanisms have not. Recently, we identified LYPD-1 as a novel anti-angiogenic factor derived from human heart-derived fibroblasts, which suppresses endothelial cell network formation in co-culture. However, it remains unclear whether the low angiogenicity of heart-derived fibroblasts with high expression of LYPD-1 is also observed in other mammalian species, and the properties of LYPD-1 under normal and pathological conditions remain elusive. Fibroblasts isolated from neonatal and adult rat heart also express LYPD-1 and inhibit endothelial network formation in co-culture. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that LYPD-1 was predominantly observed in the interstitial tissues of rat heart and LYPD1 expression levels were identical from late developmental period to adult. Conversely, LYPD-1 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated temporally in myocardial infarction model rats, suggesting that angiogenesis-inhibitory mechanisms might not be sufficiently suppressed to promote angiogenesis in ischemic heart diseases. These findings suggest that heart has relatively low angiogenicity compared with other organs via the high expression of LYPD-1 by fibroblasts. Moreover, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of LYPD-1-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis might lead a novel angiogenic therapy for ischemic heart diseases and contribute to development of bioengineered cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Regenerative therapy", "date": "2020-06-10", "authors": ["SatoruSakamoto", "KatsuhisaMatsuura", "ShinakoMasuda", "NobuhisaHagiwara", "TatsuyaShimizu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.reth.2020.03.010"}

AdipoRon is claimed to be an adiponectin receptor agonist that activates AMPK through adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1). However, AdipoRon also exhibits moderate inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, leading to increased risk of lactic acidosis. In order to find novel AdipoRon analogues that activate AMPK without inhibition of complex I, 27 analogues of AdipoRon were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated. As results, benzyloxy arylamide B10 was identified as a potent AMPK activator without inhibition of complex I. B10 dose-dependently improved glucose tolerance in normal mice, and significantly lowered fasting blood glucose level and ameliorated insulin resistance in db/db diabetic mice. More importantly, unlike the pan-AMPK activator MK-8722, B10 did not cause cardiac hypertrophy, probably owing to its selective activation of AMPK in the muscle tissue but not in the heart tissue. Together, B10 represents a novel class of AMPK activators with promising therapeutic potential against metabolic disease.", "journal": "European journal of medicinal chemistry", "date": "2020-06-09", "authors": ["GengSun", "YanpingYou", "HaobinLi", "YalongCheng", "MingQian", "XinyuZhou", "HaoliangYuan", "Qing-LongXu", "LiangDai", "PengfeiWang", "KeguangCheng", "XiaoanWen", "CaipingChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112466"}

While various artificial materials are used in the repair of these issues, the possibility of associated infection and calcification is non-negligible. Cell-seeded biodegradable tissue-engineered patches may be a potential solution. This study evaluated the feasibility of a new left ventricular patch rat model to study neotissue formation in biodegradable cardiac patches.\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (hiPS-CPCs) were cultured onto biodegradable patches composed of polyglycolic acid and a 50:50 poly (l-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) copolymer for one week. After culturing, patches were implanted into left ventricular walls of male athymic rats. Unseeded controls were also used (n = 10/group). Heart conditions were followed by echocardiography and patches were subsequently explanted at 1, 2, 6, and 9 months post-implantation for histological evaluation.\nThroughout the study, no patches ruptured demonstrating the ability to withstand the high pressure left ventricular system. One month after transplantation, the seeded patch did not stain positive for human nuclei. However, many new blood vessels formed within patches with significantly greater vessels in the seeded group at the 6 month time point. Echocardiography showed no significant difference in left ventricular contraction rate between the two groups. Calcification was found inside patches after 6 months, but there was no significant difference between groups.\nWe have developed a surgical method to implant a bioabsorbable scaffold into the left ventricular environment of rats with a high survival rate. Seeded hiPS-CPCs did not differentiate into cardiomyocytes, but the greater number of new blood vessels in seeded patches suggests the presence of cell seeding early in the remodeling process might provide a prolonged effect on neotissue formation.

For the heart, its realization involves the integration of ion channels with newly designed gating properties into cardiomyocytes. This allows cardiac tissue to i) discriminate between normal rhythm and arrhythmia based on frequency-dependent gating and ii) generate an ionic current for termination of the detected arrhythmia.

In particular, PhX1 permeation into the lungs and heart was notably efficient, as reflected in the high relative AUC values of 9669 \u00b1 120.2 min/nmol/mg and 12450 \u00b1 45.2 min/nmol/mg for lung and heart tissue, respectively. However, neither compound maintained a free concentration in the lung which exceeded the compound's respective MIC", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2020-06-09", "authors": ["LloydTanner", "Richard KHaynes", "LubbeWiesner"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2020.00724\n10.1371/journal.pone.0047494\n10.1128/AAC.01731-12\n10.1038/s42004-018-0062-7\n10.1128/AAC.46.7.2095-2103.2002\n10.1038/nrmicro3200\n10.1016/0006-2952(74)90174-9\n10.1016/j.xphs.2018.03.023\n10.1016/S0169-409X(00)00105-8\n10.1016/0378-5173(89)90159-2\n10.1124/dmd.115.067736\n10.1056/NEJMra1413919\n10.1021/acsinfecdis.5b00127\n10.1159/000007181\n10.1128/AAC.05208-11\n10.2174/1389200043335379\n10.1128/AAC.02637-15\n10.1111/imr.12252\n10.1155/2017/7508291\n10.2174/138920006774832578\n10.1021/jm901858n\n10.1128/AAC.48.5.1441-1453.2004\n10.2174/1389200211314030008\n10.1128/AAC.49.6.2429-2437.2005\n10.1016/j.drudis.2011.12.020\n10.1093/jac/dkm476\n10.17226/12910\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2018.05.007\n10.4321/S1575-06202015000100002\n10.1517/17425250903055070\n10.1111/cts.12448\n10.1128/AAC.02266-17\n10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.07.112\n10.1038/nrd3287\n10.1002/jlcr.3256\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002773\n10.5702/massspectrometry.A0025\n10.1002/1097-0231(20001015)14:19<1729::AID-RCM85>3.0.CO;2-5\n10.1002/iub.1866\n10.1128/AAC.01010-19\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00120\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.05.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0020594\n10.3389/fmicb.2011.00105\n10.1002/rcm.1229\n10.1164/rccm.201012-1949OC\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/16/165101\n10.1128/AAC.00924-17"}

Alteration in cardiac contractile function and calcium signaling are predicted as downstream effects of ISO-hypertrophy probably due to the upregulation of key elements such as myosin-7 (MYH7). Confocal microscopy corroborated that indeed ISO-treatment led to increased abundance of MYH7. Potential early markers for cardiac hypertrophy as APBB1, GOLGA4, HOOK1, KATNA1, KIFBP, MAN2B2, and SLC16A1 are also reported.\nThe data consist in a complete molecular mapping of ISO-induced compensated cardiac hypertrophy model at cardiomyocyte level.

This study aimed to investigate the potential cardioprotective effect of losartan against sorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity in rat. Sorafenib significantly reduced the left ventricular pressure, heart rate dp/dt max & dp/dt min (indexes of myocardial contractility and relaxation; respectively), and prolonged both the systolic and diastolic periods. Coadminstration of losartan significantly reversed the effects of sorafenib on heart rate, dp/dt max and dp/dt min. In addition, there was a tendency for losartan to reverse sorafenib reduction in left ventricular pressure and perfusion pressure but it did not reach statistical significance. A GC-MS non-targeted based metabolites profiling of rat plasma revealed elevated metaboites, including urea and fatty acids levels, associated with sorafenib induced cardiotoxicity. However, only glycine and lactic acid were statistically significant. Interestingly, losartan co-administration with sorafenib restored these changes, and resulted in a significantly reduced glycine, urea and some fatty acids levels namely; Cis-vaccenic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid and undecanoic acid. In addition, based on histology results, losartan coadminitration almost obviated sorafenib-induced changes in cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Paired box 6 inhibits cardiac fibroblast differentiation.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibroblast (CF) differentiation plays a crucial role in cardiac fibrosis, which is a specific manifestation distinguishing pathological cardiac hypertrophy from physiological hypertrophy. The DNA-binding activity of paired box 6 (Pax6) has been shown to be oppositely regulated in physiological and pathological hypertrophy; however, it remains unclear whether Pax6 is involved in CF differentiation during cardiac fibrosis. We found that Pax6 is expressed in the heart of and CFs isolated from adult mice. Moreover, angiotensin II (Ang II) induced the downregulation of Pax6 mRNA and protein expression in fibrotic heart tissue and cardiac myofibroblasts. Pax6 knockdown in CFs promoted the expression of the myofibroblast marker \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins collagen I and fibronectin. Furthermore, we validated the ability of Pax6 to bind to the promoter regions of Cxcl10 and Il1r2 and the intronic region of Tgfb1. Pax6 knockdown in CFs decreased CXC chemokine 10 (CXCL10) and interleukin-1 receptor 2 (IL-1R2) expression and increased transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) expression, mimicking the effects of Ang II. In conclusion, Pax6 exerts an inhibitory effect on CF differentiation and ECM synthesis by transcriptionally activating the expression of the anti-fibrotic factors CXCL10 and IL-1R2 and repressing the expression of the pro-fibrotic factor TGF\u03b21. Therefore, maintaining Pax6 expression in CFs is essential for preventing CF differentiation, and provides a new therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2020-06-09", "authors": ["YenanFeng", "MingzheLi", "ShuaixingWang", "WenwenCong", "GuominHu", "YaoSong", "HanXiao", "ErdanDong", "YouyiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.146"}

{"title": "Disruption of the Keap1/Nrf2-Antioxidant Response System After Chronic Doxorubicin Exposure In Vivo.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely prescribed anthracycline antineoplastic drug for treating human solid tumors and leukemias. However, DOX therapy is limited by a cumulative, dose-dependent, and irreversible cardiomyopathy that occurs with repeated administration. Presumably, a pivotal initiating event of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidation of lipids, DNA, and proteins. We recently identified activation of the Keap1/Nrf2-antioxidant response system-a major cellular defense mechanism against such oxidative stress-as an important response to acute DOX exposure in vitro. In the present study, we address the hypothesis that dysregulation of this pathway in cardiac tissue is also manifested in vivo following chronic DOX administration. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats received 6 weekly injections of 2\u00a0mg/kg (s.c.) DOX or saline followed by a 5-week drug-free period prior to analysis of cardiac tissue transcripts and proteins. In contrast to in vitro findings, the Keap1/Nrf2-antioxidant response system was suppressed in hearts of DOX-treated animals and consistent with the observed decrease in protein abundance for Nrf2 and PGAM5, both of which are substrates for Keap1. Although this shift in Keap1/Nrf2 suppresses the antioxidant pathway, the concurrent loss of PGAM5 could function as a signal for disposal of damaged mitochondria from the cell, thus removing the source of ROS. These findings identify the Keap1/Nrf2 and Keap1/PGAM5 pathways as important responses to DOX-induced cardiac injury in vivo; disruption of this system for mitochondrial hormesis may be an important contributing factor to cardiotoxicity after chronic drug administration.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2020-06-06", "authors": ["Kendra K SNordgren", "Kendall BWallace"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-020-09581-7"}

{"title": "Dehydration stress alters the mitogen-activated-protein kinase signaling and chaperone stress response in Xenopus laevis.", "abstract": "In arid conditions, the African Clawed frog Xenopus laevis enters a state of estivation dormancy as an adaptive survival strategy. Under estivation, X. laevis experience severe dehydration stress as 25-35% of total body water is lost. Dehydration in X. laevis can lead to periods of hypoxia due to elevated blood viscosity that impedes tissue perfusion. To understand how X. laevis survives under such stress, we studied the regulation pattern of key mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and their downstream transcription factors, along with several heat shock proteins in the oxygen sensitive brain and heart tissue of X. laevis under dehydration stress. Our study revealed that the activation phosphorylation residues of MAPK including JNK and MSK and their downstream transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2 are significantly decreased in the heart under dehydration. Given that JNK, c-Jun, and ATF2 are known positive regulators of apoptosis, this regulatory pattern suggest that a state of pro-survival signals may be established in the dehydrated heart. In support of this, protein levels of HSP60, a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial chaperone, was also downregulated in the heart in response to dehydration stress. In the brain tissue, most proteins remain unchanged with the exception of the apoptosis regulating p53 transcription factor, which showed a significant decrease in its activating phosphorylation residue under dehydration. Overall, our study revealed that in the Xenopus brain and heart, a specific suppression pattern of MAPK, transcription factors, and HSP takes place to potentially establish a state of pro-survival under dehydration stress.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "Update on acute myocarditis.", "abstract": "Acute myocarditis (AM), a recent-onset inflammation of the heart, has heterogeneous clinical presentations, varying from minor symptoms to high-risk cardiac conditions with severe heart failure, refractory arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock. AM is moving from being a definitive diagnosis based on histological evidence of inflammatory infiltrates on cardiac tissue to a working diagnosis supported by high sensitivity troponin increase in association with specific cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) findings. Though experts still diverge between those advocating for histological definition versus those supporting a mainly clinical definition of myocarditis, in the real-world practice the diagnosis of AM has undoubtedly shifted from being mainly biopsy-based to solely CMRI-based in most of clinical scenarios. It is thus important to clearly define selected settings where EMB is a must, as information derived from histology is essential for an optimal management. As in other medical conditions, a risk-based approach should be promoted in order to identify the most severe AM cases requiring appropriate bundles of care, including early recognition, transfer to tertiary centers, aggressive circulatory supports with inotropes and mechanical devices, histologic confirmation and eventual immunosuppressive therapy. Despite improvements in recognition and treatment of AM, including a broader use of promising mechanical circulatory supports, severe forms of AM are still burdened by dismal outcomes. This review is focused on recent clinical studies and registries that shed new insights on AM. Attention will be paid to contemporary outcomes and predictors of prognosis, the emerging entity of immune checkpoint inhibitors-associated myocarditis, updated CMRI diagnostic criteria, new data on the use of temporary mechanical circulatory supports in fulminant myocarditis. The role of viruses as etiologic agents will be reviewed and a brief update on pediatric AM is also provided.

We utilized the spontaneously hypertensive Wistar-Kyoto rat model, previously shown to demonstrate drug-induced cardiomyopathy, to evaluate the acute and long-term effects of sub-lethal total body gamma irradiation at two, four, and fifty-two weeks. We further examined irreversible oxidative protein carbonylation in the heart immediately following irradiation in the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat. Both males and females sustained weight loss and anemic conditions compared to untreated controls over a one-year period as reflected by reduced body weight and low red blood cell count. Increased inflammation was detected by elevated IL-6 serum levels selectively in males at four weeks. Serum cardiac troponin T and I analyses revealed signs of cardiomyopathy at earlier timepoints, but high variability was observed, especially at one year. Echocardiography at two weeks following 5.0Gy treatment revealed a significant decrease in cardiac output in females and a significant decrease in both diastolic and systolic volumes in males. Following 10.0Gy irradiation in the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat, the heart tissue showed an increase in total protein oxidative carbonylation accompanied by DNA damage indicated by an increase in \u03b3-H2AX. Using proteomic analyses, we identified several novel proteins which showed a marked difference in carbonylation including those of mitochondrial origin and most notably, cardiac troponin T, one of the key proteins involved in cardiomyocyte contractility.

{"title": "Differential Activation of Immune Cells for Genetically Different Decellularized Cardiac Tissues.", "abstract": "The immunogenicity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) from genetically similar (syngeneic) and dissimilar (allogeneic and xenogeneic) species has puzzled the scientific community for many years. After implantation, the literature describes an absorption of ECM material since it is biodegradable. However, no clear insight really exists to substantiate how the underlying immune and biological responses result in absorption of ECM materials. In this context, it is important to characterize infiltrating cells and identify dominant cell populations in the infiltrate. We have studied the immune response in mice after implantation of decellularized (DC) cardiac scaffolds derived from pig and mouse. The polymorphism of the infiltrate into the implanted material signifies the importance of the adaptive immune response that is distinct for xenoimplants and alloimplants. Matrix resorption takes place mainly through phagocytic cells such as mast cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Histochemical observations show that innate CD8", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Morphometric characterization of collagen and fat in normal ventricular myocardium.", "abstract": "We used automated image analysis software to determine the proportion of collagen, fat, and myocytes across six histological regions of normal ventricular myocardium.\nTwenty-nine non-cardiac death cases referred to our national cardiac pathology center were included in this study. Whole hearts were macroscopically and microscopically normal following expert histopathological evaluation. Tissue sections from the right ventricular outflow tract, right ventricle (RV), anterior interventricular septum (IVS), posterior IVS, anterior left ventricle (LV), and posterior LV were stained with Picrosirius red for collagen and scanned using a high-resolution slide scanner. Quantification of collagen, fat, and myocyte proportions was performed using Visiopharm software after automated exclusion of perivascular collagen.\nThe majority of decedents were male (25/29; 86%) with a mean age at death of 32.1 \u00b1 9.9 (range 18-54) and mean BMI 28.7 \u00b1 7.3. We report predicted values (collagen %, fat %, myocytes %) for cardiac tissue composition within the RV, IVS, and LV (including epicardial and endocardial layers). The proportion of collagen and fat were higher in the RV compared with the LV (ratios 1.61 [1.45-1.78]; 2.63 [1.99-3.48], respectively) and RV compared with the IVS (ratios 1.77 [1.60-1.97]; 8.41[6.35-11.13], respectively). The ratio of epicardial versus endocardial fat was increased in both ventricles (RV: ratio 4.49 [3.67-5.49]; LV: ratio 3.46 [2.49-4.81]). In multivariable analysis, there was no significant association between collagen or fat proportion and sex (p=0.12; p=0.08, respectively), age at death (p=0.36; p=0.23, respectively), or BMI (p=0.45; p=0.43, respectively).\nOur findings provide location and sex-specific proportions of myocardial histological tissue composition that may aid quantitative evaluation of pathology in future studies.", "journal": "Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology", "date": "2020-06-02", "authors": ["ChrisMiles", "JosephWestaby", "Irina ChisSter", "AngelikiAsimaki", "PeterBoardman", "AdwaitJoshi", "MichaelPapadakis", "SanjaySharma", "Elijah RBehr", "Mary NSheppard"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107224\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz172\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.08.862\n10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303052\n10.1161/01.RES.5.4.357\n10.1016/j.carpath.2008.10.015\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.037230\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00987.2016"}
{"title": "A novel method to align cells in a cardiac tissue-like construct fabricated by cell sheet-based tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Fabrication of cardiac tissue from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) has received great interest, but a major challenge facing researchers is the alignment of cardiomyocytes in the same direction to optimize force generation. We have developed a novel method of fabricating a cardiac tissue-like construct with aligned cells based on the unidirectional stretching of an hiPS-CM sheet. A square cell sheet was harvested from a temperature-responsive culture dish and placed on a silicone surface, and an extending force was imposed on the silicone to stretch the cell sheet along one direction. To enable evaluation of cardiomyocyte morphology in vitro, a cell sheet was constructed by coculture of hiPS-CMs and human adipose-derived stem cells. In separate experiments, a stretched double-layered cell sheet constructed from hiPS-CMs alone was transplanted onto the muscle of an athymic rat, and its features were compared with those of a nonstretched (control) cell sheet. Immediately after stretching, the stretched cell sheet was significantly longer than the control cell sheet. Immunohistological analysis revealed that the cardiomyocytes showed unidirectional alignment in the stretched cell sheet but random directionality in the control cell sheet. Two weeks after transplantation, immunohistology demonstrated that the stretched cell sheet had retained the unidirectionality of its myocardial fibers and had an orientation intensity that was higher than that of the control cell sheet after transplantation or the stretched cell sheet before transplantation. Our technique provides a simple method of aligning an hiPS-CM-derived cardiac tissue-like construct without the use of a scaffold.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2020-06-02", "authors": ["JunHomma", "ShogoShimizu", "HidekazuSekine", "KatsuhisaMatsuura", "TatsuyaShimizu"], "doi": "10.1002/term.3074"}

The aim of this work was to determinate the effect during hypertrophic process through molecular mechanisms that include prolactin receptor (Prlr) and receptor of dopamine 2 (D2\u00a0r) expression.\nWe used a\u00a0model of cardiac hypertrophy induced by an aortocaval fistula (ACF) surgery in rats. Protein concentrations of D2\u00a0r and Prlr were determined by western blotting. The treatment consisted in water (control), captopril\u00a0(50\u00a0mg/kg/day), bromocriptine\u00a0(3\u00a0mg/kg/day), and ACF group (n\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0per group).\nOur results showed that bromocriptine treatment decreases the hypertrophy index. Treatment with bromocriptine increases the protein expression of Prlr and D2\u00a0r in the cardiac tissue of rats with cardiac hypertrophy.\nWe concluded that bromocriptine has a\u00a0protective effect\u00a0on cardiac hypertrophy, and due to this effect, it may modulate the expression of Prlr and D2\u00a0r, which are involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)", "date": "2020-06-02", "authors": ["Karla AideeAguayo-Cer\u00f3n", "Claudia CameliaCalzada-Mendoza", "EnriqueM\u00e9ndez-Bolaina", "RodrigoRomero-Nava", "Mar\u00eda EstherOcharan-Hern\u00e1ndez"], "doi": "10.1080/10641963.2020.1772814"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective activity of ethanolic extract of Echinophora cinerea against aluminum phosphide poisoning in rats.", "abstract": "Rice tablet, also known as aluminum phosphide (ALP), is a nonorganic material used as an insecticide and rodenticide in the storage and transportation of grains. Phosphine gas, released from the chemical material, in contact with humidity and weak acid, can induce poisoning and death. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of ethanol extract of Echinophora cinerea leaves on ALP poisoning in heart in rats. In this study, factors such as blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiography, and biochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress of cardiac tissue were evaluated. The use of Echinophora extract at a dose of 200\u00a0mg per/kg primarily improved bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac conduction. Echinophora extract at a dose of 400\u00a0mg could protect body against oxidative stress. It seems that Echinophora extract has significant clinical positive effects that can be employed in treatment protocols of acute poisoning associated with ALP. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Administration of the Echinophora cinerea extract can improve bradycardia, hypotension, and conduction disturbances of the heart caused by poisoning with rice tablet. E.\u00a0cinerea extract also can increase the levels of antioxidant enzymes and protect the body against oxidative damage caused by poisoning with rice tablet.

{"title": "Young at Heart: Combining Strategies to Rejuvenate Endogenous Mechanisms of Cardiac Repair.", "abstract": "True cardiac regeneration of the injured heart has been broadly described in lower vertebrates by active replacement of lost cardiomyocytes to functionally and structurally restore the myocardial tissue. On the contrary, following severe injury (i.e., myocardial infarction) the adult mammalian heart is endowed with an impaired reparative response by means of meager wound healing program and detrimental remodeling, which can lead over time to cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Lately, a growing body of basic, translational and clinical studies have supported the therapeutic use of stem cells to provide myocardial regeneration, with the working hypothesis that stem cells delivered to the cardiac tissue could result into new cardiovascular cells to replenish the lost ones. Nevertheless, multiple independent evidences have demonstrated that injected stem cells are more likely to modulate the cardiac tissue via beneficial paracrine effects, which can enhance cardiac repair and reinstate the embryonic program and cell cycle activity of endogenous cardiac stromal cells and resident cardiomyocytes. Therefore, increasing interest has been addressed to the therapeutic profiling of the stem cell-derived ", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2020-06-02", "authors": ["EdoardoMaghin", "PatriziaGarbati", "RodolfoQuarto", "MartinaPiccoli", "SvevaBollini"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2020.00447\n10.1111/jcmm.12624\n10.1152/ajpheart.00100.2018\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.001\n10.1002/jmri.25678\n10.1172/JCI72181\n10.1155/2019/6708435\n10.3390/cells9030724\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.04.011\n10.1002/sctm.16-0297\n10.2217/rme.09.74\n10.1093/cvr/cvy055\n10.1093/cvr/cvu167\n10.21037/sci.2017.11.06\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw304\n10.1038/nature22978\n10.1002/adhm.201800672\n10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000558\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.04.055\n10.1089/scd.2010.0424\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00385\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.07.006\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01497\n10.1089/scd.2014.0019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312586\n10.1038/nrd.2017.106\n10.15252/emmm.201606924\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2001.00830.x\n10.1111/jcmm.14630\n10.3727/096368916X692933\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0135\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.01.038\n10.1039/c7bm00208d\n10.2174/1574888x11308010006\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000507\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0253\n10.1016/j.jprot.2013.05.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024590\n10.1038/s41467-020-14977-8\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0267\n10.1172/jci.insight.96800\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.06.017\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029343\n10.1161/RES.0000000000000241\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.08.067\n10.1093/cvr/cvn292\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehi818\n10.1038/s41586-019-1191-6\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.02.014\n10.1096/fj.05-5211com\n10.1002/stem.2618\n10.1161/01.cir.89.5.2315\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.01.001\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa028\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.09.023\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.222703\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307017\n10.1002/adtp.201800032\n10.1002/stem.1696\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.305373\n10.1089/hum.2010.165\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.115.002679\n10.1126/science.1229765\n10.1111/bph.14155\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr435\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00771\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.04.006\n10.1073/pnas.1208114109\n10.3727/096368912X661427\n10.1039/C3BM60283D\n10.1002/prca.201500048\n10.1002/jbm.a.36464\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311921\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.03.005\n10.1038/nature08804\n10.1002/adhm.201900593\n10.1038/leu.2014.41\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn456\n10.1089/ars.2017.7159\n10.1016/j.tig.2007.10.007\n10.1038/srep29994\n10.1038/s41565-020-0636-2\n10.1042/CS20180560\n10.1152/ajpheart.00559.2015\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.08.052\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034250\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz305\n10.1186/s13287-018-0888-z\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.11.008\n10.1002/sctm.16-0363\n10.1038/nprot.2014.021\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60195-0\n10.1093/bmb/ldr018\n10.33594/000000124\n10.1089/biores.2014.0046\n10.3390/cells7120255\n10.1093/cvr/cvz108\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.005\n10.1073/pnas.0610024104\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000152\n10.1038/nature02446\n10.1007/s12265-010-9171-0\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.05.016\n10.1038/nm1684\n10.1007/s11886-018-1031-6\n10.1038/s41467-019-11091-2\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.005\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1073/pnas.1208863110\n10.3390/ijms19124117\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1002/stem.2910\n10.1093/cvr/cvv168\n10.1016/j.diff.2014.12.005\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2012.03.001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.08.031\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.777102\n10.1038/nature06800\n10.1007/s12265-011-9293-z\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2009.0768\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1155/2017/4150705\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309782\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.084699\n10.1007/s12265-010-9202-x\n10.1002/mabi.201000423\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.888\n10.1093/cvr/cvx211\n10.1038/nature10188\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2006.12.013\n10.1016/j.molmed.2011.03.005\n10.2217/fca-2016-0044\n10.1007/978-3-319-97421-7_6\n10.1007/5584_2018_309\n10.1038/ncomms9701\n10.1007/s00395-020-0785-3\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036210\n10.1007/978-3-319-97421-7_5\n10.1097/MOT.0000000000000051\n10.1007/s40778-017-0075-7\n10.1111/ajt.12939\n10.1097/00152193-199004000-00011\n10.1080/20013078.2018.1535750\n10.1016/j.scr.2011.01.001\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.06.063\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.05.068\n10.3390/ijms19082392\n10.1002/term.2843\n10.1002/sctm.17-0130\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.09.003\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2009.0392\n10.1159/000331400\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1047-2_17\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.06.002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024307\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.062\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.04.058\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.00013\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2019.107421\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0059020\n10.7150/thno.41580\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311213\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035200\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315216\n10.1172/JCI45529\n10.1038/nature07060\n10.1080/21691401.2017.1388249\n10.1016/s1054-8807(03)00089-9"}

{"title": "Recombinant spider silk protein eADF4(C16)-RGD coatings are suitable for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering is a promising approach to treat cardiovascular diseases, which are a major socio-economic burden worldwide. An optimal material for cardiac tissue engineering, allowing cardiomyocyte attachment and exhibiting proper immunocompatibility, biocompatibility and mechanical characteristics, has not yet emerged. An additional challenge is to develop a fabrication method that enables the generation of proper hierarchical structures and constructs with a high density of cardiomyocytes for optimal contractility. Thus, there is a focus on identifying suitable materials for cardiac tissue engineering. Here, we investigated the interaction of neonatal rat heart cells with engineered spider silk protein (eADF4(C16)) tagged with the tripeptide arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid cell adhesion motif RGD, which can be used as coating, but can also be 3D printed. Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells attached well to eADF4(C16)-RGD coatings, which did not induce hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes, but allowed response to hypertrophic as well as proliferative stimuli. Furthermore, Kymograph and MUSCLEMOTION analyses showed proper cardiomyocyte beating characteristics on spider silk coatings, and cardiomyocytes formed compact cell aggregates, exhibiting markedly higher speed of contraction than cardiomyocyte mono-layers on fibronectin.

{"title": "Identifying modifier genes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) severity greatly varies among patients even with the same HCM gene mutations. This variation is largely regulated by modifier gene(s), which, however, remain largely unknown. The current study is aimed to identify modifier genes using BXD strains, a large murine genetic reference population (GRP) derived from crosses between C57BL/6\u00a0J (B6) and D2 DBA/2\u00a0J (D2) mice. D2 mice natualy carrythe genetic basis and phenotypes of HCM.\nMyocardial hypertrophy, the major phenotype of HCM, was determined by cardiomyocyte size on cardiac sections in 30 BXD strains, and their parental B6 and D2 strains and morphometric analysis was performed. Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping for cardiomyocyte sizes was conducted with WebQTL in GeneNetwork. Correlation of cardiomyocyte size and cardiac gene expression in BXDs accessed from GeneNetwork were evaluated. QTL candidate genes associated with cardiomyocyte sizes were prioritized based on the score system.\nCardiomyocyte size varied significantly among BXD strains. Interval mapping on cardiomyocyte size data showed a significant QTL on chromosome (Chr) 2 at 66-\u00a073.5\u00a0Mb and a suggestive QTL on Chr 5 at 20.9-39.7\u00a0Mb. Further score system revealed a high QTL score for Xirp2 in Chr 2. Xirp2 encodes xin actin-binding repeat containing 2, which is highly expressed in cardiac tissue and associate with cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In Chr5 QTL, Nos3, encoding nitric oxide synthase 3, received the highest score, which is significantly correlated with cardiomyocyte size.\nThese results indicate that Xirp2 and Nos3 serve as novel candidate modifier genes for myocardial hypertrophy in HCM.

The purpose of this study is to confirm the role of miR-195 in arrhythmia caused by cardiac hypertrophy. The protein levels of Cav\u03b21, Kir2.1 and Kv4.3 in myocardium of HF mice were decreased. After miR-195 was overexpressed in neonatal mice cardiomyocytes, the expression of ANP, BNP and \u03b2-MHC was up-regulated, and miR-195 inhibitor reversed this phenomenon. Overexpression of miR-195 reduced the estimated cardiac function of EF% and FS% in wild-type (WT) mice. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the ultrastructure of cardiac tissues was damaged after miR-195 overexpression by lentivirus in mice. miR-195 overexpression increased the likelihood of arrhythmia induction and duration of arrhythmia in WT mice. Lenti-miR-195 inhibitor carried by lentivirus can reverse the decreased EF% and FS%, the increased incidence of arrhythmia and prolonged duration of arrhythmia induced by TAC in mice. After miR-195 treatment, the protein expressions of Cav\u03b21, Kir2.1 and Kv4.3 were decreased in mice. The results were consistent at animal and cellular levels, respectively. Luciferase assay results showed that miR-195 may directly target CACNB1, KCNJ2 and KCND3 to regulate the expression of Cav\u03b21, Kir2.1 and Kv4.3 proteins.

{"title": "Biomarkers for infarct diagnosis and rapid rule-out/rule-in of acute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "The 4th edition of the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) recommends measurement of cardiac troponin (cTn)\u00a0T or\u00a0I for the diagnosis of MI due to their absolute cardiac tissue specificity. In this MI definition, values exceeding the 99th percentile of a\u00a0healthy reference population distinguish between detectable troponin due to physiological cell turnover as opposed to pathological myocardial injury. In clinical routine, high-sensitivity (hs) troponin assays that allow earlier diagnosis of MI and detection of myocardial injury that would have escaped detection due to the lower sensitivity of previous assay generations are increasingly used. While the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines already recommend a\u00a0re-testing of cTn after 3\u202fh, if an\u00a0hs-cTn assay is available, faster protocols that reassess hs-cTn after 60-120\u202fmin are increasingly performed, since these protocols allow faster patient disposition, increase discharge rates from the emergency department (ED), and are at least as safe as the standard protocol for the guidance of discharge after rule-out. However, decision cut-offs are lower than the 99th percentile and concentration change criteria depend on the individual hs-cTn assay and protocol used. The following article provides an overview of the recommendations of the 4th universal MI definition as well as the current 2015 ESC guidelines on cTn and other potential biomarker candidates for patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndromes.

{"title": "3D Motion Estimation of Left Ventricular Dynamics Using MRI and Track-to-Track Fusion.", "abstract": "This study investigates the estimation of three dimensional (3D) left ventricular (LV) motion using the fusion of different two dimensional (2D) cine magnetic resonance (CMR) sequences acquired during routine imaging sessions. Although standard clinical cine CMR data is inherently 2D, the actual underlying LV dynamics lies in 3D space and cannot be captured entirely using single 2D CMR image sequences. By utilizing the image information from various short-axis and long-axis image sequences, the proposed method intends to estimate the dynamic state vectors consisting of the position and velocity information of the myocardial borders in 3D space.\nThe proposed method comprises two main components: tracking myocardial points in 2D CMR sequences and fusion of multiple trajectories correspond to the tracked points. The tracking which yields the set of corresponding temporal points representing the myocardial points is performed using a diffeomorphic nonrigid image registration approach. The trajectories obtained from each cine CMR sequence is then fused with the corresponding trajectories from other CMR views using an unscented Kalman smoother (UKS) and a track-to-track fusion algorithm.\nWe evaluated the proposed method by comparing the results against CMR imaging with myocardial tagging. We report a quantitative performance analysis by projecting the state vector estimates we obtained onto 2D tagged CMR images acquired from the same subjects and comparing them against harmonic phase estimates. The proposed algorithm yielded a competitive performance with a mean root mean square error of 1.3\u00b10.5 pixels (1.8\u00b10.6 mm) evaluated over 118 image sequences acquired from 30 subjects.\nThis study demonstrates that fusing the information from short and long-axis views of CMR improves the accuracy of cardiac tissue motion estimation.

{"title": "Unravelling the Biology of Adult Cardiac Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes to Foster Endogenous Cardiac Regeneration and Repair.", "abstract": "Cardiac remuscularization has been the stated goal of the field of regenerative cardiology since its inception. Along with the refreshment of lost and dysfunctional cardiac muscle cells, the field of cell therapy has expanded in scope encompassing also the potential of the injected cells as cardioprotective and cardio-reparative agents for cardiovascular diseases. The latter has been the result of the findings that cell therapies so far tested in clinical trials exert their beneficial effects through paracrine mechanisms acting on the endogenous myocardial reparative/regenerative potential. The endogenous regenerative potential of the adult heart is still highly debated. While it has been widely accepted that adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) are renewed throughout life either in response to wear and tear and after injury, the rate and origin of this phenomenon are yet to be clarified. The adult heart harbors resident cardiac/stem progenitor cells (CSCs/CPCs), whose discovery and characterization were initially sufficient to explain CM renewal in response to physiological and pathological stresses, when also considering that adult CMs are terminally differentiated cells. The role of CSCs in CM formation in the adult heart has been however questioned by some recent genetic fate map studies, which have been proved to have serious limitations. Nevertheless, uncontested evidence shows that clonal CSCs are effective transplantable regenerative agents either for their direct myogenic differentiation and for their paracrine effects in the allogeneic setting. In particular, the paracrine potential of CSCs has been the focus of the recent investigation, whereby CSC-derived exosomes appear to harbor relevant regenerative and reparative signals underlying the beneficial effects of CSC transplantation. This review focuses on recent advances in our knowledge about the biological role of exosomes in heart tissue homeostasis and repair with the idea to use them as tools for new therapeutic biotechnologies for \"cell-less\" effective cardiac regeneration approaches.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-05-30", "authors": ["TeresaMancuso", "AntonellaBarone", "AlessandroSalatino", "ClaudiaMolinaro", "FabiolaMarino", "MariangelaScalise", "MicheleTorella", "AntonellaDe Angelis", "KonradUrbanek", "DanieleTorella", "EleonoraCianflone"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21103725\n10.1097/JIM.0000000000000232\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz859\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.178525\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1995.tb17407.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.1997.272.1.H220\n10.1242/dev.091538\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1007/s00018-007-6519-y\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.039\n10.1161/01.RES.0000147315.71699.51\n10.1161/01.RES.0000147619.96113.51\n10.1016/j.tcm.2005.06.006\n10.1073/pnas.0500169102\n10.1038/cddis.2016.205\n10.1038/cdd.2017.130\n10.1080/15384101.2018.1464852\n10.1038/s41419-019-1655-5\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.05.013\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs338\n10.1038/nature13309\n10.1038/nm.3764\n10.1038/cr.2015.143\n10.1002/emmm.201201737\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.08.724\n10.1038/nature25771\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311565\n10.1186/s13287-019-1237-6\n10.1038/s41467-019-11091-2\n10.1016/j.acvd.2020.01.002\n10.2174/1574888X15666200309144906\n10.1016/j.jcin.2016.05.003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309710\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304386\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.09.036\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu192\n10.1038/s41551-018-0229-7\n10.1001/jama.2012.25321\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.042598\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.131110\n10.1186/s10020-019-0128-8\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007917\n10.1039/C7BM00479F\n10.3390/ijms17010063\n10.1007/s10557-016-6698-6\n10.1007/s12265-018-9842-9\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw304\n10.4252/wjsc.v10.i8.106\n10.1016/j.pcad.2007.03.005\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1080/14712598.2018.1430762\n10.1155/2019/5813147\n10.3389/fendo.2019.00371\n10.1038/ncomms9701\n10.1016/j.phrs.2017.06.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307934\n10.1038/s41587-019-0042-1\n10.1001/jamacardio.2018.4435\n10.1038/ncomms7930\n10.1073/pnas.1800526115\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.10.002\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.09.004\n10.1038/ncpcardio0772\n10.1038/nature10188\n10.1073/pnas.0600635103\n10.1126/science.1110542\n10.1007/s00395-011-0180-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.001075\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223792\n10.1007/s12265-012-9384-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.253427\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.308165\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr172\n10.1152/ajpcell.00129.2019\n10.1038/ki.2010.278\n10.1038/s41556-018-0250-9\n10.1111/j.1365-2141.1967.tb08741.x\n10.1016/0009-8981(77)90054-7\n10.1016/j.bcp.2011.12.037\n10.1074/jbc.M301642200\n10.1242/jcs.216499\n10.1016/j.tcb.2008.03.002\n10.4161/cib.18208\n10.1093/jb/mvj128\n10.1007/s00018-017-2595-9\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-101512-122326\n10.1089/ars.2017.7265\n10.1111/j.1600-0854.2004.00257.x\n10.1038/ncb2000\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4579\n10.1161/01.RES.88.3.319\n10.1074/jbc.M804966200\n10.1038/s41467-019-08895-7\n10.3390/ijms21061908\n10.1002/eji.200535435\n10.1038/nprot.2012.131\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.07.042\n10.1038/s41378-019-0051-8\n10.7150/thno.20524\n10.1161/JAHA.118.008737\n10.2147/IJN.S225453\n10.1002/adma.201904040\n10.1097/00045415-199911000-00010\n10.1056/NEJMoa012081\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.06.009\n10.1007/s00011-017-1060-4\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.01.015\n10.1038/cddis.2016.181\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309935\n10.1074/jbc.M112.445304\n10.3390/cells9030724\n10.1002/stem.2778\n10.21037/sci.2017.11.06\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.253286\n10.3390/ijms20030468\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa156\n10.1038/ncb1596\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304360\n10.7150/ijms.14112\n10.1093/cvr/cvz108\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw240\n10.3389/fphar.2019.01368\n10.1021/acsami.8b08449\n10.1093/cvr/cvy067\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw324"}
{"title": "Novel mineralocorticoid receptor mechanisms regulate cardiac tissue inflammation in male mice.", "abstract": "MR activation in macrophages is critical for the development of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. We previously showed that MR activation modifies macrophage pro-inflammatory signalling, changing the cardiac tissue response to injury via both direct gene transcription and JNK/AP-1 second messenger pathways. In contrast, MR-mediated renal electrolyte homeostasis is critically determined by DNA-binding-dependent processes. Hence, ascertaining the relative contribution of MR actions via DNA binding or alternative pathways on macrophage behaviour and cardiac inflammation may provide therapeutic opportunities which separate the cardioprotective effects of MR antagonists from their undesirable renal potassium-conserving effects. We developed new macrophage cell lines either lacking MR or harbouring a mutant MR incapable of DNA binding. Western blot analysis demonstrated that MR DNA binding is required for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), induction of the MAPK/pJNK pathway in macrophages. Quantitative RTPCR for pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic targets revealed subsets of LPS- and PMA-induced genes that were either enhanced or repressed by the MR via actions that do not always require direct MR-DNA binding. Analysis of the MR target gene and profibrotic factor MMP12 identified promoter elements that are regulated by combined MR/MAPK/JNK signalling. Evaluation of cardiac tissue responses to an 8-day DOC/salt challenge in mice selectively lacking MR DNA-binding in macrophages demonstrated levels of inflammatory markers equivalent to WT, indicating non-DNA binding-dependent MR signalling in macrophages is sufficient for DOC/salt-induced tissue inflammation.

Expressions of phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate1(p-IRS1), p-Akt and GLUT4 in cardiac tissue were determined.\nHesperidin and metformin attenuated MS in HFD rats (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The accumulation of visceral fat pads and fatty liver associated with increases in liver lipid contents and liver enzymes were found in MS rats that were alleviated in hesperidin or metformin-treated groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Hesperidin and metformin improved cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy observed in MS rats (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Restoration of the insulin signaling pathway, IRS/Akt/GLUT4 protein expression, was demonstrated in hesperidin and metformin-treated groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Hesperidin (30\u00a0mg/kg) was more effective than the lower dose.\nHesperidin was effective in reducing signs of MS and alterations of LV hypertrophy and function.

{"title": "Periostin aggravates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Pyroptosis is a form of caspase-1-induced programmed cell death. This study aimed to investigate the effect of periostin (postn) on pyroptosis in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). To this end, the differentially expressed genes were obtained from the GSE4105 dataset using the \"GEO2R\" online tool. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database, and Module and Go analysis were conducted using the Cytoscape 3.6 plugs-in MCODE and BINGO, respectively. The analysis showed that postn was a critical gene in the most significant module. Experimental results, including triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, pathological analysis, TUNEL staining, western blotting, and RT-qPCR assays, showed that MIRI induced caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Postn was significantly upregulated in the heart tissues of MIRI rats and in H9C2 cells following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment. In addition, knockdown of postn suppressed the caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis and H/R-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as evidenced by flow cytometry, CCK8, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and ELISA assays. In contrast, overexpression of postn promoted NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis of H/R-treated H9C2 cells. According to the results of rescue experiments, a caspase-1 inhibitor reduced the increase in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis induced by overexpression of postn, and the pyroptosis-promoting function of postn overexpression in H/R treated H9C2 cells was reversed by inhibition of NLRP3.

{"title": "Identification of transcription factors MYC and C/EBP\u03b2 mediated regulatory networks in heart failure based on gene expression omnibus datasets.", "abstract": "Heart failure is one of leading cause of death worldwide. However, the transcriptional profiling of heart failure is unclear. Moreover, the signaling pathways and transcription factors involving the heart failure development also are largely unknown. Using published Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, in the present study, we aim to comprehensively analyze the differentially expressed genes in failing heart tissues, and identified the critical signaling pathways and transcription factors involving heart failure development.\nThe transcriptional profiling of heart failure was identified from previously published gene expression datasets deposited in GSE5406, GSE16499 and GSE68316. The enriched signaling pathways and transcription factors were analyzed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) assay. The transcriptional networks were created by Cytoscape.\nCompared with the normal heart tissues, 90 genes were particularly differentially expressed in failing heart tissues, and those genes were associated with multiple metabolism signaling pathways and insulin signaling pathway. Metabolism and insulin signaling pathway were both inactivated in failing heart tissues. Transcription factors MYC and C/EBP\u03b2 were both negatively associated with the expression profiling of failing heart tissues in GSEA assay. Moreover, compared with normal heart tissues, MYC and C/EBP\u03b2 were down regulated in failing heart tissues. Furthermore, MYC and C/EBP\u03b2 mediated downstream target genes were also decreased in failing heart tissues. MYC and C/EBP\u03b2 were positively correlated with each other. At last, we constructed MYC and C/EBP\u03b2 mediated regulatory networks in failing heart tissues, and identified the MYC and C/EBP\u03b2 target genes which had been reported involving the heart failure developmental progress.\nOur results suggested that metabolism pathways and insulin signaling pathway, transcription factors MYC and C/EBP\u03b2 played critical roles in heart failure developmental progress.", "journal": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "date": "2020-05-29", "authors": ["HaiweiWang", "XinruiWang", "LiangpuXu", "HuaCao"], "doi": "10.1186/s12872-020-01527-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2\n10.1038/s41569-018-0036-6\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.04.099\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.632430\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.109.904698\n10.1186/s12872-015-0056-7\n10.3390/genes9010056\n10.1038/s41568-019-0196-7\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.036\n10.1093/cvr/cvq068\n10.1038/s41467-018-06639-7\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.027\n10.1038/nrc2715\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.07.019\n10.1016/j.molcel.2013.04.029\n10.1101/cshperspect.a014241\n10.1038/ncomms9873\n10.1038/nature14351\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.017\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.013\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aah5084\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1074/jbc.M505484200\n10.1038/s41569-018-0044-6\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.792101\n10.4161/cc.7.23.7240\n10.1152/japplphysiol.01147.2006\n10.1177/2040622310393059\n10.1038/s41467-018-07606-y\n10.18632/oncotarget.22214\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.07.014\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024599\n10.1074/jbc.M113.542795"}

{"title": "Adaptations in GLUT4 Expression in Response to Exercise Detraining Linked to Downregulation of Insulin-Dependent Pathways in Cardiac but not in Skeletal Muscle Tissue.", "abstract": "Insulin resistance is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, and exercise training can improve insulin-mediated glucose uptake. However, few studies have demonstrated the reversibility of exercise-induced benefits. Thus, the authors examine the time-response effects of exercise training and detraining on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) content, insulin-dependent and insulin-independent pathways in cardiac and gastrocnemius muscle tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Thirty-two male spontaneously hypertensive rats, 4 months old, were assigned to (n = 8/group): T (exercise training: 10-week treadmill exercise, 50-70% maximum effort capacity, 1\u00a0hr/day, 5\u00a0days/week); D2 (exercise training + 2-day detraining), D4 (exercise training + 4-day detraining); and S (no exercise). The authors evaluated insulin resistance, maximum effort capacity, GLUT4 content, p-IRS-1Tyr1179, p-AS160Ser588, p-AMPK\u03b11Thr172, and p-CaMKIIThr286 in cardiac and gastrocnemius muscle tissues (Western blot). In response to exercise training, there were improvements in insulin resistance (15.4%; p = .010), increased GLUT4 content (microsomal, 29.4%; p = .012; plasma membrane, 27.1%; p < .001), p-IRS-1 (42.2%; p < .001), p-AS160 (60.0%; p < .001) in cardiac tissue, and increased GLUT4 content (microsomal, 29.4%; p = .009; plasma membrane, 55.5%; p < .001), p-IRS-1 (28.1%; p = .018), p-AS160 (76.0%; p < .001), p-AMPK-\u03b11 (37.5%; p = .026), and p-CaMKII (30.0%; p = .040) in the gastrocnemius tissue. In D4 group, the exercise-induced increase in GLUT4 was reversed (plasma membrane, -21.3%; p = .027), p-IRS1 (-37.1%; p = .008), and p-AS160 (-82.6%; p < .001) in the cardiac tissue; p-AS160 expression (-35.7%; p = .034) was reduced in the gastrocnemius. In conclusion, the cardiac tissue is more susceptible to exercise adaptations in the GLUT4 content and signaling pathways than the gastrocnemius muscle. This finding may be explained by particular characteristics of insulin-dependent and insulin-independent pathways in the muscle tissues studied.", "journal": "International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism", "date": "2020-05-27", "authors": ["Alexandre MLehnen", "Graziela HPinto", "J\u00faliaBorges", "Melissa MMarkoski", "Beatriz DSchaan"], "doi": "10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0337"}
{"title": "Nuclear filaments: role in chromosomal positioning and gene expression.", "abstract": "Nuclear lamins form an elastic meshwork underlying the inner nuclear membrane and provide mechanical rigidity to the nucleus and maintain shape. Lamins also maintain chromosome positioning and play important roles in several nuclear processes like replication, DNA damage repair, transcription, and epigenetic modifications. LMNA mutations affect cardiac tissue, muscle tissues, adipose tissues to precipitate several diseases collectively termed as laminopathies. However, the rationale behind LMNA mutations and laminopathies continues to elude scientists. During interphase, several chromosomes form inter/intrachromosomal contacts inside nucleoplasm and several chromosomal loops also stretch out to make a 'loop-cluster' which are key players to regulate gene expressions. In this perspective, we have proposed that the lamin network in tandem with nuclear actin and myosin provide mechanical rigidity to the chromosomal contacts and facilitate loop-clusters movements. LMNA mutations thus might perturb the landscape of chromosomal contacts or loop-clusters positioning which can impair gene expression profile.", "journal": "Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)", "date": "2020-05-27", "authors": ["ManindraBera", "KaushikSengupta"], "doi": "10.1080/19491034.2020.1769445\n10.7554/eLife.25776"}
{"title": "Intravenously delivered mesenchymal stem cells prevent microvascular obstruction formation after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Microvascular obstruction (MVO) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) is identified as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The inflammatory response induced by ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury is considered one of the main mechanisms of MVO. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a unique stromal cell type that confers an immunomodulatory effect in cardiac disease. The present study aimed to investigate whether immediate intravenous delivery of MSCs could be used as a potential therapeutic method to attenuate MVO formation. A cardiac catheterization-induced porcine model of myocardial I/R injury was established, and allograft MSCs were immediately delivered intravenously. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed on days 2 and 7 after the operation to determine the infarct area, MVO, and cardiac function. The pigs with allograft MSCs showed decreased MVO and infarct size, as well as an improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Histological analysis revealed decreased myocyte area, fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the peri-infarct zone of pigs with allograft MSCs. Moreover, the concentrations of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum were reduced in the allograft MSC group compared to the control group. Flow cytometry indicated decreased natural killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood and ischemic heart tissue in the pigs with allograft MSCs. In summary, allograft MSCs delivered intravenously and immediately after myocardial I/R injury can attenuate MVO formation in a porcine model through a decline in the number of NK cells in the myocardium.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2020-05-27", "authors": ["JunzhuoWang", "ZiweiChen", "QingDai", "JinxuanZhao", "ZilunWei", "JiaxinHu", "XuanSun", "JunXie", "BiaoXu"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-020-0800-8"}

{"title": "Evidence linking the role of periodontal viruses in coronary artery disease with and without periodontitis.", "abstract": "Viruses are considered to be a newer family associated with inflammatory diseases. Yet the role of periodontal viruses in coronary artery diseases (CAD) remains unclear. Thus, the current study aims to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal viruses and compare the same in cardiac samples of CAD patients with and without periodontitis.\nA total of 60 patients with CAD indicated for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were included. These were grouped into 36 patients with healthy periodontium (CAD only) and 24 patients with periodontitis (CAD + P). The demographic variables, cardiac parameters and periodontal parameters were recorded. Cardiac tissue samples were collected during the CABG surgery and were analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for periodontal viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Herpes simplex virus. All the parameters were statistically analyzed.\nAmong the demographic variables, age was statistically significant between the groups. Plaque index, bleeding index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level (CAL) were significantly higher in CAD+P group (P \u02c20.05). Periodontal viruses such as EBV and CMV were significantly higher (62.5% and 75% respectively, P \u02c20.05) in the cardiac samples of the CAD+P than CAD only (25% and 47.2%, respectively).

However, percutaneous transcatheter closure therapy has become a successful alternative in carefully selected group of patients. Echocardiography is a cornerstone in the initial diagnosis, assessment of the severity and location of the PVL. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in the assessment of the feasibility for percutaneous closure and during intra-procedural guidance. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has the advantage over transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) of not being affected by the acoustic shadow of the mitral prosthesis that usually hides the regurgitation jets and makes TTE evaluation difficult. Three-dimensional (3D) TEE has been shown to provide better diagnostic accuracy compared to two-dimensional (2D) TEE as regard to evaluation of PVLs especially in patients with more than one PVL. This is due to better delineation of the location, shape, and size of the PVL and equally important during guiding the transcatheter percutaneous closure.", "journal": "Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)", "date": "2020-05-26", "authors": ["HaniMahmoud-Elsayed"], "doi": "10.1111/echo.14708"}
{"title": "Magnetic Adjustment of Afterload in Engineered Heart Tissues.", "abstract": "Afterload is known to drive the development of both physiological and pathological cardiac states. As such, studying the outcomes of altered afterload states could yield important insights into the mechanisms controlling these critical processes. However, an experimental technique for precisely fine-tuning afterload in heart tissue over time is currently lacking. Here, a newly developed magnetics-based technique for achieving this control in engineered heart tissues (EHTs) is described. In order to produce magnetically responsive EHTs (MR-EHTs), the tissues are mounted on hollow silicone posts, some of which contain small permanent magnets. A second set of permanent magnets is press-fit into an acrylic plate such that they are oriented with the same polarity and are axially-aligned with the post magnets. To adjust afterload, this plate of magnets is translated toward (higher afterload) or away (lower afterload) from the post magnets using a piezoelectric stage fitted with an encoder. The motion control software used to adjust stage positioning allows for the development of user-defined afterload regimens while the encoder ensures that the stage corrects for any inconsistencies in its location. This work describes the fabrication, calibration, and implementation of this system to enable the development of similar platforms in other labs around the world.

{"title": "Tragus Nerve Stimulation Suppresses Post-Infarction Ventricular Arrhythmia by Modulating Autonomic Activity and Heterogeneities of Cardiac Receptor Distribution.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Imbalanced cardiac autonomic control and cardiac receptors redistribution contribute to the arrhythmogenic substrate under the myocardial infarction (MI) condition. Stimulating the auricular branch of vagus nerve (AB-VNS) has been proven to reduce post-infarction ventricular arrhythmia (VAs), but its potential mechanisms were largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether long-term intermittent low-intensity AB-VNS could produce a protective effect on modulating autonomic activities and abnormal redistribution of autonomic nerve efferent receptors in a MI canine model. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve healthy beagle dogs underwent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery to establish a MI model and were randomized into 2 groups: an AB-VNS group, (AB-VNS for 4 weeks) and a control group (sham stimulation for 4 weeks). Dynamic electrocardiogram recording, neural recording, catecholamine concentration, and histological studies were conducted subsequently. RESULTS Compared to the control group, the AB-VNS group had significantly suppressed post-infarction VAs, reduced low frequency (LF) power and increased high frequency (HF) power. In the AB-VNS group, with the progression of reduced cardiac sympathetic activities and augmented cardiac parasympathetic activities, the catecholamine concentration in heart tissue declined in the peripheral infarction area and right ventricle (RV); tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons decreased in the inferior cardiac sympathetic nerve, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons increased in the cervical vagus nerve. Expression of TrkA and P75NGFR were reduced in the peripheral MI (peri-MI) and non-MI area with AB-VNS. The mRNA expression of adrenergic and nicotinic receptors (\u00df\u2081-AR, \u00df\u2083-AR, and CHRNA7) significantly declined in the peri-MI and non-MI area of the AB-VNS group. CONCLUSIONS Chronic intermittent low-intensity AB-VNS effectively suppressed post-infarction VAs by potentially rebalancing extracardiac intrathoracic autonomic activities, reducing excessive cardiac sympathetic denervation, and attenuating the heterogeneities of cardiac efferent nerve receptors distribution.", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "date": "2020-05-25", "authors": ["HuaxinSun", "Buajieer-GuliNasi-Er", "XueshengWang", "LingZhang", "YanmeiLu", "XianhuiZhou", "YaodongLi", "LianweiDong", "QinaZhou", "BaoPengTang"], "doi": "10.12659/MSM.922277"}
{"title": "Downregulation of miR-133a contributes to the cardiac developmental toxicity of trichloroethylene in zebrafish.", "abstract": "Trichloroethylene (TCE), a widely used organic solvent, is a common environmental pollutant. Increasing evidence indicates that maternal TCE exposure is associated with congenital cardiac defects, but the underlining mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that TCE exposure significantly induced heart defects and dysfunctions in zebrafish embryos. Heart tissues were dissected and subjected to high throughput sequencing and qPCR to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. The effects of miRNA were further verified by microinjection of antagomir or agomir. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and cell proliferation were measured by using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and EdU staining, respectively. Our results showed that 19 miRNAs were downregulated whereas 48 miRNAs were upregulated in the heart of zebrafish embryos. The downregulation of miR-133a and the upregulation of miR-182 were further validated. Moreover, we found that miR-133a agomir significantly alleviated the TCE-induced heart defects while miR-133a antagomir mimicked the toxic effect of TCE on heart development. Furthermore, miR-133a agomir significantly counteracted TCE-induced ROS production and excessive cell proliferation in the heart of zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, our results indicate that miR-133a mediates TCE-induced ROS generation, leading to excessive cell proliferation and heart defects.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2020-05-24", "authors": ["YujieHuang", "BinJiang", "YingXia", "JinWang", "ChengJi", "JianTong", "TaoChen", "YanJiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126610"}

Heat wave and ozone pollution were simulated on the Shanghai Meteorological and Environmental Animal Exposure System. Eighteen hypertensive rats were randomly divided into a control group, an ozone group, and a heat wave plus ozone group. The experimental groups were transferred to the exposure system for exposure to the ozone and heat wave plus ozone. After exposure, blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta, and the hearts were harvested in all groups. The concentrations of inflammatory factors, vasomotion factors, cardiovascular risk factors, oxidative stress and thrombosis factors and heat stress factors in heart tissue were measured in each rat. Ozone exposure and heat wave plus ozone exposure increased the levels of inflammatory factors, thrombosis factors, vasomotion factors and cardiovascular risk factors, except for HDL-C, which was reduced. Moreover, experimental exposure increased the heat stress factors and oxidative stress, except for SOD, which was decreased. These data demonstrated that both ozone exposure and heat wave plus ozone exposure could adversely affect hypertensive rats, and that heat wave may enhance the toxic effect of ozone exposure.", "journal": "International journal of biometeorology", "date": "2020-05-23", "authors": ["TingtingLiang", "JingpingNiu", "ShuyuZhang", "QuanquanSong", "JiZhou"], "doi": "10.1007/s00484-019-01788-w"}
{"title": "Pum2 mediates Sirt1 mRNA decay and exacerbates hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.", "abstract": "Pum2 is a ribonucleic acid binding protein that controls target mRNA turnover. It has been reported to be potentially associated with cardiac fibrosis. However, little is known about the role of Pum2 in cardiac disease. In this study, we found that Pum2 was upregulated in the rat heart tissue subjected to ischemia/reperfusion procedure and cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs) with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment. Further, knockdown of Pum2 showed a beneficial effect on H/R treated NRVMs through decreasing caspase 3-associated apoptosis, whereas overexpression of Pum2 increased H/R-induced NRVMs apoptosis. Moreover, our results demonstrated that Sirt1 was identified as the target of Pum2-mediated mRNA decay in cardiomyocytes, and two Pum2 binding elements were found in the 3'-untranslated region of Sirt1 mRNA. Additionally, overexpression of Pum2 prompted the acetylation of LKB1 by decreasing Sirt1's mRNA level, which in turn repressed the activity of AMPK pathway in both normoxic and H/R-treated NRVMs. Finally, our data indicated that the pro-apoptotic effect of Pum2 was dependent on Sirt1 and AMPK.

{"title": "Molecular dissection of Chagas induced cardiomyopathy reveals central disease associated and druggable signaling pathways.", "abstract": "Chagas disease, the clinical presentation of T. cruzi infection, is a major human health concern. While the acute phase of Chagas disease is typically asymptomatic and self-resolving, chronically infected individuals suffer numerous sequelae later in life. Cardiomyopathies in particular are the most severe consequence of chronic Chagas disease and cannot be reversed solely by parasite load reduction. To prioritize new therapeutic targets, we unbiasedly interrogated the host signaling events in heart tissues isolated from a Chagas disease mouse model using quantitative, multiplexed proteomics. We defined the host response to infection at both the proteome and phospho-proteome levels. The proteome showed an increase in the immune response and a strong repression of several mitochondrial proteins. Complementing the proteome studies, the phospho-proteomic survey found an abundance of phospho-site alterations in plasma membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of kinase activity provided substantial evidence for the activation of NDRG2 and JNK/p38 kinases during Chagas disease. A significant activation of DYRK2 and AMPKA2 and the inhibition of casein family kinases were also predicted. We concluded our analyses by linking the diseased heart proteome profile to known therapeutic interventions, uncovering a potential to target mitochondrial proteins, secreted immune effectors and core kinases for the treatment of chronic Chagas disease. Together, this study provides molecular insight into host proteome and phospho-proteome responses to T. cruzi infection in the heart for the first time, highlighting pathways that can be further validated for functional contributions to disease and suitability as drug targets.", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "date": "2020-05-21", "authors": ["Jacob MWozniak", "Tatiana Ara\u00fajoSilva", "DianeThomas", "Jair LSiqueira-Neto", "James HMcKerrow", "David JGonzalez", "Claudia MCalvet"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0007980\n10.1186/1756-3305-7-317\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0005033\n10.1086/605091\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-020117-043711\n10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70002-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31612-4\n10.1016/j.ccl.2016.08.013\n10.1016/s0020-7519(01)00311-3\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.12.023\n10.7554/eLife.34039\n10.1097/QCO.0000000000000157\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2008.08.002\n10.1023/a:1020546615229\n10.1016/j.ijmm.2008.08.005\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0003747\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0006792\n10.20944/preprints201905.0171.v1\n10.2174/092986707782023325\n10.1111/bph.13002\n10.1073/pnas.251194298\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2010.04.001\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0004490\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.04.001\n10.1128/MMBR.00031-10\n10.1242/jcs.00963\n10.1038/nbt0303-255\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.111\n10.1074/mcp.M116.066019\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2015.03.034\n10.1590/0037-8682-0184-2018\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0007602\n10.1016/0167-5273(91)90012-e\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.001\n10.1073/pnas.1606444113\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btr671\n10.1093/nar/gky1131\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1093/nar/gkn923\n10.1016/s0952-7915(99)80014-4\n10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.07.006\n10.1189/jlb.0309187\n10.1086/427515\n10.1111/imm.12438\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002469\n10.4269/ajtmh.1993.49.192\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079629\n10.1186/s13071-018-2988-0\n10.1086/653481\n10.1172/jci.insight.86898\n10.1016/0092-8674(94)90278-x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.08.195\n10.1016/j.gene.2012.04.044\n10.1093/protein/gzq094\n10.7717/peerj.7046\n10.1002/0471250953.bi1315s35\n10.1074/mcp.M115.052357\n10.1093/nar/gkj067\n10.1093/nar/gkx1037\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016959\n10.1016/j.exppara.2017.09.019\n10.1074/mcp.M111.010918\n10.1074/mcp.M112.017640\n10.3389/fmicb.2018.03320\n10.1007/s12192-019-01018-7\n10.1074/mcp.M114.040329\n10.1002/pmic.201200078\n10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00266-4\n10.3390/jcm7090258\n10.1016/s0378-4347(97)00303-4\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0005472\n10.1128/AAC.00514-18\n10.1517/14728222.2013.837886\n10.1186/s12865-017-0237-5\n10.1089/jir.2010.0102\n10.1038/ni.3440\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024434\n10.1073/pnas.1205635110\n10.1111/cmi.12807\n10.1089/ARS.2008.2418\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.04.009\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006800\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.827949\n10.1165/rcmb.2016-0104OC\n10.1007/s10741-015-9487-6\n10.1247/csf.27.1\n10.1093/hmg/ddq315\n10.1016/j.gene.2015.09.008\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.004560\n10.1016/j.gene.2015.06.027\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.056\n10.1161/01.RES.0000263008.66799.aa\n10.1016/j.imbio.2016.01.009\n10.18632/oncotarget.4544\n10.1002/ijc.23945\n10.1093/carcin/bgp047\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303613\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.02.028\n10.18632/oncotarget.2328\n10.1038/nrc3818\n10.1007/s00395-013-0341-5\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2016.07.004\n10.1101/cshperspect.a000158\n10.1006/smim.2000.0210\n10.1093/emboj/16.8.1909\n10.1128/mcb.19.3.1871\n10.1080/15384101.2015.1007751\n10.1016/j.molcel.2007.02.007\n10.1002/cm.21021\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001660\n10.1128/MCB.00025-07\n10.1371/journal.pone.0177834\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90311-y\n10.1007/s00109-008-0352-0\n10.1134/S0006297918060123\n10.1002/ajh.25125\n10.1371/journal.pone.0112682\n10.3390/ijms18102222\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0006132\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1074/mcp.M500339-MCP200\n10.1016/0003-2697(84)90782-6\n10.3791/51416\n10.1021/ac0262560\n10.1021/ac301572t\n10.1021/ac502040v\n10.1016/1044-0305(94)80016-2\n10.1038/nmeth785\n10.1038/nmeth1019\n10.1038/nmeth.1714\n10.1038/nbt.3955\n10.1186/1471-2105-12-S1-S22"}

However, limited attention is focused on the unique phenotype of ILCs in the heart tissue. In this study, we analyzed the ILC subsets in the heart by flow cytometry and found that ILC2s were the dominant population of ILCs, while a lower proportion of type 1 ILCs (including ILC1 and NK cells) and merely no ILC3s in the heart tissue of mice. Our results show that ILC2 development kinetically peaked in heart ILC2s at the age of 4 weeks after birth and later than lung ILC2s. By conducting parabiosis experiment, we show that heart ILC2s are tissue resident cells and minimally replaced by circulating cells. Notably, heart ILC2s have unique phenotypes, such as lower expression of ICOS, CD25 (IL-2R\u03b1), and Ki-67, higher expression of Sca-1 and GATA3, and stronger ability to produce IL-4 and IL-13.

{"title": "The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE-2, is expressed on many different cell types: implications for ACE-inhibitor- and angiotensin II receptor blocker-based\u00a0cardiovascular therapies.", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a spike protein allowing viral binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which acts as a viral receptor and is expressed on the surface of several pulmonary and extra-pulmonary cell types, including cardiac, renal, intestinal and endothelial cells. There is evidence that also endothelial cells are infected by SARS-COV-2, with subsequent occurrence of systemic vasculitis, thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Those effects, together with the \"cytokine storm\" are involved in a worse prognosis. In clinical practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In in vivo studies, ACE-Is and ARBs seem to paradoxically increase ACE-2 expression, which could favour SARS-CoV-2 infection of host's cells and tissues. By contrast, in patients treated with ACE-Is and ARBs, ACE-2 shows a downregulation at the mRNA and protein levels in kidney and cardiac tissues. Yet, it has been claimed that both ARBs and ACE-Is could result potentially useful in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. As detected in China and as the Italian epidemiological situation confirms, the most prevalent comorbidities in deceased patients with COVID-19 are hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Older COVID-19-affected patients with cardiovascular comorbidities exhibit a more severe clinical course and a worse prognosis, with many of them being also treated with ARBs or ACE-Is. Another confounding factor is cigarette smoking, which has been reported to increase ACE-2 expression in both experimental models and humans. Sex also plays a role, with chromosome X harbouring the gene coding for ACE-2, which is one of the possible explanations of why mortality in female patients is lower.\u00a0Viral entry also depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity, an androgen dependent enzyme. Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies.\u00a0We claim the need of adequately powered, prospective studies aimed at answering the following questions of paramount importance for cardiovascular, internal and emergency medicine: Do ACE-Is and ARBs exert similar or different effects on infection or disease course?

The speed of sound was 1537 \u00b1 39 m/s, close to typical values for cardiac tissue (\u223c1576 m/s). The attenuation coefficient was 1.07 dB/cm\u00b7MHz, within the range of values previously reported for cardiac tissue (0.81-1.81 dB/cm\u00b7MHz). A cardiac model based on human anatomy was developed using established image segmentation processes and conventional plastic molding techniques. Key anatomic features were observed, captured and identified in the model using an intracardiac ultrasound imaging system.

{"title": "Proteome analysis of secretions from human monocyte-derived macrophages post-exposure to biomaterials and the effect of secretions on cardiac fibroblast fibrotic character.", "abstract": "The use of exogenous biomolecules (BM) for the purpose of repairing and regenerating damaged cardiac tissue can yield serious side effects if used for prolonged periods. As well, such strategies can be cost prohibitive depending on the regiment and period of time applied. Alternatively, autologous monocytes/monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) can provide a viable path towards generating an endogenous source of stimulatory BM. Biomaterials are often considered as delivery vehicles to generate unique profiles of such BM in tissues or to deliver autologous cells, that can influence the nature of BM produced by the cells. MDM cultured on a degradable polar hydrophobic ionic (D-PHI) polyurethane has previously demonstrated a propensity to increase select anti-inflammatory cytokines, and therefore there is good rationale to further investigate a broader spectrum of the cells' BM in order to provide a more complete proteomic analysis of human MDM secretions induced by D-PHI. Further, it is of interest to assess the potential of such BM to influence cells involved in the reparative state of vital tissues such as those that affect cardiac cell function. Hence, this current study examines the proteomic profile of MDM secretions using mass spectrometry for the first time, along with ELISA, following their culture on D-PHI, and compares them to two important reference materials, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). Secretions collected from D-PHI cultured MDM led to higher levels of regenerative BM, AGRN, TGFBI and ANXA5, but lower levels of pro-fibrotic BM, MMP7, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1,\u00a0 when compared to MDM secretions collected from PLGA and TCPS. In the application to cardiac cell function, the secretion collected from D-PHI cultured MDM led to more human cardiac fibroblast (HCFs) migration. A lower collagen gel contraction induced by MDM secretions collected from D-PHI was supported by gene array analysis for human fibrosis-related genes. The implication of these findings is that more tailored biomaterials such as D-PHI, may lead to a lower pro-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages when used in cardiac tissue constructs, thereby enabling the development of vehicles for the delivery of interventional therapies, or be applied as coatings for sensor implants in cardiac tissue that minimize fibrosis. The general approach of using synthetic biomaterials in order to induce MDM secretions in a manner that will guide favorable regeneration will be critical in making the choice of biomaterials for tissue regeneration work in the future. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Immune modulation strategies currently applied in cardiac tissue repair are mainly based on the delivery of defined exogenous biomolecules. However, the use of such biomolecules may pose wide ranging systemic effects, thereby rendering them clinically less practical. The chemistry of biomaterials (used as a potential targeted delivery modality to circumvent the broad systemic effects of biomolecules) can not only affect acute and chronic toxicity but also alters the timeframe of the wound healing cascade. In this context, monocytes/monocyte-derive macrophages (MDM) can be harnessed as an immune modulating strategy to promote wound healing by an appropriate choice of the biomaterial. However, there are limited reports on the complete proteome analysis of MDM and their reaction of biomaterial related interventions on cardiac tissues and cells. No studies to date have demonstrated the complete proteome of MDM secretions when these cells were cultured on a non-traditional immune modulatory ionomeric polyurethane D-PHI film. This study demonstrated that MDM cultured on D-PHI expressed significantly higher levels of AGRN, TGFBI and ANXA5 but lower levels of MMP7, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 when compared to MDM cultured on a well-established degradable biomaterials in the medical field, e.g. PLGA and TCPS, which are often used as the relative standards for cell culture work in the biomaterials field. The implications of these findings have relevance to the repair of cardiac tissues. In another aspect of the work, human cardiac fibroblasts showed significantly lower contractility (low collagen gel contraction and low levels of ACTA2) when cultured in the presence of MDM secretions collected after culturing them on D-PHI compared to PLGA and TCPS. The findings place emphasis on the importance of making the choice of biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applied to their use in cardiac tissue repair.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2020-05-20", "authors": ["SujaShrestha", "Meghan JMcFadden", "Anthony OGramolini", "J PaulSanterre"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2020.04.042"}

Biomarkers linked to the clinical deterioration can be crucial in developing effective treatments. However, to date the progression of cardiac amyloidosis is poorly characterized. There is an urgent need to identify key predictors for disease progression and cardiac tissue function. In this proof of concept study, we estimate a group of new markers based on mathematical models of the left ventricle derived from routine clinical magnetic resonance imaging and follow-up scans from the National Amyloidosis Center at the Royal Free in London. Using mechanical modeling and statistical classification, we show that it is possible to predict disease progression. Our predictions agree with clinical assessments in a double-blind test in six out of the seven sample cases studied. Importantly, we find that multiple factors need to be used in the classification, which includes mechanical, geometrical and shape features. No single marker can yield reliable prediction given the complexity of the growth and remodeling process of diseased hearts undergoing high-dimensional shape changes.

Upon CLP operation, each mouse was intraperitoneally treated with 10 \u00b5g of recombinant Sj-Cys (rSj-Cys). Twelve hours after CLP, the systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricular were examined by echocardiography. The levels of myoglobin (Mb), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in sera, and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in cardiac tissues were examined as biomarkers for heart injury. The heart tissue was collected for checking pathological changes, macrophages and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. To address the signaling pathway involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of rSj-Cys, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) was determined in heart tissue of mice with sepsis and LPS-stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes. In addition, the therapeutic effects of rSj-Cys on LPS-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis were also detected. The levels of M1 biomarker iNOS and M2 biomarker Arg-1 were detected in heart tissue. The pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, and regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 were measured in sera and their mRNA levels in heart tissue of rSj-Cys-treated mice.\nAfter rSj-Cys treatment, the sepsis-induced heart malfunction was largely improved. The inflammation and injury of heart tissue were significantly alleviated, characterized as significantly decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells in cardiac tissues and fiber swelling, reduced levels of Mb, cTnI and NT-proBNP in sera, and MPO activity in heart tissue. The therapeutic efficacy of rSj-Cys is associated with downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and upregulated regulatory inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2), possibly through inhibiting the LPS-MyD88 signal pathway.\nRSj-Cys significantly reduced sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and could be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of sepsis associated cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Parasites & vectors", "date": "2020-05-20", "authors": ["ShifangGao", "HuihuiLi", "HongXie", "ShiliWu", "YuanYuan", "LiangChu", "SiyingSun", "HuijuanYang", "LingqinWu", "YongshengBai", "QiaoZhou", "XinWang", "BinZhan", "HuCui", "XiaodiYang"], "doi": "10.1186/s13071-020-04104-3"}

To evaluate the suitability of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) for predictive safety pharmacology, we quantified changes in contractility, voltage, and/or Ca2+ handling in 2D monolayers or 3D engineered heart tissues (EHTs). Protocols were unified via a drug training set, allowing subsequent blinded multicenter evaluation of drugs with known positive, negative, or neutral inotropic effects. Accuracy ranged from 44% to 85% across the platform-cell configurations, indicating the need to refine test conditions. This was achieved by adopting approaches to reduce signal-to-noise ratio, reduce spontaneous beat rate to \u2264 1\u2009Hz or enable chronic testing, improving accuracy to 85% for monolayers and 93% for EHTs. Contraction amplitude was a good predictor of negative inotropes across all the platform-cell configurations and of positive inotropes in the 3D EHTs. Although contraction- and relaxation-time provided confirmatory readouts forpositive inotropes in 3D EHTs, these parameters typically served as the primary source of predictivity in 2D. The reliance of these \"secondary\" parameters to inotropy in the 2D systems was not automatically intuitive and may be a quirk of hiPSC-CMs, hence require adaptations in interpreting the data from this model system. Of the platform-cell configurations, responses in EHTs aligned most closely to the free therapeutic plasma concentration.

While current progress in biomedical research provides a number of biofabrication methods, the construction of multi-dimensional cardiac tissue is highly challenging due to difficulties in the maturation and synchronization of cardiomyocytes (CMs) in conjunction with other types of cells, such as myofibroblasts and endothelial cells. Here, we show a simple fabrication methodology to construct multi-dimensional cardiac macro tissue (mCMT) by layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition of cells on micro patterned PDMS. mCMTs formed by LBL deposition of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts formed 3D patterned structures with synchronized beating characteristics. We also demonstrate that cardiac maturation factors such as the gene expression of MLC2v and cTNI and formation of sarcomeres in mCMTs were significantly enhanced by LBL deposition and growth factors during the maturation process. Fabrication of matured mCMTs with synchronized beating enables providing an efficient platform for evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of drug candidates.

In vivo models of toxicity involved chloroquine administered intravenously to pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats and rabbits. Randomised, controlled treatment studies in rats assessed diazepam, clonazepam and Ro5-4864 administered: (i) prior, (ii) during and (iii) after chloroquine and the effects of diazepam: (iv) at high dose, (v) in urethane-anaesthetised rats and (vi) co-administered with adrenaline.\nChloroquine decreased the developed tension of left atria, prolonged the effective refractory period of atria, ventricular tissue and right papillary muscles, and caused dose-dependent impairment of haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters. Cardiac arrhythmias indicated impairment of atrioventricular conduction. Studies (i), (ii) and (v) showed no differences between treatments and control. Diazepam increased heart rate in study (iv) and as with clonazepam also prolonged the QTc interval in study (iii). Combined administration of diazepam and adrenaline in study (vi) improved cardiac contractility but caused hypokalaemia.\nNeither diazepam nor other ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites protect against or attenuate chloroquine cardiotoxicity. However, diazepam may augment the effects of positive inotropes in reducing chloroquine cardiotoxicity.\nThis article is part of a themed issue on The Pharmacology of COVID-19.

{"title": "Small molecule 2'-deoxycytidine differentiates human umbilical cord-derived MSCs into cardiac progenitors in vitro and their in vivo xeno-transplantation improves cardiac function.", "abstract": "Small molecules are widely used to induce stem cell differentiation. 2'-deoxycytidine (2-DC) belongs to the cytidine family. It stimulates the expression of cardiac-specific genes and proteins, and directs mesenchymal stem cells towards cardiomyogenic differentiation. We aim to investigate the role of 2-DC-treated human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) into myogenic lineage and explore their application in regeneration of infarcted myocardium. UC-MSCs were treated with 5, 10, 20, and 40\u00a0\u00b5M 2-DC following optimization by cytotoxicity analysis. Rat model of myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by ligating left anterior descending coronary artery. Normal, and 2-DC treated UC-MSCs were transplanted in the left ventricular wall immediately after ligation. Echocardiographic measurements were performed to assess cardiac function. Tissue architecture of the myocardium was examined by histological analysis to determine fate of the transplanted cells. MSCs were successfully isolated from human umbilical cord tissue. 2-DC treatment did not produce any significant cytotoxic effect in UC-MSCs at all concentrations. qPCR analysis of treated UC-MSCs showed induction of myogenic differentiation, which is more pronounced at 20\u00a0\u03bcM concentration. Fluorescently labeled 2-DC-treated UC-MSCs showed significant (**P\u2009<\u20090.01) homing in the infarcted myocardium as compared to normal UC-MSCs. Hearts transplanted with 2-DC-treated UC-MSCs significantly (***P\u2009<\u20090.001) improved the cardiac systolic and diastolic functions and pumping ability as compared to normal UC-MSCs and MI groups. Fibrotic area and left ventricular wall thickness were significantly improved (***P\u2009<\u20090.001) in 2-DC-treated group as compared to normal UC-MSCs. Immunohistochemical staining showed co-localization of fluorescently labeled cells and patches of differentiated myocytes which were stained for cardiac proteins in the infarct zone implying that the treated UC-MSCs regenerated cardiomyocytes. We report for the first time that 2-DC induces cardiac differentiation in UC-MSCs. Transplanted cells differentiated into functional cardiomyocytes and significantly improved cardiac performance. These pre-differentiated cardiac progenitors showed better survival, homing, and distribution in the infarcted zone. 2-DC treated cells not only improved cardiac function, but also restored tissue homeostasis, suggesting a better therapeutic option for the regeneration of cardiac tissue in the clinical setup.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2020-05-18", "authors": ["Syeda RoohinaAli", "WaqasAhmad", "NadiaNaeem", "AsmatSalim", "IrfanKhan"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-020-03750-6"}
{"title": "Bioresorbable Polymeric Scaffold in Cardiovascular Applications.", "abstract": "Advances in material science and innovative medical technologies have allowed the development of less invasive interventional procedures for deploying implant devices, including scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering. Biodegradable materials (e.g., resorbable polymers) are employed in devices that are only needed for a transient period. In the case of coronary stents, the device is only required for 6-8 months before positive remodelling takes place. Hence, biodegradable polymeric stents have been considered to promote this positive remodelling and eliminate the issue of permanent caging of the vessel. In tissue engineering, the role of the scaffold is to support favourable cell-scaffold interaction to stimulate formation of functional tissue. The ideal outcome is for the cells to produce their own extracellular matrix over time and eventually replace the implanted scaffold or tissue engineered construct. Synthetic biodegradable polymers are the favoured candidates as scaffolds, because their degradation rates can be manipulated over a broad time scale, and they may be functionalised easily. This review presents an overview of coronary heart disease, the limitations of current interventions and how biomaterials can be used to potentially circumvent these shortcomings in bioresorbable stents, vascular grafts and cardiac patches.

Although much progress has been made toward the generation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), several lines of evidence indicate that two-dimensional (2D) cell culturing presents significant limitations, including hiPS-CMs immaturity and the absence of interaction between different cell types and the extracellular matrix. More recently, new advances in bioengineering and co-culture systems have allowed the generation of three-dimensional (3D) constructs based on hiPSC-derived cells. Within these systems, biochemical and physical stimuli influence the maturation of hiPS-CMs, which can show structural and functional properties more similar to those present in adult cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Differential expression of microRNA in serum fractions and association of Argonaute 1 microRNAs with heart failure.", "abstract": "The serum or plasma microRNA (miRNA) molecules have been suggested as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, in various pathological conditions. However, these molecules are also found in different serum fractions, such as exosomes and Argonaute (Ago) protein complexes. Ago1 is the predominant Ago protein expressed in heart tissue. The objective of the study was to examine the hypothesis that Ago1-associated miRNAs may be more relevant to cardiac disease and heart failure compared with the serum. In total, 84 miRNA molecules were screened for their expression in the whole serum, exosomes and Ago1, and Ago2 complexes. Ago1-bound miR-222-3p, miR-497-5p and miR-21-5p were significantly higher, and let-7a-5p was significantly lower in HF patients compared with healthy controls, whereas no such difference was observed for those markers in the serum samples among the groups. A combination of these 4 miRNAs into an Ago1-HF score provided a ROC curve with an AUC of 1, demonstrating clear discrimination between heart failure patients and healthy individuals. Ago1 fraction might be a better and more specific platform for identifying HF-related miRNAs compared with the whole serum.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2020-05-14", "authors": ["EtiMeiri", "NataliaVolinsky", "NirDromi", "SharonKredo-Russo", "HilaBenjamin", "SaritTabak", "HagaiMarmor", "MariaMotin", "DanitLebanony", "GilaLithwick-Yanai", "EttiKadosh", "CarolKreader", "LizaGrosman-Rimon", "OfferAmir"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.15306"}
{"title": "Changes in gene expression patterns in postmortem human myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "In murine models, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported to be the result of tissue injury and inflammation. In the present study, mRNA expression of iNOS, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was investigated in postmortem human infarction hearts. Since HIF-1\u03b1 is the inducible subunit of the transcription factor HIF-1, which regulates transcription of iNOS and VEGF, the interrelation between the three genes was observed, to examine the molecular processes during the emergence of MI. iNOS and VEGF mRNAs were found to be significantly upregulated in the affected regions of MI hearts in comparison to healthy controls. Upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 was also present but not significant. Correlation analysis of the three genes indicated a stronger and significant correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 and iNOS mRNAs than between HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF. The results of the study revealed differences in the expression patterns of HIF-1 downstream targets. The stronger transcription of iNOS by HIF-1 in the affected regions of MI hearts may represent a pathological process, since no correlation of iNOS and HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA was found in non-affected areas of MI hearts. Oxidative stress is considered to cause molecular changes in MI, leading to increased iNOS expression. Therefore, it may also represent a forensic marker for detection of early changes in heart tissue.", "journal": "International journal of legal medicine", "date": "2020-05-14", "authors": ["VerenaWilmes", "ConstantinLux", "ConstanzeNiess", "EliseGradhand", "Marcel AVerhoff", "SilkeKauferstein"], "doi": "10.1007/s00414-020-02311-2"}

With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, a number of circRNAs have been identified and proved to play key roles in various pathophysiological processes, such as metabolic diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases. An increasing number of studies have shown that circRNAs are widely expressed in cardiac tissues and play important roles in the development of multiple cardiovascular diseases. Here, we review the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and functions and the roles of circRNAs in cardiovascular diseases.

{"title": "Protein exchange is reduced in calcium-independent epithelial junctions.", "abstract": "Desmosomes are cell-cell junctions that provide mechanical integrity to epithelial and cardiac tissues. Desmosomes have two distinct adhesive states, calcium-dependent and hyperadhesive, which balance tissue plasticity and strength. A highly ordered array of cadherins in the adhesive interface is hypothesized to drive hyperadhesion, but how desmosome structure confers adhesive state is still elusive. We employed fluorescence polarization microscopy to show that cadherin order is not required for hyperadhesion induced by pharmacologic and genetic approaches. FRAP experiments in cells treated with the PKC\u03b1 inhibitor G\u00f66976 revealed that cadherins, plakoglobin, and desmoplakin have significantly reduced exchange in and out of hyperadhesive desmosomes. To test whether this was a result of enhanced keratin association, we used the desmoplakin mutant S2849G, which conferred reduced protein exchange. We propose that inside-out regulation of protein exchange modulates adhesive function, whereby proteins are \"locked in\" to hyperadhesive desmosomes while protein exchange confers plasticity on calcium-dependent desmosomes, thereby providing rapid control of adhesion.", "journal": "The Journal of cell biology", "date": "2020-05-14", "authors": ["Emily IBartle", "Tejeshwar CRao", "Reena RBeggs", "William FDean", "Tara MUrner", "Andrew PKowalczyk", "Alexa LMattheyses"], "doi": "10.1083/jcb.201906153\n10.1038/nature05994\n10.1111/j.0022-202X.2005.23630.x\n10.1083/jcb.201406020\n10.1016/j.bpj.2017.09.028\n10.1083/jcb.200712133\n10.1038/ncb3456\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1454\n10.1242/jcs.222893\n10.1083/jcb.200101089\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.07.008\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.12.020\n10.1371/journal.pone.0071491\n10.1101/cshperspect.a029181\n10.1155/2010/212439\n10.1042/BST0360195\n10.1038/jid.2012.275\n10.1242/jcs.02700\n10.1007/s00441-003-0812-3\n10.1083/jcb.200510038\n10.1101/cshperspect.a002576\n10.1091/mbc.e02-09-0582\n10.3109/15419061.2013.855204\n10.1073/pnas.1606272113\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600192\n10.1126/science.1086957\n10.1002/anie.200802376\n10.1038/jid.2011.318\n10.1038/nature09621\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031128\n10.1038/sj.jid.5700643\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.06.025\n10.1083/jcb.139.3.773\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.05.021\n10.1083/jcb.201208162\n10.1242/jcs.146316\n10.1073/pnas.1607674113\n10.1074/jbc.272.34.21495\n10.1074/jbc.M101907200\n10.1242/jcs.171892\n10.1083/jcb.201205029\n10.1126/science.7824937\n10.1042/BST0360173\n10.1038/nrm2957\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb19080.x\n10.1016/j.tibs.2007.02.003\n10.1083/jcb.42.1.322\n10.1016/S0006-3495(03)75133-9\n10.1101/cshperspect.a029207\n10.1038/nmeth929\n10.1038/374327a0\n10.1111/j.0022-202X.2005.23706.x\n10.1529/biophysj.107.125591\n10.1242/jcs.185785\n10.1073/pnas.1701136114\n10.1073/pnas.1420508112\n10.1002/path.4016\n10.1073/pnas.1516811113\n10.1016/j.jid.2017.08.033\n10.1038/nature05109\n10.1091/mbc.11.3.1077"}
{"title": "The expression level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 determines the severity of COVID-19: lung and heart tissue as targets.", "abstract": "Researchers have reported some useful information about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies have been performed in order to develop antiviral drugs, from which a few have been prescribed to patients. Also, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19. It has been well-documented that the surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the binding and entry of CoV. After entering, the viral RNA interrupts the cell proliferation system to activate self-proliferation. However, having all the information about the outbreakof the SARS-COV-2, it is not still clear which factors determine the severity of lung and heart function impairment induced by COVID-19. A major step in exploring SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is to determine the distribution of ACE2 in different tissues . In this review, the structure and origin of CoV, the role of ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-COV-2 on the surface of host cells, and the ACE2 distribution in different tissues with a focus on lung and cardiovascular system have been discussed.

This process mimics central aspects of cardiac remodeling, as it occurs subsequent to myocardial infarction. However, expression of swiprosin-1 in cardiac tissue and its regulation in vivo has not yet been addressed. The expression of swiprosin-1 was analyzed in mice, rat, and pig hearts undergoing myocardial infarction or ischemia/reperfusion with or without cardiac protection by ischemic pre- and postconditioning. In mouse hearts, swiprosin-1 protein expression was increased after 4 and 7 days in myocardial infarct areas specifically in cardiomyocytes as verified by immunoblotting and histology. In rat hearts, swiprosin-1 mRNA expression was induced within 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion but this induction was abrogated by conditioning. As in cultured cardiomyocytes, the expression of swiprosin-1 was associated with a coinduction of arrestin-2, suggesting a common mechanism of regulation. Rno-miR-32-3p and rno-miR-34c-3p were associated with the regulation pattern of both molecules. Moreover, induction of swiprosin-1 and ssc-miR-34c was also confirmed in the infarct zone of pigs.

{"title": "Stimulating pro-reparative immune responses to prevent adverse cardiac remodelling: consensus document from the joint 2019 meeting of the ESC Working Groups of cellular biology of the heart and myocardial function.", "abstract": "Cardiac injury may have multiple causes, including ischaemic, non-ischaemic, autoimmune, and infectious triggers. Independent of the underlying pathophysiology, cardiac tissue damage induces an inflammatory response to initiate repair processes. Immune cells are recruited to the heart to remove dead cardiomyocytes, which is essential for cardiac healing. Insufficient clearance of dying cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction (MI) has been shown to promote unfavourable cardiac remodelling, which may result in heart failure (HF). Although immune cells are integral key players of cardiac healing, an unbalanced or unresolved immune reaction aggravates tissue damage that triggers maladaptive remodelling and HF. Neutrophils and macrophages are involved in both, inflammatory as well as reparative processes. Stimulating the resolution of cardiac inflammation seems to be an attractive therapeutic strategy to prevent adverse remodelling. Along with numerous experimental studies, the promising outcomes from recent clinical trials testing canakinumab or colchicine in patients with MI are boosting the interest in novel therapies targeting inflammation in cardiovascular disease patients. The aim of this review is to discuss recent experimental studies that provide new insights into the signalling pathways and local regulators within the cardiac microenvironment promoting the resolution of inflammation and tissue regeneration.

{"title": "Thrombospondin-1 mediates Drp-1 signaling following ischemia reperfusion in the aging heart.", "abstract": "Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury leads to activation of dynamin-related protein (Drp-1), causing mitochondrial fission and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the molecular mechanisms that activate Drp-1 are not known. The purpose of this study was to establish a link between Thbs-1 and fission protein (Drp-1) through Pgc-1\u03b1 following IR in advancing age.\nFemale Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: Young Control, Young\u00a0+\u00a0IR, Old Control, and Old\u00a0+\u00a0IR. Heart function and coronary flow were evaluated at baseline and 72\u00a0hours after IR, hearts were explanted and mitochondrial ROS generation was measured using MitoPY1, as well as protein levels of Thbs-1, Pgc-1\u03b1, and Drp-1.\u202fIn vitro, rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) were treated with siRNA or plasmid for Pgc-1\u03b1 to evaluate Pgc-1\u03b1 effect on Drp-1.\nMitochondrial ROS\u202fgeneration in heart tissue increased in both age groups following IR. Old animals exhibited diastolic dysfunction at baseline; after IR they displayed reduced systolic function and exacerbated diastolic dysfunction compared to young controls. IR increased Thbs-1 and Drp-1 expression in young and old hearts compared to control. siRNA to Pgc-1\u03b1 enhanced levels of Drp-1 in RAECs and increased ROS generation after hypoxia, while Pgc-1\u03b1 plasmid ameliorates Drp-1 expression in the presence of exogenous Thbs-1.\nThese results highlight a novel signaling pathway by which Thbs-1 regulates mitochondrial fission protein (Drp-1) and ROS generation during hypoxia, and presumably, following IR. Inhibiting Thbs-1 immediately after IR may prevent Drp-1-mediated mitochondrial fission and is likely to improve the diastolic function of the heart by reducing ROS-mediated cardiomyocyte damage in the aged population.", "journal": "FASEB bioAdvances", "date": "2020-05-13", "authors": ["Natia QKelm", "Jason EBeare", "Gregory JWeber", "Amanda JLeBlanc"], "doi": "10.1096/fba.2019-00090\n10.3791/59406"}

{"title": "Identification of miRNA signatures associated with radiation-induced late lung injury in mice.", "abstract": "Acute radiation exposure of the thorax can lead to late serious, and even life-threatening, pulmonary and cardiac damage. Sporadic in nature, late complications tend to be difficult to predict, which prompted this investigation into identifying non-invasive, tissue-specific biomarkers for the early detection of late radiation injury. Levels of circulating microRNA (miRNA) were measured in C3H and C57Bl/6 mice after whole thorax irradiation at doses yielding approximately 70% mortality in 120 or 180 days, respectively (LD70/120 or 180). Within the first two weeks after exposure, weight gain slowed compared to sham treated mice along with a temporary drop in white blood cell counts. 52% of C3H (33 of 64) and 72% of C57Bl/6 (46 of 64) irradiated mice died due to late radiation injury. Lung and heart damage, as assessed by computed tomography (CT) and histology at 150 (C3H mice) and 180 (C57Bl/6 mice) days, correlated well with the appearance of a local, miRNA signature in the lung and heart tissue of irradiated animals, consistent with inherent differences in the C3H and C57Bl/6 strains in their propensity for developing radiation-induced pneumonitis or fibrosis, respectively. Radiation-induced changes in the circulating miRNA profile were most prominent within the first 30 days after exposure and included miRNA known to regulate inflammation and fibrosis. Importantly, early changes in plasma miRNA expression predicted survival with reasonable accuracy (88-92%). The miRNA signature that predicted survival in C3H mice, including miR-34a-5p, -100-5p, and -150-5p, were associated with pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling pathways, whereas the signature identified in C57Bl/6 mice (miR-34b-3p, -96-5p, and -802-5p) was associated with TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling.

{"title": "Genome Sequencing of SAV3 Reveals Repeated Seeding Events of Viral Strains in Norwegian Aquaculture.", "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of pathogen transfer in aquaculture systems is essential to manage and mitigate disease outbreaks. The goal of this study was to understand recent transmission dynamics of salmonid alphavirus (SAV) in Norway. SAV causes significant economic impacts on farmed salmonids in European aquaculture. SAV is classified into six subtypes, with Norway having ongoing epidemics of SAV subtypes 2 and 3. These two viral subtypes are present in largely distinct geographic regions of Norway, with SAV2 present in Trondelag, SAV3 in Rogaland, Sogn og Fjordane, and Hordaland, and M\u00f8re og Romsdal having outbreaks of both subtypes. To determine likely transmission routes of Norwegian SAV an established Nanopore amplicon sequencing approach was used in the current study. After confirming the accuracy of this approach for distinguishing subtype level co-infections of SAV2 and SAV3, a hypothetical possibility in regions of neighboring epidemics, twenty-four SAV3 genomes were sequenced to characterize the current genetic diversity of SAV3 in Norwegian aquaculture. Sequencing was performed on naturally infected heart tissues originating from a range of geographic locations sampled between 2016 and 2019. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the currently active SAV3 strains sampled comprise several distinct lineages sharing an ancestor that existed \u223c15 years ago (95% HPD, 12.51-17.7 years) and likely in Hordaland. At least five of these lineages have not shared a common ancestor for 7.85 years (95% HPD, 5.39-10.96 years) or more. Furthermore, the ancestor of the strains that were sampled outside of Hordaland (Sogn of Fjordane and Rogaland) existed less than 8 years ago, indicating a lack of long-term viral reservoirs in these counties. This evident lack of geographically distinct subclades is compatible with a source-sink transmission dynamic explaining the long-term movements of SAV around Norway. Such anthropogenic transport of the virus indicates that at least for sink counties, biosecurity strategies might be effective in mitigating the ongoing SAV epidemic. Finally, genomic analyses of SAV sequences were performed, offering novel insights into the prevalence of SAV genomes containing defective deletions.

Aim of this study was to investigate the effect of metformin on gap junction and the inducibility of AF.\nBeagle dogs were subjected to acute or chronic pacing at right atrial appendage by a pacemaker to develop an AF model and electrophysiological parameters were measured. In vitro study, a cell fast pacing model was developed by CardioExcyte 96. We performed Western blot, histology immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy to detect the effect of metformin.\nIn chronic AF model, the inducibility and duration of AF increased obviously after pacing for 6\u202fweeks compared with sham-operated group (Inducibility, 3.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.77 vs. 85.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.89%, P<0.0001; Duration, 0.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.84 vs. 11\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.67\u202fms, P<0.0001). Effective refractory periods (ERP) decreased at left and right left atrium and atrial appendages compared with sham-operated group (123.95\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.57 vs. 89.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.39\u202fms P<0.0001). Metformin attenuated the pacing-induced increase in EPR (89.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.39 vs. 105.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.45\u202fms, P<0.05), AF inducibility and AF duration (Inducibility, 85.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.89 vs. 64.17\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.36%, Duration, 11\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.67 vs. 8.62\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15\u202fms, P<0.05). The expression of Cx43 shows a significant downregulation(about 38%, P<0.001) after chronic pacing and treating with metformin could alleviate this decrease(P<0.01). However, the effect of metformin in acute pacing model is limited. The immunohistochemical staining of cardiac tissue also shown that there is more lateralized Cx43 under pacing condition (87.67\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.52 vs. 60.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.13%, P<0.005).

A gene therapy approach leading to increased expression levels of the protein directly in the heart could potentially lead to restoration of contractile function and improve overall cell survival. S100A1 is a relatively small soluble protein that is extremely well conserved across species with only a single amino acid difference between the sequences in human and pig, a commonly used pre-clinical model for evaluation of efficacy, biodistribution and safety for cardiac-directed gene therapy approaches. This high homology presents a bioanalytical challenge for the accurate detection and quantitation of both endogenous (pig) and exogenous (human) transduced S100A1 proteins post treatment using a human S100A1 gene therapy in pigs. Here we present a sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS approach that can easily differentiate and simultaneously quantitate both human and pig S100A1 proteins.

Methods Rat models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury were established. The rats were divided into sham operation group (wild-type healthy rats), wild-type I/R group (wild-type healthy rats treated with myocardial I/R), and I/R group (PTEN KO rats treated with myocardial I/R). PTEN mRNA level was detected by reverse transcription PCR, and myocardial pathological damage was observed by HE staining. Heart rate (HR) and left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) were measured by echocardiography, and left ventricular systolic blood pressure (LVSP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and fraction shortening (FS) were recorded by BL-420F bioassay system. Serum creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), myoglobin (Mb) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were detected by ELISA. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression of NLRP3, embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like 1 (ELAVL1), caspase-1 (caspase-1), and IL-1\u03b2 in heart tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the content of caspase-1 in cardiac tissues. Apoptosis of myocardial tissue was observed with TUNEL staining. Results Compared with the sham operation group, PTEN mRNA and protein levels in the wild-type I/R group significantly increased, HR, LVSP, LVEF, FS, and LVWT went down significantly, and serum CK-MB, Mb, and cTnI levels significantly increased, and NLRP3, ELAVL1, caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2 protein expression levels went up significantly. After PTEN was knocked out, PTEN mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced, the pathological damage of cardiomyocytes was alleviated, and HR, LVSP, LVEF, FS, and LVWT were significantly elevated, and serum CK-MB, Mb, and cTnI levels were significantly inhibited. NLRP3, ELAVL1, caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2 protein levels and the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes were significantly reduced after PTEN knockout.

{"title": "Integrative Cluster Analysis of Whole Hearts Reveals Proliferative Cardiomyocytes in Adult Mice.", "abstract": "The recent development and broad application of sequencing techniques at the single-cell level is generating an unprecedented amount of data. The different techniques have their individual limits, but the datasets also offer unexpected possibilities when utilized collectively. Here, we applied snRNA-seq in whole adult murine hearts from an inbred (C57BL/6NRj) and an outbred (Fzt:DU) mouse strain to directly compare the data with the publicly available scRNA-seq data of the tabula muris project. Explicitly choosing a single-nucleus approach allowed us to pin down the typical heart tissue-specific technical bias, coming up with novel insights on the mammalian heart cell composition. For our integrated dataset, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells constituted the three main cell populations accounting for about 75% of all cells. However, their numbers severely differed between the individual datasets, with cardiomyocyte proportions ranging from about 9% in the tabula muris data to around 23% for our BL6 data, representing the prime example for cell capture technique related bias when using a conventional single-cell approach for these large cells. Most strikingly in our comparison was the discovery of a minor population of cardiomyocytes characterized by proliferation markers that could not be identified by analyzing the datasets individually. It is now widely accepted that the heart has an, albeit very restricted, regenerative potential. However there is still an ongoing debate where new cardiomyocytes arise from. Our findings support the idea that the renewal of the cardiomyocyte pool is driven by cytokinesis of resident cardiomyocytes rather than differentiation of progenitor cells. We thus provide data that can contribute to an understanding of heart cell regeneration, which is a prerequisite for future applications to enhance the process of heart repair.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2020-05-10", "authors": ["Anne-MarieGalow", "MarkusWolfien", "PaulaM\u00fcller", "MadeleineBartsch", "Ronald MBrunner", "AndreasHoeflich", "OlafWolkenhauer", "RobertDavid", "TomGoldammer"], "doi": "10.3390/cells9051144\n10.1101/gad.316802.118\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.302752\n10.1038/nrm.2017.36\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.57\n10.1038/s41467-017-01342-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030742\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00167\n10.1080/15476286.2016.1201618\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310910\n10.3390/cells9020318\n10.1371/journal.pone.0140831\n10.1038/nature13437\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.04.004\n10.1016/j.immuni.2018.04.015\n10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r31\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309202\n10.1038/s41467-018-06894-8\n10.1038/nmeth.4407\n10.1038/s41598-017-04426-w\n10.1038/s41467-019-10709-9\n10.1038/s41598-020-58327-6\n10.1681/ASN.2018090912\n10.1073/pnas.1319700110\n10.1093/nar/gkw739\n10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.5.H2183\n10.1016/j.devcel.2018.01.021\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.060\n10.1038/s41592-018-0224-7\n10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4\n10.1002/0471250953.bi1114s51\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031\n10.1038/s41592-019-0619-0\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa054\n10.1021/cb900256m\n10.1152/ajpheart.1997.272.1.H220\n10.1371/journal.pone.0209648\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.734160\n10.1093/hmg/ddx418\n10.1007/s11886-017-0826-1\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx343\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024307\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1038/nmeth.2639\n10.1186/s13059-016-0938-8\n10.1101/632216"}

Although biomimetic culture environments have been developed to better approximate in vivo conditions, currently available methods do not permit full recapitulation of the four phases of the cardiac cycle. We have developed a bioreactor which allows EHTs to undergo cyclic loading sequences that mimic in vivo work loops. EHTs cultured under these working conditions exhibited enhanced concentric contractions but similar isometric contractions compared with EHTs cultured isometrically. EHTs that were allowed to shorten cyclically in culture had increased capacity for contractile work when tested acutely. Increased work production was correlated with higher levels of mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial biogenesis; this effect was eliminated when tissues were cyclically shortened in the presence of a myosin ATPase inhibitor. Leveraging our novel in vitro method to precisely apply mechanical loads in culture, we grew EHTs under two loading regimes prescribing the same work output but with different associated afterloads. These groups showed no difference in mitochondrial protein expression. In loading regimes with the same afterload but different work output, tissues subjected to higher work demand exhibited elevated levels of mitochondrial protein. Our findings suggest that regulation of mitochondrial mass in cultured human EHTs is potently modulated by the mechanical work the tissue is permitted to perform in culture, presumably communicated through ATP demand.

Cardiac tissue oxidative stress and antioxidant markers (MDA, GSH, GSH.Px and CAT), TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, NF-\u03baB, COX-2 and Nrf-2 gene expressions, and protein conversion levels of related genes were determined. Data obtained showed that ketamine administration increased MDA (p\u2009<\u20090.001), TNF-\u03b1 (p\u2009<\u20090.01), IL-6 (p\u2009<\u20090.01), COX-2 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and NF-\u03baB (p\u2009<\u20090.001) levels, as well as serum TnI (p\u2009<\u20090.001), CK-MB (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and CK (p\u2009<\u20090.01) levels whereas decreased GSH (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and Nrf-2 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) levels, as well as GSH-Px (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and CAT (p\u2009<\u20090.05) enzyme activities. Oleuropein administration was observed to decrease MDA, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, COX-2, NF-\u03baB, TnI, CK-MB and CK levels close to the control group and to increase GSH levels and GSH-Px and CAT enzyme activities close to the control group.

The exploration of novel and sensitive biomarkers to detect damaging effect of fine particulate matter on cardiac tissues is of great importance in the better understanding of haze-caused myocardial injury. A link between heart failure and PPAR\u03b1-regulated energy metabolism has been confirmed previously. Herein, the study intends to reveal the critical biomarkers of fine particulate matter induced myocardial damage from the PPAR\u03b1-regulated energy metabolism. Ambient fine particulate matter induced severe pathological alterations in cultured cells, accompanied by the decrease in ATP content. Additionally, the expressions of CPT1/CPT2 and levels of CS and MDH, crucial members in \u03b2-oxidation and the TCA cycle, were significantly decreased. In direct contrast, fine particulate matter increased the biomarkers of glycolysis, as measured by the accumulation of pyruvate and lactate contents, and the enhanced activities of HK and PKM1/2. Importantly, fine particulate matter-exposed cardiomyocytes exhibited the reduced PPAR\u03b1 level, that increased when cardiomyocytes were co-incubation with WY-14643 and fine particulate matter. Simultaneously, the adverse impact of fine particulate matter on critical biomarkers were observed in \u03b2-oxidation, TCA cycle and glycolysis, associated with WY-14643 additional complement. Fine particulate matter caused the myocardial energy metabolism transformation through the regulation of PPAR\u03b1 expression and translation, which provided novel and critical biomarkers for haze particles-caused myocardial damage.", "journal": "Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)", "date": "2020-05-08", "authors": ["ZeZhang", "HuilanSu", "Rifat ZubairAhmed", "YuxinZheng", "XiaotingJin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114659"}

Dexmedetomidine (Dex), a \u03b12\u2011adrenergic receptor (\u03b12\u2011AR) agonist exerts cardioprotective effects against septic heart dysfunction, but the exact mechanism is unknown. In the present study, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in male C57BL/6 mice. Dex and yohimbine hydrochloride (YOH), an \u03b12\u2011AR inhibitor, were administered before inducing CLP. Then, 24\u00a0h after CLP, serum and heart tissue were collected to detect changes of troponin\u2011I (TN\u2011I), interleukin 6 (IL\u20116), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonaldehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, and iron release. Ferroptosis\u2011targeting proteins, apoptosis and inflammatory factors were assessed by western blotting or ELISA. It was found that, 24\u00a0h after CLP, TN\u2011I, a biomarker of myocardial injury, was significantly increased compared with the control group. Furthermore, the levels of MDA, 8\u2011hydroxy\u20112'\u2011deoxyguanosine and the inflammatory factors IL\u20116 and monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20111 were also significantly increased. It was demonstrated that treatment with Dex reverted or attenuated these changes (CLP + Dex vs. CLP; P<0.05), but these protective effects of Dex were reversed by YOH. Moreover, CLP significantly decreased the protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), SOD and GSH. However, CLP increased expression levels of heme oxygenase\u20111 (HO\u20111), transferrin receptor, cleaved caspase 3, inducible nitric oxide synthase and gasdermin D, and iron concentrations. It was found that Dex reversed these changes, but YOH abrogated the protective effects of Dex (CLP + Dex + YOH vs. CLP + Dex; P<0.05). Therefore, the present results suggested that the attenuation of sepsis\u2011induced HO\u20111 overexpression and iron concentration, and the reduction of ferroptosis via enhancing GPX4, may be the major mechanisms via which Dex alleviates sepsis\u2011induced myocardial cellular injury.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2020-05-08", "authors": ["ChunyanWang", "WenlinYuan", "AnminHu", "JuanLin", "ZhengyuanXia", "Catherine FYang", "YalanLi", "ZhongjunZhang"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2020.11114\n10.3389/fgene.2020.00007\n10.1146/annurev.me.40.020189.002345\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182783b72\n10.1097/01.CCM.0000128579.84228.2A\n10.1046/j.1365-2044.1999.01114.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000936\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00050-3\n10.1073/pnas.1821022116\n10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.011\n10.1038/cdd.2015.158\n10.1038/s41422-018-0090-y\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042\n10.1038/nchembio.1416\n10.1152/ajpheart.00452.2017\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2019.03.002\n10.3892/ijmm.2017.2979\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.311832\n10.18632/oncotarget.5162\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.05.009\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.05.001\n10.1007/s00011-013-0604-5\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.04.150\n10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01527.x\n10.1007/s002460010046\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.10.004\n10.1155/2017/5985209\n10.1016/j.cca.2017.10.031\n10.1016/j.intimp.2019.05.027\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00012\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.058\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310266\n10.1007/s12035-016-0218-3\n10.1152/physrev.00018.2001\n10.1093/bja/60.1.98\n10.2174/138945009788982423\n10.3892/mmr.2016.6012\n10.1016/j.taap.2018.12.017\n10.3109/10715760903513025\n10.1038/cdd.2017.149\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.01.018\n10.1007/s11906-012-0304-5\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.224915\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2014.02.006\n10.18632/aging.101831\n10.1007/s10753-018-0894-4\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.05.126\n10.1155/2018/5702103\n10.1177/0963689718766323\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.03.007\n10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3553\n10.1371/journal.pone.0068949\n10.1007/s11064-019-02731-6\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.2011.01382.x"}

The aim of this study was to validate a previous proteomics discovery programme that identified Tetranectin as a potential HF biomarker candidate based on expression level changes in asymptomatic patients at future risk for HF development. The initial study consisted of 132 patients, comprising of HF (n\u2009=\u200940), no-HF controls (n\u2009=\u200960), and cardiac surgery patients (n\u2009=\u200932). Serum samples were quantified for circulating levels of Tetranectin and a panel of circulating fibro-inflammatory markers. Cardiac tissue served as a resource to investigate the relationship between cardiac Tetranectin levels and fibrosis and inflammation within the myocardium. An independent cohort of 224 patients with or without HF was used to validate serum Tetranectin levels. Results show that circulating Tetranectin levels are significantly reduced in HF patients (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and are associated with HF more closely than B-type natriuretic peptide (AUC\u2009=\u20090.97 versus 0.84, p\u2009=\u20090.011).

The greater part of these cases is represented by myocardial infarction (MI), or heart attack as it is better known, which occurs when declining blood flow to the heart causes injury to cardiac tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that represent a promising vector for cell therapies that aim to treat MI due to their potent regenerative effects. However, it remains unclear the extent to which MSC-based therapies are able to induce regeneration in the heart and even less clear the degree to which clinical outcomes could be improved. Exosomes, which are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) known to have implications in intracellular communication, derived from MSCs (MSC-Exos), have recently emerged as a novel cell-free vector that is capable of conferring cardio-protection and regeneration in target cardiac cells. In this review, we assess the current state of research of MSC-Exos in the context of MI.

This process mimics aspects of cardiac adaptation to pressure overload and requires an initial breakdown of sarcomeric structures. The present study therefore aimed to identify key steps in this remodeling process. ARVC were cultured under serum-free or serum-supplemented conditions and their sizes and shapes were analyzed as well as apoptosis and the ability to disintegrate their sarcomeres. ARVC require serum-factors in order to adapt to cell culture conditions. More ARVC survived if they were able to breakdown their sarcomeres and mononucleated ARVC, which were smaller than binucleated ARVC, had a better chance to adapt. During the early phase of adaptation, proteasome subunit low molecular weight protein (LMP)-2 was induced. Inhibition of LMP-2 up-regulation by siRNA attenuated the process of successful adaptation. In vivo, LMP-2 was induced in the left ventricle of spontaneously hypertensive rats during the early phase of adaptation to pressure overload. In conclusion, the data suggest that breakdown of pre-existing sarcomeres is optimized by induction of LMP-2 and that it is required for cardiac remodeling processes, for example, occurring during pressure overload.", "journal": "Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-05-07", "authors": ["AntoniaPetersen", "Hanna SarahKutsche", "FranziskaNippert", "RolfSchreckenberg", "RainerSchulz", "Klaus-DieterSchl\u00fcter"], "doi": "10.3390/medsci8020021\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012559\n10.1371/journal.pone.0167655\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.08.013\n10.1016/j.drudis.2013.10.019\n10.1007/BF00232149\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1016/S0022-2828(85)80049-3\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.808071\n10.1161/01.RES.58.1.137\n10.1016/0022-2828(92)91839-W\n10.1016/0922-3371(88)90114-1\n10.1002/path.3013\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.09.007\n10.1007/s00395-019-0744-z\n10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.02.035\n10.1016/0012-1606(88)90408-3\n10.1161/01.RES.64.3.493\n10.1161/01.RES.69.1.86\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.09.009\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.050865\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.02.007\n10.4049/jimmunol.1103592\n10.1042/BJ20120820\n10.1007/s00395-018-0696-8\n10.3791/56634\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00556\n10.1007/s00424-008-0520-7\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.04.037\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303595\n10.1007/s00424-005-1476-5\n10.1089/scd.2010.0066\n10.1016/j.febslet.2008.02.050\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306783\n10.1161/JAHA.117.006182\n10.1155/2015/464195\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307644\n10.1172/JCI45709\n10.1113/JP273607\n10.1007/s00018-012-0938-0\n10.1016/0022-2828(91)90216-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000051865.66123.B7\n10.1152/ajpheart.00196.2007\n10.1152/ajpcell.00217.2012"}
{"title": "Sex-specific cardiac remodeling in early and advanced stages of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most frequent genetic cardiac disease with a prevalence of 1:500 to 1:200. While most patients show obstructive HCM and a relatively stable clinical phenotype (stage II), a small group of patients progresses to end-stage HCM (stage IV) within a relatively brief period. Previous research has shown sex-differences in stage II HCM with more diastolic dysfunction in female than in male patients. Moreover, female patients more often show progression to heart failure. Here we investigated if differences in functional and structural properties of the heart may underlie sex-differences in disease progression from stage II to stage IV HCM. Cardiac tissue from stage II and IV patients was obtained during myectomy (n = 54) and heart transplantation (n = 10), respectively. Isometric force was measured in membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes to define active and passive myofilament force development. Titin isoform composition was assessed using gel electrophoresis, and the amount of fibrosis and capillary density were determined with histology. In accordance with disease stage-dependent adverse cardiac remodeling end-stage patients showed a thinner interventricular septal wall and larger left ventricular and atrial diameters compared to stage II patients. Cardiomyocyte contractile properties and fibrosis were comparable between stage II and IV, while capillary density was significantly lower in stage IV compared to stage II. Women showed more adverse cellular remodeling compared to men at stage II, evident from more compliant titin, more fibrosis and lower capillary density. However, the disease stage-dependent reduction in capillary density was largest in men. In conclusion, the more severe cellular remodeling in female compared to male stage II patients suggests a more advanced disease stage at the time of myectomy in women.

Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in heart development and several CHDs, their role in TOF is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate how dysregulated lncRNAs contribute to TOF. Using Gene Expression Omnibus data mining, bioinformatics analysis and clinical heart tissue sample detecting, we identified a novel antisense lncRNA TBX5-AS1:2 with unknown function that was significantly down-regulated in injured cardiac tissues from TOF patients. LncRNA TBX5-AS1:2 was mainly located in the nucleus of the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293T) cells and formed an RNA-RNA double-stranded structure in the overlapping region with its sense mRNA T-box transcription factor\u00a05 (TBX5), which is an important regulator in heart development. Knock-down of lncRNA TBX5-AS1:2 via promoter hypermethylation reduced TBX5 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels by affecting its mRNA stability through RNA-RNA interaction. Moreover, lncRNA TBX5-AS1:2 knock-down inhibited the proliferation of HEK293T cells.

Angiogenesis is essential for repair and regeneration in cardiac tissue after MI. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of exosomes derived from the serum of MI patients in angiogenesis and its related mechanism.\nExosomes, isolated from serum, were collected from MI (MI-exosome) and control (Con-exosome) patients. After coculturing with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, MI-exosome promoted cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation.\nThe results revealed that the production and release of MI-exosome were associated with cardiomyocytes. Moreover, microarray assays demonstrated that miRNA-143 was significantly decreased in MI-exosome. Meanwhile, the overexpression and knockdown of miRNA-143 could inhibit and enhance angiogenesis, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of exosomal miRNA-143 on angiogenesis was mediated by its targeting gene, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR), and was associated with the production of nitric oxide (NO).\nTaken together, exosomes derived from the serum of patients with MI promoted angiogenesis through the IGF-IR/NO signaling pathway.

In the PEDOT/Alg scaffold, chemically crosslinked alginate networks are formed using adipic acid hydrazide as the crosslinker, and PEDOT is synthesized in situ in the alginate matrix simultaneously. PEDOT exists in the alginate matrix as particles and its morphology can be modulated by adjusting the ratio of PEDOT/alginate. The results also show that the swelling properties, degradation behaviors, mechanical strength and conductivity of the PEDOT/Alg scaffold can be controlled via adjusting the PEDOT/alginate ratio.

One class of sRNAs, termed trans-acting sRNAs, can affect the stability and/or the translational efficiency of regulated transcripts. In this study, we utilized a collaborative approach that employed data from infection with the Borrelia burgdorferi Tn library, coupled with Tn-seq, together with borrelial sRNA and total RNA transcriptomes, to identify an intergenic trans-acting sRNA, which we designate here as ittA for infectivity-associated and tissue-tropic sRNA locus A. The genetic inactivation of ittA resulted in a significant attenuation in infectivity, with decreased spirochetal load in ear, heart, skin and joint tissues. In addition, the ittA mutant did not disseminate to peripheral skin sites or heart tissue, suggesting a role for ittA in regulating a tissue-tropic response. RNA-Seq analysis determined that 19 transcripts were differentially expressed in the ittA mutant relative to its genetic parent, including vraA, bba66, ospD and oms28 (bba74).

{"title": "Proteomic and metabolomic characterization of cardiac tissue in acute myocardial ischemia injury rats.", "abstract": "The pathological process and mechanism of myocardial ischemia (MI) is very complicated, and remains unclear. An integrated proteomic-metabolomics analysis was applied to comprehensively understand the pathological changes and mechanism of MI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a mock surgery (MS) group and an MI group. The MI model was made by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery, twenty-four hours after which, echocardiography was employed to assess left ventricular (LV) function variables. Blood samples and left ventricular tissues were collected for ELISA, metabolomics and proteomics analysis. The results showed that LV function, including ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), was significantly reduced and the level of cTnT in the serum increased after MI. iTRAQ proteomics showed that a total of 169 proteins were altered including 52 and 117 proteins with increased and decreased expression, respectively, which were mainly involved in the following activities: complement and coagulation cascades, tight junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, MAPK signaling pathway, endocytosis, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, as well as phagosome coupled with vitamin digestion and absorption. Altered metabolomic profiling of this transition was mostly enriched in pathways including ABC transporters, glycerophospholipid metabolism, protein digestion and absorption and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. The integrated metabolomics and proteomics analysis indicated that myocardial injury after MI is closely related to several metabolic pathways, especially energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, vascular smooth muscle contraction, gap junction and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction.

{"title": "Targeted Delivery of Recombinant Heat Shock Protein 27 to Cardiomyocytes Promotes Recovery from Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease, especially myocardial infarction (MI), is the leading cause of death worldwide. Apoptotic mechanisms are thought to play a significant role in cardiomyocyte death after MI. Increased production of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in cardiomyocytes is a normal response to promote tolerance and to reduce cell damage. Hsp27 is considered to be a therapeutic option for the treatment of ischemic heart disease due to its protective effects on hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Despite its antiapoptotic effects, the lack of strategies to deliver Hsp27 to the heart tissue in vivo limits its clinical applicability. In this study, we utilized an antibody against the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, which is expressed immediately after ischemia/reperfusion in the heart of MI rats. To achieve cardiomyocyte-targeted Hsp27 delivery after ischemia/reperfusion, we employed the immunoglobulin-binding dimer ZZ, a modified domain of protein A, in conjunction with the AT1 receptor antibody. Using the AT1 receptor antibody, we achieved systemic delivery of ZZ-TAT-GFP fusion protein into the heart of MI rats. This approach enabled selective delivery of Hsp27 to cardiomyocytes, rescued cells from apoptosis, reduced the area of fibrosis, and improved cardiac function in the rat MI model, thus suggesting its applicability as a cardiomyocyte-targeted protein delivery system to inhibit apoptosis induced by ischemic injury.", "journal": "Molecular pharmaceutics", "date": "2020-05-05", "authors": ["NahyeonKim", "IrfanUllah", "KunhoChung", "DahyeLee", "Min-JiCha", "HongseokBan", "Chang SeonChoi", "SunghwaKim", "Ki-ChulHwang", "PritiKumar", "Sang-KyungLee"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.0c00192"}

We show increased MD2 in heart tissues of diabetic mice and serum of human diabetic subjects. MD2 deficiency in mice inhibits TLR4 pathway activation, which correlates with reduced myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac function. Mechanistically, we show that HG induces extracellular advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which bind directly to MD2, leading to formation of AGEs-MD2-TLR4 complex and initiation of pro-inflammatory pathways. We further detect elevated AGE-MD2 complexes in heart tissues and serum of diabetic mice and human subjects with DCM.

As treatment therapies have emerged for transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), so has interest in using biomarkers to identify disease prior to advanced presentation.\nLower levels of transthyretin and retinol binding protein-4 have been demonstrated in patients with pathogenic mutations of transthyretin either with or without clinical disease. Levels associate with the severity of mutations as well as response to treatment with transthyretin stabilizers or small interfering RNA molecules which silence transthyretin production. Transthyretin stability is the rate limiting step of amyloid fibril formation and directly measuring transthyretin kinetic stability has the potential to identify patients as risk as well as therapeutic response to treatment regardless of pathogenic or wild-type genetics. In addition, non-antibody protein-based peptide probes have been developed that directedly measure misfolded transthyretin oligomers due to transthyretin breakdown.

However, the effect of G.\u00a0acuta on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not clear. To explore the mechanisms of G.\u00a0acuta on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced AMI, rats were administered G.\u00a0acuta for 28\u00a0days, then injected intraperitoneally with ISO (85\u00a0mg/kg) on days 29 and 30. An electrocardiogram helped to evaluate the myocardial injury. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were evaluated, and haematoxylin eosin, Masson's trichrome staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining were used to detect myocardial histological changes. Radioimmunoassay was used to measure serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-6. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to analyse serum galectin-3 (Gal-3) levels. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to examine relevant molecular events. The results revealed that pre-treatment with G.\u00a0acuta decreased the elevation in the ST segment; reduced serum LDH, CK and AST levels; alleviated cardiac structure disorder; and reduced inflammatory infiltration, abnormal collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte apoptosis that were induced by ISO. Furthermore, pre-treatment with G.\u00a0acuta inhibited serum Gal-3 levels and Gal-3 expression in heart tissue, and also impeded TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u043aB signalling activation, which ultimately prevented the expression of inflammatory cytokines.

{"title": "A high-throughput and untargeted lipidomics approach reveals new mechanistic insight and the effects of salvianolic acid B on the metabolic profiles in coronary heart disease rats using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.", "abstract": "High-throughput lipidomics provides the possibility for the development of new therapeutic drugs. Accordingly, herein, we reveal the protective role of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) in rats with coronary heart disease (CHD) and propose a new mechanism for its action through a high-throughput and non-targeted lipidomics strategy. A CHD animal model was induced by consecutive high-fat diet feeding with vitamin D3 injection. At the end of the 8th week, the serum sample was analyzed to explore the metabolic biomarker and pathway changes using untargeted lipidomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS). In addition, blood and heart tissue samples were collected and processed for the detection of biochemical indicators and liver histological observation. After salvianolic acid B treatment, the levels of LDH, CK, CK-MB, MYO, CTn1, TG, TC, LDL-c, and Apo(b) were significantly lower than that in the model group, while the levels of HDL-c and Apo(a1) were significantly higher than that in the model group. Furthermore, the histological features of fibrosis and steatosis were also evidently relieved in the model group. A total of twenty-six potential biomarkers were identified to express the lipid metabolic turbulence in the CHD animal models, of which twenty-two were regulated by salvianolic acid B trending to the normal state, including TG(20:0/20:4/o-18:0), PC(20:4/18:1(9Z)), PC(18:3/20:2), PA(18:0/18:2), LysoPE(18:2/0:0), SM(d18:0/22:1), PE(22:6/0:0), LysoPE (20:4/0:0), sphinganine, Cer(d18:0/18:0), PS(14:0/14:1), PC (18:0/16:0), LysoPC(17:0), PE(22:2/20:1), PC(20:3/20:4), PE(20:4/P-16:0), PS(20:3/18:0), cholesterol sulfate, TG(15:0/22:6/18:1), prostaglandin E2, arachidonic acid and sphingosine-1-phosphate. According to the metabolite enrichment and pathway analyses, the pharmacological activity of salvianolic acid B on CHD is mainly involved in three vital metabolic pathways including glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. Thus, based on the lipidomics-guided biochemical analysis of the lipid biomarkers and pathways, Sal B protects against CHD with good therapeutic effect by regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism, inhibiting oxidative stress damage and lipid peroxidation.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2020-05-01", "authors": ["Ying-PengLi", "Cong-YingWang", "Hong-TaoShang", "Rui-RuiHu", "HuiFu", "Xue-FengXiao"], "doi": "10.1039/d0ra00049c\n10.1371/journal.pone.0211726\n10.1016/j.ihj.2019.01.002\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.04.083\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309443\n10.1016/j.gheart.2015.11.003\n10.4103/pm.pm_329_19\n10.3390/ijms20225653\n10.1016/j.phymed.2018.12.040\n10.21010/ajtcam.v13i4.20\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.02.015\n10.1080/08830185.2019.1645138\n10.1038/srep28031\n10.1039/C9RA07621B\n10.1002/jcp.25191\n10.1039/C9RA09305B\n10.1038/s41598-018-25397-6\n10.1007/s00216-018-0863-7\n10.1016/j.humimm.2014.10.006\n10.1097/MD.0000000000006094\n10.1093/ije/dyz068\n10.1002/1873-3468.13563\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1315\n10.1038/srep35037\n10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2014.07.001\n10.1007/s11239-019-01889-8\n10.1038/s41598-018-37373-1\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2019.08.003\n10.1093/jn/nxz259\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.07.004\n10.1055/s-0042-107046\n10.1016/j.lfs.2011.07.025\n10.1007/s13105-015-0415-y\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61124-2\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.019475\n10.5551/jat.52407\n10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.06.032\n10.1039/C7RA09353E\n10.1039/C7RA07873K\n10.1039/C8RA06190D\n10.1074/mcp.M112.019141\n10.1039/C5RA09589A"}

The present study follows a comparative approach to analyse complex I in heart tissue from 8 mammalian species with a longevity ranging from 3.5 to 46 years. Gene expression and protein content of selected Cx I subunits were analysed using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and western blot, respectively. Our results demonstrate: 1) the existence of species-specific differences in gene expression and protein content of Cx I in relation to longevity; 2) the achievement of a longevity phenotype is associated with low protein abundance of subunits NDUFV2 and NDUFS4 from the matrix hydrophilic domain of Cx I; and 3) long-lived mammals show also lower levels of VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) amount. These differences could be associated with the lower mitochondrial ROS production and slower aging rate of long-lived animals and, unexpectedly, with a low content of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in these species.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2020-05-01", "authors": ["NataliaMota-Martorell", "MarionaJove", "IrenePradas", "IsabelSanchez", "Jos\u00e9G\u00f3mez", "AlbaNaudi", "GustavoBarja", "ReinaldPamplona"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2020.101539\n10.1089/ars.2009.2743\n10.1074/jbc.R117.789271\n10.1016/j.arr.2007.06.002\n10.1089/ars.2012.5148\n10.1016/0891-5849(93)90165-q\n10.1016/S0047-6374(97)00076-6\n10.1016/S0047-6374(98)00035-9\n10.1023/a:1020592719405\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2006.01.009\n10.1038/ncomms4837\n10.1023/a:1005626712319\n10.1016/S0014-5793(01)02850-2\n10.1042/bj20021121\n10.1007/s11357-005-4562-x\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00538.x\n10.1096/fj.05-5568com\n10.1007/s10522-007-9099-1\n10.1093/gerona/62.4.352\n10.1007/s10863-011-9389-9\n10.1038/nature19794\n10.1038/nature19095\n10.1016/j.tcb.2018.06.006\n10.1111/acel.12793\n10.1016/0003-9861(79)90372-2\n10.1111/acel.12650\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.02.021\n10.1007/s10863-016-9652-1\n10.1038/s41467-019-13766-2\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.013\n10.1038/s41564-018-0156-0\n10.1093/molbev/msu141\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1007272\n10.1073/pnas.0912613107\n10.1093/molbev/msy105\n10.1111/acel.12577\n10.1038/nature13686\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2016.02.013\n10.1016/j.exger.2016.08.002\n10.1007/s10863-015-9608-x\n10.1096/fj.15-272666\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.08.015\n10.1074/jbc.C112.436766\n10.1038/46972\n10.1126/science.1123809\n10.1038/nrm3997\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.02.036\n10.1038/nature19754\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.3257\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2008.04.005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.08.022\n10.1089/ars.2012.4845\n10.1073/pnas.1613701113\n10.1152/physrev.00024.2007\n10.1038/s41598-017-10673-8\n10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00758.x\n10.1111/acel.12527\n10.1111/bph.14544\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.005\n10.1038/s41598-017-00037-7\n10.1016/j.febslet.2009.10.036\n10.1074/mcp.M400055-MCP200\n10.1093/gbe/evt093\n10.1111/2041-210X.12533\n10.1002/ece3.2961\n10.1098/rsbl.2018.0860\n10.1016/j.mad.2015.03.004\n10.1038/srep03346\n10.1038/s41598-019-54447-w\n10.1093/nar/gki425\n10.1002/cpbi.86\n10.1093/molbev/msx116"}
{"title": "Association with SERCA2a directs phospholamban trafficking to sarcoplasmic reticulum from a nuclear envelope pool.", "abstract": "Phospholamban (PLB) stoichiometrically regulates the cardiac Ca\nHighly specific monoclonal antibodies were used to compare the subcellular distributions of SERCA2a, PLB, and junctin (JCN) in dog heart tissue. The data supported a view that both non-junctional and junctional SR proteins are all prominently enriched in transverse stretches of SR tubules, along the edges of sarcomeres (SR z-tubules). To understand the genesis of these steady state distributions, we analyzed confocal immunofluorescence images of adult rat CMs after acute expression (12-48\u00a0h) of the dog ortholog of PLB (dPLB) or dSERCA2a. Newly made dog proteins in rat CMs were detected using dog-specific monoclonal antibodies. By 12-24\u00a0h, dSERCA2a had accumulated within the NE in a punctate pattern, presumably reflecting initial sites of biosynthesis. Over the next 24-48\u00a0h, higher levels of dSERCA2a immunofluorescence accumulated in transverse/radial SR tubules, aligned along sarcolemmal transverse (T)-tubules, and extending from NE puncta. The patterns of SR tubules carrying dSERCA2a overlapped with those for newly made JCN, suggesting a common Nuclear Envelope to SR along T-tubules or NEST pathway for SR proteins. In contrast to the SERCA2a distribution pattern, dPLB accumulated uniformly in the NE, without visible puncta. With co-expression of dSERCA2a, however, PLB no longer uniformly filled the NE, but instead moved together with SERCA2a to form bright NE puncta, from which the two proteins then trafficked anterogradely.\nExpression of dog SR protein orthologs (dSERCA2a, dPLB, and dJCN) for as little as 48\u00a0h reproduces their characteristic steady state distributions. Detailed analyses of the time courses of protein accumulation suggest a possible mechanism by which PLB distributes to both the NE and SR, unlike SERCA2a. SERCA2a moves in SR z-tubules directly from rough ER, along pathways that are in common with those used by junctional SR proteins. A different trafficking route for PLB away the rough ER/NE led to its accumulation in the NE, a process that may account for its enrichment in NE in situ. Association of SERCA2a with PLB from this NE pool enhanced PLB trafficking along the NEST pathway, contributing to steady state stoichiometry and physiologically regulated SERCA2a.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2020-05-01", "authors": ["WenboHe", "DayangHuang", "ShuaiGuo", "DanningWang", "JinGuo", "Steven ECala", "ZhenhuiChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.04.025"}

For this purpose, 40 male rats were divided into four groups and were orally treated with saline (control), CLZ (0.5\u00a0mg/kg bw), SPD (28\u00a0mg/kg bw), or a combination of CLZ and SPD (CLZ+SPD), daily for 30 consecutive days. At necropsy, blood samples and specimens from the heart, kidneys, and spleen were collected for biochemical, molecular, and histopathological investigations. The results showed that CLZ administration was associated with significantly lower immune status indices and increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde, cardiac, and renal tissues injury markers. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (Kim-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms were markedly upregulated in CLZ-treated rats, compared to the control group. On the other hand, rats treated with SPD alone showed non-significant differences in terms of immune response indices, tissue injury markers, and mRNA expression levels of Kim-1, TIMP-1, and CYP isoforms. Finally, CLZ+SPD co-treatment significantly modulated almost all biochemical indices. Besides, Kim-1, TIMP-1, and CYP2C19 mRNA expression levels were significantly downregulated, while other CYP isoforms showed no modulation, compared with CLZ-treated group. Histopathologically, CLZ-treated rats showed severe lesions in renal, splenic, and cardiac tissues, compared with control rats, which were restored in CLZ+SPD-co-treated rats.

We then applied both methods to detect mosaicism in cardiac tissue-derived exome sequences of 66 participants for which matched blood and heart tissue was available.\nEM-mosaic detected 326 mosaic mutations in blood and/or cardiac tissue DNA. Of the 309 detected in blood DNA, 85/97 (88%) tested were independently confirmed, while 7/17 (41%) candidates of 17 detected in cardiac tissue were confirmed. MosaicHunter detected an additional 64 mosaics, of which 23/46 (50%) among 58 candidates from blood and 4/6 (67%) of 6 candidates from cardiac tissue confirmed. Twenty-five mosaic variants altered CHD-risk genes, affecting 1% of our cohort. Of these 25, 22/22 candidates tested were confirmed. Variants predicted as damaging had higher variant allele fraction than benign variants, suggesting a role in CHD. The estimated true frequency of mosaic variants above 10% mosaicism was 0.14/person in blood and 0.21/person in cardiac tissue. Analysis of 66 individuals with matched cardiac tissue available revealed both tissue-specific and shared mosaicism, with shared mosaics generally having higher allele fraction.\nWe estimate that ~\u20091% of CHD probands have a mosaic variant detectable in blood that could contribute to cardiac malformations, particularly those damaging variants with relatively higher allele fraction. Although blood is a readily available DNA source, cardiac tissues analyzed contributed ~\u20095% of somatic mosaic variants identified, indicating the value of tissue mosaicism analyses.", "journal": "Genome medicine", "date": "2020-05-01", "authors": ["AlexanderHsieh", "Sarah UMorton", "Jon A LWillcox", "Joshua MGorham", "Angela CTai", "HongjianQi", "StevenDePalma", "DavidMcKean", "EmilyGriffin", "Kathryn BManheimer", "DanielBernstein", "Richard WKim", "Jane WNewburger", "George APorter", "DeepakSrivastava", "MartinTristani-Firouzi", "MartinaBrueckner", "Richard PLifton", "ElizabethGoldmuntz", "Bruce DGelb", "Wendy KChung", "Christine ESeidman", "J GSeidman", "YufengShen"], "doi": "10.1186/s13073-020-00738-1\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.05.008\n10.1038/nature15393\n10.18632/oncotarget.9200\n10.1038/nrg3424\n10.1016/j.diff.2012.05.006\n10.1016/S1534-5807(03)00363-0\n10.1038/nbt.2514\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.235382\n10.1038/ng.806\n10.1002/humu.22691\n10.1002/humu.23255\n10.1164/rccm.201411-1985LE\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2013-101715\n10.1002/ajmg.a.34223\n10.1093/nar/gkw1073\n10.1016/j.neuron.2010.10.006\n10.1038/ng.3292\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1006245\n10.1093/molbev/msi043\n10.1056/NEJMoa1409405\n10.4172/0974-8369.1000414\n10.1038/ncomms9479\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030677\n10.1038/s41467-018-04552-7\n10.1111/j.1399-0004.1986.tb01261.x\n10.1001/archderm.1993.01680320094012\n10.1093/nar/gky1095\n10.1093/nar/gkr1073\n10.1126/science.aac9396\n10.1073/pnas.0915033107\n10.1093/nar/gkx024\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.08.016\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.015\n10.1056/NEJMoa1408617\n10.1056/NEJMoa1314432\n10.1038/ng.3970\n10.1093/nar/gkw971\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.07.016\n10.1093/hmg/4.4.541\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.05.006\n10.1002/jnr.21534\n10.1038/ng.2329\n10.1038/nature19057\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btr509\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu356\n10.1038/nn.4598\n10.1038/ng.2332\n10.1002/humu.22932\n10.1007/s00439-018-1871-6\n10.1101/gr.107524.110\n10.1002/ajmg.a.38695\n10.1136/heart.89.7.806\n10.1186/1471-2091-14-27\n10.1002/gene.10060\n10.1093/nar/gkv1189\n10.1016/j.neuron.2012.03.010\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.07.038\n10.1038/nmeth.2611\n10.1371/journal.pone.0112275\n10.1093/nar/gky1016\n10.1038/ng.2331\n10.1038/nbt.1754\n10.1038/leu.2015.304\n10.1093/nar/gkx1006\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btv685\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.10.035\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010855\n10.1038/gim.2017.114\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005965\n10.1002/ajmg.a.38135\n10.1093/nar/gky1015\n10.1038/ncomms4153\n10.1002/ajmg.a.37942\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2015-103018\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309140\n10.1038/nature12141"}
{"title": "Mechanism of N-acetylcysteine in alleviating diabetic myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury by regulating PTEN/Akt pathway through promoting DJ-1.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease is the main cardiovascular complication of diabetes patients which is mainly caused by oxidative stress. DJ-1 is the key regulator for myocardial protection through inhibiting phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and activating Akt (also known as PKB or protein kinase B). This research is to investigate whether the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could alleviate diabetic myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by the protective molecule DJ-1. DJ-1 in rat myocardial H9c2 cells and cardiac tissue was respectively knocked down by siRNA and adeno-associated virus (AAV). From the present study, it could be found that compared with high glucose (HG)-normal (N)/DM group, hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) or I/R injury can aggravate oxidative stress injury and apoptosis rate of myocardial cells, inhibit the expression of Bcl-2, activate the BAX and cleaved caspase-3 (c-caspase-3) protein and PTEN/Akt pathway. However, in the groups of HG-N, DM, HG-N+I/R and DM+I/R, NAC can significantly reduce oxidative stress injury and apoptosis rate of myocytes, promote the Bcl-2 and DJ-1 molecules, inhibit BAX and c-caspase-3 protein and PTEN/Akt pathway. Compared with HG-N+I/R+NAC and DM+I/R+NAC groups, the oxidative stress injury, apoptosis rate of myocardial cells and heart tissues increased after the knockdown of DJ-1, the expression of Bcl-2 and DJ-1 were inhibited, the BAX and c-caspase-3 expression was increased, and PTEN/Akt pathway was activated. Taken together, the findings suggest that NAC can reduce I/R injury in diabetic myocardium by up-regulating the PTEN/Akt pathway through the level of DJ-1.", "journal": "Bioscience reports", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": ["WenyuanLi", "WeiLi", "YanLeng", "YonghongXiong", "RuiXue", "RongChen", "ZhongyuanXia"], "doi": "10.1042/BSR20192118\n10.1001/jama.298.7.765\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2009.11.010\n10.1016/B978-0-444-53480-4.00015-1\n10.1006/bbrc.1997.6132\n10.1038/sj.embor.7400074\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0020362\n10.1093/hmg/ddi134\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4556\n10.1002/jnr.21831\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040501\n10.1074/jbc.M707176200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009367\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.02.010\n10.3349/ymj.2012.53.2.294\n10.2174/0929867324666170608111917\n10.1186/s12933-016-0460-z\n10.3109/10715762.2015.1100730\n10.1186/s12933-016-0460-z\n10.1155/2013/564902\n10.1007/s00125-014-3171-6\n10.1042/CS20150496\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01073-5\n10.1161/01.CIR.80.5.1115\n10.1159/000097423\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0020362\n10.1016/j.nbd.2006.06.004\n10.1089/152308601750100506\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600553\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0020327\n10.1074/jbc.M507124200\n10.1186/1750-1326-4-12\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.11.017\n10.1371/journal.pone.0138535\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.04.008\n10.1073/pnas.1303444110\n10.1042/CS20170052\n10.1007/s11033-010-0558-4\n10.1007/s00395-008-0735-y\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.03.012\n10.1155/2019/4650906\n10.1007/s000180300001\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.03.003\n10.1073/pnas.90.21.9813\n10.1006/bbrc.1997.7672\n10.3892/ijmm.2016.2680\n10.2147/IJN.S209820"}

Current studies have identified the roles of CPA4 in cancer biology and insulin sensitivity. However, the roles of CPA4 in other diseases are not known. In the present study, we investigated the roles of CPA4 in cardiac hypertrophy. The expression of CPA4 was significantly increased in the hypertrophic heart tissues of human patients and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced hypertrophic heart tissues of mice. We next knocked down Cpa4 with shRNA or overexpressed Cpa4 using adenovirus in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with ISO. We observed that Cpa4 overexpression promoted whereas Cpa4 knockdown reduced ISO-induced growth of cardiomyocyte size and overexpression of hypertrophy marker genes, such as myosin heavy chain \u03b2 (\u03b2-Mhc), atrial natriuretic peptide (Anp), and brain natriuretic peptide (Bnp). Our further mechanism study revealed that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was activated by Cpa4 in cardiomyocytes, which depended on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling. Besides, we showed that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling was critically involved in the roles of Cpa4 during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Collectively, these results demonstrated that CPA4 is a regulator of cardiac hypertrophy by activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, and CPA4 may serve as a promising target for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Bioscience reports", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": ["WeinianGao", "NaGuo", "ShuguangZhao", "ZiyingChen", "WenliZhang", "FangYan", "HongjuanLiao", "KuiChi"], "doi": "10.1042/BSR20200669\n10.3389/fendo.2020.00280\n10.1016/j.phrs.2009.11.012\n10.1042/CS20160685\n10.2174/138161211796390976\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.02.003\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00104\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000057979.36322.88\n10.1073/pnas.0500678102\n10.1002/mc.23095\n10.3390/biom9030103\n10.1080/08977194.2017.1285764\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00356\n10.1038/srep36576\n10.1371/journal.pone.0097999\n10.1007/s11427-014-4687-1\n10.1007/s11427-016-0131-4\n10.1111/iep.12315\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.07.028\n10.3892/ijo.2011.1290\n10.1016/j.tibs.2011.03.006\n10.4236/ajmb.2014.43015"}

{"title": "PGC-1\u03b1 activator ZLN005 promotes maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have great potential in biomedical applications. However, the immature state of cardiomyocytes obtained using existing protocols limits the application of hPSC-CMs. Unlike adult cardiac myocytes, hPSC-CMs generate ATP through an immature metabolic pathway-aerobic glycolysis, instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Hence, metabolic switching is critical for functional maturation in hPSC-CMs. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism, which may help promote cardiac maturation during development. In this study, we investigated the effects of PGC-1\u03b1 and its activator ZLN005 on the maturation of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hESC-CM). hESC-CMs were generated using a chemically defined differentiation protocol and supplemented with either ZLN005 or DMSO (control) on differentiating days 10 to 12. Biological assays were then performed around day 30. ZLN005 treatment upregulated the expressions of PGC-1\u03b1 and mitochondrial function-related genes in hESC-CMs and induced more mature energy metabolism compared with the control group. In addition, ZLN005 treatment increased cell sarcomere length, improved cell calcium handling, and enhanced intercellular connectivity. These findings support an effective approach to promote hESC-CM maturation, which is critical for the application of hESC-CM in disease modeling, drug screening, and engineering cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Aging", "date": "2020-04-29", "authors": ["YanpingLiu", "HuajunBai", "FengfengGuo", "Phung NThai", "XiaolingLuo", "PengZhang", "ChunliYang", "XueqinFeng", "DanZhu", "JunGuo", "PingLiang", "ZhiceXu", "HuangtianYang", "XiyuanLu"], "doi": "10.18632/aging.103088\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.10.014\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000350\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.085\n10.1016/j.scr.2013.12.004\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.11.011\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00959\n10.1002/stem.1331\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.7150/thno.19390\n10.1038/s41598-017-08713-4\n10.1155/2017/5153625\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1113/JP276754\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e74a14\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00050\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313249\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.039\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01417.x\n10.14348/molcells.2018.0143\n10.1038/ncpcardio0766\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302095\n10.1002/bit.26504\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223818\n10.1016/j.ceb.2014.11.002\n10.7150/thno.29130\n10.1097/MOL.0b013e328328d0a4\n10.3945/ajcn.110.001917\n10.1016/j.tem.2012.06.006\n10.1113/JP272847\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.03.052\n10.1210/er.2006-0037\n10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.013\n10.3389/fnmol.2017.00443\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.03.009\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.09289\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2016.05.012\n10.1155/2018/9248640\n10.1002/rcm.8060\n10.1007/s10571-017-0567-0\n10.2337/db12-0703\n10.1016/j.mito.2008.02.001\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.11.008\n10.1016/j.cmet.2016.03.005\n10.1038/nrm.2017.95\n10.1002/cbin.10915\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.011\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.12.014\n10.1172/JCI10268\n10.1155/2008/253817\n10.1186/scrt406\n10.1016/S0167-4781(02)00343-3\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.089\n10.3390/ijms19061691\n10.1073/pnas.1424042112\n10.1093/cvr/cvr274\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.232306\n10.1038/cdd.2014.181\n10.1093/hmg/ddt182\n10.1007/978-3-319-55330-6_12\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2017.05.018\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.12.002\n10.7150/thno.19441\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.05.010\n10.1038/cr.2013.102\n10.1038/aps.2017.29\n10.1089/ars.2018.7688\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.04.005\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0204605"}
{"title": "Compound LM9, a novel MyD88 inhibitor, efficiently mitigates inflammatory responses and fibrosis in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Mechanisms of cardiomyopathy caused by obesity/hyperlipidemia are complicated. Obesity is usually associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and may lead to the onset and progression of myocardial fibrosis and remodeling. TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway, as a key regulator of inflammation, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. We previously demonstrated that LM9, a novel MyD88 inhibitor, attenuated inflammatory responses and fibrosis in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy by inhibiting the formation of TLR4/MyD88 complex. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of LM9 on obesity-induced cardiomyopathy in vitro and in vivo. We showed that LM9 (5, 10\u2009\u03bcM) significantly attenuates palmitic acid (PA)-induced inflammation in mouse peritoneal macrophages, evidenced by decreased expression of proinflammatory genes including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and ICAM-1. In cardiac-derived H9C2 cells, LM9 treatment suppressed PA-induced inflammation, lipid accumulation, and fibrotic responses. In addition, LM9 treatment also inhibited PA-activated TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. We further revealed in HEK293 cells that LM9 treatment blocked the TLR4/MyD88 binding and MyD88 homodimer formation. In HFD-fed mice, administration of LM9 (5, 10\u2009mg/kg, ig, every other days for 8 weeks) dose-dependently alleviated inflammation and fibrosis in heart tissues and decreased serum lipid concentration. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MyD88 inhibitor LM9 exerts protective effects against obesity-induced cardiomyopathy, suggesting LM9 to be a promising therapeutic candidate drug for the obesity-related cardiac complications.", "journal": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "date": "2020-04-29", "authors": ["Xu-YongZheng", "Chu-ChuSun", "QianLiu", "Xiao-YaoLu", "Li-LiFu", "GuangLiang", "Xiu-HuaZhang", "Gao-ZhiChen"], "doi": "10.1038/s41401-020-0410-x\n10.1038/nrendo.2017.157\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034454\n10.3390/nu10040432\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.032780\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000001731\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306885\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01866\n10.1146/annurev-immunol-031210-101322\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2009.12.004\n10.1038/nrendo.2017.90\n10.1007/s13105-012-0154-2\n10.1016/j.amjhyper.2004.11.035\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.03.509\n10.1038/oby.2008.475\n10.1210/jc.2006-0195\n10.1038/ncomms13997\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.106.142851\n10.1194/jlr.D029546\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.09.068\n10.1016/j.taap.2019.03.012\n10.1074/jbc.M112.415810\n10.1038/cddis.2016.140\n10.1093/cvr/cvx012\n10.1152/physrev.00017.2007\n10.1172/JCI200319451\n10.1136/heart.89.10.1127\n10.1111/joim.12728\n10.1111/jcmm.12832\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.05.031\n10.1152/ajpheart.00093.2017\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.199802"}

Aging is the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease with cardiomyocyte apoptosis as one underlying cause.

Importantly, loss of SARRAH (OXCT1-AS1) in human engineered heart tissue results in impaired contractile force development. SARRAH directly binds to the promoters of genes downregulated after SARRAH silencing via RNA-DNA triple helix formation and cardiomyocytes lacking the triple helix\u00a0forming domain of Sarrah show an increase in apoptosis. One of the direct SARRAH targets is NRF2, and restoration of NRF2 levels after SARRAH silencing partially rescues the reduction in cell viability. Overexpression of Sarrah in mice shows better recovery of cardiac contractile function after AMI compared to control mice.

Nonetheless, implanted stem cells rarely survive in the recipient heart, suggesting that the benefits of stem cell therapy may involve other mechanisms. Exosomes derived from stem cells have a myocardial protection function after myocardial injury, and may be a promising and effective therapy for CVDs. Here, we discuss the application and mechanism of exosomes derived from stem cells in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs and provide evidence for the application of exosomes in CVDs.

{"title": "Functional arrays of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac microtissues.", "abstract": "To accelerate the cardiac drug discovery pipeline, we set out to develop a platform that would be capable of quantifying tissue-level functions such as contractile force and be amenable to standard multiwell-plate manipulations. We report a 96-well-based array of 3D human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiac microtissues - termed Cardiac MicroRings (CaMiRi) - in custom 3D-print-molded multiwell plates capable of contractile force measurement. Within each well, two elastomeric microcantilevers are situated above a circumferential ramp. The wells are seeded with cell-laden collagen, which, in response to the gradual slope of the circumferential ramp, self-organizes around tip-gated microcantilevers to form contracting CaMiRi. The contractile force exerted by the CaMiRi is measured and calculated using the deflection of the cantilevers. Platform responses were robust and comparable across wells, and we used it to determine an optimal tissue formulation. We validated the\u00a0contractile force response of CaMiRi using selected cardiotropic compounds with known effects. Additionally, we developed automated protocols for CaMiRi seeding, image acquisition, and analysis to enable\u00a0the measurement of contractile force with increased throughput. The unique tissue fabrication properties of the platform, and the consequent effects on tissue function, were demonstrated upon adding hPSC-derived epicardial cells to the system.

{"title": "Sevoflurane Postconditioning Reduces Hypoxia-Reoxygenation Injury in H9C2 Embryonic Rat Cardiomyocytes and Targets the STRADA Gene by Upregulating microRNA-107.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Sevoflurane as a widely used inhalational general anesthetic that also has a cardioprotective role in hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury. This study aimed to investigate the effects of microRNA-107 (miR-107) on sevoflurane postconditioning (SpostC) in H9C2 embryonic rat cardiomyocytes and to use bioinformatics analysis to identify the molecular basis of cardioprotection from sevoflurane in human cardiac tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS The STRADA gene was identified from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. H9C2 embryonic rat cardiomyocytes were cultured with sevoflurane. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to measure the mRNA expression and protein expression of STRADA and miR-107 in H9C2 cells. TargetScanHuman version 7.2 was used to identify the target gene of miR-107 and to predict the STRADA 3'-UTR binding site of miR-107. The dual-luciferase reporter assay measured the relative luciferase activity. The cell proliferation rate and cell apoptosis were measured using the MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS H/R injury in H9C2 cells following SpostC resulted in increased expression of miR-107 and reduced expression of STRADA. Specific binding of miR-107 was identified to STRADA 3'-UTR. Upregulation of the miR-107 in SpostC H/R injured H9C2 cells promoted cell proliferation, reduced cell apoptosis, and downregulating the protein expression of caspase-3. STRADA overexpression reduced the effects of a miR-107 mimic on SpostC.

{"title": "The role of 5-HT7 receptors on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats with high-fat diet exacerbated coronary endothelial dysfunction.", "abstract": "The presence of 5-HT7r's in both human and rat cardiovascular and immune tissues and their contribution to inflammatory conditions prompted us to hypothesize that these receptors contribute in acute myocardial infarction (MI) with underlying chronic endothelial dysfunction. We investigated the role of 5-HT7 receptors on heart tissue that damaged by isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MI in rats with high-fat diet (HFD). In vitro and in vivo effects of 5-HT7r agonist (LP44) and antagonist (SB269970) have been investigated on the H9C2 cell line and rats, respectively. For in vivo analyses, rats were fed with HFD for 8 weeks and after this period ISO-induced MI model has been applied to rat. To investigate the role of 5-HT7r's, two different doses of LP44 and SB269970 were evaluated and compared with standard hypolipidemic agent, atorvastatin. In vitro studies showed that LP44 has protective and proliferative effects on rat cardiomyocytes. Also in in vivo studies stimulating 5-HT7r's by LP44 improved blood lipid profile (decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-C, and triglyceride, increased high-density lipoprotein), decreased cardiac damage markers (creatine kinase and troponin-I), and corrected inflammatory status (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6). Our results showed significant improvement in LP44 administered rats in terms of histopathologic analyses. In damaged tissues, 5-HT7 mRNA expression increased and agonist administration decreased this elevation significantly. We determined for the first time that 5-HT7r's are overexpressed in ISO-induced MI of rats with underlying HFD-induced endothelial dysfunction. Restoration of this overexpression by LP44, a 5-HT7r agonist, ameliorated heart tissue in physiopathologic, enzymatic, and molecular level, showing the cardiac role of these receptors and suggesting them as future potential therapeutic targets.", "journal": "Human & experimental toxicology", "date": "2020-04-25", "authors": ["ICinar", "ZHalici", "BDincer", "BSirin", "ECadirci"], "doi": "10.1177/0960327120916821"}

Experimental mice were randomly allocated into 3 groups (25 mice in each group): The control group (NC), the LPS group (LPS) and the LPS + luteolin group (LPS + Lut). Before the SIC model was induced, luteolin was dissolved in DMSO and injected intraperitoneally for 10 days into LPS + Lut group mice. NC group and LPS group mice received an equal volume of DMSO for 10 days. On day 11, the animal model of sepsis\u2011induced cardiac dysfunction was induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. A total of 12 h after LPS injection, measurements and comparisons were made among the groups.

{"title": "Calreticulin expression in human cardiac myocytes induces ER stress-associated apoptosis.", "abstract": "The global burden of heart failure following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a growing problem. One pathway that is key to understanding the progression of myocardial infarction and IR injury is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway, which contributes to apoptosis signaling and tissue death. The role of calreticulin in the progression of ER stress remains controversial. We hypothesized that calreticulin induction drives proapoptotic signaling in response to ER stress. We find here that calreticulin is upregulated in human ischemic heart failure cardiac tissue, as well as simulated hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) and thapsigargin-mediated ER stress. To test the impact of direct modulation of calreticulin expression on ER stress-induced apoptosis, human cardiac-derived AC16 cells with stable overexpression or silencing of calreticulin were subjected to thapsigargin treatment, and markers of apoptosis were evaluated. It was found that overexpression of calreticulin promotes apoptosis, while a partial knockdown protects against the expression of caspase 12, CHOP, and reduces thapsigargin-driven TUNEL staining. These data shed light on the role that calreticulin plays in apoptosis signaling during ER stress in cardiac cells.", "journal": "Physiological reports", "date": "2020-04-24", "authors": ["Michael WStoner", "Charles FMcTiernan", "IainScott", "Janet RManning"], "doi": "10.14814/phy2.14400\n10.1152/ajpheart.00056.2015\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.10.013\n10.1038/s41598-019-39515-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.03.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.01.022\n10.1038/ncb1101-e255\n10.1093/cvr/cvr106\n10.1074/jbc.m209900200\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2007.02.003\n10.1152/ajpcell.00075.2005\n10.1007/s11010-009-0337-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0056387\n10.1093/abbs/gmu048\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00789\n10.1097/SHK.0b013e3182a3f9e5\n10.1097/psy.0000000000000353\n10.1097/shk.0b013e318123e822\n10.1002/pmic.200500906\n10.1097/SHK.0b013e318164ca29\n10.1016/j.tcm.2006.01.004\n10.1083/jcb.200412156\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.08.040\n10.1042/bcj20190302\n10.1023/a:1012209923231\n10.1083/jcb.144.5.857\n10.1023/B:MCBI.0000041855.10149.5f\n10.1152/ajpheart.00259.2019\n10.1161/atvbaha.111.224519\n10.1038/cdd.2016.138\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4401252\n10.1016/j.jep.2019.111857\n10.1007/s10495-016-1304-8\n10.2174/187152907781745260\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.02.013\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2015.08.010\n10.1097/01.shk.0000246901.58068.a8\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000224\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.02.020\n10.1152/ajpheart.00980.2009\n10.1038/s41419-018-0726-3\n10.1007/s00380-013-0418-y\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109518"}

Tissue engineered cardiac patches containing human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) can restore contractile function. However, cells within thick patches require vasculature for blood flow. Recently, we demonstrated fibronectin coated decellularized leaves provide a suitable scaffold for hiPS-CMs. Yet, the necessity of this additional coating step is unclear. Therefore, we compared hiPS-CM behavior on decellularized leaves coated with collagen IV or fibronectin extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to noncoated leaves for up to 21\u2009days. Successful coating was verified by immunofluorescence. Similar numbers of hiPS-CMs adhered to coated and noncoated decellularized leaves for 21\u2009days. At Day 14, collagen IV coated leaves contracted more than noncoated leaves (3.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.39% vs. 1.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.60%; p\u2009<\u2009.05). However, no differences in contraction were found between coated leaves, coated tissue culture plastic (TCP), noncoated leaves, or noncoated TCP at other time points. No significant differences were observed in hiPS-CM spreading or sarcomere lengths on leaves with or without coating. This study demonstrates that cardiac scaffolds can be created from decellularized leaves without ECM coatings.

Although cardiac cell death is a well-recognized pathological mechanism of MI, therapeutic blockade of cell death to treat MI is not straightforward. Death receptor 5 (DR5) and its ligand TRAIL [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand] are up-regulated in MI, but their roles in pathological remodeling are unknown. Here, we report that blocking TRAIL with a soluble DR5 immunoglobulin fusion protein diminished MI by preventing cardiac cell death and inflammation in rats, pigs, and monkeys. Mechanistically, TRAIL induced the death of cardiomyocytes and recruited and activated leukocytes, directly and indirectly causing cardiac injury. Transcriptome profiling revealed increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in infarcted heart tissue, which was markedly reduced by TRAIL blockade. Together, our findings indicate that TRAIL mediates MI directly by targeting cardiomyocytes and indirectly by affecting myeloid cells, supporting TRAIL blockade as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating MI.", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "date": "2020-04-24", "authors": ["YaohuiWang", "HailongZhang", "ZhizengWang", "YinxiangWei", "MingliWang", "MeichenLiu", "XuanceWang", "YinanJiang", "GongningShi", "DongmeiZhao", "ZhengyanYang", "ZhiguangRen", "JingLi", "ZhenkaiZhang", "ZhenfengWang", "BeiZhang", "BeibeiZong", "XuekeLou", "ChengguoLiu", "ZihuiWang", "HaoZhang", "NingyaTao", "XuefangLi", "XingkunZhang", "YafeiGuo", "YangYe", "YuQi", "HuiLi", "ManWang", "RongxinGuo", "GuanchangCheng", "ShulianLi", "JunZhang", "GuangchaoLiu", "LihuiChai", "QiangLou", "XiaLi", "XiukunCui", "ErheGao", "ZhengDong", "YanzhongHu", "Youhai HChen", "YuanfangMa"], "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw3172"}

Human cardiomyocytes and Wistar rat hearts perfused using Langendorff method subjected to I/R have been used. Hemodynamic parameters of heart function, markers of I/R injury, and gene and protein expression of Klotho were measured. Human cardiomyocytes were also incubated in the presence of recombinant Klotho protein, and the viability of cells was measured. There was a higher expression of Klotho gene and protein synthesis in the cardiomyocytes subjected to I/R injury. The compensatory production and release of Klotho protein from cardiac tissue during I/R were also shown.

The mechanisms underlying the detrimental and beneficial effects of heat stress remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of p53 in the responses of cardiac muscle cells to acute heat exposure and heat acclimation (HA). Heat exposure increased the levels of caspase and annexin, and levels of cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial p53 protein in H9c2 cells. Pifithrin-\u03b1 or pifithrin-\u03bc reduced heat-induced apoptotic response in these cells. HA reduced localization of p53 in the mitochondria and improved cell viability during heat exposure. The effects of heat exposure and HA on p53 were further verified in vivo in mouse heart tissue. These results suggest that p53 plays a role in heat-induced apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells.

{"title": "Rapid clearance of Borrelia burgdorferi from the blood circulation.", "abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a tick-borne spirochete that causes Lyme borreliosis (LB). After an initial tick bite, it spreads from the deposition site in the dermis to distant tissues of the host. It is generally believed that this spirochete disseminates via the hematogenous route. Borrelia persica causes relapsing fever and is able to replicate in the blood stream. Currently the exact dissemination pathway of LB pathogens in the host is not known and controversially discussed.\nIn this study, we established a strict intravenous infection murine model using host-adapted spirochetes. Survival capacity and infectivity of host-adapted B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) were compared to those of B. persica (Bp) after either intradermal (ID) injection into the dorsal skin of immunocompetent mice or strict intravenous (IV) inoculation via the jugular vein. By in vitro culture and PCR, viable spirochetes and their DNA load in peripheral blood were periodically monitored during a 49/50-day course post-injection, as well as in various tissue samples collected at day 49/50. Specific antibodies in individual plasma/serum samples were detected with serological methods.\nRegardless of ID or IV injection, DNA of Bp was present in blood samples up to day 24 post-challenge, while no Bbss was detectable in the blood circulation during the complete observation period. In contrast to the brain tropism of Bp, Bbss spirochetes were found in ear, skin, joint, bladder, and heart tissue samples of only ID-inoculated mice. All tested tissues collected from IV-challenged mice were negative for traces of Bbss. ELISA testing of serum samples showed that Bp induced gradually increasing antibody levels after ID or IV inoculation, while Bbss did so only after ID injection but not after IV inoculation.\nThis study allows us to draw the following conclusions: (i) Bp survives in the blood and disseminates to the host's brain via the hematogenous route; and (ii) Bbss, in contrast, is cleared rapidly from the blood stream and is a tissue-bound spirochete.", "journal": "Parasites & vectors", "date": "2020-04-22", "authors": ["LiucunLiang", "JinyongWang", "LucasSchorter", "Thu PhongNguyen Trong", "ShariFell", "SebastianUlrich", "Reinhard KStraubinger"], "doi": "10.1186/s13071-020-04060-y\n10.3201/eid0802.010198\n10.1111/j.1574-695X.2006.00104.x\n10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02767.x\n10.1089/vbz.2009.0170\n10.4269/ajtmh.13-0187\n10.3201/eid1707.101894\n10.1186/s13071-016-1530-5\n10.3201/eid1211.060715\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0004404\n10.1016/S0025-7125(05)70510-1\n10.1016/S0002-9343(99)80043-6\n10.1016/j.jaut.2014.09.004\n10.7326/0003-4819-107-5-725\n10.1056/NEJM198908313210906\n10.1038/nrdp.2016.90\n10.1016/S0002-9343(99)80097-7\n10.1086/314922\n10.1128/IAI.73.10.6791-6802.2005\n10.1111/cmi.12418\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.00114\n10.1056/NEJM198303313081302\n10.1034/j.1600-0463.2001.d01-178.x\n10.1099/0022-1317-50-10-896\n10.1128/IAI.65.4.1273-1285.1997\n10.1016/j.femsim.2005.05.001\n10.1056/NEJM199511163332004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0071270\n10.1128/IAI.71.9.5042-5055.2003\n10.1084/jem.170.4.1427\n10.1093/infdis/162.1.133\n10.1016/j.ttbdis.2015.06.012\n10.1128/JCM.31.5.1251-1255.1993\n10.1128/IAI.66.1.247-258.1998\n10.1128/JCM.38.6.2191-2199.2000\n10.1111/vcp.12213\n10.1093/infdis/167.3.651\n10.1016/0378-1135(93)90137-V\n10.1073/pnas.92.7.2909\n10.1128/JCM.41.11.5059-5065.2003\n10.1128/IAI.67.7.3518-3524.1999\n10.1016/j.micinf.2006.04.007\n10.1172/JCI119169\n10.1128/IAI.72.6.3195-3203.2004\n10.1086/516276\n10.1093/infdis/166.4.827\n10.1371/journal.pone.0196893\n10.1007/s00508-006-0688-9\n10.1016/S1567-5769(00)00041-2\n10.1016/j.pt.2012.12.001\n10.1038/s41598-017-16749-9\n10.1016/0167-5699(91)90106-4\n10.1093/jac/dkr371\n10.1016/S1286-4579(03)00097-2\n10.1038/37551\n10.1111/ics.12067\n10.1645/GE-833R.1\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1000090\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1000169\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07801.x\n10.1128/CMR.18.3.484-509.2005\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002102\n10.1089/vbz.2010.0197\n10.1128/JCM.31.2.272-278.1993\n10.1128/IAI.62.6.2625-2627.1994\n10.4269/ajtmh.1995.53.397\n10.1046/j.1537-2995.1990.30490273451.x\n10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40030274.x\n10.1046/j.1537-2995.1991.31491213305.x\n10.1128/IAI.01147-13\n10.1128/IAI.01216-09\n10.1111/trf.12879\n10.1046/j.1537-2995.1989.29789369673.x\n10.1093/infdis/162.2.557\n10.1046/j.1537-2995.1990.30490273434.x\n10.1086/343043\n10.1128/IAI.72.9.5262-5266.2004\n10.1128/IAI.69.7.4303-4312.2001\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60103-7\n10.2298/ABS1302533V\n10.1016/j.meegid.2016.04.019"}
{"title": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic.", "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient's blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.", "journal": "Diabetes & metabolic syndrome", "date": "2020-04-21", "authors": ["ErkanCure", "MedineCumhur Cure"], "doi": "10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.019\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000002481\n10.1002/jmv.25848\n10.1159/000507786"}

Antihypertensive activity was investigated in rats that received PILEE (50, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg) or captopril (40\u00a0mg/kg) daily for 28 days together with oral administration of L-NAME (40\u00a0mg/kg).

The heart, liver and kidneys were used to determine oxidative stress indices (malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione and catalase). The cardiac tissue was processed for histopathological changes.\nThe GC-MS profiling of PILEE identified 20 compounds namely fatty acid esters. Administration of PILEE (50, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg) dose dependently and significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure in hypertensive rats. PILEE administration significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reversed elevated IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in hypertensive rats. PILEE demonstrated antioxidant activity by attenuating L-NAME-induced elevated malondialdehyde and depletion of reduced glutathione and catalase activity in rat tissues.

The sequence was used to acquire data on 4 healthy volunteers with MB factors of two (MB2) and three (MB3), which were reconstructed using a joint reconstruction algorithm that tackles both k-t and MB acceleration. Forward simulations of the imaging process were used to tune the reconstruction model hyperparameters. Direct comparisons between MB and single-band tissue phase-mapping measurements were performed.\nSimulations showed that the velocities could be accurately reproduced with MB2 k-t (average \u00b1 twice the SD of the RMS error of 0.08 \u00b1 0.22\u00a0cm/s and velocity peak reduction of 1.03% \u00b1 6.47% compared with fully sampled velocities), whereas acceptable results were obtained with MB3 k-t (RMS error of 0.13 \u00b1 0.58\u00a0cm/s and peak reduction of 2.21% \u00b1 13.45%).

In this study, we aimed to determine whether IL-22 administration could activate the myocardial STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) signaling pathway, and thus prevent myocardial injury, in a mouse model of ischemia reperfusion injury. METHODS AND RESULTS We evaluated the STAT3 activation after IL-22 injection by Western blot analysis and immunostaining for phosphorylated STAT3 in the heart and found that STAT3 activation in heart tissue rapidly peaked after IL-22 injection. Coimmunostaining of phosphorylated STAT3 and \u03b1-actinin revealed that STAT3 activation occurred in cardiomyocytes after IL-22 administration. In heart tissue from intact mice, real-time PCR demonstrated significant expression of IL-22 receptor subunit 1, and coimmunostaining of IL-22 receptor subunit 1 and \u03b1-actinin showed IL-22 receptor subunit 1 expression in cardiomyocytes. In cultured cardiomyocytes, IL-22 activated STAT3, and we detected IL-22 receptor subunit 1 expression. Overall, these results indicated that IL-22 directly activated the myocardial IL-22-receptor subunit 1-STAT3 signaling pathway. Following ischemia reperfusion, compared with PBS-treated mice, IL-22-treated mice exhibited a significantly reduced infarct size, significantly reduced myocardial apoptosis, and significantly enhanced phosphorylated STAT3 expression. Moreover, heart tissue from IL-22-treated mice exhibited a significantly reduced expression ratio of phosphorylated p53 to p53.

{"title": "Gene expression profile in cases of infectious death in infancy.", "abstract": "Genetic predispositions in cases suffering sudden unexpected infant death have been a research focus worldwide during the past decade. Despite large efforts, there is still uncertainty concerning the molecular pathogenesis of these deaths. With genetic technology in constant development, the possibility of an alternative approach into this research field has become available, like mRNA expression studies.\nIn this study, we investigated mRNA gene expression in 14 cases who died suddenly and unexpectedly from infection without a history of severe illness prior to death. The control group included eight accidents, two cases of natural death, one undetermined, one case of medical malpractice, and two homicides. The study included tissue from liver, heart, and brain using Illumina whole-genome gene expression assay.\nFrom the array, 19 genes showed altered expression in the infectious deaths compared to controls. Tissue from the heart showed 15 genes with altered mRNA expression compared to the control group.\nDownregulation of KCNE5 in heart tissue from cases of infectious death was of particular interest. Variants of KCNE5 are associated with Brugada syndrome and sudden death and could be responsible for the fatal outcome in the group of infectious death.\nKCNE5 is downregulated in tissue from the heart in cases of infectious death in infancy. This study provides knowledge about the gene expression profile in cases of infectious death.

Voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) are traditionally used to measure cardiac APs; however, they require acute chemical addition that prevents chronic imaging. Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) enable long-term studies of APs without the need of chemical additions, but current GEVIs used in cardiac tissue exhibit poor kinetics and/or low signal to noise (SNR). Here, we demonstrate the use of Archon1, a recently developed GEVI, in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs). When expressed in CMs, Archon1 demonstrated fast kinetics comparable with patch-clamp electrophysiology and high SNR significantly greater than the VSD Di-8-ANEPPS. Additionally, Archon1 enabled monitoring of APs across multiple cells simultaneously in 3D cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Real-Ambient Particulate Matter Exposure-Induced Cardiotoxicity in C57/B6 Mice.", "abstract": "It is generally accepted that exposure to particulate matter (PM) increases the risk of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, though the exact mechanism behind this has yet to be elucidated. Oxidative stress plays a potentially important role in the mechanism of toxicity, with Nrf2 serving as a major antioxidant gene. In the current study, a Nrf2 knockout mouse model was used in combination with an individual ventilated cage (IVC)-based real-ambient PM exposure system to assess the potential cardiotoxicity induced by real-ambient PM exposure and the potential role of Nrf2 and related signaling in this endpoint. After 6- or 11-weeks exposure to PM, ICP-mass spectrometry was used to assess the metal depositions in the heart tissue following PM exposure. Functional and morphological changes in the hearts were investigated with echocardiography and histopathology, and oxidative stress levels were assessed with a serum malondialdehyde content assay. In the further mechanistic study, an RNA-seq technique was utilized to assess the gene transcription status in the hearts of C57/B6 mice exposed to PM with or without Nrf2 knockout. The expression levels of genes of interest were then further investigated with quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. The results indicated that PM exposure resulted in significant elevation of sodium, potassium, selenium, and ferrum levels in mouse heart tissue. Meanwhile, significantly altered heart function and morphology were observed. Interestingly, Nrf2 knockout led to abolishment of PM-induced effects in several functional parameters but not the morphological changes. Meanwhile, elevated malondialdehyde content was observed in Nrf2 knockout animals. RNA-seq results revealed thousands of genes altered by PM exposure and/or Nrf2 knockout, and this affected several pathways, such as MAPK, phagosome, calcium signaling, and JAK-STAT. In subsequent molecular studies, enhanced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was also observed following PM exposure, while the MAPK signaling pathway along with related JAK-STAT and TGF-\u03b21 pathway genes, such as p38MAPK, AKT, TAK1, JAK1, STAT3, GRB2, TGFb1, and SMAD2, were confirmed to be affected by PM exposure and/or Nrf2 knockout. The data suggested that PM may induce cardiotoxicity in C57/B6 mice in which Nrf2 plays both protective and detrimental roles involving cardiac-related pathways, such as MAPK, JAK-STAT, and TGF-\u03b21.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2020-04-17", "authors": ["LianhuaCui", "LimeiShi", "DaochuanLi", "XiaoboLi", "XuanSu", "LipingChen", "QixiaoJiang", "MenghuiJiang", "JingLuo", "AndongJi", "ChenChen", "JianxunWang", "JingLongTang", "JingboPi", "RuiChen", "WenChen", "RongZhang", "YuxinZheng"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2020.00199\n10.1007/s00484-016-1214-z\n10.1289/ehp.0800108\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.210906\n10.1289/ehp.8335\n10.1007/s12012-018-9461-3\n10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.22\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000128587.30041.C8\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e3181dbece1\n10.1002/jat.3249\n10.3390/medicina55060239\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.09.004\n10.1289/ehp.1002904\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00382\n10.1007/s10565-013-9242-5\n10.1001/jama.295.10.1127\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.000027\n10.1155/2018/8309698\n10.1007/s11356-017-0228-3\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.067\n10.1177/1178630218792861\n10.1016/j.envres.2017.10.041\n10.1002/tox.22707\n10.1016/j.envint.2006.12.001\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.10.001\n10.1016/j.cr.2018.11.002\n10.1016/j.envint.2018.12.010\n10.1016/j.autrev.2019.102390\n10.1016/j.trim.2014.03.006\n10.1016/j.tox.2012.01.005\n10.1289/ehp.1103995\n10.1186/s12199-018-0731-2\n10.1016/j.envpol.2017.05.040\n10.1039/C3EM00719G\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.05.058\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.01.017\n10.1016/j.envpol.2019.02.097\n10.1038/srep16936\n10.1002/tox.22556\n10.3390/ijms20010055\n10.1016/j.taap.2018.05.028\n10.1111/j.1526-4610.2007.01039.x\n10.1038/ncpcardio1399\n10.2174/1871528110908050334\n10.2116/analsci.18SBR01\n10.1097/00005344-200205000-00016\n10.1021/acs.est.5b01449\n10.3390/ijms20164061\n10.1089/scd.2019.0003\n10.1289/ehp.1002921\n10.1186/s12989-018-0264-2\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.07.099\n10.1136/jech.2006.058123\n10.1155/2017/9237263\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.08.008\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00268\n10.1021/acs.est.8b01714\n10.1038/sj.jea.7500382\n10.3390/diseases4040034\n10.1007/s11356-016-7144-9\n10.1016/j.fct.2018.09.042\n10.1016/j.envres.2014.06.018\n10.12659/MSM.903006\n10.1039/C7MT00191F\n10.1007/s11010-019-03608-6\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.08.014\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.03.017\n10.3390/ijerph15122835\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.05.036\n10.1155/2018/8730593\n10.1016/j.envres.2014.12.016"}

{"title": "Fluorescent conjugated polymer nanovector for in vivo tracking and regulating the fate of stem cells for restoring infarcted myocardium.", "abstract": "Stem cell therapy holds great promise for cardiac regeneration. However, the lack of ability to control stem cell fate after in vivo transplantation greatly restricts its therapeutic outcomes. MicroRNA delivery has emerged as a powerful tool to control stem cell fate for enhanced cardiac regeneration. However, the clinical translation of therapy based on gene-transfected stem cells remains challenging, due to the unknown in vivo behaviors of stem cells. Here, we developed a nano-platform (i.e., PFBT@miR-1-Tat NPs) that can achieve triggered release of microRNA-1 to promote cardiac differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and long-term tracking of transplanted MSCs through bright and ultra-stable fluorescence of conjugated polymer poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PFBT). We found that PFBT@miR-1-Tat NP-treated MSCs significantly restored the infarcted myocardium by promoting stem cell cardiac differentiation and integration with the in situ cardiac tissues. Meanwhile, MSCs without gene delivery improved the infarcted heart functions mainly through a paracrine effect and blood vessel formation. The developed conjugated polymer nanovector should be a powerful tool for manipulating as well as revealing the fate of therapeutic cells in vivo, which is critical for optimizing the therapeutic route of gene and cell combined therapy and therefore for accelerating clinical translation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The lack of controllability in stem cell fate and the unclear in vivo cellular behaviors restrict the therapeutic outcomes of stem cell therapy. Herein, we engineered fluorescent conjugated polymer nanoparticles as gene delivery nanovectors with controlled release and high intracellular delivery capability to harness the fate of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vivo, meanwhile to reveal the cellular mechanism of gene-treated stem cell therapy. As compared with only MSC treatment that improves infarcted myocardium functions through paracrine effect, treatment with conjugated polymer nanovector-treated MSCs significantly restored infarcted myocardium through enhancing MSC cardiac differentiation and integration with the in-situ cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Reactivation of Myc transcription in the mouse heart unlocks its proliferative capacity.", "abstract": "It is unclear why some tissues are refractory to the mitogenic effects of the oncogene Myc. Here we show\u00a0that Myc activation induces rapid transcriptional responses followed by proliferation in some, but not all, organs. Despite such disparities in proliferative response, Myc is bound to DNA at open elements in responsive (liver) and non-responsive (heart) tissues, but fails to induce a robust transcriptional and proliferative response in the heart. Using heart as an exemplar of a non-responsive tissue, we show that Myc-driven transcription is re-engaged in mature cardiomyocytes by elevating levels of the\u00a0positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb), instating a large proliferative response. Hence, P-TEFb activity is a key limiting determinant of whether the heart is permissive for Myc transcriptional activation. These data provide a greater understanding of how Myc transcriptional activity is determined and indicate modification of P-TEFb levels could be utilised to drive regeneration of adult cardiomyocytes for the treatment of heart myopathies.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2020-04-15", "authors": ["Megan JBywater", "Deborah LBurkhart", "JasminStraube", "AriannaSab\u00f2", "VeraPendino", "James EHudson", "Gregory AQuaife-Ryan", "Enzo RPorrello", "JamesRae", "Robert GParton", "Theresia RKress", "BrunoAmati", "Trevor DLittlewood", "Gerard IEvan", "Catherine HWilson"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-15552-x\n10.1126/science.2006410\n10.1002/j.1460-2075.1993.tb06202.x\n10.1101/gad.6.1.71\n10.1038/359423a0\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81479-8\n10.1101/gad.907901\n10.1038/sj.embor.embor861\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.030\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206800\n10.1074/jbc.M207441200\n10.1101/gr.226035.117\n10.1038/nrm3953\n10.1016/j.molcel.2006.06.014\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-052610-095910\n10.1128/MMBR.00011-06\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600883\n10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00388-5\n10.1016/j.molcel.2008.01.003\n10.1101/cshperspect.a014217\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90123-T\n10.1002/j.1460-2075.1991.tb07929.x\n10.1038/353361a0\n10.1101/gad.1455706\n10.1101/gad.2038411\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.11.013\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.08.026\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.08.033\n10.1073/pnas.0604129103\n10.1038/nature13537\n10.1038/nature13473\n10.1038/nrc3984\n10.1038/ncb1434\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.09.045\n10.7554/eLife.15161\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.10.018\n10.1002/(SICI)1526-968X(200002)26:2<110::AID-GENE2>3.0.CO;2-8\n10.1002/dvg.20335\n10.1038/onc.2014.78\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028252\n10.1038/nature11247\n10.1038/ng.3867\n10.1038/nm778\n10.1172/JCI119509\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600351\n10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80350-0\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00738-9\n10.1093/nar/23.10.1686\n10.1038/nm.3642\n10.1080/15384101.2015.1120925\n10.1038/s41467-019-08487-5\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.053\n10.1038/s41586-019-1030-9\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.06.003\n10.1128/MCB.18.11.6729\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0163\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1073/pnas.1208863110\n10.1093/cvr/cvq005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031542\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034886\n10.1038/nature08899\n10.1038/nature11739\n10.1242/dev.102798\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.01.017\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.032\n10.1242/jcs.175018\n10.4049/jimmunol.175.10.6402\n10.1128/MCB.01767-07\n10.1038/nature24045\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.014\n10.1038/nature20173\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.07.035\n10.1038/nature07829\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309202\n10.1038/nature15695\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-0316\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts280\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu775\n10.3389/fgene.2016.00075\n10.1093/nar/gks433\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btv288\n10.15252/embr.201947987"}
{"title": "In vivo priming of human mesenchymal stem cells with hepatocyte growth factor-engineered mesenchymal stem cells promotes therapeutic potential for cardiac repair.", "abstract": "The clinical use of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) has been hampered by their poor performance after transplantation into failing hearts. Here, to improve the therapeutic potential of BM-MSCs, we developed a strategy termed in vivo priming in which BM-MSCs are primed in vivo in myocardial infarction (MI)-induced hearts through genetically engineered hepatocyte growth factor-expressing MSCs (HGF-eMSCs) that are encapsulated within an epicardially implanted 3D cardiac patch. Primed BM-MSCs through HGF-eMSCs exhibited improved vasculogenic potential and cell viability, which ultimately enhanced vascular regeneration and restored cardiac function to the MI hearts. Histological analyses further demonstrated that the primed BM-MSCs survived longer within a cardiac patch and conferred cardioprotection evidenced by substantially higher numbers of viable cardiomyocytes in the MI hearts. These results provide compelling evidence that this in vivo priming strategy can be an effective means to enhance the cardiac repair of MI hearts.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2020-04-15", "authors": ["Bong-WooPark", "Soo-HyunJung", "SanskritaDas", "Soon MinLee", "Jae-HyunPark", "HyeokKim", "Ji-WonHwang", "SunghunLee", "Hyo-JinKim", "Hey-YonKim", "SeungmanJung", "Dong-WooCho", "JinahJang", "KiwonBan", "Hun-JunPark"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.aay6994"}
{"title": "Melatonin ameliorates periodontitis-related inflammatory stress at cardiac left ventricular tissues in rats.", "abstract": "The aim of this experimental rat study was to investigate the potential inflammatory effects of periodontitis on cardiac left ventricular tissue and the therapeutic activity of melatonin on these effects.\nTwenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, experimental periodontitis (Ep), and Ep-melatonin (Ep-Mel). Experimental periodontitis was induced by placing and maintaining 3.0 silk ligatures at a peri marginal position on the left and right mandibular first molars for 5 weeks. Afterward, following the removal of ligatures, melatonin (10\u00a0mg/body weight) to Ep-Mel group, and vehicle (saline) to Ep and control groups were administered intraperitoneally for 14 days. On the first day of the eighth week, mandibular and cardiac left ventricular tissue samples were obtained following the euthanasia of the rats in all groups. Alveolar bone loss measurements were made on histological and microcomputed tomographic slices. Cardiac tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and cardiac Troponin-T (cTnT) were evaluated by appropriate biochemical methods.\nMeasurements made on the histological and microcomputed tomographic slices showed that melatonin significantly limits the ligature-induced periodontal tissue destruction (P\u00a0<0.01). In addition, melatonin was detected to cause a significant decrease of MDA, MMP-9, and cTnT levels which were found to be significantly higher on rats with Ep (P\u00a0<0.05) while having no significant effect on antioxidant levels (GSH, SOD, and CAT) (P\u00a0>0.05).\nMelatonin might be regarded as an important supportive therapeutic agent to reduce the early degenerative changes and possible hypertrophic remodeling at cardiac left ventricular tissues provoked by periodontitis-related bacteria and/or periodontal inflammation.", "journal": "Journal of periodontology", "date": "2020-04-13", "authors": ["O\u011fuzK\u00f6se", "SevdaKurt Bayrakdar", "KerimaliAky\u0131ld\u0131z", "AhmetAlt\u0131n", "TanerArabac\u0131", "HaticeYemenoglu", "MeltemZihni Korkmaz", "Taha EmreK\u00f6se", "LeylaT\u00fcrker Sener", "TolgaMercantepe", "LeventT\u00fcmkaya", "AdnanY\u0131lmaz"], "doi": "10.1002/JPER.19-0685"}
{"title": "Human epicardium-derived cells reinforce cardiac sympathetic innervation.", "abstract": "After cardiac damage, excessive neurite outgrowth (sympathetic hyperinnervation) can occur, which is related to ventricular arrhythmias/sudden cardiac death. Post-damage reactivation of epicardium causes epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) to acquire a mesenchymal character, contributing to cardiac regeneration. Whether EPDCs also contribute to cardiac re/hyperinnervation, is unknown.\nTo investigate whether mesenchymal EPDCs influence cardiac sympathetic innervation.\nSympathetic ganglia were co-cultured with mesenchymal EPDCs and/or myocardium, and neurite outgrowth and sprouting density were assessed. Results showed a significant increase in neurite density and directional (i.e. towards myocardium) outgrowth when ganglia were co-cultured with a combination of EPDCs and myocardium, as compared to cultures with EPDCs or myocardium alone. In absence of myocardium, this outgrowth was not directional. Neurite differentiation of PC12 cells in conditioned medium confirmed these results via a paracrine effect, in accordance with expression of neurotrophic factors in myocardial explants co-cultured with EPDCs. Of interest, EPDCs increased the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in cultured, but not in fresh myocardium, possibly due to an \"ischemic state\" of cultured myocardium, supported by TUNEL and Hif1\u03b1 expression. Cardiac tissues after myocardial infarction showed robust NGF expression in the infarcted, but not remote area.\nNeurite outgrowth and density increases significantly in the presence of EPDCs by a paracrine effect, indicating a new role for EPDCs in the occurrence of sympathetic re/hyperinnervation after cardiac damage.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2020-04-12", "authors": ["YangGe", "Anke MSmits", "J Connyvan Munsteren", "Adriana CGittenberger-de Groot", "Robert EPoelmann", "Thomas Jvan Brakel", "Martin JSchalij", "Marie-Jos\u00e9Goumans", "Marco CDeRuiter", "Monique R MJongbloed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.04.006"}
{"title": "The Emerging Role of the RBM20 and PTBP1 Ribonucleoproteins in Heart Development and Cardiovascular Diseases.", "abstract": "Alternative splicing is a regulatory mechanism essential for cell differentiation and tissue organization. More than 90% of human genes are regulated by alternative splicing events, which participate in cell fate determination. The general mechanisms of splicing events are well known, whereas only recently have deep-sequencing, high throughput analyses and animal models provided novel information on the network of functionally coordinated, tissue-specific, alternatively spliced exons. Heart development and cardiac tissue differentiation require thoroughly regulated splicing events. The ribonucleoprotein RBM20 is a key regulator of the alternative splicing events required for functional and structural heart properties, such as the expression of TTN isoforms. Recently, the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein PTBP1 has been demonstrated to participate with RBM20 in regulating splicing events. In this review, we summarize the updated knowledge relative to RBM20 and PTBP1 structure and molecular function; their role in alternative splicing mechanisms involved in the heart development and function; RBM20 mutations associated with idiopathic dilated cardiovascular disease (DCM); and the consequences of RBM20-altered expression or dysfunction.

{"title": "3D Electrophysiological Modeling of Interstitial Fibrosis Networks and Their Role in Ventricular Arrhythmias in Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Interstitial fibrosis is a pathological expansion of the heart's inter-cellular collagen matrix. It is a potential complication of nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM), a class of diseases involving electrical and or mechanical dysfunction of cardiac tissue not caused by atherosclerosis. Patients with NICM and interstitial fibrosis often suffer from life threatening arrhythmias, which we aim to simulate in this study.\nOur methodology builds on an efficient discrete finite element (DFE) method which allows for the representation of fibrosis as infinitesimal splits in a mesh. We update the DFE method with a local connectivity analysis which creates a consistent topology in the fibrosis network. This is particularly important in nonischemic disease due to the potential presence of large and contiguous fibrotic regions and therefore potentially complex fibrosis networks.\nIn experiments with an image-based model, we demonstrate that our methodology is able to simulate reentrant electrical events associated with cardiac arrhythmias. These reentries depended crucially upon sufficient fibrosis density, which was marked by conduction slowing at high pacing rates. We also created a 2D test-case which demonstrated that fibrosis topologies can modulate transient conduction block, and thereby reentrant activations.\nVentricular arrhythmias due to interstitial fibrosis in NICM can be efficiently simulated using our methods in medical image based geometries. Furthermore, fibrosis topology modulates transient conduction block, and should be accounted for in electrophysiological simulations with interstitial fibrosis.\nOur study provides methodology which has the potential to predict arrhythmias and to optimize treatments non-invasively for nonischemic cardiomyopathies.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2020-04-11", "authors": ["GabrielBalaban", "Caroline MendoncaCosta", "BradleyPorter", "BrianHalliday", "Christopher ARinaldi", "SanjayPrasad", "GernotPlank", "Tevfik FIsmail", "Martin JBishop"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2020.2976924"}

However, how adipose tissue affects glucose utilization is poorly understood. PAI-1-knockout (PAI-1KO) mice were previously shown to be resistant to a high-fat diet and obesity. We used microPET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography), gene microarray, and biochemical assays to measure changes in systemic and myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to transplantation of adipose tissue from PAI-1KO and wild-type mice. Here, we show that transplanting subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) from PAI-1KO mice into high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice reduced levels of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides, and improved glucose tolerance in the HFD-fed mice. microPET/CT imaging revealed that cardiac glucose uptake was increased in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice transplanted with PAI-1KO scWAT, suggesting that the transplanted PAI-1KO scWAT exerted endocrine effects in the heart.

{"title": "Mechanism of Eccentric Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy Secondary to Severe Mitral Regurgitation.", "abstract": "Primary valvular heart disease is a prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in both industrialized and developing countries. Although the primary consequence of valvular heart disease is myocardial dysfunction, treatment of valvular heart diseases centers around valve repair or replacement rather than prevention or reversal of myocardial dysfunction. This is particularly evident in primary mitral regurgitation (MR), which invariably results in eccentric hypertrophy and left ventricular (LV) failure in the absence of timely valve repair or replacement. The mechanism of LV dysfunction in primary severe MR is entirely unknown.\nHere, we developed the first mouse model of severe MR. Valvular damage was achieved by severing the mitral valve leaflets and chords with iridectomy scissors, and MR was confirmed by echocardiography. Serial echocardiography was performed to follow up LV morphology and systolic function. Analysis of cardiac tissues was subsequently performed to evaluate valve deformation, cardiomyocyte morphology, LV fibrosis, and cell death. Finally, dysregulated pathways were assessed by RNA-sequencing analysis and immunofluorescence.\nIn the ensuing 15 weeks after the induction of MR, gradual LV dilatation and dysfunction occurred, resulting in severe systolic dysfunction. Further analysis revealed that severe MR resulted in a marked increase in cardiac mass and increased cardiomyocyte length but not width, with electron microscopic evidence of sarcomere disarray and the development of sarcomere disruption. From a mechanistic standpoint, severe MR resulted in activation of multiple components of both the mammalian target of rapamycin and calcineurin pathways. Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling preserved sarcomeric structure and prevented LV remodeling and systolic dysfunction. Immunohistochemical analysis uncovered a differential pattern of expression of the cell polarity regulator Crb2 (crumbs homolog 2) along the longitudinal axis of cardiomyocytes and close to the intercalated disks in the MR hearts. Electron microscopy images demonstrated a significant increase in polysome localization in close proximity to the intercalated disks and some areas along the longitudinal axis in the MR hearts.\nThese results indicate that LV dysfunction in response to severe MR is a form of maladaptive eccentric cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and outline the link between cell polarity regulation and spatial localization protein synthesis as a pathway for directional cardiomyocyte growth.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2020-04-11", "authors": ["ShujuanLi", "Ngoc Uyen NhiNguyen", "FengXiao", "IvanMenendez-Montes", "YujiNakada", "Wilson Lek WenTan", "Chukwuemeka GeorgeAnene-Nzelu", "Roger SFoo", "SuwanneeThet", "Alisson CamposCardoso", "PingWang", "Waleed MElhelaly", "Nicholas TLam", "Ana Helena MacedoPereira", "Joseph AHill", "Hesham ASadek"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043939"}
{"title": "Matrix metalloproteinase-7 in platelet-activated macrophages accounts for cardiac remodeling in uremic mice.", "abstract": "Heart failure is the leading cause of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, and progressive cardiac remodeling is the key pathological basis of heart failure. However, the mechanism by which uremia-induced cardiac remodeling occurs is not well understood. Here, we showed that platelets were significantly activated in 5/6 nephrectomy-operated mice, and cardiac remodeling in the uremic mice was significantly improved when platelets were effectively depleted. A cardiac fibrosis-related gene expression profile revealed that Mmp7, encoding matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), exhibited the greatest degree of downregulation in the hearts of uremic mice with platelets depleted. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we discovered that MMP-7 was mainly expressed in M1 and M4 cardiac macrophages, although it was also extensively expressed in heart tissues. For the upstream therapeutic target, neutralization of platelet factor 4 (PF4) with monoclonal antibody not only significantly suppressed M4 macrophages in vivo, but also notably prevented collagen destruction in heart tissues. For the downstream therapeutic target, the pharmacological inhibition of MMP-7 with selective inhibitor failed to notably affect the platelet status, but significantly reduced heart collagen destruction in mice, a further indication that MMP-7 is a crucial downstream molecular target of platelet activation. In vitro, platelets interacted with macrophages and drove them to upregulate MMP-7 expression via free molecules, especially PF4. Taken together, the data suggest that MMP-7 is a key downstream target of platelet activation during uremia. Thus, MMP-7 is a likely and novel therapeutic target for intervention of cardiac remodeling during uremia.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2020-04-10", "authors": ["YangYang", "LuMa", "ChaoWang", "MinghuiSong", "ChangchunLi", "MeihanChen", "JieZhou", "ChanglinMei"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-020-0789-z"}

The sepsis model was constructed using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Two hours after CLP, the levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1) and myocardial function markers (serum brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], cardiac troponin-I [cTNI], and procalcitonin [PCT]) were increased significantly, falling from around 9 hours postoperatively. The concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in the heart tissue was increased 6 hours after CLP. The heart rate (HR) of rats that underwent CLP decreased 2 hours after surgery and then increased to above-normal values. The left ventricular short axis shortening (FS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were decreased at 2 hours postoperatively and reached a minima at 6 hours. Stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and changes and heart index (CI) results indicated myocardial dysfunction. Western blot analysis demonstrated the increased expression of mitochondrial function-related proteins and activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays revealed that the proportion of proapoptotic cells was significantly higher in rats that underwent CLP than sham surgery at 2 to 24 hours postoperatively. Taken together, our results indicate that-in the rat model-CLP-induced sepsis leads to impaired cardiac function.

Decellularized dermal matrix was then cut into 600-\u03bcm-thick sections and either tested by uniaxial tensile stretching to characterize its mechanical behavior or used as three-dimensional scaffold to assess its capability to support regeneration by resident cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) ", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2020-04-09", "authors": ["ImmacolataBelviso", "VeronicaRomano", "Anna MariaSacco", "GiuliaRicci", "DianaMassai", "MarcellaCammarota", "AngiolinaCatizone", "ChiaraSchiraldi", "DariaNurzynska", "MaraTerzini", "AlessandraAldieri", "GianpaoloSerino", "FabrizioSchonauer", "FeliceSirico", "FrancescoD'Andrea", "StefaniaMontagnani", "FrancaDi Meglio", "ClotildeCastaldo"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2020.00229\n10.1007/s40778-016-0056-2\n10.5339/gcsp.2015.10\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.05.039\n10.1016/1050-1738(96)00005-9\n10.1016/0012-1606(84)90038-1\n10.1016/j.addr.2011.01.007\n10.1016/j.trsl.2013.11.003\n10.1038/nm742\n10.1172/JCI10272\n10.1126/science.aaf1502\n10.1155/2013/352370\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0732\n10.1002/mabi.201200170\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.09.010\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057\n10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014738\n10.7554/eLife.13758\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.05.013\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0267\n10.1002/stem.1929\n10.2174/1574888X13666180821160421\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.019\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1242/jcs.023820\n10.1007/s11886-017-0892-4\n10.1152/ajpheart.00433.2010\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.01.010\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32152-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32366-8\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2007.03.032\n10.1098/rsfs.2013.0058\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.016\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2012.0316\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.019\n10.1152/ajpcell.00559.2003\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00283\n10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7104506.x\n10.1002/ar.22985\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.09.014\n10.1152/ajpheart.00417.2010\n10.1002/term.46\n10.1002/jbm.b.33865\n10.1247/csf.24.19\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301152\n10.1111/j.1600-0625.2011.01313.x\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn280\n10.1016/0007-1226(78)90003-6\n10.1016/j.matbio.2018.01.013\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2013.11.007\n10.1007/bf01921738\n10.1002/bdra.20810\n10.5966/sctm.2016-0038\n10.1093/cvr/cvz010\n10.3390/jcdd6010012\n10.1016/s0021-9290(03)00172-6\n10.1260/2040-2295.4.3.329\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000350\n10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f97d98\n10.1002/adhm.201300620\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.12.032\n10.1007/s00395-012-0320-2\n10.1038/30270\n10.1002/jbma.35000\n10.1016/S1369-7021(11)70058-X\n10.1039/C5BM00038F\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2014.03.004\n10.1155/2019/3957931\n10.1159/000358652\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302533\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1111/jcmm.14316\n10.1016/j.ghir.2005.02.002\n10.1007/s00018-011-0633-6\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.01.068\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.06.031\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.07.009\n10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2016.02.012\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2014.0699\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1111/1523-1747.ep13075039\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.05.012\n10.1089/ten.TEB.2009.0352\n10.1016/S1369-7021(12)70197-9\n10.1016/0735-1097(89)90360-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310738\n10.1007/978-3-319-10972-5_1\n10.18632/oncotarget.10945\n10.1007/s12265-011-9303-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.3892/etm.2017.5015\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(20000405)68:1<106::AID-BIT13<3.0.CO;2-3"}

The aim of this project is to further investigate its unique genetic background, clinical manifestations, and underlying structural changes.\nWe recruited 885 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) probands and their families internationally. Targeted next-generation sequencing of sudden cardiac death (SCD) genes was performed. The role of the identified variants was assessed using histological techniques and computational modeling.\nTwelve PRKAG2 syndrome kindreds harboring 5 distinct variants were identified. The clinical penetrance of 25 carriers was 100.0%. Twenty-two family members died of SCD or heart failure (HF). All probands developed bradycardia (HRmin, 36.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.8\u202fbpm) and cardiac conduction defects, and 33% had evidence of atrial fibrillation/paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) and 67% had ventricular preexcitation, respectively. Some carriers presented with apical hypertrophy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal insufficiency. Histological study revealed reduced AMPK activity and major cardiac channels in the heart tissue with K485E mutation. Computational modelling suggests that K485E disrupts the salt bridge connecting the \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits of AMPK, R302Q/P decreases the binding affinity for ATP, T400N and H401D alter the orientation of H383 and R531 residues, thus altering nucleotide binding, and N488I and L341S lead to structural instability in the Bateman domain, which disrupts the intramolecular regulation.\nIncluding 4 families with 3 new mutations, we describe a cohort of 12 kindreds with PRKAG2 syndrome with novel pathogenic mechanisms by computational modelling.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of omega-3 and/or coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on hypercholesterolemia-induced atherosclerosis. Rats were divided into five groups; (1): served as the negative control, (2): served as hypercholesterolemic (HC) control, (3): HC-rats administrated omega-3 orally, (4): HC-rats administrated CoQ10 orally, and (5): HC-rats administered the combination treatment of both omega-3 and CoQ10. Lipid profile was assayed and cardiovascular risk indices were calculated. Serum levels of Adiponectin (APN) and creatine kinase (CK-MB) were determined using ELISA. Besides, oxidative stress markers, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) were assayed in the heart homogenate. Histopathological investigation of the aortae and heart tissues were investigated. The results revealed that atherogenic HC-rats demonstrated a significant elevation in lipid profiles, except for HDL-C, along with decreased levels of APN, but increased CK-MB activities. Hypercholesterolemia increased lipid peroxidation, reduced NO production, and decreased GSH content in the cardiac tissue. Treatment of atherogenic HC-rats with omega-3 and/or CoQ10 improved dyslipidemia and ameliorated most of the HC-induced biochemical and histopathological changes. The histological observations of aortae and cardiac tissues validated our biochemical results. We concluded that the combined treatment of nutraceuticals such as omega-3 and CoQ10 demonstrated the best outcome, demonstrating their anti-hyperlipidemic, cardioprotective, and atheroprotective potentials. Together, this study supports a beneficial role of dietary co-administration of omega-3 and CoQ10 in obese patients who are prone to develop cardiovascular disorders.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2020-04-08", "authors": ["GhadhaIbrahim Fouad"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03659"}

{"title": "Various subtypes of phosphodiesterase inhibitors differentially regulate pulmonary vein and sinoatrial node electrical activities.", "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase (PDE)3-5 are expressed in cardiac tissue and play critical roles in the pathogenesis of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. PDE inhibitors are widely used in the clinic, but their effects on the electrical activity of the heart are not well understood. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of various PDE inhibitors on spontaneous cardiac activity and compare those effects between sinoatrial nodes (SANs) and pulmonary veins (PVs). Conventional microelectrodes were used to record action potentials in isolated rabbit SAN and PV tissue preparations, before and after administration of different concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 \u00b5M) of milrinone (PDE3 inhibitor), rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) and sildenafil (PDE5 inhibitor), with or without the application of isoproterenol (cAMP and PKA activator), KT5823 (PKG inhibitor) or H89 (PKA inhibitor). Milrinone (1 and 10 \u00b5M) increased the spontaneous activity in PVs by 10.6\u00b14.9 and 16.7\u00b15.3% and in SANs by 9.3\u00b14.3 and 20.7\u00b14.6%, respectively. In addition, milrinone (1 and 10 \u00b5M) induced the occurrence of triggered activity (0/8 vs. 5/8; P<0.005) in PVs. Rolipram increased PV spontaneous activity by 7.5\u00b11.3-9.5\u00b14.0%, although this was not significant, and did not alter SAN spontaneous activity. Sildenafil reduced spontaneous activity in PVs to a greater extent than that seen in SANs. Both KT5823 and H89 suppressed milrinone-increased PV spontaneous activity. In the presence of isoproterenol, milrinone did not alter isoproterenol-induced PV arrhythmogenesis, suggesting that the effects of PDE3 are mediated by the protein kinase G and protein kinase A signaling pathways.

The analysis of circulating miRNAs in response to exercise would provide a deeper understanding of the molecular response to physical activity and valuable information for clinical practice. Here, eight male college students were recruited to participate in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and 1 h acute exercise training (AET). Blood samples were collected and serum miRNAs involved in angiogenesis, inflammation and enriched in muscle and/or cardiac tissues were analyzed before and after cardiopulmonary exercise and acute exercise. The miRNAs we detected were miR-1, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-126, miR-133a, miR-133b, miR-146, miR155, miR-208a, miR-208b, miR-210, miR-221, miR-222, miR-328, miR-378, miR-499, and miR-940. We found that serum miR-20a was decreased significantly after CPET and serum miR-21 was increased after AET. In addition, no robust correlation was identified between the changes of these miRNAs and makers of cardiac function and exercise capacity, which indicates a distinct adaptation of these miRNAs to exercise.

{"title": "Capturing the Cardiac Injury Response of Targeted Cell Populations via Cleared Heart Three-Dimensional Imaging.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease outranks all other causes of death and is responsible for a staggering 31% of mortalities worldwide. This disease manifests in cardiac injury, primarily in the form of an acute myocardial infarction. With little resilience following injury, the once healthy cardiac tissue will be replaced by fibrous, non-contractile scar tissue and often be a prelude to heart failure. To identify novel treatment options in regenerative medicine, research has focused on vertebrates with innate regenerative capabilities. One such model organism is the neonatal mouse, which responds to cardiac injury with robust myocardial regeneration. In order to induce an injury in the neonatal mouse that is clinically relevant, we have developed a surgery to occlude the left anterior descending artery (LAD), mirroring a myocardial infarction triggered by atherosclerosis in the human heart. When matched with the technology to track changes both within cardiomyocytes and non-myocyte populations, this model provides us with a platform to identify the mechanisms that guide heart regeneration. Gaining insight into changes in cardiac cell populations following injury once relied heavily on methods such as tissue sectioning and histological examination, which are limited to two-dimensional analysis and often damage the tissue in the process. Moreover, these methods lack the ability to trace changes in cell lineages, instead providing merely a snapshot of the injury response. Here, we describe how technologically advanced methods in lineage tracing models, whole organ clearing, and three-dimensional (3D) whole-mount microscopy can be used to elucidate mechanisms of cardiac repair. With our protocol for neonatal mouse myocardial infarction surgery, tissue clearing, and 3D whole organ imaging, the complex pathways that induce cardiomyocyte proliferation can be unraveled, revealing novel therapeutic targets for cardiac regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2020-04-07", "authors": ["Rebecca JSalamon", "ZihengZhang", "Ahmed IMahmoud"], "doi": "10.3791/60482"}
{"title": "Slicing and Culturing Pig Hearts under Physiological Conditions.", "abstract": "Many novel drugs fail in clinical studies due to cardiotoxic side effects as the currently available in vitro assays and in vivo animal models poorly predict human cardiac liabilities, posing a multi-billion-dollar burden on the pharmaceutical industry. Hence, there is a worldwide unmet medical need for better approaches to identify drug cardiotoxicity before undertaking costly and time consuming 'first in man' trials. Currently, only immature cardiac cells (human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes [hiPSC-CMs]) are used to test therapeutic efficiency and drug toxicity as they are the only human cardiac cells that can be cultured for prolonged periods required to test drug efficacy and toxicity. However, a single cell type cannot replicate the phenotype of the complex 3D heart tissue which is formed of multiple cell types. Importantly, the effect of drugs needs to be tested on adult cardiomyocytes, which have different characteristics and toxicity responses compared to immature hiPSC-CMs. Culturing human heart slices is a promising model of intact human myocardium. This technology provides access to a complete multicellular system that mimics the human heart tissue and reflects the physiological or pathological conditions of the human myocardium. Recently, through optimization of the culture media components and the culture conditions to include continuous electrical stimulation at 1.2 Hz and intermittent oxygenation of the culture medium, we developed a new culture system setup that preserves viability and functionality of human and pig heart slices for 6 days in culture. In the current protocol, we are detailing the method for slicing and culturing pig heart as an example. The same protocol is used to culture slices from human, dog, sheep, or cat hearts.

Therefore, assessment of the environmental risk factors and heavy metals induced toxicity have become critical for reducing the consequences of metals pollutants. Previously, we reported heavy metals induced nephrotoxicity in non-diabetic and diabetic rats. Here, we extended our analysis by examining the heavy metals induced organs (heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, and spleen) damage in diabetic and non-diabetic Wistar rats using histopathology and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Following the generation of the diabetic rat model, the animals were exposed to heavy metals including lead (Pb), arsenic (As), manganese (Mn) and cadmium (Cd). Both non-diabetic and diabetic rats were exposed to heavy metals for 30 days and subsequently, the heart, kidney, liver, pancreas and spleen tissues were examined. Heavy metal treatment resulted in irregularly arranged myofibrils and vacuolization in the heart tissue of metal treated groups as evident from hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining. The kidney tissue of rats treated with heavy metals showed tubular degeneration, fibrosis, hemorrhage, and vacuolation. The liver of the heavy metals treated rats exhibited cellular degeneration and necrosis. The pancreatic tissue of streptozotocin injected untreated and metal treated rats revealed severe degeneration, necrosis, degranulation, shrinkage, and depression in the islets of Langerhans. Increased red pulp area and congestion were observed in the spleen of the metal mixture treated non-diabetic and diabetic rats.

{"title": "The impacts of intrauterine Bisphenol A exposure on pregnancy and expression of miRNAs related to heart development and diseases in animal model.", "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the impact of BPA exposure on pregnancy and foetuses on cardiac tissues and the expression of cardiac microRNAs (miRNAs) related to heart development and diseases. Pregnancy is known to be the \"critical windows\" in determining the offspring physical and cells development in their life after birth. The increment of the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a later stage of life has been reported by few studies demonstrated from prenatal exposure of BPA. BPA has been shown to alter miRNAs expression profiles for organ development, regeneration and metabolic functions. These alterations have been associated with the risk of CVDs. However, the associations between pregnancy outcomes and miRNAs expression in cardiac of mother- and foetuses-exposed to BPA are still not entirely explored. In BPA-exposed pregnant rat groups, a significant weight gained was observed in comparison to control (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Interestingly, significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the first and third trimester of BPA-exposed pregnant rats were also observed (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In BPA-exposed pregnant rats, miR-499-5p was significantly altered in the heart (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Meanwhile, altered miR-17-5p, -208-3p, and -210-3p expressions were observed in all heart of the foetuses from BPA-exposed pregnant rats (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In H&E staining, BPA-exposed foetal hearts showed a sign of fibrosis while BPA-exposed pregnant rats showed muscle remnant. Masson trichrome staining further confirmed the presence of fibrosis observed in BPA-exposed foetal heart and reduced expression of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was also observed in BPA-exposed foetal heart. In summary, altered cardiac miRNAs with histological changes were observed in both mother- and foetus-exposed BPA These findings put forward the importance of future work to further understand how prenatal BPA exposure affect foetuses in their later stage of life.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-04-05", "authors": ["ZatilfarihiahRasdi", "RozianaKamaludin", "SharanizaAb Rahim", "Syed BaharomSyed Ahmad Fuad", "Mohd Hafiz DzarfanOthman", "RosfaiizahSiran", "Noor ShafinaMohd Nor", "NarimahAbdul Hamid Hasani", "Siti HamimahSheikh Abdul Kadir"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-62420-1\n10.1136/bmj.293.6557.1271\n10.1073/pnas.0608791103\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.889048\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.08.024\n10.1016/j.envint.2013.12.007\n10.1289/ehp.1001993\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.04.041\n10.1038/jes.2015.58\n10.1016/j.fct.2012.07.059\n10.3390/toxics2020134\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2007.07.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008673\n10.1289/ehp.1104114\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031109\n10.1001/jama.300.11.1303\n10.1093/toxsci/kfh054\n10.1016/j.envres.2015.07.024\n10.1002/jcb.25276\n10.1096/fj.15-270942\n10.1016/j.ygcen.2016.08.010\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2017.05.001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089096\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2010.04.004\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.90268.2008\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.10.027\n10.1007/BF02976689\n10.1016/j.taap.2003.07.016\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.10.003\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000238442.33463.94\n10.1530/JOE-14-0356\n10.1371/journal.pone.0211689\n10.1038/nprot.2012.125\n10.1210/en.2014-1567\n10.1093/nar/gkr254\n10.3892/etm.2016.3932\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2007.06.008\n10.1289/ehp.7155\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2006.10.002\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2006.12.010\n10.1093/toxsci/kfu022\n10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.035\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.066\n10.4110/in.2011.11.3.135\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.957415\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq167\n10.2174/1874312901206010130\n10.1074/jbc.M800731200\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.687947\n10.1016/j.tiv.2019.01.012"}
{"title": "The Effect of a High-Fat Diet on the Fatty Acid Composition in the Hearts of Mice.", "abstract": "The Western diet can lead to alterations in cardiac function and increase cardiovascular risk, which can be reproduced in animal models by implementing a high-fat diet (HFD). However, the mechanism of these alterations is not fully understood and may be dependent on alterations in heart lipid composition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an HFD on the fatty acid (FA) composition of total lipids, as well as of various lipid fractions in the heart, and on heart function. C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD or standard laboratory diet. The FA composition of chow, serum, heart and skeletal muscle tissues was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cardiac function was evaluated by ultrasonography. Our results showed an unexpected increase in polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) and a significant decrease in monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) in the heart tissue of mice fed the HFD. For comparison, no such effects were observed in skeletal muscle or serum samples. Furthermore, we found that the largest increase in PUFAs was in the sphingolipid fraction, whereas the largest decrease in MUFAs was in the phospholipid and sphingomyelin fractions. The hearts of mice fed an HFD had an increased content of triacylglycerols. Moreover, the HFD treatment altered aortic flow pattern. We did not find significant changes in heart mass or oxidative stress markers between mice fed the HFD and standard diet. The above results suggest that alterations in FA composition in the heart may contribute to deterioration of heart function. A possible mechanism of this phenomenon is the alteration of sphingolipids and phospholipids in the fatty acid profile, which may change the physical properties of these lipids. Since phospho- and sphingolipids are the major components of cell membranes, alterations in their structures in heart cells can result in changes in cell membrane properties.", "journal": "Nutrients", "date": "2020-04-05", "authors": ["AlicjaPakiet", "AgnieszkaJakubiak", "PaulinaMierzejewska", "AgataZwara", "IvanLiakh", "TomaszSledzinski", "AdrianaMika"], "doi": "10.3390/nu12030824\n10.1016/j.hjc.2017.01.022\n10.1161/01.STR.0000135762.89154.92\n10.1093/ajcn.81.2.341\n10.3390/nu10030365\n10.1186/s40168-015-0120-7\n10.1080/19490976.2016.1270811\n10.1038/srep19032\n10.1128/mBio.00903-19\n10.18632/oncotarget.7901\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-3140\n10.3390/nu11071532\n10.1364/BOE.8.003143\n10.3390/nu11071602\n10.1194/jlr.M061275\n10.1096/fj.201700984RR\n10.1371/journal.pone.0191909\n10.1039/C7FO01602F\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.12.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072796\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.03.038\n10.1038/srep21568\n10.1155/2017/9498247\n10.1371/journal.pone.0127991\n10.1073/pnas.1814273116\n10.1007/s11882-013-0404-6\n10.1016/j.jpain.2015.10.006\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.08.078\n10.1038/s41598-018-28663-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0146942\n10.1186/1475-2891-13-61\n10.1371/journal.pone.0192900\n10.1371/journal.pone.0205021\n10.1152/ajpregu.00023.2016\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.05.025\n10.1007/s11906-014-0529-6\n10.1152/ajprenal.00068.2011\n10.1080/07315724.2017.1381053\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.771881\n10.1093/ajcn/72.4.912\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1152/ajpendo.00024.2008\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04737\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.253104\n10.1161/hc0902.104353\n10.1093/ajcn/80.4.1029\n10.1016/j.phrs.2018.03.018\n10.18632/oncotarget.20763\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060931\n10.1194/jlr.M001230\n10.1371/journal.pone.0208396\n10.1152/ajpheart.00139.2008\n10.2337/diabetes.54.12.3530\n10.1186/1475-2840-13-54\n10.1007/s11010-010-0546-y\n10.2337/db07-0481\n10.1038/s41598-017-00306-5\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.08.014\n10.1210/jc.2006-0584\n10.1016/j.pbj.0000000000000012\n10.1186/s12986-019-0401-4\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.04.004\n10.1016/j.bpj.2008.12.3923\n10.1194/jlr.M052308\n10.1111/obr.12475\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00071\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.02.019\n10.1371/journal.pone.0083174\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.05.009\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.02.008\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.049\n10.1016/j.exger.2014.05.001\n10.1007/s10741-007-9034-1\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.04.006\n10.1194/jlr.M800147-JLR200\n10.1007/s11897-013-0133-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.306842\n10.1042/BJ20070392\n10.1172/JCI23354\n10.1186/s12986-018-0252-4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0128515\n10.3390/nu10010106\n10.1007/s11745-001-0714-8\n10.1093/ajcn/72.4.905\n10.1079/BJN19870046\n10.1007/BF02544539\n10.3109/09637486.2015.1077790\n10.3945/an.114.007732\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.012534\n10.1074/jbc.R800046200\n10.3390/ijms19113285\n10.1139/o03-074\n10.1016/0304-4157(84)90005-4\n10.1021/ja00243a010\n10.1074/jbc.M106193200\n10.1194/jlr.D500044-JLR200\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31819b5461\n10.3390/ijms131115447\n10.1093/jn/118.3.290\n10.1021/ja029029o"}
{"title": "Retrotransposition and senescence in mouse heart tissue by viral protein R of human immunodeficiency virus-1.", "abstract": "Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has greatly improved the prognosis of patients with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. However, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a serious issue even in the post-cART era. Viral protein R (Vpr), an accessory gene product of HIV-1, exerts pleiotropic activities such as the induction of DNA damage signals, apoptosis by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, G2/M-phase cell cycle abnormalities, and retrotransposition. Importantly, some of these cellular responses are induced by the trans-acting activity of Vpr. Recently, we established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect Vpr and reported that about 22% of blood samples from 100 HIV-1-positive patients were positive for Vpr. Here, we investigated the biological effects of recombinant Vpr (rVpr) in vivo. We observed that repeated injections of rVpr increased the copy number of long interspersed element-1 (L1) in the heart genome in mice. rVpr also increased the number of cells positive for senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) and fibrosis in the heart. Notably, co-administration of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor reduced the number of rVpr-induced SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells and fibrosis concomitantly with the attenuation of L1 retrotransposition. Interestingly, a Vpr mutant defective for mitochondrial dysfunction also induced heart senescence and increased L1 copy number. Together with a recent report that L1 retrotransposition functions as a molecular basis of senescence, our current data suggest that rVpr-induced L1 retrotransposition is linked with senescence in heart tissue. We would propose that Vpr in the bloodstream may be one of risk factors for CVD, and that its monitoring will lead to well understanding of the heterogeneity and multifactorial mechanisms of CVD in HIV-1 patients.", "journal": "Experimental and molecular pathology", "date": "2020-04-04", "authors": ["MikakoUeno", "AkihiroMatsunaga", "YoichiTeratake", "YukihitoIshizaka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexmp.2020.104433"}

{"title": "Matrix stiffness controls cardiac fibroblast activation through regulating YAP via AT", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathway leading to heart failure and involves continued activation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) into myofibroblasts during myocardium damage, causing excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and thus increases matrix stiffness. Increasing evidence has shown that stiffened matrix plays an important role in promoting CF activation and cardiac fibrosis, and several signaling factors mediating CF mechanotransduction have been identified. However, the key molecules that perceive matrix stiffness to regulate CF activation remain\u00a0to be further explored. Here, we detected significantly increased expression and nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in native fibrotic cardiac tissues. By using mechanically regulated in vitro cell culture models, we found that a stiff matrix-induced high expression and nuclear localization of YAP in CFs, accompanied by enhanced cell activation. We also demonstrated that YAP knockdown decreased fibrogenic response of CFs and that YAP overexpression promoted CF activation, indicating that YAP plays an important role in mediating matrix stiffness-induced CF activation. Further mechanistic studies revealed that the YAP pathway is an important signaling branch downstream of angiotensin II type 1 receptor in CF mechanotransduction.

This study aimed to examine the histological and molecular changes in cardiac tissue of HFD-fed rats. Eight-week old male Wistar rats were fed either HFD or normal chow diet for 16\u00a0weeks and then assessed for changes in metabolic and cardiac homeostasis (n\u00a0=\u00a010 each group). 16\u00a0weeks on HFD resulted in obesity, dyslipidemia and altered glucose tolerance but no hypertension. Histological examination of Masson's trichrome stained-cardiac sections revealed massive fibrotic changes, while immunoblotting analysis showed higher expressions of collagens I and III, and fibronectin in cardiac tissue of HFD-fed rats. The expressions of transforming growth factor beta1 and the phosphorylation of its downstream target, Smad3, were significantly increased in cardiac tissue of HFD-fed rats. Activation of endothelial-mesenchymal transition was promoted in hearts of HFD-fed rats, as evidenced by down-regulation of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, while upregulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Consumption of HFD induced dysregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase/glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta signaling in cardiac tissue of rats. This was coupled with down-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream targets in cardiac tissue of HFD-fed rats, as well as enhanced the oxidative stress and inflammatory burden. These results demonstrate that moderate-term consumption of HFD can enhance oxidative stress, induce inflammation, and activate the fibrogenic pathways in cardiac tissue of rats which stimulate fibrotic remodeling. Our findings may implicate the dysregulation of Nrf2 signaling as a putative mechanism for this effect.", "journal": "Molecular biology reports", "date": "2020-04-03", "authors": ["Rania AElrashidy"], "doi": "10.1007/s11033-020-05360-3"}

We assumed that co-therapy with apelin and angiotensin 1-7 (Ang (1-7)) may have synergistic cardioprotective effects against isoproterenol-induced heart failure. Methods The animals were randomly assigned to one of eight groups of seven animals in each group as follows: (1) control I (saline; IP injection) (1) control II (saline; via mini-osmotic pump) (3) ISO (5 mg/ kg; IP), (4) Apelin (20\u03bcg/ kg; IP), (5) Ang (1-7) (30 \u03bcg/kg/day; via mini-osmotic pump), (6) Apelin+ISO, (7) Ang (1-7)+ISO, (8) Apelin+Ang (1-7)+ISO.

{"title": "Molecular Signatures of Sinus Node Dysfunction Induce Structural Remodeling in the Right Atrial Tissue.", "abstract": "The sinus node (SN) is located at the apex of the cardiac conduction system, and SN dysfunction (SND)-characterized by electrical remodeling-is generally attributed to idiopathic fibrosis or ischemic injuries in the SN. SND is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, including syncope, heart failure, and atrial arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. One of the histological SND hallmarks is degenerative atrial remodeling that is associated with conduction abnormalities and increased right atrial refractoriness. Although SND is frequently accompanied by increased fibrosis in the right atrium (RA), its molecular basis still remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated whether SND can induce significant molecular changes that account for the structural remodeling of RA. Towards this, we employed a rabbit model of experimental SND, and then compared the genome-wide RNA expression profiles in RA between SND-induced rabbits and sham-operated controls to identify the differentially expressed transcripts. The accompanying gene enrichment analysis revealed extensive pro-fibrotic changes within 7 days after the SN ablation, including activation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling and alterations in the levels of extracellular matrix components and their regulators. Importantly, our findings suggest that periostin, a matricellular factor that regulates the development of cardiac tissue, might play a key role in mediating TGF-\u03b2-signaling-induced aberrant atrial remodeling. In conclusion, the present study provides valuable information regarding the molecular signatures underlying SND-induced atrial remodeling, and indicates that periostin can be potentially used in the diagnosis of fibroproliferative cardiac dysfunctions.", "journal": "Molecules and cells", "date": "2020-04-03", "authors": ["Seung-YoungRoh", "Ji YeonKim", "Hyo KyeongCha", "Hye YoungLim", "YoungranPark", "Kwang-NoLee", "JaeminShim", "Jong-IlChoi", "Young-HoonKim", "Gi HoonSon"], "doi": "10.14348/molcells.2020.2164\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.001340\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109662\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.05.043\n10.1016/S0140-6736(97)03425-9\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00073-4\n10.1016/S0002-9149(96)90394-X\n10.1002/art.30284\n10.1038/srep23757\n10.1038/srep46404\n10.1056/NEJM200005113421902\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.616011\n10.1677/jme.1.02138\n10.1074/jbc.RA117.001113\n10.1007/s00380-016-0808-z\n10.1093/cvr/cvq390\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.106.080994\n10.1111/pai.12575\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.03.056\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.018011\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.09.018\n10.1074/jbc.M109.051961\n10.1038/sdata.2018.220\n10.1056/NEJMoa013040\n10.1007/s00395-017-0659-5\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.07.046\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.06.002\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00468.2006\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000149141.81230.c6\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00480.2012\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05098.x\n10.1074/jbc.M109.088864\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2011.02255.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.91.5.1588\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000058164.68127.F2\n10.1007/s00441-011-1201-y\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01218\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr022\n10.1002/jcb.21224\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.149047\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.3389/fmed.2017.00052\n10.1093/cvr/cvy224\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.030\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000121734.47409.AA\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00432-X\n10.1084/jem.20071297\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.006\n10.1093/cvr/24.9.741\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.159517\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06265\n10.1080/14779072.2017.1299005\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000074905.22908.A6\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.158\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.7.1954\n10.1074/jbc.M603721200\n10.3892/mmr.2016.5308\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.08.003\n10.2332/allergolint.13-RAI-0685\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.09.013\n10.1038/s41598-018-27064-2\n10.1007/s00380-018-1146-0\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.02.021"}

Diabetes is a major risk factor for cardiac dysfunctions, and olive oil prevents diabetes-induced adverse myocardial remodeling. Objective The study aimed\u00a0to evaluate the effects of olive oil against streptozotocin-induced cardiac dysfunction in animal models of diabetes and ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Methods Diabetes was induced in male rats with a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg i.p), rats were treated for five, 15, or 56 days with olive oil (1 ml/kg p.o). Control animals received saline. Blood glucose and body weight were monitored every two weeks. At the end of the treatment, rats were sacrificed and hearts were isolated for mounting on Langedorff's apparatus. The effect of olive oil on oxidative stress and histopathological changes in the cardiac tissues were studied. Results The initial blood glucose and body weight were not significantly different in the control and olive-treated animals. Streptozotocin\u00a0(60 mg/kg i.p) caused a significant increase in the blood glucose of animals as compared to saline-treated animals.\u00a0The control, saline-treated diabetic animals exhibited a 100% incidence of I/R-induced ventricular fibrillation, which was reduced to 0% with olive oil treatment. The protective effects of olive oil were evident after 15 and 56 days of treatment.\u00a0Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker (1 \u00b5m/L) showed similar results and protected the I/R-induced cardiac disorders. The cardiac tissues isolated from diabetic rats exhibited marked pathological changes in the cardiomyocytes, including decreased glutathione (GSH) and increased oxidative stress (malondialdehyde; MDA). Pretreatment of animals with olive oil (1 ml/kg p.o) increased GSH and decreased MDA levels. Olive oil also improved the diabetic-induced histopathological changes in the cardiomyocytes.

Sixty percent total body surface area (TBSA) scald burned rats (\u00b1sildenafil) were used in this study. A transmission electron microscope (TEM), real-time qPCR, O2K-respirometer, and electron transport chain assays were used to characterized molecular function. Cardiac mitochondrial morphological shapes were disfigured with a decline in mitochondrial number, area, and size, resulting in deficiency of cardiac mitochondrial replication. Burn induced a decrease in all mitDNA encoded genes. State 3 oxygen consumption was significantly decreased. Mitochondrial complex I substrate-energized or complex II substrate-energized and both of respiratory control ratio (RCRs) were decreased after burn. All mitochondrial complex activity except complex II were decreased in the burn group, correlating with decreases in mitochondrial ATP and MnSOD activity. Sildenafil, a inhibitor of the PDE5A-cGMP-PKG pathway, preserved the mitochondrial structure, respiratory chain efficiency and energy status in cardiac tissue.

However, the fabrication of hydrogels with strong mechanical properties, high adhesion strength, and hemostatic efficiency remains a big challenge. Inspired by the great adhesive behavior of mussels and Arion subfuscus, novel adhesive and hemostatic polyacrylamide-tannic acid-kaolin (PAAm-TA-KA) hydrogels were reported in this work. The hydrogels displayed high strength and toughness due to their physical and chemical crosslinking structures. The abundant catechol groups on tannic acid endow the hydrogels with strong and durable adhesion strength of up to 500\u00a0kPa on porcine skin. When applied onto human skin, the hydrogels could be easily peeled off without leaving any remains and causing any damages. The kaolin nanoparticles incorporated in the PAAm-TA-KA hydrogels not only served as a physical crosslinking agent, but an activator of the blood clotting factor FXII for accelerating the formation of thrombus. The strong tissue adhesion and blood coagulant potential of the PAAm-TA-KA hydrogels imparted them high hemostatic efficiency.

{"title": "Design and characterization of an electroconductive scaffold for cardiomyocytes based biomedical assays.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a major cause of mortality worldwide. Accessibility to heart tissue is limited due to sampling issues and lack of appropriate culture conditions. In addition, animal models are not an ideal choice for physiological, pharmacological, and fundamental evaluations in the cardiovascular field due to interspecies differences. Hence, there is an inevitable need for functional in vitro cardiac models. In this study, we have synthesized a novel electroconductive scaffold comprised of cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) derived pre-cardiogel (pCG) blended with polypyrrole (Ppy). Our data revealed that 2.5% (w/v) pyrrole (Py) had the highest possible Py ratio that provided pCG-Ppy gel formation. The prepared mixture was fabricated into a scaffold by using the freeze-dried method. The scaffolds had open interconnected pores that ranged from 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0\u03bcm for the cardiogel (CG)-Ppy to 74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026\u00a0\u03bcm for the CG scaffolds, with no alterations in vital ECM components of collagen, polysaccharides, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Incorporation of Ppy increased the CG stiffness with a final complex modulus from 80 pa to 140 pa. The CG-Ppy group had significantly greater electrical conductivity than the CG group. Scaffolds supported neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte (NMCM) adhesion, viability, cardiac-specific gene expression, and spontaneous beating up to 14\u00a0days after seeding. Among the fabricated hydrogels, the CG-Ppy group resulted in the synchronous beating of cardiomyocyte clusters and upregulation of cardiac genes involved in cardiac muscle contraction (cardiac troponin T [cTNT]) and cardiomyocyte electrical coupling (connexin 43 [Cx43]). Thus, this ECM-based electro-conductive scaffold might provide a promising substrate for constructing in vitro cardiac models for drug testing, disease modeling, developmental studies, and cardiac regenerative approaches.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "In Situ Expansion, Differentiation, and Electromechanical Coupling of Human Cardiac Muscle in a 3D Bioprinted, Chambered Organoid.", "abstract": "One goal of cardiac tissue engineering is the generation of a living, human pump in vitro that could replace animal models and eventually serve as an in vivo therapeutic. Models that replicate the geometrically complex structure of the heart, harboring chambers and large vessels with soft biomaterials, can be achieved using 3-dimensional bioprinting. Yet, inclusion of contiguous, living muscle to support pump function has not been achieved. This is largely due to the challenge of attaining high densities of cardiomyocytes-a notoriously nonproliferative cell type. An alternative strategy is to print with human induced pluripotent stem cells, which can proliferate to high densities and fill tissue spaces, and subsequently differentiate them into cardiomyocytes in situ.\nTo develop a bioink capable of promoting human induced pluripotent stem cell proliferation and cardiomyocyte differentiation to 3-dimensionally print electromechanically functional, chambered organoids composed of contiguous cardiac muscle.\nWe optimized a photo-crosslinkable formulation of native ECM (extracellular matrix) proteins and used this bioink to 3-dimensionally print human induced pluripotent stem cell-laden structures with 2 chambers and a vessel inlet and outlet. After human induced pluripotent stem cells proliferated to a sufficient density, we differentiated the cells within the structure and demonstrated function of the resultant human chambered muscle pump. Human chambered muscle pumps demonstrated macroscale beating and continuous action potential propagation with responsiveness to drugs and pacing. The connected chambers allowed for perfusion and enabled replication of pressure/volume relationships fundamental to the study of heart function and remodeling with health and disease.\nThis advance represents a critical step toward generating macroscale tissues, akin to aggregate-based organoids, but with the critical advantage of harboring geometric structures essential to the pump function of cardiac muscle. Looking forward, human chambered organoids of this type might also serve as a test bed for cardiac medical devices and eventually lead to therapeutic tissue grafting.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2020-04-02", "authors": ["Molly EKupfer", "Wei-HanLin", "VasanthRavikumar", "KaiyanQiu", "LuWang", "LingGao", "Didarul BBhuiyan", "MeganLenz", "JeffreyAi", "Ryan RMahutga", "DeWayneTownsend", "JianyiZhang", "Michael CMcAlpine", "Elena GTolkacheva", "Brenda MOgle"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316155"}

Over 1500 mutations have been associated with HCM, of which the majority reside in genes encoding sarcomere proteins, the cardiac contractile building blocks. Several mutation-mediated disease mechanisms have been identified, with proof for gene- and mutation-specific cellular perturbations.

{"title": "Direct Cardiac Reprogramming with Engineered miRNA Scaffolds.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease is a predominant cause of death worldwide. The loss or death of cardiomyocytes due to restricted blood flow often results in a cardiac injury. Myofibroblasts replace these injured cardiomyocytes to preserve structural integrity. However, the depleted cardiomyocytes lead to cardiac dysfunction such as pathological cardiac dilation, reduced cardiac contraction, and fibrosis. Repair and regeneration of myocardium are the best possible therapy for end-stage heart failure patients because the current cardiomyocytes restoration therapies are limited to heart transplantation only. The emergence of interests to directly reprogram a mammalian heart with minimal regenerative capacity holds a promising future in the field of cardiovascular regenerative medicine. Repair and regeneration become the two crucial factors in the field of cardiovascular regenerative medicine since heart muscles have no substitutes, like heart valves or blood vessels. Cardiac regeneration includes strategies to reprogram with diverse factors like small molecules, genetic and epigenetic regulators. However, there are some constraints like low efficacy, immunogenic problems, and unsafe delivery systems that pose a daunting challenge in human trial translations. Hence, there is a need for a holistic nanoscale approach in regulating cell fate effectively and efficiently with a safer delivery and a suitable microenvironment that mimics the extracellular matrix. In this review, we have discussed the current state-of-the-art techniques, challenges in direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiac muscle, and prospects of biomaterials in miRNA delivery and cardiac regeneration predominantly during the past decade (2008-2019).", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2020-03-29", "authors": ["PriyadharshniMuniyandi", "ToruMaekawa", "TatsuroHanajiri", "VivekanandanPalaninathan"], "doi": "10.2174/1381612826666200327161112"}
{"title": "Fast in vivo detection of myocardial norepinephrine levels in the beating porcine heart.", "abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system modulates cardiac function by controlling key parameters such as chronotropy and inotropy. Sympathetic control of ventricular function occurs through extrinsic innervation arising from the stellate ganglia and thoracic sympathetic chain. In the healthy heart, sympathetic release of norepinephrine (NE) results in positive modulation of chronotropy, inotropy, and dromotropy, significantly increasing cardiac output. However, in the setting of myocardial infarction or injury, sympathetic activation persists, contributing to heart failure and increasing the risk of arrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. Methodologies for detection of norepinephrine in cardiac tissue are limited. Present techniques rely on microdialysis for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED), radioimmunoassay, or other immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although significant information about the release and action of norepinephrine has been obtained with these methodologies, they are limited in temporal resolution, require large sample volumes, and provide results with a significant delay after sample collection (hours to weeks). In this study, we report a novel approach for measurement of interstitial cardiac norepinephrine, using minimally invasive, electrode-based, fast-scanning cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) applied in a beating porcine heart. The first multispatial and high temporal resolution, multichannel measurements of NE release in vivo are provided.

Increasing evidence suggests that dihydromyricetin (DHM) can be used to effectively treat cardiomyopathy. In this study, we investigated whether DHM affects the expression of miR-34a in DCM.\nThe expression of miR-34a in high-glucose-induced cardiomyocytes and in the heart tissue of diabetic mice was determined by microRNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Lipofectamine 3000 was used to transfect cardiomyocytes with miR-34a inhibitor, miR-34a mimics, and miR-control. These agents were intravenously injected into the tail vein of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Autophagy and apoptosis were assessed in high-glucose-induced cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue in diabetic mice by western blotting, immunofluorescence, Masson staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E), and electron microscopy.\nDHM clearly ameliorated the cardiac dysfunction in the diabetic mice. The expression of miR-34a was up-regulated in high-glucose-induced cardiomyocytes and in the hearts of diabetic mice, thus impairing autophagy. Treatment with DHM decreased the expression of miR-34a and rescued the impairment of autophagy in high-glucose-induced cardiomyocytes and in the heart tissue of diabetic mice, while the miR-34a mimic offset the effect of DHM with respect to the development of DCM by inhibiting autophagy.\nBy decreasing the expression of miR-34a, DHM restores impaired autophagy, and thus ameliorates DCM.

Using a proteomic approach, we found that CYP2J2 expression is lower in cardiac tissue from patients with cardiomyopathy compared to controls. In order to better elucidate the complex role played by CYP2J2 in cardiac cells, we performed targeted silencing of CYP2J2 expression in human adult ventricular cardiomyocytes and interrogated whole genome transcriptional responses. We found that knockdown of CYP2J2 elicits widespread alterations in gene expression of ventricular cardiomyocytes and leads to the activation of a diverse repertoire of programs, including those involved in ion channel signaling, development, extracellular matrix, and metabolism. Several members of the differentially up-regulated ion channel module have well-known pathogenetic roles in cardiac dysrhythmias. By leveraging causal network and upstream regulator analysis, we identified several candidate drivers of the observed transcriptional response to CYP2J2 silencing; these master regulators have been implicated in aberrant cardiac remodeling, heart failure, and myocyte injury and repair. Collectively, our study demonstrates that CYP2J2 plays a central and multifaceted role in cardiomyocyte homeostasis and provides a framework for identifying critical regulators and pathways influenced by this gene in cardiovascular health and disease.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-03-27", "authors": ["Eric AEvangelista", "TheresaAliwarga", "NonaSotoodehnia", "Paul NJensen", "BarbaraMcKnight", "Rozenn NLemaitre", "Rheem ATotah", "Sina AGharib"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-62174-w\n10.2174/1389450118666170125144557\n10.1016/j.abb.2008.01.002\n10.1517/17425250902932923\n10.1016/j.tips.2006.11.002\n10.1016/j.abb.2009.05.006\n10.1152/ajpcell.00402.2006\n10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012896\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.12.012\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.07.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.00783.2006\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2010.10.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0073490\n10.1016/0092-8674(95)90359-3\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.02.021\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.09.064\n10.1152/ajpcell.00335.2018\n10.1093/cvr/cvu185\n10.1161/01.RES.0000264081.78659.45\n10.1126/scisignal.2005262\n10.1161/01.RES.0000139436.89654.c8\n10.1038/tpj.2014.82\n10.1172/JCI44824\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.758516\n10.1242/dev.02824\n10.1038/384353a0\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.07.015\n10.1016/0003-2697(85)90442-7\n10.1124/jpet.117.243113\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1038/nbt.3519\n10.1073/pnas.181597298\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1038/nprot.2007.324\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btm369\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt703"}

{"title": "Systemic and Cardiac Alterations After Long Bone Fracture.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to reveal possible consequences of long-bone fracture on cardiac tissue and to analyze the role of systemically elevated danger associated molecular patterns, complement anaphylatoxins and cytokines. Blood samples of mice, pigs, and humans after a fracture were analyzed by ELISAs for complement component 5a (C5a), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and extracellular histones. In vivo results were completed by in vitro experiments with human cardiomyocytes treated with TNF and extracellular histones. The influence of histones and human plasma after fracture on isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) was investigated. An elevation of TNF, C5a, and extracellular histones after long bone fracture was measured. Moreover, the appearance of systemic troponin I levels was observed and structural changes in connexin 43 and desmin were detected. Further, the presence of TNF leads to elevation of reactive oxygen species, troponin I release, and histone appearance in supernatant of human cardiomyocytes. Incubation of human PMNs with histones and plasma of patients after fracture lead to formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Present results suggest that structural alterations in the heart might be consequences of the complement activation, the release of extracellular histones, and the systemic TNF elevation in the context of a long bone fracture.", "journal": "Shock (Augusta, Ga.)", "date": "2020-03-25", "authors": ["BirteWeber", "InaLackner", "DeborahKnecht", "Christian KarlBraun", "FlorianGebhard", "MarkusHuber-Lang", "FrankHildebrand", "KlemensHorst", "Hans-ChristophPape", "AnitaIgnatius", "HubertSchrezenmeier", "MelanieHaffner-Luntzer", "MiriamKalbitz"], "doi": "10.1097/SHK.0000000000001536"}

{"title": "Atrial fibrillation and cardiac fibrosis: A review on the potential of extracellular matrix proteins as biomarkers.", "abstract": "The involvement of fibrosis as an underlying pathology in heart diseases is becoming increasingly clear. In recent years, fibrosis has been granted a causative role in heart diseases and is now emerging as a major contributor to Atrial Fibrillation (AF) pathogenesis. AF is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the clinic, but the substrate for AF is still being debated. Consensus in the field is a combination of cardiac tissue remodeling, inflammation and genetic predisposition. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is subject of growing investigation, since measuring circulatory biomarkers of ECM formation and degradation provides both diagnostic and prognostic information. However, fibrosis is not just fibrosis. Each specific collagen biomarker holds information on regulatory mechanisms, as well as information about which section of the ECM is being remodeled, providing a detailed description of cardiac tissue homeostasis. This review entails an overview of the implication of fibrosis in AF, the different collagens and their significance, and the potential of using biomarkers of ECM remodeling as tools for understanding AF pathogenesis and identifying patients at risk for further disease progression.", "journal": "Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology", "date": "2020-03-25", "authors": ["Alexander LReese-Petersen", "Morten SOlesen", "Morten AKarsdal", "Jesper HSvendsen", "FedericaGenovese"], "doi": "10.1016/j.matbio.2020.03.005"}
{"title": "Electromechanical Assessment of Optogenetically Modulated Cardiomyocyte Activity.", "abstract": "Over the past two decades, optogenetic tools have been established as potent means to modulate cell-type specific activity in excitable tissues, including the heart. While Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a common tool to depolarize the membrane potential in cardiomyocytes (CM), potentially eliciting action potentials (AP), an effective tool for reliable silencing of CM activity has been missing. It has been suggested to use anion channelrhodopsins (ACR) for optogenetic inhibition. Here, we describe a protocol to assess the effects of activating the natural ACR GtACR1 from Guillardia theta in cultured rabbit CM. Primary readouts are electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings and optical tracking of CM contractions, both performed while applying different patterns of light stimulation. The protocol includes CM isolation from rabbit heart, seeding and culturing of the cells for up to 4 days, transduction via adenovirus coding for the light-gated chloride channel, preparation of patch-clamp and carbon fiber setups, data collection and analysis. Using the patch-clamp technique in whole-cell configuration allows one to record light-activated currents (in voltage-clamp mode, V-clamp) and AP (current-clamp mode, I-clamp) in real time. In addition to patch-clamp experiments, we conduct contractility measurements for functional assessment of CM activity without disturbing the intracellular milieu. To do so, cells are mechanically preloaded using carbon fibers and contractions are recorded by tracking changes in sarcomere length and carbon fiber distance. Data analysis includes assessment of AP duration from I-clamp recordings, peak currents from V-clamp recordings and force calculation from carbon fiber measurements. The described protocol can be applied to the testing of biophysical effects of different optogenetic actuators on CM activity, a prerequisite for the development of a mechanistic understanding of optogenetic experiments in cardiac tissue and whole hearts.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2020-03-24", "authors": ["Ramona AKopton", "CinthiaBuchmann", "RobinMoss", "PeterKohl", "R\u00e9miPeyronnet", "FranziskaSchneider-Warme"], "doi": "10.3791/60490"}

Breast cancer patients with human epidermal factor receptor-2 (Her-2) overexpression could be indicated for both radiation and anti-Her2 target therapy. We aimed to investigate the early detection of radiation and Trastuzumab (TRZ) induced acute cardiotoxicity in mice. In the present study, the heart of animal was subjected to irradiation (IR, 14 Gy/1 Fx), TRZ was intraperitonealy (i.p.) administrated to mice in 2 weeks (6 fractions). The IR plus TRZ group received heart IR after TRZ. We found that body weight of mouse in treatment groups reduced significantly as compared with that of mouse in control group (P<0.05). At day 21, the diastolic function of mice decreased significantly in IR plus TRZ group compared with control group measured by E/E' parameter using echocardiography (57.72 vs 40.82, P<0.05). The left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) and interventricular septum (IVS) were also increased significantly in diastolic phase at day 21 in the combined group compared with TRZ alone (LVPW: 0.95 mm vs 0.70 mm, P<0.05; IVS: 0.94 mm vs 0.65 mm P<0.05). Moreover, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of cardiac tissue showed that the arrangement of myocardial cell was disordered in the combined group with vacuolar and adipocyte changes, as well as the loose of structure of myocardial cells and the pyknosis of the nucleus. Moderate damage was observed in irradiation-treated group and TRZ-treated group. The expressions of \u03b3-H2AX, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) were remarkedly appeared in co-treatment group. Heart irradiation combined with TRZ treatment simultaneously might cause acute cardiac toxicity in terms of the parameter of E/E', LVPW and IVS.

{"title": "Circulating MicroRNAs in Plasma Decrease in Response to Sarcopenia in the Elderly.", "abstract": "sarcopenia has been defined as the aging-related disease with the declined mass, strength, and function of skeletal muscle, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elders. Current diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia have not been agreed internationally, and the clinical diagnostic biomarkers for sarcopenia have not been identified. Circulating miRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) have recently been characterized as novel biomarkers for sarcopenia. However, the change of circulating miRNAs in response to sarcopenia are still not fully understood. Here, we enrolled a total of 93 elderly patients clinically diagnosed with sarcopenia and matching 93 non-sarcopenia elderly in this study. Specifically, levels of candidate circulating miRNAs which were involved in angiogenesis, inflammation and enriched in muscle and/or cardiac tissues were detected in these two groups. In small-sample screening experiments, plasma miR-155, miR-208b, miR-222, miR-210, miR-328, and miR-499 levels were significantly down-regulated in sarcopenia compared to those who non-sarcopenia. In contrast, miR-1, mir-133a, miR-133b, miR-21, miR-146a, miR-126, miR-221, and miR-20a were not changed significantly. Subsequently, we expanded the sample size to further detection and verification, and found that plasma miR-155, miR-208b, miR-222, miR-210, miR-328, and miR-499 levels in the sarcopenia group were significantly reduced compared to the non-sarcoma group, which is consistent with the results of the small-sample screening experiment. In addition, we showed that ASM/Height2, handgrip strength, knee extension and 4-meter velocity in sarcopenia group were significantly lower than those in non-sarcopenia group. Here we correlated the decrease of miR-208b, miR-499, miR-155, miR-222, miR-328, and miR-210 in sarcopenia group and non-sarcopenia group with diagnostic indexes of sarcopenia (ASM/Height2, Handgrip strength and 4-meter velocity) after adjusting sex. The results showed that miR-208b and miR-155 changes were significantly correlated with handgrip strength in woman, miR-208b, miR-499, and miR-222 changes were significantly correlated with ASM/Height2 in man, while other miRNAs changes did not show a strong correlation with these diagnostic indexes. In conclusion, plasma miR-208b, miR-499, miR-155, miR-222, miR-328, and miR-210 decrease in response to sarcopenia in the elderly.

To investigate perioperative approaches that mitigate IRI-induced tissue damage, Wistar rats underwent suprarenal aortic clamping either alone or in combination with short cycles of ischemic conditioning before and/or after clamping. Serum analysis revealed significant reduction in key biochemical parameters reflecting decreased tissue damage at systemic level and improved renal function in conditioned groups compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.05), which was corroborated by histolopathological evaluation. Importantly, the levels of DNA damage, as reflected by the biomarkers 8-oxo-G, \u03b3H2AX and pATM were reduced in conditioned versus non-conditioned cases. In this setting, NADPH oxidase, a source of free radicals, decreased in the myocardium of conditioned cases. Of note, administration of 5-HD and 8-SPT blocking\u00a0key protective signaling routes abrogated the salutary effect of conditioning. To further understand the non-targeted effect of IRI on the heart, it was noted that serum TGF-\u03b21 levels decreased in conditioned groups, whereas this difference was eliminated after 5-HD and 8-SPT administration.

In this review, we firstly describe the major steps and the most common technologies used in the 3D printing process, then we present current applications of 3D printing with relevance to the cardiovascular field. The technology is more frequently used for the creation of anatomical 3D models useful for teaching, training, and procedural planning of complex surgical cases, as well as for facilitating communication with patients and their families. However, the most attractive and novel application of 3D printing in the last years is bioprinting, which holds the great potential to solve the ever-increasing crisis of organ shortage. In this review, we then present some of the 3D bioprinting strategies used for fabricating fully functional cardiovascular tissues, including myocardium, heart tissue patches, and heart valves. The implications of 3D bioprinting in drug discovery, development, and delivery systems are also briefly discussed, in terms of in vitro cardiovascular drug toxicity. Finally, we describe some applications of 3D printing in the development and testing of cardiovascular medical devices, and the current regulatory frameworks that apply to manufacturing and commercialization of 3D printed products.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2020-03-21", "authors": ["ChiaraGardin", "LetiziaFerroni", "ChristianLatremouille", "Juan CarlosChachques", "DinkoMitre\u010di\u0107", "BarbaraZavan"], "doi": "10.3390/cells9030742\n10.1186/s13104-015-0971-9\n10.1007/s12565-014-0257-7\n10.21037/qims.2019.01.02\n10.1002/jmrs.268\n10.1139/cjpp-2018-0472\n10.1016/j.recesp.2016.09.043\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.170\n10.1177/2048004016645467\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2016.12.001\n10.1056/NEJMra072149\n10.1016/j.surg.2018.11.022\n10.1155/2013/310483\n10.1016/j.iccl.2018.04.004\n10.21037/cdt.2017.01.12\n10.1186/s41205-016-0004-x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0178540\n10.1002/ca.21059\n10.1007/s00276-015-1588-3\n10.1177/0003489416667742\n10.1017/S1047951116001803\n10.1007/s11548-016-1461-9\n10.21037/jtd.2017.07.73\n10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025227\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw668\n10.1016/j.echo.2019.02.003\n10.1016/j.jcct.2019.03.008\n10.1007/s10439-016-1676-5\n10.1093/icvts/ivx243\n10.1007/s11548-019-01971-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.001402\n10.15420/icr.2017:30:1\n10.1016/j.echo.2014.12.016\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.114.003043\n10.1177/2150135116645604\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2016.03.013\n10.2174/187221112800672949\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1155/2012/971614\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2008.03.062\n10.1161/01.CIR.102.suppl_3.III-50\n10.1002/lary.24469\n10.1016/0014-4827(88)90275-3\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1016/j.addr.2018.07.014\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2243912\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.04.001\n10.1039/c3bm00012e\n10.1186/s40824-018-0122-1\n10.3389/fbioe.2017.00023\n10.1039/C7PY00826K\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.026\n10.1186/s40824-016-0074-2\n10.1016/j.molmed.2011.03.005\n10.1089/ten.teb.2016.0322\n10.1111/jcmm.13598\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.05.013\n10.1155/2018/6497242\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.09.011\n10.1161/01.RES.68.6.1560\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.003\n10.1096/fasebj.11.8.9240969\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.10.052\n10.1586/14779072.2013.854165\n10.1093/cvr/cvz010\n10.1093/ejcts/ezz252\n10.2174/187152509787847128\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.005\n10.1002/adfm.201605352\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.045\n10.1002/adma.201503310\n10.1016/j.mtbio.2019.100008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.071\n10.1038/428138a\n10.1038/ncomms4935\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7021-6_27\n10.1038/s41467-019-11091-2\n10.1002/adhm.201800672\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.04.026\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.3791/50288\n10.3791/55438\n10.1038/s41598-017-05018-4\n10.1186/s13036-018-0132-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.027776\n10.1016/j.addr.2011.01.008\n10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2015.07.01\n10.1016/j.addr.2018.07.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.04.012\n10.1002/mabi.200800284\n10.1002/jbm.a.34420\n10.1096/fj.09-151639\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01017.x\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.12.005\n10.1088/1758-5082/4/3/035005\n10.1007/s10439-016-1619-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.08.055\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.04.050\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0582\n10.1016/j.neulet.2016.10.001\n10.1002/term.1893\n10.2741/e449\n10.3390/nano8050296\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.05.025\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.05.014\n10.2174/1381612821666151002114227\n10.1007/s10439-016-1640-4\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000152\n10.1016/j.addr.2018.06.011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.003\n10.1038/nmat4782\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.02.007\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.08.006\n10.1007/s10439-007-9354-2\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.11.001\n10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00510\n10.1510/icvts.2008.194134\n10.1186/1532-429X-15-2\n10.1053/j.jvca.2016.01.013\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.10.145\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2019.02.002\n10.18553/jmcp.2011.17.1.40\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.03.009\n10.2217/rme.15.52\n10.7861/clinmedicine.14-1-6\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.06.003\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aan6521\n10.1208/s12248-018-0225-6\n10.1080/17434440.2019.1609353\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00921\n10.1007/s11948-017-9874-6\n10.1007/s12471-016-0942-3\n10.1007/s10439-016-1607-5\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.12.006\n10.1088/1758-5090/aa7279\n10.2147/IJN.S189587\n10.1002/mabi.201800441\n10.1002/adma.201703443"}
{"title": "Cardiovascular Changes Related to Metabolic Syndrome: Evidence in Obese Zucker Rats.", "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a predictor of cardiovascular diseases, commonly associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the pathogenic mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated. The aim of the study is to evaluate the oxidative status and inflammation in the heart of obese Zucker rats (OZRs) and lean Zucker rats (LZRs) at different ages. Morphological and morphometric analyses were performed in the heart. To study the oxidative status, the malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), protein oxidation, and antioxidant enzymes were measured in plasma and heart. To elucidate the inflammatory markers involved, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed for cellular adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines. OZRs were characterized by hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. The obesity increased MDA and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in plasma as well as in the heart, associated with cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. OxyBlot in plasma and in heart showed an increase of oxidativestate proteins in OZRs. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 expressions in OZRs were higher than those of LZRs. However, these processes did not induce apoptosis or necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Thus, MetS induces the lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant defense that leads to heart tissue changes and coronary inflammation.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-03-20", "authors": ["IleniaMartinelli", "DanieleTomassoni", "MicheleMoruzzi", "ProshantaRoy", "CarloCifani", "FrancescoAmenta", "Seyed KhosrowTayebati"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21062035\n10.1093/qjmed/hcl085\n10.2174/1871527316666170428123853\n10.1007/978-3-319-48382-5_1\n10.1210/er.2008-0024\n10.1111/obr.12229\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.01.001\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.05.049\n10.2174/092986711798184299\n10.1155/2010/535918\n10.1177/1753944717711379\n10.1055/s-2008-1062724\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.03.509\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2018.10.002\n10.1155/2018/4274361\n10.3305/nh.2014.30.2.7416\n10.1007/s13105-012-0154-2\n10.3390/ijms16010378\n10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00252-5\n10.1074/jbc.M103074200\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.01.010\n10.1155/2019/7092151\n10.1155/2013/564961\n10.1016/S0531-5565(00)00118-2\n10.1089/ars.2010.3739\n10.2174/0929867322666141128163739\n10.1038/hr.2011.157\n10.1016/j.lfs.2015.09.018\n10.3390/molecules25010187\n10.1017/S0007114509990729\n10.1016/j.neulet.2013.03.025\n10.1016/j.ab.2016.10.021\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000512\n10.1038/oby.2009.137\n10.1210/jc.2004-0305\n10.2337/diabetes.55.01.06.db05-0751\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000132467.45278.59\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.03.052\n10.3390/ijms12053117\n10.2337/diabetes.54.7.2219\n10.1210/en.2007-0920\n10.1016/0891-5849(90)90131-2\n10.1152/ajpheart.1994.266.4.H1280\n10.1016/S0891-5849(97)00224-4\n10.1056/NEJMoa030535\n10.1007/s11906-015-0539-z\n10.3109/15376516.2012.666650\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04912\n10.1002/cbf.3195\n10.2174/1381612033453866\n10.1016/S0939-4753(04)80048-6\n10.1371/journal.pone.0023657\n10.3109/10641963.2015.1047950\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.18.2149\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.15.1767\n10.1161/hc0902.104353\n10.1161/01.RES.0000229685.37402.80\n10.1007/978-3-642-17214-4_11\n10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03741.x\n10.1007/s00394-020-02181-9\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.02.002\n10.1590/1806-9282.63.01.85\n10.1093/jn/136.12.3022\n10.1515/CCLM.2008.166\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.159228\n10.1186/s12933-017-0604-9\n10.1007/s00281-017-0666-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.171016\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000070116.11304.23"}
{"title": "Cholesterol induced autophagy via IRE1/JNK pathway promotes autophagic cell death in heart tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), with highest mortality and morbidity rates, are the major cause of death in the world. Due to the limited information on heart tissue changes, mediated by hypercholesterolemia, we planned to investigate molecular mechanisms of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and related cell death in high cholesterol fed rabbit model and possible beneficial effects of \u03b1-tocopherol.\nMolecular changes in rabbit heart tissue and cultured cardiomyocytes (H9c2 cells) were measured by western blotting, qRT-PCR, immunflouresence and flow cytometry experiments. Histological modifications were assessed by light and electron microscopes, while degradation of mitochondria was quantified through confocal microscope.\nFeeding rabbits 2% cholesterol diet for 8\u202fweeks and treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes with 10\u202f\u03bcg/mL cholesterol for 3\u202fh induced excessive autophagic activity via IRE1/JNK pathway. While no change in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and apoptotic cell death were determined, electron and confocal microscopy analyses in cholesterol supplemented rabbits revealed significant parameters of autophagic cell death, including cytoplasmic autophagosomes, autolysosomes and organelle loss in juxtanuclear area as well as mitochondria engulfment by autophagosome. Either inhibition of ER stress or JNK in cultured cardiomyocytes or \u03b1-tocopherol supplementation in rabbits could counteract the effects of cholesterol.\nOur findings underline the essential role of hypercholesterolemia in stimulating IRE1/JNK branch of ER stress response which then leads to autophagic cell death in heart tissue.

{"title": "Mesenchymal stem cells ameliorate myocardial fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy via the secretion of prostaglandin E2.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a cardiac complication of long-term uncontrolled diabetes and is characterized by myocardial fibrosis and abnormal cardiac function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells with immunoregulatory and secretory functions in diabetes and heart diseases. However, very few studies have focused on the effect and the underlying mechanism of MSCs on myocardial fibrosis in DCM. Therefore, we aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of MSCs in myocardial fibrosis and its underlying mechanism in vivo and in vitro.\nA DCM rat model was induced using a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with a low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) injection. After four infusions of MSCs, rat serum and heart tissues were collected, and the levels of blood glucose and lipid, cardiac structure, and function, and the degree of myocardial fibrosis including the expression levels of pro-fibrotic factor and collagen were analyzed using biochemical methods, echocardiography, histopathology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We infused prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-deficient MSCs to DCM rats in vivo and established a system mimicking diabetic myocardial fibrosis in vitro by inducing cardiac fibroblasts with high glucose (HG) and coculturing them with MSCs or PGE2-deficient MSCs to further explore the underlying mechanism of amelioration of myocardial fibrosis by MSCs.\nMetabolic abnormalities, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in DCM rats were significantly ameliorated after treatment with MSCs. Moreover, the levels of TGF-\u03b2, collagen I, collagen III, and collagen accumulation were markedly decreased after MSC infusion compared to those in DCM hearts. However, PGE2-deficient MSCs had decreased ability to alleviate cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction. In addition, in vitro study revealed that the concentration of PGE2 in the MSC group was enhanced, while the proliferation and collagen secretion of cardiac fibroblasts were reduced after MSC treatment. However, MSCs had little effect on alleviating fibrosis when the fibroblasts were pretreated with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, which also inhibited PGE2 secretion. This phenomenon could be reversed by adding PGE2.\nOur results indicated that MSC infusion could ameliorate cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction in DCM rats. The underlying mechanisms might involve the function of PGE2 secreted by MSCs.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2020-03-19", "authors": ["LiyuanJin", "JinyingZhang", "ZihuiDeng", "JiejieLiu", "WeidongHan", "GuanghuiChen", "YilingSi", "PingYe"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-020-01633-7\n10.2337/db11-0477\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.07.033\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.10.035\n10.1016/j.diabres.2017.08.018\n10.2337/db09-1456\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.050\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305381\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.158\n10.1152/physrev.00019.2015\n10.1016/j.arr.2010.08.005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309717\n10.1002/stem.1191\n10.1002/stem.2238\n10.1089/scd.2017.0119\n10.1038/srep08713\n10.1038/ki.2012.125\n10.1172/JCI38369\n10.1371/journal.pone.0108105\n10.1177/2041731415592356\n10.1161/CIRCEP.116.004567\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2008.03.046\n10.4070/kcj.2015.45.4.266\n10.1007/s00125-014-3171-6\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2010.07.249\n10.1002/stem.169\n10.1096/fj.201600433R\n10.2337/db11-1141\n10.1182/blood-2007-02-069716\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.09.006\n10.1007/s10620-015-3552-9"}

The mRNA level of Mef2C in fetal rat cardiomyocytes in group B-E was significantly higher than that in group A (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the mRNA level of Mef2C in groups C-E was significantly lower than that in group B (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nSupplementation with folic acid during the periconception period can interfere with the toxic effects of arsenic on the heart. The mechanism may be that lowering the acetylation levels of histone H3K9 in heart tissues leads to decreased expression levels of Mef2C, which may play a protective role in heart development in fetal rats.", "journal": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "date": "2020-03-19", "authors": ["LinNa", "BaiQ", "ZhaoXiumei", "ZhuangLingzi", "HeDeqin", "ZhuangXuanxuan", "GuoHuanhuan", "LinYuan", "ChenXiujuan"], "doi": "10.1186/s12872-020-01418-z\n10.1101/cshperspect.a037234\n10.1017/S1047951119001409\n10.3390/biom9120879\n10.1016/j.tig.2019.12.001\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.158\n10.1007/s11892-019-1272-9\n10.1002/jat.2717\n10.1093/ije/dyz130\n10.21037/cdt.2019.02.03\n10.1093/toxsci/44.2.185\n10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307030\n10.1093/jb/mvz045\n10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.006\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.11.032\n10.1289/ehp.6841"}
{"title": "Suppression of HDAC by sodium acetate rectifies cardiac metabolic disturbance in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 occurs at global epidemic proportions and leads to cardiovascular diseases. Molecular studies suggest the involvement of epigenetic alterations such as histone code modification in the progression of cardiometabolic disorders. However, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are recognized as epigenetic modulators by their histone deacetylase inhibitory property. It is therefore hypothesized that cardiac histone deacetylase activity increases in type II diabetes and SCFA, acetate, would inhibit histone deacetylase with accompanying restoration of glucose dysregulation, cardiac lipid deposition, and tissue damage in male Wistar rats. Twenty-four male rats (240\u2013270\u2009g) were allotted into four groups (\nThis study provides evidence that STZ-NA-induced diabetes mellitus is associated with cardiac triglyceride accumulation and tissue disruption with corresponding increase in cardiac HDAC activity. However, sodium acetate suppresses cardiac HDAC activity and normalizes cardiac triglyceride and tissue integrity in diabetic rats. Therefore, the study suggests that sodium acetate is beneficial for cardioprotection in diabetes mellitus.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2020-03-19", "authors": ["Kehinde SOlaniyi", "Oluwatobi AAmusa", "Emmanuel DAreola", "Lawrence AOlatunji"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370220913847"}
{"title": "Message in a Bottle: Upgrading Cardiac Repair into Rejuvenation.", "abstract": "Ischaemic cardiac disease is associated with a loss of cardiomyocytes and an intrinsic lack of myocardial renewal. Recent work has shown that the heart retains limited cardiomyocyte proliferation, which remains inefficient when facing pathological conditions. While broadly active in the neonatal mammalian heart, this mechanism becomes quiescent soon after birth, suggesting loss of regenerative potential with maturation into adulthood. A key question is whether this temporary regenerative window can be enhanced via appropriate stimulation and further extended. Recently the search for novel therapeutic approaches for heart disease has centred on stem cell biology. The \"paracrine effect\" has been proposed as a promising strategy to boost endogenous reparative and regenerative mechanisms from within the cardiac tissue by exploiting the modulatory potential of soluble stem cell-secreted factors. As such, growing interest has been specifically addressed towards stem/progenitor cell-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), which can be easily isolated in vitro from cell-conditioned medium. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of the current paradigm on cardiac repair and regeneration, with a specific focus on the role and mechanism(s) of paracrine action of EVs from cardiac stromal progenitors as compared to exogenous stem cells in order to discuss the optimal choice for future therapy. In addition, the challenges to overcoming translational EV biology from bench to bedside for future cardiac regenerative medicine will be discussed.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2020-03-19",

{"title": "Applications for Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells in Disease Modelling and Drug Development for Heart Diseases.", "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are derived from reprogrammed somatic cells by the introduction of defined transcription factors. They are characterised by a capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency. Human (h)iPSCs are expected to be used extensively for disease modelling, drug screening and regenerative medicine. Obtaining cardiac tissue from patients with mutations for genetic studies and functional analyses is a highly invasive procedure.

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of vanillic acid against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rat.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective agent for the treatment of many neoplastic diseases. Cardiotoxicity is the major side effect of this drug and limits its use. Vanillic acid (VA) is a pharmaceutical compound from the phenolic acids family. The present study is an attempt to investigate the possible helpful effects of VA against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.\nFor induction of cardiotoxicity, male Wistar rats received total of six doses of DOX (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) three times per week from days 14 to 28. Treatment groups received daily oral doses of VA (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) two weeks before DOX injection and then plus DOX for 2 weeks. At the end of experiment, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were detected using tail-cuff method. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase-MB (CK-MB), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were measured in serum samples. Troponin-I and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were measured in cardiac tissue. All the measurements processed spectrophotometrically using commercial ELISA kits. Cardiac tissue was also processed for histopathological examination.\nTreatment with VA significantly increased SBP compared to the DOX group and restored HR near to the normal level. Administration of VA at all of doses, decreased serum levels of LDH, SGOT, CK-MB, MDA, cardiac troponin-I, cardiac TLR4 and increased FRAP value.\nThese results suggest that VA may exert cardioprotective effects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and biomarkers of cardiotoxicity, suppression of TLR4 signaling and consequently inflammation pathway.", "journal": "Research in pharmaceutical sciences", "date": "2020-03-18", "authors": ["BaharBaniahmad", "LeilaSafaeian", "GolnazVaseghi", "MohammadRabbani", "BehnooshMohammadi"], "doi": "10.4103/1735-5362.278718"}
{"title": "Myocardial cathepsin D is downregulated in sudden cardiac death.", "abstract": "Cathepsins are the major lysosomal proteases that maintain intracellular homeostasis. Herein, we investigated the alterations in myocardial cathepsin expression during aging, cardiac hypertrophy, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Cardiac tissue and blood were sampled from autopsy cases. Subjects were classified into three groups: SCD with cardiac hypertrophy (SCH), compensated cardiac hypertrophy (CCH), and control. Immunoblotting was performed for the major cardiac cathepsins and their targets: cathepsin B, D, and L (CTSB/D/L), p62, ATP synthase subunit c (ATPSC), and \u03b1-synuclein (ASNC). Immunohistochemical analysis and ELISA using serum samples were performed for CTSD. Cardiac CTSB and CTSD were upregulated with age (r = 0.63 and 0.60, respectively), whereas the levels of CTSL, p62, ATPSC, and ASNC remained unchanged. In age-matched groups, cardiac CTSD was significantly downregulated in SCH (p = 0.006) and CTSL was moderately downregulated in CCH (p = 0.021); however, p62, ATPSC, and ASNC were not upregulated in cardiac hypertrophy. Immunohistochemistry also revealed decreased myocardial CTSD levels in SCH, and serum CTSD levels were relatively lower in SCH cases. Overall, these results suggest that upregulation of cardiac CTSB and CTSD with age may compensate for the elevated proteolytic demand, and that downregulation of CTSD is potentially linked to SCH.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["YuKakimoto", "AyumiSasaki", "MakiNiioka", "NoboruKawabe", "MotokiOsawa"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0230375\n10.1016/j.arr.2016.04.010\n10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.10.002\n10.1006/exnr.1994.1048\n10.1002/mds.26562\n10.1016/s1568-1637(03)00027-8\n10.1007/BF02815189\n10.1093/cvr/cvr073\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004044\n10.1161/01.RES.0000067471.95890.5C\n10.6515/ACS20170129A\n10.1007/s00059-015-4311-6\n10.1136/openhrt-2015-000353\n10.5830/CVJA-2014-035\n10.1053/euhj.2001.2824\n10.1001/jama.300.12.1423\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000485\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv428\n10.1093/europace/euu153\n10.1016/s0735-1097(97)00355-0\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.11.045\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.07.010\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.940619\n10.1016/j.tips.2010.12.001\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.002\n10.4161/15548627.2014.981787\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-18-06898.2000\n10.1002/yea.3286\n10.1073/pnas.1500937112\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.03.023\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00639\n10.1002/jnr.490230412\n10.1016/0047-6374(89)90101-2\n10.1016/0047-6374(84)90112-x\n10.1016/j.mad.2006.07.001\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.1992.tb10965.x\n10.1038/s41598-019-40250-0\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.12.017\n10.1007/s00395-004-0499-3\n10.1016/0005-2744(78)90089-x\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.036\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61253-9"}
{"title": "Bioinspired Soft Robot with Incorporated Microelectrodes.", "abstract": "Bioinspired soft robotic systems that mimic living organisms using engineered muscle tissue and biomaterials are revolutionizing the current biorobotics paradigm, especially in biomedical research. Recreating artificial life-like actuation dynamics is crucial for a soft-robotic system. However, the precise control and tuning of actuation behavior still represents one of the main challenges of modern soft robotic systems. This method describes a low-cost, highly scalable, and easy-to-use procedure to fabricate an electrically controllable soft robot with life-like movements that is activated and controlled by the contraction of cardiac muscle tissue on a micropatterned sting ray-like hydrogel scaffold. The use of soft photolithography methods makes it possible to successfully integrate multiple components in the soft robotic system, including micropatterned hydrogel-based scaffolds with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded gelatin methacryloyl (CNT-GelMA), poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), flexible gold (Au) microelectrodes, and cardiac muscle tissue. In particular, the hydrogels alignment and micropattern are designed to mimic the muscle and cartilage structure of the sting ray. The electrically conductive CNT-GelMA hydrogel acts as a cell scaffold that improves the maturation and contraction behavior of cardiomyocytes, while the mechanically robust PEGDA hydrogel provides structural cartilage-like support to the whole soft robot. To overcome the hard and brittle nature of metal-based microelectrodes, we designed a serpentine pattern that has high flexibility and can avoid hampering the beating dynamics of cardiomyocytes. The incorporated flexible Au microelectrodes provide electrical stimulation across the soft robot, making it easier to control the contraction behavior of cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["TingWang", "BiancaMigliori", "BeatriceMiccoli", "Su RyonShin"], "doi": "10.3791/60717"}
{"title": "Diagnosis of drowning using postmortem computed tomography combined with endoscopic autopsy: A case report.", "abstract": "Postmortem forensic imaging technologies provide a noninvasive/minimally invasive approach for imaging of internal organ structures of the human body to detect injuries, diseases, and other morphologic changes. Currently, postmortem forensic imaging methods have been widely used in determination of the cause of death. However, these methods do not allow histologic examinations. Endoscopic autopsy emerged in the 1990s. Thoracoscopy and laparoscopy are mainly used to examine organs and tissues in the thoracic and abdominal cavity. Target tissues are also sampled for histologic examination. By combining postmortem forensic imaging with endoscopic autopsy, comprehensive examination of the corpse, organs, and sampling for histologic examination can be carried out.\nA 34-year-old woman was witnessed jumping into the river, sinking after struggling in the water. The body was found 24\u200ahours later and confirmed with no vital signs. No preexisting medical conditions were known.\nPostmortem computed tomography, target coronary postmortem computed tomography angiography, and endoscopic autopsy were performed before conventional autopsy. Laparoscopic examination was used to examine the abdominal organs. The diaphragm and pericardium were cut open from the abdominal cavity to allow access to the examination of lungs and heart. Tissue samples were collected from various organs for histologic examination, and a diatom test was carried out on lung samples. Postmortem computed tomography revealed fluid in the paranasal sinuses, airways, stomach, and duodenum; emphysema aquosum; and mosaic pattern of the lung parenchyma. Endoscopic examination additionally detected Paltauf spots. The results were consistent with those of conventional autopsy. Histologic examination revealed pulmonary congestion, pulmonary edema, pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and congestion in multiple organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Diatoms were detected in lung tissues, which were identical in morphology to diatoms in water samples collected from the scene. The cause of death was determined as drowning.\nCombining forensic imaging and endoscopic autopsy for postmortem examination yields a more comprehensive and scientific finding, and the combination is minimally invasive and more acceptable to the family members.

Retinoid X receptor (RXR) plays an important role in cardiac development and has been implicated in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of RXR agonist treatment on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the underlying mechanism. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats induced by STZ injection were treated with either RXR agonist bexarotene (Bex) or vehicle alone. Echocardiography was performed to determine cardiac structure and function. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were treated with high glucose (HG) with or without the indicated concentration of Bex or the RXR ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). The protein abundance levels were measured along with collagen, body weight (BW), blood biochemical indexes and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) levels. The effects of RXR\u03b1 down-regulation by RXR\u03b1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) were examined. The results showed that bexarotene treatment resulted in amelioration of left ventricular dysfunction by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis. Immunoblot with heart tissue homogenates from diabetic rats revealed that bexarotene activated liver kinase B1 (LKB1) signaling and inhibited p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K). The increased collagen levels in the heart tissues of DCM rats were reduced by bexarotene treatment. Treatment of CFs with HG resulted in significantly reduced LKB1 activity and increased p70S6K activity. RXR\u03b1 mediated the antagonism of 9-cis-RA on HG-induced LKB1/p70S6K activation changes in vitro. Our findings suggest that RXR agonist ameliorates STZ-induced DCM by inhibiting myocardial fibrosis via modulation of the LKB1/p70S6K signaling pathway. RXR agonists may serve as novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of DCM.", "journal": "Clinical science (London, England : 1979)", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["DajunChai", "XiaoyanLin", "QiaowenZheng", "ChangshengXu", "HongXie", "QinyunRuan", "JinxiuLin", "JieLiu", "JinzhangZeng"], "doi": "10.1042/CS20190985"}
{"title": "Inducing Endogenous Cardiac Regeneration: Can Biomaterials Connect the Dots?", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI) due to blockage of coronary arteries is a major public health issue. MI results in massive loss of cardiac muscle due to ischemia. Unfortunately, the adult mammalian myocardium presents a low regenerative potential, leading to two main responses to injury: fibrotic scar formation and hypertrophic remodeling. To date, complete heart transplantation remains the only clinical option to restore heart function. In the last two decades, tissue engineering has emerged as a promising approach to promote cardiac regeneration. Tissue engineering aims to target processes associated with MI, including cardiomyogenesis, modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and fibrosis. Tissue engineering dogmas suggest the utilization and combination of two key components: bioactive molecules and biomaterials. This chapter will present current therapeutic applications of biomaterials in cardiac regeneration and the challenges still faced ahead. The following biomaterial-based approaches will be discussed: Nano-carriers for cardiac regeneration-inducing biomolecules; corresponding matrices for their controlled release; injectable hydrogels for cell delivery and cardiac patches.

Hypovolemic shock was applied to the rats in the ischemia-reperfusion groups for one hour. The abdominal aorta was explored following midline laparotomy and atraumatic microvascular clamps were applied from the infrarenal level. Following one-hour ischemia, the clamps were removed, and reperfusion was established for two hours. In the sham group, intraperitoneal glycerol once daily was applied five days before surgery. In the whortleberry group, whortleberry treatment was administered via the intraperitoneal route five days before ischemia-reperfusion.\nThe ischemia-reperfusion group exhibited a decrease in the glutathione levels and an increase in the malondialdehyde levels (p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively). We also observed an increase in the caspase-3 positivity in cardiac myofibrils (p<0.01). Whortleberry administration lowered both malondialdehyde levels and numerical density of caspase-3 positive cardiac myofibrils, while increasing the heart tissue glutathione levels, compared to the ischemia-reperfusion alone group (p<0.01, p=0.011, and p=0.011, respectively).\nWhortleberry may be beneficial in preventing cardiac tissue damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion in the surgical repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.", "journal": "Turk gogus kalp damar cerrahisi dergisi", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["Sedat OzanKaraki\u015fi", "Do\u011fu\u015fHem\u015finli", "\u015eabanErgene", "TolgaMercantepe", "LeventT\u00fcmkaya", "AdnanY\u0131lmaz"], "doi": "10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2020.18389"}

{"title": "Clusterin is regulated by IGF1-PI3K signaling in the heart: implications for biomarker and drug target discovery, and cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Open-access gene expression data sets provide a useful resource for identifying novel drug targets and biomarkers. The IGF1-PI3K pathway is a critical mediator of physiological cardiac enlargement/hypertrophy and protection. This study arose after mining a gene microarray data set from a previous study that compared heart tissue from cardiac-specific PI3K transgenic mouse models. The top-ranked candidate identified from the microarray data was clusterin. Clusterin has been proposed as a biomarker for multiple diseases including heart failure, and as a cancer drug target. Here, we show that clusterin gene expression is increased in hearts of transgenic mice with increased PI3K and decreased in mice with depressed cardiac PI3K. In vitro, clusterin secretion was elevated in media from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes treated with IGF1. Furthermore, by mining gene expression data from hearts during normal mouse postnatal growth, we also report an increase in clusterin expression with postnatal heart growth. Given we show that clusterin is regulated by the IGF1-PI3K pathway in the heart, and this pathway mediates physiological cardiac hypertrophy and cardioprotection, caution is required when considering clusterin as a biomarker for heart failure and as a cancer target.

{"title": "Modified citrus pectin ameliorates myocardial fibrosis and inflammation via suppressing galectin-3 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Myocardial fibrosis (MF) plays a key role in the development and progression of heart failure (HF) with limited effective therapies. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a biomarker associated with fibrosis and inflammation in patients with HF. The Gal-3 inhibitor modified citrus pectin (MCP) protects against cardiac dysfunction, though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of MCP on MF using an isoproterenol (ISO)-induced rat model of HF. Cardiac function was analyzed by echocardiography and electrocardiography. Histopathological changes in the heart tissue were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome staining. The mRNA and protein expression levels of signaling molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines were monitored by immunohistochemistry, western blot, qRT-PCR and ELISA analyses. The results demonstrated that MCP ameliorated cardiac dysfunction, decreased myocardial injury and reduced collagen deposition. Furthermore, MCP downregulated the expression of Gal-3, TLR4 and MyD88, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB-p65 activation. MCP also decreased the expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and TNF-\u03b1, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HF. These inhibitory effects were observed on day 15 and continued until day 22. Taken together, these results suggest that MCP ameliorates cardiac dysfunction through inhibiting inflammation and MF. These effects may be through downregulating Gal-3 expression and suppressing activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. The present study supports the use of Gal-3 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of MF after myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["Geng-RuiXu", "ChuangZhang", "Hong-XiaYang", "Jia-HuanSun", "YueZhang", "Ting-TingYao", "YuanLi", "LinRuan", "RanAn", "Ai-YingLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110071"}

Here, we evaluated a simple and feasible design of gelatin-hydroxyphenyl propionic acid (GH) hydrogel as an in situ cross-linkable and injectable cell delivery platform for cardiac tissue regeneration. The GH hydrogel exhibited improved cell retention and survival in vitro and in vivo when encapsulating mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that were used as promising therapeutic candidates for stem cell therapy. Moreover, we demonstrated that MSC-encapsulating GH hydrogels led to a significant improvement in cardiac functional metrics, such as the fractional shortening (FS), ejection fraction (EF), and end-systolic volume (ESV).

{"title": "Anisotropic shortening in the wavelength of electrical waves promotes onset of electrical turbulence in cardiac tissue: An in silico study.", "abstract": "Several pathological conditions introduce spatial variations in the electrical properties of cardiac tissue. These variations occur as localized or distributed gradients in ion-channel functionality over extended tissue media. Electrical waves, propagating through such affected tissue, demonstrate distortions, depending on the nature of the ionic gradient in the diseased substrate. If the degree of distortion is large, reentrant activity may develop, in the form of rotating spiral (2d) and scroll (3d) waves of electrical activity. These reentrant waves are associated with the occurrence of lethal cardiac rhythm disorders, known as arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), which are believed to be common precursors of sudden cardiac arrest. By using state-of-the-art mathematical models for generic, and ionically-realistic (human) cardiac tissue, we study the detrimental effects of these ionic gradients on electrical wave propagation. We propose a possible mechanism for the development of instabilities in reentrant wave patterns, in the presence of ionic gradients in cardiac tissue, which may explain how one type of arrhythmia (VT) can degenerate into another (VF). Our proposed mechanism entails anisotropic reduction in the wavelength of the excitation waves because of anisotropic variation in its electrical properties, in particular the action potential duration (APD). We find that the variation in the APD, which we induce by varying ion-channel conductances, imposes a spatial variation in the spiral- or scroll-wave frequency \u03c9. Such gradients in \u03c9 induce anisotropic shortening of wavelength of the spiral or scroll arms and eventually leads to instabilitites.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2020-03-14", "authors": ["SolingZimik", "RahulPandit", "RupamanjariMajumder"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0230214\n10.1038/225535b0\n10.1016/0092-8674(95)90408-5\n10.1021/cr00035a012\n10.1038/355349a0\n10.1016/0167-2789(88)90062-0\n10.1063/1.166291\n10.1038/32170\n10.1016/s0735-1097(01)01696-5\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1999.tb00204.x\n10.1161/01.cir.77.3.589\n10.1063/1.1504242\n10.1016/0002-8703(64)90371-0\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.62.1.25\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.238758\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.11.022\n10.1093/cvr/cvm060\n10.1161/01.res.76.3.351\n10.1109/JBHI.2015.2442833\n10.1152/physrev.00014.2006\n10.1016/j.tips.2010.12.001\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.08.005\n10.1016/0002-9149(78)90681-1\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.11.014\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082179\n10.1161/01.cir.101.10.1192\n10.1161/01.res.69.6.1427\n10.1161/01.res.67.5.1287\n10.1113/jphysiol.1991.sp018789\n10.1113/jphysiol.2004.075861\n10.1161/hh2401.100818\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.018\n10.1016/0960-0779(95)00089-5\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1088/1367-2630/18/12/123014\n10.1134/S0021364016230041\n10.1063/1.1840311\n10.1114/1.1289474\n10.1152/ajpheart.00747.2003\n10.1529/biophysj.106.080945\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.2.H535\n10.1103/PhysRevE.88.062703\n10.1152/ajpheart.00410.2014\n10.1063/1.166286\n10.1152/ajpheart.00608.2002\n10.1103/PhysRevE.82.051908\n10.1152/ajpheart.1999.276.1.H269"}

{"title": "Guided vascularization in the rat heart leads to transient vessel patterning.", "abstract": "Recent progress in the production and maturation of iPSC-cardiomyocytes has facilitated major advances in building bioartificial heart tissue with functional cardiomyocytes. Despite this progress, vascularizing these constructs continues to be a barrier to clinical application. One emerging strategy for vascularization uses aligned \"cords\" of endothelial cells in tissue grafts to guide assembly of chimeric microvessels upon graft implantation. Here, we test whether this approach can guide vascularization of a bioartificial tissue implanted on the rat heart. We find that patterned cords of human endothelial cells anastomose and become perfused with host blood by 3\u2009days post-implantation. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that graft-derived micro-vessels persist in the patch for 7\u2009days. Furthermore, we noted a shift in distribution of vessels in the patch from patterned cord-associated clustering at 3\u2009days to a more diffuse distribution pattern at 7\u2009days. This loss of patterning corresponded to an infiltration of CD68+ cells and an increase in collagen within the patch. Upon further engraftment of patches containing both cords and human cardiomyocytes, we identified human cardiomyocytes and graft derived vasculature at the time of explant. Our findings show that patterned endothelial cords guide transient vessel patterning on the rat heart.

{"title": "Unraveling the complexity of amyloid polymorphism using gold nanoparticles and cryo-EM.", "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that amyloid polymorphism gives rise to different strains of amyloids with distinct toxicities and pathology-spreading properties. Validating this hypothesis is challenging due to a lack of tools and methods that allow for the direct characterization of amyloid polymorphism in hydrated and complex biological samples. Here, we report on the development of 11-mercapto-1-undecanesulfonate-coated gold nanoparticles (NPs) that efficiently label the edges of synthetic, recombinant, and native amyloid fibrils derived from different amyloidogenic proteins. We demonstrate that these NPs represent powerful tools for assessing amyloid morphological polymorphism, using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The NPs allowed for the visualization of morphological features that are not directly observed using standard imaging techniques, including transmission electron microscopy with use of the negative stain or cryo-EM imaging. The use of these NPs to label native paired helical filaments (PHFs) from the postmortem brain of a patient with Alzheimer's disease, as well as amyloid fibrils extracted from the heart tissue of a patient suffering from systemic amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, revealed a high degree of homogeneity across the fibrils derived from human tissue in comparison with fibrils aggregated in vitro. These findings are consistent with, and strongly support, the emerging view that the physiologic milieu is a key determinant of amyloid fibril strains. Together, these advances should not only facilitate the profiling and characterization of amyloids for structural studies by cryo-EM, but also pave the way to elucidate the structural basis of amyloid strains and toxicity, and possibly the correlation between the pathological and clinical heterogeneity of amyloid diseases.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2020-03-13", "authors": ["UrszulaCendrowska", "Paulo JacobSilva", "NadineAit-Bouziad", "MarieM\u00fcller", "Zekiye PelinGuven", "SophieVieweg", "AnassChiki", "LynnRadamaker", "Senthil TKumar", "MarcusF\u00e4ndrich", "FrancescoTavanti", "Maria CristinaMenziani", "AlfredoAlexander-Katz", "FrancescoStellacci", "Hilal ALashuel"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1916176117\n10.1101/2020.02.05.935619"}

In recent years, it has been reported that drug screening using three-dimensional (3D) tissue is better than conventional 2D culture. Various methods have been developed for mass culture of hiPSC-CMs, and embryoid body (EB) formation is necessary in the majority of differentiation methods as this is reported to promote the differentiation of hiPSCs. However, these operations result in increased processing, cost and loss of hiPSCs. Here, we show alternative methods for differentiation to hiPSC-CMs from <100\u00a0\u03bcm hiPSC-clumps without EB formation and report on a 3D-tissue fabrication using hiPSC-CMs. The 3D cardiac tissue constructed by a layer-by-layer (LbL) cell coating technique (LbL-3D Heart) showed synchronous powerful beating.

{"title": "Epicardial TGF\u03b2 and BMP Signaling in Cardiac Regeneration: What Lesson Can We Learn from the Developing Heart?", "abstract": "The epicardium, the outer layer of the heart, has been of interest in cardiac research due to its vital role in the developing and diseased heart. During development, epicardial cells are active and supply cells and paracrine cues to the myocardium. In the injured adult heart, the epicardium is re-activated and recapitulates embryonic behavior that is essential for a proper repair response. Two indispensable processes for epicardial contribution to heart tissue formation are epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tissue invasion. One of the key groups of cytokines regulating both EMT and invasion is the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) family, including TGF\u03b2 and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP). Abundant research has been performed to understand the role of TGF\u03b2 family signaling in the developing epicardium. However, less is known about signaling in the adult epicardium.

In recent years, increasing awareness and improved screening have resulted in an increased prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis, with contemporary estimates reporting a prevalence of 18-55 cases per 100,000 person-years, accounting for > 13% of heart failure hospitalizations. The arrhythmic manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis can range from conduction-system disease and bradyarrhythmias to atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.

When available, biventricular pacing should be considered in symptomatic patients, particularly in those expected to receive a high burden of ventricular pacing (> 40%). The management of atrial fibrillation can be challenging, because contemporary agents for rate and rhythm control may be poorly tolerated in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.

{"title": "Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Failure Society Joint Position Statement on the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Cardiac Amyloidosis.", "abstract": "Cardiac amyloidosis is an under-recognized and potentially fatal cause of heart failure and other cardiovascular manifestations. It is caused by deposition of misfolded precursor proteins as fibrillary amyloid deposits in cardiac tissues. The two primary subtypes of systemic amyloidosis causing cardiac involvement are immunoglobulin light chain (AL), a plasma cell dyscrasia, and transthyretin (ATTR), itself subdivided into a hereditary subtype caused by a gene mutation of the ATTR protein, and an age-related wild type, which occurs in the absence of a gene mutation. Clinical recognition requires a high index of suspicion, inclusive of the extracardiac manifestations of both subtypes. Diagnostic workup includes screening for serum and/or urine monoclonal protein suggestive of immunoglobulin light chains, along with serum cardiac biomarker measurement and performance of cardiac imaging for findings consistent with amyloid infiltration. Modern cardiac imaging techniques, including the use of nuclear scintigraphy with bone-seeking radiotracer to noninvasively diagnose ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, have reduced reliance on the gold standard endomyocardial biopsy. Disease-modifying therapeutic approaches have evolved significantly, particularly for ATTR, and pharmacologic therapies that slow or halt disease progression are becoming available. This Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Failure Society joint position statement provides evidence-based recommendations that support the early recognition and optimal diagnostic approach and management strategies for patients with cardiac amyloidosis.

{"title": "Pre-culture of mesenchymal stem cells within RGD-modified hyaluronic acid hydrogel improves their resilience to ischaemic conditions.", "abstract": "The incorporation of the RGD peptide (arginine-glycine-aspartate) into biomaterials has been proposed to promote cell adhesion to the matrix, which can influence and control cell behaviour and function. While many studies have utilised RGD modified biomaterials for cell delivery, few have examined its effect under the condition of reduced oxygen and nutrients, as found at ischaemic injury sites. Here, we systematically examine the effect of RGD on hMSCs in hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel under standard and ischaemic culture conditions, to elucidate under what conditions RGD has beneficial effects over unmodified HA and its effectiveness in improving cell viability. Results demonstrate that under standard culture conditions, RGD significantly increased hMSC spreading and the release of vascular endothelial factor-1 (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant factor-1 (MCP-1), compared to unmodified HA hydrogel. As adhesion is known to influence cell survival, we hypothesised that cells in RGD hydrogels would exhibit increased cell viability under ischaemic culture conditions. However, results demonstrate that cell viability and protein release was comparable in both RGD modified and unmodified HA hydrogels. Confocal imaging revealed cellular morphology indicative of weak cell adhesion. Subsequent investigations found that RGD was could exert positive effects on encapsulated cells under ischaemic conditions but only if hMSCs were pre-cultured under standard conditions to allow strong adhesion to RGD before exposure. Together, these results provide novel insight into the value of RGD introduction and suggest that the adhesion of hMSCs to RGD prior to delivery could improve survival and function at ischaemic injury sites. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The development of a biomaterial scaffold capable of maintaining cell viability while promoting cell function is a major research goal in the field of cardiac tissue engineering. This study confirms the suitability of a modified HA hydrogel whereby stem cells in the modified hydrogel showed significantly greater cell spreading and protein secretion compared to cells in the unmodified HA hydrogel. A pre-culture period allowing strong adhesion of the cells to the modified hydrogel was shown to improve cell survival under conditions that mimic the myocardium post-MI.

{"title": "MicroRNA-31-5p attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via quaking and circular RNA Pan3.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug with considerable cardiotoxicity. DOX can induce myocardial apoptosis by modulating multiple signalling pathways. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of DOX's cardiotoxicity will improve its clinical application and help avoid heart failure in patients.\nModels of DOX cardiotoxicity in cultured cardiomyocytes and mice were used. Cell death was determined by TUNEL and caspase 3/7 activity assay. Quaking (QKI) expression was detected by immunoblotting; microRNA-31-5p and circular RNA (circRNA) levels were determined by qRT-PCR. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate the miR-31-5p target. We found that DOX treatment upregulated miR-31-5p expression both in cultured cardiomyocytes and in mouse heart tissue. Silencing of miR-31-5p significantly alleviated the myocardial apoptosis induced by DOX treatment both in vivo and in vitro. Further analysis indicated QKI as a direct target of miR-31-5p, which has been reported to influence circRNA expression in a series of cell types. We found that circPan3 was specifically downregulated in cardiomyocytes upon DOX treatment. We further confirmed that the downregulation of circPan3 was due to the silencing of QKI by miR-31-5p.\nOur data reveal links among miR-31-5p, QKI and circPan3 in the apoptotic programme of cardiomyocytes. MiR-31-5p acted as a negative regulator of circPan3 by directly suppressing QKI, which may be a potential therapeutic target and strategy for DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2020-03-07", "authors": ["XiaoyuJi", "WeiDing", "TaoXu", "XianxinZheng", "JingZhang", "MengxinLiu", "GaoliLiu", "JianxunWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.02.009"}

One of the common CVDs is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Recent studies conducted in heart cells of mice have shown that this condition involves a chemical modification called hydroxymethylation of the DNA of heart cells.\nObjectives of the proposed research are to profile the distribution of 5-hydroxymethylation in the cardiomyocyte (CMC) genome of cadaveric cardiac tissue and cardiac biopsy specimens; to compare the hydroxymethylome of cadaveric CMCs with that of cardiac biopsy specimens from HCM patients and/or cardiac transplant patients (control) undergoing cardiac catheterization; to histologically appraise sarcomere distribution and mitochondrial morphology of CMCs in the presence of HCM; to correlate the mitochondrial genome with the HCM phenotype; and to integrate anatomy with biochemistry and genetics into the instructional design of HCM in the core medical curriculum at Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBRU).\nNormal and hypertrophic heart specimens will be obtained from 8 whole-body cadavers (2/8, 25% control and 6/8, 75% HCM). Myocardial biopsy specimens will be obtained from cardiothoracic and transplant units at the Cleveland Clinic in Abu Dhabi, UAE. As this is a proof-of-concept study, we plan to recruit 5 patients with HCM, where HCM has been diagnosed according to the guidelines of the 2014 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines. Patients with valvular heart disease, history of myocarditis, regular alcohol consumption, or cardiotoxic chemotherapy will be excluded. The control biopsy specimens will be obtained from patients who had received heart transplants. Three investigational approaches will then be employed: (1) gross anatomical evaluation, (2) histological analysis, and (3) profiling and analysis of the hydroxymethylome. These investigations will be pursued with minor modifications, if required, to the standard protocols and in accordance with institutional policy. The objective associated with the education of health professionals will be addressed through a strategy based on Graham's knowledge translation model.\nThis study is at the protocol-development stage. The validated questionnaires have been identified in relation to the objectives. The MBRU and the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi Institutional Review Board (IRB) are reviewing this study. Further clarification and information can be obtained from the MBRU IRB. There is funding in place for this study (MBRU-CM-RG2019-08). Currently, we are in the process of standardizing the protocols with respect to the various molecular techniques to be employed during the course of the study. The total duration of the proposed research is 24 months, with a provision for 6 months of a no-cost extension.\nThe spectrum of CVDs has recently received significant focus from the public health sector in the UAE. HCM is a common familial heart disease, contributing to the sudden increase in the mortality rate of young Emiratis in the UAE. Incorporating artificial intelligence into the identification of epigenetic risk factors associated with HCM will promote accurate diagnosis and lead to the development of improved management plans, hence, positive patient outcomes. Furthermore, integration of these findings into the instructional design of undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuous professional development medical curricula will further contribute to the body of knowledge regarding HCM.\nPRR1-10.2196/17241.", "journal": "JMIR research protocols", "date": "2020-03-07", "authors": ["NerissaNaidoo", "GurjyotBajwa", "RuthwikDuvuru", "YajnavalkaBanerjee"], "doi": "10.2196/17241\n10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30168-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62189-3\n10.2174/1570161113666150827125040\n10.1016/j.jegh.2012.04.002\n10.1056/NEJM199210153271616\n10.1056/NEJM199204233261703\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.02.068\n10.1101/gr.076653.108\n10.1038/nrcardio.2011.159\n10.1101/gad.1563807\n10.1002/em.20596\n10.1038/nrg2045\n10.4161/epi.6.7.16262\n10.1038/ncomms12418\n10.1073/pnas.1315155110\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028561\n10.1038/ncomms6288\n10.1038/s41467-017-02762-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306337\n10.1186/s13104-017-3066-y\n10.1186/s13104-017-3066-y\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020463\n10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.08.016\n10.2196/11122\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.1998.19230443.x\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu284\n10.1002/emmm.201201553\n10.1002/emmm.201201553\n10.1038/nmeth0711-532b\n10.1038/nbt.1732\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.01.011\n10.1186/gb-2013-14-8-r83\n10.1186/gb-2013-14-8-r83\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu170\n10.1186/gb-2009-10-3-r25\n10.1186/gb-2009-10-3-r25\n10.1038/nbt.1754\n10.1371/journal.pone.0065598\n10.1371/journal.pone.0065598\n10.2144/000114077\n10.1093/nar/gku917\n10.1177/0003319713510059\n10.1016/j.jacl.2014.11.008\n10.1056/NEJMc1703361\n10.1097/ACM.0000000000002211\n10.1186/s12909-019-1896-0\n10.1186/s12909-019-1896-0\n10.1136/vr.103862\n10.2147/AMEP.S77890\n10.2147/AMEP.S77890"}

{"title": "Regulation of calcium dynamics and propagation velocity by tissue microstructure in engineered strands of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Disruptions to cardiac tissue microstructure are common in diseased or injured myocardium and are known substrates for arrhythmias. However, we have a relatively coarse understanding of the relationships between myocardial tissue microstructure, propagation velocity and calcium cycling, due largely to the limitations of conventional experimental tools. To address this, we used microcontact printing to engineer strands of cardiac tissue with eight different widths, quantified several structural and functional parameters and established correlation coefficients. As strand width increased, actin alignment, nuclei density, sarcomere index and cell aspect ratio decreased with unique trends. The propagation velocity of calcium waves decreased and the rise time of calcium transients increased with increasing strand width. The decay time constant of calcium transients decreased and then slightly increased with increasing strand width. Based on correlation coefficients, actin alignment was the strongest predictor of propagation velocity and calcium transient rise time. Sarcomere index and cell aspect ratio were also strongly correlated with propagation velocity. Actin alignment, sarcomere index and cell aspect ratio were all weak predictors of the calcium transient decay time constant. We also measured the expression of several genes relevant to propagation and calcium cycling and found higher expression of the genes that encode for connexin 43 (Cx43) and a subunit of L-type calcium channels in thin strands compared to isotropic tissues. Together, these results suggest that thinner strands have higher values of propagation velocity and calcium transient rise time due to a combination of favorable tissue microstructure and enhanced expression of genes for Cx43 and L-type calcium channels. These data are important for defining how microstructural features regulate intercellular and intracellular calcium handling, which is needed to understand mechanisms of propagation in physiological situations and arrhythmogenesis in pathological situations.", "journal": "Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro", "date": "2020-03-03", "authors": ["Andrew PPetersen", "NathanCho", "Davi MLyra-Leite", "Jeffrey WSantoso", "DivyaGupta", "Nethika RAriyasinghe", "Megan LMcCain"], "doi": "10.1093/intbio/zyaa003"}

In particular, \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR) is known to be related to the restoration and maintenance of homeostasis in bone and cardiac tissues; however, the functional role of signaling through \u03b22-AR in periodontal ligament (PDL) tissue has not been fully examined. In this report, we investigated that \u03b22-AR expression in PDL tissues and their features in PDL cells. \u03b22-AR expressed in rat PDL tissues and human PDL cells (HPDLCs) derived from two different patients (HPDLCs-2G and -3S). Rat PDL tissue with occlusal loading showed high \u03b22-AR expression, while its expression was downregulated in that without loading. In HPDLCs, \u03b22-AR expression was increased exposed to stretch loading. The gene expression of PDL-related molecules was investigated in PDL clone cells (2-23 cells) overexpressing \u03b22-AR. Their gene expression and intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were also investigated in HPDLCs treated with a specific \u03b22-AR agonist, fenoterol (FEN). Overexpression of \u03b22-AR significantly promoted the gene expression of PDL-related molecules in 2 to 23 cells. FEN led to an upregulation in the expression of PDL-related molecules and increased intracellular cAMP levels in HPDLCs. In both HPDLCs, inhibition of cAMP signaling by using protein kinase A inhibitor suppressed the FEN-induced gene expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. Our findings suggest that the occlusal force is important for \u03b22-AR expression in PDL tissue and \u03b22-AR is involved in fibroblastic differentiation and collagen synthesis of PDL cells. The signaling through \u03b22-AR might be important for restoration and homeostasis of PDL tissue.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2020-03-03", "authors": ["SayuriHamano", "AtsushiTomokiyo", "DaigakuHasegawa", "AsukaYuda", "HidekiSugii", "ShinichiroYoshida", "HiromiMitarai", "NaohisaWada", "HidefumiMaeda"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.29706"}

The objective of this study was to determine Toxoplasma gondii infection in lambs from Henan province, China. A total of 166 lamb hearts were collected from 2017 to 2019. T. gondii infection was determined by the Modified Agglutination Test (MAT) using heart juice of lambs. 11 isolates (TgSheepCHn3 - TgSheepCHn13) were obtained from samples with MAT titers \u22651:100. The rate of T. gondii isolation increased with antibody titer against T. gondii (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No isolate was obtained from samples with titer 1:25 and 1:50, suggesting the cut-off titer for MAT is better set at 1:100. With cut-off value of 1:100, IgG antibodies to T. gondii were found in 25.3% (42/166) of the lambs by MAT. T. gondii parasite was not found in IHC and HE-stained tissue sections of lamb hearts (0/166). Sixty-seven heart tissues with \u22651:25 MAT titers were subjected to acid pepsin digestion and detected T. gondii by PCR. Only 7.5% (5/67) of DNA amplified products were found in heart tissues by the primer TOX5/TOX8. Brain tissue cysts were observed in all mice infected with the 11 isolates at day 60 post infection, suggesting these isolates are non-lethal to mice. PCR-RFLP analysis revealed that 7 isolates belonged to ToxoDB#2, 4 isolates belonged to ToxoDB#4. This is the first isolation of ToxoDB#2 and ToxoDB#4 from lambs in China.

{"title": "Single-Cell Determination of Cardiac Microtissue Structure and Function Using Light Sheet Microscopy.", "abstract": "Native cardiac tissue is composed of heterogeneous cell populations that work cooperatively for proper tissue function; thus, engineered tissue models have moved toward incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in an effort to recapitulate native multicellular composition and organization. Cardiac tissue models composed of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) require inclusion of non-myocytes to promote stable tissue formation, yet the specific contributions of the supporting non-myocyte population on the parenchymal CMs and cardiac microtissues have to be fully dissected. This gap can be partly attributed to limitations in technologies able to accurately study the individual cellular structure and function that comprise intact three-dimensional (3D) tissues. The ability to interrogate the cell-cell interactions in 3D tissue constructs has been restricted by conventional optical imaging techniques that fail to adequately penetrate multicellular microtissues with sufficient spatial resolution. Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) overcomes these constraints to enable single-cell resolution structural and functional imaging of intact cardiac microtissues. Multicellular spatial distribution analysis of heterotypic cardiac cell populations revealed that CMs and cardiac fibroblasts were randomly distributed throughout 3D microtissues. Furthermore, calcium imaging of live cardiac microtissues enabled single-cell detection of CM calcium activity, which showed that functional heterogeneity correlated with spatial location within the tissues. This study demonstrates that LSFM can be utilized to determine single-cell spatial and functional interactions of multiple cell types within intact 3D engineered microtissues, thereby facilitating the determination of structure-function relationships at both tissue-level and single-cell resolution. Impact statement The ability to achieve single-cell resolution by advanced three-dimensional light imaging techniques enables exquisite new investigation of multicellular analyses in native and engineered tissues. In this study, light sheet fluorescence microscopy was used to define structure-function relationships of distinct cell types in engineered cardiac microtissues by determining heterotypic cell distributions and interactions throughout the tissues as well as by assessing regional differences in calcium handing functional properties at the individual cardiomyocyte level.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Engineered cardiac tissue (ECT) is a promising treatment to restore function to the damaged myocardium; however, for these treatments to become a reality, tissue fabrication must be amenable to scalable production and be used in suspension culture. Here, we have developed a low-cost and scalable emulsion-based method for producing ECT microspheres from poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-fibrinogen encapsulated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Cell-laden microspheres were formed via water-in-oil emulsification; encapsulation occurred by suspending the cells in hydrogel precursor solution at cell densities from 5 to 60 million cells/ml, adding to mineral oil and vortexing. Microsphere diameters ranged from 30 to 570\u2009\u03bcm; size variability was decreased by the addition of 2% poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate. Initial cell encapsulation density impacted the ability for mESCs to grow and differentiate, with the greatest success occurring at higher cell densities. Microspheres differentiated into dense spheroidal ECTs with spontaneous contractions occurring as early as Day 10 of cardiac differentiation; furthermore, these ECT microspheres exhibited appropriate temporal changes in gene expression and response to pharmacological stimuli.

In addition to accelerated aging, these mice develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at ~13 months of age, presumably due to overt mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite evidence of bioenergetic disruption within heart mitochondria, there is little information about the underlying changes to the mitochondrial proteome that either directly underly or predict respiratory insufficiency in mutator mice. Herein, nLC-MS/MS was used to interrogate the mitochondria-enriched proteome of heart and skeletal muscle of aged mutator mice. The mitochondrial proteome from heart tissue was then correlated with respiratory conductance data to identify protein biomarkers of respiratory insufficiency. The majority of downregulated proteins in mutator mitochondria were subunits of respiratory complexes I and IV, including both nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Interestingly, the mitochondrial-encoded complex V subunits, were unchanged or upregulated in mutator mitochondria, suggesting a robustness to mtDNA mutation. Finally, the proteins most strongly correlated with respiratory conductance were PPM1K, NDUFB11, and C15orf61. These results suggest that mitochondrial mutator mice undergo a specific loss of mitochondrial complexes I and IV that limit their respiratory function independent of an upregulation of complex V.

In this review, we focus on noncoding RNA-based studies conducted mainly in large-animal models, including pigs, rabbits, dogs, and nonhuman primates. The obstacles and promises of targeting long noncoding RNAs and circRNAs as therapeutic modalities in humans are specifically discussed. We also describe novel ex vivo methods based on human cells and tissues, such as engineered heart tissues and living myocardial slices that could help bridging the gap between in vivo models and clinical applications in the future. Finally, we summarize antisense oligonucleotide drugs that have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for targeting mRNAs and discuss the progress of noncoding RNA-based drugs in clinical trials. Additional factors, such as drug chemistry, drug formulations, different routes of administration, and the advantages of RNA-based drugs, are also included in the present review. Recently, first therapeutic miRNA-based inhibitory strategies have been tested in heart failure patients as well as healthy volunteers to study effects on wound healing (NCT04045405; NCT03603431).

{"title": "MicroRNA-489 suppresses isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis by downregulating histone deacetylase 2.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases. Several studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRs) are associated with the development of cardiac fibrosis. However, to date, the underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-489 in cardiac fibrosis have not been studied. The present study investigated the biological function of miR-489 in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis. It was observed that miR-489 was downregulated in the heart tissue and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) obtained from rats with ISO-induced cardiac fibrosis, as compared with the levels in the control group. By contrast, the expression levels of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), collagen I (Col1A1) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were increased in the heart tissue and CFs obtained from ISO-treated rats compared with the control group. Furthermore, ISO-treated CFs were transfected with a miR-489 mimic, which resulted in decreased viability and differentiation of CFs compared with the control group. Bioinformatics analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay further revealed that HDAC2 is a downstream target of miR-489. Subsequently, a loss-of-function experiment demonstrated that depletion of HDAC2 decreased the expression levels of Col1A1 and \u03b1-SMA in CFs.

Forty C57B/L6 mice in similar physiological status were selected and randomly divided into sham operation (Sham) group (n=10), AMI group (n=10), Flu group (n=10) and Flu + Angiotensin II (Ang II) (Ang II) group (n=10). The pathological changes in heart tissues were detected via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and apoptosis of myocardial cells was detected via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Moreover, the expression levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined using relevant kits, and the expression levels of Ras homolog gene family (Rho)-associated coiled-coil protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), ROCK2, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in the infarction region were determined using Western blotting. The infarction area in mice in Flu group was significantly smaller than that in AMI group. In AMI group, the level of MDA in the serum and infarction tissues was remarkably higher than that in Sham group (P<0.05), while that of SOD significantly declined (P<0.05). The level of MDA in Flu group was obviously lower than that in AMI group (P<0.05). The expression levels of Bax, NF-\u03baB, ROCK1 and ROCK2 were obviously higher in AMI group than those in Sham group, while they were obviously lower in Flu group than those in AMI group (P<0.05). After the Rho member A (RhoA)/ROCK pathway agonist Ang II was added, the mitigation effect of Flu on myocardial apoptosis in the infarction region in AMI mice was evidently weakened.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be critical regulators in the development of cardiac fibrosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of action of miRNA (miR)-26b in cardiac fibrosis have not yet been extensively studied. In the present study, the expression levels of miR-26b were downregulated in isoproterenol (ISO)-treated cardiac tissues and CFs. Moreover, miR-26b overexpression inhibited the cell viability of ISO-treated CFs and decreased the protein levels of collagen I and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter assays indicated that Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) was the target of miR-26b, and that its expression levels were decreased in miR-26b-treated cells. In addition, Keap1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-26b on ISO-induced cardiac fibrosis, as demonstrated by cell viability, and the upregulation of collagen I and \u03b1-SMA expression levels. Furthermore, inhibition of Keap1 expression led to the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which induced the transcriptional activation of antioxidant/detoxifying proteins in order to protect against cardiac fibrosis.

In this study, we report the design, development and evaluation of a novel dual-ligand functionalized core-shell chitosan-based nanocarrier for the selective delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nFollowing factorial design experiments, DOX was initially complexed with negatively charged carboxymethyl chitosan-g-poly(acrylate) and then the complex was coated with a positively charged dual-ligand (lactobionic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid)-conjugated chitosan. The developed active targeting system was then tested in vitro on Hep-G2 cells using flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging.\nThe obtained results proved the ability of the dual-ligand system to enhance the intracellular uptake of the drug by 4-fold and 8-fold after 4 hrs and 24 hrs of incubation, respectively. The efficiency of the dual-ligand functionalized nanoparticles was also tested in vivo on Wistar rats with induced liver tumors. Testing of serum biomarkers (albumin, creatinine, urea, alpha fetoprotein, ALT, AST and ALP) in addition to histopathological microscopic examination of liver, kidney and heart tissues confirmed the enhanced safety of the developed targeted nanocarrier system compared to the conventional DOX.\nThe developed targeted system showed improved intracellular drug delivery and uptake as well as enhanced safety profile.

Here, we propose the largest AC cohort unbiased by technical and biological factors. MiRNA profiling on nine right ventricular tissue, nine blood samples of AC patients, and four controls highlighted 10 differentially expressed miRNAs in common.

{"title": "Spatially Discordant Repolarization Alternans in the Absence of Conduction Velocity Restitution.", "abstract": "Spatially discordant alternans (SDA) of action potential duration (APD) has been widely observed in cardiac tissue and is linked to cardiac arrhythmogenesis. Theoretical studies have shown that conduction velocity restitution (CVR) is required for the formation of SDA. However, this theory is not completely supported by experiments, indicating that other mechanisms may exist. In this study, we carried out computer simulations using mathematical models of action potentials to investigate the mechanisms of SDA in cardiac tissue. We show that when CVR is present and engaged, such as fast pacing from one side of the tissue, the spatial pattern of APD in the tissue undergoes either spatially concordant alternans or SDA, independent of initial conditions or tissue heterogeneities. When CVR is not engaged, such as simultaneous pacing of the whole tissue or under normal/slow heart rates, the spatial pattern of APD in the tissue can have multiple solutions, including spatially concordant alternans and different SDA patterns, depending on heterogeneous initial conditions or pre-existing repolarization heterogeneities. In homogeneous tissue, curved nodal lines are not stable, which either evolve into straight lines or disappear. However, in heterogeneous itssue, curved nodal lines can be stable, depending on their initial locations and shapes relative to the structure of the heterogeneity. Therefore, CVR-induced SDA and non-CVR-induced SDA exhibit different dynamical properties, which may be responsible for the different SDA properties observed in experimental studies and arrhythmogenesis in different clinical settings.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2020-02-27", "authors": ["ChunliHuang", "ZhenSong", "JulianLandaw", "ZhilinQu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2020.02.008"}

LC-MS/MS methods for analyzing nine active components (i.e. loganin, hesperidin, epimedin C, icariin, psoralen, isopsoralen, baohuoside I, morroniside and specnuezhenide) of LJF in cardiac tissue samples were established, and the components were then analyzed in left ventricular wall (LVW) and right ventricular wall (RVW) in parallel at same time point postdose for three dose groups. The results showed that most analytical component levels in LVW (hypertrophic myocardium) were only 39-74% of those in RVW (normal myocardium); however, psoralen and isopsoralen levels in LVW were equal to or even greater than the levels in RVW, suggesting that the hypertrophic myocardium tissue affinity of psoralen and isopsoralen might overcome the negative effect of decreased blood flow on distribution.

{"title": "Mandibular Advancement Devices Prevent the Adverse Cardiac Effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS).", "abstract": "Although considerable research highlights the interactions between obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and cardiovascular diseases, the effect of mandibular advancement device (MAD) treatment on cardiovascular complications in OSAHS patients remains unclear. We evaluated the effect of OSAHS treatment with MADs on the myocardium. All methods in this study were in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of the medical ethics committee in Hospital of Stomatology, Hebei Medical University approved the work. Thirty New Zealand rabbits were randomized into three groups: the control group, Group OSAHS, and Group MAD. Hydrophilic polyacrylamide gel was injected into the soft palate of the rabbits to induce OSAHS. In Group MAD, a MAD was positioned after OSAHS induction. All animals were induced to sleep in a supine position for 4-6\u2009h/day for 8 weeks. Echocardiography was used to determine the structure and function of the heart. The histological changes were detected by optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The levels of ET-1(endothelin-1) and Ang II (Angiotensin II) in the plasma were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of ET-1 mRNA in heart tissue was detected by RT-PCR. Histological abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, and left ventricular dysfunctions were demonstrated in Group OSAHS, and the abnormities were rescued with MAD treatment. Higher levels of plasma ET-1 and Ang II and elevated expression of ET-1 mRNA in cardiac tissue were detected in Group OSAHS compared with Group MAD and the control group. The blood oxygen saturation was negatively correlated with the levels of ET-1 and Ang II. OSAHS-induced elevated levels of ET-1 and Ang II may be attributed to myocardial structural abnormalities and dysfunction. Early treatment of MADs may play an important role in preventing myocardial damage in OSAHS rabbit model.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-02-27", "authors": ["ChunyanLiu", "WenjingKang", "ShilongZhang", "XingQiao", "XiuchunYang", "ZhengZhou", "HaiyanLu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-60034-1\n10.1016/j.smrv.2016.07.002\n10.1053/j.semperi.2015.05.010\n10.1007/s11910-013-0431-7\n10.1164/ajrccm.163.1.2001008\n10.1590/s1806-37562016000000190\n10.1007/s11325-011-0566-1\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00301.2007\n10.1093/sleep/31.6.809\n10.1159/000323266\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2008.05.010\n10.1007/s00204-015-1477-x\n10.1016/S0895-7061(02)03267-3\n10.1123/jpah.2016-0289\n10.1016/j.sleep.2016.06.023\n10.1136/thorax.55.3.224\n10.4103/0975-7406.155915\n10.1016/j.sleep.2008.03.011\n10.1016/j.disamonth.2011.06.005\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04852\n10.1378/chest.124.2.594\n10.1007/s11325-015-1153-7\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2007.06.016\n10.1164/rccm.200311-1571OC\n10.1016/j.smrv.2017.10.004\n10.1093/ejo/cju041\n10.1093/ejo/cju042\n10.1016/S1569-9048(03)00082-X\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00336\n10.1016/j.npep.2018.12.004\n10.1016/j.lfs.2017.11.001\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.05.077\n10.1007/s11325-013-0926-0\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71141-7\n10.1164/rccm.200608-1141OC\n10.5603/CJ.2013.0043\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094545\n10.1007/s00395-014-0427-8\n10.21037/jtd.2018.11.48\n10.1023/A:1007042729486\n10.1097/00004872-199816080-00001\n10.1161/01.CIR.91.6.1725"}

Icariin (ICA) is a major flavonoid isolated from the traditional oriental herbal medicine Epimedium that has been recently proved to show potential therapeutic efficacy on T2DM. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of how ICA improved DCM in rat models.\nTo corroborate myocardial improvement by ICA, we managed to establish the T2DM rat model by streptozotocin (STZ) administration and high-glucose-high-fat diet.\nThe rats with T2DM showed severe insulin resistance, left ventricular dysfunction, aberrant lipids deposition, cardiac inflammation, and fibrosis compared with the control group. All these pathological symptoms were ameliorated by the treatment of ICA. The levels of extracellular matrix proteins of heart tissue significantly declined in ICA-treated rats.\nICA may exert as a protector in T2DM-induced DCM by reducing extracellular matrix proteins in the heart tissue, implicating its potential role for the treatment of human DCM.", "journal": "Pharmacology", "date": "2020-02-26", "authors": ["ChenQiao", "HuiWang", "ZhengyuSong", "YuyinDing", "JunyeTao", "JiyeAa", "XuanshengDing"], "doi": "10.1159/000505408"}
{"title": "Non-ohmic tissue conduction in cardiac electrophysiology: Upscaling the non-linear voltage-dependent conductance of gap junctions.", "abstract": "Gap junctions are key mediators of intercellular communication in cardiac tissue, and their function is vital to sustaining normal cardiac electrical activity. Conduction through gap junctions strongly depends on the hemichannel arrangement and transjunctional voltage, rendering the intercellular conductance highly non-Ohmic, particularly under steady-state regimes of conduction. Despite this marked non-linear behavior, current tissue-level models of cardiac conduction are rooted in the assumption that gap-junctions conductance is constant (Ohmic), which results in inaccurate predictions of electrical propagation, particularly in the low junctional-coupling regime observed under pathological conditions. In this work, we present a novel non-Ohmic homogenization model (NOHM) of cardiac conduction that is suitable to tissue-scale simulations. Using non-linear homogenization theory, we develop a conductivity model that seamlessly upscales the voltage-dependent conductance of gap junctions, without the need of explicitly modeling gap junctions. The NOHM model allows for the simulation of electrical propagation in tissue-level cardiac domains that accurately resemble that of cell-based microscopic models for a wide range of junctional coupling scenarios, recovering key conduction features at a fraction of the computational complexity. A unique feature of the NOHM model is the possibility of upscaling the response of non-symmetric gap-junction conductance distributions, which result in conduction velocities that strongly depend on the direction of propagation, thus allowing to model the normal and retrograde conduction observed in certain regions of the heart. We envision that the NOHM model will enable organ-level simulations that are informed by sub- and inter-cellular mechanisms, delivering an accurate and predictive in-silico tool for understanding the heart function.

{"title": "New Strategies to Enhance Myocardial Regeneration: Expectations and Challenges from Preclinical Evidence.", "abstract": "Nowadays, cardiac regeneration is an emerging topic in the cardiovascular field because of the compelling need for effective therapies for repairing or replacing cardiac tissue damaged by pathological or physiological conditions. Indeed, irreversible myocardial remodeling which follows acute myocardial infarction represents a serious burden of this century. In this context, a great improvement in pharmacological and interventional techniques is accompanied by a big challenge of cardiac regenerative medicine. In the last 20 years, several clinical trials tried to investigate the role of different types of stem cells in promoting cardiac repair. However, the promising results obtained in the preclinical trials have not yet been reproduced in patients. Thus, the development of novel strategies to improve stem cell efficiency became imperative.

{"title": "3D bioprinting and its potential impact on cardiac failure treatment: An industry perspective.", "abstract": "3D printing technologies are emerging as a disruptive innovation for the treatment of patients in cardiac failure. The ability to create custom devices, at the point of care, will affect both the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases. The introduction of bioinks containing cells and biomaterials and the development of new computer assisted design and computer assisted manufacturing systems have ushered in a new technology known as 3D bioprinting. Small scale 3D bioprinting has successfully created cardiac tissue microphysiological systems. 3D bioprinting provides an opportunity to evaluate the assembly of specific parts of the heart and most notably heart valves. With the continuous development of instrumentation and bioinks and a complete understanding of cardiac tissue development, it is proposed that 3D bioprinting may permit the assembly of a heart described as a total biofabricated heart.", "journal": "APL bioengineering", "date": "2020-02-26", "authors": ["Ravi KBirla", "Stuart KWilliams"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5128371\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1016/j.healun.2019.08.004\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.12.011\n10.1002/ar.a.10057\n10.1089/ten.2004.10.1566\n10.1089/ten.2006.0101\n10.1073/pnas.0400164101\n10.1016/S0167-7799(03)00033-7\n10.1002/adhm.201701504\n10.1007/s11626-008-9094-0\n10.1007/s11626-008-9114-0\n10.1007/s11626-009-9234-1\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.2008.00591.x\n10.1089/tea.2007.0351\n10.1007/s13239-015-0211-4\n10.1097/MAT.0000000000000642\n10.2217/17460751.3.3.399\n10.1042/BA20070139\n10.1097/MAT.0000000000000233\n10.1253/circj.CJ-15-1147\n10.1080/14017430410004632\n10.1038/ncomms4935\n10.1111/aor.12318\n10.1038/nm1684\n10.1038/ncomms3307\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.080\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.1016/j.drudis.2016.04.006\n10.1007/s10439-016-1612-8\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab25f9\n10.1186/s13036-016-0045-0\n10.1002/smll.201602553\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1016/j.pcad.2014.12.002\n10.1016/j.jcin.2015.03.045\n10.1152/ajpheart.00735.2011\n10.1161/hc4201.097192\n10.3727/096368909788535004\n10.1089/ten.2007.0025\n10.5966/sctm.2013-0046\n10.1002/jbm.b.31831\n10.1007/BF02723003\n10.1016/j.jvs.2008.08.101\n10.1115/1.4024575\n10.1002/stem.1921\n10.1161/CIRCEP.109.928820\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.04.015\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2668\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.02.003\n10.1017/S1047951113000991\n10.4037/NCI.0000000000000099\n10.1002/jbm.a.34420\n10.1088/1758-5082/4/3/035005\n10.1517/14712598.2015.1064109\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305365\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001317\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.06.024\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.003\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.12.047\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.03.009\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.04.011\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3"}
{"title": "Alpha-Mangostin Improves Cardiac Hypertrophy and Fibrosis and Associated Biochemical Parameters in High-Fat/High-Glucose Diet and Low-Dose Streptozotocin Injection-Induced Type 2 Diabetic Rats.", "abstract": "The aim of present study was to analyze the effect of alpha-mangostin on cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and biochemical parameters in high-fat/high-glucose diet and low-dose streptozotocin injection (HF/HG/STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic rats.\nDiabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by giving a combination of high-fat/high-glucose (HF/HG) diet for 3 weeks and followed by low-dose streptozotocin intraperitoneal injection (STZ; 35 mg/kg) at Week-3 and the HF/HG diet was continued until 8 weeks. The diabetic rats were then divided into four groups (each, n=6): untreated diabetic group (HF/HG/STZ); diabetic group treated with metformin 200 mg/kg/day (HF/HG/STZ+Metformin); diabetic group treated with alpha-mangostin 100 mg/kg/day (HF/HG/STZ+AM100); and diabetic group treated with alpha-mangostin 200 mg/kg/day (HF/HG/STZ+AM200) and all were given by oral gavage for 8 weeks. We also included a control group (C) treated with AM200 (C+AM200). The role of alpha-mangostin was assessed through its effect on blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR, blood pressure, body weight, pro-inflammatory cytokines in cardiac tissue, serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST), lipid profiles (cholesterol and triglyceride), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.\nDiabetic rats treated with alpha-mangostin in both doses for 8 weeks showed decrease in blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR, and blood pressure.

{"title": "Irigenin treatment alleviates doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress via the increase of miR-425.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an e\ufb00 ;ective chemotherapeutic drug to suppress the progression of various types of tumors. However, its clinical application has been largely limited due to its potential cardiotoxicity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerged as critical regulators of cardiac injury. This study was aimed to explore the effects of irigenin (IR), as an isoflavonoid isolated from the rhizome of Belamcanda chinensis, on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity using the in vivo and in vitrostudies. The results indicated that DOX-induced fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction and injury were markedly attenuated by IR through reducing apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in heart tissue samples. Importantly, DOX resulted in a remarkable decrease of miR-425 in heart tissues and cells, which was significantly rescued by IR. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) was discovered to be a direct target of miR-425. DOX induced over-expression of RIPK1 both in vivo and in vitro, which were greatly decreased by IR. Transfection with miR-425 mimic could inhibit RIPK1 expression, whereas reducing miR-425 increased RIPK1 expression levels. In parallel to miR-425 over-expression, RIPK1 knockdown could attenuate apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammation in HL-1 cells. However, over-expression of RIPK1 markedly abolished miR-425 mimic-induced apoptosis, ROS accumulation and inflammatory response in DOX-exposed cells. Herein, miR-425 could ameliorate cardiomyocyte injury through directly targeting RIPK1. Furthermore, activation of miR-425 by IR markedly improved DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and therefore IR could be considered as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of cardiac injury.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2020-02-26", "authors": ["LangtaoGuo", "XuepingZheng", "EnweiWang", "XushengJia", "GangWang", "JianWen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109784"}

{"title": "Development of endomyocardial fibrosis model using a cell patterning technique: In vitro interaction of cell coculture of 3T3 fibroblasts and RL-14 cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Cardiac functions can be altered by changes in the microstructure of the heart, i.e., remodeling of the cardiac tissue, which may activate pathologies such as hypertrophy, dilation, or cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac fibrosis can develop due to an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, which are products of the activation of fibroblasts. In this context, the anatomical-histological change may interfere with the functioning of the cardiac tissue, which requires specialized cells for its operation. The purpose of the present study was to determine the cellular interactions and morphological changes in cocultures of 3T3 fibroblasts and RL-14 cardiomyocytes via the generation of a platform an in vitro model. For this purpose, a platform emulating the biological characteristics of endomyocardial fibrosis was generated using a cell patterning technique to study morphological cellular changes in compact and irregular patterns of fibrosis. It was found that cellular patterns emulating the geometrical distributions of endomyocardial fibrosis generated morphological changes after interaction of the RL-14 cardiomyocytes with the 3T3 fibroblasts. Through this study, it was possible to evaluate biological characteristics such as cell proliferation, adhesion, and spatial distribution, which are directly related to the type of emulated endomyocardial fibrosis. This research concluded that fibroblasts inhibited the proliferation of cardiomyocytes via their interaction with specific microarchitectures. This behavior is consistent with the histopathological distribution of cardiac fibrosis; therefore, the platform developed in this research could be useful for the in vitro assessment of cellular microdomains.

Nonuniformity of the native tissue mechanical properties contributes to the development of heart dysfunctions, yet the current in vitro cardiac tissue models often fail to recapitulate the mechanical nonuniformity. To address this issue, a 3D cardiac microtissue model is developed with engineered mechanical nonuniformity, enabled by 3D-printed hybrid matrices composed of fibers with different diameters. When escalating the complexity of tissue mechanical environments, cardiac microtissues start to develop maladaptive hypercontractile phenotypes, demonstrated in both contractile motion analysis and force-power analysis.

{"title": "A novel role of cardiac inwardly rectifying potassium channels explaining autonomic cardiovascular dysfunctions in a cuprizone-induced mouse model of multiple sclerosis.", "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), believed to have an autoimmune etiology. MS patients showed an increased cardiovascular (CV) risk probably related to an impairment in the autonomic control of CV functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Inwardly-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels play a key role in cardiac excitability by contributing to the repolarization phase of action potential and were recently identified as target of the autoantibody response in MS patients. Therefore, we investigated the role of cardiac Kir channels in the CV dysfunctions occurring in MS. Cardiac functions were evaluated by electrocardiographic recordings (ECG) in cuprizone-fed C57BL/6 mice, a classic demyelination animal model. Gene expression profiling of cardiac Kir2.2, Kir4.1 and Kir6.2 channels was performed using real-time PCR in mice. Cuprizone-induced mouse model was confirmed by immunohistochemistry analysis showing demyelination in the corpus callosum.

DOX-induced cardiotoxicity model in rats and H9c2 cells was established. Therapeutic effects of HG/[6]-GR on haemodynamics, serum indices and histopathology of cardiac tissue were analysed. Cell mitochondrial energy phenotype and cell mitochondrial fuel flex were measured by a Seahorse XFp analyser. Moreover, UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS was performed to explore the potential metabolites affecting the therapeutic effects and pathological process of CHF. To further investigate the potential mechanism of HG/[6]-GR, mRNA and protein expression levels of RAAS and LKB1/AMPK/Sirt1-related pathways were detected. The present data demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of HG/[6]-GR combination on CHF were presented in ameliorating heart function, down-regulation serum indices and alleviating histological damage of heart tissue. Besides, HG/[6]-GR has an effect on increasing cell viability of H9c2 cells, ameliorating DOX-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and elevating mitochondrial OCR and ECAR value. Metabolomics analyses showed that the therapeutic effect of HG/[6]-GR combination is mainly associated with the regulation of fatty acid metabolites and energy metabolism pathways.

Additionally, to erythropoietic EPO activity, an antiapoptotic effect has been described in a wide spectrum of tissues. EPO low levels are found in the central nervous system (CNS), while EPO-R is expressed in most CNS cell types. In spite of EPO-R high levels expressed during the hypoxicischemic brain, insufficient production of endogenous cerebral EPO could be the cause of determined circuit alterations that lead to the loss of specific neuronal populations. In the heart, high EPO-R expression in cardiac progenitor cells appears to contribute to myocardial regeneration under EPO stimulation. Several lines of evidence have linked EPO to an antiapoptotic role in CNS and in heart tissue. In this review, an antiapoptotic role of EPO/EPO-R system in both brain and heart under hypoxic conditions, such as epilepsy and sudden death (SUDEP) has been resumed.

On the other hand, the IBI is observed to vary significantly under an external periodic drive. Interestingly, when the period of the external drive is about two times the intrinsic IBI of the tissue without pulling, the IBI as a function of time exhibits a wave packet structure. Our experimental results can be understood theoretically by a phase-coupled model under external driving. In particular, the theoretical prediction of the wave-packet period as a function of the normalized driving period agrees excellently with the observations.

However, there is a clear lack of techniques and methodologies for studying the propagation of action potential in a heart with structural defects. In this article, we present a modified version of the bidomain model, derived using homogenisation techniques with the assumption of existence of diffusive inclusions in the cardiac tissue. The diffusive inclusions represent regions without electrically active myocytes, for example, fat, fibrosis, and so forth. We present an application of this model to a rat heart. Starting from high-resolution MRI, the geometry of the heart is built and meshed using image processing techniques. We perform a study of the effects of tissue heterogeneities induced by diffusive inclusions on the velocity and shape of the depolarisation wavefront.

{"title": "High-intensity interval training increases myocardial levels of Klotho and protects the heart against ischaemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "What is the central question of this study? Can short-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) contribute to the reduction of ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury by enhancing the levels of Klotho and its related axes, including myocardial TRPC6 expression, and antioxidant defence as novel possible mechanisms of exercise-induced cadioprotection (EICP) against IR injury? What is the main finding and its importance? The increase of plasma and myocardial levels of Klotho as a result of preconditioning with HIIT and prevention of a significant reduction of Klotho during IR injury can promote cardioprotection and reduce damage by attenuating myocardial TRPC6 expression and increasing antioxidant defence. The present findings may provide a new mechanism in EICP and IR injury, and provide the knowledge to develop preventive and therapeutic approaches.\nCardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery disease, remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, and ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) insult is the main pathological cause leading to death. Exercise training is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and the development of cardioprotection against IR injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of preconditioning with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on myocardial and plasma levels of Klotho and its related axes as novel mechanisms of exercise-induced cardioprotection against IR injury. Seventy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of control, HIIT, sham, IR and HIIT group that underwent IR injury (H-IR). The training group performed five sessions of HIIT on the treadmill. The cardiac IR injury was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30\u00a0min followed by 24\u00a0h reperfusion. Infarct size and histopathological assessment of cardiac tissues were determined through Evans Blue-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and haematoxylin-eosin staining, respectively. We investigated lipid peroxidation and markers of cardiac injury, antioxidant enzymes and the plasma levels of Klotho using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Also, myocardial levels of Klotho and TRPC6 expression were determined by western blot assays. The results demonstrated a significant increase in myocardial and plasma levels of Klotho following HIIT and a significant decrease during IR injury. Myocardial TRPC6 channel expression increased following IR. HIIT also prevented a significant reduction of Klotho during IR and consequently reduced the expression of the TRPC6 channel in the H-IR group compared with the IR group. Furthermore, HIIT decreased the infarct size, cardiac injury, lipid peroxidation, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase myocardial band and cardiac troponin-I, and improved total antioxidant capacity and catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities following IR injury. The findings of the present study suggest that HIIT improves cardioprotection against IR injury and reduces cardiac damages through an increase in myocardial and plasma levels of Klotho and its related axes (TRPC6 and antioxidant defence). These findings can help to develop preventive and therapeutic approaches.", "journal": "Experimental physiology", "date": "2020-02-14", "authors": ["MaralRamez", "FatemehRamezani", "FarinazNasirinezhad", "HamidRajabi"], "doi": "10.1113/EP087994"}
{"title": "Myocardial tissue-specific Dnmt1 knockout in rats protects against pathological injury induced by Adriamycin.", "abstract": "Novel molecular mechanisms of the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) are continuously being discovered, including epigenetic regulation. Among epigenetic marks, the role of DNA hypomethylation in shaping heart morphology and function in vivo and the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy and/or HF, especially in adults, has not been clearly established. Here we show that the strong expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is obviously downregulated in the WT adult rat heart with age. By contrast, the expression of Dnmt1 is upregulated suddenly in heart tissues from pressure overload-induced HF mice and adriamycin-induced cardiac injury and HF mice, consistent with the increased expression of Dnmt1 observed in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHCM) patients. To further assess the role of Dnmt1, we generated myocardium-specific Dnmt1 knockout (Dnmt1 KO) rats using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Echocardiographic and histopathological examinations demonstrated that Dnmt1 deficiency is associated with resistance to cardiac pathological changes and protection at the global and organization levels in response to pathological stress. Furthermore, Dnmt1 deficiency in the myocardium restricts the expressional reprogramming of genes and activates pathways involved in myocardial protection and anti-apoptosis in response to pathological stress. Transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylation analyses revealed that these changes in regulation are linked to alterations in the methylation status of genes due to Dnmt1 knockout. The present study is the first to investigate in vivo the impact of genome-wide cardiac DNA methyltransferase deficiency on physiological development and the pathological processes of heart tissues in response to stress. The exploration of the role of epigenetics in the development, modification, and prevention of cardiomyopathy and HF is in a very preliminary stage but has an infinite future.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2020-02-14", "authors": ["Tong-TongWu", "Yuan-WuMa", "XuZhang", "WeiDong", "ShanGao", "Ji-ZhengWang", "Lian-FengZhang", "DanLu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41374-020-0402-y"}
{"title": "Research progress on myocardial regeneration: what is new?", "abstract": "The regeneration capacity of cardiomyocytes (CMs) is retained in neonatal mouse hearts but is limited in adult mouse hearts. Myocardial infarction (MI) in adult hearts usually leads to the loss of large amounts of cardiac tissue, and then accelerates the process of cardiac remodeling and heart failure. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the potential mechanisms of CM regeneration in the neonates and develop potential therapies aimed at promoting CM regeneration and cardiac repair in adults. Currently, studies indicate that a number of mechanisms are involved in neonatal endogenous myocardial regeneration, including cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, non-coding RNA, signaling pathways, acute inflammation, hypoxia, protein kinases, and others. Understanding the mechanisms of regeneration in neonatal CMs after MI provides theoretical support for the studies related to the promotion of heart repair after MI in adult mammals. However, several difficulties in the study of CM regeneration still need to be overcome.

CK, total CK, LDH, and troponin T were measured in serum and G-CSF, G-CSFR and C-Kit proteins were measured by the Western Blot method in the heart tissue.\nThe results of this study showed that enzymes of CK, total CK, LDH, troponin T had a significant increase in both MI and HIIT+MI groups compared to the other two groups (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and these indices in the MI group were significantly higher than the HIIT+MI group.

{"title": "Vacuolated cardiomyocytes in human endomyocardial biopsy specimens.", "abstract": "We encountered an unfamiliar finding during electron microscopic examination of an endomyocardial biopsy obtained from a 55-year-old woman suffering from heart failure due to dilated phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Many cardiomyocytes contained large vacuoles that were mainly empty except for small amounts of amorphous substrate. These were not autophagic vacuoles, as they lacked limiting membranes. Six years later, we encountered similar histological findings in three successive biopsies sourced from another hospital. They were obtained from a 77-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a 28-year-old woman with endocardial fibrosis, and a 33-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy. This biopsy was the second for the endocardial fibrosis patient, and her first biopsy showed no vacuoles within cardiomyocytes. Close inspection of the procedures revealed that in all of these cases the fixed biopsy specimens were carried to the hospital from other institutes using a refrigerated courier service. We then fixed rat heart tissues, froze them once, and processed them for electron microscopy. In that experiment, we were able to reproduce the vacuolar cardiomyocytes, thereby demonstrating it to be a laboratory artifact. We therefore want to emphasize to physicians not to freeze biopsy specimens and not to use a refrigerated courier service for their transport. <", "journal": "Journal of cardiology cases", "date": "2020-02-12", "authors": ["GenzouTakemura", "KenjiOnoue", "TakanoriArimoto", "TetsuWatanabe", "AkikoTsujimoto", "ChihiroTakada", "HideshiOkada", "TomoyaNakano", "YasuhiroSakaguchi", "NagisaMiyazaki", "TakatomoWatanabe", "HiromitsuKanamori", "ShinjiOgura", "YoshihikoSaito", "TakakoFujiwara", "HisayoshiFujiwara", "YasuakiHotta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jccase.2019.09.012"}
{"title": "Autophagy Activation in Zebrafish Heart Regeneration.", "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays a key role in the maintenance of overall cellular health. While it has been suggested that autophagy may elicit cardioprotective and pro-survival modulating functions, excessive activation of autophagy can also be detrimental. In this regard, the zebrafish is considered a hallmark model for vertebrate regeneration, since contrary to adult mammals, it is able to faithfully regenerate cardiac tissue. Interestingly, the role that autophagy may play in zebrafish heart regeneration has not been studied yet. In the present work, we hypothesize that, in the context of a well-established injury model of ventricular apex resection, autophagy plays a critical role during cardiac regeneration and its regulation can directly affect the zebrafish regenerative potential. We studied the autophagy events occurring upon injury using electron microscopy, in vivo tracking of autophagy markers, and protein analysis. Additionally, using pharmacological tools, we investigated how rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, affects regeneration relevant processes. Our results show that a tightly regulated autophagic response is triggered upon injury and during the early stages of the regeneration process. Furthermore, treatment with rapamycin caused an impairment in the cardiac regeneration outcome. These findings are reminiscent of the pathophysiological description of an injured human heart and hence put forward the zebrafish as a model to study the poorly understood double-sword effect that autophagy has in cardiac homeostasis.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-02-12", "authors": ["Myra NCh\u00e1vez", "Rodrigo AMorales", "CamilaL\u00f3pez-Crisosto", "Juan CarlosRoa", "Miguel LAllende", "SergioLavandero"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-59106-z\n10.1038/nature03029\n10.1007/s00726-014-1787-y\n10.1016/j.molimm.2017.02.013\n10.1038/ncb0910-823\n10.1073/pnas.1611282113\n10.1080/15548627.2016.1158373\n10.1007/s00441-018-2829-7\n10.4161/auto.27649\n10.1128/MCB.01005-15\n10.1007/s10741-012-9350-y\n10.1172/JCI73943\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021317-121427\n10.1080/14779072.2016.1202760\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.019\n10.1126/science.1077857\n10.1242/dev.068601\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.107888\n10.1152/ajpregu.00045.2017\n10.1242/bio.20121057\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.07.064\n10.1038/nature08899\n10.1038/nature08804\n10.1038/nature11045\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.12.004\n10.1038/cdd.2013.175\n10.1080/15548627.2016.1207015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0192214\n10.1007/7651_2018_160\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.06.013\n10.1152/ajpheart.00788.2018\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.11.053\n10.1093/cvr/cvr073\n10.1007/s12154-008-0003-5\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1100356\n10.1073/pnas.0809136105\n10.1016/j.cub.2013.08.030\n10.1172/JCI72181\n10.1016/j.biocel.2014.07.010\n10.1242/dev.098459\n10.1186/s12929-017-0315-2\n10.4068/cmj.2018.54.1.10\n10.1002/reg2.83\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.07.007\n10.1007/s10741-016-9533-z\n10.1016/j.devcel.2015.04.001\n10.1073/pnas.1605431113\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.08.127\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.046\n10.1038/cr.2017.84\n10.1007/s10741-018-9708-x\n10.1172/JCI27523\n10.1073/pnas.1015081108\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.05.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0006596\n10.1242/dmm.006148\n10.1186/1471-213X-11-21\n10.1242/dev.060897\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311147\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302022\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.04.007\n10.3390/jcdd5040056\n10.1002/dvdy.24411\n10.1016/bs.mie.2016.10.028\n10.1182/blood-2006-05-024075\n10.1182/blood-2010-10-314120\n10.1006/dbio.2002.0711\n10.1038/nchembio732\n10.1007/978-1-62703-505-7_27\n10.1093/cvr/cvs282\n10.1517/17460441.2.4.571\n10.1093/emboj/19.21.5720\n10.4161/auto.4451\n10.1002/mrd.22489\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018503"}

{"title": "Energetics Equivalent of the Cardiac Force-Length End-Systolic Zone: Implications for Contractility and Economy of Contraction.", "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated the existence of a region on the cardiac mechanics stress-length plane, which we have designated \"The cardiac end-systolic zone.\" The zone is defined as the area on the pressure-volume (or stress-length) plane within which all stress-length contraction profiles reach their end-systolic points. It is enclosed by three boundaries: the isometric end-systolic relation, the work-loop (shortening) end-systolic relation, and the zero-active stress isotonic end-systolic relation. The existence of this zone reflects the contraction-mode dependence of the cardiac end-systolic force-length relations, and has been confirmed in a range of cardiac preparations at the whole-heart, tissue and myocyte levels. This finding has led us to speculate that a comparable zone prevails for cardiac metabolism. Specifically, we hypothesize the existence of an equivalent zone on the energetics plane (heat vs. stress), and that it can be attributed to the recently-revealed heat of shortening in cardiac muscle. To test these hypotheses, we subjected trabeculae to both isometric contractions and work-loop contractions over wide ranges of preloads and afterloads. We found that the heat-stress relations for work-loop contractions were distinct from those of isometric contractions, mirroring the contraction mode-dependence of the stress-length relation. The zone bounded by these contraction-mode dependent heat-stress relations reflects the heat of shortening.

This study aimed to explore the adverse effects and underlying mechanisms of subacute exposure to SiNPs on cardiac function in rats. Results from echocardiographic, ultrastructural and histopathological analysis found that SiNPs induced cardiac contractile dysfunction, accompanied by incomplete myocardial structures, disordered sarcomere segments, interstitial edema and myocyte apoptosis in heart. Levels of myocardial enzymes and inflammatory factors were markedly increased in both serum and heart tissue, accompanied by elevated levels of oxidative damage occurred in the hearts of SiNPs-treated rats. SiNPs significantly upregulated the expressions of inflammation and contraction-related proteins, including JNK, p-JNK, c-Jun, TF and PAR1. Lentivirus transfection of JNK shRNA showed the low-expression of JNK-facilitated F-actin and inhibited TF in the SiNPs-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, SiNPs activated the mRNA and protein levels of JNK/TF/PAR1 pathway, and these effects were significantly dampened after JNK knock down.

AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor, has a central role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. However, its role in cardiac dysfunction after burn injury is unclear. Our hypothesis is that burn injury acts through the AMPK-sirtuin 1-PGC1\u03b1-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2)-ARE signaling pathway, leading to cardiac mitochondrial impairment, resulting in cardiac dysfunction.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham procedure or 60% total body surface area full-thickness burn. Echocardiograms were performed 24 hours post burn. Heart tissue was harvested at 24 hours post burn for biochemistry/molecular biologic analysis. AC16 cardiomyocytes were treated with either sham or burned rat serum (\u00b1AMPK inhibitor/AMPK activator/PGC1\u03b1 activator) for evaluation of cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function by using seahorse in\u00a0vitro.\nBurn injury-induced cardiac dysfunction was measured by echocardiogram. Burn injury suppressed cardiac AMPK, sirtuin 1, and PGC1 expression, leading to acetylation of cardiomyocyte proteins. In addition, burn injury caused NFE2L2 and NFE2L2 regulated antioxidants (heme oxygenase 1, NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1, glutamatecysteine ligase catalytic subunit, manganese superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) to decrease, resulting in cardiac oxidative stress. In\u00a0vitro, AMPK1 activator and PGC1\u03b1 agonist treatment improved Ac16 cell mitochondrial dysfunction, and AMPK1 inhibitor treatment worsened Ac16 cellular damage.\nBurn-induced cardiac dysfunction and cardiac mitochondrial damage occur via the AMPK-sirtuin 1-PGC1\u03b1-NFE2L2-ARE signaling pathway.

In this study, we investigated the potential roles of miR-1 in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy in hypoxia-treated cardiac injury and explored the underlying mechanism using H9c2 cells. Results showed that hypoxic stimulation inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of miR-1 but promoted cell apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR-1 promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation and autophagy in H9c2 cells treated with hypoxia, while its knockdown played an opposite effect. In addition, bioinformatics, luciferase reporter, and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that NOTCH3 was a direct target of miR-1 and its upregulation reversed the effects of miR-1 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy in hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells.

However, before analyzing the expression of target genes, it is crucial to normalize the reference genes, in order to find the most stable gene to be used as an endogenous control. A gene that remains stable in all samples under different treatments is considered a suitable normalizer. In this sense, we aimed to identify stable reference genes for normalization of target genes in the heart and liver tissues from two genetically divergent groups of chickens (Cobb 500\u00ae commercial line and Peloco backyard chickens) under comfort and acute heat stress environmental conditions. Eight reference genes (ACTB, HPRT1, RPL5, EEF1, MRPS27, MRPS30, TFRC and LDHA) were analyzed for expression stability. The samples were obtained from 24 chickens, 12 from the backyard Peloco and 12 from the Cobb 500\u00ae line, exposed to two environmental conditions (comfort and heat stress). Comfort temperature was 23\u00b0C and heat stress temperature was 39.5\u00b0C for one hour. Subsequently, the animals were euthanized, and heart and liver tissue fragments were collected for RNA extraction and amplification. To determine the stability rate of gene expression, three different statistical algorithms were applied: BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder, and to obtain an aggregated stability list, the RankAgregg package of R software was used.\nThe most stable genes using BestKeeper tool, including the two factors (genetic group and environmental condition), were LDHA, RPL5 and MRPS27 for heart tissue, and TFRC, RPL5 and EEF1 for liver tissue. Applying geNorm algorithm, the best reference genes were RPL5, EEF1 and MRPS30 for heart tissue and LDHA, EEF1 and RPL5 for liver. Using the NormFinder algorithm, the best normalizer genes were EEF1, RPL5 and LDHA in heart, and EEF1, RPL5 and ACTB in liver tissue. In the overall ranking obtained by RankAggreg package, considering the three algorithms, the RPL5, EEF1 and LDHA genes were the most stable for heart tissue, whereas RPL5, EEF1 and ACTB were the most stable for liver tissue.\nAccording to the RankAggreg tool classification based on the three different algorithms (BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder), the most stable genes were RPL5, EEF1 and LDHA for heart tissue and RPL5, EEF1 and ACTB for liver tissue of chickens subjected to comfort and acute heat stress environmental conditions.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of sphingosine-1-phosphate on the endothelial glycocalyx during ischemia-reperfusion.\nIsolated hearts from Wistar rats were perfused on a Langendorff system with Krebs-Henseleit buffer and pretreated with sphingosine-1-phosphate (10\u00a0nmol/L) before ischemia-reperfusion. Infarct size was measured by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining (n\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 per group). Cardiac edema was assessed by calculating total water content (n\u00a0=\u00a07 per group) and histologically quantifying the interstitial compartment (n\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 per group). The post-ischemic coronary release of syndecan-1 was quantified using ELISA. Syndecan-1 immunostaining intensity was assessed in perfusion-fixed hearts (n\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 per group).\nPretreatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate decreased infarct size in isolated hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01 vs ischemia-reperfusion). However, sphingosine-1-phosphate had no effect on syndecan-1 levels in the coronary effluent or on the intensity of the syndecan-1 immunostaining signal in cardiac tissue. Heart total water content was not significantly different between control and ischemic groups but was significantly decreased in hearts treated with sphingosine-1-phosphate alone.\nThese results suggest that sphingosine-1-phosphate-induced cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury is not mediated by the maintenance of syndecan-1 in the endothelial glycocalyx.", "journal": "Microcirculation (New York, N.Y. : 1994)", "date": "2020-02-06", "authors": ["HalaAraibi", "Elizabethvan der Merwe", "AsfreeGwanyanya", "RoisinKelly-Laubscher"], "doi": "10.1111/micc.12612"}

Urantide was delivered to rats with AS via tail vein injection for 3,\u00a07\u00a0and\u00a014\u00a0days. Serological indicators were identified by an automated biochemical analyzer. Histomorphological changes in the cardiac tissue of rats were observed by pathological staining techniques. The expression of genes and proteins was assessed using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Localization of proteins was detected by immunofluorescence. Overexpression of urotensin\u00a0II (UII) and its receptor, G protein\u2011coupled receptor\u00a014 (GPR14), was observed in the hearts of rats with AS and the expression of both proteins significantly declined after urantide administration. Triglyceride, total cholesterol, low\u2011density lipoprotein, high\u2011density lipoprotein and calcium levels were improved in rats with AS following treatment with urantide. Notably, urantide was able to antagonize the UII/GPR14 system. Urantide treatment resulted in markedly decreased expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase\u00a02 (MMP\u20112), collagen type\u00a0I/III, and genes and proteins in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. By contrast, TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor\u00a02 (TIMP\u20112) levels were increased. In addition, the MMP\u20112/TIMP\u20112 protein ratio was significantly decreased in rats treated with urantide compared with AS rats with no urantide treatment. Constituents of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and collagen type\u00a0I/III were found to be localized in the diseased tissue and blood vessels of the hearts of rats with AS. In conclusion, urantide was able to effectively block the UII/GPR14 system by regulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and collagen metabolism. Inhibition of the UII/GPR14 system may prevent and potentially treat atherosclerotic myocardial fibrosis. Based on the current results, it was hypothesized that collagen metabolism may be associated with the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2020-02-06", "authors": ["TuWang", "XiaoxuSun", "HaipengCui", "KaiLiu", "JuanZhao"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2020.10934\n10.3390/ijms160510986\n10.1152/ajpregu.00706.2009\n10.1016/j.peptides.2007.08.014\n10.3109/08977194.2012.660936\n10.1016/j.intimp.2017.05.002\n10.1111/acer.12239\n10.1016/j.jep.2017.06.020\n10.17305/bjbms.2013.2369\n10.3892/etm.2014.1654\n10.1016/j.lfs.2004.04.054\n10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00106.x\n10.1016/j.jcma.2017.08.018\n10.1016/0735-1097(88)90414-7\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.01.011\n10.1089/dna.2017.4070\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.10.002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00335.2010\n10.1161/hy1101.098549\n10.1371/journal.pone.0146094\n10.3892/etm.2013.1052\n10.1016/j.aanat.2017.07.003\n10.1093/molehr/gav039\n10.1007/s13105-013-0235-x\n10.1074/jbc.M307238200\n10.1093/ehjci/jey140\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.10.044\n10.1002/jcb.26179"}
{"title": "Cardiomyocyte maturation: advances in knowledge and implications for regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "Our knowledge of pluripotent stem cell (PSC) biology has advanced to the point where we now can generate most cells of the human body in the laboratory. PSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be generated routinely with high yield and purity for disease research and drug development, and these cells are now gradually entering the clinical research phase for the testing of heart regeneration therapies. However, a major hurdle for their applications is the immature state of these cardiomyocytes. In this Review, we describe the structural and functional properties of cardiomyocytes and present the current approaches to mature PSC-derived cardiomyocytes. To date, the greatest success in maturation of PSC-derived cardiomyocytes has been with transplantation into the heart in animal models and the engineering of 3D heart tissues with\u00a0electromechanical conditioning. In conventional 2D cell culture, biophysical stimuli such as mechanical loading, electrical stimulation and nanotopology cues all induce substantial maturation, particularly of the contractile cytoskeleton. Metabolism has emerged as a potent means to control maturation with unexpected effects on electrical and mechanical function. Different interventions induce distinct facets of maturation, suggesting that activating multiple signalling networks might lead to increased maturation. Despite considerable progress, we are still far from being able to generate PSC-derived cardiomyocytes with adult-like phenotypes in vitro. Future progress will come from identifying the developmental drivers of maturation and leveraging them to create more mature cardiomyocytes for research and regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

In this study we have identified two genes encoding putative GHR and PRLR in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum), extant members of one of the oldest vertebrate groups, agnathans. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that lamprey GHR and PRLR cluster at the base of gnathostome GHR and PRLR clades, respectively. This indicates that distinct GHR and PRLR arose prior to the emergence of the lamprey branch of agnathans. In the sea lamprey, GHR and PRLR displayed a differential but overlapping pattern of expression; GHR had high expression in liver and heart tissues, whereas PRLR was expressed highly in the brain and moderately in osmoregulatory tissues. Branchial PRLR mRNA levels were significantly elevated by stage 5 of metamorphosis and remained elevated through stage 7, whereas levels of GHR mRNA were only elevated in the final stage (7). Branchial expression of GHR increased following seawater (SW) exposure of juveniles, but expression of PRLR was not significantly altered.

Dilbit exposure is known to cause adverse effects in fish, but linking molecular and cellular changes with ecologically-relevant individual performance metrics is needed to better understand the potential consequences of a dilbit spill into the aquatic environment. Therefore, this study examined the effects of dilbit exposure on subcellular responses in cardiac and skeletal muscle in relation to swimming performance in a migratory fish species at risk of exposure, Atlantic salmon. Smolts were exposed subchronically to environmentally relevant concentrations of the water-soluble fraction of dilbit (WSFd) for 24 d, and then a subset of exposed fish underwent a depuration period of 7 or 14 d, for a total of 3 experimental time points. At each time point, repeat swimming performance was assessed using sequential critical swimming speed tests (U", "journal": "Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "date": "2020-02-02", "authors": ["Sean RAvey", "Christopher JKennedy", "Anthony PFarrell", "Todd EGillis", "Sarah LAlderman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105423"}

{"title": "Tebuconazole induced cardiotoxicity in male adult rat.", "abstract": "Tebuconazole is an effective systemic fungicide that belongs to the triazoles family. It has been widely used in both agricultural and medical sectors for the control of fungal diseases. Although TEB poses serious threats to mammals health, studies regarding its cardiotoxicity are very limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of TEB on some biochemical parameters, the induction of apoptosis and DNA damage in the heart tissue. Male Wistar rats were treated with TEB at varied oral doses for 28 consecutive days. This study demonstrates that TEB decreased cardiac acetylcholinesterase, increased serum marker enzymes such as creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and altered the lipid profile by increasing serum levels of total cholesterol (T-CHOL), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Furthermore, TEB increased levels of p53 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio, released the cytochrome c into the cytosol and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3. Besides, our results showed that TEB induced genotoxic effects. TEB induced DNA fragmentation and increased the frequency of micronucleated bone marrow cells. Moreover, TEB treatment developed fibrosis in the myocardium. Our results suggest that TEB exposure may affect myocardial cells normal functioning and triggers apoptosis.", "journal": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "date": "2020-02-02", "authors": ["YosraBen Othm\u00e8ne", "HibaHamdi", "EmnaAnnabi", "InesAmara", "IntidharBen Salem", "FadwaNeffati", "Mohamed FadhelNajjar", "SalwaAbid-Essefi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fct.2020.111134"}
{"title": "Systematic Comparison of High-throughput Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus Transcriptomes during Cardiomyocyte Differentiation.", "abstract": "A comprehensive reference map of all cell types in the human body is necessary for improving our understanding of fundamental biological processes and in diagnosing and treating disease. High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing techniques have emerged as powerful tools to identify and characterize cell types in complex and heterogeneous tissues. However, extracting intact cells from tissues and organs is often technically challenging or impossible, for example in heart or brain tissue. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing provides an alternative way to obtain transcriptome profiles of such tissues. To systematically assess the differences between high-throughput single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq approaches, we compared Drop-seq and DroNc-seq, two microfluidic-based 3' RNA capture technologies that profile total cellular and nuclear RNA, respectively, during a time course experiment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiating into cardiomyocytes. Clustering of time-series transcriptomes from Drop-seq and DroNc-seq revealed six distinct cell types, five of which were found in both techniques. Furthermore, single-cell trajectories reconstructed from both techniques reproduced expected differentiation dynamics. We then applied DroNc-seq to postmortem heart tissue to test its performance on heterogeneous human tissue samples. Our data confirm that DroNc-seq yields similar results to Drop-seq on matched samples and can be successfully used to generate reference maps for the human cell atlas.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-02-01", "authors": ["AlanSelewa", "RyanDohn", "HeatherEckart", "StephanieLozano", "BingqingXie", "EricGauchat", "ReemElorbany", "KatherineRhodes", "JonathanBurnett", "YoavGilad", "SebastianPott", "AninditaBasu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-58327-6\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002\n10.1038/nmeth.4407\n10.1038/nbt.4096\n10.1038/nbt.3569\n10.1101/gr.209601.116"}

Its pathogenesis is complex and poorly understood. Whole exome sequencing of Danish families with AF revealed a novel four nucleotide deletion c.1041_1044del in CLCN2 shared by affected individuals. We aimed to investigate the role of genetic variation of CLCN2 encoding the inwardly rectifying chloride channel ClC-2 as a risk factor for the development of familiar AF. The effect of the CLCN2 variant was evaluated by electrophysiological recordings on transiently transfected cells. We used quantitative PCR to assess CLCN2 mRNA expression levels in human atrial and ventricular tissue samples. The nucleotide deletion CLCN2 c.1041_1044del results in a frame-shift and premature stop codon. The truncated ClC-2 p.V347fs channel does not conduct current. Co-expression with wild-type ClC-2, imitating the heterozygote state of the patients, resulted in a 50% reduction in macroscopic current, suggesting an inability of truncated ClC-2 protein to form channel complexes with wild type channel subunits. Quantitative PCR experiments using human heart tissue from healthy donors demonstrated that CLCN2 is expressed across all four heart chambers.

{"title": "The Relationship Between Metabolic Syndrome Development and Tissue Trace Elements Status and Inflammatory Markers.", "abstract": "Insulin resistance, impaired glucose regulation, dyslipidemia, low-grade inflammation, and elevated blood pressure are main components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Trace elements, especially zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) and cytokines, have physiological importance due to their presence in inflammatory processes and glucose metabolism. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between cytokine responses and trace elements in different tissues of sucrose-induced MetS rats compared with healthy controls (n:7/groups). Tissue Zn concentrations are found to be decreased in the liver (p\u2009=\u20090.00) and pancreas (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and increased in the kidney (p\u2009=\u20090.00) and heart tissues (p\u2009<\u20090.001) of MetS group. Serum Zn levels were also found to be decreased in MetS compared with control group (p\u2009<\u20090.01), while there was any significant difference in serum Cu concentrations between groups. The Cu concentration (p\u2009<\u20090.01) was found decreased, and Zn/Cu ratio (p\u2009<\u20090.01) was found increased in kidney tissues. TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 levels were found increased in MetS tissues. With this study, the Zn and Cu concentrations and their relationships with inflammatory response in different tissues in MetS are reported for the first time in the literature.

{"title": "Altering Sphingolipid Metabolism Attenuates Cell Death and Inflammatory Response After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Sphingolipids have recently emerged as a biomarker of recurrence and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). The increased ceramide levels in mammalian heart tissues during acute MI, as demonstrated by several groups, is associated with higher cell death rates in the left ventricle and deteriorated cardiac function. Ceramidase, the only enzyme known to hydrolyze proapoptotic ceramide, generates sphingosine, which is then phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to produce the prosurvival molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate. We hypothesized that Acid Ceramidase (AC) overexpression would counteract the negative effects of elevated ceramide and promote cell survival, thereby providing cardioprotection after MI.\nWe performed transcriptomic, sphingolipid, and protein analyses to evaluate sphingolipid metabolism and signaling post-MI. We investigated the effect of altering ceramide metabolism through a loss (chemical inhibitors) or gain (modified mRNA [modRNA]) of AC function post hypoxia or MI.\nWe found that several genes involved in de novo ceramide synthesis were upregulated and that ceramide (C16, C20, C20:1, and C24) levels had significantly increased 24 hours after MI. AC inhibition after hypoxia or MI resulted in reduced AC activity and increased cell death. By contrast, enhancing AC activity via AC modRNA treatment increased cell survival after hypoxia or MI. AC modRNA-treated mice had significantly better heart function, longer survival, and smaller scar size than control mice 28 days post-MI. We attributed the improvement in heart function post-MI after AC modRNA delivery to decreased ceramide levels, lower cell death rates, and changes in the composition of the immune cell population in the left ventricle manifested by lowered abundance of proinflammatory detrimental neutrophils.\nOur findings suggest that transiently altering sphingolipid metabolism through AC overexpression is sufficient and necessary to induce cardioprotection post-MI, thereby highlighting the therapeutic potential of AC modRNA in ischemic heart disease.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2020-01-30", "authors": ["YoavHadas", "Adam SVincek", "EliasYoussef", "Magdalena M\u017bak", "ElenaChepurko", "NishatSultana", "Mohammad Tofael KabirSharkar", "NingningGuo", "RinatKomargodski", "Ann AnuKurian", "KeeratKaur", "AjitMagadum", "AnthonyFargnoli", "Michael GKatz", "NadiaHossain", "EphraimKenigsberg", "Nicole CDubois", "EricSchadt", "RogerHajjar", "EfratEliyahu", "LiorZangi"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041882"}

In this article we present equations for modelling cellular excitation (i.e. the cell action potential) from both a phenomenological and a biophysical perspective. Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is discussed, along with the current generation of biophysically-detailed cardiac cell models. Alternative Markovian formulations for modelling ionic currents are also presented. Equations describing propagation of this cellular excitation, through one-, two- and three-dimensional idealised or realistic tissues, are then presented. For all types of model, from cell to tissue, methods for discretisation and integration of the underlying equations are discussed.

Vascularization remains a key challenge in the field of tissue engineering, one that can be mitigated by developing platforms conducive to guiding dynamic cell-matrix interactions required for new vessel formation. In this review, we highlight nuanced processes of angiogenesis and demonstrate how materials engineering is being used to interface with dynamic type I collagen remodeling, Notch and VEGF signaling, cell migration, and tissue morphogenesis. Because \u03b11(I)-collagen is secreted by endothelial tip cells during sprouting angiogenesis and required for migration, collagen is a very useful natural biomaterial and its angiogenic modifications are described. The balance between collagen types I and IV via secretion and degradation is tightly controlled by proteinases and other cell types that are capable of internalizing collagen to maintain tissue integrity. Thus, we provide examples in skin and cardiac tissue engineering of collagen tailoring in diverse cellular microenvironments for tissue regeneration. As our understanding of how to drive collagen remodeling and cellular phenotype through angiogenic pathways grows, our capabilities to model and manipulate material systems must continue to expand to develop novel applications for wound healing, angiogenic therapy, and regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Previously, extensive studies have demonstrated that cardiac fibrosis plays cardinal roles in the pathogenesis of CVDs. However, due to the unclear underlying mechanisms of cardiac fibrosis, its clinical intervention remains very lacking. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of non-coding RNA but differing from microRNAs, are generally considered as transcripts with a length ranging 200 to 100 nucleotides. Recently, accumulating evidence showed that lncRNAs involve in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis. Fendrr (FOXF1 adjacent non-coding developmental regulatory RNA), is a spliced long non-coding RNA transcribed bi-directionally with FOXF1 on the opposite strand. Fendrr has been demonstrated to be essential for normal development of the heart and body wall in mouse, and shows a good anti-fibrotic activity in pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of Fendrr on cardiac fibrosis. Intriguingly, we first observed that lncRNA Fendrr was up-regulated in the heart tissues of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced cardiac fibrosis mouse models, determined by RT-QPCR. Loss-function of Fendrr significantly alleviated the cardiac fibrosis phenotypes induced by TAC, indicating that Fendrr is required for the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis. In mechanism, we demonstrated experimentally that Fendrr directly targeting miR-106b, by which the lncRNA promotes cardiac fibrosis (indicated by the elevation of Col1a1, Col3a1, CTGF and ACTA2 expression) in a miR-106b mediated manner. Collectively, our findings highlight the axis of Fendrr/miR-106b/Samd3 in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis, which may be a promising target for clinical intervention target of cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2020-01-27", "authors": ["LiGong", "LingyanZhu", "TianlunYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.01.062"}

The mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL-6 and IL-10), and the protein expression of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were quantified by Western blot analysis. Subsequently, Neophytadiene (12, 25, 50\u00a0mg/kg b.wt/p.o) was pre-treated for 7\u00a0days to the experimental animals followed by LPS (10\u00a0mg/kg) injection interaperitonially.

Further, the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, NF-\u03baB, iNOS, PI3k/Akt and MAPK in the heart tissue was modulated by Neophytadiene significantly confirming the anti-inflammatory potential.

We applied this workflow to study heart metabolism by first comparing two different methods of heart removal: the Langendorff heart method (reverse aortic perfusion) and ", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2020-01-26", "authors": ["Douglas AAndres", "Lyndsay E AYoung", "SudhakarVeeranki", "Tara RHawkinson", "Bryana MLevitan", "DahengHe", "ChiWang", "JonathanSatin", "Ramon CSun"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.RA119.011081\n10.1042/bj2800561\n10.1113/jphysiol.2008.154732\n10.1016/S0022-2828(84)80015-2\n10.1152/ajpheart.00278.2006\n10.1161/01.CIR.85.4.1364\n10.1038/1891018a0\n10.1016/S0163-7827(02)00065-6\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.067\n10.1161/01.RES.45.5.629\n10.1016/j.jchromb.2008.04.031\n10.1021/ac802689c\n10.1021/ac9019522\n10.1002/0471142727.mb3004s114\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.569137\n10.1038/nrm.2016.25\n10.1002/mas.20038\n10.1007/s10545-015-9843-7\n10.1016/j.ab.2007.01.028\n10.1200/JCO.2006.09.7550\n10.1007/s11306-007-0063-5\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1004801\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148361\n10.5936/csbj.201301006\n10.1007/s11306-014-0742-y\n10.1101/645556\n10.1038/s41467-017-01518-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0127259\n10.1021/ac401559v\n10.1016/j.foodres.2012.12.025\n10.1016/0076-6879(63)06257-1\n10.1093/nar/gkv468\n10.1101/645556\n10.1016/j.cmet.2019.07.002\n10.3390/metabo7010001\n10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.08.040\n10.1113/jphysiol.1985.sp015640\n10.1055/s-2007-1013981\n10.1097/00000542-197909000-00005\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.1990.tb04948.x\n10.1093/ajcp/82.4.411\n10.1074/jbc.R200006200\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0504\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300376\n10.1016/S0002-9149(97)00452-9\n10.1159/000240894\n10.1128/MCB.24.16.7179-7187.2004\n10.1161/01.RES.27.5.835\n10.1016/S0022-5223(19)36831-X\n10.1152/jappl.1999.87.1.203\n10.1002/ar.1091470209\n10.1016/0020-711X(90)90288-E\n10.1007/s11306-011-0293-4\n10.1007/s11306-006-0043-1\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.03.007\n10.1126/science.1223066\n10.1039/C1MB05350G\n10.1002/elps.200800512\n10.1016/0022-2828(89)91492-2\n10.1016/0002-9343(64)90065-8\n10.1161/01.RES.19.6.1050\n10.1016/0022-2828(89)90687-1\n10.1016/0006-291X(91)91476-S\n10.1074/jbc.275.19.14466\n10.2337/diab.29.8.617\n10.1016/0304-4165(78)90073-9\n10.1016/j.cmet.2019.08.014\n10.1038/81137"}

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the fructose-rich diet and chronic stress, separately and in combination, on insulin signaling and molecules regulating glycogen synthesis and ion transport in the heart, and to reveal whether these effects coincide with changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 10% fructose in drinking water and/or to chronic unpredictable stress for 9 weeks. Protein expression and/or phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) and Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b1-subunits in cardiac tissue were analyzed by western blot. GR distribution between cytosolic and nuclear fractions was also analyzed. The fructose-rich diet decreased the level of pERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and pGSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9) independently of stress, while chronic stress increased the IRS1 content and prevented the fructose diet-induced decrease of the pAkt (Ser473) level. The fructose-rich diet in combination with chronic stress reduced the protein content of cardiac IR and attenuated IRS1 upregulation. Separate treatments increased the protein content of Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11- and \u03b12-subunits, while after combined treatment the \u03b12 content was at the control level and the \u03b11 content was lower than the control level. The effect of combined treatment on cardiac IR and \u03b12-subunit expression could be mediated by increased GR nuclear accumulation. Our study provides new insights into the effects of chronic stress and a combination of the fructose diet and chronic stress on the studied molecules in the heart.", "journal": "Food & function", "date": "2020-01-25", "authors": ["SnjezanaRomic", "AnaDjordjevic", "SnezanaTepavcevic", "TijanaCulafic", "MojcaStojiljkovic", "BiljanaBursac", "JelenaStanisic", "MilanKostic", "LjupkaGligorovska", "GoranKoricanac"], "doi": "10.1039/c9fo02306b"}

We have recently demonstrated that a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-enriched mixture (BCAAem), supplemented with drinking water to middle-aged mice, was able to promote mitochondrial biogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. To maximally favor and increase oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function, here we tested a new original formula, composed of essential amino acids, tricarboxylic acid cycle precursors and co-factors (named 5), in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and mice treated with DOX. We measured mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative stress, and BCAA catabolic pathway. Moreover, the molecular relevance of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was studied in both cardiac tissue and HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Finally, the role of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), a critical transcriptional regulator of BCAA oxidation and eNOS-mTORC1 signal, was investigated. Our results demonstrate that the 5 mixture prevents the DOX-dependent mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress better than the previous BCAAem, implying a KLF15/eNOS/mTORC1 signaling axis.

{"title": "Dexamethasone-Induced Perturbations in Tissue Metabolomics Revealed by Chemical Isotope Labeling LC-MS analysis.", "abstract": "Dexamethasone (Dex) is a synthetic glucocorticoid (GC) drug commonly used clinically for the treatment of several inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Despite its broad range of indications, the long-term use of Dex is known to be associated with specific abnormalities in several tissues and organs. In this study, the metabolomic effects on five different organs induced by the chronic administration of Dex in the Sprague-Dawley rat model were investigated using the chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (CIL LC-MS) platform, which targets the amine/phenol submetabolomes. Compared to controls, a prolonged intake of Dex resulted in significant perturbations in the levels of 492, 442, 300, 186, and 105 metabolites in the brain, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and heart tissues, respectively. The positively identified metabolites were mapped to diverse molecular pathways in different organs. In the brain, perturbations in protein biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, and monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis were identified, while in the heart, pyrimidine metabolism and branched amino acid biosynthesis were the most significantly impaired pathways. In the kidney, several amino acid pathways were dysregulated, which reflected impairments in several biological functions, including gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis. Beta-alanine metabolism and uridine homeostasis were profoundly affected in liver tissues, whereas alterations of glutathione, arginine, glutamine, and nitrogen metabolism pointed to the modulation of muscle metabolism and disturbances in energy production and muscle mass in skeletal muscle.

{"title": "Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and associated histologic findings in domestic cats (Felis catus).", "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a zoonotic protozoan parasite transmitted by triatomines that infects a wide range of mammals. South Texas is a hotspot for triatomines, T. cruzi-infected dogs and wildlife, and local transmission to humans also occurs. However, little is known about the infection of domestic cats (Felis catus) in the United States. Given the role cats play in the ecology of T. cruzi in Mexico and South America, we hypothesized that T. cruzi infection occurs in cats from south Texas, sometimes associated with cardiac pathology. In 2017, 167 euthanized cats from a south Texas shelter were sampled across winter, spring, and summer. We collected whole blood and hearts from all cats, with additional tissues from a subset. Serum samples were screened for T. cruzi antibodies using two independent rapid immunochromatographic tests and an indirect fluorescent antibody test. Cats were considered seropositive if they were positive on at least two independent serological tests. Blood clot, heart tissue and other tissues were subjected to qPCR for parasite detection and discrete typing unit (DTU) determination. Tissues from selected seropositive or PCR-positive animals and a subset of negative animals were processed routinely for histopathology and examined by a board-certified pathologist. A total of 19 cats (11.4%) were seropositive and three cats (1.8%) - one of which was seropositive - had one or more PCR-positive tissues. Infected tissues included heart, bicep femoris muscle, sciatic nerve, esophagus, and mesentery. Genotyping of the parastite to the level of DTU showed that exclusively DTU TcI was present, despite past studies showing both TcI and TcIV in vectors of the region. Eight of 19 (42.1%) seropositive cats exhibited lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, sometimes with fibrosis, in cardiac tissue compared to 28.6% of 28 seronegative cats (P = 0.10). Domestic cats are affected hosts in the eco-epidemiology of Chagas disease. Future prospective studies are needed to understand disease progression.

However, despite mounting evidence that glycan structures are key modulators of heart function and must be considered when developing cardiac biomarkers, we currently do not have a comprehensive view of the glycans present in the normal human heart. In the current study, we used porous graphitized carbon liquid chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry (PGC-LC-MS) to generate glycan structure libraries for primary human heart tissue homogenate, cardiomyocytes (CM) enriched from human heart tissue, and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived CM (hiPSC-CM). Altogether, we established the first reference structure libraries of the cardiac glycome containing 265\u00a0N- and O-glycans. Comparing the N-glycome of CM enriched from primary heart tissue to that of heart tissue homogenate, the same pool of N-glycan structures was detected in each sample type but the relative signal of 21 structures significantly differed between samples, with the high mannose class increased in enriched CM. Moreover, by comparing primary CM to hiPSC-CM collected during 20-100\u00a0days of differentiation, dynamic changes in the glycan profile throughout in vitro differentiation were observed and differences between primary and hiPSC-CM were revealed. Namely, >30% of the N-glycome significantly changed across these time-points of differentiation and only 23% of the N-glycan structures were shared between hiPSC-CM and primary CM. These observations are an important complement to current genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling and reveal new considerations for the use and interpretation of hiPSC-CM models for studies of human development, disease, and drug testing. Finally, these data are expected to support future regenerative medicine efforts by informing targets for evaluating the immunogenic potential of hiPSC-CM and harnessing differences between immature, proliferative hiPSC-CM and adult primary CM.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2020-01-24", "authors": ["ChristopherAshwood", "MatthewWaas", "RanjunaWeerasekera", "Rebekah LGundry"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.12.012\n10.1002/stem.2403\n10.1177/002215540205001008\n10.1002/cncr.27633.Percutaneous\n10.1007/s10719-015-9641-3\n10.1074/jbc.M111.235168\n10.1085/jgp.200509423\n10.1016/j.matbio.2019.05.001\n10.1007/s10545-017-0066-y\n10.1074/jbc.RA119.008102\n10.1373/clinchem.2019.302547\n10.1373/clinchem.2016.265397\n10.1136/heartjnl-2011-300102\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016423\n10.1126/scisignal.1302002pe19\n10.1242/dev.048926\n10.1002/ajpa.10018\n10.1126/science.1078942.Production\n10.1093/nar/gkt1128\n10.1038/nprot.2012.063\n10.1021/bi00135a024\n10.3791/52010\n10.1101/388926\n10.1016/0304-3959(86)90228-9\n10.1039/C9AN00486F\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btn323\n10.1002/1615-9861(200102)1:2&lt;340::AID-PROT340&gt;3.0.CO;2-B\n10.1074/mcp.RA118.000799\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btq054\n10.1021/pr7008252\n10.1007/s13361-018-1932-z\n10.1007/s13361-013-0610-4\n10.1021/pr500898r\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.07.028\n10.1093/glycob/cww082\n10.1074/mcp.O112.026492\n10.1038/s41467-019-11131-x\n10.1074/mcp.RA117.000543\n10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05720\n10.1074/mcp.M116.066746\n10.1007/s10719-015-9625-3\n10.1002/pmic.201000517\n10.1007/s00216-013-7128-2\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00404\n10.1002/stem.615\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010617-053110\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00007\n10.1002/stem.2649\n10.1002/stem.1331\n10.1165/rcmb.2009-0241OC\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.049\n10.1046/j.1537-2995.1998.381098440863.x\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu314\n10.1074/mcp.ra117.000454\n10.1002/stem.788\n10.1002/sctm.16-0151\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.08.008\n10.1253/circj.CJ-12-0987\n10.1242/dev.123810\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.006\n10.1002/pmic.201800284\n10.1002/cbic.201700100\n10.1038/s41467-018-07333-4\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.05.001\n10.1177/1536867\u00d70500500206\n10.1007/10\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1124/jpet.114.218370\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.224428\n10.1161/hq0302.105378\n10.1093/cvr/cvn225\n10.1093/glycob/cwj019\n10.1074/mcp.M800504-MCP200\n10.1021/pr0502065\n10.1172/JCI86924\n10.1126/science.1249098.Sleep\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.032\n10.1016/j.scr.2007.06.001\n10.1038/nature14582\n10.1007/s00109-003-0456-5\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0419"}
{"title": "The Noncoding Side of Cardiac Differentiation and Regeneration.", "abstract": "Large scale projects such as FANTOM and ENCODE led to a revolution in our comprehension of the mammalian transcriptomes by revealing that ~53% of the produced RNAs do not encode for proteins. These transcripts, defined as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), constitute a heterogeneous group of molecules which can be categorized in two main classes, namely small and long, according to their length. In animals, the first-class includes Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Among them, the best-characterized subgroup is represented by miRNAs, which are known to regulate gene expression largely at the post-transcriptional level. In contrast, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a more heterogeneous group of > 200 nucleotides long transcripts, that act through a variety of mechanisms at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Here, we discuss how miRNAs and lncRNAs are emerging as pivotal regulators of cardiac muscle development and how the alteration of ncRNA expression was seen to disturb the physiology of all the different cell types forming the cardiac tissue. Particular emphasis is given to those species that are expressed and are known to regulate the capacity of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), currently used in regenerative medicine protocols, to proliferate and differentiate.

We aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of GS extract against DX-induced cardiotoxicity.\nA\u00a0total of 28\u00a0male Sprague Dawley rats were grouped to receive: (a) standard nutrition (n\u202f=\u20097); (b) standard nutrition with an additional dose of 10\u202fmg/kg DX (n\u202f=\u20097); (c) standard nutrition plus 100\u202fmg/kg/day of GS (n\u202f=\u20097); (d) standard nutrition with 100\u202fmg/kg/day of GS plus a single dose of 10\u202fmg/kg DX. After 35\u00a0days the rats were decapitated and blood samples were taken for biochemical testing. Cardiac tissue samples were prepared for microscopy and histopathological evaluation.\nRats in the DX group exhibited significant elevations in biomarkers such as troponin and NT-proBNP as well as in oxidative stress markers compared with all other groups. Histopathological examination corroborated these findings by demonstrating significant and severe structural injury in the cardiac tissue of DX rates. Moreover, rats in the DX\u202f+\u2009GS group had significantly lower cardiac injury than rats in the DX group according to both biochemical (troponin and NT-proBNP) and histopathological analyses. Serum malondialdehyde levels (a marker of oxidative stress) in the DX\u202f+\u2009GS rats were significantly lower than in the DX rats.\nOur findings suggest that GS may reduce the severity of DX-induced cardiotoxicity and thus has the potential to prevent cardiac injury in this setting.\nHINTERGRUND: Doxorubicin (DX) wird zur Behandlung vieler Arten von Tumoren eingesetzt, eine seiner Nebenwirkungen ist allerdings die Kardiotoxizit\u00e4t, die zu Kardiomyopathie oder Herzinsuffizienz f\u00fchren kann.

{"title": "Agonist Antibody Converts Stem Cells into Migrating Brown Adipocyte-Like Cells in Heart.", "abstract": "We present data showing that Iodotyrosine Deiodinase (IYD) is a dual-function enzyme acting as a catalyst in metabolism and a receptor for cooperative stem cell differentiation. IYD is present both in thyroid cells where it is critical for scavenging iodine from halogenated by-products of thyroid hormone production and on hematopoietic stem cells. To close the cooperative loop, the mono- and di-Iodotyrosine (MIT and DIT) substrates of IYD in the thyroid are also agonists for IYD now acting as a receptor on bone marrow stem cells. While studying intracellular combinatorial antibody libraries, we discovered an agonist antibody, H3 Ab, of which the target is the enzyme IYD.

In our previous studies, thioredoxin1 (Trx1) activity was shown to be decreased in diabetic cardiac tissues, but the reason of Trx1 inactivation and whether it mediates the impaired angiogenesis in ischemic myocardium is still to be identified. As thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an endogenous inhibitor of Trx, is overexpressed in DM due to carbohydrate response element within its promoter, we hypothesized that inhibition of Trx1 by enhanced TXNIP expression in endothelial cells may play a role in hyperglycemia-induced impairment of angiogenesis. In the present study, we found that high glucose-mediated increase of TXNIP expression and TXNIP-Trx1 interaction induced the impairment in endothelial cell function and survival, since these detrimental effects are rescued by silencing TXNIP with small interfering RNA. In diabetic mice, TXNIP knockdown or recombinant human Trx1 treatment counteracted the impairment of angiogenesis, alleviated myocardial ischemic injury, and improved survival rate. All these data implicate that TXNIP upregulation and subsequently the increased formation of TXNIP-Trx1 complex is a novel pathologic pathway by which DM induces insufficient angiogenesis and thereby exacerbates myocardial ischemia injury.", "journal": "Journal of vascular research", "date": "2020-01-23", "authors": ["RongrongHou", "MingzhiShen", "RutaoWang", "HaitaoLiu", "ChaoGao", "JingXu", "LingTao", "ZhiyongYin", "TaoYin"], "doi": "10.1159/000505455"}

{"title": "Anisotropic conduction in the myocardium due to fibrosis: the effect of texture on wave propagation.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in many forms of heart disease. It is well established that the spatial pattern of fibrosis, its texture, substantially affects the onset of arrhythmia. However, in most modelling studies fibrosis is represented by multiple randomly distributed short obstacles that mimic only one possible texture, diffuse fibrosis. An important characteristic feature of other fibrosis textures, such as interstitial and patchy textures, is that fibrotic inclusions have substantial length, which is suggested to have a pronounced effect on wave propagation. In this paper, we study the effect of the elongation of inexcitable inclusions (obstacles) on wave propagation in a 2D model of cardiac tissue described by the TP06 model for human ventricular cells. We study in detail how the elongation of obstacles affects various characteristics of the waves. We quantify the anisotropy induced by the textures, its dependency on the obstacle length and the effects of the texture on the shape of the propagating wave. Because such anisotropy is a result of zig-zag propagation we show, for the first time, quantification of the effects of geometry and source-sink relationship, on the zig-zag nature of the pathway of electrical conduction. We also study the effect of fibrosis in the case of pre-existing anisotropy and introduce a procedure for scaling of the fibrosis texture. We show that fibrosis can decrease or increase the preexisting anisotropy depending on its scaled texture.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-01-23", "authors": ["TNezlobinsky", "OSolovyova", "A VPanfilov"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-57449-1\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.08.020\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.12.024\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318207a35f\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.10.033\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.915\n10.1137/030602654\n10.1093/europace/eum206\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.255026\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.03.019\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.026\n10.1006/jtbi.1993.1055\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1006/jtbi.1993.1055\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166972\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.158101\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.018\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.108101\n10.1103/PhysRevE.88.012908\n10.1073/pnas.1008837107\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2292320\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306565\n10.1152/ajpheart.00484.2008\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy168\n10.1152/ajpheart.00906.2007\n10.1152/ajpheart.00952.2008\n10.1093/europace/eum203\n10.1038/s41598-017-07653-3\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006597\n10.1529/biophysj.108.136473\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.09.019"}

{"title": "Differential gene responses 3 days following infarction in the fetal and adolescent sheep heart.", "abstract": "There are critical molecular mechanisms that can be activated to induce myocardial repair, and in humans this is most efficient during fetal development. The timing of heart development in relation to birth and the size/electrophysiology of the heart are similar in humans and sheep, providing a model to investigate the repair capacity of the mammalian heart and how this can be applied to adult heart repair. Myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in fetal (105 days gestation when cardiomyocytes are proliferative) and adolescent sheep (6 mo of age when all cardiomyocytes have switched to an adult phenotype). An ovine gene microarray was used to compare gene expression in sham and infarcted (remote, border and infarct areas) cardiac tissue from fetal and adolescent hearts. The gene response to myocardial infarction was less pronounced in fetal compared with adolescent sheep hearts and there were unique gene responses at each age. There were also region-specific changes in gene expression between each age, in the infarct tissue, tissue bordering the infarct, and tissue remote from the infarction. In total, there were 880 genes that responded to MI uniquely in the adolescent samples compared with 170 genes in the fetal response, as well as 742 overlap genes that showed concordant direction of change responses to infarction at both ages. In response to myocardial infarction, there were specific changes in genes within pathways of mitochondrial oxidation, muscle contraction, and hematopoietic cell lineages, suggesting that the control of energy utilization and immune function are critical for effective heart repair.

{"title": "A conductive cell-delivery construct as a bioengineered patch that can improve electrical propagation and synchronize cardiomyocyte contraction for heart repair.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering is of particular importance in the combination of contracting cells with a biomaterial scaffold, which serves as a cell-delivery construct, to replace cardiomyocytes (CMs) that are lost as a result of an infarction, to restore heart function. However, most biomaterial scaffolds are nonconductive and may delay regional conduction, potentially causing arrhythmias. In this study, a conductive CM-delivery construct that consists of a gelatin-based gelfoam that is conjugated with a self-doped conductive polymer (poly-3-amino-4-methoxybenzoic acid, PAMB) is proposed as a cardiac patch (PAMB-Gel patch) to repair an infarcted heart. A nonconductive plain gelfoam (Gel patch) is used as a control. The electrical conductivity of the PAMB-Gel patch is approximately 30 times higher than that of the Gel patch; as a result, the conductive PAMB-Gel patch can substantially increase electrical conduction between distinct clusters of beating CMs, facilitating their synchronous contraction. In vivo epicardial implantation of the PAMB-Gel patch that is seeded with CMs (the bioengineered patch) in infarcted rat hearts can significantly enhance electrical activity in the fibrotic tissue, improving electrical impulse propagation and synchronizing CM contraction across the scar region, markedly reducing its susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. Echocardiography shows that the bioengineered conductive patch has an important role in the restoration of cardiac function, perhaps owing to the synergistic effects of its conductive construct and the synchronously beating CMs. These experimental results reveal that the as-proposed bioengineered conductive patch has great potential for repairing injured cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2020-01-21", "authors": ["ShanglinChen", "Meng-HsuanHsieh", "Shu-HongLi", "JunWu", "Richard DWeisel", "YenChang", "Hsing-WenSung", "Ren-KeLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.01.027"}

The serum lipid distribution, oxidative stress, inflammatory factors and adiponectin (APN) in the blood, and heart and aortic tissues were determined using the standard assay kits, xanthine oxidase method, and ELISA, respectively. HE staining was performed to observe aortic pathology structure change, and the level of angiotensin II (AngII) in the aorta was assessed using radioimmunoassay. In addition, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis were applied to detect the expression of iNOS, IL-1\u00df, TNF-alpha, and CRP in the aortic and heart tissues. RESULTS Compared with the AS group, the levels of serum TC, TG, LDL, and VLDL in rats decreased significantly, while HDL level significantly increased in the AS+ALCAR group. ALCAR administration enhanced the SOD and GSH-Px activities and decreased MDA activity. APN level was significantly elevated in the AS group, but ALCAR had no significant effect on APN. Further, ALCAR reduced the expressions of inflammation factors TNF-alpha, IL-1\u00df, iNOS, and CRP, and the concentration of AngII in serum, aortic, and heart tissues.

{"title": "Gracillin inhibits apoptosis and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to alleviate cardiac injury in mice via\u00a0improving miR-29a.", "abstract": "Sepsis induces critical myocardial dysfunction, resulting in an increased mortality. Gracillin (GRA) is a natural steroidal saponin, showing strong capacities of anti-inflammation, but its pharmacological effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute cardiac injury still remain unclear. In this study, we attempted to explore if GRA was effective to attenuate cardiac injury in LPS-challenged mice and the underlying mechanisms. First, we found that GRA treatments markedly up-regulated the expression of miR-29a in cardiomyocytes. LPS-induced cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes was significantly alleviated by GRA treatment, as evidenced by the improved cell viability and reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. In addition, LPS-triggered apoptotic cell death was clearly ameliorated in cardiomyocytes co-treated with GRA. Notably, LPS-exposed cells showed significantly reduced expression of miR-29a, while being rescued by GRA treatment. In\u00a0vivo, LPS apparently impaired cardiac function in mice, which was, however, alleviated by GRA administration. In addition, GRA markedly attenuated apoptosis in hearts of LPS-challenged mice by decreasing the expression of cleaved Caspase-3. LPS-triggered inflammatory response in cardiac tissues was also suppressed by GRA through blocking nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. We also found that miR-29a expression was highly reduced in hearts of LPS-treated mice but was rescued by GRA pretreatment. Besides, miR-29a mimic alleviated LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation in cardiomyocytes; however, LPS-caused effects were further accelerated by miR-29a. Of note, the protective effects of GRA on LPS-injured cardiac tissues were significantly abrogated by miR-29a suppression. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that GRA exerted an effective role against LPS-induced acute cardiac injury through impeding apoptosis and inflammation regulated by miR-29a.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2020-01-17", "authors": ["Yin-XueSong", "Yan-MianOu", "Jing-YuZhou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.11.129"}
{"title": "The aqueous extract of Gentianella acuta improves isoproterenol\u2011induced myocardial fibrosis via inhibition of the TGF\u2011\u03b21/Smads signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Gentianella acuta (G.\u00a0acuta) is one of the most commonly used herbs in Chinese Mongolian medicine for the treatment of heart disease. Previously, it was found that G.\u00a0acuta ameliorated cardiac function and inhibited isoproterenol (ISO)\u2011induced myocardial fibrosis in rats. In this study, the underlying anti\u2011fibrotic mechanism of G.\u00a0acuta was further elucidated. Histopathological changes in the heart were observed by hematoxylin\u2011eosin, Masson trichrome and wheat germ agglutinin staining. Relevant molecular events were investigated using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The results revealed that G.\u00a0acuta caused improvements in myocardial injury and fibrosis. G.\u00a0acuta also inhibited collagens\u00a0I\u00a0and\u00a0III and \u03b1\u2011smooth muscle actin production in heart tissue. G.\u00a0acuta downregulated the expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u2011\u03b21) and notably inhibited the levels of phosphorylation of TGF\u2011\u03b2 receptors\u00a0I and II. Furthermore, G.\u00a0acuta caused downregulation of the intracellular mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smads)2\u00a0and\u00a04 expression and inhibited Smads2\u00a0and\u00a03 phosphorylation. The results further demonstrated that the mechanism underlying anti\u2011myocardial fibrosis effects of G.\u00a0acuta was based upon the suppression of the TGF\u2011\u03b21/Smads signaling pathway.

As a novel biomarker and target of HF, Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP) can exacerbate apoptosis via activation by angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) and subsequently deteriorate heart function. Transcriptome results in our previous study indicated BYD was beneficial to HF post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with a promising effect on CARP. However, the mechanism remains to be validated.\nThis study aims to elucidate whether BYD ameliorates apoptosis to protect against HF via AT1-CARP signaling pathway.\nLeft anterior descending ligation was applied to induce an HF rat model, Ang \u2161-stimulated H9C2 cells apoptotic model and overexpression of Ankrd1/CARP H9C2 cells were established to clarify the effects and potential mechanism of BYD. Ethanol extracts of BYD (0.64; 1.28; 2.57\u00a0g/kg) were orally administered for four weeks and Fosinopril (4.67\u00a0mg/kg) was selected as a positive group in vivo. In vitro, BYD (400, 600, 800\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) or RNH6270 (an inhibitor of AT1, 1\u00a0\u03bcM) was co-cultured with Ang \u2161 stimulation for 48\u00a0h in H9C2 cells. Overexpression of Ankrd1/CARP was conducted by transient transfection with H9C2 cells to further confirm the exact mechanism. Finally, to define the active ingredients of anti-cardiomyocyte apoptosis in BYD, we furtherly used the Ang \u2161-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis model to evaluate the effects.\nEchocardiography and TUNEL results showed that BYD in different doses remarkably improved heart function and inhibited apoptosis in vivo. Further study demonstrated that AT1 and CARP expressions in cardiac tissue were suppressed by BYD, accompanied with upregulation of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and downregulation of several pro-apoptotic molecules, including p53, Bcl-2 Associated X Protein (Bax) and Cleaved caspase 3. In parallel with the vivo experiment, in vitro research indicated BYD dramatically reduced the apoptotic cells and regulated expressions of critical apoptosis-related molecules mediated through downregulation of AT1 and CARP simultaneously which were consistent with the results in vivo experiment. Transiently transfected CARP over-expression further confirmed that BYD could suppress severe cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by overexpression of CARP. Especially, the active ingredients of BYD including Astragaloside IV, Ginsenoside Rg3, Rb1, Rc and Re showed significantly anti-apoptosis effects.\nBYD improves cardiac function and protects against cardiomyocytes injury by inhibiting apoptosis via regulating the AT1-CARP signaling pathway.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2020-01-14", "authors": ["XiaopingWang", "HuiMeng", "QixinWang", "MingyanShao", "WenjiLu", "XuChen", "YongJiang", "ChunLi", "YongWang", "PengfeiTu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2019.112536"}

Here we investigated the potential effects of salvianolic acid B (SalB), one of the abundant and bioactive compounds extracted from Chinese herb Salvia Miltiorrhiza (Danshen), on macrophage-mediated inflammation after MI/R and the underlying mechanisms. In primary cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), SalB attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 biomarkers (IL-6, iNOS, CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1) mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, M2 biomarkers (Arg1, Clec10a and Mrc) mRNA levels following interleukinin-4 (IL-4) stimulation were significantly upregulated by SalB. In addition, LPS stimulation potently induced transcriptional upregulation of RagD, an important activation factor of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Interestingly, SalB inhibited RagD upregulation and mTORC1 activation, decreased glycolysis, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-stimulated macrophages, all of which were blunted in RagD knockdown macrophages. In mice subjected to MI/R, SalB treatment decreased cardiac M1-macrophages and increased M2-macrophages at 3 days post-MI/R, followed by decreased collagen deposition and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction at 7 days post-MI/R.

After two months, the cardiac function was assessed using the adaptive responses to exercise training, or TAC, or both of them such as catheterization and echocardiography. The HE stains assessed the area of myocyte cross-sectional. The Western blot and real-time PCR measured the levels of expression for heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) in cardiac tissues. The anti-CD31 antibody immunohistochemical staining was done to examine how exercise training influenced cardiac ontogeny. The outcome illustrated that exercise training significantly improved the cardiac ontogeny in TAC mice, which was convoyed by elevated levels of expression for VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1 and preserved the heart microvascular density.

Hydrogen sulfide has been found to possess multiple biological activities in previous studies. This study investigated whether hydrogen sulfide conferred cardiac protection against damage in a diabetic rat model by inhibiting nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein (NLRP) 3 inflammasome activation. Male animals were assigned to control, streptozotocin, streptozotocin\u2009+\u2009sodium hydrosulfide, and streptozotocin\u2009+\u2009DL-propargylglycine groups. Animals in the three streptozotocin groups were administrated 55\u2009mg/kg streptozotocin by intraperitoneal injection. Streptozotocin\u2009+\u2009sodium hydrosulfide and streptozotocin\u2009+\u2009propargylglycine groups were treated with sodium hydrosulfide (56\u2009\u03bcmol/kg) and propargylglycine (40\u2009mg/kg), respectively, for four\u2009weeks. Estimation of fasting blood glucose, heart-weight/body-weight, cardiac function, and histopathological analysis, and measurement of myocardial enzymes were done to evaluate the degree of cardiac injury. In order to investigate the redox changes, the levels of total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde and lipid peroxidation, and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were assessed; the protein expression levels of Thioredoxin and Thioredoxin-interacting protein were measured in myocardial tissue. In addition, inflammatory reactions were assessed by measuring the concentration levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and interleukin-18 in serum and the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome complex-associated proteins in cardiac tissue. In the heart, hyperglycemia significantly induced cardiac dysfunction and injury, redox perturbation, and aggravation of inflammatory reactions. However, except for fasting blood glucose, treatment with sodium hydrosulfide significantly ameliorated these alterations, whereas treatment with propargylglycine further aggravated these alterations. This study highlights the protective properties of hydrogen sulfide against hyperglycemia-induced cardiac injury, and its possible mechanism was shown to involve negative regulation of Thioredoxin-interacting protein-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\nDiabetic cardiomyopathy is a serious complication of diabetic patients, accompanied by chronic inflammation.

Here, we sought to understand the effect that excessive shRNAs have on muscle miRNAs by treating mice with recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs) that produce shRNAs with 19-nt or 21-nt stem sequences. Small RNA sequencing of their muscle and liver tissues revealed that shRNA expression was highest in the heart, where mice experienced substantial cardiomyopathy when shRNAs accumulated to 51.2%\u00a0\u00b1 13.7% of total small RNAs. With the same treatment, shRNAs in other muscle tissues reached only 12.1%\u00a0\u00b1 5.0% of total small RNAs. Regardless of treatment, the predominant heart miRNAs remained relatively stable across samples. Instead, the lower-expressed miR-451, one of the few miRNAs processed independently of Dicer, changed in relation to shRNA level and toxicity. Our data suggest that a protective mechanism exists in cardiac tissue for maintaining the levels of most miRNAs in response to shRNA delivery, in contrast with what has been shown in the liver.

In addition, in the I/R group, the glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activities were also higher in the heart tissues than those in other tissues (P < 0.05). However, these results were not significant because the malondialdehyde, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase levels of the heart tissues in the control group were higher than those of the other tissues. Therefore, no statistically significant difference was found between the tissues in terms of the histological damage score we created and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cell numbers.\nThere was no difference in the severity of reperfusion injury between the tissues we examined after lower extremity I/R.

{"title": "Does p-coumaric acid improve cardiac injury following LPS-induced lung inflammation through miRNA-146a activity?", "abstract": "In cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory response plays an important role and affects heart function. As a flavonoid compound, p-coumaric acid (pCA), commonly exists in many fruits and vegetables and has a therapeutic effect on inflammatory diseases due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose of the present study was to investigate pCA anti-inflammatory effect and the miRNAs (miRs) signaling pathway involved in cardiac inflammation following lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury (ALI).\nThirty-two Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into 4 groups: control (received saline for 10 days, i.p.), LPS (received saline for 10 days+5 mg/kg LPS on day 8, intratracheally), pCA (received pCA 100 mg/kg for 10 days, ip), and LPS+pCA (received LPS+pCA). The level of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 in heart tissue and IL-1\u03b2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was determined by ELISA kits. Also the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in heart tissue and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in lung tissue were measured, and pCA effect on miR- 146a in heart tissue was analyzed.\nData showed that 100 mg/kg of pCA significantly suppressed LDH activity (p<0.05), IL-18 (p<0.05) and IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.01) level in heart tissue. Also, in BAL, IL-1\u03b2 and MPO levels were significantly reduced (p<0.001). Finally, pCA modulated activation of miR-146a (p<0.05) in LPS -induced cardiac injury.\nThese findings indicated that LPS causes cardiac dysfunction and pre-treatment with pCA, as an anti-inflammatory agent, improved cardiac inflammation through modulation of miR-146a, and reducing cytokines and LDH activity.", "journal": "Avicenna journal of phytomedicine", "date": "2020-01-11", "authors": ["MaryamKheiry", "MahinDianat", "MohammadBadavi", "Seyyed AliMard", "VahidBayati"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Protective effect of curcumin nanoparticles against cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in rat.", "abstract": "The present study designed to investigate the protective effect of curcumin nanoparticles (CUR-NPs) on the cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin. Rats were divided into four groups; control, rats treated daily with CUR-NPs (50\u00a0mg/kg) for 14\u00a0days, rats treated with an acute dose of doxorubicin (20\u00a0mg/kg) and rats treated daily with CUR-NPs for 14\u00a0days injected with doxorubicin on the 10th day. After electrocardiogram (ECG) recording from rats at different groups, rat decapitation was carried out and the heart of each rat was excised out to measure the oxidative stress parameters; lipid peroxidation (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activities of Na,K,ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AchE). In addition, the levels of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) were determined in the cardiac tissues. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured in the serum. The ECG recordings indicated that daily pretreatment with CUR- NPs has prevented the tachycardia (i.e. increase in heart rate) and ameliorated the changes in ST wave and QRS complex induced by doxorubicin. In addition, CUR-NPs prevented doxorubicin induced significant increase in MDA, NO, DA, AchE and LDH and doxorubicin induced significant decrease in GSH, NE, 5-HT and Na,K,ATPase. According to the present findings, it could be concluded that CUR-NPs have a protective effect against cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin.

{"title": "Isofraxidin Alleviates Myocardial Infarction Through NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibition.", "abstract": "Isofraxidin is a well-known coumarin compound refined from traditional Chinese medicines. It has been previously demonstrated to play an anti-inflammatory role in various inflammatory conditions. However, the effect of isofraxidin on myocardial infarction (MI) remains uncovered. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of isofraxidin on MI. MI mice was created and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining as well as echocardiographic evaluation were conducted to analyze the severity of MI. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was used for the mimics of ischemic stress in murine cardiomyocytes, and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Annexin V, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays were conducted for cell viability. Western blot was used for the detection of NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), and adapter protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) in heart tissues and cardiomyocytes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied for the detection of proinflammatory cytokines. We found that isofraxidin alleviated the severity of MI and produced a cardio-protective effect against OGD damage. Isofraxidin also decreased the overall and local inflammatory reaction in MI. Those effects were through the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, we initially reported the cardio-protective and alleviative effect of isofraxidin on MI and uncovered its underlying mechanism related to the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition.", "journal": "Inflammation", "date": "2020-01-10", "authors": ["GuofanChen", "XiaozhengSong", "DongmingLin", "PengXu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10753-019-01158-z"}

{"title": "Generating ring-shaped engineered heart tissues from ventricular and atrial human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "The functions of the heart are achieved through coordination of different cardiac cell subtypes (e.g., ventricular, atrial, conduction-tissue cardiomyocytes). Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) offer unique opportunities for cardiac research. Traditional studies using these cells focused on single-cells and utilized mixed cell populations. Our goal was to develop clinically-relevant engineered heart tissues (EHTs) comprised of chamber-specific hPSC-CMs. Here we show that such EHTs can be generated by directing hPSCs to differentiate into ventricular or atrial cardiomyocytes, and then embedding these cardiomyocytes in a collagen-hydrogel to create chamber-specific, ring-shaped, EHTs.

{"title": "Infarct Zone: a Novel Platform for Exosome Trade in Cardiac Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "The global incidence of coronary artery diseases (CADs), especially myocardial infarction (MI), has drastically increased in recent years. Even though the conventional therapies have improved the outcomes, the post-MI complications and the increased rate of recurrence among the survivors are still alarming. Molecular events associated with the pathogenesis and the adaptive responses of the surviving myocardium are largely unknown. Focus on exosome-mediated signaling for cell-cell/matrix communications at the infarct zone reflects an emerging opportunity in cardiac regeneration. Also, cardiac tissue engineering provides promising insights for the next generation of therapeutic approaches in the management of CADs. In this article, we critically reviewed the current understanding on the biology of cardiac exosomes, therapeutic potential of exosomes, and recent developments in cardiac tissue engineering and discussed novel translational approaches based on tissue engineering and exosomes for cardiac regeneration and CADs.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular translational research", "date": "2020-01-08", "authors": ["Finosh GThankam", "Devendra KAgrawal"], "doi": "10.1007/s12265-019-09952-8\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1136/hrt.2005.086934\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.108660\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00159\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.022\n10.4161/biom.19429\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2018.10.007\n10.1124/jpet.118.256065\n10.1038/s41598-019-42079-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.032\n10.1038/nm.2507\n10.1016/j.carpath.2005.10.006\n10.1038/s41598-018-35391-7\n10.1038/nrcardio.2011.38\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306919\n10.1084/jem.20070885\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.11.015\n10.1172/JCI85782\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.052126\n10.1016/j.jss.2018.11.037\n10.1007/s00441-005-0144-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.199471\n10.1093/cvr/cvu022\n10.1002/path.2145\n10.18632/oncotarget.6022\n10.1016/j.jhep.2013.03.028\n10.1681/ASN.2012101031\n10.1038/s41598-019-42746-1\n10.1530/JOE-15-0201\n10.1038/s41398-019-0459-9\n10.1007/978-1-62703-453-1_10\n10.1038/ncomms15287\n10.1083/jcb.201211138\n10.1111/tra.12016\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6476-10.2011\n10.1038/ncb1596\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601842\n10.1016/j.cub.2011.03.043\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.05.020\n10.1038/nature03504\n10.1074/jbc.M110.190009\n10.1073/pnas.0308413101\n10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01225.x\n10.1038/ncb2502\n10.1126/science.1153124\n10.1182/blood-2003-03-0871\n10.1074/jbc.M207550200\n10.3109/10409238.2010.502516\n10.1038/nature07961\n10.1016/j.ceb.2009.03.007\n10.1111/j.1600-0854.2004.0167.x\n10.1016/j.ceb.2007.07.002\n10.1016/j.tcb.2010.01.004\n10.1242/jcs.090985\n10.1074/jbc.M116.718023\n10.1042/BCJ20160783\n10.1016/j.ceb.2004.06.003\n10.1038/s41598-019-39882-z\n10.1242/jcs.128868\n10.1038/nri2567\n10.3390/genes4020152\n10.1152/ajpheart.01355.2006\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01394\n10.1080/21541248.2016.1264352\n10.1038/ncomms4477\n10.1038/ncomms13588\n10.1038/ncb2000\n10.1016/j.mcn.2010.11.004\n10.1111/j.1600-0854.2004.00257.x\n10.1016/j.jprot.2010.06.006\n10.1182/blood-2004-03-0824\n10.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01041.x\n10.1073/pnas.0307981100\n10.1002/eji.200424969\n10.1074/jbc.M109.041152\n10.1242/jcs.074088\n10.1152/ajpheart.00100.2018\n10.1160/TH15-04-0325\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310752\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000249639.36915.04\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00133\n10.1161/01.RES.82.11.1111\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.7\n10.1152/ajpheart.00835.2012\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2013.04.014\n10.1007/s12192-011-0311-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.10.002\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.011\n10.1111/jcmm.12589\n10.1371/journal.pone.0034653\n10.3402/jev.v2i0.20167\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300639\n10.1016/j.ahj.2012.08.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0032765\n10.1002/wnan.1395\n10.1371/journal.pone.0061852\n10.1016/j.scr.2009.12.003\n10.1016/j.scr.2008.02.002\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.028\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023106\n10.1038/s41598-018-19581-x\n10.1038/cddis.2016.181\n10.1038/srep13721\n10.1038/s41419-018-0274-x\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.09.011\n10.1161/hc4701.100516\n10.1160/TH03-05-0294\n10.1007/s00109-016-1387-2\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.06.008\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2016.12.022\n10.1371/journal.pone.0154274\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301209\n10.1152/ajpheart.00602.2017\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.00648\n10.1111/sji.12648\n10.1093/cvr/cvs007\n10.4161/biom.19429\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.01.069\n10.1038/am.2014.19\n10.1039/C5RA04448K\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.09.087\n10.1177/0883911513508670\n10.1002/jbm.a.34895\n10.2174/1874210601711010312\n10.1002/jbm.a.34895\n10.1016/j.jcis.2015.06.034\n10.1038/srep39806\n10.1039/c3ra43710h\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.05.083\n10.1039/C4RA16254D\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.03.010\n10.1016/j.jcis.2015.06.034\n10.1021/acsnano.5b08015\n10.3402/jev.v4.30087\n10.1002/9783527689934\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01199\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.01.122\n10.1002/bit.26320\n10.1021/acsami.7b17620\n10.1186/s13287-016-0391-3"}

However, recent trends for IE and other serious infections among persons with substance use disorders (SUDs) are unknown.\nUsing the Premier Healthcare Database, we identified hospitalizations from 2012 through 2017 among adults with primary discharge diagnoses of bacterial infections and secondary SUD diagnoses, using International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification Ninth and Tenth Revision codes. We calculated annual rates of infections with SUD diagnoses and evaluated temporal trends. Blood and cardiac tissue specimens were identified from IE hospitalizations to describe the microbiology distribution and temporal trends among hospitalizations with and without SUDs.\nAmong 72 481 weighted IE admissions recorded, SUD diagnoses increased from 19.9% in 2012 to 39.4% in 2017 (P < .0001). Hospitalizations with SUDs increased from 1.1 to 2.1 per 100 000 persons for IE, 1.4 to 2.4 per 100 000 persons for osteomyelitis, 0.5 to 0.9 per 100 000 persons for central nervous system abscesses, and 24.4 to 32.9 per 100 000 persons for skin and soft tissue infections. For adults aged 18-44 years, IE-SUD hospitalizations more than doubled, from 1.6 in 2012 to 3.6 in 2017 per 100 000 persons. Among all IE-SUD hospitalizations, 50.3% had a Staphylococcus aureus infection, compared with 19.4% of IE hospitalizations without SUDs.\nRates of hospitalization for serious infections among persons with SUDs are increasing, driven primarily by younger age groups.

{"title": "Multi-level transcriptome sequencing identifies COL1A1 as a candidate marker in human heart failure progression.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) has been recognized as a global pandemic with a high rate of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Although numerous advances have been made, its representative molecular signatures remain largely unknown, especially the role of genes in HF progression. The aim of the present prospective follow-up study was to reveal potential biomarkers associated with the progression of heart failure.\nWe generated multi-level transcriptomic data from a cohort of left ventricular heart tissue collected from 21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors. By using Masson staining to calculate the fibrosis percentage for each sample, we applied lasso regression model to identify the genes associated with fibrosis as well as progression. The genes were further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the plasma level in a validation cohort (139 HF patients) for predicting HF progression.\nBased on the multi-level transcriptomic data, we examined differentially expressed genes [mRNAs, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)] in the study cohort. The follow-up functional annotation and regulatory network analyses revealed their potential roles in regulating extracellular matrix.

Animals were divided into five groups of 8 animals each treated weekly by Deca-Durabolin (nandrolone decanoate) at 30\u00a0g/kg of BW during one month (GI); during two months (GII); during three months (GIII); during three months followed by six weeks of treatment discontinuation (GIV) and Control (C). Cytohistological examinations to determine the histopathological damage properties of the heart and tests were performed.\nOur results showed that the animals supported very well the administrated substance. Our study showed important degenerative changes in cardiac and gonadal tissues after one months of androgen abuse. These damages increases with the duration of treatment with well marked cell lesions, and worsen again 6\u00a0weeks after stopping treatment in cardiac tissue, whereas the gonadal tissue does not recover completely during this period.\nThese results ported that the use of AAS with \"Cycling\" may lead to irreversibly destroy the heart tissue.

Currently, the methods to treat these diseases are restricted to lifestyle change, pharmaceuticals, and eventually heart transplant if the condition is severe enough. While these treatment options are the standard for caring for patients who suffer from heart disease, limited regenerative ability of the heart restricts the effectiveness of treatment and may lead to other heart-related health problems in the future. Because of the increasing need for more effective therapeutic technologies for treating diseased heart tissue, cardiac patches are now a large focus for researchers. The cardiac patches are designed to be integrated into the patients' natural tissue to introduce mechanical support and healing to the damaged areas. As a promising alternative, synthetic biodegradable polymer based biomaterials can be easily manipulated to customize material properties, as well as possess certain desired characteristics for cardiac patch use. This comprehensive review summarizes recent works on synthetic biodegradable cardiac patches implanted into infarcted animal models.

{"title": "Inhibition of the proteasome preserves Mitofusin-2 and mitochondrial integrity, protecting cardiomyocytes during ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte loss is the main cause of myocardial dysfunction following an ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered mitochondrial network dynamics play central roles in cardiomyocyte death. Proteasome inhibition is cardioprotective in the setting of IR; however, the mechanisms underlying this protection are not well-understood. Several proteins that regulate mitochondrial dynamics and energy metabolism, including Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), are degraded by the proteasome. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether proteasome inhibition can protect cardiomyocytes from IR damage by maintaining Mfn2 levels and preserving mitochondrial network integrity. Using ex vivo Langendorff-perfused rat hearts and in vitro neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, we showed that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reduced IR-induced cardiomyocyte death. Moreover, MG132 preserved mitochondrial mass, prevented mitochondrial network fragmentation, and abolished IR-induced reductions in Mfn2 levels in heart tissue and cultured cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, Mfn2 overexpression also prevented cardiomyocyte death. This effect was apparently specific to Mfn2, as overexpression of Miro1, another protein implicated in mitochondrial dynamics, did not confer the same protection. Our results suggest that proteasome inhibition protects cardiomyocytes from IR damage. This effect could be partly mediated by preservation of Mfn2 and therefore mitochondrial integrity.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

This prevents adequate counseling and clear recommendations in these families. We aim to identify novel genes or modifiers associated with DCM.\nWe performed computational ranking of human genes based on coexpression with a predefined set of genes known to be associated with DCM, which allowed us to prioritize gene candidates for their likelihood of being involved in DCM. Top candidates will be checked for variants in the available whole-exome sequencing data of 142 DCM patients. RNA was isolated from cardiac biopsies to investigate gene expression.\nPDLIM5 was classified as the top candidate. An interesting heterozygous variant (189_190delinsGG) was found in a DCM patient with a known pathogenic truncating TTN-variant. The PDLIM5 loss-of-function (LoF) variant affected all cardiac-specific isoforms of PDLIM5 and no LoF variants were detected in the same region in a control cohort of 26,000 individuals. RNA expression of PDLIM5 and its direct interactors (MYOT, LDB3, and MYOZ2) was increased in cardiac tissue of this patient, indicating a possible compensatory mechanism. The PDLIM5 variant cosegregated with the TTN-variant and the phenotype, leading to a high disease penetrance in this family. A second patient was an infant with a homozygous 10\u00a0kb-deletion of exon 2 in PDLIM5 resulting in early-onset cardiac disease, showing the importance of PDLIM5 in cardiac function.\nHeterozygous PDLIM5 variants are rare and therefore will not have a major contribution in DCM.

{"title": "Adipose Mesenchymal Cells-Derived EVs Alleviate DOCA-Salt-Induced Hypertension by Promoting Cardio-Renal Protection.", "abstract": "Hypertension is a long-term condition that can increase organ susceptibility to insults and lead to severe complications such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived membrane structures that participate in cell-cell communication by exporting encapsulated molecules to target cells, regulating physiological and pathological processes. We here demonstrate that multiple administration of EVs from adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC-EVs) in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive model can protect renal tissue by maintaining its filtration capacity. Indeed, ASC-EVs downregulated the pro-inflammatory molecules monocyte chemoattracting protein-1 (MCP-1) and plasminogen activating inhibitor-1 (PAI1) and reduced recruitment of macrophages in the kidney. Moreover, ASC-EVs prevented cardiac tissue fibrosis and maintained blood pressure within normal levels, thus demonstrating their multiple favorable effects in different organs. By applying microRNA (miRNA) microarray profile of the kidney of DOCA-salt rats, we identified a selective miRNA signature associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). One of the key pathways found was the axis miR-200-TGF-\u03b2, that was significantly altered by EV administration, thereby affecting the EMT signaling and preventing renal inflammatory response and fibrosis development. Our results indicate that EVs can be a potent therapeutic tool for the treatment of hypertension-induced CKD in cardio-renal syndrome.", "journal": "Molecular therapy.

{"title": "Transcriptional sex and regional differences in paired human atrial and ventricular cardiac biopsies collected in vivo.", "abstract": "Transcriptional studies of the human heart provide insight into physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms, essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of normal cardiac function and how they are altered by disease. To improve the understanding of why men and women may respond differently to the same therapeutic treatment it is crucial to learn more about sex-specific transcriptional differences. In this study the transcriptome of right atrium and left ventricle was compared across sex and regional location. Paired biopsies from five male and five female patients undergoing aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting were included. Gene expression analysis identified 620 differentially expressed transcripts in atrial and ventricular tissue in men and 471 differentially expressed transcripts in women. In total 339 of these transcripts overlapped across sex but notably, 281 were unique in the male tissue and 162 in the female tissue, displaying marked sex differences in the transcriptional machinery. The transcriptional activity was significantly higher in atrias than in ventricles as 70% of the differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the atrial tissue. Furthermore, pathway- and functional annotation analyses performed on the differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for a more heterogeneous composition of biological processes in atrial compared with the ventricular tissue, and a dominance of differentially expressed genes associated with infection disease was observed. The results reported here provide increased insights about transcriptional differences between the cardiac atrium and ventricle but also reveal transcriptional differences in the human heart that can be attributed to sex.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2019-12-24", "authors": ["JaneSynnergren", "KristinaVukusic", "PierreD\u00f6nnes", "MarianneJonsson", "AndersLindahl", "G\u00f6ranDellgren", "AndersJeppsson", "JuliaAsp"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00036.2019"}

In this review we examine myocardial slices, a novel model in the translational arena. Myocardial slices are living ultra-thin sections of heart tissue. Slices maintain the myocardium's native function (contractility, electrophysiology) and structure (multicellularity, extracellular matrix) and can be prepared from animal and human tissue. The discussion begins with the history and current advances in the model, the different interlaboratory methods of preparation and their potential impact on results. We then contextualize slices' advantages and limitations by comparing it with other cardiac models. Recently, sophisticated methods have enabled slices to be cultured chronically in vitro while preserving the functional and structural phenotype. This is more timely now than ever where chronic physiologically relevant in vitro platforms for assessment of therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. We interrogate the technological developments that have permitted this, their limitations, and future directions.

Clinically, statin use is associated with a lower risk for heart failure in breast cancer patients with anthracycline chemotherapy. So, the purpose of our study was to investigate whether survivin mediates the protective effect of statin against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.\nMice were treated once a week with 5\u00a0mg/kg doxorubicin for 4\u00a0weeks with or without atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg/kg every day then heart tissues were analyzed. Molecular and cellular biology analyses were performed with H9c2 cell lysates.\nDoxorubicin suppressed survivin expression via activation of FOXO1 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Whereas, atorvastatin inhibited FOXO1 by increasing phosphorylation and inhibiting nuclear localization. Doxorubicin induced FOXO1 binding to STAT3 and prevented STAT3 from interacting with Sp1. However, atorvastatin inhibited these interactions and stabilized STAT3/Sp1 transcription complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that doxorubicin decreased STAT3/Sp1 complex binding to survivin promoter, whereas atorvastatin stabilized this binding. In mouse model, atorvastatin rescued doxorubicin-induced reduction of survivin expression and of heart function measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.\nOur study suggested a new pathophysiologic mechanism that survivin mediated protective effect of atorvastatin against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via FOXO1/STAT3/Sp1 transcriptional network.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2019-12-24", "authors": ["JaewonOh", "Beom SeobLee", "GibbeumLim", "HeejungLim", "Chan JooLee", "SunghaPark", "Sang-HakLee", "Ji HyungChung", "Seok-MinKang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.12.007"}
{"title": "Dissection of heterocellular cross-talk in vascularized cardiac tissue mimetics.", "abstract": "Cellular specialization and interaction with other cell types in cardiac tissue is essential for the coordinated function of cell populations in the heart. The complex interplay between cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts is necessary for adaptation but can also lead to pathophysiological remodeling. To understand this complex interplay, we developed 3D vascularized cardiac tissue mimetics (CTM) to study heterocellular cross-talk in hypertrophic, hypoxic and fibrogenic environments. This 3D platform responds to physiologic and pathologic stressors and mimics the microenvironment of diseased tissue. In combination with endothelial cell fluorescence reporters, these cardiac tissue mimetics can be used to precisely visualize and quantify cellular and functional responses upon stress stimulation. Utilizing this platform, we demonstrate that stimulation of \u03b1/\u03b2-adrenergic receptors with phenylephrine (PE) promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, metabolic maturation and vascularization of CTMs. Increased vascularization was promoted by conditioned medium of PE-stimulated cardiomyocytes and blocked by inhibiting VEGF or upon \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist treatment, demonstrating cardiomyocyte-endothelial cross-talk. Pathophysiological stressors such as severe hypoxia reduced angiogenic sprouting and increased cell death, while TGF \u03b22 stimulation increased collagen deposition concomitant to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

New therapeutic tools based on stem cell therapy may modulate the unbalanced inflammation in the damaged cardiac tissue, contributing to the resolution of this pathological condition. The main goal of this study was to analyze the immunomodulatory effects of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) and their extracellular vesicles (EV-CDCs), delivered by intrapericardial administration in a clinically relevant animal model, during the initial pro-inflammatory phase of an induced myocardial infarction. This effect was assessed in peripheral blood and pericardial fluid leukocytes from infarcted animals. Additionally, cardiac functional parameters, troponin I, hematological and biochemical components were also analyzed to characterize myocardial infarction-induced changes, as well as the safety aspects of these procedures. Our preclinical study demonstrated a successful myocardial infarction induction in all animals, without any reported adverse effect related to the intrapericardial administration of CDCs or EV-CDCs. Significant changes were observed in biochemical and immunological parameters after myocardial infarction. The analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes revealed an increase of M2 monocytes in the EV-CDCs group, while no differences were reported in other lymphocyte subsets. Moreover, arginase-1 (M2-differentiation marker) was significantly increased in pericardial fluids 24\u00a0h after EV-CDCs administration. In summary, we demonstrate that, in our experimental conditions, intrapericardially administered EV-CDCs have an immunomodulatory effect on monocyte polarization, showing a beneficial effect for counteracting an unbalanced inflammatory reaction in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.

{"title": "Bisphenol A-induced oxidative damage in the hepatic and cardiac tissues of rats: The modulatory role of sesame lignans.", "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental pollutant that is widely produced throughout the world. It is primarily used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins, paints and dental materials. BPA has been reported to promote hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. The antioxidant activity of sesame lignans is well established. The current study assessed the protective efficiency of sesame lignans against BPA-induced hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Rats were divided into 4 groups: A control group, a BPA-treated group, a sesame lignans-treated group and a sesame lignans and BPA-treated group. Rats were orally administered their respective doses daily [30 mg/kg body weight (BW) BPA and/or 20 mg/kg BW sesame lignans] for 6 weeks. Liver function tests were performed using serum of all groups. Lipid profile and antioxidant status were also measured in liver tissue of the studied groups. The results were confirmed by histopathological examination of liver and heart tissues. The oral administration of BPA was revealed to elicit significant decreases in the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione. It also significantly increased levels of malondialdehyde. Furthermore, BPA-treatment resulted in lipid accumulation, elevated activities of alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase MB and lactate dehydrogenase, and histological changes of liver and heart tissues. However, the co-administration of sesame lignans and BPA attenuated hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and BPA-induced histological changes. The results of the current study indicated that sesame lignans may be helpful in the development of novel natural drugs to treat hepatic and cardiovascular disorders.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2019-12-20", "authors": ["Saber MEweda", "Al Sayeda ANewairy", "Heba MAbdou", "Assmaa SGaber"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2019.8193\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2007.07.010\n10.1016/j.tox.2006.06.009\n10.1590/S1413-81232012000200015\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.09.058\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.09.088\n10.1155/2012/194829\n10.1016/j.envres.2016.02.026\n10.1038/srep21982\n10.1016/j.microc.2018.04.011\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.07.028\n10.1097/01.shk.0000232274.88354.8d\n10.1016/j.cccn.2004.12.009\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.05.006\n10.1002/jsfa.7035\n10.1016/j.bioorg.2013.06.009\n10.1080/87559120903564464\n10.1021/jf2040687\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.07.016\n10.1016/j.cofs.2016.02.002\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.12.010\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.11.047\n10.1016/j.toxrep.2014.04.003\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.09.031\n10.1016/0003-2697(79)90738-3\n10.1016/0003-2697(80)90139-6\n10.1016/0003-2697(88)90564-7\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1974.tb03714.x\n10.1016/j.tiv.2017.02.018\n10.3923/pjbs.2014.1152.1160\n10.3109/10715762.2010.498477\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.092\n10.1016/j.achaem.2017.08.005\n10.1016/j.fct.2017.12.021\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2017.05.001\n10.1002/hep.24685\n10.1016/j.tox.2014.08.006\n10.1016/j.tox.2012.09.013\n10.1016/j.fct.2010.07.019\n10.1016/j.jpba.2017.02.058\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.10.013\n10.1016/j.tox.2016.02.007\n10.1007/s10616-013-9672-1\n10.1155/2014/259763\n10.12816/0000829\n10.1016/j.fct.2013.11.017\n10.1016/j.fct.2010.05.055\n10.1155/2013/365892\n10.1016/j.jff.2017.08.036\n10.1007/s00394-006-0617-8\n10.1016/S0955-2863(01)00224-8\n10.6090/jarq.37.151\n10.1016/j.lfs.2015.02.008\n10.1016/S0952-3278(98)90112-0\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03224.x\n10.1590/S0102-695X2012005000027\n10.3389/fphar.2016.00024\n10.1016/S2221-1691(12)60162-2\n10.1039/C2FO30220A"}

Various in vitro methods have been developed to improve the accuracy in the result of drug-induced cardiac toxicity screening. Herein, we propose a novel SU-8 cantilever integrated with an electromechanical-stimulator to enhance the maturation of cultured cardiac cells. The simultaneous electromechanical stimulation significantly enhances the contraction force of the cardiomyocytes, thereby increasing cantilever displacement. Fluorescence microscopy analysis was performed to confirm the improved maturation of the cardiomyocytes. After the initial experiments, the contractile behaviors of the cultured cardiomyocytes were investigated by measuring the mechanical deformation of the SU-8 cantilever. Finally, the proposed electromechanical-stimulator-integrated SU-8 cantilever was used to evaluate the adverse effects of different cardiac vascular drugs, i.e., verapamil, lidocaine, and isoproterenol, on the cultured cardiomyocytes. The physiology of the cardiac-drug-treated cardiomyocytes was examined with and without electrical stimulation of the cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Ablating the Rab-GTPase activating protein TBC1D1 predisposes rats to high-fat diet-induced cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Although the role of TBC1D1 within the heart remains unknown, expression of TBC1D1 increases in the left ventricle following an acute infarction, suggesting a biological importance within this tissue. We investigated the mechanistic role of TBC1D1 within the heart, aiming to establish the consequences of attenuating TBC1D1 signalling in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as to determine potential sex differences. TBC1D1 ablation increased plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein content and myocardial palmitate oxidation. Following high-fat feeding, TBC1D1 ablation dramatically increased fibrosis and induced end-diastolic dysfunction in both male and female rats in the absence of changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Altogether, independent of sex, ablating TBC1D1 predisposes the left ventricle to pathological remodelling following high-fat feeding, and suggests TBC1D1 protects against diabetic cardiomyopathy.\nTBC1D1, a Rab-GTPase activating protein, is involved in the regulation of glucose handling and substrate metabolism within skeletal muscle, and is essential for maintaining pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass and insulin secretion. However, the function of TBC1D1 within the heart is largely unknown. Therefore, we examined the role of TBC1D1 in the left ventricle and the functional consequence of ablating TBC1D1 on the susceptibility to high-fat diet-induced abnormalities. Since mutations within TBC1D1 (R125W) display stronger associations with clinical parameters in women, we further examined possible sex differences in the predisposition to diabetic cardiomyopathy. In control-fed animals, TBC1D1 ablation did not alter insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, or echocardiogram parameters, but increased accumulation of a plasma membrane fatty acid transporter and the capacity for palmitate oxidation. When challenged with an 8\u00a0week high-fat diet, TBC1D1 knockout rats displayed a four-fold increase in fibrosis compared to wild-type animals, and this was associated with diastolic dysfunction, suggesting a predisposition to diet-induced cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, high-fat feeding only induced cardiac hypertrophy in male TBC1D1 knockout animals, implicating a possible sex difference. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity and substrate sensitivity to pyruvate and ADP were not altered by diet or TBC1D1 ablation, nor were markers of oxidative stress, or indices of overt heart failure. Altogether, independent of sex, ablation of TBC1D1 not only increased the susceptibility to high-fat diet-induced diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular fibrosis, independent of sex, but also predisposed male animals to the development of cardiac hypertrophy.

Recent evidence indicates that ARVC and ACM caused by pathogenic variants in the FLNC gene encoding filamin C, a major cardiac structural protein, may have different molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. We sought to identify dysregulated biological pathways in FLNC-associated ACM. RNA was extracted from seven paraffin-embedded left ventricular tissue samples from deceased ACM patients carrying FLNC variants and sequenced. Transcript levels of 623 genes were upregulated and 486 genes were reduced in ACM in comparison to control samples. The cell adhesion pathway and ILK signalling were among the prominent dysregulated pathways in ACM. Consistent with these findings, transcript levels of cell adhesion genes JAM2, NEO1, VCAM1 and PTPRC were upregulated in ACM samples. Moreover, several actin-associated genes, including FLNC, VCL, PARVB and MYL7, were suppressed, suggesting dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Analysis of the transcriptome for dysregulated biological pathways predicted activation of inflammation and apoptosis and suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and MTORC1 signalling in ACM. Our data suggests dysregulated cell adhesion and ILK signalling as novel putative pathogenic mechanisms of ACM caused by FLNC variants which are distinct from the postulated disease mechanism of classic ARVC caused by desmosomal gene mutations.

Rabbits were divided into rosuvastatin, rosuvastatin + L-NAME, control, and L-NAME groups.

Plasma NO end product levels were measured during IR. Then, hearts were excised and Langendorff-perfused for optical mapping studies. Cardiac tissues were sampled for Western blot analysis. Rosuvastatin increased plasma NO levels during IR, which was abrogated by L-NAME. Spontaneous VF during IR was suppressed by rosuvastatin (P < 0.001).

At autopsy, the heart showed typical features of chronic Chagastic cardiomyopathy: chronic lymphocytic myocarditis with extensive fibrosis and the formation of an apical aneurysm. The pathogenic protozoa were not detected in the cardiac tissue. The kidney showed typical features of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).

In this work, we used high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect the early and late effects of radiation on the metabolism of murine hearts. The hearts of C57Bl/6NCrl female mice were irradiated in vivo with single 0.2\u00a0Gy or 2\u00a0Gy doses using 6 MV photons, then tissues were collected 48\u00a0h and 20\u00a0weeks after exposure. The most distinct changes in the profile of polar metabolites were detected 48\u00a0h after irradiation with 2\u00a0Gy, and included increased levels of pantothenate and glutamate as well as decreased levels of alanine, malonate, acetylcarnitine, glycine and adenosine. Significant effects of the 2\u00a0Gy dose were also observed 20\u00a0weeks after irradiation and included decreased levels of glutamine and acetylcarnitine when compared with age-matched controls. Moreover, several differences were observed between hearts irradiated with 2\u00a0Gy and analyzed either 48\u00a0h or 20\u00a0weeks after the exposure, which included changes in levels of acetylcarnitine, alanine, glycine, glutamate, glutamine, formate, myo-inositol and trimethylamine. No statistically significant effects induced by the 0.2\u00a0Gy dose were observed 20\u00a0weeks after irradiation. In general, radiation-affected compounds were associated with energy metabolism, fatty acid beta-oxidation, oxidative stress and damage to cell structures.

The present study was to explore the protective effects of FIS on cardiac dysfunction in HFD-fed mice. We found that FIS alleviated HFD-triggered metabolic disorder by reducing body weight, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and insulin resistance. Moreover, FIS supplements significantly alleviated dyslipidemia in both mouse hearts and cardiomyocytes stimulated by metabolic stress. FIS treatment abolished HFD-induced inflammatory response in heart tissues through suppressing TNF receptor-1/TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (Tnfr-1/Traf-2) signaling. Furthermore, FIS induced a strong reduction in the expression of fibrosis-related genes, contributing to the inhibition of fibrosis by inactivating transforming growth factor (Tgf)-\u03b21/Smads/Erk1/2 signaling.

{"title": "Unravelling the ultrastructural details of \u03b1T-catenin-deficient cell-cell contacts between heart muscle cells by the use of FIB-SEM.", "abstract": "The intercalated disc is an important structure in cardiomyocytes, as it is essential to maintain correct contraction and proper functioning of the heart. Adhesion and communication between cardiomyocytes are mediated by three main types of intercellular junctions, all residing in the intercalated disc: gap junctions, desmosomes and the areae compositae. Mutations in genes that encode junctional proteins, including \u03b1T-catenin (encoded by CTNNA3), have been linked to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death. In mice, the loss of \u03b1T-catenin in cardiomyocytes leads to impaired heart function, fibrosis, changed expression of desmosomal proteins and increased risk for arrhythmias following ischemia-reperfusion. Currently, it is unclear how the intercalated disc and the intercellular junctions are organised in 3D in the hearts of this \u03b1T-catenin knockout (KO) mouse model. In order to scrutinise this, ventricular cardiac tissue of \u03b1T-catenin KO mice was used for volume electron microscopy (VEM), making use of Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), allowing a careful 3D reconstruction of the intercalated disc, including gap junctions and desmosomes. Although \u03b1T-catenin KO and control mice display a comparable organisation of the sarcomere and the different intercalated disc regions, the folds of the plicae region of the intercalated disc are longer and more narrow in the KO heart, and the pale region between the sarcomere and the intercalated disc is larger. In addition, \u03b1T-catenin KO intercalated discs appear to have smaller gap junctions and desmosomes in the plicae region, while gap junctions are larger in the interplicae region of the intercalated disc. Although the reason for this remodelling of the ultrastructure after \u03b1T-catenin deletion remains unclear, the excellent resolution of the FIB-SEM technology allows us to reconstruct details that were not reported before. LAY DESCRIPTION: Cardiomyocytes are cells that make up the heart muscle. As the chief cell type of the heart, cardiomyocytes are primarily involved in the contractile function of the heart that enables the pumping of blood around the body. Cardiac muscle cells are connected to each other at their short end by numerous intercellular junctions forming together a structure called the intercalated disc. These intercellular junctions comprise specific protein complexes, which are crucial for both intercellular adhesion and correct contraction of the heart. Imaging by conventional electron microscopy (EM) revealed a heavily folded intercalated disc with apparently random organization of the intercellular junctions. However, this conclusion was based on analysis in two dimensions (2D). 3D information of these structures is needed to unravel their true organization and function. In the present study, we used a more contemporary technique, called volume EM, to image and reconstruct the intercalated discs in 3D. By this approach, EM images are made from a whole block of tissue what differs significantly from classical EM methods that uses only one very thin slice for imaging. Further, we analyzed in comparison to normal mice also a mouse model for cardiomyopathy in which a specific protein of the cardiac intercellular junctions, \u03b1T-catenin, is absent. Volume EM revealed that in the hearts of these mice with cardiomyopathy, the finger-like folds of the intercalated disc are longer and thinner compared to control hearts. Also the intercellular junctions on the folded parts of the intercalated disc are smaller and their connection to the striated cytoskeleton seems further away. In conclusion, our volume EM study has expanded our understanding of 3D structures at the intercalated discs and will pave the way for more detailed models of disturbed cell-cell contacts associated with heart failure.", "journal": "Journal of microscopy", "date": "2019-12-13", "authors": ["BVanslembrouck", "AKremer", "FVAN Roy", "SLippens", "JVAN Hengel"], "doi": "10.1111/jmi.12855"}

Cluster analysis results of miRNAs showed that compared with the control group, the expression of miR-133a-5p in methamphetamine-induced rat hearts was decreased significantly; rhynchophylline could significantly increase the expression of miR-133a-5p. The result was verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results of target gene predictive software and related research showed that ROCK2 protein may be the target gene of miR-133a-5p. The immunohistochemistry results of heart tissues showed that the expression of ROCK2 protein was significantly upregulated in the methamphetamine group and downregulate in the rhynchophylline group; the difference between the MK-801 group and the methamphetamine group was not significant.

{"title": "Coronary artery plaque growth: A two-way coupled shear stress-driven model.", "abstract": "Atherosclerosis in coronary arteries can lead to plaque growth, stenosis formation, and blockage of the blood flow supplying the heart tissue. Several studies have shown that hemodynamics play an important role in the growth of coronary artery plaques. Specifically, low wall shear stress (WSS) appears to be the leading hemodynamic parameter promoting atherosclerotic plaque growth, which in turn influences the blood flow and WSS distribution. Therefore, a two-way coupled interaction exists between WSS and atherosclerosis growth. In this work, a computational framework was developed to study the coupling between WSS and plaque growth in coronary arteries. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to quantify WSS distribution. Surface mesh nodes were moved in the inward normal direction according to a growth model based on WSS. After each growth stage, the geometry was updated and the CFD simulation repeated to find updated WSS values for the next growth stage. One hundred twenty growth stages were simulated in an idealized tube and an image-based left anterior descending artery. An automated framework was developed using open-source software to couple CFD simulations with growth. Changes in plaque morphology and hemodynamic patterns during different growth stages are presented. The results show larger plaque growth towards the downstream segment of the plaque, agreeing with the reported clinical observations. The developed framework could be used to establish hemodynamic-driven growth models and study the interaction between these processes.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2019-12-11", "authors": ["AmirhosseinArzani"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.3293"}

In this work, an injectable alginate hydrogel containing silk fibroin (SF) microspheres with the capability to sustain the release of IGF-1 was prepared to induce myocardial repair after myocardial infarction (MI). First, IGF-1 was physically adsorbed onto SF microspheres prepared by the coaxial needle system, and these IGF-1-containing microspheres were subsequently encapsulated into sodium alginate solutions at different concentrations (1.0-2.5%). Finally, this solution was crosslinked with 0.68% calcium gluconate solution to prepare the composite injectable hydrogel. The composite hydrogel prepared using a sodium alginate solution at a concentration of 1.5% could promote proliferation of H9C2 cardiomyocytes and reduce the cellular apoptosis rate under hypoxic conditions. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results indicated that SF microspheres as microcarriers could effectively enhance the sustained release of IGF-1 from the hydrogels, causing the composite hydrogel to possess a better sustained release ability than the system without the SF microspheres. Moreover, echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and Masson trichrome staining results indicated that an intramyocardial injection of the composite hydrogel into the peripheral region of a MI rat model could reduce the infarct size and improve the cardiac function after 28 days. The applications of such a composite hydrogel may comprise a powerful platform in cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

{"title": "A Novel Role of Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase 10A in Pathological Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), through degradation of cyclic nucleotides, play critical roles in cardiovascular biology and disease. Our preliminary screening studies have revealed PDE10A upregulation in the diseased heart. However, the roles of PDE10A in cardiovascular biology and disease are largely uncharacterized. The current study is aimed to investigate the regulation and function of PDE10A in cardiac cells and in the progression of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction.\nWe used isolated adult mouse cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, as well as preclinical mouse models of hypertrophy and heart failure. The PDE10A selective inhibitor TP-10, and global PDE10A knock out mice were used.\nWe found that PDE10A expression remains relatively low in normal and exercised heart tissues. However, PDE10A is significantly upregulated in mouse and human failing hearts. In vitro, PDE10A deficiency or inhibiting PDE10A with selective inhibitor TP-10, attenuated cardiac myocyte pathological hypertrophy induced by Angiotensin II, phenylephrine, and isoproterenol, but did not affect cardiac myocyte physiological hypertrophy induced by IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). TP-10 also reduced TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2)-stimulated cardiac fibroblast activation, proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix synthesis. TP-10 treatment elevated both cAMP and cGMP levels in cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, consistent with PDE10A as a cAMP/cGMP dual-specific PDE. In vivo, global PDE10A deficiency significantly attenuated myocardial hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload via transverse aorta constriction or chronic neurohormonal stimulation via Angiotensin II infusion. Importantly, we demonstrated that the pharmacological effect of TP-10 is specifically through PDE10A inhibition. In addition, TP-10 is able to reverse pre-established cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. RNA-Sequencing and bioinformatics analysis further identified a PDE10A-regualted transcriptome involved in cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiomyopathy.\nTaken together, our study elucidates a novel role for PDE10A in the regulation of pathological cardiac remodeling and development of heart failure. Given that PDE10A has been proven to be a safe drug target, PDE10A inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating cardiac diseases associated with cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2019-12-06", "authors": ["SiChen", "YishuaiZhang", "Janet KLighthouse", "Deanne MMickelsen", "JiangbinWu", "PengYao", "Eric MSmall", "ChenYan"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042178"}

Chagasic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of mortality of infected patients, due to compromised electrical and mechanical cardiac function induced by tissue remodeling, especially fibrosis, and lymphocytic infiltration. Some cellular biochemical pathways can be protective to the heart, and we tested if the in vivo activation of the autophagic machinery by rapamycin could reduce parasite-induced myocarditis. Regarding the expression of LC3, an autophagy marker, we observed its upregulation in the cardiac tissue of infected untreated mice. However, after rapamycin treatment, an autophagy inducer, infected mice showed reduced electrical cardiac dysfunctions, myocarditis, cardiac damage, and reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the heart. On the other hand, the parasite's life cycle was not affected, and we observed no modulations in cardiac tissue or blood parasitemia.

Synchronisation of cells in the biomimetic cardiac tissue requires the structural integrity and functional maturation of cardiomyocytes with other cell types. However, it is challenging to synchronise the beating of macroscale cardiac tissues and induce maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from stem cells. Here, we developed a simple assembly technology to modulate cell-cell interactions by combining layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition and centrifugation of cells with collagen type I to control cell-cell interactions for the preparation of cardiac macro tissues (CMTs). We found that maturation of cardiomyocytes in CMTs was largely enhanced by growth factors FGF-4 and ascorbic acid, but synchronisation of cardiac beating required LBL deposition of cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in addition to the growth factors during the maturation process.

{"title": "Exploring cardiac form and function: A length-scale computational biology approach.", "abstract": "The ability to adequately pump blood throughout the body is the result of tightly regulated feedback mechanisms that exist across many spatial scales in the heart. Diseases which impede the function at any one of the spatial scales can cause detrimental cardiac remodeling and eventual heart failure. An overarching goal of cardiac research is to use engineered heart tissue in vitro to study the physiology of diseased heart tissue, develop cell replacement therapies, and explore drug testing applications. A commonality within the field is to manipulate the flow of mechanical signals across the various spatial scales to direct self-organization and build functional tissue. Doing so requires an understanding of how chemical, electrical, and mechanical cues can be used to alter the cellular microenvironment. We discuss how mathematical models have been used in conjunction with experimental techniques to explore various structure-function relations that exist across numerous spatial scales. We highlight how a systems biology approach can be employed to recapitulate in vivo characteristics in vitro at the tissue, cell, and subcellular scales. Specific focus is placed on the interplay between experimental and theoretical approaches. Various modeling methods are showcased to demonstrate the breadth and power afforded to the systems biology approach.

{"title": "Postmortem interval determination using mRNA markers and DNA normalization.", "abstract": "Postmortem interval (PMI) determination is an important part of criminal investigations, but it is still subject to uncertainty. Degradation of mRNA in PMI determination has been studied in decays; however, some studies have reported no correlation between PMI and RNA degradation. Thus, we aimed to determine whether RNA quantity was correlated with PMI. Heart and brain tissues were separated from a mouse model of a 0-48 h PMI with 29 time points. We then coextracted the DNA and RNA in one tube with Bioteke coextraction kits and selected some mRNA markers associated with cell oxygen deprivation and apoptosis as target genes, such as hypoxia-associated factor (HAF), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2a), and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). We measured the quantity of these markers using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and Caspase-3 DNA and 18S were each used for normalization. The results showed that in the heart tissue, the degradation of HIF2a, AIF, and FIH was correlated with PMI, as was the degradation of HIF2a, FIH, and AIF in brain tissue when normalized with Caspase-3 DNA. However, when normalized with 18S, only the degradation of HIF2a in brain tissue was correlated with PMI. Interestingly, the quantity of HAF in brain tissue was found to increase after death with either 18S or Caspase-3 DNA normalization, and it was significantly correlated with 0-48 h PMI. These results indicated that mRNA quantity can be used to determine PMI and that Caspase-3 DNA is feasible for PMI estimation. In summary, we established mathematical models for PMI determination using multiple mRNA markers and multiple tissues and further studies are needed to validate and investigate these markers and mathematical models in human tissues.Duo Peng and Meili Lv contributed equally to this work.", "journal": "International journal of legal medicine", "date": "2019-11-28", "authors": ["DuoPeng", "MeiliLv", "ZhilongLi", "HuanTian", "ShengQiuQu", "BoJin", "BingLong", "WeiboLiang", "LinZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s00414-019-02199-7"}

In this study Balb/c mice were intramuscularly immunized with S. pyogenes SF370 for 4 weeks. Prior to euthanization, physiological parameters like body weight and electrical signalling of the heart were recorded. After euthanization, the heart tissue homogenate was prepared and proteomic alterations were studied using SDS-PAGE and 2D electrophoresis. The expression levels of inflammatory genes like TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3\u00a0and TGF-\u03b2\u00a0were quantified using real time PCR. Insilico analysis was performed to identify the functions of hypothetical proteins and virulence factors involved in the induction of rheumatic carditis. The results showed a reduction in body weight, ulceration, inflammation, cardiac lesions and prolonged PR interval in mice immunized with S. pyogenes SF370, as a result of RHD. The heart related proteins like \u03b1-actinin, fatty acid binding protein-heart, myosin light chain 3, hemoglobin subunit alpha, myoglobin regulatory light chain 2, (ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform), myosin-6, troponin-1 were found to be up-regulated when compared with the control. The functional annotation of S. pyogenes (SF370) was carried out by retrieving 1696 identified proteins and 653 hypothetical protein sequences in NCBI genome database. The conserved domain was identified for 505 proteins. The pfam database documented that the super families of 279 sequences and 40 signal peptides enabled the classification of proteins in different categories like biological (20%), cellular (22%) and molecular functions (36%). Putative transcription repair coupling factor and putative lysine aminopeptidase N terminal are the two virulence factors identified by VICMPRED in S. pyogenes SF370. The two identified virulence factors are involved in altering the mice heart proteome and thereby controlling the streptococcus pyogenes infection.

{"title": "Zinc protects against cadmium-induced toxicity in neonatal murine engineered cardiac tissues via metallothionein-dependent and independent mechanisms.", "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential heavy metal and a prevalent environmental toxin that has been shown to induce significant cardiomyocyte apoptosis in neonatal murine engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs). In contrast, zinc (Zn) is a potent metallothionein (MT) inducer, which plays an important role in protection against Cd toxicity. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of Zn against Cd toxicity in ECTs and explore the underlying mechanisms. ECTs were constructed from neonatal ventricular cells of wild-type (WT) mice and mice with global MT gene deletion (MT-KO). In WT-ECTs, Cd (5-20 \u03bcM) caused a dose-dependent toxicity that was detected within 8\u2009h evidenced by suppressed beating, apoptosis, and LDH release; Zn (50-200 \u03bcM) dose-dependently induced MT expression in ECTs without causing ECT toxicity; co-treatment of ECT with Zn (50\u2009\u00b5M) prevented Cd-induced toxicity. In MT-KO ECTs, Cd toxicity was enhanced; but unexpectedly, cotreatment with Zn provided partial protection against Cd toxicity. Furthermore, Cd, but not Zn, significantly activated Nrf2 and its downstream targets, including HO-1; inhibition of HO-1 by a specific HO-1 inhibitor, ZnPP (10\u2009\u00b5M), significantly increased Cd-induced toxicity, but did not inhibit Zn protection against Cd injury, suggesting that Nrf2-mediated HO-1 activation was not required for Zn protective effect. Finally, the ability of Zn to reduce Cd uptake provided an additional MT-independent mechanism for reducing Cd toxicity. Thus, Zn exerts protective effects against Cd toxicity for murine ECTs that are partially MT-mediated.

This study aims to identify miRNAs that actually play vital role in pathophysiological process of atrial fibrillation and explore miRNA-targeted genes and the involved pathways. Relevant studies were retrieved from the electronic databases of Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library to determine the miRNA expression profiles between atrial fibrillation subjects and non-atrial fibrillation controls. Robustness of results was assessed using sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed based on species, miRNA detection method, sample source, and ethnicity. Quality assessment of studies was independently conducted according to QUADAS-2. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to explore the potential genes and pathways associated with atrial fibrillation, which were targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs. Form of pooled results was shown as log10 odds ratios (logORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and random-effects model was used. In total, 40 articles involving 283 differentially expressed miRNAs were reported. And 51 significantly dysregulated miRNAs were identified in consistent direction, with 22 upregulated and 29 downregulated. Among above-mentioned miRNAs, miR-223-3p (logOR 6.473; P\u2009<\u20090.001) was the most upregulated, while miR-1-5p (logOR 7.290; P\u2009<\u20090.001) was the most downregulated. Subgroup analysis confirmed 53 significantly dysregulated miRNAs (21 upregulated and 32 downregulated) in cardiac tissue, with miRNA-1-5p and miRNA-223-3p being the most upregulated and downregulated miRNAs, respectively. Additionally, miR-328 and miR-1-5p were highly blood-specific, and miR-133 was animal-specific. In the detection method sub-groups, miRNA-29b and miRNA-223-3p were differentially expressed consistently. Four miRNAs, including miRNA-223-3p, miRNA-21, miRNA-328, and miRNA-1-5p, were consistently dysregulated in both Asian and non-Asian.

The definite mechanisms underlying AF pathogenesis remain complicated and unclear. Many studies attempted to discover the transcriptomic changes using microarray technologies, and the present studies for this hot topic have assessed individual miRNAs profiles for AF. However, results of different articles are controversial and not each reported miRNA is actually associated with the pathogenesis of AF. The present systematic review and meta-analysis identified that 51 consistently dysregulated miRNAs were associated with AF. Of these miRNAs, five miRNAs (miRNA-1-5p, miRNA-328, miRNA-29b, miRNA-21, and miRNA-223-3p) may act as novel biomarkers for AF.

Ten different species (n = 3, total = 30) of live ornamental fish were randomly sampled from one big aquarium in a pet store in Belgium. All fish samples were dissected manually for the collection of targeted tissues. The tissue samples were ashed by microwave oven, and the extract was analyzed for copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and Zinc (Zn) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Fe was associated with Cu in muscle tissue (p < 0.05), but neither of them were associated with Zn in the muscle. However, the three micromineral concentrations were correlated in the heart (p < 0.05). Similarly, all of them were correlated in the liver (p < 0.05), but none of them showed a significant association in the tail fin. Excess deposition of minerals in heart tissue is a new observation, and it is not known if this is meant as storage or rather the fish heart has a high requirement for microminerals. Storage in the tail fin should be interpreted as a sign of permanent deposition as a tool to dispose off toxic excess. The lack of correlation between the muscular concentrations of Zn on the one hand, and those of Fe and Cu on the other hand, further suggests that fish species distinctly differ in their micromineral metabolism.

Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism of alcohol-induced cardiac dysplasia remains unknown. We previously reported that alcohol exposure during pregnancy can cause abnormal expression of cardiomyogenesis-related genes, and histone H3K9me3 hypomethylation was observed in alcohol-treated foetal mouse heart. Hence, an imbalance in histone methylation may be involved in alcohol-induced cardiac dysplasia. In this study, we investigated the involvement of G9\u03b1 histone methyltransferase in alcohol-induced cardiac dysplasia in vivo and in vitro using heart tissues of foetal mice and primary cardiomyocytes of neonatal mice. Western blotting revealed that alcohol caused histone H3K9me3 hypomethylation by altering G9\u03b1 histone methyltransferase expression in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, overexpression of cardiomyogenesis-related genes (MEF2C, Cx43, ANP and \u03b2-MHC) was observed in alcohol-exposed foetal mouse heart. Additionally, we demonstrated that G9\u03b1 histone methyltransferase directly interacted with histone H3K9me3 and altered its methylation.

Moreover, UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS was performed to identify the potential metabolites affecting the pathological process of CHF. Metabolomics and network pharmacology analyses were conducted to illustrate the possible pathways and network in CHF treatment. The predicted gene expression levels in heart tissue were verified and assessed by RT-PCR.\nALRP-ZR demonstrated remarkable promotion of hemodynamic indices and alleviated histological damage of heart tissue. Metabolomics analyses showed that the therapeutic effect of ALRP and ZR is mainly associated with the regulation of eight metabolites and ten pathways, which may be responsible for the therapeutic efficacy of ALRP-ZR. Moreover, the results of RT-PCR showed that ALRP-ZR could substantially increase the expression level of energy metabolism-related genes, including PPAR\u03b4, PPAR\u03b3, Lpl, Scd, Fasn and Pla2g2e.\nThe results highlighted the role of ALRP-ZR in the treatment of CHF by influencing the metabolites related to energy metabolism pathway via metabolomics and network pharmacology analyses.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology", "date": "2019-11-20", "authors": ["Jian-XiaWen", "Rui-ShengLi", "JianWang", "Jun-JieHao", "Wei-HanQin", "TaoYang", "Rui-LinWang", "Shi-ZhangWei", "Xiao-YiLiu", "Hao-TianLi", "Jia-BoWang", "Hong-HongLiu", "Yan-LingZhao"], "doi": "10.1111/jphp.13191"}

{"title": "Comparative effectiveness of different antiplatelet agents at reducing TNF-driven inflammatory responses in a mouse model.", "abstract": "Antiplatelet drugs are conventionally used as treatments because of their anti-coagulation functions. However, their pleiotropic effects are of great significance to the treatment of ischaemic cardiovascular diseases. Many studies have reported that an excessive amount of inflammation driven by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is closely related to the prevalence of atherosclerosis. As the drug selection criteria and evaluation methods related to the anti-TNF activity of antiplatelet drugs remain limited, our investigation of these drugs should prove beneficial. In this study, we compared the anti-TNF activity of three antiplatelet agents, namely clopidogrel, sarpogrelate, and cilostazol, using the TNF-induced inflammatory mouse model. After the oral administration of these drugs, acute inflammation was induced via injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or D-galactosamine (D-gal) and TNF. Serum TNF levels, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of TNF in mouse heart tissue, macrophage accumulation in aortic lesions, and mouse survival were analysed to compare the anti-TNF effects of the three antiplatelet agents. Of the three antiplatelet agents, cilostazol significantly reduced the different levels under the most effective observation. In addition, cilostazol was found to attenuate the TNF-stimulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-\u03baB) p65 in the aortic vascular smooth muscle cell line, MOVAS-1 and the D-gal plus TNF-challenged heart tissue of mouse.

Over the last few decades, this complexity has often been undervalued and progress in translational cardiovascular research has been significantly hindered by the lack of appropriate research models. The data collected are often oversimplified and these make the translation of results from the laboratory to clinical trials challenging and occasionally misleading. Living myocardial slices are ultrathin (100-400\u03bcm) sections of living cardiac tissue that maintain the native multicellularity, architecture, and structure of the heart and can provide information at a cellular/subcellular level. They overcome most of the limitations that affect other in vitro models and they can be prepared from human specimens, proving a clinically relevant multicellular human model for translational cardiovascular research. The publication of a reproducible protocol, and the rapid progress in methodological and technological discoveries which prevent significant structural and functional changes associated with chronic in vitro culture, has overcome the last barrier for the in vitro use of this human multicellular preparations.

However, most heart-on-a-chips are not developed for online and continuous monitoring of contractile behavior, which are the main functional characteristics of cardiac tissue. In this study, we designed and investigated on a heart-on-a-chip platform that provides online monitoring of contractile behavior of a 3D cardiac tissue construct. The contractile behavior include contraction force, frequency, and synchronization. They can be evaluated by an image processing system and a piezoelectric sensing system simultaneously. Based on the deformation of a micro-pillar array embedded within the 3D cardiac tissue upon subjected to cardiac contraction, the image processing system provides in situ multi-site detection of the contractile behavior. At the same time, the piezoelectric sensing system measures the contractile behavior of the entire cardiac tissue construct. A 3D cardiac tissue construct was successfully fabricated. Then the heart-on-a-chip platform was validated by applying various motion patterns on the micro-pillars, which mimicked the contraction patterns of the 3D cardiac tissue. The drug reactivity of the 3D cardiac tissue construct after a treatment of isoproterenol and doxorubicin was evaluated by measuring the contractile behavior via the image processing and the piezoelectric sensing systems. The results from the drug reactivity provided by both these measurement systems were consistent with previous reports, demonstrating the reliability of the heart-on-a-chip platform and its potential for use in cardio-related drug screening applications.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2019-11-11", "authors": ["MutsuhitoSakamiya", "YongcongFang", "XingwuMo", "JunyingShen", "TingZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2019.10.001"}

{"title": "An evaluation of some assumptions underpinning the bidomain equations of electrophysiology.", "abstract": "Tissue level cardiac electrophysiology is usually modelled by the bidomain equations, or the monodomain simplification of the bidomain equations. One assumption made when deriving the bidomain equations is that both the intracellular and extracellular spaces are in electrical equilibrium. This assumption neglects the disturbance of this equilibrium in thin regions close to the cell membrane known as Debye layers. We first demonstrate that the governing equations at the cell, or microscale, level may be adapted to take account of these Debye layers with little additional complexity, provided the permittivity within the Debye layers satisfies certain conditions that are believed to be satisfied for biological cells. We then homogenize the microscale equations using a technique developed for an almost periodic microstructure. Cardiac tissue is usually modelled as sheets of cardiac fibres stacked on top of one another. A common assumption is that an orthogonal coordinate system can be defined at each point of cardiac tissue, where the first axis is in the fibre direction, the second axis is orthogonal to the first axis but lies in the sheet of cardiac fibres and the third axis is orthogonal to the cardiac sheet. It is assumed further that both the intracellular and extracellular conductivity tensors are diagonal with respect to these axes and that the diagonal entries of these tensors are constant across the whole tissue. Using the homogenization technique we find that this assumption is usually valid for cardiac tissue, but highlight situations where the assumption may not be valid.", "journal": "Mathematical medicine and biology : a journal of the IMA", "date": "2019-11-05", "authors": ["Jonathan PWhiteley"], "doi": "10.1093/imammb/dqz014"}

{"title": "Multi-directional cellular alignment in 3D guided by electrohydrodynamically-printed microlattices.", "abstract": "Recapitulating aligned cellular architectures of native tissues in vitro is important to engineer artificial tissue analogs with desired biological functions. Here a novel strategy is presented to direct three-dimensional (3D) cellular alignment by embedding cell/collagen hydrogel into the predefined electrohydrodynamically-printed microlattices. The cell/collagen hydrogel, originally filled within the printed microlattices uniformly, was found to gradually develop into densely-populated and highly-aligned bands along the longitudinal direction of the printed microlattices. The cellular alignment was highly dependent on the height, spacing and orientation of the microlattices. The presented method was applicable to multiple cell types including primary cardiomyocytes and the gaps formed between the aligned bands and the lateral walls of the microlattice facilitated the subsequent seeding and rapid alignment of other cell types which enables to engineer anisotropic multicellular tissue constructs. The engineered cardiac patches expressed mature cardiomyocyte-specific phenotypes and exhibited synchronous contractive activities. Multilayer cellular alignment with varied orientation in 3D collagen hydrogel was successfully achieved by using electrohydrodynamically-printed microlattices with layer-specific orientations. This exploration offers a promising way to engineer complex 3D tissue constructs with predefined cellular alignments.

Electrical remodeling was observed with higher occurrence of AV block from neonatal and aged mutant mice as measured by surface electrocardiogram and atrio-ventricular Wenckebach point detection. Histological and molecular profiles revealed an increase in apoptotic cells and activation of caspase-3 activities in heart tissue. Upon aging, extracellular cellular matrix (ECM) remodeling appeared with accumulation of collagen in Lmna R225X mutant hearts as visualized by Masson's trichrome stain. This could be explained by the upregulated ECM gene expression, such as Fibronectin: Fn1, collagen: Col12a1, intergrin: Itgb2 and 3, as detected by microarray gene chip. Also, endurance exercise for 3 month improved the ventricular ejection fraction, attenuated fibrosis and cardiomyocytes apoptosis in the aged mutant mice.\nThe mechanism of LMNA nonsense mutation induced cardiac conduction defects through AV node fibrosis is due to upregulated ECM gene expression upon activation of cardiac apoptosis.

In this study, we found that miR-665 was enriched in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes, and then investigated the underlying role of nuclear miR-665 in heart failure. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization assays in human heart tissue sections and primary cardiomyocytes showed that miR-665 was localized in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes. Increased expression of nuclear miR-665 was observed not only in the cardiomyocytes isolated from the heart of mice treated in vivo by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), but also in phenylephrine (PE)-treated cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro. To further explore the role of miR-665 in heart failure, a type 9 recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) system was employed to manipulate the expression of miR-665 in mice. Overexpression of miR-665 aggravated TAC-induced cardiac dysfunction, while down-expression of miR-665 showed opposite effects. Bioinformatic prediction and biological validation confirmed that the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) gene was one of the targets of miR-665 in the nucleus.

Our results show that RSG treatment in ADM-administered animals significantly diminished low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and total cholesterol, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) in comparison with the ADM group. RSG treatment reduced the effect of ADM administration on cardiac dysfunction markers such as cardiac troponin T Creatine Kinase-MB, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase, showing the amelioration of cardio toxicity in ADM-administered rats. Additionally, RSG treatment significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide in cardiovascular tissue.

This study investigated an angiogenic poly(ethylene glycol) fibrin-based hydrogel reinforced with an electrospun biodegradable poly(ether ester urethane) urea (BPUR) mesh layer that was designed to encourage cell invasion, angiogenesis, and regenerative remodeling in the repair of an artificial defect created onto the rat right ventricle wall. Electrocardiogram signals were analyzed, heart function was measured, and fibrosis, macrophage infiltration, muscularization, vascularization, and defect size were evaluated at 4- and 8-weeks post-surgery. Compared with rats with fixed pericardium patches, rats with BPUR-reinforced hydrogel patches had fewer arrhythmias and greater right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output, as well as greater left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shorting, stroke work and cardiac output. Histology and immunofluorescence staining showed less fibrosis and less patch material remaining in rats with BPUR-reinforced hydrogel patches at 4- and 8-weeks. Rats with BPUR-reinforced hydrogel patches also had a greater volume of granular tissue, a greater volume of muscularized tissue, more blood vessels, and a greater number of leukocytes, pan-macrophages, and M2 macrophages at 8 weeks.

{"title": "Modular design of a tissue engineered pulsatile conduit using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Single ventricle heart defects (SVDs) are congenital disorders that result in a variety of complications, including increased ventricular mechanical strain and mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to heart failure without surgical intervention. Corrective surgery for SVDs are traditionally handled by the Fontan procedure, requiring a vascular conduit for completion. Although effective, current conduits are limited by their inability to aid in pumping blood into the pulmonary circulation. In this report, we propose an innovative and versatile design strategy for a tissue engineered pulsatile conduit (TEPC) to aid circulation through the pulmonary system by producing contractile force. Several design strategies were tested for production of a functional TEPC. Ultimately, we found that porcine extracellular matrix (ECM)-based engineered heart tissue (EHT) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and primary cardiac fibroblasts (HCF) wrapped around decellularized human umbilical artery (HUA) made an efficacious basal TEPC. Importantly, the TEPCs showed effective electrical and mechanical function. Initial pressure readings from our TEPC in vitro (0.68\u202fmmHg) displayed efficient electrical conductivity enabling them to follow electrical pacing up to a 2\u202fHz frequency. This work represents a proof of principle study for our current TEPC design strategy. Refinement and optimization of this promising TEPC design will lay the groundwork for testing the construct's therapeutic potential in the future. Together this work represents a progressive step toward developing an improved treatment for SVD patients.

In contrast to previous strategies for making a pulsatile Fontan conduit, we employ a modular design strategy that allows for the optimization of each component individually to make a standalone tissue.

Advances in lineage reprogramming have provided promising cellular sources for regenerative medicine in addition to research applications. Recently we have shown that adult mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to expandable, multipotent, induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs) by employing forced expression of five cardiac factors along with activation of canonical Wnt and JAK/STAT signaling. Here we aim to further characterize iCPCs by highlighting their safety, ease of attainability, and functionality within a three-dimensional cardiac extracellular matrix scaffold. Specifically, iCPCs did not form teratomas in contrast to embryonic stem cells when injected into immunodeficient mice. iCPC reprogramming was achieved in wild type mouse fibroblasts without requiring a cardiac-specific reporter, solely utilizing morphological changes to identify, clonally isolate, and expand iCPCs, thus increasing the versatility of this technology. iCPCs also show the ability to repopulate decellularized native heart scaffolds and differentiated into organized structures containing cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. Optical mapping of recellularized scaffolds shows field-stimulated calcium transients that propagate across islands of reconstituted tissue and bipolar local stimulation demonstrates cell-cell coupling within scaffolds. Overall, iCPCs provide a readily attainable, scalable, safe, and functional cell source for a variety of application including drug discovery, disease modeling, and regenerative therapy.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

The study aimed to evaluate the transcriptional levels of the natriuretic peptides (NP), endothelin (ET)-1, adrenomedullin (ADM), their receptors and long non-coding (Lnc) RNA MIAT, MALAT-1, CARMEN and XIST in rat cardiac tissue as cardiovascular biomarkers of aging. Three groups of male Wistar rats were studied: A (n\u202f=\u202f6; young), B (n\u202f=\u202f13; adult), C (n\u202f=\u202f10; old). Total RNA was extracted from left ventricle and analyzed by Real-Time PCR. Echocardiographic and histological analyses were performed. A significant increase of Atrial NP (ANP) and Brain NP (BNP) mRNA was observed in C while C-type NP (CNP) remained in a steady-state in B and C; ET-1 mRNA increased significantly as a function of age. Any difference was observed for NP receptors. ETA expression was statistically lower in B than A while ETB were similar in all the three groups. The ADM showed an opposite trend to that of the other peptides decreasing significantly as a function of age and presenting a counter-regulation of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP)-2. LncRNA transcripts decreased significantly as a function of age except for XIST.

{"title": "Homeobox gene Meis1 modulates cardiovascular regeneration.", "abstract": "Regeneration of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (three major lineages of cardiac tissues) following myocardial infarction is the critical step to recover the function of the damaged heart. Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Meis1) was first discovered in leukemic mice in 1995 and its biological function has been extensively studied in leukemia, hematopoiesis, the embryonic pattering of body axis, eye development and various genetic diseases, such as restless leg syndrome. It was found that Meis1 is highly associated with Hox genes and their cofactors to exert its regulatory effects on multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Recently with the advent of bioinformatics, biochemical methods and advanced genetic engineering tools, new function of Meis1 has been found to be involved in the cell cycle regulation of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. For example, inhibition of Meis1 expression increases the proliferative capacity of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes, whereas overexpression of Meis1 results in the reduction in the length of cardiomyocyte proliferative window. Interestingly, downregulation of one of the circular RNAs, which acts downstream of Meis1 in the cardiomyocytes, promotes angiogenesis and restores the myocardial blood supply, thus reinforcing better regeneration of the damaged heart. It appears that Meis1 may play double roles in modulating proliferation and regeneration of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells post-myocardial infarction. In this review, we propose to summarize the major findings of Meis1 in modulating fetal development and adult abnormalities, especially focusing on the recent discoveries of Meis1 in controlling the fate of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells.", "journal": "Seminars in cell & developmental biology", "date": "2019-10-19", "authors": ["SwagatikaPaul", "XiaonanZhang", "Jia-QiangHe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.10.003\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2007.06.023\n10.1172/JCI99659\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.08.127\n10.1161/JAHA.112.005652\n10.1038/nature12054\n10.1387/ijdb.072430nm\n10.1038/nrg1723\n10.1371/journal.pone.0058857\n10.1038/leu.2012.356\n10.3324/haematol.2010.027698\n10.1101/gad.1619407\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.01.004\n10.1182/blood-2012-05-432260\n10.3324/haematol.2017.177485\n10.1101/gad.1602107\n10.1182/blood-2002-08-2484\n10.1038/sj.onc.1204174\n10.1038/46580\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e318211c366\n10.1016/j.sleep.2016.08.002\n10.1242/dev.122176\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175489\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600038\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.029\n10.1093/nar/25.21.4173\n10.1007/s00239-006-0023-0\n10.1101/gad.1007602\n10.1002/dvdy.24016\n10.1242/dev.02298\n10.1074/jbc.273.14.7941\n10.1016/s0039-128x(96)00157-2\n10.1007/s11033-017-4126-z\n10.1038/ng0296-149\n10.1128/mcb.19.4.3051\n10.1182/blood-2004-12-4664\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302023\n10.1002/dvg.22833\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.07.011\n10.1002/jez.1402510210\n10.1067/mnc.2001.118924\n10.1038/sj.mn.7800173\n10.1038/74651\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.035\n10.1242/dmm.006791\n10.1186/gm299\n10.1002/wdev.312\n10.1038/nature12111\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.07.075\n10.1111/j.1439-0264.2008.00894.x\n10.1007/s10456-005-9016-7\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.02.011\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.12.017\n10.1242/jcs.00969\n10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.048\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038361\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1001304\n10.1136/jmg.2010.087858\n10.1101/gr.166751.113\n10.7554/eLife.11627\n10.3390/jdb4010001\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.07.004\n10.1096/fj.201801330RR\n10.1101/cshperspect.a013847\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.02.008\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.07.035\n10.1016/j.drudis.2014.12.018\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002279\n10.1007/s11033-018-4247-z\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.08.065\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.019357\n10.1002/iub.1456\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00959\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.08.030\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.09.106\n10.1073/pnas.1406508111\n10.1073/pnas.231115398"}

{"title": "Fiber Scaffold Patterning for Mending Hearts: 3D Organization Bringing the Next Step.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death worldwide. The most common conditions that lead to HF are coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, valve disorders, high blood pressure, and cardiomyopathy. Due to the limited regenerative capacity of the heart, the only curative therapy currently available is heart transplantation. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of novel regenerative strategies to repair the injured myocardium, replace damaged valves, and treat occluded coronary arteries. Recent advances in manufacturing technologies have resulted in the precise fabrication of 3D fiber scaffolds with high architectural control that can support and guide new tissue growth, opening exciting new avenues for repair of the human heart. This review discusses the recent advancements in the novel research field of fiber patterning manufacturing technologies for cardiac tissue engineering (cTE) and to what extent these technologies could meet the requirements of the highly organized and structured cardiac tissues. Additionally, future directions of these novel fiber patterning technologies, designs, and applicability to advance cTE are presented.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2019-10-12", "authors": ["MarleenKristen", "Madison JAinsworth", "NinoChirico", "Casper F Tvan der Ven", "Pieter ADoevendans", "Joost P GSluijter", "JosMalda", "Alainvan Mil", "MiguelCastilho"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201900775"}
{"title": "Chronic intermittent tachypacing by an optogenetic approach induces arrhythmia vulnerability in human engineered heart tissue.", "abstract": "Chronic tachypacing is commonly used in animals to induce cardiac dysfunction and to study mechanisms of heart failure and arrhythmogenesis. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) may replace animal models to overcome species differences and ethical problems. Here, 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) was used to investigate the effect of chronic tachypacing on hiPSC-cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).\nTo avoid cell toxicity by electrical pacing, we developed an optogenetic approach. EHTs were transduced with lentivirus expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (H134R) and stimulated by 15\u2009s bursts of blue light pulses (0.3\u2009mW/mm2, 30\u2009ms, 3\u2009Hz) separated by 15\u2009s without pacing for 3\u2009weeks. Chronic optical tachypacing did not affect contractile peak force, but induced faster contraction kinetics, shorter action potentials, and shorter effective refractory periods. This electrical remodelling increased vulnerability to tachycardia episodes upon electrical burst pacing. Lower calsequestrin 2 protein levels, faster diastolic depolarization (DD) and efficacy of JTV-519 (46% at 1\u2009\u00b5mol/L) to terminate tachycardia indicate alterations of Ca2+ handling being part of the underlying mechanism. However, other antiarrhythmic compounds like flecainide (69% at 1\u2009\u00b5mol/L) and E-4031 (100% at 1\u2009\u00b5mol/L) were also effective, but not ivabradine (1\u2009\u00b5mol/L) or SEA0400 (10\u2009\u00b5mol/L).\nWe demonstrated a high vulnerability to tachycardia of optically tachypaced hiPSC-CMs in EHT and the effective termination by ryanodine receptor stabilization, sodium or hERG potassium channel inhibition.

However, the pathophysiology of peripheral organs following polytrauma is poorly understood. Using a rat model of TBI combined with hypoxemia and hemorrhagic shock, we studied the status of peripheral redox systems, liver glycogen content, creatinine clearance, and systemic inflammation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to hypoxemia and hemorrhagic shock insults (HH), penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI) alone, or PBBI followed by hypoxemia and hemorrhagic shock (PHH). Sham rats received craniotomy only. Biofluids and liver, kidney, and heart tissues were collected at 1 day, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days post-injury (DPI). Creatinine levels were measured in both serum and urine. Glutathione levels, glycogen content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cytochrome C oxidase enzyme activities were quantified in the peripheral organs. Acute inflammation marker serum amyloid A-1 (SAA-1) level was quantified using western blot analysis. Urine to serum creatinine ratio in PHH group was significantly elevated on 7-28 DPI. Polytrauma induced a delayed disruption of the hepatic GSH/GSSG ratio, which resolved within 2 weeks post-injury. A modest decrease in kidney SOD activity was observed at 2 weeks after polytrauma. However, neither PBBI alone nor polytrauma changed the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase activity. Hepatic glycogen levels were reduced acutely following polytrauma.

Metabolic alterations induced by Amalaki rasayana intervention are unknown. We investigated the modulations in serum metabolomic profiles in Wistar rats following long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana. Global metabolic profiling was performed of the serum of rats administered with either Amalaki rasayana (AR) or ghee\u2009+\u2009honey (GH) for 18\u00a0months and control animals which were left untreated. Amalaki rasayana components were confirmed from AR extract using HR-LCMS analysis. Significant reductions in prostaglandin J2, 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, and higher levels of reduced glutathione and glycitein metabolites were observed in the serum of AR administered rats compared to the control groups. Eleven different metabolites classified as phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glucoside derivatives, organic acids, and glycosphingolipid were exclusively observed in the AR administered rats. Pathway analysis suggests that altered metabolites in AR administered rats are those associated with different biochemical pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, G-protein mediated events, phospholipid metabolism, and the immune system. Targeted metabolomics confirmed the presence of gallic acid, ellagic acid, and arachidonic acid components in the AR extract. The known activities of these components can be correlated with the altered metabolic profile following long-term AR administration.

The study was conducted on Sprague Dawley rats (n = 50), which were separated into five different groups as follows: control, met-150, SA, SA\u2009+\u2009met-100, and SA\u2009+\u2009met-150. The results demonstrated that SA caused a significant increase in the level of malondialdehyde and also reduced activities of antioxidative enzyme. SA similarly increased inflammatory reactions by increasing the level of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-1\u03b2. In addition, SA provoked the apoptosis by expanding the p53 and Bax levels, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, and expression of caspase-3. SA altered the histological integrity of cardiac tissue and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine expression.

This patch was then transplanted to cover infarcted myocardium. Non-absorbable poly(ethyl) acrylate polymer scaffolds were used as controls.\nFifteen sheep were followed with ultrasound scans at 6\u2009months, including echocardiography scans, tissue Doppler and spectral flow analysis and speckle-tracking imaging, which showed a reduction in longitudinal left ventricular deformation in the cardiopatch-treated group. Magnetic resonance imaging (late gadolinium enhancement) showed reduction of infarct size relative to left ventricular mass in the cardiopatch group versus the controls. Histopathological analysis at 6\u2009months showed that the cardiopatch was fully anchored and integrated to the infarct area with minimal fibrosis interface, thereby promoting angiogenesis and migration of adipose tissue-derived progenitor cells to surrounding tissues.\nThis study shows the feasibility and effectiveness of a cardiopatch grafted onto myocardial infarction scars in an experimental animal model.

To reduce this risk of radiation exposure, we are exploring the use of photoacoustic imaging paired with robotic visual servoing for cardiac catheter visualization and surgical guidance. A cardiac catheterization procedure was performed on two in vivo swine after inserting an optical fiber into the cardiac catheter to produce photoacoustic signals from the tip of the fiber-catheter pair. A combination of photoacoustic imaging and robotic visual servoing was employed to visualize and maintain constant sight of the catheter tip in order to guide the catheter through the femoral or jugular vein, toward the heart. Fluoroscopy provided initial ground truth estimates for 1D validation of the catheter tip positions, and these estimates were refined using a 3D electromagnetic-based cardiac mapping system as the ground truth. The 1D and 3D root mean square errors ranged 0.25-2.28 mm and 1.24-1.54 mm, respectively.

We investigated the possible protective effect of infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitor on DOX-induced nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated with a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of DOX (17.5\u00a0mg/kg) in the absence or presence of infliximab (5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). Plasma and urinary markers of kidney function, oxidative stress, and inflammation were measured. Kidney and heart tissue was evaluated histopathologically. DOX-induced nephrotoxicity was confirmed by increased plasma urea, creatinine, cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and clusterin concentrations. In addition, DOX increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity, kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) concentrations, and reduced creatinine clearance. DOX significantly reduced renal antioxidants and increased plasma inflammatory markers and adiponectin concentrations. Concomitant treatment with infliximab did not significantly affect DOX-induced changes in plasma creatinine, cystatin C, or creatinine clearance. However, infliximab significantly reduced DOX-induced action on plasma urea, NGAL, clusterin, and adiponectin. Infliximab also significantly reduced urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, NAG activity, and KIM-1 concentrations, as well as the occurrence of fibrotic lesions in kidney tissue.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of high-resolution (<1\u2009mm) ultrasound thermal imaging to monitor spatial temperature distribution during laser ablation on ex vivo cardiac tissue.\nLaser ablation (808\u2009nm) was performed on five porcine cardiac tissue samples. A thermocouple was used to measure the interstitial tissue temperature during the laser ablation process. Tissue-strain-based ultrasound thermal imaging was conducted to monitor the spatial distribution of the temperature in the cardiac tissue. The tissue temperature was estimated from the time shifts of ultrasound signals owing to the changes in the speed of sound and was compared with the measured temperature. The temperature estimation coefficient k of porcine cardiac tissue was calculated from the estimated thermal strain and the measured temperature. The degree of tissue coagulation (temperatures\u2009>\u200950\u00b0C) was derived from the estimated temperature and was compared with that of the tested cardiac tissue.\nThe estimated tissue temperature using strain-based ultrasound thermal imaging at a depth of 1\u2009mm agreed with thermocouple measurements. During the 30-second period of the laser ablation process, the estimated tissue temperature increased from 25 to 70\u00b0C at a depth of 0.1\u2009mm, while the estimated temperature at a depth of 1\u2009mm increased up to 46\u00b0C. Owing to the uncertainty of the coefficient k, the k value of the porcine cardiac tissue varied from 160 to 220\u00b0C with temperature changes of up to 20\u00b0C. The estimated coagulation region in the ultrasound thermal imaging was 20% wider (+0.6\u2009mm) but 9% shallower (-0.1\u2009mm) than the measured region of the ablated porcine cardiac tissue.\nThe current study demonstrated the feasibility of temperature monitoring with the use of ultrasound thermal imaging during the laser ablation on ex vivo porcine cardiac tissue. The high-resolution ultrasound thermal imaging could map the spatial distribution of the tissue temperature.

Recently, a category of VSDs has emerged which records membrane potentials by photo-induced electron transfer. FluoVolt is a novel VSD in this category which promises fast response and a 25% fractional change in fluorescence per 100\u202fmV, making it an attractive optical probe for action potential (AP) recordings within intact cardiac tissue. The purpose of this study was to characterize the fluorescent properties of FluoVolt as well as its utility for deep tissue imaging.\nDiscrete tissue layers throughout the left ventricular wall of isolated perfused murine hearts loaded with FluoVolt or di-4-ANEPPS were sequentially excited with two-photon microscopy.\nFluoVolt loaded hearts suffered significantly fewer episodes of atrio-ventricular block compared to di-4-ANEPPS loaded hearts, indicating comparatively low toxicity of FluoVolt in the intact heart. APs recorded with FluoVolt were characterized by a lower signal-to-noise ratio and a higher dynamic range compared to APs recorded with di-4-ANEPPS. Although both depolarization and repolarization parameters were similar in APs recorded with either dye, FluoVolt allowed deeper tissue excitation with improved three-dimensional resolution due to reduced out-of-focus fluorescence generation under two-photon excitation.\nOur results demonstrate several advantages of two-photon excitation of FluoVolt in functional studies in intact heart preparations, including reduced toxicity and improved fluorescent properties.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2019-09-08", "authors": ["SimonaSalerno", "KarinGarten", "Godfrey LSmith", "TomasSt\u00f8len", "AllenKelly"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2019.08.007"}

To date, little work has been conducted to show the extent of tissue specificity of lipid compositions. Here, the recently acquired Lipidyzer platform was employed in this pilot study: (i) to assess the performance of the Lipidyzer platform, (ii) to explore lipid profiles in liver and cardiac tissue in mice, (iii) to examine sex-specific differences in lipids in the liver tissue, and (iv) to evaluate biological variances in lipidomes present in animals. In total, 787 lipid species from 13 lipid classes were measured in the liver and heart. Lipidomics data from the Lipidyzer platform were very reproducible with the coefficient of variations of the quality control (QC) samples, \u223c10%. The total concentration of the cholesterol esters (CE) lipid class, and specifically CE(16:1) and CE(18:1) species, showed sex differences in the liver. Cardiac tissue had higher levels of phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic acid, which could be related to heart health status and function.

Impairment of HSPs is associated with aging-related neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) is a compound well known to increase HSPs through activation of heat shock factor-1 (HSF1). GGA increases HSPs in various tissues, but whether GGA can increase HSP expression in human heart tissue is unknown.\nThe purpose of this study was to test whether oral GGA treatment increases HSP expression in the atrial appendages of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nHSPB1, HSPA1, HSPD1, HSPA5, HSF1, and phosphorylated HSF1 levels were measured by western blot analysis in right and left atrial appendages (RAAs and LAAs, respectively) collected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who were treated with placebo (n = 13) or GGA 400 mg/da(n\u00a0=\u00a013) 3 days before surgery. Myofilament fractions were isolated from LAAs to determine the levels of HSPB1 and HSPA1 present in these fractions.\nGGA treatment significantly increased HSPB1 and HSPA1 expression levels in RAA and LAA compared to the placebo group, whereas HSF1, phosphorylated HSF1, HSPD1, and HSPA5 were unchanged. In addition, GGA treatment significantly enhanced HSPB1 levels at the myofilaments compared to placebo.\nThree days of GGA treatment is associated with higher HSPB1 and HSPA1 expression levels in RAA and LAA of patients undergoing CABG surgery and higher HSPB1 levels at the myofilaments. These findings pave the way to study the role of GGA as a protective compound against other cardiac diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2019-07-16", "authors": ["Denise M Svan Marion", "LarissaDorsch", "FemkeHoogstra-Berends", "TeaKakuchaya", "LeoBockeria", "Natasja M Sde Groot", "Bianca J J MBrundel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2019.07.010"}

{"title": "Oleic Acid Prevents Isoprenaline-Induced Cardiac Injury: Effects on Cellular Oxidative Stress, Inflammation and Histopathological Alterations.", "abstract": "The present study was designed to assess the cardio-protective role of oleic acid in myocardial injury (MI) induced by intra-peritoneal injection of isoprenaline (ISO) in rats for 2 consecutive days. Oleic acid (OA) was administered orally (@ 5\u00a0mg/kg b.wt and 10\u00a0mg/kg b.wt) for 21\u00a0days before inducing MI. Pre-exposure to OA at higher dose significantly improved the HW/BW ratio, myocardial infarct size, lipid profiles (total cholesterol, HDL-C) and cardiac injury biomarkers (LDH, CK-MB, cardiac troponin-I, MMP-9), thus suggesting its cardio-protective role. The ameliorative potential of the higher dose of OA was further substantiated by its ability to reduce the cardiac oxidative stress as evidenced by significant decrease in lipid peroxidation coupled with increase in superoxide dismutase activity and reduced glutathione level. Significant decrease in heart rate as well as increase in RR and QT intervals in oleic acid pre-exposed rats were also observed. OA pre-treatment also reduced the histopathological alterations seen in myocardial injury group rats. The mRNA expression of cardiac UCP-2 gene, a regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, was significantly increased in oleic acid pre-exposure group compared to the ISO-induced myocardial injury group. Thus increase in expression of UCP-2 gene in cardiac tissue seems to be one of the protective measures against myocardial injury. Based on the above findings, it may be inferred that oleic acid possesses promising cardio-protective potential against myocardial injury due to its anti-oxidative property and ability to modulate cardiac metabolic processes.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2019-06-04", "authors": ["Pawan KumarSingh", "ManjuGari", "SoumenChoudhury", "AmitShukla", "NeerajGangwar", "Satish KumarGarg"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-019-09531-y"}

To better understand the role of dystrophin in cardiomyocyte development and the earliest phase of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy, we studied human cardiomyocytes differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) obtained from the urine of a DMD patient.\nThe contractile properties of patient-specific hiPSC-CMs, with no detectable dystrophin (DMD-CMs with a deletion of exon 50), were compared to CMs containing a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of a single G base at position 263 of the dystrophin gene (c.263delG-CMs) isogenic to the parental line of hiPSC-CMs from a healthy individual. We hypothesized that the absence of a dystrophin-actin linkage would adversely affect myofibril and cardiomyocyte structure and function. Cardiomyocyte maturation was driven by culturing long-term (80-100\u2009days) on a nanopatterned surface, which resulted in hiPSC-CMs with adult-like dimensions and aligned myofibrils.\nOur data demonstrate that lack of Dp427 results in reduced myofibril contractile tension, slower relaxation kinetics, and to Ca2+ handling abnormalities, similar to DMD cells, suggesting either retarded or altered maturation of cardiomyocyte structures associated with these functions.

Extensive evidence indicates that various toxic environmental factors and unhealthy lifestyle choices contribute to the risk, incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases. Alterations in the genetic level of myocardium affects normal heart development and initiates pathological processes leading to various types of cardiac diseases. Homeobox genes are a large and highly specialized family of closely related genes that direct the formation of body structure, including cardiac development. Homeobox genes encode homeodomain proteins that function as transcription factors with characteristic structures that allow them to bind to DNA, regulate gene expression and subsequently control the proper physiological function of cells, tissues and organs. Mutations in homeobox genes are rare and usually lethal with evident alterations in cardiac function at or soon after the birth. Our understanding of homeobox gene family expression and function has expanded significantly during the recent years. However, the involvement of homeobox genes in the development of human and animal cardiac tissue requires further investigation. The phenotype of human congenital heart defects unveils only some aspects of human heart development.

We have combined zebrafish embryo-based screens with cardiomyogenesis assays to discover selective small molecules that modulate heart development and regeneration with minimal adverse effects. Two related compounds with novel structures, named as Cardiomogen 1 and 2 (CDMG1 and CDMG2), were identified for their capacity to promote myocardial hyperplasia through expansion of the cardiac progenitor cell population. We find that Cardiomogen acts as a Wnt inhibitor by targeting \u03b2-catenin and reducing Tcf/Lef-mediated transcription in cultured cells. CDMG treatment of amputated zebrafish hearts reduces nuclear \u03b2-catenin in injured heart tissue, increases cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation, and expedites wound healing, thus accelerating cardiac muscle regeneration. Importantly, Cardiomogen can alleviate the functional deterioration of mammalian hearts after myocardial infarction. Injured hearts exposed to CDMG1 display increased newly formed CMs and reduced fibrotic scar tissue, which are in part attributable to the \u03b2-catenin reduction.

{"title": "Modelling sarcomeric cardiomyopathies with human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a unique opportunity to understand the pathophysiological effects of genetic cardiomyopathy mutations. In particular, these cells hold the potential to unmask the effects of mutations on contractile behaviour in vitro, providing new insights into genotype-phenotype relationships. With this goal in mind, several groups have established iPSC lines that contain sarcomeric gene mutations linked to cardiomyopathy in patient populations. Their studies have employed diverse systems and methods for performing mechanical measurements of contractility, ranging from single cell techniques to multicellular tissue-like constructs. Here, we review published results to date within the growing field of iPSC-based sarcomeric cardiomyopathy disease models. We devote special attention to the methods of mechanical characterization selected in each case, and how these relate to the paradigms of classical muscle mechanics. An appreciation of these somewhat subtle paradigms can inform efforts to compare the results of different studies and possibly reconcile discrepancies. Although more work remains to be done to improve and possibly standardize methods for producing, maturing, and mechanically interrogating iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, the initial results indicate that this approach to modelling cardiomyopathies will continue to provide critical insights into these devastating diseases.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2019-01-10", "authors": ["Lorenzo RSewanan", "Stuart GCampbell"], "doi": "10.1113/JP276753"}

Two groups are constituted, standard diet (SD) group fed a standard diet and CD group fed a combined diet (standard\u2009+\u2009cholesterol 1%-methionine 0.25%). The diet is administered during 80 days. The results show changes in serum and cardiac parameters of CD newborn, with the involvement of phospholipids (PLs) (phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), variations in malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated diene (CD), and vitamin C [VIT-C] rates). Under the CD effect, serum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, pro-MMP-9, and MMP-9 activities change. As to cardiac MMP-2 activity, a rise is noticed in the second pregnancy. Histological analysis reveals constricted blood capillaries, collagen fibre deposits, and lipid accumulation in the CD newborn heart. Our study shows the amplified effect of the maternal cholesterol-methionine diet in the second pregnancy on newborn cardiac disorders (matrix remodelling, oxidative stress, and lipid accumulation).", "journal": "Archives of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2018-07-24", "authors": ["SarahAit-Benali", "KhiraOthmani-Mecif", "YasminaBenazzoug"], "doi": "10.1080/13813455.2018.1489848"}
