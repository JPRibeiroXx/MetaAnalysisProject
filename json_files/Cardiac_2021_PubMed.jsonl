Therefore, computational studies are limited to groups with access to computer clusters and personnel with high-performance computing experience. We present how to use and implement WebGL programs via a custom-written library to run and visualize simulations of the most complex ionic models in 2D and 3D, in real time, interactively using the multi-core GPU of a single computer.\nWe use Abubu.js, a library we developed for solving partial differential equations such as those describing crystal growth and fluid flow, along with a newly implemented visualization algorithm, to simulate complex ionic cell models. By combining this library with JavaScript, we allow direct real-time interactions with simulations. We implemented: 1) modification of any model parameters and equations at any time, with direct access to the code while it runs, 2) electrode stimulation anywhere in the 2D/3D tissue with a mouse click, 3) saving the solution of the system at any time to re-initiate the dynamics from saved initial conditions, and 4) rotation/visualization of 3D structures at any angle.\nAs examples of this modeling platform, we implemented a phenomenological cell model and the human ventricular OVVR model (41 variables). In 2D we illustrate the dynamics in an annulus, disk, and square tissue; in 2D and 3D porcine ventricles, we show the initiation of functional/anatomical reentry, spiral wave dynamics in different regimes, initiation of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), and the effects of model parameter variations in real time.\nWe present the first simulations of complex models in anatomical structures with enhanced visualization and extended interactivity that run on a single PC, without software downloads, and as fast as in real-time even for 3D full ventricles.", "journal": "Computing in cardiology", "date": "2022-06-28", "authors": ["AbouzarKaboudian", "Elizabeth MCherry", "Flavio HFenton"], "doi": "10.23919/cinc53138.2021.9662759"}

Although the current CIEDs are evolving quickly in terms of performance, safety, and miniaturization, the bulky and rigid battery creates the largest hurdle toward further development of a soft system that can be attached and conform to tissues without causing undesirable physiologic changes. Over 50% of patients with pacemakers require additional surgery procedures to replace a drained battery. Abrupt battery malfunction and failure contributes up to 2.4% of implanted leadless pacemakers. The battery also has risks of lethal interference with diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Applying the implantable nanogenerators (i-NGs) technology to CIEDs is regarded as a promising solution to the battery challenge and enables self-powering capability. I-NGs based on the principle of either triboelectricity (TENG) or piezoelectricity (PENG) can convert biomechanical energy into electricity effectively.

However, most of the currently available patches are made of inert materials with unmatched electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, which may lead to an increased risk for arrhythmia and heart failure. In this study, we have developed a novel Polyurethane/Small intestinal submucosa patch (PSP) with mechanical and electrical properties similar to those of the native myocardial tissue, and assessed its feasibility for the reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract. A right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction model was constructed in 40 rabbits. Compared with commercially available bovine pericardium patch, the PSP patch has shown better histocompatibility and biodegradability, in addition with significantly improved cardiac function. To tackle the significant fibrosis and relatively poor vascularization during tissue remodeling, we have further developed a bioactive patch by incorporating the PSP composites with urine-derived stem cells (USCs) which were pretreated with hypoxia. The results showed that the hypoxia-pretreated bioactive patch could significantly inhibit fibrosis and promote vascularization and muscularization, resulting in better right heart function.

Gene expressions of Va14Ja18 were analyzed. Then, the experiment was performed in five groups: MI+Me, MI+MSCs, MI+MSCs+indome, MI+a-GC and MI+MSCs+a-GC. After 28 days, heart tissue fibrosis was accessed by Masson trichrome dyeing and apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining and western blotting for caspase-3 protein.\nThe number of iNKT cells infiltrating into the PLV significantly increased at day 7 after MI (1.72-fold changes from baseline, P<0.05), but almost returned to the baseline level at days 14 and 28. Compared to the MI+Me group (1.76\u00b10.20-fold), iNKT cell infiltration was significantly suppressed at day 7 in MI+MSCs (1.25\u00b10.29-fold, P<0.05) and MI+cMe groups (1.19\u00b10.25-fold, P<0.05). In MI+cMe+indome and MI+cMe+PGE2 groups, the changes of iNKT cell infiltration were 1.74- and 1.04-fold, respectively (vs. 1.20-fold in the MI+cMe group, P<0.05). After the treatment by the combination of MSC transplantation and iNKT cell activation, myocyte apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis in PLV were both significantly attenuated.\nIn the infarcted mouse model, MSCs suppressed the infiltration of iNKT cells by secreting PGE2. Activating iNKT cells could assist the therapeutic effect of MSCs on ventricular remodeling, with attenuated apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis. Therapies designed to activate iNKT cells before MSC transplantation might be beneficial to enhance the effectiveness of MSCs in the post-MI heart.

In this regard, virtual screening procedure, using molecular docking of 9127 FDA and world approved drugs, including herbal medicine, was done over the crystal structures of tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) and tankyrase 2 (TNKS2) catalytic poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) domains with PDB ID: 2RF5 and 3KR7, respectively, to find potential small molecule inhibitors to regenerate injured heart tissue. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations were done to assess the stability of selected ligands phenothrin and ethyl rosinate in the binding pocket of TNKS1 and TNKS2 for 100 ns, respectively. Both compounds show suitable interaction in their binding pocket. The molecular dynamics simulation results confirm their stability. The binding free energy of complexes was carried out by the MM-PBSA method. ADME properties also indicate the potential of drug-likeness of both compounds.

{"title": "Unique Angiogenesis From Cardiac Arterioles During Pericardial Adhesion Formation.", "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying post-operative pericardial adhesions remain poorly understood. We aimed to unveil the temporal molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying tissue dynamics during adhesion formation, including inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis.\nWe visualized cell-based tissue dynamics during pericardial adhesion using histological evaluations. To determine the molecular mechanism, RNA-seq was performed. Chemical inhibitors were administered to confirm the molecular mechanism underlying adhesion formation. A high degree of adhesion formation was observed during the stages in which collagen production was promoted. Histological analyses showed that arterioles excessively sprouted from pericardial tissues after the accumulation of neutrophils on the heart surface in mice as well as humans. The combination of RNA-seq and histological analyses revealed that hyperproliferative endothelial and smooth muscle cells with dedifferentiation appeared in cytokine-exposed sprouting vessels and adhesion tissue but not in quiescent vessels in the heart. SMAD2/3 and ERK activation was observed in sprouting vessels. The simultaneous abrogation of PI3K/ERK or TGF-\u03b2/MMP9 signaling significantly decreased angiogenic sprouting, followed by inhibition of adhesion formation. Depleting MMP9-positive neutrophils shortened mice survival and decreased angiogenic sprouting and fibrosis in the adhesion. Our data suggest that TGF-\u03b2/matrix metalloproteinase-dependent tissue remodeling and PI3K/ERK signaling activation might contribute to unique angiogenesis with dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells from the contractile to the synthetic phenotype for fibrosis in the pericardial cavity.\nOur findings provide new insights in developing prevention strategies for pericardial adhesions by targeting the recruitment of vascular cells from heart tissues.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2022-02-22", "authors": ["KenjiNamiguchi", "TomohisaSakaue", "MikioOkazaki", "KahoKanno", "YuheiKomoda", "FumiakiShikata", "MieKurata", "NoritakaOta", "YoshiakiKubota", "HirotsuguKurobe", "TakashiNishimura", "JunyaMasumoto", "ShigekiHigashiyama", "HironoriIzutani"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2021.761591\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.02.071\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.08.060\n10.3390/ijms21228610\n10.1016/S1357-2725(03)00242-5\n10.1038/s41467-020-16893-3\n10.1016/0003-4975(94)92224-1\n10.1002/aja.1001800408\n10.1016/0002-9149(80)90424-5\n10.1056/NEJM199512283332608\n10.1167/iovs.10-5176\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.025\n10.1093/jb/mvx051\n10.1242/dev.093351\n10.1080/110241599750007810\n10.1152/ajprenal.00300.2002\n10.3390/ijms21124271\n10.1007/PL00001993\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.11.075\n10.1186/s13019-019-0940-9\n10.1186/s12964-020-00678-8\n10.1038/s41467-020-18125-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011429\n10.1038/35036374\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.11.020\n10.4330/wjc.v10.i9.87\n10.1111/jcmm.13511\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa012\n10.1038/s41569-019-0227-9\n10.3390/ijms21134688\n10.1016/j.jvs.2007.03.001\n10.1016/j.pupt.2012.08.005\n10.1097/MOL.0000000000000113\n10.1038/srep33407\n10.1073/pnas.0601807103\n10.1073/pnas.0712185105\n10.1152/ajplung.00015.2014\n10.1093/ndt/gfv321\n10.1007/s11010-014-2151-y\n10.1016/j.biocel.2015.10.015\n10.4196/kjpp.2015.19.6.499\n10.1074/jbc.M703125200\n10.1096/fj.201802811R\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000096482.02567.8C\n10.3892/ijmm.11.2.229\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.04.115\n10.1074/jbc.M008570200"}

In the present study, we have created hiPSC-derived cardiac organoids (hiPSC-COs) comprised of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human fibroblasts. To produce a beating conduit for patients suffering from congenital heart diseases, we constructed scaffold-free tubular EHTs (T-EHTs) using hiPSC-COs and bio-3D printing with needle arrays. The bio-3D printed T-EHTs were cut open and transplanted around the abdominal aorta as well as the inferior vena cava (IVC) of NOG mice. The transplanted T-EHTs were covered with the omentum, and the abdomen was closed after completion of the procedure. Additionally, to compare the functionality of hiPSC-COs with that of T-EHTs, we transplanted the former around the aorta and IVC as well as injecting them into the subcutaneous tissue on the back of the mice. After 1 m of the transplantation procedures, we observed the beating of the T-EHTs in the mice. In histological analysis, the T-EHTs showed clear striation of the myocardium and vascularization compared to hiPSC-COs transplanted around the aorta or in subcutaneous tissue.

{"title": "Serial estimation of gene expression of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and autophagy gene HMGB1 to determine postmortem interval.", "abstract": "The estimation of accurate post mortem interval (PMI) is a crucial question in forensic medicine. Several approaches have been used to determine the PMI including physical, metabolic, autolytic, entomological, physiochemical and biochemical methods over time. For estimation of PMI, RNA degradation after death is reported to be an important tool. This study aimed to analyse the pattern of gene expression by serial estimation of cardiac specific cardiac troponin I (cTnI) gene and autophagy gene HMGB1 for determining PMI at room temperature by using housekeeping gene GAPDH. Right ventricular heart tissue weighing 10\u00a0g was collected and harvested from 17 medico-legal autopsies. The tissue was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice. Further, homogenate of cardiac tissue was analysed by quantitative Real time polymerase chain reaction (qRtPCR) for gene amplification and gene expression of cTnI, HMGB1 gene and GAPDH, at different time intervals (0,6,12\u00a0h) at room temperature. The result revealed \u2206Ct value of cTnI gene of the cardiac muscle showing almost equal degradation at equal time interval correlated with PMI within 0-12\u00a0h at room temperature, and the \u2206Ct value of HMGB1 degraded to half in every subsequent 6-hour interval at room temperature. In conclusion, the estimation of PMI by analysis of serial estimation of gene expression is a decent new tool in forensic medicine. The study shows an equal degradation of cTnI gene at equal time interval and HMGB1 degrades to half at six-hour interval. Therefore, these can be useful for estimation for PMI.", "journal": "Forensic science international.

Due to the particularity of the heart tissue, patients who experience ischemic infarction of the heart, still suffered irreversible damage to the heart even if the vascular reflow by treatment, and severe ones can lead to heart failure or even death. In recent years, several studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs), playing a regulatory role in damaged hearts, bring light for patients to alleviate MI.

Materials and methods Patients who died of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-proven COVID-19 were included in this postmortem case series. Postmortem percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsies of the lungs, heart, liver, and spleen were performed using 14- and 16-gauge needles. Biopsy samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined under a light microscope. Clinicodemographic characteristics, chest computed tomography (CT) images, and COVID-19-related treatments of the patients were also collected. Results Seven patients were included in this study. Liver and heart tissue samples were available from all patients, and lung and spleen tissue samples were available from five and three patients, respectively. Chest CT images predominantly revealed bibasilar ground-glass opacities. Lung biopsies showed diffuse alveolar damage in all biopsy specimens. Heart findings were nonspecific and largely compatible with the underlying disease. Patchy necrosis, steatosis, and mononuclear cell infiltration were the main findings in the liver biopsies. Splenic histopathological examination showed that splenic necrosis and neutrophil infiltration were common findings in all patients. Conclusion Tissue acquisition was complete for the heart and liver and acceptable for the lungs. The amount of tissue was sufficient for a proper histopathologic examination. Histopathological findings were generally in accordance with previous autopsy studies. Radiological findings of the lung were also correlated with the histopathologic findings.

{"title": "Identifying the cardioprotective mechanism of Danyu Tongmai Granules against myocardial infarction by targeted metabolomics combined with network pharmacology.", "abstract": "Danyu Tongmai Granules (DY), the commercial Chinese medicine, was well-accepted cardiovascular protective actions in clinic. However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of DY on cardiovascular disease still need largely to be clarified.\nTherefore, this study was designed to explore potential mechanisms of DY in myocardial infarction (MI) by integrated strategy of metabolomics and network pharmacology.\nCardiomyocytes were subjected to H\nWe found that DY exerted significant cardioprotective effects in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorated inflammatory cell infiltration and cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by ISO. The metabolomics data suggested that DY mainly affected the amino acid metabolism (i.e., valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, glycine, serine, as well as the alanine metabolism, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, etc.). Simultaneously, DY participated in the regulation of the biosynthesis of bile acids and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Notably, DY significantly reduced the biosynthesis of valine, leucine and isoleucine to regulating the metabolism of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in infarcted myocardium, thus blocking the inflammation via inhibiting the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in ISO-induced rats. The anti-inflammatory system of DY was further validated with the results of network pharmacology.\nOur study, for the first time, confirmed that DY inhibited inflammation and further exerted significant anti-myocardial infarction effect. Additionally, our work further demonstrated that the myocardial protective effect of DY was contributed to the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating BCAAs in infarcted myocardium using the comprehensive metabolomics, molecular biology and network analysis. Overall, our study gained new insights into the role of the relationship between the metabolic regulation of BCAAs and the NLRP3 inflammasome against MI.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2022-02-02", "authors": ["JingCui", "YangyangShi", "XueliXu", "FeiZhao", "JiZhang", "BoWei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153829"}
{"title": "Learning atrial fiber orientations and conductivity tensors from intracardiac maps using physics-informed neural networks.", "abstract": "Electroanatomical maps are a key tool in the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation. Current approaches focus on the activation times recorded. However, more information can be extracted from the available data. The fibers in cardiac tissue conduct the electrical wave faster, and their direction could be inferred from activation times. In this work, we employ a recently developed approach, called physics informed neural networks, to learn the fiber orientations from electroanatomical maps, taking into account the physics of the electrical wave propagation. In particular, we train the neural network to weakly satisfy the anisotropic eikonal equation and to predict the measured activation times. We use a local basis for the anisotropic conductivity tensor, which encodes the fiber orientation. The methodology is tested both in a synthetic example and for patient data. Our approach shows good agreement in both cases and it outperforms a state of the art method in the patient data.

{"title": "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Immunomodulation: A Novel Intervention Mechanism in Cardiovascular Disease.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the member of multipotency stem cells, which possess the capacity for self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation, and have several characteristics, including multi-lineage differentiation potential and immune regulation, which make them a promising source for cell therapy in inflammation, immune diseases, and organ transplantation. In recent years, MSCs have been described as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases because they are potent modulators of immune system with the ability to modulating immune cell subsets, coordinating local and systemic innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby enabling the formation of a stable inflammatory microenvironment in damaged cardiac tissues. In this review, the immunoregulatory characteristics and potential mechanisms of MSCs are sorted out, the effect of these MSCs on immune cells is emphasized, and finally the application of this mechanism in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is described to provide help for clinical application.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2022-02-01", "authors": ["YueyaoWang", "ZhongwenQi", "ZhipengYan", "NanJi", "XiaoyaYang", "DongjieGao", "LeileiHu", "HaoLv", "JunpingZhang", "MengLi"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2021.742088\n10.1177/1074248412453875\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.02795\n10.3390/ijms21228874\n10.1016/j.exphem.2009.01.005\n10.1161/circresaha.117.310712\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.064\n10.1016/j.coi.2014.04.006\n10.1161/circresaha.116.309717\n10.1111/imr.12619\n10.3390/biomedicines9070824\n10.7150/thno.32260\n10.1186/s13287-019-1392-9\n10.1002/jbm.a.31614\n10.1038/emm.2013.135\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2018.02.013\n10.1016/s0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1002/stem.2104\n10.1056/NEJMra0800028\n10.1186/s13287-016-0353-9\n10.1155/2014/683230\n10.1007/s00395-011-0221-9\n10.1038/srep24120\n10.3727/096368910x\n10.1186/s13287-021-02244-6\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.02.015\n10.1186/s13287-019-1189-x\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2021.04.018\n10.1002/ijc.30265\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.01.047\n10.3390/pharmaceutics12060577\n10.1002/stem.656\n10.1016/j.bj.2017.01.003\n10.1038/ni.2001\n10.3390/cells8050467\n10.3390/cells8121605\n10.1155/2013/406871\n10.1172/jci129338\n10.1080/10410236.2021.1978668\n10.1186/s13287-019-1353-3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.10.050\n10.1111/ajt.15347\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.03.590\n10.1186/s12967-019-1999-8\n10.1186/s13287-020-01633-7\n10.5009/gnl18072\n10.1161/circresaha.116.309819\n10.1038/s41590-018-0113-3\n10.1016/j.immuni.2018.01.007\n10.1002/sctm.20-0289\n10.1093/hmg/dds317\n10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.07.006\n10.1002/hep.30700\n10.3389/fcvm.2017.00032\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0020\n10.1517/14712598.2015.1051528\n10.1186/s13287-019-1183-3\n10.1126/science.aau2909\n10.1186/s13287-019-1447-y\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173049\n10.1002/jlb.1ri0418-152rr\n10.1371/journal.pone.0219946\n10.3389/fchem.2021.699802\n10.1161/circresaha.117.310599\n10.1161/circresaha.116.310374\n10.7150/thno.32637\n10.1093/abbs/gmab102\n10.26355/eurrev_201805_15073\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01156\n10.1186/s13287-017-0659-2\n10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-074934\n10.3390/cancers12020440\n10.1002/jcp.25919\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.02.026\n10.1038/nrc.2015.5\n10.1111/ped.14001\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.06.020\n10.1536/ihj.48.649\n10.1189/jlb.1RU0814-382\n10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155367\n10.2174/156652412800619950\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0001\n10.3727/096368915x689758\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.06.020\n10.1155/2021/8888575\n10.1089/scd.2012.0255\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.04.005\n10.1159/000430338\n10.1016/j.clinre.2014.06.001\n10.1111/j.1365-3083.2007.01905.x\n10.1021/acsnano.9b01004\n10.1038/nri2711\n10.3390/jcm9010241\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106212\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.120673\n10.1186/s13287-021-02440-4\n10.3892/mmr.2017.8075\n10.1038/s41581-018-0023-5\n10.1161/jaha.117.006949\n10.1038/onc.2016.128\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01449\n10.1155/2017/3282656\n10.1182/blood-2009-02-203943\n10.1182/blood-2007-02-074997\n10.1182/blood-2005-07-2775\n10.1186/s13287-016-0363-7\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.012\n10.1093/cvr/cvy271\n10.1101/cshperspect.a016295\n10.1186/s41232-021-00178-3\n10.1038/nri2395\n10.1371/journal.pone.0227283\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq467\n10.1179/102453311x13085644679944\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.08.095\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136026\n10.1007/s11684-018-0627-y\n10.1002/stem.2242\n10.1007/s12016-016-8531-1\n10.1007/s13238-018-0549-0\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116632\n10.1016/j.immuni.2019.01.020\n10.1038/nature12034\n10.1111/jcmm.14635\n10.1177/0963689718780304\n10.1002/sctm.20-0186\n10.1038/s41598-020-58126-z\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120168\n10.1002/jcp.26436\n10.1016/j.coi.2011.12.007\n10.1155/2017/3248605\n10.1161/jaha.119.014397\n10.1093/cvr/cvz040\n10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjz200"}

{"title": "Deriving the Bidomain Model of Cardiac Electrophysiology From a Cell-Based Model; Properties and Comparisons.", "abstract": "The bidomain model is considered to be the gold standard for numerical simulation of the electrophysiology of cardiac tissue. The model provides important insights into the conduction properties of the electrochemical wave traversing the cardiac muscle in every heartbeat. However, in normal resolution, the model represents the average over a large number of cardiomyocytes, and more accurate models based on representations of all individual cells have therefore been introduced in order to gain insight into the conduction properties close to the myocytes. The more accurate model considered here is referred to as the EMI model since both the extracellular space (E), the cell membrane (M) and the intracellular space (I) are explicitly represented in the model. Here, we show that the bidomain model can be derived from the cell-based EMI model and we thus reveal the close relation between the two models, and obtain an indication of the error introduced in the approximation. Also, we present numerical simulations comparing the results of the two models and thereby highlight both similarities and differences between the models. We observe that the deviations between the solutions of the models become larger for larger cell sizes. Furthermore, we observe that the bidomain model provides solutions that are very similar to the EMI model when conductive properties of the tissue are in the normal range, but large deviations are present when the resistance between cardiomyocytes is increased.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2022-01-25", "authors": ["Karoline HorgmoJ\u00e6ger", "AslakTveito"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.811029\n10.1016/j.mbs.2021.108567\n10.1016/j.camwa.2020.06.009\n10.1007/s11538-013-9927-1\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.07.004\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2310515\n10.1152/ajpheart.00385.2013\n10.3389/fphys.2021.763584\n10.1101/2021.09.24.461636\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007042\n10.3389/fphy.2020.579461\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.026\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.11.1117\n10.1098/rsta.2008.0306\n10.3389/fphys.2011.00014\n10.1098/rsta.2011.0139\n10.1016/j.physrep.2014.05.002\n10.1017/S0962492917000046\n10.1529/biophysj.108.137349\n10.1007/BF02368018\n10.1016/B978-0-12-374920-8.00924-3\n10.1017/S0033583506004227\n10.1016/j.jmgm.2017.06.012\n10.1161/01.RES.81.5.727\n10.1016/S0025-5564(00)00019-5\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.10.023\n10.1007/s10439-009-9883-y\n10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1403999\n10.1007/BF02430957\n10.1007/s10439-006-9082-z\n10.1109/RBME.2011.2173761\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.04.015\n10.3389/fphy.2017.00048\n10.3389/fncom.2017.00027\n10.1152/ajpheart.00760.2013\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.07.012\n10.1063/1.4999602\n10.1172/JCI17341\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02200.x"}
{"title": "Resolvin D1 Attenuates Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity by Inhibiting Inflammation, Oxidative and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.", "abstract": "Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is a lipid mediator that promotes resolution of inflammation. However, the function of RvD1 in doxorubicin- (Dox-) induced cardiotoxicity remains to be clarified. This study aimed to investigate whether RvD1 could attenuate Dox-induced cardiac injury. The mice were divided into three groups: control, Dox (20\u00a0mg/kg, once, intraperitoneally), and Dox + RvD1. RvD1 (2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, intraperitoneally) was injected daily for 5\u00a0days. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate the cardiac function, and the heart tissue and serum samples were collected for further analyses. The results showed that RvD1 attenuated the decreased ratio of heart weight/body weight and heart weight/tibia length, the increased level of creatine kinase and activity of lactate dehydrogenase after Dox treatment. RvD1 improved the ejection fraction and fractional shortening of left ventricular and attenuated the severity of apoptosis induced by Dox. As for the underlying pathways, the results showed that RvD1 reduced the expression of IL-1 and IL-6, and attenuated the phosphorylation of P65 in cardiac tissue. RvD1 attenuated the oxidative stress induced by Dox, as demonstrated by the attenuated levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and malondialdehyde, decreased expression of Nox-2 and Nox-4 and increased expression of Nrf-2 and HO-1. In addition, RvD1 also inhibited the endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by Dox.

{"title": "Uncaria Rhynchophylla attenuates angiotensin \u2161-induced myocardial fibrosis via suppression of the RhoA/ROCK1 pathway.", "abstract": "Uncaria rhynchophylla (UR), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven effective in treating hypertensive patients in China. However, the mechanisms of action of UR in reducing hypertension and myocardial fibrosis are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of UR in an angiotensin \u2161 (Ang \u2161) induced mouse model. The mice were randomly divided into 5 groups and infused with Ang \u2161 (500\u00a0ng/kg/min) or saline, then administered UR (0.78, 1.56 or 3.12\u00a0g/kg/d) or saline for 4 weeks. UR treatment significantly attenuated the elevation of blood pressure caused by Ang \u2161. It enhanced myocardial function and attenuated the increase in the heart weight index and the pathological changes in the Ang \u2161-induced hypertensive mice. Furthermore, UR treatment inhibited cardiac fibrosis and significantly down-regulated collagen I, collagen \u2162, and \u03b1-SMA protein expression in cardiac tissues. UR also attenuated the expression of RhoA, ROCK1, CTGF, and TGF-\u03b21. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts stimulated with Ang \u2161, UR significantly down-regulated the expression of Collagen I, Collagen III, RhoA, ROCK1, and \u03b1-SMA. In summary, UR can significantly attenuate Ang \u2161-induced hypertension and cardiac fibrosis, partly via suppression of the RhoA/ROCK1 signaling pathway.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2022-01-23", "authors": ["LinglingXie", "TianyiWang", "ShanLin", "ZhuqingLu", "YilianWang", "ZhiqingShen", "YingCheng", "AlingShen", "JunPeng", "JianfengChu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112607"}

{"title": "Long noncoding RNA LUCAT1 enhances the survival and therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stromal cells post-myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) transplantation has been a promising therapeutic strategy for repairing heart tissues post-myocardial infarction (MI). Nevertheless, its therapeutic efficacy remains low, which is mainly ascribed to the low viability of transplanted MSCs. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to participate in diverse physiological and pathological processes, but little is known about their role in MSC survival. Using unbiased transcriptome profiling of hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs (HP-MSCs) and normoxic MSCs (N-MSCs), we identified a lncRNA named lung cancer-associated transcript 1 (LUCAT1) under hypoxia. LUCAT1 knockdown reduced the survival of engrafted MSCs and decreased the MSC-based therapeutic potency, as shown by impaired cardiac function, reduced cardiomyocyte survival, and increased fibrosis post-MI. Conversely, LUCAT1 overexpression had the opposite results. Mechanistically, LUCAT1 bound with and recruited jumonji domain-containing 6 (JMJD6) to the promoter of forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), which demethylated FOXQ1 at H4R3me", "journal": "Molecular therapy.

Finding the locations of the sources of these waves remains a challenging problem. This is mainly due to the low spatial resolution of electrode recordings of these waves. Also, these recordings are subjected to noise. In this paper, we develop a different approach: the AFV-DT method based on an averaged flow velocity (AFV) technique adopted from the analysis of optical flows and the determinant-trace (DT) method used for vector field analysis of dynamical systems. This method can find the location and determine all important types of sources found in excitable media such as focal activity, spiral waves, and waves rotating around obstacles. We test this method on in silico data of various wave excitation patterns obtained using the Luo-Rudy model for cardiac tissue. We show that the method works well for data with low spatial resolutions (up to 8\u00d78) and is stable against noise. Finally, we apply it to two clinical cases and show that it can correctly identify the arrhythmia type and location. We discuss further steps on the development and improvement of this approach.", "journal": "Physical review.

Using this platform, we herein present a model of myocardial ischemia on-a-chip, that recapitulates ischemic insult through exposure of mature 3D cardiac tissues to hypoxic environments. We report extensive validation and molecular-level analyses of the model in its ability to recapitulate myocardial ischemia in response to hypoxia, demonstrating the 1) induction of tissue fibrosis through upregulation of contractile fibers, 2) dysregulation in tissue contraction through functional assessment, 3) upregulation of hypoxia-response genes and downregulation of contractile-specific genes through targeted qPCR, and 4) transcriptomic pathway regulation of hypoxic tissues. Further, we investigated the complex response of ischemic myocardial tissues to reperfusion, identifying 5) cell toxicity, 6) sustained contractile irregularities, as well as 7) re-establishment of lactate levels and 8) gene expression, in hypoxic tissues in response to ischemia reperfusion injury.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2022-01-14", "authors": ["JaimesonVeldhuizen", "RamaniChavan", "BabakMoghadas", "Jin GPark", "Vikram DKodibagkar", "Raymond QMigrino", "MehdiNikkhah"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121336"}

Microenvironmental cues in vivo are influencing cardiac functions from cellular to tissue levels, and replications of these micro and macro features in the in vitro cardiac model shed light on cardiac research from a mechanistic point of view. With simple manipulation of topology, both physiological and pathological cardiac constructs can be remodeled to investigate the origin of abnormal cell phenotypes and functional responses in cardiac diseases.

The clinical use of doxorubicin is limited by its poorly predictable cardiotoxicity, the reasons of which are so far not fully understood. The drug is a substrate of several efflux transporters such as P-gp or BCRP and was recently reported to be a substrate of cation uptake transporters. To evaluate the potential role of transporter proteins in the accumulation of doxorubicin at its site of action (e.g., mammary carcinoma cells) or adverse effects (e.g., heart muscle cells), we studied the expression of important uptake and efflux transporters in human breast cancer and cardiac tissue, and investigated the affinity of doxorubicin to the identified transporters. The cellular uptake studies on doxorubicin were performed with OATP1A2*1, OATP1A2*2, and OATP1A2*3-overexpressing HEK293 cells, as well as OCT1-, OCT2-, and OCT3- overexpressing MDCKII cells. To assess the contribution of transporters to the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin, we determined the cell viability in the presence and absence of transporter inhibitors in different cell lines. Several transporters, including P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, OCT3, and OATP1A2 were expressed in human heart and/or breast cancer tissue. Doxorubicin could be identified as a substrate of OCT1, OCT2, OCT3, and OATP1A2. The cellular uptake into cells expressing genetic OATP1A2 variants was markedly reduced and correlated well with the increased cellular viability. Inhibition of OATP1A2 (naringin) and OCT transporters (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) resulted in a significant decrease of doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity in cell lines expressing the respective transporters. Similarly, the excipient Cremophor EL significantly inhibited the OCT1-3- and OATP1A2-mediated cellular uptake and attenuated the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. In conclusion, genetic and environmental-related variability in the expression and function of these transporters may contribute to the substantial variability seen in terms of doxorubicin efficacy and toxicity.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["MarcusOtter", "SusanneCsader", "MarkusKeiser", "StefanOswald"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23010255\n10.1007/s12012-007-0015-3\n10.2174/092986709788803312\n10.1097/FPC.0b013e32833ffb56\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.006\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.10.043\n10.1038/nm.2919\n10.1159/000265166\n10.1002/cncr.11407\n10.1085/jgp.78.4.349\n10.1002/jps.10161\n10.1248/bpb.21.527\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6690019\n10.2217/pgs-2018-0056\n10.1124/jpet.106.101774\n10.1002/ijc.10246\n10.1007/978-1-60761-416-6_4\n10.1002/ijc.28797\n10.1124/mol.116.105544\n10.1073/pnas.2020168118\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.05.174\n10.1038/bcj.2015.69\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0539\n10.2217/14622416.8.6.567\n10.1016/j.ejca.2003.12.026\n10.1182/blood-2009-07-229492\n10.1002/cncr.21666\n10.1371/journal.pone.0133182\n10.1002/jps.22622\n10.1007/s00210-008-0279-6\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.02.020\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181abc288\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206938\n10.1002/ijc.29965\n10.1007/s10549-011-1925-0\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0265\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010510-100556\n10.1007/s10549-014-2913-y\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.02.024\n10.1002/ijc.20369\n10.1002/1097-0215(20010701)93:1<114::AID-IJC1309>3.0.CO;2-J\n10.4161/cbt.7.9.6282\n10.1080/17425255.2017.1230199\n10.1159/000381313\n10.1074/jbc.M411092200\n10.1124/mol.118.114314\n10.1124/dmd.121.000367\n10.1038/srep20508\n10.1002/cpt.1115\n10.1124/pr.118.015578\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00430.x\n10.1016/S0959-8049(01)00171-X\n10.1081/CNV-100000150\n10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1906\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010717\n10.1023/B:BILE.0000019559.84305.47\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2016.11.028\n10.1016/j.bcp.2010.08.008\n10.1021/mp500532x\n10.1124/dmd.106.014407\n10.1016/j.jpba.2013.07.031\n10.1002/cpph.22"}

Cardiovascular tissue engineering has been developed as a promising therapeutic approach for post-MI repair. Previously, we discovered the ability of a polypyrrole (PPy)-incorporated cardiogel (CG) for improvement of maturity and functional synchrony of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Here, we used the cross-linked form of PPy-incorporated CG (CG-PPy), in order to improve electromechanical properties of scaffold, for application in cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) transplantation on post-MI rat hearts. Improved mechanical property and electrical conductivity (sixfold) were evident in the cross-linked CG-PPy (P1) compared to cross-linked CG (C1) scaffolds. Transplantation of CPC-loaded P1 (P1-CPC) resulted in substantial improvement of cardiac functional properties. Furthermore, lower fibrotic tissue and higher CPC retention were observed. The grafted cells showed cardiomyocyte characteristics when stained with human cardiac troponin T and connexin43 antibodies, while neovessel formation was similarly prominent.

In the present study, the cardiac effect of ArBu and its underlying mechanism were explored by integrating data such as heart rates, toxicokinetics, myocardial enzyme and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) activity, pathological sections, lipidomics and proteomics. Under different doses, the cardiac effects turned out to be different. The oral dose of 60\u00a0mg/kg of ArBu sped up the heart rate. However, 120\u00a0mg/kg ArBu mainly reduced the heart rate. Over time, they all returned to normal, consisting of the trend of ArBu concentration-time curve. High concentrations of myocardial enzymes and BNP indicated that ArBu inhibited or impaired the cardiac function of rats. Pathological sections of hearts also showed that ArBu caused myocardial fiber disorder and rupture, in which the high-dose group was more serious. At the same time, serum and heart tissue lipidomics were used to explore the changes in body lipid metabolism under different doses. The data indicated a larger difference in the high-dose ArBu group. There were likewise many significant differences in the proteomics of the heart. Furthermore, a multi-layered network was used to integrate the above information to explore the potential mechanism. Finally, 4 proteins that were shown to be significantly and differentially expressed were validated by targeted proteomics using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. Our findings indicated that ArBu behaved as a bidirectional regulation of the heart.

One of the diabetic groups was considered the positive control and fed a standard diet, whereas the remaining two groups were fed with a 20% and 25% hammour fish diet for 28\u00a0days. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were taken from all the rats, and their organs were removed and subjected to biochemical analysis. The results indicated that the group fed with the 25% hammour fish diet exhibited significantly lower levels of liver, kidney, and heart damage, along with lower levels of serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, GOT, GPT and ALP, as compared to the positive control. The urea and creatinine levels were significantly higher for the rats that were fed the 20% hammour fish diet than for those in the positive control. The histopathological study of the heart showed a slight improvement of the heart tissues with the increase of hammour fish intake compare to the positive control, while kidney of rat from group 4, which were fed 25% hammour fish, showed granularity of epithelial lining glomerular tufts.", "journal": "Saudi journal of biological sciences", "date": "2022-01-11", "authors": ["Lobna Saad MohammedAbd Elmeged", "Abdullah A AAlghamdi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.08.080"}

{"title": "Acute Heart Failure After Reperfused Ischemic Stroke: Association With Systemic and Cardiac Inflammatory Responses.", "abstract": "Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) present an increased incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and release of Troponin T coinciding with cardiac dysfunction. The nature of the cardiocirculatory alterations remains obscure as models to investigate systemic interferences of the brain-heart-axis following AIS are sparse. Thus, this study aims to investigate acute cardiocirculatory dysfunction and myocardial injury in mice after reperfused AIS. Ischemic stroke was induced in mice by transient right-sided middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Cardiac effects were investigated by electrocardiograms, 3D-echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), invasive conductance catheter measurements, histology, flow-cytometry, and determination of high-sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT). Systemic hemodynamics were recorded and catecholamines and inflammatory markers in circulating blood and myocardial tissue were determined by immuno-assay and flow-cytometry. Twenty-four hours following tMCAO hsTnT was elevated 4-fold compared to controls and predicted long-term survival. In parallel, systolic left ventricular dysfunction occurred with impaired global longitudinal strain, lower blood pressure, reduced stroke volume, and severe bradycardia leading to reduced cardiac output. This was accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response characterized by granulocytosis, lymphopenia, and increased levels of serum-amyloid P and interleukin-6. Within myocardial tissue, MRI relaxometry indicated expansion of extracellular space, most likely due to inflammatory edema and a reduced fluid volume. Accordingly, we found an increased abundance of granulocytes, apoptotic cells, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines within myocardial tissue following tMCAO. Therefore, reperfused ischemic stroke leads to specific cardiocirculatory alterations that are characterized by acute heart failure with reduced stroke volume, bradycardia, and changes in cardiac tissue and accompanied by systemic and local inflammatory responses.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2022-01-08", "authors": ["LilianVornholz", "FabianNienhaus", "MichaelGliem", "ChristinaAlter", "CarinaHenning", "AlexanderLang", "HakimaEzzahoini", "GeorgWolff", "LukasClasen", "TienushRassaf", "UlrichFl\u00f6gel", "MalteKelm", "NorbertGerdes", "SebastianJander", "FlorianB\u00f6nner"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.782760\n10.1002/ana.20806\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw149\n10.1159/000353875\n10.1161/01.STR.0000137607.61697.77\n10.1161/01.STR.17.3.472\n10.1002/ana.25073\n10.1371/journal.pone.0034730\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300180\n10.1186/s12968-015-0118-0\n10.1007/s12975-017-0520-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311170\n10.1136/jnnp.2004.037531\n10.1080/01616412.1997.11740874\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.002470\n10.1016/j.jns.2014.12.007\n10.1161/01.STR.0000251441.89665.bc\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.10.409\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.737890\n10.1111/ene.12233\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.2.H733\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.116.006025\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx393\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.001714\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.149476\n10.1002/ana.24906\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2009.07.029\n10.1093/cvr/cvw024\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.536086\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018547\n10.1161/01.STR.30.5.981\n10.4049/jimmunol.176.11.6523\n10.1016/0006-8993(90)91796-J\n10.1002/cphy.c140076\n10.1038/nprot.2008.138\n10.1084/jem.20021098\n10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.05.005\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.10.036\n10.1016/0006-8993(86)90973-X\n10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70291-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308446\n10.1056/NEJMoa1406761\n10.1161/01.STR.30.7.1307\n10.1007/s00395-013-0330-8\n10.1212/01.wnl.0000342471.07290.07\n10.1002/jcsm.12335\n10.1038/cddis.2016.140\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.12.116\n10.1007/s00392-015-0928-y"}

However, it remains unclear whether the control of cardiomyocyte alignment influences cardiac function and the underlying mechanisms. We fabricated aligned human cardiac tissue using a micro-processed fibrin gel with inverted V-shaped ridges (MFG) and elucidated the effect of alignment control on contractile properties. When human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were seeded on MFG, hiPSC-CMs were aligned more uniformly than the control, and we succeeded in fabricating the aligned cardiac tissue. Assessing the contractile properties with the direct contractile measurement system, the contractile force, maximum contractile velocity, and relaxation velocity were significantly increased in aligned cardiac tissue compared with non-aligned cardiac tissue. However, gene expression profiles were not different between the two groups, suggesting that functional improvement of cardiac tissue through alignment control might not be dependent on cardiomyocyte maturation. Motion capture analysis revealed that the cardiomyocytes in the aligned cardiac tissues showed more unidirectional and synchronous contraction than the non-aligned cardiac tissues, indicating that cardiac tissue maturation involves electrical integration of cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Neuraminidase1 Inhibitor Protects Against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity ", "abstract": "Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin (DOX), are among the effective chemotherapeutic drugs for various malignancies. However, their clinical use is limited by irreversible cardiotoxicity. This study sought to determine the role of neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy and the potential cardio-protective effects of NEU1 inhibitor oseltamivir (OSE). Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized into three groups: control, DOX, and DOX + OSE. NEU1 was highly expressed in DOX-treated rat heart tissues compared with the control group, which was suppressed by OSE administration. Rats in the DOX\u00a0+\u00a0OSE group showed preserved cardiac function and were protected from DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. The beneficial effects of OSE were associated with the suppression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-dependent mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. In detail, the elevated NEU1 in cardiomyocytes triggered by DOX increased the expression of Drp1, which subsequently enhanced mitochondrial fission and PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy, leading to a maladaptive feedback circle towards myocardial apoptosis and cell death. OSE administration selectively inhibited the increased NEU1 in myocardial cells insulted by DOX, followed by reduction of Drp1 expression, inhibition of PINK1 stabilization on mitochondria, and Parkin translocation to mitochondria, thus alleviating excessive mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, alleviating subsequent development of cellular apoptotic process. This work identified NEU1 as a crucial inducer of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy by promoting Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, and NEU1 inhibitor showed new indications of cardio-protection against DOX cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2022-01-04", "authors": ["YatingQin", "ChaoLv", "XinxinZhang", "WeibinRuan", "XiangyuXu", "ChenChen", "XinyunJi", "LiLu", "XiaomeiGuo"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2021.802502\n10.1200/jco.19.01203\n10.1038/cdd.2012.81\n10.1161/circulationaha.114.013777\n10.1096/fj.201802663R\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab347\n10.1200/jco.2014.59.4473\n10.1111/jpi.12491\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.09.001\n10.1038/s41586-019-1296-y\n10.1093/cvr/cvt336\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077713\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.11.014\n10.1515/cclm.2000.197\n10.1073/pnas.1909814117\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2003.08.005\n10.1007/s00395-020-00821-z\n10.1016/j.apsb.2019.03.003\n10.1093/hmg/7.1.115\n10.3389/fphar.2020.604700\n10.1161/circulationaha.115.017443\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104846\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.12.021\n10.1371/journal.pone.0238856\n10.1016/j.mam.2019.09.006\n10.1038/s41556-018-0176-2\n10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.004\n10.1038/ng0397-316\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.10.043\n10.1016/j.tips.2015.03.005\n10.1016/j.vph.2018.01.005\n10.1515/cclm.2006.037\n10.1002/cncr.11407\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.01.073\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.06.1167\n10.1161/circresaha.119.314681\n10.3389/fgene.2018.00734\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.06.005\n10.1016/j.bcp.2014.01.040\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.004589\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.06.003\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2020.05.015\n10.1194/jlr.M027300\n10.1146/annurev.med.57.121304.131240\n10.1016/j.tiv.2018.05.001\n10.1142/S0192415X21500403\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031139\n10.1038/nm.2919\n10.1038/s41418-019-0372-z\n10.1111/jpi.12413\n10.1016/j.mad.2021.111442"}

However, cardiotoxicity associated with IMA is included among the therapeutic strategies. The present study was aimed to discover whether ferroptosis, a programmed iron-dependent cell death, is involved in IMA-induced cardiotoxicity. In vivo, mouse model was established after treated with 25\u00a0mg/kg, 50\u00a0mg/kg and 100\u00a0mg/kg IMA. Serum CK, LDH, AST activities were determined. Cardiac tissues were examined by H&E and Oil Red O staining. MDA was measured to assess production of lipid peroxide. Tissue iron and GSH content were measured. In vitro, cell viability, mitochondria membrane potential, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular iron levels were performed to explore the mechanism of IMA. The in vivo results revealed that IMA treatment significantly increased serum CK, LDH and AST. H&E staining showed that IMA caused cardiac structural injuries. The dose-dependent decrease of GSH and increase of tissue iron and MDA were observed in IMA-treated groups. Oil Red O staining suggested obvious cardiac lipid accumulation after treated with IMA. In H9c2 cardiomyocytes, IMA significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Mitochondria membrane potential assay showed that IMA destroyed the mitochondrial function. Additionally, IMA increased the cellular ROS and iron levels. Furthermore, IMA down-regulated the expression of Nrf2 and up-regulated the expression of P53 and TfR. These results provided compelling evidence that ferroptosis participates in IMA-induced cardiotoxicity. Ferroptosis could be regarded as a target to protect against cardiotoxicity in IMA-exposed patients.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2022-01-02", "authors": ["ChengzhuSong", "DongningLi", "JieZhang", "XiaoyanZhao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2021.115852"}

{"title": "The influence of light on the beat rate variability of murine embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "The human heart rhythm can be quantified by analyzing the heart rate variability (HRV). A major influencing factor of the HRV is the circadian rhythm. The ocular light and the hormone melatonin play decisive roles in the circadian rhythm. The beat rate variability (BRV) is considered to be the in vitro equivalent of the HRV. Previous studies have demonstrated the influence of melatonin on cardiomyocytes. Also, the influence of light on cardiomyocytes has been described before. Nevertheless, the effect of light on the BRV of cardiomyocytes has not yet been examined.\nThe BRV of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes was measured with microelectrode arrays over a time period of 30\u00a0min. The experiments were either performed with light exposure (with and without an infrared filter) or in complete darkness.\nThe BRV was higher and the beating frequency was lower when the cardiomyocytes were exposed to the full spectrum of light, compared to the measurements in darkness as well as to the measurements with an infrared filter. In contrast, the differences of BRV between the measurements in darkness and the measurements with an infrared filter were not as distinct.\nThis is the first study demonstrating the influence of light on the beating rhythm of heart tissue in vitro. The results indicate that especially the infrared spectrum of light alters the BRV.

Physicians apply thrombolytic therapy, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to recanalize and restore blood flow to the coronary arteries, albeit they were not convincingly able to solve the heart problems. Thus, researchers aim to introduce novel substitutional therapies for regenerating and functionalizing damaged cardiac tissue based on engineering concepts. Cell-based engineering approaches, utilizing biomaterials, gene, drug, growth factor delivery systems, and tissue engineering are the most leading studies in the field of heart regeneration. Also, understanding the primary cause of MI and thus selecting the most efficient treatment method can be enhanced by preparing microdevices so-called heart-on-a-chip. In this regard, microfluidic approaches can be used as diagnostic platforms or drug screening in cardiac disease treatment. Additionally, bioprinting technique with whole organ 3D printing of human heart with major vessels, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells can be an ideal goal for cardiac tissue engineering and remarkable achievement in near future.

{"title": "Voltage-mediated mechanism for calcium wave synchronization and arrhythmogenesis in atrial tissue.", "abstract": "A wide range of atrial arrythmias are caused by molecular defects in proteins that regulate calcium (Ca) cycling. In many cases, these defects promote the propagation of subcellular Ca waves in the cell, which can perturb the voltage time course and induce dangerous perturbations of the action potential (AP). However, subcellular Ca waves occur randomly in cells and, therefore, electrical coupling between cells substantially decreases their effect on the AP. In this study, we present evidence that Ca waves in atrial tissue can synchronize in-phase owing to an order-disorder phase transition. In particular, we show that, below a critical pacing rate, Ca waves are desynchronized and therefore do not induce substantial AP fluctuations in tissue. However, above this critical pacing rate, Ca waves gradually synchronize over millions of cells, which leads to a dramatic amplification of AP fluctuations. We exploit an underlying Ising symmetry of paced cardiac tissue to show that this transition exhibits universal properties common to a wide range of physical systems in nature. Finally, we show that in the heart, phase synchronization induces spatially out-of-phase AP duration alternans which drives wave break and reentry. These results\u00a0suggest that cardiac tissue exhibits a phase transition that is required for subcellular Ca cycling defects to induce a life-threatening arrhythmia.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2021-12-31", "authors": ["D'ArtagnanGreene", "AbouzarKaboudian", "John AWasserstrom", "Flavio HFenton", "YohannesShiferaw"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2021.12.040"}

Despite increasing number of publications using these models, comparative characterization of these cell lines has not been performed, therefore, their limitations are undetermined. We aimed to compare cardiac cell lines to primary cardiomyocytes and to mature cardiac tissues in a systematic manner.\nCardiac cell lines (H9C2, AC16, HL-1) were differentiated with widely used protocols. Left ventricular tissue, neonatal primary cardiomyocytes, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes served as reference tissue or cells. RNA expression of cardiac markers (e.g. Tnnt2, Ryr2) was markedly lower in cell lines compared to references. Differentiation induced increase in cardiac- and decrease in embryonic markers however, the overall transcriptomic profile and annotation to relevant biological processes showed consistently less pronounced cardiac phenotype in all cell lines in comparison to the corresponding references. Immunocytochemistry confirmed low expressions of structural protein sarcomeric alpha-actinin, troponin I and caveolin-3 in cell lines. Susceptibility of cell lines to sI/R injury in terms of viability as well as mitochondrial polarization differed from the primary cells irrespective of their degree of differentiation.\nExpression patterns of cardiomyocyte markers and whole transcriptomic profile, as well as response to sI/R, and to hypertrophic stimuli indicate low-to-moderate similarity of cell lines to primary cells/cardiac tissues regardless their differentiation.

{"title": "Evolving roles of cardiac fibroblasts in cardiogenesis and immunology, electrophysiology, and aging.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), one of the major groups of cardiac cells, play a prominent role in the cardiac microenvironment through communicating with other cells such as cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and immune cells. These communications are required not only during cardiac development but also during pathogenesis. CFs are also involved in developmental changes in the post-natal and pre-natal heart through depositing extra cellular matrix (ECM) and maintaining cardiac tissue structure. Furthermore, CFs show both detrimental and beneficial effects in maintenance of the electrophysiology of the heart. Senescent CFs in the cardiac microenvironment influence other cardiac cells through paracrine signaling, which would worsen or cure the diseases. Therefore, there is a need of exclusive study on CFs' role in the developmental stage of the heart, electrophysiology, and senescence.

Skin abnormalities are described in about 20% of the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). Among those, some rare CDG forms constitute a special group among the syndromic ichthyoses and can initially misdirect the diagnosis towards non-syndromic genodermatosis. DOLK-CDG is such a rare subtype, resulting from a defect in dolichol kinase, in which the congenital skin phenotype (often ichthyosis) is later associated with variable extracutaneous features such as dilatative cardiomyopathy, epilepsy, microcephaly, visual impairment, and hypoglycemia and may lead to a fatal course.

In vitro, rat primary CMECs were stimulated by homocysteine (Hcy). The apoptosis of CMECs was measured using flow cytometry.

Meanwhile, MIB1 overexpression decreased the protein levels of ASK1 and p38, while not affected ASK1 mRNA levels. The following mechanism experiments revealed that MIB1 downregulated ASK1 expression by increasing its ubiquitination. ASK1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of MIB1 on FGL2 secretion, apoptosis, inflammation, and p38 activation in Hcy-treated CMECs.

{"title": "Immunocompetent Mice Infected by Two Lineages of Dengue Virus Type 2: Observations on the Pathology of the Lung, Heart and Skeletal Muscle.", "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection by one of the four serotypes (DENV-1 to 4) may result in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, with unpredictable evolution and organ involvement. Due to its association with severe epidemics and clinical manifestations, DENV-2 has been substantially investigated. In fact, the first emergence of a new lineage of the DENV-2 Asian/American genotype in Brazil (Lineage II) in 2008 was associated with severe cases and increased mortality related to organ involvement. A major challenge for dengue pathogenesis studies has been a suitable animal model, but the use of immune-competent mice, although sometimes controversial, has proven to be useful, as histological observations in infected animals reveal tissue alterations consistent to those observed in dengue human cases. Here, we aimed to investigate the outcomes caused by two distinct lineages of the DENV-2 Asian/American genotype in the lung, heart and skeletal muscle tissues of infected BALB/c mice. Tissues were submitted to histopathology, immunohistochemistry, histomorphometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The viral genome was detected in heart and skeletal muscle samples. The viral antigen was detected in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells of heart tissue. Heart and lung tissue samples presented morphological alterations comparable to those seen in dengue human cases. Creatine kinase serum levels were higher in mice infected with both lineages of DENV-2. Additionally, statistically significant differences, concerning alveolar septa thickening and heart weight, were observed between BALB/c mice infected with both DENV-2 lineages, which was demonstrated to be an appropriate experimental model for dengue pathogenesis studies on lung, heart and skeletal muscle tissues.", "journal": "Microorganisms", "date": "2021-12-25", "authors": ["Fernanda CunhaJ\u00e1come", "Gabriela CardosoCaldas", "Arthur da CostaRasinhas", "Ana Luisa Teixeirade Almeida", "Daniel Dias Coutinhode Souza", "Amanda CarlosPaulino", "Marcos Alexandre Nunesda Silva", "Derick MendesBandeira", "Ortrud MonikaBarth", "Flavia BarretoDos Santos", "Debora FerreiraBarreto-Vieira"], "doi": "10.3390/microorganisms9122536\n10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30545-X\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.05.058\n10.1128/CMR.00035-09\n10.1371/journal.pone.0083386\n10.1086/383043\n10.1111/j.1365-3156.2007.01891.x\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.105134\n10.1371/journal.pone.0096313\n10.1590/1806-3713/e20190246\n10.1136/hrt.34.8.821\n10.1097/INF.0b013e3181bc3c5b\n10.4067/S0716-10182015000300016\n10.1155/2015/319312\n10.1007/s15010-020-01500-w\n10.5041/RMMJ.10436\n10.3390/v12060616\n10.1016/j.jcv.2006.10.011\n10.1186/cc2978\n10.1007/s15010-011-0203-8\n10.1590/S0004-282X1993000200001\n10.1086/392510\n10.4103/0972-2327.70882\n10.5582/irdr.2017.01071\n10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1680_20\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60572-9\n10.12688/f1000research.7024.1\n10.1186/s12879-018-3255-x\n10.3201/eid1603.090996\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002095\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098519\n10.1371/journal.pone.0225879\n10.1128/JVI.79.2.853-859.2005\n10.1590/S1020-49892007001000009\n10.1093/trstmh/trs091\n10.1590/S0074-02762007000200009\n10.1590/S0074-02762006000800014\n10.1016/j.virol.2005.04.042\n10.1038/labinvest.2009.83\n10.1007/s13365-012-0117-y\n10.1590/0074-02760170208\n10.1016/j.tice.2016.11.005\n10.1038/s41598-018-28137-y\n10.1038/s41598-021-88502-2\n10.3390/pathogens10091084\n10.1136/heartjnl-2020-318912\n10.3389/fcell.2021.637270\n10.4269/ajtmh.1984.33.158\n10.1128/jcm.30.3.545-551.1992\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a118408\n10.1128/JCM.43.10.4977-4983.2005\n10.1006/viro.1999.9656\n10.1590/S1413-86702008000600005\n10.3201/eid1109.041043\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0001147\n10.1186/s12879-021-05959-2\n10.1177/2048872613475889\n10.3390/pathogens8040223\n10.1590/S0100-39842004000300004\n10.1007/s00408-017-0021-6\n10.1590/S1413-86702005000400012\n10.1186/1750-1172-4-8\n10.1016/j.rmed.2012.07.014\n10.1093/cid/cit403\n10.1136/heartasia-2014-010560\n10.1038/s41598-017-16197-5\n10.4149/av_2019_309\n10.1002/rmv.1971"}

Therefore, we aim to develop a right heart dysfunction (RHD) model using the 3-dimensional engineered heart tissue (EHT) approach and cardiomyocytes derived from patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to unravel the mechanisms that determine the fate of a pressure-overloaded right ventricle. iPSCs from PAH and healthy control subjects were differentiated into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), incorporated into the EHT, and maintained for 28 days. In comparison with control iPSC-CMs, PAH-derived iPSC-CMs exhibited decreased beating frequency and increased contraction and relaxation times. iPSC-CM alignment within the EHT was observed. PAH-derived EHTs exhibited higher force, and contraction and relaxation times compared with control EHTs. Increased afterload was induced using 2\u00d7 stiffer posts from day 0. Due to high variability, there were no functional differences between normal and stiffer EHTs, and no differences in the hypertrophic gene expression. In conclusion, under baseline spontaneous conditions, PAH-derived iPSC-CMs and EHTs show prolonged contraction compared with controls, as observed clinically in PAH patients.

{"title": "HOPX Plays a Critical Role in Antiretroviral Drugs Induced Epigenetic Modification and Cardiac Hypertrophy.", "abstract": "People living with HIV (PLWH) have to take an antiretroviral therapy (ART) for life and show noncommunicable illnesses such as chronic inflammation, immune activation, and multiorgan dysregulation. Recent studies suggest that long-term use of ART induces comorbid conditions and is one of the leading causes of heart failure in PLWH. However, the molecular mechanism of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) induced heart failure is unclear. To determine the mechanism of ARVs induced cardiac dysfunction, we performed global transcriptomic profiling of ARVs treated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in culture. Differentially expressed genes were identified by RNA-sequencing. Our data show that ARVs treatment causes upregulation of several biological functions associated with cardiotoxicity, hypertrophy, and heart failure. Global gene expression data were validated in cardiac tissue isolated from HIV patients having a history of ART. Interestingly, we found that homeodomain-only protein homeobox (HOPX) expression was significantly increased in cardiomyocytes treated with ARVs and in the heart tissue of HIV patients. Furthermore, we found that HOPX plays a crucial role in ARVs mediated cellular hypertrophy. Mechanistically, we found that HOPX plays a critical role in epigenetic regulation, through deacetylation of histone, while the HDAC inhibitor, Trichostatin A, can restore the acetylation level of histone 3 in the presence of ARVs.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2021-12-25", "authors": ["ShiridharKashyap", "MaryamRabbani", "Isabelade Lima", "OlenaKondrachuk", "RajPatel", "Mahnoush SophiaShafiei", "AvniMukker", "AishwaryaRajakumar", "Manish KumarGupta"], "doi": "10.3390/cells10123458\n10.1186/s12884-017-1276-x\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2015.10.030\n10.1097/01.qai.0000233310.90484.16\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.033369\n10.1111/j.1468-1293.2012.00996.x\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61809-7\n10.1038/s41569-019-0219-9\n10.1517/14656566.2015.1044436\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.11.019\n10.1093/cid/cix1108\n10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00056-0\n10.1056/NEJMra041811\n10.1093/cid/ciq066\n10.1385/CT:4:3:271\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2018.02.001\n10.1242/dev.118.3.817\n10.1002/ijc.24217\n10.1038/nrg2485\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.08.012\n10.1083/jcb.151.1.117\n10.2147/TCRM.S23625\n10.1038/nmeth.1226\n10.1038/nbt.1621\n10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106\n10.1089/omi.2011.0118\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.634774\n10.1161/JAHA.118.009985\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000254415.31362.a7\n10.1089/aid.1996.12.1559\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.13.1246\n10.1136/heart.84.6.620\n10.1053/jinf.2000.0672\n10.1016/0002-8703(95)90083-7\n10.1038/nrm1983\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00932-7\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00933-9\n10.1172/JCI19137"}

{"title": "Camphorquinone Promotes the Antisenescence Effect via Activating AMPK/SIRT1 in Stem Cells and D-Galactose-Induced Aging Mice.", "abstract": "Terpenoids are a wide class of secondary metabolites with geroprotective properties that can alter the mechanism of aging and aging-related diseases. Camphorquinone (CQ) is a bicyclic monoterpenoid compound that can be efficiently synthesized through the continuous bromination and oxidation reaction of camphor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of CQ on oxidative-stress-induced senescence and its underlying mechanisms. To generate oxidative stress in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) and mice, we used hydrogen peroxide (200 \u03bcM twice) and D-galactose (D-Gal) (150 mg/kg for 10 weeks), respectively. Our findings suggest that CQ potentially reduces senescence in hBM-MSCs and mouse heart tissue. In addition, we found that CQ boosted AMPK/SIRT1 activation and autophagy in both models. These results were subsequently verified in hBM-MSCs using compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) but AMPK inhibition by CC did not significantly reduce the SIRT1 and the autophagy markers.

{"title": "Designing a 3D Printing Based Auxetic Cardiac Patch with hiPSC-CMs for Heart Repair.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is one of the largest contributors to cardiovascular disease and reduces the ability of the heart to pump blood. One promising therapeutic approach to address the diminished function is the use of cardiac patches composed of biomaterial substrates and cardiac cells. These patches can be enhanced with the application of an auxetic design, which has a negative Poisson's ratio and can be modified to suit the mechanics of the infarct and surrounding cardiac tissue. Here, we examined multiple auxetic models (orthogonal missing rib and re-entrant honeycomb in two orientations) with tunable mechanical properties as a cardiac patch substrate. Further, we demonstrated that 3D printing based auxetic cardiac patches of varying thicknesses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mm) composed of polycaprolactone and gelatin methacrylate can support induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte function for 14-day culture.

{"title": "Chitosan as Functional Biomaterial for Designing Delivery Systems in Cardiac Therapies.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality across the globe, and transplant surgeries are not always successful since it is not always possible to replace most of the damaged heart tissues, for example in myocardial infarction. Chitosan, a natural polysaccharide, is an important biomaterial for many biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. Based on the origin, degree of deacetylation, structure, and biological functions, chitosan has emerged for vital tissue engineering applications. Recent studies reported that chitosan coupled with innovative technologies helped to load or deliver drugs or stem cells to repair the damaged heart tissue not just in a myocardial infarction but even in other cardiac therapies. Herein, we outlined the latest advances in cardiac tissue engineering mediated by chitosan overcoming the barriers in cardiac diseases. We reviewed in vitro and in vivo data reported dealing with drug delivery systems, scaffolds, or carriers fabricated using chitosan for stem cell therapy essential in cardiac tissue engineering.

After treatment for 3 weeks, electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and cardiac function were recorded. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to detect pathological changes in the heart. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect serum B-type brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and serum inflammatory cytokines. Metabolomic analysis was used to identify differential biomarkers of MI in rats. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect BNP, cTnT, TNF-\u03b1, LC3B, Beclin-1, p62, and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression in cardiac tissue.\nFuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) alone or Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) markedly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction and abnormal ECGs, demonstrated by decreases in the heart weight/body weight ratio, BNP, and cTnT. Pro-inflammation cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 significantly decreased and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 significantly increased in Renshen (Radix Ginseng) single or Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) groups compared with the control group.

However, detailed biological understanding of the myocardial changes in AVS hearts on the proteome level is still lacking. Proteomic studies using high-resolution mass spectrometry of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human myocardial tissue of AVS-patients are very rare due to methodical issues. To overcome these issues this study used high resolution mass spectrometry in combination with a stem cell-derived cardiac specific protein quantification-standard to profile the proteomes of 17 atrial and 29 left ventricular myocardial FFPE human myocardial tissue samples from AVS-patients. In our proteomic analysis we quantified a median of 1980 (range 1495-2281) proteins in every single sample and identified significant upregulation of 239 proteins in atrial and 54 proteins in ventricular myocardium. We compared the proteins with published data. Well studied proteins reflect disease-related changes in AVS, such as cardiac hypertrophy, development of fibrosis, impairment of mitochondria and downregulated blood supply.

{"title": "Reducing oxidative stress may be important for treating pirarubicin-induced cardiotoxicity with schisandrin B.", "abstract": "The cardiotoxicity of pirarubicin (THP) seriously affects its clinical application, which cannot be ignored. The antioxidant effect of schisandrin B (SchB) has been extensively reported in the context of dietotherapy. However, whether this antioxidant effect can protect the heart from THP damage remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the antioxidant effect of SchB can antagonize the cardiotoxicity of THP. Changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography and serum lactate dehydrogenase, brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin T levels were used to detect the degree of cardiac damage. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde, catalase and total antioxidant capacity in the serum and heart were measured to observe the oxidative stress state of rats. Primary cardiomyocytes were cultured, and cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were detected. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of SOD2, NOX2, pro/cleaved-caspase3 and Bcl-2/Bax in heart tissue and primary cardiomyocytes to verify the related signaling pathways. THP-treated rats showed a range of cardiac damage, including an abnormal ECG, echocardiography and myocardial enzymes. In the cellular experiments, cell viability decreased and ROS increased. However, this damage was alleviated after SchB treatment. Further studies demonstrated that SchB antagonized THP cardiotoxicity via its antioxidant effect. In conclusion, SchB protects the heart from THP damage in rats, and the mechanism may be closely associated with its antioxidant effect.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2021-12-23", "authors": ["HengTang", "JunhaoZhao", "RuiFeng", "PengPu", "LiWen"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2021.10991\n10.1016/S0076-6879(04)78025-8\n10.1007/s12012-017-9437-8\n10.26355/eurrev_201804_14752\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.01.007\n10.1186/s12906-017-2061-0\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.02.013\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.12.013\n10.1136/acupmed-2012-010266\n10.1139/apnm-2018-0251\n10.1155/2012/250825\n10.1016/j.fitote.2010.11.018\n10.1155/2020/2172740\n10.1016/j.jpba.2013.01.041\n10.1097/WNR.0000000000000354\n10.3892/mmr.2017.7926\n10.3892/mmr.2021.12342\n10.1248/bpb.33.825\n10.1002/mpo.2950220410\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119133\n10.22038/ijbms.2021.52690.11892\n10.1186/s13046-016-0487-8\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1579\n10.1371/journal.pone.0028335\n10.1111/echo.14252\n10.2174/157340311799960681\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.08.035\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000130926.51766.CC\n10.1155/2017/1521020\n10.3390/nu9090966\n10.3892/mmr.2017.6456\n10.3349/ymj.2017.58.1.206\n10.1002/tox.22172\n10.2174/1381612821666151029112302\n10.1042/CS20130787\n10.3390/antiox6030056\n10.3892/mmr.2017.6622\n10.1002/jnr.20089\n10.1038/s41418-019-0372-z\n10.3389/fmicb.2019.02185\n10.1007/s10495-014-1039-3"}
{"title": "Models of cardiovascular surgery biobanking to facilitate translational research and precision medicine.", "abstract": "Biobanking in health care has evolved over the last few decades from simple biological sample repositories to complex and dynamic units with multi-organizational infrastructure networks and has become an essential tool for modern medical research. Cardiovascular tissue biobanking provides a unique opportunity to utilize cardiac and vascular samples for translational research into heart failure and other related pathologies. Current techniques for diagnosis, classification, and treatment monitoring of cardiac disease relies primarily on interpretation of clinical signs, imaging, and blood biomarkers. Further research at the disease source (i.e. myocardium and blood vessels) has been limited by a relative lack of access to quality human cardiac tissue and the inherent shortcomings of most animal models of heart disease. In this review, we describe a model for cardiovascular tissue biobanking and databasing, and its potential to facilitate basic and translational research. We share techniques to procure endocardial samples from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, in addition to aortic disease samples. We discuss some of the issues with respect to data collection, privacy, biobank consent, and the governance of tissue biobanking. The development of tissue biobanks as described here has significant scope to improve and facilitate translational research in multi-omic fields such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This research heralds an era of precision medicine, in which patients with cardiovascular pathology can be provided with optimized and personalized medical care for the treatment of their individual phenotype.", "journal": "ESC heart failure", "date": "2021-12-22", "authors": ["YingYanZhu", "DanJackson", "BenjaminHunter", "LornaBeattie", "LisaTurner", "Brett DHambly", "Richmond WJeremy", "CassandraMalecki", "Elizabeth NRobertson", "AmyLi", "CrisDos Remedios", "DavidRichmond", "ChristopherSemsarian", "John FO'Sullivan", "Paul GBannon", "SeanLal"], "doi": "10.1002/ehf2.13768"}

By extending conventional histopathological examination by a third dimension, the delicate pathological changes of the vascular system of severe Covid-19 progressions can be analyzed, fully quantified and compared to other types of viral myocarditis and controls. To this end, cardiac samples with a cross-section of 3.5mm were scanned at a laboratory setup as well as at a parallel beam setup at a synchrotron radiation facility the synchrotron in a parallel beam configuration. The vascular network was segmented by a deep learning architecture suitable for 3d datasets (V-net), trained by sparse manual annotations. Pathological alterations of vessels, concerning the variation of diameters and the amount of small holes, were observed, indicative of elevated occurrence of intussusceptive angiogenesis, also confirmed by high-resolution cone beam X-ray tomography and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, we implemented a fully automated analysis of the tissue structure in the form of shape measures based on the structure tensor.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment reduces the risk of developing coronary aneurysms, but some children have IVIG-resistant KD, which increases their risk of developing coronary artery injury. Here, we investigated the effect of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM), which has anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties on the development of coronary arteritis in a mouse model of vasculitis.\nAn animal model of KD-like vasculitis was created by injecting mice with Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS). This model was used to investigate the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-10, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and tissue factor (TF), in addition to histopathology of heart tissues.\nrTM treatment significantly reduces cardiac vascular endothelium hypertrophy by 34 days after CAWS treatment. In addition, mRNA expression analysis revealed that rTM administration increased cardiac IL-10 expression until day 27, whereas expression of TNF-\u03b1 was unaffected. Moreover, in the spleen, rTM treatment restores IL-10 and TF expression to normal levels.\nThese findings suggest that rTM suppresses CAWS-induced vasculitis by upregulating IL-10.

Discovering new therapies to treat heart disease requires improved understanding of cardiac physiology at a cellular level. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are plasma membrane-bound nano- and microparticles secreted by cells and known to play key roles in intercellular communication, often through transfer of biomolecular cargo. Advances in EV research have established techniques for EV isolation from tissue culture media or biofluids, as well as standards for quantitation and biomolecular characterization. EVs released by cardiac cells are known to be involved in regulating cardiac physiology as well as in the progression of myocardial diseases. Due to difficulty accessing the heart in vivo, advanced in vitro cardiac 'tissues-on-a-chip' have become a recent focus for studying EVs in the heart. These physiologically relevant models are producing new insight into the role of EVs in cardiac physiology and disease while providing a useful platform for screening novel EV-based therapeutics for cardiac tissue regeneration post-injury.

{"title": "What gets on the nerves of cardiac patients? Pathophysiological changes in cardiac innervation.", "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system regulates cardiac function by balancing the actions of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs to the heart. Intrinsic cardiac neurocircuits integrate these autonomic signals to fine-tune cardiac control, and sensory feedback loops regulate autonomic transmission in the face of external stimuli. These interconnected neural systems allow the heart to adapt to constantly changing circumstances that range from simple fluctuations in body position to running a marathon. The cardiac reflexes that serve to maintain homeostasis in health are disrupted in many disease states. This is often characterized by increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic transmission. Studies of cardiovascular disease reveal remodelling of cardiac neurocircuits at several functional and anatomical levels. Central circuits change so that sympathetic pathways become hyperactive, while parasympathetic circuits exhibit decreased activity. Peripheral sensory nerves also become hyperactive in disease, which increases patients' risk for poor cardiac outcomes. Injury and disease also alter the types of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides released by autonomic nerves in the heart, and can lead to regional hyperinnervation (increased nerve density) or denervation (decreased nerve density) of cardiac tissue. The mechanisms responsible for neural remodelling are not fully understood, but neurotrophins and inflammatory cytokines are likely involved. Areas of active investigation include the role of immune cells and inflammation in neural remodelling, as well as the role of glia in modulating peripheral neuronal activity.

The binding between the molecules was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Based on confirmation that early myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (myocardial ischemia/reperfusion for 6 hours, IR6h) promoted myocardial apoptosis and inflammatory response, we found that Nrf2, cooperating with Programmed Cell Death 4, promoted transcription initiation of C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 3 (Ccl3) in myocardial tissues of mice treated with IR6h. Moreover, Ccl3 contributed to the high signature score of C-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (Ccr1)-positive macrophages.

Ticagrelor and enoxaparin, which are antiaggregant and anticoagulant drugs developed for use in many cardiovascular pathologies, are still included in many ischemia/reperfusion studies. Remarkably, their new protective effects, especially with regard to ticagrelor, continue to be reported in the current literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of ticagrelor and enoxaparin pretreatments on the rat heart with histological and immunohistochemical markers in an ischemia/reperfusion model.\nWistar-albino rats (weighing 350-400 g) were divided into four groups as follows: Sham-Control (Group 1), Control-Saline+ischemia/reperfusion (Group 2), Ticagrelor+ischemia/reperfusion (Group 3), and Enoxaparin+ischemia/reperfusion (Group 4). The ischemia/reperfusion injury model was applied to Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4. Heart tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examinations. Caspase 3 immunostaining was evaluated to detect apoptosis in the heart tissue sections.\nBoth pretreatments ameliorated the ischemic damage but especially tissue sections belonging to Group 3 were nearly similar to control levels. The results indicated that ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial damage was significantly increased in Group 2, whereas ticagrelor and enoxaparin pretreatments in Group 3 and Group 4 significantly decreased apoptotic scores and the histological appearance of the Group 3 close to the normal myocardium (p<0.001).\nAs supported by histological findings in our study, ticagrelor and enoxaparin have protective properties for heart tissue in this ischemia/reperfusion injury model.", "journal": "Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992)", "date": "2021-12-16", "authors": ["OrhanF\u0131nd\u0131k", "OzgurBaris", "YusufhanYazir", "Melda YardimogluYilmaz", "Selenay FuratRencber", "K\u00fcbra KavramSarihan", "Atike TekeliKunt"], "doi": "10.1590/1806-9282.20210477"}

The conventional approach to identify the disease-causing genes focuses on screening genes that display heart-specific expression during development. However, this approach would have discounted genes that are expressed widely in other tissues but may play critical roles in heart development.\nWe report an efficient pipeline of genome-wide gene discovery based on the identification of a cardiac-specific cis-regulatory element signature that points to candidate genes involved in heart development and congenital heart disease. With this pipeline, we retrieve 76% of the known cardiac developmental genes and predict 35 novel genes that previously had no known connectivity to heart development. Functional validation of these novel cardiac genes by RNAi-mediated knockdown of the conserved orthologs in Drosophila cardiac tissue reveals that disrupting the activity of 71% of these genes leads to adult mortality. Among these genes, RpL14, RpS24, and Rpn8 are associated with heart phenotypes.\nOur pipeline has enabled the discovery of novel genes with roles in heart development.

{"title": "IGFBP-4 Proteolysis by PAPP-A in a Primary Culture of Rat Neonatal Cardiomyocytes under Normal and Hypertrophic Conditions.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is a matrix metalloprotease localized on the cell surface. One of the substrates that PAPP-A cleaves is the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4), a member of the family of proteins that bind insulin-like growth factor (IGF). Proteolysis of IGFBP-4 by PAPP-A occurs at a specific site resulting in formation of two proteolytic fragments - N-terminal IGFBP-4 (NT-IGFBP-4) and C-terminal IGFBP-4 (CT-IGFBP-4), and leads to the release of IGF activating various cellular processes including migration, proliferation, and cell growth. Increased levels of the proteolytic IGFBP-4 fragments correlate with the development of CVD complications and increased risk of death in patients with the coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure. However, there is no direct evidence that PAPP-A specifically cleaves IGFBP-4 in the cardiac tissue under normal and pathological conditions. In the present study, using a primary culture of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes as a model, we have demonstrated that: 1) proteolysis of IGFBP-4 by PAPP-A occurs in the conditioned medium of cardiomyocytes, 2) PAPP-A-specific IGFBP-4 proteolysis is increased when cardiomyocytes are transformed to a hypertrophic state. Thus, it can be assumed that the enhancement of IGFBP-4 cleavage by PAPP-A and hypertrophic changes in cardiomyocytes accompanying CVD are interrelated, and PAPP-A appears to be one of the activators of the IGF-dependent processes in normal and hypertrophic-state cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Biochemistry.

{"title": "Heart development and regeneration-a multi-organ effort.", "abstract": "Development of the heart, from early morphogenesis to functional maturation, as well as maintenance of its homeostasis are tasks requiring collaborative efforts of cardiac tissue and different extra-cardiac organ systems. The brain, lymphoid organs, and gut are among the interaction partners that can communicate with the heart through a wide array of paracrine signals acting at local or systemic level. Disturbance of cardiac homeostasis following ischemic injury also needs immediate response from these distant organs. Our hearts replace dead muscles with non-contractile fibrotic scars. We have learned from animal models capable of scarless repair that regenerative capability of the heart does not depend only on competency of the myocardium and cardiac-intrinsic factors but also on long-range molecular signals originating in other parts of the body. Here, we provide an overview of inter-organ signals that take part in development and regeneration of the heart. We highlight recent findings and remaining questions.

To investigate the effect of regular training, the rats were divided into non-exercise (NE), aerobic exercise (AE), resistance exercise (RE), and combined exercise (CE) groups (six rats per group). Regular training tailored to each exercise type was performed for 8\u00a0weeks (five times a week, 1\u00a0h per day). After 8\u00a0weeks of training, aerobic capacity was evaluated by a treadmill running test. Left ventricular muscle tissue was collected and the protein levels of angiogenesis indicators (eNOS, HIF-1\u03b1, PGC-1\u03b1, VEGF, FLK-1, Ang-1, Ang-2) were analyzed by Western blotting. Capillaries were observed by immunohistochemical staining for CD31.\nBody weight, heart weight, and heart/body weight ratio showed no difference among the groups. The AE and CE groups showed higher treadmill running capacity than the NE and RE groups. The eNOS, VEGF, HIF-1\u03b1, PGC-1\u03b1, and Ang-2 protein levels were significantly higher in the AE than NE group. The PGC-1\u03b1 and FLK-1 protein levels were significantly higher in the RE than NE group. In addition, in the CE group, the eNOS, FLK-1, and PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels were significantly higher than in the NE group.

Although there are some commonalities, the phenotype of such changes show tissue specific variation. Given this, we examined whether differences in circular RNA (circRNA) mediated gene regulatory mechanisms contribute to changes in gene expression at the basal level and in diabetes. CircRNAs are single-stranded RNA with covalently closed loop structures and act as miRNA sponges, factors of RNA splicing, scaffolding for proteins, regulators of transcription, and modulators of the expression of parental genes, among other roles. We examined heart and retinal tissue from Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice with established diabetes related tissue damage and tissue from non-diabetic controls. A custom array analysis was performed and the data were analysed. Two major circRNA mediated processes were uniquely upregulated in diabetic heart tissue, namely, positive regulation of endothelial cell migration and regulation of mitochondria: mitochondrial electron transport. In the retina, circRNAs regulating extracellular matrix protein production and endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) were found to be upregulated.

{"title": "N-Acetyl Cysteine, Selenium, and Ascorbic Acid Rescue Diabetic Cardiac Hypertrophy via Mitochondrial-Associated Redox Regulators.", "abstract": "Metabolic disorders often lead to cardiac complications. Metabolic deregulations during diabetic conditions are linked to mitochondrial dysfunctions, which are the key contributing factors in cardiac hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in diabetes-induced cardiac hypertrophy are poorly understood. In the current study, we initially established a diabetic rat model by alloxan-administration, which was validated by peripheral glucose measurement. Diabetic rats displayed myocardial stiffness and fibrosis, changes in heart weight/body weight, heart weight/tibia length ratios, and enhanced size of myocytes, which altogether demonstrated the establishment of diabetic cardiac hypertrophy (DCH). Furthermore, we examined the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial signaling impairment. Our data show that the expression of PGC-1\u03b1, cytochrome c, MFN-2, and Drp-1 was deregulated. Mitochondrial-signaling impairment was further validated by redox-system dysregulation, which showed a significant increase in ROS and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, both in serum and heart tissue, whereas the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione levels were decreased. Additionally, the expression levels of pro-apoptotic gene PUMA and stress marker GATA-4 genes were elevated, whereas ARC, PPAR\u03b1, and Bcl-2 expression levels were decreased in the heart tissues of diabetic rats. Importantly, these alloxan-induced impairments were rescued by N-acetyl cysteine, ascorbic acid, and selenium treatment. This was demonstrated by the amelioration of myocardial stiffness, fibrosis, mitochondrial gene expression, lipid profile, restoration of myocyte size, reduced oxidative stress, and the activation of enzymes associated with antioxidant activities. Altogether, these data indicate that the improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction by protective agents such as N-acetyl cysteine, selenium, and ascorbic acid could rescue diabetes-associated cardiac complications, including DCH.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["IramMushtaq", "ZainabBashir", "MehvishSarwar", "MariaArshad", "AyeshaIshtiaq", "WajihaKhan", "UzmaKhan", "SobiaTabassum", "TahirAli", "TahzeebFatima", "HadiValadi", "MuhammadNawaz", "IramMurtaza"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules26237285\n10.1016/j.jtcme.2014.12.005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.315913\n10.1007/s00125-017-4390-4\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.10.074\n10.3906/sag-1308-25\n10.1186/s12929-016-0309-5\n10.1007/s13105-017-0576-y\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.679597\n10.1515/biolog-2015-0030\n10.1016/j.abb.2017.09.001\n10.3389/fphar.2014.00151\n10.1038/s41569-019-0260-8\n10.1097/WOX.0b013e3182439613\n10.1007/s40256-018-0275-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0023967\n10.3109/10715762.2011.605361\n10.1016/j.lfs.2008.12.016\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.06.033\n10.3390/nu11122850\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.11.033\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.07.008\n10.1016/j.abb.2018.11.007\n10.1186/s13098-018-0306-9\n10.3390/nu8050151\n10.3390/molecules18033292\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.08.023\n10.1186/s13620-021-00192-4\n10.1080/01635589209514179\n10.1111/bph.12516\n10.1093/cvr/cvq240\n10.1016/j.jcjd.2018.08.167\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.60.1.619\n10.1016/j.talanta.2013.04.051\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4401263\n10.1074/jbc.M207622200\n10.2337/diacare.28.9.2255\n10.1155/2017/7921363\n10.1016/0022-2828(79)90007-5\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.110456\n10.1073/pnas.0602543103\n10.1074/jbc.273.20.12593\n10.1038/nrendo.2015.216\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.04.006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302022\n10.1089/ars.2012.4550\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.02.003\n10.1093/hmg/ddq570\n10.1101/gad.1110003\n10.1016/j.ecl.2006.05.002\n10.1016/j.medici.2018.02.001\n10.1155/2017/1092015\n10.1007/BF03165800\n10.1254/jphs.CPJ06009X\n10.1152/ajpheart.00313.2002\n10.2337/diabetes.55.03.06.db05-1284\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00085.x\n10.1139/y99-101\n10.2337/diabetes.53.12.3201\n10.1152/ajpheart.00638.2005\n10.2337/diabetes.51.4.1166\n10.1016/S0142-1123(99)00052-3\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.2.H709\n10.1023/A:1015328625394\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000012466.50373.E8\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00047-3\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2005.03.005\n10.1038/tpj.2012.9\n10.1016/j.diabres.2013.01.008\n10.1096/fj.04-2263com\n10.1002/mrm.10372\n10.1073/pnas.97.4.1784\n10.1007/s11373-005-9024-z\n10.1155/2008/173780\n10.1080/07853890.2017.1417631\n10.1155/2021/9920826\n10.1016/j.jep.2021.114826\n10.1007/s11130-021-00932-5\n10.1300/J044v11n03_12\n10.1016/j.mrgentox.2007.04.006\n10.2298/ABS1003553J\n10.1038/nprot.2006.378\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00987.2016\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.594123"}

Here, we determined whether whole-life exposure to environmentally relevant, low-dose cadmium affects the susceptibility of offspring to post-weaning HFD-induced cardiac pathologies and function. Besides, we also determined whether these effects are sex-dependent. Male and female mice were exposed to cadmium-containing (0, 0.5, or 5 parts per million [ppm]) drinking water before breeding; the pregnant mice and dams with offspring continually drank the same cadmium-containing water. After weaning, the offspring were continued on the same regime as their parents and fed either a HFD or normal fat diet for 24\u00a0weeks. Cardiac function was examined with echocardiography. Cardiac tissues were used for the histopathological and biochemical (gene and protein expression by real-time PCR and Western blotting) assays. Results showed a dose-dependent cadmium accumulation in the hearts of male and female mice along with decreased cardiac zinc and copper levels only in female offspring. Exposure to 5\u00a0ppm, but not 0.5\u00a0ppm, cadmium significantly enhanced HFD cardiac effects only in female mice, shown by worsened cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction (ejection fraction, mitral E-to-annular e' ratio), increased fibrosis (collagen, fibronectin, collagen1A1), hypertrophy (cardiomyocyte size, atrial natriuretic peptide, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain), and inflammation (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1), compared to the HFD group. These synergistic effects were associated with activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway and increased oxidative stress, shown by 3-nitrotyrosine and malondialdehyde, along with decreased metallothionein expression. These results suggest that whole-life 5\u00a0ppm cadmium exposure significantly increases the susceptibility of female offspring to HFD-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction.

{"title": "In silico identification of potential calcium dynamics and sarcomere targets for recovering left ventricular function in rat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.", "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex disease associated with multiple co-morbidities, where impaired cardiac mechanics are often the end effect. At the cellular level, cardiac mechanics can be pharmacologically manipulated by altering calcium signalling and the sarcomere. However, the link between cellular level modulations and whole organ pump function is incompletely understood. Our goal is to develop and use a multi-scale computational cardiac mechanics model of the obese ZSF1 HFpEF rat to identify important biomechanical mechanisms that underpin impaired cardiac function and to predict how whole-heart mechanical function can be recovered through altering cellular calcium dynamics and/or cellular contraction. The rat heart was modelled using a 3D biventricular biomechanics model. Biomechanics were described by 16 parameters, corresponding to intracellular calcium transient, sarcomere dynamics, cardiac tissue and hemodynamics properties. The model simulated left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loops that were described by 14 scalar features. We trained a Gaussian process emulator to map the 16 input parameters to each of the 14 outputs. A global sensitivity analysis was performed, and identified calcium dynamics and thin and thick filament kinetics as key determinants of the organ scale pump function. We employed Bayesian history matching to build a model of the ZSF1 rat heart. Next, we recovered the LV function, described by ejection fraction, peak pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise and isovolumetric relaxation time constant. We found that by manipulating calcium, thin and thick filament properties we can recover 34%, 28% and 24% of the LV function in the ZSF1 rat heart, respectively, and 39% if we manipulate all of them together. We demonstrated how a combination of biophysically based models and their derived emulators can be used to identify potential pharmacological targets. We predicted that cardiac function can be best recovered in ZSF1 rats by desensitising the myofilament and reducing the affinity to intracellular calcium concentration and overall prolonging the sarcomere staying in the active force generating state.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2021-12-07", "authors": ["StefanoLongobardi", "AnnaSher", "Steven ANiederer"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009646\n10.1007/s11886-020-01349-3\n10.1007/s12471-016-0815-9\n10.1098/rsta.2019.0334\n10.1093/cvr/cvx087\n10.1113/JP273879\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.231928\n10.1016/j.media.2011.06.010\n10.1007/s10439-012-0593-5\n10.1115/1.2894084\n10.1109/TBME.2011.2112359\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2373399\n10.1152/ajpregu.1991.261.1.R126\n10.1016/j.ress.2005.11.025\n10.1016/S0378-4754(00)00270-6\n10.1016/j.cpc.2009.09.018\n10.21105/joss.00097\n10.12793/tcp.2019.27.1.12\n10.1161/01.RES.80.2.261\n10.1002/cpt.1184\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010818-021136\n10.1016/j.hfc.2014.04.011\n10.1126/science.aad3456\n10.1038/s41467-017-00176-5\n10.1111/bph.14104\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2020.109645\n10.1016/S0002-9149(82)80010-6\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000013264.41234.24"}

{"title": "Novel Optics-Based Approaches for Cardiac Electrophysiology: A Review.", "abstract": "Optical techniques for recording and manipulating cellular electrophysiology have advanced rapidly in just a few decades. These developments allow for the analysis of cardiac cellular dynamics at multiple scales while largely overcoming the drawbacks associated with the use of electrodes. The recent advent of optogenetics opens up new possibilities for regional and tissue-level electrophysiological control and hold promise for future novel clinical applications. This article, which emerged from the international NOTICE workshop in 2018, reviews the state-of-the-art optical techniques used for cardiac electrophysiological research and the underlying biophysics. The design and performance of optical reporters and optogenetic actuators are reviewed along with limitations of current probes. The physics of light interaction with cardiac tissue is detailed and associated challenges with the use of optical sensors and actuators are presented. Case studies include the use of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and super-resolution microscopy to explore the micro-structure of cardiac cells and a review of two photon and light sheet technologies applied to cardiac tissue. The emergence of cardiac optogenetics is reviewed and the current work exploring the potential clinical use of optogenetics is also described. Approaches which combine optogenetic manipulation and optical voltage measurement are discussed, in terms of platforms that allow real-time manipulation of whole heart electrophysiology in open and closed-loop systems to study optimal ways to terminate spiral arrhythmias. The design and operation of optics-based approaches that allow high-throughput cardiac electrophysiological assays is presented. Finally, emerging techniques of photo-acoustic imaging and stress sensors are described along with strategies for future development and establishment of these techniques in mainstream electrophysiological research.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-12-07", "authors": ["M CarolineM\u00fcllenbroich", "AllenKelly", "CoreyAcker", "GilBub", "TobiasBruegmann", "AnnaDi

{"title": "Quantification of Myocyte Disarray in Human Cardiac Tissue.", "abstract": "Proper three-dimensional (3D)-cardiomyocyte orientation is important for an effective tension production in cardiac muscle. Cardiac diseases can cause severe remodeling processes in the heart, such as cellular misalignment, that can affect both the electrical and mechanical functions of the organ. To date, a proven methodology to map and quantify myocytes disarray in massive samples is missing. In this study, we present an experimental pipeline to reconstruct and analyze the 3D cardiomyocyte architecture in massive samples. We employed tissue clearing, staining, and advanced microscopy techniques to detect sarcomeres in relatively large human myocardial strips with micrometric resolution. Z-bands periodicity was exploited in a frequency analysis approach to extract the 3D myofilament orientation, providing an orientation map used to characterize the tissue organization at different spatial scales. As a proof-of-principle, we applied the proposed method to healthy and pathologically remodeled human cardiac tissue strips. Preliminary results suggest the reliability of the method: strips from a healthy donor are characterized by a well-organized tissue, where the local disarray is log-normally distributed and slightly depends on the spatial scale of analysis; on the contrary, pathological strips show pronounced tissue disorganization, characterized by local disarray significantly dependent on the spatial scale of analysis. A virtual sample generator is developed to link this multi-scale disarray analysis with the underlying cellular architecture. This approach allowed us to quantitatively assess tissue organization in terms of 3D myocyte angular dispersion and may pave the way for developing novel predictive models based on structural data at cellular resolution.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-12-07", "authors": ["FrancescoGiardini", "EricaLazzeri", "GiuliaVitale", "CeciliaFerrantini", "IreneCostantini", "Francesco SPavone", "CorradoPoggesi", "LeonardoBocchi", "LeonardoSacconi"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.750364\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.02.065\n10.1038/srep23756\n10.1186/s12968-015-0129-x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301704\n10.1152/ajpheart.00481.2009\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.09.064\n10.1186/s12968-020-00637-9\n10.1038/nature12107\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01391\n10.1038/srep09808\n10.2307/2335012\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01380\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2019.07.003\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004190\n10.1115/1.4034656\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043\n10.1111/joa.13058\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00239\n10.1016/j.jacep.2017.05.002\n10.1093/cvr/cvv275\n10.1016/j.jsb.2018.02.005\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007676\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.11.051\n10.1002/jmri.26912\n10.1038/s41598-020-71174-9\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2021.07.012\n10.1152/ajpcell.00094.2016\n10.1113/JP276200\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.12.001\n10.1016/S0734-189X(87)80186-X\n10.1117/1.JMI.7.2.023501\n10.2174/138161282104141204124129\n10.7554/eLife.58138\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01474\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00453-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000055314.10801.4F\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300309\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314505\n10.1038/nprot.2014.123\n10.1002/jmri.20473\n10.1016/j.media.2017.02.006\n10.1007/978-3-642-38899-618\n10.1038/s41467-020-17579-6"}
{"title": "Recent advances on bioengineering approaches for fabrication of functional engineered cardiac pumps: A review.", "abstract": "The field of cardiac tissue engineering has advanced over the past decades; however, most research progress has been limited to engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) at the microscale with minimal geometrical complexities such as 3D strips and patches. Although microscale ECTs are advantageous for drug screening applications because of their high-throughput and standardization characteristics, they have limited translational applications in heart repair and the in vitro modeling of cardiac function and diseases. Recently, researchers have made various attempts to construct engineered cardiac pumps (ECPs) such as chambered ventricles, recapitulating the geometrical complexity of the native heart. The transition from microscale ECTs to ECPs at a translatable scale would greatly accelerate their translational applications; however, researchers are confronted with several major hurdles, including geometrical reconstruction, vascularization, and functional maturation. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to review the recent advances on bioengineering approaches for fabrication of functional engineered cardiac pumps. We first review the bioengineering approaches to fabricate ECPs, and then emphasize the unmatched potential of 3D bioprinting techniques. We highlight key advances in bioprinting strategies with high cell density as researchers have begun to realize the critical role that the cell density of non-proliferative cardiomyocytes plays in the cell-cell interaction and functional contracting performance. We summarize the current approaches to engineering vasculatures both at micro- and meso-scales, crucial for the survival of thick cardiac tissues and ECPs. We showcase a variety of strategies developed to enable the functional maturation of cardiac tissues, mimicking the in vivo environment during cardiac development. By highlighting state-of-the-art research, this review offers personal perspectives on future opportunities and trends that may bring us closer to the promise of functional ECPs.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2021-12-06", "authors": ["YongcongFang", "WeiSun", "TingZhang", "ZhuoXiong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121298"}

Patients diagnosed with both NM and infantile cardiomyopathy are very rare. A male infant presented, within the first few hours of life, with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, biventricular dysfunction and left ventricular noncompaction. A muscle biopsy on the 8th day of life from the right sternocleidomastoid muscle identified nemaline rods. Whole exome sequencing identified a c.1288 delT (homozygous pathogenic variant) in the CAP2 gene (NM_006366), yielding a CAP2 protein (NP_006357.1) with a p.C430fs. Both parents were heterozygous for the same variant but have no history of heart or muscle disease. Analysis of patient derived fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells confirmed the p.C430fs mutation (pathogenic variant), which appears to cause loss of both CAP2 protein and mRNA. The CAP2 gene encodes cyclase associated protein 2, an actin monomer binding and filament depolymerizing protein and CAP2 knockout mice develop severe dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness. The patient underwent a heart transplant at 1 year of age. Heart tissue explanted at that time also showed nemaline rods and additionally disintegration of the myofibrillar structure. Other extra cardiac concerns include mild hypotonia, atrophic and widened scarring.

{"title": "Engineering the niche to differentiate and deploy cardiovascular cells.", "abstract": "Applications for stem cells have ranged from therapeutic interventions to more conventional screening and in vitro modeling, but significant limitations to each is due to the lack of maturity from decades old monolayer protocols. While those methods remain the 'gold standard,' newer three-dimensional methods, when combined with engineered niche, stand to significantly improve cell maturity and enable new applications. Here in three parts, we first discuss past methods, and where and why we believe those methods produced suboptimal myocytes.

Organoids are in\u00a0vitro models that mimic organ formation and cellular heterogeneity, but lack the paracrine input of surrounding tissues. Here, we describe a human multilineage iPSC-derived organoid that recapitulates cooperative cardiac and gut development and maturation, with extensive cellular and structural complexity in both tissues. We demonstrate that the presence of endoderm tissue (gut/intestine) in the organoids contributed to the development of cardiac tissue features characteristic of stages after heart tube formation, including cardiomyocyte expansion, compartmentalization, enrichment of atrial/nodal cells, myocardial compaction, and fetal-like functional maturation.

The P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) receptor is an ATP-gated ion channel that is predominantly expressed in immune cells and plays a key role in inflammatory processes. We investigated the role of G-Rg1 in sepsis-related cardiac dysfunction and the underlying mechanism involving the regulation of the P2X7 receptor. We detected cell viability, cytotoxicity, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) with or without G-Rg1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9c2 cell models of ischemia/reperfusion injury. We applied cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce a mouse model of sepsis and measured the survival duration and cardiac function of CLP mice. Next, we quantified the ROS level, MMP, respiratory chain complex I-IV enzymatic activity, and mitochondrial fusion in CLP mouse heart tissues. We then investigated the role of G-Rg1 in repairing LPS-induced cell mitochondrial damage, including mitochondrial superoxidation products. The results showed that G-Rg1 inhibited LPS- or H/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cytotoxicity, ROS levels, and mitochondrial damage. In addition, G-Rg1 prolonged the survival time of CLP mice. G-Rg1 attenuated LPS-induced superoxide production in the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes and the excessive release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Most importantly, G-Rg1 suppressed LPS-mediated induction of proapoptotic Bax, activated Akt, induced GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, and balanced mitochondrial calcium levels.

{"title": "Navigating Calcium and Reactive Oxygen Species by Natural Flavones for the Treatment of Heart Failure.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF), the leading cause of death among men and women world-wide, causes great health and economic burdens. HF can be triggered by many factors, such as coronary artery disease, heart attack, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, obesity, etc., all of which have close relations with calcium signal and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Calcium is an essential second messenger in signaling pathways, playing a pivotal role in regulating the life and death of cardiomyocytes via the calcium-apoptosis link mediated by the cellular level of calcium. Meanwhile, calcium can also control the rate of energy production in mitochondria that are the major resources of ROS whose overproduction can lead to cell death. More importantly, there are bidirectional interactions between calcium and ROS, and such interactions may have therapeutic implications in treating HF through finely tuning the balance between these two by certain drugs. Many naturally derived products, e.g., flavones and isoflavones, have been shown to possess activities in regulating calcium and ROS simultaneously, thereby leading to a balanced microenvironment in heart tissues to exert therapeutic efficacies in HF. In this mini review, we aimed to provide an updated knowledge of the interplay between calcium and ROS in the development of HF.

Here, we evaluated pyroptosis in MI patients in vitro and in vivo models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We also investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate pyroptosis and myocardial I/R injury in these in vitro and in vivo models. The study showed that MI patients exhibited elevated serum concentrations of the pyroptosis-related pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 as well as the pyroptosis-related inflammatory caspases (caspase-1 and 11) were detected in cultured cardiomyocytes after anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) and in cardiac tissues after I/R. Circ-NNT and USP46 were upregulated while miR-33a-5p was downregulated in MI patients, as well as in cultured cardiomyocytes after A/R and cardiac tissues after I/R. Circ-NNT or USP46 knockdown or miR-33a-5p overexpression inhibited the expression of pro-caspase-1, cleaved caspase-1, pro-caspase-11, cleaved caspase-11, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 in A/R cardiomyocytes and attenuated myocardial infarction in I/R mice. The results from luciferase reporter assays and gene overexpression/knockdown studies indicated that miR-33a-5p directly targets USP46, and circ-NNT regulates USP46 by acting as a miR-33a-5p sponge.

For KCNQ1, there is a decrease in the ratio of KCNQ1b to KCNQ1a between the <2-month (0.37 \u00b1 0.02; n = 46) and the 2- to 4-month (0.28 \u00b1 0.02; n = 52) age groups. When broken down by sex, race, or cause of death, there were no differences in SCN5A or KCNQ1 spliceoform expression, except for a higher ratio of KCNQ1b to KCNQ1a at 5-12 months of age for SUID females (0.40 \u00b1 0.04; n = 9) than for males (0.25 \u00b1 0.03; n = 6) and at <2 months of age for SUID white (0.42 \u00b1 0.03; n = 19) than for black (0.33 \u00b1 0.05; n = 9) infants.\nThis study documents the developmental changes in SCN5A and KCNQ1 spliceoforms in humans.

{"title": "Deep Learning Enables Discovery of a Short Nuclear Targeting Peptide for Efficient Delivery of Antisense Oligomers.", "abstract": "Therapeutic macromolecules such as proteins and oligonucleotides can be highly efficacious but are often limited to extracellular targets due to the cell's impermeable membrane. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are able to deliver such macromolecules into cells, but limited structure-activity relationships and inconsistent literature reports make it difficult to design effective CPPs for a given cargo. For example, polyarginine motifs are common in CPPs, promoting cell uptake at the expense of systemic toxicity. Machine learning may be able to address this challenge by bridging gaps between experimental data in order to discern sequence-activity relationships that evade our intuition. Our earlier data set and deep learning model led to the design of miniproteins (>40 amino acids) for antisense delivery. Here, we leveraged and expanded our model with data augmentation in the short CPP sequence space of the data set to extrapolate and discover short, low-arginine-content CPPs that would be easier to synthesize and amenable to rapid conjugation to desired cargo, and with minimal in vivo toxicity.

{"title": "Blackcurrant Improves Diabetic Cardiovascular Dysfunction by Reducing Inflammatory Cytokines in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Mice.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiovascular dysfunction is a representative complication of diabetes. Inflammation associated with the onset and exacerbation of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an essential factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular complications. Diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction is characterized by myocardial fibrosis, which includes structural heart changes, myocardial cell death, and extracellular matrix protein accumulation. The mice groups in this study were divided as follows: Cont, control (db/m mice); T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus mice (db/db mice); Vil.G, db/db + vildagliptin 50 mg/kg/day, positive control, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor; Bla.C, db/db + blackcurrant 200 mg/kg/day. In this study, Bla.C treatment significantly improved the homeostatic model evaluation of glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices and diabetic blood markers such as HbA1c in T2DM mice. In addition, Bla.C improved cardiac function markers and cardiac thickening through echocardiography. Bla.C reduced the expression of fibrosis biomarkers, elastin and type IV collagen, in the left ventricle of a diabetic cardiopathy model. Bla.C also inhibited TD2M-induced elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in cardiac tissue (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2). Thus, Bla.C significantly improved cardiac inflammation and cardiovascular fibrosis and dysfunction by blocking inflammatory cytokine activation signals. This showed that Bla.C treatment could ameliorate diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications in T2DM mice. These results provide evidence that Bla.C extract has a significant effect on the prevention of cardiovascular fibrosis, inflammation, and consequent diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications, directly or indirectly, by improving blood glucose profile.", "journal": "Nutrients", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["Hye-YoomKim", "Jung-JooYoon", "Hyeon-KyoungLee", "Ai-LinTai", "Yun-JungLee", "Dae-SungKim", "Dae-GillKang", "Ho-SubLee"], "doi": "10.3390/nu13114177\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.01911.x\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.148635\n10.2337/diacare.27.3.699\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9136(199712)14:5+<S7::AID-DIA522>3.0.CO;2-R\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.679597\n10.1007/s00726-001-0146-y\n10.1186/s12933-018-0703-2\n10.1016/j.cjca.2017.12.005\n10.1172/JCI92035\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.11.006\n10.1155/2013/931915\n10.2337/dcS15-3015\n10.3748/wjg.v24.i25.2673\n10.1016/j.pcad.2021.06.010\n10.1053/j.gastro.2006.05.054\n10.1111/1750-3841.14781\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2010.09.001\n10.1080/15287394.2013.850762\n10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601442\n10.1155/2015/385976\n10.1007/BF00280883\n10.1016/S2222-1808(14)60481-3\n10.5219/328\n10.1016/j.jff.2015.06.043\n10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31823c4242\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.02.017\n10.1126/science.153.3740.1127\n10.1186/s12968-016-0273-y\n10.1016/j.molmet.2019.04.010\n10.1016/j.cmet.2016.04.011\n10.1038/s42255-021-00414-7\n10.3390/nu11071438\n10.1097/MAJ.0000000000000292\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.128\n10.3109/13813455.2012.732580\n10.2337/diacare.27.6.1487\n10.1016/j.trsl.2012.01.009\n10.2337/diacare.27.8.1879\n10.1016/S1885-5857(09)73534-0\n10.4314/ahs.v18i3.28\n10.1007/s10557-020-07043-4\n10.1038/nri2925\n10.1126/science.271.5249.665\n10.1038/sj.ijo.0802187\n10.1152/ajpendo.00153.2015\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.033\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.05.010\n10.1093/cvr/cvs259\n10.2337/diacare.24.5.914"}

{"title": "Cardiac Cell Patterning on Customized Microelectrode Arrays for Electrophysiological Recordings.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes (CMs) and fibroblast cells are two essential elements for cardiac tissue structure and function. The interactions between them can alter cardiac electrophysiology and thus contribute to cardiac diseases, such as arrhythmogenesis. One possible explanation is that fibroblasts can directly affect cardiac electrophysiology through electrical coupling with CMs. Therefore, detecting the electrical activities in the CM-fibroblast network is vital for understanding the coupling dynamics among them. Current commercialized platforms for studying cardiac electrophysiology utilize planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) to record the extracellular field potential (FP) in real-time, but the prearranged electrode configuration highly limits the measurement capabilities at specific locations. Here, we report a custom-designed MEA device with a novel micropatterning method to construct a controlled network of neonatal rat CMs (rCMs) and fibroblast connections for monitoring the electrical activity of rCM-fibroblast co-cultures in a spatially controlled fashion. For the micropatterning of the co-culture, surface topographical features and mobile blockers were used to control the initial attachment locations of a mixture of rCMs and fibroblasts, to form separate beating rCM-fibroblast clusters while leaving empty space for fibroblast growth to connect these clusters. Once the blockers are removed, the proliferating fibroblasts connect and couple the separate beating clusters. Using this method, electrical activity of both rCMs and human-induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) was examined. The coupling dynamics were studied through the extracellular FP and impedance profile recorded from the MEA device, indicating that the fibroblast bridge provided an RC-type coupling of physically separate rCM-containing clusters and enabled synchronization of these clusters.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["JiayingJi", "XiangRen", "PinarZorlutuna"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12111351\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1997.tb06199.x\n10.1007/s12265-012-9408-1\n10.1159/000092566\n10.1007/s10557-017-6735-0\n10.3390/cells8111331\n10.1039/D0LC00809E\n10.1016/0956-5663(90)80011-2\n10.1016/0014-4827(72)90481-8\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.10.021\n10.1021/acs.analchem.9b01092\n10.1039/C7BM00171A\n10.7567/JJAP.57.03EB03\n10.1039/C9AN01339C\n10.1088/1758-5090/aaa15d\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002926\n10.1186/1477-3155-9-21\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01417.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.066092\n10.1007/s10616-006-6334-6\n10.1063/1.4978468\n10.1016/j.vascn.2009.02.005\n10.1002/aisy.202000253\n10.1371/journal.pone.0167348\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.09.007\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.022\n10.1039/b315648f\n10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74606-2\n10.1007/s13206-018-2308-y\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04152\n10.1155/2016/2634013\n10.1039/C8LC00694F\n10.1038/s41598-017-15506-2"}
{"title": "Quantitative Evaluation of Cardiac Cell Interactions and Responses to Cyclic Strain.", "abstract": "The heart has a dynamic mechanical environment contributed by its unique cellular composition and the resultant complex tissue structure. In pathological heart tissue, both the mechanics and cell composition can change and influence each other. As a result, the interplay between the cell phenotype and mechanical stimulation needs to be considered to understand the biophysical cell interactions and organization in healthy and diseased myocardium. In this work, we hypothesized that the overall tissue organization is controlled by varying densities of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in the heart. In order to test this hypothesis, we utilized a combination of mechanical strain, co-cultures of different cell types, and inhibitory drugs that block intercellular junction formation. To accomplish this, an image analysis pipeline was developed to automatically measure cell type-specific organization relative to the stretch direction. The results indicated that cardiac cell type-specific densities influence the overall organization of heart tissue such that it is possible to model healthy and fibrotic heart tissue in vitro. This study provides insight into how to mimic the dynamic mechanical environment of the heart in engineered tissue as well as providing valuable information about the process of cardiac remodeling and repair in diseased hearts.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["Richard Duc HienTran", "Tessa AltairMorris", "DanielaGonzalez", "Ali Hatem Salaheldin Hassan AhmedHetta", "AnnaGrosberg"], "doi": "10.3390/cells10113199\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a059928\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209809\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.10.002\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.08.020\n10.1177/2041731412455354\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.12.024\n10.3390/mi12040386\n10.1016/S0022-2828(08)80028-4\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.01.027\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.02.006\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.08.023\n10.1007/s11010-007-9445-2\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.6.H2726\n10.1093/cvr/5.1.118\n10.1161/01.CIR.45.4.769\n10.1161/01.CIR.63.4.882\n10.1002/jbm.a.36874\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.1517/14712598.2012.721770\n10.1039/c1lc20557a\n10.1016/j.matbio.2019.04.001\n10.1115/1.4044091\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.11.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.214429\n10.1371/journal.pone.0028963\n10.1103/RevModPhys.85.1327\n10.1529/biophysj.107.126060\n10.1103/PhysRevE.78.031923\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2014.06.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.01167.2011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227421\n10.1007/s00232-007-9046-8\n10.1242/jcs.221606\n10.1002/jcb.10390\n10.1017/S1431927608080021\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.005\n10.1152/ajpregu.00491.2007\n10.1038/ni.2017\n10.1038/nprot.2016.105\n10.1038/nmeth.1486\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.12.014\n10.1242/jcs.123604\n10.1038/nmeth.2097\n10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872394\n10.1038/s41592-019-0582-9\n10.1083/jcb.201610026\n10.1038/nmeth.4397\n10.1186/1471-2105-14-291\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007676\n10.1109/TSMC.1973.4309314\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139\n10.1152/ajpheart.1995.269.2.H571\n10.1152/ajpheart.1997.272.5.H2466\n10.1161/01.RES.63.3.577\n10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00330.x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.11.015\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.05.014\n10.3389/fphar.2013.00070\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036165\n10.3390/ijms19020604\n10.1111/j.1540-8175.2007.00460.x\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2009.06.063\n10.1042/CS20070066\n10.1016/j.echo.2010.10.020\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.10.061\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn141\n10.1161/01.RES.57.1.152\n10.1093/ejechocard/jeq060\n10.1016/j.echo.2004.06.019\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001088\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004190\n10.1115/1.4034656\n10.1016/j.bpj.2016.03.003\n10.1126/sciadv.abb8471\n10.1038/s41467-021-23482-5\n10.1109/TPAMI.2012.120\n10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b01825\n10.1023/A:1008009714131\n10.1109/34.56205\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043\n10.1109/34.709565\n10.1109/20.951344\n10.1080/15421406608083290"}
{"title": "Inherited and Acquired Rhythm Disturbances in Sick Sinus Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, and Atrial Fibrillation: Lessons from Preclinical Modeling.", "abstract": "Rhythm disturbances are life-threatening cardiovascular diseases, accounting for many deaths annually worldwide. Abnormal electrical activity might arise in a structurally normal heart in response to specific triggers or as a consequence of cardiac tissue alterations, in both cases with catastrophic consequences on heart global functioning. Preclinical modeling by recapitulating human pathophysiology of rhythm disturbances is fundamental to increase the comprehension of these diseases and propose effective strategies for their prevention, diagnosis, and clinical management. In silico, in vivo, and in vitro models found variable application to dissect many congenital and acquired rhythm disturbances. In the copious list of rhythm disturbances, diseases of the conduction system, as sick sinus syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and atrial fibrillation, have found extensive preclinical modeling. In addition, the electrical remodeling as a result of other cardiovascular diseases has also been investigated in models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac fibrosis, as well as arrhythmias induced by other non-cardiac pathologies, stress, and drug cardiotoxicity. This review aims to offer a critical overview on the effective ability of in silico bioinformatic tools, in vivo animal studies, in vitro models to provide insights on human heart rhythm

{"title": "Functional Inhibition of Valosin-Containing Protein Induces Cardiac Dilation and Dysfunction in a New Dominant-Negative Transgenic Mouse Model.", "abstract": "Valosin-containing protein (VCP) was found to play a vital protective role against cardiac stresses. Genetic mutations of VCP are associated with human dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the essential role of VCP in the heart during the physiological condition remains unknown since the VCP knockout in mice is embryonically lethal. We generated a cardiac-specific dominant-negative VCP transgenic (DN-VCP TG) mouse to determine the effects of impaired VCP activity on the heart. Using echocardiography, we showed that cardiac-specific overexpression of DN-VCP induced a remarkable cardiac dilation and progressively declined cardiac function during the aging transition. Mechanistically, DN-VCP did not affect the endogenous VCP (EN-VCP) expression but significantly reduced cardiac ATPase activity in the DN-VCP TG mouse hearts, indicating a functional inhibition. DN-VCP significantly impaired the aging-related cytoplasmic/nuclear shuffling of EN-VCP and its co-factors in the heart tissues and interrupted the balance of the VCP-cofactors interaction between the activating co-factors, ubiquitin fusion degradation protein 1 (UFD-1)/nuclear protein localization protein 4 (NPL-4) complex, and its inhibiting co-factor P47, leading to the binding preference with the inhibitory co-factor, resulting in functional repression of VCP. This DN-VCP TG mouse provides a unique functional-inactivation model for investigating VCP in the heart in physiological and pathological conditions.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["XiaonanSun", "NingZhou", "BenMa", "WenqianWu", "ShaunrickStoll", "LoLai", "GangjianQin", "HongyuQiu"], "doi": "10.3390/cells10112891\n10.1007/s11010-016-2746-6\n10.1080/19768354.2016.1259181\n10.1242/jcs.093831\n10.3390/ijms21113842\n10.3390/ijms22084167\n10.1016/j.molcel.2017.10.028\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107898\n10.1016/j.nmd.2009.01.009\n10.2174/156720511795563773\n10.1093/hmg/ddq050\n10.1074/jbc.RA119.007585\n10.1007/s12031-011-9627-y\n10.1002/mus.27097\n10.1111/acel.12653\n10.1038/s41598-020-75128-z\n10.18632/aging.101357\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101662\n10.1038/srep46324\n10.1093/toxsci/kfz164\n10.1093/cvr/cvt136\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.206\n10.1093/emboj/19.10.2181\n10.1083/jcb.200302169\n10.1038/s41598-020-70010-4\n10.1016/j.str.2015.10.027\n10.1016/j.febslet.2015.08.028\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600152\n10.1038/40411\n10.12688/f1000research.11683.1\n10.1038/s41594-018-0085-x\n10.1038/nsb972\n10.1074/jbc.M111.302778\n10.1016/S0014-5793(98)01232-0\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.10.019\n10.1016/j.str.2019.09.011\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.05.097\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.013847\n10.1093/cvr/cvw222\n10.1111/acel.12748\n10.1165/ajrcmb.11.1.8018332\n10.1038/ncomms2828\n10.1038/ncomms11020\n10.1074/jbc.M408695200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050490\n10.1091/mbc.e03-02-0111\n10.1091/mbc.9.1.131"}
{"title": "A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 2 Promotes Protection against Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of maladaptive cardiac remodeling and heart failure. In the damaged heart, loss of function is mainly due to cardiomyocyte death and remodeling of the cardiac tissue. The current study shows that A-kinase anchoring protein 2 (AKAP2) orchestrates cellular processes favoring cardioprotection in infarcted hearts. Induction of AKAP2 knockout (KO) in cardiomyocytes of adult mice increases infarct size and exacerbates cardiac dysfunction after MI, as visualized by increased left ventricular dilation and reduced fractional shortening and ejection fraction. In cardiomyocytes, AKAP2 forms a signaling complex with PKA and the steroid receptor co-activator 3 (Src3). Upon activation of cAMP signaling, the AKAP2/PKA/Src3 complex favors PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1). This results in the upregulation of ER-dependent genes involved in protection against apoptosis and angiogenesis, including Bcl2 and the vascular endothelial growth factor a (VEGFa). In line with these findings, cardiomyocyte-specific AKAP2 KO reduces Bcl2 and VEGFa expression, increases myocardial apoptosis and impairs the formation of new blood vessels in infarcted hearts. Collectively, our findings suggest that AKAP2 organizes a transcriptional complex that mediates pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic responses that protect infarcted hearts.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["DarkoMaric", "AleksandraPaterek", "MarionDelaunay", "Irene P\u00e9rezL\u00f3pez", "MiroslavArambasic", "DarioDiviani"], "doi": "10.3390/cells10112861\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000558\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001878\n10.1016/j.coph.2005.01.004\n10.1038/s41569-020-0403-y\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-011112-140204\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.262899\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-022420-112134\n10.1016/j.tips.2020.09.007\n10.1073/pnas.0710527105\n10.1111/jcmm.12365\n10.1038/sj.embor.7401081\n10.1073/pnas.1215219109\n10.1042/BST20190228\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311307\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000206\n10.1073/pnas.0701099104\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.047\n10.1038/nature03966\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.024\n10.3390/cells9010069\n10.1016/j.molcel.2011.01.030\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001266\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044805\n10.1038/s41598-018-25068-6\n10.1093/cvr/cvq155\n10.1016/j.molcel.2011.08.045\n10.1093/cvr/cvw221\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00558\n10.1371/journal.pone.0154076\n10.1074/jbc.273.11.6533\n10.1002/emmm.201100184\n10.1016/j.bone.2021.115875\n10.1530/ERC-15-0425\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00033.2007\n10.1177/002215540205000108\n10.1128/MCB.00887-12\n10.1093/cvr/cvw031\n10.1073/pnas.2011614117\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.04.021\n10.1073/pnas.0509717103\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5026\n10.1038/onc.2012.361\n10.1016/j.tcm.2010.05.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.00005.2005\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000128046.54681.97\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.70.113006.100518\n10.1128/MCB.19.2.1002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.207084\n10.1056/NEJM200003023420904\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313568\n10.1124/pharmrev.120.000086\n10.1074/jbc.M105348200\n10.1074/jbc.M212312200\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0855\n10.1186/s12885-015-1591-4\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2909\n10.1210/en.2007-1593\n10.1016/j.steroids.2011.11.005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048185\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135988\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.10.003\n10.1016/j.jsbmb.2017.03.021"}

Indeed, transplantation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) may have applications as a replacement for heart transplantation and conventional regenerative therapies. However, there are several challenges that still must be overcome for clinical applications, including large-scale production of hiPSCs and hiPSC-CMs, elimination of residual hiPSCs, purification of hiPSC-CMs, maturation of hiPSC-CMs, efficient engraftment of transplanted hiPSC-CMs, development of an injection device, and avoidance of post-transplant arrhythmia and immunological rejection. Thus, we developed several technologies based on understanding of the metabolic profiles of hiPSCs and hiPSC derivatives.

{"title": "Facile Fabrication of Three-Dimensional Hydrogel Film with Complex Tissue Morphology.", "abstract": "In this study, we proposed a simple and easy method for fabricating a three-dimensional (3D) structure that can recapitulate the morphology of a tissue surface and deliver biological molecules into complex-shaped target tissues. To fabricate the 3D hydrogel film structure, we utilized a direct tissue casting method that can recapitulate tissue structure in micro-/macroscale using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). A replica 3D negative mold was manufactured by a polyurethane acrylate (PUA)-based master mold. Then, we poured the catechol-conjugated alginate (ALG-C) solution into the mold and evaporated it to form a dried film, followed by crosslinking the film using calcium chloride. The ALG-C hydrogel film had a tensile modulus of 725.2 \u00b1 123.4 kPa and maintained over 95% of initial weight after 1 week without significant degradation. The ALG-C film captured over 4.5 times as much macromolecule (FITC-dextran) compared to alginate film (ALG). The cardiomyoblast cells exhibited high cell viability over 95% on ALG-C film. Moreover, the ALG-C film had about 70% of surface-bound lentivirus (1% in ALG film), which finally exhibited much higher viral transfection efficiency of GFP protein to C2C12 cells on the film than ALG film. In conclusion, we demonstrated a 3D film structure of biofunctionalized hydrogel for substrate-mediated drug delivery, and this approach could be utilized to recapitulate the complex-shaped tissues.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-11-26", "authors": ["Young-HyeonAn", "Su-HwanKim"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering8110164\n10.1039/C8CC09768B\n10.1038/nmat2515\n10.1021/am5011095\n10.1021/acsnano.5b06605\n10.1163/156856206774879180\n10.1089/scd.2013.0578\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0352\n10.1007/s10439-014-1071-z\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043\n10.1038/s41598-020-71816-y\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.567842\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.679688\n10.1038/s41551-018-0271-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316155\n10.1126/science.1147241\n10.1021/ja0284963\n10.1002/pola.28368\n10.1002/adma.200801222\n10.1021/acs.biomac.5b00852\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.04.057\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.10.024\n10.1039/C9CS00285E\n10.1016/j.msec.2020.111096\n10.1016/j.mtbio.2020.100079\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.070\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.05.069\n10.1016/j.mito.2010.12.007\n10.1007/s12289-012-1119-2\n10.1016/j.mee.2008.10.011\n10.1002/adma.201501099\n10.1039/C5TB00393H\n10.1002/adma.201501234\n10.1126/sciadv.1500758\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.1126/science.aav9051\n10.1089/tea.2007.0351\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.024\n10.1002/app.40018\n10.3390/foods7100170\n10.1016/j.foodhyd.2015.04.037\n10.1002/adfm.201500006\n10.1021/bm200464x\n10.1038/nbt.1504\n10.1021/jacs.5b09974\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00251\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.119905\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.03.013\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01062\n10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2009.05.011\n10.1021/ab5001673\n10.1038/ncomms7639\n10.1002/anie.201201495\n10.1038/gt.2011.84\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318183\n10.1016/j.pcad.2007.03.005\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.3109/10611869509059212\n10.1002/anie.201801063\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122211"}

{"title": "Transplantation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes for Cardiac Regenerative Therapy.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and bears an immense economic burden. Late-stage heart failure often requires total heart transplantation; however, due to donor shortages and lifelong immunosuppression, alternative cardiac regenerative therapies are in high demand. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, have emerged as a viable source of human cardiomyocytes for transplantation. Recent developments in several mammalian models of cardiac injury have provided strong evidence of the therapeutic potential of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CM), showing their ability to electromechanically integrate with host cardiac tissue and promote functional recovery. In this review, we will discuss recent developments in hPSC-CM differentiation and transplantation strategies for delivery to the heart. We will highlight the mechanisms through which hPSC-CMs contribute to heart repair, review major challenges in successful transplantation of hPSC-CMs, and present solutions that are being explored to address these limitations. We end with a discussion of the clinical use of hPSC-CMs, including hurdles to clinical translation, current clinical trials, and future perspectives on hPSC-CM transplantation.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2021-11-26", "authors": ["Sophia ESilver", "Ryan WBarrs", "YingMei"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2021.707890\n10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005375\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1016/j.hfc.2016.07.001\n10.1101/cshperspect.a015636\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.2225\n10.1155/2016/9451492\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.065\n10.1126/science.282.5391.1145\n10.1172/JCI200112131\n10.1210/er.2008-0031\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1126/science.1151526\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.04.005\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.03.001\n10.1038/nbt.1535\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227512\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.273144\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.12.008\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.02.026\n10.1161/JAHA.120.020402\n10.1016/j.scr.2007.06.001\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62041-X\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000151313.18547.A2\n10.1038/nbt1014\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131446\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.07.054\n10.1186/s13287-020-01673-z\n10.1038/srep19111\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.022\n10.1152/ajpheart.00688.2017\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.11.017\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.01.083\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf8781\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306985\n10.1186/s13019-016-0559-z\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120033\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0130\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310277\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1002/jbm.820271005\n10.1038/srep06716\n10.1038/s41598-017-08869-z\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.084343\n10.1097/TP.0000000000002384\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0151\n10.1007/978-3-319-56106-6_9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047904\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.015231\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aay1318\n10.1038/s41551-018-0229-7\n10.1172/JCI80575\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.07.012\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.2750\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aax2992\n10.1073/pnas.0812242106\n10.1073/pnas.0908381106\n10.1038/s42003-018-0202-8\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.04.005\n10.1007/s11886-019-1171-3\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1038/s41569-018-0007-y\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1038/s41587-019-0197-9\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.07.021\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.033\n10.1101/2021.02.15.431108\n10.1038/s41598-019-46409-z\n10.5966/sctm.2011-0038\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.09.008\n10.1177/1074248413520344\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.08.015\n10.1016/j.scr.2015.08.002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315305\n10.1038/d41586-020-01285-w\n10.1038/d41586-018-05278-8"}

However, the function and roles of circRNAs in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-induced cardiovascular disease remain poorly understood. Therefore, we sought to explore the circRNA expression profiles and predict their functions in OSA-induced cardiac injury with the use of bioinformatics analysis. The model of OSA was established in mouse treated by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) exposure. Then, we screened the circRNA profile using circRNA microarray. By comparing circRNA expression in three matched pairs of CIH-treated cardiac tissues and controls, differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in the CIH groups. Comparison of the selected circRNAs expression levels was performed between qRT-PCR and microarray. Meanwhile, we employed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses to predict the functions of these selected circRNAs. Finally, we constructed a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network based on the target prediction.

After one week, the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were randomly divided into control and barley seed extract subgroups namely N group (non-diabetic control rats), S group (seed extract treated non-diabetic rats), D group (diabetic control rats) and DS group (seed extract treated diabetic rats). After 6 weeks, all rats were sacrificed for histopathological analysis and specimens were stained routinely for histological studies. The abnormal histological signs significantly decreased in the DS group compared to D group. Also, protective effects of barley seed extract against histopathological changes were seen in S group compared to N group.These findings suggest that barley seed extract exerts a protective effect on different tissues in diabetes.", "journal": "European journal of translational myology", "date": "2021-11-26", "authors": ["MohsenNaseri", "Zahra KhalajSereshki", "BehnazGhavami", "Bagher MinaiiZangii", "MohammadKamalinejad", "Parvaneh MohseniMoghaddam", "MajidAsghari", "Seyed Abbas HashemiNejad", "FatemehEmadi", "FarzanehGhaffari"], "doi": "10.4081/ejtm.2022.10108"}
{"title": "Controllability and state feedback control of a cardiac ionic cell model.", "abstract": "A phenomenon called alternans, which is a beat-to-beat alternation in action potential (AP) duration, sometimes precedes fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Alternans-suppressing electrical stimulus protocols are often represented as perturbations to the dynamics of membrane potential or AP duration variables in nonlinear models of cardiac tissue. Controllability analysis has occasionally been applied to cardiac AP models to determine whether different control or perturbation strategies are capable of suppressing alternans or other unwanted behavior. Since almost all previous cardiac controllability studies have focused on low-dimensional models, we conducted the present study to assess controllability of a higher-dimensional model, specifically the Luo Rudy dynamic (LRd) model of a cardiac ventricular myocyte. Higher-dimensional models are of interest because they provide information on the influence of a wider range of measurable quantities, including ionic concentrations, on controllability. After computing modal controllability measures, we found that larger eigenvalues of a linearized LRd model were on average more strongly controllable through perturbations to calcium-ion concentrations compared with perturbations to other variables. When only membrane potential was adjusted, the best time to apply perturbations (in the sense of maximizing controllability of the largest alternans eigenvalue) was near the AP peak time for shorter cycle lengths. Controllability results were found to be similar for both the default model parameters and for an alternans-promoting parameter set. Additionally, we developed several alternans-suppressing state feedback controllers that were tested in simulations. For the scenarios examined, our controllability measures correctly predicted which strategies and perturbation timings would lead to better feedback controller performance.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2021-11-25", "authors": ["RyanVogt", "AnthonyGuzman", "ClarCharron", "LauraMu\u00f1oz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104909"}
{"title": "Effects of electrically conductive nano-biomaterials on regulating cardiomyocyte behavior for cardiac repair and regeneration.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) represents one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases, with a highly relevant and impactful role in public health. Despite the therapeutic advances of the last decades, MI still begets extensive death rates around the world. The pathophysiology of the disease correlates with cardiomyocyte necrosis, caused by an imbalance in the demand of oxygen to cardiac tissues, resulting from obstruction of the coronary flow. To alleviate the severe effects of MI, the use of various biomaterials exhibit vast potential in cardiac repair and regeneration, acting as native extracellular matrices. These hydrogels have been combined with nano sized or functional materials which possess unique electrical, mechanical, and topographical properties that play important roles in regulating phenotypes and the contractile function of cardiomyocytes even in adverse microenvironments. These nano-biomaterials' differential properties have led to substantial healing on in vivo cardiac injury models by promoting fibrotic scar reduction, hemodynamic function preservation, and benign cardiac remodeling. In this review, we discuss the interplay of the unique physical properties of electrically conductive nano-biomaterials, are able to manipulate the phenotypes and the electrophysiological behavior of cardiomyocytes in vitro, and can enhance heart regeneration in vivo. Consequently, the understanding of the decisive roles of the nano-biomaterials discussed in this review could be useful for designing novel nano-biomaterials in future research for cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study introduced and deciphered the understanding of the role of multimodal cues in recent advances of electrically conductive nano-biomaterials on cardiac tissue engineering. Compared with other review papers, which mainly describe these studies based on various types of electrically conductive nano-biomaterials, in this review paper we mainly discussed the interplay of the unique physical properties (electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, and topography) of electrically conductive nano-biomaterials, which would allow them to manipulate phenotypes and the electrophysiological behavior of cardiomyocytes in vitro and to enhance heart regeneration in vivo.

Yet, the effect of PFOS exposure on cardiac toxicity in adult rats has, to our knowledge, not been reported and the mechanism still remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the toxicity of PFOS on rat hearts and any associated mechanisms. Rats were exposed to 0 (control), 1 and 10 mg/kg PFOS every other day for 14 days. Body weight and heart weight were recorded. The serum levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin-T (cTn-T) in heart tissues were measured using biochemical assays. TUNEL staining and western blotting were applied to analyze levels of apoptosis in rat hearts. Pathological assessment and immunohistochemistry analysis of heart tissues were used to evaluate the levels of PFOS-induced cardiotoxicity and inflammatory infiltration. PFOS exposure at the dosage of 10 mg/kg significantly increased the percentage of heart to body weight; however, it did not alter the body weight. At 10 mg/kg, PFOS significantly increased expression levels of myocardial injury markers, such as cTn-T, LDH, CK and CK-MB, while 1 mg/kg PFOS upregulated the expression level of cTn-T in rats. Notably, cardiac fibrosis and myocardiac hypertrophy appeared in the 10 mg/kg PFOS group. In addition, TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased by exposure to 10 mg/kg PFOS in rat heart tissues. The protein expressions profiles of p53 and Bax were also significantly upregulated in the 10 mg/kg PFOS group. Inflammatory infiltration, detected by anaylzing expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, was significantly raised by 10 mg/kg PFOS exposure.

However, because of the observer variability, the diagnosis cannot be made objectively. Many studies have shown that Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy is non-invasive, observer-independent, and label-free when analyzing biological tissues. In this study, we used FTIR microspectroscopy in combination with intelligent algorithms to identify the pathological phases in human infarcted cardiac tissues, including ischemia, necrotic, granulation, and fibrotic stages. First, a comparison of infrared spectra corresponding to infarcted tissue pathological categories revealed various spectral properties. The results of unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear distinction between these four pathological stages and the normal stage. Then, to identify these five stages, an automatic artificial neural network (ANN) classifier was effectively created. Finally, two-dimensional pseudo-color images of two infarcted cardiac tissue sections visualized via the ANN classifier showed great agreement with their histological images.

These complexities make its numerical modeling computationally challenging, and therefore, the formation of an efficient computational approximation is important for studying cardiac propagation. In this paper, a reduced order modeling approach has been developed for the simplified cardiac monodomain model, which yields a significant reduction of the full order dynamics of the cardiac tissue, reducing the required computational resources. Additionally, the discrete empirical interpolation technique has been implemented to accurately estimate the nonlinearity of the ionic current of the cardiac monodomain scheme. The proper orthogonal decomposition technique has been utilized, which transforms a given dataset called 'snapshots' to a new coordinate system. The snapshots are computed first from the original system, and they encapsulate all the information observed over both time and parameter variations. Next, the proper orthogonal decomposition provides a reduced order basis for projecting the original solution onto a low-dimensional orthonormal subspace. Finally, a reduced set of unknowns of the forward problem is obtained for which the solution involves significant computational savings compared to that for the original system of unknowns. The efficiency of the model order reduction technique for finite difference solution of cardiac electrophysiology is examined concerning simulation time, error potential, activation time, maximum temporal derivative, and conduction velocity.

In this study, we fabricated a unique cantilever-based device, whose surface was structured with stress-assisted micro-wrinkles. The Au micro-wrinkle patterns on the cantilever surface helped the cardiomyocytes to grow similarly to those in the native cardiac tissues by aligning them and providing them a conductive surface, thereby enhancing the contractile properties of the cells. The patterned Au surface also enhanced the electrical conductivity during cell-to-cell interactions. Additionally, the expression levels of proteins related to intracellular adhesion and contraction significantly increased in the polymer cantilevers with metallic wrinkle patterns. The roles of the polymer cantilever in improving the electrical conductivity and force-sensing properties were confirmed. Thereafter, the cantilever's response to cardiotoxicity was evaluated by introducing drugs known to induce toxicity to cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 reduces parasitic cardiac load by decreasing inflammation in a murine model of early chronic Chagas disease.", "abstract": "Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin America and is widely distributed worldwide because of migration. In 30% of cases, after years of infection and in the absence of treatment, the disease progresses from an acute asymptomatic phase to a chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy, leading to heart failure and death. An inadequate balance in the inflammatory response is involved in the progression of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Current therapeutic strategies cannot prevent or reverse the heart damage caused by the parasite. Aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) is a pro-resolving mediator of inflammation that acts through N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). AT-RvD1 participates in the modification of cytokine production, inhibition of leukocyte recruitment and efferocytosis, macrophage switching to a nonphlogistic phenotype, and the promotion of healing, thus restoring organ function. In the present study, AT-RvD1 is proposed as a potential therapeutic agent to regulate the pro-inflammatory state during the early chronic phase of Chagas disease.\nC57BL/6 wild-type and FPR2 knock-out mice chronically infected with T. cruzi were treated for 20 days with 5 \u03bcg/kg/day AT-RvD1, 30 mg/kg/day benznidazole, or the combination of 5 \u03bcg/kg/day AT-RvD1 and 5 mg/kg/day benznidazole. At the end of treatment, changes in immune response, cardiac tissue damage, and parasite load were evaluated. The administration of AT-RvD1 in the early chronic phase of T. cruzi infection regulated the inflammatory response both at the systemic level and in the cardiac tissue, and it reduced cellular infiltrates, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and the parasite load in the heart tissue.\nAT-RvD1 was shown to be an attractive therapeutic due to its regulatory effect on the inflammatory response at the cardiac level and its ability to reduce the parasite load during early chronic T. cruzi infection, thereby preventing the chronic cardiac damage induced by the parasite.", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "date": "2021-11-17", "authors": ["IleanaCarrillo", "Rayane Aparecida NonatoRabelo", "C\u00e9sarBarbosa", "MarianaRates", "Sebasti\u00e1nFuentes-Retamal", "FabiolaGonz\u00e1lez-Herrera", "DanielaGuzm\u00e1n-Rivera", "HelenaQuintero", "UlrikeKemmerling", "ChristianCastillo", "Fabiana SMachado", "GuillermoD\u00edaz-Araya", "Juan DMaya"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0009978\n10.1590/s0074-02762007000900018\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31612-4\n10.1016/j.idc.2018.10.015\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01929\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-020117-043711\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0006814\n10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100694\n10.1016/j.cmi.2018.06.006\n10.1007/s40264-018-0696-5\n10.1111/bcp.14700\n10.1016/j.mam.2017.03.001\n10.1007/s11745-004-1339-7\n10.1172/JCI97943\n10.1074/jbc.M609212200\n10.1038/nature13479\n10.3389/fmicb.2018.01961\n10.1007/s00436-013-3444-x\n10.1016/j.exppara.2017.09.019\n10.1128/AAC.02752-14\n10.1096/fj.12-223982\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.02.058\n10.1128/IAI.00052-20\n10.1128/AAC.02137-16\n10.1093/nar/29.9.e45\n10.1093/ofid/ofz012\n10.1016/j.gheart.2015.07.001\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002173\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2021.104427\n10.1155/2014/893634\n10.1016/j.micinf.2010.03.016\n10.1093/femspd/ftv082\n10.3389/fmicb.2018.00553\n10.4049/jimmunol.1003845\n10.1017/S0031182010001411\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.03.042\n10.1111/pim.12107\n10.1161/01.cir.102.24.3003\n10.1074/jbc.M112.348599\n10.4049/jimmunol.174.5.2934\n10.1615/critrevimmunol.v32.i1.30\n10.1111/pim.12183\n10.1371/journal.pone.0087082\n10.1128/IAI.73.12.7960-7966.2005\n10.1007/s11033-020-06133-8\n10.1016/j.taap.2014.03.017\n10.4049/jimmunol.1101305\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01273\n10.1242/jcs.131003\n10.4049/jimmunol.1700315\n10.1073/pnas.1410851111\n10.1177/1753425916628618\n10.4049/jimmunol.167.6.3422\n10.1016/j.ijpddr.2015.12.001\n10.1128/AAC.49.4.1521-1528.2005\n10.1590/0074-02760160334\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.01267\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.06.033\n10.1128/AAC.05135-11\n10.1056/NEJMoa1507574\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.10.098\n10.1016/j.bjid.2020.08.007\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002034\n10.1128/IAI.71.8.4441-4447.2003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.04.003\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.076\n10.1186/s13071-018-2614-1\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000079174.13444.9C\n10.1645/GE-2396.1\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.01863"}

This study focused on the role of CCR5 in myocardial injury in rats with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the mechanism of action.\nA rat model of DCM was induced by streptozotocin (STZ). CCR5 was knocked down in rats to determine its role in myocardial injury and immune cell infiltration. The upstream regulators of CCR5 were bioinformatically predicted and the binding between nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2) and CCR5 was validated. The portion of M1 and M2 macrophages in tissues was determined by flow cytometry or double-labeling immunofluorescence. Rat bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were treated with granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF/M-CSF) and co-cultured with H9C2 cells for in vitro experiments.\nSTZ-treated rats had impaired cardiac function and increased levels of creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin I and lactate dehydrogenase. CCR5 inhibition significantly alleviated myocardial injury in rats and reduced the portion of M1 macrophages in rat cardiac tissues. NR4A2, which could suppress CCR5 transcription, was poorly expressed in rats with DCM. NR4A2 overexpression played a similar myocardium-protective role in rats. In vitro, overexpression of NR4A2 induced M2 polarization of macrophages, which protected the co-cultured H9C2 cells from high glucose-induced damage, but the protective role was blocked after CCR5 overexpression.\nThis study demonstrated that NR4A2 suppresses CCR5 expression and promotes M2 polarization of macrophages to alleviate cardiomyocyte loss and myocardial injury.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2021-11-15", "authors": ["HuangtaiMiao", "XiaoyingLi", "CanZhou", "YingLiang", "DeshunLi", "QingweiJi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2021.104279"}

Mitochondrial energy derangements occur both during early fetal development and in patients with HF. Here we aim to elucidate the role of DIO2, a member of the fetal-gene-program, in pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived human cardiomyocytes and on mitochondrial dynamics and energetics, specifically. RNA sequencing and pathway enrichment analysis was performed on mouse cardiac tissue at different time points during development, adult age, and ischemia-induced HF. To determine the function of DIO2 in cardiomyocytes, a stable human hPSC-line with a DIO2 knockdown was made using a short harpin sequence. Firstly, we showed the selenoprotein, type II deiodinase (DIO2): the enzyme responsible for the tissue-specific conversion of inactive (T4) into active thyroid hormone (T3), to be a member of the fetal-gene-program. Secondly, silencing DIO2 resulted in an increased reactive oxygen species, impaired activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, severely impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced cellular viability. Microscopical 3D reconstruction of the mitochondrial network displayed substantial mitochondrial fragmentation. Summarizing, we identified DIO2 to be a member of the fetal-gene-program and as a key regulator of mitochondrial performance in human cardiomyocytes.

However, the therapeutic options for such complications have yielded disappointing results in clinical applications. Here, we reported that gut microbiota-derived l-Histidine and its secondary metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP) fought against radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injury in an entiric flora-dependent manner in mouse models. Local chest irradiation decreased the level of l-Histidine in fecal pellets, which was increased following fecal microbiota transplantation. l-Histidine replenishment via an oral route retarded the pathological process of lung and heart tissues and improved lung respiratory and heart systolic function following radiation exposure. l-Histidine preserved the gut bacterial taxonomic proportions shifted by total chest irradiation but failed to perform radioprotection in gut microbiota-deleted mice. ImP, the downstream metabolite of l-Histidine, accumulated in peripheral blood and lung tissues following l-Histidine replenishment and protected against radiation-induced lung and heart toxicity. Orally gavaged ImP could not enter into the circulatory system in mice through an antibiotic cocktail treatment. Importantly, ImP inhibited pyroptosis to nudge lung cell proliferation after radiation challenge.

{"title": "Esophageal Findings in the Setting of a Novel Preventive Strategy to Avoid Thermal Lesions during Hybrid Thoracoscopic Radiofrequency Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation.", "abstract": "Purpose The development of an atrio-esophageal fistula, a rare yet potentially lethal complication of ablation for atrial fibrillation, could be related to direct tissue heat transfer during and immediately after the ablation. We therefore studied the postoperative esophageal findings by esophagogastroduodenoscopy in patients that underwent a hybrid ablation procedure using a novel preventive strategy to avoid thermal lesions. Methods Thirty-four patients (28 males; 65 years \u00b1 9 years) were retrospectively included. All underwent a hybrid ablation in our center between April 2015 and November 2019 and agreed to an esophagogastroduodenoscopy within 0-14 days (mean: 5 days) following the ablation. To reduce the incidence of thermal lesions three procedural preventive strategies were introduced: (i) videoscopic intrathoracic transesophageal echocardiographic probe visualization to understand the relationship between posterior left atrial wall and esophagus, with probe retraction before ablation; (ii) lifting the cardiac tissue away from the esophagus during energy application; and (iii) a 30-s cool-off period after energy delivery with irrigation of the device, the ablated tissue, and the surrounding tissues. Results No esophageal thermal lesions were observed. One third of patients were diagnosed with incidental esophageal findings unrelated to the ablation procedure (11; 32.4%). Conclusion Novel preventive strategies by visualization and by avoiding contact between the ablation catheter or ablated tissue and the pericardium, seems to eliminate the potential risk of esophageal thermal lesions in the setting of hybrid ablation.

{"title": "Vanadium Induces Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Quality Control Disorder in the Heart of Ducks.", "abstract": "Vanadium (V) is an ultra-trace element presenting in humans and animals, but excessive V can cause toxic effects. Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) is an essential process for maintaining mitochondrial functions, but the relationship between V toxicity and MQC is unclear. To investigate the effects of excessive V on oxidative stress and MQC in duck hearts, 72 ducks were randomly divided into two groups, including the control group and the V group (30 mg of V/kg dry matter). The cardiac tissues were collected for the histomorphology observation and oxidative stress status evaluation at 22 and 44 days. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of MQC-related factors were also analyzed. The results showed that excessive V could trigger vacuolar degeneration, granular degeneration, as well as mitochondrial vacuolization and swelling in myocardial cells. In addition, CAT activity was elevated in two time points, while T-SOD activity was increased in 22 days but decreased in 44 days after V treatment.

While the lung remains the primary target site of COVID-19 injury, damage to myocardium, and other organs also contribute to the morbidity and mortality of this disease. There is also increasing demand to visualize viral components within tissue specimens. Here we discuss the cardiac autopsy findings of 12 intensive care unit (ICU) na\u00efve and PCR-positive COVID-19 cases using a combination of histological, Immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent and molecular techniques. We performed SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR on fresh tissue from all cases; RNA-ISH and IHC for SARS-CoV-2 were performed on selected cases using FFPE tissue from heart. Eight of these patients also had positive post-mortem serology for SARS-CoV-2. Histopathologic changes in the coronary vessels and inflammation of the myocardium as well as in the endocardium were documented which support the reports of a cardiac component to the viral infection. As in the pulmonary reports, widespread platelet and fibrin thrombi were also identified in the cardiac tissue.

Therefore, there is a rising need to move towards models capable of promoting an adult-like cardiomyocytes phenotype. Many strategies have been applied such as co-culture of cardiomyocytes, with fibroblasts and endothelial cells, or conditioning them through biochemical factors and physical stimulations. Here, we focus on mechanical stimulation as it aims to mimic the different mechanical forces that heart receives during its development and the post-natal period. We describe the current strategies and the mechanical properties necessary to promote a positive response in cardiac tissues from different cell sources, distinguishing between passive stimulation, which includes stiffness, topography and static stress and active stimulation, encompassing cyclic strain, compression or perfusion.

{"title": "Tools for studying and modulating (cardiac muscle) cell mechanics and mechanosensing across the scales.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes generate force for the contraction of the heart to pump blood into the lungs and body. At the same time, they are exquisitely tuned to the mechanical environment and react to e.g. changes in cell and extracellular matrix stiffness or altered stretching due to reduced ejection fraction in heart disease, by adapting their cytoskeleton, force generation and cell mechanics. Both mechanical sensing and cell mechanical adaptations are multiscale processes. Receptor interactions with the extracellular matrix at the nanoscale will lead to clustering of receptors and modification of the cytoskeleton. This in turn alters mechanosensing, force generation, cell and nuclear stiffness and viscoelasticity at the microscale. Further, this affects cell shape, orientation, maturation and tissue integration at the microscale to macroscale. A variety of tools have been developed and adapted to measure cardiomyocyte receptor-ligand interactions and forces or mechanics at the different ranges, resulting in a wealth of new information about cardiomyocyte mechanobiology.

{"title": "Bidomain modeling of electrical and mechanical properties of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Throughout the history of cardiac research, there has been a clear need to establish mathematical models to complement experimental studies. In an effort to create a more complete picture of cardiac phenomena, the bidomain model was established in the late 1970s to better understand pacing and defibrillation in the heart. This mathematical model has seen ongoing use in cardiac research, offering mechanistic insight that could not be obtained from experimental pursuits. Introduced from a historical perspective, the origins of the bidomain model are reviewed to provide a foundation for researchers new to the field and those conducting interdisciplinary research. The interplay of theory and experiment with the bidomain model is explored, and the contributions of this model to cardiac biophysics are critically evaluated. Also discussed is the mechanical bidomain model, which is employed to describe mechanotransduction. Current challenges and outstanding questions in the use of the bidomain model are addressed to give a forward-facing perspective of the model in future studies.", "journal": "Biophysics reviews",

{"title": "Anthelmintic niclosamide attenuates pressure-overload induced heart failure in mice.", "abstract": "The heart is a high energy demand organ and enhancing mitochondrial function is proposed as the next-generation therapeutics for heart failure. Our previous study found that anthelmintic drug niclosamide enhanced mitochondrial respiration and increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in cardiomyocytes, therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of niclosamide on heart failure in mice and the potential molecular mechanisms. The heart failure model was induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. Oral administration of niclosamide improved TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Oral administration of niclosamide reduced TAC-induced increase of serum IL-6 in heart failure mice. In vitro, niclosamide within 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM increased mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in mice heart tissues. At the concentrations more than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM, niclosamide reduced the increased interleukin- 6 (IL-6) mRNA expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 and THP-1 derived macrophages. In cultured primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, niclosamide (more than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM) suppressed IL-6- and phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and inhibited collagen secretion from cardiac fibroblasts. In conclusion, niclosamide attenuates heart failure in mice and the underlying mechanisms include enhancing mitochondrial respiration of cardiomyocytes, inhibiting collagen secretion from cardiac fibroblasts, and reducing the elevated serum inflammatory mediator IL-6.

{"title": "Cardiomyocyte protein O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by GFAT1 not GFAT2.", "abstract": "In response to cardiac injury, increased activity of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) is linked with cytoprotective as well as adverse effects depending on the type and duration of injury. Glutamine-fructose amidotransferase (GFAT; gene name gfpt) is the rate-limiting enzyme that controls flux through HBP. Two protein isoforms exist in the heart called GFAT1 and GFAT2. There are conflicting data on the relative importance of GFAT1 and GFAT2 during stress-induced HBP responses in the heart. Using neonatal rat cardiac cell preparations, targeted knockdown of GFPT1 and GFPT2 were performed and HBP activity measured. Immunostaining with specific GFAT1 and GFAT2 antibodies was undertaken in neonatal rat cardiac preparations and murine cardiac tissues to characterise cell-specific expression. Publicly available human heart single cell sequencing data was interrogated to determine cell-type expression. Western blots for GFAT isoform protein expression were performed in human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). GFPT1 but not GFPT2 knockdown resulted in a loss of stress-induced protein O-GlcNAcylation in neonatal cardiac cell preparations indicating reduced HBP activity. In rodent cells and tissue, immunostaining for GFAT1 identified expression in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts whereas immunostaining for GFAT2 was only identified in fibroblasts. Further corroboration of findings in human heart cells identified an enrichment of GFPT2 gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts but not ventricular myocytes whereas GFPT1 was expressed in both myocytes and fibroblasts. In human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, only GFAT1 protein was expressed with an absence of GFAT2. In conclusion, these results indicate that GFAT1 is the primary cardiomyocyte isoform and GFAT2 is only present in cardiac fibroblasts. Cell-specific isoform expression may have differing effects on cell function and should be considered when studying HBP and GFAT functions in the heart.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2021-11-05", "authors": ["Adam ANabeebaccus", "SharwariVerma", "AnnaZoccarato", "GiuliaEmanuelli", "Celio XcSantos", "KatrinStreckfuss-B\u00f6meke", "Ajay MShah"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.10.056"}

To understand the mechanism of RBM20-associated DCM, we engineered isogenic iPSCs with DCM-associated missense mutations in RBM20 as well as RBM20 knockout (KO) iPSCs. iPSC-derived engineered heart tissues made from these cell lines recapitulate contractile dysfunction of RBM20-associated DCM and reveal greater dysfunction with missense mutations than KO. Analysis of RBM20 RNA binding by eCLIP reveals a gain-of-function preference of mutant RBM20 for 3' UTR sequences that are shared with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and processing-body associated RNA binding proteins (FUS, DDX6). Deep RNA sequencing reveals that the RBM20 R636S mutant has unique gene, splicing, polyadenylation and circular RNA defects that differ from RBM20 KO. Super-resolution microscopy verifies that mutant RBM20 maintains very limited nuclear localization potential; rather, the mutant protein associates with cytoplasmic processing bodies (DDX6) under basal conditions, and with stress granules (G3BP1) following acute stress.

Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate hematological parameters, biomarkers of cardiac function and D-dimer in 13 cattle infected with B. bigemina which were unresponsive to standard treatment. The animals were necropsied and the cardiac tissue was examined for histopathologic alterations. A significant parasitemia burden-dependent increase in the cardiac biomarkers and D-dimer level were recorded in the infected cattle compared to the control animals. Thrombocytes count was also significantly lower in the infected animals than the control. Both macroscopic and microscopic hemorrhage, mononuclear infiltrates, and myocardial necrosis were the evident histopathologic findings.

{"title": "Beclin1 controls caspase-4 inflammsome activation and pyroptosis in mouse myocardial reperfusion-induced microvascular injury.", "abstract": "Myocardial reperfusion injury is often accompanied by cell death and inflammatory reactions. Recently, pyroptosis is gradually recognized as pivotal role in cardiovascular disease. However, little is known about the regulatory role of beclin1 in the control of caspase-4 activation and pyroptosis. The present study confirmed whether beclin1 regulates caspase-4 mediated pyroptosis and thereby protects Human Cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) against injury.\nTTC and Evan's blue dye, western blot, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining were performed in wild mice and transgenic mice with overexpression of beclin\u00a01(BECN1-Tg). CMECs were transfected with a beclin1 lentivirus. The cell cytotoxicity was analyzed by LDH-Cytotoxicity Assay Kit. The protein levels of autophagy protein (Beclin1, p62 and LC3II/LC3I) and caspase-4/GSDMD pathway were determined by western blot. Autophagic vacuoles in cells were monitored with RFP-GFP-LC3 using fluorescence microscope.\nI/R caused caspase-4 activity and gasdermin D expression increase in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of beclin1 in heart tissue and CMECs suppressed the caspase-4 activity and decreased the levels of gasdermin D; meanwhile beclin1 overexpression also reduced IL-1\u03b2 levels, promoted autophagy (p62 expression was inhibited while LC3II expression was increased) in the heart and CMECs. Interestingly, beclin1 overexpression increased animal survival and attenuated myocardial infarct size (45\u2009\u00b1\u20096.13 vs 22\u2009\u00b1\u20094.37), no-reflow area (39\u2009\u00b1\u20095.22 vs 16\u2009\u00b1\u20092.54) post-myocardial ischemia reperfusion.\nInduction of beclin-1 signaling can be a potential therapeutic target in myocardial reperfusion-induced microvascular injury.

Although some genes have been investigated by individual studies, the comprehensive analysis of key genes and molecular regulatory network in anthracyclines-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) is lacking but urgently needed.\nThe present study integrating several transcription profiling datasets aimed to identify key genes associated with AIC by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed analysis (DEA) and also constructed miRNA-transcription factor-gene regulatory network. A total of three transcription profiling datasets involving 47 samples comprising 41 rat heart tissues and 6 human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSCMs) samples were enrolled.\nThe WGCNA and DEA with E-MTAB-1168 identified 14 common genes affected by doxorubicin administrated by 4\u00a0weeks or 6\u00a0weeks. Functional and signal enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in the regulation of heart contraction, muscle contraction, heart process, and oxytocin signaling pathway.

{"title": "Incidence of carditis and predictors of pacemaker implantation in patients hospitalized with Lyme disease.", "abstract": "Lyme carditis, defined as direct infection of cardiac tissue by Borrelia bacteria, affects up to 10% of patients with Lyme disease. The most frequently reported clinical manifestation of Lyme carditis is cardiac conduction system disease. The goal of this study was to identify the incidence and predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation in patients hospitalized with Lyme disease.\nA retrospective cohort analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient sample was performed to identify patients hospitalized with Lyme disease in the US between 2003 and 2014. Patients with Lyme carditis were defined as those hospitalized with Lyme disease who also had cardiac conduction disease, acute myocarditis, or acute pericarditis. Patients who already had pacemaker implants at the time of hospitalization (N = 310) were excluded from the Lyme carditis subgroup. The primary study outcome was permanent pacemaker implantation. Secondary outcomes included temporary cardiac pacing, permanent pacemaker implant, and in-hospital mortality.\nOf the 96,140 patients hospitalized with Lyme disease during the study period, 10,465 (11%) presented with Lyme carditis. Cardiac conduction system disease was present in 9,729 (93%) of patients with Lyme carditis. Permanent pacemaker implantation was performed in 1,033 patients (1% of all Lyme hospitalizations and 11% of patients with Lyme carditis-associated conduction system disease).

{"title": "Toward cardiac tissue characterization using machine learning and light-scattering spectroscopy.", "abstract": "The non-destructive characterization of cardiac tissue composition provides essential information for both planning and evaluating the effectiveness of surgical interventions such as ablative procedures. Although several methods of tissue characterization, such as optical coherence tomography and fiber-optic confocal microscopy, show promise, many barriers exist that reduce effectiveness or prevent adoption, such as time delays in analysis, prohibitive costs, and limited scope of application. Developing a rapid, low-cost non-destructive means of characterizing cardiac tissue could improve planning, implementation, and evaluation of cardiac surgical procedures.\nTo determine whether a new light-scattering spectroscopy (LSS) system that analyzes spectra via neural networks is capable of predicting the nuclear densities (NDs) of ventricular tissues.\nWe developed an LSS system with a fiber-optics probe and applied it for measurements on cardiac tissues from an ovine model. We quantified the ND in the cardiac tissues using fluorescent labeling, confocal microscopy, and image processing. Spectra acquired from the same cardiac tissues were analyzed with spectral clustering and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to assess the feasibility of characterizing the ND of tissue via LSS.\nSpectral clustering revealed distinct groups of spectra correlated to ranges of ND. CNNs classified three groups of spectra with low, medium, or high ND with an accuracy of 95.00\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u200911.77\u2009\u2009%\u2009\u2009 (mean and standard deviation). Our analyses revealed the sensitivity of the classification accuracy to wavelength range and subsampling of spectra.\nLSS and machine learning are capable of assessing ND in cardiac tissues. We suggest that the approach is useful for the diagnosis of cardiac diseases associated with changes of ND, such as hypertrophy and fibrosis.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "date": "2021-11-04", "authors": ["Nathan JKnighton", "Brian KCottle", "SarthakTiwari", "AbhijitMondal", "Aditya KKaza", "Frank BSachse", "Robert WHitchcock"], "doi": "10.1117/1.JBO.26.11.116001\n10.1161/01.RES.0000130529.18016.35\n10.1088/2516-1091/ab8af8\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.117.006881\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.112.000121\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2014.08.001\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2018.04.025\n10.3904/kjim.2012.27.1.1\n10.1093/ejcts/ezaa040\n10.1053/j.semtcvs.2019.02.006\n10.1117/12.763660\n10.21037/qims.2019.05.09\n10.1038/nmeth.1483\n10.1053/gast.2001.24842\n10.1038/nm1101-1245\n10.1038/s41551-017-0040\n10.1038/s41598-019-38482-1\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.117.005614\n10.3390/data2010008\n10.1007/978-3-030-21949-9_19\n10.3390/s21186033\n10.1117/1.JMI.5.4.046003\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy404\n10.1002/nbm.3576\n10.1017/S2040174417000381\n10.1007/s10439-015-1465-6\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.7717/peerj.453\n10.1007/s11222-007-9033-z\n10.1113/JP275654\n10.1117/1.JBO.22.7.076009\n10.1364/AO.38.006628\n10.1364/OE.5.000302\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2468589\n10.1152/ajpheart.1985.248.6.H876\n10.4065/mcp.2011.0296\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.07.023\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.03.010\n10.1016/S1010-7940(05)80012-0"}

{"title": "Amniotic stromal stem cell-loaded hydrogel repairs cardiac tissue in infarcted rat hearts via paracrine mediators.", "abstract": "The use of stem cells to repair the heart after a myocardial infarction (MI) remains promising, yet clinical trials over the past 20\u00a0years suggest that cells fail to integrate into the native tissue, resulting in limited improvements in cardiac function. Here, we demonstrate the cardioprotective potential of a composite inserting human amniotic stromal mesenchymal stem cells (ASMCs) in a chitosan and hyaluronic acid (C/HA) based hydrogel in a rat MI model. Mechanical characterization of the C/HA platform indicated a swift elastic conversion at 40\u00b0C and a rapid sol-gel transition time at 37\u00b0C. Cell viability assay presented active and proliferating AMSCs in the C/HA. The ASMCs\u00a0+\u00a0C/HA injected composite significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and neovessel formation. The encapsulated AMSCs were abundantly detected in the infarcted myocardium 6\u00a0weeks post-administration and co-expressed cardiac proteins and notably proliferative markers. Proteomic profiling revealed that extracellular vesicles released from hypoxia preconditioned ASMCs contained proteins involved in cytoprotection, angiogenesis, cardiac differentiation and non-canonical Wnt-signaling. Independent activation of non-canonical Wnt-signaling pathways in ASMCs induced cardiogenesis. Despite a low injected cellular density at baseline, the encapsulated AMSCs were abundantly retained and increased cardiac function. Furthermore, the C/HA hydrogel provided an active milieu for the AMSCs to proliferate, co-express cardiac proteins, and induce new vessel formation. Hence, this novel composite of AMSCs\u00a0+\u00a0C/HA scaffold is a conceivable candidate that could restore cardiac function and reduce remodeling.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2021-11-03", "authors": ["KashifKhan", "GeorgesMakhoul", "BinYu", "GhulamJalani", "IdaDerish", "Alissa KRutman", "MartaCerruti", "AdelSchwertani", "RenzoCecere"], "doi": "10.1002/term.3262"}
{"title": "Assessment of myocardial viscoelasticity with Brillouin spectroscopy in myocardial infarction and aortic stenosis models.", "abstract": "Heart diseases are associated with changes in the biomechanical properties of the myocardial wall. However, there is no modality available to assess myocardial stiffness directly. Brillouin microspectroscopy (mBS) is a consolidated mechanical characterization technique, applied to the study of the viscoelastic and elastic behavior of biological samples and may be a valuable tool for assessing the viscoelastic properties of the cardiac tissue. In this work, viscosity and elasticity were assessed using mBS in heart samples obtained from healthy and unhealthy mice (n\u2009=\u20096 per group). Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) was performed to evaluate heart deformation. We found that mBS was able to detect changes in stiffness in the ventricles in healthy myocardium. The right ventricle showed reduced stiffness, in agreement with its increased compliance. mBS measurements correlated strongly with STE data, highlighting the association between displacement and stiffness in myocardial regions. This correlation was lost in pathological conditions studied. The scar region in the infarcted heart presented changes in\u00a0stiffness when\u00a0compared to the rest of the heart, and the hypertrophied left ventricle showed increased stiffness following aortic stenosis, compared to the right ventricle. We demonstrate that\u00a0mBS can be applied to determine myocardial stiffness, that measurements correlate with functional parameters and that they change with disease.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-11-03", "authors": ["Mar\u00edaVillalba-Orero", "Rafael JJim\u00e9nez-Riob\u00f3o", "NuriaGont\u00e1n", "DanielSanderson", "MarinaL\u00f3pez-Ola\u00f1eta", "PabloGarc\u00eda-Pav\u00eda", "ManuelDesco", "EnriqueLara-Pezzi", "Maria VictoriaG\u00f3mez-Gaviro"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-00661-4\n10.1093/cvr/cvx090"}

{"title": "Late Cardiac Pathology in Severe Covid-19. A Postmortem Series of 30 Patients.", "abstract": "The role of SARS-CoV-2 as a direct cause in the cardiac lesions in patients with severe COVID-19 remains to be established. Our objective is to report the pathological findings in cardiac samples of 30 patients who died after a prolonged hospital stay due to Sars-Cov-2 infection. We performed macroscopic, histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the hearts of 30 patients; and detected Sars-Cov-2 RNA by RT-PCR in the cardiac tissue samples. The median age of our cohort was 69.5 years and 76.6% were male. The median time between symptoms onset and death was 36.5 days. The main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (13 patients, 43.3%), dyslipidemia (11 patients, 36.7%), cardiovascular conditions (8 patients, 26.7%), and obesity (8 patients, 26.7%). Cardiovascular conditions included ischemic cardiopathy in 4 patients (13.3%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2 patients (6.7%) and valve replacement and chronic heart failure in one patient each (3.3%). At autopsy, the most frequent histopathological findings were coronary artery atherosclerosis (8 patients, 26.7%), left ventricular hypertrophy (4 patients, 13.3%), chronic epicardial inflammation (3 patients, 10%) and adipose metaplasia (2 patients, 6.7%). Two patients showed focal myocarditis, one due to invasive aspergillosis. One additional patient showed senile amyloidosis. Sars-Cov-2 RNA was detected in the heart of only one out of 30 patients, who had the shortest disease evolution of the series (9 days).

The present study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect of Huoxue Qianyang Qutan recipe (HQQR) on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from the cardiac tissue of neonatal rats, followed by flow cytometry detection to confirm the proportion of primary cardiomyocytes. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and immunofluorescence detection were performed to examine the effect of Ang II and HQQR on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a series of metabolic indicators were quantified to investigate the effect of HQQR on Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Mitochondrial electron transport chain complex activity and related coding gene expression were determined to explore the effect of HQQR on mitochondrial function. HQQR significantly inhibited Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and restored Ang II-induced ROS accumulation, metabolic indicators, and membrane potential levels. HQQR also regulated the mitochondrial function related to the sirtuin 1 pathway in Ang II-induced cardiomyocytes by increasing the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex and affecting the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial electron transport chain complex subunits. HQQR could alleviate Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by modulating oxidative stress, accumulating ROS and increasing mitochondrial electron transport chain activity.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2021-11-02", "authors": ["MingtaiGui", "LeiYao", "BoLu", "JingWang", "XunjieZhou", "JianhuaLi", "ZhenhuaDong", "DeyuFu"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2021.10881\n10.2174/0929867324666170428103206\n10.1111/jpi.12579\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.06.001\n10.1038/nrm1983\n10.1038/s41569-018-0007-y\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06689\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw138\n10.3892/mmr.2015.3841\n10.1161/RES.0000000000000104\n10.1038/s12276-019-0355-7\n10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113155\n10.3892/mmr.2018.9448\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.04.041\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.041\n10.7150/ijbs.7.383\n10.1016/j.phymed.2012.10.012\n10.3892/etm.2020.8746\n10.1042/BSR20192909\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109518\n10.1161/JAHA.119.015640\n10.3791/50154\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2019.01.010\n10.1038/srep42965\n10.1152/ajpheart.00731.2018\n10.21037/atm.2018.04.14\n10.1155/2021/5545261\n10.1007/s13105-017-0576-y\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.09.024\n10.2174/1573403X14666180111145207\n10.3390/ijms20092164\n10.1007/s10741-017-9634-3\n10.1002/jcp.26390\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.04.018\n10.12659/MSM.911714"}
{"title": "Efficient Ventricular Parameter Estimation Using AI-Surrogate Models.", "abstract": "The onset and progression of pathological heart conditions, such as cardiomyopathy or heart failure, affect its mechanical behaviour due to the remodelling of the myocardial tissues to preserve its functional response. Identification of the constitutive properties of heart tissues could provide useful biomarkers to diagnose and assess the progression of disease. We have previously demonstrated the utility of efficient AI-surrogate models to simulate passive cardiac mechanics. Here, we propose the use of this surrogate model for the identification of myocardial mechanical properties and intra-ventricular pressure by solving an inverse problem with two novel AI-based approaches. Our analysis concluded that: (i) both approaches were robust toward Gaussian noise when the ventricle data for multiple loading conditions were combined; and (ii) estimates of one and two parameters could be obtained in less than 9 and 18 s, respectively. The proposed technique yields a viable option for the translation of cardiac mechanics simulations and biophysical parameter identification methods into the clinic to improve the diagnosis and treatment of heart pathologies.

{"title": "Chronic Benzene Exposure Aggravates Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Benzene is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant abundant in household products, petrochemicals, and cigarette smoke. Benzene is a well-known carcinogen in humans and experimental animals; however, little is known about the cardiovascular toxicity of benzene. Recent population-based studies indicate that benzene exposure is associated with an increased risk for heart failure. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether benzene exposure is sufficient to induce and/or exacerbate heart failure. We examined the effects of benzene (50\u2009ppm, 6\u2009h/day, 5\u2009days/week, and 6\u2009weeks) or high-efficiency particulate absorbing-filtered air exposure on transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced pressure overload in male C57BL/6J mice. Our data show that benzene exposure had no effect on cardiac function in the Sham group; however, it significantly compromised cardiac function as depicted by a significant decrease in fractional shortening and ejection fraction, as compared with TAC/Air-exposed mice. RNA-seq analysis of the cardiac tissue from the TAC/benzene-exposed mice showed a significant increase in several genes associated with adhesion molecules, cell-cell adhesion, inflammation, and stress response. In particular, neutrophils were implicated in our unbiased analyses. Indeed, immunofluorescence studies showed that TAC/benzene exposure promotes infiltration of CD11b+/S100A8+/myeloperoxidase+-positive neutrophils in the hearts by 3-fold. In vitro, the benzene metabolites, hydroquinone, and catechol, induced the expression of P-selectin in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells by 5-fold and increased the adhesion of neutrophils to these endothelial cells by 1.5- to 2.0-fold. Benzene metabolite-induced adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelial cells was attenuated by anti-P-selectin antibody. Together, these data suggest that benzene exacerbates heart failure by promoting endothelial activation and neutrophil recruitment.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2021-11-01", "authors": ["Igor NZelko", "SujithDassanayaka", "Marina VMalovichko", "Caitlin MHoward", "Lauren FGarrett", "ShizukaUchida", "Kenneth RBrittian", "Daniel JConklin", "Steven PJones", "SanjaySrivastava"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfab125"}

Although the treatment of these disorders is mainly focused on resolving their mental component, one cannot neglect the need for the treatment of accompanying somatic symptoms. Melissa officinalis L. (lemon balm), in various formulations, has been extensively used as an ethnomedicinal remedy for the treatment of different psyche-related symptoms, and its use is considered relatively safe.\nIn the present study, the activity of M. officinalis (MO) essential oil was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo models mimicking or involving anxiety-related somatic symptoms.\nTo address the effect of MO essential oil on the gastrointestinal and heart-related symptoms accompanying anxiety disorders, in vitro models were utilized that follow the function of the isolated mouse ileum and atria tissues, respectively, after exposure to MO essential oil. Effects of MO essential oil on BALB/c mice motor activity was estimated using the open field, rota-rod, and horizontal wire tests. Additionally, the essential oil was assayed for its potential in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity.\nThe performance of mice treated with 25\u00a0mg/kg of the oil showed a statistically significant decrease in the motor impairment arising from acute anxiety (open field test), while there was a prolonged latency and a reduction of the frequency of falling from a rotating rod and/or a horizontal wire (signs of muscle weakness/spasms). Concentrations of the essential oil higher than 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL were found to inhibit both spontaneous and induced ileum contractions. Moreover, the essential oil and citronellal were found to decrease isolated mouse atria contraction frequency, as well as contraction force. However, the oil was found to be a very weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.\nThe modulation of anxiety-related symptoms by the oil was found not to be mediated through the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase, nonetheless, the mechanistic studies involving the ileum and cardiac tissues, revealed that the activity of MO and citronellal might be related to the modification of either voltage-gated Ca", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2021-11-01", "authors": ["Nikola MStojanovi\u0107", "Marko ZMladenovi\u0107", "AleksandraMaslovari\u0107", "Nenad IStojiljkovi\u0107", "Pavle JRandjelovi\u0107", "Niko SRadulovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2021.114788"}
{"title": "Unravelling Atrioventricular Block Risk in Inflammatory Diseases: Systemic Inflammation Acutely Delays Atrioventricular Conduction via a Cytokine-Mediated Inhibition of Connexin43 Expression.", "abstract": "Background Recent data suggest that systemic inflammation can negatively affect atrioventricular conduction, regardless of acute cardiac injury. Indeed, gap-junctions containing connexin43 coupling cardiomyocytes and inflammation-related cells (macrophages) are increasingly recognized as important factors regulating the conduction in the atrioventricular node. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute impact of systemic inflammatory activation on atrioventricular conduction, and elucidate underlying mechanisms. Methods and Results We analyzed: (1) the PR-interval in patients with inflammatory diseases of different origins during active phase and recovery, and its association with inflammatory markers; (2) the existing correlation between connexin43 expression in the cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and the changes occurring in patients with inflammatory diseases over time; (3) the acute effects of interleukin(IL)-6 on atrioventricular conduction in an in vivo animal model, and on connexin43 expression in vitro. In patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels, atrioventricular conduction indices are increased, but promptly normalized in association with inflammatory markers reduction, particularly IL-6. In these subjects, connexin43 expression in PBMC, which is correlative of that measured in the cardiac tissue, inversely associated with IL-6 changes. Moreover, direct IL-6 administration increased atrioventricular conduction indices in vivo in a guinea pig model, and IL-6 incubation in both cardiomyocytes and macrophages in culture, significantly reduced connexin43 proteins expression. Conclusions The data evidence that systemic inflammation can acutely worsen atrioventricular conduction, and that IL-6-induced down-regulation of cardiac connexin43 is a mechanistic pathway putatively involved in the process.

{"title": "Distributed synthesis of sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins in cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "It is widely assumed that synthesis of membrane proteins, particularly in the heart, follows the classical secretory pathway with mRNA translation occurring in perinuclear regions followed by protein trafficking to sites of deployment. However, this view is based on studies conducted in less-specialized cells, and has not been experimentally addressed in cardiac myocytes. Therefore, we undertook direct experimental investigation of protein synthesis in cardiac tissue and isolated myocytes using single-molecule visualization techniques and a novel proximity-ligated in situ hybridization approach for visualizing ribosome-associated mRNA molecules for a specific protein species, indicative of translation sites. We identify here, for the first time, that the molecular machinery for membrane protein synthesis occurs throughout the cardiac myocyte, and enables distributed synthesis of membrane proteins within sub-cellular niches where the synthesized protein functions using local mRNA pools trafficked, in part, by microtubules. We also observed cell-wide distribution of membrane protein mRNA in myocardial tissue from both non-failing and hypertrophied (failing) human hearts, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved distributed mechanism from mouse to human.

{"title": "Loss of Function in Dopamine D3 Receptor Attenuates Left Ventricular Cardiac Fibroblast Migration and Proliferation ", "abstract": "Evidence suggests the existence of an intracardiac dopaminergic system that plays a pivotal role in regulating cardiac function and fibrosis through G-protein coupled receptors, particularly mediated by dopamine receptor 3 (D3R). However, the expression of dopamine receptors in cardiac tissue and their role in cardiac fibroblast function is unclear. In this brief report, first we determined expression of D1R and D3R both in left ventricle (LV) tissue and fibroblasts. Then, we explored the role of D3R in the proliferation and migration of fibroblast cell cultures using both genetic and pharmaceutical approaches; specifically, we compared cardiac fibroblasts isolated from LV of wild type (WT) and D3R knockout (D3KO) mice in response to D3R-specific pharmacological agents. Finally, we determined if loss of D3R function could significantly alter LV fibroblast expression of collagen types I (Col1a1) and III (Col3a1). Cardiac fibroblast proliferation was attenuated in D3KO cells, mimicking the behavior of WT cardiac fibroblasts treated with D3R antagonist. In response to scratch injury, WT cardiac fibroblasts treated with the D3R agonist, pramipexole, displayed enhanced migration compared to control WT and D3KO cells.

Among the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 is myocardial injury, which is associated with a high risk of mortality. Myocardial injury, caused directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be triggered by inflammatory processes that lead to damage to the heart tissue. Since one of the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 is the \"cytokine storm\", strategies to control inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been considered. Cannabinoids are known to have anti-inflammatory properties by negatively modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Herein, we investigated the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. WIN did not modify angiotensin-converting enzyme II protein levels, nor reduced viral infection and replication in hiPSC-CMs. On the other hand, WIN reduced the levels of interleukins six, eight, 18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) released by infected cells, and attenuated cytotoxic damage measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

Many biomarkers already exist in the rapidly developing biomarker research field that aim to improve patients' care. Limited work, however, has been performed on rare diseases, including DM1. We have previously shown that specific microRNAs (miRNAs) can be used as potential biomarkers for DM1 progression. In this report, we aimed to identify novel serum-based biomarkers for DM1 through high-throughput next-generation sequencing. A number of miRNAs were identified that are able to distinguish DM1 patients from healthy individuals. Two miRNAs were selected, and their association with the disease was validated in a larger panel of patients. Further investigation of miR-223-3p, miR-24-3p, and the four previously identified miRNAs, miR-1-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-133b-3p, and miR-206-3p, showed elevated levels in a DM1 mouse model for all six miRNAs circulating in the serum compared to healthy controls. Importantly, the levels of miR-223-3p, but not the other five miRNAs, were found to be significantly downregulated in five skeletal muscles and heart tissues of DM1 mice compared to controls.

Several SOX proteins (SOX4, 11, and 9) are required for normal heart morphogenesis. SOX9 was shown to contribute to cardiac fibrosis. However, differential expression of other SOXs and their roles in the failing human myocardium have not been explored. Here, we used the whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), gene co-expression, and meta-analysis to examine whether any SOX factors might play a role in the failing human myocardium. RNA-seq analysis was performed for cardiac tissue samples from heart failure (HF) patients due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and healthy donors (NF). The RNA levels of 20 SOX genes from RNA-seq data were extracted and compared to the 3 groups. Four SOX genes whose RNA levels were significantly upregulated in DCM or HCM compared to NF. However, only SOX4 and SOX8 proteins were markedly increased in the HF groups. A moderate to strong correlation was observed between the RNA level of SOX4/8 and fibrotic genes among each individual. Gene co-expression network analysis identified genes associated and respond similarly to perturbations with SOX4 in cardiac tissues. Using a meta-analysis combining epigenetics and genome-wide association data, we reported several genomic variants associated with HF phenotype linked to SOX4 or SOX8. In summary, our results implicate that SOX4 and SOX8 have a role in cardiomyopathy, leading to HF in humans.

This study aimed to investigate whether myocardial cellular stress and apoptotic response changes due to different cardioplegia (CP) solutions during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in infants and to determine their influence on surgical/clinical outcomes. Therefore, twenty-seven infants for surgical closure of ventricular septal defect were randomly assigned to a CP solution: normothermic blood (BCP), delNido (dNCP), and Custodiol (CCP). Hsp levels and apoptosis were determined by immunoblotting in cardiac tissue from the right atrium before and after CP, and their correlations with cardiac parameters were evaluated. No significant change was observed in Hsp27 levels. Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 levels decreased significantly in the BCP-group but increased markedly in the CCP-group. Decreased Hsp60 and increased Hsp70 expression were detected in dNCP-group. Importantly, apoptosis was not observed in dNCP- and CCP-groups, whereas marked increases in cleaved caspase-3 and -8 were determined after BCP. Serum cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I), myocardial injury marker, was markedly lower in the BCP- and dNCP-groups than CCP. Additionally, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 levels were positively correlated with aortic cross-clamp time, total perfusion time, and cTn-I release. Our findings show that dNCP provides the most effective myocardial preservation in pediatric open-heart surgery and indicate that an increase in Hsp70 expression may be associated with a cardioprotective effect, while an increase in Hsp60 and Hsp90 levels may be an indicator of myocardial damage during CPB.", "journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "date": "2021-10-26", "authors": ["EylemYayla-Tun\u00e7er", "Asl\u0131han\u015eengelen", "Berra Z\u00fcmr\u00fctTan-Recep", "\u00d6mer Faruk\u015eavluk", "Abdullah ArifYilmaz", "HakanCeyran", "Evren\u00d6nay-U\u00e7ar"], "doi": "10.1007/s00246-021-02759-y\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.05.052\n10.1177/0267659118794343\n10.21470/1678-9741-2017-0169\n10.1016/s1010-7940(02)00327-5\n10.1016/S0967-2109(03)00078-4\n10.1016/s1043-6618(03)00193-2\n10.1515/CCLM.2007.030\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.01.047\n10.1177/147323001103900217\n10.1152/ajpheart.00272.2010\n10.1007/s12192-012-0379-6\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00324\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.942250\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.09.001\n10.1089/hum.2011.009\n10.1161/01.cir.0000032880.55215.92\n10.1210/en.2006-1581\n10.1155/2020/3908641\n10.1007/s12192-019-01004-z\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0857\n10.1152/ajpheart.00660.2001\n10.1093/cvr/cvn091\n10.1111/j.1365-2613.2006.00484.x\n10.1248/bpb.30.105\n10.1379/csc-272.1\n10.1136/hrt.2003.028092:299-304\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067964\n10.1007/s12192-012-0399-2\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173987\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2003.11.028\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.000828\n10.1007/s00246-017-1732-4\n10.1016/j.cll.2013.11.001"}
{"title": "Integrating analysis of circular RNA and mRNA expression profiles in doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity mice.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity impedes its clinical application, but the mechanisms have not been thoroughly elucidated. Based on circRNA and mRNA expression profiles, we illustrated RNA expression signature changes during DOX-induced cardiotoxicity; mechanism exploration and biomarkers screening were also conducted. Twelve mice were randomly divided into two groups, induction group was treated with doxorubicin, and the control group was given an equal quantity of saline. After the confirmation of myocardial injury in induction group, the heart tissues from both groups were isolated for RNA high-throughput sequencing. The expression profiles were compared between the two groups; a total of 295 mRNAs and 11 circRNAs were shown as biased expression in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity mouse hearts. The dysregulation of three circRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR: mmu_circ_0015773, mmu_circ_0002106, and mmu_circ_001606. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of the differentially expressed RNAs were performed; the results implied that DOX might cause cardiotoxicity by interfering hemoglobin-based oxygen delivery and DNA-associated signal pathways. We integrated the differential expressed mRNA and validated circRNAs by constructing a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, which indicated that the alteration of the three circRNAs could activate apoptosis process of myocardial cells. This study provided novel insight into the mechanisms of DOX induced cardiotoxicity, and potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets were also proposed.", "journal": "Journal of applied toxicology : JAT", "date": "2021-10-26", "authors": ["XiaoqingXing", "ZhenzhenTan", "XuranZhi", "HemingSun", "JingYang", "LongfeiLi", "YiLiu", "LeiWang", "ZhanjunDong", "HuicaiGuo"], "doi": "10.1002/jat.4257"}
{"title": "Reawakening the Intrinsic Cardiac Regenerative Potential: Molecular Strategies to Boost Dedifferentiation and Proliferation of Endogenous Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Despite considerable efforts carried out to develop stem/progenitor cell-based technologies aiming at replacing and restoring the cardiac tissue following severe damages, thus far no strategies based on adult stem cell transplantation have been demonstrated to efficiently generate new cardiac muscle cells. Intriguingly, dedifferentiation, and proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes and not stem cell differentiation represent the preponderant cellular mechanism by which lower vertebrates spontaneously regenerate the injured heart. Mammals can also regenerate their heart up to the early neonatal period, even in this case by activating the proliferation of endogenous cardiomyocytes. However, the mammalian cardiac regenerative potential is dramatically reduced soon after birth, when most cardiomyocytes exit from the cell cycle, undergo further maturation, and continue to grow in size. Although a slow rate of cardiomyocyte turnover has also been documented in adult mammals, both in mice and humans, this is not enough to sustain a robust regenerative process. Nevertheless, these remarkable findings opened the door to a branch of novel regenerative approaches aiming at reactivating the endogenous cardiac regenerative potential by triggering a partial dedifferentiation process and cell cycle re-entry in endogenous cardiomyocytes. Several adaptations from intrauterine to extrauterine life starting at birth and continuing in the immediate neonatal period concur to the loss of the mammalian cardiac regenerative ability. A wide range of systemic and microenvironmental factors or cell-intrinsic molecular players proved to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation and their manipulation has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to boost cardiac function after injuries. We here review the scientific knowledge gained thus far in this novel and flourishing field of research, elucidating the key biological and molecular mechanisms whose modulation may represent a viable approach for regenerating the human damaged myocardium.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2021-10-26", "authors": ["ChiaraBongiovanni", "FrancescaSacchi", "SilviaDa Pra",

{"title": "Folic Acid Alleviates High Glucose and Fat-Induced Pyroptosis via Inhibition of the Hippo Signal Pathway on H9C2 Cells.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of death in diabetic patients. Folic acid has a protective effect on diabetes-induced cardiomyocyte damage. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of folic acid on cardiomyocytes cultured under high glucose and fat (HGF) conditions and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the potential drugs through the Drug-Gene Interaction database. H9C2 cardiomyocytes were cultured with 30\u00a0mM glucose and 500\u00a0nM palmitic acid in the presence or absence of folic acid or YAP1 inhibitor (verteporfin) or YAP1 siRNA. The cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured using specific assay kits. Pyroptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. The NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 mRNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR and that the proteins expression of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1 (p10), caspase-1, YAP1, p-YAP1, LATS1 and P-LATS1 were detected by Western blotting. C57BL/6 mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneally to establish a T2DM model, folic acid or PBS treatment for 8\u00a0weeks by oral gavage, blood glucose and body weight were measured every 4\u00a0weeks, mouse heart tissue was used to detect pyroptosis and hippo signaling pathway related protein expression. We identified 427 differentially expressed genes in the cardiac tissues of high fat diet + streptozotocin mice, among the 30 most significantly DEGs, folic acid was predicted to be the most likely therapeutic drug.

{"title": "A framework for developing sex-specific engineered heart models.", "abstract": "The convergence of tissue engineering and patient-specific stem cell biology has enabled the engineering of in vitro tissue models that allow the study of patient-tailored treatment modalities. However, sex-related disparities in health and disease, from systemic hormonal influences to cellular-level differences, are often overlooked in stem cell biology, tissue engineering and preclinical screening. The cardiovascular system, in particular, shows considerable sex-related differences, which need to be considered in cardiac tissue engineering. In this Review, we analyse sex-related properties of the heart muscle in the context of health and disease, and discuss a framework for including sex-based differences in human cardiac tissue engineering. We highlight how sex-based features can be implemented at the cellular and tissue levels, and how sex-specific cardiac models could advance the study of cardiovascular diseases. Finally, we define design criteria for sex-specific cardiac tissue engineering and provide an outlook to future research possibilities beyond the cardiovascular system.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

{"title": "Hydrogen sulfide plays a potential alternative for the treatment of metabolic disorders of diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a cardiovascular complication that tends to occur in patients with diabetes, obesity, or insulin resistance, with a higher late mortality rate. Sustained hyperglycemia, increased free fatty acids, or insulin resistance induces metabolic disorders in cardiac tissues and cells, leading to myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic and/or systolic dysfunction, and finally develop into congestive heart failure.

{"title": "A Human 3D Cardiomyocyte Risk Model to Study the Cardiotoxic Influence of X-rays and Other Noxae in Adults.", "abstract": "The heart tissue is a potential target of various noxae contributing to the onset of cardiovascular diseases. However, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Human stem cell-derived models are promising, but a major concern is cell immaturity when estimating risks for adults. In this study, 3D aggregates of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were cultivated for 300 days and characterized regarding degree of maturity, structure, and cell composition. Furthermore, effects of ionizing radiation (X-rays, 0.1-2 Gy) on matured aggregates were investigated, representing one of the noxae that are challenging to assess. Video-based functional analyses were correlated to changes in the proteome after irradiation. Cardiomyocytes reached maximum maturity after 100 days in cultivation, judged by \u03b1-actinin lengths, and displayed typical multinucleation and branching. At this time, aggregates contained all major cardiac cell types, proven by the patch-clamp technique. Matured and X-ray-irradiated aggregates revealed a subtle increase in beat rates and a more arrhythmic sequence of cellular depolarisation and repolarisation compared to non-irradiated sham controls. The proteome analysis provides first insights into signaling mechanisms contributing to cardiotoxicity.

Pharmacological interventions have not been at the forefront in ameliorating MI-related morbidity and mortality. Stem cell-based tissue engineering approaches have been extensively explored for their regenerative potential in the infarcted myocardium. Recent studies on microfluidic devices employing stem cells under laboratory set-up have revealed meticulous events pertaining to the pathophysiology of MI occurring at the infarcted site. This discovery also underpins the appropriate conditions in the niche for differentiating stem cells into mature cardiomyocyte-like cells and leads to engineering of the scaffold via mimicking of native cardiac physiological conditions. However, the mode of stem cell-loaded engineered scaffolds delivered to the site of infarction is still a challenging mission, and yet to be translated to the clinical setting.

Thus, this study tested whether obesogenic and ketogenic diets distinctly affect SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in rat pulmonary and cardiac tissues.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either standard chow (SC), a high-fat sucrose-enriched diet (HFS), or a ketogenic diet (KD) for 16 weeks. Afterwards, levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), RAS components, and inflammatory genes were measured in the lungs and hearts of these animals.\nIn the lungs, HFS elevated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels relative to SC diet, whereas the KD lowered the levels of these proteins and the gene expressions of toll-like receptor 4 and interleukin-6 receptor relative to HFS. The diets did not alter ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the heart, although ACE2 was more abundant in heart than lung tissues.\nDiet-induced obesity increased the levels of viral entry proteins in the lungs, providing a mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 infectivity can be enhanced in obese individuals. Conversely, by maintaining low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and by exerting an anti-inflammatory effect, the KD can potentially attenuate the severity of infection and migration of SARS-CoV-2 to other ACE2-expressing tissues.", "journal": "Nutrients", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["DanielDa Eira", "ShaileeJani", "Rolando BCeddia"], "doi": "10.3390/nu13103357\n10.3390/ijms20092358\n10.23736/S2724-6507.20.03402-1\n10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154262\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.066\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052\n10.1007/s11481-020-09944-5\n10.2337/db20-0765\n10.1111/obr.13077\n10.1111/jvim.15454\n10.1016/j.mce.2012.06.021\n10.1007/s11906-008-0036-8\n10.1155/2019/8681959\n10.1371/journal.pone.0126364\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.07.005\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.2337/db20-0669\n10.1016/j.jhep.2020.09.027\n10.3390/nu12092748\n10.1111/obr.13024\n10.1073/pnas.1922344117\n10.1038/s41422-021-00495-9\n10.1007/s11745-007-3132-7\n10.3390/antiox7050063\n10.1371/journal.pone.0078765\n10.1038/nm.3804\n10.7759/cureus.9639"}

Considering that MM is an elderly disease and that age is an independent risk factor for cardiotoxicity, herein, we sought to validate carfilzomib's cardiotoxicity in an in vivo model of aging.\nAged mice underwent the translational two- and four-dose protocols without and with metformin. Mice underwent echocardiography and were subsequently sacrificed for molecular analyses in the blood and cardiac tissue.\nCarfilzomib decreased proteasomal activity both in PBMCs and myocardium in both protocols. Carfilzomib induced mild cardiotoxicity after two doses and more pronounced cardiomyopathy in the four-dose protocol, while metformin maintained cardiac function. Carfilzomib led to an increased Bip expression and decreased AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation, while metformin coadministration partially decreased Bip expression and induced AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation, leading to enhanced myocardial LC3B-dependent autophagy.\nCarfilzomib induced cardiotoxicity in aged mice, an effect significantly reversed by metformin. The latter possesses translational importance as it further supports the clinical use of metformin as a potent prophylactic therapy.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["PanagiotisEfentakis", "GaryfaliaPsarakou", "AimiliaVarela", "Eleni DimitraPapanagnou", "MichailChatzistefanou", "Panagiota-EfstathiaNikolaou", "Costantinos HDavos", "MariaGavriatopoulou", "Ioannis PTrougakos", "Meletios AthanasiosDimopoulos", "IoannaAndreadou", "EvangelosTerpos"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms222010956\n10.1016/j.clml.2019.04.018\n10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30578-8\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30734-0\n10.1080/14656566.2017.1404575\n10.1111/joim.12882\n10.1182/blood-2018-06-858415\n10.1007/s00125-017-4342-z\n10.3324/haematol.2014.110296\n10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00532.x\n10.1080/10428194.2017.1365859\n10.1373/clinchem.2018.288332\n10.1152/ajpheart.00734.2017\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.06.053\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.101875\n10.1016/j.jgo.2017.04.001\n10.1161/01.RES.68.6.1560\n10.1038/ncomms6659\n10.1155/2019/2675972\n10.2174/138161211798764898\n10.1038/s41408-020-0273-x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.10.017\n10.2174/1568026619666190521093049\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01744\n10.1038/cdd.2008.81\n10.3390/ijms21155185\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.222919\n10.1111/bph.12124\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1091141\n10.1093/cvr/cvz163\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-915\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.152959\n10.1093/eurjhf/hft034\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.2010.05470.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300536\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.309633\n10.3390/ijms21144987\n10.1038/nrm.2017.95\n10.1038/emm.2016.16\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1100356\n10.1111/acel.12446\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173059\n10.3390/ijms17010122\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.034\n10.1038/s41408-020-00381-4\n10.1111/cas.13166\n10.1182/blood-2014-03-563759\n10.1002/9780470942390.mo140195\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00872.x\n10.1016/j.joca.2012.02.010\n10.1089/ars.2019.7923"}

However, the composition and role of unknown polymorphic composites in heart failure (HF) progression remain unclear. Here, we aimed to explore composite deposition during endocardium damage and HF progression. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two HF groups-angiotensin II-induced HF and left anterior descending artery ligation-induced HF. Heart tissues from patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery (non-HF) and those with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) were collected. EE damage, polymorphic unknown composite accumulation, and elements in deposits were examined. HF progression reduced the expression of CD31 in the endocardium, impaired endocardial integrity, and exposed the myofibrils and mitochondria. The damaged endocardial surface showed the accumulation of unknown polymorphic composites. In the animal HF model, especially HF caused by myocardial infarction, the weight and atomic percentages of O, Na, and N in the deposited composites were significantly higher than those of the other groups. The deposited composites in the human HF heart section (DCM) had a significantly higher percentage of Na and S than the other groups, whereas the percentage of C and Na in the DCM and ICM groups was significantly higher than those of the control group.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of VAD on miRNA expression profile in cardiac tissue obtained from HF children, to determine the putative miRNA targets by an in-silico analysis as well as to verify the changes of predicated miRNA target in the same cardiac samples. The regulatory role of selected miRNAs on predicted targets was evaluated by a dedicated in vitro study. miRNA profile was determined in cardiac samples obtained from 13 HF children [median: 29 months; 19 LVEF%; 9 Kg] by NGS before VAD implant (pre-VAD) and at the moment of heart transplant (Post-VAD). Only hsa-miR-199b-5p, hsa-miR-19a-3p, hsa-miR-1246 were differentially expressed at post-VAD when compared to pre-VAD, and validated by real-time PCR. Putative targets of the selected miRNAs were involved in regulation of sarcomere genes, such as cardiac troponin (cTns) complex. The expression levels of fetal ad adult isoforms of cTns resulted significantly higher after VAD in cardiac tissue of HF pediatric patients when compared with HF adults. An in vitro study confirmed a down-regulatory effect of hsa-miR-19a-3p on cTnC expression.

{"title": "Interindividual heterogeneity affects the outcome of human cardiac tissue decellularization.", "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) of engineered human cardiac tissues corresponds to simplistic biomaterials that allow tissue assembly, or animal derived off-the-shelf non-cardiac specific matrices. Decellularized ECM from human cardiac tissue could provide a means to improve the mimicry of engineered human cardiac tissues. Decellularization of cardiac tissue samples using immersion-based methods can produce acceptable cardiac ECM scaffolds; however, these protocols are mostly described for animal tissue preparations. We have tested four methods to decellularize human cardiac tissue and evaluated their efficiency in terms of cell removal and preservation of key ECM components, such as collagens and sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Extended exposure to decellularization agents, namely sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton-X-100, was needed to significantly remove DNA content by approximately 93% in all human donors. However, the biochemical composition of decellularized tissue is affected, and the preservation of ECM architecture is donor dependent. Our results indicate that standardization of decellularization protocols for human tissue is likely unfeasible, and a compromise between cell removal and ECM preservation must be established in accordance with the scaffold's intended application. Notwithstanding, decellularized human cardiac ECM supported human induced pluripotent-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) attachment and retention for up to 2\u00a0weeks of culture, and promoted cell alignment and contraction, providing evidence it could be a valuable tool for cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-10-23", "authors": ["Miguel FTenreiro", "Henrique VAlmeida", "Tom\u00e1sCalmeiro", "ElviraFortunato", "LinoFerreira", "Paula MAlves", "MargaridaSerra"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-00226-5\n10.1038/s41536-021-00140-4\n10.1172/JCI87491\n10.1038/s41578-018-0023-x\n10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.10.004\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.07.033\n10.1038/nm1684\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0392\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306874\n10.1253/circj.CJ-10-0717\n10.1038/ncomms4935\n10.1111/aor.12925\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0120\n10.1002/jbm.a.35000\n10.1038/nprot.2014.024\n10.1021/acsabm.0c01490\n10.1038/s41598-017-08713-4\n10.1002/bit.26504\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057\n10.1089/ten.tec.2014.0321\n10.1038/nm.2170\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.083\n10.1007/s11357-017-9959-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.09.006\n10.1039/C3BM60283D\n10.2527/1995.7351351x\n10.1016/j.jprot.2013.05.004\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0586\n10.1089/ten.tec.2011.0210\n10.1007/s10439-015-1404-6\n10.1002/prca.201500048\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0267\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.04.003\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.09.057\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120554\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.03.004"}

Cinnamomi ramulus (CR), is an important folk medicinal plant in China, which derived from the dried twig of Cinnamomum cassia (L.) Presl, has function of \"warming and tonifying heart yang\", and traditionally utilized to treat the cold, blood-cold amenorrhea, phlegm, edema, arthralgia, and palpitations as well as improve blood circulation. The aqueous extract of C. ramulus was reported to show significant therapeutic potential for treating MI/RI. Whereas, there are no previous investigations in China or abroad has reported the cardioprotective effects and underlying mechanism of the ethyl acetate extract of C. ramulus (CREAE) and its bioactive substance cinnamic acid (CA) in triggering NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis.\nThe present study aimed to assess the cardioprotective function of CREAE and CA against the MI/RI in rats and involved the underlying mechanisms.\nThe MI/RI model was established in male SD rats by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30\u00a0min followed by reperfusion for 120\u00a0min, respectively. The rats were intragastrically administered with CREAE (74 and 37\u00a0mg/kg) and CA (45\u00a0mg/kg) for 7 successive days before vascular ligation. The cardioprotective effects of CREAE and CA against myocardial injury of rats were detected by HE staining, TTC staining, echocardiograms, and myocardial enzymes detections. Serum levels of inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, were analyzed by ELISA kits to evaluate the effects of CREAE and CA.

{"title": "Functional Effects of Cardiomyocyte Injury in COVID-19.", "abstract": "COVID-19 affects multiple organs. Clinical data from the Mount Sinai Health System show that substantial numbers of COVID-19 patients without prior heart disease develop cardiac dysfunction. How COVID-19 patients develop cardiac disease is not known. We integrated cell biological and physiological analyses of human cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the presence of interleukins (ILs) with clinical findings related to laboratory values in COVID-19 patients to identify plausible mechanisms of cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients. We infected hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from healthy human subjects with SARS-CoV-2 in the absence and presence of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Infection resulted in increased numbers of multinucleated cells. Interleukin treatment and infection resulted in disorganization of myofibrils, extracellular release of troponin I, and reduced and erratic beating. Infection resulted in decreased expression of mRNA encoding key proteins of the cardiomyocyte contractile apparatus. Although interleukins did not increase the extent of infection, they increased the contractile dysfunction associated with viral infection of cardiomyocytes, resulting in cessation of beating. Clinical data from hospitalized patients from the Mount Sinai Health System show that a significant portion of COVID-19 patients without history of heart disease have elevated troponin and interleukin levels. A substantial subset of these patients showed reduced left ventricular function by echocardiography. Our laboratory observations, combined with the clinical data, indicate that direct effects on cardiomyocytes by interleukins and SARS-CoV-2 infection might underlie heart disease in COVID-19 patients.

{"title": "The effects of quercetin on seizure, inflammation parameters and oxidative stress in acute on chronic tramadol intoxication.", "abstract": "Tramadol is a widely used synthetic opioid for moderate to severe pain. Some studies have shown that tramadol can increase oxidative stress in different tissues of the body. Quercetin is also a substance with various biological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective activities. The current investigation aimed at determining the effects of quercetin, with or without naloxone, on tramadol intoxication.\nThis study was performed on 30 male Wistar rats divided into five groups: Group I) control group: intraperitoneal injections of normal saline 0.9% for 14\u2009days; Group II) tramadol: 25\u2009mg/kg for 14\u2009days, and then a 50\u2009mg/kg acute dose injection on the last day; Group III) acute quercetin (single dose): tramadol injection as with the second group plus 100\u2009mg/kg of quercetin on the last day; Group IV) chronic quercetin: tramadol injection similar to the second group plus quercetin 100\u2009mg/kg for 14\u2009days; Group V) quercetin plus naloxone: tramadol injection similar to the second group plus injection of quercetin 100\u2009mg/kg\u2009+\u2009intravenous naloxone 2\u2009mg/kg on the last day, followed by a 4\u2009mg/kg/h injection of naloxone for six hours. The rats were monitored for six hours on the last day, relating to the number and severity of seizures. Finally, the samples were prepared for biochemical investigation of the serum level of oxidative stress markers (MDA, SOD, NOx), inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), biochemical parameters (ALT, AST, creatinine, glucose) and hematological assay. The liver, heart, kidney, cortex, cerebellum, and adrenal tissues were collected to investigate the redox state.\nNone of the treatments had positive effects on the number and severity of seizures. Chronic administration of quercetin led to alteration of some blood parameters, including reduced hemoglobin level and elevated platelet counts.

However, it is unclear whether the effects of these mitogens are species-specific and how they directly compare in the same cardiac setting. Here, we examined how CM-specific lentiviral expression of various candidate mitogens affects human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs) and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) in vitro. In 2D-cultured CMs from both species, and in highly mature 3D-engineered cardiac tissues generated from NRVMs, a constitutively active mutant form of the human gene Erbb2 (cahErbb2) was the most potent tested mitogen. Persistent expression of cahErbb2 induced CM proliferation, sarcomere loss, and remodeling of tissue structure and function, which were attenuated by small molecule inhibitors of Erk signaling.

Therefore, engineering hybrid 3D printed platforms that can modulate the MI microenvironment for improving implant acceptance has surfaced as a critical requirement for reconstructing an infarcted heart. Here, we have employed a non-mulberry silk-based conductive bioink comprising carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to bioprint functional 3D vascularized anisotropic cardiac constructs. Immunofluorescence staining, polymerase chain reaction-based gene expression studies, and electrophysiological studies showed that the inclusion of CNTs in the bioink played a significant role in upregulating matured cardiac biomarkers, sarcomere formation, and beating rate while promoting cardiomyocyte viability. These constructs were then microinjected with calcium peroxide and IL-10-loaded gelatin methacryloyl microspheres. Measurements of oxygen concentration revealed that these microspheres upheld the oxygen availability for maintaining cellular viability for at least 5 days in a hypoxic environment.

However, the function and mechanism of hsa_circ_105039 in CHD are unclear. In the present study, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes using 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cell differentiation, viability, migration and apoptosis were measured before and following hsa_circ_105039 knockdown or overexpression. The results indicated that hsa_circ_105039 overexpression promoted cell differentiation, viability and migration; whereas apoptosis was simultaneously repressed. A luciferase reporter assay verified that hsa_circ_105039 acted as a sponge for microRNA (miR)\u201117 and that cyclinD2 was a direct target of miR\u201117. Furthermore, differentiation\u2011related genes and proteins were analyzed by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. The results showed that hsa_circ_105039 could also upregulate the expression of differentiation\u2011related genes and proteins, including natriuretic peptide A, cardiac troponin\u00a0I, GATA\u2011binding protein\u00a04 and homobox transcription factor, in iPS cells.

{"title": "Cardiovascular Risk Associated With TNF Alpha Inhibitor Use in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.", "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and pannus formation, with subsequent joint and cartilage degradation. Treatment commonly targets inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, which is a potent inflammatory cytokine required for cell signaling, regulation, and apoptosis, as well as for other cellular functions including immune response. TNF alpha inhibitors have demonstrated benefits in improving RA patient outcomes\u00a0in terms of immune function and symptomatology. While TNF alpha inhibitors are generally beneficial, some studies have demonstrated that TNF alpha inhibitors may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. While this continues to be debated, our study investigates the role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNFR1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 2 (TNFR2)\u00a0in cardiac tissue. TNFR1 is an apoptotic receptor and its inhibition by TNF alpha inhibitors is subsequently cardioprotective. However, TNF alpha inhibitors may be inhibiting TNFR2 receptors even more so than TNFR1 receptors.

{"title": "Kolaviron attenuates cardiovascular injury in fructose-streptozotocin induced type-2 diabetic male rats by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and improving cardiovascular risk markers.", "abstract": "The prevalence of cardiovascular disease among type-2 diabetic patients has become a source of major concern world over. This study explored the protective effect of kolaviron, a bioflavonoid, against oxidative cardiovascular injury in fructose- streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic male Sprague Dawley rats. After acclimatization, induction, and confirmation of type-2 diabetes, kolaviron was administered for 28days, after which the animals were anesthetized with Isofor and euthanized. Blood from each rat were collected, and blood samples were then centrifuged for serum and plasma. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), Creatine phosphokinase (CK), and insulin levels were immediately determined in serum, while remaining samples (serum, plasma, and organs) were stored in the bio-freezer at -\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C and 10% formalin for enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA), biochemical, molecular, and histopathological studies. The results show that type-2 diabetes induction with fructose and streptozotocin led to increased blood glucose levels, decreased insulin levels and cardiac antioxidant enzyme activities, increased malondialdehyde levels, cardiac biomarkers and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, resulted in abnormal lipid profile, increased blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and decreased plasma endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) concentration. The histopathological examination of the cardiac tissue revealed severe lesion, hypertrophy, and myofibrils degeneration. However, administration of kolaviron for 28days remarkably improved these conditions. Hence the result from the study validates the potency of kolaviron, and suggests it could serve as an alternative to existing remedy in ameliorating or protecting against cardiovascular injury in type-2 diabetes.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2021-10-17", "authors": ["Jeffrey OAdoga", "Mahendra LChanna", "AnandNadar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112323"}

Abnormal wave propagation in the heart, e.g., spiral waves, can lead to sudden cardiac arrest.

A generic anatomical model of the left ventricle of the human heart and the Aliev-Panfilov model for cardiac tissue were used. The study showed that the source of such arrhythmia is elongated filaments with lengths that can be 10-20 times greater than the characteristic thickness of the heart wall. In anisotropic tissue, the filament elongated before it was annihilated at the base of the heart. The spiral waves were eliminated through overdrive pacing with stimulation periods from 0.8 to 0.95 relative to the spiral wave period.

Clinically, the LMNA variant carriers presented with severe familial DCM, conduction disease, and high creatine-kinase level.

After 2 weeks, the 28 surviving rats with obvious left ventricular dysfunction in the ISO group were randomized into three medication groups, including the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan group (S/V, n=9), the dapa group (n=9), and the ISO group (n=10) for 4 weeks. Next, electrical programmed stimulation was performed in all the groups to evaluate their susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Compared to the ISO rats, the dapa administration not only effectively reduced the cumulative risk of death, the myocardial fibrosis, the plasma angiotensin II levels and its functional receptor AT1R protein expressions in the heart, and the proinflammatory cytokine levels in the cardiac tissue of the ISO-treated rats, but it also improved their cardiac function and inhibited oxidative stress. These effects were similar to S/V. However, dapa showed a greater efficacy than S/V in reducing the left ventricular end-diastolic volumes, lowing the heart rates and VAs, and decreasing the body weights and plasma glucose levels. The mechanisms by which dapa exerts protective effects on cardiomyopathy may be related to its indirect antioxidant capacity and direct hypoglycemic action.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2021-10-16", "authors": ["Fang-ZhengWang", "Wen-BoWei", "XinLi", "Jun-YuHuo", "Wan-YingJiang", "Hong-YuWang", "PeiQian", "Zhen-ZhenLi", "Ye-BoZhou"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Polysaccharide-Protein Multilayers Based on Chitosan-Fibrinogen Assemblies for Cardiac Cell Engineering.", "abstract": "The cell and tissue culture substrates play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. The surface properties of the materials control a wide variety of cell functions. Amongst various methods, layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a versatile surface coating technique for creating controllable bio-coatings. Here, polysaccharide/protein multilayers are proposed, which are fabricated by immersive LbL assembly and based on the chitosan/fibrinogen pair for improving the adhesion and spreading of cardiomyocytes. Two approaches in LbL assembly are employed for clarifying the effect of the bilayers order and their concentration on cardiomyocytes viability and morphology. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements show that the adsorption of the biopolymers is enhanced during the LbL deposition in a synergistic manner. Contact angle measurements indicate that the multilayers are alternating from less to more hydrophilic behavior depending on the biopolymer that is added last. Confocal microscopy with immunostained fibrinogen reveals that the amount of the protein is higher when the concentration of the immersion solution is increased, however, for low solution concentration it is speculated that interdigitation between the separate biopolymer layers takes place. This work motivates the use of fibrinogen in polysaccharide/protein multilayers for enhanced cytocompatibility in cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Macromolecular bioscience", "date": "2021-10-15", "authors": ["MariaKitsara", "GeorgeTassis", "AristeidisPapagiannopoulos", "AlexandreSimon", "OnnikAgbulut", "StergiosPispas"], "doi": "10.1002/mabi.202100346"}
{"title": "Longitudinal impact on rat cardiac tissue transcriptomic profiles due to acute intratracheal inhalation exposures to isoflurane.", "abstract": "Isoflurane (ISO) is a widely used inhalation anesthetic in experiments with rodents and humans during surgery. Though ISO has not been reported to impart long-lasting side effects, it is unknown if ISO can influence gene regulation in certain tissues, including the heart. Such changes could have important implications for use of this anesthetic in patients susceptible to heart failure/other cardiac abnormalities. To test if ISO could alter gene regulation/expression in heart tissues, and if such changes were reversible, prolonged, or late onset with time, SHR (spontaneously hypertensive) rats were exposed by intratracheal inhalation to a 97.5% air/2.5% ISO mixture on two consecutive days (2 hr/d). Control rats breathed filtered air only. On Days 1, 30, 240, and 360 post-exposure, rat hearts were collected and total RNA was extracted from the left ventricle for global gene expression analysis. The data revealed differentially-expressed genes (DEG) in response to ISO (compared to na\u00efve control) at all post-exposure timepoints. The data showed acute ISO exposures led to DEG associated with wounding, local immune function, inflammation, and circadian rhythm regulation at Days 1 and 30; these effects dissipated by Day 240. There were other significantly-increased DEG induced by ISO at Day 360; these included changes in expression of genes associated with cell signaling, differentiation, and migration, extracellular matrix organization, cell-substrate adhesion, heart development, and blood pressure regulation. Examination of consistent DEG at Days 240 and 360 indicated late onset DEG reflecting potential long-lasting effects from ISO; these included DEG associated with oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, angiogenesis, mitochondrial translation elongation, and focal adhesion. Together, the data show acute repeated ISO exposures could impart variable effects on gene expression/regulation in the heart. While some alterations self-resolved, others appeared to be long-lasting or late onset. Whether such changes occur in all rat models or in humans remains to be investigated.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2021-10-15", "authors": ["Sung-HyunPark", "YutingLu", "YongzhaoShao", "ColetteProphete", "LoriHorton", "MaureenSisco", "Hyun-WookLee", "ThomasKluz", "HongSun", "MaxCosta", "JudithZelikoff", "Lung-ChiChen", "Mitchell DCohen"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0257241\n10.1177/026119290503300207\n10.1258/la.2010.009085\n10.1097/00000542-200301000-00005\n10.1111/j.0001-5172.2004.00391.x\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000001120\n10.2146/ajhp050460\n10.1124/jpet.111.185272\n10.1007/s100720050063\n10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334387\n10.1098/rsbl.2012.1000\n10.1186/2045-9912-2-22\n10.1097/ALN.0b013e318298e5f1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052469\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2012.05.009\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000000567\n10.1007/s12012-018-9455-1\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000000807\n10.1139/bcb-2019-0188\n10.1007/s13258-019-00913-8\n10.2131/jts.45.69\n10.1002/jcp.28862\n10.3892/mmr.2019.10056\n10.2741/4302\n10.1371/journal.pone.0055276\n10.3390/ijms13010977\n10.26355/eurrev_201806_15282\n10.1213/ANE.0b013e31827b27b0\n10.1152/ajpheart.1979.237.4.H461\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.07.018\n10.1038/jes.2013.68\n10.1080/08941930600778297\n10.3109/1547691X.2014.914609\n10.3390/ijerph13040417\n10.1016/j.taap.2015.07.003\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1093/nar/gks042\n10.1038/s41467-019-09234-6\n10.1538/expanim.16-0015\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000668\n10.26355/eurrev_201902_17029\n10.1152/ajpcell.00006.2010\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.12.022\n10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182a231b5\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000000037\n10.1213/ANE.0b013e318281e988\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2003.07.012\n10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.09.006\n10.1097/WNR.0000000000000509\n10.1016/j.brainres.2016.10.014\n10.1016/j.abb.2019.108181\n10.1016/j.bja.2018.12.008\n10.1213/ANE.0000000000004955\n10.1371/journal.pone.0242989\n10.1016/j.neuropharm.2014.03.011\n10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181ca33a1\n10.1111/cns.13090\n10.1067/S0894-7317(03)00471-1\n10.1177/153537020523001012\n10.1017/s0265021505000384\n10.1152/ajpheart.00181.2016\n10.1055/s-2004-814104\n10.1097/00000542-199007000-00013\n10.1038/gim.2014.210\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1006127\n10.1111/j.1467-2995.2011.00668.x\n10.4103/aer.AER_174_17\n10.1152/ajpheart.1981.241.6.H821\n10.1292/jvms.14-0146\n10.1055/s-0033-1345173\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.1997.tb00693.x\n10.1186/s13063-015-1083-5"}

The prevalence of haemosporidians in several hummingbird species was examined and we compared 4 different tissue types in detecting parasites by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

{"title": "miR-29a-3p/THBS2 Axis Regulates PAH-Induced Cardiac Fibrosis.", "abstract": "Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) pathology involves extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in cardiac tissues, thus promoting cardiac fibrosis progression. miR-29a-3p reportedly inhibits lung progression and liver fibrosis by regulating ECM protein expression; however, its role in PAH-induced fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-29a-3p in cardiac fibrosis progression in PAH and its influence on ECM protein thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) expression. The diagnostic and prognostic values of miR-29a-3p and THBS2 in PAH were evaluated. The expressions and effects of miR-29a-3p and THBS2 were assessed in cell culture, monocrotaline-induced PAH mouse model, and patients with PAH. The levels of circulating miR-29a-3p and THBS2 in patients and mice with PAH decreased and increased, respectively. miR-29a-3p directly targets THBS2 and regulates THBS2 expression via a direct anti-fibrotic effect on PAH-induced cardiac fibrosis. The circulating levels of miR-29a-3p and THBS2 were correlated with PAH diagnostic parameters, suggesting their independent prognostic value. miR-29a-3p targeted THBS2 expression via a direct anti-fibrotic effect on PAH-induced cardiac fibrosis, indicating miR-29a-3p acts as a messenger with promising therapeutic effects.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-10-14", "authors": ["Chih-HsinHsu", "I-FanLiu", "Hsuan-FuKuo", "Chia-YangLi", "Wei-ShiungLian", "Chia-YuanChang", "Yung-HsiangChen", "Wei-LunLiu", "Chi-YuLu", "Yu-RuLiu", "Tzu-ChiehLin", "Tsung-YingLee", "Chi-YuanHuang", "Chong-ChaoHsieh", "Po-LenLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms221910574\n10.1164/rccm.201409-1742OC\n10.1093/cvr/cvw014\n10.1152/ajpheart.00136.2018\n10.21037/cdt-20-592\n10.7150/thno.44687\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.311148\n10.1152/physrev.00008.2011\n10.1016/j.matbio.2019.03.002\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.06.006\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.863266\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.10.003\n10.3390/ijms18071540\n10.3390/biomedicines9060642\n10.1253/circj.CJ-13-1221\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.05.010\n10.3892/ijmm.2020.4507\n10.1536/ihj.19-042\n10.1164/rccm.201401-0037OC\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01049\n10.1007/s00109-016-1387-2\n10.7150/thno.21274\n10.1038/s41419-018-0392-5\n10.3390/biomedicines9060667\n10.1097/PCC.0000000000002207\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04600\n10.1038/s41598-017-07236-2\n10.1080/08916934.2019.1621856\n10.1165/rcmb.2010-0323OC\n10.1016/j.mce.2018.06.005\n10.1002/hep.23922\n10.1038/s41467-017-01737-4\n10.1093/cvr/cvr344\n10.1016/j.echo.2011.01.015\n10.3791/3740\n10.1111/bph.14781\n10.3390/jcm8060794\n10.1089/omi.2011.0118\n10.1186/1471-2105-12-35\n10.1038/s41598-019-41800-2\n10.1007/s00380-014-0571-y\n10.3324/haematol.2014.119727\n10.1590/s0102-865020190060000002\n10.1038/s41467-019-13306-y\n10.1016/j.carpath.2012.03.005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007917\n10.1093/cvr/cvx187\n10.1164/rccm.201205-0839OC\n10.3892/etm.2020.9042\n10.1038/s12276-018-0068-3\n10.1016/j.hjc.2018.06.004\n10.1159/000475569\n10.15252/emmm.201911303\n10.1016/j.vph.2020.106820\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306806\n10.1177/03000605211002379\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303910\n10.15252/emmm.201303604\n10.1007/s10456-019-09665-1\n10.1186/s13046-019-1078-2\n10.1183/16000617.0125-2016"}

Current treatments of sepsis are largely supportive and clinical trials using specific pharmacotherapy for sepsis have failed to improve outcomes. Here, we used the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse RAW264.7 cell line and AlphaLisa assay for TNFa as a readout to perform a supervised drug repurposing screen for sepsis treatment with compounds targeting epigenetic enzymes, including kinases. We identified the SCH772984 compound, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor, as an effective blocker of TNFa production in vitro. RNA-Seq of the SCH772984-treated RAW264.7 cells at 1, 4, and 24 h time points of LPS challenge followed by functional annotation of differentially expressed genes highlighted the suppression of cellular pathways related to the immune system. SCH772984 treatment improved survival in the LPS-induced lethal endotoxemia and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse models of sepsis, and reduced plasma levels of Ccl2/Mcp1. Functional analyses of RNA-seq datasets for kidney, lung, liver, and heart tissues from SCH772984-treated animals collected at 6 h and 12 h post-CLP revealed a significant downregulation of pathways related to the immune response and platelets activation but upregulation of the extracellular matrix organization and retinoic acid signaling pathways.

{"title": "FAP and FAPI-PET/CT in Malignant and Non-Malignant Diseases: A Perfect Symbiosis?", "abstract": "A fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is an atypical type II transmembrane serine protease with both endopeptidase and post-proline dipeptidyl peptidase activity. FAP is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are found in most epithelial tumors. CAFs have been implicated in promoting tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis and growth and their presence correlates with a poor prognosis. However, FAP can generally be found during the remodeling of the extracellular matrix and therefore can be detected in wound healing and benign diseases. For instance, chronic inflammation, arthritis, fibrosis and ischemic heart tissue after a myocardial infarction are FAP-positive diseases. Therefore, quinoline-based FAP inhibitors (FAPIs) bind with a high affinity not only to tumors but also to a variety of benign pathologic processes. When these inhibitors are radiolabeled with positron emitting radioisotopes, they provide new diagnostic and prognostic tools as well as insights into the role of the microenvironment in a disease.

However, evidence about the effects of co-exposure to As and F on myocardium and their mechanisms remain scarce. Our aim was to fill the gap by establishing rat and H9c2 cell exposure models. We determined the effects of As and/or F exposure on the survival rate, apoptosis rate, morphology and ultrastructure of H9c2 cells; in addition, we tested the related genes and proteins of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and apoptosis in H9c2 cells and rat heart tissues. The results showed that As and/or F exposure induced early apoptosis of H9c2 cells and caused endoplasmic reticulum expansion. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of GRP78, PERK and CHOP in H9c2 cells were higher in the exposure groups than in the control group, and could be inhibited by 4-PBA. Furthermore, we found that As and/or F exposure increased the expression level of GRP78 in rat heart tissues, but interestingly, the expression level of CHOP protein was increased in the F and As groups, while significantly decreased in the co-exposure group. Overall, our results suggested that ERS-induced apoptosis was involved in the damage of myocardium by As and/or F exposure. In addition, factorial analysis results showed that As and F mainly play antagonistic roles in inducing myocardial injury, initiating ERS and apoptosis after exposure.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2021-10-13", "authors": ["MengLi", "JingFeng", "YingCheng", "NishaDong", "XiaolinTian", "PenghuiLiu", "YannanZhao", "YulanQiu", "FengjieTian", "YiLyu", "QianZhao", "CailingWei", "MengWang", "JiyuYuan", "XiaodongYing", "XuefengRen", "XiaoyanYan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132518"}
{"title": "Identification of ferroptosis-associated genes exhibiting altered expression in response to cardiopulmonary bypass during corrective surgery for pediatric tetralogy of fallot.", "abstract": "Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is a life-threatening congenital cardiovascular disorder. Currently, the most effective therapeutic intervention for pediatric ToF remains corrective surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, driven by an accumulation of lipid peroxides to levels sufficient to trigger cell death. Ferroptosis was recently linked to cardiac ischemia and reperfusion injury. However, few studies have examined CPB-associated ferroptosis.\nIn the current study, pediatric ToF patient pre- and post-CPB atrial biopsy gene expression profiles were downloaded from a public database, and 117 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and weighted gene correlation network analysis. These were screened for ferroptosis-associated genes using the FerrDb database, thereby identifying ten genes. Finally, the construction of gene-microRNA (miRNA) and gene-transcription factor (TF) networks, in conjunction with gene ontology and biological pathway enrichment analysis, were used to inform hypotheses regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying CPB-associated ferroptosis.\nTen genes involved in CPB-associated ferroptosis(ATF3,TNFAIP3\uff0cCDKN1A, ZFP36, JUN\uff0cSLC2A3, IL6, CXCL2, PTGS2, and DDIT3). Ferroptosis-associated genes were largely involved in myocardial inflammatory responses and may be regulated by a number of identified miRNAs and TFs, thereby suggesting modulatable pathways potentially involved in CPB-associated ferroptosis.\nResults suggest that CPB precipitates ferroptosis within cardiac tissue during corrective Surgery for Pediatric Tetralogy of Fallot. These findings may ultimately help improve outcomes of corrective surgery for pediatric ToF.", "journal": "Science progress", "date": "2021-10-13", "authors": ["HongtaoLiu", "BingyongZhang", "ShaofengChen", "YunZhang", "XinYe", "YiWei", "GuihongZhong", "LiangqingZhang"], "doi": "10.1177/00368504211050275"}

Male C57BL/6J mice were used to establish a model of RIHD by exposing the entire heart to 16\u00a0Gy high\u2011energy X\u2011rays, and cardiac injuries were verified using a cardiac echocardiogram, as well as by measuring serum brain natriuretic peptide levels and conducting H&E and Masson staining 5\u00a0months after irradiation.

{"title": "Epicardial Contribution to the Developing and Injured Heart: Exploring the Cellular Composition of the Epicardium.", "abstract": "The epicardium is an essential cell population during cardiac development. It contributes different cell types to the developing heart through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and it secretes paracrine factors that support cardiac tissue formation. In the adult heart the epicardium is a quiescent layer of cells which can be reactivated upon ischemic injury, initiating an embryonic-like response in the epicardium that contributes to post-injury repair processes. Therefore, the epicardial layer is considered an interesting target population to stimulate endogenous repair mechanisms. To date it is still not clear whether there are distinct cell populations in the epicardium that contribute to specific lineages or aid in cardiac repair, or that the epicardium functions as a whole. To address this putative heterogeneity, novel techniques such as single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) are being applied. In this review, we summarize the role of the epicardium during development and after injury and provide an overview of the most recent insights into the cellular composition and diversity of the epicardium.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2021-10-12", "authors": ["Thomas JStreef", "Anke MSmits"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2021.750243\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx343\n10.1073/pnas.1408233111\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307676\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311769\n10.1186/s13287-019-1353-3\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aay1318\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.2225\n10.1038/s41569-020-0400-1\n10.3390/biom10050707\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045566\n10.2174/1573403X13666170502103833\n10.1161/01.RES.87.11.969\n10.1161/01.RES.82.10.1043\n10.1242/dev.126.9.1845\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.05.668\n10.1016/j.devcel.2004.12.002\n10.1093/cvr/cvu269\n10.1006/dbio.2002.0796\n10.3389/fcell.2020.621644\n10.1126/science.1077857\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.08.052\n10.1172/JCI88759\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.08.012\n10.1038/s41569-018-0046-4\n10.1002/dvdy.21065\n10.1242/dev.02294\n10.1017/S1431927606060533\n10.1002/dvdy.21378\n10.1186/1471-213X-14-18\n10.1002/dvdy.10335\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136025\n10.1242/dev.127621\n10.1016/j.devcel.2012.01.012\n10.1016/S0925-4773(00)00499-8\n10.1038/nature07060\n10.1006/dbio.1999.9539\n10.1242/dev.005280\n10.1002/dvdy.20487\n10.1100/tsw.2007.294\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259960\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.007\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.06.028\n10.1002/stem.467\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.228809\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.031\n10.1242/dev.079970\n10.1038/nature06969\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.08.044\n10.1096/fj.201902249RR\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305097\n10.1006/meth.2001.1159\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.12.006\n10.1242/dev.067041\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.273946\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.06.002\n10.1038/nature07916\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.04.002\n10.3390/jdb1020092\n10.1016/0925-4773(93)90090-K\n10.1016/S0925-4773(98)00188-9\n10.1038/ng.494\n10.1038/35000025\n10.1002/dvg.22353\n10.1073/pnas.0702415104\n10.1371/journal.pone.0057829\n10.1093/cvr/cvs277\n10.1242/dev.093385\n10.1038/nrm2890\n10.1242/dev.116418\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.01.017\n10.1242/dev.060996\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107739\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.01.023\n10.1093/cvr/cvt210\n10.1101/gad.1411406\n10.1002/dvdy.24639\n10.1242/dev.054239\n10.1073/pnas.0504343102\n10.1242/dev.064410\n10.1016/j.devcel.2015.03.018\n10.1242/dev.190819\n10.1002/dvdy.21469\n10.1002/dvdy.21436\n10.1002/dvdy.20476\n10.1242/dev.00241\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176768\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.235531\n10.1038/cr.2009.5\n10.1002/dvdy.10314\n10.1002/dvdy.20629\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.07.038\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.152082\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.08.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0159710\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.12.022\n10.1172/JCI45529\n10.1038/nature10188\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044692\n10.1038/emboj.2011.418\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.005\n10.1096/fj.02-1065fje\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.01.026\n10.1126/science.1229765\n10.1038/ncomms16034\n10.3390/jdb2020084\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.08.020\n10.1172/jci.insight.96800\n10.1073/pnas.1805829115\n10.1172/JCI93868\n10.1038/ncomms12260\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.06.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.02.007\n10.1038/s41598-020-78600-y\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0159\n10.1371/journal.pone.0207248\n10.1038/s41467-021-21892-z\n10.7554/eLife.65921\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05478.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.300197\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.258616\n10.1038/nature05383\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259846\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1006780\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.10.019\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.668178\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.04.006\n10.1038/nature15372\n10.1038/nbt.2682\n10.7554/eLife.61050\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108472\n10.1242/jcs.023820\n10.1038/ncomms5054\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.08.002\n10.1093/cvr/cvv190\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.07.006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0165497\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316303\n10.1242/dev.197525\n10.1038/nature22978\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045116\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.03.014\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.06.091\n10.1038/s41467-019-14263-2\n10.1038/s41598-020-59868-6\n10.1002/dvdy.22724\n10.1016/j.mvr.2015.08.007\n10.1126/science.abb2986\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.01.023\n10.1242/dev.174441\n10.1186/s13059-018-1416-2\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.079\n10.1038/s41587-020-0465-8\n10.7554/eLife.43882\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.06.092\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.025\n10.1089/scd.2014.0019\n10.1073/pnas.2132126100\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036210\n10.1093/cvr/cvz193\n10.1242/dev.130534\n10.1101/gad.316802.118\n10.1172/JCI98215\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.02.008"}

{"title": "Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) in Cardiac Tissue: Applications and Limitations.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the blood vessels and heart, which are considered as the leading causes of death worldwide. The pathology of CVDs could be related to the functional abnormalities of multiple cell types in the heart. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is a powerful method for characterizing individual cells and elucidating the molecular mechanisms by providing a high resolution of transcriptomic changes at the single-cell level. Specifically, scRNA-seq has provided novel insights into CVDs by identifying rare cardiac cell types, inferring the trajectory tree, estimating RNA velocity, elucidating the cell-cell communication, and comparing healthy and pathological heart samples. In this review, we summarize the different scRNA-seq platforms and published single-cell datasets in the cardiovascular field, and describe the utilities and limitations of this technology.

{"title": "Attenuating effect of Prosopis cineraria against paraquat-induced toxicity in prepubertal mice, Mus musculus.", "abstract": "Several herbicides, especially paraquat, are persistent organic pollutants which cause damage to humans and animals through reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce exhibits antioxidant activity and can effectively manage tremors. Therefore, the present research assessed the preventive effect of Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce ethanolic extract (PCDE) against paraquat-induced toxicity in prepubertal mice. The plant extract was chemically characterized by a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The PCDE was orally administered to prepubertal mice for continuous 21 days, 2 h before paraquat exposure (2 mg/kg for consecutive 3 days per week for 3 weeks). The changes in behavior, motor coordination, memory, muscle movement, anxiety, and neurotransmitter levels in the brain were assessed. Histopathology and estimation of oxidative stress parameters in the brain, liver, kidney, and heart tissues were also carried out. HPLC-DAD analysis showed a high amount of quercetin, kaempferol, and ellagic acid derivatives in the plant extract. The PCDE showed improved muscle coordination, muscle movement and memory, and reduced anxiety in prepubertal mice. Moreover, levels of dopamine and noradrenaline were increased in the brain. It successfully ameliorated the oxidative stress in different organs by increasing the level of glutathione and superoxide dismutase and by reducing malondialdehyde. The histopathological assessment showed the plant extract effectively mitigated paraquat-induced pathological lesions in the neurons, neuroglia, hepatocytes, and kidney tissues. It is concluded from the present study that the treatment with PCDE had prevented the paraquat-induced toxicity in the brain, liver, kidney, and heart through the reduction of oxidative stress possibly due to the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids.", "journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "date": "2021-10-11", "authors": ["Muhammad FurqanAkhtar", "Muhammad OmerMehal", "AmmaraSaleem", "AhmadEl Askary", "Mohamed MAbdel-Daim", "FareehaAnwar", "MuhammadAyaz", "AlamZeb"], "doi": "10.1007/s11356-021-16788-w\n10.1016/j.etap.2016.10.008\n10.1007/s10787-020-00783-7\n10.1155/2015/542542\n10.1007/s12035-018-1148-z\n10.3109/13880209.2012.666253\n10.3109/10715762.2014.899694\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.06.034\n10.1016/j.taap.2012.03.013\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.11.030\n10.1590/S1984-82502012000300025\n10.1007/s12017-016-8435-5\n10.1007/s00330-016-4419-y\n10.3389/fmicb.2019.01754\n10.7897/2230-8407.1007208\n10.1155/2012/735653\n10.4314/tjpr.v15i4.14\n10.5530/pc.2019.1.5\n10.3233/JPD-150685\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2013.06.002\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.01621.x\n10.3389/fnins.2014.00187\n10.1155/2019/9613090\n10.3109/10799893.2012.672994\n10.1007/s00210-020-01931-0\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.071\n10.1002/mds.24996\n10.3389/fphar.2014.00151\n10.1080/02772248.2018.1460369\n10.3329/bjp.v8i4.16684\n10.1016/j.fitote.2018.10.026\n10.4103/0975-7406.124317\n10.1016/j.fct.2015.01.018\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.073\n10.1155/2012/624925\n10.1039/C5AY01402F\n10.1177/1759091418777438\n10.1111/jfbc.13199"}

Reintroduction of LIN28a in adult CTSC (CTSC-LIN) increased proliferation, survival, expression of pluripotency genes and reduced senescence compared to control (CTSC-GFP). Metabolomic analysis show glycolytic intermediates upregulated in CTSC-LIN together with increased lactate production, pyruvate kinase activity, glucose uptake, ECAR and expression of glycolytic enzymes compared to CTSC-GFP. Additionally, CTSC-LIN showed significantly reduced ROS generation and increase antioxidant markers. In response to H2O2 induced oxidative stress, CTSC-LIN showed increased survival and expression of glycolytic genes.

GSTs play an important role in responding to environmental stresses. This study aimed to identify the GST gene superfamily in silver sillago (Sillago sihama) and analyze its expression pattern under hypoxia stress. A total of 17 GST genes were identified in silver sillago. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the GST gene family contained two subgroups (cytosolic and MAPEGs), and lacked three subgroups (i.e. Pi, Kappa, and MGST2). Phylogenetic and syntenic analysis revealed that GST genes were conserved in evolution. Eight SsGSTs were significantly differentially expressed under hypoxia stress in silver sillago by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis. The expression levels of SsMGST3b, SsGSTO1, SsGSTT1b and SsGSTR2 genes were significantly up-regulated after 4\u00a0h of reoxygenation in the gill tissue. In the heart tissue, the expression of SsGSTR3 was significantly up-regulated after 1\u00a0h of hypoxia while the expression levels of SsGSTT1b and SsFLAP genes were significantly down-regulated after 4\u00a0h of hypoxia.

Clinical efforts involving the delivery of growth factors (GFs) and stem cells with the aim of regenerating cardiomyocytes for the recovery of structural and functional integrity have largely failed to deliver, mainly due to short half-lives and rapid clearance in in vivo environments. In this work, we selected and genetically fused four biofunctional peptides possessing angiogenic potential, originating from extracellular matrix proteins and GFs, to bioengineered mussel adhesive protein (MAP). We found that MAPs fused with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-derived peptide and fibronectin-derived RGD peptide significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in vitro. Based on these characteristics, we fabricated advanced double-layered adhesive microneedle bandages (DL-AMNBs) consisting of a biofunctional MAP-based root and a regenerated silk fibroin (SF)-based tip, allowing homogeneous distribution of the regenerative factor via swellable microneedles. Our developed DL-AMNB system clearly demonstrated better preservation of cardiac muscle and regenerative effects on heart remodeling in a rat MI model, which might be attributed to the prolonged retention of therapeutic peptides as well as secure adhesion between the patch and host myocardium by MAP-inherent strong underwater adhesiveness.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2021-10-09", "authors": ["SoomeeLim", "Tae YoonPark", "Eun YoungJeon", "Kye IlJoo", "Hyung JoonCha"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121171"}
{"title": "Pulsed low-energy stimulation initiates electric turbulence in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Interruptions in nonlinear wave propagation, commonly referred to as wave breaks, are typical of many complex excitable systems. In the heart they lead to lethal rhythm disorders, the so-called arrhythmias, which are one of the main causes of sudden death in the industrialized world. Progress in the treatment and therapy of cardiac arrhythmias requires a detailed understanding of the triggers and dynamics of these wave breaks. In particular, two very important questions are: 1) What determines the potential of a wave break to initiate re-entry? and 2) How do these breaks evolve such that the system is able to maintain spatiotemporally chaotic electrical activity? Here we approach these questions numerically using optogenetics in an in silico model of human atrial tissue that has undergone chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) remodelling. In the lesser studied sub-threshold illumination r\u00e9gime, we discover a new mechanism of wave break initiation in cardiac tissue that occurs for gentle slopes of the restitution characteristics. This mechanism involves the creation of conduction blocks through a combination of wavefront-waveback interaction, reshaping of the wave profile and heterogeneous recovery from the excitation of the spatially extended medium, leading to the creation of re-excitable windows for sustained re-entry. This finding is an important contribution to cardiac arrhythmia research as it identifies scenarios in which low-energy perturbations to cardiac rhythm can be potentially life-threatening.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2021-10-09", "authors": ["RupamanjariMajumder", "SayedehHussaini", "Vladimir SZykov", "StefanLuther", "EberhardBodenschatz"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009476\n10.1063/5.0011506\n10.1371/journal.pone.0221401\n10.1073/pnas.93.3.1151\n10.1063/1.165848\n10.1063/1.466650\n10.1073/pnas.87.22.8785\n10.1097/00001503-199904000-00013\n10.1103/PhysRevE.85.046216\n10.1021/jp9616674\n10.1016/S0960-0779(01)00154-0\n10.1038/366322a0\n10.1103/PhysRevE.52.98\n10.1007/s10773-008-9790-2\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.964247\n10.1038/nmeth.f.324\n10.7554/eLife.41076\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005591\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.196\n10.1038/srep35628\n10.1172/JCI88950\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw574\n10.1093/cvr/cvx250\n10.1038/srep06125\n10.1038/s41598-017-09092-6\n10.7554/eLife.59954\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.275.1.H301\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050883\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00034-6\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.01.020\n10.1529/biophysj.105.060459\n10.1152/ajpheart.01376.2007\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003220\n10.1038/ncomms3370\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000031334.49170.FB\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2004.04337.x\n10.14814/phy2.13449\n10.1063/1.1504242\n10.1152/jappl.1968.25.2.191\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.2182\n10.1016/0167-2789(94)90228-3\n10.1063/1.166206\n10.1137/S0036139993259337\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2001.00196.x\n10.1056/NEJM199401273300402\n10.1161/01.RES.0000240542.03986.e7\n10.1529/biophysj.106.091009\n10.1038/srep24334\n10.1172/JCI113706\n10.1046/j.1365-201X.1998.00362.x\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb15084.x\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.2995\n10.1063/1.166465\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2000.tb00051.x\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.248\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.3964\n10.1103/PhysRevE.63.041912\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2002.01141.x\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.08.003\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.06.019\n10.1209/0295-5075/92/60006\n10.1016/j.physrep.2014.05.002"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective Effects of Oroxylum indicum Extract Against Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-Induced Cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Administration of Chemotherapeutics, especially doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide (CPS), is commonly associated with adverse effects such as myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. At this time, few approved therapeutic options are currently available for the management of chemotherapy-associated cardiotoxicity. Thus, identification of novel therapeutics with potent cardioprotective properties and minimal adverse effects are pertinent in treating Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity. Oroxylum indicum extract (OIE, Sabroxy\u00ae) is a natural product known to possess several beneficial biological functions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. We therefore set to investigate the cardioprotective effects of OIE against Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity and explore the potential cardioprotective mechanisms involved. Adult male mice were treated with DOX and CPS in combination, OIE alone, or a combination of OIE and DOX & CPS. Swimming test was performed to assess cardiac function. Markers of oxidative stress were assessed by levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrite, hydrogen peroxide, catalase, and glutathione content. The activity of interleukin converting enzyme and cyclooxygenase was determined as markers of inflammation. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring Complex-I activity. Apoptosis was assessed by Caspase-3 and protease activity. Mice treated with DOX and CPS exhibited reduced swim rate, increased oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and apoptosis in the heart tissue. These cardiotoxic effects were significantly reduced by co-administration of OIE. Furthermore, computational molecular docking studies revealed potential binding of DOX and CPS to tyrosine hydroxylase which validated our in vivo findings regarding the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Our current findings indicated that OIE counteracts Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity-through inhibition of ROS-mediated apoptosis and by blocking the effect on tyrosine hydroxylase. Taken together, our findings suggested that OIE possesses cardioprotective effects to counteract potentially fatal cardiac complications associated with chemotherapy treatment.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2021-10-09", "authors": ["Satyanarayana RPondugula", "AishaHarshan", "SindhuRamesh", "ManojGovindarajulu", "MohammedAlmaghrabi", "MohammedMajrashi", "Kodye LAbbott", "RishiNadar", "MansourAlturki", "Julia MSalamat", "ForrestSmith", "MuhammedMajeed", "KalyanamNagabhushanam", "TimothyMoore", "JunRen", "MuralikrishnanDhanasekaran"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-021-09701-x\n10.1177/2324709613480346\n10.1124/mi.7.3.6\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207936\n10.3389/fnins.2015.00131\n10.3892/mmr.2017.6272\n10.1016/j.jaim.2017.06.007\n10.1080/10715762.2017.1381694\n10.1039/c8fo00466h\n10.4103/0250-474X.98981\n10.1080/14786419.2019.1650359\n10.1096/fasebj.12.10.905\n10.1097/PSY.0b013e31825ca8e5\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.02.028\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.07.052\n10.1080/15376516.2020.1760984\n10.1080/15376516.2017.1376024\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117702\n10.1002/vms3.296\n10.1016/j.lfs.2017.03.004\n10.1016/j.ab.2012.09.005\n10.1016/j.abb.2010.12.017\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.1994.63062014.x\n10.2165/00003088-200746120-00005\n10.1016/s0167-8140(02)00003-8\n10.1155/2019/1562038\n10.4103/0974-8490.110543\n10.1177/1934578X211016966\n10.1007/s00436-015-4864-6\n10.1016/j.bbi.2012.10.012\n10.1016/j.bbr.2018.12.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0217437\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.02.013\n10.1038/s41418-019-0372-z\n10.1161/01.RES.0000166925.45995.ed\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0704365\n10.1634/theoncologist.11-4-342\n10.3389/fonc.2017.00118\n10.1002/med.21476"}
{"title": "Stop the beat to see the rhythm: excitation-contraction uncoupling in cardiac research.", "abstract": "Optical mapping is an imaging technique that is extensively used in cardiovascular research, wherein parameter-sensitive fluorescent indicators are used to study the electrophysiology and excitation-contraction coupling of cardiac tissues. Despite many benefits of optical mapping, eliminating motion artifacts within the optical signals is a major challenge, as myocardial contraction interferes with the faithful acquisition of action potentials and intracellular calcium transients. As such, excitation-contraction uncoupling agents are frequently used to reduce signal distortion by suppressing contraction. When compared with other uncoupling agents, blebbistatin is the most frequently used, as it offers increased potency with minimal direct effects on cardiac electrophysiology. Nevertheless, blebbistatin may exert secondary effects on electrical activity, metabolism, and coronary flow, and the incorrect administration of blebbistatin to cardiac tissue can prove detrimental, resulting in erroneous interpretation of optical mapping results. In this \"Getting It Right\" perspective, we briefly review the literature regarding the use of blebbistatin in cardiac optical mapping experiments, highlight potential secondary effects of blebbistatin on cardiac electrical activity and metabolic demand, and conclude with the consensus of the authors on best practices for effectively using blebbistatin in optical mapping studies of cardiac tissue.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Biventricular Myocardial Fibrosis and Sudden Death in Patients With Brugada\u00a0Syndrome.", "abstract": "Electrophysiological, imaging, and pathological studies have reported the presence of subtle structural abnormalities in hearts from patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS). However, data concerning disease involvement outside of the right ventricular outflow tract are limited.\nThis study sought to characterize the presence and distribution of ventricular myocardial fibrosis in a cohort of decedents experiencing sudden cardiac death caused by BrS.\nThe authors evaluated 28 whole hearts from consecutive sudden cardiac death cases attributed to BrS and 29 hearts from a comparator group comprised of noncardiac deaths (control subjects). Cardiac tissue from 6 regions across the right and left ventricle were stained with Picrosirius red for collagen and tissue composition was determined using image analysis software. Postmortem genetic testing was performed in cases with DNA retained for analysis.\nOf 28 BrS decedents (75% men; median age of death 25 years), death occurred in sleep or at rest in 24 of 28 (86%).

Among these is heart failure after myocardial infarction whose latest therapeutic methods are limited to slowing the end-state progression. Numerous strategies have been developed to meet the increased demand for therapies regarding CVDs. This study aimed to establish a novel electrically conductive elastomer-based composite and assess its potential as a cardiac patch for myocardial tissue engineering. The electrically conductive carbon aerogels (CAs) used in this study were derived from waste paper as a cost-effective carbon source and they were combined with the biodegradable poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS) elastomer to obtain an electrically conductive cardiac patch material. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the conductive composites obtained by the incorporation of CAs into PGS (CA-PGS). In this context, the incorporation of the CAs into the polymeric matrix significantly improved the elastic modulus (from 0.912 MPa for the pure PGS elastomer to 0.366 MPa for the CA-PGS) and the deformability (from 0.792 MPa for the pure PGS to 0.566 MPa for CA-PGS). Overall, the mechanical properties of the obtained structures were observed similar to the native myocardium.

Xenotransplantation is considered a potential option, but is yet to reach clinical practice. Although remarkable progress has been made in overcoming immunological rejection, issues with functionality are still to be resolved. Bioengineering approaches have been used to create cardiac tissues with optimized functions. The use of decellularized xenogeneic cardiac tissues seeded with donor-derived cardiac cells may prove to be a viable strategy as supporting structures of the native tissue such as vasculature can be utilized. Here we used sequential perfusion to decellularize adult rat hearts. The acellular scaffolds were reseeded with human endothelial cells, human fibroblasts, human mesenchymal stem cells, and cardiac cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. The ability of the resultant recellularized rat scaffolds to activate human na\u00efve neutrophils in vitro was investigated to measure xenogeneic recognition. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to cadaveric xenogeneic hearts, acellular and recellularized xenogeneic scaffolds did not activate human na\u00efve neutrophils and suggest that decellularization removes the xenogeneic antigens that lead to human na\u00efve neutrophil activation thus allowing human cells to populate the now \"allogenized\" xenogeneic scaffolds.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining.\nPhoenixin-14 was significantly downregulated in the cardiac tissue of diabetic mice. The myocardial injury and deteriorated cardiac function in diabetic mice induced by STZ were significantly ameliorated by Phoenixin-14, accompanied by the alleviation of cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, the severe oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetic mice were dramatically mitigated by Phoenixin-14. Lastly, the downregulated SIRT3 and upregulated p-FOXO3 in diabetic mice were pronouncedly reversed by Phoenixin-14. It is worth mentioning that compared to the Control, no significant changes to any of the investigated parameters in the present study were found in the Phoenixin-14-treated normal mice, suggesting that treatment with it has no side effects.\nOur data revealed that Phoenixin-14 protected against cardiac damages in STZ-induced diabetes mice models.", "journal": "Archives of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2021-10-08", "authors": ["BoYao", "JunlinLv", "LeDu", "HuiZhang", "ZhaoXu"], "doi": "10.1080/13813455.2021.1981946"}

{"title": "Highly Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Human Cardiomyocytes: Spike Protein-Mediated Cell Fusion and Its Inhibition.", "abstract": "Severe cardiovascular complications can occur in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in spontaneously beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor but not the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that mediates spike protein cleavage in the lungs. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-CMs was prolific; viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CMs, smooth-walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65- to 90-nm particles with canonical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads in hiPSC-CMs, we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm cell-to-cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin and furin-like proteases abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that disrupts the multibasic furin cleavage motif was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in hiPSC-CMs and furin, and/or furin-like-protease activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform enables target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19.

The therapeutic potential of ADMSC for treating MI was evaluated by electrocardiogram (ECG), biochemical analysis, molecular genetic analysis and histological examination. Treatment of MI-challenged rats with ADMSC improved ECG findings, which were corroborated by significant decreases in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) enzyme activities together with reduced serum troponin T (cTnT) and connexin 43 (Cx43) levels.

{"title": "Spatial metabolomics identifies localized chemical changes in heart tissue during chronic cardiac Chagas Disease.", "abstract": "Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is one of nineteen neglected tropical diseases. CD is a vector-borne disease transmitted by triatomines, but CD can also be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ transplants, T. cruzi-contaminated food and drinks, and congenital transmission. While endemic to the Americas, T. cruzi infects 7-8 million people worldwide and can induce severe cardiac symptoms including apical aneurysms, thromboembolisms and arrhythmias during the chronic stage of CD. However, these cardiac clinical manifestations and CD pathogenesis are not fully understood. Using spatial metabolomics (chemical cartography), we sought to understand the localized impact of chronic CD on the cardiac metabolome of mice infected with two divergent T. cruzi strains. Our data showed chemical differences in localized cardiac regions upon chronic T. cruzi infection, indicating that parasite infection changes the host metabolome at specific sites in chronic CD. These sites were distinct from the sites of highest parasite burden. In addition, we identified acylcarnitines and glycerophosphocholines as discriminatory chemical families within each heart region, comparing infected and uninfected samples. Overall, our study indicated global and positional metabolic differences common to infection with different T. cruzi strains and identified select infection-modulated pathways.

{"title": "Generating Self-Assembling Human Heart Organoids Derived from Pluripotent Stem Cells.", "abstract": "The ability to study human cardiac development in health and disease is highly limited by the capacity to model the complexity of the human heart in vitro. Developing more efficient organ-like platforms that can model complex in vivo phenotypes, such as organoids and organs-on-a-chip, will enhance the ability to study human heart development and disease. This paper describes a protocol to generate highly complex human heart organoids (hHOs) by self-organization using human pluripotent stem cells and stepwise developmental pathway activation using small molecule inhibitors. Embryoid bodies (EBs) are generated in a 96-well plate with round-bottom, ultra-low attachment wells, facilitating suspension culture of individualized constructs. The EBs undergo differentiation into hHOs by a three-step Wnt signaling modulation strategy, which involves an initial Wnt pathway activation to induce cardiac mesoderm fate, a second step of Wnt inhibition to create definitive cardiac lineages, and a third Wnt activation step to induce proepicardial organ tissues. These steps, carried out in a 96-well format, are highly efficient, reproducible, and produce large amounts of organoids per run. Analysis by immunofluorescence imaging from day 3 to day 11 of differentiation reveals first and second heart field specifications and highly complex tissues inside hHOs at day 15, including myocardial tissue with regions of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, as well as internal chambers lined with endocardial tissue. The organoids also exhibit an intricate vascular network throughout the structure and an external lining of epicardial tissue. From a functional standpoint, hHOs beat robustly and present normal calcium activity as determined by Fluo-4 live imaging. Overall, this protocol constitutes a solid platform for in vitro studies in human organ-like cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2021-10-05", "authors": ["Yonatan RLewis-Israeli", "Brett DVolmert", "Mitchell AGabalski", "Amanda RHuang", "AitorAguirre"], "doi": "10.3791/63097\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.034"}

{"title": "Sacubitril/Valsartan Alleviates Experimental Autoimmune Myocarditis by Inhibiting Th17 Cell Differentiation Independently of the NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway.", "abstract": "Sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) is a recently approved drug that is commonly used for treatment of heart failure. Several studies indicated that Sac/Val also regulated the secretion of inflammatory factors. However, the effect and mechanism of this drug modulation of inflammatory immune responses are uncertain. In this study, an experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mouse model was established by injection of \u03b1-myosin-heavy chain peptides. The effect of oral Sac/Val on EAM was evaluated by histological staining of heart tissues, measurements of cardiac troponin T and inflammatory markers (IL-6 and hsCRP). The effects of Sac/Val on NLRP3 inflammasome activation and Th1/Th17 cell differentiation were also determined. To further explore the signaling pathways, the expressions of cardiac soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and NF-\u03baB p65 were investigated.

Serum myoglobin (MB) and troponin (cTn) were detected by ELISA. UPLC-Q Exactive/MS analysis was performed to detect the metabolic difference among the groups. ELISA results showed that the MB and cTn values of AKR group were significantly higher than Control group (P<0.05), while those of the other groups were lower than AKR group. TCR-prepared AKR group had similar MB and cTn contents to the Control group. Histopathological examination also indicated better detoxifying effects in the TCR-prepared AKR and AKR-TCR 1:1 group. The serum metabolomics analysis showed obvious distinction between the AKR and Control groups, while AKR-TCR combination reversed the metabolomics changes induced by AKR. Through multivariate statistical analysis, 9 metabolic markers related to energy, nucleic acid and amino acid metabolism were identified.

H9c2 cells were categorized into five groups. Viability was evaluated with MTT and LDH release in H9c2 cells. Apoptotic parameter analysis was performed with cytochrome c (Cyt-c), caspase-3 (CASP-3), and BCL2/Bax mRNA expression levels. In vivo, gossypin was administered orally to mice at doses of 5, 10, and 20\u00a0mg/kg for 7\u00a0days.

The current study aims to investigate the pharmacological effects of hirsutine, one indole alkaloid isolated from Uncaria rhynchophylla, on improving hepatic and cardiac IR, and elucidate the underlying mechanism. T2DM and IR in vivo were established by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding for 3 months in C57BL/6\u00a0J mice. In vitro IR models were induced by high-glucose and high-insulin (HGHI) incubation in HepG2 and H9c2 cells. Hirsutine administration for 8 weeks improved HFD-induced peripheral hyperglycemia, glucose tolerance and IR by OGTT and ITT assays, and simultaneously attenuated hepatic steatosis and cardiac hypertrophy by pathological observation. The impaired p-Akt expression was activated by hirsutine in liver and heart tissues of HFD mice, and also in the models in vitro. Hirsutine exhibited the effects on enhancing glucose consumption and uptake in IR cell models via activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which was blocked by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Moreover, the effect of hirsutine on promoting glucose uptake and GLUT4 expression in HGHI H9c2 cells was also prevented by Compound C, an inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Enhancement of glycolysis might be another factor of hirsutine showing its effects on glycemic control. Collectively, it was uncovered that hirsutine might exert beneficial effects on regulating glucose homeostasis, thus improving hepatic and cardiac IR, and could be a promising compound for treating diet-induced T2DM.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2021-10-02", "authors": ["WeiHu", "MengLi", "WuyiSun", "QixiuLi", "HaiyanXi", "YuanyeQiu", "RanWang", "QianDing", "ZhouWang", "YueYu", "HepingLei", "YichengMao", "Yi ZhunZhu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105917"}

In rats, the implantation of cell-free patches or patches seeded with rat cardiomyocytes onto the myocardium after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery led to functional repair after 4 weeks, as indicated by increases in fractional shortening and the ejection fraction, and by a decrease in the infarcted area. We also observed measures of functional recovery in minipigs with infarcted hearts after the delivery of cell-free patches or patches incorporating cardiomyocytes differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells.", "journal": "Nature biomedical engineering", "date": "2021-10-02", "authors": ["LeyuWang", "YuqingLiu", "GenlanYe", "YutongHe", "BingyunLi", "YezhiGuan", "BaoyongGong", "KibretMequanint", "Malcolm M QXing", "XiaozhongQiu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41551-021-00796-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66621-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302895\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.281.2.H490\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00521-0\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.010\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.09.009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300216\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269894\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000641\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2014.07.006\n10.1038/ncomms13306\n10.1038/s41551-017-0157-y\n10.7150/thno.25504\n10.7150/thno.22599\n10.1073/pnas.1211516109\n10.1038/nmat4956\n10.1038/nnano.2015.115\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03019\n10.1038/s41587-019-0017-2\n10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00331\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.044\n10.1038/s41467-018-04998-9\n10.1152/ajpheart.00935.2014\n10.1002/adma.201503255\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.014\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00845\n10.1021/nn4002193\n10.1021/nl204064s\n10.1021/nn305559j\n10.1021/nn203711s\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01062\n10.1002/adma.201103561\n10.1038/nature11409\n10.1038/nature09024\n10.1002/adhm.201400781\n10.1002/adma.201601066\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.044\n10.1016/j.healun.2017.12.011\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.07.002\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3002097\n10.1002/adfm.201505372\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.067\n10.1002/adfm.201800618\n10.1002/adma.201704235\n10.7150/thno.27760\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1038/s41590-019-0363-8\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.01.001\n10.1002/jcb.24687\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.083\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.06.005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.084343\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.03.064\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.22.2934\n10.3389/fendo.2017.00253"}

In the last decade a broad scientific literature has underlined the distinct mechanism of onset and the peculiar progress of IHD between female and male patients, highlighting the estrogenic hormonal setting as a key factor of these sex-dependent divergences. In particular, estrogen-activated cardioprotective pathways exert a pivotal role for the microvascular health, and their impairment, both physiologically and pathologically driven, predispose to vascular dysfunctions. Aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the estrogen receptors localization and function in the cardiovascular system, particularly focusing on sex-dependent differences in microvascular vs macrovascular dysfunction and on the experimental models that allowed the researchers to reach the current findings and sketching the leading estrogen-mediated cardioprotective mechanisms.", "journal": "Vascular pharmacology", "date": "2021-10-01", "authors": ["GiuliaQuerio", "SusannaAntoniotti", "FedericaGeddo", "FrancescaTullio", "ClaudiaPenna", "PasqualePagliaro", "Maria PiaGallo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vph.2021.106921"}

The mechanisms underlying persisting inflammatory signals are not fully understood, but may involve defective and/or non-responsive transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. In the current study, we aimed to identify novel mediators and pathways involved in processes associated with inflammation in the development and maintenance of cardiac disease.\nWe performed RNA sequencing analysis of cardiac tissue from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or aortic valve replacement (AVR) and compared with control tissue from multi-organ donors. Our results confirmed previous findings of a marked upregulated inflammatory state, but more importantly, we found pronounced reduction of non-protein coding genes, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), including several lncRNAs known to be associated with inflammation and/or cardiovascular disease. In addition, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed markedly downregulated microRNA pathways, resulting in aberrant expression of other genes, particularly \u03b3-protocadherins.\nOur data suggest that aberrant expression of non-coding gene regulators comprise crucial keys in the progression of heart disease, and may be pivotal for chronic low grade inflammation associated with cardiac dysfunction. By unmasking atypical \u03b3-protocadherin expression as a prospective genetic biomarker of myocardial dysfunction, our study provides new insight into the complex molecular framework of heart disease. Creating new approaches to modify non-coding gene regulators, such as those identified in the current study, may define novel strategies to shift \u03b3-protocadherin expression, thereby normalizing part of the molecular architecture associated with heart disease.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2021-10-01", "authors": ["JoakimSandstedt", "KristinaVukusic", "ElhamRekabdar", "G\u00f6ranDellgren", "AndersJeppsson", "LillemorMattsson Hult\u00e9n", "VictoriaRotter Sopasakis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.09.046"}

Urotensin II (UII) is regarded as a cardiovascular autacoid/hormone that is not only the most potent vasoconstrictor in mammals but also involved in cardiac remodeling. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for UII-induced cardiac fibrosis have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of UII on myocardial fibrosis in cardiac hypertrophy and the mechanism of UII-induced cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac tissue from mice subjected to Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was collected. Cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and the expression of UII protein were assessed using echocardiography and pathological and molecular biological analyses. The effect of UII on fibrosis was evaluated in UII-treated mice and isolated rat primary cardiac fibroblasts, and the results indicated that UII induced significant myocardial fibrosis and increases in the proliferation and fibrotic responses both in mice and cultured fibroblasts. Mechanistically, UII treatment induced activation of the TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway, which was suppressed by the UII receptor antagonist. In conclusion, UII plays critical roles in cardiac fibrosis by modulating the TGF-\u03b2/Smads signaling pathway, which may be a promising therapeutic target in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and related problems, such as cardiac remodeling and heart failure.", "journal": "International heart journal", "date": "2021-10-01", "authors": ["YanyanLiang", "YifengXu", "LinDing", "XiaoqingChen", "HongliLi"], "doi": "10.1536/ihj.21-032"}

Unfortunately, it is also subjected to various stresses based on physiological or pathological conditions, particularly more vulnerable to damages caused by oxidative stress. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanism and contribution of IGF-IIR\u03b1 in endoplasmic reticulum stress induction in the heart under doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Using in vitro H9c2 cells, in vivo transgenic rat cardiac tissues, siRNAs against CHOP, chemical ER chaperone PBA, and western blot experiments, we found that IGF-IIR\u03b1 overexpression enhanced ER stress markers ATF4, ATF6, IRE1\u03b1, and PERK which were further aggravated by DOX treatment. This was accompanied by a significant perturbation in stress-associated MAPKs such as p38 and JNK. Interestingly, PARKIN, a stress responsive cellular protective mediator was significantly downregulated by IGF-IIR\u03b1 concomitant with decreased expression of ER chaperone GRP78. Furthermore, ER stress-associated pro-apoptotic factor CHOP was increased considerably in a dose-dependent manner followed by elevated c-caspase-12 and c-caspase-3 activities. Conversely, treatment of H9c2 cells with chemical ER chaperone PBA or siRNA against CHOP abolished the IGF-IIR\u03b1-induced ER stress responses. Altogether, these findings suggested that IGF-IIR\u03b1 contributes to ER stress induction and inhibits cellular stress coping proteins while increasing pro-apoptotic factors feeding into a cardio myocyte damage program that eventually paves the way to heart failure.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2021-09-30", "authors": ["SudhirPandey", "Chia-HuaKuo", "William Shao-TsuChen", "Yu-LanYeh", "Wei-WenKuo", "Ray-JadeChen", "Cecilia HsuanDay", "Pei-YingPai", "Tsung-JungHo", "Chih-YangHuang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-021-04261-8\n10.1111/bph.13888\n10.1038/s41598-019-47607-5\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1091141\n10.3390/biom5021099\n10.3390/biom9090503\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.10.026\n10.1038/ncb0311-184\n10.1016/j.cbi.2016.03.023\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017443\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.006\n10.1016/j.bcp.2012.10.005\n10.1016/j.pcad.2006.10.002\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.108834\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307604\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2291\n10.1161/01.res.76.4.645\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.07.016\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.036\n10.1371/journal.pone.0216285\n10.1002/jcb.28957\n10.1152/ajpcell.00079.2019\n10.1038/s41598-017-02339-2\n10.1186/s12986-019-0356-5\n10.1051/bmdcn/2018080315\n10.1186/s12986-020-0432-x\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.01.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0215992\n10.1007/s10557-016-6709-7\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109475"}

Further, patients with LMNA mutations have highly variable presentation of heart disease progression and type. In vitro patient-specific experiments could provide a powerful platform for studying this phenomenon, but the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) introduces heterogeneity in maturity and function thus complicating the interpretation of the results of any single experiment. We hypothesized that integrating single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with analysis of the tissue architecture and contractile function would elucidate some of the probable mechanisms. To test this, we investigated five iPSC-CM lines, three controls and two patients with a (c.357-2A>G) mutation. The patient iPSC-CM tissues had significantly weaker stress generation potential than control iPSC-CM tissues demonstrating the viability of our in vitro approach. Through scRNA-seq, differentially expressed genes between control and patient lines were identified.

This study aimed to investigate the different expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways in the pathogenesis of ICM using bioinformatics analysis.\nThe control and ICM datasets GSE116250, GSE46224 and GSE5406 were collected from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. DEGs were identified using limma package of R software, and co-expressed genes were identified using Venn diagrams. Then, the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to explore the biological functions and signaling pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were assembled with Cytoscape software to identify hub genes related to the pathogenesis of ICM. RT-PCR of Heart tissues (n=2 for non-failing controls and n=4 for ischemic cardiomyopathy patients) was used to validate the bioinformatic results.\nA total of 844 DEGs were screened from GSE116250, of which 447 were up-regulated genes and 397 were down-regulated genes, respectively. A total of 99 DEGs were singled out from GSE46224, of which 58 were up-regulated genes and 41 were down-regulated genes, respectively. Thirty DEGs were screened from GSE5406, including 10 genes with up-regulated expression and 20 genes with down-regulated expression. Five up-regulated and 3 down-regulated co-expressed DEGs were intersected in three datasets. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that DEGs are mainly enriched in collagen fibril organization, protein digestion and absorption, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and other related pathways.

{"title": "Interleukin-7 aggravates myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury by regulating macrophage infiltration and polarization.", "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-7 is known to enhance the macrophages cytotoxic activity and that macrophages play a pivotal role in the development and progression of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the effects of IL-7 on macrophages infiltration and polarization in myocardial I/R injury are currently unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the IL-7 expression on myocardial I/R injury and their relationship with macrophages. The data showed that IL-7 expression in mouse heart tissue increases following I/R injury and that IL-7 knockout or anti-IL-7 antibody treatment significantly improve I/R injury, including reduction in myocardial infarction area, a serum troponin T level decreases and an improvement in cardiac function. On the other hand, recombinant IL-7 (rIL-7) supplementation induces opposite effects and the anti-IL-7 antibody significantly reduces the cardiomyocyte apoptosis and macrophage infiltration. rIL-7 cannot directly cause apoptosis, but it can induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis through macrophages, in addition to increase the macrophages migration in vitro. Anti-IL-7 antibody affects the cytokine production in T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cells and also promotes the macrophages differentiation to M2 macrophages. However, anti-IL-7 antibody does not reduce the M1 macrophage number, and it only increases the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages in mice heart tissues after I/R injury. Taking together, these data reveal that IL-7 plays an intensifying role in myocardial I/R injury by promoting cardiomyocyte apoptosis through the regulation of macrophage infiltration and polarization.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2021-09-29", "authors": ["MengwenYan", "YaliuYang", "YingZhou", "ChanganYu", "RuiLi", "WeiGong", "JingangZheng"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.16335"}
{"title": "Towards Intraoperative Quantification of Atrial Fibrosis Using Light-Scattering Spectroscopy and Convolutional Neural Networks.", "abstract": "Light-scattering spectroscopy (LSS) is an established optical approach for characterization of biological tissues. Here, we investigated the capabilities of LSS and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to quantitatively characterize the composition and arrangement of cardiac tissues. We assembled tissue constructs from fixed myocardium and the aortic wall with a thickness similar to that of the atrial free wall. The aortic sections represented fibrotic tissue. Depth, volume fraction, and arrangement of these fibrotic insets were varied. We gathered spectra with wavelengths from 500-1100 nm from the constructs at multiple locations relative to a light source. We used single and combinations of two spectra for training of CNNs. With independently measured spectra, we assessed the accuracy of the CNNs for the classification of tissue constructs from single spectra and combined spectra. Combined spectra, including the spectra from fibers distal from the illumination fiber, typically yielded the highest accuracy. The maximal classification accuracy of the depth detection, volume fraction, and permutated arrangements was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation (stddev)) 88.97 \u00b1 2.49%, 76.33 \u00b1 1.51%, and 84.25 \u00b1 1.88%, respectively.

{"title": "Joint Cardioprotective Effect of Vitamin C and Other Antioxidants against Reperfusion Injury in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.", "abstract": "Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has long remained the gold standard therapy to restore coronary blood flow after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, this procedure leads to the development of increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can exacerbate the damage caused by AMI, particularly during the reperfusion phase. Numerous attempts based on antioxidant treatments, aimed to reduce the oxidative injury of cardiac tissue, have failed in achieving an effective therapy for these patients. Among these studies, results derived from the use of vitamin C (Vit C) have been inconclusive so far, likely due to suboptimal study designs, misinterpretations, and the erroneous conclusions of clinical trials. Nevertheless, recent clinical trials have shown that the intravenous infusion of Vit C prior to PCI-reduced cardiac injury biomarkers, as well as inflammatory biomarkers and ROS production. In addition, improvements of functional parameters, such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and telediastolic left ventricular volume, showed a trend but had an inconclusive association with Vit C. Therefore, it seems reasonable that these beneficial effects could be further enhanced by the association with other antioxidant agents. Indeed, the complexity and the multifactorial nature of the mechanism of injury occurring in AMI demands multitarget agents to reach an enhancement of the expected cardioprotection, a paradigm needing to be demonstrated. The present review provides data supporting the view that an intravenous infusion containing combined safe antioxidants could be a suitable strategy to reduce cardiac injury, thus improving the clinical outcome, life quality, and life expectancy of patients subjected to PCI following AMI.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-09-29", "authors": ["Ram\u00f3nRodrigo", "Juan CarlosPrieto", "Rub\u00e9nAguayo", "Crist\u00f3balRamos", "\u00c1ngelPuentes", "AbrahamGajardo", "EmilianoPanieri", "CatalinaRojas-Sol\u00e9", "Jos\u00e9Lillo-Moya", "LucianoSaso"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules26185702\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61237-4\n10.1177/2048872615598632\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.3390/antiox9121182\n10.3390/nu11102412\n10.3390/nu12082199\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.06.010\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.09.086\n10.1074/jbc.M113.545301\n10.1042/CS20110663\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.11.004\n10.1177/039463200501800308\n10.1016/j.mam.2011.10.006\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.190\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2014.06.002\n10.1007/s11010-012-1458-9\n10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.001\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.12.035\n10.1253/circj.CJ-16-1124\n10.1161/01.RES.55.6.816\n10.1152/ajpcell.1990.258.6.C967\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01693-5\n10.1002/mus.20512\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)50676-7\n10.1073/pnas.84.5.1404\n10.2174/138920112798868782\n10.4330/wjc.v10.i9.74\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.08.020\n10.1023/A:1015923202082\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.05.003\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.115.004148\n10.1155/2017/3647657\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316509\n10.3390/antiox10050667\n10.1042/bj3070093\n10.1152/ajpheart.00683.2005\n10.1093/cvr/cvv097\n10.1152/ajpheart.1997.272.5.H2071\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.01.016\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00095\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00455-8\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.09.025\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.12.001\n10.1007/s10557-010-6219-y\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.10.011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00796.2000\n10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00296-8\n10.1016/S0014-5793(96)01426-3\n10.1172/JCI126428\n10.1007/BF03174092\n10.1016/S0005-2736(98)00216-8\n10.1186/s13054-018-1996-y\n10.1210/en.2008-1112\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.22.2222\n10.1016/j.amjhyper.2005.02.006\n10.1007/s11010-006-9182-y\n10.1179/1351000215Y.0000000018\n10.1016/j.jcin.2009.10.025\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00168.x\n10.1016/j.cjca.2013.08.018\n10.1253/jcj.63.924\n10.5114/aoms.2016.59713\n10.1152/ajpheart.00253.2017\n10.1007/978-4-431-38453-3_17\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.08.1038\n10.4103/JRPP.JRPP_18_78\n10.1161/01.RES.83.9.916\n10.1155/2013/437613\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000057421.28533.37\n10.1021/bi0263210\n10.1081/CEH-200067681\n10.3121/cmr.4.1.53\n10.1038/278737a0\n10.1093/ajcn/62.6.1322S\n10.1006/abbi.1997.0473\n10.1021/ja00411a035\n10.1023/A:1012186203165\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011414\n10.2307/3579271\n10.1016/0891-5849(95)02130-2\n10.1016/S0891-5849(98)00060-4\n10.1073/pnas.1821022116\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110990\n10.1007/BF01745863\n10.1016/0002-8703(89)90577-2\n10.1124/jpet.301.2.543\n10.1016/j.curtheres.2008.10.006\n10.1248/cpb.c15-00693\n10.3390/antiox8120614\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.01.017\n10.1007/978-1-4939-8597-5_8\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101292\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2017.03.007\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.08.091\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.10.2855\n10.1007/s40256-017-0258-8\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn011\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehi028\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.111.966226\n10.1016/j.lfs.2008.05.009\n10.1139/Y10-025\n10.1016/S0090-4295(99)00358-1\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2955\n10.3390/medicina49020015\n10.1002/biof.5520070104\n10.1093/bja/aeg042\n10.3904/kjim.2015.30.5.571\n10.7326/0003-4819-142-1-200501040-00110\n10.1517/14728220802517901\n10.1007/s00128-010-9982-3\n10.5551/jat.8870\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.027575\n10.1007/s40279-017-0677-3\n10.3390/molecules23123305\n10.1016/j.trecan.2019.07.008\n10.1007/s00210-020-01932-z\n10.3109/15563659609028006\n10.3390/nu13010273\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.127535\n10.1016/j.fitote.2015.09.018\n10.1016/j.numecd.2018.09.012\n10.1002/ptr.4825\n10.3390/molecules25153469\n10.1073/pnas.041611398\n10.1016/S0891-5849(01)00474-9\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00102-4\n10.1179/135100004225003897\n10.1177/0960327110383625\n10.3390/ijms21062084\n10.1093/cvr/cvx049\n10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008164\n10.1186/1745-6215-15-192\n10.3390/biomedicines9060620"}

Recently, the potential role of gut microbiota (GM) in hypertension has been investigated, but the specific GM signature that may participate in hypertension remains unclear. To test the potassium alginate oligosaccharides (PAO) mechanism in lowering BP and specific microbial signature changes in altering GM, we administered various dosages of PAO in 40 spontaneously hypertensive rats for a duration of six weeks. We analyzed BP, sequenced the 16S ribosomal DNA gene in the cecum content, and gathered RNA-seq data in cardiac tissues. We showed that the oral administration of PAO could significantly decrease systolic BP and mean arterial pressure. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated that the protective effects of developing heart failure were accompanied by down-regulating of the Natriuretic Peptide A gene expression and by decreasing the concentrations of angiotensin II and atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma. In comparison to the Vehicle control, PAO could increase the microbial diversity by altering the composition of GM. PAO could also decrease the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes by decreasing the abundance of ", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-09-29", "authors": ["Zhen-LianHan", "MengChen", "Xiao-DanFu", "MinYang", "MariaHrmova", "Yuan-HuiZhao", "Hai-JinMou"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22189823\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.040168\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17741-1\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000350\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61097-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018912\n10.3109/10641963.2011.577484\n10.3109/10641963.2013.776568\n10.1016/j.biopha.2009.09.004\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.09.059\n10.1038/nature13568\n10.7554/eLife.01202\n10.1038/nature11450\n10.1038/ncomms2266\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05315\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00136.2014\n10.1186/s40168-016-0222-x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024545\n10.1007/s11130-017-0650-1\n10.1161/JAHA.118.010721\n10.1093/jn/134.4.980S\n10.1007/s42995-020-00035-1\n10.1186/s40168-020-00886-x\n10.1007/s00253-020-10449-7\n10.3390/md17030173\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00081.2016\n10.1007/s10741-012-9365-4\n10.1096/fasebj.5.15.1835945\n10.1038/s41371-019-0219-6\n10.1042/CS20030044\n10.1038/ki.2013.45\n10.2119/molmed.2014.00057\n10.1002/mc.22465\n10.1016/j.stem.2018.07.001\n10.1016/j.fitote.2016.06.010\n10.7150/ijbs.17617\n10.1242/dev.101071\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06672\n10.1097/00004872-200018050-00009\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000153272.48711.B9\n10.2147/DDDT.S142118\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.009751\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.12.053\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03575\n10.1152/advan.00177.2016\n10.1016/S0167-0115(00)00237-8\n10.1161/01.RES.0000221824.87718.c0\n10.3892/ijmm.2019.4235\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309006\n10.3390/nu12102982\n10.1007/s13238-018-0549-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036652\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109040\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa704\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp120\n10.1093/nar/gkr483"}

{"title": "Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Derived Extracellular Vesicles as Post-Myocardial Infarction Therapeutic Toolkit: An Experienced View.", "abstract": "Outstanding progress has been achieved in developing therapeutic options for reasonably alleviating symptoms and prolonging the lifespan of patients suffering from myocardial infarction (MI). Current treatments, however, only partially address the functional recovery of post-infarcted myocardium, which is in fact the major goal for effective primary care. In this context, we largely investigated novel cell and TE tissue engineering therapeutic approaches for cardiac repair, particularly using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and natural extracellular matrices, from pre-clinical studies to clinical application. A further step in this field is offered by MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), which are naturally released nanosized lipid bilayer-delimited particles with a key role in cell-to-cell communication.

{"title": "Heart Organoids and Engineered Heart Tissues: Novel Tools for Modeling Human Cardiac Biology and Disease.", "abstract": "Organoids are three-dimensional in vitro cell constructs that recapitulate organ properties and structure to a significant extent. They constitute particularly useful models to study unapproachable states in humans, such as embryonic and fetal development, or early disease progression in adults. In recent years organoids have been implemented to model a wide range of different organs and disease conditions. However, the technology for their fabrication and application to cardiovascular studies has been lagging significantly when compared to other organoid types (e.g., brain, pancreas, kidney, intestine). This is a surprising fact since cardiovascular disease (CVD) and congenital heart disease (CHD) constitute the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world, and the most common birth defect in humans, respectively, and collectively constitute one of the largest unmet medical needs in the modern world. There is a critical need to establish in vitro models of the human heart that faithfully recapitulate its biology and function, thus enabling basic and translational studies to develop new therapeutics. Generating heart organoids that truly resemble the heart has proven difficult due to its complexity, but significant progress has been made recently to overcome this obstacle. In this review, we will discuss progress in novel heart organoid generation methods, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and their translational applications for advancing cardiovascular studies and the treatment of heart disorders.", "journal": "Biomolecules", "date": "2021-09-29", "authors": ["Yonatan RLewis-Israeli", "Aaron HWasserman", "AitorAguirre"], "doi": "10.3390/biom11091277\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1038/nature12517\n10.1038/nature22047\n10.1038/nbt.4127\n10.1097/WNR.0000000000001014\n10.7554/eLife.05098\n10.1128/mBio.00723-19\n10.1038/s41586-020-3014-1\n10.1002/hep.29483\n10.1039/C8LC00869H\n10.1016/j.jhep.2019.06.030\n10.1038/nprot.2016.097\n10.1186/s13287-020-1585-2\n10.1186/s12861-020-0209-5\n10.1038/nature09691\n10.1038/s41586-019-1146-y\n10.1038/s41467-019-13916-6\n10.1038/nm.4355\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.05.020\n10.1084/jem.20180823\n10.1038/nature15695\n10.1038/s41592-019-0325-y\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108514\n10.1152/ajpcell.00120.2020\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1002/cpt.1385\n10.1152/ajpheart.1999.277.2.H433\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(20000405)68:1<106::AID-BIT13>3.0.CO;2-3\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.02.002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.583039\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0223\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.242354\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.050\n10.1159/000477436\n10.1371/journal.pone.0196714\n10.1007/s10544-006-9013-7\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0341\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316155\n10.3390/cancers13040874\n10.1038/s41467-020-18031-5\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.21203/rs.3.rs-132349/v1\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.034\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.03.009\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2007.03.016\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.026\n10.1242/dev.143966\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.3791/55373\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.016\n10.7150/thno.54999\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.024\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.033\n10.1038/nature12271\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.07.021\n10.1101/2020.04.30.071472\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1038/s41467-018-05604-8\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1006/dbio.2001.0409\n10.1101/gad.9.13.1654\n10.3791/53252"}

The effect of alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin derivative and a selective inhibitor of the MPT pore opening, on the ultrastructure and functions of the heart mitochondria of mice with diabetes mellitus induced by a high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin injections was studied. The treatment of diabetic animals with alisporivir (2.5 mg/kg ip for 20 days) increased the rate of glucose clearance during the glucose tolerance test. The blood glucose level and the indicator of heart rate in alisporivir-treated diabetic mice tended to restore. An electron microscopy analysis showed that alisporivir prevented mitochondrial swelling and ultrastructural alterations in cardiomyocytes of diabetic mice. Alisporivir canceled the diabetes-induced increases in the susceptibility of heart mitochondria to the MPT pore opening and the level of lipid peroxidation products, but it did not affect the decline in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity.

{"title": "Immune Mechanism, Gene Module, and Molecular Subtype Identification of Astragalus Membranaceus in the Treatment of Dilated Cardiomyopathy: An Integrated Bioinformatics Study.", "abstract": "Astragalus membranaceus has complex components as a natural drug and has multilevel, multitarget, and multichannel effects on dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the immune mechanism, gene module, and molecular subtype of astragalus membranaceus in the treatment of DCM are still not revealed. Microarray information of GSE84796 was downloaded from the GEO database, including RNA sequencing data of seven normal cardiac tissues and ten DCM cardiac tissues. A total of 4029 DCM differentially expressed genes were obtained, including 1855 upregulated genes and 2174 downregulated genes. GO/KEGG/GSEA analysis suggested that the activation of T cells and B cells was the primary cause of DCM. WGCNA was used to obtain blue module genes. The blue module genes are primarily ADCY7, BANK1, CD1E, CD19, CD38, CD300LF, CLEC4E, FLT3, GPR18, HCAR3, IRF4, LAMP3, MRC1, SYK, and TLR8, which successfully divided DCM into three molecular subtypes. Based on the CIBERSORT algorithm, the immune infiltration profile of DCM was analyzed. Many immune cell subtypes, including the abovementioned immune cells, showed different levels of increased infiltration in the myocardial tissue of DCM. However, this infiltration pattern was not obviously correlated with clinical characteristics, such as age, EF, and sex. Based on network pharmacology and ClueGO, 20 active components of Astragalus membranaceus and 40 components of DMCTGS were obtained from TCMSP. Through analysis of the immune regulatory network, we found that Astragalus membranaceus effectively regulates the activation of immune cells, such as B cells and T cells, cytokine secretion, and other processes and can intervene in DCM at multiple components, targets, and levels. The above mechanisms were verified by molecular docking results, which confirmed that AKT1, VEGFA, MMP9, and RELA are promising potential targets of DCM.", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["Xiao-YangChen", "Hong-FeiHan", "Zhen-YanHe", "Xue-GongXu"], "doi": "10.1155/2021/2252832\n10.1016/j.hlc.2014.02.022\n10.1111/joim.12944\n10.1161/circresaha.116.309396\n10.1002/ejhf.1103\n10.1161/circulationaha.116.027134\n10.1038/s41569-019-0284-0\n10.1007/s11886-018-1030-7\n10.1007/s00392-016-1033-6\n10.3390/genes11010060\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.12.058\n10.1161/cir.0000000000000449\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv727\n10.1038/jhg.2015.83\n10.1111/eci.12483\n10.1016/j.cjca.2015.06.034\n10.1161/circulationaha.119.037661\n10.1038/s41598-020-58984-7\n10.1016/j.autrev.2017.05.021\n10.1161/circulationaha.119.043545\n10.1586/14779072.2015.990385\n10.3390/healthcare9030257\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.03.005\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110012\n10.1093/nar/gks1193\n10.1093/cid/cix506\n10.1093/nar/gky1049\n10.1093/nar/gkw1092\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1186/1471-2105-9-559\n10.1080/10543400903572753\n10.1093/nar/gky1131\n10.2174/138920021801170119204832\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7493-1_12\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1186/gb-2003-4-5-p3\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp101\n10.1016/j.sbi.2018.12.010\n10.2174/1389450119666181022153016\n10.1002/jcc.24259\n10.1002/pro.3730\n10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00145\n10.1002/jcph.1284\n10.1016/j.repc.2016.10.007\n10.1007/s11886-020-1260-3\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.03.590\n10.1161/circulationaha.119.040037\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2018.07.015\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2017.08.005\n10.1186/s12967-019-1966-4\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.06.003\n10.3892/etm.2017.4223\n10.1155/2014/323870\n10.1097/md.0000000000020777\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.08.002\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.05.007\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02714\n10.1038/s41423-019-0254-9\n10.1152/ajpheart.00797.2018\n10.1161/01.res.82.10.1035\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.190\n10.1016/j.cjca.2019.05.031\n10.1007/s00431-019-03404-w\n10.1007/s10741-020-09940-0\n10.1074/jbc.m116.765107\n10.1620/tjem.168.529\n10.1016/j.clim.2016.11.010\n10.1016/s1875-5364(13)60037-0\n10.1007/s11655-016-2499-9\n10.1007/s11655-019-3064-0\n10.1038/nchembio.118\n10.1002/minf.201700048\n10.3390/molecules22071135\n10.1002/phy2.143\n10.1016/j.ejheart.2007.07.008\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.143\n10.1161/hypertensionaha.115.06412\n10.1152/ajpheart.00243.2016\n10.3109/10409238.2013.770819\n10.1172/jci23977\n10.1080/08923973.2019.1616753\n10.1155/2016/5417565\n10.1111/jnc.14913\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00613\n10.1016/bs.ircmb.2017.07.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0197563\n10.1016/j.imbio.2011.05.002\n10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.08.012\n10.1016/j.intimp.2017.12.014\n10.1007/s10753-016-0361-z\n10.3109/10715762.2011.647010\n10.18433/j3vs3s\n10.1007/978-1-59745-177-2_19\n10.3390/molecules24162959"}

{"title": "Numerical Investigation of the Fetal Left Heart Hemodynamics During Gestational Stages.", "abstract": "Flow-driven hemodynamic forces on the cardiac tissues have critical importance, and have a significant role in the proper development of the heart. These mechanobiological mechanisms govern the cellular responses for the growth and remodeling of the heart, where the altered hemodynamic environment is believed to be a major factor that is leading to congenital heart defects (CHDs). In order to investigate the mechanobiological development of the normal and diseased hearts, identification of the blood flow patterns and wall shear stresses (WSS) on these tissues are required for an accurate hemodynamic assessment. In this study, we focus on the left heart hemodynamics of the human fetuses throughout the gestational stages. Computational fetal left heart models are created for the healthy fetuses using the ultrasound images at various gestational weeks. Realistic inflow boundary conditions are implemented in the models using the Doppler ultrasound measurements for resolving the specific blood flow waveforms in the mitral valve. Obtained results indicate that WSS and vorticity levels in the fetal left heart decrease with the development of the fetus. The maximum WSS around the mitral valve is determined around 36 Pa at the gestational week of 16. This maximum WSS decreases to 11 Pa at the gestational week of 27, indicating nearly three-times reduction in the peak shear stress. These findings reveal the highly dynamic nature of the left heart hemodynamics throughout the development of the human fetus and shed light into the relevance of hemodynamic environment and development of CHDs.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["Huseyin EnesSalman", "Reema YousefKamal", "Huseyin CagatayYalcin"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.731428\n10.1016/j.imu.2017.09.001\n10.1007/s10439-012-0574-8\n10.1016/S0022-5223(03)00698-6\n10.1111/echo.13644\n10.1038/jp.2013.112\n10.1161/01.RES.0000266606.88463.cb\n10.1146/annurev.fluid.39.050905.110308\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001677\n10.1161/01.RES.0000171901.40952.0d\n10.5830/CVJA-2013-028\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01886-7\n10.1002/cnm.2821\n10.1002/dvdy.24107\n10.1007/s10237-015-0750-5\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00318\n10.1007/s10237-014-0633-1\n10.29252/jafm.11.02.28185\n10.1161/circulationaha.109.857987\n10.1007/s10439-005-1731-0\n10.1109/TMI.2008.924642\n10.7717/peerj.82\n10.1161/01.RES.0000079488.91342.B7\n10.1186/1532-429X-16-S1-W39\n10.1016/j.micron.2019.102801\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00111\n10.1007/s10237-016-0810-5\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2006.08.041\n10.1080/10255840701827412\n10.1002/(sici)1097-0185(19990201)254:2<238::aid-ar10>3.0.co;2-v\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2005.07.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.00235.2018\n10.1152/ajpheart.00400.2016\n10.1002/dvdy.24497\n10.1002/dvdy.22512\n10.1038/nature12141\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2020.110035"}

Midazolam is a benzodiazepine commonly utilized in anesthesia and intensive care. Research has indicated that midazolam plays a critical role in many diseases; however, the function of midazolam in myocardial injury induced by I/R still needs further investigation. The infarct size and damage to the heart tissues were examined through 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were tested using commercial kits. Cell apoptosis was determined through TUNEL staining or flow cytometry assays. Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, phospho-38 (p-p38), p38, p-JNK, JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and p-ERK expression was examined through Western blot. In our study, midazolam was shown to suppress the infarct size and heart tissue damage and reduce myocardial enzyme leakage in I/R rats. Additionally, midazolam was found to retard cardiomyocyte apoptosis in I/R rats. The JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway in I/R rats was inhibited by midazolam. Our findings demonstrated that in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) - mediated H9C2 cells, anisomycin abolished the suppressive effects of midazolam on the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Next, exploration discovered that anisomycin abolished the cytoprotective effects of midazolam on H/R-treated H9C2 cell apoptosis.

Recently, IntellaNav StablePoint, a novel LI-enabled catheter that equips contact force (CF) sensing, has been introduced. Although StablePoint and its predecessor IntellaNav MiFi OI share the common technology that reports LI, distinct mechanics for LI sensing between the two products raise a concern that the LI-RF lesion formation relationship may differ.\nIn an ex vivo swine cardiac tissue model, we investigated the initial level and range of a reduction in LI during a 60-s\u00a0RF ablation and the resultant lesion characteristics at nine combinations of three energy power (30, 40, and 50\u2009W) and CF (10, 30, and 50\u2009g) steps. Correlations and interactions between CF, LI, wattage, and formed lesions were analyzed. Incidence of achieving LI drop plateau and that of a steam pop were also determined.\nPositive correlations existed between CF and initial LI, CF and absolute/relative LI drop, CF and lesion volume, and LI drop and lesion volume. At the same LI drop, wattage-dependent gain in lesion volume was observed. Steam pops occurred in all CF steps and the prevalence was highest at 50\u2009W. LI drop predicted a steam pop with a cutoff value at 89\u03a9.\nIn StablePoint, wattage crucially affects LI drop and lesion volume.

The KCs were organized into those primarily affecting cardiac tissue (numbers 1-4 below), the vascular system (5-7), or both (8-12), as follows: 1) impairs regulation of cardiac excitability, 2) impairs cardiac contractility and relaxation, 3) induces cardiomyocyte injury and death, 4) induces proliferation of valve stroma, 5) impacts endothelial and vascular function, 6) alters hemostasis, 7) causes dyslipidemia, 8) impairs mitochondrial function, 9) modifies autonomic nervous system activity, 10) induces oxidative stress, 11) causes inflammation, and 12) alters hormone signaling.\nThese 12 KCs can be used to help identify pharmaceuticals and environmental pollutants as CV toxicants, as well as to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of their toxicity.

{"title": "Changes in magnetic resonance imaging relaxation time on postmortem magnetic resonance imaging of formalin-fixed human normal heart tissue.", "abstract": "Postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to investigate the cause of death, but due to time constraints, it is not widely applied to the heart. Therefore, MRI analysis of the heart after formalin fixation was previously performed. However, the changes in MRI signal values based on the fixation time of formalin were not investigated. The objective was to investigate changes over time in the T1- and T2-values of MRI signals in normal areas of hearts removed during autopsy, hearts subsequently fixed in formalin, and heart specimens sliced for the preparation of pathological specimens.\nThe study subjects were 21 autopsy cases in our hospital between May 26, 2019 and February 16, 2020 whose hearts were removed and scanned by MRI. The male:female ratio was 14:7, and their ages at death ranged from 9 to 92\u00a0years (mean age 65.0\u2009\u00b1\u200919.7\u00a0years). Postmortem (PM)-MRI was conducted with a 0.3-Tesla (0.3-T) scanner containing a permanent magnet. A 4-channel QD head coil was used as the receiver coil. Scans were performed immediately after removal, post-formalin fixation, and after slicing; 7 cases were scanned at all three time points.\nThe T1- and T2-values were calculated from the MRI signals of each sample organ at each scanning stage. Specimens were sliced from removed organs after formalin fixation, and the changes in T1- and T2-values over time were graphed to obtain an approximate curve. The median T1-values at each measurement time point tended to decrease from immediately after removal. The T2-values showed the same tendency to decrease, but this tendency was more pronounced for the T1-values.\nMRI signal changes in images of heart specimens were investigated. Formalin fixation shortened both T1- and T2-values over time, and approximation formulae were derived to show these decreases over time. The shortening of T1- and T2-values can be understood as commensurate with the reduction in the water content (water molecules) of the formalin-fixed heart.", "journal": "BMC medical imaging", "date": "2021-09-25", "authors": ["KiyokadzuEbata", "SakonNoriki", "KunihiroInai", "HirohikoKimura"], "doi": "10.1186/s12880-021-00666-5\n10.1148/120.1.135\n10.1520/JFS15569J\n10.2214/ajr.115.3.619\n10.1016/S1344-6223(99)80007-8\n10.1046/j.1440-1827.2003.01573.x\n10.1111/pin.12857\n10.1186/s12880-016-0174-4\n10.1007/s00428-016-1937-6\n10.1111/pin.12174\n10.1016/j.forsciint.2012.04.035\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl255\n10.1007/s00330-010-1884-6\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.01.089\n10.2214/AJR.12.8767\n10.1148/rg.265065001\n10.1007/s00247-014-3156-0\n10.1007/s12024-013-9459-x\n10.1002/mrm.26699\n10.1002/jmri.1880040504\n10.1016/0022-510X(87)90184-5\n10.1177/028418519203300503\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.11.024\n10.1002/mrm.20578\n10.1002/nbm.3477\n10.1016/j.legalmed.2014.03.003\n10.1002/mrm.27821\n10.1021/acs\n10.1016/s0025-6196(12)65250-1\n10.2214/AJR.07.3990\n10.1161/01.cir.89.5.2133\n10.1002/mrm.1097\n10.1038/bmt.2012.244\n10.4103/0973-029X.102496\n10.1002/mrm.21122\n10.1148/radiology.151.1.6701302\n10.2463/mrms.9.101"}
{"title": "Apigenin increases radiosensitivity of glioma stem cells by attenuating HIF-1\u03b1-mediated glycolysis.", "abstract": "Apigenin, a natural flavonoid compound present in a variety of edible plants and health foods, has an anti-tumor effect and inhibits hypoxia inducible factor-l\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) expression in hypertrophic cardiac tissues. However, whether or not apigenin has a radiosensitization effect on glioma stem cells (GSCs) is unknown. Our present study aimed to investigate the effect of apigenin and its possible mechanisms. The human GSCs SU3 and its radioresistance line SU3-5R were treated with apigenin, radiation, or their combination, and the cell proliferation, migration, colony formation, and intracellular lactic acid and glycolytic related protein expressions were determined. Additionally, a cell model with hypoxia-induced HIF-1\u03b1 expression was used and treated with apigenin. The current results displayed that the combination of apigenin and radiation could synergically reduce the viability, colony formation, and migration of the both GSCs. Moreover, this combination could also decrease the radiation-induced increments of glycolytic production lactic acid in the both GSCs and related protein expressions, including HIF-1\u03b1, glucose transporter (GLUT)-1/3, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65, and pyruvate kinase isozyme type\u00a0M2 (PKM2). Further study confirmed that after treatment of hypoxia-cultured SU3 or SU3-5R cells with apigenin, the expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, GLUT-1/3, NF-\u03baB p65, and PKM2 proteins were reduced. These results demonstrated that apigenin could increase the radiosensitivity of GSCs and its radiosensitization mechanisms were attributable to the attenuation of glycolysis, which might result from the inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 expression and subsequent reductions of GLUT-1/3, NF-\u03baB, and PKM2 expressions.", "journal": "Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)", "date": "2021-09-24", "authors": ["YingZhao", "HuiHuang", "Chang-HaoJia", "KeFan", "TaoXie", "Zeng-YanZhu", "Mei-LinXie"], "doi": "10.1007/s12032-021-01586-8\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2016.204\n10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02879\n10.3390/cancers11060862\n10.1016/j.cmet.2019.06.005\n10.1111/jcmm.13572\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.03.029\n10.1038/s41388-018-0182-7\n10.1016/j.tem.2017.02.009\n10.1038/ncomms1786\n10.1038/s41598-017-06605-1\n10.3390/cancers12061668\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.002\n10.1186/s12885-015-1368-9\n10.1016/j.canlet.2017.10.041\n10.1039/C5FO01464F\n10.3892/mmr.2014.3032\n10.1371/journal.pone.0142594\n10.1016/j.jep.2020.113195\n10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153468\n10.1002/cam4.2592\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00203\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0247\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1457\n10.3390/ijms20020238\n10.1371/journal.pone.0080544\n10.3389/fonc.2021.662840"}
{"title": "Lighting up ATP in cells and tissues using a simple aptamer-based fluorescent probe.", "abstract": "Extracellular ATP as a purinergic signaling molecule, together with ATP receptor, are playing an important role in tumor growth,\u00a0therapy resistance, and host immunity suppression.\u00a0Meanwhile ATP is a crucial indicator for cellular energy status and viability, thus a vital variable for tissue regeneration and in vitro tissue engineering. Most recent studies on COVID-19 virus suggest infection caused ATP deficit and release as a major characterization at the early stage of the disease and major causes for disease complications. Thus, imaging ATP molecule in both cellular and extracellular contexts has many applications in biology, engineering, and clinics. A sensitive and selective fluorescence \"signal-on\" probe for ATP detection was constructed, based on the base recognition between a black hole quencher (BHQ)-labeled aptamer oligonucleotide and a fluorophore (Cy5)-labeled reporter flare. The probe was able to detect ATP in solution with single digit \u00b5M detection limit. With the assistance of lipofectamine, this probe efficiently entered and shined in the model cells U2OS within 3\u00a0h.

Bee venom is a natural product that has a potent hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The current study aimed to determine the bee venom effects on cardiac dysfunction compared to combined therapy of metformin and atorvastatin in diabetic hyperlipidemic rats. The median lethal dose of bee venom was estimated, and then 50 adult male albino rats were categorized into five groups. One group was fed a standard diet and served as a negative control, while the other groups were given nicotinamide and streptozotocin injections to induce type 2 diabetes. After confirming diabetes, the rats were fed a high-fat diet for four weeks. The four groups were divided as follows: one group served as a positive control, whereas the other three groups were treated with bee venom (0.5\u2009mg/kg), bee venom (1.23\u2009mg/kg), and combined therapy of metformin (60\u2009mg/kg) and atorvastatin (10\u2009mg/kg), respectively, for four weeks.

After MI, the capability of providing sufficient blood and oxygen significantly decreases in the heart. This event leads to depletion of oxygen from cardiac tissue and consequently leads to massive cardiac cell death due to hypoxemia. Over the past few decades, many studies have been carried out to discover acceptable approaches to treat MI. However, very few have addressed the crucial role of efficient oxygen delivery to the injured heart. Thus, various strategies were developed to increase the delivery of oxygen to cardiac tissue and improve its function. Here, we have given an overall discussion of the oxygen delivery mechanisms and how the current technologies are employed to treat patients suffering from MI, including a comprehensive view on three major technical approaches such as oxygen therapy, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), and oxygen-releasing biomaterials (ORBs). Although oxygen therapy and HBOCs have shown promising results in several animal and clinical studies, they still have a few drawbacks which limit their effectiveness. More recent studies have investigated the efficacy of ORBs which may play a key role in the future of oxygenation of cardiac tissue.

To enhance our understanding of cardiomyocyte mechanosensation, we studied stiffness-driven changes to cell morphology and mechanomarker expression in H9C2 cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Linear stiffness gradient polyacrylamide hydrogels (2-33 kPa) coated with ECM proteins including Collagen I (Col), Fibronectin (Fn) or Laminin (Ln) were used to represent necrotic, healthy, and infarcted cardiac tissue on a continuous stiffness gradient. Cell size, cell shape and nuclear size were found to be mechanosensitive in H9C2 cells, as was the expression or nuclear translocalization of the mechanomarkers Lamin-A, YAP, and MRTF-A. Minor differences were observed between the different ECM coatings, with the same overarching stiffness-dependent trends being observed across Col, Fn and Ln coated hydrogels. Inhibition of mechanotransduction in H9C2 cells using blebbistatin or Y27632 resulted in disruptions to cell shape, nuclear shape, and nuclear size, however, trends in cell size and mechanomarker expression were not significantly attenuated. Mechanosensation in NRCMs was much less marked, with no significant changes in cell morphology being detected, although YAP did become increasingly nuclear localized with increasing stiffness. In \u03b1-actinin positive cells, striations formed with regular structure and frequency at all stiffnesses for Col and Fn coated hydrogels, but not Ln coated gels.

{"title": "Communication Between Cardiomyocytes and Fibroblasts During Cardiac Ischemia/Reperfusion and Remodeling: Roles of TGF-\u03b2, CTGF, the Renin Angiotensin Axis, and Non-coding RNA Molecules.", "abstract": "Communication between cells is a foundational concept for understanding the physiology and pathology of biological systems. Paracrine/autocrine signaling, direct cell-to-cell interplay, and extracellular matrix interactions are three types of cell communication that regulate responses to different stimuli. In the heart, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells interact to form the cardiac tissue. Under pathological conditions, such as myocardial infarction, humoral factors released by these cells may induce tissue damage or protection, depending on the type and concentration of molecules secreted. Cardiac remodeling is also mediated by the factors secreted by cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts that are involved in the extensive reciprocal interactions between these cells. Identifying the molecules and cellular signal pathways implicated in these processes will be crucial for creating effective tissue-preserving treatments during or after reperfusion. Numerous therapies to protect cardiac tissue from reperfusion-induced injury have been explored, and ample pre-clinical research has attempted to identify drugs or techniques to mitigate cardiac damage.

{"title": "Inhibition of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Attenuates Recurrent Seizures Associated Cardiac Damage in a Zebrafish Kindling Model of Chronic Epilepsy.", "abstract": "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is primarily linked with the cardiac irregularities that occur due to recurrent seizures. Our previous studies found a role of mTOR pathway activation in seizures-linked cardiac damage in a rat model. In continuation to the earlier work, the present study was devised to explore the role of rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor and clinically used immunosuppressive agent) in a zebrafish kindling model and associated cardiac damage. Adult zebrafish were incubated with increasing concentrations of rapamycin (1, 2 and, 4 \u03bcM), followed by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) exposure to record seizure latency and severity. In another experiment, zebrafish were subjected to a standardized PTZ kindling protocol. The kindled fish were treated daily with rapamycin for up to 25 days, along with PTZ to record seizure severity. At the end, zebrafish heart was excised for carbonylation assay, gene expression, and protein quantification studies. In the acute PTZ convulsion test, treatment with rapamycin showed a significant increase in seizure latency and decreased seizure severity without any change in seizure incidence. Treatment with rapamycin also reduced the severity of seizures in kindled fish. The cardiac expressions of gpx, nppb, kcnh2, scn5a, mapk8, stat3, rps6 and ddit were decreased, whereas the levels of trxr2 and beclin 1 were increased following rapamycin treatment in kindled fish. Furthermore, rapamycin treatment also decreased p-mTOR expression and protein carbonyls level in the fish cardiac tissue. The present study concluded that rapamycin reduces seizures and associated cardiac damage by inhibiting mTOR activation in the zebrafish kindling model.", "journal": "Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology", "date": "2021-09-20", "authors": ["SupriyaSharma", "Anil KumarRana", "AditiSharma", "DamanpreetSingh"], "doi": "10.1007/s11481-021-10021-8\n10.1002/epi4.12074\n10.2203/dose-response.09-049.Reynolds\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.11.031\n10.1177/1747493018816503\n10.1371/journal.pone.0081325\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.047019\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.08.031\n10.1371/journal.pone.0132376\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.06.058\n10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00335\n10.3390/ijms20081979\n10.1016/s1471-4914(03)00031-5\n10.1111/j.1535-7597.2004.42001.x\n10.1016/j.carpath.2013.03.001\n10.1042/BJ20110033\n10.1503/cmaj.060236\n10.3892/ijmm.2019.4407\n10.1172/JCI24408\n10.1152/ajpheart.00820.2009\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00150\n10.1371/journal.pone.0045156\n10.3892/or.2014.3421\n10.1186/s12861-014-0042-9\n10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.007\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05610\n10.1152/ajpregu.00190.2019\n10.26355/eurrev_201712_13949\n10.1038/srep15881\n10.1038/cdd.2010.191\n10.1038/cddis.2014.390\n10.1038/nrd2755\n10.1016/j.plefa.2019.02.002\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2020.108916\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01372\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0061-11.2011\n10.1101/gad.1250704\n10.1038/nrneurol.2014.64\n10.1038/s41598-019-44264-6\n10.1016/j.bbi.2018.09.020\n10.2174/1871527315666160615022203\n10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.034\n10.1042/CS20070430\n10.1371/journal.pone.0054515\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61381-6\n10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2010.01.011\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000137836.95625.D4\n10.1111/j.1399-0012.2007.00699.x\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00083.2018\n10.3390/ijms18112365\n10.1007/s11910-012-0276-5\n10.3390/ijms19123725\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.02.004\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182575f6\n10.1139/bcb-2016-0048\n10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02479.x\n10.1080/1028415X.2018.1478653\n10.1016/j.cqn.2014.11.002\n10.2174/1871527318666190801112027\n10.1111/epi.16794\n10.1016/j.pbb.2015.05.022\n10.1101/cshperspect.a022426\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2011.11.020\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.03.065\n10.1038/s41598-019-44264-6\n10.1212/01.wnl.0000042090.13247.48\n10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.106946\n10.1073/pnas.1301455110\n10.1159/000484629\n10.3389/fcvm.2015.00036"}

{"title": "Which bidomain conductivity is the most important for modelling heart and torso surface potentials during ischaemia?", "abstract": "Mathematical simulations using the bidomain model, which represents cardiac tissue as consisting of an intracellular and an extracellular space, are a key approach that can be used to improve understanding of heart conditions such as ischaemia. However, key inputs to these models, such as the bidomain conductivity values, are not known with any certainty. Since efforts are underway to measure these values, it would be useful to be able to quantify the effect on model outputs of uncertainty in these inputs, and also to determine, if possible, which are the most important values to focus on in experimental studies. Our previous work has systematically studied the sensitivity of heart surface potentials to the bidomain conductivity values, and this was performed using a half-ellipsoidal model of the left ventricle. This study uses a bi-ventricular heart in a torso model and this time looks at the sensitivity of the torso surface potentials, as well as the heart surface potentials, to various conductivity values (blood, torso and the six bidomain conductivities). We found that both epicardial and torso potentials are the most sensitive to the intracellular longitudinal (along the cardiac fibres) conductivity (g", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2021-09-18", "authors": ["Barbara MJohnston", "Peter RJohnston"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104830"}

{"title": "Spirulina platensis protects against microcystin-LR-induced toxicity in rats.", "abstract": "Microcystis aeruginosa produces an abundant cyanotoxin (microcystins (MCs) in freshwater supplies. MCs have adverse health hazards to animals and humans. Microcystin-leucine-arginine (microcystin-LR or MC-LR) is the most studied among these MCs due to their high toxicity. So, this study was designed to evaluate the possible therapeutic role of the natural algal food supplement, Spirulina platensis (SP), against MC-LR-induced toxic effects in male Wistar rats.

{"title": "Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ameliorates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity through reducing RIP1-mediated necroptosis.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin is an effective chemotherapeutic drug, but causes cardiotoxicity which limits its use. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation are closely implicated in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). Necroptosis, a new form of programmed cell death, was also upregulated by doxorubicin, leading to cardiomyocyte death and cardiac dysfunction. Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, exerted cardioprotection against various heart diseases. However, its cardioprotective effects in DIC are still unknown. We hypothesized that donepezil reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial dynamics imbalance, necroptosis, and apoptosis in DIC rats. Male Wistar rats were assigned to receive either normal saline solution (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or doxorubicin (3\u00a0mg/kg, 6 doses, n\u00a0=\u00a016) via intraperitoneal injection. The doxorubicin-treated rats were further subdivided to receive either sterile drinking water (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or donepezil (5\u00a0mg/kg/day, p.o., n\u00a0=\u00a08) for 30 days. At the end of the experiment, the left ventricular (LV) function was determined. Serum and heart tissue were collected to evaluate histological and biochemical parameters. Doxorubicin-treated rats exhibited higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS production. Doxorubicin also impaired mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dynamics balance, mitophagy, and autophagy, which culminated in apoptosis. Furthermore, doxorubicin increased necroptosis as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1, receptor-interacting protein kinase 3, and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like. All of these mechanisms led to LV dysfunction. Interestingly, donepezil alleviated mitochondrial injury, mitophagy, autophagy, and cardiomyocyte death, leading to improved LV function in DIC. In conclusion, donepezil attenuated DIC-induced LV dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial damage, mitophagy, autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2021-09-17", "authors": ["ThawatchaiKhuanjing", "BenjaminOngnok", "ChayodomManeechote", "NatthaphatSiri-Angkul", "NanthipPrathumsap", "ApiwanArinno", "TitikornChunchai", "BusarinArunsak", "Siriporn CChattipakorn", "NiponChattipakorn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105882"}

At the completion of the treatment phase (30 days for garlic, 250\u2009mg/kg, oral; 10\u2009days for MET, 70\u2009mg/kg, oral), rats were anesthetized and mounted on the modified Langendorff's apparatus. IRI was produced by myocardial no-flow global ischemia. Developed tension (DT) and heart rate (HR) were recorded both before and after ischemia. The perfusate was collected to estimate the leakage of cardiac biomarkers (Creatine Kinase-MB:\u2009CK-MB and Lactate dehydrogenase: LDH). Hearts were removed from the setup and utilized to prepare heart tissue homogenate (HTH) and histological slides. The endogenous antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), in addition to oxidative thiobarbituric acid substances (TBS), were estimated in HTH.\nThe hemodynamic parameters, including percentage recovery in HR and DT, were found significantly higher in animals pretreated with garlic and MET in diabetic rats (DR). Both SOD and CAT enzyme activities increased significantly while TBS levels were reduced in the HTH of animals treated with garlic and MET. The cardiac markers CK-MB and LDH levels also increased in HTH with a corresponding decrease in the perfusate. The histopathological changes in the heart and pancreas demonstrated noticeable protection of the tissues due to pretreatment with garlic and MET. Taken together, these findings advocate that reactive oxygen species derived from hyperglycemia execute an important function in myocardial global IRI; the therapy of garlic homogenate was found to be effective in alleviating these toxic effects.\nThe combined therapy of MET and garlic provided synergistic cardioprotection, implying that garlic seems to possess promise in lowering toxic parameters by protecting diabetic induced myocardial injury.", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "date": "2021-09-17", "authors": ["Syed Mohammed BasheeruddinAsdaq", "SLokaraja", "Abdulhakeem SAlamri", "Walaa FAlsanie", "MajidAlhomrani", "Abdulrahman HadiAlmutiri", "SreeharshaNagaraja", "MohdImran"], "doi": "10.1155/2021/9739089\n10.1023/a:1024701113383\n10.1002/bab.1853\n10.1007/s11684-019-0729-1\n10.1056/nejmoa1800256\n10.1161/01.atv.0000153515.72375.3b\n10.1155/2020/5732956\n10.1111/j.1368-5031.2006.00825.x\n10.2337/db08-0057\n10.1159/000115120\n10.1093/jn/136.3.736s\n10.1007/s10238-020-00611-w\n10.1016/s1568-1637(02)00049-1\n10.1186/1471-2210-2-16\n10.2337/diabetes.55.03.06.db05-0934\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00259.x\n10.1007/bf00404340\n10.1016/s0006-2952(02)00864-x\n10.2337/diabetes.48.2.353\n10.1631/jzus.B1700254\n10.1016/j.cbi.2009.07.022\n10.3892/etm.2017.4475\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.08.029\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110538\n10.1016/0002-9343(91)90278-6\n10.1097/00005344-199312050-00009\n10.1016/0891-5849(88)90005-6\n10.1016/s0008-6363(00)00097-3\n10.1016/s0024-3205(01)01514-4\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.09.019"}

SGLT2 inhibitors are considered to activate multiple cardioprotective pathways; however, underlying mechanisms are not fully described. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the failing heart. We generated a left ventricular (LV) pressure overload model in C57BL/6NCrSlc mice by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and examined the effects of empagliflozin (EMPA) in this model. We conducted metabolome and transcriptome analyses and histological and physiological examinations. EMPA administration ameliorated pressure overload-induced systolic dysfunction. Metabolomic studies showed that EMPA increased citrulline levels in cardiac tissue and reduced levels of arginine, indicating enhanced metabolism from arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (NO). Transcriptome suggested possible involvement of the insulin/AKT pathway that could activate NO production through phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Histological examination of the mice showed capillary rarefaction and endothelial apoptosis after TAC, both of which were significantly improved by EMPA treatment. This improvement was associated with enhanced expression phospho-eNOS and NO production in cardiac endothelial cells. NOS inhibition attenuated these cardioprotective effects of EMPA. The in vitro studies showed that catecholamine-induced endothelial apoptosis was inhibited by NO, arginine, or AKT activator. EMPA activates the AKT/eNOS/NO pathway, which helps to suppress endothelial apoptosis, maintain capillarization and improve systolic dysfunction during LV pressure overload.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-09-17", "authors": ["MasaakiNakao", "IppeiShimizu", "GoroKatsuumi", "YohkoYoshida", "MasayoshiSuda", "YukaHayashi", "RyutaroIkegami", "Yung TingHsiao", "ShujiroOkuda", "TomoyoshiSoga", "TohruMinamino"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-97787-2\n10.1056/NEJMoa1504720\n10.1056/NEJMoa1611925\n10.1056/NEJMoa1812389\n10.1056/NEJMoa1911303\n10.1056/NEJMoa2022190\n10.1002/ehf2.12505\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.09.022\n10.1038/nature05602\n10.1172/JCI40096\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029166\n10.1038/s41467-020-15983-6\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2018.07.006\n10.1093/nar/28.1.27\n10.1186/s12933-015-0299-8\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.12.006\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.224\n10.1186/s12967-019-1881-8\n10.12659/Msmbr.907775\n10.1038/nm.3703\n10.1002/clc.4960181603\n10.1007/s10495-006-0192-8\n10.1161/01.Cir.0000012529.00367.0f\n10.1007/s10557-017-6734-1\n10.1038/s41419-019-2035-x\n10.1161/Circulationaha.118.036459\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.02.004\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.07.003\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.01.056\n10.1161/JAHA.120.018298\n10.3389/fcvm.2016.00043\n10.33594/000000178\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.07.042\n10.1038/s41598-019-56847-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.741702\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa064\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.02.010\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00472\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4806\n10.1371/journal.pone.0202051\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.08.024\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.04.046"}

Trimetazidine (TMZ) inhibits fatty acid metabolism and is used for the treatment of heart diseases such as heart failure. 3-Bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) can suppress glucose metabolism, and it is considered a promising candidate agent for tumor therapy. Because TMZ and 3-BrPA can separately inhibit the 2 main cardiac energy sources, it is necessary to investigate the effects of 3-BrPA combined with TMZ on the heart. Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: a control group, a TMZ group, a 3-BrPA group, and a 3-BrPA + TMZ group. Weight was recorded every day, and echocardiography was performed 14 days later. Heart function, the levels of adenosine triphosphate, oxidative stress-related factors (ROS, glutathione, oxidized glutathione, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity), and apoptosis in heart tissues were assessed to evaluate the effects of 3-BrPA and TMZ on the heart.

{"title": "Cardiotoxic Effects of the Antineoplastic Doxorubicin in a Model of Metabolic Syndrome: Oxidative Stress and Transporter Expression in the Heart.", "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to examine whether metabolic syndrome-like conditions in rats with fructose (F) overload modify the cardiotoxic effects induced by doxorubicin (DOX) and whether the treatment altered the expression of P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein, and organic cation/carnitine transporters in the heart. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received either tap water (control group [C]; n = 16) or water with F 10% wt/vol (n = 16) during 8 weeks. Three days before being killed, the animals received a single dose of DOX (6 mg/kg, ip, md) (C-DOX and F-DOX groups) or vehicle (VEH; ISS 1 mL/kg BW; ip) (C-VEH and F-VEH groups) (n = 8 per group). F overload enhanced thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels in the left ventricle, and DOX injection further increased those values. DOX did not alter thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance production in C animals. DOX caused a decrease of 30% in the ejection fraction and a nearly 40% reduction in the fractional shortening in F animals, but not in C rats. Cardiac tissue levels of P-gp decreased by about 30% in F rats compared with the C groups. DOX did not modify cardiac P-gp expression. Breast cancer resistance protein and organic cation/carnitine transporter (OCTN 1/2/3) protein levels did not change with either F or DOX. It is suggested that DOX could cause greater cardiotoxicity in rats receiving F, probably due to enhanced cardiac lipid peroxidation and lower expression of cardiac P-gp.

Pressure-loading tests demonstrated stiffer ventricles of P. nigromaculatus and B. j. formosus compared X. laevis ventricles. Histological analysis revealed a remarkable difference in the structure of cardiac tissue: thickening of the compact myocardium layer of P. nigromaculatus and B. j. formosus and enrichment of the collagen fibers of B. j. formosus. The amount of collagen fibers differed among the species, as quantitatively confirmed by second-harmonic generation light microscopy.

{"title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to characterize cells and gene expression landscapes in atrial septal defect.", "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize the cells and gene expression landscape in atrial septal defect (ASD). We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of cells derived from cardiac tissue of an ASD patient. Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed to identify different cell populations, followed by the investigation of the cellular crosstalk by analysing ligand-receptor interactions across cell types. Finally, differences between ASD and normal samples for all cell types were further investigated. An expression matrix of 18,411 genes in 6487 cells was obtained and used in this analysis. Five cell types, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and macrophages were identified. ASD showed a decreased proportion of cardiomyocytes and an increased proportion of fibroblasts. There was more cellular crosstalk among cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and macrophages, especially between fibroblast and macrophage. For all cell types, the majority of the DEGs were downregulated in ASD samples. For cardiomyocytes, there were 199 DEGs (42 upregulated and 157 downregulated) between ASD and normal samples. PPI analysis showed that cardiomyocyte marker gene FABP4 interacted with FOS, while FOS showed interaction with NPPA. Cell trajectory analysis showed that FABP4, FOS, and NPPA showed different expression changes along the pseudotime trajectory. Our results showed that single-cell RNA sequencing provides a powerful tool to study DEG profiles in the cell subpopulations of interest at the single-cell level. These findings enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ASD at both the cellular and molecular level and highlight potential targets for the treatment of ASD.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2021-09-14", "authors": ["ZunzheWang", "HuatingWang", "YaZhang", "FangpuYu", "LiwenYu", "ChengZhang"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.16914\n10.23750/abm.v90i10-S.8760\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.05.022\n10.1161/circresaha.116.309040\n10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62145-5\n10.1542/peds.2012-3435\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.05.039\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.073\n10.1111/j.1399-0004.2010.01435.x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.11.060\n10.1093/cvr/cvu134\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.11.010\n10.1016/j.mam.2017.07.003\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001\n10.1242/dev.173476\n10.1161/circulationaha.117.030742\n10.1007/978-1-4939-0512-6_3\n10.1093/nar/gky900\n10.1093/database/baz046\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.079\n10.1101/507871\n10.1007/s00441-014-2079-2\n10.1038/nbt.2859\n10.1038/s41467-019-09234-6\n10.1186/1471-2105-14-7\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btr260\n10.1093/nar/gku1003\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1016/j.biosystems.2014.11.005\n10.1186/1532-429x-14-83\n10.1089/omi.2011.0118\n10.1089/dna.2014.2600\n10.1007/s00018-017-2737-0\n10.23736/s0031-0808.17.03321-3\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.09.013\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.10.006\n10.1016/j.lfs.2006.12.012\n10.1161/01.res.85.2.137\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.09.064\n10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2017.04.008\n10.4022/jafib.45\n10.1242/dev.132019\n10.1530/joe-17-0031\n10.1371/journal.pone.0157372\n10.1111/jcmm.15666\n10.1016/j.cjca.2013.12.003\n10.1093/hmg/ddm302\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.08.004\n10.1242/dev.02499\n10.1093/abbs/gmr090"}

{"title": "Advances in Nanomaterials for Injured Heart Repair.", "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Because of the limited regenerative capacity of adult myocardium to compensate for the loss of heart tissue after ischemic infarction, scientists have been exploring the possible mechanisms involved in the pathological process of ASCVD and searching for alternative means to regenerate infarcted cardiac tissue. Although numerous studies have pursued innovative solutions for reversing the pathological process of ASCVD and improving the effectiveness of delivering therapeutics, the translation of those advances into downstream clinical applications remains unsatisfactory because of poor safety and low efficacy. Recently, nanomaterials (NMs) have emerged as a promising new strategy to strengthen both the efficacy and safety of ASCVD therapy. Thus, a comprehensive review of NMs used in ASCVD treatment will be useful. This paper presents an overview of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ASCVD and the multifunctional mechanisms of NM-based therapy, including antioxidative, anti-inflammation and antiapoptosis mechanisms. The technological improvements of NM delivery are summarized and the clinical transformations concerning the use of NMs to treat ASCVD are examined.

The present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between obesity and heart during nonfatal bacterial infection. Male normal (lean) and diet-induced obesity mice (DIO, fed with high-fat diet) were chosen to perform nasal instillation with E. coli to establish a nonfatal acute mouse model. The cardiac histopathology, inflammation and oxidative damage, as well as apoptosis were detected post-infection. The results revealed that the Escherichia coli (E.coli)-infected mice exhibited increased cardiac index, contents of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, leptin and resistin, levels of apoptotic proteins (caspase-3 and caspase-9, and bax/bcl-2 ratio), cardiac pathological changes and oxidative stress. Furthermore, these parameters were more serious in the lean mice than those in the DIO mice. In summary, our findings gave a new sight that E.coli infection impaired heart via histopathological lesions, inflammation and oxidative stress and excessive apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.

However, the roles of lncRNAs in acute myocarditis (AM), especially fulminant myocarditis (FM), remain unclear.\nFM and non-fulminant myocarditis (NFM) were induced by coxsackie B3 virus\u00a0(CVB3) in different mouse strains. Then, the expression profiles of the lncRNAs in the heart tissues were detected by sequencing. Finally, the patterns were analyzed by Pearson/Spearman rank correlation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Cytoscape 3.7.\nFirst, 1,216, 983, 1,606, and 2,459 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in CVB3-treated A/J, C57BL/6, BALB/c, and C3H mice with myocarditis, respectively. Among them, 88 lncRNAs were commonly dysregulated in all four models. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses further confirmed that four out of the top six commonly dysregulated lncRNAs were upregulated in all four models. Moreover, the levels of ENSMUST00000188819, ENSMUST00000199139, and ENSMUST00000222401 were significantly elevated in the heart and spleen and correlated with the severity of cardiac inflammatory infiltration. Meanwhile, 923 FM-specific dysregulated lncRNAs were detected, among which the levels of MSTRG.26098.49, MSTRG.31307.11, MSTRG.31357.2, and MSTRG.32881.28 were highly correlated with LVEF.\nExpression of lncRNAs is significantly dysregulated in acute myocarditis, which may play different roles in the progression of AM.", "journal": "Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology", "date": "2021-09-11", "authors": ["XiangNie", "HuihuiLi", "JinWang", "YuanyuanCai", "JiahuiFan", "BeibeiDai", "ChenChen", "Dao WenWang"], "doi": "10.3389/fcimb.2021.704919\n10.15252/emmm.201708089\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.04.063\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.012\n10.1016/j.healun.2010.03.003\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht210\n10.21037/cdt-20-545\n10.1016/j.virusres.2018.08.018\n10.1056/NEJMra0800028\n10.1186/s12935-019-0922-y\n10.1038/nri3800\n10.1097/BOR.0b013e328353372d\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.318437\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.02.007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306573\n10.2217/fmb.15.5\n10.2741/928\n10.1128/iai.39.2.851-864.1983\n10.1038/ncpcardio1331\n10.1093/nar/gky1095\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.002857\n10.1164/rccm.200311-1499OC\n10.1128/jvi.75.13.5860-5869.2001\n10.1186/s12864-016-3253-6\n10.3389/fped.2019.00283\n10.1007/s11897-014-0196-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.315865\n10.1002/ehf2.12760\n10.1016/j.omtn.2018.05.013\n10.1016/j.omtm.2020.05.005\n10.3109/08916930903509056\n10.1128/mBio.00206-10\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.108\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.03.046\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.08.029\n10.1016/s0140-6736(11)60648-x\n10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100052\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2019.09.017\n10.1016/0002-9149(93)91113-V\n10.1016/0378-1119(94)90281-x\n10.1128/mcb.4.4.736\n10.1152/ajpheart.00158.2018\n10.3892/mmr.2017.8118\n10.1007/s11427-018-9385-3\n10.1007/s12079-020-00589-w\n10.2147/CMAR.S245990\n10.1111/jcmm.15720\n10.1016/j.gene.2016.09.014\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.06.017\n10.3389/fcimb.2020.00312\n10.1038/s41392-020-00445-8\n10.7150/thno.33178\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.06.003"}
{"title": "In Vitro and In Vivo Effects of SerpinA1 on the Modulation of Transthyretin Proteolysis.", "abstract": "Transthyretin (TTR) proteolysis has been recognized as a complementary mechanism contributing to transthyretin-related amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis). Accordingly, amyloid deposits can be composed mainly of full-length TTR or contain a mixture of both cleaved and full-length TTR, particularly in the heart. The fragmentation pattern at Lys48 suggests the involvement of a serine protease, such as plasmin. The most common TTR variant, TTR V30M, is susceptible to plasmin-mediated proteolysis, and the presence of TTR fragments facilitates TTR amyloidogenesis. Recent studies revealed that the serine protease inhibitor, SerpinA1, was differentially expressed in hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) from ATTR patients. In this work, we evaluated the effects of SerpinA1 on in vitro and in vivo modulation of TTR V30M proteolysis, aggregation, and deposition. We found that plasmin-mediated TTR proteolysis and aggregation are partially inhibited by SerpinA1. Furthermore, in vivo downregulation of SerpinA1 increased TTR levels in mice plasma and deposition in the cardiac tissue of older animals. The presence of TTR fragments was observed in the heart of young and old mice but not in other tissues following SerpinA1 knockdown. Increased proteolytic activity, particularly plasmin activity, was detected in mice plasmas. Overall, our results indicate that SerpinA1 modulates TTR proteolysis and aggregation in vitro and in vivo.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-09-11", "authors": ["FilipaBezerra", "ChristophNiemietz", "Hartmut H JSchmidt", "AndreeZibert", "ShulingGuo", "Brett PMonia", "PaulaGon\u00e7alves", "Maria Jo\u00e3oSaraiva", "Maria Ros\u00e1rioAlmeida"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22179488\n10.1007/s40120-020-00210-7\n10.1007/s10741-021-10080-2\n10.1080/13506129.2018.1549825\n10.1002/humu.1380050302\n10.1021/bi800636q\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.018\n10.1080/13506129.2003.12088568\n10.1080/13506129.2016.1257986\n10.1021/bi00096a024\n10.1074/jbc.M101024200\n10.3390/ijms22094429\n10.1006/jmbi.2002.5441\n10.1002/path.1759\n10.1002/path.2411\n10.3109/13506129.2013.797890\n10.1007/s00109-010-0695-1\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31824b3749\n10.1074/jbc.M114.563981\n10.1073/pnas.1317488111\n10.15252/emmm.201505357\n10.1073/pnas.1802977115\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.003990\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0752172.x\n10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02183.x\n10.1111/j.1538-7836.2007.02457.x\n10.1080/13506120902879269\n10.1097/00001756-199202000-00020\n10.1074/jbc.274.23.15990\n10.1677/jme.1.01530\n10.1186/1479-7364-7-22\n10.1371/journal.pone.0125392\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00479\n10.1242/jcs.219824\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.112217\n10.1111/jcmm.12024\n10.1111/joim.12585\n10.3109/13506129809003843\n10.1002/pro.3420\n10.1038/s41598-018-37230-1\n10.1074/jbc.R115.639799\n10.1159/000265422\n10.1080/13506120600877003\n10.1136/jnnp-2013-305973\n10.1371/journal.pone.0211983\n10.1074/jbc.M117.786657\n10.1074/jbc.RA119.007851\n10.1038/s41467-019-13038-z\n10.4161/rdis.28511\n10.1021/bi00223a017\n10.3390/jcm10030407\n10.1186/s12974-017-0891-9"}

This study explores the role of metformin, a first-line antihyperglycemic agent, in postinfarction fibrotic and inflammatory remodeling in mice. Three-month-old C57BI/6J mice were submitted to 30 min cardiac ischemia followed by reperfusion for 14 days. Intraperitoneal treatment with metformin (5 mg/kg) was initiated 15 min after the onset of reperfusion and maintained for 14 days. Real-time PCR was used to determine the levels of COL3A1, \u03b1SMA, CD68, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Increased collagen deposition and infiltration of macrophages in heart tissues are associated with upregulation of the inflammation-associated genes in mice after 14 days of reperfusion. Metformin treatment markedly reduced postinfarction fibrotic remodeling and CD68-positive cell population in mice. Moreover, metformin resulted in reduced expression of COL3A1, \u03b1SMA and CD68 after 14 days of reperfusion. Taken together, these results open new perspectives for the use of metformin as a drug that counteracts adverse myocardial fibroticand inflammatory remodeling after MI.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-09-11", "authors": ["HalynaLoi", "SolomiiaKramar", "CharlotteLaborde", "DimitriMarsal", "NathaliePizzinat", "DanielCussac", "JeromeRoncalli", "FredericBoal", "HeleneTronchere", "OleksandraOleshchuk", "MykhayloKorda", "OksanaKunduzova"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22179393\n10.1056/NEJM199807233390404\n10.1016/j.jchf.2014.08.004\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00018-7\n10.1186/s12933-015-0299-8\n10.1177/1089253211436350\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.11.004\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.110.960039\n10.1038/nrcardio.2011.154\n10.1136/hrt.2004.046540\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.04.059\n10.1038/labinvest.2016.116\n10.1161/01.RES.0000130526.20854.fa\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030450\n10.1007/s10741-010-9169-3\n10.1160/TH08-12-0837\n10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.11.015\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr389\n10.1073/pnas.0607700103\n10.2337/dc20-S009\n10.1056/NEJMoa0806470\n10.1046/j.1365-2125.1999.00092.x\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.2010.03098.x\n10.7326/0003-4819-137-1-200207020-00009\n10.1007/s12265-012-9410-7\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00154\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.158\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.199\n10.1093/cvr/cvq066\n10.1371/journal.pone.0182777\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.033\n10.1172/JCI13505\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.190918\n10.1016/j.numecd.2017.04.009\n10.1172/JCI74783\n10.1056/NEJMra1300575\n10.1038/ncomms12260\n10.1038/s41584-019-0324-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042375\n10.1177/1479164114562411\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.101866\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.12.001\n10.4081/ejh.2014.2448\n10.1038/ijo.2014.122"}
{"title": "Recent Advances in Gene Therapy for Cardiac Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for enormous socio-economic impact and the highest mortality globally. The standard of care for CVDs, which includes medications and surgical interventions, in most cases, can delay but not prevent the progression of disease. Gene therapy has been considered as a potential therapy to improve the outcomes of CVDs as it targets the molecular mechanisms implicated in heart failure. Cardiac reprogramming, therapeutic angiogenesis using growth factors, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic therapies are the modalities of cardiac gene therapy that have led to promising results in preclinical studies. Despite the benefits observed in animal studies, the attempts to translate them to humans have been inconsistent so far. Low concentration of the gene product at the target site, incomplete understanding of the molecular pathways of the disease, selected gene delivery method, difference between animal models and humans among others are probable causes of the inconsistent results in clinics. In this review, we discuss the most recent applications of the aforementioned gene therapy strategies to improve cardiac tissue regeneration in preclinical and clinical studies as well as the challenges associated with them.

In order to enhance cell engraftment, most studies have focused on the pretreatment of transplantable cells. Here we have considered an alternative approach that involves the preconditioning of infarcted heart tissue to reduce endogenous cell activity and thus provide an advantage to our exogenous cells. This treatment is routinely used in other tissues such as bone marrow and skeletal muscle to improve cell engraftment, but it has never been taken in cardiac tissue.

GO, DADS and CAR were given to rats in their respective groups, either alone or together, with the addition of isoprenaline (3 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) during the last 10 days of treatment. At the end of 14 days of treatment, blood samples were collected, the hearts were excised under anesthesia and weighed. Heart tissue homogenate was used to measure superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Furthermore, the serum activities of cardiac markers, including lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and cardiac troponin, were checked. Moreover, inflammatory markers including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin one beta, interleukin six, and kappa bp65 subunit were assessed. Rats that received GO, DADS, and CAR exhibited a significant increase in the cardiac antioxidant enzyme activities with a simultaneous decrease in serum cardiac markers enzymes and inflammatory markers. The TBARS were significantly reduced in rats that received treatment. The addition of carvedilol to GO or DADS significantly elevated antioxidant activities and decreased the release of cardiac enzymes into blood circulation. Both DADS and GOl were almost similar in efficacy, indicating the potential role of DADS in garlic oil-mediated cardioprotection.

In the current study, potential developmental cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity following HFPO-DA exposure in chicken embryo has been investigated, focusing on the roles of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1), the major molecular target in PFOA-induced toxicities. HFPO-DA was exposed to fertile chicken eggs via air cell injection, morphology and function of the target organs (heart and liver) in hatchlings were investigated with histopathology and electrocardiography, and the serum levels of HFPO-DA had been measured with quadrupole-time of flight liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Q-TOF LC/MS). Additionally, lentivirus-mediated in ovo PPAR\u03b1 silencing was used to assess the roles of PPAR\u03b1 in HFPO-DA induced developmental toxicities. The results indicated that developmental exposure to HFPO-DA induced developmental cardiotoxicity, including thinned right ventricular wall and elevated heart rates, similar to those observed with PFOA exposure, as well as developmental hepatotoxicity in the form of steatosis. Silencing of PPAR\u03b1 alleviated such effects, suggesting participation of PPAR\u03b1 in HFPO-DA induced developmental toxicities in chicken embryo. Moreover, enhanced expression of PPAR\u03b1 downstream genes, cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (EHHADH), were observed in HFPO-DA exposed animal heart tissues, which can be abolished by PPAR\u03b1 silencing. On the other hand, liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and CD36 expression were effectively enhanced in exposed liver tissues, but not EHHADH, suggesting differential mechanism of toxicity in heart and liver tissues. In summary, developmental exposure to HFPO-DA induced developmental cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in hatchling chickens similar to PFOA, and PPAR\u03b1 still participates in such toxicities, with some differential downstream gene regulations in different organs.

Yet, several issues remain to be resolved including the generation of tissues with high cardiomyocyte density. Here, it is shown that the integration of the glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 inhibitor CHIR99021 in collagen I hydrogels promotes proliferation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (hiPSC) cardiomyocytes post-fabrication improving contractility of and calcium flow in engineered 3D cardiac microtissues. CHIR99021 has no effect on the gelation kinetics or the mechanical properties of collagen I hydrogels. Analysis of cell density and proliferation based on Ki-67 staining indicates that integration of CHIR99021 together with external CHIR99021 stimulation increases hiPSC-cardiomyocyte number by \u22482-fold within 7 d post-fabrication. Analysis of the contractility of engineered cardiac tissues after another 3 d in the absence of external CHIR99021 shows that CHIR99021-induced hiPSC-cardiomyocyte proliferation results in synchronized calcium flow, rhythmic beating, increased speed of contraction and contraction amplitude, and reduced peak-to-peak time.

In the present study, the proteome differences in lung and heart tissues were compared between yak (Bos grunniens) and three cattle strains (Bos taurus, Holstein, Sanjiang and Tibetan cattle) using the sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra/data-independent acquisition (SWATH/DIA) proteomic method. In total, 51,755 peptides and 7215 proteins were identified. In the lung tissue, there were 162, 310 and 118 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) in Tibetan, Holstein and Sanjiang cattle compared to yak respectively. In the heart tissue, there were 71, 57 and 78 DAPs in Tibetan, Holstein and Sanjiang cattle compared to yak respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that the DAPs were enriched for the retinol metabolism and toll-like receptor categories in lung tissue. The changes in these two pathways may regulate hypoxia-induced factor and immune function in yaks.

{"title": "Substrate Stiffness Influences Structural and Functional Remodeling in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Novel treatment strategies for cardiac tissue regeneration are heading for the use of engineered cardiac tissue made from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Despite the proven cardiogenic phenotype of these cells, a significant lack of structural and functional properties of mature myocytes prevents safe integration into the diseased heart. To date, maturation processes of cardiomyocytes remain largely unknown but may comprise biophysical cues from the immediate cell environment. Mechanosensing is one critical ability of cells to react to environmental changes. Accordingly, the surrounding substrate stiffness, comprised of extracellular matrix (ECM), cells, and growth surface, critically influences the myocyte's physiology, as known from deleterious remodeling processes in fibrotic hearts. Conversely, the mechanical properties during culture of iPSC-CMs may impact on their structural and functional maturation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the environmental stiffness influences structural and functional properties of iPSC-CMs and investigated the effect of different substrate stiffnesses on cell contractility, excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, and intercellular coupling. Culture surfaces with defined stiffnesses ranging from rigid glass with 25GPa to PDMS of physiological softness were coated with ECM proteins and seeded with murine iPSC-CMs. Using confocal imaging, cardiac protein expression was assessed.

Myocardial ischemia is the main type of CAD, which negatively affects health worldwide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function and mechanism of myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) in myocardial ischemia.\nHuman cardiomyocytes (HCM) were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to set the in vitro model and mouse myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) was set for in vivo model. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence analysis. Inflammatory cytokines levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gene and protein expressions were identified by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction or Western blotting. The interaction of MIAT, miR-181a-5p, and janus kinase 2 (JAK2) was identified by dual-luciferase report assay. Mouse heart tissues histopathological condition were observed by hematoxylin and eosin assays.\nExpression of MIAT and JAK2 were increased in OGD-treated HCM and mice of I/R model group, and miR-181a-5p was decreased. MIAT silencing could reverse the OGD treatment induced cell proliferation inhibition, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl2-associated X (Bax) levels increased, while those of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and mitochondria's cyt-C decreased. Besides, MIAT knockdown attenuated the OGD-induced increase of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels. Moreover, MIAT targeted miR-181a-5p to enhance the expression of JAK2 and signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), and miR-181a-5p overexpression promoted proliferation, whereas it inhibited apoptosis in OGD-induced cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the regulatory effects of MIAT knockdown in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory injury was reversed by inhibition of miR-181a-5p or overexpression of JAK2 in OGD-treated HCM. Knockdown of MIAT reduced myocardial injury caused by I/R treatment in vivo.\nMIAT knockdown inhibited apoptosis and inflammation by regulating JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway via targeting miR-181a-5p in myocardial ischemia model.

As such, the potential environmental and health risk caused by low-dose exposure to PCBs has attracted much attention. 3, 3', 4, 4', 5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126), the highest toxicity compound among dioxin-like-PCBs, has been widely used and mass-produced. Cardiotoxicity is PCB126's crucial adverse effect. Maintaining proper metabolism underlies heart health, whereas the impact of PCB126 exposure on cardiac metabolic patterns has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we administered 0.5 and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg bw of PCB126 to adult male mice weekly by gavage for eight weeks. Pathological results showed that low-dose PCB126 exposure induced heart injury. Metabolomic analysis of the heart tissue exposed to low-dose PCB126 identified 59 differential metabolites that were involved in lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Typical metabolomic characteristic of cardiac hypertrophy was reflected by accumulation of fatty acids (e.g. palmitic, palmitoleic, and linoleic acid), and disturbance of carbohydrates including D-glucose and intermediates in TCA cycle (fumaric, succinic, and citric acid). Low-dose PCB126 exposure increased glycine and threonine, the amino acids necessary for the productions of collagen and elastin. Besides, PCB126-exposed mice exhibited upregulation of collagen synthesis enzymes and extracellular matrix proteins, indicative of cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, the expression of genes related to TGF\u03b2/PPAR\u03b3/MMP-2 signaling pathway was perturbed in the PCB126-treated hearts. Together, our results reveal that low-dose PCB126 exposure disrupts cardiac metabolism correlated with hypertrophy and fibrosis. This study sheds light on the underlying mechanism of PCBs' cardiotoxicity and identifies potential sensitive biomarkers for environmental monitoring.", "journal": "Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)", "date": "2021-09-07", "authors": ["CanWang", "RuinaCui", "CongyingNiu", "XialiZhong", "QichengZhu", "DiJi", "XianjieLi", "HongxiaZhang", "ChunqiaoLiu", "LinaZhou", "YanliLi", "GuowangXu", "YanhongWei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118079"}
{"title": "A viscoelastic model for human myocardium.", "abstract": "Understanding the biomechanics of the heart in health and disease plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure. The use of computational biomechanical models for therapy assessment is paving the way for personalized treatment, and relies on accurate constitutive equations mapping strain to stress. Current state-of-the art constitutive equations account for the nonlinear anisotropic stress-strain response of cardiac muscle using hyperelasticity theory. While providing a solid foundation for understanding the biomechanics of heart tissue, most current laws neglect viscoelastic phenomena observed experimentally. Utilizing experimental data from human myocardium and knowledge of the hierarchical structure of heart muscle, we present a fractional nonlinear anisotropic viscoelastic constitutive model. The model is shown to replicate biaxial stretch, triaxial cyclic shear and triaxial stress relaxation experiments (mean error \u223c7.68%), showing improvements compared to its hyperelastic (mean error \u223c24%) counterparts. Model sensitivity, fidelity and parameter uniqueness are demonstrated. The model is also compared to rate-dependent biaxial stretch as well as different modes of biaxial stretch, illustrating extensibility of the model to a range of loading phenomena. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The viscoelastic response of human heart tissues has yet to be integrated into common constitutive models describing cardiac mechanics. In this work, a fractional viscoelastic modeling approach is introduced based on the hierarchical structure of heart tissue. From these foundations, the current state-of-the-art biomechanical models of the heart muscle are transformed using fractional viscoelasticity, replicating passive muscle function across multiple experimental tests. Comparisons are drawn with current models to highlight the improvements of this approach and predictive responses show strong qualitative agreement with experimental data. The proposed model presents the first constitutive model aimed at capturing viscoelastic nonlinear response across multiple testing regimes, providing a platform for better understanding the biomechanics of myocardial tissue in health and disease.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2021-09-07", "authors": ["DavidNordsletten", "AdelaCapilnasiu", "WillZhang", "AnnaWittgenstein", "MyrianthiHadjicharalambous", "GerhardSommer", "RalphSinkus", "Gerhard AHolzapfel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2021.08.036"}

The main manifestation of MF is the excessive deposition of collagen in the myocardium. Here, we explored whether Huangqi Shengmai Yin (HSY) can inhibit isoprenaline (ISO)-induced myocardial collagen deposition in rats, thereby reducing the cardiac dysfunction caused by MF. The results of echocardiography showed that HSY upregulated fractional shortening and ejection fraction, and reduced the left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the rats with MF. Pathological results showed that HSY protected myocardium, inhibited apoptosis, and effectively reduced collagen deposition. HSY also inhibited the expression of collagen I and III and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in the heart tissue. HSY increased the expression of Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) and inhibited the protein levels of the components in the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/Smad pathway. At the same time, it also regulated the expression of related proteins in the matrix metalloproteinases family. In summary, HSY played a therapeutic role in rats with ISO-induced MF by protecting myocardium and inhibiting collagen deposition.

{"title": "Bidirectional relationship between cardiac extracellular matrix and cardiac cells in ischemic heart disease.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), including myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies, are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Cardiac-derived stem and progenitor cells have shown promise as a therapeutic for IHD but are limited by poor cell survival, limited retention, and rapid washout. One mechanism to address this is to encapsulate the cells in a matrix or three-dimensional construct, so as to provide structural support and better mimic the cells' physiological microenvironment during administration. More specifically, the extracellular matrix (ECM), the native cellular support network, has been a strong candidate for this purpose. Moreover, there is a strong consensus that the ECM and its residing cells, including cardiac stem cells, have a constant interplay in response to tissue development, aging, disease progression, and repair. When externally stimulated, the cells and ECM work together to mutually maintain the local homeostasis by initially altering the ECM composition and stiffness, which in turn alters the cellular response and behavior. Given this constant interplay, understanding the mechanism of bidirectional cell-ECM interaction is essential to develop better cell implantation matrices to enhance cell engraftment and cardiac tissue repair. This review summarizes current understanding in the field, elucidating the signaling mechanisms between cardiac ECM and residing cells in response to IHD onset.

When combined with Toll-like receptor agonists, Tc24-C4 immunization reduces parasitemia, parasites in cardiac tissue, and cardiac fibrosis and inflammation in animal models. To support further research on the vaccine candidate and its mechanism of action, murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Tc24-C4 were generated. Here, we report new findings made with mAb Tc24-C4/884 that detects Tc24-WT and Tc24-C4, as well as native Tc24 in T. cruzi on ELISA, western blots, and different imaging techniques. Surprisingly, detection of Tc24 by Tc24-C/884 in fixed T. cruzi trypomastigotes required permeabilization of the parasite, revealing that Tc24 is not exposed on the surface of T. cruzi, making a direct role of antibodies in the induced protection after Tc24-C4 immunization less likely. We further observed that after immunostaining T. cruzi-infected cells with mAb Tc24-C4/884, the expression of Tc24 decreases significantly when T. cruzi trypomastigotes enter host cells and transform into amastigotes. However, Tc24 is then upregulated in association with parasite flagellar growth linked to re-transformation into the trypomastigote form, prior to host cellular escape.

TRs ability to form combinatorial complexes with an array of partners accounts for TRs physiological flexibility in modulating gene expression. To identify proteins that associate with TR\u03b21 in the heart we performed a pull-down assay on cardiac tissue using GST-TR\u03b21 as bait and identified the bound proteins by LC MS/MS. ACAA2, a mitochondrial thiolase enzyme, was identified as a novel interacting protein. We confirmed ACAA2 localized to the nucleus and using a luciferase reporter assay showed ACAA2 acted as a TH-dependent coactivator for TR\u03b21. ACAA2 showed an ability to bind to TR recognition sequences but did not alter TR\u03b21 DNA binding ability. Thus, ACAA2 as a novel TR\u03b21 associating protein opens a new paradigm to understanding how TH/TRs may be manipulated by energetic pathway molecules.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2021-09-03", "authors": ["WesleyWang", "DolenaLedee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.08.073"}
{"title": "Efficacy of Physical Exercise to Offset Anthracycline-Induced Cardiotoxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical and Preclinical Studies.", "abstract": "Background Physical exercise is an intervention that might protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In this meta-analysis and systematic review, we aimed to estimate the effect of exercise on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and to evaluate mechanisms underlying exercise-mediated cardioprotection using (pre)clinical evidence. Methods and Results We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. Cochrane's and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk-of-bias tools were used to assess the validity of human and animal studies, respectively. Cardiotoxicity outcomes reported by \u22653 studies were pooled and structured around the type of exercise intervention. Forty articles were included, of which 3 were clinical studies. Overall, in humans (sample sizes ranging from 24 to 61), results were indicative of exercise-mediated cardioprotection, yet they were not sufficient to establish whether physical exercise protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In animal studies (n=37), a pooled analysis demonstrated that forced exercise interventions significantly mitigated in vivo and ex vivo doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity compared with nonexercised controls. Similar yet slightly smaller effects were found for voluntary exercise interventions. We identified oxidative stress and related pathways, and less doxorubicin accumulation as mechanisms underlying exercise-induced cardioprotection, of which the latter could act as an overarching mechanism. Conclusions Animal studies indicate that various exercise interventions can protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rodents. Less doxorubicin accumulation in cardiac tissue could be a key underlying mechanism. Given the preclinical evidence and limited availability of clinical data, larger and methodologically rigorous clinical studies are needed to clarify the role of physical exercise in preventing cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer.

Based on the available literatures, 10 genes related to MI with HL (HL-MI) were screened and detected in clinical samples. High-fat diet (HFD) was used to establish HL rat models, after which the rats were subcutaneously injected with PBS or isoproterenol hydrochloride to induce acute MI. Then, rats with HL-MI were injected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-DRP1, sh-NC, or sh-DRP1. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured. Cardiac function was evaluated by detecting left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Infarct size and histopathological changes were assessed as well as myocardial apoptosis and collagen deposition. The concentration of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in rat serum and cardiac tissues was also measured by ELISA. Mitochondrial function was shown by measuring the morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, caspase-1, and cleaved caspase-1) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were also assessed. The expressions of the 10 genes were measured in clinical samples and DRP1 was selected for further experiments with significantly upregulated expression in MI patients. HFD-induced rats showed increased body weight, concurrent with higher levels of TG, TC, and LDL-C and lower HDL-C level. Compared with the BD-PBS group, the HFD-PBS group presented higher mRNA and protein expression levels of DRP1, exacerbated cardiac functions, enlarged infarct size, loss of cardiomyocytes, and disordered island cardiomyocytes. In the HL-MI rat model, injection of pcDNA3.1-DRP1 enhanced the levels of serum lipids and inflammation cytokines, induced loss of a number of cardiomyocytes and collagen deposition, and decreased LVFS and LVEF, while injection of sh-DRP1 ameliorated myocardial injuries, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis. In coronary artery endothelial cells from the rats, loss of MMP was observed in the HFD-MI, LV-NC, LV-DRP1, and sh-NC groups and concomitantly, the sh-DRP1group showed increased MMP and decreased levels of mitochondrial ROS, cytochrome C, pro-apoptotic proteins, and NLRP3.

However, the protective effects of Se against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanism are rarely reported. In this study, we sought to explore whether Se protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting Nrf2-NLRP3 pathway. We found that Se treatment effectively alleviated DOX-induced myocardial dysfunctions, decreasing plasma markers associated with myocardial injury. Moreover, Se treatment significantly inhibited DOX-induced oxidative damages and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in heart tissues. Furthermore, Se treatment markedly promoted the expression of Nrf2 and prevented the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, suppression of Nrf2 abolished the cardioprotective effects of Se and diminished the inhibition of Se on NLRP3 inflammasome. Collectively, our study demonstrated that Se might protect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity via regulating Nrf2-NLRP3 pathway.

Mutations in the genes encoding mitochondrial proteins result in functionally defective protein complexes that contribute to energy deficiencies, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and accumulation of damaged mitochondria. We hypothesize that a dramatic alternation in redox state and associated mitochondrial dysfunction is the underlying cause of Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) deficiency mutant, resulting in heart failure.

Redox ratio (RR) assessment shows that mitochondrial dysfunction is extreme and could contribute to severe heart problems and eventual heart failure in the mutants.\nThree-dimensional redox ratio (NADH/FAD) rendering, and the volumetric mean value calculations confirmed significantly decreased cardiac RR in mutants by 31.90% and 12.32%, in renal mitochondrial RR compared to wild-type control. Further, histological assessment of newborn heart myocardial tissue indicated no significant difference in myocardial tissue architecture in both control and severe (HADHA\nThese results demonstrate that optical imaging can accurately estimate the redox state changes in newborn rat organs.

{"title": "Artesunate Restrains Maturation of Dendritic Cells and Ameliorates Heart Transplantation-Induced Acute Rejection in Mice through the PERK/ATF4/CHOP Signaling Pathway.", "abstract": "Heart transplantation (HT) is the only effective treatment for end-stage heart failure because it can effectively improve the survival rate and quality of life of patients with heart failure. Artesunate (ART) is an artemisinin derivative, with good water solubility and higher oral bioavailability. The main aim of this study was to determine the role of ART in HT mice.\nIn animal experiments, mice were divided into the control group, HT group, low ART+HT group, and high ART+HT group. Next, inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress injury, and myocardial cell apoptosis were determined in heart tissue. The proportion of multiple lymphocytes in spleen and lymph nodes was then determined using flow cytometry. In addition, cell experiments were conducted to determine the changes in expression of surface maturation markers of BMDC and changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species after LPS stimulation. Finally, western blot analysis was performed to determine the levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins (CHOP/ATF4/PERK).\nThe survival time of mice in the ART treatment group was significantly prolonged and was positively correlated with the dose. In animal experiments, ART significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in heart tissue and the proportion of CD4+CD8+ T cells in spleens and lymph nodes. Moreover, ART treatment lowered the 8-OHdg in hearts and myocardial apoptosis. In cell experiments, ART treatment slowed down the development and maturation of BMDCs by inhibiting the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins. Furthermore, the treatment alleviated the oxidative stress damage of BMDCs.\nART can inhibit maturation of dendritic cells through the endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathway, thereby alleviating acute rejection in mice after heart transplantation.", "journal": "Mediators of inflammation", "date": "2021-09-01", "authors": ["YuanyangChen", "SihaoZheng", "ZhiweiWang", "XinCai", "YanjiaChe", "QiWu", "ShunYuan", "XiaohanZhong"], "doi": "10.1155/2021/2481907\n10.1016/j.arr.2016.08.008\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.07.025\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.12.010\n10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153332\n10.3389/fcell.2019.00198\n10.1111/ajt.14543\n10.1080/15548627.2018.1536530\n10.1002/ejhf.640\n10.1038/s41569-021-00511-w\n10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001139\n10.1038/s41419-020-2469-1\n10.1002/jbmr.3134\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.05.021"}
{"title": "SHP-1/STAT3 Interaction Is Related to Luteolin-Induced Myocardial Ischemia Protection.", "abstract": "Prevention and management of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a key step in coronary heart disease surgery. Luteolin is a falconoid compound that has an antioxidant effect, but its mechanism in I/R injury in vivo and in vitro is still under explored. This study attempted to reveal the role of luteolin (Lut) in I/R through mediation of the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. To establish I/R rat models, the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was ligated for 30\u00a0min and re-perfused for 1\u00a0h in Lut-pretreated or nude rats. Comparisons between infarct area, cardiac dysfunction, and myocardial cell death and inflammatory reaction were performed in I/R-induced rats. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell models were established by stimulating H9c2 cells with 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. Simultaneously, H/R-related cell death and inflammatory reactions were investigated following Lut treatment. The target protein of Lut was identified using western blotting. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were also measured in serum or Lut-pretreated cell culture medium. The results revealed that compared with the I/R group, Lut treatment could significantly decrease myocardial infarction (MI) area, increase left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and decrease cell death and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum.

The procedure described here allowed for the processing of previously frozen archived heart tissues and eliminated the necessity of fresh mitochondria preparation for the assessment of mitochondrial ETC complexes, supercomplexes, and ETC complex activity profiles.

To obtain a precise emission spectrum, monodispersity in size is imperative, which is achieved by controlling the reaction kinetics in a continuous flow of active microreactors. Further, a multivariate approach (dimensional analysis) is employed to impose stringent control on the reaction process resulting in monodispersed preparation of cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots. Dimensional analysis knits multiple variables into a dimensionless mathematical form which not only predicts parameters precisely to obtain narrow size tunability but also guarantees reproducibility in synthesis.

{"title": "Modulation of Radiation-Induced NADPH Oxidases in Rat's Heart Tissues by Melatonin.", "abstract": "Experimental studies have shown that infiltration of inflammatory cells as well as upregulation of some cytokines play a central role in the development of late effects of ionizing radiation in heart tissues. Evidences have shown that an increased level of TGF-\u03b2 has a direct correlation with late effects of exposure to ionizing radiation such as chronic oxidative stress and fibrosis. Recent studies have shown that TGF-\u03b2, through upregulation of pro-oxidant enzymes such as NOX2 and NOX4, promotes continuous ROS production and accumulation of fibrosis.\nIn present study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of NOX2 and NOX4 signaling pathways as well as possible modulatory effects of melatonin on the expression of these genes.\nIn this experimental study, four groups of 20 rats (5 in each) were used as follows; G1: control; G2: melatonin; G3: radiation; G4: radiation + melatonin. 100 mg/kg of melatonin was administrated before irradiation of heart tissues with 15 Gy gamma rays. 10 weeks after irradiation, heart tissues were collected for real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nResults showed a significant increase in the expression of TGF-\u03b2, Smad2, NF-kB, NOX2 and NOX4. The upregulation of NOX2 was more obvious by 20-fold compared to other genes. Except for TGF-\u03b2, melatonin could attenuate the expression of other genes.\nThis study indicated that exposure of rat's heart tissues to radiation leads to upregulation of TGF-\u03b2-NOX4 and TGF-\u03b2-NOX2 pathways. Melatonin, through modulation of these genes, may be able to alleviate radiation-induced chronic oxidative stress and subsequent consequences.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical physics & engineering", "date": "2021-08-31", "authors": ["TayebehAryafar", "PeymanAmini", "SaeedRezapoor", "DheyauldeenShabeeb", "AhmedEleojo Musa", "MasoudNajafi", "AlirezaShirazi"], "doi": "10.31661/jbpe.v0i0.1094\n10.1016/j.eururo.2007.07.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135388\n10.1016/j.jnci.2015.07.005\n10.1016/j.ccl.2009.06.006\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.06.040\n10.3389/fonc.2015.00039\n10.3389/fcvm.2017.00066\n10.1136/bmj.b5349\n10.1097/MD.0000000000005051\n10.1016/j.radonc.2012.02.008\n10.1016/j.mrrev.2016.07.003\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2006.02336.x\n10.1038/bjc.2012.498\n10.2174/1874467211666181010154709\n10.1667/RR13887.1\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.06.024\n10.1093/mutage/ger001\n10.1667/RR1190.1\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.05.045\n10.1111/fcp.12498\n10.3390/cells8101158\n10.2478/v10001-009-0001-z\n10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S04\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2013.05.009\n10.22034/APJCP.2017.18.3.583\n10.1371/journal.pone.0119661\n10.1007/s00066-014-0745-7\n10.1016/j.radonc.2012.11.001\n10.1042/BJ20061846\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.10.003\n10.1111/jphp.12855\n10.1080/17425255.2018.1513492\n10.1155/2017/1835195\n10.2174/157015910792246155"}

{"title": "A Nano-Pharmaceutical Formula of Quercetin Protects from Cardiovascular Complications Associated with Metabolic Syndrome.", "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is closely associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases. We recently developed a nano-preparation of the flavonoid quercetin (QU) in a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS). The latter comprised a mixture composed of pumpkin seed oil, D-\u03b1-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1,000 succinate and polyethylene glycol. The QU SNEDDS preparations exhibited a considerably higher bioavailability compared with the standard quercetin suspension. Here, we investigated whether the quercetin loaded SNEDDS could offer better protection compared with the standard formulation against cardiovascular complications of MetS in rats. MetS was induced by high fructose, high salt and high fat diet for 12\u00a0weeks while the nano-preparation or the standard suspension of quercetin was orally administered for the last 6\u00a0weeks. Compared to little effect for the standard quercetin suspension (MQ), the treatment of MetS rats with the quercetin loaded SNEDDS (MNQ) virtually abolished the depressant effect of MetS on contractility index (control, 114 \u00b1 4; MetS, 92 \u00b1 3; MQ, 100 \u00b1 2; MNQ, 114 \u00b1 6 1/s) and rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax) (control, 8,171 \u00b1 274; MetS, 6,664 \u00b1 135; MQ, 6,776 \u00b1 108; MNQ, 7,498 \u00b1 303\u00a0mmHg/s). Likewise, the prolongation by MetS of electrocardiographic markers of arrhythmogenesis (QTc, JT, and Tpeak-to-Tend intervals) and concomitant rises in dicrotic notch pressure were preferentially reversed by quercetin nano-preparation.

{"title": "TAX1BP1 protects against myocardial infarction-associated cardiac anomalies through inhibition of inflammasomes in a RNF34/MAVS/NLRP3-dependent manner.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI), one of the most common cardiovascular emergencies, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Ample evidence has revealed an essential role for inflammasome activation and autophagy in the pathogenesis of acute MI. Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1), an adaptor molecule involved in termination of proinflammatory signaling, serves as an important selective autophagy adaptor, but its role in cardiac ischemia remains elusive. This study examined the role of TAX1BP1 in myocardial ischemic stress and the underlying mechanisms involved. Levels of TAX1BP1 were significantly downregulated in heart tissues of patients with ischemic heart disease and in a left anterior descending (LAD) ligation-induced model of acute MI. Adenovirus carrying TAX1BP1 was delivered into the myocardium. The acute MI induced procedure elicited an infarct and cardiac dysfunction, the effect of which was mitigated by TAX1BP1 overexpression with little effect from viral vector alone. TAX1BP1 nullified acute MI-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and associated mitochondrial dysfunction. TAX1BP1 overexpression suppressed NLRP3 mitochondrial localization by inhibiting the interaction of NLRP3 with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Further investigation revealed that ring finger protein 34 (RNF34) was recruited to interact with TAX1BP1 thereby facilitating autophagic degradation of MAVS through K27-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS. Knockdown of RNF34 using siRNA nullified TAX1BP1 yielded protection against hypoxia-induced MAVS mitochondrial accumulation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and associated loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, our results favor a cardioprotective role for TAX1BP1 in acute MI through repression of inflammasome activation in a RNF34/MAVS-dependent manner.", "journal": "Science bulletin", "date": "2021-08-30", "authors": ["HaixiaXu", "WenjunYu", "ShiqunSun", "CongyeLi", "JunRen", "YingmeiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scib.2021.01.030"}
{"title": "Electroconductive biomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is still the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The success of cell-based therapies and tissue engineering strategies for treatment of injured myocardium have been notably hindered due to the limitations associated with the selection of a proper cell source, lack of engraftment of engineered tissues and biomaterials with the host myocardium, limited vascularity, as well as immaturity of the injected cells. The first-generation approaches in cardiac tissue engineering (cTE) have mainly relied on the use of desired cells (e.g., stem cells) along with non-conductive natural or synthetic biomaterials for in vitro construction and maturation of functional cardiac tissues, followed by testing the efficacy of the engineered tissues in vivo. However, to better recapitulate the native characteristics and conductivity of the cardiac muscle, recent approaches have utilized electroconductive biomaterials or nanomaterial components within engineered cardiac tissues. This review article will cover the recent advancements in the use of electrically conductive biomaterials in cTE. The specific emphasis will be placed on the use of different types of nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles (GNPs), silicon-derived nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), as well as electroconductive polymers (ECPs) for engineering of functional and electrically conductive cardiac tissues. We will also cover the recent progress in the use of engineered electroconductive tissues for in vivo cardiac regeneration applications. We will discuss the opportunities and challenges of each approach and provide our perspectives on potential avenues for enhanced cTE. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Myocardial infarction (MI) is still the primary cause of death worldwide. Over the past decade, electroconductive biomaterials have increasingly been applied in the field of cardiac tissue engineering. This review article provides the readers with the leading advances in the in vitro applications of electroconductive biomaterials for cTE along with an in-depth discussion of injectable/transplantable electroconductive biomaterials and their delivery methods for in vivo MI treatment.

In the present case, it is noted that despite the severity of the condition denoted by hemodynamic instability and the need for electrical cardioversion, the surgical correction of the hiatal hernia was able to reverse the arrhythmic picture definitively.\nthe concomitance of AF and hiatal hernia can explain the difficulty to control the arrhythmic picture and is necessary to consider, as soon as possible, the surgical correction of the defect as part of the treatment.", "journal": "International journal of surgery case reports", "date": "2021-08-29", "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o Paulo Venanciode Carvalho", "Luca Giovanni AntonioPivetta", "Eduardo Rullo Maranh\u00e3oDias", "Pedro de Souza LucarrelliAntunes", "Pedro Henrique de FreitasAmaral", "SergioRoll"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.106316\n10.15386/mpr-1323\n10.21037/atm.2016.09.03\n10.3389/fsurg.2020.584196\n10.4022/jafib.894"}

We detected CVA2 replication and apoptosis in heart tissues from infected mice. The activity of total aspartate transaminase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was notably increased in heart tissues from infected mice. CVA2 infection also led to the disruption of cell-matrix interactions in heart tissues, including the increases of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)3, MMP8, MMP9, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)4.

Curcumin (Cur), a well known dietary polyphenol, could exert a significant cardioprotective effect, but the biological application of this substance is limited by its chemical insolubility. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we synthesised gold nanoparticles based on Cur (Cur-AuNPs). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorbance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed for the characterisation of synthesised NPs, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\u00a0were applied to detect Cur on the surface of AuNPs. Its cytotoxicity effect on H9c2 cells was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The biological efficacy of Cur-AuNPs was assessed after acute cardiotoxicity induction in BALB/c mice with DOX injection. The serum biomarkers, myocardial histological changes, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were then measured. The results revealed that the heart protection by Cur-AuNPs is more effective than Cur alone. Heart protective effect of Cur-AuNPs was evident both in the short-term (24\u00a0hours) and long-term (14\u00a0days) study. The results of Cur-AuNPs400 after 24\u00a0hours of toxicity induction displayed the reduction of the cardiac injury serum biomarkers (LDH, CK-MB, cTnI, ADT, and ALT) and apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase-3), as well as increase of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins without any sign of interfibrillar haemorrhage and intercellular spaces in the heart tissue microscopic images. Our long-term study signifies that Cur-AuNPs400 in DOX-intoxicated mice could successfully inhibit body and heart weight loss in comparison to DOX group.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["ZeynabSharifiaghdam", "FereshtehDalouchi", "MaryamSharifiaghdam", "ElnazShaabani", "FatemehRamezani", "FarnazNikbakht", "YaserAzizi"], "doi": "10.1111/1440-1681.13579"}

{"title": "MiR-126-3p Is Dynamically Regulated in Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition during Fibrosis.", "abstract": "In fibrotic diseases, myofibroblasts derive from a range of cell types including endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs are key regulators in biological processes but their profile is relatively understudied in EndMT. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), EndMT was induced by treatment with TGF\u03b22 and IL1\u03b2. A significant decrease in endothelial markers such as VE-cadherin, CD31 and an increase in mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin were observed. In parallel, miRNA profiling showed that miR-126-3p was down-regulated in HUVECs undergoing EndMT and over-expression of miR-126-3p prevented EndMT, maintaining CD31 and repressing fibronectin expression. EndMT was investigated using lineage tracing with transgenic Cdh5-Cre-ERT2; Rosa26R-stop-YFP mice in two established models of fibrosis: cardiac ischaemic injury and kidney ureteric occlusion. In both cardiac and kidney fibrosis, lineage tracing showed a significant subpopulation of endothelial-derived cells expressed mesenchymal markers, indicating they had undergone EndMT. In addition, miR-126-3p was restricted to endothelial cells and down-regulated in murine fibrotic kidney and heart tissue. These findings were confirmed in patient kidney biopsies. MiR-126-3p expression is restricted to endothelial cells and is down-regulated during EndMT.

{"title": "Intrinsically Conductive Polymers for Striated Cardiac Muscle Repair.", "abstract": "One of the most important features of striated cardiac muscle is the excitability that turns on the excitation-contraction coupling cycle, resulting in the heart blood pumping function. The function of the heart pump may be impaired by events such as myocardial infarction, the consequence of coronary artery thrombosis due to blood clots or plaques. This results in the death of billions of cardiomyocytes, the formation of scar tissue, and consequently impaired contractility. A whole heart transplant remains the gold standard so far and the current pharmacological approaches tend to stop further myocardium deterioration, but this is not a long-term solution. Electrically conductive, scaffold-based cardiac tissue engineering provides a promising solution to repair the injured myocardium. The non-conductive component of the scaffold provides a biocompatible microenvironment to the cultured cells while the conductive component improves intercellular coupling as well as electrical signal propagation through the scar tissue when implanted at the infarcted site. The in vivo electrical coupling of the cells leads to a better regeneration of the infarcted myocardium, reducing arrhythmias, QRS/QT intervals, and scar size and promoting cardiac cell maturation. This review presents the emerging applications of intrinsically conductive polymers in cardiac tissue engineering to repair post-ischemic myocardial insult.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["ArsalanUl Haq", "FeliciaCarotenuto", "FabioDe Matteis", "PaoloProsposito", "RobertoFrancini", "LauraTeodori", "AlessandraPasquo", "PaoloDi Nardo"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22168550\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz859\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.11.002\n10.3390/su13010251\n10.1056/NEJMra1112570\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1016/j.reth.2019.06.004\n10.1016/j.copbio.2004.08.007\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.1002/advs.201500122\n10.5483/BMBRep.2016.49.1.165\n10.2147/IJN.S153758\n10.1089/scd.2017.0051\n10.1111/jcmm.14630\n10.1007/s40472-021-00319-0\n10.1063/1.5116579\n10.3390/ma13102344\n10.1002/adhm.201600307\n10.1007/s10544-017-0184-1\n10.1021/nl201514a\n10.1016/j.gene.2016.01.006\n10.1073/pnas.0400752101\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0702676\n10.1038/s41467-018-06368-x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120285\n10.1016/j.msec.2020.111600\n10.3390/ma13030512\n10.1002/mabi.201700147\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111565\n10.1021/nn3021234\n10.1007/s10965-020-02052-1\n10.1080/10601325.2010.518847\n10.1002/mabi.200800005\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.2011.01257.x\n10.1002/jbm.a.35447\n10.1007/s10856-011-4259-x\n10.1002/app.31296\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.11.037\n10.1039/C3PY01634J\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.07.061\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.065\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.023\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.09.019\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.024\n10.1163/156856206774879180\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.06.036\n10.1021/acsnano.5b03644\n10.1021/acsami.6b04911\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.072\n10.1002/adfm.201908612\n10.1016/j.msec.2018.04.061\n10.1126/sciadv.1601007\n10.1007/s10853-020-05219-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.042\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.12.008\n10.1016/j.apmt.2019.02.013\n10.1039/C5RA12218J\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.018\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.12.063\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2011.11.008\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.11.065\n10.1002/jbm.a.33128\n10.1007/s11706-018-0445-9\n10.1007/s10439-016-1755-7\n10.1016/j.msec.2018.05.037\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014937\n10.1039/C8TB01116H\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00253-0\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.09.025\n10.1016/j.apmt.2019.01.003\n10.1002/jbm.a.33200\n10.1002/adma.201704235\n10.1101/cshperspect.a004242\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00732-0\n10.1373/49.8.1279\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.942284\n10.1038/s41467-019-09003-5\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.08.045\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.02.008\n10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2016.09.003\n10.1002/cnma.201900146\n10.1039/C9BM02012H\n10.1002/adfm.201803951\n10.1039/C9NR04989D\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b00135\n10.1039/D0BM01176B\n10.1109/TBME.2017.2764000\n10.3389/fneng.2011.00014\n10.1152/physrev.00002.2005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.09.005\n10.7150/thno.22599\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119672\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.01.027\n10.1016/j.pcad.2006.08.009\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01944-7\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.07.021\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000085658.98621.49\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00032-8\n10.2174/1568006033337276\n10.1002/adfm.201800618\n10.1093/cvr/cvz040\n10.1159/000438594\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.09.032\n10.1002/jbm.a.31337\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.02.018"}

To this end, we recently developed human cardiac organoids (hCOs) for modeling human myocardium. Here, we perform a transcriptomic analysis of various in vitro hiPSC-CM platforms (2D iPSC-CM, 3D iPSC-CM and hCOs) to deduce the strengths and limitations of these in vitro models. We further compared iPSC-CM models to human myocardium samples. Our data show that the 3D in vitro environment of 3D hiPSC-CMs and hCOs stimulates the expression of genes associated with tissue formation. The hCOs demonstrated diverse physiologically relevant cellular functions compared to the hiPSC-CM only models. Including other cardiac cell types within hCOs led to more transcriptomic similarities to adult myocardium. hCOs lack matured cardiomyocytes and immune cells, which limits a complete replication of human adult myocardium.

This method has several disadvantages, namely its destructive nature and inadequacy in experimental situations where tissue is scarce. Here, we present an image processing algorithm for quantitative analysis of DNA content in (de)cellularized tissues as a faster, simpler and more comprehensive alternative. Our method uses local entropy measurements of a phase contrast image to create a mask, which is then applied to corresponding nuclei labelled (UV) images to extract average fluorescence intensities as an estimate of DNA content. The method can be used on native or decellularized tissue to quantify DNA content, thus allowing quantitative assessment of decellularization procedures. We confirm that our new method yields results in line with those obtained using the standard DNA quantification method and that it is successful for both lung and heart tissues. We are also able to accurately obtain a timeline of decreasing DNA content with increased incubation time with a decellularizing agent.

{"title": "Extrinsically Conductive Nanomaterials for Cardiac Tissue Engineering Applications.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is the consequence of coronary artery thrombosis resulting in ischemia and necrosis of the myocardium. As a result, billions of contractile cardiomyocytes are lost with poor innate regeneration capability. This degenerated tissue is replaced by collagen-rich fibrotic scar tissue as the usual body response to quickly repair the injury. The non-conductive nature of this tissue results in arrhythmias and asynchronous beating leading to total heart failure in the long run due to ventricular remodelling. Traditional pharmacological and assistive device approaches have failed to meet the utmost need for tissue regeneration to repair MI injuries. Engineered heart tissues (EHTs) seem promising alternatives, but their non-conductive nature could not resolve problems such as arrhythmias and asynchronous beating for long term in-vivo applications. The ability of nanotechnology to mimic the nano-bioarchitecture of the extracellular matrix and the potential of cardiac tissue engineering to engineer heart-like tissues makes it a unique combination to develop conductive constructs. Biomaterials blended with conductive nanomaterials could yield conductive constructs (referred to as extrinsically conductive). These cell-laden conductive constructs can alleviate cardiac functions when implanted in-vivo.

{"title": "Evaluation of 16S rDNA Heart Tissue PCR as a Complement to Blood Cultures for the Routine Etiological Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis.", "abstract": "Identification of the causative pathogen is required to optimize the effective therapy in infective endocarditis (IE). The aim of this study was to assess a 16S rDNA PCR to identify bacteria from heart valve tissues and to evaluate its usefulness as a complement to blood and removed valves cultures. A total of 266 patients diagnosed with IE from January 2015 to December 2019 were evaluated. Results between 16S rDNA PCR from heart valve tissues were compared with microbiological cultures. Blood cultures were positive in 83.5% of patients diagnosed with IE, while 39.6% and 71.8% of the evaluated heart valve samples were positive by culture and 16S rDNA PCR, respectively. For 32 (12%) patients, 16S rDNA tissue PCR provided valuable information supporting the results of blood cultures in the case of bacteria characteristic from the skin microbiota. Additionally, a microorganism was identified by using 16S rDNA PCR in 36% of blood culture-negative cases. The present study reveals that molecular diagnosis using 16S rDNA tissue PCR provides complementary information for the diagnosis of IE, and it should be recommended in surgical endocarditis, especially when blood cultures are negative.", "journal": "Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["RaquelRodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda", "Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngelesRodr\u00edguez-Esteban", "JonathanFern\u00e1ndez-Su\u00e1rez", "AnaMorilla", "EnriqueGarc\u00eda-Car\u00fas", "MauricioTelenti", "CarlosMorales", "Guillermo Mu\u00f1izAlbaiceta", "JavierFern\u00e1ndez"], "doi": "10.3390/diagnostics11081372\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz620\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00067-7\n10.21037/acs.2019.10.05\n10.1080/00365540701642112\n10.1136/heart.89.3.258\n10.1086/653675\n10.1097/MD.0000000000008392\n10.1086/598618\n10.1128/CMR.00053-19\n10.1097/MD.0b013e31811f44ec\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehp600\n10.1086/313753\n10.1046/j.1365-2672.2003.01839.x\n10.1016/j.jinf.2011.04.010\n10.1186/s12879-016-1476-4\n10.1128/JCM.02173-07\n10.1016/j.kjms.2017.09.011\n10.7861/clinmed.2019-0342\n10.1007/s00392-020-01678-x\n10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00942.x\n10.1128/JCM.43.1.163-167.2005\n10.1016/S0163-4453(97)92662-1\n10.1128/CMR.00033-16\n10.3201/eid2610.191616\n10.1097/00005792-200003000-00005\n10.1097/01.md.0000165658.82869.17\n10.1016/j.hlc.2017.02.009\n10.1097/MD.0000000000011881\n10.1080/23744235.2021.1925342\n10.1371/journal.pone.0175569\n10.2217/fca-2018-0088\n10.3389/fped.2020.575674\n10.1101/2021.01.23.21250364"}
{"title": "Adenine Nucleotide Translocase 1 Expression Modulates the Immune Response in Ischemic Hearts.", "abstract": "Adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1) transfers ATP and ADP over the mitochondrial inner membrane and thus supplies the cell with energy. This study analyzed the role of ANT1 in the immune response of ischemic heart tissue. Ischemic ANT1 overexpressing hearts experienced a shift toward an anti-inflammatory immune response. The shift was characterized by low interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 expression and M1 macrophage infiltration, whereas M2 macrophage infiltration and levels of IL-10, IL-4, and transforming growth factor (TGF\u03b2) were increased. The modulated immune response correlated with high mitochondrial integrity, reduced oxidative stress, low left ventricular end-diastolic heart pressure, and a high survival rate. Isolated ANT1-transgenic (ANT1-TG) cardiomyocytes expressed low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and TGF\u03b2. However, they showed increased expression and cellular release of anti-inflammatory immunomodulators such as vascular endothelial growth factor. The secretome from ANT1-TG cardiomyocytes initiated stress resistance when applied to ischemic wild-type cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. It additionally prevented macrophages from expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, ANT1 expression correlated with genes that are related to cytokine and growth factor pathways in hearts of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, ANT1-TG cardiomyocytes secrete soluble factors that influence ischemic cardiac cells and initiate an anti-inflammatory immune response in ischemic hearts.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["FatihYerg\u00f6z", "JulianFriebel", "NicolleKr\u00e4nkel", "UrsulaRauch-Kroehnert", "Heinz-PeterSchultheiss", "UlfLandmesser", "AndreaD\u00f6rner"], "doi": "10.3390/cells10082130\n10.7759/cureus.9349\n10.1186/s12929-017-0322-3\n10.1038/s41467-019-13668-3\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01605\n10.1042/BJ20050890\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.025\n10.3390/cells9122686\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2017.05.005\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6165-11.2012\n10.1016/S0005-2736(98)00245-4\n10.1002/ana.10214\n10.1093/hmg/ddi341\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.643296\n10.1113/expphysiol.2008.044800\n10.1007/s00109-016-1413-4\n10.3390/cells8121588\n10.1002/9780470754030.ch15\n10.1002/jcp.28513\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.11.002\n10.1074/jbc.M603783200\n10.1093/nar/gky1131\n10.1093/nar/gkz1031\n10.1139/y89-114\n10.1006/bbrc.1995.2228\n10.1038/s41598-017-07328-z\n10.1007/s00395-017-0622-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00330.2014\n10.1038/srep44708\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2006.07.006\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.04.013\n10.1007/s11010-015-2622-9\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.061191\n10.1007/s12265-020-10000-z\n10.1159/000325214\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.12.315\n10.1038/ng0797-226\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.198721\n10.3390/ijms19124058\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2017.05.004\n10.1084/jem.20150900\n10.1128/MCB.26.6.2215-2225.2006"}

CMs from human iPSCs (hiPSC-CMs) are genetically identical to patient primary cells of origin, with the main electrophysiological and mechanical features of CMs. The key issue to be solved is to achieve a degree of structural and functional maturity typical of adult CMs. In this perspective, we will focus on the main differences between fetal-like hiPSC-CMs and adult CMs. A viewpoint is given on the different approaches used to improve hiPSC-CMs maturity, spanning from long-term culture to complex engineered heart tissue.

{"title": "Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of cardiac toxicity induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF and MEK inhibitors.", "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAFi/MEKi) have drastically improved the outcome of melanoma patients. ICIs can induce myocarditis, a rare immune related adverse event (irAE) with an estimated lethality of 50%. BRAFi/MEKi may induce left ventricular ejection fraction decrease, hypertension or QT interval prolongation. While the BRAFi/MEKi induced cardiotoxicity is often reversible upon treatment discontinuation or dose adaptation and symptomatic therapy is often sufficient to restore cardiac function, the treatment of ICI-induced myocarditis mainly relies on high dose corticosteroids. There is no established therapy for steroid resistant myocarditis, yet various drugs have been reported to improve outcome. Shared epitopes between melanoma cells and cardiac tissue are thought to underlie the development of ICIs induced myocarditis. The mechanism of BRAFi/MEKi induced cardiotoxicity appears to be related to the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in cardiomyocyte repair, survival and proliferation. With the emerging application of ICI-BRAFi/MEKi combinations, so called triplet therapies, differentiating between these two types of cardiotoxicity will become important for appropriate patient management.

The DOX was conjugated with 1, 2-Dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamin (DPPE) and folic acid using Di-cyclohexyl-carbodiimide, confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and proton NMR. DPPE-FA-DOX micelles were prepared using thin film method and evaluated for zeta potential, particle size, surface morphology, in- vitro drug release study etc. In-vitro anticancer activity and apoptosis assay was evaluated in breast cancer (MCF-7) cells using MTT assay and flow cytometer respectively. In-vivo biodistribution and toxicity assessment were evaluated in rats whereas antitumor activity in tumor bearing BALB/c mice. Prepared micelles were spherical with size and zeta potential of 295.6\u00a0+\u00a084.4\u00a0nm and 0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0mV respectively. Apoptosis assay for DPPE-FA-DOX micelles treated cells using Annexin V/PI staining demonstrated 56.2% apoptotic cells. Remarkably, DPPE-FA-DOX micelles improved DOX bioavailability by 7 fold and diminished plasma elimination with no sign of tissue toxicity compared to free DOX. In-vivo biodistribution studies revealed that micelles facilitated higher accumulation of DOX in tumor than free DOX. DPPE-FA-DOX micelles treated mice survived for 62\u00a0days than Free DOX (40\u00a0days), revealed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. Histopathological examination of liver, kidney and heart tissues of micelles treated rat's corroborated reduced systemic toxicity than free DOX.

Cell-type-specific approaches are necessary for defining the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac development, homeostasis, and pathology. While single-cell RNA-seq studies are beginning to define the chamber-specific cellular composition of the heart, our views of the proteome are more limited because most proteomics studies have utilized homogenized human cardiac tissue. To promote future cell-type specific analyses of the human heart, we describe the first method for cardiomyocyte isolation from cryopreserved human cardiac tissue followed by flow cytometry for purity assessment. We also describe a facile method for preparing isolated cardiomyocytes and whole cardiac tissue homogenate for bottom-up proteomic analyses. Prior experience in dissociating cardiac tissue or proteomics is not required to execute these methods. We compare different sample preparation workflows and analysis methods to demonstrate how these can impact the depth of proteome coverage achieved.

In this study, RNA-sequencing and its-related bioinformatics was used as the basic strategy to clarify the characteristic mechanisms of kidney-heart axis remodeling and dysfunction in diabetic male rats under BPA exposure. We found that continuous BPA exposure in diabetic rats aggravated renal impairment, and caused hemodynamic disorders and dysfunctions. There were 655 and 125 differentially expressed genes in the kidney and heart, respectively. For the kidneys, functional annotation and enrichment, and gene set enrichment analyses identified bile acid secretion related to lipid synthesis and transport, and MAPK cascade pathways. For the heart, these bioinformatics analyses clearly pointed to MAPKs pathways. A total of 12 genes and another total of 6 genes were identified from the kidney tissue and heart tissue, respectively. Western blotting showed that exposure to BPA activated MAPK cascades in both organs. In this study, the exacerbated remodeling of diabetic kidney-heart axis under BPA exposure and diabetes might occur through hemodynamics, metabolism disorders, and the immune-inflammatory response, as well as continuous estrogen-like stimulation, with focus on the MAPK cascades.", "journal": "Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)", "date": "2021-08-27", "authors": ["BinWu", "QiangqiangZhao", "ZuonengLi", "ZhitengMin", "MengdieShi", "XinminNie", "QingnanHe", "RongGui"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117671"}

We aimed to find out the association between three iron-related miRNAs \"miR-let-7d, miR-122, and miR-200b\" and excess iron in tissues, in transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia major patients. Circulating miRNA expressions are measured in peripheral blood (PB) samples using qPCR of transfusion-dependent (TDT) \u03b2-thalassemia patients (n\u2009=\u2009140) and normalized to non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) \u03b2-thalassemia (n\u2009=\u200945). Results revealed that plasma expression levels of miR-let-7d and miR-200b were significantly downregulated in TDT patients; however, miR-122 was upregulated. In terms of tissue iron load, aberrant expression of miRNAs was significantly associated with increased-iron accumulation in hepatic and cardiac tissues. We concluded that circulating miRNAs are strong candidates that associate iron hemostasis in transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia major patients.

{"title": "Quality control in scRNA-Seq can discriminate pacemaker cells: the mtRNA bias.", "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high-resolution insights into complex tissues. Cardiac tissue, however, poses a major challenge due to the delicate isolation process and the large size of mature cardiomyocytes. Regardless of the experimental technique, captured cells are often impaired and some capture sites may contain multiple or no cells at all. All this refers to \"low quality\" potentially leading to data misinterpretation. Common standard quality control parameters involve the number of detected genes, transcripts per cell, and the fraction of transcripts from mitochondrial genes. While cutoffs for transcripts and genes per cell are usually user-defined for each experiment or individually calculated, a fixed threshold of 5% mitochondrial transcripts is standard and often set as default in scRNA-seq software. However, this parameter is highly dependent on the tissue type. In the heart, mitochondrial transcripts comprise almost 30% of total mRNA due to high energy demands. Here, we demonstrate that a 5%-threshold not only causes an unacceptable exclusion of cardiomyocytes but also introduces a bias that particularly discriminates pacemaker cells. This effect is apparent for our in vitro generated induced-sinoatrial-bodies (iSABs; highly enriched physiologically functional pacemaker cells), and also evident in a public data set of cells isolated from embryonal murine sinoatrial node tissue (Goodyer William et al. in Circ Res 125:379-397, 2019).

Although natural extracellular matrixes may provide good supporting for seeding cells in vitro, it is evitable to destroy biophysical cues during decellularization. Reconstructing the bioactivities of extracellular matrix-based scaffolds is essential for their usage in tissue repair.\nIn the study, a hybrid hydrogel was developed by incorporating single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) into heart-derived extracellular matrixes. Interestingly, insoluble SWCNTs were well dispersed in hybrid hydrogel solution via the interaction with extracellular matrix proteins. Importantly, an augmented integrin-dependent niche was reconstructed in the hybrid hydrogel, which could work like biophysical cues to activate integrin-related pathway of seeding cells. As supporting scaffolds in vitro, the hybrid hydrogels were observed to significantly promote seeding cell adhesion, differentiation, as well as structural and functional development towards mature cardiac tissues. As injectable carrier scaffolds in vivo, the hybrid hydrogels were then used to delivery stem cells for myocardial repair in rats.

Currently, no specific drugs and vaccines are available, and a safe and effective CVB5 vaccine is of great value for control of the diseases. In this study, CVB5 P1 precursor and 3CD protease were co-expressed in Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus expression system. The P1 was processed by 3CD and self-assembled into CVB5 virus-like particles (VLPs). VP1 and VP3 capsid proteins of CVB5 could be detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the CVB5 VLPs were spherical particles with a diameter of about 30\u00a0nm, mimicking wild-type CVB5 virus. Our study showed that the total IgG and neutralizing antibodies induced by CVB5 VLPs were higher than those induced by inactivated vaccine. More importantly, the CVB5 VLPs conferred full protection to the CVB5-challenged suckling mice via passive immunity while protection efficiency of the inactivated vaccine was only 80%. The CVB5 VLPs vaccine could protect the limb muscles, brain, and heart tissues of suckling mice from CVB5-induced damage.

The changes of methylation levels can further lead to alterations of gene expression, and influence the risk of various complex human diseases. Detecting mQTLs may provide insights into the underlying mechanism of how genotypic variations may influence the disease risk. In this article, we propose a methylation random field (MRF) method to detect mQTLs by testing the association between the methylation level of a CpG site and a set of genetic variants within a genomic region. The proposed MRF has two major advantages over existing approaches. First, it uses a beta distribution to characterize the bimodal and interval properties of the methylation trait at a CpG site. Second, it considers multiple common and rare genetic variants within a genomic region to identify mQTLs. Through simulations, we demonstrated that the MRF had improved power over other existing methods in detecting rare variants of relatively large effect, especially when the sample size is small. We further applied our method to a study of congenital heart defects with 83 cardiac tissue samples and identified two mQTL regions, MRPS10 and PSORS1C1, which were colocalized with expression QTL in cardiac tissue. In conclusion, the proposed MRF is a useful tool to identify novel mQTLs, especially for studies with limited sample sizes.", "journal": "Briefings in bioinformatics", "date": "2021-08-21", "authors": ["ChenLyu", "ManyanHuang", "NianjunLiu", "ZhongxueChen", "Philip JLupo", "BenjaminTycko", "John SWitte", "Charlotte AHobbs", "MingLi"], "doi": "10.1093/bib/bbab323"}

We have investigated the possibility of surface functionalization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets by the combination of laser ablation with hot embossing and the application of such techniques in the field of stem cell research. We investigated the response of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to topography in the low micrometer range. HiPSC-CMs are expected to offer new therapeutic tools for myocardial replacement or regeneration after an infarct or other causes of cardiac tissue loss. However, hiPSC-CMs are phenotypically immature compared to myocytes in the adult myocardium, hampering their clinical application. We aimed to develop and test a high-throughput technique for surface structuring that would improve hiPSC-CMs structural maturation. We used laser ablation with a ps-laser source in combination with nanoimprint lithography to fabricate large areas of homogeneous micron- to submicron line-like pattern with a spatial period of 3 \u00b5m on the PET surface. We evaluated cell morphology, alignment, sarcomeric myofibrils assembly, and calcium transients to evaluate phenotypic changes associated with culturing hiPSC-CMs on functionalized PET. Surface functionalization through hot embossing was able to generate, at low cost, low micrometer features on the PET surface that influenced the hiPSC-CMs phenotype, suggesting improved structural and functional maturation.

Here, we show that Nup50, which is localized in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes, selectively induces an increase in the transcription and translation of Kcna4. The Kcna4 gene encodes a K+ voltage-gated channel of shaker-related subfamily member 4 and is essential for regulating the action potential in cardiac membranes. Using immunofluorescence imaging, luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we identified that the direct binding of the FG-repeat domain within Nup50 to the proximity of the Kcna4 promoter was required to activate the transcription and subsequent translation of Kcna4. Functionally, Nup50 overexpression increased the currents of KCNA4-encoded Ito,s channels, and reverse knockdown of Nup50 resulted in a remarkable decrease in the amplitude of Ito,s currents in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, a positive correlation between Nup50 and Kcna4 mRNA and protein expression was observed in heart tissues subjected to ischemic insults.

Color Doppler ultrasound was performed to detect left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted to observe the pathological changes of mouse myocardium. The RT-qPCR analysis was performed to detect miR-590-5p and RTN4 expression levels. Western blot was conducted to detect protein levels of the indicated genes. We found that the expression of miR-590-5p was downregulated in cardiac tissues of HF mice. Injection of AAV-miR-590-5p attenuated myocardium hypertrophy and myocyte apoptosis. Additionally, miR-590-5p overexpression promoted viability, inhibited apoptosis, and decreased ANF, BNP and beta-MHC protein levels in H9c2 cell. Mechanistically, miR-590-5p binds to RTN4 3'-untranslated region, as predicted by starBase online database and evidenced by luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, miR-590-5p negatively regulates RTN4 mRNA expression and suppresses its translation.

{"title": "Thyroid hormones and the potential for regulating glucose metabolism in cardiomyocytes during insulin resistance and T2DM.", "abstract": "In order for the heart to maintain its continuous mechanical work and provide the systolic movement to uphold coronary blood flow, substantial synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is required. Under normal conditions cardiac tissue utilizes roughly 70% fatty acids (FA), and 30% glucose for the production of ATP; however, during impaired metabolic conditions like insulin resistance and diabetes glucose metabolism is dysregulated and FA account for 99% of energy production. One of the major consequences of a shift in FA metabolism in cardiac tissue is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipotoxicity, which ultimately lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Thyroid hormones (TH) have direct effects on cardiac function and glucose metabolism during impaired metabolic conditions suggesting that TH may improve glucose metabolism in an insulin resistant condition. None-classical TH signaling in the heart has shown to phosphorylate protein kinase B (Akt) and increase activity of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), which are critical mediators in the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake pathway. Studies on peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipocytes have demonstrated TH treatment improved glucose intolerance in a diabetic model and increased insulin-regulated glucose transporter (GLUT4) mRNA levels. GLUT4 is a downstream target of thyroid response element (TRE), which demonstrates that THs regulate glucose via GLUT4. Elevated 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) increased glucose oxidation rate and decreased the glycolytic intermediate, fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) in cardiomyocytes, in addition to increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and pyruvate transport across the mitochondrial membrane. These findings along with a few other studies on T3 treatment in cardiac tissue suggest TH may improve glucose metabolism in an insulin resistant model and ameliorate the effects of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

Cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were well spreaded. The cardiomyocytes were connected with a gap junction channel in bio-printed cMesh and a 3D cardiac patch with an aggregated structure. Porous cMesh demonstrated structural advantages by increased phosphorylation of mTOR, AKT, and ERK signals associated with cell survival.

{"title": "Cardiomyocytes recruit monocytes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection by secreting CCL2.", "abstract": "Heart injury has been reported in up to 20% of COVID-19 patients, yet the cause of myocardial histopathology remains unknown. Here, using an established in\u00a0vivo hamster model, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in cardiomyocytes of infected animals. Furthermore, we found damaged cardiomyocytes in hamsters and COVID-19 autopsy samples. To explore the mechanism, we show that both human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-derived CMs) and adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) can be productively infected by SARS-CoV-2, leading to secretion of the monocyte chemoattractant cytokine CCL2 and subsequent monocyte recruitment. Increased CCL2 expression and monocyte infiltration was also observed in the hearts of infected hamsters. Although infected CMs suffer damage, we find that the presence of macrophages significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2-infected CMs. Overall, our study provides direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects CMs in\u00a0vivo and suggests a mechanism of immune cell infiltration and histopathology in heart tissues of COVID-19 patients.", "journal": "Stem cell reports", "date": "2021-08-18", "authors": ["LiuliuYang", "Benjamin ENilsson-Payant", "YulingHan", "FabriceJaffr\u00e9", "JiajunZhu", "PengfeiWang", "TuoZhang", "DavidRedmond", "SeanHoughton", "RasmusM\u00f8ller", "DaisyHoagland", "LuciaCarrau", "ShuHoriuchi", "MarisaGoff", "Jean KLim", "YaronBram", "ChanelRichardson", "VasurethaChandar", "AlainBorczuk", "YaoxingHuang", "JennyXiang", "David DHo", "Robert ESchwartz", "Benjamin RtenOever", "ToddEvans", "ShuibingChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.07.012\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa267\n10.1007/s12272-013-0161-z\n10.3390/biomedicines8120626\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.05.003\n10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30257-1\n10.1002/ehf2.12805\n10.1038/nri3671\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31307-6\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017\n10.1038/s41586-020-2901-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1096\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.027\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.3551\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.02.008\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31094-1\n10.1007/s00134-020-05991-x\n10.1073/pnas.2003138117\n10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100052\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950\n10.1002/ejhf.1828\n10.1093/cvr/cvz148\n10.1038/s41467-018-07242-6\n10.1001/jama.2020.1585\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.06.015\n10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200312-00193\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.11.003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3"}

FoxM1 (Forkhead Box M1), expressed in proliferating cardiac progenitor cells, could regulate myocardial development. However, the role of FoxM1 in I/R-induced myocardial injury has not been reported yet.\nRats were conducted with regional ischemia followed by reperfusion in myocardium through ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride staining was utilized to assess the infarct size. ELISA was performed to detect activities of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Protein expression of FoxM1 in heart tissues and H9c2 were determined by western blot. H9c2 cells were used to establish a hypoxia/reoxygenation cell model, and the cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT, EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) staining and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining, respectively. Adenovirus (Ad)-mediated over-expression of FoxM1 was injected into the anterior wall of the left ventricle of rats to evaluate the role of FoxM1 on in vivo I/R-induced myocardial injury.\nFoxM1 was reduced in heart tissues isolated from rats post myocardial I/R injury. Forced FoxM1 expression increased cell viability and proliferation of hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced H9c2, while repressed the cell apoptosis with increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Injection of Ad-FoxM1 suppressed infarct size of the heart and decreased activities of CK-MB and LDH.\nFoxM1 attenuated I/R-induced myocardial injury, providing potential therapeutic target for the disease.", "journal": "Acta biochimica Polonica", "date": "2021-08-18", "authors": ["GangZhang", "KunYu", "ZhiBao", "XiaofengSun", "DongyingZhang"], "doi": "10.18388/abp.2020_5536"}

In this study, rats were randomly divided into the following eleven groups: control (Cont.), and diabetic (D), as well as 9 groups that were treated with metformin (M, 300 mg/kg) or aspirin (ASA, 120 mg/kg) alone or in different combinations with captopril (C, 50 mg/kg), or atorvastatin (AT, 40 mg/kg), as follows: (D + M), (D + ASA), (D + M + ASA), (D + M + C), (D + M + AT), (D + M + C + ASA), (D + M + C + AT), (D + M + AT + ASA), and (D + M + C + AT + ASA). The rats in treatment groups daily received drugs by gavage for six weeks. Finally, serum lipid profile and levels of oxidative markers in the heart and kidney tissues were evaluated. In diabetic rats, blood levels of glucose, cholesterol, TG (triglyceride), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), MDA (malondialdehyde) and AIP (atherogenic index of plasma) significantly increased but those of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and total thiol as well as SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) activities significantly decreased. Treatment with different combinations of C, ASA, AT and M significantly ameliorated these parameters.

Angiotensin II, the main peptide responsible for the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System, has been closely linked to cardiac remodeling, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and hypertension, and some of these effects are induced by inflammatory mediators. Resolvin-D1 (RvD1) elicits potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects in various pathological models. In this study, we aimed to examine whether RvD1 ameliorates cardiac remodeling and hypertension triggered by angiotensin II.\nAlzet\u00ae osmotic mini-pumps filled with angiotensin II (1.5\u00a0mg/kg/day) were implanted in male C57BL/6\u00a0J mice for 7 or 14\u00a0days. RvD1 (3\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day, i.p) was administered one day after the surgery and during the complete infusion period. Blood pressure and myocardial functional parameters were assessed by echocardiography. At the end of the experimental procedure, blood and heart tissue were harvested, and plasma and histological parameters were studied. After 7 and 14\u00a0days, RvD1 reduced the increase of neutrophil and macrophage infiltration triggered by angiotensin II, and also reduced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression levels. RvD1 also reduced cytokine plasma levels (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, KC, MCP-1), cardiac hypertrophy, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, and hypertension.\nThis study unveils novel cardioprotective effects of RvD1 in angiotensin II-induced hypertension and cardiac remodeling by attenuating inflammation and provides insights into a potential clinical application.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

CS may be clinically suspected by the presence of ventricular arrhythmia, conduction abnormalities, and heart failure (HF). However, 20%-25% of patients may present with silent CS, having asymptomatic cardiac involvement. The diagnosis of CS is based on findings from nuclear studies, cardiac magnetic resonance, and extra-cardiac tissue biopsy. Due to the inflammatory nature of the disease, immunosuppressive medications are a cornerstone of therapy. The treatment also includes recommended HF medical therapies. Since CS patients are at risk of sudden cardiac death resulting from progression of cardiac dysfunction or the presence of scar originating from fatal arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators should be considered, with special indication beyond accepted recommendations in HF. In CS, the extent of left ventricular dysfunction is the most important mortality predictor.

We evaluated clinical, microbiologic and postmortem histopathologic findings in childhood deaths in whom severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified antemortem or postmortem.\nSurveillance of childhood deaths was ongoing during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa from April 14, 2020, to August 31, 2020. All children hospitalized during this time had a SARS-CoV-2 test done as part of standard of care. Postmortem sampling included minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) of lung, liver and heart tissue; blood and lung samples for bacterial culture and molecular detection of viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and bacteria. The cause of death attribution was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team and reported using World Health Organization framework for cause of death attribution.\nSARS-CoV-2 was identified on antemortem and/or postmortem sampling in 11.7% (20/171) of deceased children, including 13.2% (12/91) in whom MITS was done. Eighteen (90%) of 20 deaths with SARS-CoV-2 infection were <12 months age. COVID-19 was attributed in the causal pathway to death in 91.7% (11/12) and 87.5% (7/8) cases with and without MITS, respectively. Lung histopathologic features in COVID-19-related deaths included diffuse alveolar damage (n = 6, 54.5%), type 2 pneumocyte proliferation (n = 6, 54.5%) and hyaline membrane formation (n = 5, 36.4%). Culture-confirmed invasive bacterial disease was evident in 54.5% (6/11) of COVID-19 attributed deaths investigated with MITS.\nCOVID-19 was in the causal pathway of 10.5% (18/171) of all childhood deaths under surveillance.

{"title": "8-Gingerol Ameliorates Myocardial Fibrosis by Attenuating Reactive Oxygen Species, Apoptosis, and Autophagy ", "abstract": "8-gingerol (8-Gin) is the series of phenolic substance that is extracted from ginger. Although many studies have revealed that 8-Gin has multiple pharmacological properties, the possible underlying mechanisms of 8-Gin against myocardial fibrosis (MF) remains unclear. The study examined the exact role and potential mechanisms of 8-Gin against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MF. Male mice were intraperitoneally injected with 8-Gin (10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg/d) and concurrently subcutaneously injected with ISO (10\u00a0mg/kg/d) for 2\u00a0weeks. Electrocardiography, pathological heart morphology, myocardial enzymes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, degree of apoptosis, and autophagy pathway-related proteins were measured. Our study observed 8-Gin significantly reduced J-point elevation and heart rate. Besides, 8-Gin caused a marked decrease in cardiac weight index and left ventricle weight index, serum levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (CK and LDH, respectively), ROS generation, and attenuated ISO-induced pathological heart damage. Moreover, treatment with 8-Gin resulted in a marked decrease in the levels of collagen types I and III and TGF-\u03b2 in the heart tissue. Our results showed 8-Gin exposure significantly suppressed ISO-induced autophagosome formation. 8-Gin also could lead to down-regulation of the activities of matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9), Caspase-9, and Bax protein, up-regulation of the activity of Bcl-2 protein, and alleviation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, 8-Gin produced an obvious increase in the expressions of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins. Our data showed that 8-Gin exerted cardioprotective effects on ISO-induced MF, which possibly occurred in connection with inhibition of ROS generation, apoptosis, and autophagy ", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2021-08-17", "authors": ["YucongXue", "MuqingZhang", "MiaomiaoLiu", "YuLiu", "LiLi", "XueHan", "ZhenqingSun", "LiChu"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2021.711701\n10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_322_16\n10.5935/abc.20190045\n10.18632/oncotarget.18082\n10.3390/ijms21249739\n10.1007/s10529-020-02818-z\n10.1093/cvr/cvs275\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106548\n10.4161/auto.5.1.7276\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31821823d9\n10.1016/j.jep.2009.10.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030450\n10.3389/fphar.2013.00177\n10.1038/cdd.2014.150\n10.1023/a:1015913229650\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303788\n10.4161/auto.24273\n10.1002/mnfr.202000003\n10.1007/s12551-020-00738-w\n10.1016/j.phrs.2015.08.005\n10.1007/s00253-016-7930-9\n10.1039/c7mb00246g\n10.1155/2019/1243215\n10.1172/JCI94753\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2006.02336.x\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0023\n10.1016/j.amjhyper.2004.02.004\n10.1016/j.matbio.2018.01.013\n10.1139/cjpp-2012-0432\n10.1177/0300060513488514\n10.3892/ijmm.2018.3794\n10.1155/2018/6215916\n10.3390/molecules16032636\n10.1016/j.intimp.2017.12.019\n10.3390/foods8060185\n10.2174/1389202920666190820142043\n10.1093/cvr/17.1.15\n10.1016/j.phrs.2009.12.005\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.09.030\n10.1002/ejhf.1421\n10.1007/s13205-019-1677-9\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.06.083\n10.1155/2017/3920195\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101212\n10.1002/jcb.20912\n10.1016/j.vph.2008.10.004\n10.1038/s41598-019-53419-4\n10.1002/stem.2005\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000098178.36890.81\n10.1007/s11130-008-0105-9\n10.1039/c8fo01663a\n10.1016/j.phymed.2018.11.024\n10.1155/2019/3714508\n10.3748/wjg.v26.i39.5997\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.158\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105279\n10.3892/ijmm.2017.3354\n10.1016/S0165-6147(03)00163-9\n10.1002/ptr.5871\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00122\n10.1186/s13287-017-0543-0\n10.1248/bpb.b19-00050\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00128\n10.1016/j.phymed.2019.152929\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2934"}

{"title": "EHP-101 alleviates angiotensin II-induced fibrosis and inflammation in mice.", "abstract": "Some cannabinoids showed anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic activities. EHP-101 is an oral lipidic formulation of the novel non-psychotropic cannabidiol aminoquinone VCE-004.8, which showed antifibrotic activity in murine models of systemic sclerosis induced by bleomycin. We herein examined the effect of EHP-101 on cardiac and other organ fibrosis in a mouse model induced by Angiotensin II. VCE-004.8 inhibited TGF\u03b2- and Ang II-induced myofibroblast differentiation in cardiac fibroblasts detected by \u03b1-SMA expression. VCE-004.8 also inhibited Ang II-induced ERK 1\u00a0+\u00a02 phosphorylation, NFAT activation and mRNA expression of IL1\u03b2, IL6, Col1A2 and CCL2 in cardiac fibroblasts. Mice infused with Ang II resulted in collagen accumulation in left ventricle, aortic, dermal, renal and pulmonary tissues; oral administration of EHP-101, Ajulemic acid and Losartan improved these phenotypes. In myocardial tissue, Ang II induced infiltration of T cells and macrophages together with the accumulation of collagen and Tenascin C; those were all reduced by either EHP-101 or Losartan treatment. Cardiac tissue RNA-Seq analyses revealed a similar transcriptomic signature for both treatments for inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. However, the gene set enrichment analysis comparing data from EHP-101 vs Losartan showed specific hallmarks modified only by EHP-101. Specifically, EHP-101 inhibited the expression of genes such as CDK1, TOP2A and MKi67 that are regulated to the E2 factor family of transcription factors. This study suggests that the oral administration of EHP-101 prevents and inhibits cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, EHP-101 inhibits renal, pulmonary and dermal fibrosis. EHP-101 could offer new opportunities in the treatment of cardiac fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2021-08-14", "authors": ["AdelaGarc\u00eda-Mart\u00edn", "CarmenNavarrete", "MartinGarrido-Rodr\u00edguez", "Mar\u00eda EPrados", "DiegoCaprioglio", "GiovanniAppendino", "EduardoMu\u00f1oz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112007"}

However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects remain unclear. In this study, a mouse model of heart failure established by non-thoracic, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was developed to determine the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic effects of Hirsutella sinensis fungus (HSF) powder. The results showed that HSF treatment remarkably ameliorated myocardial hypertrophy, collagen fiber hyperplasia, and cardiac function in mice with heart failure. Using transcriptional and epigenetic analyses, we found that the mechanism of HSF mainly involved a variety of signaling pathways related to myocardial fibrosis and determined that HSF could reduce the levels of TGF-\u03b21 proteins in heart tissue, as well as type I and III collagen levels.

{"title": "Impaired Cx43 gap junction endocytosis causes morphological and functional defects in zebrafish.", "abstract": "Gap junctions mediate direct cell-to-cell communication by forming channels that physically couple cells, thereby linking their cytoplasm, permitting the exchange of molecules, ions, and electrical impulses. Gap junctions are assembled from connexin (Cx) proteins, with connexin 43 (Cx43) being the most ubiquitously expressed and best studied. While the molecular events that dictate the Cx43 life cycle have largely been characterized, the unusually short half-life of Cxs of only 1-5 h, resulting in constant endocytosis and biosynthetic replacement of gap junction channels, has remained puzzling. The Cx43 C-terminal (CT) domain serves as the regulatory hub of the protein affecting all aspects of gap junction function. Here, deletion within the Cx43 CT (amino acids 256-289), a region known to encode key residues regulating gap junction turnover, is employed to examine the effects of dysregulated Cx43 gap junction endocytosis using cultured cells (Cx43", "journal": "Molecular biology of the cell", "date": "2021-08-12", "authors": ["CaitlinHyland", "MichaelMfarej", "GiorgosHiotis", "SabrinaLancaster", "NoelleNovak", "M KathrynIovine", "Matthias MFalk"], "doi": "10.1091/mbc.E20-12-0797"}

However, the incidence of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (CIC) has been rising continuously, threatening their long-term survival. The integration of nanotechnology and biomedicine has brought about an unprecedented technological revolution and has promoted the progress of anti-tumour therapy. In this review, we summarised the possible mechanisms of CIC, evaluated the role of nanoparticles (including liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, and hydrogels) as drug carriers in preventing cardiotoxicity and proposed five advantages of nanotechnology in reducing cardiotoxicity: Liposomes cannot easily penetrate the heart's endothelial barrier; optimized delivery strategies reduce distribution in important organs, such as the heart; targeting the tumour microenvironment and niche; stimulus-responsive polymer nano-drug carriers rapidly iterate; better economic benefits were obtained. Nanoparticles can effectively deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to tumour tissues, while reducing the toxicity to heart tissues, and break through the dilemma of existing chemotherapy to a certain extent. It is important to explore the interactions between the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and optimize the highly specific tumour targeting strategy in the future.", "journal": "Seminars in cancer biology", "date": "2021-08-11", "authors": ["XinSu", "XiaoyuZhang", "WenjingLiu", "XinyuYang", "NaAn", "FanYang", "JiahaoSun", "YanweiXing", "HongcaiShang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.08.003"}
{"title": "Genome-wide methylation analysis reveals differentially methylated CpG sites and altered expression of heart development-associated genes in fetuses with cardiac defects.", "abstract": "DNA methylation, as an epigenetic mechanism, has a vital role in heart development. An increasing number of studies have investigated aberrant DNA methylation in pediatric or adult heart samples from patients with congenital heart defects (CHD). Placenta tissue, umbilical cord blood, or newborn blood have also been used to detect DNA methylation biomarkers for CHD. However, few studies have compared the methylation levels in fetal heart tissue with cardiac defects with that in normal controls. The present study conducted an integrative whole-genome and CpG site-specific DNA methylation analysis of fetal heart samples from 17 isolated cardiac defect cases, 14 non-isolated cardiac defect cases, and 22 controls with normal hearts, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation microarray and MassARRAY EpiTYPER assays. Expression of genes adjacent to differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The results revealed that fetuses with cardiac defects presented global hypomethylation. Genomic analysis of DMRs revealed that a proportion of DMRs were located in exons (12.4%), distal intergenic regions (11.14%), and introns (8.97%). Only 55.7% of DMRs were observed at promoter regions. Functional enrichment analysis for genes adjacent to these DMRs revealed that hypomethylated genes were involved in embryonic heart tube morphogenesis and immune-related regulation functions. Intergenic hypermethylation of EGFR and solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1), and intragenic hypomethylation of NOTCH1 were validated in fetal heart tissues with cardiac defects. Only SLC19A1 expression was significantly decreased at the mRNA level, while EGFR, NOTCH1, and SLC19A1 expression were all significantly decreased at the protein level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that fetal cardiac defects may be associated with alterations in regional and single CpG site methylation outside of promoter regions, resulting in differentiated expression of corresponding genes associated with heart development.

Upon entering the blood circulation system, these particles have the potency to induce cardiomyocytes, leading to cardiac failure or myocardial ischemia, and the molecular mechanism remains to be completely clarified. In this study, the cardiac toxicity of rats orally exposed to hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAPNPs) has been observed through an increase in myocardial infarction serum markers including CK-MB and alterations in routine blood factors, expression of apoptosis-related protein P53, and increased levels of serum inflammatory markers represented by the tumor necrosis factor alpha and Interleukin-6, as well as a decline in heart antioxidant enzymes and reduced glutathione level, while an induction in lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide has been observed, as well as notable histological and histochemical alterations in the heart of these animals. mRNA and protein expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were elevated in the myocardium. However, the coadministration of chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) and/or curcumin nanoparticles (CurNPs) successfully modulated these alterations and induced activation in antioxidant parameters. The present data suggest that HAPNPs-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway may play a crucial role in cardiac tissue damage and the early treatment with CsNPs and CurNPs may protect the heart from infarction induced by HAPNPs toxic effect.", "journal": "International journal of biomaterials", "date": "2021-08-11", "authors": ["Israa FMosa", "Haitham HAbd", "AbdelsalamAbuzreda", "Amenh BYousif", "NadhomAssaf"], "doi": "10.1155/2021/3394348\n10.1016/j.cis.2016.03.006\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.12.008\n10.4161/biom.22347\n10.1016/j.addr.2011.12.006\n10.1038/ncpcardio1399\n10.1186/1476-069x-12-43\n10.2174/1381612821666150803151758\n10.1172/jci200524408\n10.1166/jbns.2018.1524\n10.1039/c9tx00221a\n10.1093/toxres/tfaa054\n10.1007/bf02685940\n10.1016/j.cbi.2012.05.011\n10.1016/j.nano.2007.03.001\n10.1002/smll.200700595\n10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00089-9\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.01.008\n10.1016/j.tiv.2009.01.005\n10.2147/ijn.s76114\n10.1155/2015/864946\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.08.013\n10.1007/s12012-013-9198-y\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2009.03.020\n10.1126/science.1114397\n10.1161/01.cir.0000055318.09997.1f\n10.1016/j.carpath.2006.04.006\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.10.012\n10.1097/01.asn.0000088027.54400.c6\n10.1186/s12989-016-0132-x\n10.1111/jcmm.12582\n10.1155/2019/7847142\n10.4103/1947-2714.103310\n10.1038/nm0603-653\n10.1007/3-7643-7311-3_15\n10.3390/ijms21155294\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2014.03.034\n10.1007/978-94-007-6467-5_2\n10.1016/s1471-4914(02)00011-4\n10.3892/ijo.24.4.853\n10.1093/carcin/bgi097\n10.1016/s0140-6736(96)07424-7\n10.1056/nejmoa0905633\n10.1530/acta.0.1250694\n10.1002/jctb.280310105\n10.3892/etm.2019.8108\n10.1021/jf001442x\n10.1080/01480545.2018.1504058\n10.1002/jbt.22030\n10.1007/978-0-387-46401-5_3\n10.1089/ars.2005.7.32\n10.1016/0003-9861(59)90259-0\n10.1039/an9618600748\n10.1159/000136485\n10.1136/jcp.54.5.356\n10.1016/s0021-9258(19)45228-9\n10.1016/0005-2744(76)90110-8\n10.1016/s0021-9258(19)42083-8\n10.1016/s1479-666x(09)80042-5"}
{"title": "Polymeric Biomaterials for the Treatment of Cardiac Post-Infarction Injuries.", "abstract": "Cardiac regeneration aims to reconstruct the heart contractile mass, preventing the organ from a progressive functional deterioration, by delivering pro-regenerative cells, drugs, or growth factors to the site of injury. In recent years, scientific research focused the attention on tissue engineering for the regeneration of cardiac infarct tissue, and biomaterials able to anatomically and physiologically adapt to the heart muscle have been proposed as valuable tools for this purpose, providing the cells with the stimuli necessary to initiate a complete regenerative process. An ideal biomaterial for cardiac tissue regeneration should have a positive influence on the biomechanical, biochemical, and biological properties of tissues and cells; perfectly reflect the morphology and functionality of the native myocardium; and be mechanically stable, with a suitable thickness. Among others, engineered hydrogels, three-dimensional polymeric systems made from synthetic and natural biomaterials, have attracted much interest for cardiac post-infarction therapy. In addition, biocompatible nanosystems, and polymeric nanoparticles in particular, have been explored in preclinical studies as drug delivery and tissue engineering platforms for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Jumonji domain containing 5 (JMJD5) is responsible for the embryonic development through removing methyl moieties from H3K36me2 histone, and has pro-proliferative effect on heart and eye development. However, the protective role of JMJD5 against oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced injury in cardiomyocytes has not been fully understood. Firstly, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat model was established by ligation of left coronary artery. OGD/R was performed in non-transfected H9C2 or H9C2 transfected with pcDNA-JMJD5 plasmid to induce cell cytotoxicity. Data from qRT-PCR and western blot showed that JMJD5 was reduced in the heart tissues of myocardial I/R rat model and OGD/R-induced H9C2. Secondly, JMJD5 over-expression attenuated OGD/R-induced decrease in cell viability and increase in lactate dehydrogenase secretion and cell apoptosis in H9C2. Mitophagy was promoted by pcDNA-mediated over-expression of JMJD5 with enhanced protein expression of LC3-I, LC3-II, Atg5, and Beclin 1. Thirdly, knockdown of JMJD5 aggravated OGD/R-induced decrease in hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), whereas JMJD5 over-expression enhanced BNIP3 (Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein) through upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1. Lastly, BNIP3 silencing promoted cell apoptosis, suppressed mitophagy, and attenuated the protective effects of JMJD5 over-expression against OGD/R-induced injury in H9C2. In conclusion, JMJD5 exerted protective effects against OGD/R-induced injury in cardiomyocytes through upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1-BNIP3.", "journal": "The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences", "date": "2021-08-10", "authors": ["Ya-NanZhang", "Ya-XiangPang", "Da-WeiLiu", "Hai-JuanHu", "Rui-QinXie", "WeiCui"], "doi": "10.1002/kjm2.12434"}

A rabbit myocardial infarction model was then established to test for feasibility and efficacy. Our data showed that hPSC-CMs in EHTs became more aligned over 28 days and had improved contraction kinetics and faster calcium transients. Blinded echocardiographic analysis revealed a significant improvement in function in infarcted hearts that received EHTs, along with reduction in infarct scar size by 35%. Vascularization from the host to the patch was observed at week 1 and stable to week 4, but electrical coupling between patch and host heart was not observed. In vivo telemetry recordings and ex vivo arrhythmia provocation protocols showed that the patch was not pro-arrhythmic.

In order to prevent this damage, a potent cardioprotective agent should be associated with DOX treatment. Corilagin is a natural polyphenol tannic acid which unveils enormous pharmacological activities predominantly as an antitumor agent. Hence, the current work is designed to study the precise mechanisms of corilagin upon administration in doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity in experimental rats. DOX treated rats showed diminished level of blood pressures and heart rate, whereas corilagin along with DOX treatment improved the status. Cardiotoxicity enzymes and biomarkers were found to be increased in the serum of DOX induced rats. Upon treatment, corilagin could reduce the cardiotoxicity enzymes and biomarkers in serum. Histopathological examination of cardiac tissue also revealed the anti-toxic effects of corilagin in contrast to DOX. Injection of DOX in rats showed inflammatory cells infiltration, necrosis and fragmented myofibrils. Corilagin treatment reverted the cardiac histology to near normal.

Numerous studies have reported using either multipotent or pluripotent stem cells or their combination for 3D bioprinting of a cardiac patch with the sole aim of restoring cardiac function by faithfully rejuvenating the cardiomyocytes and associated vasculatures that are lost to myocardial infarction. While many studies have demonstrated success in mimicking cardiomyocytes' behavior, improving cardiac function and providing new hope for regenerating heart post-myocardial infarction, some others have reported contradicting data in apparent ways.

{"title": "Cardiovascular Toxicity Induced by Chronic Vincristine Treatment.", "abstract": "Vincristine is an effective anticancer agent for treating leukemias, lymphomas, and other solid tumors. Vincristine's better-known severe side effects include bone marrow depression, hyponatremia, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal distress. In recent years, cardiovascular damage also has been described during vincristine treatments. However, the vascular toxicity induced by vincristine is little studied. The aim of the present is to evaluate whether these alterations remain after the suspension of chemotherapy treatment (sequelae) and the possible mechanisms involved in this vascular damage. Adult male Wistar rats were used. The animals were divided into four treatment groups: two groups of saline (0.9% NaCl; saline, sequelae saline) and two groups of vincristine (100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg; vincristine, sequelae vincristine). Saline or vincristine was administered intraperitoneally in two cycles of 5\u00a0days each, leaving a rest period between cycles of 2\u00a0days. The final cumulative vincristine dose administered was 1\u00a0mg/kg. Sequelae groups correspond to 2\u00a0weeks after stopping treatment with the antitumor agent. At the end of the different experimental protocols, cardiac and vascular functions were analyzed. Alterations in the expression of different proteins in the cardiovascular tissues were also investigated. Chronic treatment with vincristine did not produce significant changes in basal cardiac function but provoked significant endothelial dysfunction in the aorta and a significant decrease in the mesenteric contractile function. These cardiovascular functional alterations disappeared 2\u00a0weeks after the suspension of chemotherapy treatment. Vincristine treatment caused a significant increase in the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthases (eNOS and iNOS), and connexin 43 in cardiac tissue. In the aorta, the chronic treatment with vincristine caused a slight non-significant increase in TNF\u03b1 expression, a significant increase in eNOS and iNOS, and a significant decrease in connexin 43. After 2\u00a0weeks of vincristine treatment (sequelae group), the expression of TNF\u03b1 increased and eNOS and iNOS expressions disappeared, but a significant decrease in the expression of connexin 43 was still observed in the aorta.

In conclusion, chronic treatment with vincristine causes functional alterations in the vascular function of both conductance and resistance vessels and changes in the expressions of TNF\u03b1, eNOS, iNOS, and connexin 43 in cardiovascular tissues, implicating direct toxicity during its treatment.

{"title": "Engineered Aging Cardiac Tissue Chip Model for Studying Cardiovascular Disease.", "abstract": "Due to the rapidly growing number of older people worldwide and the concomitant increase in cardiovascular complications, there is an urgent need for age-related cardiac disease modeling and drug screening platforms. In the present study, we developed a cardiac tissue chip model that incorporates hemodynamic loading and mimics essential aspects of the infarcted aging heart. We induced cellular senescence in H9c2 myoblasts using low-dose doxorubicin treatment. These senescent cells were then used to engineer cardiac tissue fibers, which were subjected to hemodynamic stresses associated with pressure-volume changes in the heart. Myocardial ischemia was modeled in the engineered cardiac tissue via hypoxic treatment. Our results clearly show that acute low-dose doxorubicin treatment-induced senescence, as evidenced by morphological and molecular markers, including enlarged and flattened nuclei, DNA damage response foci, and increased expression of cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4a, p53, and ROS. Under normal hemodynamic load, the engineered cardiac tissues demonstrated cell alignment and retained cardiac cell characteristics. Our senescent cardiac tissue model of hypoxia-induced myocardial infarction recapitulated the pathological disease hallmarks such as increased cell death and upregulated expression of ANP and BNP. In conclusion, the described methodology provides a novel approach to generate stress-induced aging cardiac cell phenotypes and engineer cardiac tissue chip models to study the cardiovascular disease pathologies associated with aging.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2021-08-09", "authors": ["SachinBudhathoki", "CalebGraham", "PalaniappanSethu", "RamaswamyKannappan"], "doi": "10.1159/000516954"}
{"title": "Analysis of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA expression pattern in heart tissue after total body radiation in a mouse model.", "abstract": "Radiation therapy is integral to effective thoracic cancer treatments, but its application is limited by sensitivity of critical organs such as the heart. The impacts of acute radiation-induced damage and its chronic effects on normal heart cells are highly relevant in radiotherapy with increasing lifespans of patients. Biomarkers for normal tissue damage after radiation exposure, whether accidental or therapeutic, are being studied as indicators of both acute and delayed effects. Recent research has highlighted the potential importance of RNAs, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as biomarkers to assess radiation damage. Understanding changes in mRNA and non-coding RNA expression will elucidate biological pathway changes after radiation.\nTo identify significant expression changes in mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs, we performed whole transcriptome microarray analysis of mouse heart tissue at 48\u00a0h after whole-body irradiation with 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 Gray (Gy). We also validated changes in specific lncRNAs through RT-qPCR. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify pathways associated with gene expression changes.\nWe observed sustained increases in lncRNAs and mRNAs, across all doses of radiation. Alas2, Aplnr, and Cxc3r1 were the most significantly downregulated mRNAs across all doses. Among the significantly upregulated mRNAs were cell-cycle arrest biomarkers Gdf15, Cdkn1a, and Ckap2. Additionally, IPA identified significant changes in gene expression relevant to senescence, apoptosis, hemoglobin synthesis, inflammation, and metabolism. LncRNAs Abhd11os, Pvt1, Trp53cor1, and Dino showed increased expression with increasing doses of radiation. We did not observe any miRNAs with sustained up- or downregulation across all doses, but miR-149-3p, miR-6538, miR-8101, miR-7118-5p, miR-211-3p, and miR-3960 were significantly upregulated after 12\u00a0Gy.\nRadiation-induced RNA expression changes may be predictive of normal tissue toxicities and may indicate targetable pathways for radiation countermeasure development and improved radiotherapy treatment plans.", "journal": "Journal of translational medicine", "date": "2021-08-09", "authors": ["Molykutty JAryankalayil", "ShannonMartello", "Michelle ABylicky", "SunitaChopra", "Jared MMay", "AmanShankardass", "LaurelMacMillan", "LandySun", "JalealSanjak", "ClaireVanpouille-Box", "IrisEke", "C NormanColeman"], "doi": "10.1186/s12967-021-02998-w\n10.3857/roj.2018.00290\n10.1136/bmj.326.7383.256\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2018.04.028\n10.1016/S0167-8140(02)00060-9\n10.1136/bmj.b5349\n10.2307/3580222\n10.1667/RR3049\n10.1097/HP.0000000000000670\n10.1016/j.radonc.2012.02.008\n10.1200/JCO.2006.07.0805\n10.3109/0284186X.2015.1016624\n10.1200/JCO.1994.12.3.447\n10.1155/2020/3579143\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1356\n10.3322/caac.21341\n10.1136/heartjnl-2015-308765\n10.1016/j.clon.2013.06.012\n10.1016/S2352-3026(15)00153-2\n10.1186/s13014-014-0324-1\n10.1667/RR14810.1\n10.1139/cjpp-2017-0121\n10.18632/oncotarget.10424\n10.1038/emm.2017.223\n10.1038/srep15501\n10.1073/pnas.1410622111\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu180\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003863\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311802\n10.1186/1471-2164-15-460\n10.3389/fgene.2019.01116\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx165\n10.1007/s12265-013-9488-6\n10.1016/j.gde.2013.01.002\n10.17219/acem/62915\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.11.031\n10.1093/cvr/cvr311\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.157\n10.1667/RR14377.1\n10.1016/j.tiv.2015.09.007\n10.1093/jrr/rrw111\n10.1177/1559325818799561\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0623\n10.1371/journal.pone.0232411\n10.1667/RR14891.1\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.01.045\n10.1080/1354750X.2018.1479771\n10.1038/ng.3673\n10.1093/nar/gkv007\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btm412\n10.2202/1544-6115.1027\n10.1093/database/baw093\n10.7554/eLife.05005\n10.1667/RR3549.1\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117342\n10.15252/emmm.201707604\n10.18632/oncotarget.7457\n10.4161/cc.8.2.7597\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.07.104\n10.1161/JAHA.115.002272\n10.1177/1559325819833474\n10.1016/j.tice.2019.01.003\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.08.024\n10.1007/s10753-018-0736-4\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.115.001374\n10.1667/RR14357.1\n10.1097/HP.0b013e31825f75a7\n10.1097/HP.0b013e3182667309\n10.1016/j.mrrev.2017.01.001\n10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-20-0572\n10.1016/j.dnarep.2016.04.008\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4223\n10.1016/j.mrgentox.2015.06.009\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.057\n10.1002/ar.23763\n10.1038/onc.2016.500\n10.1210/jc.2010-0581\n10.1002/1878-0261.12483\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0338\n10.1038/s41598-019-42990-5\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.10.042\n10.1038/s41598-017-05479-7\n10.1128/mBio.01190-20\n10.1371/journal.pone.0170644\n10.3109/09553002.2012.652727\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.02.029\n10.1080/09553002.2019.1668981\n10.1007/s00395-015-0520-7\n10.1210/en.2008-1644\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.11.014\n10.1080/15476286.2018.1431494\n10.1038/ncomms14016\n10.1073/pnas.96.1.220\n10.1159/000480209\n10.1038/s41419-018-0265-y\n10.1042/BSR20180576\n10.3892/ol.2019.10450\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.137\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.305242\n10.1038/nature07511\n10.3892/mmr.2020.10944\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.12.013\n10.3892/etm.2018.5908\n10.1155/2015/624037\n10.1097/CRD.0b013e3182431c23\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00914\n10.1155/2017/4042509\n10.1038/s41388-019-1035-8\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.07.024\n10.1016/j.mito.2019.07.009\n10.1073/pnas.1720693115\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.07.006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0116587\n10.2337/db16-1519\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.10.078\n10.1681/ASN.2017070802\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.002838\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001677\n10.1667/RADE-20-00123.1\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr389\n10.15386/cjmed-380\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048619\n10.1016/S1097-2765(02)00706-2\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.04.021\n10.1210/jc.2003-030967\n10.1667/RR2419.1"}

{"title": "Optical clearing in cardiac imaging: A comparative study.", "abstract": "The optical clearing of the cardiac tissue has always been a challenging goal to obtain successful three-dimensional reconstructions of entire hearts. Typically, the developed protocols are targeted at the clearing of the brain; cardiac tissue requires proper arrangements to the original protocols, which are usually tough and time-consuming to figure out. Here, we present the application of three different clearing methodologies on mouse hearts: uDISCO, CLARITY, and SHIELD. For each approach, we describe the required optimizations that we have developed to improve the outcome; in particular, we focus on comparing the features of the tissue after the application of each methodology, especially in terms of tissue preservation, transparency, and staining. We found that the uDISCO protocol induces strong fiber delamination of the cardiac tissue, thus reducing the reliability of structural analyses. The CLARITY protocol confers a high level of transparency to the heart and allows deep penetration of the fluorescent dyes; however, it requires long times for the clearing and the tissue loses its robustness. The SHIELD methodology, indeed, is very promising for tissue maintenance since it preserves its consistency and provides ideal transparency, but further approaches are needed to obtain homogeneous staining of the whole heart. Since the CLARITY procedure, despite the disadvantages in terms of tissue preservation and timings, is actually the most suitable approach to image labeled samples in depth, we optimized and performed the methodology also on human cardiac tissue from control hearts and hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2021-08-07", "authors": ["CamillaOlianti", "FrancescoGiardini", "EricaLazzeri", "IreneCostantini", "LudovicoSilvestri", "RaffaeleCoppini", "ElisabettaCerbai", "Francesco SPavone", "LeonardoSacconi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2021.07.012"}
{"title": "TGR5 Expression Is Associated with Changes in the Heart and Urinary Bladder of Rats with Metabolic Syndrome.", "abstract": "Adipose-derived cytokines may contribute to the inflammation that occurs in metabolic syndrome (MetS). The Takeda G protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) regulates energy expenditure and affects the production of pro-inflammatory biomarkers in metabolic diseases. Etanercept, which acts as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 antagonist, can also block the inflammatory response. Therefore, the interaction between TNF-\u03b1 and TGR5 expression was investigated in rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Heart tissues isolated from the HFD-induced MetS rats were analyzed. Changes in TGR5 expression were investigated with lithocholic acid (LCA) as the agonist. Betulinic acid (BA) was used to activate TGR5 in urinary bladders. LCA was more effective in the heart tissues of HFD-fed rats, although etanercept alleviated the function of LCA. STAT3 activation and higher TGR5 expression were observed in the heart tissues collected from HFD-fed rats. Thus, cardiac TGR5 expression is promoted by HFD through STAT3 activation in rats. Moreover, the urinary bladders of female rats fed a HFD showed a low response, which was reversed by etanercept. Relaxation by BA in the bladders was more marked in HFD-fed rats. The high TGR5 expression in HFD-fed rats was characterized using a mRNA assay, and the increased cAMP levels were found to be stimulated by BA in the isolated bladders. Therefore, TGR5 expression increases with a HFD in both the hearts and urinary bladders. Collectively, cytokine-medicated TGR5 activation was observed in the hearts and urinary bladders of rats.", "journal": "Life (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-07", "authors": ["Chia-ChenHsu", "Kai-ChunCheng", "YingxiaoLi", "Ping-HaoHsu", "Juei-TangCheng", "Ho-ShanNiu"], "doi": "10.3390/life11070695\n10.1016/j.drudis.2009.02.005\n10.1002/hep.23585\n10.1136/heartjnl-2013-304546\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00646\n10.1111/1755-5922.12462\n10.1042/BSR20193482\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009689\n10.1038/s41598-019-40002-0\n10.15761/IMM.1000366\n10.1111/obr.12229\n10.1016/j.pmedr.2017.07.004\n10.1093/jn/133.7.2244\n10.3390/ijerph7030765\n10.5114/aoms.2018.72609\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.55\n10.1007/s11095-014-1526-9\n10.1016/j.taap.2017.11.003\n10.2174/187153011794982086\n10.1155/2020/6318520\n10.1016/j.lfs.2005.03.021\n10.1111/apha.12489\n10.1038/nrc2628\n10.1517/17425255.2014.970165\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004252\n10.1590/1414-431x20175868\n10.1038/srep21358\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.04.007\n10.1007/s00011-012-0555-2\n10.1152/ajprenal.00607.2014\n10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11258.x\n10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2016.07.005\n10.1038/srep24580\n10.2147/DDDT.S113197\n10.2147/DDDT.S131892\n10.1172/jci.insight.138881\n10.1016/j.metabol.2019.07.003\n10.1007/s00395-011-0156-1\n10.1186/s12929-015-0211-6\n10.3109/08941939.2010.521232\n10.1161/01.RES.0000150734.79804.92\n10.1016/j.cyto.2006.04.010\n10.1002/hep.24517\n10.1096/fj.04-3099fje\n10.4161/jkst.19776\n10.1124/pr.119.018440\n10.1093/intimm/dxr077"}

Recently, a new potent biological tool used within healing processes is represented by exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These cells are the well-known extracellular nanovesicles released from cells to facilitate cell function and communication. In this work, a combination of elastomeric membranes and exosomes was obtained and tested as a bioimplant. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and macrophages were seeded into the scaffold (polycaprolactone) and filled with exosomes derived from MSCs. Cells were tested for proliferation with an MTT test, and for wound healing properties and macrophage polarization by gene expression. Moreover, morphological analyses of their ability to colonize the scaffolds surfaces have been further evaluated. Results confirm that exosomes were easily entrapped onto the surface of the elastomeric scaffolds, increasing the wound healing properties and collagen type I and vitronectin of the MSC, and improving the M2 phenotype of the macrophages, mainly thanks to the increase in miRNA124 and decrease in miRNA 125.

{"title": "Crocetin Exerts a Cardio-protective Effect on Mice with Coxsackievirus B3-induced Acute Viral Myocarditis.", "abstract": "Previous research has proven that coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is broadly considered virus used in the experimental model of animals, which causes myocarditis in humans. To investigate whether there exists a cardio-protective effect of crocetin in an experimental murine model of acute viral myocarditis (AVM). Male BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to three groups: control, myocarditis treated with placebo and myocarditis treated with crocetin (n = 40 animals per group). Myocarditis was established by intraperitoneal injection with CVB3. Twenty-four hours after infection, crocetin was intraperitoneally administered for 14 consecutive days. Twenty mice were randomly selected from each group to monitor a 14-day survival rate. On day 7 and day 14, eight surviving mice from each group were sacrificed and their hearts and blood were obtained to perform serological and histological examinations. Expression of ROCKs, interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), ROR\u03b3t, and Foxp3 was quantified by RT-PCR. Plasma levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17 were measured by ELISA. In addition, protein levels of IL-17 and ROCK2 in cardiac tissues were analyzed by Western blot. Crocetin treatment significantly increased survival, attenuated myocardial necrotic lesions, reduced CVB3 replication and expression of ROCK2 and IL-17 in the infected hearts. ROCK pathway inhibition was cardio-protective in viral myocarditis with increased survival, decreased viral replication, and inflammatory response. These findings suggest that crocetin is a potential therapeutic agent for patients with viral myocarditis.", "journal": "Journal of oleo science", "date": "2021-08-06", "authors": ["LiQin", "HuiLiu", "JinghuaWang", "WeiWang", "LeiZhang"], "doi": "10.5650/jos.ess21100"}

It contains many medicinal and pharmacological properties. Doxorubicin is an anticancer drug; however, its clinical usage is limited due to its cumulative and dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. This study investigates geraniol as a protective agent against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and explores possible underlying mechanisms of action.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated into five groups. Groups 1 and 2 were administered saline and geraniol 200\u00a0mg/kg/day/orally, respectively, for 15 days. Group 3 was administered intraperitoneal doxorubicin (5\u00a0mg/kg/IP on the 5th, 10th and 15th days to achieve a cumulative dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg) to induce cardiotoxicity. The fourth and fifth groups were treated with either geraniol 100\u00a0mg/kg or 200\u00a0mg/kg orally and doxorubicin to equal the doxorubicin dose administered to Group 3.\nTreatment with geraniol significantly ameliorated cardiac damage and restored serum cardiac injury marker levels in doxorubicin treated animals. Geraniol upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, elevated total antioxidant capacity, decreased the nuclear accumulation of kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), decreased the phosphorylation and degradation of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (I\u03baB\u03b1), suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels, and restored the levels of Bax and caspase-3 and 9 in heart tissue.\nGeraniol may function as a potential activator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which subsequently improves Nrf2-dependent antioxidative signaling, diminishes apoptosis and subdues the inflammatory response.

{"title": "A deep dive into the darning effects of biomaterials in infarct myocardium: current advances and future perspectives.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) occurs due to the obstruction of coronary arteries, a major crux that restricts blood flow and thereby oxygen to the distal part of the myocardium, leading to loss of cardiomyocytes and eventually, if left untreated, leads to heart failure. MI, a potent cardiovascular disorder, requires intense therapeutic interventions and thereby presents towering challenges. Despite the concerted efforts, the treatment strategies for MI are still demanding, which has paved the way for the genesis of biomaterial applications. Biomaterials exhibit immense potentials for cardiac repair and regeneration, wherein they act as extracellular matrix replacing scaffolds or as delivery vehicles for stem cells, protein, plasmids, etc. This review concentrates on natural, synthetic, and hybrid biomaterials; their function; and interaction with the body, mechanisms of repair by which they are able to improve cardiac function in a MI milieu.

{"title": "Tapering of the interventricular septum can affect ultrasound shear wave elastography: An in vitro and in silico study.", "abstract": "Shear wave elastography (SWE) has the potential to determine cardiac tissue stiffness from non-invasive shear wave speed measurements, important, e.g., for predicting heart failure. Previous studies showed that waves traveling in the interventricular septum (IVS) may display Lamb-like dispersive behaviour, introducing a thickness-frequency dependency in the wave speed. However, the IVS tapers across its length, which complicates wave speed estimation by introducing an additional variable to account for. The goal of this work is to assess the impact of tapering thickness on SWE. The investigation is performed by combining in vitro experiments with acoustic radiation force (ARF) and 2D finite element simulations, to isolate the effect of the tapering curve on ARF-induced and natural waves in the heart. The experiments show a 11% deceleration during propagation from the thick to the thin end of an IVS-mimicking tapered phantom plate. The numerical analysis shows that neglecting the thickness variation in the wavenumber-frequency domain can introduce errors of more than 30% in the estimation of the shear modulus, and that the exact tapering curve, rather than the overall thickness reduction, determines the dispersive behaviour of the wave. These results suggest that septal geometry should be accounted for when deriving cardiac stiffness with SWE.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2021-08-04", "authors": ["ASabbadini", "ACaenen", "L B HKeijzer", "P L M Jvan Neer", "H JVos", "Nde Jong", "M DVerweij"], "doi": "10.1121/10.0005646"}

Apart from Bcr-Abl kinase, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib are known to have additional off-target effects that might contribute to their antitumoural activities. In our study, we identified aldo-keto reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) as a novel target for dasatinib. The enzyme AKR1B10 is upregulated in several cancers and influences the metabolism of chemotherapy drugs, including anthracyclines. AKR1B10 reduces anthracyclines to alcohol metabolites that show less antineoplastic properties and tend to accumulate in cardiac tissue.

On the 21st day from tumor inoculation, the mice were sacrificed and tumor and heart tissues were removed. Tumor \u03b2-catenin/Cyclin D1 and p53 were assessed by immunohistochemistry. IL-6 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PD-AuNP and Dox-AuNP showed a significant reduction in tumor volume and weight more than their free forms. Also, PD-AuNP and Dox-AuNP showed markedly less dense tumor cells. \u03b2-catenin and Cyclin D1 were markedly decreased and p53 was highly upregulated by PD-AuNP and Dox-AuNP. Moreover, PD-AuNP and Dox-AuNP have the ability to decrease IL-6 production. PD-AuNP protected the heart from Dox-induced severe degeneration.

{"title": "Developmental lineage of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac fibroblasts affects their functional phenotype.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs) support heart function by secreting extracellular matrix (ECM) and paracrine factors, respond to stress associated with injury and disease, and therefore are an increasingly important therapeutic target. We describe how developmental lineage of human pluripotent stem cell-derived CFBs, epicardial (EpiC-FB), and second heart field (SHF-FB) impacts transcriptional and functional properties. Both EpiC-FBs and SHF-FBs exhibited CFB transcriptional programs and improved calcium handling in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues. We identified differences including in composition of ECM synthesized, secretion of growth and differentiation factors, and myofibroblast activation potential, with EpiC-FBs exhibiting higher stress-induced activation potential akin to myofibroblasts and SHF-FBs demonstrating higher calcification and mineralization potential. These phenotypic differences suggest that EpiC-FBs have utility in modeling fibrotic diseases while SHF-FBs are a promising source of cells for regenerative therapies.

{"title": "Metabolomics of Artichoke Bud Extract in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats.", "abstract": "Hypertension adversely affects the quality of life in humans across modern society. Studies have attributed increased reactive oxygen species production to the pathophysiology of hypertension. So far, a specific drug to control the disease perfectly has not been developed. However, artichoke, an edible vegetable, plays an essential role in treating many diseases due to its potent antioxidant activities. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of artichoke bud extract (ABE) on heart tissue metabolomics of hypertensive rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were divided into six groups, then exposed to different doses comprising ABE, Enalapril Maleate, or 1% carboxylmethyl cellulose for 4 weeks. Their blood pressures were recorded at 0, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the start of the test period. Thereafter, all rats were anesthetized, and blood was collected from their cardiac apexes. Then, we measured the levels for 15 kinds of serum biochemical parameters. An established orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis model completed the metabolomic analysis. Hypertensive rats in the ABE group exhibited well-controlled blood pressure, relative to those in the model group. Specifically, artichoke significantly lowered serum levels for total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), and uric acid (UA) in the hypertensive rats. This effect involved the action of eight metabolites, including guanine, 1-methylnicotinamide, ", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2021-08-03", "authors": ["Zhi-BinWang", "Shi-LongJiang", "Shao-BoLiu", "Jing-BoPeng", "ShuoHu", "XuWang", "WeiZhuo", "TongLiu", "Ji-WeiGuo", "Hong-HaoZhou", "Zhi-QuanYang", "Xiao-YuanMao", "Zhao-QianLiu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.1c01135\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.006\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1001/jama.2018.16760\n10.1001/jama.2018.16579\n10.1164/rccm.201911-2137oc\n10.14336/ad.2018.1001\n10.1210/clinem/dgz293\n10.14309/ajg.0000000000000994\n10.3390/nu12092627\n10.1016/j.jhep.2020.11.045\n10.1111/jch.14188\n10.3390/ijms21114066\n10.2147/VHRM.S61019\n10.1056/nejmcp1613481\n10.1375/twin.8.5.499\n10.1038/nrdp.2018.14\n10.1093/ajh/hpu151\n10.1056/nejmoa013591\n10.1161/01.cir.95.3.588\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.05.005\n10.1161/circulationaha.116.023877\n10.1161/circulationaha.116.023926\n10.1161/hypertensionaha.109.130351\n10.1152/ajplung.00166.2007\n10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000527\n10.1186/s12931-019-1270-0\n10.12659/MSM.926281\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101319\n10.1371/journal.pone.0180817\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.02.027\n10.1002/pmic.201800311\n10.1016/j.lfs.2017.11.022\n10.1007/s11033-020-05746-3\n10.1016/j.jff.2009.01.002\n10.1016/j.phrs.2018.10.007\n10.1002/ptr.6073\n10.1080/10408398.2017.1332572\n10.1002/ptr.6213\n10.1017/s0007114519002332\n10.1021/jf0490192\n10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.07.003\n10.1039/c5fo00137d\n10.3109/19390210903280207\n10.1159/000502280\n10.1124/jpet.104.066639\n10.1080/10641960600798655\n10.1002/biof.1507\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000226196.67052.c0\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.044\n10.1007/s10067-019-04603-4\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00118\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00403\n10.1111/hepr.12984\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.08.989\n10.1371/journal.pone.0182969\n10.3181/00379727-188-42764\n10.1016/s0140-6736(15)00418-3\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr003\n10.1177/1535370220909311\n10.1152/ajprenal.1990.258.3.f606\n10.1161/01.hyp.0000178189.68229.8a\n10.3390/jcm10030448\n10.1038/ng.2352\n10.2174/1574887115666200709142119\n10.1001/jama.300.8.924\n10.1038/s41371-020-0342-4\n10.1055/a-1023-6710\n10.1155/2019/3851718\n10.1007/s11883-020-00892-2\n10.1016/j.numecd.2020.11.026\n10.2147/dmso.s265735\n10.1161/circresaha.118.311342\n10.1161/hypertensionaha.119.14294\n10.1007/s11906-016-0684-z\n10.1177/2045894018791557\n10.1038/s41419-020-2593-y\n10.1371/journal.pone.0176887\n10.1007/s43440-020-00125-y\n10.1016/j.jep.2020.112738\n10.1016/j.jash.2016.12.002\n10.3389/fnagi.2017.00212\n10.1016/j.jphs.2018.05.008\n10.1136/heart.86.4.467\n10.1038/sj.jhh.1001044\n10.1097/hjh.0000000000000168\n10.1161/circresaha.117.311002\n10.1038/nprot.2012.024\n10.1093/nar/gky310\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt285"}

{"title": "Mapping Autoantibodies in Children With Acute Rheumatic Fever.", "abstract": "Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a serious sequela of Group A \nThis study has utilised a multi-platform approach to profile circulating autoantibodies in ARF. Sera from patients with ARF, matched healthy controls and patients with uncomplicated GAS pharyngitis were initially analysed for autoreactivity using high content protein arrays (Protoarray, 9000 autoantigens), and further explored using a second protein array platform (HuProt Array, 16,000 autoantigens) and 2-D gel electrophoresis of heart tissue combined with mass spectrometry. Selected autoantigens were orthogonally validated using conventional immunoassays with sera from an ARF case-control study (n=79 cases and n=89 matched healthy controls) and a related study of GAS pharyngitis (n=39) conducted in New Zealand.\nGlobal analysis of the protein array data showed an increase in total autoantigen reactivity in ARF patients compared with controls, as well as marked heterogeneity in the autoantibody profiles between ARF patients. Autoantigens previously implicated in ARF pathogenesis, such as myosin and collagens were detected, as were novel candidates. Disease pathway analysis revealed several autoantigens within pathways linked to arthritic and myocardial disease. Orthogonal validation of three novel autoantigens (PTPN2, DMD and ANXA6) showed significant elevation of serum antibodies in ARF (p < 0.05), and further highlighted heterogeneity with patients reactive to different combinations of the three antigens.\nThe broad yet heterogenous elevation of autoantibodies observed suggests epitope spreading, and an expansion of the autoantibody repertoire, likely plays a key role in ARF pathogenesis and disease progression.

{"title": "Preparation of Neonatal Rat Papillary Muscles for Contractile Studies.", "abstract": "Isolated cardiac tissue allows investigators to study mechanisms underlying normal and pathological conditions, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to perform in vivo. In contrast to ventricular muscle strip preparations, papillary muscles can be prepared without severely damaging the muscle tissue. In this preparation, the isolated papillary muscle is fixed in an environmentally controlled organ bath chamber and electrically stimulated. The evoked twitch force is recorded using a pressure transducer, and parameters such as twitch force amplitude and twitch kinetics are analyzed. A variety of experimental protocols can be performed to investigate the calcium- and frequency-dependent contractility as well as dose-response curves of contractile agents, as well as simulation of pathologic conditions such as acute cardiac ischemia. Mouse papillary muscle preparations have long been the mainstay for studying interactions between intracellular calcium regulation and contractile responses under a number of simulated pathophysiological conditions. These studies are often used to complement in vitro studies performed using isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes.

The main aim of this study was to assess impact of supplementation of maternal' and early postnatal diet with conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) isomers on selected elements content in hearts of their female offspring with chemically induced breast cancer.\nElemental composition was determined by quadrupole mass spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma ionization (ICP-MS).\nThe effect of maternal' diet on the elements content was more pronounced than the progeny diet modifications. Significant correlations among determined elements, especially macroelements, and lipidomic parameters, in the experimental factors dependent manner were observed. It can be concluded that supplementation of maternal and progeny diets with CLA isomers may significantly influence the contents of both macro- and microelements in cardiac tissue of newborns.\nOur results also indicate, that dynamic and intricate balance among various elements in body may be affected by the lipid dietary supplements also in the pathological state.

However, its role in the human cardiac tissue has not been fully understood. It was observed that miR-378a protects cardiomyocytes from hypertrophic growth by regulation of IGF1R and the expression of downstream kinases. Increased levels of miR-378a were reported in the serum of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and female carriers of DMD gene-associated mutations with developed cardiomyopathy. In order to shed more light on the role of miR-378a in human cardiomyocytes and its potential involvement in DMD-related cardiomyopathy, we generated two human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models; one with deletion of miR-378a and the second one with deletion of DMD exon 50 leading to the DMD phenotype. Our results indicate that lack of miR-378a does not influence the pluripotency of hiPSC and their ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM). miR-378a-deficient hiPSC-CM exhibited, however, significantly bigger size compared to the isogenic control cells, indicating the role of this miRNA in the hypertrophic growth of human cardiomyocytes. In accordance, the level of NFATc3, phosphoAKT, phosphoERK and ERK was higher in these cells compared to the control counterparts. A similar effect was achieved by silencing miR-378a with antagomirs. Of note, the percentage of cells with nuclear localization of NFATc3 was higher in miR-378a-deficient hiPSC-CM.

Moreover, DOX significantly reduced the levels of total antioxidant capacity and activities of catalase and glutathione S-transferase. In contrast, TRE treatment of DOX-administered mice significantly improved almost all of the above-mentioned assessed parameters. Furthermore, histopathological changes of cardiac tissues observed in mice treated with TRE in combination with DOX were significantly improved as compared to DOX-treated animals.

Myocardial fibrosis is a fundamental process in ventricular remodeling and a primary contributor to the progression of heart failure. Liquiritigenin (LQ) is a flavanone compound with anti\u2011oxidative, anti\u2011carcinogenic, anti\u2011inflammatory and estrogenic properties. The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory potential of LQ treatment in a mouse model of isoprenaline (ISO)\u2011induced cardiac fibrosis and in cultured H9C2 cardiomyocytes stimulated with angiotensin II (Ang\u00a0II). The treatment of ISO\u2011induced mice with LQ significantly decreased the levels of cardiac injury\u2011related proteins in the serum and ECM accumulation in mouse heart tissues. LQ treatment also effectively alleviated cardiac dysfunction in ISO\u2011treated mice. Further analyses revealed that LQ inhibited ISO\u2011induced collagen formation and activation of the transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b21\u00a0(TGF\u2011\u03b21)/Smad2 and protein kinase\u00a0B\u00a0(AKT)/extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways. As a major pathological event in myocardial fibrosis, the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes has been considered a key mechanism contributing to impaired left ventricle performance. The pretreatment of rat cardiomyocytes with LQ significantly reduced the apoptosis of H9C2 cells, and inhibited Ang\u00a0II\u2011induced activation of the TGF\u2011\u03b21/Smad2 and AKT/ERK pathways.

The cardiomyogenesis capacity of hAdSC were identified using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The population of the cells isolated from the heart tissue expressed cTnT-1 (13.38\u2009\u00b1\u200911.38%), cKit (7.85\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2%), ICAM (85.53\u2009\u00b1\u20098.69%), PECAM (61.63\u2009\u00b1\u20097.18%) and VCAM (35.9\u2009\u00b1\u20099.11%), while from the fat tissue expressed the mesenchymal phenotypes (CD73, CD90, CD105, but not CD45, CD34, CD11b, CD19 and HLA-DR). Two age groups of hAdSC donors were compared, the youngsters (30-40yo) and the elderly (60-70 yo).\nThe co-culture showed that after 5-day incubation, the seeded graft in the hAdSC-30 group had a tube-like appearance while the hAdSC-60 group demonstrated a disorganised pattern, despite of the MSC expressions of the hAdSC-60 were significantly higher. Initial co-culture showed no difference of ATP counts among all groups, however the hAdSC-30 group had the highest ATP count after 9 days culture (p\u2009=\u20090.004).

{"title": "Loss of crossbridge inhibition drives pathological cardiac hypertrophy in patients harboring the TPM1 E192K mutation.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disorder caused primarily by mutations to thick and thinfilament proteins. Although thin filament mutations are less prevalent than their oft-studied thick filament counterparts, they are frequently associated with severe patient phenotypes and can offer important insight into fundamental disease mechanisms. We have performed a detailed study of tropomyosin (TPM1) E192K, a variant of uncertain significance associated with HCM. Molecular dynamics revealed that E192K results in a more flexible TPM1 molecule, which could affect its ability to regulate crossbridges. In vitro motility assays of regulated actin filaments containing TPM1 E192K showed an overall loss of Ca2+ sensitivity. To understand these effects, we used multiscale computational models that suggested a subtle phenotype in which E192K leads to an inability to completely inhibit actin-myosin crossbridge activity at low Ca2+. To assess the physiological impact of the mutation, we generated patient-derived engineered heart tissues expressing E192K. These tissues showed disease features similar to those of the patients, including cellular hypertrophy, hypercontractility, and diastolic dysfunction. We hypothesized that excess residual crossbridge activity could be triggering cellular hypertrophy, even if the overall Ca2+ sensitivity was reduced by E192K. To test this hypothesis, the cardiac myosin-specific inhibitor mavacamten was applied to patient-derived engineered heart tissues for 4 d followed by 24 h of washout. Chronic mavacamten treatment abolished contractile differences between control and TPM1 E192K engineered heart tissues and reversed hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that the TPM1 E192K mutation triggers cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by permitting excess residual crossbridge activity. These studies also provide direct evidence that myosin inhibition by mavacamten can counteract the hypertrophic effects of mutant tropomyosin.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2021-07-29", "authors": ["Lorenzo RSewanan", "JinkyuPark", "Michael JRynkiewicz", "Alice WRacca", "NikolaosPapoutsidakis", "JonasSchwan", "Daniel LJacoby", "Jeffrey RMoore", "WilliamLehman", "YibingQyang", "Stuart GCampbell"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.202012640\n10.1038/nmeth0410-248\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.04.006\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.01.001\n10.1007/s10974-013-9343-z\n10.1002/jcc.21287\n10.1152/ajpheart.00162.2016\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.02.010\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00460\n10.1371/journal.pone.0046688\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.12.012\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.11.015\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.09.059\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.05.004\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.002\n10.1016/j.bpj.2020.07.006\n10.1007/s00424-018-2214-0\n10.1016/j.abb.2018.04.002\n10.1161/JAHA.116.005407\n10.1113/JP273769\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e318223e2bd\n10.1126/science.aad3456\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1016/j.jchf.2014.08.003\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.03.064\n10.1115/1.2891193\n10.1016/0263-7855(96)00018-5\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32391-6\n10.1074/jbc.M117.776815\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.099\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004376\n10.1016/j.jmb.2009.03.060\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034549\n10.1038/nature19057\n10.1016/j.jmb.2009.10.060\n10.1016/j.jsb.2010.01.016\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.141\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1016/j.febslet.2012.08.005\n10.1021/bi3006835\n10.1016/j.hfc.2017.12.002\n10.1021/bi200506k\n10.1016/0076-6879(82)85009-X\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311059\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.01.013\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy249\n10.1016/j.molmed.2019.06.005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316950\n10.1155/2016/1684792\n10.1016/j.abb.2014.09.007\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.06.034\n10.1016/j.bpj.2020.05.017\n10.1016/0076-6879(82)85024-6\n10.1007/s10974-013-9358-5\n10.1007/s10974-015-9419-z\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.052359\n10.1113/JP276741\n10.4137/BMI.S23912\n10.1038/srep32068\n10.1038/nprot.2012.015\n10.1113/JP276753\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00473\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.03.004\n10.1152/ajpheart.00325.2020\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.05.005\n10.1093/nar/gks539\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1963.204.4.604\n10.1016/0735-1097(90)90278-W\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs150\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.09.008\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003552\n10.1007/s10741-005-5253-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.224170\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000080896.52003.DF\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.08.070\n10.1038/gim.2016.90\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.12.002\n10.1073/pnas.1519541113\n10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00958\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz326\n10.1038/s41467-019-14008-1\n10.1146/annurev-genom-083118-015306\n10.1007/s10974-016-9447-3"}

Current delivery approaches for EVs involve either intra-myocardial or intravenous injection, where both have inherent limitations for downstream clinical applications such as secondary tissue injury and low delivery efficiency.

By spraying a mixture of EVs, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) precursors, and photoinitiators followed by visible light irradiation for 30\u00a0s, EVs are physically entrapped within the GelMA hydrogel network covering the surface of the heart, resulting in an enhanced retention rate. Moreover, EVs are gradually released from the hydrogel network through a combination of diffusion and/or enzymatic degradation of the hydrogel, and they are effectively taken up by the sprayed tissue area. More importantly, the released EVs further migrate deep into myocardium tissue, which exerts an improved therapeutic effect.

The roles of miR-205 in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain unknown. The aim of this research is to reveal whether miR-205 could regulate cardiac I/R injury by focusing upon the oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis.\nLevels of miR-205 and Rnd3 were examined in the hearts with I/R injury. Myocardial infarct size, cardiac function, oxidative stress, mitochondria function, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were detected in mice with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. The primary neonatal cardiomyocytes underwent hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) to simulate MI/R injury.\nmiR-205 levels were significantly elevated in cardiac tissues from I/R in comparison with those from Sham. In comparison with controls, levels of Rnd3 were significantly decreased in the hearts from mice with MI/R injury. Furthermore, inhibiting miR-205 alleviated MI/R-induced apoptosis, reduced infarct size, prevented oxidative stress increase and mitochondrial fragmentation, and improved mitochondrial functional capacity and cardiac function. Consistently, overexpression of miR-205 increased infarct size and promoted apoptosis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice with MI/R injury. In cultured mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes, downregulation of miR-205 reduced oxidative stress in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. Finally, inhibiting Rnd3 ablated the cardioprotective effects of miR-205 inhibitor in MI/R injury.\nWe conclude that inhibiting miR-205 reduces infarct size, improves cardiac function, and suppresses oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis by promoting Rnd3 in MI/R injury. miR-205 inhibitor-induced Rnd3 activation is a valid target to treat MI/R injury.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2021-07-27", "authors": ["YuerongXu", "WangangGuo", "DiZeng", "YexianFang", "RunzeWang", "DongGuo", "BingchaoQi", "YugangXue", "FengXue", "ZuolinJin", "YanLi", "MingmingZhang"], "doi": "10.1155/2021/9986506\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311849\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.11.007\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.032\n10.1161/jaha.114.001445\n10.3390/ijms20246249\n10.1101/gr.131912.111\n10.1186/s12943-018-0897-7\n10.7150/thno.27285\n10.1007/s00395-020-0783-5\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2015.10.003\n10.1007/s00395-020-0816-0\n10.26355/eurrev_202003_20700\n10.3892/ijmm.2018.3695\n10.1007/978-3-319-55330-6_8\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010715-103335\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246108\n10.1038/s41569-018-0059-z\n10.1074/jbc.M112.411363\n10.1111/apha.13590\n10.1152/ajpheart.00554.2011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311401\n10.3390/ijms22010027\n10.1016/j.molonc.2012.03.003\n10.1016/0092-8674(85)90058-3\n10.1016/j.tcb.2006.08.006\n10.1002/cphy.c150018\n10.1128/MCB.16.6.2689\n10.1038/cddis.2014.235\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304940\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06412\n10.1007/s10495-015-1148-7\n10.1111/jpi.12418\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116613\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.1038/s41572-019-0090-3\n10.1080/17435390.2020.1813824\n10.3892/mmr.2017.7344\n10.1155/2017/6437467\n10.4330/wjc.v10.i9.74\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165768\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.01.024\n10.1007/s10456-020-09720-2\n10.1002/ejhf.1320\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000254415.31362.a7\n10.1136/hrt.2005.068270\n10.1155/2018/7042105\n10.1161/jaha.116.003336\n10.1007/s00395-019-0756-8\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.033700\n10.1016/j.metabol.2019.153999"}

Contraction forces are one of the most important characteristics of cardiac function and are predictors of healthy and diseased states. Cantilever techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, measure the vertical force of a single cell, while systems designed to more closely resemble the physical heart function, such as engineered cardiac tissue held by end-posts, measure the axial force. One important question is how do these two force measurements correlate? By establishing a correlation of the axial and vertical force, we will be one step closer in being able to use single cell iPSC-CMs as models. A novel micromachined sensor for measuring force contractions of engineered tissue has been developed. Using this novel sensor, a correlation between axial force and vertical force is experimentally established.

{"title": "Licochalcone D Ameliorates Oxidative Stress-Induced Senescence via AMPK Activation.", "abstract": "Increased oxidative stress is a crucial factor for the progression of cellular senescence and aging. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of licochalcone D (Lico D) on oxidative stress-induced senescence, both in vitro and in vivo, and explore its potential mechanisms. Hydrogen peroxide (200 \u00b5M for double time) and D-galactose (D-Gal) (150 mg/kg) were used to induce oxidative stress in human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) and mice, respectively. We performed the SA-\u03b2-gal assay and evaluated the senescence markers, activation of AMPK, and autophagy. Lico D potentially reduced oxidative stress-induced senescence by upregulating AMPK-mediated activation of autophagy in hBM-MSCs. D-Gal treatment significantly increased the expression levels of senescence markers, such as p53 and p21, in the heart and hippocampal tissues, while this effect was reversed in the Lico D-treated animals. Furthermore, a significant increase in AMPK activation was observed in both tissues, while the activation of autophagy was only observed in the heart tissue. Interestingly, we found that Lico D significantly reduced the expression levels of the receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the hippocampal tissue. Taken together, our findings highlight the antioxidant, anti-senescent, and cardioprotective effects of Lico D and suggest that the activation of AMPK and autophagy ameliorates the oxidative stress-induced senescence.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-07-25", "authors": ["NagarajanMaharajan", "Chitra DeviGanesan", "ChangjongMoon", "Chul-HoJang", "Won-KeunOh", "Gwang-WonCho"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22147324\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.015\n10.1038/nrm3823\n10.1038/s41570-019-0108-0\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039\n10.1038/s41591-018-0092-9\n10.1016/j.drudis.2017.01.004\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.12.010\n10.1111/acel.12592\n10.1073/pnas.91.10.4130\n10.3389/fnagi.2016.00208\n10.1042/bj3320043\n10.1111/acel.12446\n10.1155/2018/7108604\n10.3390/ijms21051836\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2018.01.007\n10.1159/000491113\n10.3892/ijmm.2017.3276\n10.1111/jcmm.13472\n10.1016/j.exger.2017.10.029\n10.1007/s10522-019-09837-y\n10.1038/nrm.2017.95\n10.7150/thno.28778\n10.18632/aging.102181\n10.1080/15548627.2016.1247143\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.028\n10.1038/nature06639\n10.1111/acel.12709\n10.1038/nature16187\n10.1111/acel.12655\n10.1038/nature21388\n10.1248/cpb.37.2528\n10.1016/0031-9422(92)83481-D\n10.2174/1389557518666180601095420\n10.1039/C7RA07110H\n10.1002/jcp.27050\n10.3390/biom10020297\n10.1038/nature13193\n10.1038/nrm2233\n10.1016/S0968-0896(97)10034-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0128375\n10.1074/jbc.M409153200\n10.3390/cells10030660\n10.18632/aging.103046\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)42138-2\n10.1093/glycob/cwi053\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2009.04.016\n10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00034\n10.1155/2018/8938207\n10.1111/jpi.12194\n10.1093/cercor/bhq002\n10.1155/2016/4847812\n10.1016/j.intimp.2009.01.031"}

In skin, KLHL24-\u0394N28 leads to gain of function, excessively targeting intermediate filament keratin-14 for proteasomal degradation, ultimately causing epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). The majority of these EBS-patients are also diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), but the pathological mechanism in the heart is unknown. As desmin is the cardiac homologue of keratin-14, we hypothesized that KLHL24-\u0394N28 leads to excessive degradation of desmin, resulting in DCM. Dynamically loaded engineered heart tissues (dyn-EHTs) were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes from two patients and three (non)familial controls. Ten-fold lower desmin protein levels were observed in patient-derived dyn-EHTs, in line with diminished desmin levels detected in patients' explanted heart. This was accompanied by tissue dilatation, impaired mitochondrial function, decreased force values and increased cardiomyocyte stress. HEK293 transfection studies confirmed KLHL24-mediated desmin degradation. KLHL24 RNA interference or direct desmin overexpression recovered desmin protein levels, restoring morphology and function in patient-derived dyn-EHTs.

The cardiac muscle microenvironment is known to change with age, yet the direct effects of these changes have yet to be studied in-depth. The present study sought to better elucidate the role that biochemical and biomechanical alterations in cardiac tissue have in the altered phenotype and functionality of cardiac resident macrophages observed with increasing age. To accomplish this, na\u00efve bone marrow derived macrophages from young mice were seeded onto either functionalized poly-dimethyl-siloxane hydrogels ranging in stiffness from 2kPA to 64kPA or onto tissue culture plastic, both of which were coated with either young or aged solubilized mouse cardiac extracellular matrix (cECM). Both biomechanical and biochemical alterations were found to have a significant effect on macrophage polarization and function. Increased substrate stiffness was found to promote macrophage morphologies associated with pro-inflammatory macrophage activation, increased expression of pro-inflammatory inducible nitric oxide synthase protein with increased nitric oxide secretion, and attenuated arginase activity and protein expression. Additionally, exposure to aged cECM promoted attenuated responsivity to both canonical pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling cues when compared to young cECM treated cells.

{"title": "Dynamic loading of human engineered heart tissue enhances contractile function and drives a desmosome-linked disease phenotype.", "abstract": "The role that mechanical forces play in shaping the structure and function of the heart is critical to understanding heart formation and the etiology of disease but is challenging to study in patients. Engineered heart tissues (EHTs) incorporating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes have the potential to provide insight into these adaptive and maladaptive changes. However, most EHT systems cannot model both preload (stretch during chamber filling) and afterload (pressure the heart must work against to eject blood). Here, we have developed a new dynamic EHT (dyn-EHT) model that enables us to tune preload and have unconstrained contractile shortening of >10%. To do this, three-dimensional (3D) EHTs were integrated with an elastic polydimethylsiloxane strip providing mechanical preload and afterload in addition to enabling contractile force measurements based on strip bending. Our results demonstrated that dynamic loading improves the function of wild-type EHTs on the basis of the magnitude of the applied force, leading to improved alignment, conduction velocity, and contractility. For disease modeling, we used hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from a patient with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy due to mutations in the desmoplakin gene. We demonstrated that manifestation of this desmosome-linked disease state required dyn-EHT conditioning and that it could not be induced using 2D or standard 3D EHT approaches. Thus, a dynamic loading strategy is necessary to provoke the disease phenotype of diastolic lengthening, reduction of desmosome counts, and reduced contractility, which are related to primary end points of clinical disease, such as chamber thinning and reduced cardiac output.", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "date": "2021-07-23", "authors": ["Jacqueline MBliley", "Mathilde C S CVermeer", "Rebecca MDuffy", "IvanBatalov", "DucoKramer", "Joshua WTashman", "Daniel JShiwarski", "AndrewLee", "Alexander STeplenin", "LindaVolkers", "BrianCoffin", "Martijn FHoes", "AnnaKalmykov", "Rachelle NPalchesko", "YanSun", "Jan D HJongbloed", "NilsBomer", "Rudolf Ade Boer", "Albert J HSuurmeijer", "Daniel APijnappels", "Maria CBolling", "Petervan der Meer", "Adam WFeinberg"], "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.abd1817"}
{"title": "Circulating miR-146a as a possible candidate biomarker in the indeterminate phase of Chagas disease.", "abstract": "Chagas disease is considered important and presents intense inflammatory and fibrotic processes induced by the perpetuation of the parasite in the affected tissues and organs. Therefore, it is necessary to inquire about the host defense and attack mechanisms to have a more detailed knowledge about Chagas disease. MicroRNAs are found in blood, tissues and extracellular vesicles. These small regulators of gene expression are involved in physiological and pathological processes in both mammals and parasites. Several microRNAs have deregulated expression in chagasic heart disease, although little is known about their extracellular expression. Our main objective was to evaluate the involvement of miR-21, miR-146a and miR-155 in several samples from mice infected with the TcI Ninoa strain from the acute and indeterminate phases. We also explored a potential functional association of the selected microRNAs using STRING software. This software identified 23 pathways associated with Trypanosoma cruzi infection. In addition, eleven genes were identified through bioinformatics analysis, and we found that SMAD family member 5 was downregulated in both phases. This gene serves as a mediator in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Thus, forty female mice of the CD1 strain were distributed into 4 groups and the expression levels of miR-21, miR-146a and miR-155 were measured in samples of heart tissue, total plasma and plasma extracellular vesicles by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nOverexpression of miR-21, miR-146a and miR-155 was observed in heart and plasma in both phases. Moreover, in extracellular vesicles miR-21 and miR-146a were also overexpressed in the acute phase, whereas in the indeterminate chronic phase we found only miR-146a up-regulated.\nThe expression of inflammatory microRNAs miR-21, miR-146a and miR-155 were up-regulated in each of the samples from acutely and chronically infected mice. The relevant finding was that miR-146a was up-regulated in each sample in both phases; therefore, this miRNA could be a possible candidate biomarker in Chagas disease.", "journal": "Biological research", "date": "2021-07-23", "authors": ["Martha AliciaBallinas-Verdugo", "Rogelio FrankJim\u00e9nez-Ortega", "EduardoMart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez", "NancyRivas", "Erick AbrahamContreras-L\u00f3pez", "RoxanaCarb\u00f3", "FaustoS\u00e1nchez", "RafaelBojalil", "RicardoM\u00e1rquez-Velasco", "FaustoS\u00e1nchez-Mu\u00f1oz", "RicardoAlejandre-Aguilar"], "doi": "10.1186/s40659-021-00345-3\n10.2174/156652408785748004\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-020117-043711\n10.1590/s0074-02762009000700021\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.09.017\n10.1016/0035-9203(83)90292-4\n10.1590/S0074-02761996000600029\n10.1155/2014/450389\n10.1590/s0074-02762005000300012\n10.1155/2010/890672\n10.1155/2019/7214798\n10.1016/j.micinf.2008.10.003\n10.1016/j.molbiopara.2014.02.004\n10.3402/jev.v4.28734.eCollection2015\n10.1111/cmi.12672\n10.1080/20013078.2018.1463779.eCollection2018\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.23.090506.123406\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.957415\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.05.019\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0003828\n10.3390/ijms20164064\n10.1128/IAI.00948-19\n10.1007/s13205-020-02498-6\n10.1016/j.molbiopara.2012.10.001\n10.1373/clinchem.2009.125310\n10.1373/clinchem.2010.144121\n10.3389/fmicb.2018.00269\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.624296\n10.1128/cmr.5.4.400\n10.1016/j.ccl.2016.08.013\n10.1006/expr.1996.0074\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq013\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.889048\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.958975\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.247452\n10.1155/2015/821823\n10.1590/0074-02760150184\n10.1038/s41598-017-18080-9\n10.1007/978-1-4939-91488_15\n10.1172/JCI64365\n10.1016/j.molbiopara.2015.03.003\n10.1016/0167-5699(91)90063-Y\n10.1590/S0001-37652001000400008\n10.1002/1521-4141(200105)31:5<1495::AID-IMMU1495>3.0.CO;2-8\n10.1046/j.1365-3024.2001.00368.x\n10.1089/jir.2018.0155\n10.1073/pnas.0605298103\n10.1086/345882\n10.1111/j.1462-5822.2004.00481.x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.013\n10.4049/jimmunol.1102439\n10.1016/j.devcel.2018.05.021\n10.1038/ncomms13048\n10.1038/cr.2017.101\n10.1016/1359-6101(96)00015-9\n10.1210/edrv.22.2.0428\n10.3389/fmicb.2016.00183\n10.4049/jimmunol.168.12.6366\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.12.009\n10.1155/2016/2489479\n10.1002/ddr.21278\n10.1371/journal.pone.0206239\n10.3389/fgene.2019.01330"}

{"title": "The Potential Roles of Osmotic and Nonosmotic Sodium Handling in Mediating the Effects of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors on Heart Failure.", "abstract": "Concomitant type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease increases the risk of heart failure. Recent studies demonstrate beneficial effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on chronic kidney disease progression and heart failure hospitalization in patients with and without diabetes. In addition to inhibiting glucose reabsorption, SGLT2 inhibitors decrease proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, possibly leading to transient natriuresis. We review the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitor's natriuretic and osmotic diuretic effects mediate their cardioprotective effects. The degree to which these benefits are related to changes in sodium, independent of the kidney, is currently unknown. Aside from effects on osmotically active sodium, we explore the intriguing possibility that SGLT2 inhibitors could also modulate nonosmotic sodium storage. This alternative hypothesis is based on emerging literature that challenges the traditional 2-compartment model of sodium balance to provide support for a 3-compartment model that includes the binding of sodium to glycosaminoglycans, such as those in muscles and skin. This recent research on nonosmotic sodium storage, as well as direct cardiac effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, provides possibilities for other ways in which SGLT2 inhibitors might mitigate heart failure risk. Overall, we review the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on sodium balance and sensitivity, cardiac tissue, interstitial fluid and plasma volume, and nonosmotic sodium storage.", "journal": "Journal of cardiac failure", "date": "2021-07-22", "authors": ["PetterBjornstad", "Peter JGreasley", "David CWheeler", "Glenn MChertow", "Anna MariaLangkilde", "Hiddo J LHeerspink", "Dani\u00ebL HVan Raalte"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardfail.2021.07.003"}

High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) results showed that 10 kinds of substances were identified in PSPA and the PSPA was mainly composed of cyanidin (62.9%) and peonidin (21.46%). In in vitro experiments, PSPA reduced the excessive release of inflammatory factors (NO and TNF-\u03b1) induced by DOX and decreased the secretion of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) caused by myocardial injury. In in vivo experiments, PSPA inhibited the release of NO and MDA levels in heart tissue. Meanwhile, mice treated with PSPA decreased the levels of LDH, CK, TNF-\u03b1, and TMAO in serum and heart tissue when compared with the DOX group. In addition, the histopathological results of the heart tissue also showed a protective effect of PSPA on the pathological changes in heart. These results provide a reference for the application of PSPA as a functional food to intervene in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The effects of anthocyanins from purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPA) on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity were investigated in vitro and in vivo.

Besides the structural functions, it also plays a role as a central transducer of the canonical Wnt signaling cascade, regulating nearly four hundred genes related to various cellular processes. Recently the immune functions of \u03b2-catenin during pathogenic invasion have gained more attention. In the present study, we elucidated the immune function of fish \u03b2-catenin by identifying and characterizing the \u03b2-catenin homolog (PhCat\u03b2) from redlip mullet, Planiliza haematocheila. The complete open reading frame of PhCat\u03b2 consists of 2352 bp, which encodes a putative \u03b2-catenin homolog (molecular weight: 85.7\u00a0kDa). Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed that \u03b2-catenin is highly conserved in vertebrates. Phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated the close evolutionary relationship between PhCat\u03b2 and other fish \u03b2-catenin counterparts. The tissue distribution analysis showed the highest mRNA expression of PhCat\u03b2 in heart tissues of the redlip mullet under normal physiological conditions. While in response to pathogenic stress, the PhCat\u03b2 transcription level was dramatically increased in the spleen and gill tissues. The overexpression of PhCat\u03b2 stimulated M2 polarization and cell proliferation of murine RAW 264.7 macrophage. In fish cells, the overexpression of PhCat\u03b2 resulted in a significant upregulation of antiviral gene transcription and vice versa. Moreover, the overexpression of PhCat\u03b2 could inhibit the replication of VHSV in FHM cells.

{"title": "Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Protect Cardiomyocytes from Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiomyopathy by Upregulating Survivin Expression via the miR-199a-3p-Akt-Sp1/p53 Signaling Pathway.", "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity is associated with the long-term clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX) in cancer patients. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) including exosomes have been suggested for the treatment of various diseases, including ischemic diseases. However, the effects and functional mechanism of MSC-sEVs in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy have not been clarified. Here, MSC-sEVs were isolated from murine embryonic mesenchymal progenitor cell (C3H/10T1/2) culture media, using ultrafiltration. H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells were pretreated with MSC-sEVs and then exposed to DOX. For in vivo studies, male C57BL/6 mice were administered MSC-sEVs intravenously, prior to a single dose of DOX (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The mice were sacrificed 14 days after DOX treatment. The results showed that MSC-sEVs protected cardiomyocytes from DOX-induced cell death. H9c2 cells treated with DOX showed downregulation of both phosphorylated Akt and survivin, whereas the treatment of MSC-sEVs recovered expression, indicating their anti-apoptotic effects. Three microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR 199a-3p, miR 424-5p, and miR 21-5p) in MSC-sEVs regulated the Akt-Sp1/p53 signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes. Among them, miR 199a-3p was involved in regulating survivin expression, which correlated with the anti-apoptotic effects of MSC-sEVs. In in vivo studies, the echocardiographic results showed that the group treated with MSC-sEVs recovered from DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, showing improvement of both the left ventricle fraction and ejection fraction. MSC-sEVs treatment also increased both survivin and B-cell lymphoma 2 expression in heart tissue compared to the DOX group. Our results demonstrate that MSC-sEVs have protective effects against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy by upregulating survivin expression, which is mediated by the regulation of Akt activation by miRNAs in MSC-sEVs.

Here, we investigated the role of oxytocin and the c-Myc pathway in cardiac remodeling in neonatal rats undergoing cardiac apical resection. We have utilized a knockout of oxytocin receptor (OTR) with OTR-shRNA. A neonatal rat model of cardiac resection (\u224810%-15%) was first established. The protein levels of OTR and c-Myc and the expression of cyclin d1 and c-Myc genes were then evaluated in the cardiac tissues at 1, 7, and 21 days after cardiac resection. We also analyzed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes through \u03b1-actinin, BrdU, and ki-67 markers. At last, the hemodynamic and electrophysiologic functions were evaluated eight weeks after cardiac resection. At 21 days, the regeneration of cardiomyocytes was repaired among rats in the control and resection groups, while OTR-shRNA groups were failed to improve. Inhibition of OTR failed cardiac regeneration and reduced the number of proliferating cardiomyocytes. The c-Myc protein was significantly reduced in the OTR-shRNA injection hearts.

{"title": "Elastomer-Grafted iPSC-Derived Micro Heart Muscles to Investigate Effects of Mechanical Loading on Physiology.", "abstract": "Mechanical loading plays a critical role in cardiac pathophysiology. Engineered heart tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) allow rigorous investigations of the molecular and pathophysiological consequences of mechanical cues. However, many engineered heart muscle models have complex fabrication processes and require large cell numbers, making it difficult to use them together with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to study the influence of mechanical loading on pharmacology and genotype-phenotype relationships. To address this challenge, simple and scalable iPSC-derived micro-heart-muscle arrays (\u03bcHM) have been developed. \"Dog-bone-shaped\" molds define the boundary conditions for tissue formation. Here, we extend the \u03bcHM model by forming these tissues on elastomeric substrates with stiffnesses spanning from 5 to 30 kPa. Tissue assembly was achieved by covalently grafting fibronectin to the substrate. Compared to \u03bcHM formed on plastic, elastomer-grafted \u03bcHM exhibited a similar gross morphology, sarcomere assembly, and tissue alignment. When these tissues were formed on substrates with different elasticity, we observed marked shifts in contractility. Increased contractility was correlated with increases in calcium flux and a slight increase in cell size. This afterload-enhanced \u03bcHM system enables mechanical control of \u03bcHM and real-time tissue traction force microscopy for cardiac physiology measurements, providing a dynamic tool for studying pathophysiology and pharmacology.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2021-07-20", "authors": ["JingxuanGuo", "Daniel WSimmons", "GhiskaRamahdita", "Mary KMunsell", "KasoorelopeOguntuyo", "BrennanKandalaft", "BrandonRios", "MissyPear", "DavidSchuftan", "HuanzhuJiang", "Spencer PLake", "Guy MGenin", "NathanielHuebsch"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00318"}

{"title": "Cardiomyocyte-produced miR-339-5p mediates pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked genetic disease characterized by severe, progressive muscle wasting. Cardiomyopathy has emerged as a leading cause of death in patients with DMD. The mechanisms contributing to DMD cardiac disease remain under investigation and specific therapies available are lacking. Our prior work has shown that DMD-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (DMD-iCMs) are vulnerable to oxidative stress injury and chronic exposure to DMD-secreted exosomes impaired the cell's ability to protect against stress. In this study, we sought to examine a mechanism by which DMD cardiac exosomes impair cellular response through altering important stress-responsive genes in the recipient cells. Here, we report that DMD-iCMs secrete exosomes containing altered microRNA (miR) profiles in comparison to healthy controls. In particular, miR-339-5p was upregulated in DMD-iCMs, DMD exosomes and mdx mouse cardiac tissue. Restoring dystrophin in DMD-iCMs improved the cellular response to stress and was associated with downregulation of miR-339-5p, suggesting that it is disease-specific. Knockdown of miR-339-5p was associated with increased expression of MDM2, GSK3A and MAP2K3, which are genes involved in important stress-responsive signaling pathways. Finally, knockdown of miR-339-5p led to mitochondrial protection and a reduction in cell death in DMD-iCMs, indicating miR-339-5p is involved in direct modulation of stress-responsiveness. Together, these findings identify a potential mechanism by which exosomal miR-339-5p may be modulating cell signaling pathways that are important for robust stress responses. Additionally, these exosomal miRs may provide important disease-specific targets for future therapeutic advancements for the management and diagnosis of DMD cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2021-07-17", "authors": ["MelanieGartz", "MargaretBeatka", "Mariah JProm", "Jennifer LStrande", "Michael WLawlor"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddab199"}

The question of whether direct myocardial fructose exposure and upregulated fructose metabolism have potential to induce cardiac fructose toxicity in metabolic stress settings arises. Unlike tightly-regulated glucose metabolism, fructose bypasses the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase, and proceeds through glycolysis in an unregulated manner.

{"title": "Exploring cardioprotective potential of esculetin against isoproterenol induced myocardial toxicity in rats: in vivo and in vitro evidence.", "abstract": "Esculetin is a natural coumarin derivative from various plants with multiple pharmacological effects. Hence, the present study was undertaken to explore the cardio protective potential of esculetin against isoproterenol induced myocardial toxicity in rats.\nThe treatment schedule was fixed for 28\u2009days and the rats were divided into five groups of six each. Rats of group I received the normal saline and served as normal control, group II was received ISO (100\u2009mg/kg body weight) for last two consecutive days of the study and served as disease control. Groups III and IV received esculetin 10 and 20\u2009mg/kg body weight respectively once a day per oral for 28\u2009days along with ISO for last two consecutive days of the study. Cardiac biomarkers such as CK-MB and LDH, membrane bound Na+ /K+ ATPases activity, myocardial lysosomal enzymes activity and tissue antioxidants status were estimated in the heart tissue samples. The histopathological changes in the myocardium were also assessed. Further, DPPH assay was done to evaluate the free radicals scavenging potential of esculetin. Cytoxicity assay, intracellular ROS levels by DCFDA assay and m-RNA expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and NF-\u03baB by quantitative RT-PCR in H9c2 cell lines.\nThe increased levels of CK-MB, LDH, LPO, myocardial lysosomal enzymes and membrane bound Na+ /K+ ATPase levels by ISO administration was significantly increased with concomitant decrease in tissue antioxidant enzymes such as GSH, Catalase, and SOD. Pre-treatment with esculetin for 28\u2009days has significantly decreased the levels of cardiac bio-markers, lysosomal enzymes, membrane bound Na+ /K+ ATPase levels as well as Lipid peroxides which is in contrary to the ISO group. Amelioration of the antioxidant levels were also found in esculetin treated groups. Histopathological examination of heart reveals that myocardial degeneration, mononuclear cell infiltration was noticed in ISO treated rats, whereas the same was restored with esculetin treatment. In H9C2 cell lines esculetin could effectively reduced intracellular ROS inhibition and m-RNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and NF-\u03baB to prevent apoptosis or cell necrosis.\nThe study provides the evidence of cardioprotective potentials of esculetin against isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction by antioxidant and myocardial membrane stabilization along with in vitro protection from arsenic induced ROS cell necrosis or apoptosis in H9C2 cells.", "journal": "BMC pharmacology & toxicology", "date": "2021-07-17", "authors": ["Chitikela PPullaiah", "Vinod KNelson", "SushmaRayapu", "Narasimha KumarG V", "ThyagarajuKedam"], "doi": "10.1186/s40360-021-00510-0\n10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60042-X\n10.1016/j.jmau.2016.09.001\n10.4196/kjpp.2019.23.3.203\n10.2217/14622416.6.5.503\n10.1271/bbb.67.631\n10.15430/JCP.2015.20.2.106\n10.1007/s00395-019-0725-2\n10.18632/oncotarget.12930\n10.1186/s12906-020-03118-9\n10.1007/s12035-017-0853-3\n10.1016/j.cbi.2016.10.013\n10.1002/ptr.2549\n10.1211/jpp.60.1.0016\n10.1042/bj1550599\n10.1042/bj0650389\n10.1530/jrf.0.0570043\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)45228-9\n10.1016/0304-4165(79)90289-7\n10.1016/S0076-6879(84)05016-3\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.1980.tb09022.x\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2010.07.006\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.195\n10.1016/j.cbi.2008.12.012\n10.1038/aps.2017.50\n10.1007/s12011-015-0289-4\n10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00878.x\n10.1007/BF02980270\n10.1007/s00044-010-9426-y\n10.1186/s12943-016-0550-2\n10.3892/ijmm.2016.2834\n10.1002/jcb.27643\n10.1016/j.hlc.2015.11.005\n10.3892/ijmm.2017.2987\n10.26355/eurrev_201806_15282\n10.1016/j.arbres.2017.09.005\n10.3109/10715762.2015.1087643\n10.1080/13880209.2016.1216134\n10.1016/0022-2828(75)90132-7\n10.1016/j.tox.2007.01.006\n10.3109/15376516.2014.1003421\n10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.017\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.09.033"}

Compared to the commonly used aqueous coating, here, PPy was blended into silk fibroin (SF) solution to electrospin conductive PPy-encapsulated SF nanofibers. Combinations of various SF concentrations (5%, 7%, and 12%) and different PPy-to-SF ratios (15:85, 30:70, and 40:60) were compared. PPy reduced the fiber diameter (0.431\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.060\u00a0\u03bcm), better-mimicking the myocardium fibrils. Conductive mats with 7% SF showed the closest mechanical properties (1.437\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.044\u00a0MPa) to the native myocardium; meanwhile, a PPy-to-SF ratio of 15:85 exhibited sufficient electrical conductivity for cardiomyocytes (CMs). In vitro studies using three different types of CM demonstrated that the hybrid mats support CM contraction. Primary neonatal rat CMs on the mat with a PPy-to-SF ratio of 15:85 were elongated and orientated anisotropically with locally organized sarcomeric striations. By contrast, human-induced pluripotent stem cell derived-CMs on the mat with a PPy-to-SF ratio of 30:70 exhibited the strongest contractions. Contraction synchrony was further improved by external stimulation.

{"title": "Intercalated disk nanoscale structure regulates cardiac conduction.", "abstract": "The intercalated disk (ID) is a specialized subcellular region that provides electrical and mechanical connections between myocytes in the heart. The ID has a clearly defined passive role in cardiac tissue, transmitting mechanical forces and electrical currents between cells. Recent studies have shown that Na+ channels, the primary current responsible for cardiac excitation, are preferentially localized at the ID, particularly within nanodomains such as the gap junction-adjacent perinexus and mechanical junction-associated adhesion-excitability nodes, and that perturbations of ID structure alter cardiac conduction. This suggests that the ID may play an important, active role in regulating conduction. However, the structures of the ID and intercellular cleft are not well characterized and, to date, no models have incorporated the influence of ID structure on conduction in cardiac tissue. In this study, we developed an approach to generate realistic finite element model (FEM) meshes replicating nanoscale of the ID structure, based on experimental measurements from transmission electron microscopy images. We then integrated measurements of the intercellular cleft electrical conductivity, derived from the FEM meshes, into a novel cardiac tissue model formulation. FEM-based calculations predict that the distribution of cleft conductances is sensitive to regional changes in ID structure, specifically the intermembrane separation and gap junction distribution. Tissue-scale simulations predict that ID structural heterogeneity leads to significant spatial variation in electrical polarization within the intercellular cleft. Importantly, we found that this heterogeneous cleft polarization regulates conduction by desynchronizing the activation of postjunctional Na+ currents. Additionally, these heterogeneities lead to a weaker dependence of conduction velocity on gap junctional coupling, compared with prior modeling formulations that neglect or simplify ID structure. Further, we found that disruption of local ID nanodomains can either slow or enhance conduction, depending on gap junctional coupling strength. Our study therefore suggests that ID nanoscale structure can play a significant role in regulating cardiac conduction.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2021-07-16", "authors": ["NicolaeMoise", "Heather LStruckman", "CelineDagher", "RengasayeeVeeraraghavan", "Seth HWeinberg"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.202112897\n10.1093/cvr/cvu195\n10.1152/ajpheart.00079.2007\n10.1161/01.RES.0000144125.61927.1c\n10.1007/s00371-010-0416-3\n10.1091/mbc.e05-12-1109\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2006.10.015\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2005.06.019\n10.1007/s00232-007-9046-8\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.11.004\n10.1007/s00424-015-1698-0\n10.1002/nme.2579\n10.1242/jcs.99.1.41\n10.1161/CIRCEP.116.004400\n10.1113/JP275351\n10.1074/jbc.M112.412122\n10.1093/europace/eus267\n10.1137/S1064827595287997\n10.1161/01.RES.0000046237.54156.0A\n10.1007/BF00227885\n10.1093/cvr/cvv182\n10.1073/pnas.1010154107\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.07.016\n10.1161/01.RES.68.6.1501\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000121421.61896.24\n10.1152/ajpheart.01218.2010\n10.1038/s41598-020-77562-5\n10.1007/s003800200030\n10.1016/S0006-3495(94)80460-6\n10.1073/pnas.0801089105\n10.1002/cphy.c110051\n10.1016/j.bpj.2020.04.014\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.12.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.228312\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.12.001\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01228\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00398\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.10.003\n10.1007/s00232-012-9465-z\n10.1007/BF00373136\n10.1109/TBME.1978.326270\n10.1016/0167-5273(90)90030-9\n10.1002/ar.a.20109\n10.1161/01.RES.86.3.302\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.10.023\n10.1016/0022-5193(77)90114-X\n10.1161/01.RES.0000045656.34731.6D\n10.1038/s41598-020-76681-3\n10.3389/fphy.2017.00048\n10.1161/01.RES.0000025638.24255.AA\n10.1007/s00418-018-1657-x\n10.1111/jmi.12855\n10.1091/mbc.e16-02-0125\n10.1007/s00424-016-1861-2\n10.7554/eLife.37610\n10.1007/s00424-014-1675-z\n10.1152/ajpheart.00868.2011\n10.1161/01.RES.80.5.673\n10.1093/cvr/cvw259\n10.1063/1.5134447\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.02.029\n10.1063/1.4999602\n10.1113/jphysiol.1986.sp015934\n10.1085/jgp.95.6.1061\n10.1007/s00018-013-1374-5\n10.1161/01.RES.59.2.143\n10.1679/aohc.59.453"}

{"title": "Systems Immunology Analysis Reveals the Contribution of Pulmonary and Extrapulmonary Tissues to the Immunopathogenesis of Severe COVID-19 Patients.", "abstract": "As one of the current global health conundrums, COVID-19 pandemic caused a dramatic increase of cases exceeding 79 million and 1.7 million deaths worldwide. Severe presentation of COVID-19 is characterized by cytokine storm and chronic inflammation resulting in multi-organ dysfunction. Currently, it is unclear whether extrapulmonary tissues contribute to the cytokine storm mediated-disease exacerbation. In this study, we applied systems immunology analysis to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung, liver, kidney, and heart tissues and the potential contribution of these tissues to cytokines production. Notably, genes associated with neutrophil-mediated immune response (e.g. CXCL1) were particularly upregulated in lung, whereas genes associated with eosinophil-mediated immune response (e.g. CCL11) were particularly upregulated in heart tissue. In contrast, immune responses mediated by monocytes, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells were almost similarly dysregulated in all tissue types. Focused analysis of 14 cytokines classically upregulated in COVID-19 patients revealed that only some of these cytokines are dysregulated in lung tissue, whereas the other cytokines are upregulated in extrapulmonary tissues (e.g. IL6 and IL2RA). Investigations of potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates the immune response and cytokine production revealed a marked dysregulation of NF-\u03baB signaling particularly CBM complex and the NF-\u03baB inhibitor BCL3. Moreover, overexpression of mucin family genes (e.g. MUC3A, MUC4, MUC5B, MUC16, and MUC17) and HSP90AB1 suggest that the exacerbated inflammation activated pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues remodeling. In addition, we identified multiple sets of immune response associated genes upregulated in a tissue-specific manner (DCLRE1C, CHI3L1, and PARP14 in lung; APOA4, NFASC, WIPF3, and CD34 in liver; LILRA5, ISG20, S100A12, and HLX in kidney; and ASS1 and PTPN1 in heart). Altogether, these findings suggest that the cytokines storm triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection is potentially the result of dysregulated cytokine production by inflamed pulmonary and extrapulmonary (e.g. liver, kidney, and heart) tissues.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2021-07-16", "authors": ["Sarah MusaHammoudeh", "Arabella MusaHammoudeh", "Poorna ManasaBhamidimarri", "HabibaAl Safar", "BassamMahboub", "AxelK\u00fcnstner", "HaukeBusch", "RabihHalwani", "QutaybaHamid", "MohamedRahmani", "RifatHamoudi"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2021.595150\n10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321013\n10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.05.013\n10.1007/s11684-020-0754-0\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004\n10.1007/s13238-020-00718-6\n10.4269/ajtmh.20-0279\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.05.003\n10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30076-x\n10.7326/l20-0227%m32282871\n10.1016/j.jhep.2020.05.002\n10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120\n10.1016/j.cca.2020.06.017\n10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30920-x\n10.1101/2020.07.30.20165241\n10.1016/s2352-3026(20)30217-9\n10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100554\n10.1016/j.immuni.2020.11.017\n10.1186/1471-2164-5-87\n10.1093/nar/gkq405\n10.1093/biostatistics/kxr031\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1186/s12859-015-0611-3\n10.1038/s41467-019-09234-6\n10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.027\n10.1038/srep33123\n10.1074/jbc.271.13.7725\n10.1038/s41598-018-27710-9\n10.1002/eji.200838660\n10.4049/jimmunol.179.9.5897\n10.1155/2014/480941\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02775\n10.3389/fimmu.2013.00194\n10.1016/j.immuni.2018.07.012\n10.1189/jlb.1006645\n10.3389/fmed.2018.00049\n10.3389/fimmu.2013.00182\n10.4049/jimmunol.1800696\n10.1155/2018/6519465\n10.1093/cid/ciaa410\n10.1093/cid/ciaa453\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01206\n10.1038/s41577-018-0087-2\n10.1074/jbc.M107373200\n10.1074/jbc.M300009200\n10.1074/jbc.M112.397075\n10.3390/molecules23112846\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00058\n10.1152/ajpendo.00475.2009\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.07.032\n10.4049/jimmunol.1701117\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.04.058\n10.1182/blood-2006-10-050096\n10.1164/rccm.201209-1602OC\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1008093\n10.1155/2012/368938\n10.1186/1471-2172-13-21\n10.1038/cddis.2012.83\n10.1189/jlb.1AB0714-365R\n10.1073/pnas.1906431116\n10.1038/cddis.2014.90\n10.3390/cells9061383\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.026\n10.1038/s41569-020-0360-5\n10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.021\n10.1177/2050640620924157\n10.1038/nature23669\n10.1038/s41423-020-0401-3\n10.1038/s41577-020-0331-4\n10.1101/2020.07.21.212639\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02078\n10.1007/s13238-020-00752-4\n10.1183/13993003.congress-2018.PA4798\n10.3390/jcm8091447\n10.1371/journal.pone.0054455\n10.1016/j.gene.2015.08.063\n10.1038/labinvest.2012.127\n10.1038/s41388-018-0532-5\n10.1159/000508233"}
{"title": "Modulation of Perturbed Cardiac Metabolism in Rats Under High-Altitude Hypoxia by Combination Treatment With L-carnitine and Trimetazidine.", "abstract": "High-altitude hypoxia has long been recognized as a vital etiology for high-altitude illnesses. High-altitude myocardial injury (HAMI) usually occurs in people who suffered from high-altitude exposure. To date, the molecular mechanism of HAMI remains elusive, which seriously hinders the prevention and treatment of HAMI. L-carnitine and trimetazidine are classic cardiovascular protective medicines. In this study, we used the metabolomic method, based on GC/MS, to explore the changes in metabolites in rats exposed to high-altitude hypoxia and then illustrate the metabolic pathways associated with the modulatory effect of L-carnitine combined with trimetazidine on rats with high-altitude exposure. The results showed that metabolites in the myocardium in rats under high-altitude hypoxia were markedly changed, such as branched-chain amino acids (BCAA, leucine, isoleucine, and valine), taurine, succinic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), while L-carnitine combined with trimetazidine modulated and improved the abnormal changes in energy substances caused by high-altitude hypoxia. L-carnitine mainly promoted the metabolism of fatty acids, while trimetazidine enhanced the glycolysis process. The combined administration of the two components not only increased the metabolism of fatty acids but also promoted aerobic glycolysis. Meanwhile, it contributed to the decrease in the elevation in some of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, decrease in the production of 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and relief of the abnormal energy metabolism process in organisms and the cardiac tissue. Our analysis delineates the landscape of the metabolites in the myocardial tissue of rats that were exposed to high altitude. Moreover, L-carnitine combined with trimetazidine can relieve the HAMI through modulated and improved abnormal changes in energy substances caused by high-altitude hypoxia.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-07-16", "authors": ["HebingXie", "GangXu", "JiyeAa", "ShuhuaGu", "YuqiGao"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.671161\n10.1002/iub.1646\n10.1016/j.mito.2018.02.009\n10.1016/j.tjem.2019.09.002\n10.1177/0148607115595980\n10.1007/s003950050167\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.01.016\n10.1097/MJT.0000000000000180\n10.1016/j.tmaid.2014.02.004\n10.2174/138161208786071245\n10.1016/0006-291X(92)92355-2\n10.1038/nrm.2016.25\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.05.063\n10.1113/EP085317\n10.2174/138920011796504536\n10.1136/adc.74.6.475\n10.1016/j.lfs.2017.12.015\n10.1016/j.cbi.2015.04.022\n10.1016/j.exger.2018.12.019\n10.3390/molecules25215033"}

TODPD is characterized by skeletal defects, skin fibromata and dysmorphic facial features. So far, only a single recurrent variant (c.5217G>A;p.Val1724_Thr1739del) in FLNA has found to be responsible for TODPD. We identified a novel c.5217+5G>C variant in FLNA in a female proband with skeletal defects, skin fibromata, interstitial lung disease, epilepsy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. This variant causes mis-splicing of exon 31 predicting the production of a FLNA-protein with an in-frame-deletion of 16 residues identical to the miss-splicing-effect of the recurrent TODPD c.5217G>A variant. This mis-spliced transcript was explicitly detected in heart tissue, but was absent from blood, skin, and lung. X-inactivation analyses showed extreme skewing with almost complete inactivation of the mutated allele (>90%) in these tissues, except for heart. The mother of the proband, who also has fibromata and skeletal abnormalities, is also carrier of the FLNA-variant and was diagnosed with noncompaction cardiomyopathy after cardiac screening. No other relevant variants in cardiomyopathy-related genes were found. Here we describe a novel variant in FLNA (c.5217+5G>C) as the second pathogenic variant responsible for TODPD.

To explore candidate targets and mechanisms of DQTT on AMI, a network pharmacology-based analysis was performed on absorbed prototype compounds of DQTT in rat plasma. Target prediction from network analysis indicated that the arachidonic acid pathway might contribute to the therapeutic effects of DQTT on AMI, and the regulatory effects on cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) were validated using an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation model established on H9c2 cardiomyocytes. To further explore the action mechanisms of DQTT, 38 oxylipins were quantitatively analyzed among high, medium, and low doses of DQTT using a rat AMI model with an ultra high performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ/MS) detection system. As attenuation was observed in AMI with DQTT treatment, the perturbed arachidonic acid metabolome was partly restored in a dose-dependent fashion with a significant elevation of anti-inflammatory metabolites, while pro-inflammatory lipids were decreased. Cytokine array analysis also supported the anti-inflammatory effects of DQTT, as significant down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed. The analysis of ischemic heart tissues demonstrated that COX and LOX, the inflammation-induced catalytic enzymes of arachidonic acid metabolism, were inhibited on both gene expression and protein level. These results confirmed that DQTT could restore the arachidonic acid metabolome to maintain an anti-inflammatory profile against the ischemic tissue injury and support that DQTT can be a promising medicinal therapy against AMI.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2021-07-13", "authors": ["HaijuanZhi", "ZijiaZhang", "YanpingDeng", "BingpengYan", "ZhenweiLi", "WenyongWu", "ZijingFeng", "MinLei", "HualiLong", "JinjunHou", "DeanGuo", "WanyingWu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153616"}

However, the redox environment of the heart has not been evaluated thoroughly after MIRI, which limits precise redox intervention. In this study, we developed the redox environment metabolomic evaluation (REME) method to analyze the redox metabolites of the heart after MIRI. Based on the targeted metabolomics strategy, we established a detection panel for 22 redox-related molecules, including the major redox couples nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD+), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH/NADP+), and glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG), reactive oxygen and nitrogen species-related molecules, and some lipid peroxidation products. The high sensitivity and specificity of the method make it suitable for evaluating the endogenous redox environment. The REME method showed that the heart tissue in a MIRI mouse model had a different redox profile from that in the control group. Different redox species changed in different ways. The ratios of GSSG/GSH and NADP+/NADPH increased, but the levels of both NAD+ and NADH decreased in the risk area of the infarcted heart after reperfusion. In addition, some reactive nitrogen species-related metabolites (tetrahydrobiopterin, arginine, and S-nitrosoglutathione) decreased and some lipid peroxides (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal, and benzaldehyde) increased. The redox metabolites GSH, GSSG, NADPH, NAD+, S-nitrosoglutathione, arginine, and tetrahydrobiopterin had a positive correlation with the ejection fraction and a negative correlation with the level of lactate dehydrogenase in plasma.

Abnormal lipid metabolism plays an important role in the occurrence and development of DCM. Huangqi Shengmai Yin (HSY) has previously been shown to alleviate signs of heart disease. Here, we investigated whether HSY could improve cardiomyopathy caused by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and improve abnormal lipid metabolism in the diabetic heart.

The changes in the cardiac conduction system, histopathology, blood myocardial injury indices, and lipid content and expression of proteins related to lipid metabolism were evaluated. Our results showed that HSY could improve electrocardiogram; decrease the serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, and BNP; alleviate histopathological changes in cardiac tissue; and decrease myocardial lipid content in T1DM mice.

Here we applied a modified method to generate ultrafine uniformly-aligned composite gelatin/polycaprolactone fibers that mimic functional heart tissue. We tested the physical properties of these fibers and analyzed how these composite fibrous scaffolds affected growth and cardiac lineage differentiation in rat adipose-derived stem cells (rADSCs). We found that uniformly aligned composite fiber scaffolds had an anisotropic arrangement, functional mechanical properties, and strong hydrophilicity. The anisotropic scaffolds improved cell attachment, viability, and proliferative capacity of ADSCs over randomly-aligned scaffolds. Furthermore, uniformly aligned composite fiber scaffolds increased the efficiency of cardiomyogenic differentiation, but might reduce the efficiency of cardiac conduction system cell differentiation in ADSCs compared to randomly-oriented scaffolds and tissue culture polystyrene. However, the randomly-oriented composite scaffolds showed no obviously facilitated effects over tissue culture polystyrene on the two cells' differentiation process. The above results indicate that the scaffold fiber alignment has a greater effect on cell differentiation than the composition of the scaffold. Together, the uniformly-aligned composite fibers displayed excellent physical and biocompatible properties, promoted ADSC proliferation, and played distinct roles in the differentiation of cardiomyogenic cells and cardiac conduction system cells from ADSCs.

However, its function in heart failure (HF) remains unclear. Our study aimed to investigate its involvement in heart failure.\nIn this study, the mouse HF model was successfully constructed through transverse aortic constriction (TAC) operation. Changes in mRNA and protein levels in isolated myocytes and heart tissues were examined using qRT-PCR, Western blot and Immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescent staining. Changes in cardiac functions were examined using ultrasound. Interactions between miR-125b and BAK1 was analyzed using the luciferase reporter assay. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated using the TUNEL staining.\nWe found that miR-125b expression was significantly downregulated in myocardial tissues of HF mice. Moreover, miR-125b upregulation in HF mice injected with agomir-125b efficiently ameliorated cardiac function. Further, miR-125b upregulation significantly decreased the protein levels of apoptosis-related makers c-caspase 3 and Bax, while increased Bcl-2 expression. In addition, BAK1 was identified as a direct target of miR-125b. As expected, BAK1 overexpression observably reversed the effect of agomir-125b on cardiac function and on the expression of apoptosis-related makers in the heart tissues of HF mice.\nTaken together, miR-125b overexpression efficiently attenuated cardiac function injury of HF mice by targeting BAK1 through inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis, suggesting that miR-125b/BAK1 axis might be a potential target for the diagnosis or treatment of HF.", "journal": "Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)", "date": "2021-07-10", "authors": ["BeiZhang", "ShanyongMao", "XingdeLiu", "ShaLi", "HaiyanZhou", "YingGu", "WupengLiu", "LeiFu", "ChunyanLiao", "PengzhenWang"], "doi": "10.1186/s10020-021-00328-w\n10.1016/j.amjms.2016.08.026\n10.1038/s41419-018-1021-z\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.11.003\n10.1002/cbin.10677\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001878\n10.1016/j.jchf.2013.10.006\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.01.119\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2015.04.026\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.019\n10.1186/s11658-019-0165-x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.190\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.02.021\n10.1016/j.matbio.2021.05.005\n10.1038/ncomms4303\n10.1128/IAI.00914-08\n10.1016/0735-1097(94)00531-T\n10.1023/A:1013797722156\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-17-0385\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.04.583\n10.1182/blood-2016-06-721027\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.146\n10.1024/0040-5930/a000235\n10.1016/j.hfc.2016.07.001\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66621-4\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31071-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018174\n10.1172/JCI123135\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.01.068\n10.1007/s11897-017-0362-8\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.05.002\n10.1002/cphy.c140055\n10.1002/ejhf.495\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.10094\n10.1007/978-1-4939-6524-3_1\n10.1038/cddis.2013.272\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv713\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.01.025\n10.1186/s12906-019-2569-6\n10.1038/ncomms13710\n10.1002/jcp.26396\n10.1007/s00380-018-01336-3\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.07.034\n10.1002/path.4804\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.05.018"}

Dexmedetomidine has a cardioprotective effect from I/R injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dexmedetomidine preconditioning induced cardioprotection is related to suppression of degranulation of cardiac mast cell. Both in vivo and in vitro experimental results revealed that hemodynamic disorder, arrhythmia, infarct size, histopathological score, and mast cell degranulation were dramatically increased in I/R injury groups compared with non-I/R groups, and mastocyte secretagogue compound 48/80 aggravated these damages, but it can be improved by dexmedetomidine preconditioning. Similarly, compound 48/80 increased levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and tryptase, cardiomyocytes apoptosis, and expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-\u03baB p65) in cardiac tissues induced by I/R injury, but it can be partially decreased by dexmedetomidine pretreatment. Compound 48/80 inhibited proliferation of H9C2(2-1) and RBL-2H3, exacerbated apoptosis of H9C2(2-1), and elevated levels of cTnI and tryptase, while both of which were abolished by dexmedetomidine pretreatment.

The expression of \u03b1-SMA and the size change of engineered tissue were analyzed to evaluate the feasibility of adding bFGF to regulate \u03b1-SMA expression and shrinkage of constructs. In addition, cardiac-specific examinations were performed to evaluate the effect of bFGF on cardiac tissue formation.\nSupplementation with bFGF efficiently relieved shrinkage of engineered tissue by downregulating the expression of \u03b1-SMA at both the cellular and 3D tissue levels.

However, traditional sample preparation methods are time-consuming, typically including overnight tryptic digestion, extensive sample cleanup to remove MS-incompatible surfactants, and offline sample fractionation to reduce proteome complexity prior to online liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Thus, there is a need for a fast, robust, and reproducible method for protein identification and quantification from complex proteomes. Herein, we developed an ultrafast bottom-up proteomics method enabled by Azo, a photocleavable, MS-compatible surfactant that effectively solubilizes proteins and promotes rapid tryptic digestion, combined with the Bruker timsTOF Pro, which enables deeper proteome coverage through trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) and parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) of peptides. We applied this method to analyze the complex human cardiac proteome and identified nearly 4000 protein groups from as little as 1 mg of human heart tissue in a single one-dimensional LC-TIMS-MS/MS run with high reproducibility. Overall, we anticipate this ultrafast, robust, and reproducible bottom-up method empowered by both Azo and the timsTOF Pro will be generally applicable and greatly accelerate the throughput of large-scale quantitative proteomic studies.

We recently reported that the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM21 interacts and ubiquitylates p62 and negatively regulates the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. Therefore, we sought to determine the role TRIM21 in cardiotoxicity induced by oxidative damage.\nUsing TRIM21 knockout mice, we examined the effects of TRIM21 on cardiotoxicity induced by two oxidative damage models: the doxorubicin treatment model and the Left Anterior Descending (LAD) model. We also explored the underlying mechanism by RNA-sequencing of the heart tissues, and by treating the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), immortalized rat cardiomyocyte line H9c2, and immortalized human cardiomyocyte line AC16 with doxorubicin.\nTRIM21 knockout mice are protected from heart failure and fatality in both the doxorubicin and LAD models. Hearts of doxorubicin-treated wild-type mice exhibit deformed mitochondria and elevated level of lipid peroxidation reminiscent of ferroptosis, which is alleviated in TRIM21 knockout hearts. Mechanistically, TRIM21-deficient heart tissues and cultured MEFs and H9c2 cells display enhanced p62 sequestration of Keap1 and are protected from doxorubicin-induced ferroptosis. Reconstitution of wild-type but not the E3 ligase-dead and the p62 binding-deficient TRIM21 mutants impedes the protection from doxorubicin-induced cell death.\nOur study demonstrates that TRIM21 ablation protects doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and illustrates a new function of TRIM21 in ferroptosis, and suggests TRIM21 as a therapeutic target for reducing chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity.\nNIH (CA129536; DK108989): data collection, analysis.

{"title": "Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 20 aggravates angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling via the EGFR-AKT pathway.", "abstract": "Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 20 (ZBTB20) play an important role in glucose and lipid homeostasis. ZBTB20 was shown to be a crucial protein for the maintenance of cardiac contractile function. However, the role of ZBTB20 in cardiac response remodeling has not been elucidated. Thus, this study aimed to explore the role of ZBTB20 in cardiac remodeling following angiotensin II insult. Mice were subjected to angiotensin II infusion to induce a cardiac adverse remodeling model. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) 9 system was used to deliver ZBTB20 to the mouse heart. Here, we demonstrate that ZBTB20 expression is elevated in angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling and in response to cardiomyocyte insults. Furthermore, AAV9-mediated overexpression of ZBTB20 caused cardiac wall hypertrophy, chamber dilation, increased fibrosis, and reduced ejection fraction. Additionally, ZBTB20 siRNA protected cardiomyocytes from angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy. Mechanistically, ZBTB20 interferes with EGFR and Akt signaling and modulates the remodeling response. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt counteracts ZBTB20 knockdown-mediated protection of adverse cardiac remodeling. These findings illustrate the role of ZBTB20 in the transition of adverse cardiac remodeling toward heart failure and provide evidence for the molecular programs inducing adverse cardiac remodeling. KEY MESSAGES: ZBTB20 is a transcription factor from the POK family. ZBTB20 is upregulated in heart tissue treated with angiotensin II. ZBTB20 influences cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via the EGFR-Akt pathway. Akt continuous activation leads to similar results to ZBTB20 overexpression.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2021-07-08", "authors": ["FangfangLi", "MiaomiaoDu", "YimingYang", "ZhuWang", "HuZhang", "XiaoyuWang", "QingLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-021-02103-0\n10.3390/cells8101128\n10.1111/jvim.15454\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31808-7\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000462\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.02.029\n10.1007/s00395-018-0669-y\n10.1186/s12860-019-0202-7\n10.1093/cvr/cvy035\n10.1007/s12035-018-1104-y\n10.1038/ncomms14824\n10.4049/jimmunol.2000459\n10.1080/21691401.2019.1670188\n10.1038/s41419-018-0514-0\n10.1096/fj.202000160RR\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003698\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.832782\n10.1161/01.hyp.35.1.193\n10.1159/000491664\n10.1007/s00109-018-1691-0\n10.1038/s41569-018-0007-y\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.06.001\n10.1038/nm738\n10.1371/journal.pone.0186635\n10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155273\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.08.018\n10.7717/peerj.7587\n10.1111/jcmm.12763\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.166710\n10.1038/s41419-017-0187-0\n10.1038/ncb1101-1014"}

{"title": "Carbonic anhydrase IX and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 attenuate cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Prognosis and mortality rate are directly related to infarct size and post-infarction pathological heart remodeling, which can lead to heart failure. Hypoxic MI-affected areas increase the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), inducing infarct size reduction and improving cardiac function. Hypoxia translocates HIF-1 to the nucleus, activating carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) transcription. CAIX regulates myocardial intracellular pH, critical for heart performance. Our objective was to investigate CAIX participation and relation with sodium bicarbonate transporters 1 (NBC1) and HIF-1 in cardiac remodeling after MI. We analyzed this pathway in an \"in vivo\" rat coronary artery ligation model and isolated cardiomyocytes maintained under hypoxia. Immunohistochemical studies revealed an increase in HIF-1 levels after 2 h of infarction. Similar results were observed in 2-h infarcted cardiac tissue (immunoblotting) and in hypoxic cardiomyocytes with a nuclear distribution (confocal microscopy). Immunohistochemical studies showed an increase CAIX in the infarcted area at 2 h, mainly distributed throughout the cell and localized in the plasma membrane at 24 h. Similar results were observed in 2 h in infarcted cardiac tissue (immunoblotting) and in hypoxic cardiomyocytes (confocal microscopy). NBC1 expression increased in cardiac tissue after 2 h of infarction (immunoblotting). CAIX and NBC1 interaction increases in cardiac tissue subjected to MI for 2h when CAIX is present (immunoprecipitation).

{"title": "Liver X Receptor Agonist AZ876 Induces Beneficial Endogenous Cardiac Lipid Reprogramming and Protects Against Isoproterenol-Induced Cardiac Damage.", "abstract": "Background It is known that dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids may improve cardiac function. However, relatively high daily doses are required to achieve sufficient cardiac concentrations of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. The liver X receptor (LXR) is a nuclear hormone receptor and a crucial regulator of lipid homeostasis in mammals. LXR activation has been shown to endogenously reprogram cellular lipid profiles toward increased polyunsaturated fatty acids levels. Here we studied whether LXR lipid reprogramming occurs in cardiac tissue and exerts cardioprotective actions. Methods and Results Male 129SV mice were treated with the LXR agonist AZ876 (20\u00a0\u00b5mol/kg per day) for 11\u00a0days. From day 6, the mice were injected with the nonselective \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol for 4 consecutive days to induce diastolic dysfunction and subendocardial fibrosis while maintaining systolic function. Treatment with isoproterenol led to a marked impairment of global longitudinal strain and the E/e' ratio of transmitral flow to mitral annular velocity, which were both significantly improved by the LXR agonist. Histological examination showed a significant reduction in isoproterenol-induced subendocardial fibrosis by AZ876. Analysis of the cardiac lipid composition by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry revealed a significant increase in cardiac polyunsaturated fatty acids levels and a significant reduction in saturated fatty acids by AZ876. Conclusions The present study provides evidence that the LXR agonist AZ876 prevents subendocardial damage, improves global longitudinal strain and E/e' in a mouse model of isoproterenol-induced cardiac damage, accompanied by an upregulation of cardiac polyunsaturated fatty acids levels.

Eleven male goats were enrolled\u00a0in this study and divided into the control group (n\u2009=\u20094) and CuD group (n\u2009=\u20097), which received copper-reducing dietary regimes for 7\u00a0months. Heart function was evaluated by electrocardiography and echocardiography, and at the end of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed and the cardiac tissues were collected for histopathology and quantitative mRNA expression by real-time PCR. In the treatment group, cardiac measurements revealed increased preload and the existence of cardiac dilatation, and significant cardiac tissue damage by histopathology. Also, the relative mRNA expression of Cu-Ch encoding genes; ATP7A, CTr1, LOX, COX17, as well as ceruloplasmin (CP), troponin I3 (TNNI3), glutathione peroxidase (GPX1), and matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (MMPI1) genes were significantly down-regulated in CuD group. There was a significant correlation between investigated genes and some cardiac function measurements; meanwhile, a significant inverse correlation was observed between histopathological score and ATP7B, CTr1, LOX, and COX17. In conclusion, this study revealed that CuD induces cardiac dilatation and alters the mRNA expression of Cu-Ch genes, in addition to TNNI3, GPX1, and MMPI1 that are considered key factors in clinically undetectable CuD-induced cardiac damage in goats which necessitate further studies for feasibility as biomarkers.", "journal": "Veterinary research communications", "date": "2021-07-07", "authors": ["Ahmed SMandour", "Ahmed EMahmoud", "Asmaa OAli", "KatsuhiroMatsuura", "HaneySamir", "Hend AAbdelmageed", "DanfuMa", "TomohikoYoshida", "LinaHamabe", "AkikoUemura", "GenWatanabe", "RyouTanaka"], "doi": "10.1007/s11259-021-09811-5\n10.2527/jas.2013-6979\n10.1136/openhrt-2018-000784\n10.2527/jas.2011-3888\n10.1152/ajpcell.00132.2018\n10.1007/s12011-010-8858-z\n10.1017/S0954422411000059\n10.1007/s12011-008-8293-6\n10.5713/ajas.2011.11196\n10.2527/jas.2009-1978\n10.1113/expphysiol.2010.055574\n10.2527/jas.2012-5820\n10.1007/BF02240402\n10.1016/j.cmet.2010.04.003\n10.1186/s12899-016-0020-5\n10.1016/S0378-1119(00)00287-0\n10.1074/jbc.M104728200\n10.1136/vr.100192\n10.1177/1535370218773055\n10.1177/1535370218813988\n10.1152/ajpheart.00335.2010\n10.3390/ani10101890\n10.1007/s11356-020-08294-2\n10.3390/ani10122320\n10.1007/s11356-020-11014-5\n10.1074/jbc.M412281200\n10.3923/pjbs.2008.1375.1379\n10.4081/ijas.2007.s2.1029\n10.1007/s12011-018-1476-x\n10.1093/jn/134.5.1003\n10.1007/s11010-009-0157-7\n10.1016/j.bpc.2011.03.010\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.08.002\n10.1007/978-94-007-7500-8_11\n10.5433/1679-0359.2014v35n4p1955\n10.1016/S0921-4488(01)00213-9\n10.1538/expanim1978.28.3_381\n10.3945/an.112.002220\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.01.053\n10.1186/1472-6793-2-1\n10.1294/jes.8.35\n10.1017/S0003356100004980\n10.1186/1475-2840-13-100\n10.1039/c9mt00223e"}
{"title": "Lp-PLA2 inhibition prevents Ang II-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis by blocking macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation.", "abstract": "Macrophage-mediated inflammation plays an important role in hypertensive cardiac remodeling, whereas effective pharmacological treatments targeting cardiac inflammation remain unclear. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) contributes to vascular inflammation-related diseases by mediating macrophage migration and activation. Darapladib, the most advanced Lp-PLA2 inhibitor, has been evaluated in phase III trials in atherosclerosis patients. However, the role of darapladib in inhibiting hypertensive cardiac fibrosis remains unknown. Using a murine angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion-induced hypertension model, we found that Pla2g7 (the gene of Lp-PLA2) was the only upregulated PLA2 gene detected in hypertensive cardiac tissue, and it was primarily localized in heart-infiltrating macrophages. As expected, darapladib significantly prevented Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis, ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiac dysfunction, with potent abatement of macrophage infiltration and inflammatory response. RNA sequencing revealed that darapladib strongly downregulated the expression of genes and signaling pathways related to inflammation, extracellular matrix, and proliferation. Moreover, darapladib substantially reduced the Ang II infusion-induced expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and markedly attenuated caspase-1 activation in cardiac tissues. Furthermore, darapladib ameliorated Ang II-stimulated macrophage migration and IL-1\u03b2 secretion in macrophages by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Darapladib also effectively blocked macrophage-mediated transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. Overall, our study identifies a novel anti-inflammatory and anti-cardiac fibrosis role of darapladib in Lp-PLA2 inhibition, elucidating the protective effects of suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Lp-PLA2 inhibition by darapladib represents a novel therapeutic strategy for hypertensive cardiac damage treatment.", "journal": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "date": "2021-07-07", "authors": ["Si-LinLv", "Zi-FanZeng", "Wen-QiangGan", "Wei-QiWang", "Tie-GangLi", "Yu-FangHou", "ZhengYan", "Ri-XinZhang", "MinYang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41401-021-00703-7"}
{"title": "Integration of transcriptomic data identifies key hallmark genes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) represents one of the most common inherited heart diseases. To identify key molecules involved in the development of HCM, gene expression patterns of the heart tissue samples in HCM patients from multiple microarray and RNA-seq platforms were investigated.\nThe significant genes were obtained through the intersection of two gene sets, corresponding to the identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within the microarray data and within the RNA-Seq data. Those genes were further ranked using minimum-Redundancy Maximum-Relevance feature selection algorithm. Moreover, the genes were assessed by three different machine learning methods for classification, including support vector machines, random forest and k-Nearest Neighbor.\nOutstanding results were achieved by taking exclusively the top eight genes of the ranking into consideration. Since the eight genes were identified as candidate HCM hallmark genes, the interactions between them and known HCM disease genes were explored through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Most candidate HCM hallmark genes were found to have direct or indirect interactions with known HCM diseases genes in the PPI network, particularly the hub genes JAK2 and GADD45A.\nThis study highlights the transcriptomic data integration, in combination with machine learning methods, in providing insight into the key hallmark genes in the genetic etiology of HCM.", "journal": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "date": "2021-07-07", "authors": ["JingXu", "XiangdongLiu", "QimingDai"], "doi": "10.1186/s12872-021-02147-7"}
{"title": "Developing 3D Organized Human Cardiac Tissue within a Microfluidic Platform.", "abstract": "The leading cause of death worldwide persists as cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, modeling the physiological and biological complexity of the heart muscle, the myocardium, is notoriously difficult to accomplish in vitro. Mainly, obstacles lie in the need for human cardiomyocytes (CMs) that are either adult or exhibit adult-like phenotypes and can successfully replicate the myocardium's cellular complexity and intricate 3D architecture. Unfortunately, due to ethical concerns and lack of available primary patient-derived human cardiac tissue, combined with the minimal proliferation of CMs, the sourcing of viable human CMs has been a limiting step for cardiac tissue engineering. To this end, most research has transitioned toward cardiac differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as the primary source of human CMs, resulting in the wide incorporation of hiPSC-CMs within in vitro assays for cardiac tissue modeling. Here in this work, we demonstrate a protocol for developing a 3D mature stem cell-derived human cardiac tissue within a microfluidic device. We specifically explain and visually demonstrate the production of a 3D in vitro anisotropic cardiac tissue-on-a-chip model from hiPSC-derived CMs. We primarily describe a purification protocol to select for CMs, the co-culture of cells with a defined ratio via mixing CMs with human CFs (hCFs), and suspension of this co-culture within the collagen-based hydrogel. We further demonstrate the injection of the cell-laden hydrogel within our well-defined microfluidic device, embedded with staggered elliptical microposts that serve as surface topography to induce a high degree of alignment of the surrounding cells and the hydrogel matrix, mimicking the architecture of the native myocardium. We envision that the proposed 3D anisotropic cardiac tissue-on-chip model is suitable for fundamental biology studies, disease modeling, and, through its use as a screening tool, pharmaceutical testing.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2021-07-06", "authors": ["JaimesonVeldhuizen", "MehdiNikkhah"], "doi": "10.3791/62539"}

{"title": "Heat Shock Proteins: Potential Modulators and Candidate Biomarkers of Peripartum Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a potentially life-threatening condition in which heart failure and systolic dysfunction occur late in pregnancy or within months following delivery. To date, no reliable biomarkers or therapeutic interventions for the condition exist, thus necessitating an urgent need for identification of novel PPCM drug targets and candidate biomarkers. Leads for novel treatments and biomarkers are therefore being investigated worldwide. Pregnancy is generally accompanied by dramatic hemodynamic changes, including a reduced afterload and a 50% increase in cardiac output. These increased cardiac stresses during pregnancy potentially impair protein folding processes within the cardiac tissue. The accumulation of misfolded proteins results in increased toxicity and cardiac insults that trigger heart failure. Under stress conditions, molecular chaperones such as heat shock proteins (Hsps) play crucial roles in maintaining cellular proteostasis. Here, we critically assess the potential role of Hsps in PPCM. We further predict specific associations between the Hsp types Hsp70, Hsp90 and small Hsps with several proteins implicated in PPCM pathophysiology. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of select Hsps as novel candidate PPCM biomarkers and drug targets.

{"title": "Integration of Engineered \"Spark-Cell\" Spheroids for Optical Pacing of Cardiac Tissue.", "abstract": "Optogenetic methods for pacing of cardiac tissue can be realized by direct genetic modification of the cardiomyocytes to express light-sensitive actuators, such as channelrhodopsin-2, ChR2, or by introduction of light-sensitized non-myocytes that couple to the cardiac cells and yield responsiveness to optical pacing. In this study, we engineer three-dimensional \"spark cells\" spheroids, composed of ChR2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells (from 100 to 100,000 cells per spheroid), and characterize their morphology as function of cell density and time. These \"spark-cell\" spheroids are then deployed to demonstrate site-specific optical pacing of human stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in 96-well format using non-localized light application and all-optical electrophysiology with voltage and calcium small-molecule dyes or genetically encoded sensors. We show that the spheroids can be handled using liquid pipetting and can confer optical responsiveness of cardiac tissue earlier than direct viral or liposomal genetic modification of the cardiomyocytes, with 24% providing reliable stimulation of the iPSC-CMs within 6 h and >80% within 24 h. Moreover, our data show that the spheroids can be frozen in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage and transportation, after which they can be deployed as a reagent on site for optical cardiac pacing. In all cases, optical stimulation was achieved at relatively low light levels (<0.15 mW/mm", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2021-07-06", "authors": ["Christianne JChua", "Julie LHan", "WeizhenLi", "WeiLiu", "EmiliaEntcheva"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2021.658594\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1047-2_19\n10.1038/srep17350\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00168\n10.1126/science.1195929\n10.1016/j.mtbio.2019.100008\n10.1529/biophysj.105.063321\n10.1038/nn1525\n10.1038/s41598-021-88573-1\n10.1172/JCI88950\n10.1038/nmeth.1512\n10.1007/7651_2018_187\n10.1038/srep35628\n10.7554/eLife.12727.035\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3863-06.2006\n10.1113/JP271559\n10.1038/s41569-020-00478-0\n10.1002/advs.201901099\n10.1038/nmeth.3000\n10.1021/jacs.5b06644\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.964247\n10.1007/s11095-011-0647-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0196714\n10.1038/ncomms1302\n10.1093/europace/eus269\n10.1038/ncomms11542\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2019.02.004\n10.1038/s41598-021-83398-4\n10.1038/s41598-017-09760-7\n10.1152/ajpheart.00148.2020\n10.1088/1758-5090/aa53bd\n10.1016/j.cels.2018.08.013\n10.1088/1758-5082/3/2/025002\n10.1073/pnas.1936192100\n10.2144/000112591\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aau6447\n10.1371/journal.pone.0137999\n10.1371/journal.pone.0085221\n10.3390/ijms18122634\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.180505\n10.1016/j.bpj.2015.03.032\n10.1073/pnas.1509380112\n10.1038/nmeth936\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.04.002\n10.1002/cyto.a.20867"}
{"title": "3D Electrospun Nanofiber-Based Scaffolds: From Preparations and Properties to Tissue Regeneration Applications.", "abstract": "Electrospun nanofibers have been frequently used for tissue engineering due to their morphological similarities with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and tunable chemical and physical properties for regulating cell behaviors and functions.

{"title": "Suppression of Inflammatory Cardiac Cytokine Network in Rats with Untreated Obesity and Pre-Diabetes by AT2 Receptor Agonist NP-6A4.", "abstract": "Obesity affects over 42% of the United States population and exacerbates heart disease, the leading cause of death in men and women. Obesity also increases pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause chronic tissue damage to vital organs. The standard-of-care does not sufficiently attenuate these inflammatory sequelae. Angiotensin II receptor AT2R is an anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protective molecule; however, AT2R agonists are not used in the clinic to treat heart disease. NP-6A4 is a new AT2R peptide agonist with an FDA orphan drug designation for pediatric cardiomyopathy. NP-6A4 increases AT2R expression (mRNA and protein) and nitric oxide generation in human cardiovascular cells. AT2R-antagonist PD123319 and AT2RSiRNA suppress NP-6A4-effects indicating that NP-6A4 acts through AT2R. To determine whether NP-6A4 would mitigate cardiac damage from chronic inflammation induced by untreated obesity, we investigated the effects of 2-weeks NP-6A4 treatment (1.8\u00a0mg/kg delivered subcutaneously) on cardiac pathology of male Zucker obese (ZO) rats that display obesity, pre-diabetes and cardiac dysfunction. NP-6A4 attenuated cardiac diastolic and systolic dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but increased myocardial capillary density. NP-6A4 treatment suppressed tubulointerstitial injury marker urinary \u03b2-NAG, and liver injury marker alkaline phosphatase in serum. These protective effects of NP-6A4 occurred in the presence of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, and without modulating blood pressure. NP-6A4 increased expression of AT2R (consistent with human cells) and cardioprotective erythropoietin (EPO) and Notch1 in ZO rat heart, but suppressed nineteen inflammatory cytokines.

According to evidence, levosimendan can exert outstanding cardiac support and protection in different pathological conditions. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which levosimendan may alleviate cardiovascular toxicity due to AlP intoxication in the rat model. The groups included control group (normal saline only), sole levosimendan groups (12, 24, 48\u2009\u03bcg/kg), AlP group (10\u2009mg/kg), and AlP\u2009+\u2009levosimendan groups receiving 12, 24, 48\u2009\u03bcg/kg levosimendan intraperitoneally 30\u2009min after AlP administration. Electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters (QRS and PR duration and ST height), heart rate, and blood pressure were monitored for 180\u2009minutes. Also, after 24\u2009h of poisoning, echocardiography was applied to assess left ventricle function. Evaluation of the biochemical parameters in heart tissue, including mitochondrial complexes I, II, IV activity, ADP/ATP ratio, the rate of apoptosis, malondialdehyde (MDA), lactate, and troponin I levels, were done after 12 and 24\u2009h. AlP-induced ECG abnormalities (PR duration and ST height), reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, ejection fraction, and stroke volume were improved by levosimendan administration. Besides, levosimendan significantly improved complex IV activity, the ADP/ATP ratio, apoptosis, MDA, lactate, and troponin I level following AlP-poisoning. Our results suggest that levosimendan might alleviate AlP-induced cardiotoxicity by modulating mitochondrial activity and improving cardiac function.

{"title": "Active microrheology using pulsed optical tweezers to probe viscoelasticity of lamin A.", "abstract": "Lamins are nucleoskeletal proteins of mammalian cells that stabilize the structure and maintain the rigidity of the nucleus. These type V intermediate filament proteins which are predominantly of A and B types provide necessary tensile strength to the nucleus. Single amino acid missense mutations occurring all over the lamin A protein form a cluster of human diseases termed as laminopathies, most of which principally affect the muscle and cardiac tissues responsible for load bearing functionalities of the body. One such mutation is A350P which causes dilated cardiomyopathy in patients. It is postulated that a change from alanine to proline in the \u03b1-helical coiled-coil forming 2B rod domain of the protein might severely disrupt the propensity of the filaments to polymerise into functional higher order structures required to form a fully functional lamina with its characteristic elasticity. In this study, we have elucidated for the very first time, the application of active microrheology employing oscillating optical tweezers to investigate any alterations in the viscoelastic parameters of the mutant protein meshwork in vitro, which might translate into possible changes in nuclear plasticity. We confirmed our findings from this robust yet fast method by imaging both the wild type and mutant lamin A networks using a super resolution microscope, and observed changes in the mesh size which corroborate our measured changes in the viscoelastic parameters of the lamins. This method could thus be extended to conduct microrheological measurements on any intermediate filament protein thus bearing significant implications in laminopathies and other diseases associated with intermediate filaments.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2021-07-06", "authors": ["CMukherjee", "AKundu", "RDey", "ABanerjee", "KSengupta"], "doi": "10.1039/d1sm00293g"}
{"title": "Cardiac tissue conductivity estimation using confirmatory factor analysis.", "abstract": "Impaired electrical conduction has been shown to play an important role in the development of heart rhythm disorders. Being able to determine the conductivity is important to localize the arrhythmogenic substrate that causes abnormalities in atrial tissue. In this work, we present an algorithm to estimate the conductivity from epicardial electrograms (EGMs) using a high-resolution electrode array. With these arrays, it is possible to measure the propagation of the extracellular potential of the cardiac tissue at multiple positions simultaneously. Given this data, it is in principle possible to estimate the tissue conductivity. However, this is an ill-posed problem due to the large number of unknown parameters in the electrophysiological data model. In this paper, we make use of an effective method called confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which we apply to the cross correlation matrix of the data to estimate the tissue conductivity. CFA comes with identifiability conditions that need to be satisfied to solve the problem, which is, in this case, estimation of the tissue conductivity. These identifiability conditions can be used to find the relationship between the desired resolution and the required amount of data. Numerical experiments on the simulated data demonstrate that the proposed method can localize the conduction blocks in the tissue and can also estimate the smoother variation in the conductivities.

These complications can range from damaging cardiac tissues within the irradiation field to increasing the long-term risks of developing heart failure, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. We analyzed radiation-induced metabolites capable of mediating critical biological processes, such as inflammation, senescence, and apoptosis. Previously, by applying QTOF-MASS analysis to irradiated human fibroblasts, we identified that metabolite sets of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were increased in these cells. In this study, radiation-induced LPC accumulation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase staining, in addition to decreasing their tube-forming ability. Knockdown of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) with small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the increased LPC production induced by radiation, and reduced the radiation-induced cell damage produced by ROS and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Lp-PLA2 depletion abolished the induction of proinflammatory factors, such as interleukin 1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, as well as adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and E-selection. Likewise, we showed that Lp-PLA2 expression was upregulated in the vasculature of irradiated rat, resulting in increased LPC production and LDL oxidation. Our data demonstrate that radiation-induced LPC production is a potential risk factor for cardiotoxicity that is mediated by Lp-PLA2 activity, suggesting that LPC and Lp-PLA2 offer potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cardiovascular damage during radiotherapy.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2021-07-04", "authors": ["So-RaKim", "Jong-IkHeo", "Jeong-WooPark", "Chang-MoKang", "Kwang SeokKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2021.152841"}
{"title": "Possible protective effect of resolvin D1 on inflammation in atrial fibrillation: involvement of ER stress mediated the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac rhythm disturbance. At the cellular level, excessive ROS generation during AF is associated with ER stress, which induces an inflammatory response by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway. Activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been linked to the pathogenesis of AF through NF-kB activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. It has been shown that NLRP3 inflammasome activation by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is dependent on NF-kB activation. The anti-inflammatory role of resolvin D1 (RvD1), a pro-resolving mediator derived from omega-3 fatty acids, has demonstrated that the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in different tissues is attenuated after treatment with RvD1. However, the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of RvD1 in AF has not been clarified. This review suggests that RvD1 may inhibit ER stress-induced NLRP3 inflammasome through suppressing NF-\u03baB in cardiac tissue and, thus ameliorate AF.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2021-07-04", "authors": ["FatemehYarmohammadi", "A WallaceHayes", "GholamrezaKarimi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-021-02115-0\n10.1007/s12016-019-08754-9\n10.1111/febs.14608\n10.2337/db05-1635\n10.1080/10408398.2017.1379000\n10.1038/ni.3202\n10.3892/etm.2018.6721\n10.2337/db18-0469\n10.1007/978-3-030-21735-8_3\n10.1155/2018/3694362\n10.1038/s41580-020-0210-7\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000245\n10.1038/srep31042\n10.1253/circj.CJ-15-0138\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa186\n10.4049/jimmunol.1400313\n10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00769.x\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.04.060\n10.1016/j.phrs.2019.104295\n10.1186/s12933-017-0604-9\n10.3390/ijms20133328\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00612\n10.1194/jlr.M072587\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316364\n10.1007/s00253-020-10614-y\n10.1007/s10557-019-06884-y\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30668-7\n10.1007/s00395-020-00827-7\n10.1002/joa3.12473\n10.1093/cvr/cvab024\n10.1016/j.it.2019.01.007\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.01.031\n10.1074/jbc.M609212200\n10.1038/s41577-019-0165-0\n10.2174/1570159X17666191019170244\n10.3389/fphar.2020.610734\n10.1161/JAHA.117.006458\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035202\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105383\n10.1155/2020/6569728\n10.3892/mmr.2018.9124\n10.1111/jcmm.15816"}

Here, we present an in-depth, RNA-sequencing-based (RNA-Seq) bioinformatic with cluster analysis that details a distinct epigenome present in nCTSCs but not in aCTSCs. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment reveal biological processes, including metabolism, gene regulation enriched in nCTSCs, and STRING analysis that identifies a network of genes related to acetyl-CoA that can potentially influence chromatin remodeling. Additional validation by Western blot and qRT-PCR shows increased acetyl-CoA signaling and histone acetylation in nCTSCs compared to aCTSCs.

{"title": "Tunable Human Myocardium Derived Decellularized Extracellular Matrix for 3D Bioprinting and Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "The generation of 3D tissue constructs with multiple cell types and matching mechanical properties remains a challenge in cardiac tissue engineering. Recently, 3D bioprinting has become a powerful tool to achieve these goals. Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) is a common scaffold material due to providing a native biochemical environment. Unfortunately, dECM's low mechanical stability prevents usage for bioprinting applications alone. In this study, we developed bioinks composed of decellularized human heart ECM (dhECM) with either gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) or GelMA-methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA) hydrogels dual crosslinked with UV light and microbial transglutaminase (mTGase). We characterized the bioinks' mechanical, rheological, swelling, printability, and biocompatibility properties. Composite GelMA-MeHA-dhECM (GME) hydrogels demonstrated improved mechanical properties by an order of magnitude compared to the GelMA-dhECM (GE) hydrogels. All hydrogels were extrudable and compatible with human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) and human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs). Tissue-like beating of the printed constructs with striated sarcomeric alpha-actinin and connexin 43 expression was observed.

Tissue engineering is a solution to this crisis and in combination with the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which have drawn recent attention as a biomaterial, could facilitate the development of more dynamic and complex in vitro models. CNTs' electrical conductivity and dimensional similarity to cardiac extracellular proteins provide a unique opportunity to deliver scaffolds with stimuli that mimic the native cardiac microenvironment in vitro more effectively. This systematic review aims to evaluate the use and efficacy of CNTs for cardiac tissue scaffolds and was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Three databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers resulting from these searches were then subjected to analysis against pre-determined inclusion and quality appraisal criteria. From 249 results, 27 manuscripts met the criteria and were included in this review.

{"title": "iPSCs and Exosomes: Partners in Crime Fighting Cardiovascular Diseases.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Understanding the mechanisms at the basis of these diseases is necessary in order to generate therapeutic approaches. Recently, cardiac tissue engineering and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming has led to a skyrocketing number of publications describing cardiovascular regeneration as a promising option for cardiovascular disease treatment. Generation of artificial tissue and organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells is in the pipeline for regenerative medicine. The present review summarizes the multiple approaches of heart regeneration with a special focus on iPSC application. In particular, we describe the strength of iPSCs as a tool to study the molecular mechanisms driving cardiovascular pathologies, as well as their potential in drug discovery. Moreover, we will describe some insights into novel discoveries of how stem-cell-secreted biomolecules, such as exosomes, could affect cardiac regeneration, and how the fine tuning of the immune system could be a revolutionary tool in the modulation of heart regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of personalized medicine", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["GiuliaGermena", "RabeaHinkel"], "doi": "10.3390/jpm11060529\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306565\n10.3390/bioengineering6010018\n10.12659/MSMBR.894985\n10.1016/j.tcm.2003.12.006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0177242\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00117\n10.1126/science.282.5391.1145\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.778795\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311080\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.10.010\n10.1093/cvr/cvu205\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs226\n10.1038/ncb3411\n10.1038/nature11799\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.1038/nprot.2015.117\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy249\n10.1161/HCG.0000000000000043\n10.1056/NEJMoa0908679\n10.1002/stem.1331\n10.1002/biot.201800725\n10.1155/2019/8203950\n10.1089/ten.teb.2014.0383\n10.1089/ten.tea.2015.0482\n10.1038/srep29933\n10.1161/01.RES.63.3.577\n10.1016/j.trsl.2019.09.001\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1093/cvr/cvz245\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab6d36\n10.1002/stem.1560\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.005\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.05.009\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175505\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.04.005\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.5041/RMMJ.10401\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310803\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311578\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0659\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.022\n10.1161/hh0202.103644\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv189\n10.1038/s41598-017-14053-0\n10.1152/ajpheart.00688.2017\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00208\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.047\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1186/s13287-020-01847-9\n10.1161/JAHA.118.010239\n10.1038/s41587-019-0016-3\n10.1111/cpr.12946\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306985\n10.1096/fj.05-5211com\n10.1016/j.scr.2009.12.003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60195-0\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.04.006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311769\n10.1038/s41467-021-21682-7\n10.1002/stem.3261\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312420\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024590\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.05.020\n10.1093/cvr/cvu167\n10.1177/1074248414534916\n10.1111/bph.14155\n10.1093/cvr/cvu030\n10.1038/nrcardio.2011.38\n10.1172/JCI85782\n10.1016/j.cophys.2020.10.004\n10.1016/j.coi.2020.09.005\n10.1073/pnas.1406508111\n10.1007/s00395-011-0221-9\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.07.057\n10.3390/cells9081825\n10.1038/s41586-019-1802-2"}

{"title": "Contribution of K2P Potassium Channels to Cardiac Physiology and Pathophysiology.", "abstract": "Years before the first two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P) was cloned, certain ion channels had already been demonstrated to be present in the heart with characteristics and properties usually attributed to the TREK channels (a subfamily of K2P channels). K2P channels were later detected in cardiac tissue by RT-PCR, although the distribution of the different K2P subfamilies in the heart seems to depend on the species analyzed. In order to collect relevant information in this regard, we focus here on the TWIK, TASK and TREK cardiac channels, their putative roles in cardiac physiology and their implication in coronary pathologies. Most of the RNA expression data and electrophysiological recordings available to date support the presence of these different K2P subfamilies in distinct cardiac cells. Likewise, we show how these channels may be involved in certain pathologies, such as atrial fibrillation, long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["SalvadorHerrera-P\u00e9rez", "AnaCampos-R\u00edos", "LolaRueda-Ruzafa", "Jos\u00e9 AntonioLamas"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22126635\n10.1002/j.1460-2075.1996.tb00437.x\n10.1152/physrev.00029.2009\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.01.137\n10.1007/s00424-014-1634-8\n10.1038/emboj.2011.268\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.287268\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-19-07491.2001\n10.1177/1073858402239590\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-16-06460.2003\n10.1016/S0169-328X(01)00330-8\n10.1074/jbc.M008985200\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0704518\n10.1007/s00424-014-1632-x\n10.1007/s004240000496\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.032094\n10.1016/S0169-328X(00)00263-1\n10.1016/j.mcn.2012.01.002\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.01.008\n10.1152/ajpcell.00629.2005\n10.1074/jbc.M116.719039\n10.1007/s12031-012-9780-y\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2791-10.2011\n10.1111/ejn.12930\n10.1371/journal.pone.0199282\n10.1161/01.RES.72.4.890\n10.1085/jgp.100.6.1021\n10.1126/science.2727703\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.2004.03964.x\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.02.025\n10.1159/000331715\n10.1016/S0006-8993(00)03239-X\n10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013432\n10.1161/hh1601.094979\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.012657\n10.1074/jbc.274.12.7887\n10.1074/jbc.M003755200\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.22.2422\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.08.031\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.506857\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.04.006\n10.1113/jphysiol.2006.126714\n10.1161/01.RES.82.4.513\n10.1007/s00395-010-0128-x\n10.1002/cphy.c140069\n10.1056/NEJM199809033391003\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.18.1879\n10.1093/cvr/cvq332\n10.1007/s10741-012-9314-2\n10.1126/scisignal.2001726\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016217\n10.1007/s00210-012-0780-9\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn520\n10.1093/emboj/16.17.5464\n10.1006/bbrc.2001.5064\n10.1016/j.nbd.2008.09.006\n10.1074/jbc.M001948200\n10.1152/ajpheart.1999.277.5.H1669\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-03-00868.1998\n10.1161/CIRCEP.119.007465\n10.1161/01.RES.0000165480.82737.33\n10.1159/000335757\n10.1002/dvdy.20558\n10.15252/emmm.201303783\n10.1007/s00424-014-1637-5\n10.1016/j.lfs.2013.12.006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0074589\n10.1042/CS20150533\n10.1074/jbc.274.3.1381\n10.1074/jbc.M008192200\n10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01388-0\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600494\n10.1093/emboj/17.15.4283\n10.1007/s00424-014-1655-3\n10.1038/nature14013\n10.1038/emboj.2009.57\n10.3390/ijms20102371\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.08.018\n10.1002/j.1460-2075.1996.tb01077.x\n10.1113/expphysiol.2003.027052\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318280c5a9\n10.1172/JCI95945\n10.1161/JAHA.115.002865\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.05.005\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.05.007\n10.1093/emboj/17.12.3297\n10.1016/S0169-328X(02)00157-2\n10.1113/expphysiol.2005.031062\n10.1007/s00399-017-0541-z\n10.1007/s00424-019-02306-y\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.12.030\n10.1007/s00424-005-1492-5\n10.15252/emmm.201606690\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00227.x\n10.1007/s00424-014-1678-9\n10.1172/JCI59410\n10.1152/ajpheart.00956.2001\n10.1007/s00424-014-1665-1\n10.1113/JP272883\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.10.003\n10.1016/j.pcad.2008.05.002\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7362-0_11\n10.1074/jbc.M000445200\n10.1002/1097-0185(20000801)259:4<353::AID-AR10>3.0.CO;2-R\n10.1113/jphysiol.1995.sp020825\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00406.x\n10.5665/sleep.1616\n10.4330/wjc.v7.i4.204"}

{"title": "Exploration of Analgesia with Tramadol in the Coxsackievirus B3 Myocarditis Mouse Model.", "abstract": "Infection of mice with Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) triggers inflammation of the heart and this mouse model is commonly used to investigate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic aspects for viral myocarditis. Virus-triggered cytotoxicity and the activity of infiltrating immune cells contribute to cardiac tissue injury. In addition to cardiac manifestation, CVB3 causes cell death and inflammation in the pancreas. The resulting pancreatitis represents a severe burden and under such experimental conditions, analgesics may be supportive to improve the animals' well-being. Notably, several known mechanisms exist by which analgesics can interfere with the immune system and thereby compromise the feasibility of the model. We set up a study aiming to improve animal welfare while ensuring model integrity and investigated how tramadol, an opioid, affects virus-induced pathogenicity and immune response in the heart. Tramadol was administered seven days prior to a CVB3 infection in C57BL/6 mice and treatment was continued until the day of analysis. Tramadol had no effect on the virus titer or viral pathogenicity in the heart tissue and the inflammatory response, a hallmark of myocardial injury, was maintained. Our results show that tramadol exerts no disruptive effects on the CVB3 myocarditis mouse model and, therefore, the demonstrated protocol should be considered as a general analgesic strategy for CVB3 infection.", "journal": "Viruses", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["SandraPinkert", "MeikeKespohl", "NicolasKelm", "ZiyaKaya", "ArndHeuser", "KarinKlingel", "AntjeBeling"], "doi": "10.3390/v13071222\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.09.074\n10.1073/pnas.89.1.314\n10.1002/jmv.20933\n10.1097/BOR.0b013e328353372d\n10.1161/01.CIR.89.6.2582\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00648-X\n10.1016/j.tcm.2020.12.007\n10.1002/ejhf.1828\n10.1111/j.1651-2227.1989.tb10905.x\n10.1139/m59-074\n10.1016/j.molmed.2012.05.005\n10.1007/s00430-003-0199-5\n10.1093/cvr/cvz259\n10.1093/bja/aet153\n10.3390/biology9100335\n10.1016/0014-2999(92)94822-D\n10.2165/00003495-199400471-00003\n10.2165/00003495-200060010-00008\n10.1016/j.cvex.2010.09.005\n10.1016/S0304-3959(97)00055-9\n10.1038/s41598-019-47186-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.009847\n10.1128/jvi.70.12.8888-8895.1996\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00048\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.02914\n10.2165/00003088-200443130-00004\n10.1111/j.1472-8206.1999.tb00342.x\n10.1016/S0192-0561(99)00048-X\n10.1016/j.pain.2004.04.020"}

At the optimized electrospinning conditions, PHH, PDO and blend PHH/PDO in Hexafluroisopropanol (HFIP) solution yielded bead-free non-woven random nanofibers with high porosity and diameter in the range of hundreds of nanometers. The structural, morphological, and biomechanical properties were investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, and tensile tests. The blended scaffold showed an elastic modulus (~5 MPa) with a combination of the ultimate tensile strength (2 \u00b1 0.5 MPa), and maximum elongation (150% \u00b1 44%) in hydrated conditions, which are comparable to the materials currently being used for soft tissue applications such as skin, native arteries, and cardiac muscles applications.

{"title": "Characteristics of Ventricular Electrophysiological Substrates in Metabolic Mice Treated with Empagliflozin.", "abstract": "Empagliflozin (EMPA) is a sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that functions as a new-generation glucose-lowering agent and has been proven to be beneficial for patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, the possible benefits and mechanisms of its antiarrhythmic effects in cardiac tissue have not yet been reported. In this study, we elucidated the possible antiarrhythmic effects and mechanisms of EMPA treatment in cardiac tissues of metabolic syndrome (MS) mice. A total of 20 C57BL/6J mice (age: 8 weeks) were divided into four groups: (1) control group, mice fed a standard chow for 16 weeks; (2) MS group, mice fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks; (3) EMPA group, mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks and administered EMPA at 10 mg/kg daily for the following 4 weeks; and (4) glibenclamide (GLI) group, mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks and administered GLI at 0.6 mg/kg daily for the following 4 weeks.

However, most existing methods can only measure the in-plane component of twitch force of cardiomyocytes, such that mismatching the centripetal compressive stress of heart beating in physiology. Here, a non-destructive method is developed for quantifying the compressive stress and mapping the distribution of the local stress within the 3D cardiac tissues. In detail, elastic gelatin microspheres labeled with fluorescence beads are fabricated by microfluidic chips with high throughput, and they serve as built-in pressure sensors which are wrapped by cardiomyocytes in 3D tissues. The deformation of microspheres and the displacements of fluorescent beads induced by the contraction of cardiomyocytes are demonstrated to characterize the amount and distribution of the centripetal compressive stress. Further, the method shows a potent capability to locally quantify contractile force variation of 3D cardiac tissues, which is induced by agonist (norepinephrine) and inhibitor (blebbistatin). On the whole, the method significantly improves the 3D measurement of mechanical force in vitro and provides a solution for locally quantifying the compressive stress within engineered cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2021-07-02", "authors": ["ChuanjiangHe", "XinweiWei", "TaoLiang", "MengxueLiu", "DemingJiang", "LiujingZhuang", "PingWang"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202001716"}
{"title": "Difluoromethylornithine attenuates isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy by regulating apoptosis, autophagy and the mitochondria-associated membranes pathway.", "abstract": "Myocardial hypertrophy is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases and is closely associated with the incidence of heart failure. In the present study, we hypothesized that difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) could attenuate cardiac hypertrophy through mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) and autophagy. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in male rats by intravenous administration of isoproterenol (ISO; 5 mg/kg/day) for 1, 3,7 and 14 days. For DFMO treatment group, rats were given ISO (5 mg/kg/day) for 14 days and 2% DFMO in their water for 4 weeks. The expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA,heart parameters, apoptosis rate, fibrotic area and protein expressions of cleaved caspase3/9, GRP75, Mfn2, CypD and VDAC1 were measured to confirm the development of cardiac hypertrophy, apoptosis and autophagy induced by ISO. ANP mRNA and MAM protein expression levels were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting to evaluate hypertrophy and the effects of DFMO oral administration. The results demonstrated that heart parameters, ANP mRNA levels, fibrotic area and apoptosis rate were significantly increased in the heart tissue for ISO 7 and 14 day groups compared with the control group. Furthermore, treatment with DFMO significantly inhibited these indicators, and DFMO downregulated the MAM signaling pathway and upregulated the autophagy pathway in heart tissue compared with the ISO 14 day group. Overall, all ISO-induced changes analyzed in the present study were attenuated following treatment with DFMO.

{"title": "Role of Tunneling Nanotubes in Viral Infection, Neurodegenerative Disease, and Cancer.", "abstract": "The network of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) represents the filamentous (F)-actin rich tubular structure which is connected to the cytoplasm of the adjacent and or distant cells to mediate efficient cell-to-cell communication. They are long cytoplasmic bridges with an extraordinary ability to perform diverse array of function ranging from maintaining cellular physiology and cell survival to promoting immune surveillance. Ironically, TNTs are now widely documented to promote the spread of various pathogens including viruses either during early or late phase of their lifecycle. In addition, TNTs have also been associated with multiple pathologies in a complex multicellular environment. While the recent work from multiple laboratories has elucidated the role of TNTs in cellular communication and maintenance of homeostasis, this review focuses on their exploitation by the diverse group of viruses such as retroviruses, herpesviruses, influenza A, human metapneumovirus and SARS CoV-2 to promote viral entry, virus trafficking and cell-to-cell spread. The later process may aggravate disease severity and the associated complications due to widespread dissemination of the viruses to multiple organ system as observed in current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In addition, the TNT-mediated intracellular spread can be protective to the viruses from the circulating immune surveillance and possible neutralization activity present in the extracellular matrix. This review further highlights the relevance of TNTs in ocular and cardiac tissues including neurodegenerative diseases, chemotherapeutic resistance, and cancer pathogenesis.

Runx1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1) acts as an essential transcription factor that functions in a variety of cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, tissue growth and DNA damage response. However, relatively little is known about the role of Runx1 in heart, especially cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. In the present study, we investigated the role of Runx1 in experimentally pathological cardiac hypertrophy. The in vitro model was induced by Ang II exposure to cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and the in vivo pathological cardiac hypertrophy models were induced by chronic pressure overload in mice. Runx1 expression is increased in heart tissues from mice with pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in response to Ang II stimulation. Moreover, knockdown of cardiac Runx1 alleviates the pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanistically, Runx1 activates the p53 signalling by binding to the p53 gene and promotes its transcription. Rescue experiments indicate that Runx1 promotes cardiac hypertrophy in a p53-dependent manner. Remarkably, we demonstrated that Ro5-3335 (a Runx1 inhibitor) acts as a potential therapeutic drug for treating pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In summary, we conclude that Runx1 is a novel mediator and therapeutic target for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2021-07-01", "authors": ["DianhongZhang", "CuiLiang", "PengchengLi", "LuluYang", "ZhengyangHao", "LingyaoKong", "XiaoxuTian", "ChenranGuo", "JianzengDong", "YanzhouZhang", "BinbinDu"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.16704\n10.1242/dev.186569\n10.1172/jci.insight.86898\n10.1161/JAHA.115.001770"}

{"title": "Innate Mechanisms of Heart Regeneration.", "abstract": "Heart regeneration is a remarkable process whereby regrowth of damaged cardiac tissue rehabilitates organ anatomy and function. Unfortunately, the human heart is highly resistant to regeneration, which creates a shortage of cardiomyocytes in the wake of ischemic injury, and explains, in part, why coronary artery disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Luckily, a detailed blueprint for achieving therapeutic heart regeneration already exists in nature because several lower vertebrate species successfully regenerate amputated or damaged heart muscle through robust cardiomyocyte proliferation. A growing number of species are being interrogated for cardiac regenerative potential, and several commonalities have emerged between those animals showing high or low innate capabilities. In this review, we provide a historical perspective on the field, discuss how regenerative potential is influenced by cardiomyocyte properties, mitogenic signals, and chromatin accessibility, and highlight unanswered questions under active investigation. Ultimately, delineating why heart regeneration occurs preferentially in some organisms, but not in others, will uncover novel therapeutic inroads for achieving cardiac restoration in humans.", "journal": "Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology", "date": "2021-07-01", "authors": ["Hui-MinYin", "C GeoffreyBurns", "Caroline EBurns"], "doi": "10.1101/cshperspect.a040766\n10.1038/s41556-020-00588-4\n10.1016/j.diff.2018.01.003\n10.1073/pnas.1408233111\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.035\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045116\n10.1038/ncomms6863\n10.1038/nature22978\n10.1002/dvdy.21890\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.07.064\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316167\n10.1242/dev.178632\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1038/nm.3764\n10.1038/nature13309\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.060\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.12.004\n10.1242/jcs.00698\n10.1007/BF00232149\n10.1016/0045-6039(85)90485-3\n10.1038/s41569-018-0046-4\n10.1038/s42255-020-0169-x\n10.3390/ijms21030943\n10.1242/dev.088526\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.04.013\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038944\n10.1038/ncb3149\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.304517\n10.3390/jcdd5040056\n10.1007/s00429-002-0249-6\n10.3389/fcell.2020.570252\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1008354\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021119-034618\n10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2006.08.015\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307637\n10.7554/eLife.05871\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.01.013\n10.1016/j.devcel.2018.01.021\n10.1002/dvdy.24253\n10.1016/j.gde.2017.06.011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1038/nature11045\n10.1038/cr.2015.110\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.01.001\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.01.030\n10.1101/cshperspect.a019364\n10.7554/eLife.50163\n10.1242/dev.128892\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067266\n10.1371/journal.pone.0066613\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.11.010\n10.1002/dvdy.24154\n10.1101/gad.253443.114\n10.2174/157489012801227210\n10.1038/nature08899\n10.1073/pnas.1722594115\n10.1038/nature08804\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.01.010\n10.1038/nature14582\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00328.2017\n10.1038/nm1619\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.7554/eLife.25605\n10.1007/s00018-018-2995-5\n10.1038/nature24045\n10.1042/CS20180560\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.07.005\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.08.052\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0163\n10.1093/cvr/26.12.1172\n10.1038/s41569-018-0100-2\n10.1016/j.devcel.2015.06.017\n10.1073/pnas.1605431113\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa159\n10.1073/pnas.1803794116\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1073/pnas.1214608110\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.01.017\n10.1038/nature22979\n10.1242/dev.143362\n10.1038/nature20173\n10.1111/dgd.12281\n10.1083/jcb.49.2.560\n10.1002/jez.1401870208\n10.1007/BF00219752\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.04.018\n10.1016/j.tig.2015.03.011\n10.1038/ng.3929\n10.1089/scd.2012.0575\n10.1093/nar/gks301\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa5171\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1126/science.1077857\n10.3390/jcdd8010004\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.032\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.12.021\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028252\n10.1073/pnas.1834204100\n10.1371/journal.pone.0115871\n10.1007/BF00316744\n10.1007/BF00306596\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.12.002\n10.1038/s41467-017-02650-6\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.10.072\n10.1126/science.aam5894\n10.1038/npjregenmed.2016.12\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024307\n10.1038/s41569-018-0063-3\n10.1073/pnas.1905824116\n10.1126/science.aaz3090\n10.1242/dev.010363\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.02.034\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.021\n10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1996)18:2<173::AID-DVG10>3.0.CO;2-3\n10.1016/j.devcel.2015.12.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316303\n10.1038/ncomms13787\n10.1530/JOE-19-0413\n10.1007/s11886-017-0826-1\n10.1038/nbt.2682\n10.1074/jbc.273.17.10261\n10.1073/pnas.1311705111"}

Nicotinamide and streptozotocin injections were used to induce type 2 diabetes. After familiarization, the training group participated in an 8-week exercise protocol on a treadmill with an intensity of 25\u00a0m per minute, a slope of 5% and 30\u00a0min per session. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of mir-126 and PI3K genes. Expression of raf1, VEGF, blood glucose and insulin was determined by ELISA and insulin resistance was assessed by HOMA-IR homeostasis model. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the capillary density of the cardiac muscle. Data were analyzed by t-test for independent groups with a significance level of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.\nDiabetes reduces angiogenesis in cardiac tissue, which is associated with a significant reduction in the expression of mir-126, raf1, VEGF and PI3K; while aerobic exercise increased the expression of mir-126, raf1, PI3K, VEGF. Exercise also decreased blood glucose levels and insulin resistance.\nIt seems that aerobic exercise can prevent the destructive effects of diabetes by activating the angiogenic pathway of cardiac tissue. Therefore, regulatory processes through mir-126, which are influenced by aerobic exercise, can be a valuable strategy in developing new treatments for diabetes.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2021-06-28", "authors": ["SamanehDastah", "AsgharTofighi", "Solmaz BabaeiBonab"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2021.104212"}
{"title": "A modified approach to determine the six cardiac bidomain conductivities.", "abstract": "Accurate values for the six cardiac bidomain conductivities are crucial for meaningful computational studies of conduction in cardiac tissue, and are yet to be determined by experimental means. Although previous studies have proposed an approach using a multi-electrode array to measure potentials, from which the conductivities can be determined, it has been found that the conductivities cannot be retrieved consistently when the noise in the potentials varies. This paper presents a protocol, which not only has been shown to retrieve the conductivities to a reasonable accuracy, but does so under the presence of a more appropriate additive Gaussian noise model, while using fewer computational resources. Through repetitions of the protocol, a comparison of two pre-fabricated 128 electrode arrays, one array with a square arrangement of electrodes and the other with a rectangular arrangement, was made against a 75-electrode array proposed in previous studies. Results indicated that the two pre-fabricated arrays were generally more capable of obtaining the cardiac conductivities to a higher degree of accuracy than the 75-electrode array. The 128-electrode rectangular array was orientated such that the length of the array first ran along the direction of the fibres, then was reorientated such that the length of the array ran perpendicular to the direction of the fibres. The 128-electrode rectangular array, when orientated in this manner, was more capable of retrieving the conductivities than the remainder of the arrays tested, and thus we suggest this arrangement be used during experimental trials.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2021-06-26", "authors": ["AbbishKamalakkannan", "Peter RJohnston", "Barbara MJohnston"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104549\n10.1007/s10439-005-3236-2\n10.1016/S0022-0736(87)80019-5\n10.1113/jphysiol.1976.sp011283\n10.1161/01.res.44.5.701\n10.1161/01.res.50.3.342\n10.1109/NFSI.2011.5936816\n10.1161/01.res.0000031957.70034.89\n10.1016/j.mbs.2013.04.003\n10.21914/anziamj.v54i0.6278\n10.1016/jmbs.2006.04.004\n10.1152/ajpheart.1997.272.5.H2466\n10.1016/0025-5564(93)90001-Q\n10.1007/s10439-006-9098-4\n10.1007/s11517-013-1101-2\n10.1113/jphysiol.1970.sp009256\n10.1113/jphysiol.1970.sp009256\n10.1113/jphysiol.1970.sp009256\n10.1109/tbme.1982.324927\n10.1186/1475-925X-6-21\n10.1109/TBME.2005.844270\n10.1007/s11517-017-1714-y\n10.1109/10.563303\n10.1109/IEMBS.1994.415193\n10.1016/j.mbs.2015.05.008\n10.1088/0967-3334/28/7/s03\n10.13140/RG.2.2.10451.43044\n10.1093/biomet/52.3-4.591\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008"}

{"title": "The mineralocorticoid receptor leads to increased expression of EGFR and T-type calcium channels that support HL-1 cell hypertrophy.", "abstract": "The EGF receptor (EGFR) has been extensively studied in tumor biology and recently a role in cardiovascular pathophysiology was suggested. The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is an important effector of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and elicits pathophysiological effects in the cardiovascular system; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Our aim was to investigate the importance of EGFR for MR-mediated cardiovascular pathophysiology because MR is known to induce EGFR expression. We identified a SNP within the EGFR promoter that modulates MR-induced EGFR expression. In RNA-sequencing and qPCR experiments in heart tissue of EGFR KO and WT mice, changes in EGFR abundance led to differential expression of cardiac ion channels, especially of the T-type calcium channel CACNA1H. Accordingly, CACNA1H expression was increased in WT mice after in vivo MR activation by aldosterone but not in respective EGFR KO mice. Aldosterone- and EGF-responsiveness of CACNA1H expression was confirmed in HL-1 cells by Western blot and by measuring peak current density of T-type calcium channels. Aldosterone-induced CACNA1H protein expression could be abrogated by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478. Furthermore, inhibition of T-type calcium channels with mibefradil or ML218 reduced diameter, volume and BNP levels in HL-1 cells. In conclusion the MR regulates EGFR and CACNA1H expression, which has an effect on HL-1 cell diameter, and the extent of this regulation seems to depend on the SNP-216 (G/T) genotype. This suggests that the EGFR may be an intermediate for MR-mediated cardiovascular changes and that SNP analysis can help identify subgroups of patients that will benefit most from MR antagonists.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-06-26", "authors": ["KatharinaStroedecke", "SandraMeinel", "FritzMarkwardt", "UdoKloeckner", "NicoleStraetz", "KatjaQuarch", "BarbaraSchreier", "MichaelKopf", "MichaelGekle", "ClaudiaGrossmann"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-92284-y\n10.1056/NEJM199909023411001\n10.1056/NEJMoa030207\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64454-9\n10.1291/hypres.28.925\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.07.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.01096.2001\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000176236.55322.18\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.09070\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02883\n10.1161/01.HYP.24.1.30\n10.1038/hr.2010.277\n10.1016/S0014-4827(02)00104-0\n10.1152/ajpheart.00639.2010\n10.1073/pnas.0537588100\n10.1083/jcb.151.2.209\n10.1083/jcb.200307035\n10.1242/jcs.02346\n10.1007/s00395-018-0669-y\n10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00093-7\n10.1161/01.RES.0000086803.64109.9E\n10.1096/fj.02-0570fje\n10.1016/S0021-9150(00)00576-1\n10.1073/pnas.96.4.1633\n10.1161/01.RES.0000237388.89261.47\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-070115-095427\n10.1074/jbc.M308134200\n10.1093/nar/gkt581\n10.1056/NEJMoa1009492\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.013255\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.0850\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01663-1\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000091405.00772.6E\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.05.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.983023\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.163287\n10.1152/ajpendo.00708.2006\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.168021\n10.1210/me.2004-0469\n10.3892/ol.2013.1442\n10.1371/journal.pmed.0040125\n10.1124/jpet.113.203497\n10.1093/cvr/cvq030\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000047104.42047.9B\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000030181.63741.56\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05344\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04794\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030156\n10.1152/ajprenal.00121.2018\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.176024\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.12.004\n10.1016/S0165-6147(03)00079-8\n10.1172/JCI31901\n10.1016/S0005-2736(99)00233-3\n10.1007/s00424-003-1204-y\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.01.010\n10.1042/BJ20121324\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.06.006\n10.1093/cvr/cvr281\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.10.013\n10.1126/science.7618084\n10.1152/ajpheart.00866.2008\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.196543\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045401\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1073/pnas.95.6.2979\n10.1210/endo.142.10.8435\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.09.045\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.05.009\n10.1161/01.RES.83.1.103\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00017-1\n10.1006/jmcc.1999.0998\n10.1161/01.RES.73.4.777\n10.1073/pnas.87.12.4655\n10.1126/science.1089268\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.11.010\n10.1016/j.febslet.2013.04.040\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.184051\n10.1161/hc3901.095766\n10.1093/cvr/cvt190\n10.1111/paa.1999.111.5.429\n10.1177/153537020222700506\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.21.2191\n10.1097/01.fjc.0000138163.11612.7b\n10.1172/JCI39724\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.184051\n10.1023/B:JOBB.0000008025.65675.37\n10.1023/B:JOBB.0000008024.77488.48\n10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00849.x\n10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012839\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2012.08.032\n10.1038/srep07430"}

Diabetes is highly prevalent in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is on the rise worldwide.

We found significant upregulation of cardiac TF mRNA and protein levels in diabetic WT hearts compared with nondiabetic controls. WT diabetic hearts also exhibited increased inflammation and cardiac hypertrophy versus controls. However, these changes in cardiac inflammation and hypertrophy were not found in low-TF mice with diabetes compared with their nondiabetic controls.

Polysaccharides are known to exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential and are suggested to possess immunomodulatory potential.\nHerein, the immunomodulatory activity of a sulfated polysaccharide (PS) separated from a brown marine algae Turbinaria ornata is studied in LPS instigated systemic inflammation in experimental rats.\nMale SD rats are pretreated with different doses of PS (2.5, 5, 10\u00a0mg/kg bw) for a week followed by inducing systemic inflammation using LPS (10\u00a0mg/kg i.p.). Blood withdrawn after 8\u00a0h of LPS injection is subjected to hematological analysis (WBC, HCT, and PLT). After 24\u00a0h of LPS induction, cardiac tissue was isolated and subjected to biochemical, molecular, and histopathological analysis. Effect of PS pre-treatment (2.5, 5, 10\u00a0mg/kg bw) was checked by assessing serum parameters (AST, CK-MB, and \u03b3GT), antioxidant markers (LPO, GSH, SOD, Grx) and inflammatory markers (IL1\u03b2, IL6, IL10, NF\u03baB), followed by analyzing the iNOS, PI3k and Akt to identify the probable mode of action.\nElevated levels of AST, CK-MB, and \u03b3GT in serum were significantly reduced on PS pretreatment. LPS significantly raised the LPO and Grx levels in heart tissue whereas, PS pre-treatment significantly reduced LPO and Grx levels. GSH and SOD levels were reduced upon LPS induction and were brought to near normal by HD of PS.

A partial least squares discriminant analysis showed separation between the CCHD and ACHD groups. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the most enriched metabolic pathways were amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism. Eleven amino acids were increased in CCHD patients, indicating that protein synthesis was down-regulated. Most of the metabolites in Krebs circle were increased in CCHD patients, suggesting down regulation of aerobic energy metabolism. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was clustered with Krebs cycle related substrates and its level was significantly higher in CCHD than that in ACHD patients. These analyses suggest that NAD might play an important role in response to hypoxia in CCHD patients.\nOur data showed a significantly different metabolic profile in CCHD patients compared to ACHD patients, including reduced protein synthesis and aerobic energy production, and the increased level of NAD in the myocardium may be a response mechanism to hypoxia.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2021-06-22", "authors": ["ShuoDong", "LiyingWu", "YabingDuan", "HaoCui", "KaiChen", "XiaoChen", "YangxueSun", "ChuhaoDu", "JieRen", "SongrenShu", "XinYan", "XinhongWan", "JiangpingSong", "JunYan"], "doi": null}

The present study aimed to investigate whether ginsenoside Rc exerted protective effects against acute cold exposure-induced myocardial injury in rats. Forty rats were randomly assigned into four groups: Control, model, ginsenoside Rc 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg groups. Rats were intragastrically administrated with ginsenoside Rc (10, 20 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 7 days. On the seventh day, all rats except the control group were exposed to low temperature. Cardiac function, myocardial enzyme activities, hemorheology, and inflammatory response were detected. Histopathological examination and apoptosis of cardiac tissues were performed. The expressions of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), procaspase-3, and the mRNA (messenger RNA) level of SIRT1 were measured by western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Ginsenoside Rc significantly improved cardiac function, diminished the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), and regulated abnormal hemorheology in acute cold-exposed rats (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Furthermore, ginsenoside Rc could attenuate myocardial histological changes and structural abnormalities, decrease apoptotic cells and reduce the mRNA levels and activity of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-6 (p < 0.01). In addition, ginsenoside Rc upregulated the expressions of SIRT1, Bcl-2, and procaspase-3 and downregulated that of Bax (p < 0.01). The changes in both the mRNA and protein expression levels of SIRT1 were similar. The results of the current study suggested that ginsenoside Rc could alleviate acute cold exposure-induced myocardial injury in rats by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis via regulating SIRT1 expression and attenuating the inflammatory responses.

Patient-specific hiPSCs can now be generated, genome-edited, and subsequently differentiated into various cell types and used for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, drug testing, toxicity screening, and 3D tissue generation. Modulation of the retinoic acid signaling pathway has been shown to direct cardiomyocyte differentiation towards an atrial lineage. A variety of studies have successfully differentiated patient-specific atrial cardiac myocytes (hiPSC-aCM) and atrial engineered heart tissue (aEHT) that express atrial specific genes (e.g., sarcolipin and ANP) and exhibit atrial electrophysiological and contractility profiles. Identification of protocols to differentiate atrial cells from patients with atrial fibrillation and other inherited diseases or creating disease models using genetic mutation studies has shed light on the mechanisms of atrial-specific diseases and identified the efficacy of atrial-selective pharmacological compounds. hiPSC-aCMs and aEHTs can be used in drug discovery and drug screening studies to investigate the efficacy of atrial selective drugs on atrial fibrillation models. Furthermore, hiPSC-aCMs can be effective tools in studying the mechanism, pathophysiology and treatment options of atrial fibrillation and its genetic underpinnings. The main limitation of using hiPSC-CMs is their immature phenotype compared to adult CMs. A wide range of approaches and protocols are used by various laboratories to optimize and enhance CM maturation, including electrical stimulation, culture time, biophysical cues and changes in metabolic factors.", "journal": "Methods (San Diego, Calif.)", "date": "2021-06-19", "authors": ["MayelGharanei", "SanamShafaattalab", "SarabjitSangha", "MarvinGunawan", "ZacharyLaksman", "LeifHove-Madsen", "Glen FTibbits"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymeth.2021.06.009"}

Using bioinformatics tools and a wide range of function and mechanism assays, we attempted to understand the specific function and potential mechanism of miR-145-5p in hyperlipidemia. A cholesterol-enriched diet induced an increase of serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol but a decrease of serum high-density lipoprotein. MiR-145-5p level was decreased in hyperlipidemia rat models. MiR-145-5p regulated lipid metabolism by antagonizing the alteration of high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, and triacylglycerol in serum mediated by a cholesterol-enriched diet. In mechanism, miR-145-5p directly bound with p21 protein (RAC1)-activated kinase 7 (PAK7) and negatively regulated mRNA and protein levels of PAK7 in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, miR-145-5p level was negatively associated with PAK7 level in rat cardiac tissues. Finally, overexpression of PAK7 reversed the effects of miR-145-5p on \u03b2-catenin activation and M2 macrophages polarization in THP-1 cells.

{"title": "Expanding current applications and permitting the analysis of larger intact samples by means of a 7 mm CMP-NMR probe.", "abstract": "Comprehensive multiphase NMR combines the ability to study and differentiate all phases (solids, gels, and liquids) using a single NMR probe. The general goal of CMP-NMR is to study intact environmental and biological samples to better understand conformation, organization, association, and transfer between and across phases/interfaces that may be lost with conventional sample preparation such as drying or solubilization. To date, all CMP-NMR studies have used 4 mm probes and rotors. Here, a larger 7 mm probehead is introduced which provides \u223c3 times the volume and \u223c2.4 times the signal over a 4 mm version. This offers two main advantages: (1) the additional biomass reduces experiment time, making 13C detection at natural abundance more feasible; (2) it allows the analysis of larger samples that cannot fit within a 4 mm rotor. Chicken heart tissue and Hyalella azteca (freshwater shrimp) are used to demonstrate that phase-based spectral editing works with 7 mm rotors and that the additional biomass from the larger volumes allows detection with 13C at natural abundance. Additionally, a whole pomegranate seed berry (aril) and an intact softgel capsule of hydroxyzine hydrochloride are used to demonstrate the analysis of samples too large to fit inside a conventional 4 mm CMP probe. The 7 mm version introduced here extends the range of applications and sample types that can be studied and is recommended when 4 mm CMP probes cannot provide adequate signal-to-noise (S/N), or intact samples are simply too big for 4 mm rotors.", "journal": "The Analyst", "date": "2021-06-18", "authors": ["ParisNing", "DanielLane", "RajshreeGhosh Biswas", "AmyJenne", "MonicaBastawrous", "RonaldSoong", "DanielSchmidig", "ThomasFrei", "PeterDe Castro", "IvanKovacevic", "StephanGraf", "SebastianWegner", "WolfgangBermel", "FalkoBusse", "TillKuehn", "RainerKuemmerle", "JochemStruppe", "MichaelFey", "Henry JStronks", "MartineMonette", "Myrna JSimpson", "Andr\u00e9 JSimpson"], "doi": "10.1039/d1an00809a"}

{"title": "Deficiency of myostatin protects skeletal muscle cells from ischemia reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury plays a pivotal role in many diseases and leads to collateral damage during surgical interventions. While most studies focus on alleviating its severity in the context of brain, liver, kidney, and cardiac tissue, research as regards to skeletal muscle has not been conducted to the same extent. In the past, myostatin (MSTN), primarily known for supressing muscle growth, has been implicated in inflammatory circuits, and research provided promising results for cardiac IR injury mitigation by inhibiting MSTN cell surface receptor ACVR2B.

Studies published to date have used varying methods to preserve and process human heart tissue, and have generated interesting datasets, but development of a biobanking standard has not yet been achieved. Heart transcription patterns are known to be regionally diverse, and there are few single cell datasets for normal human heart tissue.\nUsing pig tissue, we developed a rigorous and reproducible method for tissue mincing and cryopreservation that allowed recovery of high quality single nuclei RNA. We subsequently tested this protocol on normal human heart tissue obtained from organ donors and were able to recover high quality nuclei for generation of single nuclei RNA-seq datasets, using a commercially available platform from 10\u00d7\u2009Genomics. We analyzed these datasets using standard software packages such as CellRanger and Seurat.\nHuman heart tissue preserved with our method consistently yielded nuclear RNA with RNA Integrity Numbers of greater than 8.5. We demonstrate the utility of this method for single nuclei RNA-sequencing of the normal human interventricular septum and delineating its cellular diversity. The human IVS showed unexpected diversity with detection of 23 distinct cell clusters that were subsequently categorized into different cell types. Cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were the most commonly identified cell types and could be further subdivided into 5 different cardiomyocyte subtypes and 6 different fibroblast subtypes that differed by gene expression patterns. Ingenuity Pathway analysis of these gene expression patterns suggested functional diversity in these cell subtypes.\nHere we report a simple technical method for cryopreservation and subsequent nuclear isolation of human interventricular septum tissue that can be done with common laboratory equipment. We show how this method can be used to generate single nuclei transcriptomic datasets that rival those already published by larger groups in terms of cell diversity and complexity and suggest that this simple method can provide guidance for biobanking of human myocardial tissue for complex genomic analysis.", "journal": "BMC medical genomics", "date": "2021-06-17", "authors": ["AmyLarson", "Michael TChin"], "doi": "10.1186/s12920-021-01011-z\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.04.052\n10.3390/cells9020318\n10.3390/ijms21218345\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.12.072\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030742\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.06.031\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045401\n10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4\n10.1038/nprot.2016.015\n10.1038/ncomms14049\n10.1038/nbt.4096\n10.1093/gigascience/giy083\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btl567\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt703\n10.1056/NEJMra1710575"}

Baseline and day 10 echocardiograms were obtained to assess cardiac function. At 10\u00a0days, cardiac tissue was harvested for further analysis, which included histologic analysis and assessment of oxidative stress. Paired student's t test was used for in group comparison, and ANOVA was used for multiple group comparisons.\nCompared to vehicle treated mice, isoproterenol decreased ejection fraction and fractional shortening on echocardiogram. Nicorandil prevented isoproterenol induced cardiac dysfunction. Isoproterenol increased cardiac fibrosis, which nicorandil prevented. Isoproterenol increased gene expression of NADPH oxidase, which decreased to baseline with nicorandil treatment. Superoxide dismutase 2 protein expression increased in those treated with nicorandil, and xanthine oxidase activity decreased in mice treated with nicorandil during isoproterenol stress compared to all other groups.\nIn conclusion, nicorandil is cardioprotective in mdx mice and warrants continued investigation as a therapy for DMD associated cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "date": "2021-06-17", "authors": ["Rachel TSullivan", "Ngoc TLam", "MargaretHaberman", "Margaret JBeatka", "Muhammad ZAfzal", "Michael WLawlor", "Jennifer LStrande"], "doi": "10.1186/s12872-021-02112-4\n10.1016/0960-8966(91)90039-U\n10.1177/0009922809347777\n10.1161/01.RES.0000126574.61061.25\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2013.08.023\n10.3233/JND-170280\n10.1016/j.rehab.2013.06.002\n10.3390/jcm7090291\n10.1016/0022-510X(96)00167-0\n10.1016/j.ceca.2009.06.002\n10.1093/cvr/cvm089\n10.1152/ajpheart.00890.2013\n10.1073/pnas.0710595105\n10.1186/1471-2261-11-20\n10.1111/bph.12407\n10.1371/journal.pone.0027034\n10.1136/heartjnl-2011-300254\n10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311269\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2003.09.018\n10.1186/1475-2840-10-105\n10.1016/S0026-0495(00)80003-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0172803\n10.1016/j.bcp.2013.07.005\n10.1016/S0167-5273(97)00270-2\n10.1159/000374035\n10.1186/s12872-019-1071-x\n10.2147/DDDT.S195918\n10.1177/1074248416636477\n10.1002/mus.21763\n10.3390/jcm9020520\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.01.013\n10.1093/hmg/ddh174\n10.1177/0267659108100708\n10.1016/j.ahj.2008.01.018\n10.1016/j.nmd.2004.04.007\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.041\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052667\n10.1177/1074248413485434\n10.1089/ars.2006.8.691\n10.1093/cvr/cvq250\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv290\n10.1128/MCB.00426-08\n10.1152/ajprenal.00158.2012\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.09.078\n10.1016/j.ahj.2007.05.014\n10.1186/s13023-019-1066-9\n10.3390/ijms20174098\n10.1006/jmcc.1999.1018\n10.1002/ana.24216\n10.1002/ana.24214\n10.1124/jpet.111.183210\n10.1074/jbc.M112.392050\n10.1038/s41598-018-33930-w\n10.1002/mus.20590\n10.1016/j.nmd.2014.04.006\n10.1016/j.phrs.2013.04.009\n10.1093/hmg/ddu033\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.10.078"}
{"title": "A continuum model and simulations for large deformation of anisotropic fiber-matrix composites for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac patch therapies promise to restore heart function and lower the risk of heart failure after heart attack. Fiber-matrix engineered tissue scaffolds have gained significant attention due to their tunable micro-structures, providing nonlinear mechanical properties similar to native anisotropic heart tissues. Mechanical properties of engineered scaffolds directly affect the stress fields generated inside and around the tissue scaffolds and have significant impact on the tissue functionality. Currently, biomedical cardiac patches are designed through experimentation and there exists a need for an accurate model that will allow micro-structural design optimization and analysis of effectiveness of the implanted patches. We have developed a three-dimensional large strain continuum model that can predict nonlinear, anisotropic mechanical response of engineered tissue scaffolds that have two orientation families of fibers inside a bulk hydrogel matrix. We have validated the predictive capability of our continuum model for the fiber-matrix composite using selected experiments and a suite of detailed finite element analysis that incorporated the micro-structural details of the composites. Comparing the continuum model predictions (1 element) against the representative volume micro-structural geometry finite element simulations (with greater than 4,00,000 elements), we show that the proposed model can accurately predict nonlinear mechanical behavior of highly anisotropic tissue scaffolds in both the longitudinal and transverse directions, as a function of the critical design parameters inter-fiber angle and fiber spacing. We show that the model can also capture native heart tissue's anisotropic large strain mechanical response. We implemented our model in the finite element software Abaqus by writing a user material subroutine UANISOHYPER and demonstrated its predictive abilities by conducting a full three-dimensional analysis of engineered tissue patch application on an infarcted heart.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2021-06-16", "authors": ["YifeiBai", "Nicholas JKaiser", "Kareen L KCoulombe", "VikasSrivastava"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104627"}

In this study, potential anti-fibrotic drugs were screened in a model of diseased myocardium using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and non-CM in in vitro and in vivo heart failure models. Cardiomyogenic differentiation was induced in hiPSC to generate cardiac tissue, including both iPSC-CM and non-CM expressing fibroblast markers. Stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 significantly increased cardiac fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression, and decreased cardiac contractile/relaxation velocity. Anti-fibrotic HGF significantly decreased fibrotic changes induced by TGF-\u03b2. A prostacyclin agonist, ONO-1301 (ONO), camostat mesilate (Cs), and pirfenidone (Pf) significantly decreased fibrotic ECM expression, and improved contraction/relaxation in the model stimulated with TGF-\u03b2. Consistent with the in vitro assay, the administration of ONO, Cs, or Pf for 8\u00a0weeks in J2N-k hamsters preserved the left ventricular ejection fraction and decreased cardiac fibrosis compared with the controls.

In this study, we investigated the role of sympathetic overactivity in mediating cardiac dysfunction post ICH in mice. Collagenase-injection ICH model was established in adult male C57BL/6J mice. Neurological function was subsequently evaluated at multiple time points after ICH and cardiac function was measured by echocardiography on 3 and 14\u00a0days after ICH.

Macrophages and neutrophils were assessed to evaluate inflammatory cell infiltration in heart after ICH. ICH induced sympathetic excitability, as identified by increased circulating adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol levels and \u03b21-AR expression in heart tissue. Metoprolol-treated ICH mice had improved cardiac and neurological function.

Blood glucose, cortisol and lipid, body and liver mass, fork length, hematocrit and, blood cell counts and global heart methylation were measured. Red blood cell counts were significantly lower, while hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume were significantly higher in the hypoxic treatment.

Pilose Antler, as a traditional Chinese medicine, first appeared in the Han Dynasty and has been used to treat heart disease for nearly a thousand years. Previous data revealed pilose antler polypeptide (PAP, 3.2KD) was one of its main active components with multiple biological activities for cardiomyopathy. PAP-3.2KD exerts protective effects againt myocardial fibrosis. The present study demonstrated the protective mechanism of PAP-3.2KD against Adriamycin (ADR)-induced myocardial injury through using animal model with ADR-induced myocardial injury. PAP-3.2KD markedly improved the weight increase and decreased the HW/BW index, heart rate, and ST height in ADR-induced groups. Additionally, PAP-3.2KD reversed histopathological changes (such as disordered muscle bundles, myocardial fibrosis and diffuse myocardial cellular edema) and scores of the heart tissue, ameliorated the myocardial fibrosis and collagen volume fraction through pathological examination, significantly increased the protein level of Bcl-2, and decreased the expression levels of Bax and caspase-3 in myocardial tissue by ELISA, compared to those in ADR-induced group. Furthermore, ADR stimulation induced the increased protein levels of TGF-\u03b21 and SMAD2/3/4, the increased phosphorylation levels of SMAD2/3 and the reduced protein levels of SMAD7.

Previously, we reported that the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) reduces the cardiomyocyte apoptosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy; however, the precise mechanisms associated with this process are not yet fully understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether the mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effect of G-CSF was associated with ER stress in a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy was induced in rats using a high-fat diet combined with the administration of a low-dose of streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were treated with G-CSF or saline for 5 days. Cardiac function was evaluated using serial echocardiography before and 4 weeks after treatment. The rate of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the expression levels of proteins related to ER stress, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), caspase-9, and caspase-12 were analyzed in the cardiac tissue. G-CSF treatment significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the diabetic myocardium and downregulated the expression levels of these proteins in diabetic rats treated with low-dose streptozotocin when compared to that in rats treated with saline. In addition, G-CSF treatment significantly downregulated the expression levels of proteins related to ER stress, such as GRP78, inositol-requiring enzyme-1\u03b1 (IRE-1\u03b1), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in H9c2 cells under high glucose (HG) conditions. Moreover, G-CSF treatment significantly improved the diastolic dysfunction in serial echocardiography assessments. In conclusion, the anti-apoptotic effect of G-CSF may be associated with the downregulation of ER stress.", "journal": "Endocrine journal", "date": "2021-06-15", "authors": ["In-HwaPark", "Guang-YinShen", "Yi-SunSong", "YoungJong Cho", "Byung SikKim", "YongguLee", "Young-HyoLim", "Jeong-HunShin", "Kyung-SooKim"], "doi": "10.1507/endocrj.EJ21-0016"}
{"title": "Superiority of focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope tomography of cardiomyocytes over standard 2D analyses highlighted by unmasking mitochondrial heterogeneity.", "abstract": "Cardioprotection by preventing or repairing mitochondrial damage is an unmet therapeutic need. To understand the role of cardiomyocyte mitochondria in physiopathology, the reliable characterization of the mitochondrial morphology and compartment is pivotal. Previous studies mostly relied on two-dimensional (2D) routine transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thereby neglecting the real three-dimensional (3D) mitochondrial organization. This study aimed to determine whether classical 2D TEM analysis of the cardiomyocyte ultrastructure is sufficient to comprehensively describe the mitochondrial compartment and to reflect mitochondrial number, size, dispersion, distribution, and morphology.\nSpatial distribution of the complex mitochondrial network and morphology, number, and size heterogeneity of cardiac mitochondria in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes and adult wild-type left ventricular tissues (C57BL/6) were assessed using a comparative 3D imaging system based on focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) nanotomography. For comparison of 2D vs. 3D data sets, analytical strategies and mathematical comparative approaches were performed. To confirm the value of 3D data for mitochondrial changes, we compared the obtained values for number, coverage area, size heterogeneity, and complexity of wild-type cardiomyocyte mitochondria with data sets from mice lacking the cytosolic and mitochondrial protein BNIP3 (BCL-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3; Bnip3\nThe FIB-SEM nanotomographic analysis revealed that no linear relationship exists for mitochondrial number (r\u00a0=\u00a00.02; P\u00a0=\u00a00.9511), dispersion (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.03; P\u00a0=\u00a00.9188), and shape (roundness: r\u00a0=\u00a00.15, P\u00a0=\u00a00.6397; elongation: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, P\u00a0=\u00a00.7804) between 3D and 2D results. Cumulative frequency distribution analysis showed a diverse abundance of mitochondria with different sizes in 3D and 2D. Qualitatively, 2D data could not reflect mitochondrial distribution and dynamics existing in 3D tissue. 3D analyses enabled the discovery that BNIP3 deletion resulted in more smaller, less complex cardiomyocyte mitochondria (number: P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; heterogeneity: C.V. wild-type 89% vs. Bnip3\nHere, we demonstrate the need of 3D analyses for the characterization of mitochondrial features in cardiac tissue samples. Hence, we observed that BNIP3 deletion physiologically acts as a molecular brake on mitochondrial number, suggesting a role in mitochondrial fusion/fission processes and thereby regulating the homeostasis of cardiac bioenergetics.", "journal": "Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle", "date": "2021-06-14", "authors": ["JacquelineHeinen-Weiler", "MikeHasenberg", "MartinHeisler", "StephanSettelmeier", "Anna-LenaBeerlage", "HannahDoepper", "BerndWalkenfort", "AndreaOdersky", "PeterLuedike", "ElkeWinterhager", "TienushRassaf", "Ulrike BHendgen-Cotta"], "doi": "10.1002/jcsm.12742"}

Furthermore, feeding with supplemented diet with pulp and captopril administration reduced AChE, BChE, ACE, and arginase activities of hypertensive-treated groups. The fruit pulp supplemented diet also increased antioxidant status of hypertensive-treated groups. This was supported by the histopathological examination of the kidney and heart tissues.

Design of functional biomaterials to mimic the tissue/cell microenvironment have great potentials for tissue regeneration applications. Recently, electroactive biomaterials have drawn increasing attentions not only as scaffolds for cell adhesion and structural support, but also as modulators to regulate cell/tissue behaviors and function, especially for electrically excitable cells and tissues. More importantly, electrostimulation can further modulate a myriad of biological processes, from cell cycle, migration, proliferation and differentiation to neural conduction, muscle contraction, embryogenesis, and tissue regeneration. In this review, endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity are introduced. Then, design rationale of electroactive biomaterials is discussed for imitating dynamic cell microenvironment, as well as their mediated electrostimulation and the applying pathways. Recent advances in electroactive biomaterials are systematically overviewed for modulation of stem cell fate and tissue regeneration, mainly including nerve regeneration, bone tissue engineering, and cardiac tissue engineering.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of the first hospitalization for heart failure, possibly through glucose-independent mechanisms in part, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aimed to shed light on the efficacy of dapagliflozin in reducing cardiac remodeling and potential mechanisms.\nSprague-Dawley (SD) rats, induced by chronic infusion of Angiotensin II (Ang II) at a dose of 520\u00a0ng/kg per minute for 4\u00a0weeks with ALZET\u00ae mini-osmotic pumps, were treated with either SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (DAPA) or vehicle alone.

Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were treated with Ang II (1\u00a0\u03bcM) with or without the indicated concentration (0.5, 1, 10\u00a0\u03bcM) of DAPA. The protein levels of collagen and TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling were measured along with body weight, and blood biochemical indexes.\nDAPA pretreatment resulted in the amelioration of left ventricular dysfunction in Ang II-infused SD rats without affecting blood glucose and blood pressure.

Characterizing the complex relationship between genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic variation will enhance our understanding of pathogenesis in this important type of congenital disorder. We investigated cis-acting effects of genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on local DNA methylation patterns within 83 cardiac tissue samples and prioritized their contributions to CHD risk by leveraging results of CHD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and their effects on cardiac gene expression.\nWe identified 13,901 potential methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) with a false discovery threshold of 5%. Further co-localization analyses and Mendelian randomization indicated that genetic variants near the HLA-DRB6 gene on chromosome 6 may contribute to CHD risk by regulating the methylation status of nearby CpG sites. Additional SNPs in genomic regions on chromosome 10 (TNKS2-AS1 gene) and chromosome 14 (LINC01629 gene) may simultaneously influence epigenetic and transcriptomic variations within cardiac tissues.\nOur results support the hypothesis that genetic variants may influence the risk of CHDs through regulating the changes of DNA methylation and gene expression.

The strain sensor is integrated on the polyimide (PI) cantilever. To improve the strain sensor reliability and construct the engineered cardiac tissue, the nanogroove-patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) encapsulation layer is bonded on the PI cantilever. The preliminary sensing characteristics demonstrate the superior structural integrity, robustness, enhanced sensitivity, and repeatability of the proposed devices. The long-term durability and biocompatibility of the PI/PDMS hybrid cantilever is verified by evaluating the cell viability and contractility. We also validate the proposed biosensing platform for cardiotoxicity measurement by applying it to two specific cardiovascular drugs: quinidine and verapamil. In response to quinidine and verapamil, the engineered CMs exhibited negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. The fabricated cantilever device successfully detected the quinidine-induced adverse effects in CMs such as early after depolarization (EADs) and Torsade de points (TdP) in real-time. The array of hybrid cantilevers with integrated strain sensors has the potential to satisfy the need for innovative analytic platforms owing to its high throughput and simplified data analysis.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2021-06-11", "authors": ["Dong-SuKim", "Yun-JinJeong", "ArunkumarShanmugasundaram", "Nomin-ErdeneOyunbaatar", "JongsungPark", "Eung-SamKim", "Bong-KeeLee", "Dong-WeonLee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2021.113380"}
{"title": "Androgen receptor inhibition alleviated inflammation in experimental autoimmune myocarditis by increasing autophagy in macrophages.", "abstract": "Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) is characterized by pronounced macrophage infiltration, cardiac necrosis, and cardiac fibrosis. Our previous studies have demonstrated that suppressed androgen receptor (AR) enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair by decreasing M1 macrophages and increasing M2 macrophages in an EAM model. Given that autophagy mediates inflammatory response in macrophages, we investigated whether AR inhibition executes its protective role in inflammation through the autophagy pathway in EAM.\nTo determine whether AR inhibition can perform its anti-inflammatory effects by upregulating autophagy, we pre-treated mice with 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Immunofluorescence assay and Western blot were used to detect autophagy levels and autophagy activity in five different groups. Immunofluorescence marked F4/80 and LC3 to illustrate the autophagy level in macrophages. TUNEL assays were used to detect the apoptosis level in heart tissue of five different groups.\nWe demonstrated that AR inhibition resolves injury with sustained inhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy, especially in macrophages. Increased LC3II/I expression corroborated complete autolysosome formation detected by electron microscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the AR inhibition group by Western blot. These effects could be reversed within 3-MA, a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increased apoptosis and inflammation, which could be attenuated by AR inhibition.\nAR inhibition alleviates the inflammatory response and tissue apoptosis by enhancing autophagy, especially in macrophages.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2021-06-11", "authors": ["W-HMa", "X-GZhang", "L-LGuo", "J-BZhang", "F-TWei", "Q-HLu", "HDu", "Y-RKong", "XWang", "D-LXu"], "doi": "10.26355/eurrev_202105_25944"}

We herein hypothesized that transplantation of an aligned cardiac tissue derived from iPS cells has therapeutic effects in a porcine ischemic cardiomyopathy model as a preclinical trial.\nAligned cardiac tissues were developed by culturing high-purity iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes in xeno-free conditions and transplanting them into infarct porcine hearts (iPS-CM group, n\u00a0=\u00a07; control, n\u00a0=\u00a06). Three months after treatment, therapeutic efficacy was evaluated functionally and histologically.\nIn vitro assessment revealed that the aligned cardiac tissue containing high purity cardiomyocytes contracted homogeneously and had excellent mechanical properties. In the in vivo study, the left ventricular ejection fraction of the iPS-CM group was significantly greater than that of the control group, 3 months after transplantation (37.8% \u00b1 2.3% vs 28.3% \u00b1 2.5%, p < 0.05). Pathologically, attenuated interstitial fibrosis, attenuation of hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, and an increased capillary density were also prominent in the iPS-CM group.

Thus, a timely resolution of inflammation and a firmly regulated balance between regulatory and inflammatory mechanisms can be helpful. Molecular- and cellular-based approaches modulating immune response post-MI have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Exosomes are essential mediators of cell-to-cell communications, which are effective in modulating immune responses and immune cells following MI, improving the repair process of infarcted myocardium and maintaining ventricular function via the crosstalk among immune cells or between immune cells and myocardial cells. The present review aimed to seek the role of immune cell-secreted exosomes in infarcted myocardium post-MI, together with mechanisms behind their repairing impact on the damaged myocardium.

{"title": "Validation of using cardioplegic solutions for preserving cardiac function in isolated rabbit heart assays.", "abstract": "Cardioplegic solutions were first developed to preserve heart function during cardiac surgeries and heart transplants but have application in the nonclinical setting. Due to lack of lab space in the vivarium, cardioplegic solution was used to conserve cardiac function for ex-vivo studies performed in a separate building. All studies in this report were conducted with isolated female rabbit hearts (IRHs) via retrograde perfusion using the Langendorff apparatus to investigate if cardioplegia usage affects cardiac function.\nCardioplegia was achieved with a hyperkalemia (27\u00a0mM KCL) solution kept at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Cardiac function was assessed by measuring ECG parameters, left ventricular contractility, and coronary flow under constant perfusion pressure. IRHs were cannulated with Krebs Henseleit buffer (KH) either fresh or after cardioplegic solution storage (C-IRH). Three comparisons were performed with and without cardioplegia; (i) direct side-by side studies of cardiac function; (ii) pharmacological responses to typical ion channels blockers, dofetilide, flecainide, and diltiazem; (iii) retrospective evaluation of cardiac functions in a large sample of hearts.\nIn the side-by-side comparisons, cardioplegia-stored IRHs (C-IRH; storage time 90\u00a0min) had similar electrocardiographic (ECG) and hemodynamic parameters to fresh-cannulated hearts with KH buffer (KH-IRH). In addition, responses to dofetilide, flecainide, and diltiazem, were similar for C-IRH and KH-IRH hearts. Over the years (2006-2011), baseline data was collected from 79 hearts without cardioplegia and 100 hearts with cardioplegia (C-IRH; storage time 15\u00a0min), which showed no meaningful differences in a retrospective analysis.\nCardiac function was preserved after cardioplegic treatment, however, coronary flow rates were decreased (-19.3%) in C-IRH hearts which indicated an altered coronary vascular tone.

In this study, a method of fabricating custom wall-less flow phantoms from a tissue-mimicking gel using 3D printed inserts is developed.\nA 3D blood vessel geometry example of a bifurcated artery model was 3D printed in polyvinyl alcohol, embedded in tissue-mimicking gel, and subsequently dissolved to create a phantom. Uniaxial compression testing was performed to determine the Young's moduli of the five gel types. Angle-independent, ultrasound-based imaging modalities, Vector Flow Imaging (VFI) and Blood Speckle Imaging (BSI), were utilized for flow visualization of a straight channel phantom.\nA wall-less phantom of the bifurcated artery was fabricated with minimal bubbles and continuous flow demonstrated. Additionally, flow was visualized through a straight channel phantom by VFI and BSI. The available gel types are suitable for mimicking a variety of tissue types, including cardiac tissue and blood vessels.\nCustom, tissue-mimicking flow phantoms can be fabricated using the developed methodology and have potential for use in a variety of applications, including ultrasound-based imaging methods. This is the first reported use of BSI with an in vitro flow phantom.", "journal": "Cardiovascular engineering and technology", "date": "2021-06-04", "authors": ["Megan ELaughlin", "Sam EStephens", "Jamie AHestekin", "Morten OJensen"], "doi": "10.1007/s13239-021-00546-7\n10.1016/S1369-7021(11)70059-1\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2020.03.011\n10.1080/03091902.2019.1640309\n10.1016/s0301-5629(03)00053-x\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.10.005\n10.1016/j.eml.2017.09.009\n10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2591946\n10.1118/1.4951729\n10.1007/s13239-020-00504-9\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1879\n10.1089/3dp.2013.0010\n10.3389/fsurg.2020.626212\n10.1016/j.ppedcard.2019.02.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.035\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.02.012\n10.1111/echo.14391\n10.1186/s12938-016-0151-8\n10.1002/mp.13058\n10.3233/THC-2007-15404\n10.1007/s00348-011-1258-0\n10.1038/s41578-019-0169-1\n10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2636129\n10.1007/s13239-019-00444-z\n10.1007/s13239-019-00448-9\n10.1002/term.46\n10.1109/58.677749\n10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2600763\n10.4172/2329-8847.1000156\n10.1515/bmt-2014-0028\n10.3389/fgene.2015.00112\n10.1515/cdbme-2018-0025\n10.1177/016173469802000403\n10.1364/BOE.3.001381\n10.1038/nature09024\n10.1016/s0301-5629(82)80006-9\n10.1007/s40670-016-0258-3\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa9e2c\n10.1007/s11548-020-02201-3\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03602\n10.1016/j.echo.2019.11.003\n10.4103/JMU.JMU_1_17\n10.1186/s12968-015-0154-9\n10.3390/polym12092120\n10.1016/s0301-5629(97)00277-9\n10.1007/s13239-019-00417-2\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2019.04.024\n10.1186/s12891-016-0998-7\n10.1117/1.JMI.6.2.021603\n10.1186/s41205-020-00072-7\n10.1117/12.2292736\n10.1007/s003300000378\n10.1186/s12968-016-0275-9\n10.1007/s10439-018-2085-8\n10.3390/app9183811\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2762860\n10.1007/s00348-010-0958-1\n10.1088/0031-9155/52/20/N02"}

Here we show that instruction of aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells with an experimentally engineered morphogen signalling centre, that functions as an organizer, results in the development of embryo-like entities (embryoids). In situ hybridization, immunolabelling, cell tracking and transcriptomic analyses show that these embryoids form the three germ layers through a gastrulation process and that they exhibit a wide range of developmental structures, highly similar to neurula-stage mouse embryos. Embryoids are organized around an axial chordamesoderm, with a dorsal neural plate that displays histological properties similar to the murine embryo neuroepithelium and that folds into a neural tube patterned antero-posteriorly from the posterior midbrain to the tip of the tail. Lateral to the chordamesoderm, embryoids display somitic and intermediate mesoderm, with beating cardiac tissue anteriorly and formation of a vasculature network. Ventrally, embryoids differentiate a primitive gut tube, which is patterned both antero-posteriorly and dorso-ventrally.

{"title": "Percolation and tortuosity in heart-like cells.", "abstract": "In the last several years, quite a few papers on the joint question of transport, tortuosity and percolation have appeared in the literature, dealing with passage of miscellaneous liquids or electrical currents in different media. However, these methods have not been applied to the passage of action potential in heart fibrosis (HF), which is crucial for problems of heart arrhythmia, especially of atrial tachycardia and fibrillation. In this work we address the HF problem from these aspects. A cellular automaton model is used to analyze percolation and transport of a distributed-fibrosis inflicted heart-like tissue. Although based on a rather simple mathematical model, it leads to several important outcomes: (1) It is shown that, for a single wave front (as the one emanated by the heart's sinus node), the percolation of heart-like matrices is exactly similar to the forest fire case. (2) It is shown that, on the average, the shape of the transport (a question not dealt with in relation to forest fire, and deals with the delay of action potential when passing a fibrotic tissue) behaves like a Gaussian. (3) Moreover, it is shown that close to the percolation threshold the parameters of this Gaussian behave in a critical way. From the physical point of view, these three results are an important contribution to the general percolation investigation. The relevance of our results to cardiological issues, specifically to the question of reentry initiation, are discussed and it is shown that: (A) Without an ectopic source and under a mere sinus node operation, no arrhythmia is generated, and (B) A sufficiently high refractory period could prevent some reentry mechanisms, even in partially fibrotic heart tissue.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["RRabinovitch", "YBiton", "DBraunstein", "IAviram", "RThieberger", "ARabinovitch"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-90892-2\n10.1016/j.physrep.2015.03.003\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.1629\n10.1016/0378-4371(92)90032-L\n10.1103/PhysRevE.100.013115\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2010.05.003\n10.2136/sssaj2013.01.0089\n10.1088/1751-8121/aa95c7\n10.1103/PhysRevE.94.022111\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.03.019\n10.1038/s41569-018-0104-y\n10.1103/PhysRevE.100.010401\n10.1103/PhysRevE.100.062406\n10.1038/srep20835\n10.1038/s41598-020-57449-1\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.915\n10.1002/2017RG000558\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.07.038\n10.1080/13658810801949850.S2CID14833639\n10.1016/j.ces.2015.03.043\n10.1038/s41598-018-34304-y\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006597\n10.1038/s41598-018-20450-w\n10.1016/j.mam.2018.07.001\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2006.02336.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvx163"}
{"title": "Engineering aligned human cardiac muscle using developmentally inspired fibronectin micropatterns.", "abstract": "Cardiac two-dimensional tissues were engineered using biomimetic micropatterns based on the fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) of the embryonic heart. The goal of this developmentally-inspired, in vitro approach was to identify cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions in the microenvironment of the early 4-chambered vertebrate heart that drive cardiomyocyte organization and alignment. To test this, biomimetic micropatterns based on confocal imaging of fibronectin in embryonic chick myocardium were created and compared to control micropatterns designed with 2 or 20 \u00b5m wide fibronectin lines. Results show that embryonic chick cardiomyocytes have a unique density-dependent alignment on the biomimetic micropattern that is mediated in part by N-cadherin, suggesting that both cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions play an important role in the formation of aligned myocardium. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes also showed density-dependent alignment on the biomimetic micropattern but were overall less well organized. Interestingly, the addition of human adult cardiac fibroblasts and conditioning with T3 hormone were both shown to increase human cardiomyocyte alignment. In total, these results show that cardiomyocyte maturation state, cardiomyocyte-cardiomyocyte and cardiomyocyte-fibroblast interactions, and cardiomyocyte-ECM interactions can all play a role when engineering anisotropic cardiac tissues in vitro and provides insight as to how these factors may influence cardiogenesis in vivo.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["IvanBatalov", "QuentinJallerat", "SeanKim", "JacquelineBliley", "Adam WFeinberg"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-87550-y\n10.1038/nm.3545\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.1038/s41551-018-0280-4\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf8781\n10.1038/nmat4956\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043\n10.1258/ebm.2010.010239\n10.1038/srep32068\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.06.001\n10.1021/acsami.5b11671\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.12.2183\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.062\n10.1038/s41551-018-0271-5\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.11.019\n10.1161/hh0202.103644\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.08.006\n10.1002/jbm.b.31862\n10.1038/nmat2316\n10.1007/s12195-015-0412-9\n10.1039/c7bm00132k\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.05.021\n10.1007/s12013-016-0758-1\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1021/acsami.9b02446\n10.1529/biophysj.107.124545\n10.1242/bio.20133830\n10.1007/s12195-018-0522-2\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.045\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310277\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.08.037\n10.1126/science.1177350\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.10.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.079\n10.3390/cells9020285\n10.1038/415198a\n10.1016/s0975-3583(10)11011-0\n10.1161/01.cir.100.suppl_2.ii-262\n10.1242/jcs.221606\n10.1023/A:1009809520194\n10.1073/pnas.1904684116\n10.1161/01.RES.0000156274.72390.2c\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1155/2019/8203950\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305365\n10.1093/toxsci/kfz168\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311213\n10.1002/stem.1331\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.005\n10.1089/scd.2014.0533\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1155/2017/7648409\n10.1089/scd.2014.0211\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311920\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1038/s41598-017-08713-4\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.04.005\n10.1182/blood.v90.8.3073\n10.1007/s10456-009-9136-6\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.07.005\n10.1161/01.ATV.18.9.1363\n10.1016/j.ceb.2008.06.001\n10.1016/j.matbio.2005.06.008\n10.1126/science.1146885\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223412\n10.1016/j.tcm.2009.12.001\n10.1039/c4lc01095g\n10.1016/j.physd.2019.02.001\n10.1073/pnas.0706805105\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.208101\n10.1016/j.tcb.2012.08.012\n10.1039/c1sm06060k\n10.1038/srep24726\n10.1002/jbm.a.31578\n10.1073/pnas.1311120110\n10.1371/journal.pone.0038147\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.03.016\n10.1002/adma.19940060719\n10.1006/excr.1997.3668\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00261-2\n10.1038/nMeth.2999\n10.1038/nmeth.3210"}
{"title": "Next generation of heart regenerative therapies: progress and promise of cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The adult heart is a vital and highly specialized organ of the human body, with limited capability of self-repair and regeneration in case of injury or disease. Engineering biomimetic cardiac tissue to regenerate the heart has been an ambition in the field of tissue engineering, tracing back to the 1990s. Increased understanding of human stem cell biology and advances in process engineering have provided an unlimited source of cells, particularly cardiomyocytes, for the development of functional cardiac muscle, even though pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes poorly resemble those of the adult heart. This review outlines key biology-inspired strategies reported to improve cardiomyocyte maturation features and current biofabrication approaches developed to engineer clinically relevant cardiac tissues.

However, two-dimensional (2D) cells often fail to faithfully reflect the physiological structure and function of the heart. Considering the contractile function is the most critical and easy-to-understand function of cardiomyocytes, the engineered cardiac tissues (ECT) with mechanical properties may serve as an appropriate three-dimensional (3D) platform for drug evaluation. At present, there are various methods to generate ECTs, some of which are quite costly. In the present study, we proposed that human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells, as a cost-effective and accessible cell source, can promote the compaction and remodeling of ECTs. The HFFs derived ECTs displayed stable structural and functional characteristics with a higher performance-to-price ratio.

Prolific protocols have been developed and tested in small and large animals, but, as clinical cardiac surgeons, we have not arrived at the privilege of utilizing any of them in our clinical practice. The question arises as to why this is. The heart is a unique organ, anatomically and functionally. It is not an easy target to replicate with current techniques, or even to support in its viability and function. Currently, available therapies fail to reverse the loss of functional cardiac tissue, the fundamental pathology remains unaddressed, and heart transplantation is an ultima ratio treatment option. Owing to the equivocal results of cell-based therapies, several strategies have been pursued to overcome the limitations of the current treatment options. Preclinical data, as well as first-in-human studies, conducted to-date have provided important insights into the understanding of injection-based approaches for myocardial restoration. In light of the available data, injectable biomaterials suitable for transcatheter delivery appear to have the highest translational potential.

{"title": "Cytoprotective Potential of Aged Garlic Extract (AGE) and Its Active Constituent, S-allyl-l-cysteine, in Presence of Carvedilol during Isoproterenol-Induced Myocardial Disturbance and Metabolic Derangements in Rats.", "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the potential interaction of aged garlic extract (AGE) with carvedilol (CAR), as well as to investigate the role of S-allyl-l-cysteine (SAC), an active constituent of AGE, in rats with isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial dysfunction. At the end of three weeks of treatment with AGE (2 and 5 mL/kg) or SAC (13.1 and 32.76 mg/kg), either alone or along with CAR (10 mg/kg) in the respective groups of animals, ISO was administered subcutaneously to induce myocardial damage. Myocardial infarction (MI) diagnostic predictor enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine kinase (CK-MB), were measured in both serum and heart tissue homogenates (HTH). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) were estimated in HTH. When compared with other groups, the combined therapy of high doses of AGE and SAC given alone or together with CAR caused a significant decrease in serum LDH and CK-MB activities. Further, significant rise in the LDH and CK-MB activities in HTH was noticed in the combined groups of AGE and SAC with CAR. It was also observed that both doses of AGE and SAC significantly increased endogenous antioxidants in HTH. Furthermore, histopathological observations corroborated the biochemical findings. The cytoprotective potential of SAC and AGE were dose-dependent, and SAC was more potent than AGE. The protection offered by aged garlic may be attributed to SAC. Overall, the results indicated that a high dose of AGE and its constituent SAC, when combined with carvedilol, has a synergistic effect in preventing morphological and physiological changes in the myocardium during ISO-induced myocardial damage.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["Syed Mohammed BasheeruddinAsdaq", "ObulesuChalla", "Abdulhakeem SAlamri", "Walaa FAlsanie", "MajidAlhomrani", "Abdulrahman HadiAlmutiri", "Majed SadunAlshammari"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules26113203\n10.1080/01480545.2020.1738454\n10.1016/j.phymed.2010.07.012\n10.1016/j.cbi.2009.07.022\n10.3390/antiox9070619\n10.3390/nu12030872\n10.2174/092986711796504664\n10.1007/s11130-011-0216-6\n10.1186/s12906-020-02932-5\n10.1093/jn/136.3.782S\n10.1016/j.neures.2006.04.018\n10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06639.x\n10.1093/jn/137.10.2264\n10.1016/j.tox.2006.04.039\n10.1631/jzus.2006.B0725\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000002523\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.09.076\n10.1016/0002-9149(90)90515-3\n10.1016/0735-1097(95)00012-S\n10.1016/0002-9149(87)91089-7\n10.1056/NEJM199605233342101\n10.1007/BF00315487\n10.1111/j.1527-3466.1992.tb00242.x\n10.2165/00003495-198800366-00028\n10.1002/ptr.3009\n10.1536/jhj.44.979\n10.1016/0022-2828(74)90081-9\n10.1093/jn/131.3.1080S\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.07.021\n10.1093/jn/131.3.1010S\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1261\n10.3390/foods9081136\n10.1016/j.phrs.2004.03.004\n10.3390/pr9030557\n10.1038/ejcn.2012.178\n10.1016/j.cbi.2008.12.012\n10.1152/ajpheart.00636.2004\n10.1016/j.lfs.2006.11.028\n10.1186/1475-2891-1-4\n10.4103/0253-7613.125185\n10.1093/jn/136.3.855S\n10.1177/153537020523001012\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1968.tb00428.x\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.03.016"}
{"title": "Toxicological Evaluation of Novel Cyclohexenone Derivative in an Animal Model through Histopathological and Biochemical Techniques.", "abstract": "Toxicity studies were conducted to provide safety data of potential drug candidates by determining lethal and toxic doses. This study was designed for pre-clinical evaluation of novel cyclohexenone derivative with respect to the acute and sub-acute toxicity along with the diabetogenic potential. Acute and sub-acute toxicity were assessed after intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of the investigational compound through selected doses for 21 days. This was followed by assessment of isolated body organs (liver, kidney, heart and pancreas) via biochemical indicators and histopathological techniques. No signs of toxicity were revealed in the study of acute toxicity. Similarly, a sub-acute toxicity study showed no significant difference in biochemical indicators on 11th and 21st days between treated and control groups. However, in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and random blood glucose/sugar (RBS) values, significant differences were recorded. Histopathological evaluation of liver, kidney, pancreas and heart tissues revealed mild to severe changes in the form of steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis and myofibrillary damages on 11th and 21st days of treatment. In conclusion, the median lethal dose of the tested compound was expected to be greater than 500 mg/kg.

{"title": "Cardiac Organoids to Model and Heal Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathies.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering aims at creating contractile structures that can optimally reproduce the features of human cardiac tissue. These constructs are becoming valuable tools to model some of the cardiac functions, to set preclinical platforms for drug testing, or to alternatively be used as therapies for cardiac repair approaches. Most of the recent developments in cardiac tissue engineering have been made possible by important advances regarding the efficient generation of cardiac cells from pluripotent stem cells and the use of novel biomaterials and microfabrication methods. Different combinations of cells, biomaterials, scaffolds, and geometries are however possible, which results in different types of structures with gradual complexities and abilities to mimic the native cardiac tissue. Here, we intend to cover key aspects of tissue engineering applied to cardiology and the consequent development of cardiac organoids.

Malignant hypertension is a relatively rare but extremely severe form of hypertension accompanied with heart, brain, and renal impairment. Resveratrol, a recently described grape-derived, polyphenolic antioxidant molecule, has been proposed as an effective agent in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to examine chronic resveratrol administration on blood pressure, oxidative stress, and inflammation, with special emphasis on cardiac structure and function in two models of experimental hypertension. The experiments were performed in spontaneously (SHRs) and malignantly hypertensive rats (MHRs). The chronic administration of resveratrol significantly decreased blood pressure in both spontaneously and malignant hypertensive animals. The resveratrol treatment ameliorated morphological changes in the heart tissue. The immunohistochemistry of the heart tissue after resveratrol treatment showed that both TGF-\u03b2 and Bax were not present in the myocytes of SHRs and were present mainly in the myocytes of MHRs. Resveratrol suppressed lipid peroxidation and significantly improved oxidative status and release of NO.

{"title": "Electroactive Polymeric Composites to Mimic the Electromechanical Properties of Myocardium in Cardiac Tissue Repair.", "abstract": "Due to the limited regenerative capabilities of cardiomyocytes, incidents of myocardial infarction can cause permanent damage to native myocardium through the formation of acellular, non-conductive scar tissue during wound repair. The generation of scar tissue in the myocardium compromises the biomechanical and electrical properties of the heart which can lead to further cardiac problems including heart failure. Currently, patients suffering from cardiac failure due to scarring undergo transplantation but limited donor availability and complications (i.e., rejection or infectious pathogens) exclude many individuals from successful transplant. Polymeric tissue engineering scaffolds provide an alternative approach to restore normal myocardium structure and function after damage by acting as a provisional matrix to support cell attachment, infiltration and stem cell delivery. However, issues associated with mechanical property mismatch and the limited electrical conductivity of these constructs when compared to native myocardium reduces their clinical applicability. Therefore, composite polymeric scaffolds with conductive reinforcement components (i.e., metal, carbon, or conductive polymers) provide tunable mechanical and electroactive properties to mimic the structure and function of natural myocardium in force transmission and electrical stimulation.

{"title": "The role of lactate in sepsis and COVID-19: Perspective from contracting skeletal muscle metabolism.", "abstract": "What is the topic of this review? Lactate is considered an important substrate for mitochondria in the muscles, heart and brain during exercise and is the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys. In this light, we review the (patho)physiology of lactate metabolism in sepsis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). What advances does it highlight? Elevated blood lactate is strongly associated with mortality in septic patients. Lactate seems unrelated to tissue hypoxia but is likely to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction and high adrenergic stimulation. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit near-normal blood lactate, indicating preserved mitochondrial function, despite a systemic hyperinflammatory state similar to sepsis.\nIn critically ill patients, elevated plasma lactate is often interpreted as a sign of organ hypoperfusion and/or tissue hypoxia. This view on lactate is likely to have been influenced by the pioneering exercise physiologists around 1920. August Krogh identified an oxygen deficit at the onset of exercise that was later related to an oxygen 'debt' and lactate accumulation by A.\u00a0V. Hill. Lactate is considered to be the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys during submaximal exercise, but hepatic elimination is attenuated by splanchnic vasoconstriction during high-intensity exercise, causing an exponential increase in blood lactate. With the development of stable isotope tracers, lactate has become established as an important energy source for muscle, brain and heart tissue, where it is used for mitochondrial respiration. Plasma lactate\u00a0>\u00a04\u00a0mM is strongly associated with mortality in septic shock, with no direct link between lactate release and tissue hypoxia. Herein, we provide evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and adrenergic stimulation as explanations for the sepsis-induced hyperlactataemia.

However, lactate dehydrogenase, which controls the formation of lactate, is markedly elevated in plasma and strongly associated with mortality in severe COVID-19.

This increase in cardiac ventricular fibrosis is due to activation of resident fibroblasts, although how these cells operate within the 3-dimensional (3-D) heart, at baseline or after activation, is not well understood. To examine how fibroblasts contribute to heart disease and their dynamics in the 3-D heart, a refined CLARITY-based tissue clearing and imaging method was developed that shows fluorescently labeled cardiac fibroblasts within the entire mouse heart. Tissue resident fibroblasts were genetically labeled using Rosa26-loxP-eGFP florescent reporter mice crossed with the cardiac fibroblast expressing Tcf21-MerCreMer knock-in line. This technique was used to observe fibroblast localization dynamics throughout the entire adult left ventricle in healthy mice and in fibrotic mouse models of heart disease. Interestingly, in one injury model, unique patterns of cardiac fibroblasts were observed in the injured mouse heart that followed bands of wrapped fibers in the contractile direction. In ischemic injury models, fibroblast death occurred, followed by repopulation from the infarct border zone. Collectively, this refined cardiac tissue clarifying technique and digitized imaging system allows for 3-D visualization of cardiac fibroblasts in the heart without the limitations of antibody penetration failure or previous issues surrounding lost fluorescence due to tissue processing.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2021-06-01", "authors": ["Demetria MFischesser", "Evan CMeyer", "MichelleSargent", "Jeffery DMolkentin"], "doi": "10.3791/62023"}

Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-derived exosomes have been found to be effective in alleviating MI, while the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the protective effects of EPC-derived exosomal miR-1246 and miR-1290 on MI-induced injury and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. The exosomes were extracted from EPCs; gene expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR, and protein expression levels were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The angiogenesis and proliferation of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) were determined by tube formation assay and immunofluorescence staining of PKH67, respectively. Luciferase reporter, CHIP, and EMSA assays determined the interaction between miR-1246/1290 and the targeted genes (EFL5 and SP1). The protective effects of miR-1246/1290 on MI were evaluated in a rat model of MI. EPC-derived exosomes significantly upregulated miR-1246 and miR-1290 expression and promoted phenotypic changes of fibroblasts to endothelial cells, angiogenesis, and proliferation in HCFs. Exosomes from EPCs with miR-1246 or miR-1290 mimics transfection promoted phenotypic changes of fibroblasts to endothelial cells and angiogenesis in HCFs, while exosomes from EPCs with miR-1246 or miR-1290 knockdown showed opposite effects in HCFs. Mechanistically, miR-1246 and miR-1290 from EPC-derived exosomes induced upregulation of ELF5 and SP1, respectively, by targeting the promoter regions of corresponding genes. Overexpression of both ELF5 and SP1 enhanced phenotypic changes of fibroblasts to endothelial cells and angiogenesis in HCFs pretreated with exosomes from EPCs with miR-1246 or miR-1290 mimics transfection, while knockdown of both EFL5 and SP1 exerted the opposite effects in HCFs. Both ELF5 and SP1 can bind to the promoter of CD31, leading to the upregulation of CD31 in HCFs.

One strategy aspiring to prevent or even to reverse HF is based on the transplantation of cardiac tissue-engineered (cTE) constructs. These patient-specific constructs aim to closely resemble the native myocardium and, upon implantation on the diseased tissue, support and restore cardiac function, thereby preventing the development of HF. However, cTE constructs off-the-shelf availability in the clinical arena critically depends on the development of efficient preservation methodologies. Short- and long-term preservation of cTE constructs would enable transportation and direct availability. Herein, currently available methods, from normothermic- to hypothermic- to cryopreservation, for the preservation of cardiomyocytes, whole-heart, and regenerative materials are reviewed. A theoretical foundation and recommendations for future research on developing cTE construct specific preservation methods are provided. Current research suggests that vitrification can be a promising procedure to ensure long-term cryopreservation of cTE constructs, despite the need of high doses of cytotoxic cryoprotective agents. Instead, short-term cTE construct preservation can be achieved at normothermic or hypothermic temperatures by administration of protective additives.

{"title": "An Overview of Chemical and Biological Materials lead to Damage and Repair of Heart Tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are major causes of mortality in developing countries. One of the challenges during CVDs studies is the creation of a damaged model of the heart. Many injured models of cardiac diseases are created by using chemical and biological materials. Many approaches were applied to simulate heart injury for investigating CVDs. In previous years, animal models could be used as a useful pattern in many investigations about the pathogenesis of the heart. Nowadays it has been proven that there are many differences between human and animal models in terms of responses or reactions to treatments. For such reasons, researchers prefer to use cellular models alongside the animal models for studying heart diseases.\nIn this review, we collected information about some chemical and biological materials used to create damaged-heart models both in vitro and in vivo. After explaining the materials that induce cardiac damage, we explicate some methods for repairing the damage of heart. Finally, the role of extracellular vesicles as an important biological candidate for repairing heart damage is briefly discussed.\nThis mini-review tried to explain some methods which can induce cardiac damage and repair of heart cells by use chemical and biological materials.

The change in surface morphology of SF scaffolds depending on SF concentration (1-6%, w/v) and increase in their porosity upon application of unidirectional freezing were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Swelling ratio was found to increase 2.4 fold when SF amount was decreased from 4% to 2%. To avoid excessive swelling, 4% SF scaffold with swelling ratio of 10% (w/w) was chosen for further studies.Biodegradation rate of SF scaffolds depended on enzymatic activity was found to be 75% weight loss of SF scaffolds at the day 14. The phenotype of hAD-MSCs and their multi-linage potential into chondrocytes, osteocytes, and adipocytes were shown by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining, respectively.The viability of hAD-MSCs on 3D SF scaffolds was determined as 90%, 118%, and 138% after 1, 7, and 14\u2009days, respectively. The use of 3D SF scaffolds was associated with increased production of cardiomyogenic biomarkers: \u03b1-actinin, troponin I, connexin 43, and myosin heavy chain.

Notably, chronic inflammation serves a crucial role in cardiac dysfunction and HF. Appropriate cardiomyocyte\u2011fibroblast communication is essential for cardiac function. In addition, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the main cellular population in the cardiac microenvironment; therefore, determining the role of CFs in HF progression and the associated molecular basis is important. In the present study, ELISAs were performed to detect inflammatory factors in the sera of patients with HF and their association with CF activation was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The mechanism underlying the proinflammatory phenotype of CFs was investigated via western blotting. Notably, the levels of IL10 and TNF\u2011\u03b1 were significantly increased in the sera of patients with HF. Further analysis revealed that CFs were extensively activated in the cardiac tissues of patients with HF and released excessive amounts of cytokines, which could impair the viability of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, low\u2011density lipoprotein (LDL)\u2011induced NLRC3 inflammasome was activated in CFs, which gave rise to proinflammatory phenotypes. Targeting LDL in CFs significantly improved the functioning of cardiomyocytes and inhibited apoptosis. These findings highlighted the critical role of LDL in inflammasome activation; to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to reveal that CF\u2011induced microenvironmental inflammation may suppress cardiomyocyte viability.

Herein, a di-Fmoc-based hydrogelator containing the cell-adhesive Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) fragment that forms a mechanically stable, self-healing hydrogel is designed. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals the presence of RGD segments on the surface of the hydrogel fibers, highlighting their cell adherence capacity. Aiming to impart conductivity, the 3D network of the hydrogel is further nanoengineered by incorporating polyaniline (PAni). The composite hydrogels demonstrate semiconductivity, excellent antibacterial activity, and DNA binding capacity.

{"title": "ECSIT is a critical limiting factor for cardiac function.", "abstract": "Evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways (ECSIT) is a protein with roles in early development, activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, and production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) that facilitates clearance of intracellular bacteria like Salmonella. ECSIT is also an important assembly factor for mitochondrial complex I. Unlike the murine form of Ecsit (mEcsit), we demonstrate here that human ECSIT (hECSIT) is highly labile. To explore whether the instability of hECSIT affects functions previously ascribed to its murine counterpart, we created a potentially novel transgenic mouse in which the murine Ecsit gene is replaced by the human ECSIT gene. The humanized mouse has low levels of hECSIT protein, in keeping with its intrinsic instability. Whereas low-level expression of hECSIT was capable of fully compensating for mEcsit in its roles in early development and activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, macrophages from humanized mice showed impaired clearance of Salmonella that was associated with reduced production of mROS. Notably, severe cardiac hypertrophy was manifested in aging humanized mice, leading to premature death. The cellular and molecular basis of this phenotype was delineated by showing that low levels of human ECSIT protein led to a marked reduction in assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex I with impaired oxidative phosphorylation and reduced production of ATP. Cardiac tissue from humanized hECSIT mice also showed reduced mitochondrial fusion and more fission but impaired clearance of fragmented mitochondria. A cardiomyocyte-intrinsic role for Ecsit in mitochondrial function and cardioprotection is also demonstrated. We also show that cardiac fibrosis and damage in humans correlated with low expression of human ECSIT.

It is well known that MI causes additional injury during blood flow restoration in ischaemic myocardium. Boeravinone B (BB) is a well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drug. We investigated the cardioprotective effect of BB drug against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MI in rats in this experimental study, along with we analysed its underlying mechanism. Adult Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were treated subcutaneously with ISO (45\u00a0mg/kg), then divided into groups and then given BB drug was administered orally. The cardioprotective effect of BB on ISO-induced MI rats was analysed by estimating the heart injury markers, antioxidant pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory parameters. We also detected quantified expression of inflammation and apoptosis-related marker protein family. We estimated the effect of BB drug on GUT microbiota in ISO-induced MI rats and scrutinized the histopathological variations in heart tissues. BB treatment significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) diminished the level of heart markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin (TnT), creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase isoenzymes MB (CK-MB). BB treatment also altered the antioxidant parameters and reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and tissues. Additionally, the histopathological aspects demonstrated that the pathological changes observed in the heart tissue of the ISO group rats were suppressed by the BB treatment to varying degrees. Furthermore, the expressions of caspase-3, p53, caspase-9, Bax, interleukin-6 (IL-6), cytochrome C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in the heart tissue were down-regulated whereas the Bcl-2 expression seemed to be enhanced. BB treatment not only alleviated ISO-induced gut dysbiosis by its enhanced specified Firmicutesto-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio but also maintained the relative abundance of major bacteria such as Clostridium IV, Butyricicoccus, Clostridium XIVs, Akkermansia and Roseburia.

{"title": "Requirements for a Robust Animal Model to Investigate the Disease Mechanism of Autoimmune Complications Associated With ARF/RHD.", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Acute Rheumatic Fever/Rheumatic Heart Disease (ARF/RHD) and associated neurobehavioral complications including Sydenham's chorea (SC) is complex. Disease complications triggered by Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection are confined to human and determining the early events leading to pathology requires a robust animal model that reflects the hallmark features of the disease. However, modeling these conditions in a laboratory animal, of a uniquely human disease is challenging. Animal models including cattle, sheep, pig, dog, cat, guinea pigs rats and mice have been used extensively to dissect molecular mechanisms of the autoimmune inflammatory responses in ARF/RHD. Despite the characteristic limitations of some animal models, several rodent models have significantly contributed to better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underpinning features of ARF/RHD. In the Lewis rat autoimmune valvulitis model the development of myocarditis and valvulitis with the infiltration of mononuclear cells along with generation of antibodies that cross-react with cardiac tissue proteins following exposure to GAS antigens were found to be similar to ARF/RHD. We have recently shown that Lewis rats injected with recombinant GAS antigens simultaneously developed cardiac and neurobehavioral changes. Since ARF/RHD is multifactorial in origin, an animal model which exhibit the characteristics of several of the cardinal diagnostic criteria observed in ARF/RHD, would be advantageous to determine the early immune responses to facilitate biomarker discovery as well as provide a suitable model to evaluate treatment options, safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates.

Here, we demonstrate successful production of functional cardiac tissue microspheres through direct differentiation of hydrogel encapsulated hiPSCs. To form the microspheres, hiPSCs were suspended within the photocrosslinkable biomaterial, PEG-fibrinogen (25 million cells/mL), and encapsulated at a rate of 420,000\u00a0cells/minute using a custom microfluidic system. Even at this high cell density and rapid production rate, high intra-batch and batch-to-batch reproducibility was achieved. Following microsphere formation, hiPSCs maintained high cell viability and continued to grow within and beyond the original PEG-fibrinogen matrix. These initially soft microspheres (<250\u00a0Pa) supported efficient cardiac differentiation; spontaneous contractions initiated by differentiation day 8, and the microspheres contained >75% cardiomyocytes (CMs). CMs responded appropriately to pharmacological stimuli and exhibited 1:1 capture up to 6.0\u00a0Hz when electrically paced. Over time, cells formed cell-cell junctions and aligned myofibril fibers; engineered cardiac microspheres were maintained in culture over 3 years. The capability to rapidly generate uniform cardiac microsphere tissues is critical for advancing downstream applications including biomanufacturing, multi-well plate drug screening, and injection-based regenerative therapies.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2021-05-24", "authors": ["Ferdous BFinklea", "YuanTian", "PetraKerscher", "Wen JSeeto", "Morgan EEllis", "Elizabeth ALipke"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120818"}
{"title": "A novel method to correct repolarization time estimation from unipolar electrograms distorted by standard filtering.", "abstract": "Reliable patient-specific ventricular repolarization times (RTs) can identify regions of functional block or afterdepolarizations, indicating arrhythmogenic cardiac tissue and the risk of sudden cardiac death. Unipolar electrograms (UEs) record electric potentials, and the Wyatt method has been shown to be accurate for estimating RT from a UE. High-pass filtering is an important step in processing UEs, however, it is known to distort the T-wave phase of the UE, which may compromise the accuracy of the Wyatt method. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of high-pass filtering, and improve RT estimates derived from filtered UEs. We first generated a comprehensive set of UEs, corresponding to early and late activation and repolarization, that were then high-pass filtered with settings that mimicked the CARTO filter. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) to output a probabilistic estimation of RT and a measure of confidence, using the filtered synthetic UEs and their true RTs. Unfiltered ex-vivo human UEs were also filtered and the trained DNN used to estimate RT. Even a modest 2\u00a0Hz high-pass filter imposes a significant error on RT estimation using the Wyatt method. The DNN outperformed the Wyatt method in 62.75% of cases, and produced a significantly lower absolute error (p=8.99E-13), with a median of 16.91\u00a0ms, on 102 ex-vivo UEs. We also applied the DNN to patient UEs from CARTO, from which an RT map was computed. In conclusion, DNNs trained on synthetic UEs improve the RT estimation from filtered UEs, which leads to more reliable repolarization maps that help to identify patient-specific repolarization abnormalities.", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "date": "2021-05-22", "authors": ["PeterLangfield", "YingjingFeng", "Laura RBear", "JosselinDuchateau", "RafaelSebastian", "EmmaAbell", "RemiDubois", "LouisLabrousse", "JulienRogier", "MelezeHocini", "MichelHaissaguerre", "EdwardVigmond"], "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2021.102075"}

Previous studies suggest that NaF decreased cellular viability and intracellular antioxidant power.\nThe present study revealed that NaF administration caused histological alterations in the cardiac muscle and increased the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthases and proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as collagen deposition in cardiac tissue. As supported by colorimetric analysis, an elevation in malondialdehyde level and a decrease in both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and thioredoxin-1 oxidoreductase (TrX) levels were seen, whereas molecular analysis revealed a decrease in Keap1 and an increase in Nrf2 and HO-1 gene expression. Pretreatment with vitamin C and PRP prior to NaF administration significantly improved the altered parameters and enhanced the cellular antioxidant capability of myocardium resulting in protection of cardiac muscle from NaF-induced cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death.\nThe cyto-protective activity of PRP was found to be comparable to that of the known antioxidant, vitamin C.", "journal": "Folia morphologica", "date": "2021-05-22", "authors": ["HLabib", "A MBadr", "MAbdelgwad", "T IAbd El-Galil"], "doi": "10.5603/FM.a2021.0053"}

DMX-5804, a selective inhibitor of the stress-activated kinase MAP4K4, suppresses cell death in mouse myocardial infarction (MI), human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs), and 3D human engineered heart tissue, whose fidelity to human biology is hoped to strengthen the route to clinical success. Here, DMX-10001, a soluble, rapidly cleaved pro-drug of DMX-5804, was developed for i.v. testing in large-mammal MI. Following pharmacodynamic studies, a randomized, blinded efficacy study was performed in swine subjected to LAD balloon occlusion (60 min) and reperfusion (24 h). Thirty-six animals were enrolled; 12 were excluded by pre-defined criteria, death before infusion, or technical issues. DMX-10001 was begun 20 min before reperfusion (30 min, 60 mg/kg/h; 23.5 h, 17 mg/kg/h). At all times tested, beginning 30 min after the start of infusion, DMX-5804 concentrations exceeded\u2009>\u2009fivefold the levels that rescued hPSC-CMs and reduced IS in mice after oral dosing with DMX-5804 itself. No significant reduction occurred in IS or no-reflow corrected for the area at ischemic risk, even though DMX-10001 reduced IS, expressed in grams or % of LV mass, by 27%. In summary, a rapidly cleaved pro-drug of DMX-5804 failed to reduce IS in large-mammal MI, despite exceeding the concentrations for proven success in both mice and hPSC-CMs.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2021-05-22", "authors": ["MaaikeTe Lintel Hekkert", "GaryNewton", "KathrynChapman", "RehanAqil", "RobertDownham", "RobertYan", "DaphneMerkus", "GavinWhitlock", "Charlotte A LLane", "DarrenCawkill", "TrevorPerrior", "Dirk JDuncker", "Michael DSchneider"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-021-00875-7\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu331\n10.1007/s00395-018-0696-8\n10.1186/s12968-017-0370-6\n10.1161/circimaging.116.005146\n10.1056/NEJMoa1505489\n10.3791/53772\n10.1161/01.STR.32.3.767\n10.1152/ajpheart.1996.270.4.H1189\n10.1080/14017431.2016.1197417\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.01.013\n10.1016/s0140-6736(18)32203-7\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.06.005\n10.1038/s41536-020-0090-7\n10.1016/s0008-6363(03)00456-5\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.04.009\n10.1038/s41569-020-0403-y\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.02.016\n10.1161/circresaha.116.305462\n10.1177/1074248410362074\n10.1161/01.cir.102.16.1977\n10.1161/01.CIR.93.1.178\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313859\n10.1161/01.res.66.5.1294\n10.1152/ajpheart.00270.2002\n10.1136/bmj.319.7203.185\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.01.069\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313341\n10.1161/01.cir.102.25.3032\n10.1152/ajpheart.00447.2013\n10.1007/s00395-015-0508-3\n10.1038/s41598-017-18775-z\n10.1016/j.jcin.2015.08.033"}
{"title": "WNT5B in Physiology and Disease.", "abstract": "WNT5B, a member of the WNT family of proteins that is closely related to WNT5A, is required for cell migration, cell proliferation, or cell differentiation in many cell types. WNT5B signals through the non-canonical \u03b2-catenin-independent signaling pathway and often functions as an antagonist of canonical WNT signaling. Although WNT5B has a high amino acid identity with WNT5A and is often assumed to have similar activities, WNT5B often exhibits unique expression patterns and functions. Here, we describe the distinct effects and mechanisms of WNT5B on development, bone, adipose tissue, cardiac tissue, the nervous system, the mammary gland, the lung and hematopoietic cells, compared to WNT5A. We also highlight aberrances in non-canonical WNT5B signaling contributing to diseases such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neuropathology, and chronic diseases associated with aging, as well as various cancers.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2021-05-22", "authors": ["SarochaSuthon", "Rachel SPerkins", "VitezslavBryja", "Gustavo AMiranda-Carboni", "Susan AKrum"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2021.667581\n10.1210/endo.143.5.8776\n10.1016/j.neuron.2008.12.026\n10.1074/jbc.m117.786269\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aav5055\n10.1161/atvbaha.116.308394\n10.1016/j.gene.2018.07.061\n10.1038/35095500\n10.1242/dev.119065\n10.1242/jcs.03485\n10.3389/fcell.2021.631623\n10.1084/jem.20160675\n10.1093/carcin/bgt215\n10.1038/ni850\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.049\n10.1006/geno.1997.5041\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-11-1341\n10.1002/ajmg.a.20426\n10.3892/mmr.2015.4642\n10.1002/jcp.22499\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.01.033\n10.1093/neuonc/nou229\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0006\n10.1016/j.bone.2020.115258\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110946\n10.1002/jcp.24566\n10.1007/s00204-010-0591-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0130379\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000112\n10.1242/jcs.00152\n10.6026/97320630015246\n10.1016/s0169-328x(02)00397-2\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2019.109507\n10.1128/mcb.02354-05\n10.3389/fcell.2021.671218\n10.1016/0278-2391(95)90632-0\n10.1186/s12935-019-0743-z\n10.1016/j.gep.2014.11.002\n10.1038/onc.2009.175\n10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00645-x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025600\n10.1242/dev.02881\n10.1182/bloodadvances.2017006163\n10.1128/mcb.12.5.2418\n10.1101/gad.4.12b.2319\n10.1159/000491721\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210052\n10.1371/journal.pone.0215789\n10.1242/bio.034520\n10.1016/s0092-8674(01)00614-6\n10.1111/cas.13109\n10.1016/s0960-9822(99)80091-8\n10.1242/dev.025767\n10.1183/13993003.01541-2015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0084232\n10.1002/dvdy.10157\n10.1093/jb/mvw007\n10.3389/fcell.2018.00170\n10.1200/jco.2005.02.2871\n10.1089/scd.2019.0260\n10.1371/journal.pone.0181034\n10.1098/rsob.190273\n10.1002/jemt.1070280606\n10.1186/1471-2474-8-12\n10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-15-0154\n10.1002/pmic.201100102\n10.1002/jcb.28108\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.007\n10.1086/425340\n10.1038/npre.2009.2765.1\n10.1111/cas.12336\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1004423\n10.1073/pnas.1701464114\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00862\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.05.012\n10.1093/emboj/18.9.2401\n10.1074/jbc.275.17.12701\n10.1016/j.joca.2012.07.005\n10.3389/fonc.2019.01248\n10.4161/epi.20050\n10.1016/s0925-4773(01)00390-2\n10.1083/jcb.200912128\n10.1002/dvdy.10315\n10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000366\n10.1159/000430117\n10.1096/fj.11-198739\n10.3892/mmr.2012.772\n10.1073/pnas.0308648100\n10.1038/nm.2653\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01413.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0180711\n10.1016/j.neuint.2017.11.004\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.08.008\n10.3109/10428190903331082\n10.1002/jbmr.2872\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01165.x\n10.1038/nature14425\n10.1038/nrm3470\n10.1016/0092-8674(82)90409-3\n10.1038/tpj.2013.20\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.013\n10.1097/igc.0b013e31820aaadb\n10.1089/scd.2008.0291\n10.3892/or.2014.3229\n10.3390/ijms20174242\n10.1007/s11357-008-9069-9\n10.1016/0092-8674(87)90038-9\n10.1074/jbc.m114.561209\n10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v19.i4.50\n10.1242/dev.137000\n10.1242/dev.176073\n10.1016/j.numecd.2008.02.009\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.113\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.089\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1003274\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-09-1851\n10.1016/0012-1606(76)90108-1\n10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101541\n10.1016/j.mod.2015.10.001\n10.1006/dbio.1996.8463\n10.1091/mbc.4.12.1267\n10.1096/fj.201500129\n10.1242/dev.146589\n10.1038/tpj.2014.21\n10.1038/387292a0\n10.1016/j.devcel.2006.10.003\n10.3892/ijo.2013.2172\n10.1002/cbin.10862\n10.1007/s00432-017-2479-2\n10.7150/thno.17133\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.08.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151392\n10.1242/dev.033910\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.07.004\n10.3389/fendo.2019.00293\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010456\n10.1038/onc.2016.317\n10.1002/cbin.10936\n10.1016/s1499-3872(14)60277-0\n10.1016/s0092-8674(01)00298-7\n10.1016/j.gep.2008.12.009\n10.1128/mcb.14.9.6278\n10.1242/jcs.167403\n10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001738\n10.3390/cells8101147\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.06.061\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-124\n10.1242/dev.00324\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.138\n10.1167/iovs.07-0097\n10.1186/1476-4598-8-90\n10.12659/msm.902022\n10.1038/s41388-019-1071-4\n10.3892/or.2016.4772\n10.1016/j.prp.2019.152766\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-16-0842\n10.1007/s00198-015-3457-7\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-20-0458"}

South Texas has robust transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite causing Chagas disease in humans and various mammals. This parasite's impact in ocelots is unknown. Blood from live-trapped ocelots was collected by US Fish and Wildlife Service personnel in an annual monitoring program; additionally, tissues were obtained from carcasses collected from 2010 to 2017 around Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge in south Texas and placed in scientific collections. Variable samples were available from 21 ocelots: skeletal muscle (n=15), heart tissue (n=5), lung (n=1), kidney (n=1), spleen (n=1), liver (n=1), blood clot (n=9), and serum (n=3). Overall, 3/21 (14.3%) ocelots showed evidence of T. cruzi infection or exposure, with T. cruzi PCR-positive samples of skeletal muscle, heart, and blood clot, respectively. All three were infected with the T. cruzi discrete taxonomic unit \"TcI\"; one of these ocelots also had anti-T. cruzi antibodies. Lymphoplasmacytic inflammation was noted in the PCR-positive heart tissue and in some PCR-negative tissues from this and other individuals. Incidentally, Sarcocystis spp. were noted histologically in five ocelots.

Usually, ideal scaffold materials should possess properties similar to the extracellular matrix of natural myocardial tissue. In this study, dopamine-reduced graphene oxide (GO), was prepared and doped into gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels, resulting in novel conductive and mechanical properties for controlling cell growth. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) cultured on PDA-rGO-incorporated hydrogels (GelMA-PDA-rGO) had greater cytocompatibility than those cultured on GelMA hydrogels, as evidenced by higher cell survival rates and up-regulation of cardiac-relevant proteins. Finally, electrical stimulation was applied to facilitate the maturation of CMs which was seeded on different hydrogels. The findings revealed that electrical stimulation of conductive hybrid hydrogel scaffolds improved the orientational order parameter of sarcomeres (OOP). In addition, propagation of intercellular pacing signals, which improves the expression of gap junction proteins was noticed, likewise calcium handling capacity was present in conductive hybrid hydrogels compared to those in pure GelMA group.

Phosphorylation-dependent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) induces cardiac fibrosis. However, whether S-nitrosylation of JNK mediates cardiac fibrosis remains an open question. A biotin-switch assay confirmed that S-nitrosylation of JNK (SNO-JNK) increased significantly in the heart tissues of hypertrophic patients, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mice, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs) stimulated with angiotensin II (Ang II). Site to site substitution of alanine for cysteine in JNK was applied to determine the S-nitrosylated site. S-Nitrosylation occurred at both Cys116 and Cys163 and substitution of alanine for cysteine 116 and cysteine 163 (C116/163A) inhibited Ang II-induced myofibroblast transformation. We further confirmed that the source of S-nitrosylation was inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). 1400\u2009W, an inhibitor of iNOS, abrogated the profibrotic effects of Ang II in NRCFs. Mechanistically, SNO-JNK facilitated the nuclear translocation of JNK, increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun, and induced the transcriptional activity of AP-1 as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA.

Rapid upregulation of its expression in response to both physiological and pathological stress supports the involvement of ANKRD1 in muscle tissue adaptation and remodeling. However, the exact role of ANKRD1 remains poorly understood. To begin to investigate its function at higher resolution, we have generated and characterized a TgBAC(ankrd1a:EGFP) zebrafish line. This reporter line displays transgene expression in slow skeletal muscle fibers during development and exercise responsiveness in adult cardiac muscle. To better understand the role of Ankrd1a in pathological conditions in adult zebrafish, we assessed ankrd1a expression after cardiac ventricle cryoinjury and observed localized upregulation in cardiomyocytes in the border zone. We show that this expression in injured hearts is recapitulated by the TgBAC(ankrd1a:EGFP) reporter. Our results identify novel expression domains of ankrd1a and suggest an important role for Ankrd1a in the early stress response and regeneration of cardiac tissue.

Here, the key concepts of cardiac development that are successfully applied in a bioinspired approach to growing engineered cardiac tissues, are reviewed. The native cardiac milieu is studied extensively from embryonic to adult phenotypes, as it provides a resource of factors, mechanisms, and protocols to consider when working toward establishing living tissues in vitro. It begins with the various cell types that constitute the cardiac tissue. It is discussed how myocytes interact with other cell types and their microenvironment and how they change over time from the embryonic to the adult states, with a view on how such changes affect the tissue function and may be used in engineered tissue models. Key embryonic signaling pathways that have been leveraged in the design of culture media and differentiation protocols are presented. The cellular microenvironment, from extracellular matrix chemical and physical properties, to the dynamic mechanical and electrical forces that are exerted on tissues is explored. It is shown that how such microenvironmental factors can inform the design of biomaterials, scaffolds, stimulation bioreactors, and maturation readouts, and suggest considerations for ongoing biomimetic advancement of engineered cardiac tissues and regeneration strategies for the future.", "journal": "Advanced biology", "date": "2021-05-20", "authors": ["NaimehRafatian", "KatrinaVizely", "HadelAl Asafen", "AnastasiaKorolj", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1002/adbi.202000190"}

A whole organ or tissue decellularized matrix contains extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and exhibits ultrastructural and mechanical properties, which could significantly regulate the fate of stem cells. To better understand the memory function of whole organ decellularized matrices, we constructed a heart decellularized matrix and seeded cross-embryonic layer stem cells - neural stem cells (NSCs) to repopulate the matrix, engineering cardiac tissue, in which a large number of NSCs differentiated into the neural lineage, but besides that, NSCs showed an obvious tendency of trans-differentiating into cardiac lineage cells. The results demonstrated that the whole heart decellularized microenvironment possesses memory function. To reveal the underlying mechanism, TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis was used to identify the differently expressed proteins in the whole heart decellularized matrix compared with a brain decellularized matrix. 937 of the proteins changed over 1.5 fold, with 573 of the proteins downregulated and 374 of the proteins upregulated, among which integrin ligands in the ECM serve as key signals in regulating NSC fate.

Knowledge of gene expression of single cells within cardiac tissue has contributed to the understanding of how each cell type contributes to the anatomic structures of the heart. In this review, we summarize how single cell RNA sequencing has been utilized to understand cardiac developmental processes and congenital heart disease. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of whole cell versus single nuclei RNA sequencing and describe the approaches to analyze the interactomes, transcriptomes, and differentiation trajectory from single cell data. We summarize the currently available single cell RNA sequencing technologies and technical aspects of performing single cell analysis and how to overcome common obstacles. We also review data from the recently published human and mouse fetal heart atlases and advancements that have occurred within the field due to the application of these single cell tools. Finally we highlight the potential for single cell technologies to uncover novel mechanisms of disease pathogenesis by leveraging findings from genome wide association studies.", "journal": "Seminars in cell & developmental biology", "date": "2021-05-20", "authors": ["TahminaSamad", "Sean MWu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.04.023\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05810\n10.1038/s12276-020-00499-2\n10.1038/ng0697-154\n10.1038/s41586-019-1414-x\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.01.001\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.04.005\n10.1038/s41467-020-16204-w\n10.1042/BST20191255\n10.3390/cells9081751\n10.1038/nbt.3192\n10.1038/nmeth.2563\n10.1161/JAHA.120.016528"}

One way to eliminate them is by stimulating the excitable medium with a period smaller than the period of the vortex. So far, this phenomenon has been studied mostly for two-dimensional vortices known as spiral waves. Here we present a first study of this phenomenon for three-dimensional vortices, or scroll waves, in a slab. We consider two main types of scroll waves dynamics: with positive filament tension and with negative filament tension and show that such elimination is possible for some values of the period in all cases. However, in the case of negative filament tension for relatively long stimulation periods, three-dimensional instabilities occur and make elimination impossible. We derive equations of motion for the drift of paced filaments and identify a bifurcation parameter that determines whether the filaments orient themselves perpendicular to the impeding wave train or not.", "journal": "Physical review.

Early detection and prevention of remote intestinal injury following myocardial IR may help to estimate and improve prognosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study investigated the protective effect of myocardial ischemic postconditioning (IPo) on intestinal barrier injury induced by myocardial IR and the underlying cellular signaling mechanisms with a focus on the DJ-1. Adult SD rats were subjected to unilateral myocardial IR with or without ischemic postconditioning. After 30 min of ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion, heart tissue, intestine, and blood were collected for subsequent examination. The outcome measures were (i) intestinal histopathology, (ii) intestinal barrier function and inflammatory responses, (iii) apoptosis and oxidative stress, and (iv) cellular signaling changes. IPo significantly attenuated intestinal injury induced by myocardial IR. Furthermore, IPo significantly increased DJ-1, nuclear Nrf2, NQO1, and HO-1 expression in the intestine and inhibited IR-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. The protective effect of IPo was abolished by the knockdown of DJ-1. Conversely, the overexpression of DJ-1 provided a protective effect similar to that of IPo.

{"title": "Evidence for synergy between sarcomeres and fibroblasts in an in vitro model of myocardial reverse remodeling.", "abstract": "We have created a novel in-vitro platform to study reverse remodeling of engineered heart tissue (EHT) after mechanical unloading. EHTs were created by seeding decellularized porcine myocardial sections with a mixture of primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. Each end of the ribbon-like constructs was fixed to a plastic clip, allowing the tissues to be statically stretched or slackened. Inelastic deformation was introduced by stretching tissues by 20% of their original length. EHTs were subsequently unloaded by returning tissues to their original, shorter length. Mechanical characterization of EHTs immediately after unloading and at subsequent time points confirmed the presence of a reverse-remodeling process, through which stress-free tissue length was increased after chronic stretch but gradually decreased back to its original value within 9 days. When a cardiac myosin inhibitor was applied to tissues after unloading, EHTs failed to completely recover their passive and active mechanical properties, suggesting a role for actomyosin contraction in reverse remodeling. Selectively inhibiting cardiomyocyte contraction or fibroblast activity after mechanical unloading showed that contractile activity of both cell types was required to achieve full remodeling. Similar tests with EHTs formed from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes also showed reverse remodeling that was enhanced when treated with omecamtiv mecarbil, a myosin activator.

Currently, depending on only physical examination of corpses, pathologists must be cautious when making cause-of-death appraisals. In a previous study, four biomarkers-dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 2 (KCNJ2), miR-122, and miR-3185-were screened in human cardiac tissue from cadavers that died from mechanical asphyxia compared with those that died from craniocerebral injury, hemorrhagic shock, or other causes. Expression of the markers correlated with death from mechanical asphyxia regardless of age, environmental temperature, and postmortem interval. However, a single biological index is not an accurate basis for the identification of the cause of death. In this study, receiver operating characteristic curves of the \u0394Cq values of the four indexes were generated. The diagnostic accuracy of the indexes was judged according to their area under the curve (DUSP1: 0.773, KCNJ2: 0.775, miR-122: 0.667, and miR-3185: 0.801).

In this study we applied this methodology to accomplish Multiview imaging with multiphoton microscopy based on fluorescence and additionally second harmonic signal from myosin and collagen. It was shown that isotropic resolution was achieved, the entirety of the sample was visualized, and interference artifacts were suppressed allowing clear visualization of collagen fibrils and myofibrils. This method can be applied to any scanning microscopy technique without microscope modifications.

However, due to the continual dynamic motion of cardiac tissue, the hydrogel structure cannot be reconstructed in time, causing accelerated degradation and drug burst release. Here, a novel, superior, self-healing elastin-mimic peptide hydrogel (EMH) was fabricated for the local delivery of salvianolic acid B (SaB). The self-healing ability of EMH is enhanced by SaB-loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (SaB-PDA). In vitro, the pre-hydrogel (SaB-PDA/pre-EMH) is endowed with excellent biocompatibility and a low viscosity, making it suitable for intramyocardial injection. Once injected into the myocardial infarction (MI) region, SaB-PDA/pre-EMH can form SaB-PDA/EMH with great mechanical strength under the action of upregulated transglutaminase (TGase) in heart tissue post-MI. The superior self-healing ability of SaB-PDA/EMH allows for an increase in retention time in the beating ventricular wall.

Crocin is the active constituent of Crocus sativus (saffron) which has antioxidant properties and is protective against cardiovascular disturbances.\nThe present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of crocin on periodontitis-induced oxidative/inflammatory cardiac degeneration in rats in vivo.\nThirty female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group, periodontitis group (PD) and periodonditis plus crocin group (PD+Cr). Experimental periodontitis was induced by placing silk ligatures on the maxillary second molar teeth for 30 days. Afterward, crocin (100 mg/kg body weight/day) was administered to the PD+Cr group and saline was administered to the PD group and the control group for 15 days. The subjects were sacrificed on the 45th day.\nHistological and biochemical analyses demonstrated that inducing periodontitis caused obvious damage to cardiac tissues which was significantly ameliorated by crocin (p < 0.05). Significant improvements in bone resorption parameters (cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen and bone alkaline phosphatase) were also observed in the PD+Cr group (p < 0.05). In addition, crocin caused significant reductions of malondialdehyde levels and total oxidant score while antioxidant levels (glutathione, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant score, and catalase) were significantly higher in PD+Cr group (p < 0.05).\nThis study reveals that periodontitis may cause oxidative damage in cardiac tissue and crocin improves periodontitis-induced degenerative changes in heart tissue, which is associated with its antioxidant properties.", "journal": "Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University", "date": "2021-05-12", "authors": ["GulhanKocaman", "EyupAltinoz", "Mehmet ErmanErdemli", "MehmetGul", "ZeynepErdemli", "EmrahZayman", "Harika Gozde GozukaraBag", "TugbaAyd\u0131n"], "doi": "10.17219/acem/133753"}

This study, for the first time, aimed to investigate how bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing as well as the proteomics analysis of the human heart tissue can be integrated to uncover HF-specific networks and potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers. We also aimed to address the issue of dealing with a limited number of samples and to show how appropriate statistical models, enrichment with other datasets as well as machine learning-guided analysis can aid in such cases. Furthermore, we elucidated specific gene expression profiles using transcriptomic and mined data from public databases. This was achieved using the two-step machine learning algorithm to predict the likelihood of the therapeutic target or biomarker tractability based on a novel scoring system, which has also been introduced in this study. The described methodology could be very useful for the target or biomarker selection and evaluation during the pre-clinical therapeutics development stage as well as disease progression monitoring. In addition, the present study sheds new light into the complex aetiology of HF, differentiating between subtle changes in dilated cardiomyopathies (DCs) and ischemic cardiomyopathies (ICs) on the single cell, proteome and whole transcriptome level, demonstrating that HF might be dependent on the involvement of not only the cardiomyocytes but also on other cell populations.

{"title": "The role of PP5 and PP2C in cardiac health and disease.", "abstract": "Protein phosphatases are important, for example, as functional antagonists of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation of the mammalian heart. While \u03b2-adrenergic stimulations increase the phosphorylation state of regulatory proteins and therefore force of contraction in the heart, these phosphorylations are reversed and thus force is reduced by the activity of protein phosphatases. In this context the role of PP5 and PP2C is starting to unravel. They do not belong to the same family of phosphatases with regard to sequence homology, many similarities with regard to location, activation by lipids and putative substrates have been worked out over the years. We also suggest which pathways for regulation of PP5 and/or PP2C described in other tissues and not yet in the heart might be useful to look for in cardiac tissue. Both phosphatases might play a role in signal transduction of sarcolemmal receptors in the heart. Expression of PP5 and PP2C can be increased by extracellular stimuli in the heart. Because PP5 is overexpressed in failing animal and human hearts, and because overexpression of PP5 or PP2C leads to cardiac hypertrophy and KO of PP5 leads to cardiac hypotrophy, one might argue for a role of PP5 and PP2C in heart failure. Because PP5 and PP2C can reduce, at least in vitro, the phosphorylation state of proteins thought to be relevant for cardiac arrhythmias, a role of these phosphatases for cardiac arrhythmias is also probable. Thus, PP5 and PP2C might be druggable targets to treat important cardiac diseases like heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac arrhythmias.", "journal": "Cellular signalling", "date": "2021-05-09", "authors": ["JoachimNeumann", "PeterBoknik", "UweKirchhefer", "UlrichGergs"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2021.110035"}

Transplanting mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have exhibited potential role in myocardial regeneration. Secretion of immune-modulatory cytokines and various growth factors after transplantation plays significant role in remodelling process of MI region.

Myocardial regeneration demands for accurate spatio-temporal delivery of MSCs with supportive vascular network that leads to improvement of cardiac function. In this study, injectable alginate based microporous hydrogel has been used to deliver 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) in zein protein nanoparticle with MSCs for attenuating adverse cardiac remodelling after MI. Zein nanoparticles loaded with 5-Aza were prepared by liquid-liquid dispersion, and it was found that 35% of drug was released in 7\u00a0days supported with mathematical modelling. The presence of 5-Aza and zein in developed hydrogel supported in vitro MSC proliferation, migration and angiogenesis.

The mechanisms of direct SARS-CoV-2 cardiomyocyte infection include viral invasion via ACE2-Spike glycoprotein-binding. In DM patients, the impact of glycation of ACE2 on cardiomyocyte invasion by SARS-CoV-2 can be of high importance.\nTo evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes from heart autopsy of DM cases compared to Non-DM; to investigate the role of DM in SARS-COV-2 entry in cardiomyocytes.\nWe evaluated consecutive autopsy cases, deceased for COVID-19, from Italy between Apr 30, 2020 and Jan 18, 2021. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes, expression of ACE2 (total and glycosylated form), and transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2) protein. In order to study the role of diabetes on cardiomyocyte alterations, independently of COVID-19, we investigated ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 proteins in cardiomyocytes from DM and Non-DM explanted-hearts. Finally, to investigate the effects of DM on ACE2 protein modification, an in vitro glycation study of recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2) was performed to evaluate the effects on binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The authors included cardiac tissue from 97 autopsies. DM was diagnosed in 37 patients (38%). Fourth-seven out of 97 autopsies (48%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes.

Their clinical symptoms can vary from absent to non-specific. The most common symptoms are arrhythmias, blood flow obstruction due to valvular dysfunction, shortness of breath, systemic embolization, and accumulation of pericardial fluid. Hereby, we describe a very rare case of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma patient who presented with the symptoms and signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but the patient's complaints were caused by his intramyocardial lymphoma metastasis.\nForty-eight-year-old diffuse large B cell lymphoma patient was admitted to our emergency department with chest pain, effort dyspnea, and fever. The patient had normal blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, sinus tachycardia, fever, crackles over the left lower lobe, novum incomplete right bundle branch block with Q waves and minor ST alterations, elevated C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin-T, and d-dimer levels. Chest X-ray revealed consolidation on the left side and enlarged heart. Bed side transthoracic echocardiography showed inferior akinesis with pericardial fluid. Coronary angiography showed no occlusion or significant stenosis. Chest computed tomography demonstrated the progression of his lymphoma in the myocardium. He was admitted to the Department of Hematology for immediate chemotherapy and he reached complete metabolic remission, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Unfortunately, about 9 months later, he developed bone marrow deficiency consequently severe sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ failure what he did not survive.\nOur case demonstrates a very rare manifestation of a heart metastasis. ACS is an unusual symptom of cardiac tumors. But our patient's intramyocardial lymphoma in the right atrium and ventricle externally compressed the right coronary artery and damaged the heart tissue, causing the patient's symptoms which imitated ACS.

{"title": "Direct laser writing for cardiac tissue engineering: a microfluidic heart on a chip with integrated transducers.", "abstract": "We have developed a microfluidic platform for engineering cardiac microtissues in highly-controlled microenvironments. The platform is fabricated using direct laser writing (DLW) lithography and soft lithography, and contains four separate devices. Each individual device houses a cardiac microtissue and is equipped with an integrated strain actuator and a force sensor. Application of external pressure waves to the platform results in controllable time-dependent forces on the microtissues. Conversely, oscillatory forces generated by the microtissues are transduced into measurable electrical outputs. We demonstrate the capabilities of this platform by studying the response of cardiac microtissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) under prescribed mechanical loading and pacing.

{"title": "Computational modeling identifies embolic stroke of undetermined source patients with potential arrhythmic substrate.", "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed fibrosis in embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) patients comparable to levels seen in atrial fibrillation (AFib). We used computational modeling to understand the absence of arrhythmia in ESUS despite the presence of putatively pro-arrhythmic fibrosis. MRI-based atrial models were reconstructed for 45 ESUS and 45 AFib patients. The fibrotic substrate's arrhythmogenic capacity in each patient was assessed computationally. Reentrant drivers were induced in 24/45 (53%) ESUS and 22/45 (49%) AFib models. Inducible models had more fibrosis (16.7 \u00b1 5.45%) than non-inducible models (11.07 \u00b1 3.61%; p<0.0001); however, inducible subsets of ESUS and AFib models had similar fibrosis levels (p=0.90), meaning that the \nThe heart usually beats with a regular rhythm to pump the blood that carries oxygen and nutrients to different organs. Sometimes, alterations in the heart\u2019s rhythm known as arrhythmias can occur. Atrial fibrillation, also called AFib, is a type of arrhythmia in which the heart beats rapidly and irregularly, causing abnormal blood-flow that can lead to the formation of blood clots. If one of these blood clots travels to the brain, it can block a blood vessel, causing a stroke. However, many strokes occur without any evidence of AFib. One subset of strokes that are not associated with AFib are embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS), which account for 25% of all strokes. By definition ESUS and AFib do not occur together, but both are associated with similar elevated levels of disease-related remodeling (i.e., fibrosis) in the heart tissue, which appears when the heart is injured. Fibrosis impairs the heart\u2019s normal electrical activity. Bifulco et al. wanted to determine whether there is some fundamental difference in fibrosis between people with AFib and those who have had an ESUS event. To do this, they used a computational approach to model the geometries and patterns of fibrosis of the hearts of 45 ESUS patients and 45 patients with AFib, essentially producing a virtual version of each patient\u2019s heart. Bifulco et al. then applied a virtual pace-maker (working in overdrive mode) to each heart model to determine whether electrical inputs that can lead to AFib had different effects on ESUS and AFib patients. The results showed that the electrical inputs had similar effects in all of the heart models. This led Bifulco et al. to conclude that ESUS and AFib patients have indistinguishable patterns of fibrosis. The key difference is that ESUS patients are missing the trigger to initiate the fibrillation process \u2013 if atrial fibrosis is the proverbial tinderbox, these triggers are the spark needed to ignite a fire. Further research, including confirmation of Bifulco et al.\u2019s findings in live patients, will be needed to confirm the hypothesis that ESUS patients lack AFib primarily due to an absence of triggers. If this is indeed the case, these findings may make it easier to identify ESUS patients at higher risk for AFib or further strokes.

Design prerequisites include a structure thickness sufficient to produce a beneficial contractile force, prevascularization to overcome diffusion limitations and sufficient structural development to allow for maximal cell communication. Previous attempts to meet these prerequisites have been hindered by lack of oxygen and nutrient transport due to diffusion limits (100-200 \u03bcm) resulting in necrosis.

Whether the presence of B19V DNA correlates with active infection is still debated. Application of the enzyme endonuclease to blood samples results in degradation of B19V DNA remnants but leaves viral particles intact, which enables differentiation between active and past infection. In this study, the susceptibility to degradation by endonuclease of B19V DNA in blood was compared between DCM patients and a control group of recent B19V infections.\nTwenty blood samples from 20 adult patients with DCM, who previously tested positive for B19V DNA in EMB and/or blood, were tested with B19V PCR before and after application of endonuclease to the samples.

In contrast, B19V DNA in blood in patients with DCM became undetectable or strongly reduced after application of endonuclease.

Long noncoding RNAs have been reported to be associated with the development of MI. In this article, we aimed to explore the effects of long noncoding RNA small nuclear RNA host gene 7 (SNHG7) on MI and the possible mechanism. In this study, an MI model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery of mice. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) derived from neonatal mice were activated by angiotensin II (Ang-II) treatment. The expression of SNHG7 and miR-455-3p was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and protein levels of platelet-activating factor receptor (PTAFR) and fibrosis-related proteins were analyzed by western blot assay. Cell apoptosis of CFs was monitored by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to evaluate inflammatory responses in CFs. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the target relationship between miR-455-3p and SNHG7 or PTAFR. LncRNA SNHG7 and PTAFR were upregulated, whereas miR-455-3p was downregulated in cardiac tissues of mice with MI and Ang-II-induced CFs.

The loss of arginine at position 14 in PLN (R14del) is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy with a high prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias. How the R14 deletion causes dilated cardiomyopathy is poorly understood, and there are no disease-specific therapies.\nWe used single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover PLN R14del disease mechanisms in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). We used both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional functional contractility assays to evaluate the impact of modulating disease-relevant pathways in PLN R14del hiPSC-CMs.\nModeling of the PLN R14del cardiomyopathy with isogenic pairs of hiPSC-CMs recapitulated the contractile deficit associated with the disease in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in PLN R14del compared with isogenic control hiPSC-CMs. The activation of UPR was also evident in the hearts from PLN R14del patients. Silencing of each of the 3 main UPR signaling branches (IRE1, ATF6, or PERK) by siRNA exacerbated the contractile dysfunction of PLN R14del hiPSC-CMs. We explored the therapeutic potential of activating the UPR with a small molecule activator, BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein) inducer X. PLN R14del hiPSC-CMs treated with BiP protein inducer X showed a dose-dependent amelioration of the contractility deficit in both 2-dimensional cultures and 3-dimensional engineered heart tissues without affecting calcium homeostasis.\nTogether, these findings suggest that the UPR exerts a protective effect in the setting of PLN R14del cardiomyopathy and that modulation of the UPR might be exploited therapeutically.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["Dries A MFeyen", "IsaacPerea-Gil", "Renee G CMaas", "MagdalenaHarakalova", "Alexandra AGavidia", "JenniferArthur Ataam", "Ting-HsuanWu", "AryanVink", "JiayiPei", "NirmalVadgama", "Albert JSuurmeijer", "Wouter PTe Rijdt", "MichelleVu", "Prashila LAmatya", "MaricelaPrado", "YuanZhang", "LoganDunkenberger", "Joost P GSluijter", "KarimSallam", "Folkert WAsselbergs", "MarkMercola", "IoannisKarakikes"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.049844"}

{"title": "Circular RNAs and Cardiovascular Regeneration.", "abstract": "circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNAs that are widely present in eukaryotic cells. They have the characteristics of stable structure, high abundance, and cell or tissue specific expression. circRNAs are single-stranded RNAs that are covalently back spliced to form closed circular loops. They may participate in gene expression and regulation through a variety of action modes. circRNAs can encode proteins or function by acting as miRNA sponges for protein translation. Since 2016, a growing number of research studies have shown that circRNAs play important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. With the construction of circRNA database, the differential expression of circRNAs in the heart tissue samples from different species and the gradual elucidation of its mode of action in disease may become an ideal diagnosis biomarker and an effective therapeutic target. What can be expected surely has a broader application prospect.

{"title": "OptoGap is an optogenetics-enabled assay for quantification of cell-cell coupling in multicellular cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Intercellular electrical coupling is an essential means of communication between cells. It is important to obtain quantitative knowledge of such coupling between cardiomyocytes and non-excitable cells when, for example, pathological electrical coupling between myofibroblasts and cardiomyocytes yields increased arrhythmia risk or during the integration of donor (e.g., cardiac progenitor) cells with native cardiomyocytes in cell-therapy approaches. Currently, there is no direct method for assessing heterocellular coupling within multicellular tissue. Here we demonstrate experimentally and computationally a new contactless assay for electrical coupling, OptoGap, based on selective illumination of inexcitable cells that express optogenetic actuators and optical sensing of the response of coupled excitable cells (e.g., cardiomyocytes) that are light-insensitive. Cell-cell coupling is quantified by the energy required to elicit an action potential via junctional current from the light-stimulated cell(s). The proposed technique is experimentally validated against the standard indirect approach, GapFRAP, using light-sensitive cardiac fibroblasts and non-transformed cardiomyocytes in a two-dimensional setting. Its potential applicability to the complex three-dimensional setting of the native heart is corroborated by computational modelling and proper calibration. Lastly, the sensitivity of OptoGap to intrinsic cell-scale excitability is robustly characterized via computational analysis.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["Patrick MBoyle", "JinzhuYu", "AleksandraKlimas", "John CWilliams", "Natalia ATrayanova", "EmiliaEntcheva"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-88573-1\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.09.011\n10.1038/nature06321\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.160549\n10.1016/j.carpath.2009.12.002\n10.1161/01.RES.0000089258.40661.0C\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227421\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1152/ajpcell.1999.276.4.C980\n10.1152/ajpcell.1992.263.5.C959\n10.2144/000112810\n10.1126/science.1246629\n10.1038/nmeth730\n10.1016/j.ceb.2010.03.002\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.01.041\n10.1002/glia.440030405\n10.7554/eLife.43366\n10.1101/171397\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131446\n10.1038/nphys3619\n10.1073/pnas.1611184114\n10.1529/biophysj.106.101410\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.058719\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.964247\n10.1113/JP271559\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002271\n10.1007/978-1-4939-3512-3_21\n10.1038/srep17350\n10.1080/15419060802198736\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.02.034\n10.1016/S0006-3495(76)85755-4\n10.1126/science.3961495\n10.1007/s002210050304\n10.1007/BF00374970\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003220\n10.1038/ncomms11542\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3002588\n10.1038/ncomms3370\n10.1038/s41569-020-00478-0\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2019.02.004\n10.1016/j.bcp.2008.08.022\n10.1111/j.1742-7843.2007.00123.x\n10.1210/en.2004-1414\n10.1161/01.RES.0000214537.44195.a3\n10.1093/cvr/cvx163\n10.1529/biophysj.108.136473\n10.1038/s41598-021-83398-4\n10.1161/01.RES.0000122382.19400.14\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.957647\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.015057\n10.1117/1.JBO.19.8.080701\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2014.07.001\n10.1038/nn.3502\n10.1038/nmeth.2836\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1047-2_19\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.255026\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.04.036\n10.1007/s10439-013-0833-3\n10.1038/s41598-019-45684-0\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.07.012\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2003.09.017\n10.1161/01.RES.0000174429.00987.17\n10.1529/biophysj.107.110981\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.229088\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00282\n10.1172/JCI88950\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00414\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01151\n10.1038/s41551-019-0437-9"}

{"title": "Presence of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein in Cardiac Tissues of Donors with Negative COVID-19 Molecular Tests.", "abstract": "The 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak had detrimental effects on essential medical services such as organ and tissue donation. Lombardy, one of the most active Italian regions in organ/tissue procurement, has been strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, data concerning the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after tissue transplantation are controversial. Here, we aimed to evaluate the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 in different cardiac tissues eligible for transplantation obtained from Lombard donors. We used cardiovascular tissues from eight donors potentially suitable for pulmonary valve transplantation. All donor subjects involved in the study returned negative results for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecular tests (quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR, qRT-PCR, and chip-based digital PCR) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). None of the eight donors included in this study revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. However, evaluation of the protein content of pulmonary vein wall (PVW) tissue revealed variable levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein signal in all donors.

{"title": "Targeting Ferroptosis against Ischemia/Reperfusion Cardiac Injury.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Primarily, ischemia causes decreased oxygen supply, resulting in damage of the cardiac tissue. Naturally, reoxygenation has been recognized as the treatment of choice to recover blood flow through primary percutaneous coronary intervention. This treatment is the gold standard therapy to restore blood flow, but paradoxically it can also induce tissue injury. A number of different studies in animal models of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) suggest that ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) accounts for up to 50% of the final myocardial infarct size. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathological process. Iron is an essential mineral required for a variety of vital biological functions but also has potentially toxic effects. A detrimental process induced by free iron is ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic type of programmed cell death. Accordingly, efforts to prevent ferroptosis in pathological settings have focused on the use of radical trapping antioxidants (RTAs), such as liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1). Hence, it is necessary to develop novel strategies to prevent cardiac IRI, thus improving the clinical outcome in patients with ischemic heart disease. The present review analyses the role of ferroptosis inhibition to prevent heart IRI, with special reference to Lip-1 as a promising drug in this clinicopathological context.", "journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9Lillo-Moya", "CatalinaRojas-Sol\u00e9", "DiegoMu\u00f1oz-Salamanca", "EmilianoPanieri", "LucianoSaso", "Ram\u00f3nRodrigo"], "doi": "10.3390/antiox10050667\n10.1016/S0300-8932(09)70162-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61237-4\n10.1016/j.recesp.2014.01.011\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.06.010\n10.1172/JCI126428\n10.1073/pnas.1821022116\n10.1038/hr.2010.264\n10.1111/j.1472-8206.2006.00466.x\n10.1161/01.ATV.20.7.1716\n10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.001\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.04.001\n10.1074/jbc.M113.545301\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.08.020\n10.1038/nrm2256\n10.3390/ijms21217889\n10.1042/CS20110663\n10.1155/2013/437613\n10.1177/039463200501800308\n10.2174/092986707780831078\n10.1007/s11010-012-1458-9\n10.1007/s12012-008-9016-0\n10.1016/S0021-9258(17)42488-4\n10.1161/01.RES.55.6.816\n10.1161/01.cir.75.1.282\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01693-5\n10.1002/mus.20512\n10.3164/jcbn.40.1\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)50676-7\n10.1073/pnas.84.5.1404\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.11.004\n10.1152/ajpcell.00211.2007\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.09.007\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.6.H2649\n10.1042/bj3620733\n10.1152/ajpheart.1987.253.3.H709\n10.1016/0005-2744(69)90327-1\n10.1152/ajpheart.00683.2005\n10.1093/cvr/cvv097\n10.1042/bj3070093\n10.1016/S0022-2828(03)00043-9\n10.1152/ajpheart.1997.272.5.H2071\n10.1152/ajpheart.00159.2006\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.01.016\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00095\n10.1042/BST20110773\n10.1515/bmc-2020-0014\n10.1002/jcp.28820\n10.1007/s10741-018-9700-5\n10.3945/ajcn.117.155804\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.08.009\n10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01779.x\n10.1007/s00109-005-0029-x\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.115.004148\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.116.004940\n10.1172/JCI44490\n10.1023/A:1015923202082\n10.1073/pnas.90.3.1102\n10.1155/2017/3647657\n10.2174/0929867033457322\n10.1096/fj.03-0128fje\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.05.003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316509\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.06.041\n10.1038/ncb3064\n10.1038/s41556-020-0461-8\n10.1021/cr200084z\n10.1021/cr200246d\n10.1038/nchembio.2238\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.044\n10.1002/anie.202102001\n10.1007/s00018-016-2194-1\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042\n10.1038/nature05859\n10.1152/ajpheart.00452.2017\n10.2174/1389450119666180605112235\n10.1016/j.apsb.2020.07.003\n10.1038/cdd.2015.158\n10.1016/j.tips.2017.02.005\n10.1152/ajpheart.00237.2020\n10.2741/3921\n10.1186/s10020-021-00271-w\n10.1155/2015/864946\n10.1038/nrg2523\n10.1152/physrev.00041.2016\n10.1242/jcs.093575\n10.1038/s41418-018-0173-9\n10.1038/nri3743\n10.1016/j.cmet.2008.07.005\n10.1073/pnas.1415518111\n10.1007/s11357-016-9933-y\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.12.008\n10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105466\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2019.151058\n10.1016/j.molcel.2018.10.042\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.03.045\n10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.011\n10.1073/pnas.82.14.4668\n10.1089/ars.2009.2695\n10.3389/fphar.2014.00151\n10.1038/nnano.2016.164\n10.1038/s41556-020-0565-1\n10.1016/j.trecan.2019.07.008\n10.1007/s00210-020-01932-z\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.006\n10.15252/emmm.201505748\n10.1053/j.gastro.2015.03.041\n10.1038/s41418-019-0299-4\n10.1097/HCO.0000000000000447\n10.1021/ja00411a035\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.314944\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101292\n10.1371/journal.pone.0137405\n10.3390/nu11102412\n10.4137/NMI.S39764\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110970\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000482\n10.1177/1535370216649263\n10.1159/000487490\n10.1080/10715762.2018.1468564\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-011112-140320\n10.1016/j.tips.2013.04.005\n10.1152/ajpheart.00241.2012\n10.1152/ajpheart.00008.2015\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.10.001\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.905471\n10.1007/s12035-018-0899-x\n10.1080/15376516.2017.1422578\n10.3390/ijms20194968\n10.1021/acschembio.7b00730\n10.4103/1673-5374.293157\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2018.12.007\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.04.004\n10.1074/jbc.M202285200\n10.1038/s41586-019-1707-0\n10.1097/TA.0b013e31816c5ca6\n10.1016/j.bmc.2006.01.057\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.052\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109102\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000003555\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00638\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.10.001\n10.1021/ja053679l\n10.1021/acscentsci.6b00199\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.10.009\n10.1089/ars.2016.6635\n10.3390/cancers12010164\n10.1080/23723556.2015.1054549"}

Here, we report a critically ill case of a 13-year-old female patient with acute pericarditis and bilateral pleurisy, screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, presented with high fever, frequent dry cough, and dyspnea with tachypnea. COVID-19-induced myopericarditis has been noted to be a complication in patients with concomitant kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT). This article brings information in the light of our case experience, suggesting that the direct effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on cardiac tissue was a significant contributor to myopericarditis in our patient.

{"title": "Assembly of the Cardiac Pacemaking Complex: Electrogenic Principles of Sinoatrial Node Morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Cardiac pacemaker cells located in the sinoatrial node initiate the electrical impulses that drive rhythmic contraction of the heart. The sinoatrial node accounts for only a small proportion of the total mass of the heart yet must produce a stimulus of sufficient strength to stimulate the entire volume of downstream cardiac tissue. This requires balancing a delicate set of electrical interactions both within the sinoatrial node and with the downstream working myocardium. Understanding the fundamental features of these interactions is critical for defining vulnerabilities that arise in human arrhythmic disease and may provide insight towards the design and implementation of the next generation of potential cellular-based cardiac therapeutics. Here, we discuss physiological conditions that influence electrical impulse generation and propagation in the sinoatrial node and describe developmental events that construct the tissue-level

{"title": "Recapitulating Cardiac Structure and Function In Vitro from Simple to Complex Engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering aims to generate in vivo-like functional tissue for the study of cardiac development, homeostasis, and regeneration. Since the heart is composed of various types of cells and extracellular matrix with a specific microenvironment, the fabrication of cardiac tissue in vitro requires integrating technologies of cardiac cells, biomaterials, fabrication, and computational modeling to model the complexity of heart tissue. Here, we review the recent progress of engineering techniques from simple to complex for fabricating matured cardiac tissue in vitro. Advancements in cardiomyocytes, extracellular matrix, geometry, and computational modeling will be discussed based on a technology perspective and their use for preparation of functional cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Rapid fall in circulating non-classical monocytes in ST elevation myocardial infarction patients correlates with cardiac injury.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction leads to a rapid innate immune response that is ultimately required for repair of damaged heart tissue. We therefore examined circulating monocyte dynamics immediately after reperfusion of the culprit coronary vessel in STEMI patients to determine whether this correlated with level of cardiac injury. A mouse model of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury was subsequently used to establish the degree of monocyte margination to the coronary vasculature that could potentially contribute to the drop in circulating monocytes. We retrospectively analyzed blood samples from 51 STEMI patients to assess the number of non-classical (NC), classical, and intermediate monocytes immediately following primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Classical and intermediate monocytes showed minimal change. On the other hand, circulating numbers of NC monocytes fell by approximately 50% at 90 minutes post-reperfusion. This rapid decrease in NC monocytes was greatest in patients with the largest infarct size (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and correlated inversely with left ventricular function (r\u00a0=\u00a00.41, P\u00a0=\u00a0.04). The early fall in NC monocytes post-reperfusion was confirmed in a second prospective study of 13 STEMI patients. Furthermore, in a mouse cardiac ischemia model, there was significant monocyte adhesion to coronary vessel endothelium at 2 hours post-reperfusion pointing to a specific and rapid vessel margination response to cardiac injury. In conclusion, rapid depletion of NC monocytes from the circulation in STEMI patients following coronary artery reperfusion correlates with the level of acute cardiac injury and involves rapid margination to the coronary vasculature.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2021-04-30", "authors": ["Sarah AMarsh", "CatherinePark", "Rachael ERedgrave", "EshaSingh", "LiliaDraganova", "Stephen EBoag", "LukeSpray", "SimiAli", "IoakimSpyridopoulos", "Helen MArthur"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.202100240R"}
{"title": "Role of Podoplanin-Positive Cells in Cardiac Fibrosis and Angiogenesis After Ischemia.", "abstract": "New insights into the cellular and extra-cellular composition of scar tissue after myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. Recently, a heterogeneous podoplanin-expressing cell population has been associated with fibrogenic and inflammatory responses and lymphatic vessel growth during scar formation. Podoplanin is a mucin-like transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in heart development, cell motility, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. In the adult mouse heart, podoplanin is expressed only by cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells; after MI, it is acquired with an unexpected heterogeneity by PDGFR\u03b1-, PDGFR\u03b2-, and CD34-positive cells.

Our aims are to further investigate the underlying regulatory mechanisms/pathways of KCNQ1OT1 in DCM.\nIn vitro and in vivo models of DCM were established in high glucose (HG)-treated human cardiomyocytes and in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice, respectively. Gene and protein expressions were examined by qPCR, western blotting and ELISA. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by CCK8 assay, flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. The association between KCNQ1OT1\u00a0and miR-181a-5p, miR-181a-5p and PDCD4 was predicted using bioinformatics methods and subsequently confirmed by dual luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Mouse cardiac tissues were collected and analysed using HE staining, Masson's staining and immunohistochemical analysis.\nKCNQ1OT1 and PDCD4 were upregulated in HG-treated human cardiomyocytes, while miR-181a-5p was downregulated. In addition, KCNQ1OT1 could negatively regulate miR-181a-5p expression; meanwhile, miR-181a-5p also negatively regulated PDCD4 expression. KCNQ1OT1 silencing suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines and cell apoptosis in vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-181a-5p abrogated those effects of KCNQ1OT1 knockdown. Moreover, overexpressed PDCD4 abolished the inhibition on inflammation and apoptosis caused by miR-181a-5p overexpression. Finally, KCNQ1OT1 knockdown reduced the expression of PDCD4 via regulating miR-181a-5p and inhibited myocardial inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the in vivo DCM model.\nOur findings suggest that KCNQ1OT1 and its target gene miR-181a-5p regulate myocardial inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis by modulating PDCD4 in DCM.", "journal": "Acta diabetologica", "date": "2021-04-29", "authors": ["Shuo-FangZhao", "Ying-XianYe", "Jin-DongXu", "YiHe", "Deng-WenZhang", "Zheng-YuanXia", "ShengWang"], "doi": "10.1007/s00592-021-01713-x\n10.1007/5584_2017_105\n10.1158/0008-5472.Can-16-2634\n10.1007/s00125-014-3171-6\n10.1038/s41598-018-20703-8\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.03.005\n10.1080/14017431.2018.1546896\n10.1538/expanim.19-0058\n10.1538/expanim.19-0058\n10.3892/ol.2018.7777\n10.1158/2159-8290.Cd-17-0507\n10.1139/bcb-2016-0110\n10.1002/emmm.201100209\n10.1038/nrendo.2015.216\n10.1007/s00125-017-4390-4\n10.1159/000486357\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2011.02.020\n10.1016/j.biocel.2008.03.002\n10.1186/s40880-016-0158-3\n10.18632/oncotarget.9597\n10.1007/s11010-016-2913-9\n10.1007/s10495-013-0830-x\n10.1210/jc.2017-01909\n10.1210/jc.2017-01909\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.06.022\n10.1186/s12872-018-0939-5\n10.1007/s11010-016-2729-7\n10.1136/heartjnl-2013-305402\n10.1016/j.phrs.2017.05.029\n10.1073/pnas.1101450108\n10.1007/s00018-016-2174-5\n10.1002/jcp.28344\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.05.017\n10.1042/cs20120448\n10.1074/jbc.M114.573089\n10.1161/circresaha.115.303836\n10.2337/db13-0097\n10.1096/fj.201900310R\n10.1038/cddis.2016.181\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7046-9_1\n10.1038/s41419-018-1029-4\n10.1159/000494576\n10.3727/096504017x14982569377511\n10.1136/bmjdrc-2019-001081\n10.1111/1440-1681.13094\n10.1007/s00125-015-3622-8\n10.3389/fgene.2014.00185\n10.1159/000452506"}
{"title": "Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptorACE2 in human heart is associated with uncontrolled diabetes, obesity, and activation of the renin angiotensin system.", "abstract": "Diabetic and obese patients are at higher risk of severe disease and cardiac injury in\u00a0corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly expressed in normal hearts. There is a disagreement regarding the effect of factors such as obesity and diabetes on ACE2 expression in the human heart and whether treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or anti-diabetic medications increases ACE2 expression and subsequently the susceptibility to infection. We designed this study to elucidate factors that control ACE2 expression in human serum, human heart biopsies, and mice.\nRight atrial appendage biopsies were collected from 79 patients that underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We investigated the alteration in ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in heart tissue and serum. ACE2 expression was compared with clinical risk factors: diabetes, obesity and different anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic therapies. WT or db/db mice were infused with Angiotensin II (ATII), treated with different anti-diabetic drugs (Metformin, GLP1A and SGLT2i) were also tested.\nACE2 gene expression was increased in diabetic hearts compared to non-diabetic hearts and was positively correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. ACE2 was not differentially expressed in patients who were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prior to the operation. We found no correlation between plasma free ACE2 and cardiac tissue ACE2 expression. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), metalloprotease ADAM10 and ADAM17 that facilitate viral-ACE2 complex entry and degradation were increased in diabetic hearts. ACE2 expression in mice was increased with ATII infusion and attenuated following anti-diabetic drugs treatment.\nPatients with uncontrolled diabetes or obesity with RAS activation have higher ACE2 expressions therefore are at higher risk for severe infection.

{"title": "Sex-dependent vulnerability of fetal nonhuman primate cardiac mitochondria to moderate maternal nutrient reduction.", "abstract": "Poor maternal nutrition in pregnancy affects fetal development, predisposing offspring to cardiometabolic diseases. The role of mitochondria during fetal development on later-life cardiac dysfunction caused by maternal nutrient reduction (MNR) remains unexplored. We hypothesized that MNR during gestation causes fetal cardiac bioenergetic deficits, compromising cardiac mitochondrial metabolism and reserve capacity. To enable human translation, we developed a primate baboon model (Papio spp.) of moderate MNR in which mothers receive 70% of control nutrition during pregnancy, resulting in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) offspring and later exhibiting myocardial remodeling and heart failure at human equivalent \u223c25 years. Term control and MNR baboon offspring were necropsied following cesarean-section, and left ventricle (LV) samples were collected. MNR adversely impacted fetal cardiac LV mitochondria in a sex-dependent fashion. Increased maternal plasma aspartate aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and elevated cortisol levels in MNR concomitant with decreased blood insulin in male fetal MNR were measured. MNR resulted in a two-fold increase in fetal LV mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MNR resulted in increased transcripts for several respiratory chain (NDUFB8, UQCRC1, and cytochrome c) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase proteins. However, MNR fetal LV mitochondrial complex I and complex II/III activities were significantly decreased, possibly contributing to the 73% decreased ATP content and increased lipid peroxidation. MNR fetal LV showed mitochondria with sparse and disarranged cristae dysmorphology.

{"title": "Antiretroviral Drugs Regulate Epigenetic Modification of Cardiac Cells Through Modulation of H3K9 and H3K27 Acetylation.", "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced the rate of mortality in HIV infected population, but people living with HIV (PLWH) show higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the effect of antiretroviral (ARV) drug treatment on cardiac cells is not clear. In this study, we explored the effect of ARV drugs in cardiomyocyte epigenetic remodeling. Primary cardiomyocytes were treated with a combination of four ARV drugs (ritonavir, abacavir, atazanavir, and lamivudine), and epigenetic changes were examined. Our data suggest that ARV drugs treatment significantly reduces acetylation at H3K9 and H3K27 and promotes methylation at H3K9 and H3K27, which are histone marks for gene expression activation and gene repression, respectively. Besides, ARV drugs treatment causes pathological changes in the cell through increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular hypertrophy. Further, the expression of chromatin remodeling enzymes was monitored in cardiomyocytes treated with ARV drugs using PCR array. The PCR array data indicated that the expression of epigenetic enzymes was differentially regulated in the ARV drugs treated cardiomyocytes. Consistent with the PCR array result, SIRT1, SUV39H1, and EZH2 protein expression was significantly upregulated in ARV drugs treated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of the heart tissue from HIV+ patients showed that the expression of SIRT1, SUV39H1, and EZH2 was up-regulated in patients with a history of ART. Additionally, we found that expression of SIRT1 can protect cardiomyocytes in presence of ARV drugs through reduction of cellular ROS and cellular hypertrophy.

In this review, we will first outline the fundamental biological building blocks required to form a functional unit of cardiac muscle, including iPSC-derived cells differentiated by soluble factors (e.g., small molecules), extracellular matrix scaffolds, and exogenous biophysical maturation cues. We will then summarize the different fabrication approaches and strategies employed to reconstruct the heart in vitro at varying scales and geometries.

{"title": "Mortality in Common (Sterna hirundo) and Sandwich (Thalasseus sandvicensis) Terns Associated with Bisgaard Taxon 40 Infection on Marco Island, Florida, USA.", "abstract": "Widely distributed aquatic species such as terns are highly dependent on, and can serve as indicators of, the global health of marine and other aquatic environments. Documented mass mortality events in terns have been associated with anthropogenic, weather-related and, less commonly, infectious causes. This study describes a multispecies mortality event associated with brevetoxicosis and Bisgaard taxon 40-induced sepsis involving common (Sterna hirundo) and sandwich (Thalasseus sandvicensis) terns off the southwest coast of Florida, USA, in November and December 2018. During an approximately 6-8-week period, a large number of birds were found dead or displayed weakness, ataxia or other neurological signs. Many were admitted to a wildlife hospital for evaluation, but most died or were euthanized due to poor prognosis. Necropsy of 12 birds revealed minimal or non-specific gross lesions. Initial toxicology screening of tissues for brevetoxins revealed levels that could be consistent with brevetoxicosis. However, histology revealed multiorgan inflammation and necrosis associated with a gram-negative bacillus. A bacterium isolated on aerobic culture of liver and heart tissues was unidentifiable in the MALDI-TOF database. Subsequently, 16\u00a0S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the isolate shared 99.33% homology with Bisgaard taxon 40 from the Pasteurellaceae family. While the source of the bacterium and potential association with brevetoxin exposure are unclear, histopathology suggests that the bacterium was the proximate cause of clinical signs and mortality in all birds examined as well as the scale of the mortality event. This report highlights the need to conduct detailed investigations into wildlife mortality events and expands on the current, limited knowledge of the effects of novel Pasteurellaceae bacteria on avian health.", "journal": "Journal of comparative pathology", "date": "2021-04-26", "authors": ["Kevin DNiedringhaus", "Lisa AShender", "AdamDiNuovo", "Leanne JFlewelling", "GrazieliMaboni", "SusanSanchez", "P JDeitschel", "JoannaFitzgerald", "Nicole MNemeth"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcpa.2021.01.009"}
{"title": "Transverse isotropic modelling of left-ventricle passive filling: Mechanical characterization for epicardial biomaterial manufacturing.", "abstract": "Biomaterials applied to the epicardium have been studied intensively in recent years for different therapeutic purposes. Their mechanical influence on the heart, however, has not been clearly identified. Most biomaterials for epicardial applications are manufactured as membranes or cardiac patches that have isotropic geometry, which is not well suited to myocardial wall motion. Myocardial wall motion during systole and diastole produces a complex force in different directions. Membrane or cardiac patches that cannot adapt to these specific directions will exert an inappropriate force on the heart, at the risk of overly restricting or dilating it. Accurately characterizing the mechanical properties of the myocardial wall is thus essential, through analysis of muscle orientation and elasticity. In this study, we investigated the Hertz contact theory for characterizing cardiac tissue, using nanoindentation measurements to distinguish different patterns in the local myocardium. We then evaluated the predictive accuracy of this model using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to mimic the diastolic phase of the heart. Our results, extracted from instrumented nanoindentation experiments in a liquid environment using five pig hearts, revealed variations in elasticity according to the local orientation of the myocardial tissue. In addition, applying the Finite Element Method (FEM) in our model based on transverse isotropy and local tissue orientation proved able to accurately simulate the passive filling of a left ventricle (LV) in a representative 3D geometry. Our model enables improved understanding of the underlying mechanical properties of the LV wall and can serve as a guide for designing and manufacturing biomedical material better adapted to the local epicardial tissue.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2021-04-24", "authors": ["Jean-PhilippeJehl", "PanDan", "ArnaudVoignier", "NguyenTran", "ThierryBastogne", "PabloMaureira", "FranckCleymand"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104492"}
{"title": "Characterizing a long-term chronic heart failure model by transcriptomic alterations and monitoring of cardiac remodeling.", "abstract": "The long-term characteristics of transcriptomic alterations and cardiac remodeling in chronic heart failure (CHF) induced by myocardial infarction (MI) in mice are not well elucidated. This study aimed to reveal the dynamic changes in the transcriptome and cardiac remodeling in post-MI mice over a long time period. Monitoring C57BL/6 mice with MI for 8 months showed that approximately 44% of mice died of cardiac rupture in the first 2 weeks and others survived to 8 months with left ventricular (LV) aneurysm. The transcriptomic profiling analysis of cardiac tissues showed that the Integrin and WNT pathways were activated at 8 months after MI while the metabolism-related pathways were inversely inhibited. Subsequent differential analysis at 1 and 8 months post-MI revealed significant enrichments in biological processes, including consistent regulation of metabolism-related pathways.

{"title": "Conductive biomaterials for cardiac repair: A review.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the fatal diseases in humans. Its incidence is constantly increasing annually all over the world. The problem is accompanied by the limited regenerative capacity of cardiomyocytes, yielding fibrous scar tissue formation. The propagation of electrical impulses in such tissue is severely hampered, negatively influencing the normal heart pumping function. Thus, reconstruction of the internal cardiac electrical connection is currently a major concern of myocardial repair. Conductive biomaterials with or without cell loading were extensively investigated to address this problem. This article introduces a detailed overview of the recent progress in conductive biomaterials and fabrication methods of conductive scaffolds for cardiac repair. After that, the advances in myocardial tissue construction in vitro by the restoration of intercellular communication and simulation of the dynamic electrophysiological environment are systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the latest trend in the study of cardiac repair in vivo using various conductive patches is summarized. Finally, we discuss the achievements and shortcomings of the existing conductive biomaterials and the properties of an ideal conductive patch for myocardial repair. We hope this review will help readers understand the importance and usefulness of conductive biomaterials in cardiac repair and inspire researchers to design and develop new conductive patches to meet the clinical requirements. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: After myocardial infarction, the infarcted myocardial area is gradually replaced by heterogeneous fibrous tissue with inferior conduction properties, resulting in arrhythmia and heart remodeling. Conductive biomaterials have been extensively adopted to solve the problem. Summarizing the relevant literature, this review presents an overview of the types and fabrication methods of conductive biomaterials, and focally discusses the recent advances in myocardial tissue construction in vitro and myocardial repair in vivo, which is rarely covered in previous reviews. As well, the deficiencies of the existing conductive patches and their construction strategies for myocardial repair are discussed as well as the improving directions. Confidently, the readers of this review would appreciate advantages and current limitations of conductive biomaterials/patches in cardiac repair.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2021-04-23", "authors": ["YimengLi", "LeqianWei", "LizhenLan", "YayaGao", "QianZhang", "HewanDawit", "JifuMao", "LameiGuo", "LiShen", "LuWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2021.04.018"}

{"title": "Human cardiac fibroblasts produce pro-inflammatory cytokines upon TLRs and RLRs stimulation.", "abstract": "Heart inflammation is one of the major causes of heart damage that leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and often progresses to end-stage heart failure. In the present study, we aimed to assess whether human cardiac cells could release immune mediators upon stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs).Commercially available human cardiac fibroblasts and an immortalized human cardiomyocyte cell line were stimulated in vitro with TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 agonists. In addition, cytosolic RLRs were activated in cardiac cells after transfection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyIC). Upon stimulation of TLR3, TLR4, MDA5, and RIG-I, but not upon stimulation of TLR2, human cardiac fibroblasts produced high amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. On the contrary, the immortalized human cardiomyocyte cell line was unresponsive to the tested TLRs agonists. Upon RLRs stimulation, cardiac fibroblasts, and to a lesser extent the cardiomyocyte cell line, induced anti-viral IFN-\u03b2 expression.These data demonstrate that human cardiac fibroblasts and an immortalized human cardiomyocyte cell line differently respond to various TLRs and RLRs ligands. In particular, human cardiac fibroblasts were able to induce pro-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines on their own.

Moreover, Danggui, a Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is used for the treatment of cardioprotective effects. In this study, to evaluate whether the combined effect of MSCs and TCM can recover the cardiac function in late-stage hypertension rats. We observed that lower dose of Danggui crude extract treatment showed an increased level of cell viability with maintained stemness properties and growth rate in rat adipose-derived stem cells (rADSCs). Further, we cocultured the H9c2 cells with rADSCs and the results revealed that Danggui-treated MSCs enhanced the IGF1R expression and attenuated the hypertrophy in H9c2 cells against Ang II challenge by immunoblot and rhodamine-phalloidin staining. In addition, Danggui crude extract was also quantified and characterized by HPLC and LC-MS analysis. Furthermore, the in vivo study was performed by considering 11\u2009months old rats (n = 7). Importantly, the oral administration of Danggui crude extract with stem cells intravenous injection in SHR-D-ADSCs group showed a combination effect to augment the cardiac function through enhancement of ejection fraction, fractional shortening, contractility function in the late-stage hypertension conditions. We have also observed a decreased apoptosis rate in the heart tissue of SHR-D-ADSCs group.

We hypothesize that maternal exposure to \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) during pregnancy will impair fetal development, leading to cardiac dysfunction in the offspring.\nPregnant Wistar rats were randomly selected and administered 3\u2009mg/kg of \u03949-THC or saline as a vehicle daily via intraperitoneal injection from gestational days 6 to 22, followed by echocardiogram analysis of cardiac function on offspring at postnatal days 1 and 21. Heart tissue was harvested from the offspring at 3 weeks for molecular analysis of cardiac remodelling.\nExposure to \u03949-THC during pregnancy led to FGR with a significant decrease in heart-to-body weight ratios at birth. By 3 weeks, pups exhibited catch-up growth associated with significantly greater left ventricle anterior wall thickness with a decrease in cardiac output. Moreover, these \u03949-THC-exposed offsprings exhibited increased expression of collagen I and III, decreased matrix metallopeptidase-2 expression, and increased inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2, all associated with cardiac remodelling.\nCollectively, these data suggest that \u03949-THC-exposed FGR offspring undergo postnatal catch-up growth concomitant with cardiac remodelling and impaired cardiac function early in life.\nTo date, the long-term effects of perinatal \u03949-THC (the main psychoactive component) exposure on the cardiac function in the offspring remain unknown. We demonstrated, for the first time, that exposure to \u03949-THC alone during rat pregnancy results in significantly smaller hearts relative to body weight.

{"title": "Quantitative proteome comparison of human hearts with those of model organisms.", "abstract": "Delineating human cardiac pathologies and their basic molecular mechanisms relies on research conducted in model organisms. Yet translating findings from preclinical models to humans present a significant challenge, in part due to differences in cardiac protein expression between humans and model organisms. Proteins immediately determine cellular function, yet their large-scale investigation in hearts has lagged behind those of genes and transcripts. Here, we set out to bridge this knowledge gap: By analyzing protein profiles in humans and commonly used model organisms across cardiac chambers, we determine their commonalities and regional differences. We analyzed cardiac tissue from each chamber of human, pig, horse, rat, mouse, and zebrafish in biological replicates. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflows, we measured and evaluated the abundance of approximately 7,000 proteins in each species. The resulting knowledgebase of cardiac protein signatures is accessible through an online database: atlas.cardiacproteomics.com. Our combined analysis allows for quantitative evaluation of protein abundances across cardiac chambers, as well as comparisons of cardiac protein profiles across model organisms. Up to a quarter of proteins with differential abundances between atria and ventricles showed opposite chamber-specific enrichment between species; these included numerous proteins implicated in cardiac disease. The generated proteomics resource facilitates translational prospects of cardiac studies from model organisms to humans by comparisons of disease-linked protein networks across species.", "journal": "PLoS biology", "date": "2021-04-20", "authors": ["NoraLinscheid", "AlbertoSantos", "Pi CamillaPoulsen", "Robert WMills", "KirstineCalloe", "UlrikeLeurs", "Johan ZYe", "ChristianStolte", "Morten BThomsen", "Bo HBentzen", "Pia RLundegaard", "Morten SOlesen", "Lars JJensen", "Jesper VOlsen", "AliciaLundby"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pbio.3001144\n10.1002/prca.201300123\n10.1242/dev.143842\n10.1038/nbt.2971\n10.3390/jcdd3040030\n10.1161/ATV.0000000000000062\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.10.007\n10.1111/eci.12304\n10.1038/nature13302\n10.1038/nature13319\n10.1038/s41586-020-2402-x\n10.1073/pnas.1606444113\n10.1038/s41467-017-02467-3\n10.1056/NEJMcibr0808487\n10.1074/mcp.RA119.001878\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3000437\n10.1038/nmeth.2997\n10.1016/j.cels.2017.05.009\n10.1093/nar/gkv1248\n10.1093/nar/gkm796\n10.1093/nar/gkw937\n10.1038/ejhg.2012.283\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.05.020\n10.1111/cge.13621\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036781\n10.1089/ars.2019.7808\n10.1007/s00125-014-3171-6\n10.1038/s41467-019-11461-w\n10.1038/s41467-019-10709-9\n10.1007/978-1-62703-386-2_10\n10.1074/mcp.M111.015594\n10.1074/mcp.M700245-MCP200\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.044\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301151\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.001\n10.1126/scisignal.2003506\n10.1038/s41598-017-07883-5\n10.1038/s41467-017-01747-2\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.03.009\n10.1007/112_2016_5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045401\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.04.021\n10.1093/nar/gkx1098\n10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.185\n10.1038/nmeth.3901\n10.1101/gr.1239303"}

In this study, we evaluated the effects of arginine supplementation during the acute phase of infection under the development of chronic Chagas' heart disease in Swiss mice inoculated with the Berenice-78 strain of T. cruzi. The effectiveness of arginine was determined by daily detection of the parasite in the blood and long-term serum levels of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, in addition to evaluation of heart tissue damage. Arginine could flatten parasitemia and prevent elevation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in T. cruzi-infected mice. Regarding chronic inflammatory myocardial derangements, similar findings were verified among T. cruzi-infected groups. Arginine promoted collagenogenesis in the heart muscle tissue of T. cruzi-infected arginine-supplemented group.

On day 17, the hearts were sampled. The expression of genes such as GATA4, NKX2.5, EGFR, TRIF, and NF-\u0199B was monitored using real-time PCR analysis. Using western blotting, we measured NF-\u0199B protein level. Total antioxidant capacity, glutathione peroxidase, and Catalase activity were also studied. Microvascular density and anterior wall thickness were monitored in histological samples using H&E staining. High dose of LPS (1\u00a0mg/kbw) increased the expression of TRIF but not NF-\u0199B compared to the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). We found a statistically significant reduction in groups that received LPS\u2009+\u2009Lipase compared to the control and LPS groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

{"title": "Vascularisation of pluripotent stem cell-derived myocardium: biomechanical insights for physiological relevance in cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The myocardium is a diverse environment, requiring coordination between a variety of specialised cell types. Biochemical crosstalk between cardiomyocytes (CM) and microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) is essential to maintain contractility and healthy tissue homeostasis. Yet, as myocytes beat, heterocellular communication occurs also through constantly fluctuating biomechanical stimuli, namely (1) compressive and tensile forces generated directly by the beating myocardium, and (2) pulsatile shear stress caused by intra-microvascular flow. Despite endothelial cells (EC) being highly mechanosensitive, the role of biomechanical stimuli from beating CM as a regulatory mode of myocardial-microvascular crosstalk is relatively unexplored. Given that cardiac biomechanics are dramatically altered during disease, and disruption of myocardial-microvascular communication is a known driver of pathological remodelling, understanding the biomechanical context necessary for healthy myocardial-microvascular interaction is of high importance. The current gap in understanding can largely be attributed to technical limitations associated with reproducing dynamic physiological biomechanics in multicellular in vitro platforms, coupled with limited in vitro viability of primary cardiac tissue. However, differentiation of CM from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) has provided an unlimited source of human myocytes suitable for designing in vitro models. This technology is now converging with the diverse field of tissue engineering, which utilises in vitro techniques designed to enhance physiological relevance, such as biomimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) as 3D scaffolds, microfluidic perfusion of vascularised networks, and complex multicellular architectures generated via 3D bioprinting. These strategies are now allowing researchers to design in vitro platforms which emulate the cell composition, architectures, and biomechanics specific to the myocardial-microvascular microenvironment. Inclusion of physiological multicellularity and biomechanics may also induce a more mature phenotype in stem cell-derived CM, further enhancing their value.

{"title": "Inflammatory Injury and Mitophagy in the Cock Heart Induced by the Oral Administration of Hexavalent Chromium.", "abstract": "As a highly toxic heavy metal, chromium has caused a certain threat to public health and livestock breeding in recent years. In poultry, as one of our most commonly consumed meat product, its health issues will seriously threaten the safety of human life. As previous studies have confirmed, when cells are stimulated by the external environment, mitochondria, as an organelle that provides energy to the cells, can cause damage and autophagy. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether Cr(VI) can cause mitophagy in cock heart. We first randomly divided 32 cocks into four groups to explore the mechanism of this effect. The cocks were then separately exposed to four different dose levels, namely, the control level and 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg levels, via daily oral intake into the body through mixed feeding for 45 days. After 45 days, we sampled and detected pathological changes and the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), and mitophagy-related proteins (LC3, p62/SQTM1, TOMM20, and Parkin). We found that IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and LC3II contents increased with the increase in Cr(VI) concentration. However, MMP, ATPases, p62/SQTM1, and TOMM20 levels decreased with the increase in Cr(VI) concentration. At the same time, Cr(VI) exposure caused heart tissue damages and Parkin translocation. In conclusion, our results proved that inflammatory damage, mitochondrial function damage, and mitophagy in cock heart tissues were dependent on Cr(VI) concentration.", "journal": "Biological trace element research", "date": "2021-04-15", "authors": ["YueWang", "LumeiWang", "XiaozhouWang", "GuodongCheng", "YuxiaoXing", "MeihuaZhang", "PuZhang", "JianzhuLiu"], "doi": "10.1007/s12011-021-02715-0\n10.1016/j.taap.2008.11.018\n10.1016/j.cbpc.2017.10.004\n10.1007/s12011-016-0901-2\n10.1007/s12011-018-1571-z\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.120\n10.1093/toxsci/kfq263\n10.1016/j.cotox.2019.05.003\n10.1002/jbt.21697\n10.1007/s12011-015-0283-x\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110901\n10.1007/s12011-016-0915-9\n10.1002/jcp.27527\n10.1007/978-94-007-2888-2_6\n10.1007/s11356-020-09062-y\n10.1016/j.abb.2007.03.034\n10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2019.110698\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.09.009\n10.1007/s12011-019-01795-3\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.07.032\n10.1007/s11356-019-06253-0\n10.1080/10590501.2015.1096883\n10.1016/j.yrtph.2015.09.007\n10.1016/j.tcb.2016.05.008\n10.1007/s10661-019-7528-7\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.01.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0168688\n10.1038/s41594-018-0088-7\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129005\n10.1016/j.febslet.2007.01.096\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.01.143\n10.1007/s11356-020-08544-3\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110414\n10.1080/15548627.2019.1643185\n10.7888/juoeh.40.157\n10.1016/j.fsi.2017.10.047\n10.1042/BCJ20200262\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.04.084"}

Recent evidence suggests a crosstalk between cinacalcet and AMPK activation. This study investigated the effects of cinacalcet on cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in type 2 diabetic rats (T2DM). High fat diet for 4\u00a0weeks combined with single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (30\u00a0mg/kg) was used to induce type 2 diabetes in rats. Diabetic rats were either orally treated with vehicle, 5 or 10\u00a0mg/kg cinacalcet for 4\u00a0weeks. Control rats were fed standard chow diet and intraperitoneally injected with citrate buffer. T2DM rats showed lower body weight (BW), hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, along with increased heart weight (HW) and HW/BW ratio. Masson's trichrome stained cardiac sections revealed massive fibrosis in T2DM rats. There were increased TGF-\u03b21 and hydroxyproline levels, coupled with up-regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in hearts of T2DM rats. These alterations were associated with redox imbalance and impaired cardiac functions. Decreased phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine172 residue was found in T2DM hearts. Cinacalcet for 4\u00a0weeks significantly activated AMPK and alleviated cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting blood glucose, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Cinacalcet increased the mitochondrial DNA content, and expressions of PGC-1\u03b1, UCP-3, beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. Cinacalcet decreased the pro-apoptotic Bax, while increased the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in cardiac tissue of T2DM rats.

Expression of target genes is normalized to expression of stable reference genes to account for sample preparation variability. Thus, the identification and validation of stably expressed reference genes is crucial for making accurate, quantitative, statistical conclusions in gene expression studies. Traditional housekeeping genes identified decades ago based on high and relatively stable expression are often used, although many have shown these to not be valid, particularly in highly dynamic systems such as stem cell differentiation. In this study we outline a rational approach to identify stable reference genes valid throughout human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation to hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Several publicly available transcriptomic data sets were analyzed to identify genes with low variability in expression throughout differentiation. These putative novel reference genes were subsequently validated in RT-qPCR analyses to assess their stability under various perturbations, including maturation during extended culture, lactate purification, and various differentiation efficiencies.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), are reported to play critical roles in regulating key aspects of cardiomyocyte physiologic and pathologic signaling, including the regulation of cardiac regeneration both ", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-04-13", "authors": ["TingYuan", "JayaKrishnan"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.650566\n10.1089/nat.2020.0871\n10.1093/cvr/cvy065\n10.1136/heart.87.5.480\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1038/nature11919\n10.1161/circresaha.118.314223\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa071\n10.1007/s10741-016-9533-z\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.04.085\n10.1038/s41418-020-0492-5\n10.1016/j.febslet.2013.01.075\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.08.013\n10.1161/circresaha.112.300658\n10.1038/ng1725\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.10.021\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.01.008\n10.1016/j.ncrna.2017.06.001\n10.1074/jbc.m115.672659\n10.1083/jcb.201011099\n10.1093/cvr/cvw031\n10.1038/nature03049\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.049\n10.1074/jbc.m109.027896\n10.1161/circresaha.116.310051\n10.1038/clpt.2013.138\n10.1038/nature11739\n10.1038/nrg2290\n10.1016/j.ncrna.2017.05.001\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.05.022\n10.1038/s41569-018-0036-6\n10.1161/circresaha.115.307017\n10.1186/1423-0127-18-22\n10.1159/000495173\n10.1038/cr.2017.91\n10.1161/circulationaha.113.001904\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00030\n10.1042/cs20181002\n10.1161/circulationaha.118.038361\n10.1038/mtna.2016.12\n10.1111/jcmm.12990\n10.1161/circresaha.111.244442\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.01.016\n10.1161/circresaha.112.269035\n10.1161/circresaha.116.304510\n10.3390/ijms150915891\n10.1038/nbt.1535\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.01.003\n10.1038/nature04303\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.08.042\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000795\n10.1093/cvr/cvy075\n10.1371/journal.pone.0074504\n10.21037/cdt-20-490\n10.18632/oncotarget.9597\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.06.163\n10.1101/gad.1738708\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.02.014\n10.1038/ng.710\n10.1016/b978-0-12-407676-1.00002-0\n10.1038/nature08725\n10.3389/fphys.2020.580465\n10.1038/cdd.2013.125\n10.1073/pnas.1301019110\n10.4155/fmc.13.196\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.09.016\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050515\n10.1042/cs20130011\n10.1161/circresaha.111.248880\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1073/pnas.1208863110\n10.1038/nature11044\n10.1084/jem.20101547\n10.1002/jcp.28773\n10.1089/scd.2011.0152\n10.1161/circresaha.108.193102\n10.1073/pnas.0602831103\n10.1161/circulationaha.108.814145\n10.1038/cddis.2015.89\n10.1073/pnas.1608256113\n10.7150/thno.15162\n10.1161/atvbaha.109.197434\n10.1038/nature11139\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3010841\n10.1186/scrt464\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.01.013\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.12.005\n10.1161/circgenetics.109.934281\n10.1038/s41434-018-0045-4\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.08.024\n10.1038/emm.2017.150\n10.1073/pnas.1313192110\n10.1038/nrm3619\n10.1093/cvr/cvu254\n10.1161/circresaha.117.305962\n10.1093/cvr/cvq053\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.02.018\n10.7150/thno.19764\n10.1016/j.cell.2004.06.017\n10.18632/oncotarget.15544\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.030\n10.1038/nature03817"}
{"title": "Periplocymarin protects against myocardial fibrosis induced by \u03b2-adrenergic activation in mice.", "abstract": "Periplocymarin is an effective component of Periplocae Cortex, which was wildly used as an ingredient in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Our group previously reported that periplocymarin exerted cardiotonic role via promoting calcium influx. However, its exact role in the pathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis has not been elucidated yet. The present study was aimed at determining the potential effect and underlying mechanism of periplocymarin in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial fibrosis. C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously injected with ISO (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) or saline for 1 week. The early-to-atrial wave ratio (E/A ratio) measured by echocardiography revealed that ISO-induced heart stiffness was remarkably reversed by administration of periplocymarin (5\u00a0mg/kg/day). Masson trichrome staining exhibited that treatment of periplocymarin reduced the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Further investigations employing real-time PCR and western blot demonstrated that periplocymarin suppressed the expression of fibrosis related genes (Col1a1, Col3a1, Acta2 and Tgfb1) and proteins (Collagen I, Collagen III, \u03b1-SMA and TGF-\u03b21) induced by ISO. Metabolomics analysis demonstrated that periplocymarin ameliorated the disorders triggered by ISO and many of the differential metabolic substances were involved in amino acid, glucose and lipid metabolism. Further analysis using network pharmacology revealed that three key genes, namely NOS2, NOS3 and Ptgs2, may be the potential targets of periplocymarin and responsible for the disorders. Validation using heart tissues showed that the mRNA expression of NOS3 was decreased while Ptgs2 was increased upon ISO treatment, which were reversed by periplocymarin. Moreover, the expression of COX-2 (Ptgs2 encoded protein) was consistent with the aspect of Ptgs2 mRNA, while eNOS (NOS3 encoded protein) expression was unchanged. In vitro studies exhibited that periplocymarin exerts anti-fibrotic function via regulating at least eNOS and COX-2 in cardiomyocyte. Taken together, periplocymarin protects against myocardial fibrosis induced by \u03b2-adrenergic activation, the potential mechanism was that periplocymarin targeted on, at least eNOS and COX-2, to improve the metabolic processes of cardiomyocyte and thus attenuated the myocardial fibrosis.

The dextran hydrogels were generated in situ by using hydrazone formation as the crosslinking reaction. Material properties were flexibly adjusted, by varying the degrees of derivatization and the molecular weight of dextran used. Furthermore, to modulate dextran's bioactivity, cyclic pentapeptide RGD was coupled to its backbone. BCTs were generated by using a blend of modified dextran and human collagen (hColI) in combination with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and fibroblasts. These hColI + Dex blends with or without RGD supported tissue formation and functional maturation of CMs. Contraction forces (hColI + Dex-RGD: 0.27 \u00b1 0.02 mN; hColI + Dex: 0.26 \u00b1 0.01 mN) and frequencies were comparable to published constructs.

First, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used in detecting TCC in embryos in\u00a0vivo after exposure to various TCC. Results showed that embryonic TCC content reached 9.23\u00a0ng after exposure to 300\u00a0\u03bcg/L TCC, the heart rates of the embryos markedly decreased, heart abnormalities significantly increased. In addition, obvious pericardial effusion was observed in the larvae. Through transcriptome sequencing, 200 differential gene expression (DGE) patterns were detected in the TCC (300\u00a0\u03bcg/L) experimental and control groups. The results of GO function analysis and KEGG pathway of DGE showed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation and cyp-related genes (cyp1a, cyp1b1 and cyp1c) were significantly up-regulated. these affected the normal development of zebrafish embryonic heart, tissue edema, and hemorrhage. TCC exhibited strong cardiac teratogenic effects and developmental toxicity, which is partly related to AhR activation.

{"title": "Autophagy in the diabetic heart: A potential pharmacotherapeutic target in diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Association of diabetes with an elevated risk of cardiac failure has been clinically evident. Diabetes potentiates diastolic and systolic cardiac failure following the myocardial infarction that produces the cardiac muscle-specific microvascular complication, clinically termed as diabetic cardiomyopathy. Elevated susceptibility of diabetic cardiomyopathy is primarily caused by the generation of free radicals in the hyperglycemic milieu, compromising the myocardial contractility and normal cardiac functions with increasing redox insult, impaired mitochondria, damaged organelles, apoptosis, and cardiomyocytes fibrosis. Autophagy is essentially involved in the recycling/clearing the damaged organelles, cytoplasmic contents, and aggregates, which are frequently produced in cardiomyocytes. Although autophagy plays a vital role in maintaining the cellular homeostasis in diligent cardiac tissues, this process is frequently impaired in the diabetic heart. Given its clinical significance, accumulating evidence largely showed the functional aspects of autophagy in diabetic cardiomyopathy, elucidating its intricate protective and pathogenic outcomes. However, etiology and molecular readouts of these contrary autophagy activities in diabetic cardiomyopathy are not yet comprehensively assessed and translated. In this review, we attempted to assess the role of autophagy and its adaptations in the diabetic heart. To delineate the molecular consequences of these events, we provided detailed insights into the autophagy regulation pieces of machinery including the mTOR/AMPK, TFEB/ZNSCAN3, FOXOs, SIRTs, PINK1/Parkin, Nrf2, miRNAs, and others in the diabetic cardiomyopathy. Given the clinical significance of autophagy in the diabetic heart, we further discussed the potential pharmacotherapeutic strategies towards targeting autophagy.

However, the underlying mechanism ofclaudin-5 is unclear. Here we investigated the molecular actions of claudin-5 in perspective of mitochondria in cardiomyocytes to better understand the role of claudin-5 in cardioprotection during ischemia.\nMyocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R; 30 min/24 h) and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R; 24 h/4 h) were used in this study. Confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to observe mitochondrial morphology.\nClaudin-5 was detected in murine heart tissue and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM). Its protein level was severely decreased after myocardial I/R or H/R. Confocal microscopy showedclaudin-5 presented in the mitochondria of NRCM. H/R-induced claudin-5 downregulation was accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation. The mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) expressionwas dramatically decreased while the dynamin-related protein (Drp) 1 expression was significantly increased after H/R.

{"title": "Anisotropic conductive reduced graphene oxide/silk matrices promote post-infarction myocardial function by restoring electrical integrity.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the leading cause of death globally, often leading to impaired cardiac function and pathological myocardial microenvironment. Electrical conduction abnormalities of the infarcted myocardium not only induce adverse myocardial remodeling but also prevent tissue repair. Restoring the myocardial electrical integrity, particularly the anisotropic electrical signal propagation within the injured area after infarction is crucial for an effective function recovery. Herein, optimized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) functionalized electrospun silk fibroin (rGO/silk) biomaterials presenting anisotropic conductivity and enhanced suturablity were developed and investigated as cardiac patches for their potential in improving the post-MI myocardial function of rat models. The results show that the anisotropic conductive rGO/silk patches exhibit remarkable therapeutic effect on repairing the infarcted myocardium compared to the nonconductive silk and isotropic conductive rGO/silk patches as determined by the enhanced pumping function, reduced susceptibility to arrhythmias, thickened left ventricular walls and improved survival of functional cardiomyocytes. Their notable effect on promoting the angiogenesis of capillaries in the infarcted myocardium has also been demonstrated. This study highlights an effective and biomimetic reconstruction of the electrical myocardial microenvironment based on the anisotropic conductive rGO/silk biomaterials as a promising option for promoting the repair of infarcted myocardium. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The dysfunctional electrical microenvironment in the infarcted myocardium not only aggravates the adverse myocardial remodeling but also limits the effect of cardiac regenerative medicine. Although various conductive biomaterials have been employed to restore the electrical network in the infarcted myocardium in vivo, the anisotropic nature of the myocardial electrical microenvironment which enables directional electrical signal propagation were neglected. In this study, an anisotropic conductive rGO/silk biomaterial system is developed to improve the myocardial function post infarction by restoring the anisotropic electrical microenvironment in the infarcted myocardium.

{"title": "Selenium, Selenoproteins, and Heart Failure: Current Knowledge and Future Perspective.", "abstract": "(Mal-)nutrition of micronutrients, like selenium, has great impact on the human heart and improper micronutrient intake was observed in 30-50% of patients with heart failure. Low selenium levels have been reported in Europe and Asia and thought to be causal for Keshan disease. Selenium is an essential micronutrient that is needed for enzymatic activity of the 25 so-called selenoproteins, which have a broad range of activities. In this review, we aim to summarize the current evidence about selenium in heart failure and to provide insights about the potential mechanisms that can be modulated by selenoproteins.\nSuboptimal selenium levels (<100 \u03bcg/L) are prevalent in more than 70% of patients with heart failure and were associated with lower exercise capacity, lower quality of life, and worse prognosis. Small clinical trials assessing selenium supplementation in patients with HF showed improvement of clinical symptoms (NYHA class), left ventricular ejection fraction, and lipid profile, while governmental interventional programs in endemic areas have significantly decreased the incidence of Keshan disease. In addition, several selenoproteins are found impaired in suboptimal selenium conditions, potentially aggravating underlying mechanisms like oxidative stress, inflammation, and thyroid hormone insufficiency. While the current evidence is not sufficient to advocate selenium supplementation in patients with heart failure, there is a clear need for high level evidence to show whether treatment with selenium has a place in the contemporary treatment of patients with HF to improve meaningful clinical endpoints. Graphical summary summarizing the potential beneficial effects of the various selenoproteins, locally in cardiac tissues and systemically in the rest of the body. In short, several selenoproteins contribute in protecting the integrity of the mitochondria. By doing so, they contribute indirectly to reducing the oxidative stress as well as improving the functionality of immune cells, which are in particular vulnerable to oxidative stress. Several other selenoproteins are directly involved in antioxidative pathways, next to excreting anti-inflammatory effects. Similarly, some selenoproteins are located in the endoplasmic reticulum, playing roles in protein folding. With exception of the protection of the mitochondria and the reduction of oxidative stress, other effects are not yet investigated in cardiac tissues. The systemic effects of selenoproteins might not be limited to these mechanisms, but also may include modulation of endothelial function, protection skeletal muscles, in addition to thyroid metabolism.\nDIO, iodothyronine deiodinase; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; MsrB2, methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B2; SELENOK, selenoprotein K; SELENON, selenoprotein N; SELENOP, selenoprotein P; SELENOS, selenoprotein S; SELENOT, selenoprotein T; TXNRD, thioredoxin reductase.", "journal": "Current heart failure reports", "date": "2021-04-10", "authors": ["Ali AAl-Mubarak", "Petervan der Meer", "NilsBomer"], "doi": "10.1007/s11897-021-00511-4\n10.1002/ejhf.1644\n10.1002/ejhf.1154\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32339-4\n10.1056/NEJMoa0908355\n10.1007/s12011-018-1302-5\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfr167\n10.1093/ajcn/nqaa245\n10.1007/s00018-019-03195-1\n10.1038/s41598-017-05230-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.161273\n10.1093/jn/133.5.1457S"}

Here, we have explored the interplay between maturation by stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and by culture in 3D. We have investigated substrate metabolism in hiPSC-CMs grown as a monolayer and in 3D, in porous collagen-derived scaffolds and in engineered heart tissue (EHT), by measuring rates of glycolysis and glucose and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and changes in gene expression and mitochondrial oxygen consumption. FAO was stimulated by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1), using oleate and the agonist WY-14643, which induced an increase in FAO in monolayer hiPSC-CMs. hiPSC-CMs grown in 3D on collagen-derived scaffolds showed reduced glycolysis and increased FAO compared with monolayer cells.

Myocardial angiotensin metabolites and enzymatic activities involved in the metabolism of the key angiotensin peptides angiotensin 1-8 (AngII) and Ang1-7 were determined in left ventricular samples by mass spectrometry. Circulating angiotensin concentrations were assessed for a subgroup of patients.\nAngII and Ang2-8 (AngIII) were the dominant peptides in the failing heart, while other metabolites, especially Ang1-7, were below the detection limit. Patients receiving an ARB component (i.e., ARB or ARNi) had significantly higher levels of cardiac AngII and AngIII (AngII: 242 [interquartile range (IQR): 145.7 to 409.9] fmol/g vs 63.0 [IQR: 19.9 to 124.1] fmol/g; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; and AngIII: 87.4 [IQR: 46.5 to 165.3] fmol/g vs 23.0 [IQR:\u00a0<5.0 to 59.3] fmol/g; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Myocardial AngII concentrations were strongly related to circulating AngII levels. Myocardial RAS enzyme regulation was independent from the class of RAS inhibitor used, particularly, a comparable myocardial neprilysin activity was observed for patients with or without ARNi. Tissue chymase, but not ACE, is the main enzyme for cardiac AngII generation, whereas AngII is metabolized to Ang1-7 by prolyl carboxypeptidase but not to ACE2. There was no trace of cardiac ACE2 activity.\nThe failing heart contains considerable levels of classical RAS metabolites, whereas AngIII might be an unrecognized mediator of detrimental effects on cardiovascular structure. The results underline the importance of pharmacologic interventions reducing circulating AngII actions, yet offer room for cardiac tissue-specific RAS drugs aiming to limit myocardial AngII/AngIII peptide accumulation and actions.", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "date": "2021-04-10", "authors": ["NoemiPavo", "SuriyaPrausm\u00fcller", "GeorgSpinka", "GeorgGoliasch", "Philipp EBartko", "RaphaelWurm", "HenrikeArfsten", "GuidoStrunk", "MarkoPoglitsch", "OliverDomenig", "JuliaMascherbauer", "KezibanUyanik-\u00dcnal", "ChristianHengstenberg", "AndreasZuckermann", "MartinH\u00fclsmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jacc.2021.01.052"}
{"title": "Sulforaphane exposure impairs contractility and mitochondrial function in three-dimensional engineered heart tissue.", "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN) is a phytochemical compound extracted from cruciferous plants, like broccoli or cauliflower. Its isothiocyanate group renders SFN reactive, thus allowing post-translational modification of cellular proteins to regulate their function with the potential for biological and therapeutic actions. SFN and stabilized variants recently received regulatory approval for clinical studies in humans for the treatment of neurological disorders and cancer. Potential unwanted side effects of SFN on heart function have not been investigated yet. The present study characterizes the impact of SFN on cardiomyocyte contractile function in cardiac preparations from neonatal rat, adult mouse and human induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. This revealed a SFN-mediated negative inotropic effect, when administered either acutely or chronically, with an impairment of the Frank-Starling response to stretch activation. A direct effect of SFN on myofilament function was excluded in chemically permeabilized mouse trabeculae. However, SFN pretreatment increased lactate formation and enhanced the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species accompanied by a significant reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Transmission electron microscopy revealed disturbed sarcomeric organization and inflated mitochondria with whorled membrane shape in response to SFN exposure. Interestingly, administration of the alternative energy source l-glutamine to the medium that bypasses the uptake route of pyruvate into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle improved force development in SFN-treated EHTs, suggesting indeed mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor of SFN-mediated contractile dysfunction. Taken together, the data from the present study suggest that SFN might impact negatively on cardiac contractility in patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities undergoing SFN supplementation therapy. Therefore, cardiac function should be monitored regularly to avoid the onset of cardiotoxic side effects.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2021-04-09", "authors": ["AlexandraRhoden", "Felix WFriedrich", "TheresaBrandt", "JaniceRaabe", "MichaelaSchweizer", "JanaMeisterknecht", "IlkaWittig", "B\u00e4rbel MUlmer", "BirgitKlampe", "JuneUebeler", "AngelikaPiasecki", "KristinaLorenz", "ThomasEschenhagen", "ArneHansen", "FriederikeCuello"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2021.101951\n10.1089/jmf.2018.0024\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.126216\n10.3390/antiox9020136\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2020.113247\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.125660\n10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028514\n10.3390/molecules24193593\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00119-X\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.010\n10.1002/ejhf.1252\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.04.011\n10.1007/s00395-014-0436-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0145937\n10.3390/molecules25040829\n10.1002/mnfr.201600766\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.010\n10.1073/pnas.77.6.3186\n10.1007/s00216-015-9280-3\n10.1007/s12551-015-0184-4\n10.3892/ijo.2014.2536\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2006.04.029\n10.1007/978-1-61779-382-0_12\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114764\n10.3390/jcm9030718\n10.1038/s41419-018-1174-9\n10.1006/jmcc.2002.2105\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.010\n10.1074/jbc.M203834200\n10.1007/s10863-014-9579-3\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.08.004\n10.1016/j.ccell.2018.02.004\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00071\n10.1042/BST20160094\n10.1016/j.tibs.2015.12.001\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e74a14\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.039\n10.1073/pnas.1516732113\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01473\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.12.017"}

{"title": "The susceptibility of the rat pulmonary and caval vein myocardium to the catecholamine-induced ectopy changes oppositely in postnatal development.", "abstract": "The developmental changes of the caval (SVC) and pulmonary vein (PV) myocardium electrophysiology are traced throughout postnatal ontogenesis. The myocardium in SVC as well as in PV demonstrate age-dependent differences in the ability to maintain resting membrane potential, to manifest automaticity in a form of ectopic action potentials in basal condition and in responses to the adrenergic stimulation. Electrophysiological characteristics of two distinct types of thoracic vein myocardium change in an opposite manner during early postnatal ontogenesis with increased proarrhythmicity of pulmonary and decreased automaticity in caval veins. Predisposition of PV cardiac tissue to proarrhythmycity develops during ontogenesis in time correlation with the establishment of sympathetic innervation of the tissue. The electrophysiological properties of caval vein cardiac tissue shift from a pacemaker-like phenotype to atrial phenotype in accompaniment with sympathetic nerve growth and adrenergic receptor expression changes.\nThe thoracic vein myocardium is considered as a main source for atrial fibrillation initiation due to its high susceptibility to ectopic activity. The mechanism by which and when pulmonary (PV) and superior vena cava (SVC) became proarrhythmic during postnatal ontogenesis is still unknown. In this study, we traced postnatal changes of electrophysiology in a correlation with the sympathetic innervation and adrenergic receptor distribution to reveal developmental differences in proarrhythmicity occurrence in PV and SVC myocardium. A standard microelectrode technique was used to assess the changes in ability to maintain resting membrane potential (RMP), generate spontaneous action potentials (SAP) and adrenergically induced ectopy in multicellular SVC and PV preparations of rats of different postnatal ages. Immunofluorescence imaging was used to trace postnatal changes in sympathetic innervation, \u03b21- and \u03b11A-adrenergic receptor (AR) distribution. We revealed that the ability to generate SAP and susceptibility to adrenergic stimulation changes during postnatal ontogenesis in an opposite manner in PV and SVC myocardium. While SAP occurrence decreases with age in SVC myocardium, it significantly increases in PV cardiac tissue. PV myocardium starts to demonstrate RMP instability and proarrhythmic activity from the 14th day of postnatal life which correlates with the appearance of the sympathetic innervation of the thoracic veins. In addition, postnatal attenuation of SVC myocardium automaticity occurs concomitantly with sympathetic innervation establishment and increase in \u03b21-ARs, but not \u03b11A-AR levels.

In this work, in vitro studies to compare cECM hydrogels derived from adult porcine whole heart (WH), LV, and right ventricle (RV) were performed. The cECM from WH has similar chemical composition compared with cECM from LV and RV.

{"title": "Integrative Proteomic and Metabolomic Analysis Reveals Metabolic Phenotype in Mice With Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Natriuretic Peptide Receptor A.", "abstract": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are important biological markers and cardiac function regulators. Natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) binds to an ANP or BNP ligand and induces transmembrane signal transduction by elevating the intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. However, the metabolic phenotype and related mechanisms induced by NPRA deletion remain ambiguous. Here, we constructed myocardial-specific NPRA deletion mice and detected the heart functional and morphological characteristics by histological analysis and explored the altered metabolic pattern and the expression patterns of proteins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based omics technology. NPRA deficiency unexpectedly did not result in significant cardiac remodeling or dysfunction. However, compared with the matched littermates, NPRA-deficient mice had significant metabolic differences. Metabolomic analysis showed that the metabolite levels varied in cardiac tissues and plasma. In total, 33 metabolites were identified in cardiac tissues and 54 were identified in plasma. Compared with control mice, NPRA-deficient mice had 20 upregulated and six downregulated metabolites in cardiac tissues and 25 upregulated and 23 downregulated metabolites in plasma. Together, NPRA deficiency resulted in increased nucleotide biosynthesis and histidine metabolism only in heart tissues and decreased creatine metabolism only in plasma. Further proteomic analysis identified 136 differentially abundant proteins in cardiac tissues, including 54 proteins with higher abundance and 82 proteins with lower abundance. Among them, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7c and 7b (Cox7c, Cox7b), ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex subunit F2 (ATP5J2), ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, complex III subunit X (Uqcr10), and myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7) were mainly involved in related metabolic pathways. These results revealed the essential role of NPRA in metabolic profiles and may elucidate new underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of NPRA in cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["PanChang", "YanNiu", "XiaomengZhang", "JingZhang", "XihuiWang", "XiShen", "BaoyingChen", "JunYu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mcpro.2021.100072"}

{"title": "Bioengineering Clinically Relevant Cardiomyocytes and Cardiac Tissues from Pluripotent Stem Cells.", "abstract": "The regenerative capacity of cardiomyocytes is insufficient to functionally recover damaged tissue, and as such, ischaemic heart disease forms the largest proportion of cardiovascular associated deaths. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have enormous potential for developing patient specific cardiomyocytes for modelling heart disease, patient-based cardiac toxicity testing and potentially replacement therapy. However, traditional protocols for hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes yield mixed populations of atrial, ventricular and nodal-like cells with immature cardiac properties. New insights gleaned from embryonic heart development have progressed the precise production of subtype-specific hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes; however, their physiological immaturity severely limits their utility as model systems and their use for drug screening and cell therapy. The long-entrenched challenges in this field are being addressed by innovative bioengingeering technologies that incorporate biophysical, biochemical and more recently biomimetic electrical cues, with

{"title": "PACAP-38 in Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Humans and Pigs: A Translational Study.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a cardioprotective neuropeptide expressing its receptors in the cardiovascular system. The aim of our study was to examine tissue PACAP-38 in a translational porcine MI model and plasma PACAP-38 levels in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Significantly lower PACAP-38 levels were detected in the non-ischemic region of the left ventricle (LV) in MI heart compared to the ischemic region of MI-LV and also to the Sham-operated LV in porcine MI model. In STEMI patients, plasma PACAP-38 level was significantly higher before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to controls, and decreased after PCI. Significant negative correlation was found between plasma PACAP-38 and troponin levels. Furthermore, a significant effect was revealed between plasma PACAP-38, hypertension and HbA1c levels. This was the first study showing significant changes in cardiac tissue PACAP levels in a porcine MI model and plasma PACAP levels in STEMI patients. These results suggest that PACAP, due to its cardioprotective effects, may play a regulatory role in MI and could be a potential biomarker or drug target in MI.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["DoraSzabo", "ZsoltSarszegi", "BeataPolgar", "EvaSaghy", "AdamNemeth", "DoraReglodi", "AndrasMakkos", "AnikoGorbe", "ZsuzsannaHelyes", "PeterFerdinandy", "RobertHerczeg", "AttilaGyenesei", "AttilaCziraki", "AndreaTamas"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22062883\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018931\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.08.1038\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2017.10.014\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003587\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz933\n10.1111/bph.14931\n10.1038/nprot.2012.075\n10.1016/j.yrtph.2016.03.005\n10.1186/s12967-017-1166-z\n10.14814/phy2.14236\n10.1016/0006-291X(89)91757-9\n10.1124/pr.109.001370\n10.3389/fendo.2020.00377\n10.1152/ajpheart.00662.2010\n10.1016/S0167-0115(02)00193-3\n10.1016/j.regpep.2005.02.012\n10.1196/annals.1317.086\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06958.x\n10.1007/s12031-012-9818-1\n10.1186/s10194-018-0845-3\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05512.x\n10.1007/s12031-014-0296-5\n10.1007/s12031-008-9132-0\n10.1007/s12031-010-9342-0\n10.1002/hep.25802\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.04.037\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1996.tb17531.x\n10.1007/s12031-012-9815-4\n10.1016/j.regpep.2007.09.015\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2008.03635.x\n10.1016/j.npep.2010.10.002\n10.1007/s12031-017-1025-7\n10.1016/j.cca.2014.10.010\n10.1111/ane.12522\n10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2015.03.020\n10.1152/ajpheart.00335.2017\n10.3390/jcm8091488\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.01.001\n10.1093/cvr/cvx049\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.04.029\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.09.069\n10.1136/openhrt-2017-000590\n10.1152/ajpheart.00464.2012\n10.1016/j.resp.2010.05.004\n10.1007/s12031-010-9424-z\n10.2337/diabetes.52.5.1155\n10.1046/j.1365-201X.2002.00977.x\n10.1007/s12031-014-0249-z\n10.1007/s12640-015-9593-1\n10.1177/1479164118757922\n10.37616/2212-5043.1038\n10.7326/0003-4819-134-6-200103200-00009\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.12.004\n10.1161/JAHA.119.015502"}

The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of endurance training on expression of angiogenesis-related genes in cardiac tissue of diabetic rats. Thirty adults male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (N = 10) including diabetic training (DT), sedentary diabetes (SD), and sedentary healthy (SH), in which diabetes was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). Endurance training (ET) with moderate-intensity was performed on a motorized treadmill for six weeks. Training duration and treadmill speed were increased during five weeks, but they were kept constant at the final week, and slope was zero at all stages. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was used to measure the expression of myocyte enhancer factor-2C (MEF2C), histone deacetylase-4 (HDAC4) and Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in cardiac tissues of the rats.

{"title": "A Novel ALDH2 Activator AD-9308 Improves Diastolic and Systolic Myocardial Functions in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mice.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic proportion worldwide. One of the diabetic complications is cardiomyopathy, characterized by early left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, followed by development of systolic dysfunction and ventricular dilation at a late stage. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, and there is no effective treatment yet. In recent years, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a toxic aldehyde generated from lipid peroxidation, is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Its high bioreactivity toward proteins results in cellular damage. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is the major enzyme that detoxifies 4-HNE. The development of small-molecule ALDH2 activator provides an opportunity for treating diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study found that AD-9308, a water-soluble andhighly selective ALDH2 activator, can improve LV diastolic and systolic functions, and wall remodeling in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. AD-9308 treatment dose-dependently lowered serum 4-HNE levels and 4-HNE protein adducts in cardiac tissue from diabetic mice, accompanied with ameliorated myocardial fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis. Improvements of mitochondrial functions, sarco/endoplasmic reticulumcalcium handling and autophagy regulation were also observed in diabetic mice with AD-9308 treatment. In conclusion, ADLH2 activation effectively ameliorated diabetic cardiomyopathy, which may be mediated through detoxification of 4-HNE. Our findings highlighted the therapeutic potential of ALDH2 activation for treating diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["Hsiao-LinLee", "Siow-WeyHee", "Chin-FengHsuan", "WenjinYang", "Jing-YongHuang", "Ya-LingLin", "Chih-NengHsu", "Juey-JenHwang", "Shiau-MeiChen", "Zhi-ZhongDing", "Tung-YuanLee", "Yu-ChiaoLin", "Feng-ChiaoTsai", "Wei-LunSu", "Li-YunChueh", "Meng-LunHsieh", "Che-HongChen", "DariaMochly-Rosen", "Yi-ChengChang", "Lee-MingChuang"], "doi": "10.3390/antiox10030450\n10.1016/j.diabres.2019.107843\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.11.012\n10.1016/0002-9149(74)90089-7\n10.2337/dc17-0697\n10.1016/0002-9149(72)90595-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311586\n10.1016/j.pcad.2019.03.003\n10.1186/s12933-018-0684-1\n10.1038/s41569-020-0339-2\n10.1172/JCI108843\n10.1007/s00125-012-2579-0\n10.1242/dmm.001941\n10.2337/db11-0477\n10.1096/fasebj.27.1_supplement.1128.10\n10.2337/db06-1662\n10.1007/s00125-006-0385-2\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.06.009\n10.2337/diabetes.53.5.1336\n10.1385/CT:5:3:285\n10.1152/ajpheart.1983.245.6.H969\n10.1042/CS20070166\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0707395\n10.3109/10715762.2013.864761\n10.1080/10715762.2020.1866756\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.11.007\n10.1089/ars.2000.2.4-681\n10.1177/1535370213520109\n10.1126/science.1158554\n10.1038/cddis.2017.106\n10.2337/db16-0044\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.09.021\n10.1074/jbc.273.18.10893\n10.2119/molmed.2010.00114\n10.1038/nprot.2012.058\n10.1371/journal.pone.0163158\n10.1186/1741-7015-10-40\n10.1016/0022-2828(81)90318-7\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00010-2\n10.2174/157340308786349426\n10.1111/jpi.12491\n10.1056/NEJMra1215233\n10.3389/fcell.2014.00072\n10.1089/ars.2012.4777\n10.1126/science.aad0116\n10.1016/j.molmed.2007.08.004\n10.1074/jbc.M113.474650\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2014.05.017\n10.1152/physrev.00017.2013\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00012\n10.2337/diabetes.54.6.1615\n10.1379/CSC-270.1\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1454\n10.1038/nrendo.2015.216\n10.3390/ijms17122136\n10.2337/diacare.17.7.633\n10.1155/2016/1390861\n10.3892/mmr.2013.1524\n10.1016/0891-5849(91)90192-6\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00125\n10.14336/AD.2020.0604\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.09.013\n10.1016/j.immuni.2009.07.008\n10.1155/2011/652097\n10.29252/mlj.13.1.15\n10.1126/science.275.5303.1081\n10.4103/ijcpc.ijcpc_1_19\n10.1080/09168451.2020.1815170\n10.1186/1475-2840-10-69\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.045470\n10.1042/BJ20090934\n10.1016/S1071-9164(00)90012-5\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.10.040\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.281.3.H1137\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1051295\n10.4161/auto.7.10.16740\n10.1253/jcj.65.965\n10.2337/db10-0351\n10.1016/j.redox.2013.04.001\n10.1002/mnfr.200500090\n10.1074/jbc.M111.320416\n10.1073/pnas.0903197106"}

{"title": "Disease Modeling and Disease Gene Discovery in Cardiomyopathies: A Molecular Study of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Generated Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "The in vitro modeling of cardiac development and cardiomyopathies in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) provides opportunities to aid the discovery of genetic, molecular, and developmental changes that are causal to, or influence, cardiomyopathies and related diseases. To better understand the functional and disease modeling potential of iPSC-differentiated CMs and to provide a proof of principle for large, epidemiological-scale disease gene discovery approaches into cardiomyopathies, well-characterized CMs, generated from validated iPSCs of 12 individuals who belong to four sibships, and one of whom reported a major adverse cardiac event (MACE), were analyzed by genome-wide mRNA sequencing. The generated CMs expressed CM-specific genes and were highly concordant in their total expressed transcriptome across the 12 samples (correlation coefficient at 95% CI =0.92 \u00b1 0.02). The functional annotation and enrichment analysis of the 2116 genes that were significantly upregulated in CMs suggest that generated CMs have a transcriptomic and functional profile of immature atrial-like CMs; however, the CMs-upregulated transcriptome also showed high overlap and significant enrichment in primary cardiomyocyte (", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["SatishKumar", "Joanne ECurran", "KashishKumar", "EricaDeLeon", "Ana CLeandro", "JuanPeralta", "SarahWilliams-Blangero", "JohnBlangero"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22073311\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.174287\n10.5935/abc.20190144\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300282\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.309345\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310982\n10.1056/NEJMra0902923\n10.1038/nrcardio.2013.105\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv727\n10.1016/S0300-8932(02)76691-8\n10.1001/jama.296.15.1867\n10.1056/NEJMoa052948\n10.1242/dmm.030320\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305365\n10.1161/HCG.0000000000000043\n10.1016/j.vph.2020.106781\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7471-9_2\n10.14440/jbm.2020.296\n10.1155/2016/2349261\n10.1111/jcmm.12554\n10.1016/j.scr.2017.06.015\n10.1038/gt.2014.23\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.07.003\n10.1186/1471-2105-14-128\n10.1093/nar/gkw377\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.11.020\n10.3791/52628\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.07.006\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.099\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1002/stem.166\n10.1186/1471-213X-10-98\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-1033\n10.1073/pnas.0400782101\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)89483-8\n10.1073/pnas.90.11.5157\n10.1002/stem.1703\n10.1161/01.RES.0000261693.13269.bf\n10.1073/pnas.0702447104\n10.1016/S1050-1738(03)00082-3\n10.1242/dev.02777\n10.1152/ajpcell.00402.2009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313472\n10.1113/JP276754\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.10.001\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00050\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.10.001\n10.1203/00006450-200111000-00006\n10.1101/gad.269894.115\n10.1096/fj.14-264093\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.10.032\n10.1038/nrm3115\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.014\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2017.05.018\n10.1093/cvr/cvw259\n10.1093/nar/gkz972\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.958116\n10.1093/cvr/cvv280\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.07.766\n10.1113/JP273123\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf4891\n10.1074/jbc.M109.087429\n10.1074/jbc.M114.575654\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00012.2019\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs442\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005587\n10.1093/hmg/ddl143\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.05.032\n10.1038/jhg.2009.26\n10.1073/pnas.1405411111\n10.1073/pnas.0912585107\n10.1093/cvr/cvs120\n10.1161/01.cir.24.2.458\n10.1101/gad.416007\n10.1242/dev.00797\n10.3390/jcdd4040016\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000039327.11661.16\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.152777\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.019893\n10.1053/euhj.2000.2531\n10.1161/CIRCEP.112.974410\n10.1161/CIRCEP.112.979229\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq278\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt703"}

However, it causes several dose-dependent cardiotoxic results, which has substantially restricted its clinical application. This study was intended to explore the potential ameliorative effect of date palm pollen ethanolic extract (DPPE) against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the mechanisms underlying it. Forty male Wistar albino rats were equally allocated into Control (CTR), DPPE (500 mg/kg bw for 4 weeks), DOX (2.5 mg/kg bw, intraperitoneally six times over 2 weeks), and DPPE + DOX-treated groups. Pre-coadministration of DPPE with DOX partially ameliorated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity as DPPE improved DOX-induced body and heart weight changes and mitigated the elevated cardiac injury markers activities of serum aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase-cardiac type isoenzyme.

{"title": "Differential Methylation in the ", "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a diagnostic challenge in forensic medicine. In a relatively large proportion of the SCDs, the deaths remain unexplained after autopsy. This challenge is likely caused by unknown disease mechanisms. Changes in DNA methylation have been associated with several heart diseases, but the role of DNA methylation in SCD is unknown. In this study, we investigated DNA methylation in two SCD subtypes, sudden unexplained death (SUD) and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We assessed DNA methylation of more than 850,000 positions in cardiac tissue from nine SUD and 14 SUDEP cases using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. In total, six differently methylated regions (DMRs) between the SUD and SUDEP cases were identified. The DMRs were located in proximity to or overlapping genes encoding proteins that are a part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the DNA methylation alterations were not caused by genetic changes, while whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) showed that DNA methylation was associated with expression levels of the ", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["Steffan NoeChristiansen", "Stine B\u00f8ttcherJacobsen", "Jeppe DyrbergAndersen", "Marie-LouiseKampmann", "Linea ChristineTruds\u00f8", "Kristine BoisenOlsen", "JacobTfelt-Hansen", "JytteBanner", "NielsMorling"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22062790\n10.1016/j.tcm.2020.01.003\n10.1161/CIRCEP.114.001854\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq428\n10.1056/NEJMoa1510687\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.001421\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv063\n10.1016/j.carpath.2010.02.003\n10.1038/s41572-020-0188-7\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.02.046\n10.1038/ejhg.2016.118\n10.1007/s00414-018-1775-y\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.027355\n10.1093/cvr/cvw195\n10.1002/emmm.201201553\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.040071\n10.1111/epi.12328\n10.4088/JCP.14m09742\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz891\n10.1111/epi.13604\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60176-1\n10.1016/j.yebeh.2017.08.021\n10.1161/JAHA.119.012264\n10.1016/j.hlc.2019.11.007\n10.3389/fneur.2017.00473\n10.1016/S1474-4422(16)30158-2\n10.1016/j.seizure.2018.12.007\n10.1212/01.wnl.0000335760.02995.ca\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.10.010\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3000289\n10.1002/ana.24596\n10.1038/gim.2017.15\n10.1111/j.1750-3639.2010.00438.x\n10.1007/s00414-015-1269-0\n10.1016/j.seizure.2008.07.008\n10.1038/s41598-019-43282-8\n10.1002/elps.200600589\n10.1373/clinchem.2014.223040\n10.1186/1756-8935-8-6\n10.1016/j.ppedcard.2017.02.005\n10.1038/s41389-017-0025-3\n10.15252/emmm.201707838\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031053\n10.3109/03602532.2010.549134\n10.1016/j.yebeh.2013.09.019\n10.1172/JCI35346\n10.1016/j.seizure.2015.08.010\n10.3390/ijms18112365\n10.3390/ijms20081979\n10.1136/jnnp.60.3.297\n10.1016/S1474-4422(13)70214-X\n10.3389/fneur.2020.00765\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.08.1060\n10.3389/fgene.2014.00324\n10.1038/nrg.2017.86\n10.1186/s13148-017-0333-7\n10.1016/j.ab.2014.09.012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0239850\n10.1186/1756-0500-5-337\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.1101/gr.135350.111\n10.1007/s00414-019-02127-9\n10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btw691\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu049\n10.1186/s13059-015-0679-0\n10.2217/epi.12.21\n10.1186/s13059-018-1597-8\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003118\n10.1038/nature11247"}
{"title": "Macrophage Polarization in Cardiac Tissue Repair Following Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity around the globe, creating a substantial socio-economic burden as a result. Myocardial infarction is a significant contributor to the detrimental impact of cardiovascular disease. The death of cardiomyocytes following myocardial infarction causes an immune response which leads to further destruction of tissue, and subsequently, results in the formation of non-contractile scar tissue. Macrophages have been recognized as important regulators and participants of inflammation and fibrosis following myocardial infarction. Macrophages are generally classified into two distinct groups, namely, classically activated, or M1 macrophages, and alternatively activated, or M2 macrophages. The phenotypic profile of cardiac macrophages, however, is much more diverse and should not be reduced to these two subsets. In this review, we describe the phenotypes and functions of macrophages which are present in the healthy, as well as the infarcted heart, and analyze them with respect to M1 and M2 polarization states. Furthermore, we discuss therapeutic strategies which utilize macrophage polarization towards an anti-inflammatory or reparative phenotype for the treatment of myocardial infarction.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["YevgeniyKim", "SanzharNurakhayev", "AyanNurkesh", "ZharylkasynZharkinbekov", "ArmanSaparov"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22052715\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.10.009\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32203-7\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000652\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005375\n10.1038/s41572-019-0090-3\n10.1152/ajpheart.00597.2018\n10.1007/s00395-018-0712-z\n10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.09.006\n10.1038/s41577-018-0065-8\n10.1016/j.regen.2019.100016\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.599511\n10.1007/s00395-019-0746-x\n10.1007/s00011-017-1060-4\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.10.001\n10.1038/s41590-018-0272-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314028\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.315895\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001625\n10.1016/j.immuni.2019.06.010\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.05.061\n10.18632/aging.101929\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.04.007\n10.1038/s41591-018-0059-x\n10.1002/jcp.26429\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.03.062\n10.1155/2018/8917804\n10.1002/term.2772\n10.3390/cells10010051\n10.1186/s12915-017-0392-4\n10.1152/physrev.00068.2017\n10.1016/j.immuni.2016.02.015\n10.3389/fcell.2020.617879\n10.1186/s12931-018-0891-z\n10.1038/s41379-020-0534-z\n10.1007/s00018-015-1995-y\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.01097\n10.1183/13993003\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.01462\n10.1371/journal.pone.0208602\n10.1002/JLB.3RU1018-378RR\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.00062\n10.1016/j.clim.2019.05.005\n10.3390/ijms19061801\n10.1155/2015/816460\n10.1111/febs.15715\n10.1186/s40364-020-00251-y\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.01084\n10.1146/annurev-pathmechdis-012418-012718\n10.1038/s41598-020-68766-w\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01659\n10.1016/j.jaci.2018.12.995\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.312002\n10.1039/D0SC02792H\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-022516-034339\n10.1016/j.addr.2017.05.010\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2019.02.002\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00528\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.06.019\n10.1016/j.it.2019.07.002\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001601\n10.1093/cvr/cvz336\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00101\n10.1002/JLB.6MR0118-041R\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz159\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.12.072\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.08.2149\n10.3390/ijms20102474\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311071\n10.1007/s00395-020-0781-7\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw002\n10.1152/ajpcell.00330.2020\n10.1007/s00395-018-0686-x\n10.1186/s12929-017-0322-3\n10.2174/1389450118666171031115025\n10.1038/s41598-017-07328-z\n10.1007/s00395-017-0622-5\n10.26355/eurrev_201907_18450\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.05.016\n10.7150/thno.37106\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.041\n10.1089/ars.2015.6577\n10.1089/dna.2019.5067\n10.1155/2020/1412696\n10.7150/thno.31073\n10.1038/s41467-019-12748-8\n10.18632/aging.102959\n10.3390/ijms20040904\n10.1039/C9NR09934D\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.01.001\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.01.035\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00585\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.00680\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023106\n10.1093/cvr/cvy200\n10.7150/thno.47118\n10.7150/thno.32734\n10.1007/BF02786452\n10.7150/thno.42943\n10.3390/ijms22020781\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.12.095\n10.1038/s41374-018-0181-x\n10.1016/j.biocel.2019.105564\n10.1038/emm.2013.135\n10.1172/jci.insight.125437\n10.18632/aging.102009\n10.1093/cvr/cvz040\n10.1111/jcmm.14635\n10.1002/iub.2364"}

To address this, we have developed hybrid hydrogels comprised of decellularized porcine myocardial extracellular matrix (dECM) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to provide a more instructive microenvironment for proper cell and tissue development. A tissue-specific protein profile was preserved post-decellularization, and through the modulation of rGO content and degree of reduction, the mechanical and electrical properties of the hydrogels could be tuned. Engineered heart tissues (EHTs) generated using dECM-rGO hydrogel scaffolds and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes exhibited significantly increased twitch forces and had increased expression of genes that regulate contractile function. Improvements in various aspects of electrophysiological function, such as calcium-handling, action potential duration, and conduction velocity, were also induced by the hybrid biomaterial. dECM-rGO hydrogels could also be used as a bioink to print cardiac tissues in a high-throughput manner, and these tissues were utilized to assess the proarrhythmic potential of cisapride. Action potential prolongation and beat interval irregularities was observed in dECM-rGO tissues at clinical doses of cisapride, indicating that the enhanced electrophysiological function of these tissues corresponded well with a capability to produce physiologically relevant drug responses.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2021-04-03", "authors": ["Jonathan HTsui", "AndreaLeonard", "Nathan DCamp", "Joseph TLong", "Zeid YNawas", "RakchanokChavanachat", "Alec S TSmith", "Jong SeobChoi", "ZhipengDong", "Eun HyunAhn", "AlejandroWolf-Yadlin", "Charles EMurry", "Nathan JSniadecki", "Deok-HoKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120764"}
{"title": "Exosomes from neuronal stem cells may protect the heart from ischaemia/reperfusion injury via JAK1/2 and gp130.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction requires urgent reperfusion to salvage viable heart tissue. However, reperfusion increases infarct size further by promoting mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes. Exosomes from a wide range of different cell sources have been shown to activate cardioprotective pathways in cardiomyocytes, thereby reducing infarct size. Yet, it is currently challenging to obtain highly pure exosomes in quantities enough for clinical studies. To overcome this problem, we used exosomes isolated from CTX0E03 neuronal stem cells, which are genetically stable, conditionally inducible and can be produced on an industrial scale. However, it is unknown whether exosomes from neuronal stem cells may reduce cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion injury. In this study, we demonstrate that exosomes from differentiating CTX0E03 cells can reduce infarct size in mice. In an in vitro assay, these exosomes delayed cardiomyocyte mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, which is responsible for cardiomyocyte death after reperfusion. The mechanism of MPTP inhibition was via gp130 signalling and the downstream JAK/STAT pathway. Our results support previous findings that exosomes from non-cardiomyocyte-related cells produce exosomes capable of protecting cardiomyocytes from myocardial infarction. We anticipate our findings may encourage scientists to use exosomes obtained from reproducible clinical-grade stocks of cells for their ischaemia/reperfusion studies.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2021-04-03", "authors": ["MiroslavaKatsur", "ZhenheHe", "VladimirVinokur", "RandolphCorteling", "Derek MYellon", "Sean MDavidson"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.16515"}
{"title": "Competitive Drivers of Atrial Fibrillation: The Interplay Between Focal Drivers and Multiwavelet Reentry.", "abstract": "There is debate whether human atrial fibrillation is driven by focal drivers or multiwavelet reentry. We propose that the changing activation sequences surrounding a focal driver can at times self-sustain in the absence of that driver. Further, the relationship between focal drivers and surrounding chaotic activation is bidirectional; focal drivers can generate chaotic activation, which may affect the dynamics of focal drivers.\nIn a propagation model, we generated tissues that support structural micro-reentry and moving functional reentrant circuits. We qualitatively assessed (1) the tissue's ability to support self-sustaining fibrillation after elimination of the focal driver, (2) the impact that structural-reentrant substrate has on the duration of fibrillation, the impact that micro-reentrant (3) frequency, (4) excitable gap, and (5) exposure to surrounding fibrillation have on micro-reentry in the setting of chaotic activation, and finally the likelihood fibrillation will end in structural reentry based on (6) the distance between and (7) the relative lengths of an ablated tissue's inner and outer boundaries. We found (1) focal drivers produced chaotic activation when waves encountered heterogeneous refractoriness; chaotic activation could then repeatedly initiate and terminate micro-reentry. Perpetuation of fibrillation following elimination of micro-reentry was predicted by tissue properties. (2) Duration of fibrillation was increased by the presence of a structural micro-reentrant substrate only when surrounding tissue had a low propensity to support self-sustaining chaotic activation. Likelihood of micro-reentry around the structural reentrant substrate increased as (3) the frequency of structural reentry increased relative to the frequency of fibrillation in the surrounding tissue, (4) the excitable gap of micro-reentry increased, and (5) the exposure of the structural circuit to the surrounding tissue decreased. Likelihood of organized tachycardia following termination of fibrillation increased with (6) decreasing distance and (7) disparity of size between focal obstacle and external boundary.\nFocal drivers such as structural micro-reentry and the chaotic activation they produce are continuously interacting with one another. In order to accurately describe cardiac tissue's propensity to support fibrillation, the relative characteristics of both stationary and moving drivers must be taken into account.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-04-03", "authors": ["Richard TCarrick", "Bryce EBenson", "Oliver R JBates", "Peter SSpector"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.633643\n10.1093/cvr/cvz083\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.271809\n10.1161/01.RES.41.1.9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0118746\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.20.2202\n10.7326/0003-4819-122-11-199506010-00010\n10.1152/physrev.1924.4.2.215\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.2.736\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2009.02525.x\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht267\n10.1136/bmj.311.7016.1361\n10.1136/hrt.48.3.193\n10.1016/0002-8703(64)90371-0\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.271031\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2012.02332.x\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00324-3\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2002.00110.x\n10.3389/fphys.2020.572874\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008086\n10.1016/0002-8703(48)90403-7\n10.1016/0002-9149(94)90013-2\n10.1093/europace/eus278\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.961524\n10.1093/europace/euv439\n10.1161/CIRCEP.114.002504\n10.1161/CIRCEP.115.003382"}

Our previous study showed that CMYA1 overexpression impairs the function of gap junction intercellular communication processes. Successful model generation was verified based on PCR, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis. Myocardial CMYA1 expression was confirmed at both the mRNA and the protein levels in the CMYA1-OE transgenic mice. Masson's trichrome staining and electron microscopy revealed myocardial fibrosis and uneven bead width or the interruption of ICDs in the hearts of the CMYA1-OE transgenic mice. Furthermore, the Cx43 protein level was reduced in the CMYA1-OE mice, and co-immunoprecipitation assays of heart tissue protein extracts revealed a physical interaction between CMYA1 and Cx43. Electrocardiogram analysis enabled the detection of an obvious ventricular bigeminy for the CMYA1-OE mice. In summary, analysis of our mouse model indicates that elevated CMYA1 levels may induce myocardial fibrosis, impair ICDs, and downregulate the expression of Cx43.

Colonizing environments with lower winter temperatures can lead to the evolution of lower critical thermal minima; the corresponding physiological traits associated with temperature tolerance are predicted to involve mitochondrial function. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have colonized freshwater lakes along the Pacific Northwest. These freshwater populations are known to exhibit cold-induced increases in mitochondrial volume density in pectoral muscle, but whether such plasticity evolved before or after colonization is uncertain. Here, we measure critical thermal minima (CTmin) in one marine and one freshwater population of threespine stickleback, and mitochondrial volume density in pectoral and cardiac tissue of both populations acclimated to different temperature treatments (6.2, 14.5 and 20.6\u00a0\u2103). Mitochondrial volume density increased with cold acclimation in pectoral muscle; cardiac muscle was non-plastic but had elevated mitochondrial volume densities compared to pectoral muscle across all temperature treatments. There were no differences in the levels of plasticity between marine and freshwater stickleback, but neither were there differences in CTmin.

Formulation was optimized using quality by design (QbD)-based approach. Three factors i.e., total lipid concentration (%), homogenization pressure (bar), and number of cycles were optimized through Box-Behnken design to estimate their effect on critical quality attributes (CQAs) viz., size (nm), % entrapment efficiency, and in vitro % drug release which were found to be 80.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7\u00a0nm, 83.51\u2009\u00b1\u20092.15%, and 83.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.86% after 24\u00a0h, respectively. In vivo pharmacokinetic study indicated 4.207 and 1.907 times increase in the oral bioavailability of optimized nanostructured lipid carrier without and with cycloheximide (lymphatic transport inhibitor), respectively. Treatment with ISO (isoproterenol) significantly diverges the levels of antioxidant marker, TBARS (thiobarbituric acid), and ultrastructure of the cardiac tissue indicating significant myocardial damage. Pretreatment of nanostructured lipid carrier of isradipine (ISD-NLCs) significantly prevented the antioxidant status and ultrastructural changes in the heart.

{"title": "Passive mechanical properties in healthy and infarcted rat left ventricle characterised via a mixture model.", "abstract": "During the cardiac cycle, electrical excitation is coupled with mechanical response of the myocardium. Besides the active contraction, passive mechanics plays an important role, and its behaviour differs in healthy and diseased hearts as well as among different animal species. The aim of this study is the characterisation of passive mechanical properties in healthy and infarcted rat myocardium by means of mechanical testing and subsequent parameter fitting. Elasticity assessments via uniaxial extension tests are performed on healthy and infarcted tissue samples from left ventricular rat myocardium. In order to fully characterise the orthotropic cardiac tissue, our experimental data are combined with other previously published tests in rats - shear tests on healthy myocardium and equibiaxial tests on infarcted tissue. In a first step, we calibrate the Holzapfel-Ogden strain energy function in the healthy case. Sa far, this orthotropic constitutive law for the passive myocardium has been fitted to experimental data in several species, however there is a lack of an appropriate parameter set for the rat. With our determined parameters, a finite element simulation of the end-diastolic filling is performed. In a second step, we propose a model for the infarcted tissue. It is represented as a mixture of intact myocardium and a transversely isotropic scar structure. In our mechanical experiments, the tissue after myocardial infarction shows significantly stiffer behaviour than in the healthy case, and the stiffness correlates with the amount of fibrosis. A similar relationship is observed in the computational simulation of the end-diastolic filling. We conclude that our new proposed material model can capture the behaviour of two kinds of tissues - healthy and infarcted rat myocardium, and its calibration with the fitted parameters represents the experimental data well.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2021-03-30", "authors": ["DenisaMartonov\u00e1", "MuhannadAlkassar", "JuliaSeufert", "DavidHolz", "Minh Tu\u1ea5nD\u01b0\u01a1ng", "BarbaraReischl", "OliverFriedrich", "SigridLeyendecker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104430"}

In the area of cardiac tissue models, several sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) approaches use induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to mimic physiological relevance and native tissue environment with a combination of extracellular matrices and crosslinkers. However, these systems are complex to fabricate without microfabrication expertise and require several weeks to self-assemble. Most importantly, many of these systems lack vascular cells and cardiac fibroblasts that make up over 60% of the nonmyocytes in the human heart. Here we describe the derivation of all three cardiac cell types from iPSCs to fabricate cardiac microtissues. This facile replica molding technique allows cardiac microtissue culture in standard multi-well cell culture plates for several weeks. The platform allows user-defined control over microtissue sizes based on initial seeding density and requires less than 3 days for self-assembly to achieve observable cardiac microtissue contractions. Furthermore, the cardiac microtissues can be easily digested while maintaining high cell viability for single-cell interrogation with the use of flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We envision that this in vitro model of cardiac microtissues will help accelerate validation studies in drug discovery and disease modeling.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2021-03-30", "authors": ["DilipThomas", "HyeonyuKim", "NicoleLopez", "Joseph CWu"], "doi": "10.3791/61879"}

Scaffold design based on blends of proteins and polysaccharides, as mimicry of the native extracellular matrix, has recently become a valuable strategy for tissue engineering.\nThis study aimed to construct composite hydrogels based on natural polymers for tissue engineering.\nComposite hydrogels based on blends of gelatin with a polysaccharide component (chitosan or alginate) were produced and subsequently enzyme crosslinked. The other three hydrogels, chitosan hydrogel, sodium alginate hydrogel, and microbial transglutaminase-crosslinked gelatin (mTG/GA) hydrogel were also prepared. All hydrogels were evaluated for in vitro degradation property, swelling capacity, and mechanical property. Rat adipose-derived stromal stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated and seeded on (or embedded into) the above-mentioned hydrogels. The morphological features of ADSCs were observed and recorded. The effects of the hydrogels on ADSC survival and adhesion were investigated by immunofluorescence staining. Cell proliferation was tested by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.\nCell viability assay results showed that the five hydrogels are not cytotoxic. The mTG/GA and its composite hydrogels showed higher compressive moduli than the single-component chitosan and alginate hydrogels. MTT assay results showed that ADSCs proliferated better on the composite hydrogels than on the chitosan and alginate hydrogels. Light microscope observation and cell cytoskeleton staining showed that hydrogel strength had obvious effects on cell growth and adhesion. The ADSCs seeded on chitosan and alginate hydrogels plunged into the hydrogels and could not stretch out due to the low strength of the hydrogel, whereas cells seeded on composite hydrogels with higher elastic modulus, could spread out, and grew in size.\nThe gelatin-polysaccharide composite hydrogels could serve as attractive biomaterials for tissue engineering due to their easy preparation and favorable biophysical properties.", "journal": "PeerJ", "date": "2021-03-30", "authors": ["JingYe", "GangYang", "JingZhang", "ZhenghuaXiao", "LingHe", "HanZhang", "QiLiu"], "doi": "10.7717/peerj.11022\n10.1002/btm2.10124\n10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00360\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.024\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.048\n10.1038/nmeth.3839\n10.1007/s10047-013-0734-0\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00414\n10.1016/s0142-9612(00)00183-6\n10.1016/s0142-9612(00)00116-2\n10.1002/mabi.201300472\n10.3390/polym12020266\n10.1016/j.micres.2018.06.001\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2006.04.017\n10.1093/rb/rbz050\n10.1002/mrc.5009\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.115514\n10.1088/1748-6041/9/3/035008\n10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00003-6\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.06.003\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.11.051\n10.1002/advs.201700527\n10.1161/01.cir.100.suppl_2.ii-63\n10.1038/ncomms3029\n10.7717/peerj.3665\n10.1002/marc.201400267\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.005\n10.1021/acsabm.8b00390\n10.1016/j.archoralbio.2010.08.018\n10.5301/ijao.2011.6397\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.115035\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab331e\n10.1002/jbm.a.32216\n10.1007/s10856-019-6327-6\n10.1002/jbm.a.36272\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.026\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.119\n10.3390/gels4030067\n10.1039/c8bm01348a\n10.1007/s10856-010-4131-4\n10.1155/2014/926157\n10.3390/ma6041285\n10.1517/17425247.2014.867326\n10.4330/wjc.v7.i8.454\n10.1081/ddc-120003853\n10.1021/acsami.9b01872\n10.1007/s11671-009-9355-1\n10.1088/1758-5082/1/3/035001\n10.1177/0883911505053658\n10.7717/peerj.2497\n10.3390/nano10081511\n10.1021/acs.biomac.9b00043\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.09.094"}

{"title": "Interplay Between Systemic Metabolic Cues and Autonomic Output: Connecting Cardiometabolic Function and Parasympathetic Circuits.", "abstract": "There is consensus that the heart is innervated by both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. However, the role of the parasympathetic nervous system in controlling cardiac function has received significantly less attention than the sympathetic nervous system. New neuromodulatory strategies have renewed interest in the potential of parasympathetic (or vagal) motor output to treat cardiovascular disease and poor cardiac function. This renewed interest emphasizes a critical need to better understand how vagal motor output is generated and regulated. With clear clinical links between cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, addressing this gap in knowledge is undeniably critical to our understanding of the interaction between metabolic cues and vagal motor output, notwithstanding the classical role of the parasympathetic nervous system in regulating gastrointestinal function and energy homeostasis. For this reason, this review focuses on the central, vagal circuits involved in sensing metabolic state(s) and enacting vagal motor output to influence cardiac function. It will review our current understanding of brainstem vagal circuits and their unique position to integrate metabolic signaling into cardiac activity. This will include an overview of not only how metabolic cues alter vagal brainstem circuits, but also how vagal motor output might influence overall systemic concentrations of metabolic cues known to act on the cardiac tissue. Overall, this review proposes that the vagal brainstem circuits provide an integrative network capable of regulating and responding to metabolic cues to control cardiac function.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-03-30", "authors": ["LilianaEspinoza", "StephanieFedorchak", "Carie RBoychuk"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.624595\n10.1016/j.autneu.2012.12.002\n10.1210/endo-118-4-1551\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00867\n10.1210/en.2003-0143\n10.1113/expphysiol.2007.041178\n10.1016/j.molmet.2017.08.010\n10.1210/en.2018-00004\n10.1113/jphysiol.2005.098822\n10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01523.x\n10.1523/jneurosci.2212-10.2011\n10.1001/jama.1994.03510350050036\n10.1126/science.3014662\n10.1161/hypertensionaha.113.01743\n10.1007/s00125-002-0821-x\n10.1152/jn.00310.2015\n10.1152/jn.00209.2015\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.249268\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.0521t.x\n10.1016/j.autneu.2010.11.001\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00032\n10.1007/s11897-015-0263-7\n10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007548\n10.1161/01.hyp.0000224147.01024.77\n10.1007/s11906-003-0085-y\n10.14814/phy2.12811\n10.1097/mog.0b013e3283639326\n10.1002/1096-9861(20000904)424:4<588::aid-cne3>3.0.co;2-7\n10.1016/0026-0495(71)90010-2\n10.1016/j.it.2016.06.006\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.07.007\n10.1523/jneurosci.3187-10.2011\n10.1056/nejm196205172662001\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.02.040\n10.1016/j.resp.2010.05.005\n10.1002/jcp.25176\n10.1016/s0165-1838(98)00048-4\n10.1161/01.hyp.35.4.1009\n10.1161/01.hyp.37.2.554\n10.1016/j.molmet.2017.01.010\n10.1210/endo.142.2.7983\n10.7326/0003-4819-92-2-308\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.t01-1-00141.x\n10.1111/j.1520-037x.2002.01231.x\n10.1016/j.autneu.2017.03.005\n10.1007/s00592-011-0319-4\n10.1016/j.brainres.2009.07.024\n10.1161/01.res.46.5.606\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.04.003\n10.1016/j.tem.2005.02.003\n10.1126/science.1252304\n10.1113/jphysiol.1984.sp015453\n10.4330/wjc.v7.i4.204\n10.1093/cvr/cvq271\n10.14814/phy2.12609\n10.1210/en.2007-1743\n10.1016/j.molmet.2018.08.011\n10.1046/j.1464-5491.2002.00658.x\n10.1507/endocrj.ej18-0372\n10.1210/endo-112-3-904\n10.1152/jappl.1998.84.4.1234\n10.1002/(sici)1096-9861(19990118)403:3<359::aid-cne6>3.0.co;2-z\n10.1210/en.2016-1826\n10.1097/crd.0b013e3181ebb152\n10.1152/jappl.1975.39.5.801\n10.1161/01.cir.92.8.2291\n10.1073/pnas.2008213117\n10.1016/s0140-6736(97)11144-8\n10.1016/j.cmet.2014.02.003\n10.1139/y99-067\n10.1073/pnas.1409638111\n10.1161/01.cir.42.5.935\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.00547.x\n10.1016/j.autneu.2006.10.001\n10.1056/nejm197605202942107\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.06.005\n10.1210/me.2015-1201\n10.1016/0006-8993(95)00227-h\n10.1093/cvr/cvs212\n10.1038/s41593-020-0684-9\n10.1016/s0165-1838(96)00074-4\n10.1111/nmo.13150\n10.14814/phy2.12718\n10.1161/circheartfailure.112.966705\n10.1161/01.res.0000152968.71868.c3\n10.1016/0002-9343(73)90083-1\n10.1210/er.2007-0006\n10.1016/j.brainres.2011.04.015\n10.1161/01.cir.98.15.1510\n10.1056/nejm196807042790103\n10.1172/jci119015\n10.1038/nrendo.2012.189\n10.1046/j.1440-1681.1999.03103.x\n10.1210/en.2013-1934\n10.1111/jne.12161\n10.1172/jci58644\n10.1016/s0140-6736(18)31506-x\n10.1128/mcb.00426-14\n10.1016/s0006-8993(99)02327-6\n10.1210/endo.140.4.6643\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.05.008\n10.1097/00001756-200112040-00023\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1975.229.3.783\n10.1161/01.cir.69.4.790\n10.4103/0253-7613.93579\n10.1126/science.8284675\n10.1242/jeb.086199\n10.1016/j.biopsycho.2005.11.013\n10.1111/dom.12346\n10.1016/j.jmb.2019.08.009\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.03.043\n10.1172/jci60016\n10.1210/er.2011-1052\n10.1161/01.res.68.5.1471\n10.1111/jdi.12042\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.2010.03184.x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.097\n10.1016/s0531-5565(97)00054-5\n10.1046/j.1440-1681.2003.t01-1-03808.x\n10.1210/jc.2006-2175\n10.1111/j.1474-8673.1995.tb00402.x\n10.1139/y93-024\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2009.07.006\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu345\n10.1161/circheartfailure.112.000228\n10.1186/1475-2840-12-90\n10.1523/jneurosci.2081-11.2011"}

Cases were identified based on histopathologic analysis of cardiac tissue, repeat positive mycobacterial blood cultures, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Clinical ocular findings, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and autopsy results are described.\nThe mean age of our patients was 63 years (range, 22-76 years). Aortic graft and/or valvular surgeries were performed between June 2015 and April 2016. The mean duration from surgery to diagnosis of infection was 27 months (range, 19-36 months). All patients exhibited white-yellowish choroidal lesions. Bilateral, multifocal choroiditis was observed in 6 patients (12 eyes), who died of disseminated M. chimaera infection despite aggressive, multiagent antimicrobial therapy. One patient had a solitary, white-yellow choroidal lesion in the left eye only. Choroidal lesions were hyperfluorescent on late-phase fluorescein angiography and corresponded to localized choroidal thickening and retinal elevation on SD-OCT.\nM. chimaera infection after cardiothoracic surgery can cause life-threatening disease involving multiple organ systems.

{"title": "Heart organoids and tissue models for modeling development and disease.", "abstract": "Organoids, or miniaturized organs formed in vitro, hold potential to revolutionize how researchers approach and answer fundamental biological and pathological questions. In the context of cardiac biology, development of a bona fide cardiac organoid enables study of heart development, function, and pathogenesis in a dish, providing insight into the nature of congenital heart disease and offering the opportunity for high-throughput probing of adult heart disease and drug discovery. Recently, multiple groups have reported novel methods for generating in vitro models of the heart; however, there are substantial conceptual and methodological differences. In this review we will evaluate recent cardiac organoid studies through the lens of the core principles of organoid technology: patterned self-organization of multiple cell types resembling the in vivo organ. Based on this, we will classify systems into the following related types of tissues: developmental cardiac organoids, chamber cardiac organoids, microtissues, and engineered heart tissues. Furthermore, we highlight the interventions which allow for organoid formation, such as modulation of highly conserved cardiogenic signaling pathways mediated by developmental morphogens. We expect that consolidation and categorization of existing organoid models will help eliminate confusion in the field and facilitate progress towards creation of an ideal cardiac organoid.", "journal": "Seminars in cell & developmental biology", "date": "2021-03-30", "authors": ["MatthewMiyamoto", "LucyNam", "SurajKannan", "ChulanKwon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.03.011\n10.1038/s41576-018-0051-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.082\n10.1038/s41563-020-00829-9\n10.1242/dev.166074\n10.1083/jcb.201610056\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.036\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.034\n10.1038/nature12517\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.032\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.005\n10.1038/nature07935\n10.1038/nature09691\n10.1038/s41586-020-2724-8\n10.1038/s41563-020-00803-5\n10.1038/s41551-020-0565-2\n10.1038/nature09941\n10.1038/nature06801\n10.1038/s41569-018-0086-9\n10.1038/nrg1710\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.302832\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309040\n10.1038/s41467-018-05604-8\n10.1101/2020.07.12.198994\n10.1113/JP276754\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1007/s00246-019-02165-5\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.10.032\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001\n10.1038/35082103\n10.1101/gad.13.12.1575\n10.1242/dev.02523\n10.1038/nrm2618\n10.1007/s11886-021-01468-5\n10.7554/eLife.03848\n10.1038/ncb3024\n10.1126/science.aao4174\n10.4161/cc.7.24.7189\n10.1172/JCI31731\n10.1016/j.stem.2007.05.018\n10.1128/MCB.01539-09\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.11.015\n10.1242/dev.069377\n10.1101/2021.01.31.428968\n10.1073/pnas.1121236109\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.042\n10.1126/science.aaa6071\n10.1002/dvdy.21743\n10.1038/s41569-018-0100-2\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.06.040\n10.1038/ncb1906\n10.1038/ncb2313\n10.1073/pnas.0438008100\n10.1242/dev.185249\n10.7554/eLife.02164\n10.1242/dev.093690\n10.1515/bmc-2015-0003\n10.1073/pnas.1904684116\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.054\n10.7554/eLife.30668\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.194464\n10.1242/dev.001883\n10.1038/nature03215\n10.1242/dev.162776\n10.1203/01.PDR.0000148710.69159.61\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.11.008\n10.1016/j.aanat.2009.06.004\n10.1101/cshperspect.a015750\n10.1002/dvg.23300\n10.1152/physrev.00006.2003\n10.1038/s41586-018-0110-6\n10.1038/s41569-018-0046-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315857\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01088.x\n10.3390/jcdd6010003\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.04.002\n10.1242/dev.093385\n10.1101/cshperspect.a037192\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00060.2004\n10.1038/nature07060\n10.1152/physrev.00017.2002\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00165\n10.1007/s00246-010-9642-8\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.305350\n10.1002/bit.26504\n10.1016/j.scr.2015.08.002\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs349\n10.1038/nprot.2015.089\n10.1126/science.1177350\n10.1111/j.1432-0436.1991.tb00255.x\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.12.008\n10.1038/nature06894\n10.3791/59826\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1038/s41586-018-0578-0\n10.1101/2020.04.30.071472\n10.1101/2020.04.02.022632\n10.1038/s41586-020-2383-9\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.1101/2020.06.25.171611\n10.1101/2020.07.06.189431\n10.1038/s41467-020-18031-5\n10.1038/ncomms8413\n10.1038/ng0398-266\n10.1242/dev.01562\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.02.023\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.07.021\n10.1242/dev.143438\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.05.004\n10.1101/2020.07.06.190504\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1242/dev.143966\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.03.009\n10.1038/s41578-021-00279-y"}
{"title": "Astragaloside IV-targeting miRNA-1 attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac dysfunction in rats through inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy.", "abstract": "Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), the major active constituent purified from Astragalus membranaceus, was previously reported to have protective effects against cardiac dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of AS-IV on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac dysfunction and explored the potential mechanism by focusing on miRNA-1 (miR-1) at the animal and cellular levels. A series of methods were used, including echocardiography, flow cytometry, ELISA, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, RT-PCR, and western blotting. The results showed that both AS-IV and the miR-1 inhibitor improved cardiac dysfunction, reduced heart injury, inhibited apoptosis and autophagy, and regulated the expression of calcium- and mitochondrial energy metabolism-related proteins in the heart tissue of rats treated with LPS. Importantly, AS-IV downregulated the expression of miR-1 mRNA in heart tissue. All effects of AS-IV were at least partly abolished by miR-1 mimics. In the in vitro study, both AS-IV and the miR-1 inhibitor inhibited apoptosis and autophagy and regulated the expression of calcium- and mitochondrial energy metabolism-related proteins in heart cells treated with LPS. Similarly, AS-IV downregulated the expression of miR-1 mRNA in heart cells. All effects of AS-IV on cells were at least partly abolished by miR-1 mimics. Furthermore, miR-1 mimics exhibited effects similar to LPS both in animal and cellular studies. Taken together, these results suggest that AS-IV protects against LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction by inhibiting calcium-mediated apoptosis and autophagy by targeting miR-1, highlighting a new mechanism for the therapeutic effect of AS-IV on cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2021-03-29", "authors": ["QiuningWang", "XuefengYang", "YingSong", "XiaoweiSun", "WentaoLi", "LingZhang", "XuelingHu", "HongWang", "NanZhao", "RumingZhuang", "XinlingXie", "FutianTang", "HongxinWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119414"}

{"title": "An Overview of FGF-23 as a Novel Candidate Biomarker of Cardiovascular Risk.", "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF)-23 is a phosphaturic hormone involved in mineral bone metabolism that helps control phosphate homeostasis and reduces 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis. Recent data have highlighted the relevant direct FGF-23 effects on the myocardium, and high plasma levels of FGF-23 have been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in humans, such as heart failure and arrhythmias. Therefore, FGF-23 has emerged as a novel biomarker of cardiovascular risk in the last decade. Indeed, experimental data suggest FGF-23 as a direct mediator of cardiac hypertrophy development, cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction via specific myocardial FGF receptor (FGFR) activation. Therefore, the FGF-23/FGFR pathway might be a suitable therapeutic target for reducing the deleterious effects of FGF-23 on the cardiovascular system. More research is needed to fully understand the intracellular FGF-23-dependent mechanisms, clarify the downstream pathways and identify which could be the most appropriate targets for better therapeutic intervention. This review updates the current knowledge on both clinical and experimental studies and highlights the evidence linking FGF-23 to cardiovascular events.

{"title": "Interleukin-6 ablation does not alter morphofunctional heart characteristics but modulates physiological and inflammatory markers after strenuous exercise.", "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is associated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy and can be dramatically increased in serum after an acute strenuous exercise session. However, IL-6 is also associated with the increased production and release of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) after chronic moderate exercise. To elucidate the relevance of IL-6 in inflammatory and hypertrophic signaling in the heart in response to an acute strenuous exercise session, we combined transcriptome analysis using the BXD mice database and exercised IL-6 knockout mice (IL-6KO). Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that low or high-levels of Il6 mRNA in the heart did not change the inflammation- and hypertrophy-related genes in BXD mice strains. On the other hand, bioinformatic analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between Il6 gene expression in skeletal muscle with inflammation-related genes in cardiac tissue in several BXD mouse strains, suggesting that skeletal muscle-derived IL-6 could alter the heart's intracellular signals, particularly the inflammatory signaling. As expected, an acute strenuous exercise session increased IL-6 levels in wild-type, but not in IL-6KO mice. Despite not showing morphofunctional differences in the heart at rest, the IL-6KO group presented a reduction in physical performance and attenuated IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1beta kinetics in serum, as well as lower p38MAPK phosphorylation, Ampkalpha expression, and higher Acta1 and Tnf gene expressions in the left ventricle in the basal condition. In response to strenuous exercise, IL-6 ablation was linked to a reduction in the pro-inflammatory response and higher activation of classical physiological cardiac hypertrophy proteins.", "journal": "Cytokine", "date": "2021-03-26", "authors": ["Alisson Lda Rocha", "Rafael LRovina", "Ana PPinto", "Bruno BMarafon", "Lilian E C Mda Silva", "Fernando MSimabuco", "Fabiani GFrantz", "Jos\u00e9 RPauli", "Leandro Pde Moura", "Dennys ECintra", "Eduardo RRopelle", "Hugo TFilho", "Ellen Cde Freitas", "Donato ARivas", "Adelino S Rda Silva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155494"}

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic and molecular alterations related to hypoxia in the myocardium of broiler chickens with SDS. Samples from the cardiac muscle of internal control broiler chickens (ICs) (n = 36) and chickens having died of SDS (n = 36) were obtained during the rearing period. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and the concentration of lactate were measured in the cardiac tissue using available commercial kits. The expression of hypoxia-inducing factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDHK4) and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) genes was determined in the myocardium by real-time PCR analysis. The results showed the elevation of lactate level and activities of LDH and CPK in the cardiac muscle of SDS-affected chickens compared with the IC birds (P < 0.05). The cardiac muscle expression of HIF1\u03b1, MCT4 and GLUT1 genes was increased, while the PDHK4 mRNA level was decreased in the SDS-affected group compared to those in the IC chickens (P < 0.05).

{"title": "Cardiac mitofusin-1 is reduced in non-responding patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Prognosis of severe heart failure remains poor. Urgent new therapies are required. Some heart failure patients do not respond to established multidisciplinary treatment and are classified as \"non-responders\". The outcome is especially poor for non-responders, and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Mitofusin-1 (Mfn1), a mitochondrial fusion protein, is significantly reduced in non-responding patients. This study aimed to elucidate the role of Mfn1 in the failing heart. Twenty-two idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy of intraventricular septum were included. Of the 22 patients, 8 were non-responders (left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) of\u2009<\u200910% improvement at late phase follow-up). Electron microscopy (EM), quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence studies were performed to explore the biological processes and molecules involved in failure to respond. Studies in cardiac specific Mfn1 knockout mice (c-Mfn1 KO), and in vitro studies with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were also conducted. A significant reduction in mitochondrial size in cardiomyocytes, and Mfn1, was observed in non-responders. A LV pressure overload with thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) c-Mfn1 KO mouse model was generated. Systolic function was reduced in c-Mfn1 KO mice, while mitochondria alteration in TAC c-Mfn1 KO mice increased. In vitro studies in NRVMs indicated negative regulation of Mfn1 by the \u03b2-AR/cAMP/PKA/miR-140-5p pathway resulting in significant reduction in mitochondrial respiration of NRVMs. The level of miR140-5p was increased in cardiac tissues of non-responders.

However, the underlying mechanism remains obscure. This study was intended to explore the potential mechanism by which 6-G functions. Q-PCR was employed to quantify the relative RNA levels of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 (H19), miR-143, and ATG7, an enzyme essential for autophagy, in HL-1 cells. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were employed for protein evaluation in cultured cells or mouse tissues. Cell viability, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis were analysed by CCK-8, LDH, and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The binding sites for miR-143 were predicted using starBase software and experimentally validated through a dual-luciferase reporter system. Here, we found that 6-G elevated cellular H19 expression in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated HL-1 cells. Moreover, 6-G increased Bcl-2 expression but reduced cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9 protein levels. Mechanistically, H19 directly interacted with miR-143 and lowered its cellular abundance by acting as a molecular sponge. Importantly, ATG7 was validated as a regulated gene of miR-143, and the depletion of miR-143 by H19 caused an increased in ATG7 expression, which in turn promoted the autophagy process. Last, mouse experiments highly supported our in vitro findings that 6-G relieves MIRI by enhancing autophagy. The H19/miR-143/ATG7 axis was shown to be critical for the function of 6-G in relieving MIRI.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2021-03-25", "authors": ["Xiang-WeiLv", "Meng-JieWang", "Qiu-YuQin", "PanLu", "Guo-WeiQin"], "doi": "10.1038/s41374-021-00575-9\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.07.054\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12113-7\n10.1155/2017/7018393\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.05.113\n10.1186/s11658-019-0186-5\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.028\n10.21037/atm.2019.09.66\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.005\n10.1111/jcmm.13754\n10.1038/ncb2521\n10.1038/nature12943\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.05.031\n10.1016/j.molimm.2018.11.011\n10.1007/s12012-018-9452-4\n10.1155/2020/8405370\n10.1038/s41418-018-0206-4\n10.1007/s11626-016-0039-8\n10.1159/000455953\n10.1159/000485354\n10.1089/dna.2017.3799"}

Cardiac tissue engineering strategies focusing on biomaterial scaffolds incorporating cells and growth factors are emerging as highly promising for cardiac repair and regeneration. The use of stem cells within cardiac microengineered tissue constructs present an inherent ability to differentiate into cell types of the human heart. Stem cells derived from various tissues including bone marrow, dental pulp, adipose tissue and umbilical cord can be used for this purpose. Approaches ranging from stem cell injections, stem cell spheroids, cell encapsulation in a suitable hydrogel, use of prefabricated scaffold and bioprinting technology are at the forefront in the field of cardiac tissue engineering. The stem cell microenvironment plays a key role in the maintenance of stemness and/or differentiation into cardiac specific lineages.

However, the detailed knowledge about molecular mechanisms underlying this protection has not been completely investigated yet. This study was designed to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which nesfatin-1 exert cardioprotection effects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R). Left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated for 30\u00a0min to create a MI/R model in rats. MI/R rats were treated with three concentrations of nesfatin-1 (10, 15 and 20\u00a0\u00b5g/kg) then expression of necroptosis and necrosis mediators were measured by western blotting assay. Fibrosis, morphological damages, cardiac function, myocardial injury indictors and oxidative stress factors were evaluated as well. Induction of MI/R model resulted in cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress, increased activity of RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL axis and RhoA/ROCK pathway, extension of fibrosis and heart tissue damage. Highest tested concentration of nesfatin-1 markedly improved cardiac function. Moreover, it reduced oxidative stress, collagen deposition, and morphological damages, through inhibiting the expression of necroptosis mediators and also, necrosis including RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, ROCK1, and ROCK2 proteins. The lowest and middle tested concentrations of nesfatin-1 failed to exert protective effects against MI/R. These findings have shown that nesfatin-1 can exert cardioprotection against MI/R in a dose dependent manner by suppressing necroptosis via modulation of RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL axis and RhoA/ROCK/RIP3 signaling pathway.", "journal": "Molecular biology reports", "date": "2021-03-24", "authors": ["MasoomehSharifi", "DonyaNazarinia", "FatemehRamezani", "YaserAzizi", "NasimNaderi", "NahidAboutaleb"], "doi": "10.1007/s11033-021-06289-x"}

Challenges include imaging, defining an objective threshold for classifying fibrosis as mild or severe, and understanding the molecular basis for these changes.\nTo develop a novel, rapid, label-free approach to accurately measure and quantify the extent of fibrosis in cardiac tissue using infrared spectroscopic imaging.\nWe performed infrared spectroscopic imaging and combined that with advanced machine learning-based algorithms to assess fibrosis in 15 samples from patients belonging to the following 3 classes: (1) patients with nonpathologic (control) donor hearts, (2) patients undergoing transplant, and (3) patients undergoing implantation of a ventricular assist device.\nOur results show excellent sensitivity and accuracy for detecting myocardial fibrosis, as demonstrated by a high area under the curve of 0.998 in the receiver operating characteristic curve measured from infrared imaging. Fibrosis of various morphologic subtypes were demonstrated with virtually generated picrosirius red images, which showed good visual and quantitative agreement (correlation coefficient = 0.92, \u03c1 = 7.76 \u00d7 10-15) with stained images of the same sections. Underlying molecular composition of the different subtypes was investigated with infrared spectra showing reproducible differences presumably arising from differences in collagen subtypes and/or crosslinking.\nInfrared imaging can be a powerful tool in studying myocardial fibrosis and gleaning insights into the underlying chemical changes that accompany it.

{"title": "Robust data assimilation with noise: Applications to cardiac dynamics.", "abstract": "Reconstructions of excitation patterns in cardiac tissue must contend with uncertainties due to model error, observation error, and hidden state variables. The accuracy of these state reconstructions may be improved by efforts to account for each of these sources of uncertainty, in particular, through the incorporation of uncertainty in model specification and model dynamics. To this end, we introduce stochastic modeling methods in the context of ensemble-based data assimilation and state reconstruction for cardiac dynamics in one- and three-dimensional cardiac systems. We propose two classes of methods, one following the canonical stochastic differential equation formalism, and another perturbing the ensemble evolution in the parameter space of the model, which are further characterized according to the details of the models used in the ensemble. The stochastic methods are applied to a simple model of cardiac dynamics with fast-slow time-scale separation, which permits tuning the form of effective stochastic assimilation schemes based on a similar separation of dynamical time scales. We find that the selection of slow or fast time scales in the formulation of stochastic forcing terms can be understood analogously to existing ensemble inflation techniques for accounting for finite-size effects in ensemble Kalman filter methods; however, like existing inflation methods, care must be taken in choosing relevant parameters to avoid over-driving the data assimilation process. In particular, we find that a combination of stochastic processes-analogously to the combination of additive and multiplicative inflation methods-yields improvements to the assimilation error and ensemble spread over these classical methods.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2021-03-24", "authors": ["Christopher DMarcotte", "Flavio HFenton", "Matthew JHoffman", "Elizabeth MCherry"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0033539\n10.1063/1.4940238\n10.1063/1.4999603\n10.1098/rsta.2019.0388\n10.1016/0167-2789(88)90080-2\n10.1088/1367-2630/10/12/125016\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.038303\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00071\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.000334\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005060\n10.1016/j.physleta.2014.01.027\n10.1063/1.3613921\n10.1002/qj.2982\n10.1016/j.physd.2006.11.008\n10.4249/scholarpedia.1868\n10.1109/TAC.1969.1099223\n10.1146/annurev.fl.10.010178.000543\n10.1175/1520-0493(1999)127<2533:ECOADM>2.0.CO;2\n10.1175/MWR3289.1\n10.1175/2007JAS2419.1\n10.1175/1520-0493(1994)122<1281:REGING>2.0.CO;2\n10.1002/qj.762\n10.1088/1674-1056/23/8/089201\n10.1175/1520-0493(1999)127<2741:AMCIOT>2.0.CO;2\n10.1175/1520-0493(2000)128<0416:AAEKF>2.0.CO;2\n10.1175/2008MWR2737.1\n10.1175/2009MWR2766.1\n10.3402/tellusa.v21i6.10143\n10.1002/qj.49712556006\n10.1002/qj.3570\n10.1175/1520-0493(1996)124<1225:ASSATE>2.0.CO;2\n10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013<4196:MEFFWA>2.0.CO;2\n10.3402/tellusa.v57i3.14657\n10.1038/nature03301\n10.1256/smsqj.57201\n10.1002/qj.464\n10.1186/s13408-018-0066-8\n10.1063/1.166311\n10.1175/1520-0493(1981)109<0701:AGTDMS>2.0.CO;2\n10.3402/tellusa.v38i2.11706\n10.1115/1.3662552\n10.1029/94JC00572\n10.1029/94JC00572\n10.1175/1520-0493(1998)126<0796:DAUAEK>2.0.CO;2\n10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129<0420:ASWTET>2.0.CO;2\n10.1175/2007MWR2018.1\n10.1175/MWR-D-11-00276.1\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.481\n10.1109/MCSE.2014.80\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.10.1385\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.168101\n10.1016/j.cma.2019.112615\n10.1063/1.1504242\n10.1002/qj.3387\n10.1198/016214506000001437\n10.1002/qj.3447\n10.1177/1099800409338516\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.112.973560\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2006.12.040\n10.1109/TBME.1978.326270\n10.1016/j.physd.2006.09.035\n10.1007/s10651-007-0033-0\n10.1002/qj.2054\n10.1175/1520-0493(2004)132<1238:IOIEAO>2.0.CO;2"}

Therefore, the goal of our study was to create scaffold-free, 3D-printed cardiac tissue grafts from hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs), and to evaluate whether or not mechanical stimulation would result in improved graft maturation. To explore this, we used a 3D bioprinter to produce scaffold-free cardiac tissue grafts from hiPSC-derived CM cell spheroids. Static mechanical stretching of these grafts significantly increased sarcomere length compared to unstimulated free-floating tissues, as determined by immunofluorescent image analysis. Stretched tissue was found to have decreased elastic modulus, increased maximal contractile force, and increased alignment of formed extracellular matrix, as expected in a functionally maturing tissue graft. Additionally, stretched tissues had upregulated expression of cardiac-specific gene transcripts, consistent with increased cardiac-like cellular identity. Finally, analysis of extracellular matrix organization in stretched grafts suggests improved remodeling by embedded cardiac fibroblasts. Taken together, our results suggest that mechanical stretching stimulates hiPSC-derived CMs in a 3D-printed, scaffold-free tissue graft to develop mature cardiac material structuring and cellular fates.

To test the effects on durability, some patches were bioprinted as a single layer only, cultured under minimal movement conditions or had added fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix hydrogel (AlloECM). Controls included acellular AlgGel and gelatin methacryloyl (GELMA) patches.\nPrintability was similar across bioprinters. For AlgGel compared to GELMA: resolutions were similar (200-700 \u03bcm line diameters), printing accuracy was 45 and 25%, respectively (AlgGel was 1.7x more accurate; \nAlgGel-based 3D bioprinted heart patches permit cardiomyocyte contractility and endothelial cell structural self-organisation. After bioprinting, a period of 2 weeks maturation in culture prior to transplantation may be optimal, allowing for a degree of tissue maturation but before many patches start to lose integrity. We quantify AlgGel printability and present novel factors which reduce AlgGel patch durability (layer number, movement, and the addition of AlloECM) and factors which had minimal effect on durability (bioprinting system and cellular patch content).", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2021-03-23", "authors": ["Christopher DavidRoche", "PoonamSharma", "Anthony WayneAshton", "ChrisJackson", "MeilangXue", "CarmineGentile"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2021.636257\n10.1016/j.gendis.2017.10.002\n10.1002/adhm.201500677\n10.3390/ma12172669\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00414\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab402c\n10.3791/50154\n10.1101/2020.01.23.915868\n10.1002/dvdy.22161\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab6f0d\n10.2217/3dp-2018-2017\n10.1016/j.devcel.2015.06.017\n10.1038/s41598-018-31848-x\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00776\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.047\n10.1038/s41598-019-55034-55039\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1016/j.healun.2015.06.001\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.3791/55438\n10.1038/s41598-017-05018-4\n10.1161/circresaha.115.307778\n10.1515/cdbme-2020-3121\n10.1038/s41598-017-06385-6388\n10.1093/ejcts/ezaa093\n10.3791/61675\n10.1093/ejcts/ezaa205\n10.1088/1758-5090/aba2b6\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139"}
{"title": "Remote ischemic preconditioning does not induce activation of Akt and STAT5 in the rat heart.", "abstract": "Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is hypothesized to be a promising cardioprotective strategy to protect hearts against ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury; however, the current understanding of the underlying signal transduction pathways involved remains unclear. It has been previously demonstrated that protein kinase B/AKT, which is a crucial protein of the reperfusion injury salvage kinases pathway, and STAT5, which is a member of the survivor activating factor enhancement pathway, serve a pivotal role in cardioprotection. However, whether and at what time-points (TPs) RIPC leads to the activation of AKT and STAT5 in a rat model of RIPC and I/R injury remains to be determined. The present study hypothesized that RIPC may induce the phosphorylation of AKT and/or STAT5 immediately following RIPC and/or at a later TP with or without subsequent I/R. In the first set of experiments (part A), male Wistar rats were randomized into 2 groups (n=6 per group): The first group underwent RIPC via a hind limb tourniquet (4x5 min I/R episodes), while the second group received the respective sham treatment. In the second set of experiments (part B), the rats were randomized into 4 groups (n=6 per group) that either underwent RIPC or sham treatment prior to 35 min of ischemia by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 120 min reperfusion or a respective sham treatment. At the end of the experiments, the heart tissue was isolated in order to analyze the phosphorylation levels of AKT and STAT5. The results revealed that RIPC did not induce the immediate or late phosphorylation of AKT or STAT5. In addition, following I/R, the activation of AKT and STAT5 was not modulated by RIPC. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggested that RIPC-induced cardioprotection may not be mediated by the activation of AKT or STAT5 at the investigated TPs.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2021-03-23", "authors": ["AnnikaRaupach", "KatharinaFeige", "ChristianReiter", "TimoBrandenburger", "NicoleHeinen", "Andr\u00e9Heinen", "Markus WHollmann", "RagnarHuhn", "CarolinTorregroza"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2021.9849\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.1124/pr.113.008300\n10.1161/01.cir.74.5.1124\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305348\n10.3390/ijms20194839\n10.1007/s00395-017-0662-x\n10.1042/CS20100466\n10.1007/s00395-018-0670-5\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx030\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259556\n10.1093/cvr/cvy014\n10.1007/s00395-015-0474-9\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.01.007\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000412\n10.1186/s12967-014-0228-8\n10.1113/EP085535\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.306878\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000737\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001296\n10.1371/journal.pone.0096567"}

Its activation is associated with an exaggeration of cell proliferation with an increase in repair capacity resulting in increased radioresistance. On cardiac tissues, HER2 receptor activation plays a cardio-protective role. Trastuzumab, the first anti-HER2 drug used to treat patients with breast cancer overexpressing HER2 receptor , inhibits the cascade of reactions resulting in the proliferation of tumor cells, thus restoring cellular radiosensitivity. However, the combination of Trastuzumab with radiation therapy also removes HER2 receptor cardio-protective role on myocardial cells which increases the risk of cardiotoxicity. Thus, the concomitant association of these two modalities has long been a subject of controversy. Recent advances in radiation therapy technology and early detection of cardiac injury may limit the cardiotoxicity of this combination. Through this review, we developed the biological basis and the benefit-risk of concomitant combination of radiotherapy and Trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of breast cancers overexpressing HER2 and we discuss the modalities of its optimization.", "journal": "Bulletin du cancer", "date": "2021-03-23", "authors": ["NejlaFourati", "RimTrigui", "SelmaCharfeddine", "FatmaDhouib", "Wala BenKridis", "LeilaAbid", "AfefKhanfir", "WafaMnejja", "JamelDaoud"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bulcan.2020.12.012"}
{"title": "Genome-first approach to rare EYA4 variants and cardio-auditory phenotypes in adults.", "abstract": "While newborns and children with hearing loss are routinely offered genetic testing, adults are rarely clinically tested for a genetic etiology. One clinically actionable result from genetic testing in children is the discovery of variants in syndromic hearing loss genes. EYA4 is a known hearing loss gene which is also involved in important pathways in cardiac tissue. The pleiotropic effects of rare EYA4 variants are poorly understood and their prevalence in a large cohort has not been previously reported. We investigated cardio-auditory phenotypes in 11,451 individuals in a large biobank using a rare variant, genome-first approach to EYA4. We filtered 256 EYA4 variants carried by 6737 participants to 26 rare and predicted deleterious variants carried by 42 heterozygotes. We aggregated predicted deleterious EYA4 gene variants into a combined variable (i.e. \"gene burden\") and performed association studies across phenotypes compared to wildtype controls. We validated findings with replication in three independent cohorts and human tissue expression data. EYA4 gene burden was significantly associated with audiometric-proven HL (p\u2009=\u2009[Formula: see text], Mobitz Type II AV block (p\u2009=\u2009[Formula: see text]) and the syndromic presentation of HL and primary cardiomyopathy (p\u2009=\u20090.0194). Analyses on audiogram, echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram data validated these associations. Prior reports have focused on identifying variants in families with severe or syndromic phenotypes. In contrast, we found, using a genotype-first approach, that gene burden in EYA4 is associated with more subtle cardio-auditory phenotypes in an adult medical biobank population, including cardiac conduction disorders which have not been previously reported. We show the value of using a focused approach to uncover human disease related to pleiotropic gene variants and suggest a role for genetic testing in adults presenting with hearing loss.", "journal": "Human genetics", "date": "2021-03-22", "authors": ["ShadiAhmadmehrabi", "BinglanLi", "JosephPark", "BatsalDevkota", "MarijanaVujkovic", "Yi-AnKo", "DavidVan Wagoner", "W H WilsonTang", "IanKrantz", "MarylynRitchie", "NoneNone", "JasonBrant", "Michael JRuckenstein", "Douglas JEpstein", "Daniel JRader"], "doi": "10.1007/s00439-021-02263-6\n10.1038/s41439-018-0023-9\n10.1002/lary.28646\n10.1016/j.ccep.2010.09.008\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.08.006\n10.1093/hmg/8.1.11\n10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.4911245\n10.1177/000348941112000405\n10.1172/JCI32899\n10.1126/science.aaf6814\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000000610\n10.1002/ajmg.a.31860\n10.1161/CIRCGEN.118.002107\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.08.016\n10.1371/journal.pone.0160519\n10.1016/0002-8703(57)90079-0\n10.1111/ahg.12383\n10.1097/00003446-199704000-00003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0119443\n10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80556-5\n10.1161/CIRCGEN.117.002037\n10.1371/journal.pone.0126602\n10.1002/ajmg.a.31793\n10.1111/j.1399-0004.2007.00828.x\n10.1038/s41436-019-0625-8\n10.1038/ng.517\n10.1007/BF03402171\n10.1093/europace/eut272\n10.1161/01.cir.101.15.1812\n10.1038/ng1527\n10.1038/ng1197-267\n10.1038/s41436-019-0563-5\n10.1038/s41598-020-60259-0\n10.3892/ijmm.2014.1939\n10.1177/0003489415614863\n10.1038/s41467-018-04766-9\n10.1186/s12881-019-0806-y\n10.1242/dev.012237\n10.1093/hmg/10.3.195\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.115.001134\n10.1186/s12859-018-2591-6"}

Here, we summarize some of the recent developments in methods for immunolabeling and imaging whole organs and provide a protocol optimized for the heart.\nMultiple protocols have been established for chemically clearing large organs and variations are compatible with cell type-specific labeling. Heart tissue can be successfully cleared to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the entire coronary vasculature in neonatal and adult mice. Obtaining vascular reconstructions requires exceptionally large imaging files and new computational methods to process the data for accurate vascular quantifications. This is a continually advancing field that has revolutionized our ability to acquire data on larger samples as a faster rate.\nHistorically, cardiovascular research has relied heavily on histological analyses that use tissue sections, which usually sample cellular phenotypes in small regions and lack information on whole tissue-level organization. This approach can be modified to survey whole organs but image acquisition and analysis time can become unreasonable. In recent years, whole-organ immunolabeling and clearing methods have emerged as a workable solution, and new microscopy modalities, such as light-sheet microscopy, significantly improve image acquisition times.

It has been reported that YHR can treat HF and has a certain protective effect on myocardial cell damage. The purpose of this study is to determine the cardioprotective effects of YHR on HF-induced apoptosis and to clarify its mechanism of action. Oxygen glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R) induces H9C2 cell apoptosis model. Ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) coronary artery can induce an animal model of HF. We found that YHR protected H9C2 cells from OGD/R-induced apoptosis, reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H9C2 cells, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential in H9C2 cells. The results of in vivo animal experiments showed that in the HF model, YHR could reduce infarct area of heart tissue and cardiomyocyte apoptosis rate. YHR regulated the expression of key apoptotic molecules, including increasing the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax, and reducing the expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and caspase-3. Interestingly, YHR also regulates the expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the nucleus.

{"title": "Adrenergic tone benefits cardiac performance and warming tolerance in two teleost fishes that lack a coronary circulation.", "abstract": "Tolerance to acute environmental warming in fish is partly governed by the functional capacity of the heart to increase systemic oxygen delivery at high temperatures. However, cardiac function typically deteriorates at high temperatures, due to declining heart rate and an impaired capacity to maintain or increase cardiac stroke volume, which in turn has been attributed to a deterioration of the electrical conductivity of cardiac tissues and/or an impaired cardiac oxygen supply. While autonomic regulation of the heart may benefit cardiac function during warming by improving myocardial oxygenation, contractility and conductivity, the role of these processes for determining whole animal thermal tolerance is not clear. This is in part because interpretations of previous pharmacological in vivo experiments in salmonids are ambiguous and were confounded by potential compensatory increases in coronary oxygen delivery to the myocardium. Here, we tested the previously advanced hypothesis that cardiac autonomic control benefits heart function and acute warming tolerance in perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus); two species that lack coronary arteries and rely entirely on luminal venous oxygen supplies for cardiac oxygenation. Pharmacological blockade of \u03b2-adrenergic tone lowered the upper temperature where heart rate started to decline in both species, marking the onset of cardiac failure, and reduced the critical thermal maximum (CT", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

Adjusted analysis showed significant association between urinary iAs concentration with AA (P\u2009=\u20090.012) and AG (P\u2009=\u20090.034) genotypes and cardiac iAs concentration with AA (P\u2009=\u20090.017) genotype of AS3MT rs10748835. The AG genotype of AS3MT rs10748835 (13.333 95%CI 1.280-138.845, P\u2009=\u20090.013), AA genotype of NOS3 rs3918181 (25.333 95%CI 2.065-310.757, P\u2009=\u20090.002), GG genotype of ICAM1 rs281432 (12.000 95%CI 1.325-108.674, P\u2009=\u20090.010) and AA genotype of SOD2 rs2758331 (13.333 95%CI 1.280-138.845, P\u2009=\u20090.013) were found significantly associated with CVD patients from arsenic-affected areas. Again, adjusted analysis showed significant association of AA genotype of AS3MT rs10748835 with CVD patients from arsenic affected areas. In comparison to the reference genotypes of the selected SNPs, AA of AS3MT 10748835, AG of NOS3 rs3918181 and AC of rs3918188, GG of ICAM1 rs281432, TT of VCAM1 rs3176867, AA of SOD2 rs2758331 and GT of APOE rs405509 significantly increased odds of cardiac tissue injury of CVD patients from arsenic affected areas. The results showed that the selected SNPs played a susceptibility role towards cardiac tissue iAs concentration and injury among CVD patients from iAs affected areas.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-03-20", "authors": ["MohammadAl-Forkan", "Fahmida BintaWali", "LailaKhaleda", "Md JibranAlam", "Rahee HasanChowdhury", "AmitDatta", "Md ZillurRahman", "NazmulHosain", "Mohammad FazleMaruf", "Muhammad Abdul QuaiumChowdhury", "N K M MirazulHasan", "Injamamul IsmailShawon", "RubhanaRaqib"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-85780-8\n10.1016/j.envint.2017.12.017\n10.2471/BLT.11.101253\n10.3390/ijerph13020215\n10.1093/aje/kwu238\n10.3390/ijerph8061991\n10.1007/s10653-008-9235-0\n10.1007/s00204-007-0272-8\n10.15406/jccr.2018.11.00377\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.088\n10.1007/s00335-018-9736-9\n10.1136/bmj.d2431\n10.1093/aje/kwt001\n10.1002/jat.1649\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.06.602\n10.1080/15287390590967414\n10.1016/j.taap.2007.10.013\n10.1093/aje/kwr464\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2016.02.017\n10.1038/s41598-017-18925-3\n10.1016/j.taap.2007.02.007\n10.1016/j.envres.2011.05.003\n10.1002/bdra.23399\n10.1289/ehp.9734\n10.3390/ijms12042351\n10.1007/s00204-010-0568-y\n10.4330/wjc.v3.i1.18\n10.1289/ehp.1307883\n10.1006/niox.2001.0351\n10.4238/gmr.15028044\n10.1006/niox.2001.0351\n10.1007/s10528-013-9628-3\n10.1007/s10528-011-9458-0\n10.1161/hc3701.095949\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01728-X\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109658\n10.1038/nri3520\n10.1016/j.watres.2010.06.051\n10.1016/j.agee.2005.08.034\n10.1007/s40726-015-0022-0\n10.3923/jas.2006.1275.1286\n10.1016/j.jtemb.2015.01.003\n10.2166/wst.2000.0568\n10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00471-3\n10.1016/j.envres.2014.03.012\n10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2008.07.003\n10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.003\n10.1093/toxsci/kfw112\n10.1016/j.taap.2013.11.004\n10.1289/ehp.1002471\n10.3892/br.2017.916\n10.9734/JSRR/2013/3091\n10.1016/j.eurpsy.2009.03.003\n10.1016/j.taap.2006.12.032\n10.1186/1476-069X-10-64\n10.3390/ijerph2005030002\n10.1016/j.toxrep.2016.01.001\n10.1182/blood.V45.2.241.241\n10.1177/0960327110389835\n10.3329/bmrcb.v45i1.41802\n10.1039/AN9952000643\n10.1093/nar/gkm904"}
{"title": "Regulation of cardiomyocyte DNA damage and cell death by the type 2A protein phosphatase regulatory protein alpha4.", "abstract": "The type 2A protein phosphatase regulatory protein alpha4 (\u03b14) constitutes an anti-apoptotic protein in non-cardiac tissue, however it's anti-apoptotic properties in the heart are poorly defined. To this end, we knocked down \u03b14 protein expression (\u03b14 KD) using siRNA in cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes and confirmed the lack of DNA damage/cell death by TUNEL staining and MTT assay. However, \u03b14 KD did increase the phosphorylation of p53 and ATM/ATR substrates, decreased the expression of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and associated fragments. Expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was reduced, whereas expression of pro-apoptotic BAX protein did not change. Alpha4 KD reduced basal H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation, whereas adenoviral-mediated re-expression of \u03b14 protein following \u03b14 KD, restored basal H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139. The sensitivity of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity was augmented by \u03b14 KD. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of \u03b14 protein in ARVM increased PP2AC expression and augmented H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation in response to doxorubicin. Furthermore, pressure overload-induced heart failure was associated with reduced \u03b14 protein expression, increased ATM/ATR protein kinase activity, increased H2AX expression and Ser139 phosphorylation. Hence, this study describes the significance of altered \u03b14 protein expression in the regulation of DNA damage, cardiomyocyte cell death and heart failure.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-03-20", "authors": ["JonathanCowan", "Michael RLongman", "Andrew KSnabaitis"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-85616-5\n10.1101/gad.10.15.1904\n10.1006/bbrc.1998.8792\n10.1006/bbrc.1998.9493\n10.1016/S0014-5793(99)00189-1\n10.1073/pnas.94.20.10624\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.036\n10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00386-0\n10.1016/j.molcel.2009.09.025\n10.1074/jbc.M601054200\n10.1007/s00395-017-0625-2\n10.1021/bi901837h\n10.1074/jbc.M112.368613\n10.1126/science.1100537\n10.1056/NEJM199704173361603\n10.1161/01.RES.85.9.856\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0193\n10.1161/01.CIR.95.2.320\n10.1056/NEJM199610173351603\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.03.057\n10.1073/pnas.90.12.5613\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.12.001\n10.1038/nrm3047\n10.1126/science.1108297\n10.1074/jbc.275.13.9390\n10.1074/jbc.273.10.5858\n10.1074/jbc.C100466200\n10.1091/mbc.e04-10-0890\n10.1016/j.molcel.2009.04.012\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3207\n10.1074/jbc.C100569200\n10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2013.07.007\n10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00610-2\n10.1126/science.281.5383.1674\n10.1126/science.281.5383.1677\n10.1074/jbc.C200093200\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.01.025\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)00647-1\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207180\n10.1152/ajpcell.00229.2006\n10.1056/NEJM199809243391307\n10.1002/1097-0142(197308)32:2<302::AID-CNCR2820320205>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30535-1\n10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312103\n10.1038/nm.2919\n10.4161/cc.24127\n10.1016/j.molcel.2017.05.027\n10.1074/jbc.M410233200\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207005\n10.1016/j.molcel.2008.03.016\n10.1016/S0301-472X(03)00083-3\n10.1371/journal.pone.0145938\n10.1016/j.molcel.2005.10.003\n10.1128/MCB.00741-09\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175877\n10.1074/jbc.274.53.37538\n10.1074/jbc.M001002200\n10.1016/j.molcel.2017.05.015\n10.1016/0092-8674(95)90541-3\n10.1038/376037a0\n10.1073/pnas.1323107111\n10.18632/oncotarget.21784\n10.1016/0092-8674(93)90509-O\n10.4161/cc.10.9.15479\n10.1161/JAHA.117.006349\n10.1038/ncomms15104\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.11.054\n10.1016/S1046-5928(03)00141-4\n10.1074/jbc.M600268200"}
{"title": "Cardiac Tissues From Stem Cells: New Routes to Maturation and Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "The ability of human pluripotent stem cells to form all cells of the body has provided many opportunities to study disease and produce cells that can be used for therapy in regenerative medicine. Even though beating cardiomyocytes were among the first cell types to be differentiated from human pluripotent stem cell, cardiac applications have advanced more slowly than those, for example, for the brain, eye, and pancreas. This is, in part, because simple 2-dimensional human pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocyte cultures appear to need crucial functional cues normally present in the 3-dimensional heart structure. Recent tissue engineering approaches combined with new insights into the dialogue between noncardiomyocytes and cardiomyocytes have addressed and provided solutions to issues such as cardiomyocyte immaturity and inability to recapitulate adult heart values for features like contraction force, electrophysiology, or metabolism. Three-dimensional bioengineered heart tissues are thus poised to contribute significantly to disease modeling, drug discovery, and safety pharmacology, as well as provide new modalities for heart repair. Here, we review the current status of 3-dimensional engineered heart tissues.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2021-03-19", "authors": ["GiuliaCampostrini", "Laura MWindt", "Berend Jvan Meer", "MilenaBellin", "Christine LMummery"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318183"}
{"title": "Current Challenges and Solutions to Tissue Engineering of Large-scale Cardiac Constructs.", "abstract": "Large-scale tissue engineering of cardiac constructs is a rapidly advancing field; however, there are several barriers still associated with the creation and clinical application of large-scale engineered cardiac tissues. We provide an overview of the current challenges and recently (within the last 5 years) described promising solutions to overcoming said challenges.\nThe five major criteria yet to be met for clinical application of engineered cardiac tissues are successful electrochemical/mechanical cell coupling, efficient maturation of cardiomyocytes, functional vascularization of large tissues, balancing appropriate immune response, and large-scale generation of constructs. Promising solutions include the use of carbon/graphene in conjunction with existing scaffold designs, utilization of biological hormones, 3D bioprinting, and gene editing. While some of the described barriers to generation of large-scale cardiac tissue have seen encouraging advancements, there is no solution that yet achieves all 5 described criteria.

{"title": "Elastin-inspired supramolecular hydrogels: a multifaceted extracellular matrix protein in biomedical engineering.", "abstract": "The phenomenal advancement in regenerative medicines has led to the development of bioinspired materials to fabricate a biomimetic artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) to support cellular survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Researchers have diligently developed protein polymers consisting of functional sequences of amino acids evolved in nature. Nowadays, certain repetitive bioinspired polymers are treated as an alternative to synthetic polymers due to their unique properties like biodegradability, easy scale-up, biocompatibility, and non-covalent molecular associations which imparts tunable supramolecular architecture to these materials. In this direction, elastin has been identified as a potential scaffold that renders extensibility and elasticity to the tissues. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are artificial repetitive polymers that exhibit lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior in a particular environment than synthetic polymers and hence have gained extensive interest in the fabrication of stimuli-responsive biomaterials. This review discusses in detail the unique structural aspects of the elastin and its soluble precursor, tropoelastin. Furthermore, the versatility of elastin-like peptides is discussed through numerous examples that bolster the significance of elastin in the field of regenerative medicines such as wound care, cardiac tissue engineering, ocular disorders, bone tissue regeneration, etc. Finally, the review highlights the importance of exploring short elastin-mimetic peptides to recapitulate the structural and functional aspects of elastin for advanced healthcare applications.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2021-03-18", "authors": ["ArchitaSharma", "PoojaSharma", "SangitaRoy"], "doi": "10.1039/d0sm02202k"}

The oxygen-abundant nature of GO means the material is hydrophilic and readily dispersible in water. GO has also been known to improve cell proliferation, drug loading, and antimicrobial properties of composites. Electrospun composites likewise have great potential for biomedical applications because they are generally biocompatible and bioresorbable, possess low immune rejection risk, and can mimic the structure of the extracellular matrix. In the current review, GO-containing electrospun composites for tissue engineering applications are described in detail. In addition, electrospun GO-containing materials for their use in drug and gene delivery, wound healing, and biomaterials/medical devices have been examined. Good biocompatibility and anionic-exchange properties of GO make it an ideal candidate for drug and gene delivery systems. Drug/gene delivery applications for electrospun GO composites are described with a number of examples. Various systems using electrospun GO-containing therapeutics have been compared for their potential uses in cancer therapy. Micro- to nanosized electrospun fibers for wound healing applications and antimicrobial applications are explained in detail. Applications of various GO-containing electrospun composite materials for medical device applications are listed.

This study is aimed at investigating the effect of inhibiting mitochondrial FAO on myocardial injury and the underlying mechanisms of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. Rats were induced, subjected to 8\u2009min of ventricular fibrillation, and underwent 6\u2009min of CPR. Rats with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were randomly divided into the Sham group, CPR group, and CPR\u2009+\u2009Trimetazidine (TMZ) group. Rats in the CPR\u2009+\u2009TMZ group were administered TMZ (10\u2009mg/kg) at the onset of ROSC via the right external jugular vein, while rats in the CPR group were injected with equivalent volumes of vehicle. The sham rats were only administered equivalent volumes of vehicle. We found that the activities of enzymes related to cardiac mitochondrial FAO were partly improved after ROSC. TMZ, as a reversible inhibitor of 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase, inhibited myocardial mitochondrial FAO after ROSC. In the CPR\u2009+\u2009TMZ group, the levels of mitochondrial injury in cardiac tissue were alleviated following attenuated myocardial damage and oxidative stress after ROSC. In addition, the disorder of cardiac mitochondrial metabolism was ameliorated, and specifically, the superfluous succinate related to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was decreased by inhibiting myocardial mitochondrial FAO with TMZ administration after ROSC. In conclusion, in the early period after ROSC, inhibiting cardiac mitochondrial FAO attenuated excessive cardiac ROS generation and preserved myocardial function, probably by alleviating the dysfunction of cardiac mitochondrial metabolism in a rat model of cardiac arrest.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2021-03-18", "authors": ["PengWang", "FanZhang", "LimingPan", "YunkeTan", "FengqingSong", "QiulinGe", "ZitongHuang", "LanYao"], "doi": "10.1155/2021/6622232\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1001/jamacardio.2017.0035\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.988725\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.032\n10.1089/ars.2011.4459\n10.1038/s41598-020-58334-7\n10.1152/physrev.00024.2007\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.06.016\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2018.09.041\n10.1016/j.tem.2018.02.002\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.09.026\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2009\n10.1016/j.mito.2018.02.009\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.02.032\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.05.019\n10.1080/07853890.2017.1417631\n10.1093/cvr/cvw100"}

The SAP rat model was developed by injecting sodium touracholate into SD rats and then infected with lentivirus vectors expressing sh-CREB in the presence/absence of LPS. The pathological alterations of rat pancreatic and cardiac tissues were observed by HE staining. TUNEL assay was used to study apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Next, the loss- and gain-function assay was conducted in LPS-induced myocardial injury cardiomyocytes to define the roles of CREB, HDAC2, and TLR4 in cardiomyocyte proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, and myocardial injury in vitro. ChIP assay was used to study the enrichment of CREB bound to HDAC2 promoter. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expressions of related mRNA and proteins in the NF-\u03baB pathway, respectively. CREB was found to be overexpressed in both SAP tissues and cells. CREB directly bound to the promoter of HDAC2 and activated its expression. Overexpressed CREB or HDAC2 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Suppression of CREB inhibited the HDAC2/TLR4/NF-\u03baB cascade to promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. The in vitro results were validated in vivo experiments.

{"title": "Impact of Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Surface Modification with Conventional and Amino Acid-Conjugated Self-Assembled Monolayers on the Differentiation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells into Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes, differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have the potential to produce patient- and disease-specific pharmacological and toxicological platforms, in addition to their cardiac cell therapy applications. However, the lack of both a robust and a simple procedure for scalable cell substrate production is one of the major limitations in this area. Mimicking the natural healthy myocardium extracellular matrix (ECM) properties by altering the cell substrate properties, such as stiffness and chemical/biochemical composition, can significantly affect cell substrate interfacial characteristics and potentially influence cellular behavior and differentiation of iPSCs to cardiomyocytes. Here, we propose a systematic and biomimetic approach, based on the preparation of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrates having the similar stiffness as healthy heart tissue and a well-defined surface chemistry obtained by conventional [(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS)] and amino acid (histidine and leucine)-conjugated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Among a wide range of different concentrations, the 50:1 prepolymer cross-linker ratio of PDMS allowed adaptation of the myocardium stiffness with a Young's modulus of 23.79 \u00b1 0.61 kPa. Compared with conventional SAM modification, amino acid-conjugated SAMs greatly improved iPSC adhesion, viability, and cardiac marker expression by increasing surface biomimetic properties, whereas all SAMs enhanced cell behavior, with respect to native PDMS.

Evidences have suggested that inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signalling prevents cardiac dysfunction and remodelling in surgical, hypertension and pressure overload models. The present study investigated the effects of Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin inhibitor on calcium overload and mitochondrial dysfunction in rat sepsis model of cardiomyopathy. Induction of sepsis by cecal ligation puncture (CLP) resulted in the up-regulation of cardiac \u03b2-catenin transcriptional levels and cardiac dysfunction depicted by increased serum lactate dehydrogenase, CK-MB levels reduced maximum (dp/dt max.) and minimum developed pressure (dp/dt min.), increased LVEsDP and relaxation constant tau values. Moreover, oxidative and inflammatory stress, immune cell infiltration, increased myeloperoxidase activity, enhanced caspase-3 activity and fibronectin protein levels were observed in septic rat's heart. Also, septic rat's heart displayed mitochondrial dysfunction due to mPTP opening, increased calcium up-regulation in left ventricular apex tissues and whole heart, increased collagen staining, necrosis and structural damage. Pre-treatment with Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin antagonist attenuated sepsis-induced serum and tissue biochemical changes, cardiac dysfunction and structural alterations by inhibiting mitochondrial mPTP opening and restricting calcium overloading in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2021-03-17", "authors": ["PallaviSen", "KirtiGupta", "AbhaKumari", "GaaminepreetSingh", "SnehaPandey", "RaginiSingh"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-021-09643-4\n10.1042/BST0340232\n10.1155/2015/726012"}

We studied the relationship between the functioning of the pro/antioxidant balance in muscle tissues (skeletal muscle and cardiac tissues) of pigeons (Columba livia f. urbana) living in areas with different levels of pollution (Pomeranian Voivodeship, Northern Poland). The current study demonstrated the impact of the environment with preferential high Pb contamination in soil and feathers of pigeons on the formation of adaptive redox mechanisms in muscle tissues. An increase in the intensity of lipid peroxidation (estimated by the TBARS level) accompanied by enhancement of the oxidative modification of proteins (aldehydic and ketonic derivatives) and an important decrease in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GR) in pigeon muscle tissue was observed. These changes in enzyme activities were dependent on the type of muscle tissue (skeletal muscle and cardiac tissues).

{"title": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived three-dimensional cardiomyocyte tissues ameliorate the rat ischemic myocardium by remodeling the extracellular matrix and cardiac protein phenotype.", "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in the viability and survival of implanted human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). We hypothesized that coating of three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissue-derived hiPSC-CMs with the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) would improve the survival of transplanted cells in the heart and improve heart function in a rat model of ischemic heart failure. To test this hypothesis, we first explored the tolerance of FN-coated hiPSC-CMs to hypoxia in an in vitro study. For in vivo assessments, we constructed 3D-hiPSC cardiac tissues (3D-hiPSC-CTs) using a layer-by-layer technique, and then the cells were implanted in the hearts of a myocardial infarction rat model (3D-hiPSC-CTs, n = 10; sham surgery control group (without implant), n = 10). Heart function and histology were analyzed 4 weeks after transplantation. In the in vitro assessment, cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase assays showed that FN-coated hiPSC-CMs had improved tolerance to hypoxia compared with the control cells. In vivo, the left ventricular ejection fraction of hearts implanted with 3D-hiPSC-CT was significantly better than that of the sham control hearts. Histological analysis showed clear expression of collagen type IV and plasma membrane markers such as desmin and dystrophin in vivo after implantation of 3D-hiPSC-CT, which were not detected in 3D-hiPSC-CMs in vitro. Overall, these results indicated that FN-coated 3D-hiPSC-CT could improve distressed heart function in a rat myocardial infarction model with a well-expressed cytoskeletal or basement membrane matrix. Therefore, FN-coated 3D-hiPSC-CT may serve as a promising replacement for heart transplantation and left ventricular assist devices and has the potential to improve survivability and therapeutic efficacy in cases of ischemic heart disease.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2021-03-16", "authors": ["JunyaYokoyama", "ShigeruMiyagawa", "TakamiAkagi", "MitsuruAkashi", "YoshikiSawa"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0245571\n10.2147/TCRM.S179302\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.178\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.45\n10.1096/fj.05-4715fje\n10.1038/srep29933\n10.1038/srep01316\n10.1002/adhm.201500065\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.01.033\n10.1152/ajpheart.01156.2009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301152\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0247\n10.1097/TP.0000000000002653\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.01.003\n10.1093/cvr/cvn225\n10.1371/journal.pone.0092833\n10.1016/j.matbio.2005.12.001\n10.1016/j.matbio.2017.08.001\n10.1161/JAHA.119.015841\n10.1152/ajplung.2001.280.4.L680\n10.1186/1471-2202-10-13\n10.1038/s41598-019-39532-4"}
{"title": "Adverse cardiovascular effects of exposure to cadmium and mercury alone and in combination on the cardiac tissue and aorta of Sprague-Dawley rats.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify cardiovascular effects of relevant concentrations of Cd and Hg alone and in combination as a mixture in water. This was achieved by administering to male Sprague-Dawley rats via gavage 0.62\u2009mg/kg Cd or 1.23\u2009mg/kg Hg, or a combination of 0.62\u2009mg/kg Cd and 1.23\u2009mg/kg Hg in the co-exposure group for 28\u2009days. Concentrations were the rat equivalence dosages of 1,000 times the World Health Organization's limits of 0.003\u2009mg/L and 0.006\u2009mg/L for Cd and Hg, respectively, for water. With termination, blood levels of the metals were increased. For all metal exposed groups, histological evaluation and transmission electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed myofibrillar necrosis, increased fibrosis, vacuole formation and mitochondrial damage. Cd caused the most mitochondrial damage while Hg to a greater degree induced fibrosis. In the aorta, both Cd and Hg also increased collagen deposition adversely altering the morphology of the fenestrated elastic fibers in the tunica media. Co-exposure resulted in increased cardiotoxicity with increased mitochondrial damage, fibrosis and distortion of the aortic wall as a result of increased collagen deposition, as well as altered elastin deposition, fragmentation and interlink formation. These are typical features of oxidative damage that correlates with a phenotype of premature ageing of the CVS that potentially can lead to hypertension and premature cardiac failure.", "journal": "Journal of environmental science and health.

As techniques for reprogramming human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequently differentiating them into cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cells have become increasingly efficient, progress toward the development of engineered human cardiac muscle patch (hCMP) and heart tissue analogs has accelerated. A few pilot clinical studies in patients with post-infarction LV remodeling have been already approved. Conventional methods for hCMP fabrication include suspending cells within scaffolds, consisting of biocompatible materials, or growing two-dimensional sheets that can be stacked to form multilayered constructs. More recently, advanced technologies, such as micropatterning and three-dimensional bioprinting, have enabled fabrication of hCMP architectures at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.

{"title": "Systemic and local cardiac inflammation after experimental long bone fracture, traumatic brain injury and combined trauma in mice.", "abstract": "Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in the young population. Cardiac injuries are an independent predictor for a poor overall outcome after trauma. The aim of the present study was to analyze systemic inflammation as well as local cardiac inflammation after experimental limb-, neuro- and combined trauma in mice.\nMale C57BL/6 mice received either a closed tibia fracture (Fx), isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) or a combination of both (Fx\u00a0\u200b+\u00a0\u200bTBI). Control animals underwent sham procedure. After 6 and 24\u00a0\u200bh, systemic levels of inflammatory mediators were analyzed, respectively. Locally, cardiac inflammation and cardiac structural alterations were investigated in left ventricular tissue of mice 6 and 24\u00a0\u200bh after trauma.\nMice showed enhanced systemic inflammation after combined trauma, which was manifested by increased levels of KC, MCP-1 and G-CSF. Locally, mice exhibited increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF) in heart tissue, which was probably mediated via toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Furthermore, mice demonstrated a redistribution of connexin 43 in cardiac tissue, which appeared predominantly after combined trauma. Besides inflammation and structural cardiac alterations, expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) mRNA was increased in the heart early after TBI and after combination of TBI and limb fracture, indicating a modification of energy metabolism. Early after combination of TBI and tibia fracture, nitrosative stress was increased, manifested by elevation of nitrotyrosine in cardiac tissue. Finally, mice showed a trend of increased systemic levels of cardiac troponin I and heart-fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) after combined trauma, which was associated with a significant decrease of troponin I and HFABP mRNA expression in cardiac tissue after TBI and combination of TBI and limb fracture.\nMice exhibited early cardiac alterations as well as alterations in cardiac glucose transporter expression, indicating a modification of energy metabolism, which might be linked to increased systemic- and local cardiac inflammation after limb-, neuro- and combined trauma. These cardiac alterations might predispose individuals for secondary cardiac damage after trauma that might compromise cardiac function after TBI and long bone fracture.\nInjuries to the head and extremities frequently occur after severe trauma.

{"title": "Proteomic and Structural Manifestations of Cardiomyopathy in Rat Models of Obesity and Weight Loss.", "abstract": "Obesity cardiomyopathy increases the risk of heart failure and death. Obesity is curable, leading to the restoration of the heart phenotype, but it is not clear if there are any after-effects of obesity present after weight loss. We characterize the proteomic landscape of obesity cardiomyopathy with an evaluation of whether the cardiac phenotype is still shaped after weight loss. Cardiomyopathy was validated by cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, oversized myocytes, and mTOR upregulation in a rat model of cafeteria diet-induced developmental obesity. By global proteomic techniques (LC-MS/MS) a plethora of molecular changes was observed in the heart and circulation of obese animals, suggesting abnormal utilization of metabolic substrates. This was confirmed by increased levels of cardiac ACSL-1, a key enzyme for fatty acid degradation and decreased GLUT-1, a glucose transporter in obese rats. Calorie restriction and weight loss led to the normalization of the heart's size, but fibrosis was still excessive. The proteomic compositions of cardiac tissue and plasma were different after weight loss as compared to control. In addition to morphological consequences, obesity cardiomyopathy involves many proteomic changes.

{"title": "A 3-D human model of complex cardiac arrhythmias.", "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias impact over 12 million people globally, with an increasing incidence of acquired arrhythmias. Although animal models have shed light onto fundamental arrhythmic mechanisms, species-specific differences and ethical concerns remain. Current human models using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) either lack the higher order tissue organization of the heart or implement unreliable arrhythmia induction techniques. Our goal was to develop a robust model of acquired arrhythmia by disrupting cardiomyocyte cell-cell signaling - one of the hallmarks of complex arrhythmias. Human 3D microtissues were generated by seeding hydrogel-embedded hiPSC-CMs and cardiac fibroblasts into an established microwell system designed to enable active and passive force assessment. Cell-cell signaling was disrupted using methyl-beta cyclodextrin (MBCD), previously shown to disassemble cardiac gap junctions. We demonstrate that arrhythmias were progressive and present in all microtissues within 5 days of treatment. Arrhythmic tissues exhibited reduced conduction velocity, an increased number of distinct action potentials, and reduced action potential cycle length. Arrhythmic tissues also showed significant reduction in contractile force generation, increased beating frequency, and increased passive tension and collagen deposition, in line with fibrosis. A subset of tissues with more complex arrhythmias exhibited 3D spatial differences in action potential propagation. Pharmacological and electrical defibrillation was successful. Transcriptomic data indicated an enrichment of genes consistent with cardiac arrhythmias. MBCD removal reversed the arrhythmic phenotype, resulting in synchronicity despite not resolving fibrosis. This innovative & reliable human-relevant 3D acquired arrhythmia model shows potential for improving our understanding of arrhythmic action potential conduction and furthering therapeutic development. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This work describes a 3D human model of cardiac arrhythmia-on-a-chip with high reproducibility, fidelity, and extensive functional applicability. To mimic\u00a0in vivo\u00a0conditions, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts from healthy controls were combined in a biocompatible fibrin hydrogel and seeded between two deflectable polymeric rods. Using the innate functional properties of this 3D model as well as advanced optical imaging techniques we demonstrated dramatic changes in contraction rate, synchronicity, and electrophysiological conduction in arrhythmic tissues relative to controls. Taken together, these data demonstrate the distinctive potential of this new model for pathophysiological studies, and for arrhythmia drug testing applications.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2021-03-14", "authors": ["KennethWilliams", "TimothyLiang", "St\u00e9phaneMass\u00e9", "SafwatKhan", "RupalHatkar", "GordonKeller", "KumaraswamyNanthakumar", "Sara SNunes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2021.03.004"}

To verify this hypothesis, ECM-coated human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), ECM-coated cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), and uncoated cardiac endothelial cells (CEs) were mixed in the following ratios: 10:0:0 (10CT), 7:2:1 (7CT), 5:4:1 (5CT), and 2:7:1 (2CT). The expression of cardiac-, fibroblasts-, and endothelial-specific markers was assessed by FACS, qPCR, and immunostaining while that of ECM-, cell adhesion-, and ion channel-related genes was examined by qPCR. Finally, the contractile properties of the tissues were evaluated in the absence or presence of E-4031 and isoproterenol. The expression of ECM- and adhesion-related genes significantly increased, while that of ion channel-related genes significantly decreased with the CF proportion. Notably, 7CT showed the greatest contractility of all 3D-CTs. When exposed to E-4031 (hERG K channel blocker), 7CT and 5CT showed significantly decreased contractility and increased QT prolongation. Moreover, 10CT and 7CT exhibited a stronger response to isoproterenol than did the other 3D-CTs. Finally, 7CT showed the highest drug sensitivity among all 3D-CTs.

{"title": "Loss of sarcomeric proteins via upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling underlies interferon-\u03b3-induced contractile deficit in engineered human myocardium.", "abstract": "The level of circulating interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) is elevated in various clinical conditions including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, and viral infections. As these conditions are associated with high risk of myocardial dysfunction, we investigated the effects of IFN\u03b3 on 3D fibrin-based engineered human cardiac tissues (\"cardiobundles\"). Cardiobundles were fabricated from human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, exposed to 0-20\u00a0ng/ml of IFN\u03b3 on culture days 7-14, and assessed for changes in tissue structure, viability, contractile force and calcium transient generation, action potential propagation, cytokine secretion, and expression of select genes and proteins. We found that application of IFN\u03b3 induced a dose-dependent reduction in contractile force generation, deterioration of sarcomeric organization, and cardiomyocyte disarray, without significantly altering cell viability, action potential propagation, or calcium transient amplitude. At molecular level, the IFN\u03b3-induced structural and functional deficits could be attributed to altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway (JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1), and reduced expression of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2v, and sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin. Application of clinically used JAK/STAT inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib, fully prevented IFN\u03b3-induced cardiomyopathy, confirming the critical roles of this signaling pathway in inflammatory cardiac disease. Taken together, our in vitro studies in engineered myocardial tissues reveal direct adverse effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 on human cardiomyocytes and establish the foundation for a potential use of cardiobundle platform in modeling of inflammatory myocardial disease and therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, lupus erythematosus, Chagas disease, and others, as well as viral infections including H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 show increased systemic levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and are associated with high risk of heart disease. Here we explored for the first time if chronically elevated levels of IFN\u03b3 can negatively affect structure and function of engineered human heart tissues in vitro.

{"title": "Mitochondrial activity regulates the differentiation of skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells into brown adipocytes to contribute to hypertension.", "abstract": "Brown adipocytes (BAs) are major components of brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is involved in blood pressure regulation. BAs are derived from multiple progenitors, including PDGFR\u03b1\nProtein expression was measured by flow cytometry or Western blotting, and gene mRNA levels were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). To induce the differentiation of S-MSCs into BAs, S-MSCs were stimulated with a brown adipogenic cocktail comprising insulin, IBMX, dexamethasone, triiodothyronine (T3), and rosiglitazone for the indicated periods. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured with an XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Mitochondrial mass was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence staining. Hypertension was induced in WT mice by infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using a tail cuff. Interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT)-deficient mice were generated by surgical removal of the iBAT depot, after which the animals were allowed to recover for 6\u2009days. Aortic, iBAT, and heart tissue sections were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining.\nWe found that in vitro, S-MSCs isolated from the mouse dermis expressed the stem cell markers CD90/105 and PDGFR\u03b1 and readily differentiated into BAs. Mitochondrial biogenesis and oxygen consumption were markedly increased during differentiation of S-MSCs into BAs. In vivo, iBAT was converted to white adipose tissue (WAT) in Ang II-induced hypertensive mice. We assessed the direct role of BAT in blood pressure (BP) regulation by using iBAT-deficient mice (generated by surgical removal of iBAT) and C57BL/6 (wild-type (WT)) mice and found that Ang II-induced BP elevation and vascular damage were markedly aggravated in iBAT-deficient mice compared with WT mice.\nThis study demonstrates that PDGFR\u03b1", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2021-03-12", "authors": ["WendaXi", "WendongChen", "WeihongSun", "XiangxiaoLi", "ZhiminSuo", "GonghaoJiang", "PingjinGao", "QunLi"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-021-02169-0\n10.3109/07853890.2010.535557\n10.1002/cphy.c170001\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.21.2177\n10.1038/366740a0\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.06.013\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312838\n10.1038/nature07182\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1038/cr.2010.11\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.03.009\n10.1089/scd.2005.14.337\n10.1002/stem.1763\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0179\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.180\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.08.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077077\n10.1038/s41598-019-43410-4\n10.1242/dev.091777\n10.1074/jbc.REV118.000828\n10.1038/ncomms5099\n10.1073/pnas.1010929108\n10.1007/s13238-017-0385-7\n10.1126/science.1241359\n10.1016/j.tice.2016.08.001\n10.1038/s41598-018-25866-y"}

{"title": "Low-dose Dasatinib Ameliorates Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines.", "abstract": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) is an autosomal dominant disorder presenting with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Up to 85% of NSML cases are caused by mutations in the PTPN11 gene that encodes for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). We previously showed that low-dose dasatinib protects from the development of cardiac fibrosis in a mouse model of NSML harboring a Ptpn11\nDasatinib was administered intraperitoneally into NSML mice with doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg. PK parameters of dasatinib in NSML mice were determined. PD parameters were obtained for biochemical analyses from heart tissue. Dasatinib-treated NSML mice (0.1 mg/kg) were subjected to echocardiography and assessment of markers of HCM by qRT-PCR. Transcriptome analysis was performed from the heart tissue of low-dose dasatinib-treated mice.\nLow-dose dasatinib exhibited PK properties that were linear across doses in NSML mice. Dasatinib treatment of between 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg in NSML mice yielded an exposure-dependent inhibition of c-Src and PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation and inhibited AKT phosphorylation. We found that doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg of dasatinib prevented HCM in NSML mice. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed HCM-associated genes in the heart of NSML mice that were reverted to wild type levels by low-dose dasatinib administration.\nThese data demonstrate that low-dose dasatinib exhibits desirable therapeutic PK properties that is sufficient for effective target engagement to ameliorate HCM progression in NSML mice.

{"title": "Stimuli-responsive biomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering and dynamic mechanobiology.", "abstract": "Since the term \"smart materials\" was put forward in the 1980s, stimuli-responsive biomaterials have been used as powerful tools in tissue engineering, mechanobiology, and clinical applications. For the purpose of myocardial repair and regeneration, stimuli-responsive biomaterials are employed to fabricate hydrogels and nanoparticles for targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs and cells, which have been proved to alleviate disease progression and enhance tissue regeneration. By reproducing the sophisticated and dynamic microenvironment of the native heart, stimuli-responsive biomaterials have also been used to engineer dynamic culture systems to understand how cardiac cells and tissues respond to progressive changes in extracellular microenvironments, enabling the investigation of dynamic cell mechanobiology. Here, we provide an overview of stimuli-responsive biomaterials used in cardiovascular research applications, with a specific focus on cardiac tissue engineering and dynamic cell mechanobiology. We also discuss how these smart materials can be utilized to mimic the dynamic microenvironment during heart development, which might provide an opportunity to reveal the fundamental mechanisms of cardiomyogenesis and cardiac maturation.", "journal": "APL bioengineering", "date": "2021-03-11", "authors": ["HuaiyuShi", "ChenyanWang", "ZhenMa"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0025378\n10.1038/s41536-017-0015-2\n10.1038/nature10137\n10.1016/j.devcel.2018.03.019\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.025\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.07.009\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.12.052\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1186/scrt482\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1007/s12265-013-9510-z\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.024\n10.1021/acsami.6b15271\n10.1016/S0169-409X(97)00121-X\n10.1039/c2sm25474c\n10.1021/nn406657b\n10.1038/nature07970\n10.1002/anie.201907817\n10.1039/c3cs60058k\n10.1002/adma.200601784\n10.1073/pnas.0611613104\n10.1038/nmat2606\n10.1016/j.cej.2015.12.021\n10.1021/bm501710e\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.10.050\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0574\n10.1002/pi.2230\n10.1039/c2cs15327k\n10.1039/C3RA47370H\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.114\n10.1002/adfm.201400279\n10.1038/natrevmats.2016.75\n10.1002/adem.200700355\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.084\n10.1002/adma.201902900\n10.1021/acsami.6b01374\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.025\n10.1586/erd.11.27\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.10.061\n10.1039/C4BM00448E\n10.1089/107632701300062732\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.067\n10.3389/fchem.2018.00565\n10.1016/j.ajps.2016.07.001\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0143\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.02.056\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.023\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.11.075\n10.1038/s41569-018-0022-z\n10.1038/s41467-019-09587-y\n10.1002/adhm.201300076\n10.1002/adfm.201701798\n10.1038/nnano.2015.111\n10.1039/c3tb20365d\n10.1038/nmat3776\n10.1002/adma.201502003\n10.1039/C6NR08869D\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.11.009\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2008.01.002\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01008\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.01.031\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.03.008\n10.1002/jbm.a.32951\n10.1529/biophysj.107.124545\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1021/acsami.9b02446\n10.1039/B810034A\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.12.012\n10.1021/am301908w\n10.1016/j.ceca.2006.09.005\n10.1007/s12195-015-0413-8\n10.1021/acsami.5b11671\n10.1073/pnas.0906504107\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.055\n10.3390/s16081258\n10.1021/acsami.7b01555\n10.1096/fasebj.14.5.669\n10.1038/srep20674\n10.1369/jhc.4A6608.2005\n10.1161/01.RES.0000178788.76568.8a\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00318\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.1038/s41551-018-0280-4\n10.1038/s41551-018-0344-5\n10.1161/01.RES.0000159181.06379.63\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2010.10.002\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.16.2177\n10.1016/S0022-5223(97)70266-6\n10.1016/S0022-5223(94)70341-8\n10.1002/btpr.1633\n10.1002/adhm.201300692\n10.1038/nmat3889\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.006\n10.1021/acsami.5b02080\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.062\n10.1021/acsami.0c03464\n10.1371/journal.pone.0194706\n10.1152/ajpheart.01017.2005\n10.1038/ncb1705\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.020\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.08.033\n10.1039/C8TB01116H\n10.1021/acsabm.8b00440\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b01682\n10.1039/C7RA03780E\n10.1039/C9BM00434C"}
{"title": "The risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with human heart valve transplantation: evaluation of cardio-vascular tissues from two consecutive heart donors with asymptomatic COVID-19.", "abstract": "We report on two living donors of explanted hearts while receiving heart transplantation that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the day of donation, although clinically asymptomatic. They underwent heart transplantation for ischaemic and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, respectively. After evaluation of donor hearts, we cryopreserved and stored two pulmonary valves for clinical application and one aortic valve for research. Light microscopy of myocardium, mitral valve and aortic and pulmonary arterial wall and RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test of myocardium, mitral and tricuspid valve and aortic wall for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Presence of ACE2 in tissues was assessed with immunostaining. Light microscopy revealed a mild eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, whereas enlarged cardiomyocytes with irregular nucleus and some with cytoplasmic vacuoles in the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy heart. Aortic and pulmonary wall were histologically normal. Immunostaining revealed diffuse presence of ACE2 in the myocardium of the heart with eosinophilic myocarditis, but only discrete presence in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart. The RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test showed no presence of the virus in tested tissues. Despite eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, no viral traces were found in the myocardium and valve tissues. However, ACE2 was present diffusely in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart. SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the cardiac tissues of these COVID-19 asymptomatic heart donors. In our opinion, clinical application of the valves from these donors presents negligible risk for coronavirus transmission. Nonetheless, considering the uncertainty regarding the risk of virus transmission with the human tissue transplantation, we would not release in any case the pulmonary valve recovered from the eosinophilic myocarditis heart. In contrast, we may consider the release of the pulmonary valve from the dilated cardiomyopathy heart only for a life-threatening situation when no other similar allograft were available.", "journal": "Cell and tissue banking", "date": "2021-03-10", "authors": ["RJashari", "MVan Esbroeck", "JVanhaebost", "IMicalessi", "AKerschen", "SMastrobuoni"], "doi": "10.1007/s10561-021-09913-z\n10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.007\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31305-2\n10.1016/j.tmrv.2020.02.003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa078\n10.1161/circulationAHA.120.046941\n10.2807/1560.7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045\n10.1002/PATH.1560\n10.1016/s1010-7940(96)01127-x\n10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z\n10.1111/ajt.15997\n10.1007/s10561-004-1441-0\n10.1080/00015458.2010.11680618\n10.1093/cid/ciaa201\n10.1111/ajt.16000\n10.7326/M20-0504\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.3862\n10.1001/jama.2020.8259\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02153.x\n10.1093/cid/ciaa149\n10.1002/jmv.25725\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa231\n10.1001/jama.2020.3204JAMA"}
{"title": "Continuous measurement of surface electrical potentials from transplanted cardiomyocyte tissue derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells under physiological conditions in vivo.", "abstract": "Recording the electrical potentials of bioengineered cardiac tissue after transplantation would help to monitor the maturation of the tissue and detect adverse events such as arrhythmia. However, a few studies have reported the measurement of myocardial tissue potentials in vivo under physiological conditions. In this study, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSCM) sheets were stacked and ectopically transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue of rats for culture in vivo. Three months after transplantation, a flexible nanomesh sensor was implanted onto the hiPSCM tissue to record its surface electrical potentials under physiological conditions, i.e., without the need for anesthetic agents that might adversely affect cardiomyocyte function. The nanomesh sensor was able to record electrical potentials in non-sedated, ambulating animals for up to 48\u00a0h. When compared with recordings made with conventional needle electrodes in anesthetized animals, the waveforms obtained with the nanomesh sensor showed less dispersion of waveform interval and waveform duration. However, waveform amplitude tended to show greater dispersion for the nanomesh sensor than for the needle electrodes, possibly due to motion artifacts produced by movements of the animal or local tissue changes in response to surgical implantation of the sensor. The implantable nanomesh sensor utilized in this study potentially could be used for long-term monitoring of bioengineered myocardial tissue in vivo under physiological conditions.", "journal": "Heart and vessels", "date": "2021-03-09", "authors": ["HiroshiGoto", "HyoeKomae", "HidekazuSekine", "JunHomma", "SunghoonLee", "TomoyukiYokota", "KatsuhisaMatsuura", "TakaoSomeya", "MinoruOno", "TatsuyaShimizu"], "doi": "10.1007/s00380-021-01824-z\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.07.010\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.089\n10.1038/srep45499\n10.1002/term.1995\n10.1007/s00380-019-01550-7\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.2174/1566523216666160119094143\n10.1038/ncomms11425\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2016.04.023\n10.1038/nnano.2016.96\n10.1002/adma.201405017\n10.1038/nmat4590\n10.1002/adhm.201701100\n10.1126/science.1260318\n10.1038/nmat3468\n10.1007/s00380-019-01347-8\n10.1038/s41565-018-0331-8\n10.1161/hh0302.105722\n10.1038/nm1576\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.042\n10.1253/circj.CJ-15-0243\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2005.07.023"}

SRT1460 is the activator for Sirt1 that participates in the regulation of various diseases. However, whether SRT1460 has any effects on myocardial I/R injury needs further study.\nThe I/R rat model and H/R H9C2 model were established to simulate myocardial I/R injury. The infarct area of the rat heart was examined through TTC staining. The EF and FS of rats were detected through echocardiography. The levels of CK-MB, LDH, MDA, SOD and CK in cardiac tissues, serum or H9C2 cells were measured using commercial kits. Cell viability was assessed through MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined through flow cytometry analysis. Sirt1 expression was measured through western blot.\nOur work found that SRT1460 reduced the infarct area of the heart induced by myocardial I/R injury. In addition, SRT1460 was confirmed to ameliorate cardiac dysfunction induced by myocardial I/R injury. Further exploration discovered that SRT1460 weakened oxidative stress induced by myocardial I/R injury. Findings from in vitro assays demonstrated that SRT1460 relieved injury of H/R-treated H9C2 cells. Finally, rescue assays proved that Sirt1 knockdown reversed the protective effects of SRT1460 on the injury of H/R-treated H9C2 cells.\nSirt1 activated by SRT1460 protected against myocardial I/R injury.

{"title": "Chrysin attenuates high-fat-diet-induced myocardial oxidative stress via upregulating eNOS and Nrf2 target genes in rats.", "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia is one of the risk factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disorders. Chrysin (Chy) is reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous, anti-oxidative, anti-aging, and anti-atherogenic properties. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether Chy would mediate the cardioprotective effect against hypercholesterolemia-triggered myocardial oxidative stress. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into different groups as control and fed with high-fat diet (HFD) followed by oral administration of Chy (100\u00a0mg/kg b.wt), atorvastatin (Atv) (10\u00a0mg/kg b.wt), and L-NAME (10\u00a0mg/kg b.wt) for 30\u00a0days. At the end of the experimental period, the rats were sacrificed and tissues were harvested. Biochemical results showed a significant increase of cardiac disease marker enzymes (ALT, AST, and CKMB), lipid peroxidation, and lipid profile (TC, TG, LDL, and VLDL) in HFD-fed rat tissues when compared to control, whereas oral administration of Chy significantly reduced the activities of these marker enzymes and controlled the lipid profile. qRT-PCR studies revealed that Chy administration significantly increased the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and Nrf2 target genes such as SOD, catalase, and GCL3 in left ventricular heart tissue of HFD-challenged rats. Immunohistochemistry results also showed that Chy treatment increased myocardial protein expression of eNOS and Nrf2 in HFD-challenged rats. Concluding the results of the present study, the Chy could mediate the cardioprotective effect through the activation of eNOS and Nrf2 signaling against hypercholesterolemia-induced oxidative stress.

{"title": "3D Bioprinted Cardiac Tissues and Devices for Tissue Maturation.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Given the limited endogenous regenerative capabilities of cardiac tissue, patient-specific anatomy, challenges in treatment options, and shortage of donor tissues for transplantation, there is an urgent need for novel approaches in cardiac tissue repair. 3D bioprinting is a technology based on additive manufacturing which allows for the design of precisely controlled and spatially organized structures, which could possibly lead to solutions in cardiac tissue repair. In this review, we describe the basic morphological and physiological specifics of the heart and cardiac tissues and introduce the readers to the fundamental principles underlying 3D printing technology and some of the materials/approaches which have been used to date for cardiac repair. By summarizing recent progress in 3D printing of cardiac tissue and valves with respect to the key features of cardiovascular tissue (such as contractility, conductivity, and vascularization), we highlight how 3D printing can facilitate surgical planning and provide custom-fit implants and properties that match those from the native heart. Finally, we also discuss the suitability of this technology in the design and fabrication of custom-made devices intended for the maturation of the cardiac tissue, a process that has been shown to increase the viability of implants. Altogether this review shows that 3D printing and bioprinting are versatile and highly modulative technologies with wide applications in cardiac regeneration and beyond.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2021-03-08", "authors": ["VeronikaSedlakova", "ChristopherMcTiernan", "DavidCortes", "Erik JSuuronen", "Emilio IAlarcon"], "doi": "10.1159/000512792"}

However, their poor tensile strength renders them unsuitable for cardiac tissue engineering (CTE). In this study, we developed and evaluated PVA-PVP-based patches, plasticized with glycerol or propylene glycol (0.1%-0.4%; v:v), for their application in CTE. The cardiac patches were evaluated for their physico-chemical (weight, thickness, folding endurance, FT-IR, and swelling behavior) and mechanical properties. The optimized patches were characterized for their ability to support in vitro attachment, viability, proliferation, and beating behavior of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (CMs). In vivo evaluation of the cardiac patches was done under the subcutaneous skin pouch and heart of rat models. Results showed that the optimized molar ratio of PVA:PVP with plasticizers (0.3%; v-v) resulted in cardiac patches, which were dry at room temperature and had desirable folding endurance of at least 300, a tensile strength of 6-23\u2009MPa and, percentage elongation at break of more than 250%. Upon contact with phosphate-buffered saline, these PVA-PVP patches formed hydrogel patches having the tensile strength of 1.3-3.0\u2009MPa. The patches supported the attachment, viability, and proliferation of primary neonatal mouse CMs and were nonirritant and noncorrosive to cardiac cells.

For this purpose, 75 mature male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing 150-170 g were randomly divided into five groups (15 rats each): control group (rats were I/P injected with 1% ethanol in saline), nicotine group (rats were I/P injected with 0.6 mg/kg body weight), and combined nicotine and melatonin groups (rats received nicotine as in the previous group and melatonin at a dose of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg body weight, respectively); all treatments were continued for 21 days. Fasting blood samples were collected from each rat at the 11th day and one day after the end of the last injection (22nd day) for complete blood count (CBC) determination, while sera were collected for the determination of lipid profiles. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as DNA fragmentation percentage were assessed in cardiac tissue. Heart and lung samples were collected for estimation of caspase-3 expression and histopathological examination. The results revealed that nicotine increased the number of RBCs, Hb concentration, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL). In addition, it decreased SOD activity and GSH concentration with increased MDA concentration, and DNA fragmentation in the heart, as well as caspase-3 expression in both heart and lungs. It also induced histopathological changes in the heart and lung tissues. Melatonin could ameliorate the deleterious effect of nicotine on the previous parameters either partially or completely, where melatonin restored complete blood count, improved lipid profile, mended lipid peroxidation and antioxidant parameters in the cardiac tissue, rectified caspase-3 expression in the heart and lungs, ameliorated DNA fragmentation percentage in the heart, and protected both heart and lung tissue against the harmful effect of nicotine.

{"title": "Effects of Apocynin on Heart Muscle Oxidative Stress of Rats with Experimental Diabetes: Implications for Mitochondria.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) constitutes one of the public health problems today. It is characterized by hyperglycemia through a defect in the \u03b2-cells function and/or decreased insulin sensitivity. Apocynin has been tasted acting directly as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, exhibiting beneficial effects against diabetic complications. Hence, the present study's goal was to dissect the possible mechanisms by which apocynin could mediate its cardioprotective effect against DM-induced oxidative stress. Male Wistar rats were assigned into 4 groups: Control (C), control + apocynin (C+A), diabetes (D), diabetes + apocynin (D+A). DM was induced with streptozotocin. Apocynin treatment (3 mg/kg/day) was applied for 5 weeks. Treatment significantly decreased blood glucose levels and insulin resistance in diabetic rats. In cardiac tissue, ROS levels were higher, and catalase enzyme activity was reduced in the D group compared to the C group; the apocynin treatment significantly attenuated these responses. In heart mitochondria, Complexes I and II of the electron transport chain (ETC) were significantly enhanced in the D+A group. Total glutathione, the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the GSH/ oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio were increased in the D+A group. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were without change.

The cardiovascular complications of acromegaly go from arterial hypertension to a peculiar form of cardiomyopathy and are the result of the long-standing exposure to high GH and IGF-1 levels. The pathophysiology of these complications is complex and includes an increased tubular reabsorption of sodium and the direct effects of GH and IGF-1 on the endothelium and the cardiac tissue itself.

Its progression is essential for post-MI infarct healing, during which transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) plays a critical role. Limb-bud and Heart (LBH), a newly discovered target gene of TGF-\u03b21, was shown to promote normal cardiogenesis. \u03b1B-crystallin (CRYAB), an LBH-interacting protein, was demonstrated to be involved in TGF-\u03b21-induced fibrosis. The roles and molecular mechanisms of LBH and CRYAB during cardiac fibrosis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the alterations of LBH and CRYAB expression in mouse cardiac tissue after MI. LBH and CRYAB were upregulated in activated cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), while in vitro TGF-\u03b21 stimulation induced the upregulation of LBH, CRYAB, and fibrogenic genes in primary CFs of neonatal rats. The results of the ectopic expression of LBH proved that LBH accelerated CF proliferation under hypoxia, mediated the expression of CRYAB and fibrogenic genes, and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like processes in rat CFs, while subsequent CRYAB silencing reversed the effects induced by elevated LBH expression. We also verified the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between LBH and CRYAB in fibroblasts. In summary, our work demonstrated that LBH promotes the proliferation of CFs, mediates TGF-\u03b21-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and EMT-like processes through CRYAB upregulation, jointly functioning in post-MI infarct healing.

{"title": "Protective effects of curcumin on chemical and drug-induced cardiotoxicity: a review.", "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity is a major adverse effect that can be induced by both therapeutic agents and industrial chemicals. The pathogenesis of such cardiac damage is multifactorial, often injuring the cardiac tissue by generating free radicals, oxidative stress, and/or inflammation. Curcumin (CUR) is a bright yellow chemical produced by Curcuma longa plants. It is the principal curcuminoid of turmeric (Curcuma longa), a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. Administration of CUR has been reported to ameliorate the chemical and drug-induced cardiac injury in several studies. CUR has been suggested to act as an effective candidate against oxidative stress and inflammation in heart tissue via regulation of Nrf2 and suppression of p38 MAPK/NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasomes.

Some patients with CCHD are unoperated for various reasons and remain chronically hypoxic throughout their lives, which heightens the risk of heart failure as they age. Hypoxia activates cellular metabolic adaptation to balance energy demands by accumulating hypoxia-inducible factor 1-\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). This study aims to determine the effect of CH on cardiac metabolism and function in patients with CCHD and its association with age. The role of HIF-1\u03b1 in this process was investigated, and potential therapeutic targets were explored.\nPatients with CCHD (n=25) were evaluated for cardiac metabolism and function with positron emission tomography/computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Heart tissue samples were subjected to metabolomic and protein analyses. CH rodent models were generated to enable continuous observation of changes in cardiac metabolism and function. The role of HIF-1\u03b1 in cardiac metabolic adaptation to CH was investigated with genetically modified animals and isotope-labeled metabolomic pathway tracing studies.\nPrepubertal patients with CCHD had glucose-dominant cardiac metabolism and normal cardiac function. In comparison, among patients who had entered puberty, the levels of myocardial glucose uptake and glycolytic intermediates were significantly decreased, but fatty acids were significantly increased, along with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. These clinical phenotypes were replicated in CH rodent models. In patients with CCHD and animals exposed to CH, myocardial HIF-1\u03b1 was upregulated before puberty but was significantly downregulated during puberty. In cardiomyocyte-specific \nIn patients with CCHD, maladaptation of cardiac metabolism occurred during puberty, along with impaired cardiac function.

{"title": "PCB and TCDD derived embryonic cardiac defects result from a novel AhR pathway.", "abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) are environmental contaminants known to impact cardiac development, a key step in the embryonic development of most animals. To date, little is understood of the molecular mechanism driving the observed cardiac defects in exposed fishes. The literature shows PCB & TCDD derived cardiac defects are concurrent with, but not caused by, expression of cyp1A, due to activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) gene activation pathway. However, in this study, detailed visualization of fish hearts exposed to PCBs and TCDD show that, in addition to a failure of cardiac looping in early heart development, the inner endocardial lining of the heart fails to maintain proper cell adhesion and tissue integrity. The resulting gap between the endocardium and myocardium in both zebrafish and Atlantic sturgeon suggested functional faults in endothelial adherens junction formation. Thus, we explored the molecular mechanism triggering cardiac defects using immunohistochemistry to identify the location and phosphorylation state of key regulatory and adhesion molecules. We hypothesized that PCB and TCDD activates AhR, phosphorylating Src, which then phosphorylates the endothelial adherens junction protein, VEcadherin. When phosphorylated, VEcadherin dimers, found in the endocardium and vasculature, separate, reducing tissue integrity. In zebrafish, treatment with PCB and TCDD contaminants leads to higher phosphorylation of VEcadherin in cardiac tissue suggesting that these cells have reduced connectivity. Small molecule inhibition of Src phosphorylation prevents contaminant stimulated phosphorylation of VEcadherin and rescues both cardiac function and gross morphology. Atlantic sturgeon hearts show parallels to contaminant exposed zebrafish cardiac phenotype at the tissue level. These data suggest that the mechanism for PCB and TCDD action in the heart is, in part, distinct from the canonical mechanism described in the literature and that cardiac defects are impacted by this nongenomic mechanism.", "journal": "Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "date": "2021-03-05", "authors": ["CorinnaSingleman", "Nathalia GHoltzman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105794"}
{"title": "Pulmonary, cardiac and renal distribution of ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 in rats with heart failure: Potential implication for COVID-19 disease.", "abstract": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is often associated with kidney and pulmonary dysfunction. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contributes to avid sodium retention, cardiac hypertrophy and oedema formation, including lung congestion. While the status of the classic components of RAAS such as renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin II receptor AT-1 is well studied in CHF, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a key enzyme of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) generation in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal systems has not been studied thoroughly in this clinical setting. This issue is of a special interest as Ang 1-7 counterbalance the vasoconstrictory, pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative actions of Ang II. Furthermore, CHF predisposes to COVID-19 disease severity, while ACE2 also serves as the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 in human host-cells, and acts in concert with furin, an important enzyme in the synthesis of BNP in CHF, in permeating viral functionality along TMPRSST2. ADAM17 governs ACE2 shedding from cell membranes. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the expression of ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 in the lung, heart and kidneys of rats with CHF to understand the exaggerated susceptibility of clinical CHF to COVID-19 disease. Heart failure was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by the creation of a surgical aorto-caval fistula. Sham-operated rats served as controls. One week after surgery, the animals were subdivided into compensated and decompensated CHF according to urinary sodium excretion. Both groups and their controls were sacrificed, and their hearts, lungs and kidneys were harvested for assessment of tissue remodelling and ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 immunoreactivity, expression and immunohistochemical staining. ACE2 immunoreactivity and mRNA levels increased in pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated, but not in decompensated CHF. Furin immunoreactivity was increased in both compensated and decompensated CHF in the pulmonary, cardiac tissues and renal cortex but not in the medulla. Interestingly, both the expression and abundance of pulmonary, cardiac and renal TMPRSS2 decreased in CHF in correlation with the severity of the disease. Pulmonary, cardiac and renal ADAM17 mRNA levels were also downregulated in decompensated CHF. Circulating furin levels increased in proportion to CHF severity, whereas plasma ACE2 remained unchanged. In summary, ACE2 and furin are overexpressed in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated and to a lesser extent of decompensated CHF as compared with their sham controls. The increased expression of the ACE2 in heart failure may serve as a compensatory mechanism, counterbalancing the over-activity of the deleterious isoform, ACE. Downregulated ADAM17 might enhance membranal ACE2 in COVID-19 disease, whereas the suppression of TMPRSS2 in CHF argues against its involvement in the exaggerated susceptibility of CHF patients to SARS-CoV2.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2021-03-05", "authors": ["Emad EKhoury", "YaraKnaney", "AhmadFokra", "SafaKinaneh", "ZaherAzzam", "Samuel NHeyman", "ZaidAbassi"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.16310\n10.1016/j.isci.2020.101642"}
{"title": "Scaffold-Mediated Developmental Effects on Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes Are Preserved After External Support Removal.", "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells have been used as a cell source for regenerative therapy and disease modeling. The purity of hiPS-cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) has markedly improved with advancements in cell culture and differentiation protocols. However, the morphological features and molecular properties of the relatively immature cells are still unclear, which has hampered their clinical application. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which topographic substrates actively influence hiPS-CMs. hiPS-CMs were seeded on randomized oriented fiber substrate (random), anisotropic aligned fiber substrate (align), and flat non-scaffold substrate (flat). After culturing for one week, the hiPS-CMs on the aligned patterns showed more mature-like properties, including elongated rod shape, shorter duration of action potential, accelerated conduction velocity, and elevated cardiac gene expression. Subsequently, to determine whether this development was irreversible or was altered after withdrawal of the structural support, the hiPS-CMs were harvested from the three different patterns and reseeded on the non-scaffold (flat) pattern. After culturing for one more week, the improvements in morphological and functional properties diminished, although hiPS-CMs pre-cultured on the aligned pattern retained the molecular features of development, which were even more significant as compared to that observed during the pre-culture stage. Our results suggested that the anisotropic fiber substrate can induce the formation of geometrical mimic-oriented heart tissue in a short time. Although the morphological and electrophysiological properties of hiPS-CMs obtained via facilitated maturation somehow rely on the existence of an exterior scaffold, the molecular developmental features were preserved even in the absence of the external support, which might persist throughout hiPS-CM development.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2021-03-05", "authors": ["JunLi", "Jong-KookLee", "KeikoMiwa", "YukiKuramoto", "KiyoshiMasuyama", "HidekiYasutake", "SatokiTomoyama", "HiroyukiNakanishi", "YasushiSakata"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2021.591754\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.05.004\n10.1038/sj.mt.6300303\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.09.028\n10.1242/dev.171983\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.10.014\n10.1002/stem.1660\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btz931\n10.1186/s12859-018-2486-6\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq030\n10.1007/s00395-019-0765-7\n10.1016/j.scr.2016.04.014\n10.1161/01.res.0000031957.70034.89\n10.1253/circj.CJ-17-0400\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2016.0535\n10.1039/c2ib20067h\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.099\n10.1152/ajpheart.1995.269.2.H571\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00818\n10.1093/nar/gkv1189\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176131\n10.3390/jfb7010001\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1536/ihj.17-730\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00050\n10.1007/s11010-009-0061-1\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034105\n10.1161/01.res.24.3.339\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003552\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05100.x\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1089/scd.2014.0533\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.04.005\n10.1038/nature09855\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311080\n10.1007/s11936-015-0399-5"}
{"title": "Minimally invasive delivery of therapeutic agents by hydrogel injection into the pericardial cavity for cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Cardiac patches are an effective way to deliver therapeutics to the heart. However, such procedures are normally invasive and difficult to perform. Here, we develop and test a method to utilize the pericardial cavity as a natural \"mold\" for in situ cardiac patch formation after intrapericardial injection of therapeutics in biocompatible hydrogels. In rodent models of myocardial infarction, we demonstrate that intrapericardial injection is an effective and safe method to deliver hydrogels containing induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiac progenitor cells\u00a0or mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes. After injection, the hydrogels form a\u00a0cardiac patch-like structure in the pericardial cavity, mitigating immune response and increasing the cardiac retention of the therapeutics.

As SGLT2 is known to be absent in heart cells, improved cardiovascular outcomes are thought to be accounted for by the indirect effects of the drug. We sought to confirm whether such benefits were mediated through SGLT2 expressed in the heart using myocardial infarction (MI) model.\nMice pre-treated with empagliflozin (EMPA), an SGLT2 inhibitor, showed a significantly reduced infarct size compared with the vehicle group three days post-MI. Interestingly, we confirmed SGLT2 localized in the infarct zone. The sequential changes of SGLT2 expression after MI were also evaluated.\nOne day after MI, SGLT2 transiently appeared in the ischemic areas in the vehicle group and increased until 72 hours. The appearance of SGLT2 was delayed and less in amount compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, there was a significant difference in metabolites, including glucose and amino acids in the \u00b9H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis between groups.\nOur work demonstrates that SGLT2 is transiently expressed in heart tissue early after MI and EMPA may directly operate on SGLT2 to facilitate metabolic substrates shifts.", "journal": "Korean circulation journal", "date": "2021-03-04", "authors": ["Soo YongLee", "Tae WookLee", "Gyu TaePark", "Jae HoKim", "Hyun ChaeLee", "Jung HwaHan", "AeseonYoon", "DahyeYoon", "ShukmannKim", "Soon MyungJung", "Jin HeeChoi", "Min KuChon", "Sang HyunLee", "Ki WonHwang", "JeongsuKim", "Yong HyunPark", "June HongKim", "Kook JinChun", "JinHur"], "doi": "10.4070/kcj.2020.0303"}
{"title": "Diabetes induces dysregulation of microRNAs associated with survival, proliferation and self-renewal in cardiac progenitor cells.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus causes a progressive loss of functional efficacy in stem cells, including cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). The underlying molecular mechanism is still not known. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate genes at the post-transcriptional level. We aimed to determine if diabetes mellitus induces dysregulation of miRNAs in CPCs and to test if in vitro therapeutic modulation of miRNAs would improve the functions of diabetic CPCs.\nCPCs were isolated from a mouse model of type 2 diabetes (db/db), non-diabetic mice and human right atrial appendage heart tissue. Total RNA isolated from mouse CPCs was miRNA profiled using Nanostring analysis. Bioinformatic analysis was employed to predict the functional effects of altered miRNAs. MS analysis was applied to determine the targets, which were confirmed by western blot analysis. Finally, to assess the beneficial effects of therapeutic modulation of miRNAs in vitro and in vivo, prosurvival miR-30c-5p was overexpressed in mouse and human diabetic CPCs, and the functional consequences were determined by measuring the level of apoptotic cell death, cardiac function and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).\nAmong 599 miRNAs analysed in mouse CPCs via Nanostring analysis, 16 miRNAs showed significant dysregulation in the diabetic CPCs. Using bioinformatics tools and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) validation, four altered miRNAs (miR-30c-5p, miR-329-3p, miR-376c-3p and miR-495-3p) were identified to play an important role in cell proliferation and survival. Diabetes mellitus significantly downregulated miR-30c-5p, while it upregulated miR-329-3p, miR-376c-3p and miR-495-3p. MS analysis revealed proapoptotic voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1) as a direct target for miR-30c-5p, and cell cycle regulator, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 6 (CDK6), as the direct target for miR-329-3p, miR-376c-3p and miR-495-3p. Western blot analyses showed a marked increase in VDAC1 expression, while CDK6 expression was downregulated in diabetic CPCs. Finally, in vitro and in vivo overexpression of miR-30c-5p markedly reduced the apoptotic cell death and preserved MMP in diabetic CPCs via inhibition of VDAC1.\nOur results demonstrate that diabetes mellitus induces a marked dysregulation of miRNAs associated with stem cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, and that therapeutic overexpression of prosurvival miR-30c-5p reduced diabetes-induced cell death and loss of MMP in CPCs via the newly identified target for miR-30c-5p, VDAC1.", "journal": "Diabetologia", "date": "2021-03-04", "authors": ["NimaPurvis", "SwetaKumari", "DhananjieChandrasekera", "JayanthiBellae Papannarao", "SophieGandhi", "Isabellevan Hout", "SeanCoffey", "RichardBunton", "RamanenSugunesegran", "DominicParry", "PhilipDavis", "Michael J AWilliams", "AndrewBahn", "RajeshKatare"], "doi": "10.1007/s00125-021-05405-7\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2018.10.002\n10.1002/stem.2661\n10.1126/science.aam5894\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60608-5\n10.1161/RES.0000000000000252\n10.1161/RES.0000000000000248\n10.1016/j.tcm.2019.08.009\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147780.30124.CF\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309281\n10.1093/cvr/cvs291\n10.1002/cbf.3354\n10.1007/s00395-018-0703-0\n10.1016/j.tips.2018.02.010\n10.1186/s12933-019-0814-4\n10.1152/ajpheart.00520.2017\n10.1093/cvr/cvw235\n10.1042/CS20160916\n10.1038/s41418-017-0047-6\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109447\n10.1007/s10495-020-01609-1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317604\n10.1007/978-1-4939-9631-5_13\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.08.161\n10.1210/jc.2018-00684\n10.1093/nar/gkt393\n10.1093/nar/gku1104\n10.1093/nar/gkm995\n10.7554/eLife.05005\n10.1093/nar/gkw937\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.08.008\n10.1089/scd.2011.0678\n10.1073/pnas.0802876105\n10.1182/blood-2014-06-584417\n10.1038/embor.2009.249\n10.1161/01.RES.0000231289.63468.08\n10.1038/ncomms7930\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.239111\n10.1016/j.jphs.2019.07.005\n10.1093/cvr/cvz140\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.11.178\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0262\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.304747\n10.1002/jcb.26490\n10.1089/scd.2013.0609\n10.1016/j.febslet.2008.03.057\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.182535\n10.1007/s11010-016-2729-7\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.04.020"}

However, the effects and molecular mechanism of Cd toxicity in the chicken heart remain largely unknown. The goal of our study was to investigate the cardiac injury in chickens' exposure to Cd. We detected the levels of oxidative stress-related molecules in the Cd-induced chicken heart, and assessed the histopathological changes by hematoxylin and eosin staining. RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed mRNAs between the Cd-induced group and control group. The expression of candidate genes involved in oxidative stress was certified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Our results showed that the expression of glutathione, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase was significantly decreased and malondialdehyde was increased in the heart of chickens by Cd induction. The disorderly arranged cardiomyocytes, swelled and enlarged cells, partial cardiomyocyte necrosis, blurred morphological structure, and notable inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in the Cd-induced chicken heart. RNA sequencing identified 23 upregulated and 11 downregulated mRNAs in the heart tissues of the chicken in the Cd-induced group, and functional pathways indicated that they were associated with oxidative stress. Moreover, CREM, DUSP8, and ITGA11 expressions were significantly reduced, whereas LAMA1 expression was induced in heart tissue of chickens by Cd treatment.

{"title": "MiR-23a Is Involved in Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Directly Targeting CX43 and Regulating Mitophagy.", "abstract": "Activation of CX43 signaling protects myocardial cells from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well known to play important roles in the progression of diverse diseases. Here, we first confirmed the expression profile of CX43 in rat heart tissues with I/R injury. Then, microRNAs (miRNAs) that target CX43 were predicted using miRDB, miRWalk, and TargetScan. The candidate miR-23a was selected, and its expression level in I/R samples was investigated. To determine the role of miR-23a, rat primary myocardial cells were transfected with miR-23a mimics after they were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury. Transfection of miR-23a mimics stimulated mitophagy through the PINK1/Parkin pathway and downregulated the protein level of CX43.

{"title": "Lumped-Parameter and Finite Element Modeling of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.", "abstract": "Scientific efforts in the field of computational modeling of cardiovascular diseases have largely focused on heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), broadly overlooking heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which has more recently become a dominant form of heart failure worldwide. Motivated by the paucity of HFpEF in silico representations, two distinct computational models are presented in this paper to simulate the hemodynamics of HFpEF resulting from left ventricular pressure overload. First, an object-oriented lumped-parameter model was developed using a numerical solver. This model is based on a zero-dimensional (0D) Windkessel-like network, which depends on the geometrical and mechanical properties of the constitutive elements and offers the advantage of low computational costs. Second, a finite element analysis (FEA) software package was utilized for the implementation of a multidimensional simulation. The FEA model combines three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics models of the electro-mechanical cardiac response, structural deformations, and fluid cavity-based hemodynamics and utilizes a simplified lumped-parameter model to define the flow exchange profiles among different fluid cavities. Through each approach, both the acute and chronic hemodynamic changes in the left ventricle and proximal vasculature resulting from pressure overload were successfully simulated. Specifically, pressure overload was modeled by reducing the orifice area of the aortic valve, while chronic remodeling was simulated by reducing the compliance of the left ventricular wall. Consistent with the scientific and clinical literature of HFpEF, results from both models show (i) an acute elevation of transaortic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta and a reduction in the stroke volume and (ii) a chronic decrease in the end-diastolic left ventricular volume, indicative of diastolic dysfunction. Finally, the FEA model demonstrates that stress in the HFpEF myocardium is remarkably higher than in the healthy heart tissue throughout the cardiac cycle.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2021-03-02", "authors": ["LucaRosalia", "CaglarOzturk", "Ellen TRoche"], "doi": "10.3791/62167"}

The cardiac phenotype includes cardiomyopathy with eventual heart failure. Lysosome-mediated degradation processes, such as autophagy, maintain cellular homeostasis by discarding cellular debris and damaged organelles.

In this issue of the JCI, Ikeda et al. report on their exploration of the signaling pathway involved with regulating lysosomal proteins specifically in the heart. The researchers generated a mouse model for LSD that was restricted to cardiac tissue. Unexpectedly, modulation of TFEB alone was insufficient to fully rescue the underlying clearance defect in lysosomal-associated disorders. The authors identified the Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TFEB signaling pathway as a key regulator of autophagosomes.

{"title": "A Review on Novel Ligand Targeted Delivery for Cardiovascular Disorder.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases cover various disorders like ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, hypertension, etc. There are many synthetic drugs available for the treatment of cardiovascular therapy. However, they have several drawbacks like high dosing, toxicity, elevated blood potassium levels, low blood pressure, gastrointestinal issues, etc. To overcome these side effects of synthetic drugs, targeting the drug to the specific cardiac tissue is the best novel method in cardiovascular therapy. The highest targeting efficacy of ligand- based therapy with proper mechanisms and improved expandability provides a novel therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular diseases. Ligand therapy is more cost-effective compared to cell- based therapy. The surface area of protein is much larger than the orally bioavailable drug. Therefore, the targeting of various less active drug molecules to the particular ligand can be possible. The efficacy of ligands to induce cardiomyocytes proliferation has been ratified. The fact that ligand- based approaches are effective for cardiac transformation has been pointed out. Ligands interact with proteins in target cells, which are influenced by chemical signals. These various receptors selectively bind to biased ligands and energize the intracellular signaling pathway. The ligands can directly stabilize the active receptor conformations by a non-standard connective site. The key function of ligands is functional selectivity, which enhances the therapeutic efficacy and minimizes the side effects of drugs through the interpretation of signal transduction pathways.

The review captures the application of microneedles to the oral mucosa, the eye, vagina, gastric mucosa, nail, scalp, and vascular tissues for delivery of vaccines, biologics, drugs, and diagnostic agents. The technology has created easy access to the poorly accessible segments of eye to facilitate delivery of monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic agents in management of neovascular disease. Microporation has been reported to drastically improve the drug delivery through the poorly permeable nail plate. Curved microneedles and spatially designed microneedle cuffs have been found to be capable of delivering stem cells and therapeutic macromolecules directly to the cardiac tissue and the vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively. Besides being minimally invasive and patient compliant, the technology has the potential to offer viable solutions to deliver drugs through impermeable barriers owing to the ability to penetrate several biological barriers.

{"title": "Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, 3D cardiac structures, and heart-on-a-chip as tools for drug research.", "abstract": "Development of new drugs is of high interest for the field of cardiac and cardiovascular diseases, which are a dominant cause of death worldwide. Before being allowed to be used and distributed, every new potentially therapeutic compound must be strictly validated during preclinical and clinical trials. The preclinical studies usually involve the in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Due to the increasing reporting of discrepancy in drug effects in animal and humans and the requirement to reduce the number of animals used in research, improvement of in vitro models based on human cells is indispensable. Primary cardiac cells are difficult to access and maintain in cell culture for extensive experiments; therefore, the human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) became an excellent alternative. This technology enables a production of high number of patient- and disease-specific cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cell types for a large-scale research. The drug effects can be extensively evaluated in the context of electrophysiological responses with a use of well-established tools, such as multielectrode array (MEA), patch clamp, or calcium ion oscillation measurements. Cardiotoxicity, which is a common reason for withdrawing drugs from marketing or rejection at final stages of clinical trials, can be easily verified with a use of hiPSC-CM model providing a prediction of human-specific responses and higher safety of clinical trials involving patient cohort. Abovementioned studies can be performed using two-dimensional cell culture providing a high-throughput and relatively lower costs. On the other hand, more complex structures, such as engineered heart tissue, organoids, or spheroids, frequently applied as co-culture systems, represent more physiological conditions and higher maturation rate of hiPSC-derived cells. Furthermore, heart-on-a-chip technology has recently become an increasingly popular tool, as it implements controllable culture conditions, application of various stimulations and continuous parameters read-out. This paper is an overview of possible use of cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cell types derived from hiPSC as in vitro models of heart in drug research area prepared on the basis of latest scientific

{"title": "Cardiac transplantation outcomes in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Amyloid cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a progressive and life-threatening disease caused by abnormal protein deposits within cardiac tissue. The most common forms of ACM are caused by immunoglobulin derived light chains (AL) and transthyretin (TTR). Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) remains the definitive treatment for patients with end stage heart failure. In this study, we perform a contemporary multicenter analysis evaluating post OHT survival in patients with ACM.\nWe conducted a multicenter analysis of 40,044 adult OHT recipients captured in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry from 1987-2018. Patients were characterized as ACM or non-ACM. Baseline characteristics were obtained, and summary characteristics were calculated. Outcomes of interest included post-transplant survival, infection, treated rejection, and the ability to return to work. Racial differences in OHT survival were also analyzed. Unadjusted associations between ACM and non-ACM survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier estimations and confounding was addressed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.\nThree hundred ninety-eight patients with a diagnosis of ACM were identified of which 313 underwent heart only OHT. ACM patients were older (61 vs 53; P < .0001) and had a higher proportion of African Americans (30.7% vs 17.6%; P < .0001). Median survival for ACM was 10.2 years vs 12.5 years in non-ACM (P\u202f=\u202f.01). After adjusting for confounding, ACM patients had a higher likelihood of death post-OHT (HR 1.39 CI: 1.14, 1.70; P\u202f=\u202f.001). African American ACM patients had a higher likelihood of survival compared to White ACM patients (HR 0.51 CI 0.31-0.85; P\u202f=\u202f.01).

{"title": "Blunted beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropy in valvular cardiomyopathy: another piece of the puzzle in human aortic valve disease.", "abstract": "Heart failure induced by valvular cardiomyopathy occurs in a substantial proportion of patients undergoing heart valve surgery. We aimed (i) to quantify beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) function by measuring the inotropic effect of isoprenaline in left ventricular (LV) tissue and (ii) to correlate beta-AR-mediated inotropy with clinical markers of heart failure.\nA total of 179 LV myocardial samples were obtained from 104 consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve (AV) surgery between 2017 and 2019. Beta-ARs were stimulated by increasing the concentrations of isoprenaline, followed by a single high concentration of forskolin and calcium. Beta-AR sensitivity was estimated as the concentration to achieve half maximum effects (EC50). Maximum effect size was calculated as the relative beta-AR-mediated inotropic response compared to the force in the presence of high calcium [FISO/Ca (%)]. In vitro data were correlated with the clinical indicators of LV disease.\nFISO/Ca was independent of age and sex and amounted to 79.6\u2009\u00b1\u200920.5%. In a multivariate regression model, we found a significant inverse association between FISO/Ca and preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic diameter increase per 10\u2009mm (OR -9.24, 95% CI -16.66 to -1.82; P\u2009=\u20090.015). Furthermore, patients with end-stage heart failure showed a strong tendency towards more severe reduction of max beta-AR response, as indicated by reduced FISO/Ca in a multivariate model (OR -29.60, 95% CI -61.92 to 2.72; P\u2009=\u20090.055).\nOur study indicates that in vitro myocardial contractility testing can quantify beta-AR dysfunction in patients with AV disease. We found a significant association between reduced beta-AR sensitivity and increased LV diameter, which may indicate a role of beta-AR dysfunction in the development of heart failure in patients with AV disease.", "journal": "European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery", "date": "2021-02-24", "authors": ["JohannesPetersen", "BenjaminKloth", "ShahriaIqbal", "HermannReichenspurner", "BastianGeelhoed", "RenateSchnabel", "ThomasEschenhagen", "TorstenChrist", "EvaldasGirdauskas"], "doi": "10.1093/ejcts/ezab004"}

The outcome of pediatric heart failure treatment is inconsistent, and large cohort studies are lacking. Progress may be achieved through personalized therapy that takes age- and disease-related pathophysiology, pathology, and molecular fingerprints into account. We present single nuclei RNA sequencing from pediatric patients with DCM as the next step in identifying cellular signatures.\nWe performed single nuclei RNA sequencing with heart tissues from 6 children with DCM with an age of 0.5, 0.75, 5, 6, 12, and 13 years. Unsupervised clustering of 18 211 nuclei led to the identification of 14 distinct clusters with 6 major cell types.\nThe number of nuclei in fibroblast clusters increased with age in patients with DCM, a finding that was confirmed by histological analysis and was consistent with an age-related increase in cardiac fibrosis quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Fibroblasts of patients with DCM >6 years of age showed a profoundly altered gene expression pattern with enrichment of genes encoding fibrillary collagens, modulation of proteoglycans, switch in thrombospondin isoforms, and signatures of fibroblast activation. In addition, a population of cardiomyocytes with a high proregenerative profile was identified in infant patients with DCM but was absent in children >6 years of age. This cluster showed high expression of cell cycle activators such as \nNovel insights into the cellular transcriptomes of hearts from pediatric patients with DCM provide remarkable age-dependent changes in the expression patterns of fibroblast and cardiomyocyte genes with less fibrotic but enriched proregenerative signatures in infants.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2021-02-24", "authors": ["LukaNicin", "Wesley TAbplanalp", "AnneSch\u00e4nzer", "AnkeSprengel", "DavidJohn", "HannahMellentin", "LukasTombor", "MatthiasKeuper", "EvelynUllrich", "KarinKlingel", "Reinhard BDettmeyer", "JedrzejHoffmann", "HakanAkintuerk", "ChristianJux", "DietmarSchranz", "Andreas MZeiher", "StefanRupp", "StefanieDimmeler"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.051391"}
{"title": "Effect of doxorubicin on cardiac lipid metabolism-related transcriptome and the protective activity of Alda-1.", "abstract": "The use of doxorubicin (DOX) as an antineoplastic drug is compromised by its cardiotoxicity risk. Although several mechanisms have been proposed for DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, there is still increased interest in assessing its effects. Likewise, it is important to find protocols that can prevent or minimize the side effects of DOX without hindering its antitumor activity. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying DOX cardiotoxicity, with a special focus on cardiac energy metabolism and the ability of Alda-1 (ALDH2 agonist) to prevent DOX-induced cardiac alterations. We explored the effects of DOX on the histological morphology of the myocardium, on lipid profile, and on the expression of genes related to fatty acid metabolism, in the presence and absence of Alda-1 (8\u00a0mg/kg body weight; b.wt.). Two DOX treatment protocols were used: a single dose of DOX (4\u00a0mg/kg b.wt.); four doses of DOX (4\u00a0mg/kg b.wt.), one dose/week, for 4 weeks. Treatment with DOX caused a progressive injury in the cardiac tissue and an increase in the blood total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, very low-density lipoproteins and triglyceride, as well as an up-regulation of FABP4 (DOX and DOX\u00a0+\u00a0Alda-1 groups) and Slc27a2 (in DOX-treated animals). Alda-1 administration promoted reduction in the severity of the histopathological injuries (after single dose of DOX) and Slc27a2 overexpression was restored. In conclusion, the study revealed novel insights regarding the development of DOX-mediated cardiomyopathy, indicating a relationship between DOX exposure and FABP4 and Slc27a2 overexpression, and confirmed the cardioprotective effect of Alda-1.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2021-02-23", "authors": ["Leonardoda Cunha Menezes Souza", "F\u00e1bio HenriqueFernandes", "Paula TorresPresti", "Ana LuciaAnjos Ferreira", "Daisy MariaF\u00e1vero Salvadori"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173955"}

{"title": "A double-edged sword of immuno-microenvironment in cardiac homeostasis and injury repair.", "abstract": "The response of immune cells in cardiac injury is divided into three continuous phases: inflammation, proliferation and maturation. The kinetics of the inflammatory and proliferation phases directly influence the tissue repair. In cardiac homeostasis, cardiac tissue resident macrophages (cTMs) phagocytose bacteria and apoptotic cells. Meanwhile, NK cells prevent the maturation and transport of inflammatory cells. After cardiac injury, cTMs phagocytose the dead cardiomyocytes (CMs), regulate the proliferation and angiogenesis of cardiac progenitor cells. NK cells prevent the cardiac fibrosis, and promote vascularization and angiogenesis. Type 1 macrophages trigger the cardioprotective responses and promote tissue fibrosis in the early stage. Reversely, type 2 macrophages promote cardiac remodeling and angiogenesis in the late stage. Circulating macrophages and neutrophils firstly lead to chronic inflammation by secreting proinflammatory cytokines, and then release anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, which regulate cardiac remodeling. In this process, dendritic cells (DCs) mediate the regulation of monocyte and macrophage recruitment. Recruited eosinophils and Mast cells (MCs) release some mediators which contribute to coronary vasoconstriction, leukocyte recruitment, formation of new blood vessels, scar formation. In adaptive immunity, effector T cells, especially Th17 cells, lead to the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis, including the distal fibrosis and scar formation. CMs protectors, Treg cells, inhibit reduce the inflammatory response, then directly trigger the regeneration of local progenitor cell via IL-10.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) is the main therapeutic target following ischemia as it regulates nerve cell channels. However, few studies have investigated its role in myocardial electrical remodeling. The present study aimed to investigate the role of GSK-3\u03b2 in a rat myocardial infarction (MI)-induced electrical remodeling and potential effects on cardiac ionic channels including KCNJ2/Kir2.1/I\nLigation of the left anterior descending artery in rats was performed to establish a MI model. The rats were randomly divided into three groups, the sham, MI, and MI + SB group. The animals in the latter group were administered SB216763 (GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor) at a dose of 0.6 mg\u00b7kg\nThe results revealed that SB216763 ameliorated acute cardiac injury and improved myocardial dysfunction. Moreover, SB216763 increased the mRNA and protein expression of Kir2.1 during MI. Furthermore, SB216763 treatment abrogated the decreased expression of Kir2.1 in H9c2 cells under hypoxic conditions.\nGSK-3\u03b2 inhibition upregulates Kir2.1 expression in a rat model of MI.", "journal": "Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing", "date": "2021-02-22", "authors": ["ChengChang", "Shu-HuiWang", "Li-NaXu", "Xue-LingSu", "Yi-FanZeng", "PengWang", "Li-RongZhang", "Sheng-NaHan"], "doi": "10.1007/s10840-021-00963-7\n10.1056/NEJMra1606915\n10.21037/atm.2016.06.33\n10.1038/s41598-018-25147-8\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2017.12.010\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.11.103\n10.1002/cam4.686\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2020.118745\n10.3389/fnmol.2012.00080\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.026\n10.1016/j.jphs.2017.05.004\n10.1016/j.gene.2015.11.047\n10.1007/s10557-015-6598-1\n10.1136/bjsm.10.1.22\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.09.009\n10.1161/01.RES.0000122392.33172.09\n10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311673\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1016/j.etap.2016.01.004\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.018\n10.1038/s41598-018-19822-z\n10.1016/j.mcna.2019.05.004\n10.2174/1389450116666150531162212\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2015.01.011\n10.1159/000447810\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.10.034\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.06.005\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2008.00085.x\n10.1007/s11010-009-0377-x\n10.1093/cvr/cvw048\n10.3389/fcvm.2015.00026\n10.1371/journal.pone.0177600\n10.1152/ajpheart.00228.2016\n10.1113/EP087531"}
{"title": "Stem cell-based therapies for cardiac diseases: The critical role of angiogenic exosomes.", "abstract": "Finding effective treatments for cardiac diseases is among the hottest subjects in medicine; cell-based therapies have brought great promises for managing a broad range of life-threatening heart complications such as myocardial infarction. After clarifying the critical role of angiogenesis in tissue repair and regeneration, various stem/progenitor cell were utilized to accelerate the healing of injured cardiac tissue. Embryonic, fetal, adult, and induced pluripotent stem cells have shown the appropriate proangiogenic potential for tissue repair strategies. The capability of stem cells for differentiating into endothelial lineages was initially introduced as the primary mechanism involved in improving angiogenesis and accelerated heart tissue repair. However, recent studies have demonstrated the leading role of paracrine factors secreted by stem cells in advancing neo-vessel formation. Genetically modified stem cells are also being applied for promoting angiogenesis regarding their ability to considerably overexpress and secrete angiogenic bioactive molecules. Yet, conducting further research seems necessary to precisely identify molecular mechanisms behind the proangiogenic potential of stem cells, including the signaling pathways and regulatory molecules such as microRNAs. In conclusion, stem cells' pivotal roles in promoting angiogenesis and consequent improved cardiac healing and remodeling processes should not be ignored, especially in the case of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles.", "journal": "BioFactors (Oxford, England)", "date": "2021-02-20", "authors": ["SaraGhodrat", "Seyed JavadHoseini", "ShivaAsadpour", "SiminNazarnezhad", "FaribaAlizadeh Eghtedar", "SaeidKargozar"], "doi": "10.1002/biof.1717"}
{"title": "Long-term electronic cigarette exposure induces cardiovascular dysfunction similar to tobacco cigarettes: role of nicotine and exposure duration.", "abstract": "Electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping (ECV) has been proposed as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarette smoking (TCS); however, this remains controversial due to a lack of long-term comparative studies. Therefore, we developed a chronic mouse exposure model that mimics human vaping and allows comparison with TCS. Longitudinal studies were performed to evaluate alterations in cardiovascular function with TCS and ECV exposure durations of up to 60 wk. For ECV, e-cig liquid with box-mod were used and for TCS, 3R4F-cigarettes. C57/BL6 male mice were exposed 2 h/day, 5 days/wk to TCS, ECV, or air control. The role of vape nicotine levels was evaluated using e-cig-liquids with 0, 6, or 24 mg/mL nicotine. Following 16-wk exposure, increased constriction to phenylephrine and impaired endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation were observed in aortic segents, paralleling the onset of systemic hypertension, with elevations in systemic vascular resistance. Following 32 wk, TCS and ECV induced cardiac hypertrophy. All of these abnormalities further increased out to 60 wk of exposure, with elevated heart weight and aortic thickness along with increased superoxide production in vessels and cardiac tissues of both ECV and TCS mice.

{"title": "Human iPSC-engineered cardiac tissue platform faithfully models important cardiac physiology.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CM) may provide an important bridge between animal models and the intact human myocardium. Fulfilling this potential is hampered by their relative immaturity, leading to poor physiological responsiveness. hiPSC-CMs grown in traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture lack a t-tubular system, have only rudimentary intracellular calcium-handling systems, express predominantly embryonic sarcomeric protein isoforms, and preferentially use glucose as an energy substrate. Culturing hiPSC-CM in a variety of three-dimensional (3D) environments and the addition of nutritional, pharmacological, and electromechanical stimuli have proven, to various degrees, to be beneficial for maturation. We present a detailed assessment of a novel model in which hiPSC-CMs and hiPSC-derived cardiac fibroblasts are cocultured in a 3D fibrin matrix to form engineered cardiac tissue constructs (hiPSC-ECTs). The hiPSC-ECTs are responsive to physiological stimuli, including stretch, frequency, and \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, develop a t-tubular system, and demonstrate calcium-handling and contractile kinetics that compare favorably with ventricular human myocardium. Furthermore, transcript levels of various genes involved in calcium-handling and contraction are increased. These markers of maturation become more robust over a relatively short period of time in culture (6\u2009wk vs. 2\u2009wk in hiPSC-ECTs). A comparison of the hiPSC-ECT molecular and performance variables with those of human cardiac tissue and other available engineered tissue platforms is provided to aid selection of the most appropriate platform for the research question at hand. Important and noteworthy aspects of this human cardiac model system are its reliance on \"off-the-shelf\" equipment, ability to provide detailed physiological performance data, and the ability to achieve a relatively mature cardiac physiology without additional nutritional, pharmacological, and electromechanical stimuli that may elicit unintended effects on function.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Estimating cardiac active tension from wall motion-An inverse problem of cardiac biomechanics.", "abstract": "The contraction of the human heart is a complex process as a consequence of the interaction of internal and external forces. In current clinical routine, the resulting deformation can be imaged during an entire heart beat. However, the active tension development cannot be measured in vivo but may provide valuable diagnostic information. In this work, we present a novel numerical method for solving an inverse problem of cardiac biomechanics-estimating the dynamic active tension field, provided the motion of the myocardial wall is known. This ill-posed non-linear problem is solved using second order Tikhonov regularization in space and time. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by varying the fiber orientation in the range of measurement accuracy. To achieve RMSE <20% of the maximal tension, the fiber orientation needs to be provided with an accuracy of 10\u00b0. Also, variation was added to the deformation data in the range of segmentation accuracy. Here, imposing temporal regularization led to an eightfold decrease in the error down to 12%. Furthermore, non-contracting regions representing myocardial infarct scars were introduced in the left ventricle and could be identified accurately in the inverse solution (sensitivity >0.95). The results obtained with non-matching input data are promising and indicate directions for further improvement of the method. In future, this method will be extended to estimate the active tension field based on motion data from clinical images, which could provide important insights in terms of a new diagnostic tool for the identification and treatment of diseased heart tissue.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2021-02-20", "authors": ["EkaterinaKovacheva", "LauraTh\u00e4mer", "ThomasFritz", "GunnarSeemann", "MarcoOchs", "OlafD\u00f6ssel", "AxelLoewe"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.3448"}
{"title": "Anthocyanin Protects Cardiac Function and Cardiac Fibroblasts From High-Glucose Induced Inflammation and Myocardial Fibrosis by Inhibiting IL-17.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the major causes of death in diabetic patients. Its pathogenesis involves inflammation and fibrosis that damages the heart tissue and impairs cardiac function. Interleukin (IL)-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in a variety of chronic inflammatory processes can serve as an attractive therapeutic target. Anthocyanin, a water-soluble natural pigment, possesses impressive anti-inflammatory activity. However, its role in DCM is unclear. Hence, we investigated the protective effect of anthocyanin on the cardiovascular complications of diabetes using a mouse type 1 diabetes mellitus model induced by streptozotocin. Cardiac function and structural alterations in diabetic mice were tested by echocardiography, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and Masson trichrome staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the distribution and deposition of IL-17 and collagen I and III from the left ventricular tissues of diabetic mice. Cell viability was measured using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. Protein levels of IL-17, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-17 and collagen I and III were detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence, and their mRNA levels were quantified using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We observed that anthocyanin lowered blood glucose, improved cardiac function, and alleviated inflammation and fibrosis in the heart tissue of diabetic mice. Meanwhile, anthocyanin reduced the expression of IL-17 in high-glucose-treated cardiac fibroblasts and exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect. Deposition of collagen I and III was also decreased by anthocyanin, suggesting that anthocyanin contributes to alleviating myocardial fibrosis. In summary, anthocyanin could protect cardiac function and inhibit IL-17-related inflammation and fibrosis, which indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetes mellitus-related complications.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2021-02-20", "authors": ["ErYue", "YahanYu", "XinyaoWang", "BingLiu", "YunlongBai", "BaofengYang"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2020.593633\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.11.064\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03356.x\n10.1016/j.jaut.2012.12.013\n10.1016/j.molmed.2016.01.001\n10.4049/jimmunol.1800189\n10.3390/nu11092107\n10.3390/ijms20143394\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.12.020\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.05.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314665\n10.1002/kjm2.12229\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2015.05.007\n10.1177/0960327112450885\n10.1093/jnci/59.3.941\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304108\n10.1038/cddis.2016.490\n10.1186/s12933-019-0816-2\n10.1007/s10620-019-05969-w\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.863\n10.1007/s00441-018-2974-z\n10.1002/glia.23530\n10.1016/j.jhep.2014.12.011\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03240.x\n10.1016/j.tips.2018.02.010\n10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-15-0091\n10.1016/0022-2828(81)90318-7\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.108874\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00243\n10.1155/2015/728741\n10.2337/db11-0477\n10.1161/01.res.49.6.1268\n10.1016/j.phrs.2012.11.008\n10.1177/1074248419876632\n10.1016/j.jaci.2016.07.025\n10.1002/ptr.6485\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.10.007\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.10.010\n10.1038/s41419-018-1029-4\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.06.026\n10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.223\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.01.001\n10.1007/s00109-014-1176-8\n10.1096/fj.201701242RR\n10.1080/21691401.2019.1687492"}
{"title": "ShengMai-San Attenuates Cardiac Remodeling in Diabetic Rats by Inhibiting NOX-Mediated Oxidative Stress.", "abstract": "ShengMai-San (SMS) is traditionally used to treat ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Recently, several studies have reported the cardioprotective effects of SMS in diabetic animals. However, the potential mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether SMS exerts a beneficial effect in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) by alleviating NADPH oxidase (NOX)-mediated oxidative stress.\nSD rats were randomly divided into a negative control\u00a0group (NC), diabetes mellitus group (DM) and SMS-treated group (SMS). The myocardial structure alterations, apoptosis and biomarkers of oxidative stress were observed. Moreover, to explore the protective mechanism of SMS, the activation of AMPK\u03b1, expression and translocation of NOX-related proteins were assessed.\nDiabetes led to excessive collagen content, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the myocardium. Oxidative stress in diabetic hearts was indicated by low levels of T-AOC, high levels of 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 and 8-OHdG, inactivation of AMPK\u03b1, elevated expression of NOX2 and NOX4 and translocation of NOX isoforms p47phox and p67phox. Treatment with SMS for 10 weeks resulted in the alleviation of diabetes-associated myocardial structure abnormalities and apoptosis. Additionally, SMS attenuated the accumulation of oxidative stress markers in myocardial tissue. Further investigation showed that SMS was able to reverse the levels of oxidative stress-associated proteins NOX2 and NOX4 in the DM rats. Moreover, SMS treatment blunted the translocation of NADPH oxidase isoforms p47phox and p67phox as well. Furthermore, SMS promoted the activation of AMPK in the cardiac tissue of diabetic rats.\nThese findings indicate that SMS exhibits therapeutic properties against diabetic cardiomyopathy by attenuating myocardial oxidative damage via activation of AMPK\u03b1 and inhibition of NOX signaling.", "journal": "Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy", "date": "2021-02-20", "authors": ["YantingLu", "ShuZhu", "XiaoyanWang", "JuhaiLiu", "YingyingLi", "WeiWang", "ShijunWang", "FurongWang"], "doi": "10.2147/DMSO.S287582\n10.1016/j.diabres.2018.02.023\n10.1016/S2213-8587(16)30010-9\n10.1111/jdi.12250\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00012\n10.1016/S0254-6272(11)60044-7\n10.1155/2016/4621235\n10.1159/000494791\n10.1186/s13287-020-01633-7\n10.1385/CT:3:3:219\n10.1152/ajpheart.00053.2004\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.10.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098044\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.04.180\n10.1155/2017/2070178\n10.1155/2013/461967\n10.1155/2020/3732718\n10.1155/2020/5732956\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.11.128\n10.1007/s12265-012-9387-2\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.07.046\n10.1016/j.molp.2020.07.002\n10.1002/stem.1213\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173206\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.07.025\n10.3892/ijmm.2018.4005\n10.3109/0886022X.2012.668491\n10.14336/AD.2019.0901\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.01.025\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.155762"}

We found that porcine expression of the mesoderm marker FLK1 and the cardiac progenitor marker ISL1 was in line with our differentiating hiPSC and reported murine expression. The cardiac lineage marker NKX2.5 was expressed at almost all stages in the pig and hiPSC, with an earlier onset in the hiPSC compared with reported murine expression. Markers of immature cardiomyocytes, CTNT, and MYHC-B were consistently expressed throughout E16-E70 in the pig, which is comparable with mouse development, whereas the markers increased over time in the hiPSC. However, the commonly used mature cardiomyocyte marker, CX43, should be used with caution, as it was also expressed in the pig mesoderm, as well as hiPSC immature cardiomyocytes, while this has not been reported in mice. Based on our observations in the various species, we suggest to use FLK1/PDGFR-\u03b1 for identifying cardiac mesoderm and ISL1/NKX2.5 for cardiac progenitors.

{"title": "Enabling forward uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis in cardiac electrophysiology by reduced order modeling and machine learning.", "abstract": "We present a new, computationally efficient framework to perform forward uncertainty quantification (UQ) in cardiac electrophysiology. We consider the monodomain model to describe the electrical activity in the cardiac tissue, coupled with the Aliev-Panfilov model to characterize the ionic activity through the cell membrane. We address a complete forward UQ pipeline, including both: (i) a variance-based global sensitivity analysis for the selection of the most relevant input parameters, and (ii) a way to perform uncertainty propagation to investigate the impact of intra-subject variability on outputs of interest depending on the cardiac potential. Both tasks exploit stochastic sampling techniques, thus implying overwhelming computational costs because of the huge amount of queries to the high-fidelity, full-order computational model obtained by approximating the coupled monodomain/Aliev-Panfilov system through the finite element method. To mitigate this computational burden, we replace the full-order model with computationally inexpensive projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) aimed at reducing the state-space dimensionality. Resulting approximation errors on the outputs of interest are finally taken into account through artificial neural network (ANN)-based models, enhancing the accuracy of the whole UQ pipeline. Numerical results show that the proposed physics-based ROMs outperform regression-based emulators relying on ANNs built with the same amount of training data, in terms of both numerical accuracy and overall computational efficiency.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2021-02-19", "authors": ["StefanoPagani", "AndreaManzoni"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.3450\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00721"}

For this study, groups of male Wistar rats were used after intraperitoneal injection of 20, 100 and 200\u00a0\u00b5g/Kg with BD-15. The groups were treated for three consecutive days and the control group received 0.9% saline. BD-15 did not alter behavior of rats treated with different doses. An increase in the specific \u03b12,3-Na, K-ATPase activity was observed for all doses of BD-15 tested in the hippocampus. However, in the prefrontal cortex, only the dose of 100\u00a0\u00b5g/Kg increased the activity of all Na, K-ATPase isoforms. BD-15 did not cause alteration in the lipid peroxidation levels in the hippocampus, but in the prefrontal cortex, a decrease of lipid peroxidation (~\u200925%) was observed. In the hippocampus, GSH levels increased with all doses tested, while in the prefrontal cortex no changes were found. Subsequently, when the effect of BD-15 on cardiac tissue was analyzed, no changes were observed in the tested parameters. BD-15 at a dosage of 100\u00a0\u00b5g/Kg proved to be promising because it is considered therapeutic for brain disorders, since it increases the activity of the \u03b13-Na, K-ATPase in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, as well as decreasing the oxidative stress in these brain regions.

However, the functions of a certain miRNA in different cardiac cell types during HF are scarcely reported, which might be covered by the globe effects of it on the heart. In the current study, Langendorff system was applied to isolate cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) from transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced mice. Slight increase of miR-320 expression was observed in the whole heart tissue of TAC mice. Interestingly, miR-320 was significantly elevated in CMs but decreased in CFs from TAC mice at different time points. Then, recombinant adeno-associated virus 9 with cell-type-specific promoters were used to manipulate miR-320 expressions in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed the miR-320 overexpression in CMs exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, whereas overexpression of miR-320 in CFs alleviated cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy. Mechanically, downstream signaling pathway analyses revealed that miR-320 might induce various effects via targeting PLEKHM3 and IFITM1 in CMs and CFs, respectively. Moreover, miR-320 mediated effects could be abolished by PLEKHM3 re-expression in CMs or IFITM1 re-expression in CFs. Interestingly, miR-320 treated CFs were able to indirectly affect CMs function, but not vice versa. Meanwhile, upstream signaling pathway analyses showed that miR-320 expression and decay rate were rigorously manipulated by Ago2, which was regulated by a cluster of cell-type-specific TFs distinctively expressed in CMs and CFs, respectively.

Methods and Results COVID MECH (COVID-19 Mechanisms) was a prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19. Biobank plasma samples used to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were collected in 123 patients at baseline, and in 96 patients (78%) at day 3.

High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is often used for neonates with refractory respiratory failure related to RDS. Volume guarantee (VG) mode has been added to some HFOV ventilators for providing consistent tidal volume. We sought to examine the impact of adding the VG mode during HFOV on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics, which has not been studied to date. A neonatal piglet model of moderate to severe RDS was induced by saline lavage. Piglets (full term, age 1-3 days, weight 1.5-2.4 kg) were randomized to have RDS induced and receive either HFOV or HFOV+VG (n = 8/group) or sham-operation (n = 6) without RDS. Cardiac function measured by a Millar\u00ae catheter placed in the left ventricle as well as systemic and carotid hemodynamic and oxygen tissue saturation parameters were collected over 240 min of ventilation. Mean airway pressure, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and left ventricular cardiac index of piglets on HFOV vs. HFOV+VG were not significantly different during the experimental period. Right common carotid artery flow index by in-situ ultrasonic flow measurement and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (near-infrared spectroscopy) significantly decreased in HFOV+VG at 240 min compared to HFOV (14 vs. 31 ml/kg/min, and 30% vs. 43%, respectively; p<0.05).

Thus, we investigated the influence of IL-17 on calcium handling process and its contribution to the development of heart failure. Mice were subjected to transaortic constriction (TAC) to induce heart failure. In these mice, the levels of IL-17 in the plasma and cardiac tissue were significantly increased compared with the sham group. In 77 heart failure patients, the plasma level of IL-17 was significantly higher than 49 non-failing subjects, and was negatively correlated with cardiac ejection fraction and fractional shortening. In IL-17 knockout mice, the shortening of isolated ventricular myocytes was increased compared with that in wild-type mice, which was accompanied by significantly increased amplitude of calcium transient and the upregulation of SERCA2a and Cav1.2. In cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes, treatment of with IL-17 (0.1, 1\u2009ng/mL) concentration-dependently suppressed the amplitude of calcium transient and reduced the expression of SERCA2a and Cav1.2. Furthermore, IL-17 treatment increased the expression of the NF-\u03baB subunits p50 and p65, whereas knockdown of p50 reversed the inhibitory effects of IL-17 on SERCA2a and Cav1.2 expression. In mice with TAC-induced mouse heart, IL-17 knockout restored the expression of SERCA2a and Cav1.2, increased the amplitude of calcium transient and cell shortening, and in turn improved cardiac function. In addition, IL-17 knockout attenuated cardiac hypertrophy with inhibition of calcium-related signaling pathway. In conclusion, upregulation of IL-17 impairs cardiac function through NF-\u03baB-mediated disturbance of calcium handling and cardiac remodeling.

{"title": "Induction of Wnt signaling antagonists and p21-activated kinase enhances cardiomyocyte proliferation during zebrafish heart regeneration.", "abstract": "Heart regeneration occurs by dedifferentiation and proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes (CMs). However, the signaling mechanisms by which injury induces CM renewal remain incompletely understood. Here, we find that cardiac injury in zebrafish induces expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitors, including Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), Dkk3, secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFrp1), and sFrp2, in cardiac tissue adjacent to injury sites. Experimental blocking of Wnt activity via Dkk1 overexpression enhances CM proliferation and heart regeneration, whereas ectopic activation of Wnt8 signaling blunts injury-induced CM dedifferentiation and proliferation. Although Wnt signaling is dampened upon injury, the cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin is unexpectedly increased at disarrayed CM sarcomeres in myocardial wound edges. Our analyses indicated that p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) is induced at regenerating CMs, where it phosphorylates cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin at Ser 675 and increases its stability at disassembled sarcomeres. Myocardial-specific induction of the phospho-mimetic \u03b2-catenin (S675E) enhances CM dedifferentiation and sarcomere disassembly in response to injury. Conversely, inactivation of Pak2 kinase activity reduces the Ser 675-phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (pS675-\u03b2-catenin) and attenuates CM sarcomere disorganization and dedifferentiation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that coordination of Wnt signaling inhibition and Pak2/pS675-\u03b2-catenin signaling enhances zebrafish heart regeneration by supporting CM dedifferentiation and proliferation.", "journal": "Journal of molecular cell biology", "date": "2021-02-15", "authors": ["XiangwenPeng", "Kaa SengLai", "PeiluShe", "JunsuKang", "TingtingWang", "GuobaoLi", "YatingZhou", "JianjianSun", "DaqingJin", "XiaoleiXu", "LujianLiao", "JiandongLiu", "EthanLee", "Kenneth DPoss", "Tao PZhong"], "doi": "10.1093/jmcb/mjaa046"}
{"title": "Hypertrophic signaling compensates for contractile and metabolic consequences of DNA methyltransferase 3A loss in human cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "The role of DNA methylation in cardiomyocyte physiology and cardiac disease remains a matter of controversy. We have recently provided evidence for an important role of DNMT3A in human cardiomyocyte cell homeostasis and metabolism, using engineered heart tissue (EHT) generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes carrying a knockout of the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. Unlike isogenic control EHT, knockout EHT displayed morphological abnormalities such as lipid accumulations inside cardiomyocytes associated with impaired mitochondrial metabolism, as well as functional defects and impaired glucose metabolism. Here, we analyzed the role of DNMT3A in the setting of cardiac hypertrophy. We induced hypertrophic signaling by treatment with 50\u00a0nM endothelin-1 and 20\u00a0\u03bcM phenylephrine for one week and assessed EHT contractility, morphology, DNA methylation, and gene expression. While both knockout EHTs and isogenic controls showed the expected activation of the hypertrophic gene program, knockout EHTs were protected from hypertrophy-related functional impairment. Conversely, hypertrophic treatment prevented the metabolic consequences of a loss of DNMT3A, i.e. abolished lipid accumulation in cardiomyocytes likely by partial normalization of mitochondrial metabolism and restored glucose metabolism and metabolism-related gene expression of knockout EHT.

{"title": "Chagas disease in urban and peri\u2011urban environment in the Amazon: Sentinel hosts, vectors, and the environment.", "abstract": "Chagas disease is an anthropozoonosis, caused by a flagellated protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, in which the enzootic cycle occurs between mammals and triatomines. Two dogs with a history of sudden death were necropsied at the Federal University of Par\u00e1 (UFPA). One dog had a pale area in the myocardium, which on histopathological examination showed a T. cruzi amastigote nest; immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis characterized it as acute Chagas disease (ACD). The second dog showed no macroscopic changes. Microscopically, a few cardiomyocytes were replaced by adipocytes, and IHC result was negative for T. cruzi. However, results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the cardiac tissue of both dogs was positive for T. cruzi DNA. After that, an epidemiological study was conducted in the region. For this study, we selected four areas in Castanhal. One of the four areas (Area 1) is where one of the dogs lived. The other three areas were chosen because they were recently deforested for housing. Blood samples were collected from dogs, cats, wild small mammals (marsupials and rodents), and the digestive tract of triatomines. Nested PCR was performed on all the blood samples and the triatomine digestive tracts. In Area 1, T. cruzi DNA was detected in 50% (12/24) of the tested dogs, in the only tested cat (1/1), 50% (1/2) of the tested marsupials (Didelphis marsupials), and 100% of the captured triatomines (Rhodnius pictipes) (2/2). In Area 2, T. cruzi DNA was not detected in any of the 11 (0/11) dogs and two marsupials tested (0/2), and no triatomines were found in this area. In Area 3, T. cruzi DNA was detected in 42.25% (30/71) of the dogs, in 66,6% (2/3) of the cats, the only captured marsupial (D. marsupialis) (1/1), and all three triatomines (3/3) (R. pictipes) tested. In Area 4, the two dogs tested were negative (0/2), 25% (1/4) of the captured marsupials (D. marsupialis) was positive, and no triatomine was captured in this area. The data demonstrate the importance of detecting T. cruzi in dogs, cats, small rodents, and marsupials in the Amazon metropolitan areas, where ecotopes carry reservoirs and vectors capable of participating in the Chagas disease cycle. The proximity between humans and T. cruzi vectors in these places might contribute to increased disease transmission risk and maintenance of agents. It was noted that high-standard condominiums, previously thought to reduce the risk for this disease, presented a new epidemiological risk. The presence of T. cruzi DNA in a dog who, a year earlier had tested negative, when another dog in the same house died of ACD, shows that the transmission cycle is present and active, with a high possibility of disease transmission to animals and humans.", "journal": "Acta tropica", "date": "2021-02-15", "authors": ["Helyannede Sousa Pereira", "AlessandraScofield", "Pedro Soares BezerraJ\u00fanior", "DanieleLira Dos Santos", "Julyannede Sousa Siqueira", "Jaeze FariasChaves", "Rosekellyde Jesus Cardoso", "Adrielli HeloiseDos Anjos Lima", "Natalia Maxine Ferreira PinheiroSarmento", "Francisco DantasJ\u00fanior", "Flaviade Nazar\u00e9 Barros", "Diana Mariade Farias", "Ricardo Jos\u00e9de Paula Souza E Guimar\u00e3es", "Ana CristinaMendes-Oliveira", "GabrielaRiet-Correa", "Valiria DuarteCerqueira"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.105858"}

It is defined as abnormal enlargement of the left ventricular (LV) cavity with poor LV function due to coronary artery disease. Currently available established treatments are palliative whereby blood supply is recovered to ischemic regions but fails to regenerate heart tissues. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer a promising treatment for ICM given their regenerative and multipotent characteristics. This study aims to investigate the effect of MSCs infusion with concurrent revascularization in patients with severe ICM compared to receiving only revascularization procedure or MSCs infusion.\nTwenty-seven patients with history of anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 35% were recruited into this study. Patients who are eligible for revascularization were grouped into group A (MSCs infusion with concurrent revascularization) or group B (revascularization only) while patients who were not eligible for revascularization were allocated in group C to receive intracoronary MSCs infusion. LV function was measured using echocardiography.\nPatients who received MSCs infusion (either with or without revascularization) demonstrated significant LVEF improvements at 3, 6 and 12 months post-infusion when compared to baseline LVEF within its own group. When comparing the groups, the magnitude of change in LVEF from baseline for third visits i.e., 12 months post-infusion was significant for patients who received MSCs infusion plus concurrent revascularization in comparison to patients who only had the revascularization procedure.\nMSCs infusion significantly improves LV function in ICM patients.

{"title": "Review on Mechanical Support and Cell-Based Therapies for the Prevention and Recovery of the Failed Fontan-Kreutzer Circulation.", "abstract": "Though the current staged surgical strategy for palliation of single ventricle heart disease, culminating in a Fontan circulation, has increased short-term survival, mounting evidence has shown that the single ventricle, especially a morphologic right ventricle (RV), is inadequate for long-term circulatory support. In addition to high rates of ventricular failure, high central venous pressures (CVP) lead to liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, lymphatic dysfunction, kidney failure, and other comorbidities. In this review, we discuss the complications seen with Fontan physiology, including causes of ventricular and multi-organ failure. We then evaluate the clinical use, results, and limitations of long-term mechanical assist devices intended to reduce RV work and high CVP, as well as biological therapies for failed Fontan circulations. Finally, we discuss experimental tissue engineering solutions designed to prevent Fontan circulation failure and evaluate knowledge gaps and needed technology development to realize a more robust single ventricle therapy.", "journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["Margaret RFerrari", "Michael VDi Maria", "Jeffrey GJacot"], "doi": "10.3389/fped.2020.627660\n10.1053/j.pcsu.2010.02.006\n10.1056/NEJM198301063080106\n10.1016/S0022-5223(02)73575-7\n10.1161/01.CIR.31.2.172\n10.1510/icvts.2009.218586\n10.1016/S0003-4975(98)00928-X\n10.1136/hrt.2004.051789\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2013.08.023\n10.1016/S0022-5223(96)70051-X\n10.1007/s00246-012-0430-5\n10.1111/j.1747-0803.2011.00504.x\n10.2147/CEG.S136803\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000696\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.03.004\n10.1056/NEJMc1214222\n10.1016/j.healun.2015.10.015\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.05.020\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.07.065\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2003.08.016\n10.1161/01.cir.0000087442.82569.51\n10.1016/j.healun.2019.04.001\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.548016\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.020\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.815712\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.04.064\n10.1055/s-2004-821017\n10.1097/MAT.0b013e31815a2500\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.2011.01403.x\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.03.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.991505\n10.1097/PCC.0000000000000842\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.02.034\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2006.11.013\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00115\n10.21037/tp.2018.03.03\n10.1053/j.pcsu.2016.09.009\n10.1053/j.pcsu.2015.02.002\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2005.04.023\n10.1016/j.ahj.2011.05.026\n10.1093/icvts/ivx288\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.06.038\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.02.031\n10.1111/tri.12294\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2006.02.015\n10.1111/petr.12607\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.07.086\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2006.08.020\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.02.044\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.10.030\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.11.075\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.01.012\n10.14503/THIJ-13-3374\n10.1016/j.healun.2013.03.003\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.05.018\n10.1016/j.healun.2020.02.007\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2018.04.021\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.08.082\n10.1111/aor.12852\n10.1007/s10047-019-01124-4\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.06.120\n10.1016/j.healun.2005.05.022\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.06.112\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.04.037\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.02.088\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.03.091\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2019.06.017\n10.1097/MAT.0000000000000888\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.07.015\n10.1002/stem.2582\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102796\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304671\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.06.076\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310253\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-070909-105309\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.10.093\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.06.001\n10.1016/j.ahj.2017.06.009\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.12.047\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2009.09.057\n10.1016/j.tcm.2017.06.013\n10.2217/rme.15.85\n10.1177/2041731418764709\n10.1161/hh0302.105722\n10.1038/srep45499\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003918\n10.1016/j.reth.2019.09.001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166963\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.10.019\n10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2017.07.002\n10.1016/j.healun.2009.10.006\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu007\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.047\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2019.03.028\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000003051\n10.1002/ejhf.449\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.01.003\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.114.001478\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.010\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv254\n10.1016/j.ahj.2012.12.022\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.07.012\n10.1002/adhm.201800672\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.035"}

However, the specific mechanism of Arctigenin against myocardial infarction remains largely unknown. Here, both acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (AMI/R) rat model and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced myocardial cell injury model were constructed to explore the underlying role of AMPK/SIRT1 pathway in Arctigenin-mediated effects. The experimental data in our study demonstrated that Arctigenin ameliorated OGD-mediated cardiomyocytes apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, Arctigenin activated AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and downregulated NF-\u03baB phosphorylation in OGD-treated cardiomyocytes, while inhibiting AMPK or SIRT1 by the Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) or SIRT1-IN-1 (a SIRT1 inhibitor) significantly attenuated Arctigenin-exerted protective effects on cardiomyocytes. In the animal experiments, Arctigenin improved the heart functions and decreased infarct size of the AMI/R-rats, accompanied with downregulated oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic levels in the heart tissues. What's more, Arctigenin enhanced the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and repressed NF-\u03baB pathway activation. Taken together, our data indicated that Arctigenin reduced cardiomyocytes apoptosis against AMI/R-induced oxidative stress and inflammation at least via AMPK/SIRT1 pathway.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["Cheng-YinLiu", "YiZhou", "TaoChen", "Jing-ChaoLei", "Xue-JunJiang"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2020.616813\n10.3390/ijms20133153\n10.1371/journal.pone.0217090\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2018.12.005\n10.1038/aps.2018.32\n10.3892/mmr.2018.8482\n10.1002/jcb.25509\n10.1016/j.tcb.2015.10.013\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.07.001\n10.7150/thno.25674\n10.1038/emm.2016.16\n10.1111/j.1939-1676.2012.00905.x\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.11.023\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2020.113302\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243170\n10.1007/s11655-019-3040-810.1007/s11655-019-3040-8\n10.1007/s10571-016-0355-2\n10.1038/s41374-019-0340-8\n10.1248/bpb.b18-00257\n10.1016/j.cbi.2018.01.005\n10.18632/aging.103078\n10.1007/s10753-014-9969-z\n10.1007/s13105-019-00678-4\n10.1002/jcp.29031\n10.2174/1573402111666150529130922\n10.21037/cdt.2020.01.02\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00268\n10.1016/j.jphs.2019.02.008\n10.1007/s10456-020-09720-2\n10.1038/s41434-018-0045-4\n10.1152/ajpheart.00065.2019\n10.1159/000493038\n10.1155/2020/4717258\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.05.003\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.172618\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.062\n10.1042/BSR20194030\n10.3892/mmr.2018.8420\n10.1159/000354532\n10.1007/s00395-019-0773-7\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.02.019\n10.1093/cvr/cvx227\n10.1152/physrev.00026.2013"}
{"title": "Pathways Regulating Establishment and Maintenance of Cardiac Chamber Identity in Zebrafish.", "abstract": "The vertebrate heart is comprised of two types of chambers-ventricles and atria-that have unique morphological and physiological properties. Effective cardiac function depends upon the distinct characteristics of ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes, raising interest in the genetic pathways that regulate chamber-specific traits. Chamber identity seems to be specified in the early embryo by signals that establish ventricular and atrial progenitor populations and trigger distinct differentiation pathways. Intriguingly, chamber-specific features appear to require active reinforcement, even after myocardial differentiation is underway, suggesting plasticity of chamber identity within the developing heart. Here, we review the utility of the zebrafish as a model organism for studying the mechanisms that establish and maintain cardiac chamber identity. By combining genetic and embryological approaches, work in zebrafish has revealed multiple players with potent influences on chamber fate specification and commitment. Going forward, analysis of cardiomyocyte identity at the single-cell level is likely to yield a high-resolution understanding of the pathways that link the relevant players together, and these insights will have the potential to inform future strategies in cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular development and disease", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["YaoYao", "Amanda NMarra", "DeborahYelon"], "doi": "10.3390/jcdd8020013\n10.1152/physrev.00006.2003\n10.1002/1097-0185(20001001)260:2<148::AID-AR50>3.0.CO;2-X\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00033.2003\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.04.017\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00344\n10.1242/dev.124883\n10.1016/j.ceca.2009.10.001\n10.1113/jphysiol.2006.126714\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001\n10.1016/1050-1738(94)90012-4\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.014\n10.1371/journal.pone.0147823\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00137.2011\n10.1038/35047564\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.06.007\n10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1998)22:3<288::AID-DVG10>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.3389/fcell.2019.00013\n10.1038/348728a0\n10.1139/o97-090\n10.1242/dev.143719\n10.1016/j.devcel.2007.05.012\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.034\n10.1038/ncomms14428\n10.1101/2020.07.12.198994\n10.1242/dev.01185\n10.1006/dbio.1993.1276\n10.1016/0012-1606(70)90163-6\n10.1242/dev.00838\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00321-0\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0050053\n10.1242/dev.030924\n10.1242/dev.061473\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.028\n10.1038/nature10094\n10.1242/dev.153411\n10.1038/s41467-018-04402-6\n10.1242/dev.00400\n10.1242/dev.01156\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.06.033\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.09.012\n10.1242/dev.059634\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.02.010\n10.1016/S0925-4773(99)00311-1\n10.1101/gad.11.4.451\n10.1016/j.devcel.2007.11.004\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1007962\n10.1101/gad.13.8.1037\n10.1126/science.283.5405.1161\n10.1128/MCB.21.5.1730-1736.2001\n10.1006/dbio.1999.9548\n10.1006/dbio.2000.9801\n10.1074/jbc.M103716200\n10.1073/pnas.0702447104\n10.1161/01.RES.0000261693.13269.bf\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.03.002\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.12.019\n10.1101/gad.9.13.1654\n10.1101/gad.11.11.1357\n10.1038/s41467-018-03714-x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.261172\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.11.010\n10.1038/nature12322\n10.1002/dvdy.10487\n10.1038/nature09249\n10.7554/eLife.28307\n10.1038/nrg1710\n10.1002/ajmg.a.35896\n10.1038/ncomms9146\n10.7554/eLife.32833\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.04.013\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.079\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000606\n10.1002/humu.9390\n10.1038/s41436-020-00939-4\n10.1007/s00246-019-02099-y\n10.1016/j.ejmg.2017.12.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.619338\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.08.035\n10.1038/s42003-018-0202-8\n10.1038/s41551-018-0271-5\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.006035\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.07.003\n10.1152/ajpcell.00402.2009\n10.1172/jci.insight.99941"}

Therefore, the ability to thoroughly evaluate the angiogenic response following experimentally induced MI in rats, and distinguish it from inflammation, is desired. This would enable evaluation of the angiogenic potential of new therapeutics and improve knowledge on MI pathophysiology. Due to the complex response to MI involving multiple cell types and the limited selection of rat-specific antibodies, careful optimization is crucial to capture this complexity. Here, we present an 8-color flow cytometry-based multicolor panel that will enable quantification of the ongoing angiogenic response as well as characterize the cells involved.

{"title": "Elevated MST1 leads to apoptosis via depletion of YAP1 in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose.", "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for congenital heart defects. The article aimed to investigate the expression and roles of MST1, YAP1, Last1/2 and Survivin in modulating HG-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and maternal diabetes-induced heart abnormality.\nDiabetes mellitus was induced in rats using streptozotocin. The protein expression and phosphorylation analysis in fetal heart tissue was assessed by western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Hoechst 33342 staining assay was performed to explore H9C2 apoptosis. The gene and protein expression in H9C2 cells was assessed by quantitative PCR and western blot. Knockdown of gene expression was assessed by RNA interference.\nOur results revealed that increased MST1 protein levels in the heart tissues of the offspring of diabetic rats in vivo and in H9C2 cardiomyocytes under HG treatment in vitro, respectively. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that MST1 played a key role in mediating HG-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Downregulation of YAP1 was associated with HG-induced, MST1-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Further study showed that MST1 downregulated the protein level of YAP1 through mediation of YAP1 phosphorylation on Ser127 and Ser397; this process also required LATS1/2 participation. MST1 overexpression increased the phosphorylation levels of LATS1/2, which were also shown to be increased in the heart tissues of diabetic offspring. We also found that YAP1 mediated the expression of Survivin during HG-induced apoptosis, and the Survivin-inhibitor YM155 partially inhibited the role of YAP1 in suppressing apoptosis induced by HG in cardiomyocytes.\nThese findings reveal a regulatory mechanism of MST1/YAP1/Survivin signaling in modulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro and maternal diabetes-induced congenital heart defects in vivo.", "journal": "Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)", "date": "2021-02-12", "authors": ["DongmeiSu", "YanhuaLi", "LinaGuan", "QianLi", "CuigeShi", "XuMa", "YonghuiSong"], "doi": "10.1186/s10020-021-00267-6\n10.1159/000324863\n10.1038/srep45020\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.04.015\n10.1038/nature20829\n10.1016/j.ajog.2008.06.028\n10.1159/000495896\n10.1002/bdrb.20212\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00557-9\n10.1038/nrgastro.2016.59\n10.1038/nrgastro.2016.59\n10.1038/onc.2016.266\n10.1016/j.chom.2018.08.004\n10.1111/1759-7714.13076\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.180042\n10.1038/ncomms9357\n10.1056/NEJMoa0707943\n10.1038/jp.2016.135\n10.1186/1475-2840-13-46\n10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.2831\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.026\n10.1016/j.siny.2009.01.002\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.101\n10.3390/cancers10040094\n10.1111/cas.13379\n10.1242/dev.102376\n10.1371/journal.pone.0205514\n10.18632/oncotarget.12760\n10.1074/jbc.M111.329268\n10.1074/jbc.M117.804005\n10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.6.1667\n10.1007/s00125-016-4070-9\n10.1101/gad.1843810"}
{"title": "Statins Attenuate Fibrotic Manifestations of Cardiac Tissue Damage.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a maladaptive condition secondary to cardiomyopathy caused by a wide spectrum of stimuli, including myocardial infarction (MI), pressure overload, hyperglycemia, aging, and other factors. Despite having been supposed to be a reparative mechanism, the development of cardiac fibrosis can result in undesirable outcomes like the disruption of excitation-contraction coupling and ventricular hypertrophy, leading finally to heart failure (HF). Statins are known as potent cardioprotective agents widely used to control dyslipidemia; these drugs have exhibited protective effects against manifestations of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy. Cumulative evidence has suggested that statins attenuate the severity of fibrotic and hypertrophic manifestations of cardiac damage by affecting a variety of mechanisms like differentiation of myofibroblasts and crosstalk between cells in cardiac tissue as well as altering the expression and function of different molecules involved in cardiac remodeling, including inflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules. It seems that statins can inhibit cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy not only through their ability to inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase but also by their pleiotropic properties. This review aims to discuss the effects of statins on molecular pathways involved in the inhibition of fibrotic and hypertrophic remodeling in the heart, thereby potentially helping to recover proper cardiac size, plasticity, and functioning.", "journal": "Current molecular pharmacology", "date": "2021-02-12", "authors": ["Armita MGorabi", "NasimKiaie", "VanessaBianconi", "MatteoPirro", "TannazJamialahmadi", "AmirhosseinSahebkar"], "doi": "10.2174/1874467214666210210123206"}

Engineered three-dimensional (3D) vascularized cardiac tissues have shown promise in rescuing cardiac function in diseased hearts and may serve as a whole organ replacement in the future. One of the major obstacles in reconstructing these thick myocardial tissues to a clinically applicable scale is the integration of functional vascular networks capable of providing oxygen and nutrients throughout whole engineered constructs. Without perfusion of oxygen and nutrient flow throughout the entire engineered tissue not only is tissue viability compromised, but also overall tissue functionality is lost. There are many supporting technologies and approaches that have been developed to create vascular networks such as 3D bioprinting, co-culturing hydrogels, and incorporation of soluble angiogenic factors. In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss some of the most current engineered vascular cardiac tissues reported in the literature and future directions in the field. Impact statement The field of cardiac tissue engineering is rapidly evolving and is now closer than ever to having engineered tissue models capable of predicting preclinical responses to therapeutics, modeling diseases, and being used as a means of rescuing cardiac function following injuries to the native myocardium.

{"title": "A poroelastic immersed finite element framework for modelling cardiac perfusion and fluid-structure interaction.", "abstract": "Modern approaches to modelling cardiac perfusion now commonly describe the myocardium using the framework of poroelasticity. Cardiac tissue can be described as a saturated porous medium composed of the pore fluid (blood) and the skeleton (myocytes and collagen scaffold). In previous studies fluid-structure interaction in the heart has been treated in a variety of ways, but in most cases, the myocardium is assumed to be a hyperelastic fibre-reinforced material. Conversely, models that treat the myocardium as a poroelastic material typically neglect interactions between the myocardium and intracardiac blood flow. This work presents a poroelastic immersed finite element framework to model left ventricular dynamics in a three-phase poroelastic system composed of the pore blood fluid, the skeleton, and the chamber fluid. We benchmark our approach by examining a pair of prototypical poroelastic formations using a simple cubic geometry considered in the prior work by Chapelle et al (2010). This cubic model also enables us to compare the differences between system behaviour when using isotropic and anisotropic material models for the skeleton. With this framework, we also simulate the poroelastic dynamics of a three-dimensional left ventricle, in which the myocardium is described by the Holzapfel-Ogden law. Results obtained using the poroelastic model are compared to those of a corresponding hyperelastic model studied previously. We find that the poroelastic LV behaves differently from the hyperelastic LV model. For example, accounting for perfusion results in a smaller diastolic chamber volume, agreeing well with the well-known wall-stiffening effect under perfusion reported previously. Meanwhile differences in systolic function, such as fibre strain in the basal and middle ventricle, are found to be comparatively minor.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2021-02-10", "authors": ["Scott I HeathRichardson", "HaoGao", "JenniferCox", "RobJaniczek", "Boyce EGriffith", "ColinBerry", "XiaoyuLuo"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.3446\n10.1002/cnm.2858\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2017.06.042\n10.1002/cnm.2497"}

In rats, KD or frequent deep fasting decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, reduced cell respiration, and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Mechanistically, increased levels of the ketone body \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2-OHB), an HDAC2 inhibitor, promoted histone acetylation of the Sirt7 promoter and activated Sirt7 transcription. This in turn inhibited the transcription of mitochondrial ribosome-encoding genes and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Exogenous \u03b2-OHB administration mimicked the effects of a KD in rats. Notably, increased \u03b2-OHB levels and SIRT7 expression, decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased cardiac fibrosis were detected in human atrial fibrillation heart tissues.

{"title": "Real-time registration of 3D echo to x-ray fluoroscopy based on cascading classifiers and image registration.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is one of the most significant advances in cardiac imaging. Although TEE provides real-time 3D visualization of heart tissues and blood vessels and has no ionizing radiation, x-ray fluoroscopy still dominates in guidance of cardiac interventions due to TEE having a limited field of view and poor visualization of surgical instruments. Therefore, fusing 3D echo with live x-ray images can provide a better guidance solution. This paper proposes a novel framework for image fusion by detecting the pose of the TEE probe in x-ray images in real-time. The framework does not require any manual initialization. Instead it uses a cascade classifier to compute the position and in-plane rotation angle of the TEE probe. The remaining degrees of freedom are determined by fast marching against a template library. The proposed framework is validated on phantoms and patient data. The target registration error for the phantom was 2.1 mm. In addition, 10 patient datasets, seven of which were acquired from cardiac electrophysiology procedures and three from trans-catheter aortic valve implantation procedures, were used to test the clinical feasibility as well as accuracy.

Qingda granule (QDG), derived from the Qingxuan Jiangya decoction, has been used clinically for more than 60 years to treat hypertension. However, the effect of QDG on hypertensive cardiac fibrosis remains largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of QDG on cardiac fibrosis and explore the underlying mechanism in vivo and in vitro. For in vivo experiments, 30 male spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomly divided into groups that received no QDG or one of three doses (0.45, 0.9 or 1.8 g/kg/day). Positive-control animals received valsartan (VAL, 7.2 mg/kg/day). Treatments were administered by gavage for 10 weeks. All three doses of QDG and VAL led to significantly lower blood pressure than in SHR animals. Besides, all three doses of QDG and VAL attenuated pathological changes in SHR animals. However, only intermediate, high concentrations of QDG and VAL led to significantly lower left ventricle ejection fraction and left ventricle fractional shortening than in SHR animals. Therefore, the minimum and effective QDG dose (intermediate concentration of QDG) was selected for subsequent animal experiments in this study. Our results showed that intermediate concentration of QDG also significantly mitigated the increases in levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), collagen III, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and in the ratio of phospho-Smad2/3 to total Smad2/3 protein in cardiac tissue, based on immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and Masson staining. For in vitro experiments, primary cardiac fibroblasts were stimulated with 100 nM angiotensin II in the presence or absence of QDG. And we tested different concentrations of QDG (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 \u03bcg/mL) in the cell viability experiment. Our results showed that 3.125, 6.25 and 12.5 \u03bcg/mL of QDG treatment for 24 h didn't affect the cell viability of cardiac fibroblasts. Consistently, QDG at 6.25 or 12.5 \u03bcg/mL significantly reduced cell viability and down-regulated \u03b1-SMA in primary cardiac fibroblasts were stimulated with 100 nM angiotensin II. Therefore, QDG at 12.5 \u03bcg/mL was chosen for the following cell experiment. Our results showed that QDG at 12.5 \u03bcg/mL alleviated the increase of PCNA, collagen \u2162, TGF-\u03b21 expression, and the ratio of phospho-Smad2/3 to total Smad2/3 protein. Our studies in vitro and in vivo suggest that QDG reduces blood pressure and cardiac fibrosis as well as protecting cardiac function, and that it exerts these effects in part by suppressing TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 signaling.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2021-02-09", "authors": ["XiaopingChen", "LinziLong", "YingCheng", "JianfengChu", "ZhiqingShen", "LiyaLiu", "JiapengLi", "QiurongXie", "HuixinLiu", "MeizhuWu", "YouqinChen", "JunPeng", "AlingShen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111318"}

Our laboratory has developed a three-dimensional in vitro model of the human heart, known as the \"cardiac spheroid\" or \"CS\". This presents biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological features typical of the human heart and is generated by co-culturing its three major cell types, such as cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs or iCMs) are co-cultured at ratios approximating the ones found in vivo with human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) in hanging drop culture plates for three to four days. The confocal analysis of CSs stained with antibodies against cardiac Troponin T, CD31 and vimentin (markers for cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts, respectively) shows that CSs present a complex endothelial cell network, resembling the native one found in the human heart. This is confirmed by the 3D rendering analysis of these confocal images. CSs also present extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins typical of the human heart, such as collagen type IV, laminin and fibronectin. Finally, CSs present a contractile activity measured as syncytial contractility closer to the one typical of the human heart compared to CSs that contain iCMs only. When treated with a cardiotoxic anti-cancer agent, such as doxorubicin (DOX, used to treat leukemia, lymphoma and breast cancer), the viability of DOX-treated CSs is significantly reduced at 10 \u00b5M genetic and chemical inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, a downstream target of DOX in HCFs and HCAECs, reduced its toxicity in CSs.

{"title": "Acetylation of muscle creatine kinase negatively impacts high-energy phosphotransfer in heart failure.", "abstract": "A hallmark of impaired myocardial energetics in failing hearts is the downregulation of the creatine kinase (CK) system. In heart failure patients and animal models, myocardial phosphocreatine content and the flux of the CK reaction are negatively correlated with the outcome of heart failure. While decreased CK activity is highly reproducible in failing hearts, the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we report an inverse relationship between the activity and acetylation of CK muscle form (CKM) in human and mouse failing hearts. Hyperacetylation of recombinant CKM disrupted MM homodimer formation and reduced enzymatic activity, which could be reversed by sirtuin 2 treatment. Mass spectrometry analysis identified multiple lysine residues on the MM dimer interface, which were hyperacetylated in the failing hearts. Molecular modeling of CK MM homodimer suggested that hyperacetylation prevented dimer formation through interfering salt bridges within and between the 2 monomers. Deacetylation by sirtuin 2 reduced acetylation of the critical lysine residues, improved dimer formation, and restored CKM activity from failing heart tissue. These findings reveal a potentially novel mechanism in the regulation of CK activity and provide a potential target for improving high-energy phosphoryl transfer in heart failure.", "journal": "JCI insight", "date": "2021-02-09", "authors": ["Matthew AWalker", "JuanChavez", "OutiVillet", "XiaotingTang", "AndrewKeller", "James EBruce", "RongTian"], "doi": "10.1172/jci.insight.144301\n10.1056/NEJM198510243131704\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.7.2190\n10.1073/pnas.0408962102\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3007328\n10.1083/jcb.149.6.1225\n10.1007/s00395-017-0666-6\n10.1172/JCI57426\n10.1161/01.RES.78.5.893\n10.1016/j.cels.2017.10.017\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)34115-8\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)02160-5\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0070\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022495\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067513\n10.1021/cb500848p\n10.1074/jbc.M113.486753\n10.1016/S0014-5793(98)01355-6\n10.1021/bi027083b\n10.1093/clinchem/47.11.1967\n10.1016/j.biocel.2006.09.004\n10.1042/BST20140094\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017545\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028728\n10.1016/j.cmet.2013.07.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317293\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)37482-9\n10.1021/pr101065j\n10.1093/nar/gkz268\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.212753"}
{"title": "Carbon nanomaterials for cardiovascular theranostics: Promises and challenges.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart attack and stroke cause irreversible tissue damage. The currently available treatment options are limited to \"damage-control\" rather than tissue repair. The recent advances in nanomaterials have offered novel approaches to restore tissue function after injury. In particular, carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) have shown significant promise to bridge the gap in clinical translation of biomaterial based therapies. This family of carbon allotropes (including graphenes, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes) have unique physiochemical properties, including exceptional mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, chemical behaviour, thermal stability and optical properties. These intrinsic properties make CNMs ideal materials for use in cardiovascular theranostics. This review is focused on recent efforts in the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases using graphenes and carbon nanotubes. The first section introduces currently available derivatives of graphenes and carbon nanotubes and discusses some of the key characteristics of these materials. The second section covers their application in drug delivery, biosensors, tissue engineering and immunomodulation with a focus on cardiovascular applications. The final section discusses current shortcomings and limitations of CNMs in cardiovascular applications and reviews ongoing efforts to address these concerns and to bring CNMs from bench to bedside.",

During myocardial infarction (MI) and subsequent healing, however, this landscape changes significantly. In order to engineer cardiac biomaterials with the appropriate properties to enhance function after MI, the changes in the myocardium induced by MI must be clearly identified. In this review, we focus on the mechanical and structural properties of the healthy and infarcted myocardium in order to gain insight about the environment in which biomaterial-based cardiac therapies are expected to perform and the functional deficiencies caused by MI that the therapy must address. From this understanding, we discuss epicardial therapies for MI inspired by the mechanics and anisotropy of the heart focusing on passive devices, which feature a biomaterials approach, and active devices, which feature robotic and cellular components.

{"title": "Influence of pentoxifylline on gene expression of PAG1/ miR-1206/ SNHG14 in ischemic heart disease.", "abstract": "The regulation by immune checkpoint is able to prevent excessive tissue damage caused by ischemia reperfusion (I/R); therefore, the study aims to investigate the behavior of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains 1 (PAG1) mRNA, miR-1206 and small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) during I/R and intake of pentoxifylline (PTX) as a protective drug. The relative expression level of PAG1/miR-1206/SNHG14 was determined by qRT-PCR. Cardiac tissue levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) and PAG1 protein expression were determined by ELISA technique. The regulatory T cells achieved by the flow cytometry. The results found that the relative expression of SNHG14 was significantly upregulated in I/R, but suppressed in PTX treated groups with enhancement of the relative expression level of miR-1206. The gene and protein expression of PAG1 were downregulated with effective doses of PTX. The results showed that (30 and 40\u00a0mg/kg bwt) PTX dose suppressed the CTLA4 development significantly. The mean of the regulatory T cell in PTX protective groups is significantly reduced at (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in a comparison with I/R group.

{"title": "Phosphoproteomics of the developing heart identifies PERM1 - An outer mitochondrial membrane protein.", "abstract": "Heart development relies on PTMs that control cardiomyocyte proliferation, differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis. We generated a map of phosphorylation sites during the early stages of cardiac postnatal development in mice; we quantified over 10,000 phosphorylation sites and 5000 proteins that were assigned to different pathways. Analysis of mitochondrial proteins led to the identification of PGC-1- and ERR-induced regulator in muscle 1 (PERM1), which is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissue and associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane. We demonstrate PERM1 is subject to rapid changes mediated by the UPS through phosphorylation of its PEST motif by casein kinase 2. Ablation of Perm1 in mice results in reduced protein expression of lipin-1 accompanied by accumulation of specific phospholipid species. Isolation of Perm1-deficient mitochondria revealed significant downregulation of mitochondrial transport proteins for amino acids and carnitines, including SLC25A12/13/29/34 and CPT2.

Also, among the several mechanisms underlying SUDEP there is the cardiac dysfunction. So, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the number of seizures on heart function and morphology in rats with epilepsy. Rats were randomized into three groups: Sham (without epilepsy), 5 S, and 10 S groups, referred as rats with epilepsy with a total of 5 or 10 GTCS, respectively. Epilepsy was induced by electrical amygdala kindling. The ventricular function was analyzed by the Langendorff technique and challenged by ischemia/reperfusion protocol. Cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy were analyzed by histology. We also analyzed cardiac metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9), ERK 1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-ERK) by western blot; microRNA-21 and -320 by RT-PCR; and oxidative stress (TBARS, catalase activity and nitrite) by biochemical analysis. Only the 5S group presented decreased values of ventricular function at before ischemia/reperfusion (baseline): intraventricular systolic pressure, developed intraventricular pressure, positive and negative dP/dt. During ischemia/reperfusion protocol, the variation of the ventricular function did not differ among groups. Both 5S and 10S groups had increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis compared to Sham, but in the 5S group, these alterations were higher than in the 10S group. The 5S group increased in microRNA-21 and decreased in microRNA-320 expression compared to Sham and the 10S group. The 10S group increased in MMP9 and decreased in P-ERK/ERK expression, and increased in nitrite content compared to both Sham and the 5S group. Therefore, seizures impair cardiac function and morphology, probably through microRNA modulation.

Thus, combinations of different types of polymeric materials are used in order to manufacture different suture materials. A copolymer of Polyglycolide (PGA) and trimethylene carbonate (TMC) is one of the simplest bioabsorbable monofilament sutures. The optical properties of PGA/TMC copolymer surgical suture were investigated by using multiple-beam interferometric of Fizeau type. The mechanical properties were measured by a suture-drawing apparatus attached to the multiple-beam interferometric system. The refractive indices, stress-strain curve, elastic shear modulus, Young's modulus and crosslink density were investigated for the PGA/TMC surgical suture at various draw ratios. The biological activities were conducted by Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) descriptors. Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MESP) maps were used to describe the reactivity and functional active sites for the given molecule. The behavior of stress-strain curve confirms the compatibility of the suture with the sternum which proves that this suture is a good candidate for cardiac operations.

Do normal adult DBA/1 mice have cardiac function and performance equal to those of C57BL/6J mice? What is the main finding and its importance? Male adult DBA/1 mice show equivalent cardiac function to C57BL/6J mice up to 8\u00a0months old. Therefore, cardiac dysfunction could be investigated in an autoimmune diseases model established with DBA/1 mice.\nCardiovascular mortality has been increasing, and in particular, cardiovascular damage caused by some chronic autoimmune diseases accounts for a large proportion of this. C57BL/6J mice have been used mostly in studies of cardiovascular diseases. However, for purposes of modelling, this strain of mouse has a very low incidence of some chronic immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, to which instead DBA/1 mice are more susceptible. Basic cardiac function differs between mice with different genetic backgrounds. Therefore, we monitored cardiac function and structure of normal male C57BL/6J and DBA/1 mice for six consecutive months. Echocardiography was used to monitor cardiac functions once a month and cardiac systolic function was measured upon isoproterenol challenge at the end of observation. The Excitation-contraction coupling-related proteins were measured by western blotting. Heart tissue sections were subject to haematoxylin-eosin, TUNEL and Alizarin red staining. The results demonstrated that systolic and diastolic function did not vary significantly and both strains were indistinguishable in appearance and structure of hearts.

{"title": "Prognostic impact of elevated fatty acid-binding protein 1 in patients with heart failure.", "abstract": "Few biomarkers to evaluate pathophysiological changes in extra-cardiac tissues have been identified in patients with heart failure (HF). Fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP), also known as liver FABP, is predominantly expressed in the liver. Circulating FABP1 has been proposed to be a sensitive biomarker for liver injury. However, little is known about the potential role of FABP1 as a biomarker for HF.\nMeasurements of serum FABP1 and echocardiography were performed in subjects with compensated HF (n\u00a0=\u00a0162) and control subjects without HF (n\u00a0=\u00a020). Patients were prospectively followed-up for a composite outcome of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization. Compared with control subjects, levels of FABP1 were elevated in HF patients [7.9 (6.4-11.7) vs. 17.6 (10.4-28.9) ng/mL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001]. There were significant correlations between FABP1 levels and estimated right ventricular systolic pressure and right atrial pressure. During a median follow-up of 12.0\u00a0months, there were 55 primary composite endpoints in the HF cohort. The highest FABP1 tertile was associated with a three-fold increased risk of the composite outcome compared with the lowest tertile [95% confidence interval (1.46-6.68), P\u00a0=\u00a00.003], but other conventional hepatobiliary markers did not predict the outcome. After adjusting for age, sex, atrial fibrillation, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, serum FABP1 remained independently associated with the outcome. Adding FABP1 to the model based on clinical factors and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide significantly improved the prognostic value (global \u03c7\nSerum FABP1 levels are elevated in compensated HF patients, and the magnitude of elevation is independently associated with pulmonary hypertension, right atrial hypertension, and worse clinical outcomes.

We simulated mitral valve replacement preoperatively using dynamic, three-dimensional(3D) printed models to help predict LVOT obstruction in this study.\n56 patients who underwent mitral valve replacement were included. Prediction of LVOT obstruction in vitro was based on the data from 4 sources: digital, anatomical, flexible, and dynamic model. Digital 3D models were designed based on computed tomography (CT) image dataset and printed with photopolymer resin to create a 3D anatomical model, which contributed to the morphology display. Then, flexible models were made from specialized silicone, which is similar to cardiac tissue in terms of its softness and elasticity. Dynamic function was achieved by coupling flexible models to a mock circulatory system (MCS). Besides, surgery simulation and hemodynamic testing was done using dynamic 3D printed model and patients were regrouped based on hemodynamic change. Finally, different methods for prediction of LVOT obstruction as well as classification based on two-dimensional image data and dynamic model were compared with surgical results as golden standard.\n(1)Qualitatively, the prediction of LVOT obstruction using the dynamic 3D model was the most accurate and was consistent with clinical outcomes. In the four patients who developed LVOT obstruction after surgery, only two were at a high risk based on the other three models. (2)Quantitatively, the area of neo-LVOT predicted by the digital, anatomical, and flexible models was higher compared with the dynamic models and in-vivo after surgery. (3)Classification based on traditional criteria(two-dimensional image data) was different from surgical results. While the difference between dynamic model and surgical results was not statistically different.\nAfter coupling the flexible model with the mock circulatory system, the dynamic 3D model predicted LVOT obstruction more accurately with hemodynamic testing compared with morphological evaluation. 3D printing can assist surgeons to better plan mitral valve replacement than traditional image data.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2021-02-04", "authors": ["HaoWang", "HongningSong", "YuantingYang", "ZhiyongWu", "RuiHu", "JinlingChen", "JuanGuo", "YijiaWang", "DanJia", "ShengCao", "QingZhou", "RuiqiangGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.01.029"}
{"title": "3D bioprinting of high cell-density heterogeneous tissue models through spheroid fusion within self-healing hydrogels.", "abstract": "Cellular models are needed to study human development and disease in vitro, and to screen drugs for toxicity and efficacy. Current approaches are limited in the engineering of functional tissue models with requisite cell densities and heterogeneity to appropriately model cell and tissue behaviors. Here, we develop a bioprinting approach to transfer spheroids into self-healing support hydrogels at high resolution, which enables their patterning and fusion into high-cell density microtissues of prescribed spatial organization. As an example application, we bioprint induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac microtissue models with spatially controlled cardiomyocyte and fibroblast cell ratios to replicate the structural and functional features of scarred cardiac tissue that arise following myocardial infarction, including reduced contractility and irregular electrical activity. The bioprinted in vitro model is combined with functional readouts to probe how various pro-regenerative microRNA treatment regimes influence tissue regeneration and recovery of function as a result of cardiomyocyte proliferation.

{"title": "Honokiol regulates mitochondrial substrate utilization and cellular fatty acid metabolism in diabetic mice heart.", "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction, which is one of the main reasons for cardiovascular diseases. Among the mitochondrial metabolic changes, fatty acid metabolism is of great importance as cardiac tissues depend primarily on fatty acids. Honokiol, a constituent of Magnolia tree bark extract, is reported to strongly influence cardiac mitochondrial functions, via various mechanisms. The current study showed that honokiol decreased fatty acid-mediated complex I respiration and increased carbohydrate-mediated complex I and II respiration in diabetic C57BL/6 mice cardiac mitochondria. It was also found that honokiol treatment decreased expression of Cluster of Differentiation 36, AMP-activated kinases and nuclear transcription factors like, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 co-activator 1\u03b1/\u03b2 and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1, surrogating the evidence of decreased fatty acid-mediated complex I respiration. Honokiol treatment also reduced the levels of mitochondrial acetylated proteins, suggesting the possible action of honokiol via acetylation/deacetylation mechanism of regulation of protein functions in diabetic mitochondria. The antioxidant effect of honokiol is evidenced by the augmented expression of Manganese super oxide dismutase. In conclusion, honokiol imparts beneficial effect on diabetic cardiac mitochondria by decreasing the oxidant burden via regulating mitochondrial fatty acid respiration and expression of oxidant response factors.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2021-02-03", "authors": ["Nandini RavikumarJayakumari", "Raji SasikalaRajendran", "AshokSivasailam", "Sulfath ThottungalParambil", "Anand ChellappanReghuvaran", "Harikrishnan VijayakumarSreelatha", "SrinivasGopala"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173918"}

The Control group received room air for 120\u2009min.\nNon-invasive optical monitoring was used to measure cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. Cerebral microdialysis was performed to obtain semi real time measurements of cerebral metabolic status. At the end of the exposure, both fresh brain (cortical and hippocampal tissue) and heart (apical tissue) were immediately harvested to measure mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and blood was collected to assess plasma cytokine concentrations.\nAnimals in the CO group showed significantly decreased Complex IV-linked mitochondrial respiration in hippocampal and apical heart tissue but not cortical tissue. There also was a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS generation across all measured tissue types. The CO group showed a significantly higher cerebral lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. Both IL-8 and TNF\u03b1 were significantly increased in the CO group compared with the Control group obtained from plasma. While not significant there was a trend to an increase in optically measured cerebral blood flow and hemoglobin concentration in the CO group.\nLow-dose CO poisoning is associated with early mitochondrial disruption prior to an observable phenotype highlighting the important role of mitochondrial function in the pathology of CO poisoning.

Next, the scores of the first five principal components were used as input for an artificial neural network (ANN). Additionally, the therapeutic effect of RALP was assessed by measuring the hemodynamic indexes of heart failure model rats. Subsequently, fluorescence semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit were used to determine the effects of RALP-processed products on the serum levels of noradrenaline (NA), angiotensin-\u2160 (Ang-\u2160), and the expression of \u03b2-norepinephrine receptor mRNA (\u03b2-NRm) in the rat cardiac tissues. P < 0.05 was used as the output of the ANN. Finally, a network was constructed to display the relationship between the LC-MS fingerprints and the cardiotonic activity of the RALP-processed products.\nSeveral types of RALPs can improve diastolic function, systolic function and heart rate. On the basis of the findings from the principal component analysis (PCA) of 16 common peaks of fingerprints of six RALP-processed products, it was revealed that the first five principal components may include 100% of the information of the original data. As observed from the multilayer perceptron neural network analysis, principal component 4 presented with the strongest effects on serum levels of NA and Ang-\u2160 in rats, while principal component 1 exerted the greatest effect on \u03b2-NRm expression in cardiac tissue.\nThe key findings obtained from this study indicated that the network constructed by the PCA-ANN may predict pharmacodynamic effects of the main ingredients of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

It justifies cardio-oncological preliminary studies on dietary factors, especially on those of possible anti-carcinogenic or cardioprotective properties. The main purpose was to evaluate the effect of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) and/or bitter melon extract (BME) supplementation of the diet of female rats suffering from mammary tumors on lipidomic profile (expressed as fatty acids, conjugated fatty acids (CFA), malondialdehyde (MDA), cholesterol and oxysterols content) of cardiac tissue. Total lipidomic profile and intensity of lipid peroxidation in hearts of DMBA-treated Sprague-Dawley rats and their healthy equivalents, both obtaining diet supplementation, were evaluated with different chromatographic techniques coupled with appropriate detection systems (GC-MS, GC-TOFMS, Ag+-HPLC-DAD, UF-HPLC-DAD). Dietary modifications neither diminished breast cancer incidence nor exerted explicit cardio-protective influence, however, they diminished cholesterol content, i.a. because of inhibition of the endogenous conversion of squalene to cholesterol in cardiac tissue. CFA were incorporated into cardiac tissue to a lesser extent in the cancerous process. PSO and BME anti-oxidant properties in pathological condition were only slightly reflected in MDA levels but not in oxysterols formation. Obtained results indicate considerable changes in dietary supplements' biological activity in pathological conditions and the need for clear distinction of drugs and dietary supplements, which is of utmost importance, especially for cancer survivors.", "journal": "Chemistry and physics of lipids", "date": "2021-01-31", "authors": ["AgnieszkaBia\u0142ek", "Ma\u0142gorzataBia\u0142ek", "TomaszLepionka", "PaulinaPachniewicz", "MarianCzauderna"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2021.105057"}

{"title": "Repeated Administration of Clinically Relevant Doses of the Prescription Opioids Tramadol and Tapentadol Causes Lung, Cardiac, and Brain Toxicity in Wistar Rats.", "abstract": "Tramadol and tapentadol, two structurally related synthetic opioid analgesics, are widely prescribed due to the enhanced therapeutic profiles resulting from the synergistic combination between \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) activation and monoamine reuptake inhibition. However, the number of adverse reactions has been growing along with their increasing use and misuse. The potential toxicological mechanisms for these drugs are not completely understood, especially for tapentadol, owing to its shorter market history. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to comparatively assess the putative lung, cardiac, and brain cortex toxicological damage elicited by the repeated exposure to therapeutic doses of both prescription opioids. To this purpose, male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with single daily doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg tramadol or tapentadol, corresponding to a standard analgesic dose, an intermediate dose, and the maximum recommended daily dose, respectively, for 14 consecutive days. Such treatment was found to lead mainly to lipid peroxidation and inflammation in lung and brain cortex tissues, as shown through augmented thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as to increased serum inflammation biomarkers, such as C reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Cardiomyocyte integrity was also shown to be affected, since both opioids incremented serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-HBDH) activities, while tapentadol was associated with increased serum creatine kinase muscle brain (CK-MB) isoform activity. In turn, the analysis of metabolic parameters in brain cortex tissue revealed increased lactate concentration upon exposure to both drugs, as well as augmented LDH and creatine kinase (CK) activities following tapentadol treatment. In addition, pneumo- and cardiotoxicity biomarkers were quantified at the gene level, while neurotoxicity biomarkers were quantified both at the gene and protein levels; changes in their expression correlate with the oxidative stress, inflammatory, metabolic, and histopathological changes that were detected. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining revealed several histopathological alterations, including alveolar collapse and destruction in lung sections, inflammatory infiltrates, altered cardiomyocytes and loss of striation in heart sections, degenerated neurons, and accumulation of glial and microglial cells in brain cortex sections. In turn, Masson's trichrome staining confirmed fibrous tissue deposition in cardiac tissue. Taken as a whole, these results show that the repeated administration of both prescription opioids extends the dose range for which toxicological injury is observed to lower therapeutic doses. They also reinforce previous assumptions that tramadol and tapentadol are not devoid of toxicological risk even at clinical doses.", "journal": "Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)", "date":

{"title": "Myocardial expression of somatotropic axis, adrenergic signalling, and calcium handling genes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.", "abstract": "Limited data are available regarding cardiac expression of molecules involved in heart failure (HF) pathophysiology. The majority of the studies have focused on end-stage HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) without comparison with healthy subjects, while no data are available with regard to HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF is a condition whose multiple pathophysiological mechanisms are still not fully defined, with many proposed hypotheses remaining speculative due to limited access to human heart tissue. This study aimed at evaluating cardiac expression levels of key genes of interest in human biopsy samples from patients affected with HFrEF and HFpEF in order to possibly point out distinct phenotypes.\nTotal RNA was extracted from left ventricular cardiac biopsies collected from stable patients with HFrEF (n\u00a0=\u00a06) and HFpEF (n\u00a0=\u00a07) and healthy subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a09) undergoing elective cardiac surgery for valvular replacement, mitral valvuloplasty, aortic surgery, or coronary artery bypass. Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of genes involved in somatotropic axis regulation [IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and GH receptor (GHR)], in adrenergic signalling (GRK2, GRK5, ADRB1, and ADRB2), in myocardial calcium handling (SERCA2), and in TNF-\u03b1. Patients with HFrEF and HFpEF showed reduced serum IGF-1 circulating levels when compared with controls (102\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.6, 138\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.5, and 160\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.2\u00a0ng/mL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). At myocardial level, HFrEF showed significant decreased GHR and increased IGF-1R expressions when compared with HFpEF and controls (0.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27, 0.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25, and 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and 1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9, 1.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21, and 0.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, respectively), while no differences in the local expression of IGF-1 mRNA were detected among the groups (0.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45, 0.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18, and 0.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23, P\u00a0=\u00a00.09, respectively). With regard to calcium handling and adrenergic signalling, HFrEF displayed significant decreased levels of SERCA2 (0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39, 0.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15, and 0.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and increased levels of GRK2 (3.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.94, 0.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, and 0.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and GRK5 (1.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.70, 0.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14, and 0.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while no significant difference was found in ADRB1 (0.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4, 0.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3, and 0.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4) and ADRB2 mRNA expression (0.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3, 0.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2, and 0.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1) when compared with HFpEF and controls. Finally, no changes in the local expression of TNF-\u03b1 were detected among groups.\nHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction and HFpEF patients with stable clinical condition display a distinct molecular milieu of genes involved in somatotropic axis regulation, calcium handling, and adrenergic derangement at a myocardial level. The unique opportunity to compare these results with a control group, as reference population, may contribute to better understand HF pathophysiology and to identify novel potential therapeutic targets that could be modulated to improve ventricular function in patients with HF.", "journal": "ESC heart failure", "date": "2021-01-30", "authors": ["RobertaD'Assante", "MicheleArcopinto", "GiuseppeRengo", "AndreaSalzano", "MarionWalser", "GiuseppinaGambino", "Maria GaiaMonti", "LeonardoBencivenga", "Alberto MMarra", "David N\u00c5berg", "CarloDe Vincentiis", "AndreaBallotta", "EduardoBossone", "J\u00f6rgenIsgaard", "AntonioCittadini"], "doi": "10.1002/ehf2.13067"}

{"title": "Recurrent Syncope Due to Concurrent Cardiac Sarcoidosis and Large-Vessel Vasculitis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Cardiac sarcoidosis and large-vessel vasculitis are both rare diseases with a variety of presenting symptoms. Both can result in high morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed early. While they are each relatively uncommon on their own, there have been a few reports suggesting they may be more related than previously thought. This case report suggests that the 2 diseases can become symptomatic concurrently, complicating diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 68-year-old male patient was diagnosed concurrently with cardiac sarcoidosis and vasculitis after several episodes of syncope thought to be due to arrhythmia. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids, and repeat imaging showed decreased inflammatory changes in the cardiac tissue and large blood vessels. CONCLUSIONS Prior case reports have described vasculitis and sarcoidosis in the same patient; however, these patients usually had a long history of known sarcoidosis involving several organ systems. This case suggests that physicians should be alert to more limited forms of the disease in a patient with cardiac myopathy of unknown origin with new arrythmia. More research is also needed to determine how granulomatous disease and vasculitis are related to each other.", "journal": "The American journal of case reports", "date": "2021-01-30", "authors": ["Hannah KGendelman", "MarwaSabha", "Anton AGryaznov", "Bernadette CSiaton"], "doi": "10.12659/AJCR.927331"}

{"title": "Chromatin Accessibility of Human Mitral Valves and Functional Assessment of MVP Risk Loci.", "abstract": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvopathy that leads to mitral insufficiency, heart failure, and sudden death. Functional genomic studies in mitral valves are needed to better characterize MVP-associated variants and target genes.\nTo establish the chromatin accessibility profiles and assess functionality of variants and narrow down target genes at MVP loci.\nWe mapped the open chromatin regions in nuclei from 11 human pathogenic and 7 nonpathogenic mitral valves by an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing. Open chromatin peaks were globally similar between pathogenic and nonpathogenic valves. Compared with the heart tissue and cardiac fibroblasts, we found that MV-specific assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing peaks are enriched near genes involved in extracellular matrix organization, chondrocyte differentiation, and connective tissue development. One of the most enriched motifs in MV-specific open chromatin peaks was for the nuclear factor of activated T cells family of TFs (transcription factors) involved in valve endocardial and interstitial cell formation. We also found that MVP-associated variants were significantly enriched (\nHere, we describe unprecedented genome-wide open chromatin profiles from human pathogenic and nonpathogenic MVs and report specific gene regulation profiles, compared with the heart. We also report in vitro functional evidence for potential causal variants and target genes at MVP risk loci involving established and new biological mechanisms.

{"title": "Prognostic Value of Left Ventricular Global Strain Analysis by Two-Dimensional Speckle-Tracking Echocardiography in Non-Hemodynamically Significant Intermediate Coronary Lesions.", "abstract": "Intermediate coronary lesions represent a major challenge for the invasive and noninvasive cardiologist. Left ventricular strain calculation by speckle tracking echocardiography has the capacity to analyze the motion of the cardiac tissue. This study aimed to evaluate its usefulness and prognostic significance in nonhemodynamically significant intermediate coronary lesions. We studied 247 patients who underwent a clinically indicated coronary angiogram. Each of the patients had a single nonrevascularized nonhemodynamically significant intermediate severity coronary lesion (ISCL) with a fractional flow reserve greater than 0.80. The left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) was calculated using speckle-tracking echocardiography with TomTec 2D Cardiac Performance Analysis (Unterschleissheim, Germany). An abnormal GLS was defined as less than -20%. The primary endpoints were revascularization of the target lesion, admissions for major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and cardiac-related mortality, all within 2 years. On multivariate logistic regression data analysis, we found that patients with an ISCL and abnormal GLS had an increased risk for admissions due to MACE (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, P < 0.05, confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.005-1.120], and an increased risk of cardiac-related death (OR 1.12, P < 0.05, CI 95% 1.012-1.275). There was no difference in the need for target lesion revascularization among individuals with normal and abnormal GLS (1.00, P 0.88, CI 95% .950-1.061).

NAC (20\u2009mg/kg b.w./day) was administered to fructose induced MS animals for 12 weeks. Chronic fructose consumption (20% w/v) increased body weight gain, relative heart weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), insulin resistance (IR), and associated with metabolic alterations. Histological and immunohistochemical examination revealed aortic stiffness and myocardial degeneration and fibrosis together with increased CT-1 expression. Treatment with NAC improved IR, SBP, DBP, and mitigated dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress. Additionally, NAC down-regulated CT-1 expression in the heart and aorta. These findings demonstrated the protective effect of NAC against aortic and myocardial degeneration and fibrosis through down-regulation of CT-1 in fructose induced MS animal model.", "journal": "Archives of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2021-01-29", "authors": ["Azza SAbdelhaffez", "Ebtihal AAbd El-Aziz", "Maha BTohamy", "Asmaa MAhmed"], "doi": "10.1080/13813455.2021.1876735"}

{"title": "Upregulation of miR-335 reduces myocardial injury following myocardial infarction via targeting MAP3K2.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a serious cardiovascular disease with a high incidence worldwide and the main cause of sudden cardiac death. The aim of this article was to study the protective role of miR-335 in myocardial infarction (MI) and the underlying molecular mechanism.\nThirty Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham group, MI + NC group and MI + agomiR-335 group. The expression of miR-335 in rat myocardium was detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Western blot was performed to detect the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, Caspase-3, Cleaved Caspase-3 (C-Caspase-3) and MAP3K2 in rat myocardium. On the 7th day of the establishment of the rat MI model, a high-resolution small animal ultrasound system was utilized to detect the cardiac function of the rats, and the heart tissues and blood samples of the rats were collected. The corresponding kits were purchased to detect the contents of LDH, CK-MB, MDA and SOD in rat serum, and HE staining was employed to observe the morphology of rat myocardial tissue.\nThe expression of miR-335 in myocardial infarcted zones and border zones of MI rats decreased significantly. The upregulation of miR-335 remarkably inhibited myocardial inflammation and apoptosis after MI, thus improving the cardiac function of MI rats. Compared with the sham group, the MAP3K2 expression in the MI + NC group was observably increased, while the overexpression of miR-335 could inhibit the expression of this protein. Through the Luciferase reporter gene experiment, we found that miR-335 could directly target MAP3K2.\nThe expression of miR-335 decreased in myocardial tissue after MI, and the overexpression of miR-335 reduced myocardial damage by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis via targeting MAP3K2, thereby improving the cardiac function of MI rats.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2021-01-29", "authors": ["A-DWang", "L-FDai", "LYang", "Y-SWang", "X-HHao", "Z-CLiu", "P-LChen"], "doi": "10.26355/eurrev_202101_24401"}

Over the past few decades, much has been learned about the pathophysiological processes that can lead to AF from a\u00a0variety of specific disease models in animals. However, our ability to recognise these disease processes in AF patients is still limited, which has contributed to the limited progress in improving rhythm control in AF.\nWe believe that a\u00a0better understanding and detection of the individual pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AF is a\u00a0prerequisite for developing patient-tailored therapies. The RACE\u00a0V Tissue Bank Project will contribute to the unravelling of the main molecular mechanisms of AF by studying histology and genome-wide RNA expression profiles and combining this information with detailed phenotyping of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nAs more and more evidence suggests that AF may occur not only during the first days but also during the months and years after surgery, we will systematically study the incidence of AF during the first years after cardiac surgery in patients with or without a\u00a0history of AF. Both the overall AF burden as well as the pattern of AF episodes will be studied. Lastly, we will study the association between the major molecular mechanisms and the clinical presentation of the patients, including the incidence and pattern of AF during the follow-up period.\nThe RACE\u00a0V Tissue Bank Project combines deep phenotyping of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including rhythm follow-up, analysis of molecular mechanisms, histological analysis and genome-wide RNA sequencing.

{"title": "Pentoxifylline Attenuates Arsenic Trioxide-Induced Cardiac Oxidative Damage in Mice.", "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic potential effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) against arsenic trioxide (ATO)-induced cardiac oxidative damage in mice. Thirty-six male albino mice were divided into six groups and treated intraperitoneally with normal saline (group 1), ATO (5\u2009mg/kg; group 2), PTX (100\u2009mg/kg; group 3), and different doses of PTX (25, 50, and 100\u2009mg/kg; groups 4, 5, and 6, respectively) with ATO. After four weeks, the blood sample was collected for biochemical experiments. In addition, cardiac tissue was removed for assessment of oxidative stress markers and histopathological changes (such as hemorrhage, necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and myocardial degeneration). The findings showed that ATO caused a significant raise in serum biochemical markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and troponin-I (cTnI), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels. In addition to histopathological changes in cardiac tissue, ATO led to the significant increase in cardiac lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide (NO); remarkable decrease in the activity of cardiac antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx); and the depletion of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total thiol groups (TTGs). PTX was able to reduce the increased levels of serum cardiac markers (LDH, CPK, cTnI, TC, and TG), cardiac LPO, and improve antioxidant markers (TAC, TTGs, CAT, SOD, and GPx) alongside histopathologic changes. However, no significant changes were observed in elevated serum glucose and cardiac NO levels.

The current study set out to investigate the role of B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) in cardiac protection after AMI. Initially, AMI mouse models and H9c2 cell oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) models were established. The cell models were transfected with the vectors containing oe-BCL-6, oe-EZH2, sh-EZH2, miR-34a mimic, and miR-34a inhibitor. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were applied to detect the expression patterns of microRNA-34a (miR-34a), BCL-6, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 9 (CTRP9) in the treated cell models. ChIP-qPCR and co-immunoprecipitation assay were performed to detect EZH2 enrichment and H3K27me3 levels in the miR-34a promoter region and the interaction between BCL-2 and EZH2, respectively. EdU staining, TUNEL staining, and flow cytometry were performed to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis, while ELISA was conducted to detect the oxidative stress levels. It was found that miR-34a was highly expressed in heart tissues of AMI models, while BCL-6 and EZH2 were poorly expressed. BCL-2 overexpression increased the recruitment of EZH2, upregulated H3K27me3 level in the miR-34a promoter region, and inhibited the miR-34a expression. Ctrp9, the downstream negative-regulatory molecule of miR-34a, was upregulated. Besides, miR-34a/CTRP9 expression changes were found to affect cardiomyocyte apoptosis, oxidation stress, and proliferation, and prevent myocardial injury in AMI mice. Our findings indicate that BCL-6 increases the level of H3K27me3 in the promoter region of miR-34a via EZH2 recruitment and CTRP9 upregulation, which inhibits the apoptosis of myocardial cells.", "journal": "BioFactors (Oxford, England)", "date": "2021-01-28", "authors": ["Jiunn-MiinLin", "Chih-HsiangHsu", "Jeen-ChenChen", "Shao-HsuanKao", "You-CianLin"], "doi": "10.1002/biof.1704"}
{"title": "Drift and termination of spiral waves in optogenetically modified cardiac tissue at sub-threshold illumination.", "abstract": "The development of new approaches to control cardiac arrhythmias requires a deep understanding of spiral wave dynamics. Optogenetics offers new possibilities for this. Preliminary experiments show that sub-threshold illumination affects electrical wave propagation in the mouse heart. However, a systematic exploration of these effects is technically challenging. Here, we use state-of-the-art computer models to study the dynamic control of spiral waves in a two-dimensional model of the adult mouse ventricle, using stationary and non-stationary patterns of sub-threshold illumination. Our results indicate a light-intensity-dependent increase in cellular resting membrane potentials, which together with diffusive cell-cell coupling leads to the development of spatial voltage gradients over differently illuminated areas. A spiral wave drifts along the positive gradient. These gradients can be strategically applied to ensure drift-induced termination of a spiral wave, both in optogenetics and in conventional methods of electrical defibrillation.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2021-01-28", "authors": ["SayedehHussaini", "VishaliniVenkatesan", "ValentinaBiasci", "Jos\u00e9 MRomero Sep\u00falveda", "Raul AQui\u00f1onez Uribe", "LeonardoSacconi", "GilBub", "ClaudiaRichter", "ValentinKrinski", "UlrichParlitz", "RupamanjariMajumder", "StefanLuther"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.59954\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.10.018\n10.1016/j.ccep.2010.10.012\n10.1016/0002-8703(80)90623-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024388\n10.1103/PhysRevE.81.066202\n10.1088/1367-2630/10/10/103012\n10.1152/ajpheart.00185.2003\n10.1016/0009-2614(93)80139-G\n10.1038/nmeth.1512\n10.1172/JCI88950\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.196\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.05.002\n10.1529/biophysj.107.116244\n10.1073/pnas.87.22.8785\n10.1038/355349a0\n10.1007/BF01043605\n10.4088/PCC.12r01456\n10.1038/nmeth.f.324\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-070909-105305\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.825091\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005591\n10.1063/1.1395624\n10.1155/2015/731386\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.03.015\n10.1038/nature10216\n10.7554/eLife.41076\n10.1126/science.257.5067.225\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.07.012\n10.1093/europace/eul142\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw574\n10.1161/01.RES.72.3.631\n10.1152/ajpheart.00493.2011\n10.1103/PhysRevE.81.010901\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01651\n10.1016/j.mri.2016.10.030\n10.1113/JP276283\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000145610.64014.E4\n10.1103/PhysRevE.82.036122\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003220\n10.1088/1367-2630/10/1/015005\n10.1016/0002-9149(75)90865-6"}

The spared cardiomyocytes underwent proliferation and restored the heart structure and function in 45-60\u2009days after ablation.\nThis cardiomyocyte ablation system did not appear to activate the epicardium and endocardium as is noted in other cardiac injury models.

{"title": "Injectable Hydrogels for Improving Cardiac Cell Therapy-In Vivo Evidence and Translational Challenges.", "abstract": "Cell therapy has the potential to regenerate cardiac tissue and treat a variety of cardiac diseases which are currently without effective treatment. This novel approach to treatment has demonstrated clinical efficiency, despite low retention of the cell products in the heart. It has been shown that improving retention often leads to improved functional outcome. A feasible method of improving cell graft retention is administration of injectable hydrogels. Over the last decade, a variety of injectable hydrogels have been investigated preclinically for their potential to improve the effects of cardiac cell therapy.

{"title": "Cardiomyocyte Death and Genome-Edited Stem Cell Therapy for Ischemic Heart Disease.", "abstract": "Massive death of cardiomyocytes is a major feature of cardiovascular diseases. Since the regenerative capacity of cardiomyocytes is limited, the regulation of their death has been receiving great attention. The cell death of cardiomyocytes is a complex mechanism that has not yet been clarified, and it is known to appear in various forms such as apoptosis, necrosis, etc. In ischemic heart disease, the apoptosis and necrosis of cardiomyocytes appear in two types of programmed forms (intrinsic and extrinsic pathways) and they account for a large portion of cell death. To repair damaged cardiomyocytes, diverse stem cell therapies have been attempted. However, despite the many positive effects, the low engraftment and survival rates have clearly limited the application of stem cells in clinical therapy. To solve these challenges, the introduction of the desired genes in stem cells can be used to enhance their capacity and improve their therapeutic efficiency. Moreover, as genome engineering technologies have advanced significantly, safer and more stable delivery of target genes and more accurate deletion of genes have become possible, which facilitates the genetic modification of stem cells. Accordingly, stem cell therapy for damaged cardiac tissue is expected to further improve. This review describes myocardial cell death, stem cell therapy for cardiac repair, and genome-editing technologies. In addition, we introduce recent stem cell therapies that incorporate genome-editing technologies in the myocardial infarction model.

{"title": "Two Stem Cell Populations Including VSELs and CSCs Detected in the Pericardium of Adult Mouse Heart.", "abstract": "Adult mammalian heart is considered to be one of the least regenerative organs as it is not able to initiate endogenous regeneration in response to injury unlike in lower vertebrates and neonatal mammals. Evidence is now accumulating to suggest normal renewal and replacement of cardiomyocytes occurs even in middle-aged and old individuals. But underlying mechanisms leading to this are not yet clear. Do tissue-resident stem cells exist or somatic cells dedifferentiate leading to regeneration? Lot of attention is currently being focused on epicardium as it is involved in cardiac development, lodges multipotent progenitors and is a source of growth factors. Present study was undertaken to study the presence of stem cells in the pericardium. Intact adult mouse heart was subjected to partial enzymatic digestion to collect the pericardial\u00a0cells dislodged from the surface. Pericardial cells suspension was processed to enrich the stem cells using our recently published protocol. Two populations of stem cells were successfully enriched from the pericardium of adult mouse heart along with distinct 'cardiospheres' with cytoplasmic continuity (formed by rapid proliferation and incomplete cytokinesis). These included very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) and slightly bigger 'progenitors' cardiac stem cells (CSCs).

Although cardiac stem cells (CSCs) express estrogen receptors, yet the effects of estrogen on CSCs remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the potential role of estrogen in maintaining the quality of CSCs by in vivo and in vitro experiments. For the in vivo study, estrogen deficiency was induced by ovariectomy in 6-weeks-old C57BL/6 female mice, and then randomly given 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) replacements at a low dose (0.01 mg/60 days) and high dose (0.18 mg/60 days), or vehicle treatment. All mice were killed 2 months after treatments, and heart tissues were collected for ex vivo expansion of CSCs. Compared to age-matched healthy controls, estrogen deficiency slightly decreased the yield of CSCs with significantly lower telomerase activity and more DNA damage. Interestingly, E2 replacements at low and high doses significantly increased the yield of CSCs and reversed the quality impairment of CSCs following estrogen deficiency. For the in vitro study, twice-passaged CSCs from the hearts of adult healthy female mice were cultured with the supplement of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 \u03bcM E2 in the medium for 3 days. We found that E2 supplement increased c-kit expression, increased proliferative activity, improved telomerase activity, and reduced DNA damage of CSCs in a dose-dependent manner.

It is largely unknown to what extent Antarctic notothenioids possess the capacity to remodel their biological membranes in response to thermal change. In this study, physical and biochemical properties were examined in membranes prepared from gill epithelia (plasma membranes), cardiac ventricles (microsomes, mitochondria), and brains (synaptic membranes, myelin, mitochondria) from Notothenia coriiceps following acclimation to 5\u00a0\u00b0C (or held at ambient temperature, 0\u00a0\u00b0C) for a minimum of 6\u00a0weeks. Fluidity was measured between 0 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C in all membranes, and polar lipid compositions and cholesterol contents were analyzed in a subset of biological membranes from all tissues. Osmotic permeability was measured in gills at 0 and 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Gill plasma membranes, cardiac mitochondria, and cardiac microsomes displayed reduced fluidity following acclimation to 5\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating compensation for elevated temperature. In contrast, no fluidity changes with acclimation were observed in any of the membranes prepared from brain. In all membranes, adjustments to the relative abundances of major phospholipid classes, and to the extent of fatty acid unsaturation, were undetectable following thermal acclimation. However, alterations in cholesterol contents and acyl chain length, consistent with the changes in fluidity, were observed in membranes from gill and cardiac tissue. Water permeability was reduced with 5\u00a0\u00b0C acclimation in gills, indicating near-perfect homeostatic efficacy.

We previously found that liver ischemic preconditioning (RLIPC) could limit infarct size post I/R in non-diabetic rat hearts and further exerted anti-arrhythmic effects in diabetic or non-diabetic rats after myocardial I/R, however, little is known regarding the effect of RLIPC on infarct-sparing in diabetic hearts. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of RLIPC on I/R injury in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was induced by one-time intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were exposed to 45\u00a0min of left anterior descend in (LAD) coronary artery occlusion, followed by 3\u00a0h of reperfusion. For liver ischemic preconditioning, four cycles of 5\u00a0min of liver I/R stimuli were performed before LAD occlusion. The cardioprotective effect of RLIPC was determined in diabetic rats. Compared to non-RLIPC treated DM rats, RLIPC treatment significantly reduced infarct size and cardiac tissue damage, inhibited apoptosis in diabetic hearts post I/R. RLIPC also improved cardiac functions including LVESP, LVEDP, dp/dtmax, and -\u2009dp/dtmax. In addition, RLIPC preserved cardiac morphology by reducing the pathological score post I/R in diabetic hearts. Finally, Westernblotting showed that RLIPC stimulated phosphorylation of ventricular GSK-3\u03b2 and STAT-5, which are key components of RISK and SAFE signaling pathways.

{"title": "Adult tissue-resident stem cells-fact or fiction?", "abstract": "Life-long tissue homeostasis of adult tissues is supposedly maintained by the resident stem cells. These stem cells are quiescent in nature and rarely divide to self-renew and give rise to tissue-specific \"progenitors\" (lineage-restricted and tissue-committed) which divide rapidly and differentiate into tissue-specific cell types. However, it has proved difficult to isolate these quiescent stem cells as a physical entity. Recent single-cell RNAseq studies on several adult tissues including ovary, prostate, and cardiac tissues have not been able to detect stem cells. Thus, it has been postulated that adult cells dedifferentiate to stem-like state to ensure regeneration and can be defined as cells capable to replace lost cells through mitosis. This idea challenges basic paradigm of development biology regarding plasticity that a cell enters point of no return once it initiates differentiation. The underlying reason for this dilemma is that we are putting stem cells and somatic cells together while processing for various studies. Stem cells and adult mature cell types are distinct entities; stem cells are quiescent, small in size, and with minimal organelles whereas the mature cells are metabolically active and have multiple organelles lying in abundant cytoplasm. As a result, they do not pellet down together when centrifuged at 100-350g. At this speed, mature cells get collected but stem cells remain buoyant and can be pelleted by centrifuging at 1000g. Thus, inability to detect stem cells in recently published single-cell RNAseq studies is because the stem cells were unknowingly discarded while processing and were never subjected to RNAseq.

{"title": "Long term efficacy and fate of a right ventricular outflow tract replacement using an elastomeric cardiac patch consisting of caprolactone and D,L-lactide copolymers.", "abstract": "For decades, researchers have investigated the ideal material for clinical use in the cardiovascular field. Several substitute materials are used clinically, but each has drawbacks. Recently we developed biodegradable and elastic poly(\u03b5-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (P(CL-DLLA)) copolymers by adjusting the CL/DLLA composition, and evaluated the long-term efficacy and outcomes of these copolymers when used for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) replacement. This P(CL-DLLA) material was processed into a circular patch and used to replace a surgical defect in the RVOT of adult rats. Control rats were implanted with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). Histologic evaluation was performed at 8, 24, and 48 weeks post-surgery. All animals survived the surgery with no aneurysm formation or thrombus. In all periods, ePTFE demonstrated fibrous tissue. In contrast, at 8 weeks P(CL-DLLA) showed infiltration of macrophages and fibroblast-like cells into the remaining material. At 24 weeks, P(CL-DLLA) was absorbed completely, and muscle-like tissue was present with positive staining for \u03b1-sarcomeric actinin and cardiac troponin T (cTnT). At 48 weeks, the cTnT-positive area had increased. The biodegradable and elastic P(CL-DLLA) induced cardiac regeneration throughout the 48-week study period. Future application of this material as a cardiovascular scaffold seems promising. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biomaterials for reconstruction of tissue deficiencies in cardiovascular surgery require having suitable mechanical properties for cardiac tissue and biodegradation resulting in native tissue growth. Several biodegradable polymers such as poly-\u03b5-caprolactone (PCL) and polylactic acid (PLA) have excellent biocompatibility and already been widely used clinically. In general, PCL and PLA are quite mechanically rigid. Meanwhile, significant elasticity is required in the high-pressure environment of the heart while the material is being replaced by new tissue. The present study provides a novel four-armed crosslinked poly(\u03b5-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (i.e., P(CL-DLLA)) material for cardiac patch, which was demonstrated properties including tissue-compatible, super-elastic nature, that made it suitable for long-term, in vivo RVOT repair.

{"title": "Xanthine oxidase inhibition attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice.", "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that high serum uric acid (UA) is associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Although xanthine oxidase (XO) activation is a critical regulatory mechanism of the terminal step in ATP and purine degradation, the pathophysiological role of cardiac tissue XO in LV dysfunction remains unclear. We herein investigated the role and functional significance of tissue XO activity in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Either doxorubicin (10\u00a0mg/kg) or vehicle was intraperitonially administered in a single injection to mice. Mice were treated with or without oral XO-inhibitors (febuxostat 3\u00a0mg/kg/day or topiroxostat 5\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 8 days starting 24\u00a0h before doxorubicin injection. Cardiac tissue XO activity measured by a highly sensitive assay with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and cardiac UA content were significantly increased in doxorubicin-treated mice at day 7 and dramatically reduced by XO-inhibitors. Accordingly, XO-inhibitors substantially improved LV ejection fraction (assessed by echocardiography) and LV developed pressure (assessed by ex vivo Langendorff heart perfusion) impaired by doxorubicin administration. This was associated with an increase in XO-derived hydrogen peroxide production with concomitant upregulation of apoptotic and ferroptotic pathways, all of which were reduced by XO-inhibitors. Furthermore, metabolome analyses revealed enhanced purine metabolism in doxorubicin-treated hearts, and XO-inhibitors suppressed the serial metabolic reaction of hypoxanthine-xanthine-UA, the paths of ATP and purine degradation. In summary, doxorubicin administration induces cardiac tissue XO activation associated with impaired LV function. XO-inhibitors attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity through inhibition of XO-derived oxidative stress and cell death signals as well as the maintenance of cardiac energy metabolism associated with modulation of the purine metabolic pathway.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2021-01-21", "authors": ["YoshiroTanaka", "TomohisaNagoshi", "AkiraYoshii", "YuheiOi", "HirotakeTakahashi", "HarukaKimura", "KeiichiIto", "YusukeKashiwagi", "Toshikazu DTanaka", "MichihiroYoshimura"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.10.303"}

Major characteristics for HCM are the hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and development of cardiac fibrosis. Patients with HCM have a higher risk for sudden cardiac death compared to a healthy population. In the present study, we investigated the abundancy of selected proteins as potential biomarkers in patients with HCM. We included 60 patients with HCM and 28 healthy controls and quantitatively measured the rate of a set of 92 proteins already known to be associated with cardiometabolic processes via protein screening using the proximity extension assay technology in a subgroup of these patients (20 HCM and 10 healthy controls). After validation of four hits in the whole cohort of patients consisting of 88 individuals (60 HCM patients, 28 healthy controls) we found only one candidate, c-KIT, which was regulated significantly different between HCM patients and healthy controls and thus was chosen for further analyses. c-KIT is a tyrosine-protein kinase acting as receptor for the stem cell factor and activating several pathways essential for cell proliferation and survival, hematopoiesis, gametogenesis and melanogenesis. Serum protein levels of c-KIT were significantly lower in patients with HCM than in healthy controls, even after adjusting for confounding factors age and sex. In addition, c-KIT levels in human cardiac tissue of patients with HOCM were significant higher compared to controls indicating high levels of c-KIT in fibrotic myocardium. Furthermore, c-KIT concentration in serum significantly correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic diameter in HOCM, but not HCM patients. The present data suggest c-KIT as a novel biomarker differentiating between patients with HCM and healthy population and might provide further functional insights into fibrosis-related processes of HOCM.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-01-21", "authors": ["KristinaSonnenschein", "JanFiedler", "Davidde Gonzalo-Calvo", "KeXiao", "AngelikaPfanne", "AnnetteJust", "CarolinZwadlo", "SamiraSoltani", "UdoBavendiek", "TheresiaKraft", "CristobalDos Remedios", "SergheiCebotari", "JohannBauersachs", "ThomasThum"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-80868-z\n10.1056/NEJMra1710575\n10.1038/s41598-019-56617-2\n10.1152/ajpheart.00194.2016\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.05.185\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.09.041\n10.1093/ehjci/jez213\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.117.001974\n10.1093/cvr/cvy147\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042339\n10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00081-7\n10.1074/jbc.M312323200\n10.1007/s12079-017-0399-1\n10.1182/blood.V90.4.1345\n10.7150/thno.41616\n10.7150/thno.22027\n10.1200/JCO.2010.33.9275\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.05.045\n10.1159/000376573\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2480\n10.1080/2162402X.2020.1824863\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1897\n10.1002/path.4177\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1007/s40265-019-01210-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.210088\n10.1161/01.RES.0000243210.79654.fd\n10.1182/blood.V83.8.2145.2145\n10.1182/blood.V85.8.2052.bloodjournal8582052\n10.1182/blood.V85.1.66.bloodjournal85166\n10.1007/s10517-012-1761-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095192\n10.1002/pmic.201300334\n10.3390/jcm9010195\n10.1093/cvr/cvz063\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.09.003\n10.1093/nar/28.1.27\n10.1093/nar/gkaa970"}

The identified constituents in SMYAD were further analyzed using ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) prediction and molecular docking. The effective constituents were identified using isoproterenol (ISO)-induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and neochlorogenic acid (NCA), chlorogenic acid (CA), cryptochlorogenic acid (CCA), isochlorogenic acid C (ICAC), angoroside C (AGDC), isochlorogenic acid A (ICAA), sweroside (SRD), and harpagide (HPD) in SMYAD extract were quantified by HPLC for compatibility. Finally, anti-hypertrophic activities of candidate effective combinatorial components, which were prepared according to the determined molar concentration ratio of effective constituents using reference substance solution, were analyzed using immunofluorescence staining and Quantitative real-time PCR. The expression levels of PI3K\u03b1, p-ERK, p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR, mTOR and HIF-1\u03b1 were measured using Western blot.\n32 prototypes of SMYAD were identified from plasma and heart tissue of rat.

{"title": "Effect of Berberis vulgaris L. root extract on ifosfamide-induced in vivo toxicity and in vitro cytotoxicity.", "abstract": "Ifosfamide is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent having broad-spectrum efficacy against several tumors. However, nephro, hepato, neuro cardio, and hematological toxicities associated with ifosfamide render its use limited. These side effects could range from organ failure to life-threatening situations. The present study aimed to evaluate the attenuating efficiency of Berberis vulgaris root extract (BvRE), a potent nephroprotective, hepatoprotective, and lipid-lowering agent, against ifosfamide-induced toxicities. The study design comprised eight groups of Swiss albino rats to assess different dose regimes of BvRE and ifosfamide. Biochemical analysis of serum (serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, total cholesterol, and triglycerides) along with complete blood count was performed. Kidney, liver, brain, and heart tissue homogenates were used to find malondialdehyde, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase levels in addition to the acetylcholinesterase of brain tissue. The results were further validated with the help of the histopathology of the selected organs. HeLa cells were used to assess the effect of BvRE on ifosfamide cytotoxicity in MTT assay. The results revealed that pre- and post-treatment regimens of BvRE, as well as the combination therapy exhibited marked protective effects against ifosfamide-induced nephro, hepato, neuro, and cardiotoxicity. Moreover, ifosfamide depicted a synergistic in vitro cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells in the presence of BvRE. These results corroborate that the combination therapy of ifosfamide with BvRE in cancer treatment can potentiate the anticancer effects of ifosfamide along with the amelioration of its conspicuous side effects.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-01-20", "authors": ["ShaziaIlyas", "RaheelaTabasum", "AliIftikhar", "MamoonaNazir", "AminaHussain", "ArooshaHussain", "Muhammad SajjadAli", "FarooqSaleem", "UzmaSaleem", "MatheusFroeyen", "IskandarAbdullah", "Muhammad UsmanMirza", "SarfrazAhmad"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-80579-5\n10.3892/ijo.2018.4661\n10.2174/157488506775268515\n10.1159/000073351\n10.4143/crt.2011.43.4.260\n10.5455/2319-2003.ijbcp000812\n10.22038/IJBMS.2017.8690\n10.3748/wjg.14.1491\n10.22037/jps.v2i4.2716\n10.3390/antiox8060185\n10.1056/NEJMoa0802656\n10.1097/00007611-200295100-00024\n10.1016/S0887-2333(03)00044-4\n10.1007/BF01613221\n10.1177/0960327111432502\n10.1210/jc.2007-2404\n10.1111/j.1600-079X.2004.00131.x\n10.1038/bjp.2008.15\n10.1016/j.taap.2007.03.025\n10.1002/jcb.240531040\n10.1053/gast.2002.36061\n10.1006/rtph.1998.1201\n10.1111/j.1742-7843.2008.00343.x\n10.1159/000073350\n10.1208/s12249-011-9632-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077969\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.10.076\n10.1016/j.clon.2006.11.003\n10.1007/s00228-011-1108-2\n10.1016/j.jep.2011.08.058\n10.7326/0003-4819-118-1-199301010-00006\n10.3390/molecules190812349\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00734\n10.1016/0009-8981(76)90437-X\n10.1016/0003-2697(79)90738-3\n10.1016/0006-2952(61)90145-9"}

The mice were randomly allocated into five groups (n = 10 per group) as follows: Control; Diabetic group; Diabetic + Melatonin group; Diabetic + Exercise group; and Diabetic + Exercise + Melatonin group. 50 mg/kg streptozotocin was intraperitoneally administrated. In melatonin-treated groups, melatonin was injected intraperitoneally at 3 mg/kg body weight for four weeks and twice weekly. Swimming exercises were performed for four weeks. We measured cardiac superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase enzymes, malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant capacity. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Caspase\u20113, Sirtuin1, and Connexin-43 was measured using real-time PCR analysis. The vascular density was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using CD31 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin antibodies. The combination of melatonin and exercise elevated cardiac superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase coincided with the reduction of malondialdehyde and increase of total antioxidant capacity as compared to the diabetic mice (p < 0.05). In Diabetic + Exercise + Melatonin mice, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Caspase\u20113 was significantly down-regulated compared to the Diabetic group (p < 0.05). Melatonin and exercise suppressed the expression of Connexin-43 and Sirtuin1 in diabetic mice in comparison with the control mice (p < 0.05).

However, there is still a lack of studies on steroid hormones and their receptors during HF progression. Therefore, a porcine model of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy corresponding to HF was used to assess steroid hormone concentrations in serum and their nuclear receptor levels in heart tissue during the consecutive stages of HF.\nMale pigs underwent right ventricular pacing and developed a clinical picture of mild, moderate, or severe HF.

Androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, mineralocorticoid receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA levels in the left ventricle were determined by qPCR.The androgen level decreased in moderate and severe HF animals, while the corticosteroid level increased. The estradiol concentration remained stable. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed the downregulation of androgen receptor in consecutive stages of HF and increased expression of mineralocorticoid receptor messenger RNA under these conditions.\nIn the HF pig model, deteriorated catabolic/anabolic balance, manifested by upregulation of aldosterone and cortisol and downregulation of androgen signaling on the ligand level, was augmented by changes in steroid hormone receptor expression in the heart tissue.", "journal": "Journal of cardiac failure", "date": "2021-01-16", "authors": ["MaciejZacharski", "AlicjaTomaszek", "LilianaKiczak", "MaciejUgorski", "JacekBania", "UrszulaPas\u0142awska", "IlonaRybinska", "Ewa AnitaJankowska", "AdrianJaniszewski", "PiotrPonikowski"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.12.024"}

We developed a system that produces force-velocity curves and work loops in human EHTs using an adaptive iterative control scheme. We used human EHTs in this system to perform a detailed characterization of the cardiac \u03b2-myosin specific inhibitor, mavacamten. Consistent with the clinically proposed application of this drug to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, our data support the premise that mavacamten improves diastolic function through reduction of diastolic stiffness and isometric relaxation time. Meanwhile, the effects of mavacamten on length- and load-dependent muscle performance were mixed. The drug attenuated the length-dependent response at small stretch values but showed normal length dependency at longer lengths. Peak power output of mavacamten-treated EHTs showed reduced power output as expected but also shifted peak power output to a lower load. Here, we demonstrate a robust method for the generation of isotonic contraction series and work loops in engineered heart tissues using an adaptive-iterative method. This approach reveals new features of mavacamten pharmacology, including previously unappreciated effects on intrinsic myosin dynamics and preservation of Frank-Starling behavior at longer muscle lengths.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Nicorandil (NIC) affects myocardial injury, which may be related to the inhibition of apoptosis. However, the specific mechanism of cardioprotection has not been elucidated. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of NIC on cardiac function in rats subjected to CME and its effect on the high-temperature requirement peptidase 2/X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein/poly ADP-ribose polymerase (HtrA2/XIAP/PARP) pathway. Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups: Sham, CME, CME\u00a0+\u00a0NIC, and CME\u00a0+\u00a0UCF. Echocardiography was performed 9\u00a0hours after CME. Myocardial injury markers were evaluated in blood samples, and the heart tissue was collected for hematoxylin-eosin staining, hematoxylin basic fuchsin picric acid staining staining, TdT-mediated DUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, Western blot analysis of the HtrA2/XIAP/PARP pathway, and transmission electron microscopy. NIC ameliorated cardiac dysfunctioncaused by CME and reduced serum levels of CK-MB and LDH. In addition, NIC decreased myocardial microinfarct size and apoptotic index. NIC reduced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, levels of cleaved caspase 3/9, cytoplasmic HtrA2, and cleaved PARP, and increased the level of XIAP. The effects of NIC were similar to those of the HtrA2 inhibitor, UCF101. This study demonstrated that NIC reduces CME-induced myocardial injury, reduces mitochondrial damage, and improves myocardial function.

Although various tissues can be produced in vitro, there are many issues surrounding the stability and reproducibility of the preparation of 3D tissues. Thus, although many bioprinters have been developed, none can efficiently, reproducibly and precisely produce small 3D tissues (\u03bcm-mm order) such as spheroids, which are most commonly used in drug development. The 3D cardiac tissue chips were successfully constructed with a similar number of cells as conventional 2D tissue using a pin type bioprinter, and corresponding drug-induced cardiotoxicities were obtained with known compounds that induce cardiotoxicity. The 3D cardiac tissue chips displayed uniform cell density and completely synchronized electrophysiological properties as compared to 2D tissue.

However, existing stimulation techniques, such as external platinum electrodes or opaque microelectrode arrays patterned on glass substrates, have limited throughput, reproducibility, or compatibility with other desirable features of heart-on-a-chip systems, such as the use of tunable culture substrates, imaging accessibility, or enclosure in a microfluidic device. In this study, indium tin oxide (ITO), a conductive, semi-transparent, and biocompatible material, was deposited onto glass and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated coverslips as parallel or point stimulation electrodes using laser-cut tape masks. ITO caused substrate discoloration but did not prevent brightfield imaging. ITO-patterned substrates were microcontact printed with arrayed lines of fibronectin and seeded with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, which assembled into aligned cardiac tissues. ITO deposited as parallel or point electrodes was connected to an external stimulator and used to successfully stimulate micropatterned cardiac tissues to generate calcium transients or propagating calcium waves, respectively. ITO electrodes were also integrated into the cantilever-based muscular thin film (MTF) assay to stimulate and quantify the contraction of micropatterned cardiac tissues. To demonstrate the potential for multiple ITO electrodes to be integrated into larger, multiplexed systems, two sets of ITO electrodes were deposited onto a single substrate and used to stimulate the contraction of distinct micropatterned cardiac tissues independently. Collectively, these approaches for integrating ITO electrodes into heart-on-a-chip devices are relatively facile, modular, and scalable and could have diverse applications in microphysiological systems of excitable tissues.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2021-01-14", "authors": ["Joycelyn KYip", "DebarghyaSarkar", "Andrew PPetersen", "Jennifer NGipson", "JunTao", "SalilKale", "Megan LRexius-Hall", "NathanCho", "Natalie NKhalil", "RehanKapadia", "Megan LMcCain"], "doi": "10.1039/d0lc00948b"}

{"title": "Stress reactivity elicits a tissue-specific reduction in telomere length in aging zebrafish (Danio rerio).", "abstract": "Individual differences in personality are associated with variation in healthy aging. Health behaviours are often cited as the likely explanation for this association; however, an underlying biological mechanism may also exist. Accelerated leukocyte telomere shortening is implicated in multiple age-related diseases and is associated with chronic activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, providing a link between stress-related personality differences and adverse health outcomes. However, the effects of the HPA axis are tissue specific. Thus, leukocyte telomere length may not accurately reflect telomere length in disease-relevant tissues. Here, we examined the correlation between stress reactivity and telomere length in heart and brain tissue in young (6-9\u00a0month) and aging (18\u00a0month) zebrafish. Stress reactivity was assessed by tank diving and through gene expression. Telomere length was assessed using quantitative PCR. We show that aging zebrafish have shorter telomeres in both heart and brain. Telomere length was inversely related to stress reactivity in heart but not brain of aging individuals. These data support the hypotheses that an anxious predisposition contributes to accelerated telomere shortening in heart tissue, which may have important implications for our understanding of age-related heart disease, and that stress reactivity contributes to age-related telomere shortening in a tissue-specific manner.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-01-13", "authors": ["James REvans", "Jose VTorres-P\u00e9rez", "Maria ElenaMiletto Petrazzini", "RivaRiley", "Caroline HBrennan"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-79615-1\n10.1111/j.2044-8260.1994.tb01152.x\n10.1007/s12160-009-9111-x\n10.1017/S0033291717002471\n10.1016/j.eurpsy.2014.03.003\n10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.01.001\n10.1073/pnas.1322145111\n10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00492-5\n10.1038/sj.onc.1202898\n10.1101/gad.13.18.2388\n10.1016/S1097-2765(04)00256-4\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.12.021\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfq007\n10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.07.014\n10.1016/j.appet.2005.05.001\n10.1016/j.biopsycho.2008.10.004\n10.1097/PSY.0b013e31822f9cd7\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.11.016\n10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2011.08.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017837\n10.1212/WNL.0000000000000907\n10.1002/mds.23230\n10.1016/S0140-6736(96)90007-0\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.2000.00603.x\n10.1186/1742-2094-11-34\n10.1073/pnas.0407162101\n10.1016/j.tree.2005.11.007\n10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.02.004\n10.3233/JPD-191724\n10.1093/gerona/glw053\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.113.000485\n10.1016/j.yfrne.2012.11.002\n10.3389/fendo.2014.00073\n10.1242/dmm.017004\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.12.008\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.07.033\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1005798\n10.1016/S0531-5565(03)00108-6\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016955\n10.1242/dmm.025130\n10.1089/zeb.2013.0952\n10.2144/00291bm09\n10.1186/gb-2007-8-2-r19\n10.1073/pnas.1609411114\n10.1093/nar/30.10.e47\n10.18637/jss.v067.i01\n10.32614/RJ-2017-066\n10.1016/j.tree.2008.10.008\n10.1210/en.2014-1048\n10.1186/1471-2202-15-29\n10.1101/gad.1253004\n10.1002/(SICI)1099-1166(1998100)13:10<717::AID-GPS857>3.0.CO;2-M\n10.1016/j.bbr.2005.03.005\n10.1016/S0166-4328(02)00018-9\n10.1002/hup.470050211\n10.1016/j.pbb.2017.01.005\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.12.032\n10.1007/BF00652231\n10.1177/2470289718795177\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246876\n10.1037/0033-2909.131.2.260\n10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.08.011\n10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.03.002\n10.1016/j.bbi.2007.12.004\n10.1038/mp.2014.119\n10.1530/EC-18-0362\n10.1126/scisignal.aau9685\n10.1038/ncomms6863\n10.1016/j.tig.2013.07.003\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.07.064\n10.1016/j.molcel.2019.04.024\n10.1038/sj.mp.4002095\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.007150\n10.1080/15622975.2016.1273550\n10.1002/da.20686\n10.1038/tp.2015.134\n10.1155/2016/5371050\n10.1016/j.exger.2007.05.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007688"}

{"title": "MicroRNA bta-miR-365-3p inhibits proliferation but promotes differentiation of primary bovine myoblasts by targeting the activin A receptor type I.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators that repress translation or degrade mRNA transcripts. Each microRNA has many mRNA targets and each mRNA may be targeted by several microRNAs. Skeletal muscles express a plethora of microRNA genes that regulate muscle development and function by controlling the expression of protein-coding target genes. To expand our understanding of the role of microRNA, specifically bta-miR-365-3p, in muscle biology, we investigated its functions in regulating primary bovine myoblast proliferation and differentiation.\nFirstly, we found that bta-miR-365-3p was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissue in Chinese Qinchuan beef cattle. Quantitative PCR and western blotting results showed that overexpression of bta-miR-365-3p significantly reduced the expression levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1), cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) but stimulated the expression levels of muscle differentiation markers, i.e., MYOD1, MYOG at both mRNA and protein level. Moreover, downregulation of bta-miR-365-3p increased the expression of CCND1, CDK2 and PCNA but decreased the expression of MYOD1 and MYOG at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, flow cytometry, EdU proliferation assays and immunostaining results showed that increased levels of bta-miR-365-3p suppressed cell proliferation but promoted myotube formation, whereas decreased levels of bta-miR-365-3p resulted in the opposite consequences. Finally, we identified that activin A receptor type I (ACVR1) could be a direct target of bta-miR-365-3p. It was demonstrated that bta-miR-365-3p can bind to the 3'UTR of ACVR1 gene to regulate its expression based on dual luciferase gene reporter assays. Consistently, knock-down of ACVR1 was associated with decreased expressions of CDK2, CCND1 and PCNA but increased expression of MYOG and MYOD1 both at mRNA and protein level.\nCollectively, these data suggested that bta-miR-365-3p represses proliferation but promotes differentiation of bovine myoblasts through several biological mechanisms involving downregulation of ACVR1.", "journal": "Journal of animal science and biotechnology", "date": "2021-01-13", "authors": ["DanHao", "XiaogangWang", "XiaoWang", "BoThomsen", "YuYang", "XianyongLan", "YongzhenHuang", "HongChen"], "doi": "10.1186/s40104-020-00528-0\n10.1242/dev.151035\n10.1152/physrev.00043.2011\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.05.010\n10.1016/0092-8674(93)90529-Y\n10.1007/s00335-009-9241-2\n10.1093/nar/gky1141\n10.1007/s13105-010-0050-6\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.030\n10.4161/cc.10.3.14710\n10.1113/jphysiol.2010.194175\n10.1097/JES.0b013e31821c01e1\n10.1186/1471-2199-10-90\n10.2527/jas.2012-5371\n10.1186/1471-2164-14-42\n10.1186/s11658-016-0009-x\n10.1096/fj.11-185132\n10.1007/s00441-012-1422-8\n10.7554/eLife.05005\n10.1093/nar/gks901\n10.1089/omi.2011.0118\n10.1016/S0955-0674(00)00151-4\n10.1007/s00018-008-8305-x\n10.1016/S0955-0674(03)00008-5\n10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.04.040\n10.1093/nar/gkx1067\n10.1002/jcp.27146\n10.1002/jcp.28232\n10.1016/j.omtn.2018.02.012\n10.1017/S1751731110001448\n10.2741/A548\n10.1186/1479-5876-11-310\n10.4161/cc.11.1.18576\n10.1016/j.biopha.2015.07.026\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.11.003\n10.4174/astr.2017.92.2.55\n10.7150/ijms.8938\n10.1002/jcb.24841\n10.1016/j.febslet.2013.04.029\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.08.027\n10.1038/boneres.2016.5\n10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.9.1593\n10.1152/ajpheart.00879.2015\n10.1038/ng1783\n10.1038/ng.2925\n10.1038/ng.2950\n10.1016/j.livsci.2019.05.005"}

In the end, animals were anesthetized and the heart of each rat was dissected for biochemical assay.\nMalondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were assessed in the cardiac tissue of rats.\nThe results indicated an increase in the levels of MDA and NO, and also a decline in the levels of GSH and TAC as well as a decrease in the SOD activity in the heart of aged rats compared with young rats. CPF administration deteriorated these changes in the heart of exposed rats compared with the age-matched controls.

Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of CRIF1 showed impaired mitochondrial function and cardiomyopathy. We developed an endothelial cell-specific CRIF1 deletion mouse to ascertain whether dysfunctional endothelial CRIF1 influences cardiac function and is mediated by the antioxidant protein sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). We also examined the effect of the potent SIRT1 activator SRT1720 on cardiac dysfunction. Mice with endothelial cell-specific CRIF1 deletion showed an increased heart-to-body weight ratio, increased lethality, and markedly reduced fractional shortening of the left ventricle, resulting in severe cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, endothelial cell-specific CRIF1 deletion resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced ATP levels, inflammation, and excessive oxidative stress in heart tissues, associated with decreased SIRT1 expression. Intraperitoneal injection of SRT1720 ameliorated cardiac dysfunction by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting inflammation. Furthermore, the decreased endothelial junction-associated protein zonula occludens-1 in CRIF1-deleted mice was significantly recovered after SRT1720 treatment.

The microbiota plays a fundamental role on the induction, training and function of the host immune system and the immune system has largely evolved in order to maintain the symbiotic relationship of the host with these diverse microbes. Thus, expanding our knowledge on bat-associated microbiome it can be usefully in understanding bats' outstanding immune capacities.

{"title": "Persistence of intramyocardially transplanted murine induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from different developmental stages.", "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) are regarded as promising cell type for cardiac cell replacement therapy, but it is not known whether the developmental stage influences their persistence and functional integration in the host tissue, which are crucial for a long-term therapeutic benefit. To investigate this, we first tested the cell adhesion capability of murine iPSC-CM in vitro at three different time points during the differentiation process and then examined cell persistence and quality of electrical integration in the infarcted myocardium in vivo.\nTo test cell adhesion capabilities in vitro, iPSC-CM were seeded on fibronectin-coated cell culture dishes and decellularized ventricular extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds. After fixed periods of time, stably attached cells were quantified. For in vivo experiments, murine iPSC-CM expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein was injected into infarcted hearts of adult mice. After 6-7\u2009days, viable ventricular tissue slices were prepared to enable action potential (AP) recordings in transplanted iPSC-CM and surrounding host cardiomyocytes. Afterwards, slices were lysed, and genomic DNA was prepared, which was then used for quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate grafted iPSC-CM count.\nThe in vitro results indicated differences in cell adhesion capabilities between day 14, day 16, and day 18 iPSC-CM with day 14 iPSC-CM showing the largest number of attached cells on ECM scaffolds. After intramyocardial injection, day 14 iPSC-CM showed a significant higher cell count compared to day 16 iPSC-CM. AP measurements revealed no significant difference in the quality of electrical integration and only minor differences in AP properties between d14 and d16 iPSC-CM.\nThe results of the present study demonstrate that the developmental stage at the time of transplantation is crucial for the persistence of transplanted iPSC-CM. iPSC-CM at day 14 of differentiation showed the highest persistence after transplantation in vivo, which may be explained by a higher capability to adhere to the extracellular matrix.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2021-01-10", "authors": ["GabrielPeinkofer", "MartinaMaass", "KurtPfannkuche", "AgapiosSachinidis", "StephanBaldus", "J\u00fcrgenHescheler", "TomoSaric", "MarcelHalbach"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-020-02089-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.128413\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1038/nature05934\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.769562\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.12.008\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1021/mp400258d\n10.1021/mp2001704\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf8781\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.009\n10.1038/d41586-018-05278-8\n10.3727/096368916X692870\n10.1124/jpet.118.256065\n10.2967/jnumed.107.042838\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.04.079\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.2.193\n10.33594/000000092\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.153643\n10.1093/cvr/cvt213\n10.1161/01.RES.79.1.79\n10.1161/01.RES.81.1.120\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4695(199810)37:1<37::AID-NEU4>3.0.CO;2-9\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.12.115\n10.1089/scd.2016.0073\n10.1038/nbt1335\n10.1016/j.scr.2016.07.007\n10.1186/s12859-017-1934-z\n10.1159/000110443\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1491\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044228\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.027\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000016063.66513.BB\n10.1159/000095132\n10.1097/TP.0000000000002765\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehi818\n10.1007/s00259-013-2480-1\n10.1083/jcb.124.4.619\n10.1089/scd.2009.0255\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.2009.00796.x\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.12.033\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.301275\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.09.001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.085\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.06.031\n10.1371/journal.pone.0045963\n10.1159/000227815\n10.1159/000369697\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.06.017"}

This study evaluated the effects of a chemically characterized AWA by chemical content, evaluated its effects in suprarenal abdominal aortic coarctation surgery (AAC)-induced chronic heart failure (CHF) in rats, and revealed the underlying mechanisms of action by proteomics.\nRats were distributed into different groups: sham, model, and AWA-treated groups (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day). Sham rats received surgery without AAC, whereas model rats an AWA-treated groups underwent AAC surgery. after 8 weeks, the treatment group was fed AWA for 4 weeks, and body weight was assessed weekly. At the end of the treatment, heart function was tested by echocardiography. AAC-induced chronic heart failure, including myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and apoptosis, was evaluated in heart tissue and plasma by RT-qPCR, ELISA, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, TUNEL staining, and immunofluorescence staining of \u03b1-SMA, Col \u2160, and Col \u2162. Then, a proteomics approach was used to explore the underlying mechanisms of action of AWA in chronic heart failure.\nAWA administration reduced body weight gain, myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and apoptosis, and rats showed improvement in cardiac function compared to model group. The extract significantly ameliorated the AAC-induced altered expression of heart failure markers such as ANP, NT-proBNP, and \u03b2-MHC, as well as fibrosis, hypertrophy markers MMP-2 and MMP-9, and other heart failure-related factors including plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Furthermore, the extract reduced the protein expression of \u03b1-SMA, Col \u2160, and Col \u2162 in the left ventricular (LV), thus inhibiting the LV remodeling associated with CHF. In addition, proteomics characterization of differentially expressed proteins showed that AWA administration inhibited left ventricular remodeling in CHF rats via a calcium signaling pathway, and reversed the expression of RyR2 and SERCA2a.\nAWA extract exerts beneficial effects in an AAC-induced CHF model in rats, which was associated with an improvement in LV function, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and apoptotic status. These effects may be related to the regulation of calcium signaling by the altered expression of RyR2 and SERCA2a.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2021-01-09", "authors": ["XinXu", "XiaofangXie", "HuiqiongZhang", "PeiWang", "GangminLi", "JunrenChen", "GuanruChen", "XiaoyuCao", "LiangXiong", "FuPeng", "ChengPeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2020.111184"}

The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-471-3p/silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) pathway is involved in the macrophage polarization during the development of DCM.\nImmunohistochemical staining was used to detect M1 and M2 macrophages infiltration in the heart tissue. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of M1 and M2 macrophages. Expression of miR-471-3p was quantified by real time quantitative-PCR. Transfection of miRNA inhibitor into RAW264.7 cells was performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.

Several microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are known to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of VMC. The study aimed to decipher the role of miR-30a-5p in the underlying mechanisms of VMC pathogenesis. We first quantified miR-30a-5p expression in a CVB3-induced mouse VMC model. The physiological characteristics of mouse cardiac tissues were then detected by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Picrosirius red staining. We established the correlation between miR-30a-5p and SOCS1, using dual-luciferase gene assay and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The expression of inflammatory factors (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13), M1 polarization markers [TNF-\u03b1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)], M2 polarization markers (Arg-1, IL-10), and myocardial hypertrophy markers [atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)] was detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. miR-30a-5p was found to be highly expressed in VMC mice. Silencing of miR-30a-5p improved the cardiac function index and reduced heart weight-to-body weight ratio, myocardial tissue pathological changes and fibrosis degree, serological indexes, as well as proinflammatory factor levels, while enhancing anti-inflammatory factor levels in VMC mice. Furthermore, silencing of miR-30a-5p inhibited M1 polarization of macrophages while promoting M2 polarization in vivo and in vitro. SOCS1 was a target gene of miR-30a-5p, and the aforementioned cardioprotective effects of miR-30a-5p silencing were reversed upon silencing of SOCS1.

{"title": "Sodium channel \u03b21 subunits participate in regulated intramembrane proteolysis-excitation coupling.", "abstract": "Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in SCN1B, encoding voltage-gated sodium channel \u03b21 subunits, are linked to human diseases with high risk of sudden death, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and cardiac arrhythmia. \u03b21 Subunits modulate the cell-surface localization, gating, and kinetics of sodium channel pore-forming \u03b1 subunits. They also participate in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, resulting in intracellular signal transduction, promotion of cell migration, calcium handling, and regulation of cell morphology. Here, we investigated regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of \u03b21 by BACE1 and \u03b3-secretase and show that \u03b21 subunits are substrates for sequential RIP by BACE1 and \u03b3-secretase, resulting in the generation of a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that is translocated to the nucleus. Using RNA sequencing, we identified a subset of genes that are downregulated by \u03b21-ICD overexpression in heterologous cells but upregulated in Scn1b-null cardiac tissue, which lacks \u03b21-ICD signaling, suggesting that the \u03b21-ICD may normally function as a molecular brake on gene transcription in vivo. We propose that human disease variants resulting in SCN1B LOF cause transcriptional dysregulation that contributes to altered excitability.

Recent studies have shown that Lefty1, a novel member of TGF-\u03b2 superfamily, acts as a brake on the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway in non-cardiac tissues. However, its role in myocardial infarction (MI)-induced fibrosis and left ventricular remodeling has not been fully elucidated. Here, for the first time, we reported that Lefty1 alleviated post-MI fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, and secretion through suppressing p-Smad2 and p-ERK1/2 signaling pathways in vivo and in vitro. In MI mice or TGF-\u03b21-treated neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs), the expression of Lefty1 was upregulated. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Lefty1 significantly attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced CFBs' proliferation, differentiation, and collagen production. Using the adeno-associated virus approach, we confirmed that Lefty1 attenuates MI-induced cardiac injury, as evidenced by the decreased infarct size and preserved cardiac function. These results highlight the importance of Lefty1 in the prevention of post-MI fibrosis and may help identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention of cardiac fibrosis.

To explore the effect of MPs on cardiac tissue in Wistar rats and unravel the mechanism of pyroptosis and oxidative stress in the process of cardiomyocytes injury, 32 male Wister rats were divided into control group and three model groups, which were exposed to 0.5\u2009mm PS MPs at 0.5, 5 and 50\u2009mg/L for 90\u2009days. Results revealed that MPs could damage cardiac structure and function with impaired mitochondria integrity, as well as increased levels of creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponinI (cTnI). Moreover, MPs administration triggered oxidative stress as indicated by increased levels of malondialdehyde and decreased activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Treatment with MPs resulted in apoptosis and pyroptosis as evidenced by increasing expressions of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-18. Additionally, MPs were shown to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasomes activation in cardiac tissue, enabling activation of Caspase-1-dependent signaling pathway induced by inflammatory stimuli resulting from oxidative stress.

We previously demonstrated that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is responsible for the progression of aortic valvular calcification in CAVD animal models. As evogliptin, one of the DPP-4 inhibitors displays high specific accumulation in cardiac tissue, we here evaluated its therapeutic potency for attenuating valvular calcification in CAVD animal models. Evogliptin administration markedly reduced calcific deposition accompanied by a reduction in proinflammatory cytokine expression in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient mice in vivo, and significantly ameliorated the mineralization of the primary human valvular interstitial cells (VICs), with a reduction in the mRNA expression of bone-associated and fibrosis-related genes in vitro. In addition, evogliptin ameliorated the rate of change in the transaortic peak velocity and mean pressure gradients in our rabbit model as assessed by echocardiography. Importantly, evogliptin administration in a rabbit model was found to suppress the effects of a high-cholesterol diet and of vitamin D2-driven fibrosis in association with a reduction in macrophage infiltration and calcific deposition in aortic valves.

However, evidence for intracellular effects of MMPs is emerging. Pro- and anti-hypertrophic cardiac effects are described. This may be due to the various sources of different MMPs in the heart tissue. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the role of MMPs in hypertrophic growth of isolated rat ventricular cardiac myocytes.\nCardiomyocytes were isolated form ventricular tissues of the rat hearts by collagenase perfusion. RT-qPCR, western blots, and zymography were used for expression and MMP activity analysis. Cross-sectional area and the rate of protein synthesis were determined as parameters for hypertrophic growth.\nMMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-14 mRNAs were detected in cardiomyocytes, and protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14 was identified. Hypertrophic stimulation of cardiomyocytes did not enhance, but interestingly decreased expression of MMPs, indicating that downregulation of MMPs may promote hypertrophic growth. Indeed, the nonselective MMP inhibitors TAPI-0 or TIMP2 and the MMP-2-selective ARP-100 enhanced hypertrophic growth. Furthermore, TAPI-0 increased phosphorylation and thus activation of extracellular signaling kinase (ERK) and Akt (protein kinase B), as well as inhibition of glycogen synthase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2). Abrogation of MEK/ERK- or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt/GSK3\u03b2-signaling with PD98059 or LY290042, respectively, inhibited hypertrophic growth under TAPI-0.\nMMPs' inhibition promotes hypertrophic growth in cardiomyocytes in vitro.

{"title": "Functionally Integrated Top-Down Proteomics for Standardized Assessment of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Engineered Cardiac Tissues.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived engineered cardiac tissues (hiPSC-ECTs) have emerged as a promising alternative to two-dimensional hiPSC-cardiomyocyte monolayer systems because hiPSC-ECTs are a closer representation of endogenous cardiac tissues and more faithfully reflect the relevant cardiac pathophysiology. The ability to perform functional and molecular assessments using the same hiPSC-ECT construct would allow for more reliable correlation between observed functional performance and underlying molecular events, and thus is critically needed. Herein, for the first time, we have established an integrated method that permits sequential assessment of functional properties and top-down proteomics from the same single hiPSC-ECT construct. We quantitatively determined the differences in isometric twitch force and the sarcomeric proteoforms between two groups of hiPSC-ECTs that differed in the duration of time of 3D-ECT culture. Importantly, by using this integrated method we discovered a new and strong correlation between the measured contractile parameters and the phosphorylation levels of alpha-tropomyosin between the two groups of hiPSC-ECTs. The integration of functional assessments together with molecular characterization by top-down proteomics in the same hiPSC-ECT construct enables a holistic analysis of hiPSC-ECTs to accelerate their applications in disease modeling, cardiotoxicity, and drug discovery.

{"title": "SARS-Cov-2 fulminant myocarditis: an autopsy and histopathological case study.", "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to SARS-CoV-2, is primarily a respiratory disease, causing in most severe cases life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cardiovascular involvement can also occur, such as thrombosis or myocarditis, generally associated with pulmonary lesions. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis. We report the case of a 69-year-old man suffering from a refractory cardiogenic shock, without significant lung involvement. Prior to death, several nasopharyngeal swabs and distal bronchoalveolar lavage were sampled in order to perform RT-PCR analyses for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, which all gave negative results. Autopsy showed coronary atherosclerosis, without acute complication. Microscopic examination of the heart revealed the existence of an intense multifocal inflammatory infiltration, in both ventricles and septum, composed in its majority of macrophages and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4/CD8 ratio: 0.11). Immunohistochemistry for anti-SARS nucleocapsid protein antibody was strongly positive in myocardial cells, but not in lung tissue. RT-PCR was realized on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung and heart tissue blocks: only heart tissue was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In conclusion, this exhaustive post-mortem pathological case study of fulminant myocarditis demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in heart tissue, without significant lung involvement. Immunohistochemistry showed that the virus was specifically localized in cardiomyocytes and induced a strong cytotoxic T cells inflammatory response. This case report thus gives new insight in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis and emphasizes on the importance and reliability of post-mortem analyses in order to better understand the physiopathology of this worldwide spreading new viral disease.", "journal": "International journal of legal medicine", "date": "2021-01-05", "authors": ["GuillaumeGauchotte", "V\u00e9roniqueVenard", "Micha\u00eblSegondy", "CyrilCadoz", "AudeEsposito-Fava", "DamienBarraud", "GuillaumeLouis"], "doi": "10.1007/s00414-020-02500-z\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa664\n10.1007/s00414-020-02317-w\n10.1542/peds.2020-1509\n10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa212\n10.1007/s15010-020-01424-5\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa515\n10.1136/bcr-2020-237553\n10.1016/j.jaccas.2020.05.060\n10.7326/M20-2003\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa160\n10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107233\n10.1002/ejhf.1828\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa267\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050097"}
{"title": "Effects of Melatonin and Adrenomedullin in Reducing the Cardiotoxic Effects of Doxorubicin in Rats.", "abstract": "The main disadvantage of doxorubicin (DOX) is that it has cardiotoxic side effects. Our aim is to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of adrenomedullin (ADM) and to compare these effects with melatonin (MEL), it's cardioprotective effects are well known. Rats were divided into four groups: Control group (0.9% NaCl solution, intravenously), Doxorubicin group (45\u00a0mg/kg DOX, intravenously), Doxorubicin\u2009+\u2009Melatonin group (DOX\u2009+\u2009MEL, 10\u00a0mg/kg melatonin, intraperitoneally), Doxorubicin\u2009+\u2009Adrenomedullin group (DOX\u2009+\u2009ADM, 12\u00a0\u00b5g/kg adrenomedullin, intraperitoneally). A single dose of DOX was injected to the experimental groups on day 5, and a single dose of 0.9% NaCl solution was injected to the control group through the tail vein. The animals were anesthetized and ECG recordings were obtained on day 8. For the purpose of biochemical and histological analysis, cardiac tissue biopsy was obtained after ECG recordings. Compared to the control group, the DOX group had significantly increased duration of QRS complex, PR interval, QT interval and QTc interval. QRS complex, QT interval and QTc interval were prolonged with the administration of DOX and shortened with the administration of ADM. MEL weakened the toxic effects of DOX on the cardiac tissue and it is shown histologically. DOX increased interleukins (IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), and total oxidant status (TOS) levels in cardiac tissue, while reducing total antioxidant status (TAS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels. MEL administration decreased the levels of CK-MB, MDA, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-18, NO, and TNF-\u03b1, whereas ADM only decreased IL-1\u03b1, IL-18, MDA and TNF-\u03b1 levels. In summary, these results show that DOX has toxic effects on rat cardiac tissue which is documented histologically, electrocardiographically and biochemically.

The current study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of polydatin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (PD-CSNPs), polydatin (PD) and metformin (MET) on diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats. Rats divided into six groups; normal-control, diabetic-control, diabetic + CSNPs (diabetic rats treated with 50 mg/kg blank chitosan nanoparticles), diabetic + PD-CSNPs (diabetic rats treated with PD-CSNPs equivalent to 50 mg/kg of polydatin), diabetic + PD (diabetic rats given 50 mg/kg polydatin), diabetic + MET (diabetic rats given 100 mg/kg metformin), orally and daily for 4 weeks. Treatment of diabetic rats with PD-CSNPs, PD and MET showed a significant reduction in the values of glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin with improvement in heart function biomarkers through decreasing serum creatine kinase and creatine kinase myocardial band activities compared to diabetic control. The treatment agents also suppressed the elevated lipid peroxidation product, increased values of glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, superoxide peroxidase, and catalase activities in the heart of diabetic treated rats. Furthermore, PD-CSNPs, PD and MET decreased heart tissue levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine; tumor necrosis factor-alpha and nuclear factor-kappa \u03b2, upregulation of heart gene expressions; nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1. Histological and ultrastructural examinations revealed the ameliorative effect of PD-CSNPs, PD and MET against the harmful of diabetic cardiomyopathy by reducing the cardiac fibers, necrotic cardiac myocytes, inflammatory cell infiltration, and the arrangement of the myofibrils and intercalated discs.

Robust, flexible, and self-supported 3-layers films made of two spin-coated poly(lactic acid) (PLA) layers separated by an electropolymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) layer, are used as loading and delivery systems. Films with outer layers prepared using homochiral PLA and with nanoperforations of diameter 146 \u00b1 70 experience more bulk erosion, which also contributes to the release of L-lactic acid, than those obtained using heterochiral PLA and with nanoperforations of diameter 66 \u00b1 24. Moreover, the release of L-lactic acid as degradation product is accelerated by applying biphasic electrical pulses. The four approaches used for loading extra L-lactate in the 3-layered films were: incorporation of L-lactate at the intermediate PEDOT layer as primary dopant agent using (1) organic or (2) basic water solutions as reaction media; (3) substitution at the PEDOT layer of the ClO", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2021-01-04", "authors": ["AnnaPuiggal\u00ed-Jou", "Jes\u00fasOrdo\u00f1o", "Luis JDel Valle", "SoledadP\u00e9rez-Amodio", "ElisabethEngel", "CarlosAlem\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.12.049"}

To direct the function of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived CM and EC seeded on biomaterials, we replicated cell-collagen interactions, which regulate cellular behaviour in the native myocardium, using triple-helical peptides (THPs) that are ligands for collagen-binding proteins. THPs enhanced proliferation and activity of CMs and ECs separately and in co-culture, drove CM maturation and enabled coordinated cellular contraction on collagen films.

In the Single-Dose CPM group, CK-MB and IMA levels significantly increased while SOD and CAT levels significantly decreased. However, the heart tissues were damaged. CK-MB and IMA levels significantly decreased in CP+ ES Group. On the other hand, SOD, and CAT levels significantly increased and reduced the damage remarkably. Our findings showed that ES treatment successfully reduced the toxic effects upon the rats. The conclusion is that ES treatment can help protect the heart tissue against CPM-induced toxicity. Both in-vivo results and molecular modeling studies showed that the negative effects of CPM upon SOD activity were bigger than that of CAT.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2021-01-01", "authors": ["FatmaG\u00fcr", "MustafaCengiz", "Hatice MehtapKutlu", "Bet\u00fcl PekerCengiz", "AdnanAyhanc\u0131"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2020.115386"}

In the absence of an effective treatment, different drugs with unknown effectiveness, including antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), with or without concurrent administration with azithromycin (AZM), have been tested for treating COVID-19 patients with developed pneumonia. However, the efficacy and safety of HCQ and/or AZM have been questioned by recent clinical reports. Direct effects of these drugs on the human heart remain very poorly defined. To better understand the mechanisms of action of HCQ +/- AZM, we employed bioengineered human ventricular cardiac tissue strip (hvCTS) and anisotropic sheet (hvCAS) assays, made with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hvCMs), which have been designed for measuring cardiac contractility and electrophysiology, respectively. Our hvCTS experiments showed that AZM induced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect which could be aggravated by HCQ; electrophysiologically, as revealed by the hvCAS platform, AZM prolonged action potentials and induced spiral wave formations. Collectively, our data were consistent with reported clinical risks of HCQ and AZM on QTc prolongation/ventricular arrhythmias and development of heart failure. In conclusion, our study exposed the risks of HCQ/AZM administration while providing mechanistic insights for their toxicity. Our bioengineered human cardiac tissue constructs therefore provide a useful platform for screening cardiac safety and efficacy when developing therapeutics against COVID-19.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2020-12-30", "authors": ["Andy On-TikWong", "BimalGurung", "Wing SumWong", "Suet YeeMak", "Wan WaiTse", "Chloe MLi", "Deborah KLieu", "Kevin DCosta", "Ronald ALi", "Roger JHajjar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.12.014"}
{"title": "The protective effect of the cardiac thioredoxin system on the heart in the case of iron overload in mice.", "abstract": "Iron, which is essential for many vital biological processes, causes significant clinical pathologies in the case of its deficiency or excess. Cardiovascular protective pathways are activated by iron therapy. However, determining the appropriate iron concentration is essential to protect heart tissue from iron-induced oxidative stress. The thioredoxin system is one of the antioxidant systems that protect cells against oxidative stress. Moreover, it allows the binding of many transcription factors for apoptosis, myocardial protection, the stimulation of cell proliferation, and angiogenesis processes, especially the regulation of the cardiovascular system. This study's goal was to understand how iron overload affects the gene and protein levels of the thioredoxin system in the mouse heart.\nBALB/c mice were randomly separated into two groups. The iron overload group was administered with intraperitoneal injections of an iron-dextran solution twice a week for three weeks. In parallel, the control group was intraperitoneally given Dextran 5 solution. The total iron content, the total GSH level, the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio, and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) activity were demonstrated spectroscopically. Changes in the iron metabolism marker genes and thioredoxin system genes were examined by qPCR. The quantitative protein expression of TXNRD1 and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) was examined by western blotting.\nThe iron content of the heart increased in the iron overload group. The expression of hepcidin (Hamp) and ferroportin (Fpn) increased with iron overload. However, decreased expression was observed for ferritin (Fth). No changes were revealed in the GSH level and GSH/GSSG ratio. The gene expression of thioredoxin 1 (Txn1), Txnrd1, and Txnip did not change. TXNRD1 activity and protein expression increased significantly, while the protein expression of TXNIP decreased significantly.\nIn the case of iron overload, the cardiac thioredoxin system is affected by the protein level rather than the gene level. The amount and duration of iron overload used in this study may be considered as a starting point for further studies to determine appropriate conditions for the iron therapy of cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS)", "date": "2020-12-29", "authors": ["SevdaAltun", "HarunBudak"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtemb.2020.126704"}

{"title": "Mechanisms of Premature Ventricular Complexes Caused by QT Prolongation.", "abstract": "QT prolongation, due to lengthening of the action potential duration in the ventricles, is a major risk factor of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. A widely known consequence of QT prolongation is the genesis of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are associated with arrhythmias through the generation of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). However, the vast majority of the EADs observed experimentally in isolated ventricular myocytes are phase-2 EADs, and whether phase-2 EADs are mechanistically linked to PVCs in cardiac tissue remains an unanswered question. In this study, we investigate the genesis of PVCs using computer simulations with eight different ventricular action potential models of various species. Based on our results, we classify PVCs as arising from two distinct mechanisms: repolarization gradient (RG)-induced PVCs and phase-2 EAD-induced PVCs. The RG-induced PVCs are promoted by increasing RG and L-type calcium current and are insensitive to gap junction coupling. EADs are not required for this PVC mechanism. In a paced beat, a single or multiple PVCs can occur depending on the properties of the RG. In contrast, phase-2 EAD-induced PVCs occur only when the RG is small and are suppressed by increasing RG and more sensitive to gap junction coupling. Unlike with RG-induced PVCs, in each paced beat, only a single EAD-induced PVC can occur no matter how many EADs in an action potential. In the wide parameter ranges we explore, RG-induced PVCs can be observed in all models, but the EAD-induced PVCs can only be observed in five of the eight models. The links between these two distinct PVC mechanisms and arrhythmogenesis in animal experiments and clinical settings are discussed.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2020-12-18", "authors": ["ZhaoyangZhang", "Michael BLiu", "XiaodongHuang", "ZhenSong", "ZhilinQu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2020.12.001"}

This allows new discoveries to be made because the location and kinetics of molecular interactions can be directly observed in situ without the inherent averaging of bulk measurements. To date, the majority of single-molecule imaging studies have been performed in either unicellular organisms or cultured, and often chemically fixed, mammalian cell lines. However, primary cell cultures and cell lines derived from multi-cellular organisms might exhibit different properties from cells in their native tissue environment, in particular regarding the structure and organization of the plasma membrane. Here, we describe a simple approach to image, localize, and track single fluorescently tagged membrane proteins in freshly prepared live tissue slices and demonstrate how this method can give information about the movement and localization of a G protein-coupled receptor in cardiac tissue slices.

{"title": "Graphene-based materials enhance cardiomyogenic and angiogenic differentiation capacity of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro - Focus on cardiac tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Cell-based therapies have recently emerged as promising strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising cell type that represent a class of adult stem cells characterized by multipotency, high proliferative capacity, paracrine activity, and low immunogenicity. To improve the functional and therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, novel biomaterials are considered as scaffolds/surfaces that promote MSCs growth and differentiation. One of them are graphene-based materials, including graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Due to the unique physical, chemical, and biological properties of graphene, scaffolds comprising GO/rGO have been examined as novel platforms to improve the differentiation potential of human MSCs in vitro. We verified different i) size of GO flakes, ii) reduction level, and iii) layer thickness to select the most suitable artificial niche for MSCs culture. The results revealed that graphene-based substrates constitute non-toxic substrates for MSCs. Surfaces with large flakes of GO as well as low reduced rGO are the most biocompatible for MSCs propagation and do not affect their proliferation and survival. Interestingly, small GO flakes and highly reduced rGO decreased MSCs proliferation and induced their apoptosis. We also found that GO and rGO substrates did not alter the MSCs phenotype, cell cycle progression and might modulate the adhesive capabilities of these cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that both materials promoted the cardiomyogenic and angiogenic differentiation capacity of MSCs in vitro. Thus, our data indicates that graphene-based surfaces represent promising materials that may influence the therapeutic application of MSCs via supporting their pro-regenerative potential.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

In this regard, a series of thermosensitive and injectable hydrogels with similar physicomechanical properties of cardiac tissue can be an ideal candidate for delivering human unrestricted somatic stem cells (hUSSCs) and improve the quality of cell therapy. Here, we designed N-isopropylacrylamide/acrylic acid/N-acryloxysuccinimide/2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-poly lactide (NIPAAm/AAc/NAS/HEMAPLA) hydrogel via ring-opening polymerization for encapsulation of the cells. To improve biological activities, biomaterials like hyaluronic acid (HA), Aloe vera (AV), and silk fibroin (SF) were added with pure hydrogel (Pgel). The modulus of hydrogels was estimated between 68.1 and 74.63\u202fkPa that was similar to the normal cardiac modulus. Moreover, the elastic region increased by adding biomaterials to Pgel. The results of RT-PCR and ICC demonstrated that the most expression of early genes (GATA4, NKX2.5) was related to Pgel/AV/SF group. In contrast, the highest expression of other genes (GJA1, TNNI3, MYH6) was observed in Pgel/HA/SF.

{"title": "Comparison of chloroquine-like molecules for lysosomal inhibition and measurement of autophagic flux in the brain.", "abstract": "Measurement of autophagic flux in\u00a0vivo is critical to understand how autophagy can be used to combat disease. Neurodegenerative diseases have a special relationship with autophagy, which makes measurement of autophagy in the brain a significant research priority. Currently, measurement of autophagic flux is possible through use of transgenic constructs, or application of a lysosomal inhibitor such as chloroquine. Unfortunately, chloroquine is not useful for measuring autophagic flux in the brain and the use of transgenic animals necessitates cross-breeding of transgenic strains and maintenance of lines, which is costly. To find a drug that could block lysosomal function in the brain for the measurement of autophagic flux, we selected compounds from the literature that appeared to have similar properties to chloroquine and tested their ability to inhibit autophagic flux in cell culture and in mice. These chemicals included chloroquine, quinacrine, mefloquine, promazine and trifluoperazine. As expected, chloroquine blocked lysosomal degradation of the autophagic protein LC3B-II in cell culture. Quinacrine also inhibited autophagic flux in cell culture. Other compounds tested were not effective. When injected into mice, chloroquine caused accumulation of LC3B-II in heart tissue, and quinacrine was effective at blocking LC3B-II degradation in male, but not female skeletal muscle. None of the compounds tested were useful for measuring autophagic flux in the brain. During this study we also noted that the vehicle DMSO powerfully up-regulated LC3B-II abundance in tissues. This study shows that chloroquine and quinacrine can both be used to measure autophagic flux in cells, and in some peripheral tissues.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying its anti-hypertrophic effect has not been clarified. This study revealed that EGCG could inhibit pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by regulating the PSMB5/Nmnat2/SIRT6-dependent signalling pathway.\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to determine the expression of mRNA and protein respectively. A fluorometric assay kit was used to determine the activity of SIRT6, a histone deacetylase. Luciferase reporter gene assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were employed to measure transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity respectively.\nEGCG could significantly increase Nmnat2 protein expression and enzyme activity in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes stimulated with angiotensin II (Ang II) and heart tissues from rats subjected to abdominal aortic constriction. Nmnat2 knockdown by RNA interference attenuated the inhibitory effect of EGCG on cardiac hypertrophy. EGCG blocked NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity induced by Ang II, which was dependent on Nmnat2 and the subsequent SIRT6 activation. Moreover the activation of PSMB5 (20S proteasome subunit \u03b2-5, chymotrypsin-like) was required for EGCG-induced Nmnat2 protein expression. Additionally, we demonstrated that EGCG might interact with PSMB5 and inhibit the activation of the proteasome.\nThese findings serve as the first evidence that the effect of EGCG against cardiac hypertrophy may be, at least partially, attributed to the modulation of the PSMB5/Nmnat2-dependent signalling pathway, suggesting the therapeutic potential of EGCG in the prevention and treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)", "date": "2020-12-15", "authors": ["YiCai", "Shan ShanYu", "YangHe", "Xue YingBi", "SiGao", "Ting DongYan", "Guo DongZheng", "Ting TingChen", "Jian TaoYe", "Pei QingLiu"], "doi": "10.1111/apha.13602"}

{"title": "Circadian Rhythms of Early Afterdepolarizations and Ventricular Arrhythmias in a Cardiomyocyte Model.", "abstract": "Sudden cardiac arrest is a malfunction of the heart's electrical system, typically caused by ventricular arrhythmias, that can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) within minutes. Epidemiological studies have shown that SCD and ventricular arrhythmias are more likely to occur in the morning than in the evening, and laboratory studies indicate that these daily rhythms in adverse cardiovascular events are at least partially under the control of the endogenous circadian timekeeping system. However, the biophysical mechanisms linking molecular circadian clocks to cardiac arrhythmogenesis are not fully understood. Recent experiments have shown that L-type calcium channels exhibit circadian rhythms in both expression and function in guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes. We developed an electrophysiological model of these cells to simulate the effect of circadian variation in L-type calcium conductance. In our simulations, we found that there is a circadian pattern in the occurrence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are abnormal depolarizations during the repolarization phase of a cardiac action potential that can trigger fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Specifically, the model produces EADs in the morning, but not at other times of day. We show that the model exhibits a codimension-2 Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation that serves as an organizing center for different types of EAD dynamics.

We found that there is a circadian pattern in the breakup of spiral waves, which represents ventricular fibrillation in cardiac tissue. Specifically, the model produces spiral wave breakup in the morning, but not in the evening.

This study was designed to investigate a novel function of Yes-associated protein (YAP) circular RNA, circYap, in modulating cardiac fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms. By circular RNA sequencing, we found that three out of fifteen reported circYap isoforms were expressed in nine human heart tissues, with the isoform hsa_circ_0002320 being the highest. The levels of this isoform in the hearts of patients with cardiac hypertrophy were found to be significantly decreased. In the pressure overload mouse model, the levels of circYap were reduced in mouse hearts with transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Upon circYap plasmid injection, the cardiac fibrosis was attenuated, and the heart function was improved along with the elevation of cardiac circYap levels in\u00a0TAC mice. Tropomyosin-4 (TMP4) and gamma-actin (ACTG) were identified to bind with circYap in cardiac cells and mouse heart tissues. Such bindings led to an increased TPM4 interaction with ACTG, resulting in the inhibition of actin polymerization and the following fibrosis. Collectively, our study uncovered a novel molecule that could regulate cardiac remodeling during cardiac fibrosis and implicated a new function of circular RNA.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been pointed to exert crucial roles in development of CHD. The current research is designed to illuminate the impact and potential mechanism of lncRNA SNHG14 in CCHD in vitro. The embryonic rat ventricular myocardial cells (H9c2 cells) were exposed to hypoxia to establish the model of CCHD in vitro. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted to examine relative expressions of SNHG14, miR-25-3p, and KLF4. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured by an LDH assay kit. Apoptosis-related proteins (Bax and Bcl-2) and KLF4 were detected by Western Blot. The targets of SNHG14 and miR-25-3p were verified by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. SNHG14 and KLF4 were upregulated, whereas miR-25-3p was downregulated in hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells and cardiac tissues of patients with CCHD compared with their controls. Knockdown of SNHG14 or overexpression of miR-25-3p facilitated cell viability, while depressing cell apoptosis and release of LDH in hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells. MiR-25-3p was a target of SNHG14 and inversely modulated by SNHG14. MiR-25-3p could directly target KLF4 and negatively regulate expression of KLF4. Repression of miR-25-3p or overexpression of KLF4 reversed the suppression impacts of sh-SNHG14 on cell apoptosis and release of LDH as well as the promotion impact of sh-SNHG14 on cell viability in hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells.

{"title": "Fast-relaxing cardiomyocytes exert a dominant role in the relaxation behavior of heterogeneous myocardium.", "abstract": "Substantial variation in relaxation rate exists among cardiomyocytes within small volumes of myocardium; however, it is unknown how this variability affects the overall relaxation mechanics of heart muscle. In this study, we sought to modulate levels of cellular heterogeneity in a computational model, then validate those predictions using an engineered heart tissue platform. We formulated an in silico tissue model composed of half-sarcomeres with varied relaxation rates, incorporating single-cell cardiomyocyte experimental data. These model tissues randomly sampled relaxation parameters from two offset distributions of fast- and slow-relaxing populations of half-sarcomeres. Isometric muscle twitch simulations predicted a complex relationship between relaxation time and the proportion of fast-versus slow-relaxing cells in heterogeneous tissues. Specifically, a 50/50 mixture of fast and slow cells did not lead to relaxation time that was the mean of the relaxation times associated with the two pure cases. Rather, the mean relaxation time was achieved at a ratio of 70:30 slow:fast relaxing cells, suggesting a disproportionate impact of fast-relaxing cells on overall tissue relaxation. To examine whether this behavior persists in vitro, we constructed engineered heart tissues from two lines of fast- and slow-relaxing human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Cell tracking via fluorescent nanocrystals confirmed the presence of both cell populations in the 50/50 mixed tissues at the time of mechanical characterization. Isometric muscle twitch relaxation times of these mixed-population engineered heart tissues showed agreement with the predictions from the model, namely that the measured relaxation rate of 50/50 mixed tissues more closely resembled that of tissues made with 100% fast-relaxing cells.

{"title": "Cholecystokinin peptide signaling is regulated by a TBX5-MEF2 axis in the heart.", "abstract": "The procholecystokinin (proCCK) gene encodes a secreted peptide known to regulate the digestive, endocrine, and nervous systems. Though recently proposed as a biomarker for heart dysfunction, its physiological role in both the embryonic and adult heart is poorly understood, and there are no reports of tissue-specific regulators of cholecystokinin signaling in the heart or other tissues. In the present study, mRNA of proCCK was observed in cardiac tissues during mouse embryonic development, establishing proCCK as an early marker of differentiated cardiomyocytes which is later restricted to anatomical subdomains of the neonatal heart. Three-dimensional analysis of the expression of proCCK and CCKAR/CCKBR receptors was performed using in situ hybridization and optical projection tomography, illustrating chamber-specific expression patterns in the postnatal heart. Transcription factor motif analyses indicated developmental cardiac transcription factors TBX5 and MEF2C as upstream regulators of proCCK, and this regulatory activity was confirmed in reporter gene assays. proCCK mRNA levels were also measured in the infarcted heart and in response to cyclic mechanical stretch and endothelin-1, indicating dynamic transcriptional regulation which might be leveraged for improved biomarker development. Functional analyses of exogenous cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) administration were performed in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and the results suggest that CCK-8 does not act as a differentiation modulator of cardiomyocyte subtypes. Collectively, these findings indicate that proCCK is regulated at the transcriptional level by TBX5-MEF2 and neurohormonal signaling, informing use of proCCK as a biomarker and future strategies for upstream manipulation of cholecystokinin signaling in the heart and other tissues.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2020-11-30", "authors": ["Robert SLeigh", "Heikki JRuskoaho", "Bogac LKaynak"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2020.170459"}
{"title": "The nutrient sensing pathways FoxO1/3 and mTOR in the heart are coordinately regulated by central leptin through PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4. Implications in cardiac remodeling.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes is often associated with hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance, while other studies support that leptin has cardioprotective effects. Besides, the role of leptin in regulating cardiac atrophy or hypertrophy remains to be clearly defined. In fact, in rats with normal leptin sensitivity, the molecular underpinnings of the effects of central leptin regulating cardiac structural pathways remain poorly understood.\nHence, we assessed the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) leptin infusion on cardiac remodeling analyzing FOXO1/3 and mTORC1 pathways, focusing special attention to PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 as mediator of central leptin's effects on cardiac metabolism.\nMale 3-months-old Wistar rats, infused with icv leptin (0.2\u202f\u03bcg/day) for 7\u202fdays, were daily co-treated intraperitoneally with the specific PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 antagonist GSK0660, at 1\u202fmg/kg per day along leptin treatment.\nCentral leptin regulated dynamically, in an opposite manner, the network between FOXOs and mTORC1 and induced an atrophy-related gene program in cardiac tissue. Leptin activated the anti-hypertrophic kinase GSK3\u03b2 and increased the protein levels of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)/Atrogin-1 involved in limiting cardiac hypertrophy. FOXO1 activity and the expression of their target genes, Sod2 and Lpl, were also increased in the heart upon central leptin infusion. Besides, Beclin-1 and LC3B-II, gene products of the autophagic pathway response, were upregulated, while the content and expression levels of phenotypic markers of cardiac hypertrophy as ANP and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, gene product of Myh7 were significantly decreased. On the other hand, mTORC1 activity and OXPHOS protein levels were decreased suggesting a key role of central leptin preventing cardiac oxidative stress. In fact, the content of carbonylated proteins, TBARS and ROS/RSN were not increased in cardiac tissue in response to central leptin infusion. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, via in vivo administration of the selective antagonist GSK0660, blunted the induction of FOXO1/3, Atrogin-1, MuRF1 and GSK3\u03b2 in the heart mediated by icv leptin infusion.\nOur results demonstrate that, in lean rats with normal leptin sensitivity, central leptin regulates nutrient sensing pathways in heart contributing to balance cardiac remodeling through the anti- and pro-hypertrophic programs, and in this process is involved PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4.", "journal": "Metabolism: clinical and experimental", "date": "2020-11-30", "authors": ["BlancaRubio", "CristinaMora", "CristinaPintado", "LorenaMazuecos", "AlejandroFern\u00e1ndez", "VirginiaL\u00f3pez", "AntonioAndr\u00e9s", "NildaGallardo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154453"}

The effects of MEF on the electrophysiology at high pacing rates are shown to be proarrhythmic in general. However, more studies need to be done to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In this work, we investigate the effects of MEF on cardiac alternans, which is an alternation in the width of the action potential that typically occurs when the heart is paced at high rates, using a biophysically detailed electromechanical model of cardiac tissue. We observe that the transition from spatially concordant alternans to spatially discordant alternans, which is more arrhythmogenic than concordant alternans, may occur in the presence of MEF and when its strength is sufficiently large. We show that this transition is due to the increase of the dispersion of conduction velocity. In addition, our results also show that the MEF effects, depending on the stretch-activated channels' conductances and reversal potentials, can result in blocking action potential propagation.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2020-11-29", "authors": ["AzzamHazim", "YoussefBelhamadia", "StevanDubljevic"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2020.11.018"}

However, vinblastine-caused myocardial damage has been continually reported. The underlying molecular mechanism of the myocardial damage remains unknown. Here, we show that vinblastine induces myocardial damage and necroptosis is involved in the vinblastine-induced myocardial damage both in vitro and in vivo. The results of WST-8 and flow cytometry analysis show that vinblastine causes damage to H9c2 cells, and the results of animal experiments show that vinblastine causes myocardial cell damage. The necrosome components, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), are significantly increased in vinblastine-treated H9c2 cells, primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and rat heart tissues. And the downstream substrate of RIP3, mixed lineage kinase domain like protein (MLKL) was also increased. Pre-treatment with necroptosis inhibitors partially inhibits the necrosome components and MLKL levels and alleviates vinblastine-induced myocardial injury both in vitro and in vivo.

Mouse heart tissue was isolated and digested for total RNA extraction and then subjected to next-generation RNA-sequencing. Expression profiles of circRNAs and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were also constructed. Overall, 48 upregulated and 16 downregulated circRNAs were found to be statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the DOX-injected group. Bioinformatics analysis revealed several potential biological pathways that might be related to apoptosis caused by DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, using qRT-PCR, we found that a circRNA coded by the Arhgap12 gene, termed circArhgap12, was upregulated in the mouse heart tissue upon DOX intervention. CircArhgap12 enhanced apoptotic cell rate, as assessed using terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay, and increased reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde release as well as superoxide dismutase and caspase-3 activation. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that circArhgap12 could sponge miR-135a-5p. In rat primary cardiomyocytes, we found that si-circArhgap12 promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress by sponging the miR-135a-5p inhibitor. Using bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay, we found that miR-135a-5p might have a potential target site for ADCY1 mRNA.\nOur research demonstrated that the expression profile of circRNAs was modified significantly and that circArhgap12 might play a competitive role among endogenous RNAs in mouse cardiomyocytes during DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.\nOur study may provide a preliminary understanding of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity modulated by circRNA and its competing endogenous RNAs network.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2020-11-28", "authors": ["XuejunWang", "ZijieCheng", "JiaXu", "MengwenFeng", "HaoZhang", "LiZhang", "LingmeiQian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118788"}

ZBN (10 mg/kg b.wt.) was orally administered to rats for 21 days and ISO (85 mg/kg b.wt.) was subcutaneously injected into the rats at 24 h intervals for the last 2 consecutive days. We observed increased serum creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin T, and I levels in ISO-treated MI rats. Conversely, ZBN oral administration significantly prevented in cardiac marker enzyme activities in ISO-mediated rats. We also noticed that ZBN oral administration prevented ISO-induced expression of lipid peroxidative markers, total cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, free fatty acids, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to the normal basal level. Furthermore, ZBN restored ISO-mediated antioxidant status, increased level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and tissue phospholipids to the near-normal levels. Besides, ZBN pre-treatment significantly reduced the level of inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, NF-\u03baB, and IL-1\u03b2) in ISO-induced MI in rats.

However, because of the shortage of heart donors, new sources of cardiac regenerative medicine are greatly needed. The prominent development of tissue engineering using bioactive materials has creatively laid a direct promising foundation. Whereas, how to precisely pattern a cardiac structure with complete biological function still requires technological breakthroughs. Recently, the emerging three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology for tissue engineering has shown great advantages in generating micro-scale cardiac tissues, which has established its impressive potential as a novel foundation for cardiovascular regeneration. Whether 3D bioprinted hearts can replace traditional heart transplantation as a novel strategy for treating cardiovascular diseases in the future is a frontier issue.

{"title": "VEGF-B Promotes Endocardium-Derived Coronary Vessel Development and Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "Recent discoveries have indicated that, in the developing heart, sinus venosus and endocardium provide major sources of endothelium for coronary vessel growth that supports the expanding myocardium. Here we set out to study the origin of the coronary vessels that develop in response to vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) in the heart and the effect of VEGF-B on recovery from myocardial infarction.\nWe used mice and rats expressing a VEGF-B transgene, VEGF-B-gene-deleted mice and rats, apelin-CreERT, and natriuretic peptide receptor 3-CreERT recombinase-mediated genetic cell lineage tracing and viral vector-mediated VEGF-B gene transfer in adult mice. Left anterior descending coronary vessel ligation was performed, and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine-mediated proliferating cell cycle labeling; flow cytometry; histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical methods; single-cell RNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis; microcomputed tomography; and fluorescent- and tracer-mediated vascular perfusion imaging analyses were used to study the development and function of the VEGF-B-induced vessels in the heart.\nWe show that cardiomyocyte overexpression of VEGF-B in mice and rats during development promotes the growth of novel vessels that originate directly from the cardiac ventricles and maintain connection with the coronary vessels in subendocardial myocardium. In adult mice, endothelial proliferation induced by VEGF-B gene transfer was located predominantly in the subendocardial coronary vessels. Furthermore, VEGF-B gene transduction before or concomitantly with ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery promoted endocardium-derived vessel development into the myocardium and improved cardiac tissue remodeling and cardiac function.\nThe myocardial VEGF-B transgene promotes the formation of endocardium-derived coronary vessels during development, endothelial proliferation in subendocardial myocardium in adult mice, and structural and functional rescue of cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction.

Diabetes is associated with profound pathophysiological changes in the heart. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of diabetes on gene expression and DNA methylation in cardiac cells.\nTranscriptome analysis of heart tissue from mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes revealed only 39 genes regulated, whereas cell type-specific analysis of the diabetic heart was more sensitive and more specific than heart tissue analysis and revealed a total of 3205 differentially regulated genes in five cell types. Whole genome DNA methylation analysis with basepair resolution of distinct cardiac cell types identified highly specific DNA methylation signatures of genic and regulatory regions. Interestingly, despite marked changes in gene expression, DNA methylation remained stable in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Integrated analysis of cell type-specific gene expression enabled us to assign the particular contribution of single cell types to the pathophysiology of the diabetic heart. Finally, analysis of gene regulation revealed ligand-receptor pairs as potential mediators of heterocellular interaction in the diabetic heart, with fibroblasts and monocytes showing the highest degree of interaction.\nIn summary, cell type-specific analysis reveals differentially regulated gene programs that are associated with distinct biological processes in diabetes.

Our results indicated that HFD/STZ-induced toxic effects on the serum, hepatic and cardiac tissues including a remarkable elevation of the oxidative and inflammatory mediators, and up-regulation of the apoptotic genes (Bax, Caspase-3, Fas, Fas-L) expression. Histologically, the heart tissue revealed various degenerative, vascular and inflammatory alterations characteristic to murine cardiomyopathy. Besides, livers from HFD-STZ-treated rats showed numerous cytotoxic, circulatory and inflammatory alterations. Combined therapy with MET and CTS-Se-NPs resulted in a better remarkable anti-diabetic effect demonstrated by substantial decreases in fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and elevated with up-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene (BCL-2) and down-regulation of apoptotic genes after 8\u00a0weeks of treatment than that revealed in the monotherapeutic strategy. In addition, it ameliorated the damage of cardiac and hepatic tissues and reduced lipid accumulation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and restored the antioxidant capacity. It could be concluded that, the combined strategy applied in the current study have a potential role to limit the diabetic complications and restore insulin resistance to a higher extent than monotherapeutic strategy and could be considered a promising therapeutic alternative in T2DM rat model.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2020-11-13", "authors": ["Amany Abdel-RahmanMohamed", "Safaa IKhater", "AhmedHamed Arisha", "Mohamed M MMetwally", "GomaaMostafa-Hedeab", "Eman SEl-Shetry"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2020.145288"}

These axially patterned embryonic organoids (gastruloids) mimic embryonic development and support the generation of cardiovascular progenitors, including first and second heart fields. The cardiac progenitors self-organize into an anterior domain reminiscent of a cardiac crescent before forming a beating cardiac tissue near a putative primitive gut-like tube, from which it is separated by an endocardial-like layer.

In order to evaluate the multidimensional distribution and abundance of the cardiac spinal and vagal afferents, we assessed the retrograde labeling efficiency of various tracers, and mapped the cardiac afferents qualitatively and quantitatively at the bilateral nodose ganglia (NGs) and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). From the five different retrograde tracers evaluated, Di-8-ANEPPQ yielded reproducibly the highest labeling efficiency of cardiac afferents. We demonstrated specific cardiac afferents at NGs and C4 to T11 DRG segments. Next, the 2D reconstruction of the tissue sections and 3D imaging of the whole NGs and DRGs revealed homogeneous and bilateral distribution of cardiac afferents. The quantitative analyses of the labeled cardiac afferents demonstrated approximately 5-6% of the soma in NGs that were equally distributed bilaterally. The neuronal character of Di-8-ANEPPQ labeled cells were validated by coimmunostaning with pan-neuronal marker Tuj-1. In addition, the cell diameters of labeled cardiac sensory neurons were found smaller than 20\u00a0\u03bcm, implying the nociceptor phenotype confirmed by co-labeling with TRPV1 and Di-8-ANEPPQ. Importantly, co-labeling with two distinct tracers Di-8-ANEPPQ and WGA-647 demonstrated exclusively the same cardiac afferents in DRGs and NGs, validating our findings. Collectively, our findings revealed the cardiac afferents in NGs bilaterally and DRGs with the highest labeling efficiency reported, spatial distribution and quantitation at both 2D and 3D levels, furthering our understanding of this novel neuron population.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2020-11-11", "authors": ["TAkgul Caglar", "Z BDurdu", "M UTurhan", "M YGunal", "M SAyd\u0131n", "GOzturk", "ECagavi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.brainres.2020.147201"}

{"title": "3D bioprinting of mechanically tuned bioinks derived from cardiac decellularized extracellular matrix.", "abstract": "3D bioprinting is a powerful technique for engineering tissues used to study cell behavior and tissue properties in vitro. With the right formulation and printing parameters, bioinks can provide native biological and mechanical cues while allowing for versatile 3D structures that recapitulate tissue-level organization. Bio-based materials that support cellular adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation - including gelatin, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and alginate - have been successfully used as bioinks. In particular, decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) has become a promising material with the unique ability to maintain both biochemical and topographical micro-environments of native tissues. However, dECM has shown technical limitations for 3D printing (3DP) applications posed by its intrinsically low mechanical stability. Herein, we report hydrogel bioinks composed of partially digested, porcine cardiac decellularized extracellular matrix (cdECM), Laponite-XLG nanoclay, and poly(ethylene glycol)-diacrylate (PEG-DA). The Laponite facilitated extrusion-based 3DP, while PEG-DA enabled photo-polymerization after printing. Improving upon previously reported bioinks derived from dECM, our bioinks combine extrudability, shape fidelity, rapid cross-linking, and cytocompatibility in a single formulation (> 97% viability of encapsulated human cardiac fibroblasts and > 94% viability of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes after 7 days). The compressive modulus of the cured hydrogel bioinks was tunable from 13.4-89 kPa by changing the concentration of PEG-DA in the bioink formulation. Importantly, this span of mechanical stiffness encompasses ranges of tissue stiffness from healthy (compressive modulus ~5-15 kPa) to fibrotic (compressive modulus ~30-100 kPa) cardiac tissue states.

{"title": "Bioactivation of clozapine by mitochondria of the murine heart: Possible cause of cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "The mechanism of clozapine-associated cardiotoxicity has not been elucidated. The formation of a reactive nitrenium ion from the drug has been suggested as the cause, however, the reason why the heart is a target remains unknown. The heart is one of the most perfused organs; therefore, it contains a large number of mitochondria per cell; these organelles are responsible for both oxygen metabolism and energy production due to high energy expenditure. Given that mitochondria play critical roles in cellular homeostasis and maintenance, this study tested the hypothesis that cardiac mitochondria are both a target and initiator of clozapine-induced cardiotoxicity through activating the drug. We investigated whether murine heart receives a relatively high amount of systemically administered drug (20 mg/kg, i.p., Wistar albino rats) and whether cardiac mice (Swiss albino) and rat (Wistar albino) mitochondria locally activate clozapine (100 \u03bcM) to a reactive metabolite. We observed a relatively large distribution of clozapine to heart tissue as well as the formation of reactive metabolites by cardiac mitochondria in situ. Mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) in cardiac tissue responsible for biotransformation of clozapine were also characterized. CYP3A4 has been found to be the major enzyme catalyzes CLZ bioactivation, while CYP1A largely and CYP3A4 partially catalyzes the formation of stable metabolites of CLZ. At 100 \u03bcM concentration, clozapine caused a significant decline in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in vitro as much as positive control (antimycin A), while it did not induce mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening.

Macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been reportedly involved in the regulation of cellular responses to MI. Thus, we sought to clarify the mechanism by which macrophage-derived EVs regulate this process. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine microRNA-150 (miR-150) expression in an MI mouse model with ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-exposed cardiomyocytes. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter gene assay were adopted to identify the correlation of miR-150 with tumor protein 53 (TP53) expression in cardiomyocytes. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted in H/R-induced cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocytes incubated with EVs from miR-150 mimic-transfected macrophages, or MI-model mice treated with EVs from miR-150 mimic-transfected macrophages. hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining assays were used for detecting inflammatory infiltration and cell apoptosis. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by dead cardiomyocytes was measured with an LDH kit, and the apoptosis-related proteins, Bax, and cleaved-caspase 3 were determined by Western blot analysis. miR-150 expression was downregulated in the infarcted cardiac tissues of MI mice. Macrophage-derived EVs could transfer miR-150 into cardiomyocytes, where it directly targeted and suppressed TP53. Furthermore, miR-150 suppressed phosphatase and tensin homology (PTEN) and activated p-Akt to upregulate IGF-1 expression. Furthermore, increased expression of EV-derived miR-150 prevented cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro, as evidenced by downregulated Bax and cleaved-caspase 3 and upregulated Bcl2 and alleviated MI in vivo.

During in\u00a0vitro differentiation of mouse and human PSCs toward cardiac lineage, LPAR4 expression peaked after 3-7\u00a0days of differentiation in cardiac progenitors and then declined.

Thus, we determine the effect of hypergravity on a physical force-sensitive cytokine, IL-6 and its related channel activity to investigate rat cardiac function changes in response to accelerated g-force. Serum IL-6 levels and intracellular calcium levels of the right atrium were moderately increased under hypergravity stimulation (4g). IL-6 was involved in the modulation of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (Nkcc) activity. Surprisingly, the right atrium under 4g revealed significantly enhanced Nkcc1 activity. The use of IL-6 on the NKCC1-overexpressed or native NKCC-expressing cells also showed enhanced NKCC1 activity. Hypergravity conditions were also involved in the oxidative stress activated Trpm2 channel and revealed an enhanced expression of the Trpm2 channel under 4g in the rat right atrium. In conclusion, hypergravity revealed that moderate increases in serum IL-6 and enhanced Nkcc1 activity was modulated by IL-6. In addition, enhanced Trpm2 channel expression could be involved in the increased intracellular calcium levels of the right atrium under hypergravitational force.

Stem cell therapy has shown great potential for treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the experimental setting, but success in human trials has been limited. Applications of stem cell therapy for cardiovascular regeneration necessitate understamding of the complex and unique structure of the heart unit, and the embryologic development of the heart muscles and vessels. This chapter aims to provide an insight into cardiac progenitor cells and their potential applications in regenerative medicine. It also provides an overview of the embryological development of cardiac tissue, and the major findings on the development of cardiac stem cells, their characterization, and differentiation, and their regenerative potential. It concludes with clinical applications in treating cardiac disease using different approaches, and concludes with areas for future research.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2020-11-08", "authors": ["ShaimaaShouman", "AmrZaher", "AlaaAbdelhameed", "SaraElshaboury", "SamarSakr", "Bahaa EldinFouda", "HayaMohamed", "NagwaEl-Badri"], "doi": "10.1007/5584_2020_594\n10.1038/cr.2012.11\n10.1155/2018/1247857\n10.1016/j.numecd.2019.09.001\n10.1038/415240a\n10.1016/S0959-437X(02)00325-8\n10.1155/2013/916837\n10.18632/oncotarget.26148\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1161/01.RES.82.2.221\n10.1172/JCI40120\n10.1172/JCI40120\n10.1152/physrev.00008.2016\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227058\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.06.009\n10.1101/cshperspect.a013847\n10.1038/nrg1710\n10.1016/S1534-5807(03)00363-0\n10.1002/sctm.17-0051\n10.1089/scd.2011.0075\n10.1172/JCI94996\n10.1089/scd.2011.0463\n10.1111/jcmm.12230\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.210682\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.10.002\n10.1089/scd.2012.0542\n10.1073/pnas.0602877103\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007195\n10.1006/dbio.1997.8801\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aah5457\n10.1242/dev.01256\n10.1007/s12015-015-9596-6\n10.2217/rme.10.65\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.009\n10.2217/fca-2018-0049\n10.1007/s12015-010-9166-x\n10.1126/science.1123775\n10.1038/cdd.2008.75\n10.1186/s12916-015-0399-z\n10.1006/dbio.1993.1276\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.11.031\n10.1089/scd.2009.0483\n10.1161/01.RES.82.10.1043\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.01.007\n10.1016/j.scr.2008.02.003\n10.1152/ajpheart.01017.2006\n10.1002/ejhf.700\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.055\n10.1038/nm1618\n10.1007/s00441-008-0663-z\n10.1161/01.RES.0000151843.79801.60\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.01.028\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.084343\n10.1016/j.diff.2012.04.005\n10.1126/science.6844926\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.03.033\n10.1002/jcp.22281\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1038/nature03215\n10.1242/dev.001883\n10.1016/j.tig.2007.10.007\n10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.52\n10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.52\n10.1016/j.pcad.2007.03.001\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.04.004\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.03.010\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw113\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60195-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.042598\n10.1038/nm912\n10.1159/000047867\n10.1159/000047867\n10.1007/s12265-018-9842-9\n10.1101/gad.855501\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv136\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr166\n10.1038/ncpcardio0770\n10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03617-5\n10.1101/gad.2018411\n10.1161/01.RES.0000147315.71699.51\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.09.015\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971622\n10.1101/gad.11.8.1061\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.10.029\n10.1159/000492704\n10.1073/pnas.0605768103\n10.1182/blood-2007-02-069716\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.05.016\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223792\n10.1073/pnas.2132126100\n10.1038/35070587\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2003.12.031\n10.1083/jcb.200603014\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.060\n10.1038/s41467-019-11091-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.245589\n10.1161/01.RES.0000173297.53793.fa\n10.1161/01.RES.60.1.27\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60075-0\n10.1186/s12967-019-2110-1\n10.1038/nature11044\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.03.008\n10.1242/dev.127.2.225\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1507\n10.1126/science.1553558\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.194464\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.04.005\n10.1073/pnas.0706406104\n10.1186/s13287-017-0695-y\n10.1016/S1050-1738(01)00069-X\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.01.005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300219\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.010\n10.1038/nrm2428\n10.1253/circj.CJ-15-0243\n10.1101/gad.11.4.451\n10.1186/s13287-019-1174-4\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1038/s41598-018-24954-3\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001929\n10.1038/nature05383\n10.1093/cvr/cvp146\n10.1038/nprot.2008.229\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025265\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.05.079\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.09.015\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.06.076\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehp073\n10.1016/j.scr.2011.01.001\n10.1083/jcb.200504061\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312486\n10.1038/s41598-017-11976-6\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.06.028\n10.1242/dev.116418\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.09.004\n10.1073/pnas.0702859104\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243014\n10.1186/s13287-016-0355-7\n10.1038/nature13309\n10.1038/s41598-018-26969-2\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0386\n10.1042/CS20130019\n10.1101/cshperspect.a007864\n10.1016/S0002-9149(01)01507-7\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.668178\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.10.028\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.02.002\n10.1073/pnas.1313192110\n10.1007/s11010-011-1067-z\n10.1242/dev.02543\n10.1152/physrev.00043.2011\n10.1016/S1044-7431(03)00125-8\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.160\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2378\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.08.044\n10.1038/nature07060"}
{"title": "A sensitive and reliable quantitative immunohistochemistry technique to evaluate the percentage of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected tissue area.", "abstract": "Quantification of parasites in the context of Chagas disease is required to monitor the treatment with benznidazole, disease-associated cardiomyopathies and graft rejection after heart transplantation. As parasitological exams lack sensitivity, Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR) has emerged to evaluate the parasite load in blood samples and cardiac biopsies. However, despite its higher sensitivity, rt-PCR does not provide information on the location and distribution of amastigote nests within infected tissues, the characterization of inflammatory infiltrates or changes to tissue architecture. On the contrary, a sensitive immunohistochemistry technique (IHC) could fill these gaps. In the present study, a quantitative IHC exam was standardized and validated by testing adipose and cardiac tissues of experimentally infected mice containing variable parasite load levels of T. cruzi assessed by a sensitive Sybr Green rt-PCR with kDNA primers. Tissues were divided into four groups according to the parasite load: group A- 100 parasites/50\u00a0ng of DNA; group B -10 parasites; group C - around 1 parasite and group D - less than 1 parasite/50\u00a0ng/DNA. IHC was able to detect T. cruzi in the four groups, even in group D tissues containing fractions of a single parasite/50\u00a0ng of DNA sample according to rt-PCR. In conclusion, a highly sensitivity and reliable quantitative immunohistochemistry technique was developed and is proposed to estimate the percentage of T. cruzi-infected tissue area in chagasic patients presenting with cardiomyopathies, as a complementary test to rt-PCR.", "journal": "Parasitology international", "date": "2020-11-06", "authors": ["J\u00falio C\u00e9sar RenteFerreira-Filho", "Lucia Maria AlmeidaBraz", "Marcos Luiz AlvesAndrino", "LidiaYamamoto", "Edite Hatsumi YamashiroKanashiro", "Ana Maria Gon\u00e7alvesda Silva", "Kelly AparecidaKanunfre", "Thelma SuelyOkay"], "doi": "10.1016/j.parint.2020.102210"}
{"title": "BMP10 Signaling Promotes the Development of Endocardial Cells from Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiovascular Progenitors.", "abstract": "The embryonic endocardium is essential for early heart development as it functions to induce trabecular myocardium, the first heart tissue to form, and is the source of the cells that make up the valves and a portion of the coronary vasculature. With this potential, human endocardial cells could provide unique therapeutic opportunities that include engineering biological valves and cell-based therapy strategies to replace coronary vasculature in damaged hearts. To access human endocardial cells, we generated a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived endothelial population that displays many characteristics of endocardium, including expression of the cohort of genes that identifies this lineage in\u00a0vivo, the capacity to induce a trabecular fate in immature cardiomyocytes in\u00a0vitro, and the ability to undergo an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

{"title": "The Human Explanted Heart Program: A translational bridge for cardiovascular medicine.", "abstract": "The progression of cardiovascular research is often impeded by the lack of reliable disease models that fully recapitulate the pathogenesis in humans. These limitations apply to both in vitro models such as cell-based cultures and in vivo animal models which invariably are limited to simulate the complexity of cardiovascular disease in humans. Implementing human heart tissue in cardiovascular research complements our research strategy using preclinical models. We established the Human Explanted Heart Program (HELP) which integrates clinical, tissue and molecular phenotyping thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation into human heart disease. Our collection and storage of biospecimens allow them to retain key pathogenic findings while providing novel insights into human heart failure. The use of human non-failing control explanted hearts provides a valuable comparison group for the diseased explanted hearts. Using HELP we have been able to create a tissue repository which have been used for genetic, molecular, cellular, and histological studies. This review describes the process of collection and use of explanted human heart specimens encompassing a spectrum of pediatric and adult heart diseases, while highlighting the role of these invaluable specimens in translational research. Furthermore, we highlight the efficient procurement and bio-preservation approaches ensuring analytical quality of heart specimens acquired in the context of heart donation and transplantation.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

By using in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated skimmin's protective effect on impaired heart tissues in DCM. DCM was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60\u2009mg/kg) using Sprague Dawley rats, and diabetic rats were treated with either skimmin (15 or 30\u2009mg/kg) or the vehicle for 16\u2009weeks, and normal rats were used as a control. Hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining were performed to evaluate the cardiac histopathology, and the oxidative stress and proinflammation cytokines in heart tissues were measured. The protein levels of key mediators in fibrosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy in heart tissues were investigated using western blotting. In vitro, primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with skimmin (2 and 10\u2009\u03bcM) under stimulation by high glucose (30\u2009mM) and low glucose (5\u2009mM) respectively, and the molecular mechanisms on pyroptosis and autophagy were studied. Compared to the vehicle-treated DCM\u2009group, skimmin treatment significantly improved the ejection fraction and fractional shortening of the left ventricle and reduced the oxidative stress by increasing the glutathione level and activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase. Skimmin also reduced cardiac fibrosis, and decreased proinflammation cytokines in cardiac tissues. Mechanism studies showed skimmin may enhance the autophagy and ameliorate NLRP3 inflammasome activation to play a protective role in DCM.

Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a biopolyester produced by microbial cells, has characteristics (biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic) that make it appropriate as a biodegradable plastic substance. The different forms of PHA make it suitable to a wide choice of products, from packaging materials to biomedical applications. The major challenge in commercialization of PHA is the cost of manufacturing. There are a lot of factors that could affect the efficiency of a development method. The development of new strategic parameters for better synthesis, including consumption of low cost carbon substrates, genetic modification of PHA-producing strains, and fermentational strategies are discussed. Recently, many efforts have been made to develop a method for the cost-effective production of PHAs. The isolation, analysis as well as characterization of PHAs are significant factors for any developmental process. Due to the biodegradable and biocompatible properties of PHAs, they are majorly used in biomedical applications such as vascular grafting, heart tissue engineering, skin tissue repairing, liver tissue engineering, nerve tissue engineering, bone tissue engineering, cartilage tissue engineering and therapeutic carrier.

Understanding of its myocardial biology remains limited because of a paucity of heart tissue molecular analysis.\nWe performed RNA sequencing on right ventricular septal endomyocardial biopsies prospectively obtained from patients meeting consensus criteria for HFpEF (n=41) contrasted with right ventricular septal tissue from patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, n=30) and donor controls (n=24). Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering tested for transcriptomic distinctiveness between groups, effect of comorbidities, and differential gene expression with pathway enrichment contrasted HF groups and donor controls. Within HFpEF, non-negative matrix factorization and weighted gene coexpression analysis identified molecular subgroups, and the resulting clusters were correlated with hemodynamic and clinical data.\nPatients with HFpEF were more often women (59%), African American (68%), obese (median body mass index 41), and hypertensive (98%), with clinical HF characterized by 65% New York Heart Association Class III or IV, nearly all on a loop diuretic, and 70% with a HF hospitalization in the previous year. Principal component analysis separated HFpEF from HFrEF and donor controls with minimal overlap, and this persisted after adjusting for primary comorbidities: body mass index, sex, age, diabetes, and renal function. Hierarchical clustering confirmed group separation. Nearly half the significantly altered genes in HFpEF versus donor controls (1882 up, 2593 down) changed in the same direction in HFrEF; however, 5745 genes were uniquely altered between HF groups. Compared with controls, uniquely upregulated genes in HFpEF were enriched in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis/electron transport, pathways downregulated in HFrEF. HFpEF-specific downregulated genes engaged endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and angiogenesis. Body mass index differences largely accounted for HFpEF upregulated genes, whereas neither this nor broader comorbidity adjustment altered pathways enriched in downregulated genes. Non-negative matrix factorization identified 3 HFpEF transcriptomic subgroups with distinctive pathways and clinical correlates, including a group closest to HFrEF with higher mortality, and a mostly female group with smaller hearts and proinflammatory signaling.

We then performed molecular and functional assays in patient-derived cardiac fibroblasts based on YAP (yes-associated protein)-transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) mechanosensing activity and collagen contraction assays. The analysis of HF decellularized ECM resulting from ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as from mouse infarcted tissue, identified a common pattern of modifications in their 3-dimensional topography.

They resemble embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and have the ability to differentiate into cell lineage of all three germ-layer, including cardiomyocytes (CMs). The CMs can be generated from iPSCs by inducing embryoid bodies (EBs) formation and treatment with activin A, bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), and inhibitors of Wnt signaling. However, these iPSC-derived CMs are a heterogeneous population of cells and require purification and maturation to mimic the in vivo CMs. The matured CMs can be used for various therapeutic purposes in regenerative medicine by cardiomyoplasty or through the development of tissue-engineered cardiac patches. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the isolation of iPSC and their differentiation, purification, and maturation into clinically usable CMs. Newer small molecules have also been identified to substitute the reprogramming factors for iPSC generation as well as for direct differentiation of somatic cells into CMs without an intermediary pluripotent state.

Endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) enable immunohistochemical and molecular characterization of this disease. However, knowledge about specific molecular patterns and their relation to cardiac function in both ventricles is rare. Therefore, we performed a mass spectrometric analysis of 28 paired EMBs of left (LV) and right ventricles (RV) of patients with DCM or suspected myocarditis allowing quantitative profiling of 743 proteins. We analysed associations between protein abundance of LV and RV as well as the echocardiographic parameters LVEF, TAPSE, LVEDDI, and RVEDDI by linear regression models. Overall, more LV than RV proteins were associated with LV parameters or with RVEDDI. Most LV and RV proteins increasing in level with impairing of LVEF were annotated to structural components of cardiac tissue. Additionally, a high proportion of LV proteins with metabolic functions decreased in level with decreasing LVEF. Results were validated with LV heart sections of a genetic murine heart failure model. The study shows, that remodelling and systolic dysfunction in DCM is mirrored by distinct alterations in protein composition of both ventricles. Loss of LV systolic function is reflected predominantly by alterations in proteins assigned to metabolic functions in the LV whereas structural remodelling was more obvious in the RV. Alterations related to intermediate filaments were seen in both ventricles and highlight such proteins as early indicators of LV loss of function. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study report protein sets in the RV and the LV being associated with ventricular function and remodelling in DCM. Protein abundances in the LV and the RV emphasize and expand current knowledge on pathophysiological changes in heart failure and DCM. While RV and LV EMBs do not differ concerning diagnostic assessment of inflammatory status and virus persistence, additional information reflecting disease severity associated protein alterations can be gained by EMB protein profiling. RV and LV protein data provided complementary information. The protein pattern of the LV reflects metabolic changes and an impaired energy production, which is associated with the degree of LV systolic dysfunction and remodelling and may yield important information about the disease status in DCM. On the other hand, at this disease stage of DCM with still preserved RV function, RV alterations in structural proteins may reflect myocardial compensatory protective mechanisms for maintenance of structure and cellular function.

Systemic administration of GMSC-EVs attenuated aging-associated elevation in the expression levels of p21, mTOR/pS6, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 in skin and heart tissues of aged mice. These findings suggest that GMSC-EVs could be a potential alternative source of cell-free product for attenuation of aging-related skin and vascular dysfunctions due to their potent inhibitory effects on oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence in endothelial cells and skin fibroblasts.", "journal": "Journal of dental research", "date": "2020-10-20", "authors": ["H ZShi", "J CZeng", "S HShi", "HGiannakopoulos", "Q ZZhang", "A DLe"], "doi": "10.1177/0022034520962463"}

{"title": "Angiogenesis after acute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) inflicts massive injury to the coronary microcirculation leading to vascular disintegration and capillary rarefication in the infarct region. Tissue repair after MI involves a robust angiogenic response that commences in the infarct border zone and extends into the necrotic infarct core. Technological advances in several areas have provided novel mechanistic understanding of postinfarction angiogenesis and how it may be targeted to improve heart function after MI. Cell lineage tracing studies indicate that new capillary structures arise by sprouting angiogenesis from pre-existing endothelial cells (ECs) in the infarct border zone with no meaningful contribution from non-EC sources. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows that ECs in infarcted hearts may be grouped into clusters with distinct gene expression signatures, likely reflecting functionally distinct cell populations. EC-specific multicolour lineage tracing reveals that EC subsets clonally expand after MI. Expanding EC clones may arise from tissue-resident ECs with stem cell characteristics that have been identified in multiple organs including the heart. Tissue repair after MI involves interactions among multiple cell types which occur, to a large extent, through secreted proteins and their cognate receptors. While we are only beginning to understand the full complexity of this intercellular communication, macrophage and fibroblast populations have emerged as major drivers of the angiogenic response after MI. Animal data support the view that the endogenous angiogenic response after MI can be boosted to reduce scarring and adverse left ventricular remodelling. The improved mechanistic understanding of infarct angiogenesis therefore creates multiple therapeutic opportunities. During preclinical development, all proangiogenic strategies should be tested in animal models that replicate both cardiovascular risk factor(s) and the pharmacotherapy typically prescribed to patients with acute MI. Considering that the majority of patients nowadays do well after MI, clinical translation will require careful selection of patients in need of proangiogenic therapies.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2020-10-17", "authors": ["XuekunWu", "Marc RReboll", "MortimerKorf-Klingebiel", "Kai CWollert"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvaa287"}

{"title": "Myeloid differentiation factor 2 in the heart: Bench to bedside evidence for potential clinical benefits?", "abstract": "Cardiac inflammation has been involved in many pathological processes in the heart including cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, adverse remodeling, and dysfunction. Myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) is a key mediating protein that has been shown to contribute to the inflammatory process. MD2 is required for the activation of TLR4 in the form of dimerization complex. Upon activation of TLR4, the signal can be sent through either myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (Myd88) or toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) proteins to activate the inflammatory response in cardiac tissue, after which the inflammatory cytokines and genes are produced. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a positive correlation was demonstrated between the serum MD2 levels and mortality rate. Therefore, MD2 inhibition should provide beneficial effects in inflammation related to cardiac diseases such as obesity and heart failure. Multiple inhibitors of TLR4/MD2 interaction reportedly attenuated cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in animals with obesity and heart failure. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the reports from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies regarding the role of MD2 and the effects of MD2 inhibitors on cardiac inflammation, dysfunction, fibrosis, and remodeling.

At concentrations \u22642.5 mM, metformin significantly increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in the hiPSC-CMs by activating adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent signaling and enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis. This effect was abrogated by compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK. At concentrations >5 mM, metformin inhibited the cellular OCR and triggered metabolic reprogramming by enhancing glycolysis and glutaminolysis in the cardiomyocytes. In isolated cardiac mitochondria, metformin did not increase the OCR at any concentrations but inhibited the OCR starting at 1 mM through direct inhibition of electron-transport chain complex I.

Eighteen rats were randomly divided into three groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06 each): the MI group, MI group treated with SBP (SBP), and sham-operated group (SOG). Cardiac function in the experimental groups was assessed by echocardiography analyses after 15 days of treatment.

The differentially expressed proteins were subsequently analyzed with bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the expression levels of two promising proteins were validated by Western blotting.\nThe echocardiography analyses showed that SBP treatment significantly preserved the cardiac function of MI rats. Additionally, quantitative proteomics identified 389 differentially expressed proteins, and 15 proteins were considered as logical candidates for explaining the cardioprotective effect of SBP. Bioinformatic analysis of these differentially expressed proteins revealed that the proteins involved in cellular mitochondrial energy metabolism processes, such as fatty acid beta-oxidation and aerobic respiration, were significantly regulated under SBP treatment, of which fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) and myoglobin (MB) were significantly downregulated in the MI model group compared with the SOG group and returned to the basal level with SBP treatment, confirmed by Western blotting.\nThe results of our study suggest that the cardioprotective effects of SBP are achieved through the preservation of energy metabolism in the heart tissue of MI rats.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2020-10-12", "authors": ["FengYu", "YueYu", "SaisaiTian", "YantingZhou", "XianglingChen", "JiYe", "QianLiu", "XikeXu", "HuZhou", "WeidongZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2020.113460"}

However, when it goes wrong it can have fatal consequences. Electrical activity in the heart is controlled by the carefully orchestrated activity of more than a dozen different ion conductances. While there is considerable variability in cardiac ion channel expression levels between individuals, studies in rodents have indicated that there are modules of ion channels whose expression co-vary. The aim of this study was to investigate whether meta-analytic co-expression analysis of large-scale gene expression datasets could identify modules of co-expressed cardiac ion channel genes in human hearts that are of functional importance.\nMeta-analysis of 3653 public human RNA-seq datasets identified a strong correlation between expression of CACNA1C (L-type calcium current, ICaL) and KCNH2 (rapid delayed rectifier K+ current, IKr), which was also observed in human adult heart tissue samples. In silico modelling suggested that co-expression of CACNA1C and KCNH2 would limit the variability in action potential duration seen with variations in expression of ion channel genes and reduce susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations, a surrogate marker for proarrhythmia. We also found that levels of KCNH2 and CACNA1C expression are correlated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes and the levels of CACNA1C and KCNH2 expression were inversely correlated with the magnitude of changes in repolarization duration following inhibition of IKr.\nMeta-analytic approaches of multiple independent human gene expression datasets can be used to identify gene modules that are important for regulating heart function.

BCAA are widely used as dietary supplements to boost muscle growth and enhance exercise performance. However, the effects of BCAA on myocardial function are largely unknown. This study was designed to investigate whether BCAA affect heart function and, if so, to further explore the underlying molecular basis for the observed effects.\nC57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups, the control group received solvent (water) and the BCAA group received 2% BCAA dissolved in water, for a successive period of 12\u00a0weeks. Compared with control, BCAA treatment significantly increased water consumption without changing body weight or diet consumption; heart tissue BCAA levels were increased, markers representative of myocardial injury in heart tissue including c-reactive protein and cardiac muscle troponin were increased ; and creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase were increased in serum; severe myocardial fibrosis was observed by Masson staining, which was accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased superoxide dismutase activity in heart tissue; both p-AMPK and p-ULK1 were significantly increased as was autophagy, judged by the presence of LC3 by western blotting and immunofluorescence, increased numbers of autophagosomes were found by transmission electron microscopy in the BCAA group. In vitro, 20\u00a0mmol/L BCAA significantly decreased cell viability and increased the production of ROS, as well as the expression of p-AMPK/AMPK and p-ULK1/ULK1 in cultured H9C2 cells. Treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) improved cell viability and reversed ROS changes. Decreased H9C2 cell viability induced with 20\u00a0mmol/L BCAA was reversed by either blocking AMPK or inhibition of ULK1. Furthermore, blocking AMPK significantly decreased p-ULK1/ULK1, while inhibition of ULK1 reversed the enhanced expression of LC3-II/LC3-I induced by BCAA. Excessive ROS production and decreased cell viability induced by BCAA were further confirmed in primary cultured murine cardiomyocytes. Pharmacological activation of \u03b17nAChR with PNU-282987 attenuated BCAA-induced injury in primary murine cardiomyocytes. However, this compound failed to suppress BCAA activation of AMPK and autophagy (LC3-II/I ratio).\nThese results provide the first evidence that treatment of mice with BCAA induced myocardial injury by triggering excessive ROS production and by enhancing AMPK-ULK1 pathway-dependent autophagy. These findings suggested that inhibition of either ROS production or autophagy may alleviate myocardial injury induced by BCAA.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

{"title": "Chronic cardiac structural damage, diastolic and systolic dysfunction following acute myocardial injury due to bromine exposure in rats.", "abstract": "Accidental bromine spills are common and its large industrial stores risk potential terrorist attacks. The mechanisms of bromine toxicity and effective therapeutic strategies are unknown. Our studies demonstrate that inhaled bromine causes deleterious cardiac manifestations. In this manuscript we describe mechanisms of delayed cardiac effects in the survivors of a single bromine exposure. Rats were exposed to bromine (600\u00a0ppm for 45\u00a0min) and the survivors were sacrificed at 14 or 28\u00a0days. Echocardiography, hemodynamic analysis, histology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biochemical analysis of cardiac tissue were performed to assess functional, structural and molecular effects. Increases in right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure and LV end-diastolic wall stress with increased LV fibrosis were observed. TEM images demonstrated myofibrillar loss, cytoskeletal breakdown and mitochondrial damage at both time points. Increases in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reflected myofibrillar damage and increased LV wall stress. LV shortening decreased as a function of increasing LV end-systolic wall stress and was accompanied by increased sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inactivation and a striking dephosphorylation of phospholamban. NADPH oxidase 2 and protein phosphatase 1 were also increased. Increased circulating eosinophils and myocardial 4-hydroxynonenal content suggested increased oxidative stress as a key contributing factor to these effects. Thus, a continuous oxidative stress-induced chronic myocardial damage along with phospholamban dephosphorylation are critical for bromine-induced chronic cardiac dysfunction.

Studies show that loss of regenerative properties in cardiac cells seems to coincide with alterations in metabolism during postnatal development and maturation. Nevertheless, whether changes in cellular metabolism are linked to functional alternations in cardiac cells is not well studied. We report here a novel role for uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in regulation of functional properties in cardiac tissue derived stem-like cells (CTSCs). CTSC were isolated from C57BL/6 mice aged 2\u2009days (nCTSC), 2 month (CTSC), and 2\u2009years old (aCTSC), subjected to bulk-RNA sequencing that identifies unique transcriptome significantly different between CTSC populations from young and old heart. Moreover, results show that UCP2 is highly expressed in CTSCs from the neonatal heart and is linked to maintenance of glycolysis, proliferation, and survival. With age, UCP2 is reduced shifting energy metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation inversely affecting cellular proliferation and survival in aged CTSCs. Loss of UCP2 in neonatal CTSCs reduces extracellular acidification rate and glycolysis together with reduced cellular proliferation and survival. Mechanistically, UCP2 silencing is linked to significant alteration of mitochondrial genes together with cell cycle and survival signaling pathways as identified by RNA-sequencing and STRING bioinformatic analysis.

{"title": "Mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiovascular disease: Current status of translational research/clinical and therapeutic implications.", "abstract": "Mitochondria provide energy to the cell during aerobic respiration by supplying ~95% of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules via oxidative phosphorylation. These organelles have various other functions, all carried out by numerous proteins, with the majority of them being encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Mitochondria occupy ~1/3 of the volume of myocardial cells in adults, and function at levels of high-efficiency to promptly meet the energy requirements of the myocardial contractile units. Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA), which contains 37 genes and is maternally inherited. Over the last several years, a variety of functions of these organelles have been discovered and this has led to a growing interest in their involvement in various diseases, including cardiovascular (CV) diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction relates to the status where mitochondria cannot meet the demands of a cell for ATP and there is an enhanced formation of reactive-oxygen species. This dysfunction may occur as a result of mtDNA and/or nDNA mutations, but also as a response to aging and various disease and environmental stresses, leading to the development of cardiomyopathies and other CV diseases. Designing mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies aiming to maintain or restore mitochondrial function has been a great challenge as a result of variable responses according to the etiology of the disorder. There have been several preclinical data on such therapies, but clinical studies are scarce.

Two-dimensional results are compared with a three-dimensional finite element analysis based on reconstructed embryonic heart geometry. Through these steps, we found that the myocardium of zebrafish results in a stiffness on the order of 10\u00a0kPa immediately after the looping stage of development.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-bound cell secretions important in intercellular signaling, have been shown to play a crucial role in regulating heart function. A mechanistic understanding of the role of EVs in the heart remains elusive due to the challenges in studying the native human heart. Tissue-on-a-chip platforms, comprising functional, physiologically relevant human tissue models, are an emerging technology that has yet to be fully applied to the study of EVs.

We aim to characterize the underlying molecular signalling and effects on cardiac inotropy induced by \u03b2-blockers in animal hearts.\nWild-type mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with carvedilol, metoprolol, or vehicle and echocardiogram analysis was performed. Heart tissues were used for biochemical and histological analyses. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from normal and HFD mice and rats for analysis of adrenergic signalling, calcium handling, contraction, and western blot. Biosensors were used to measure \u03b2-blocker-induced cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signal and protein kinase A activity in myocytes. Acute stimulation of myocytes with carvedilol promotes \u03b21 adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR)- and protein kinase G (PKG)-dependent inotropic cardiac contractility with minimal increases in calcium amplitude. Carvedilol acts as a biased ligand to promote \u03b21AR coupling to a Gi-PI3K-Akt-nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) cascade and induces robust \u03b21AR-cGMP-PKG signal. Deletion of NOS3 selectively blocks carvedilol, but not isoproterenol-induced \u03b21AR-dependent cGMP signal and inotropic contractility. Moreover, therapy with carvedilol restores inotropic contractility and sensitizes cardiac adrenergic reserves in diabetic mice with minimal impact in calcium signal, as well as reduced cell apoptosis and hypertrophy in diabetic hearts.\nThese observations present a novel \u03b21AR-NOS3 signalling pathway to promote cardiac inotropy in the heart, indicating that this signalling paradigm may be targeted in therapy of heart diseases with reduced ejection fraction.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2020-09-22", "authors": ["QingtongWang", "YingWang", "Toni MWest", "YongmingLiu", "Gopireddy RReddy", "FedericaBarbagallo", "BingXu", "QianShi", "BingqingDeng", "WeiWei", "Yang KXiang"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvaa266"}

This study investigated the regulatory mechanism and role of SOX11 in congenital heart abnormality in a hyperglycemic environment. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed decreased SOX11 protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the heart tissue of diabetic offspring compared with the control group. A Sequenom EpiTYPER MassArray showed that methylation sites upstream in SOX11 region 1 were increased in the diabetic group compared with the control group. Luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR showed that Dnmt3b overexpression decreased SOX11 promoter activity and its mRNA level, whereas Dnmt3a had little effect on regulating SOX11 expression. Furthermore, we found that Dnmt3L cooperated with Dnmt3b to regulate SOX11 gene expression. Additionally, the function of SOX11 silencing was analyzed by using small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and apoptotic assays showed that SOX11 downregulation inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.

Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) non-diabetic rats were used as controls. LETO rats were divided into 3 groups: a high fat diet (HFD) group with a 22% increase in caloric intake, a CR group, and a group fed AL. At 40\u00a0weeks of age, the telomere length was significantly shorter in the heart tissue of HFD rats but was not altered by CR in experimental rats with or without CR, however, telomerase activity in both strains of CR rats was significantly elevated. Protein expression of IGF-1, Sirt 1 and phospho-FoxO1 was increased in both CR groups. Echocardiography showed that CR preserved LV diastolic function with a significantly shorter E-wave deceleration time and a greater E/A ratio compared with the AL groups. These findings suggest that CR protocol increased telomerase activity without changing of telomere length, enhanced autophagy and improved LV diastolic function in animal model of diabetes rats.

{"title": "Cardiac Immunology: A New Era for Immune Cells in the Heart.", "abstract": "The immune system is essential for the development and homeostasis of the human body. Our current understanding of the immune system on disease pathogenesis has drastically expanded over the last decade with the definition of additional non-canonical roles in various tissues. Recently, tissue-resident immune cells have become an important research topic for understanding their roles in the prevention, pathogenesis, and recovery from the diseases. Heart resident immune cells, particularly macrophage subtypes, and their characteristic morphology, distribution in the cardiac tissue, and transcriptional profile have been recently reported in the experimental animal models, unrevealing novel and unexpected roles in electrophysiological regulation of the heart both at the steady-state and diseased state. Immunological processes have been widely studied in both sterile cardiac disorders, such as myocardial infarction, autoimmune cardiac diseases, or infectious cardiac diseases, such as myocarditis, endocarditis, and acute rheumatic carditis. Following cardiac injury, innate and adaptive immunity have critical roles in pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Heart resident immune cells not only provide defense against infectious diseases but also contribute to the homeostasis. In recent years, physiological changes and pathological processes were demonstrated to alter the abundance, distribution, polarization, and diversity of immune cells in the heart. Accumulating evidence indicates that cardiac remodeling is controlled by the complex crosstalk between cardiomyocytes and cardiac immune cells through the gap junctions, providing the ion flow to achieve synchronization and modulation of contractility. This review article aims to review the well-documented roles of both resident and recruited immune cell in the heart, as well as their recently uncovered unconventional roles in both cardiac homeostasis and cardiovascular diseases. We have mostly focused on studies on animal models used in preclinical research, underlying the need for further investigations in humans or in vitro human models. It may be foreseen that the further comprehensive investigations of cardiac immunology might harbor new therapeutic options for cardiac disorders that have tremendous medical potential.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2020-09-11", "authors": ["ArzuhanKoc", "EsraCagavi"], "doi": "10.1007/5584_2020_576\n10.1038/s41591-018-0059-x\n10.1016/j.imbio.2011.06.009\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.117.310097\n10.1155/2014/159150\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.12.023\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031046\n10.1007/s00109-017-1575-8\n10.1128/mBio.00264-13\n10.1016/j.molmed.2019.01.002\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.225508\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308030\n10.1038/s41590-018-0272-2\n10.1038/nature08938\n10.1038/nri3800\n10.1080/0891693042000196200\n10.1182/blood-2009-12-257832\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02031\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.07.039\n10.1590/s0066-782x2001000100005\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2578\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00334\n10.1503/cmaj.130375\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00134\n10.1007/s10875-009-9332-6\n10.1016/B978-0-444-63269-2.00029-5\n10.1080/08916930500484674\n10.4172/2161-1149.S4-001\n10.4103/HEARTVIEWS.HEARTVIEWS_106_17\n10.1253/circj.CJ-15-0138\n10.1007/s00395-019-0740-3\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.02.005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.015\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.07.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.986372\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1568-2_8\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005289\n10.1016/j.cyto.2018.08.007\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.101485\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.08.2149\n10.3389/fcvm.2015.00026\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.61\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.308270\n10.3390/ijms19010231\n10.1093/cvr/cvq272\n10.1172/jci.insight.87315\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.08.015\n10.2741/3084\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.10.001\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000539\n10.1155/2019/8563845\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041694\n10.1152/ajpheart.00449.2015\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.543066\n10.1038/nri3520\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.11.014\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.008\n10.1084/jem.20160081\n10.3390/jcm8081109\n10.1038/nm.3925\n10.1161/01.cir.0000052939.59093.45\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00025\n10.4330/wjc.v10.i9.87\n10.1073/pnas.1621047114\n10.1038/mi.2014.131\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu203\n10.1056/NEJMoa1707914\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32814-3\n10.1038/nm.2124\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61931-4\n10.1007/s00395-014-0449-2\n10.1093/cvr/cvu138\n10.1172/JCI85782\n10.1016/j.ehj.2014.11.005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0172691\n10.1007/s00395-016-0584-z\n10.1038/s41577-018-0065-8\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01932\n10.1155/2016/2795090\n10.1093/cvr/cvv008\n10.1007/s11897-017-0337-9\n10.1126/science.aaa8064\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.00300\n10.1086/382893\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304691\n10.1007/s11596-010-0558-6\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.05.016\n10.1038/srep30146\n10.1007/s00395-019-0752-z"}
{"title": "Human model of IRX5 mutations reveals key role for this transcription factor in ventricular conduction.", "abstract": "Several inherited arrhythmic diseases have been linked to single gene mutations in cardiac ion channels and interacting proteins. However, the mechanisms underlying most arrhythmias, are thought to involve altered regulation of the expression of multiple effectors. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of a transcription factor (TF) belonging to the Iroquois homeobox family, IRX5, in cardiac electrical function.\nUsing human cardiac tissues, transcriptomic correlative analyses between IRX5 and genes involved in cardiac electrical activity showed that in human ventricular compartment, IRX5 expression strongly correlated to the expression of major actors of cardiac conduction, including the sodium channel, Nav1.5, and Connexin 40 (Cx40). We then generated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from two Hamamy syndrome-affected patients carrying distinct homozygous loss-of-function mutations in IRX5 gene. Cardiomyocytes derived from these hiPSCs showed impaired cardiac gene expression programme, including misregulation in the control of Nav1.5 and Cx40 expression. In accordance with the prolonged QRS interval observed in Hamamy syndrome patients, a slower ventricular action potential depolarization due to sodium current reduction was observed on electrophysiological analyses performed on patient-derived cardiomyocytes, confirming the functional role of IRX5 in electrical conduction. Finally, a cardiac TF complex was newly identified, composed by IRX5 and GATA4, in which IRX5 potentiated GATA4-induction of SCN5A expression.\nAltogether, this work unveils a key role for IRX5 in the regulation of human ventricular depolarization and cardiac electrical conduction, providing therefore new insights into our understanding of cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2020-09-09", "authors": ["Zeina RAl Sayed", "RobinCanac", "BastienCimarosti", "CarineBonnard", "Jean-BaptisteGourraud", "HananHamamy", "HulyaKayserili", "AuroreGirardeau", "MariamJouni", "NicolasJacob", "AnneGaignerie", "CarolineChariau", "LaurentDavid", "VirginieForest", "C\u00e9lineMarionneau", "FlavienCharpentier", "GildasLoussouarn", "GuillaumeLamirault", "BrunoReversade", "KazemZibara", "PatriciaLemarchand", "NathalieGaborit"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvaa259"}
{"title": "Beyond genomics-technological advances improving the molecular characterization and precision treatment of heart failure.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. In the past 20\u00a0years, there has been an overwhelming focus on developing therapeutics that target common downstream disease pathways thought to be involved in all forms of heart failure independent of the initial etiology. While this strategy is effective at the population level, individual responses vary tremendously and only approximately one third of patients receive benefit from modern heart failure treatments. In this perspective, we propose that DCM should be considered as a collection of diseases with a common phenotype of left ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction rather than a single disease entity, and that mechanism-based classification of disease subtypes will revolutionize our understanding and clinical approach towards DCM. We discuss how these efforts are central to realizing the potential of precision medicine and how they are empowered by the development of new tools that allow investigators to strategically employ genomic and transcriptomic information. Finally, we outline an investigational strategy to (1) define DCM at the patient level, (2) develop new tools to model and mechanistically dissect subtypes of human heart failure, and (3) harness these insights for the development of precision therapeutics.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2020-09-05", "authors": ["Kory JLavine", "Michael JGreenberg"], "doi": "10.1007/s10741-020-10021-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001878\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001879\n10.7326/0003-4819-152-6-201006010-01006\n10.7326/0003-4819-152-11-201006010-01006\n10.1001/jama.296.15.1867\n10.1001/jama.298.10.1171\n10.1056/NEJM199605233342101\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.059\n10.1172/jci.insight.94382\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.11.059\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.878\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309396\n10.1172/JCI62862\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.033200\n10.1093/cvr/cvy083\n10.1186/s13073-017-0410-8\n10.3390/genes5010214\n10.1038/s41467-019-13690-5\n10.1146/annurev-med-041717-085853\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.06.022\n10.1073/pnas.1910962116\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.001938\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.10.011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00571.2005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.106.146670\n10.1016/j.hfc.2017.12.002\n10.1529/biophysj.107.107557\n10.1007/s11897-017-0351-y\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003863\n10.1126/science.aav8130\n10.1126/science.aat5031\n10.1038/s41467-018-07582-3\n10.1126/science.aax6648\n10.1126/science.aaf2403\n10.1038/s41598-019-53899-4\n10.1073/pnas.90.9.3993\n10.1074/jbc.M113.450668\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.07.018\n10.1074/jbc.M800554200\n10.1007/s12471-016-0815-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.039\n10.1007/s00018-012-0927-3\n10.1126/sciadv.1500511\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1172/JCI12131\n10.1126/science.1225829\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001\n10.1152/physrev.00036.2015\n10.1038/nm.3225\n10.3389/fphys.2017.01111\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307580\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1096/fasebj.14.5.669\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.016\n10.1089/ten.a.2007.0092\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.12.052\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.11.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310363\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003552\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314505\n10.1038/s41467-019-12354-8\n10.1161/HCG.0000000000000043\n10.1038/s41586-019-1406-x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0213768\n10.1038/ncomms7955\n10.1038/srep22788\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.055\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032273\n10.1096/fasebj.11.8.9240969\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00120\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1073/pnas.0900174106\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0341\n10.1038/srep24726\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2019.0118\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0347\n10.1177/1087057110388269\n10.1038/s41598-019-54665-2\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.12.007\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01568\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf2584\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001883\n10.1038/s41467-018-06193-2\n10.1126/science.1200113\n10.1126/science.aad3456\n10.1038/nature23305\n10.15252/emmm.201505047\n10.1073/pnas.022628899"}
{"title": "MiR-221-3p targets Hif-1\u03b1 to inhibit angiogenesis in heart failure.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is involved in ischemic heart disease as well as the prognosis of heart failure (HF), and endothelial cells are the main participants in angiogenesis. In this study, we found that miR-221-3p is highly expressed in vascular tissue, especially in endothelial cells, and increased miR-221-3p was observed in heart tissue of HF patients and transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced HF mice. To explore the role of miR-221-3p in endothelial cells, microRNA (miRNA) mimics and inhibitors were employed in vitro. Overexpression of miR-221-3p inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and cord formation in vitro, while inhibition of miR-221-3p showed the opposite effect. Anti-argonaute 2 (Ago2) coimmunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and western blotting were performed to verify the target of miR-221-3p. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) was identified as a miR-221-3p target, and the adverse effects of miR-221-3p on endothelial cells were alleviated by HIF-1\u03b1 re-expression. In vivo, a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia (HLI) was developed to demonstrate the effect of miR-221-3p on angiogenesis. AntagomiR-221-3p increased HIF-1\u03b1 expression and promoted angiogenesis in mouse ischemic hindlimbs. Using the TAC model, we clarified that antagomiR-221-3p improved cardiac function in HF mice by promoting cardiac angiogenesis. Furthermore, serum miR-221-3p was detected to be negatively correlated with heart function in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Our results conclude that miR-221-3p inhibits angiogenesis of endothelial cells by targeting HIF-1\u03b1 and that inhibition of miR-221-3p improves cardiac function of TAC-induced HF mice. Furthermore, miR-221-3p might be a potential prognostic marker of HF.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2020-09-03", "authors": ["YuyingLi", "ChenghuiYan", "JiahuiFan", "ZhiweiHou", "YalingHan"], "doi": "10.1038/s41374-020-0450-3"}

{"title": "Epigenetic Assays in Purified Cardiomyocyte Nuclei.", "abstract": "The adult mammalian heart's potential for regeneration is very inefficient. Importantly, adult mammalian cardiomyocytes (CMs) are characterized as a cell population with very limited mitotic potential. Conversely, the neonatal mouse heart possesses a brief, yet robust, regenerative capacity within the first week of life. Cell type-specific enrichment procedures are essential for characterizing the full spectrum of epigenomic landscapes and gene regulatory networks deployed by mammalian CMs. In this chapter, we describe a protocol useful for purifying CM nuclei from mammalian cardiac tissue. Furthermore, we detail a low-input procedure suitable for the parallel genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and transcription factor-binding sites.

{"title": "Tissue- and isoform-specific protein complex analysis with natively processed bait proteins.", "abstract": "Protein-protein interaction analysis is an important tool to elucidate the function of proteins and protein complexes as well as their dynamic behavior. To date, the analysis of tissue- or even cell- or compartment-specific protein interactions is still relying on the availability of specific antibodies suited for immunoprecipitation. Here, we aimed at establishing a method that allows identification of protein interactions and complexes from intact tissues independent of specific, high affinity antibodies used for protein pull-down and isolation. Tagged bait proteins were expressed in human HEK293T cells and residual interactors removed by SDS. The resulting tag-fusion protein was then used as bait to pull proteins from tissue samples. Tissue-specific interactions were reproducibly identified from porcine retina as well as from retinal pigment epithelium using the ciliary protein lebercilin as bait. Further, murine heart-specific interactors of two gene products of the 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase type 1 (cGK1) were investigated. Here, specific interactions were associated with the cGK1\u03b1 and \u03b2 gene products, that differ only in their unique amino-terminal region comprising about 100 aa. As such, the new protocol provides a fast and reliable method for tissue-specific protein complex analysis which is independent of the availability or suitability of antibodies for immunoprecipitation. SIGNIFICANCE: Protein-protein interaction in the functional relevant tissue is still difficult due to the dependence on specific antibodies or bait production in bacteria or insect cells. Here, the tagged protein of interest is produced in a human cell line and bound proteins are gently removed using SDS. Because applying the suitable SDS concentration is a critical step, different SDS solutions were tested to demonstrate their influence on interactions and the clean-up process. The established protocol enabled a tissue-specific analysis of the ciliary proteins lebercilin and TMEM107 using pig eyes. In addition, two gene products of the 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase type 1 showed distinct protein interactions in mouse heart tissue.

{"title": "Mathematical modelling of the mechano-electric coupling in the human cardiomyocyte electrically connected with fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibroblasts are interspersed within mammalian cardiac tissue. Fibroblasts are mechanically passive; however, they may communicate electrically with cardiomyocytes via gap junctions and thus affect the electrical and mechanical activity of myocytes. Several in-silico studies at both cellular (0D) and ventricular (3D) levels analysed the effects of fibroblasts on the myocardial electrical function. However, none of them addressed possible effects of fibroblast-myocyte electrical coupling to cardiomyocyte mechanical activity. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for studying both electrical and mechanical responses of the human cardiomyocyte to its electrotonic interaction with cardiac fibroblasts. Our simulations have revealed that electrotonic interaction with fibroblasts affects not only the mechanical activity of the cardiomyocyte, comprising either moderate or significant reduction of contractility, but also the mechano-calcium and mechano-electric feedback loops, and all these effects are enhanced as the number of coupled fibroblasts is increased. Obtained results suggest that moderate values of the myocyte-fibroblast gap junction conductance (less than 1\u00a0nS) can be attributed to physiological conditions, contrasting to the higher values (2\u00a0nS and higher) proper rather for pathological situations (e.g. for infarct and/or border zones), since all mechanical indexes falls down dramatically in the case of such high conductance.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2020-08-28", "authors": ["AnastasiaBazhutina", "Nathalie ABalakina-Vikulova", "AlexanderKursanov", "OlgaSolovyova", "AlexanderPanfilov", "Leonid BKatsnelson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.08.003"}

Thereafter, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography, and heart tissue and plasma were collected for further measurements.

We hypothesized that this could be related to low expression of the membrane receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in the fetoplacental unit. We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 at various gestational ages in both placentae and fetal organs from pregnancies not infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nIn May 2020, using samples from a registered biobank, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for ACE2 in tissue samples from fetal organs and placentae from five cases of second- or third-trimester medical termination of pregnancy in healthy women (performed between 15 and 38\u2009weeks' gestation), as well as a further two placentae, one from a 7-week spontaneous miscarriage in a non-infected woman and one from a symptomatic pregnant woman positive for SARS-CoV-2 delivered by Cesarean section at 34\u2009weeks. Samples were paraffin-embedded and organ tissues included kidney, brain, lung, intestinal tract, heart and testis. Matching tissues (kidney, intestinal tract, lung and testis) from autopsies of four 8-year-old children were tested as controls. Tissue sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2, and protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunohistochemistry.\nACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidney, rectum and ileum samples from 15\u2009weeks onwards and in the pediatric controls. It was barely detectable in fetal lung samples at 15\u2009+\u20095\u2009weeks' gestation and not detectable thereafter, and, in the pediatric controls, ACE2 was detectable only in type-2 pneumocytes. No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal or parenchymal tissues or in cardiac tissues. ACE2 was expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast samples, but not in the amnion, from 7\u2009weeks onwards. The intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining in the placenta from the symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 woman was similar to that in the non-infected placentae.\nMarked placental expression of ACE2 provides a rationale for vertical transmission at the cellular level. Absence of ACE2 expression in the fetal brain and heart is reassuring regarding the risk of congenital malformation.

Macrophages and cardiomyocytes are two cell types in which the MR plays a central role in the cardiac tissue response to injury, renovascular hypertension and oxidative stress for example. Macrophages are critical for resolution of tissue injury and wound healing and their pleiotropic actions are central to the development of many forms of heart, renal and vascular disease.

Genome-wide expression analysis on heart tissue has been instrumental for the identification of molecular mechanisms at play. However, these data were based on signals derived from all cardiac cell types. Here, we aimed for a more detailed view on molecular changes driving maladaptive CM hypertrophy to aid in the development of therapies to reverse pathological remodelling.\nUtilizing CM-specific reporter mice exposed to pressure overload by transverse aortic banding and CM isolation by flow cytometry, we obtained gene expression profiles of hypertrophic CMs in the more immediate phase after stress, and CMs showing pathological hypertrophy. We identified subsets of genes differentially regulated and specific for either stage. Among the genes specifically up-regulated in the CMs during the maladaptive phase we found known stress markers, such as Nppb and Myh7, but additionally identified a set of genes with unknown roles in pathological hypertrophy, including the platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFKP). Norepinephrine-angiotensin II treatment of cultured human CMs induced the secretion of N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and recapitulated the up-regulation of these genes, indicating conservation of the up-regulation in failing CMs. Moreover, several genes induced during pathological hypertrophy were also found to be increased in human HF, with their expression positively correlating to the known stress markers NPPB and MYH7. Mechanistically, suppression of Pfkp in primary CMs attenuated stress-induced gene expression and hypertrophy, indicating that Pfkp is an important novel player in pathological remodelling of CMs.\nUsing CM-specific transcriptomic analysis, we identified novel genes induced during pathological hypertrophy that are relevant for human HF, and we show that PFKP is a conserved failure-induced gene that can modulate the CM stress response.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["MartaVigil-Garcia", "Charlotte JDemkes", "Joep E CEding", "DanielleVersteeg", "Hestherde Ruiter", "IlariaPerini", "LienekeKooijman", "Monika MGladka", "Folkert WAsselbergs", "AryanVink", "MagdalenaHarakalova", "AlexanderBossu", "Toon A Bvan Veen", "Cornelis JBoogerd", "Evavan Rooij"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvaa233"}

Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that macrophage efferocytosis plays an essential role in cardiac pathophysiology and repair. Therefore, understanding macrophage efferocytosis would provide valuable insights on cardiac health, and may offer new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with heart failure.

The presence of methanogens in vascular and cardiac tissues was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, fluorescent in situ hybridization and PCR-based investigations.\nPCR detection attempted in 7,716 blood samples, was negative in all 1,312 aerobic bottles and 810 bacterial culture-negative anaerobic bottles. PCRs were positive in 27/5,594 (0.5%) bacterial culture-positive anaerobic bottles collected from 26 patients. Sequencing confirmed Methanobrevibacter smithii associated with staphylococci in 14 patients, Enterobacteriaceae in nine patients and streptococci in three patients. Metagenomics confirmed M. smithii in five samples, and M. smithii was isolated in broth from two samples; the genomes of these two isolates were sequenced. Blood cultures experimentally inoculated with Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus hominis yielded hydrogen, but no methane, authentifying observational data. Three patients diagnosed with infectious mitral endocarditis, were indisputably diagnosed by microscopy, PCR-based detections and culture: we showed M. smithii microscopically and by a specific PCR followed by sequencing method in two of three cardiovascular tissues.\nUsing appropriate laboratory methods, M. smithii is demonstrated as causing archaemia and endocarditis in febrile patients who are coinfected by bacteria.", "journal": "Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America", "date": "2020-07-16", "authors": ["MichelDrancourt", "KenzaDjemai", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9riqueGouriet", "GhilesGrine", "AhmedLoukil", "MarielleBedotto", "AnthonyLevasseur", "HubertLepidi", "JacquesBou-Khalil", "SaberKhelaifia", "DidierRaoult"], "doi": "10.1093/cid/ciaa998"}

In this study, 56 Wistar albino male rats (estimated body weights 250-400\u00a0g) were divided into eight groups (n\u00a0=\u00a07). Group 1 (Control) received no drug. Group 2 (ISO) was given 180\u00a0mg/kg of isoproterenol subcutaneously (s.c.); two doses were administered at 24-h intervals on days 29 and 30 of the experiment. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were given valsartan (30\u00a0mg/kg orally), C21 (0.03\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneally), and a combination of Valsartan\u00a0+\u00a0C21, respectively, for 30\u00a0days. Groups 6, 7, and 8 were administered Valsartan, C21, and Valsartan\u00a0+\u00a0C21 in the same application, duration, and dose, respectively, and isoproterenol (180\u00a0mg/kg s.c.) was given on days 29 and 30 of the experiment. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the rats at the beginning and end of the experiment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG alterations were monitored via a carotid artery cannula at the end of the experiment. Histopathological and biochemical measurements were performed on the cardiac tissue of the rats. For histopathological findings, C21 and Valsartan\u00a0+\u00a0C21 combination therapy significantly reduced the development of heart failure compared to valsartan alone. Also, the protective effect of C21 on myocardial injury was superior to that of valsartan. According to the results of echocardiographic and biochemical evaluations, C21, and Valsartan showed protective effects against heart failure. C21, valsartan, and combined therapy significantly prevented the decrease of ejection fraction.

This study aims to evaluate the contribution of ferroptosis to ischemia or reperfusion injury, and lay a basis for precise therapy of myocardial infarction. The Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat hearts were subjected to ischemia for different duration or the hearts were treated with 1\u00a0h-ischemia plus different duration of reperfusion. The myocardial injury was assessed by biochemical assays and hematoxylin & eosin (HE) staining. The ferroptosis was evaluated with the levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), iron, and malondialdehyde. Iron chelator (deferoxamine) was applied to verify the contribution of ferroptosis to ischemia and reperfusion injury. The results showed that ischemic injury (infarction and CK release) was getting worse with the extension of ischemia, but no significant changes in ferroptosis indexes (ACSL4, GPX4, iron, and malondialdehyde) in cardiac tissues were observed. Differently, the levels of ACSL4, iron, and malondialdehyde were gradually elevated with the extension of reperfusion concomitant with a decrease of GPX4 level. In the ischemia-treated rat hearts, no significant changes in myocardial injury were observed in the presence of deferoxamine, while in the ischemia/reperfusion-treated rat hearts, myocardial injury was markedly attenuated in the presence of deferoxamine concomitant with a reduction of ferroptosis. Based on these observations, we conclude that ferroptosis occurs mainly in the phase of myocardial reperfusion but not ischemia.

Cardiac tissues were collected after pregnancy termination for the determination of cardiac iron accumulation, mitochondrial function, including mitochondrial ROS production, mitochondrial depolarization and mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial dynamics, inflammation, and apoptosis.\nPrenatal cardiac function evaluated by ultrasound was comparable between the Hb Bart's and non-anemic groups. In Bart's group, the levels of cardiac mitochondrial depolarization and swelling, and the TNF-\u03b1 level were significantly higher, compared to the non-anemic group. On the contrary, anti-inflammatory (IL-10) levels were significantly lower in the Hb Bart's group. Additionally, active caspase-3 and Bcl-2 expression were also significantly higher (P= 0.001, P=0.035) in Bart's group. The mitochondrial fission protein expression, including p-DRP1/total DRP1, was significantly higher in Bart's group. However, there was no difference in cardiac iron accumulation levels between these two groups.\nDespite equivalent prenatal cardiac function and comparable cardiac iron accumulation in the Bart's and non-anemic groups, fetal anemia is significantly associated with cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction, increased mitochondrial fission, and increased inflammation and apoptosis.

{"title": "Update on acute myocarditis.", "abstract": "Acute myocarditis (AM), a recent-onset inflammation of the heart, has heterogeneous clinical presentations, varying from minor symptoms to high-risk cardiac conditions with severe heart failure, refractory arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock. AM is moving from being a definitive diagnosis based on histological evidence of inflammatory infiltrates on cardiac tissue to a working diagnosis supported by high sensitivity troponin increase in association with specific cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) findings. Though experts still diverge between those advocating for histological definition versus those supporting a mainly clinical definition of myocarditis, in the real-world practice the diagnosis of AM has undoubtedly shifted from being mainly biopsy-based to solely CMRI-based in most of clinical scenarios. It is thus important to clearly define selected settings where EMB is a must, as information derived from histology is essential for an optimal management. As in other medical conditions, a risk-based approach should be promoted in order to identify the most severe AM cases requiring appropriate bundles of care, including early recognition, transfer to tertiary centers, aggressive circulatory supports with inotropes and mechanical devices, histologic confirmation and eventual immunosuppressive therapy. Despite improvements in recognition and treatment of AM, including a broader use of promising mechanical circulatory supports, severe forms of AM are still burdened by dismal outcomes. This review is focused on recent clinical studies and registries that shed new insights on AM.

This study investigated whether hesperidin could improve signs of the metabolic syndrome and cardiac function in a high-fat diet (HFD) induced metabolic syndrome (MS) in rats.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were fed HFD and 15% fructose for 16\u00a0weeks and treated with hesperidin (15 or 30\u00a0mg/kg, based on signs of MS from a preliminary study) or metformin, a positive control agent, (100\u00a0mg/kg) for the final four weeks. Cardiac function, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance, serum insulin, and lipid profiles were measured. Histomorphometrics of left ventricles, epidydimal fat pads and liver were evaluated. Expressions of phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate1(p-IRS1), p-Akt and GLUT4 in cardiac tissue were determined.\nHesperidin and metformin attenuated MS in HFD rats (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The accumulation of visceral fat pads and fatty liver associated with increases in liver lipid contents and liver enzymes were found in MS rats that were alleviated in hesperidin or metformin-treated groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

{"title": "Evidence linking the role of periodontal viruses in coronary artery disease with and without periodontitis.", "abstract": "Viruses are considered to be a newer family associated with inflammatory diseases. Yet the role of periodontal viruses in coronary artery diseases (CAD) remains unclear. Thus, the current study aims to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal viruses and compare the same in cardiac samples of CAD patients with and without periodontitis.\nA total of 60 patients with CAD indicated for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were included. These were grouped into 36 patients with healthy periodontium (CAD only) and 24 patients with periodontitis (CAD + P). The demographic variables, cardiac parameters and periodontal parameters were recorded. Cardiac tissue samples were collected during the CABG surgery and were analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for periodontal viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Herpes simplex virus. All the parameters were statistically analyzed.\nAmong the demographic variables, age was statistically significant between the groups. Plaque index, bleeding index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level (CAL) were significantly higher in CAD+P group (P \u02c20.05). Periodontal viruses such as EBV and CMV were significantly higher (62.5% and 75% respectively, P \u02c20.05) in the cardiac samples of the CAD+P than CAD only (25% and 47.2%, respectively). A significant association between EBV and CAL was revealed by multiple logistic regression analysis. (B\u00a0=\u00a00.374, P\u00a0=\u00a00.046) CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed a higher prevalence of periodontal viruses such as EBV and CMV in CAD patients with periodontitis suggesting it as one of the risk factors for CAD.

{"title": "The expression level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 determines the severity of COVID-19: lung and heart tissue as targets.", "abstract": "Researchers have reported some useful information about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies have been performed in order to develop antiviral drugs, from which a few have been prescribed to patients. Also, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19. It has been well-documented that the surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the binding and entry of CoV. After entering, the viral RNA interrupts the cell proliferation system to activate self-proliferation. However, having all the information about the outbreakof the SARS-COV-2, it is not still clear which factors determine the severity of lung and heart function impairment induced by COVID-19. A major step in exploring SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is to determine the distribution of ACE2 in different tissues . In this review, the structure and origin of CoV, the role of ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-COV-2 on the surface of host cells, and the ACE2 distribution in different tissues with a focus on lung and cardiovascular system have been discussed. It was also revealed that acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may result in the clinical severity of COVID-19. In conclusion, this review may provide useful information in developing some promising strategies to end up with a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

{"title": "Human-induced pluripotent stem cells for modelling metabolic perturbations and impaired bioenergetics underlying cardiomyopathies.", "abstract": "Normal cardiac contractile and relaxation functions are critically dependent on a continuous energy supply. Accordingly, metabolic perturbations and impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics with subsequent disruption of ATP production underpin a wide variety of cardiac diseases, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anthracycline cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and mitochondrial cardiomyopathies. Crucially, there are no specific treatments for preventing the onset or progression of these cardiomyopathies to heart failure, one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Therefore, new treatments are needed to target the metabolic disturbances and impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics underlying these cardiomyopathies in order to improve health outcomes in these patients. However, investigation of the underlying mechanisms and the identification of novel therapeutic targets have been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal disease models. Furthermore, interspecies variation precludes the use of animal models for studying certain disorders, whereas patient-derived primary cell lines have limited lifespan and availability. Fortunately, the discovery of human-induced pluripotent stem cells has provided a promising tool for modelling cardiomyopathies via human heart tissue in a dish. In this review article, we highlight the use of patient-derived iPSCs for studying the pathogenesis underlying cardiomyopathies associated with metabolic perturbations and impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, as the ability of iPSCs for self-renewal and differentiation makes them an ideal platform for investigating disease pathogenesis in a controlled in vitro environment. Continuing progress will help elucidate novel mechanistic pathways, and discover novel therapies for preventing the onset and progression of heart failure, thereby advancing a new era of personalized therapeutics for improving health outcomes in patients with cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2020-05-05", "authors": ["Chrishan J ARamachandra", "JasperChua", "ShuoCong", "Myu Mai JaKp", "WinstonShim", "Joseph CWu", "Derek JHausenloy"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvaa125"}

However, the effect of G.\u00a0acuta on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not clear. To explore the mechanisms of G.\u00a0acuta on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced AMI, rats were administered G.\u00a0acuta for 28\u00a0days, then injected intraperitoneally with ISO (85\u00a0mg/kg) on days 29 and 30. An electrocardiogram helped to evaluate the myocardial injury. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were evaluated, and haematoxylin eosin, Masson's trichrome staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining were used to detect myocardial histological changes. Radioimmunoassay was used to measure serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-6. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to analyse serum galectin-3 (Gal-3) levels. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to examine relevant molecular events. The results revealed that pre-treatment with G.\u00a0acuta decreased the elevation in the ST segment; reduced serum LDH, CK and AST levels; alleviated cardiac structure disorder; and reduced inflammatory infiltration, abnormal collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte apoptosis that were induced by ISO. Furthermore, pre-treatment with G.\u00a0acuta inhibited serum Gal-3 levels and Gal-3 expression in heart tissue, and also impeded TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u043aB signalling activation, which ultimately prevented the expression of inflammatory cytokines. The study indicated that pre-treatment with G.\u00a0acuta protects against ISO-induced AMI, and the protective role may be related to inhibiting Gal-3/TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u043aB inflammatory signalling.", "journal": "Inflammopharmacology", "date": "2020-05-02", "authors": ["Jia-HuanSun", "Hong-XiaYang", "Ting-TingYao", "YuanLi", "LinRuan", "Geng-RuiXu", "ChuangZhang", "Guo-XinGuo", "Ai-YingLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s10787-020-00708-4\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.04.056\n10.1016/j.pharep.2019.03.003\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2015.01.017\n10.1016/j.mce.2017.09.003\n10.1016/j.cbi.2015.08.001\n10.3390/molecules22081309\n10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.187\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2009.00794.x\n10.1016/j.ejca.2005.08.016\n10.1080/15384101.2019.1670508\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2015.12.016\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.12.029\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.108817\n10.1016/j.fitote.2016.08.001\n10.1016/j.bse.2009.05.010\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.01.001\n10.1182/blood-2007-03-079616\n10.1016/j.jep.2019.112037\n10.1016/j.intimp.2019.105733\n10.1155/2019/2692970\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.06.082\n10.1056/NEJMoa1707914\n10.1016/j.jep.2016.05.038\n10.1159/000497611\n10.1159/000490866\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.07.014\n10.1053/j.ajkd.2018.03.025\n10.1016/s0092-8674(04)00166-7\n10.1016/j.jep.2015.08.023\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.06.068\n10.1080/14786419.2017.1371157\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109268\n10.1016/j.abb.2019.108187\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.01.073\n10.1016/j.jep.2013.10.017\n10.3892/ijmm.2019.4410\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.05.033\n10.1186/s12885-018-4461-z"}

In mixed lymphocyte reactions, EV-CPC neither induced nor modulated adaptive allogeneic T cell immune responses. They also failed to induce NK cell degranulation, even at high concentrations.

In a mouse model of chronic heart failure, intra-myocardial injections of EV-CPC, 3\u2009weeks after myocardial infarction, decreased both the number of cardiac pro-inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocytes and circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3).

We aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of GS extract against DX-induced cardiotoxicity.\nA\u00a0total of 28\u00a0male Sprague Dawley rats were grouped to receive: (a) standard nutrition (n\u202f=\u20097); (b) standard nutrition with an additional dose of 10\u202fmg/kg DX (n\u202f=\u20097); (c) standard nutrition plus 100\u202fmg/kg/day of GS (n\u202f=\u20097); (d) standard nutrition with 100\u202fmg/kg/day of GS plus a single dose of 10\u202fmg/kg DX. After 35\u00a0days the rats were decapitated and blood samples were taken for biochemical testing. Cardiac tissue samples were prepared for microscopy and histopathological evaluation.\nRats in the DX group exhibited significant elevations in biomarkers such as troponin and NT-proBNP as well as in oxidative stress markers compared with all other groups. Histopathological examination corroborated these findings by demonstrating significant and severe structural injury in the cardiac tissue of DX rates. Moreover, rats in the DX\u202f+\u2009GS group had significantly lower cardiac injury than rats in the DX group according to both biochemical (troponin and NT-proBNP) and histopathological analyses. Serum malondialdehyde levels (a marker of oxidative stress) in the DX\u202f+\u2009GS rats were significantly lower than in the DX rats.\nOur findings suggest that GS may reduce the severity of DX-induced cardiotoxicity and thus has the potential to prevent cardiac injury in this setting.\nHINTERGRUND: Doxorubicin (DX) wird zur Behandlung vieler Arten von Tumoren eingesetzt, eine seiner Nebenwirkungen ist allerdings die Kardiotoxizit\u00e4t, die zu Kardiomyopathie oder Herzinsuffizienz f\u00fchren kann. Oxidativer Stress gilt als wesentlich f\u00fcr die Entstehung kardiotoxischer Wirkungen. Die in Traubenkern\u00f6l-Extrakt vorhandenen Proanthocyanidine k\u00f6nnen die chemisch induzierte Lipidperoxidation und die durch oxidativen Stress erzeugte Apoptose hemmen. Ziel der Autoren war es, die kardioprotektiven Wirkungen von Traubenkern\u00f6l-Extrakt gegen durch DX induzierte Kardiotoxizit\u00e4t zu untersuchen.\nDazu wurden 28 m\u00e4nnliche Sprague-Dawley-Ratten in Gruppen aufgeteilt, sie erhielten entweder (a) Standardnahrung (n\u202f=\u20097); (b) Standardnahrung mit einer zus\u00e4tzlichen Dosis DX von 10\u202fmg/kg (n\u202f=\u20097); (c) Standardnahrung plus Traubenkern\u00f6l-Extrakt in einer Dosierung von 100\u202fmg/kg/Tag (n\u202f=\u20097) oder (d) Standardnahrung mit Traubenkern\u00f6l-Extrakt in einer Dosierung von 100\u202fmg/kg/Tag plus eine Einzeldosis DX von 10\u202fmg/kg. Nach 35\u00a0Tagen wurden die Ratten get\u00f6tet und Blutproben f\u00fcr biochemische Untersuchungen entnommen. Herzgewebeproben wurden zur mikroskopischen und histopathologischen Untersuchung pr\u00e4pariert.\nDie Ratten in der DX-Gruppe wiesen signifikante Erh\u00f6hungen von Biomarkern wie Troponin und NT-proBNP sowie von Markern f\u00fcr oxidativen Stress im Vergleich zu allen anderen Gruppen auf. In der histopathologischen Untersuchung best\u00e4tigten sich diese Befunde durch signifikante und schwere strukturelle L\u00e4sionen im Herzgewebe der DX-Ratten. Zudem waren die kardialen Sch\u00e4digungen gem\u00e4\u00df den biochemischen (Troponin und NT-proBNP) und histopathologischen Analysen bei den Ratten in der Gruppe mit DX plus Traubenkern\u00f6l-Extrakt signifikant geringer als bei den Ratten in der DX-Gruppe. Die Werte f\u00fcr Malondialdehyd im Serum (ein Marker f\u00fcr oxidativen Stress) waren in der Gruppe der Ratten mit DX plus Traubenkern\u00f6l-Extrakt signifikant geringer als bei den Ratten in der DX-Gruppe.\nDie vorliegenden Ergebnisse sind ein Hinweis darauf, dass Traubenkern\u00f6l-Extrakt den Schweregrad der DX-induzierten Kardiotoxizit\u00e4t vermindern kann und somit das Potenzial hat, in diesem Rahmen eine kardiale Sch\u00e4digung zu verhindern.", "journal": "Herz", "date": "2020-01-24", "authors": ["Mehmet \u015eahinAd\u0131yaman", "\u00d6zlem AbaAd\u0131yaman", "Adile FerdaDa\u011fl\u0131", "Mehmet Z\u00fclkifKarahan", "\u0130lyasKaya", "Mustafa NecatiDa\u011fl\u0131"], "doi": "10.1007/s00059-019-04888-w\n10.1016/1040-8428(91)90017-7\n10.1007/s12012-007-0019-z\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000133187.74800.B9\n10.1021/tx800002r\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.03.067\n10.1016/S0306-3623(97)00332-7\n10.1016/0891-5849(95)02227-9\n10.1016/0076-6879(90)86134-H\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2005.08.008\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2003.10.014\n10.1124/pr.56.2.6\n10.1016/S0022-2828(87)80392-9\n10.1007/s10565-008-9070-1\n10.1211/0022357056523\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.06.068\n10.1142/S0192415X08006302\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.03.037\n10.1248/bpb.31.240\n10.1016/j.bmc.2004.10.066"}
