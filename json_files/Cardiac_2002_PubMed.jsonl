To test whether the transcript levels of gene encoding NK-1R in organs are affected by sidestream cigarette smoke (SSCS) exposure, the C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to five groups (six/group) in a study of the dose-effect relationship. The mice were exposed to 0 (filtered room air), 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg total particulate matter (TPM) of SSCS/exposure/day, respectively, for seven days through a nose-only exposure chamber (IN-TOX, Albuquerque, NM, USA). The levels of NK-1R mRNA in the lung, heart, liver, kidney and spleen tissues were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques and normalized against GAPDH expression. NK-1R mRNA in heart tissue showed SSCS-induced dose-dependent downregulation, with minimum expression at a dose of 8.0 mg TPM. Whereas, the levels of NK-1R mRNA in the liver were upregulated to 2.86 and 5.13-fold after exposure to 2.0 and 4.0 mg TPM of SSCS respectively, then returned to 4.19 and 3.93-fold at the exposure doses of 8.0 and 16.0 mg TPM, respectively, when compared to that of the control. In the kidney, SSCS exposure at a dose of 2.0 TPM, but not higher than that level, induced significant elevation of NK-1R mRNA expression. These findings suggest that there are the paracrine and/or autocrine signalling mechanisms through receptor-ligand interactions. No alteration of NK-1R gene expression was observed in the lungs and spleen tissues in this study. The tissue-specific patterns by which SSCS affect NK-1R gene expression in these organs may partially explain dissimilarity of NK-1R activation and the associated toxicity caused by environmental tobacco smoke.", "journal": "Toxicology and industrial health", "date": "2004-06-30", "authors": ["Simon SWong", "Nina NSun", "R ClarkLantz", "Mark LWitten"], "doi": "10.1191/0748233702th168oa"}

These were designated Pem-SGP-A to Pem-SGA-F (Pem, Penaeus monodon; SGP, sinus gland peptide) and their amino-terminal amino acid sequences were analyzed. Five of the 6 peptides (Pem-SGP-A, -B, -D, -E, and -F) exhibited similar amino acid sequences to those of CHH peptides that had been characterized previously from the same prawn species by the other research groups, while 1 peptide (Pem-SGP-C) exhibited a novel sequence. Pem-SGP-C showed sequence similarity to known putative molt-inhibiting hormones (MIHs), particularly to an MIH from the kuruma prawn Penaeus japonicus, and less similarity to the CHHs determined thus far. Two similar complementary DNAs encoding Pem-SGP-C were cloned and found to encode very similar but distinct peptides, which were named Pem-SGP-C1 and Pem-SGA-C2. The open reading frame of each cDNA consisted only of a signal peptide and an MIH-like peptide. We also cloned 2 corresponding genes, both of which consisted of 3 exons and 2 introns.

{"title": "From thallium scan to molecular imaging.", "abstract": "The diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases has been improved considerably by the application of imaging procedures. Among many, scintigraphic procedures have emerged as important diagnostic tools to assess extent, severity, and prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). For more than the last 30 years, however, the application of perfusion imaging has been extended to allow the combined evaluation of perfusion, perfusion reserve, and ventricular function. With positron emission tomography (PET), quantitative assessment of perfusion has become possible. In combination with pharmacological stress agents, the coronary flow reserve (CFR) can be quantitatively assessed as an early marker of endothelial dysfunction. PET in combination with metabolic tracers has added the evaluation of cardiac substrate metabolism, which has become an important clinical marker for ischemically jeopardized myocardium. The PET information is widely considered as the gold standard for tissue viability in the management of patients with advanced CAD and impaired left ventricular function (LVF). New tracer approaches include the assessment of cardiac innervation, which plays an increasingly recognized role in the pathophysiology of cardiac diseases. Radiolabeled catecholamine analogues provide visualization of sympathetic nerve terminals that are functionally altered in patients with diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy. In addition, this scintigraphic information allows the monitoring of physiological processes such as reinnervation of the transplanted heart. New methods, such as imaging of apoptosis and gene expression, are of interest in cardiology. Combining the therapeutic gene with a reporter gene, the transfection of cardiac tissue can be monitored noninvasively.

{"title": "Is peripartum cardiomyopathy an organ-specific autoimmune disease?", "abstract": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare and serious heart disease that exclusively afflicts women during childbearing years. Symptoms include rapid onset of cardiovascular insufficiency occurring during pregnancy, initiated anytime between the third trimester until 5 months post-partum in the absence of any other signs or history of heart disease. The rare incidence of PPCM and the absence of any relevant animal models have limited research and understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved. Several compelling sets of data support the view that PPCM is a form of autoimmune IDCM. However, PPCM differs from autoimmune IDCM in that (a) it is associated with unique sets of autoantibodies and autoantigens, (b) it has a relatively rapid onset, and (c) it exclusively affects pregnant women. Furthermore, the etiology of PPCM is dependent on the interaction of pregnancy associated factors, e.g. increased hemodynamic stress, vasoactive hormones and fetal microchimerism, that co-operate in the context of essential immune and genetic environments for disease progression. Our model of PPCM attempts to represent how multiple factors, e.g. pregnancy, genetics, immune dysregulation, and fetal microchimerism are held in a complex dynamic balance that can co-operate towards the maintenance of cardiovascular health or disease in the mother (Fig. 1). A more thorough study of the precise nature of the cardiac tissue autoantigens may lead to the identification of the mechanisms of breakdown of self-tolerance and perhaps also the putative etiologic agent(s).

Our objective in this computational study was to investigate wave interactions in excitable media and to explore the feasibility of using overdrive pacing to suppress spiral wave chaos. This work is based on the finding that in excitable media, propagating waves with the highest excitation frequency eventually overtake all other waves. We analyzed the effects of low-amplitude, high-frequency pacing in one-dimensional and two-dimensional networks of coupled, excitable cells governed by the Luo-Rudy model. In the one-dimensional cardiac model, we found narrow high-frequency regions of 1:1 synchronization between the input stimulus and the system's response. The frequencies in this region were higher than the intrinsic spiral wave frequency of cardiac tissue. When we paced the two-dimensional cardiac model with frequencies from this region, we found that spiral wave chaos could, in some cases, be suppressed. When we coupled the overdrive pacing with calcium channel blockers, we found that spiral wave chaos could be suppressed in all cases. These findings suggest that low-amplitude, high-frequency overdrive pacing, in combination with calcium channel inhibitors (e.g., class II or class IV antiarrhythmic drugs), may be useful for eliminating fibrillation.

Different modes of reentry termination are described. The classical mode of termination by unidirectional block, in which a stimulus produces only a retrograde front that collides with the activation front of the reentry, can be obtained for both S1 and S1-S2 applied over a small vulnerable window. We demonstrate that another scenario of termination-that we term collision block-can also be induced by the S1-S2 protocol. This scenario is obtained over a much wider range of S1-S2 coupling intervals than the one leading to a unidirectional block. In the collision block, S1 produces a retrograde front, colliding with the activation front of the pre-existing reentry, and an antegrade front propagating in the same direction as the initial reentry. Then, S2 also produces an antegrade and a retrograde front. However, the propagation of these fronts in the spatial profile of repolarization left by S1 leads to a termination of the reentrant activity. More complex behaviors also occur in which the antegrade fronts produced by S1 and S2 both persist for several turns, displaying a growing alternation in action potential duration (\"alternans amplification\") that may lead to the termination of the reentrant activity. The hypothesis that both collision block and alternans amplification depend on the interaction between the action potential duration restitution curve and the recovery curve of conduction velocity is supported by the fact that the dynamical behaviors were reproduced using an integro-delay equation based on these two properties. We thus describe two new mechanisms (collision block and alternans amplification) whereby electrical stimulation can terminate reentrant activity.

{"title": "Multiple mechanisms of spiral wave breakup in a model of cardiac electrical activity.", "abstract": "It has become widely accepted that the most dangerous cardiac arrhythmias are due to reentrant waves, i.e., electrical wave(s) that recirculate repeatedly throughout the tissue at a higher frequency than the waves produced by the heart's natural pacemaker (sinoatrial node). However, the complicated structure of cardiac tissue, as well as the complex ionic currents in the cell, have made it extremely difficult to pinpoint the detailed dynamics of these life-threatening reentrant arrhythmias. A simplified ionic model of the cardiac action potential (AP), which can be fitted to a wide variety of experimentally and numerically obtained mesoscopic characteristics of cardiac tissue such as AP shape and restitution of AP duration and conduction velocity, is used to explain many different mechanisms of spiral wave breakup which in principle can occur in cardiac tissue. Some, but not all, of these mechanisms have been observed before using other models; therefore, the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate them using just one framework model and to explain the different parameter regimes or physiological properties necessary for each mechanism (such as high or low excitability, corresponding to normal or ischemic tissue, spiral tip trajectory types, and tissue structures such as rotational anisotropy and periodic boundary conditions). Each mechanism is compared with data from other ionic models or experiments to illustrate that they are not model-specific phenomena.

{"title": "Enhanced self-termination of re-entrant arrhythmias as a pharmacological strategy for antiarrhythmic action.", "abstract": "Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation are potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias generated by high frequency, irregular spatio-temporal electrical activity. Re-entrant propagation has been demonstrated as a mechanism generating these arrhythmias in computational and in vitro animal models of these arrhythmias. Re-entry can be idealised in homogenous isotropic virtual cardiac tissues as spiral and scroll wave solutions of reaction-diffusion equations. A spiral wave in a bounded medium can be terminated if its core reaches a boundary. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients are sometimes observed to spontaneously self-terminate. One possible mechanism for self-termination of a spiral wave is meander of its core to an inexcitable boundary. We have previously proposed the hypothesis that the spatial extent of meander of a re-entrant wave in the heart can be directly related to its probability of self-termination, and so inversely related to its lethality. Meander in two-dimensional virtual ventricular tissues based on the Oxsoft family of cell models, with membrane excitation parameters simulating the inherited long Q-T syndromes has been shown to be consistent with this hypothesis: the largest meander is seen in the syndrome with the lowest probability of death per arrhythmic episode. Here we extend our previous results to virtual tissues based on the Luo-Rudy family of models. Consistent with our hypothesis, for both families of models, whose different ionic mechanisms produce different patterns of meander, the LQT virtual tissue with the larger meander simulates the syndrome with the lower probability of death per episode. Further, we search the parameter space of the repolarizing currents to find their conductance parameter values that give increased meander of spiral waves. These parameters may provide targets for antiarrhythmic drugs designed to act by increasing the likelihood of self-termination of re-entrant arrhythmias.

{"title": "Brain-heart connection and the risk of heart attack.", "abstract": "Autonomic functions, such as increased sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus, higher nervous centres, depression, hostility and aggression appear to be important determinants of heart rate variability (HRV), which is, itself, an important risk factor of myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, sudden death, heart failure and atherosclerosis. The circadian rhythm of these complications with an increased occurrence in the second quarter of the day may be due to autonomic dysfunction as well as to the presence of excitatory brain and heart tissues. While increased sympathetic activity is associated with increased levels of cortisol, catecholamines, serotonin, renin, aldosterone, angiotensin and free radicals; increased parasympathetic activity may be associated with greater levels of acetylecholine, dopamine, nitric oxide, endorphins, coenzyme Q10, antioxidants and other protective factors. Recent studies indicate that hyperglycemia, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, ambient pollution, insulin resistance and mental stress can increase the risk of low HRV. These risk factors, which are known to favour cardiovascular disease, seem to act by decreasing HRV. There is evidence that regular fasting may modulate HRV and other risk factors of heart attack. While exercise is known to decrease HRV, exercise training may not have any adverse effect on HRV. In a recent study among 202 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the incidence of onset of chest pain was highest in the second quarter of the day (41.0%), mainly between 4.0-8.0 AM, followed by the fourth quarter, usually after large meals (28.2%). Emotion was the second most common trigger (43.5%). Cold weather was a predisposing factor in 29.2% and hot temperature (> 40 degrees celsius) was common in 24.7% of the patients. Dietary n-3 fatty acids and coenzyme Q10 have been found to prevent the increased circadian occurrence of cardiac events in our randomized controlled trials, possibly by increasing HRV. We have also found that n-3 fatty acids plus CoQ can decrease TNF-alpha and IL-6 in AMI which are pro-inflammatory agents. There is evidence that dietary n-3 fatty acids canenhance hippocampal acetylecholine levels, which may be protective. Similarly, the stimulation of the vagus nerve may inhibit TNF synthesis in the liver and acetylecholine, the principal vagal neurotransmitter, significantly attenuates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, interleukin 1,6 and 18, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in experiments. Therefore, any agent which can enhance brain acetylecholine levels, may be used as a therapeutic agent in protecting the suprachiasmatic nucleus, higher nervous centres, vagal activity and sympathetic nerve activity which are known to regulate the body clock and HRV and the risk of SCD and heart attack.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2003-03-26", "authors": ["R BSingh", "CKartik", "KOtsuka", "DPella", "JPella"], "doi": "10.1016/s0753-3322(02)00300-1"}
{"title": "[Cardiotoxicity of lindane, a gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane].", "abstract": "The goal of the present review is to collect information concerning membrane effects induced by lindane intoxication, a y isomer of hexachiorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) that has been largely used as an insecticide and disinfectant in agriculture and entered also in the composition of some lotions, creams and shampoos used against parasites (lice and scabies). Absorbed through respiratory, digestive or transcutaneous pathways, lindane accumulates within lipid rich tissues. Lindane accumulation depends on the duration of the exposure and affects tissues in the following order: adipose tissues > brain > kidney > muscle > lungs > heart > liver > blood. Whatever the mode of lindane absorption, it accumulates in blood and is distributed throughout the body. It may affect human health by exerting systemic, immunologic, teratogenic, and/or cancerogenic effects. The symptoms of lindane intoxication are different according to the mode of intoxication, acute or chronic. The absorption of high doses of gamma-HCH is particularly toxic for the central nervous system and for the female and male reproduction apparatus in mammals where lindane is considered as an endocrine disruptor. Lindane is highly lipophilic and incorporates into biological membranes according to the following sequence: mitochondria > sarcoplasmic reticulum > myelin > brain microsomes > erythrocytes. Lindane exerts a stimulating action on synaptic transmission and inhibits the chloride current activated by gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) of many muscular and nervous preparations by interacting with the receptors GABA-chloride channel complex. It seems to affect calcium homeostasis of many tissues. The similarity between lindane and inositol (1, 4, 5) phosphate (IP3) suggested that lindane releases Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive intracellular stores in macrophages and myometrial cells. Ca2+ release from reticulum endoplasmic, mitochondria and other Ca2+ stores has been reported in cat kidney cells. Lindane altered energetic metabolism of hepatic mitochondria and the inositol-phosphate synthesis in neuronal cells. However, lindane does not compete with the IP3 receptor. Lindane produces a Ca2+ influx in mice peritoneal macrophage cells responsible for the Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release produced by phospholipase C via IP3 pathway and resulting in a maintained increase of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Lindane decreased the membrane erythrocyte and cerebral cell concentration of phosphatidyl inositol PI, PIP and PIP2 in rats repetitively exposed to lindane for 3 or 6 months. Lindane induces oxidative stress; it modifies the activity of the scavenger enzymes. This effect is involved in the inhibition of intercellular gap junctions. Modifications of the electrocardiogram (ECG), sinusal rhythm alteration and negative and dysphasic variations of T wave, similar to those produced by hyperkaliemia, have been reported after lindane absorption. During acute lindane poisoning, the activities of serum transaminases (SGOT, SGTP), and lactate deshydrogenase (LDH) increase. Lindane produces histological alterations of cardiac tissues and a cardio-vascular dystrophy (contracture, degenerescence and necrosis) mainly in the left ventricular wall and a hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Chronic application of residual doses of lindane shortened the action potential duration in rat papillary muscle. These effects were similar to those induced by hyperthyroidism. Lindane increases the triiodothyronine (T3) serum level in hyperthyroid rats. T3 plays an important role in the postnatal development of the rat ventricle by increasing the density of potassium channels which contribute to action potential shortening during the development. Thyroid hormones influence the regulation and the expression of messengers ARN which encode different potassium channels involved in action potential repolarization (Kvl.2; Kvl.4; Kvl.5; Kv2.1; Kv4; HCN2). The thyrotropine-releasing hormone (TRH) modulates the HERG-type rapid delayed potassium channel (IKr) encoded by the human gene ether-a-go-go in rat anterior pituitary cells GH3/B6. This channel is involved in the cardiac long QT syndrome. TRH modifies the current kinetics of human HERG potassium channel co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with the TRH receptor, whose activity is modulated via the protein kinase C pathway linked to a G protein-coupled receptor and is regulated by changes in the PIP2 concentration in the membrane. IKr channels regulation is also dependent on sexual hormones. In conclusion, lindane affects the excitable membranes and the cardio circulatory system. These alterations (may) represent a potential risk for human health.", "journal": "Journal de la Societe de biologie", "date": "2003-03-21", "authors": ["Martin-PierreSauviat", "NicolePages"], "doi": null}

The underlying mechanism(s) for the negative inotropism is relatively unknown.\nWe investigated the effects of beta3-AR activation on basal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (I(CaL)) amplitude of the guinea pig enzyme-dissociated single ventricular myocytes using amphotericin B (200 microg/mL) perforated-patch whole-cell patch-clamp techniques (approximately 22 degrees C).\nApplication of (-)-isoprenaline ((-)-ISO) (100 nM, a nonselective beta-AR agonist) increased the basal I(CaL) amplitude (approximately 210% of control) (n = 8). However, in the presence of nadolol (1 degreesM, a beta1-/beta2-AR antagonist), the stimulatory effect of (-)-ISO on I(CaL )was abolished and a slowly developed inhibition of the basal I(CaL) was recorded (approximately 80% of control) (n = 9).

The supplementation of Se has been shown to lower blood cholesterol and increase tissue concentrations of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH); however, the effects of Se supplementation, either alone or in combination with supplemental Vit E, on FO-induced oxidative stress and hyperlipidemia have not been studied. Male Syrian hamsters received FO-based diets that contained 14.3 wt% fat and 0.46 wt% cholesterol supplemented with Vit E (129 IU D-alpha-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet) and/or Se (3.4 ppm as sodium selenate) or that contained basal requirements of both nutrients. The cardiac tissue of hamsters fed supplemental Se showed increased concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) but decreased oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations. The higher concentrations of LPO in the hearts of Se-supplemented hamsters were not lowered with concurrent Vit E supplementation. In the liver, Se supplementation was associated with higher Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity and an increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio, whereas a lower hepatic non-Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity was seen with Vit E supplementation. Supplemental intake of Se was associated with lower plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol plus very low density lipoprotein cholesterol. In view of the pro-oxidative effects of Se supplementation on cardiac tissue, a cautionary approach needs to be taken regarding the plasma lipid-lowering properties of supplemental Se.", "journal": "Lipids", "date": "2003-03-06", "authors": ["JohannePoirier", "KevinCockell", "NickHidiroglou", "ReneMadere", "KeithTrick", "StanKubow"], "doi": "10.1007/s11745-002-1009-9"}

{"title": "Assessment of the CTNNA3 gene encoding human alpha T-catenin regarding its involvement in dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Alpha T-catenin is a novel member of the alpha-catenin family, which shows most abundant expression in cardiomyocytes and in peritubular myoid cells of the testis, pointing to a specific function for alpha T-catenin in particular muscle tissues. Like other alpha-catenins, alpha T-catenin provides an indispensable link between the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion complex and the cytoskeleton, to mediate cell-cell adhesion. By isolating genomic clones, combined with database sequence analysis, we have been able to determine the structure of the CTNNA3 and Ctnna3 genes, encoding human and mouse alpha T-catenin, respectively. The positions of the exon-exon boundaries are completely conserved in CTNNA3, Ctnna3, and the alpha N-catenin encoding CTNNA2 gene. They overlap largely with the boundaries of the CTNNA1 and CTNNAL1 genes encoding alpha E-catenin and alpha-catulin, respectively. This emphasizes that these alpha-catenin genes evolved from the same ancestor gene. Nevertheless, the introns of CTNNA3 and Ctnna3 are remarkably large (often more than 100 kb) compared with introns of other CTNNA genes. The CTNNA3 gene was mapped to chromosome band 10q21 by both fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase-chain-reaction-based hybrid mapping. This region encodes a gene for autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a common cause of morbidity and mortality. As alpha T-catenin is highly expressed in healthy heart tissue, we have considered CTNNA3 as a candidate disease gene in a family showing DCM linkage to the 10q21-q23 locus. Mutation screening of all 18 exons of the CTNNA3 gene in this family has, however, not detected any DCM-linked CTNNA3 mutations.", "journal": "Human genetics", "date": "2003-02-22", "authors": ["BarbaraJanssens", "BhagyalaxmiMohapatra", "MatteoVatta", "StevenGoossens", "GrietVanpoucke", "PatrickKools", "TonyMontoye", "Jolandavan Hengel", "Neil EBowles", "Fransvan Roy", "Jeffrey ATowbin"], "doi": "10.1007/s00439-002-0857-5"}

Cardiac remodeling is influenced by several factors still under investigation. Hibernation is basically an adaptive mechanism to chronically abnormal coronary blood flow, characterized by metabolic and structural alterations of the cardiac tissue, that are fully recovered upon revascularization. The estimate of the prevalence of myocardial viability in patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction is crucial and different figures can be obtained by applying different diagnostic techniques and analyzing different cohorts of patients. In patients with chronic heart failure and substantial areas of myocardial ischemia and viability, revascularization is likely to prolong survival. The amount of viable myocardium needed to be clinically relevant remains to be established: only randomized prospective studies, focusing on both functional improvement and prognosis, will give an evidence-based conclusion.

{"title": "Cell transplantation--a potential therapy for cardiac repair in the future?", "abstract": "Adult human myocardium cannot regenerate because cardiac muscle cells do not reenter the cell cycle. Myoblasts, cardiomyocytes, and stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have been transplanted in experimental settings to replace lost myocardial tissue. The purpose of this paper is to review the experimental data about cell transfer onto myocardium and to highlight the advantages of the particular cell types used.\nMyoblasts or satellite cells are precursor cells attached to skeletal muscle fibers. The transfer of these cells onto damaged myocardium was demonstrated successfully in several animal models. Because myoblasts can be expanded in culture, a large number of cells can be obtained from only a small skeletal muscle specimen. These cells could be delivered locally by injection within a damaged myocardial area or by coronary infusion. However, only one group has been able to show an improvement in myocardial function after myoblast transfer. The second type of cells used experimentally for cell transfer were fetal cardiomyocytes. Fetal cardiomyocytes retain the ability to divide and therefore can be expanded in culture. The cells were integrated into the myocardial tissue, differentiated into normal cardiac muscle cells, and formed intercellular connections with host myocardial cells. The transplantation of these cells onto cryo-injured myocardium resulted in improved cardiac function in several animal models. Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes can be selected from embryonic stem cells. These cells still divide and differentiate into different cardiac muscle cells (atrial, ventricular, and pacemaker). After transplantation into damaged myocardium in mice, they formed stable grafts and survived for at least 7 weeks. The selection of these cells has to be performed with care to prevent teratoma formation originating from single undifferentiated cells attached to the transferred cells. Recent experimental studies revealed the ability of bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. These cells were transplanted into damaged myocardium via coronary perfusion. They survived for at least 4 weeks and showed differentiation toward cardiac muscle cells. The functional benefit of bone marrow stem cells, however, has not been clearly demonstrated, and there is a possibility of tumor formations originating from these cells.\nMyoblasts and bone marrow stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes would permit autologous cell transfer onto the myocardium. These cells can be easily obtained and expanded in culture. Gene transfer is also possible, and there are no ethical proscriptions against an autologous cell transfer. However, the integration and final differentiation of these cells in the heart tissue is not clear yet. Fetal cardiomyocytes, on the other hand, are integrated in the myocardial tissue, improve cardiac function, and can be expanded in culture. Their transfer would be allogenic, making immunosuppression necessary. Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes could be used to replace all 3 types of cardiac muscle cells, and they can be expanded in culture. The possibility of teratoma formation makes a 100%- selection mandatory. At present, ethical concerns against working with human embryonic stem cells are a factor to be considered.\nCell transfer therapy has been shown to improve myocardial function in animal experiments. This finding indicates that a reduced myocardial function can be improved by cell transfer therapy.

Deletion and religation studies of the promoter suggested that D2 acted as an enhancer but could not totally substitute for the F41 function. Mutational analyses demonstrated that the direct repeat was required for the DNA-binding and promoter activity. Moreover, cardiac-specific 42kDa proteins and a ubiquitous high mobility group 2 (HMG2) protein were identified to be responsible for the binding to the TCTG(G/C) direct repeat and the A/T-rich sequence, respectively. Overexpression of HMG2 had differential effects on the promoter in cardiomyocytes versus fibroblasts. Our results provided the first evidence to support that HMG2 together with tissue-specific factors could direct a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on thecardiac troponin T gene expression in heart or non-heart tissue, respectively.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2002-12-31", "authors": ["QinWang", "JennyLi-Chun Lin", "JimJung-Ching Lin"], "doi": "10.1006/jmcc.2002.2116"}
{"title": "Therapeutic use of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor peptide to prevent mice chagasic cardiac dysfunction.", "abstract": "Therapeutic use of a peptide corresponding to the aminoacid sequence of the second extracellular loop of human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 mAChR peptide) was studied. Expression and biological activity of M2 mAChR in association with circulating M2 mAChR-related antibodies in cardiac tissue from chagasic mice were evaluated. Mice infected or not with trypomastigotes Tulahuen strain either treated or not treated with M2 mAChR peptide were sacrificed at 8-9 weeks post-infection. Morphological, binding and contractility studies were performed on all animal groups. Hearts from infected mice showed a mAChR-related dysfunction, with a decrease in heart contractility, impaired response to exogenous mAChR agonist (carbachol) and a significant reduction of mAChR binding sites. Treating infected mice with M2 mAChR peptide reversed those effects. Moreover, autoantibodies from infected mice recognized the M2 mAChR peptide. In addition, serum from infected mice and the corresponding affinity purified IgG was capable of interacting with cardiac mAChR, reducing the number of binding sites and inhibiting the contractile response to exogenous agonist. In conclusion, (1) the development of alterations in mAChR related to cardiac dysfunction, may be associated with the presence of circulating antibodies against these receptors and (2) the chronic treatment with M2 mAChR peptide prevented infected mice heart dysfunction. The mechanism could be explained by the ability of the M2 mAChR peptide to inhibit the chronic interaction of autoantibodies specific to mAChR. The implication of M2 mAChR peptide treatment in the host's immune response is discussed.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2002-12-31", "authors": ["LeonorSterin-Borda", "LilianJoensen", "CarolinaBayo-Hanza", "M\u00f3nicaEsteva", "EnriBorda"], "doi": "10.1006/jmcc.2002.2114"}
{"title": "Regulation of myocardial fibrillar collagen by angiotensin II. A role in hypertensive heart disease?", "abstract": "Collagen types I and III (Col I and Col III) are the major fibrillar collagens produced by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the adult heart. Fibrillar collagen of the heart provides the structural scaffolding for cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels and imparts cardiac tissue with physical properties that include stiffness and resistance to deformation. In addition, fibrillar collagen may also act as a link between contractile element of adjacent cardiomyocytes and as a conduit of information that is necessary for cell function. As in other organs, collagen turnover of normal adult heart results from the equilibrium between the synthesis and degradation of Col I and Col III. A number of factors have been described that may alter the balance in favor of either the synthesis (e.g., angiotensin II-ANG II-) or the degradation. Predominance of synthesis over degradation leads to increased Col I and Col III deposition or fibrosis that accompanies cardiac diseases such as hypertensive heart disease. Fibrosis alters myocardial structure and function and adversely afects the clinical outcome of hypertensive patients. Various lines of evidence suggest that besides hypertension, systemically and/or locally produced ANG II may participate in the development of hypertensive myocardial fibrosis via activation of ANG II type 1 receptors (AT(1)R). The potential clinical relevance of this possibility is linked to the ability of antihypertensive drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and AT(1)R antagonists (ARAs) to reverse myocardial fibrosis beyond their antihypertensive efficacy.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2002-12-31", "authors": ["ArantxaGonz\u00e1lez", "Bego\u00f1aL\u00f3pez", "Ram\u00f3nQuerejeta", "JavierD\u00edez"], "doi": "10.1006/jmcc.2002.2081"}

We investigated them on cultured cells transfected or constitutively expressing both ACE and B2 receptor. The potentiation of bradykinin was indirect and attributed to a crosstalk induced between enzyme and receptor via ACE, a heterodimer formation. While looking for endogenous activators, we investigated the split products of angiotensin I (Ang) Ang 1-9 and 1-7, peptides released by enzymes of human atria and ventricle. Ang 1-9 was liberated by a cathepsin A-type enzyme, Ang 1-7 by a different metallopeptidase-protease. Cathepsin A's presence in heart tissue was shown by deamidating enkephalinamide substrate, by immunoprecipitation and by immunohistochemistry. In immunohistochemistry, cathepsin A was detected in myocytes of atrial tissue. Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7 potentiated the effect of an ACE-resistant bradykinin analogue on the B2 receptor in transfected cells expressing human ACE and B2, and in human endothelial cells. Ang 1-9 and 1-7 augmented arachidonic acid and NO release by bradykinin. NO liberation by bradykinin from endothelial cells was potentiated at 10nmol/L concentration by Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7; at higher concentrations, Ang 1-9 was significantly more active. Both peptides had little activity in absence of bradykinin or ACE. Ang 1-9 and 1-7 potentiated bradykinin action on its B2 receptor at much lower concentrations than their IC50 values with ACE.

{"title": "Functional regulation of alternatively spliced Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) isoforms.", "abstract": "Alternative splicing of RNA transcripts is a general characteristic for NCX genes in mammals, mollusks, and arthropods. Among the family of three NCX genes in mammals, the NCX1 gene contains six exons, namely, A, B, C, D, E, and F, that make up the alternatively spliced region. Studies of the NCX1 gene transcripts suggested that 16 distinct gene products can be produced from the NCX1 gene. The exons A and B are mutually exclusive when expressed. Generally, exon A-containing transcripts are predominantly found in excitable cells like cardiomyoctes and neurons, whereas exon B-containing transcripts are mostly found in nonexcitable cells like astrocytes and kidney cells. Other alternatively spliced exons (C-F) appear to be cassette-type exons and are found in various combinations. Interestingly, exon D is present in all characterized transcripts. The alternatively spliced isoforms of NCX1 show tissue-specific expression patterns, suggesting functional adaptation to tissues. To investigate functional differences among alternatively spliced isoforms of NCX1, we expressed an exon A-containing transcript present in cardiac tissue (NCX1.1) and an exon B-containing transcript found in the kidney (NCX1.3) in Xenopus oocytes. We demonstrated that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers expressed by exon A- and exon B-containing transcripts display differences in activation by PKA and by [Ca(2+)](i). We also observed that these two isoforms show differences in voltage dependence.

To determine the complete sequence of slow skeletal MHC 2, we isolated six overlapping cDNA clones, each encoding a portion of chick slow skeletal MHC 2, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The entire slow skeletal MHC 2 cDNA consisted of 5927 nucleotides including a 104 bp 3'-untranslated region and encoded 1941 amino acids. Using one of the cDNA clones, we made a probe for in situ hybridization. We also used immunohistochemistry to localize slow skeletal MHC 2 in skeletal and cardiac tissues. These studies showed that in addition to its expected expression in the adult chicken slow skeletal muscle, slow skeletal MHC 2 was expressed in the subendocardial cluster of cells and around the blood vessels within the ventricle of late embryos and adults. This isoform was not expressed in the myocardium throughout the life of the chicken. Based on morphological criteria as well as rich desmin expression, we concluded that the subendocardial cluster of cells were Purkinje cells.

{"title": "Characterization of fibroblasts from rejecting tissue: the hyaluronan production is increased.", "abstract": "Interstitial edema of rejecting tissue can be partly attributed to the local accumulation of hyaluronan, which has strong water-binding capacity. The aim of the present study was to isolate fibroblasts from rejecting tissue and compare them, in terms of hyaluronan production and proliferation rate, with fibroblasts obtained from nontransplanted tissue. Furthermore, the fibroblast response to various cytokines involved in the rejection process was studied.\nFibroblasts were isolated from normal rat heart tissue and from cardiac allografts undergoing rejection. The various preparations were characterized with regard to hyaluronan production (radiometric assay) and cell proliferation ( H-thymidine incorporation). In addition, the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and interleukin (IL)-2 on these parameters were studied.\nFibroblasts isolated from rejecting hearts displayed strongly up-regulated hyaluronan production and proliferation rate as compared with fibroblasts obtained from normal tissue. In the presence of TNF-alpha, the proliferation of nonconfluent cells was augmented, whereas in confluent cultures of fibroblasts from rejecting tissue, the proliferation was inhibited. IFN-gamma stimulated both hyaluronan secretion and proliferation in confluent fibroblasts from rejecting hearts but had no effect on fibroblasts from normal tissue. IL-2, finally, reduced the hyaluronan production of nonconfluent cells.\nThe activation of fibroblasts is increased in rejecting tissue. As a result, the hyaluronan concentration is elevated which, in vivo, contributes to the formation of an interstitial edema and a subsequently increased tissue pressure.

{"title": "Carvedilol protects against doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose-limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin. Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process. The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties, protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity. Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg sc/week), carvedilol (1 mg/kg ip/week), or the combination of the two drugs. Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin-treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration (336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom O/min/mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats. Mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity and the activity of NADH-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin-treated rats. Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria (3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity. Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver. Carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Ca(2+) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin. Carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria. It is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose-limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long-term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2002-12-25", "authors": ["D LSantos", "A J MMoreno", "R LLeino", "M KFroberg", "K BWallace"], "doi": "10.1006/taap.2002.9532"}

In this study, four groups of female rats were used while the rats were trained to swim for 30 minutes a day and five days a week which lasted eight weeks and vitamin E (vit. E) supplementation (30 mg/kg/day) has been carried out for five days a week. TBARS levels are significantly found lower in both trained and sedentary vit. E supplemented groups, since vit.

E supplemented trained rats, the glutathione response is observed to be significantly higher, supporting with the TBARS levels and in accordance with the literature. But in the sedentary group without vit. E supplementation, the GSH levels of the liver and the heart tissues were significantly lower than both vit. E supplemented sedentary and trained groups.

We have therefore investigated the bradykinin B1-receptor (B1R) and B2-receptor (B2R) mRNA expression in rat models of MI, LVH and diabetes mellitus (DM). Sprague-Dawley rats (SD) were submitted to permanent ligation of the left descending coronary artery (LAD) to induce a MI, whereas DM was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). LVH was induced after thoracic aortic banding (AB). Three weeks after MI, six weeks after STZ injection or six weeks after AB, left ventricular (LV) function was characterized using a Millar-tip catheter. Cardiac B1R- and B2R-mRNA expression were analyzed by specific RNase-protection assays (RPA). LV contractility (dP/dt max) was impaired by 40-48% in rats after induction of MI or DM compared to their controls. However, despite an enormous increase in LV end-diastolic pressure (LEVDP) to 310% after AB, LV contractility did not differ compared to the controls. These hemodynamic changes were accompanied by an up-regulation of cardiac B1R- (MI, 288%; STZ, 215%; AB, 4180%) and B2R-mRNA expression (MI, 122%; STZ, 288%; AB, 96%).

In this paper, we deal with erythrocytes linked to Tf as possible physiological targeting carrier systems for delivering anticancer drugs. For that purpose we have used glutaraldehyde (0.1%) as a coupling agent between Tf and erythrocytes. The highest amount of Tf linked to erythrocytes turned out to be 0.76 +/- 0.13 microg Tf/10(6) cells, while reaching 65% of cell recovery. After 13 days, the Tf-erythrocytes hemolysis reached 50%, with transferrin still coupled to erythrocytes. The in vivo kinetic behaviour of intravenously injected 51Cr-Tf-erythrocytes showed a reduced half-life to hours as compared to days of controls. However, a considerable percentage of Tf-erythrocytes (close to 20%) remained circulating for a relatively long period (around 2 days), which made possible the specific targeting by these carrier systems. In vivo biodistribution studies indicated that 51Cr-Tf-erythrocytes rapidly accumulated in the different studied organs (liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, femur-tibia, and heart), suggesting a selective removal of Tf-erythrocytes by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system present mainly in liver and spleen. On the other hand, Tf-erythrocytes showed a poor targeting of heart tissue, therefore a reduced cardiac toxicity should be expected after administration of erythrocyte-encapsulated drugs. The presence of Tf-erythrocytes in femur-tibia and spleen could be related to the Tf-specific binding to the hematopoietic cells containing Tf receptors. The final results of this study encourage additional research on Tf-erythrocyte to investigate the relationship between transferrin-mediated targeting by carrier erythrocytes and uptake of different erythrocyte-encapsulated drugs.

{"title": "Localization of sodium channels in intercalated disks modulates cardiac conduction.", "abstract": "It is well known that the sodium current (I(Na)) and the degree of gap-junctional electrical coupling are the key determinants of action potential (AP) conduction in cardiac tissue. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that sodium channels (NaChs) are preferentially located in intercalated disks (IDs). Using dual immunocytochemical staining, we confirmed the colocalization of NaChs with connexin43 in cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. In mathematical simulations of conduction using the Luo-Rudy dynamic model of the ventricular AP, we assessed the hypothesis that conduction could be modulated by the preferential localization of NaChs in IDs. Localization of I(Na) at the ID caused a large negative potential in the intercellular cleft, which influenced conduction in two opposing ways, depending on the degree of electrical coupling: (1) for normal and moderately reduced coupling, the negative cleft potential led to a large overshoot of the transmembrane potential resulting in a decreased driving force for I(Na) itself (self-attenuation), which slowed conduction; (2) for greatly reduced coupling (<10%), the negative cleft potential induced by I(Na) in the prejunctional membrane led to suprathreshold depolarization of the postjunctional membrane, which facilitated and accelerated conduction. When cleft potential effects were not incorporated, conduction was not significantly affected by the ID localization of I(Na). By enhancing conduction through the establishment of cleft potentials, the localization of NaChs in IDs might protect the myocardium from conduction block, very slow conduction, and microreentry under conditions of greatly reduced coupling. Conversely, by supporting moderately slow conduction, this mechanism could also promote arrhythmias.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2002-12-14", "authors": ["Jan PKucera", "StephanRohr", "YoramRudy"], "doi": "10.1161/01.res.0000046237.54156.0a"}

Control rats underwent transection and anastomosis; SBS animals underwent 75% small-bowel resection. Rats were killed at 3 or 14 days. Total body weight, heart weight, heart-tissue total lipid, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined at death. Total RNA from the myocardium was extracted using TRIZOL reagent. Northern-blot analysis was used to determine FAT/CD36 mRNA. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test with P values below 0.05 considered significant.

Decreases in plasma triglycerides (38.2 +/- 3.8 vs 58.8 +/- 5.5 mg/dl, P < 0.05) and cholesterol (38.2 +/- 6.9 vs 55.3 +/- 8.2 mg/dl, P < 0.05) in SBS-NC compared to Sham-NC rats on day 3 was accompanied by a twofold increase ( P < 0.05) in myocardial CD36/FAT mRNA levels. Early exposure to HFD led to increased (vs SBS-NC) plasma cholesterol (82.9 +/- 5.7 vs 38.2 +/- 6.9 mg/dl, P < 0.05) and triglycerides (62.5 +/- 15.6 vs 38.2 +/- 3.8 mg/dl, P < 0.05), and a concomitant decrease in CD36/FAT mRNA levels (45.1 +/- 17.8 vs 86.6 +/- 15%, respectively, P < 0.05). Plasma lipid concentration and myocardial CD36/FAT mRNA levels on day 14 were not significantly different among the experimental groups. In this rat model of SBS, the heart thus reacts to decreased LCFA delivery by increased tissue CD36/FAT mRNA levels and, consequently, active LCFA uptake.

Mammalian cells must maintain genomic stability in their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, which have different degrees of vulnerability to DNA damage. This study quantifies DNA glycosylase activity in mitochondria and nucleus from C57/BL 6 mouse tissues including brain, liver, heart, muscle, kidney, and testis. The activities of oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), uracil DNA glycosylase, and endonuclease III homologue 1 (NTH1) were measured using oligonucleotide substrates with DNA lesions specific for each glycosylase. Mitochondrial content was normalized to citrate synthase activity and mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. In nuclear and mitochondrial extracts, the highest DNA glycosylase activities were in testis. Brain and heart, tissues with the highest oxidative load, did not have higher levels of OGG1 or NTH1 activity than muscle or kidney, which are more glycolytic tissues. In general, mitochondrial extracts have lower DNA glycosylase activity than nuclear extracts. There was no correlation between glycosylase activities in the mitochondrial extracts and COX activity, suggesting that DNA repair enzymes may be regulated by a mechanism different from this mitochondrial enzyme.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2002-12-07", "authors": ["BensuKarahalil", "Barbara AHogue", "Nadja Cde Souza-Pinto", "Vilhelm ABohr"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.02-0463com"}

It concludes that angiotensin II generation in the heart depends on circulating (ie, kidney-derived) renin, and occurs in interstitial fluid and possibly, in view of the recent discovery of renin-binding sites, on the cell surface of cardiac cells.

The ZNF382 gene has a predicted 548-amino acid open reading frame, encoding a putative 64kDa zinc-finger protein. The N-terminus of the ZNF382 coding region has a well-conserved Kr\u00fcpple-associated box domain that consists of KRAB boxes A and B, whereas the C-terminus contains a Kr\u00fcpple-type zinc-finger domain possessing nine C(2)H(2) zinc-finger motifs in tandem arrays. The ZNF382 gene is mapped to chromosome 19q13.13. Northern blot analysis indicates that a 2.9-kb transcript specific for ZNF382 is expressed at very early embryonic stage of human (at least earlier than gestation 34 day) and widely in human embryo tissues.

In isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of H11 kinase resulted in a 37% increase in protein/DNA ratio, reflecting hypertrophy. A cardiac-specific transgene driven by the alphaMHC-promoter was generated, which resulted in an average 7-fold increase in H11 kinase protein expression. Transgenic hearts were characterized by a 30% increase of the heart weight/body weight ratio, by the reexpression of a fetal gene program, and by concentric hypertrophy with preserved contractile function at echocardiography.

Time-dependent expressions of chymase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genes and their enzymes activities, and Ang II levels were measured in the hamster heart at 3 days, and at 4 and 8 weeks after pressure overload. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by an operation to constrict the abdominal aorta. Compared to the sham-operated group, the cardiomyocyte diameters of hamster hearts at 3 days after overload underwent no obvious changes, while those at 4 and 8 weeks after overload increased markedly (p<0.01), and both transcriptional expressions of chymase and ACE genes gradually increased in the hamster hearts at 3 days, and at 4 and 8 weeks after overload, but the transcriptional expressions of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene gradually decreased.

The results suggested that the increase in Ang II levels via the dual pathway of Ang II formation by chymase and ACE plays an important role in the cardiac hypertrophy of hamsters caused by the overloaded state.

Superthreshold delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) formed after pacing. Coupling contributions were then examined using: (i) a single phase 1b myocyte connected via a variable resistance to a single normal myocyte, and (ii) a multicellular fiber with a 1-cm segment of phase 1b myocytes connected to a 1-cm normal segment having resistance changes that were confined to the ischemic segment. Integration of ionic, capacitive and coupling currents during DAD initiation allowed charge quantification.\nIn cell pairs, phase 1b myocyte DADs were suppressed at resistances where normal myocyte pacing resulted in phase 1b myocyte excitation. Coupling charge requirements limited capacitive charging in the phase 1b myocyte, which occurred in combination with diastolic hyperpolarization that shifted transmembrane potential from threshold. In multicellular fiber simulations, DADs were suppressed with strong coupling in the phase 1b segment. Moderate uncoupling of that segment allowed superthreshold DAD formation away from the border that initiated action potential propagation in the normal segment. With severe uncoupling, propagation failed at the border.\nThese findings support the clinical and experimental observation that intermediate uncoupling is an important contributor to phase 1b arrhythmogenesis.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2002-11-26", "authors": ["Andrew EPollard", "Wayne ECascio", "Vladimir GFast", "Stephen BKnisley"], "doi": "10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00598-9"}

The plasma histamine concentration was elevated shortly after LPS, remaining elevated (a 50-fold increase) over the experimental period of 6 h. The sustained increase in plasma histamine was associated with a time-dependent increase in expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) in different tissues including atrium, as determined by Western blot analysis. The H(1)-receptor antagonist diphenhydramine significantly shortened the duration of the initial hypotension and the H(2)-receptor antagonist ranitidine greatly suppressed the lasting tachycardia following LPS injection. Northern blot analysis showed that LPS dramatically induced gene expressions of histamine H(1)- and H(2)-receptors in cardiac tissues. In right atrium isolated from the septic animal, the positive chronotropic effect of histamine was significantly diminished. This was possibly due to a marked reduction in G(s)(alpha) protein expression, indicating the impaired H(2)-receptor cellular signaling.

Organ-specificity, cross-reactivity between microbial agents and cardiac tissue, and induction of tolerance to self-antigen are issues still at stake.

An additional presynaptic involvement in sympathetic neurotransmission of imidazolines, via I1-R independent of alpha2-AR, is still controversial and remains to be clarified in the heart. Concentration response curves on endogenous norepinephrine (NE) overflow evoked by stimulation of epicardial postganglionic sympathetic nerves in isolated buffer-perfused rat hearts were performed for brimonidine, moxonidine, rauwolscine, 2-endo-amino-3-exo-isopropylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (AGN192403), and efaroxan. To unmask an I1-R-mediated effect of moxonidine, hearts were pre-exposed in additional experiments with brimonidine or rauwolscine with or without AGN192403 or efaroxan, respectively. Moxonidine reduced stimulated NE overflow (log EC50: -6.15 +/- 0.14). AGN192403, a selective ligand at I1-R, had no influence on the dose-response curve of moxonidine (log EC50: -6.01 +/- 0.25).

Conversely, moxonidine was without modulating efficacy under alpha2-AR-blockade by rauwolscine. In summary, we demonstrate that moxonidine reduces NE release independently of I1-R, demonstrating the prominent effect of alpha2-AR in cardiac tissue under basal conditions.

It is present in a high concentration in the adrenal medula but occurs in many other tissues throughout the body. In the brain stem and retina PNMT is present in specific neurons. Cardiac PNMT develops early in the fetal heart and is found in relatively high levels in the adult left atrium. Intrinsic cardiac adrenergic cells are distributed throughout the adult myocardium and contain all the enzymes necessary for E synthesis. The PNMT gene promoter region contains a glucocorticoid response element; however, the initial development of brain and cardiac fetal PNMT is glucocorticoid independent. Rat fetal heart PNMT peaks at embryonic day 11 and becomes sensitive to glucocorticoid induction by day 12. PNMT-containing cells are concentrated in the atrioventricular canal and interventricular septum during cardiac development, areas important in the development of the cardiac conduction system. In the adult rat, cardiac PNMT is inducible by glucocorticoids and synthesizes E. Glucocorticoids are essential for development of the high levels of PNMT in the adrenal, but are less important outside the adrenal. The PNMT gene contains 3 exons and 2 introns. Adrenal PNMT mRNA exists as a single type, but in the heart PNMT mRNA is present as both an intronless and an intron-containing type. In some cardiac tissues, glucocorticoids decrease levels of intron-containing PNMT mRNA and increase intronless PNMT mRNA and PNMT activity.

{"title": "Effects of fasting and hypoxic preconditioning on the hypoxic-reoxygenated ventricular strips of the rat heart.", "abstract": "The investigation aimed to assess the effects of hypoxic preconditioning in right ventricle strips of fed and 24-h fasted rats, which display a fast fatty acid catabolism, and to ascertain whether these effects are associated with changes in the tissue levels of long-chain acylCoA and acyl carnitine and glycolytic activity. Strips were mounted isometrically in Krebs-bicarbonate solution with 10 mM dextrose and paced at 1 Hz. Strips were exposed to 30 min hypoxia and 60 min reoxygenation with or without a previous preconditioning cycle of 5 min hypoxia followed by a 10 min reoxygenation. During hypoxia the fasted rat strips underwent a greater contracture with respect to the fed group. Preconditioning reduced the contracture strength and accelerated the post-hypoxic recovery only in the fasted rat strips. Hypoxia evoked an increase in the acylCoA and acyl carnitine tissue-contents of the strips which reached higher levels in the fasted than in the fed rat groups. Preconditioning had no effects on the content of these metabolites. During hypoxia lactate output was lower in the fasted than in the fed rat strips and preconditioning abolished this decrease. These data suggest that the protective effects of hypoxic preconditioning occur in the heart tissue predisposed to the oxidation of fatty acid and can not be ascribed to changes in the accumulation of acylCoA and acyl carnitine but could be due, at least in part, to an activation of glycolysis.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2002-11-19", "authors": ["SCerruti", "GTestoni", "VDalamon", "PKade", "AVarela", "E ASavino"], "doi": "10.1007/BF03179844"}

In the presence of bicarbonate, the change in pHi was blunted due to a compensatory activation of acid loading pHi regulatory mechanisms. The enhancement of NHE activity disappeared after 1 week of the inhibitor withdrawal. The kinetic analysis of H+ fluxes after an acid load revealed an increased net H+ efflux (JH+) at any given pHi value and an alkaline shift of the apparent \"set-point\" of the exchanger (from 7.11+/-0.02 to 7.38+/-0.04,P <0.05) in treated rats. In the presence of the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, the \"set-point\" of the exchanger was normalized in the cariporide-treated rats while JH+ at acidic pHi values persisted elevated. Cardiac NHE-1 mRNA levels and protein expression were increased in cariporide-treated rats. In addition to the increased protein expression after the treatment, the normalization of the augmented \"set-point\" by chelerythrine suggests an increased turnover rate of the units through a PKC dependent pathway. These data demonstrate that long-term treatment with the NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide enhances the antiporter activity in cardiac tissue through an increase of the number and turnover of functional units. This finding deserves further experimental and clinical evaluations to consider whether it would be advisable a gradual withdrawal of prolonged NHE inhibition to avoid an enhanced response when the exchanger is stimulated.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2002-11-15", "authors": ["Mar\u00eda CCamili\u00f3n de Hurtado", "Irene LEnnis", "N\u00e9stor GP\u00e9rez", "Gladys EChiappe de Cingolani", "PatricioMorgan", "Horacio ECingolani"], "doi": "10.1006/jmcc.2002.2107"}
{"title": "Prorenin uptake in the heart: a prerequisite for local angiotensin generation?", "abstract": "Interference with locally generated angiotensin II most likely underlies the beneficial effects of renin-angiotensin system blockers in cardiac disorders. Since renin is not synthesized in the heart, this enzyme must be sequestered from the circulation in order to allow angiotensin generation at cardiac tissue sites. This review addresses the various ways through which circulating (i.e., kidney-derived) renin may reach cardiac tissue sites, considering in particular the possibility that prorenin, the inactive precursor of renin, is involved in cardiac angiotensin generation, as the plasma concentrations of prorenin are tenfold higher than those of renin. Renin and prorenin diffuse into the cardiac interstitial space and bind to cardiac (pro)renin receptors/renin-binding proteins. One of these receptors is the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor. This receptor not only binds mannose 6-phosphate-containing ligands like renin and prorenin, it also internalizes these enzymes, and activates prorenin intracellularly. This process possibly represents (pro)renin clearance, since intracellular angiotensin generation could not be demonstrated following (pro)renin uptake by cardiomyocytes. Angiotensin II-mediated myocyte proliferation did occur when incubating cardiomyocytes with prorenin plus angiotensionogen. The effects of prorenin plus angiotensinogen were comparable to those of 100nmol/l angiotensin II, although the angiotensin II levels in the medium during exposure of the cells to prorenin plus angiotensinogen were <1nmol/l. This suggests that cardiac angiotensin II generation by circulating renin occurs predominantly on the cell surface. The presence of ACE and/or renin on the cell membrane, in the microenvironment of angiotensin receptors, would allow maximal efficiency of local angiotensin II generation, i.e., immediate binding of angiotensin II to its receptors with minimal loss into the extracellular space.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2002-11-15", "authors": ["A HJan Danser", "Jasper JSaris"], "doi": "10.1006/jmcc.2002.2078"}

RhoBTB proteins are characterized by a modular organization, consisting of a GTPase (guanosine triphosphatase) domain, a proline rich region, a tandem of two BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric \u00e0 brac) domains and a C-terminal region of unknown function and might act as docking points for multiple components participating in signal transduction cascades. We have determined the genomic organization and the expression pattern of the three RHOBTB genes of human and mouse. The exon-intron organization of each gene is conserved in three vertebrate species (human, mouse and Fugu). RHOBTB1 and RHOBTB2 have a similar exon-intron organization and are closely related to the single gene encoding the RhoBTB orthologs of two insect species. By contrast, the exon-intron organization of RHOBTB3 differed substantially from that of the two other genes, indicating that this gene arose by a duplication event independent of the one that gave rise to RHOBTB1 and RHOBTB2. RHOBTB1 (located on chromosome 10) and RHOBTB3 (located on chromosome 5) appear ubiquitously expressed. However, they display a differential pattern of expression: RHOBTB1 showed high levels in stomach, skeletal muscle, placenta, kidney and testis, whereas RHOBTB3 was highly expressed in neural and cardiac tissues, pancreas, placenta and testis. RHOBTB2 (located on chromosome 8) showed much lower levels of expression than the other two human RHOBTB genes and it was most abundant in neural tissues. The expression patterns of the human and mouse genes were roughly comparable. All three genes were also detected in fetal tissues, and in a number of cell lines RHOBTB3 predominates.

We cloned Drosophila hand and studied the embryonic expression in detail by using various tissue-specific markers that allowed us to analyze the identity of hand-expressing cells. We found hand to be expressed in the entire heart, including all cardioblasts and pericardial cells, in the progenitors of the circular visceral muscles, the lymph gland and garland cells, and in a few cells in the CNS. The expression of Drosophila hand starts after the inductive activity of the early regulators in these tissues, e.g. Tinman and Bagpipe, suggesting a role of Hand in differentiation rather than in tissue determination. In many aspects the expression pattern of Drosophila hand resembles the patterns of its vertebrates orthologues, for instance in cardiac tissues.

Sphingolipids have been recognized as mediators of intracellular calcium release through their actions on a calcium channel, sphingolipid calcium release-mediating protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (SCaMPER). The current study investigates the expression and function of SCaMPER in cardiomyocytes. Northern analyses and RT-PCR cloning and sequencing revealed SCaMPER expression in both human and rat cardiac tissue. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses demonstrated that SCaMPER is abundant in cardiac tissue and is localized to the sarcotubular junction. This was confirmed by the colocalization of SCaMPER with dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors by confocal microscopy. Purified T tubules were shown to contain SCaMPER and immunoelectron micrographs suggested that SCaMPER is located to the junctional T tubules, but a junctional SR localization cannot be ruled out. The sphingolipid ligand for SCaMPER, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), initiated calcium release from the cardiomyocyte SR. Importantly, antisense knockdown of SCaMPER mRNA produced a substantial reduction of sphingolipid-induced calcium release, suggesting that SCaMPER is a potentially important calcium channel of cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

For this purpose, we modified a previously published method to include treatment with Raney Nickel, which specifically cleaves thioether linkages.

Hearts perfused under normoxia contained small amounts of protein-bound 4-hydroxynonenal and 1,4-dihydroxynonene (1.38 +/- 0.29 and 2.69 +/- 0.17 nmol/g wet weight, respectively). The accumulation of these adducts after global ischemia depended on the severity of the ischemic insult up to a plateau and was not exacerbated by reperfusion. In conclusion, our method allows the quantification of time-dependent changes in 4-hydroxynonenal and 1,4-dihydroxynonene bound to proteins via thioether linkage in ischemic/reperfused heart tissues.

Cardioplegic perfusion was performed with HTK (Custodiol) without or with heptanol, in order to produce electrical cell uncoupling via the closure of gap junctions. To analyse epsilon (omega), we present two heart models which consider cell shape, electrical cell coupling, and dielectric polarisation of cell membranes and membranes of intracellular structures.\nepsilon (omega) of heart tissue shows an alpha-, beta-, and gamma-dispersion. epsilon (omega) remains unchanged during cardioplegic perfusion with HTK, but if heptanol is added, there is an immediate decrease in the region of alpha-dispersion and an increase in the low frequency part of beta-dispersion. Similar changes are observed during ischemia following HTK perfusion without heptanol; additionally, the beta-dispersion shifts to higher frequencies. Using our models, we obtain analogue changes of epsilon (omega) by fitting model parameters which describe water content, water distribution, extra- and intracellular conductivity, and gap junction resistance.\nChanges of these tissue properties as calculated by our models based on the measurement of epsilon (omega) are consistent with intraischemic changes of heart tissue known from immunohistochemical, biochemical, and histological investigations.

The ADR-induced long-term cardiac subcellular pathology included loss, disruption and disassembly of myofibrils, and mitochondrial swelling and condensation. On the other hand, the ADR-induced subcellular hepatic alterations consisted of polymorphic mitochondria, cytoplasmic vacuolization and accumulation of lipid droplets. Apparently, cardiac tissue was more affected by ADR toxic aggression than hepatic tissue.

Evidence of ET-1 production has been documented in fetal heart tissue where it exerts growth-enhancing and mitogenic effects. ET-1 also has a potent positive inotrope action on cardiac muscle. ET-1 -/- homozygous mice display a wide variety of cardiac anomalies, which also are features of the human and of the experimental CDH. Autopsy reports have shown that total heart weight is reduced significantly in the presence of CDH, and animal models have documented the presence of cardiac hypoplasia associated with CDH. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that prenatal exposure to corticosteroids improves cardiovascular function in the immediate newborn period. The aim of this study was to determine cardiac gene expression of ET-1 and of its receptor ET(A) and the cardiac ET-1 content in the heart of nitrofen-induced CDH in rats and to evaluate the effect of antenatal Dexamethasone (Dex) treatment.\nA CDH model was induced in pregnant rats after administration of 100 mg of nitrofen on day 9.5 of gestation (term, 22 days).

The full-length coding sequence of rat Elf3 was isolated with 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and degenerative primers, and its expression was determined in various rat tissues, by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. A polyclonal ELF3 antibody produced from a C-terminal peptide was used to observe the distribution of the transcription factor within the retina. To assess the possible ELF3 regulation of the TIMP3 promoter, transient transfection assays were performed. Promoter activity was determined with a firefly luciferase reporter gene construct.\nThe epithelium-specific ETS transcription factor ELF3 was expressed in the D407 and hTERT-RPE1 cell lines. Neither ESE3 nor ELF5 was detected in the RPE. The cloning of rat Elf3 produced two splice variants, designated Elf3a (1786 bp) and Elf3b (1855 bp). The larger form, Elf3b, contained a 69-bp insert in the coding sequence, which showed high homology to a similar insert previously identified in murine Elf3. Both splice variants were expressed in rat lung, kidney, liver, and retina, but were absent in heart tissue. Real-time PCR analysis showed the retina to contain high levels of Elf3, which was subsequently localized to the RPE. Elf3 upregulated the TIMP3 promoter, with Elf3a and -3b inducing an approximate sixfold increase in activity.\nThe ELF3 transcription factor is highly expressed in the RPE and can regulate important ocular genes, such as TIMP3, in vitro.

The incidence and prevalence of this disease is rare in some parts of the world and more common in others. The purpose of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of the factors that have been entertained which may contribute to the pathogenesis of PPCM with special emphasis on more recent data from our laboratory that provide support to the view that this disease is an autoimmune disease with multiple contributing factors and effector mechanisms. This is supported by the fact that sera from PPCM patients contain high titers of auto-antibodies against normal human cardiac tissue proteins of 37, 33, and 25 kD that was not present in the sera of patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (IDCM), indicating for the first time that PPCM is distinct from IDCM. In addition to the autoantibodies, the PBMC's from PPCM patients demonstrate a heightened level of fetal microchimerism, an abnormal cytokine profile, decreased levels of CD4+ CD25lo regulatory T cells, and a significant reduction in the plasma levels of progesterone, estradiol and relaxin in PPCM patients as compared with other normal pregnant non-PPCM patients. A potential role for reduced plasma levels of selenium in the pathogenesis of select PPCM patients was also noted. These findings for the first time suggest that such abnormalities may in concert lead to the initiation and perpetuation of an autoimmune process, which leads to cardiac failure and disease.

However, little is known regarding the nature of the antigen(s) involved in this immune process. We demonstrated that cardiac transplantation in mice induces an autoimmune T-cell response to a heart tissue-specific protein, cardiac myosin (CM). This response contributes to transplant rejection in that its modulation affects cardiac graft survival. This study investigates whether anti-CM T cells undergo activation and expansion in mice with chronic cardiac allograft rejection.\nThe frequency of CM- and donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing T cells were assessed by ELISPOT in BALB/c mice, which were injected with anti-CD40L (MR1) mAb (chronic rejection group) or CTLA4Ig fusion protein (tolerant group) and transplanted with C57BL/6 cardiac allografts.\nMR1-treated BALB/c recipients of C57BL/6 hearts with chronic rejection displayed a high frequency of activated CM-specific T cells, whereas the frequency of activated alloreactive T cells were similar to na\u00efve, nontransplanted mice. In contrast, no activation of CM-reactive T cells was detected in tolerant recipients after CTLA4Ig treatment. Therefore, in the absence of alloimmunity, chronic rejection is associated with persistence of a T-cell response against CM.

Northern blot analysis confirmed that all of these genes are expressed in the human heart. The results of RAP-PCR were reconfirmed by quantitative RT-PCR in TOF and control heart samples. Both techniques showed the levels of expression of hCALO, NP79 and SUN2 to be comparable in TOF and control samples and the level of expression of dystrophin and titin, both coding for cytoskeletal proteins, to be significantly upregulated in TOF samples. In summary, we have shown that the RAP-PCR technique is useful in the identification of differentially expressed gene from biopsy samples of human CHD tissues. In this manner, we have identified three novel genes implicated in the normal function of the human heart and two known genes upregulated in TOF samples.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2002-10-24", "authors": ["GuifengSun", "SiuYuen Chan", "YihuaYuan", "KinWang Chan", "GuangrongQiu", "KailaiSun", "MauricePing Leung"], "doi": "10.1016/s0925-4439(02)00171-0"}
{"title": "Myocardin: a component of a molecular switch for smooth muscle differentiation.", "abstract": "A hallmark of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in culture and the injured vessel wall is their phenotypic modulation from a differentiated state to one of heightened growth, migration, and matrix synthesis. The transcriptional mechanisms underlying this altered genetic program have yet to be elucidated. Serum response factor (SRF) has emerged as a critical regulator of SMC-restricted gene expression via its interaction with proximal CArG elements; however, levels of SRF protein do not change during SMC phenotypic modulation, suggesting a role for other factors or events in this process. One such factor could be myocardin, a novel SRF coactivator recently cloned from cardiac tissue. Levels of myocardin are abundantly expressed in rat aortic media along with key SMC-restricted genes. In several SMC lines, myocardin mRNA levels decrease in parallel with the loss or attenuation of SMC marker expression. Transient transfection experiments with CMV-driven myocardin in both SMC and non-SMC reveal CArG-dependent transactivation of the SM-Calp promoter-enhancer. Several additional CArG-dependent SMC promoters show variable activation in a cell-and promoter-context dependent manner. To determine whether myocardin could activate an endogenous program of SMC differentiation, we stably transfected L6 myoblasts and assessed SMC marker expression and growth. Results reveal the expression of several SMC markers concomitant with a lower growth potential. Collectively, these studies suggest that myocardin is an important component of a molecular switch for the SMC differentiation program.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2002-10-24", "authors": ["JiyuanChen", "Chad MKitchen", "Jeffrey WStreb", "Joseph MMiano"], "doi": "10.1006/jmcc.2002.2086"}

We have combined the chemical sensitivity of spectroscopy with the spatial sensitivity of imaging to generate maps of regional cardiac oxygenation. Spectroscopic images were acquired for isolated, arrested, blood-perfused porcine hearts (n=4) over the wavelength range 650 and 1050 nm. Spectroscopic images were acquired during normal perfusion, regional ischemia (occlusion of left anterior descending artery) global ischemia, and reperfusion. Hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) content and oxygenation were determined by reconstructing the tissue spectra measured at each pixel as weighted sums of water, oxy- and deoxy-Hb (and -Mb) absorptivity spectra. The spectroscopic images acquired during regional ischemia clearly revealed increased deoxy-(Hb+Mb) levels and decreased oxy-(Hb+Mb) levels in the ischaemic regions relative to the normally-perfused regions. Global ischemia produced a dramatic decrease in oxy-(Hb+Mb) levels and a moderate increase in deoxy-(Hb+Mb).

In this paper, we studied the effects of gradients of electrophysiological heterogeneity on reentrant excitation patterns using computer simulations. We investigated the dynamics of spiral waves in a two-dimensional sheet of cardiac tissue described by the Luo-Rudy phase 1 (LR1) ventricular action potential model. A gradient of action potential duration (APD) was imposed by gradually varying the local current density of K(+) current or inward rectifying K(+) current along one axis of the tissue sheet. We show that a gradient of APD resulted in spiral wave drift. This drift consisted of two components. The longitudinal (along the gradient) component was always directed toward regions of longer spiral wave period. The transverse (perpendicular to the gradient) component had a direction dependent on the direction of rotation of the spiral wave. We estimated the velocity of the drift as a function of the magnitude of the gradient and discuss its implications.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Interestingly, we now report that the hearts of Cav-1 null mice are markedly abnormal, despite the fact that caveolin-1 is not expressed in cardiac myocytes. However, caveolin-1 is abundantly expressed in the nonmyocytic cells of the heart, i.e., cardiac fibroblasts and endothelia. Quantitative imaging studies of Cav-1 null hearts demonstrate a significantly enlarged right ventricular cavity and a thickened left ventricular wall with decreased systolic function. Histological analysis reveals myocyte hypertrophy with interstitial/perivascular fibrosis. Because caveolin-1 is thought to act as a negative regulator of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade, we performed Western blot analysis with phospho-specific antibodies that only recognize activated ERK1/2. As predicted, the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade is hyperactivated in Cav-1 null heart tissue (i.e., interstitial fibrotic lesions) and isolated cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels are dramatically upregulated.

{"title": "Induction and patterning of the cardiac conduction system.", "abstract": "The cardiac conduction system (CCS) is the component of the heart that initiates and maintains a rhythmic heartbeat. As the embryonic heart forms, the CCS must continue to develop and mature in a coordinated manner to ensure that proper pace making potential and distribution of action potential is maintained at all stages. This requires not only the formation of distinct and disparate components of the CCS, but the integration of these components into a functioning whole as the heart matures. Though research in this area of development may have lagged behind other areas of heart development, in recent years there has been much progress in understanding the ontogeny of the CCS and the developmental cues that drive its formation. This is largely due to studies on the avian heart as well as the use of molecular biology approaches. This review gives a perspective on advances in understanding the development of the vertebrate CCS, and reports new data illuminating the mechanism of conduction cell determination and maintenance in the mammalian heart. As much of our knowledge about the development of the CCS has been derived from the chick embryo, one important area facing the field is the relationship and similarities between the structure and development of avian and mammalian conduction systems. Specifically, the morphology of the distal elements of the mammalian CCS and the manner in which its components are recruited from working cardiomyocytes are areas of research that will, hopefully, receive more attention in the near future. A more general and outstanding question is how the disparate components of all vertebrate conduction systems integrate into a functional entity during embryogenesis. There is mounting evidence linking the patterning and formation of the CCS to instructive cues derived from the cardiac vasculature and, more specifically, to hemodynamic-responsive factors produced by cardiac endothelia. This highlights the need for a greater understanding of the biophysical forces acting on, and created by, the cardiovascular system during embryonic development.

The NaOH/ultrasonication treatment of cardiac tissues resulted in the digestion of connective tissue and separation of intercellular junctions. Auricular and ventricular working cardiac myocytes were quasi-cylindrical in shape, bifurcated, and connected end-to-end at the intercalated discs. The intercalated discs in the working cardiac myocytes showed a stair-like profile, consisting of steps (plicate segments) and corresponding risers (interplicate segments). The ventricular myocytes, in particular, had many steps and risers. The plicate segments were filled with numerous finger-like microprojections. The strands of the myocytes in the sinoatrial node were oriented linearly, while those in the atrioventricular node formed a reticular network. The intercalated discs in both nodal cells were underdeveloped, having few microprojections. Myocytes in the atrioventricular bundle (His) and the right limb were arranged in parallel, and were characterized by the presence of slender branches. Purkinje cell strands formed reticular networks. The intercalated discs in the His-Purkinje system were irregular in appearance, and the microprojections were larger in size and smaller in number than those of working myocytes. The myocytes in the crista terminalis and surrounding the fossa ovalis resembled cells in the His-Purkinje system rather than auricular working myocytes in morphology, and may act as the internodal pathway.

Surface cell adhesion molecules, essential to morphogenesis and maintenance of adult tissue architecture, are likely to be involved, but little is known about cell adhesion molecules expressed on SMCs. T-cadherin is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored member of the cadherin superfamily of adhesion molecules. Although highly expressed in vascular and cardiac tissues, its function in these tissues is unknown. We previously reported increased expression of T-cadherin in intimal SMCs in atherosclerotic lesions and proposed a role for T-cadherin in phenotype control. Here we performed immunohistochemical analysis of spatial and temporal changes in vascular T-cadherin expression following balloon catheterisation of the rat carotid artery. T-cadherin expression in SMCs markedly increases in the media early (1-4 days) after injury, and later (day 7-28) in forming neointima, especially in its preluminal area. Staining for monocyte/macrophage antigen ED-1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and smooth muscle alpha-actin revealed that spatial and temporal changes in T-cadherin level coincided with the peak in cell migration and proliferation activity during neointima formation.

A phase singularity is defined as a spatial point where the surrounding phase values changes by a total of 2 pi, thereby forming the organizing center for a reentrant excitatory wave, a phenomenon which occurs in cardiac fibrillation. In this paper, we describe a methodology to detect the singular filament in numeric simulations of three-dimensional (3-D) scroll waves by using the concept of topological charge. Here, we use simple two-variable models of cardiac activity to construct the state space, generate the phase field, and calculate the topological charge as a summation of 3-D convolution operations. We illustrate the usage of the algorithm on the basic dynamics of vortex ring filament behavior as well as the more complex spatiotemporal behavior observed in fibrillation. We also compare the motion of filament wavetips as determined by the phase field produced by two-variable state space and single-variable, time-delay embedded state space. Finally, we examine the state spaces produced by a more complex three-variable model.

Previously, we have described a decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity in both aortic endothelium and cardiac tissue, and an increased proliferation of aortic primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (pC-VSMCs), obtained from fructose-fed rats (FFR), an experimental model of syndrome X. Because the participation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in this model is still unclear, the present study examined the effect of chronic administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (E) on pC-VSMCs proliferation and eNOS activity in a conduit artery (aorta) and in resistance vessels (mesenteric vascular bed) from fructose-fed rats. Male Wistar rats were used: Control, FFR, Control + E, and FFR + E (n = 8 in each group). After 8 weeks, tissue samples were obtained and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) proliferative effect was examined in pC-SMCs of aortic and mesenteric arteries by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. The eNOS activity was estimated in endothelial lining from both origins by conversion of [(3)H]arginine into [(3)H]citrulline. The FFR aortic and mesenteric pC-VSMCs showed a significantly increased 10% FCS-induced [(3)H]thymidine incorporation compared to controls. The FFR aortic and mesenteric endothelium eNOS activity was significantly decreased. Chronic treatment with E abolished the increased proliferation and restored eNOS activity. These data confirm that changes in VSMCs proliferation and endothelial dysfunction at different levels of the vascular system are involved in syndrome X, and that the inhibition of angiotensin II production can revert those changes, suggesting an important role for RAS and possibly kinins, in the physiopathologic mechanism of this model of syndrome X.", "journal": "American journal of hypertension", "date": "2002-10-10", "authors": ["RobertoMiatello", "NormaRisler", "SusanaGonzalez", "ClaudiaCastro", "MarielR\u00fcttler", "MontserratCruzado"], "doi": "10.1016/s0895-7061(02)02983-7"}

The autopsy revealed a lethal rupture of the right heart ventricle. The insurance company argued that driving on the wrong side was an act of gross negligence so that the damage was not covered by the full comprehensive insurance. Surprisingly, the microscopic examination of the myocardium performed by a clinical pathologist brought to light a severe myofibrillar degeneration (MFD) which was interpreted as diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction. It was supposed that this could have caused an incapacity of the driver to control his car, which in turn would commit the insurance to payment. A critical re-evaluation of the heart tissue material, however, revealed the pattern of trauma-induced hypercontraction banding of the myocardium along the cleft edges but no findings suggestive of myocardial infarction. Thus, the accident was not the result of a cardiac attack. But there was a severe preexisting pathology including cardiac hypertrophy, scarring of the myocardium, siderophages of the lungs, and an infarction of the pons, so that a cerebral dysfunction was the most plausible explanation for the accident. Thus, gross negligence had to be denied, and the insurance company was obliged to pay. This observation points to the existence of two different variants of MFD: Clinical pathologists are familiar with \"tyical\" MFD occurring in reperfusion after ischemia, in catecholamine toxicity, and around infarct necroses.

We isolated transcripts differentially expressed during metamorphosis in the ascidian Boltenia villosa by suppressive PCR subtractions of staged larval and juvenile cDNAs. We employed a series of three subtractions to dissect gene expression during metamorphosis. We have isolated 132 different protein coding sequences, and 65 of these transcripts show significant matches to GenBank proteins. Some of these genes have putative functions relevant to key metamorphic events including the differentiation of smooth muscle, blood cells, heart tissue and adult nervous system from larval rudiments. In addition, a significant fraction of the differentially expressed transcripts match identified genes from the innate immune system. Innate immunity confers a rapid response to pathogen-specific molecules and/or compromised self-tissues. The activation of innate immunity genes during metamorphosis may represent the programmed maturation of the adult immune system. In addition, this immune response may be necessary for phagocytosis and re-structuring of larval tissues. An innate immune-related inflammatory response may also underlie two waves of trans-epidermal blood cell migration that occur during the swimming larval period and immediately upon settlement. We characterized these trans-epidermal migrations and discovered that some migratory cells leave the animal entirely through an anterior tunnel in the tunic.

The whole event was faster with Fraction-I and was observed up to 3 weeks. At this time point clusters of troponin-T positive cells were found scattered through the collagen matrices. Additionally, TEM revealed healthy layers of connected cardiomyocytes with intercalated discs, in this case on and in between the collagen fibres. These findings provide evidence that in unison contracting structurally organized cell-matrix cardiac constructs can be engineered by use of co-cultures (neonatal cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts) and collagen matrices, which is very promising for the repair of larger scar areas of the myocardium.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2002-10-04", "authors": ["M J Avan Luyn", "R ATio", "X JGallego y van Seijen", "J APlantinga", "L F M Hde Leij", "M J LDeJongste", "P Bvan Wachem"], "doi": "10.1016/s0142-9612(02)00230-2"}

The chymase mRNA levels in the heart and other tissues were assessed by competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of collagen I/III genes was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. Chymase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activities, and angiotensin II (Ang II) content in the heart were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in protein and activity levels were measured by Western blot and zymogram, respectively.\nA model of transgenic mice with selective overexpression of a rat myosin light chain 2 promoter-human heart chymase (MLC(2-)-hChymase) fusion gene was produced. In MLC(2)-hChymase transgenic mice (the F(6) line), the human heart chymase gene was expressed at a high level in heart and at lower levels in skeletal muscle and kidney, while no expression was detected in the liver or lung. The heart chymase activity increased markedly in the F(6) transgenic mice versus non-transgenic mice (0.274 +/- 0.071 U/mg versus 0.152 +/- 0.021 U/mg) ( P < 0.05), with no difference in ACE activity. Heart Ang II level in the F(6) transgenic mice increased nearly threefold (1984 +/- 184 versus 568 +/- 88 pg/g protein) ( P < 0.05) but was unchanged in plasma. MMP-9 activity increased significantly in the cardiac tissue of F(6) transgenic mice ( P < 0.05), while both collagen I and the ratio of collagen I : III mRNA levels decreased significantly (both P < 0.05). The F(6) transgenic mice showed no significant changes in cardiac parameters.\nWe have demonstrated selective overexpression of human chymase gene in the heart of transgenic mice, and the results support the hypothesis of a dual Ang II-forming pathway from chymase and ACE in the cardiac tissue in vivo.

We hypothesize that survival and functional and electrical integration of grafts may be improved by engineering cardiac tissue constructs in vitro before grafting.\nEngineered heart tissue (EHT) was reconstituted by mixing cardiac myocytes from neonatal Fischer 344 rats with liquid collagen type I, matrigel, and serum-containing culture medium. EHTs were designed in circular shape (inner/outer diameter: 8/10 mm; thickness: 1 mm) to fit around the circumference of hearts from syngenic rats. After 12 days in culture and before implantation on uninjured hearts, contractile function of EHT was measured under isometric conditions. Baseline twitch tension amounted to 0.34+/-0.03 mN (n=33) and was stimulated by Ca(2+) and isoprenaline to 200+/-12 and 185+/-10% of baseline values, respectively. Despite utilization of a syngenic model immunosuppression (mg/kg BW: azathioprine 2, cyclosporine A 5, methylprednisolone 2) was necessary for EHT survival in vivo.

Fourteen days after implantation, EHTs were heavily vascularized and retained a well organized heart muscle structure as indicated by immunolabeling of actinin, connexin 43, and cadherins. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that implanted EHTs surpassed the degree of differentiation reached before implantation.

The enzyme complex in vitro is known to exist as a mixture of active (A) and de-active (D) forms [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1364 (1998) 169]. Studies are reported here examining the effect of anoxia and reperfusion on the A/D-equilibrium of complex I in rat hearts ex vivo.

Either 30 min of nitrogen perfusion or global ischemia decreases the portion of active form of complex I to 40+/-2%. Upon re-oxygenation of cardiac tissue, complex I is converted back predominantly to the active form (80-85%).

The protective effects of C and F were investigated in perfused guinea-pig Langendorff hearts subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. Changes in cellular levels of high phosphorous energy, NO and Ca2+ in the heart together with simultaneous recordings of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) were monitored by an nitric oxide (NO) electrode, fluorometry and 31P-NMR. The rate of recovery of LVDP from ischemia by reperfusion was 30.8% in the control, while in the presence of C or F a gradual increase to 63.2 or 61.0% was observed. Changes of transient NO signals (TNO) released from heart tissue in one contraction (LVDP) were observed to be upside-down with respect to transient fura-2-Ca2+ signals (TCa) and transient O2 signals detected with a pO2 electrode. At the final stage of ischemia, the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and the release of NO increased with no twitching and remained at a high steady level. The addition of C increased the NO level at the end of ischemia compared with the control, but [Ca2+]i during ischemia decreased. On reperfusion, the increased diastolic level of TCa and TNO returned rapidly to the control level with the recovery of LVDP. By in vitro EPR, C and F were found to directly quench the activity of active radicals.

{"title": "Metabolic syndrome in the rat: females are protected against the pro-oxidant effect of a high sucrose diet.", "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is more prevalent in men than in women. In an experimental dietary model of metabolic syndrome, the high-fructose-fed rat, oxidative stress has been observed in males. Given that estradiol has been documented to exert an antioxidant effect, we investigated whether female rats were better protected than males against the adverse effects of a high-sucrose diet, and we studied the influence of hormonal status in female rats. Males and females were first fed a sucrose-based or starch-based diet for 2 weeks. In the males, the plasma triglyceride (TG)-raising effect of sucrose was accompanied by significantly lowered plasma alpha-tocopherol and a significantly lowered alpha-tocopherol/TG ratio (30%), suggesting that vitamin E depletion may predispose lipoproteins to subsequent oxidative stress. In males, after exposure of heart tissue homogenate to iron-induced lipid peroxidation, thiobarbituric reactive substances were significantly higher in the sucrose-fed than in the starch-fed rats. In contrast, in sucrose-fed females, neither a decrease in vitamin E/TG ratio nor an increased susceptibility of heart tissue to peroxidation was observed, despite both a significantly decreased heart superoxide dismutase activity (14%) and a significant 3-fold increase in plasma nitric oxide concentration compared with starch-fed females. The influence of hormonal status in female rats was then assessed using intact, ovariectomized, or estradiol-supplemented ovariectomized female rats fed the sucrose or starch diet for 2 weeks. After exposure of heart tissue to iron-induced lipid peroxidation, higher susceptibility to peroxidation was found only in ovariectomized females fed the sucrose diet compared with the starch group and not in intact females or ovariectomized females supplemented with estradiol.

{"title": "KCNE5 induces time- and voltage-dependent modulation of the KCNQ1 current.", "abstract": "The function of the KCNE5 (KCNE1-like) protein has not previously been described. Here we show that KCNE5 induces both a time- and voltage-dependent modulation of the KCNQ1 current. Interaction of the KCNQ1 channel with KCNE5 shifted the voltage activation curve of KCNQ1 by more than 140 mV in the positive direction. The activation threshold of the KCNQ1+KCNE5 complex was +40 mV and the midpoint of activation was +116 mV. The KCNQ1+KCNE5 current activated slowly and deactivated rapidly as compared to the KCNQ1+KCNE1 at 22 degrees C; however, at physiological temperature, the activation time constant of the KCNQ1+KCNE5 current decreased fivefold, thus exceeding the activation rate of the KCNQ1+KCNE1 current. The KCNE5 subunit is specific for the KCNQ1 channel, as none of other members of the KCNQ-family or the human ether a-go-go related channel (hERG1) was affected by KCNE5. Four residues in the transmembrane domain of the KCNE5 protein were found to be important for the control of the voltage-dependent activation of the KCNQ1 current. We speculate that since KCNE5 is expressed in cardiac tissue it may here along with the KCNE1 beta-subunit regulate KCNQ1 channels.

{"title": "Arrhythmogenic peroxynitrite-induced alterations in mammalian heart contractility and its prevention with quercetin-filled liposomes.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of quercetin-filled phosphatidylcholine liposomes (PCLs) on peroxynitrite (ONOO-)-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Experiments were done using different experimental models, including isolated rat papillary muscle, Langendorff perfused rat hearts, and anesthetized animals. Being exogenously applied in a concentration greater than 50 microM, ONOO- caused inhibition of isometric twitch amplitude in isolated papillary muscles and led to an appearance of arrhythmias. Decomposed ONOO- had no similar effects and reversibly increased twitch amplitude. Authentic nitric oxide (NO, 100 microM) did not produce arrhythmias and had no significant effect on twitch amplitude. Verapamil and ruthenium red were with-out effect on ONOO- -induced arrhythmias, whereas tetrodotoxin and nicorandil effectively prevented arrhythmias development. Ouabain increased the arrhythmogenic effect of ONOO-. ONOO- significantly decreased coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) and mean left-ventricular pressure (MLVP) in the Langendorff perfused rat heart and produced severe arrhythmias. Authentic nitric oxide (NO) decreased CPP and MLVP insignificantly and resulted in a low incidence of arrhythmias. The NO donor SIN-1 in doses greater than 50 microM led to the appearance of low-incidence arrhythmias in anesthetized rats. Intraventricular injection of ONOO- promotes the appearance of a high incidence of arrhythmias in anesthetized rats and decreased MLVP. PCLs filled with the antioxidant quercetin restored normal cardiac contractility in both isolated tissues and anesthetizes animals. In conclusion, we hypothesized that ONOO-, but not its decomposed products, can initiate membrane lipid peroxidation and damage the phospholipid environment of ionic channels in myocardial cell plasma membranes inducing abnormal cardiac action potentials, arrhythmogenesis, and contractile dysfunction. Quercetin-filled PCL provide reliable protection against peroxynitrite-induced myocardial injury in isolated cardiac tissues and anesthetized animals primarily as a result of the decomposition of endogenously formed ONOO-.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2002-09-25", "authors": ["ASoloviev", "AStefanov", "AParshikov", "AKhromov", "AMoibenko", "LKvotchina", "GBalavoine", "YuGeletii"], "doi": "10.1385/ct:2:2:129"}

The data are presented as median and 25th-75th percentiles. Our results showed ANP concentration [ANP] of PF significantly exceeded that of VP and [ANP] in the atrial tissue was significantly higher than in the ventricular tissue (p < 0.001). In patients without myocardial ischemia (valvular heart disease) [ANP] in the PF was 258.3 (189.9-342.5) pg/ml, in the VP 28.4 (11.7-57.6) pg/ml and 151.7 (78.4-447.6) ng/mg in the atrial, 0.4 (0.2-1.6) ng/mg in the ventricular tissue.

In conclusion, [ANP] in PF of cardiosurgical patients is higher by an order of magnitude than in VP.

We have recently shown that tissue-engineered cardiac graft, constructed from cardiomyocytes seeded within an alginate scaffold, is capable of preventing the deterioration in cardiac function after myocardial infarction in rats. The present article addresses cell seeding within porous alginate scaffolds in an attempt to achieve 3D high-density cardiac constructs with a uniform cell distribution. Due to the hydrophilic nature of the alginate scaffold, its >90% porosity and interconnected pore structure, cell seeding onto the scaffold was efficient and short, up to 30 min. Application of a moderate centrifugal force during cell seeding resulted in a uniform cell distribution throughout the alginate scaffolds, consequently enabling the loading of a large number of cells onto the 3D scaffolds. The percent cell yield in the alginate scaffolds ranged between 60-90%, depending on cell density at seeding; it was 90% at seeding densities of up to 1 x 10(8) cells/cm(3) scaffold and decreased to 60% at higher densities. The highly dense cardiac constructs maintained high metabolic activity in culture. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the cells aggregated within the scaffold pores. Some of the aggregates were contracting spontaneously within the matrix pores. Throughout the culture there was no indication of cardiomyocyte proliferation within the scaffolds, nor was it found in 3D cultures of cardiofibroblasts.

{"title": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1-induced collagen production in cultures of cardiac fibroblasts is the result of the appearance of myofibroblasts.", "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), which appears in high concentrations in fibrotic cardiac tissue, is a potent inductor of tissue collagen deposition and of the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. It is accepted that TGF-beta 1 is a potent stimulator of collagen secretion by fibroblasts. The aim of the present study was to determine which type of cells, fibroblasts and/or myofibroblasts are stimulated, in terms of collagen production, by TGF-beta 1. Therefore, using cultures of second-passage rat cardiac fibroblasts, we investigated the dose- (0.003-15 ng/ml) and time-dependence (2-48 h) of the TGF-beta 1-induced effects on collagen production and on the appearance of myofibroblasts, as estimated by the presence of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA; a marker of myofibroblasts). The reversibility of the TGF-beta 1-stimulated effects was also studied. The dose- and time-dependent stimulation of collagen production was closely associated with the induction of alpha-SMA. TGF-beta 1 did not change the cell phenotype or increase collagen production in rat cardiac fibroblasts cultures after a long incubation (24-28 h) at low concentrations (< 1 ng/ml), or after a short incubation (2-4 h) at high concentrations (1-15 ng/ml). However, after a long incubation at high concentrations, TGF-beta 1 changed the cell phenotype and increased collagen production in these cultures through the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. A maximal increase of collagen production (two-fold, p < 0.001) was observed after incubation of fibroblasts with 15 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 for 48 h. Under these conditions, alpha-SMA was increased by 3.5-fold (p < 0.001) and second-passage cultures of fibroblasts and their offspring in the next passage consisted mainly of myofibroblasts. The stimulation of collagen by 15 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 for 48 h was irreversible. In fact, additional incubation of these second-passage TGF-beta 1-stimulated cultures without TGF-beta 1 for 2 days did not decrease the high activity of collagen production. Moreover, the third-passage offspring of these TGF-beta 1-stimulated fibroblasts cultured without TGF-beta 1 also showed a higher production of collagen compared with control fibroblasts. Furthermore, the increased collagen production in the third-passage fibroblast offspring of the second-passage TGF-beta 1-stimulated fibroblasts could not be further stimulated by TGF-beta 1. Thus, the activity of collagen production in TGF-beta 1-stimulated cultures and in their next passage offspring is not sensitive to TGF-beta 1. Our data suggest that TGF-beta 1-stimulated collagen production in cultures of adult rat cardiac ventricular fibroblasts cannot be explained by a direct stimulation of collagen production, either in fibroblasts or in myofibroblasts. Instead, TGF-beta 1 induces differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, the latter having a higher activity for collagen production than the former.", "journal": "Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology", "date": "2002-09-13", "authors": ["PLijnen", "VPetrov"], "doi": "10.1358/mf.2002.24.6.693065"}

In sinus rhythm dogs, peak AERP changes resulting from intravenous KB infusion ranged from (mean+/-SEM) 4.4+/-0.4% (1 mg/kg) to 14.8+/-2.6% (5 mg/kg; ED50=1.9 mg/kg). AERP was maximally prolonged between 5 and 10 minutes after beginning of KB infusion and returned to baseline values within 30 minutes thereafter. Rapid atrial pacing-induced AF reversibly shortened AERP (P<0.001) in 5 dogs, averaging 14.9+/-2.1% after 90 minutes of AF. Both the time course and magnitude of mean AERP changes in 5 AF dogs receiving 5 mg/kg KB were indistinguishable from those in 5 sinus rhythm dogs receiving an equivalent KB dose (P>0.05). We measured cardiac tissue and arterial plasma KB concentrations produced by intravenous infusion (1 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) of 5 mg/kg KB. Plasma drug concentration peaked at the end of KB infusions (30.86+/-3.26 nmol/L; n=4 dogs) and declined to 0.56+/-0.19 nmol/L after 100 minutes. The cardiac tissue-to-plasma drug concentration gradient averaged approximately 40 at 100 minutes after start of KB infusion. KB at concentrations achieved in vivo irreversibly blocked NCX-mediated Ca2+ influx in isolated canine right atrial myocytes by approximately 60%, but had no significant effect on NCX-dependent Ca2+ extrusion.\nNCX-mediated Ca2+ influx plays an important role in acute, AF-induced AERP shortening.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2002-09-11", "authors": ["AkiraMiyata", "Douglas PZipes", "StephenHall", "MichaelRubart"], "doi": "10.1161/01.cir.0000028587.85711.f6"}

Oxidative stress may contribute to the deleterious effects of homocysteine (Hcy). The aim of the present study is to study the effect of folic acid and Vitamin B(12) supplementation on isoprenaline (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in hyperhomocysteinemic rats. Hhcy was induced by daily intake of methionine (1 g kg(-1) body weight) in the drinking water for 4 weeks. MI was then produced by a single subcutaneous injection of ISO (300 mg kg(-1), s.c.). Electrocardiographic parameters, heart rate, ST segment, and blood pressure as well as serum marker enzymes, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. Lipid peroxidation measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations in heart tissue were estimated as indices of oxidative stress. Hhcy resulted in significant blood pressure reduction, ST segment elevation and increase in heart rate and serum CK and LDH levels. Cardiac MDA was significantly increased, while GSH was decreased in Hhcy group compared to the normal control group. All the measured parameters were greatly exaggerated in Hhcy rats treated with ISO in comparison with Hhcy rats alone. Administration of folic acid (10 mg kg(-1), orally via gavage) and Vitamin B(12) (500 microg kg(-1), i.m.) concurrently for 4 weeks during the induction of Hhcy markedly reduced the increase in heart rate, ST segment elevation and blood pressure reduction as well as the increase in serum CK and LDH levels. Cardiac MDA content was decreased while cardiac GSH was elevated in the treated group compared to Hhcy + ISO group. Moreover, the severe cardiac histopathological changes observed in Hhcy + ISO group were attenuated by folic acid and Vitamin B(12). These results suggest that Hhcy aggravates MI via oxidative stress mechanisms and that lowering Hcy level with folic acid and Vitamin B(12) can ameliorate the detrimental effects of Hhcy and may reduce the risk of MI.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2002-09-11", "authors": ["Hanan HHagar"], "doi": "10.1016/s1043-6618(02)00095-6"}

Thirteen cases were identified and the heart tissues were analyzed for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), influenza A, influenza B, parvovirus, rotavirus, picornavirus (including separate primers for enterovirus and Coxsackie virus A and B), varicella zoster virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Thirteen individuals aged 2 to 67 years were studied. In each case, polymerase chain reaction-amplified viral RNA was detected in situ: Coxsackie virus B (5 cases), rotavirus (4 cases), HIV-1 (2 cases), influenza A (1 case), and influenza B (1 case). Immunohistochemical detection of viral proteins was found in the five Coxsackie virus cases and four rotavirus cases. The mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate was diffuse and marked only in the cases of influenza A and HIV-1, as well as one of the Coxsackie virus and rotavirus cases, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the most common cell type in the inflammatory infiltrates was CD68-positive macrophages. Direct myocyte infection was most prominent in the cases of Coxsackie virus infection. In summary, in situ viral detection was documented in each case of idiopathic myocarditis associated with sudden, unexpected death; in 6/13 cases, the myocarditis was focal and minimal.

They have been shown to influence a variety of biological functions including sterol metabolism, lipid trafficking, and apoptosis. Recently, 12 human OSBP-related genes have been identified. In this study, we have identified a family of 12 oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs) in the mouse. A high level of amino acid identity (88-97%) was determined between mouse and human ORPs, indicating a very high degree of evolutionary conservation. All proteins identified contained the conserved OSBP amino acid sequence signature motif \"EQVSHHPP,\" and most contained a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Using RT-PCR, each mouse ORP gene was found to exhibit a unique tissue distribution with many showing high expression in testicular, brain, and heart tissues. Interestingly, the tissue distribution of ORP-4 and ORP-10 were the most selective within the family. Expression of the various ORP genes was also investigated, specifically in highly purified populations of hemopoietic precursor cells defined by the lin(-) c-kit(+) Sca-1(+) (LKS(+)) and lin(-) c-kit(+) Sca-1(-) (LKS(-)) immunophenotype. Most ORP genes were expressed in both LKS(+) and LKS(-) populations, although ORP-4 appeared to be more highly expressed in the primitive, stem-cell enriched LKS(+) population, whereas ORP-10 was more highly expressed by maturing LKS(-) cells.

{"title": "Biological significance of a human enterovirus B-specific RNA element in the 3' nontranslated region.", "abstract": "The secondary structures predicted for the enteroviral 3' nontranslated region (3'NTR) all seem to indicate a conformation consisting of two (X and Y) hairpin structures. The higher-order RNA structure of the 3'NTR appears to exist as an intramolecular kissing interaction between the loops of these two hairpin structures. The enterovirus B-like subgroup possesses an additional stem-loop structure, domain Z, which is not present in the poliovirus-like enteroviruses. It has been suggested that the Z domain originated from a burst of short sequence repetitions (E. V. Pilipenko, S. V. Maslova, A. N. Sinyakov, and V. I. Agol, Nucleic Acids Res. 20:1739-1745, 1992). However, no functional features have yet been ascribed to this enterovirus B-like-specific RNA element in the 3'NTR. In this study, we tested the functional characteristics and biological significance of domain Z. A mutant of the cardiovirulent coxsackievirus group B3 strain Nancy which completely lacked the Z domain and which therefore acquired enterovirus C-like secondary structures exhibited a wild-type growth phenotype, as determined by single-cycle growth analysis with BGM cells. This result proves that the Z domain is virtually dispensable for viral growth in tissue cultures. Partial distortion of the Z domain structure resulted in a disabled virus with reduced growth kinetics, probably due to alternative conformations of the overall structure of the domain. Infection of mice showed that the recombinant coxsackievirus group B3 mutant which completely lacked the Z domain was less virulent. Pancreatic tissues from mice infected with wild-type virus and recombinant virus were equally affected. However, the heart tissue from mice infected with the recombinant virus showed only slight signs of myocarditis. These results suggest that the enterovirus B-like-specific Z domain plays a role in coxsackievirus-induced pathogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2002-09-05", "authors": ["IngridMerkle", "Mark J Mvan Ooij", "Frank J Mvan Kuppeveld", "Dirk H R FGlaudemans", "Jochem M DGalama", "AndreasHenke", "RolandZell", "Willem J GMelchers"], "doi": "10.1128/jvi.76.19.9900-9909.2002"}
{"title": "Phosphine-induced oxidative damage in rats: role of glutathione.", "abstract": "Phosphine (PH(3)), generated from aluminium, magnesium and zinc phosphide, is a widely used pesticide. PH(3) induces oxidative stress in insects, mammalian cells, animals, and humans. The involvement of glutathione (GSH) in PH(3)-induced oxidative toxicity is controversial. GSH levels in various tested tissues were reduced in aluminium phosphide-poisoned rats and humans, while the levels remained unchanged in insects and mammalian cells. This study examines the effectiveness of endogenous GSH as a protective agent against PH(3)-induced oxidative damage in rats. The association of PH(3)-induced nephrotoxicity and cardiotoxicity with free radical production was also tested. Male Wistar rats, administered intraperitoneally (I.P.) with PH(3) at 4 mg/kg, were evaluated 30 min after treatment for PH(3) toxicity to organs. PH(3) significantly decreased GSH, GSH peroxidase and catalase, while significantly increased lipid peroxidation (as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals), DNA oxidation (as 8-hydroxydeoxyguaonsoine) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in kidney and heart. These changes were significantly alleviated by melatonin (10 mg/kg I.P., 30 min before PH(3)), with the exception of SOD activity in heart tissue. The study also found that buthionine sulfoximine (1 g/kg I.P., 24 h before PH(3)) significantly enhanced the effect of PH(3) on GSH loss and lipid peroxidation elevation in lung. These findings indicate that (1) endogenous GSH plays a crucial role as a protective factor in modulating PH(3)-induced oxidative damage, and (2) PH(3) could injure kidney and heart (as noted earlier with brain, liver and lung) via oxidative stress and the antioxidant melatonin effectively prevents the damage.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2002-09-03", "authors": ["Ching-HungHsu", "Bei-ChingChi", "Ming-YieLiu", "Jih-HengLi", "Chiou-JongChen", "Ruey-YuChen"], "doi": "10.1016/s0300-483x(02)00246-9"}

We investigated whether these benefits of insulin could be explained by increased glycolysis during the ischaemic period, even in the presence of potentially cardiodepressant substrates such as fatty acids and lactate. Increased cardiac output during post-ischaemic reperfusion was used as a marker of protection by insulin.\nIsolated hearts from fasted rats were subjected to 5 minutes of Langendorff perfusion followed by a 15-minute working heart pre-ischaemic perfusion with glucose (11 mmol/l), followed by a 30-minute 0.2 ml/min low-flow Langendorff ischaemic period, using glucose(11 mmol/l) or glucose plus fatty acids (1 mmol/l), or lactate (10 mmol/l), or lactate plus glucose as substrates.

Insulin (1 mU/ml), when added, was present throughout the experimental protocol.\nPost-ischaemic reperfusion cardiac output recovery was depressed in hearts perfused with glucose plus fatty acids or with lactate alone, when compared with glucose alone (p<0.01). In each case, cardiac output improved (p < 0.01) with insulin pre-treatment despite added fatty acids, or in hearts perfused with lactate alone during ischaemia. Improved cardiac output could be linked to improved glucose uptake (p < 0.05) during ischaemia and increased pre-ischaemic glycogen stores (p < 0.01). In hearts perfused with lactate alone, increased glycolysis occurred via glycogen breakdown as confirmed by increased cardiac tissue lactate levels at the end o the ischaemic period.\nInsulin treatment before ischaemia and throughout ischaemia and reperfusion, abolished the depressant effects of fatty acids added to glucose or of lactate alone, on reperfusion cardiac output.

We have investigated two issues that are fundamental to advancing that understanding. First, there has been widespread debate over the mechanisms by which an externally applied shock can influence a sufficient volume of heart tissue to terminate cardiac fibrillation. Second, it has been uncertain whether cardiac tissue should be viewed as an electrically orthotropic structure, or whether its electrical properties are, in fact, isotropic in the plane orthogonal to myofiber direction. In the present study, a computer model that incorporates a detailed three-dimensional representation of cardiac muscular architecture is used to investigate these issues. We describe a bidomain model of electrical propagation solved in a discontinuous domain that accurately represents the microstructure of a transmural block of rat left ventricle. From analysis of the model results, we conclude that (1) the laminar organization of myocytes determines unique electrical properties in three microstructurally defined directions at any point in the ventricular wall of the heart, and (2) interlaminar clefts between layers of cardiomyocytes provide a substrate for bulk activation of the ventricles during defibrillation.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2002-08-24", "authors": ["Darren AHooks", "Karl ATomlinson", "Scott GMarsden", "Ian JLeGrice", "Bruce HSmaill", "Andrew JPullan", "Peter JHunter"], "doi": "10.1161/01.res.0000031957.70034.89"}

{"title": "Selenium supplementation decreases coxsackievirus heart disease during murine AIDS.", "abstract": "Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) induces myocarditis, especially in the immunodeficient or immature. To investigate whether CVB3 induced pronounced cardiomyopathy during the severe immune dysfunction of murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), female C57BL/6 mice were infected with LP-BM5 retrovirus and then coinfected with CVB3. C57BL/6 mice, essentially resistant to CVB3-induced cardiomyopathy, became susceptible to this cardiomyopathy because of the immune dysfunction caused by murine AIDS. This susceptibility suggests that retrovirus infection causes conditions favoring the CVB3 induction of cardiac lesions. Mice were fed a diet supplemented with selenium (Se) at nine times the recommended daily dose for mice (0.933 mg/ kg of diet). Heart tissues were analyzed histopathologically 12 d after CVB3 challenge. Mice experiencing concurrent retrovirus and CVB3 infection had a high degree of cardiac lesions that were consistent with myopathy compared to that in uninfected mice (p < 0.05). Se supplementation during murine retrovirus infection significantly diminished the pathogenesis caused by concurrent CVB3 infection in mice that had murine AIDS. There was a significant increase in the survival of dually retrovirus and CVB3-infected mice that were fed Se, compared to that of identically treated mice that were not fed Se. Hepatic lipid peroxides were significantly diminished in the Se-supplemented mice as compared to those in immunodeficient mice without supplementation (p <F 0.1). Increased oxidation occurred in mice that had murine AIDS, which was also shown by reduced tissue vitamin E. Therefore, the reduction of retrovirally induced oxidation and inflammation by Se produced conditions that improved the survival of mice during CVB3 infection.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2002-08-22", "authors": ["R Tom\u00e1sSep\u00falveda", "JinZhang", "Ronald RWatson"], "doi": "10.1385/ct:2:1:53"}

Placebo, MA-treated groups were intraperitoneally injected with saline, MA, respectively, with a gradually increasing dose from 15 to 40 mg/kg for 12 weeks (5 days/week). Con A- and LPS-induced mitogenesis of splenocytes, cytokine production by splenocytes culture and lipid peroxides in the liver were measured. Heart tissue histopathology was analyzed in all the groups with murine cytomegalovirus (CMV) superinfection. Our data showed that MA treatment significantly decreased production of IL-2 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in uninfected mice but did not further suppress the reduced Th1 cytokines in retrovirus-infected mice. There were no significant effects on cytokines IL-4 and IL-6. However, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) was significantly increased in both uninfected and infected mice due to MA treatment. Lipid peroxides in liver were significantly increased both in uninfected and retrovirus-infected mice due to MA exposure. Vitamin E levels in liver were significantly decreased in uninfected mice due to MA treatment. CMV superinfection greatly increased the cardiac lesions in retrovirus-infected mice while no significant histopathology changes were detected due to MA treatment.

EDCs were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA and transplanted into infarcted myocardium. Compared with the MI mice receiving cell-free medium, cardiac function was significantly improved in the MI mice 6 wk after transplantation of EDCs. Moreover, improvement of heart function was significantly greater in the mice implanted with EDCs overexpressing VEGF (EDCs-VEGF) than with EDCs alone. Frozen sections of infarcted myocardium with EDCs or EDCs-VEGF transplantation showed GFP-positive tissue. The area with positive immunostaining for cardiac troponin I and alpha-myosin heavy chain was larger in injured myocardium with EDCs or EDCs-VEGF transplantation than with medium injection. Transplantation of EDCs or EDCs-VEGF significantly increased the number of blood vessels in the MI area. However, the density of capillaries was significantly higher in the EDCs-VEGF animals than in the EDC mice. Double staining for GFP and connexin-43 was positive in injured myocardium with EDC transplantation.

Determination of the hour of onset of symptomatic third-degree AV block, however, was possible and listed in the records of only 161 or 70.9% of the cases (92 men and 69 women). The onset time of every event was categorized into one of four 6h spans of the 24h: night (00:00-05:59h), morning (06:00-11:59h), afternoon (12:00-17:59h), and evening (18:00-23:59h). The onset of the symptoms of third-degree AV block in the sample of 161 cases was significantly greater in the morning between 06:00 and 11:59h than any other 6h span of the day and night (chi2-test; p < 0.001). The same phenomenon was substantiated in the subgroup of the 92 males (chi2; p < 0.0001), although it could not be detected for the smaller subgroup of 69 women. The 24h pattern, with morning preference, in the onset of symptomatic third-degree AV block is similar to the one in sudden cardiac death and cardiogenic cardiac arrest.

{"title": "Cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Recent progress in implantations of differentiated cardiac and non-cardiac cells as well as adult stem cells into the heart suggests that the irreversible loss of viable cardiac myocytes that occurs during myocardial infarction can be at least partly substituted. We evaluated an alternative approach by reconstituting cardiac tissue grafts in vitro and implanting them as spontaneously and coherently contracting tissues. For this purpose we have optimized a method to generate ring-shaped three-dimensional engineered heart tissue (EHT) in vitro from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. When subjected to isometric force measurements in organ baths, electrically stimulated EHTs exhibit a Frank-Starling behavior, a positive inotropic response to increases in extracellular calcium, a positive inotropic and lusitropic response to isoprenaline, and a negative inotropic response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol ('accentuated antagonism'). Twitch tension under maximal calcium amounts to 1-2 mN/ mm2. Importantly, passive (resting) tension is low, yielding a ratio of active/passive tension of approximately 1.5 under basal and 14 under maximal calcium. Morphologically, EHTs represent a highly interconnected three-dimensional network of cardiac myocytes resembling loose cardiac tissue with a high fraction of binucleated cardiac myocytes, strong eosin staining and elongated centrally located nuclei. Electron microscopy demonstrated well developed sarcomeric structures, T-tubules, SR vesicles, T-tubule-SR-junctions, all types of intercellular connective structures, and a basement membrane. Thus, EHTs comprise functional and morphological properties of intact, ventricular myocardium. First implantation experiments of EHTs in the peritoneum of Fischer 344 rats showed that EHTs survived for at least 14 days, maintained a network of differentiated cardiac myocytes, and were strongly vascularized.

C-CTX-1 (1 pM-50 nM) dose-dependently shortened the duration of the plateau and the repolarizing phase of the action potential (AP). The AP shortening induced by C-CTX-1 (50 nM) was suppressed or prevented either by tetrodotoxin (TTX; 0.6 nM) or by atropine (0.1mM). C-CTX-1 (50 nM) prolonged the TTX (0.6 nM)-sensitive electrical response of the vagus nerve branches, which innervate the auricle. The C-CTX-1 (50 nM)-induced shortening of the plateau and of the repolarization phase were prevented or reversed by gallamine (20 microM) and pirenzepine (0.5 microM), respectively. C-CTX-1 (50 nM) decreased the amplitude of the peak contraction and shortened its duration. In the presence of gallamine (20 microM), C-CTX-1 decreased the amplitude of the peak contraction and shortened its duration in the presence of pirenzepine (0.5 microM). C-CTX-1 (50 nM) decreased the time constant of the relaxation phase of the peak contraction suggesting that it increased the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activity. Acetylcholine (ACh; 1 pM) shortened APD, decreased the peak contraction and mimics the effects of C-CTX-1. In conclusion, the presented data show that C-CTX-1 released ACh from atrial cholinergic nerve terminals which activated M(1) and M(2) muscarinic receptors subtype (mAChR).

The template DNA was initially amplified 1024-fold by subjecting it to 10 PCR cycles in the absence of the TaqMan probe. Thereafter, conventional real-time PCR was simultaneously performed on both target and standard samples. We measured the small quantities of CYP11B2 gene transcript and found the levels to be significantly higher in samples from heart failure patients than in those from cardiovascular disease-free patients.

{"title": "Comparison of contractile function of diaphragm and cardiac muscle in response to paired electrical stimulation.", "abstract": "Paired pacing has been shown to potentiate contractile function of cardiac muscle, and it has been suggested that this may enhance contractile function of diaphragmatic muscle. The primary goal of this study was to study the effect of paired pacing on potentiation of contractile function of diaphragmatic muscle compared to atrial and ventricular myocardium. Diaphragmatic muscle was isolated from mouse and rat, and atrial and ventricular myocardium from dogs. Potentiation was induced by isolated extrastimuli (equal in duration and intensity to the pacing stimulus) and by repetitive extrastimuli (i.e. paired pacing) at a paced rate of 12, 30 and 60 beats/min. Baseline studies were performed while preparations were isometrically contracting at L(max) in oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution at 28 degrees C. Maximal force generation in response to a premature stimulus was determined at each rate by scanning the coupling interval between paced beats. Under baseline conditions, diaphragmatic muscle contracted faster than atrial and ventricular muscle. In all tissues, maximum potentiation (increase in force above baseline) was approximately 100% of baseline force, and peak potentiation occurred at shorter coupling intervals with increasing rates of stimulation. Single and paired pacing of diaphragm potentiated the contraction during which the extrastimuli were introduced, while in cardiac muscle, extrastimuli potentiated the contraction following the extrastimulus. The maximum potentiated response occurred when the extrastimulus was introduced prior to the development of peak force in diaphragmatic muscle. In contrast, in atrial and ventricular muscle, a single or paired premature stimulus potentiated the subsequent beat when delivered late during relaxation. In cardiac muscle, maximal potentiation gradually occurred following several repetitive stimuli. Following cessation of single and paired pacing, the beat following the potentiated response immediately returned to baseline in diaphragmatic muscle, while a gradual decline was evident over several subsequent beats in cardiac muscle. Increasing the bath temperature from 28 to 37 degrees C resulted in a leftward shift in the peak potentiated force vs. coupling interval curve without a decline in the magnitude of potentiated force in diaphragmatic muscle. In diaphragm muscle, exposure to ryanodine markedly decreased baseline force and maximal potentiation. We conclude that closely timed extrastimuli applied to diaphragmatic muscle can potentiate developed force in a given contraction, while in cardiac tissue a delayed stimulus potentiates the subsequent beat. These differences in contractile responsiveness are not due to differences in loading conditions, but appear to reflect intrinsic differences in calcium handling.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "Troponin I phosphorylation enhances crossbridge kinetics during beta-adrenergic stimulation in rat cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Inotropic agents that increase the intracellular levels of cAMP have been shown to increase crossbridge turnover kinetics in intact rat ventricular muscle, as measured by the parameter f(min) (the frequency at which dynamic stiffness is minimum). These agents are also known to increase the level of phosphorylation of two candidate myofibrillar proteins: myosin binding protein C (MyBPC) and Troponin I (TnI), but have no effect on myosin light chain 2 phosphorylation (MyLC2). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the phosphorylation of TnI and/or MyBPC was responsible for the increase in crossbridge cycling kinetics (as captured by f(min)) seen with the elevation of cAMP within cardiac tissue. Using barium-activated intact rat papillary muscle, we investigated the actions of isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent phosphatase, which simulates the action of beta-adrenergic agents, and the chemical phosphatase 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), which has been shown to dephosphorylate a number of contractile proteins. The presence of 0.6 mM IBMX approximately doubled the f(min) value of intact rat papillary muscle. This action was unaffected by the addition of BDM. In the presence of IBMX and BDM, the level of phosphorylation of MyBPC was unchanged, that of MyLC2 was reduced to 60 % of control, yet that of TnI was markedly increased (to 30 % above control levels).

Here, using a reconstituted Ca(2+)-regulated human cardiac troponin-tropomyosin actomyosin S1 ATPase assay, we report that a single TnI mutation, A162H, restores Ca(2+) sensitivity at pH 6.5 to that at pH 7.0.

This study focuses on determining how VEP relates to the creation and survival of postshock phase singularities in cardiac tissue and demonstrating that interactions between VEP and preshock tissue state engender the probabilistic nature of defibrillation.\nWe constructed a two-dimensional tissue model representing a ventricular cross-section with fiber architecture and surrounding bath. We initiated spiral wave reentry and subjected the tissue to a monophasic shock. We estimated the shock success probability for a given strength by testing 16 coupling intervals throughout a single rotation of the wavefront. Over a range of shock strengths, our model exhibits dose-response behavior similar to experimental defibrillation efficacy curves. At the 50% effective strength (ED50), successful termination of reentry depends upon the interaction between preshock excitable gap and postshock phase singularities. We also found that increasing the stimulus strength toward ED50 increases the number of postshock singularities, whereas further strength increases above ED50 decrease the number of singularities.\nOur results show for the first time that a computational model can account for the probabilistic nature of defibrillation as VEP interacts with the dynamics of an ongoing reentrant wavefront. Further, we demonstrate that success of a shock depends on the annihilation of the phase singularities that arise after any strong stimulus. Our findings imply that VEP completely overrides the preshock tissue state in shocks that are highly likely to defibrillate (ED95).", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2002-07-26", "authors": ["JamesEason", "NataliaTrayanova"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1540-8167.2002.00672.x"}

Abnormalities in the skin, liver and blood of neonates are also associated with anti-Ro/La antibodies, and are usually self-limiting; these manifestations and CHB are collectively referred to as neonatal lupus syndromes (NLS).\nRecent studies demonstrate that Ro/La ribonucleoproteins appear on the surface of apoptotic fetal cardiocytes and are recognized by their cognate antibodies, promoting an inflammatory response. Mice immunized with Ro/La proteins have offspring with conduction abnormalities. In vitro, human serum and IgG with anti-Ro/La antibodies affect the conducting properties of isolated animal heart tissue.\nIf fetal bradycardia is identified, a 2-dimensional and M-mode fetal echocardiographic and Doppler ultrasound should be obtained to determine whether there is an atrial arrhythmia or atrioventricular (AV) block, and to what degree, and whether there are major structural abnormalities of the heart.

{"title": "Elevated generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.", "abstract": "Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is a life-threatening respiratory disease characterized by profound pulmonary edema and myocardial depression. Most cases of HCPS in North America are caused by Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is carried asymptomatically by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). The underlying pathophysiology of HCPS is poorly understood. We hypothesized that pathogenic SNV infection results in increased generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), which contribute to the morbidity and mortality of HCPS. Human disease following infection with SNV or Andes virus was associated with increased nitrotyrosine (NT) adduct formation in the lungs, heart, and plasma and increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lungs compared to the results obtained for normal human volunteers. In contrast, NT formation was not increased in the lungs or cardiac tissue from SNV-infected deer mice, even at the time of peak viral antigen expression. In a murine (Mus musculus) model of HCPS (infection of NZB/BLNJ mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13), HCPS-like disease was associated with elevated expression of iNOS in the lungs and NT formation in plasma, cardiac tissue, and the lungs. In this model, intraperitoneal injection of 1400W, a specific iNOS inhibitor, every 12 h during infection significantly improved survival without affecting intrapulmonary fluid accumulation or viral replication, suggesting that cardiac damage may instead be the cause of mortality. These data indicate that elevated production of RONS is a feature of pathogenic New World hantavirus infection and that pharmacologic blockade of iNOS activity may be of therapeutic benefit in HCPS cases, possibly by ameliorating the myocardial suppressant effects of RONS.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2002-07-23", "authors": ["Ian CDavis", "Allan JZajac", "Kurt BNolte", "JasonBotten", "BrianHjelle", "SadisMatalon"], "doi": "10.1128/jvi.76.16.8347-8359.2002"}

The purpose of this study was to test whether volatile anesthetics mediate this effect by activation of the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium (mitoK(ATP)) or sarcolemmal K(ATP) (sarcK(ATP)) channel in rat ventricular myocytes and to evaluate the signaling pathways involved.\nA cellular model of ischemia with subsequent hypoosmolar trypan blue staining served to determine the effects of 5-hydroxydecanoate, a selective mitoK(ATP) channel blocker, HMR-1098, a selective sarcK(ATP) channel blocker, diazoxide, a preconditioning mimicking agent, and various modulators of putative signaling pathways on cardioprotection elicited by sevoflurane and isoflurane. Microscopy was used to visualize and measure autofluorescence of flavoproteins, a direct index of mitoK(ATP) channel activity.\nVolatile anesthetics significantly enhanced diazoxide-mediated activation of mitoK(ATP) channels as assessed by autofluorescence of myocytes. Conversely, volatile anesthetics alone did not alter mitoK(ATP) channel activity, implying a priming effect of volatile anesthetics on mitoK(ATP) channels. Administration of the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine completely blocked this effect. Also, pretreatment with volatile anesthetics potentiated diazoxide-mediated protection against ischemia, as indicated by a reduction in trypan blue-positive myocytes. Importantly, cardioprotection afforded by volatile anesthetics was unaffected by the sarcK(ATP) channel blocker HMR-1098 but sensitive to modulations of nitric oxide and adenosine-G(i) signaling pathways.\nUsing autofluorescence in live cell imaging microscopy and a simulated model of ischemia, the authors present evidence that volatile anesthetics mediate their protection in cardiomyocytes by selectively priming mitoK(ATP) channels through multiple triggering protein kinase C-coupled signaling pathways.

This study examined the relationships between ANP and BNP gene expression, immunoreactivity and fibrosis in cardiac tissue, circulating ANP levels, and ANP and BNP mRNA during embryogenesis in Npr1(-/-) mice. Disruption of the Npr1 signaling pathway resulted in augmented ANP and BNP gene and ANP protein expression in the cardiac ventricles, most pronounced for ANP mRNA in females [414 +/- 57 in Npr1(-/-) ng/mg and 124 +/- 25 ng/mg in wild-type (WT) by Taqman assay, P < 0.001]. This increased expression was highly correlated to the degree of cardiac hypertrophy and was localized to the left ventricle (LV) inner free wall and to areas of ventricular fibrosis. In contrast, plasma ANP was significantly greater than WT in male but not female Npr1(-/-) mice. Increased ANP and BNP gene expression was observed in Npr1(-/-) embryos from 16 days of gestation.

Since then numerous studies were carried out to explore the mechanisms underlying the biological actions of this steroid hormone, and the physiological effects of aldosterone remained an attractive area of research. The utilization of sophisticated molecular biology techniques led to the identification of genes encoding major components of the aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorptive pathway, such as mineralocorticoid receptor. 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, epithelia Na+ channel, and sgk and Kras genes. It is clear that aberrations in these genes lead to genetic diseases affecting blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. However, in the last decade several clinical and experimental studies have implicated aldosterone in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular dysfunction, especially heart failure. In this context, aldosterone increases the accumulation of collagen in the fibroblast and myocytes of the cardiac tissue leading to fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy.

Human left ventricular tissue from a rejected donor transplant heart was homogenized under 19 different conditions and subjected to 2-DE and Western blot analysis for TnT.

For preparative purification, mitochondria from human heart tissue as well as cultured fibroblasts were solubilized with dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside, and the F(1)F(0) was isolated with anti-F(1) monoclonal antibody coupled to protein G-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitated F(1)F(0) contained a full complement of subunits that were identified with specific antibodies against five of the subunits (alpha, beta, OSCP, d, and IF(1)) and by MALDI-TOF and/or LC/MS/MS for all subunits except subunit c, which could not be resolved by these methods because of the limits of detection. Microscale immunocapture of F(1)F(0) from detergent-solubilized mitochondria or whole cell fibroblast extracts was performed using anti-F(1) monoclonal antibody immobilized on 96-well microplates. The captured complex V displayed ATP hydrolysis activity that was fully oligomycin and inhibitor protein IF(1)-sensitive. Moreover, IF(1) could be co-isolated with F(1)F(0) when the immunocapture procedure was carried out at pH 6.5 but was absent when the ATP synthase was isolated at pH 8.0.

Myocardial injury caused by ischaemia and reperfusion comes from multiple pathogenic events, including endothelial damage, neutrophil extravasation into tissue, mast cell activation, and peroxidation of cell membrane lipids. These events are followed by myocardial cell alterations resulting eventually in cell necrosis. An enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species is widely accepted as a stimulus for tissue destruction and cardiac failure. 2. In this study, we have investigated the cardioprotective effects of M40403 in myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury. M40403 is a low molecular weight, synthetic manganese containing superoxide dismutase mimetic (SODm) that selectively removes superoxide anion. Ischaemia was induced in rat hearts in vivo by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Thirty minutes after the induction of ischaemia, the ligature was removed and reperfusion allowed to occur for at least 60 min. M40403 (0.1-1 mg kg(-1)) was given intravenously 15 min before ischaemia. 3. The results obtained in this study showed that M40403 significantly reduced the extent of myocardial damage, mast cell degranulation and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, M40403 significantly attenuated, in a dose-dependent manner, neutrophil infiltration in the myocardium as well as the associated induction of lipid peroxidation. Calcium overload seen post-reperfusion of the ischaemic myocardium was also reduced by M40403. 4. Immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine revealed a positive staining in cardiac tissue taken after reperfusion: this was attenuated by M40403. Moreover reperfused cardiac tissue sections showed positive staining for P-selectin and for anti-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) in the vascular endothelial cells. M40403 treatment markedly reduced the intensity and degree of P-selectin and ICAM-1 in these tissues. No staining for nitrotyrosine, P-selectin or ICAM-1 was found in cardiac tissue taken at the end of the ischaemic period. 5. Overall, M40403 treatment reduced the morphological signs of myocardial cell injury and significantly improved survival. 6. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that M40403 treatment exerts a protective effect against ischaemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial injury, supporting a key role for superoxide anion in reperfusion injuries.

Although the cloned cells would carry the nuclear genome of the patient, the presence of mitochondria inherited from the recipient oocyte raises questions about the histocompatibility of the resulting cells. In this study, we created bioengineered tissues from cardiac, skeletal muscle, and renal cells cloned from adult bovine fibroblasts. Long-term viability was demonstrated after transplantation of the grafts into the nuclear donor animals. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis confirmed that the cloned tissues expressed tissue-specific mRNA and proteins while expressing a different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype. In addition to creating skeletal muscle and cardiac \"patches\", nuclear transplantation was used to generate functioning renal units that produced urinelike fluid and demonstrated unidirectional secretion and concentration of urea nitrogen and creatinine. Examination of the explanted renal devices revealed formation of organized glomeruli- and tubule-like structures. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing in vivo and Elispot analysis in vitro suggested that there was no rejection response to the cloned renal cells.

After this transformation, a subpopulation of cells progressively invades myocardial and valvuloseptal tissues. The first aim of the study was to determine the tissue-specific distribution of two molecules that are thought to play a crucial function in the interaction between EPDCs and other cardiac tissues, namely the Wilms' Tumor transcription factor (WT1) and retinaldehyde-dehydrogenase2 (RALDH2). This study was performed in normal avian and in quail-to-chick chimeric embryos. It was found that EPDCs that maintain the expression of WT1 and RALDH2 initially populate the subepicardial space and subsequently invade the ventricular myocardium. As EPDCs differentiate into the smooth muscle and endothelial cell lineage of the coronary vessels, the expression of WT1 and RALDH2 becomes downregulated. This process is accompanied by the upregulation of lineage-specific markers. We also observed EPDCs that continued to express WT1 (but very little RALDH2) which did not contribute to the formation of the coronary system. A subset of these cells eventually migrates into the atrioventricular (AV) cushions, at which point they no longer express WT1. The WT1/RALDH2-negative EPDCs in the AV cushions do, however, express the smooth muscle cell marker caldesmon. The second aim of this study was to determine the impact of abnormal epicardial growth on cardiac development. Experimental delay of epicardial growth distorted normal epicardial development, reduced the number of invasive WT1/RALDH2-positive EPDCs, and provoked anomalies in the coronary vessels, the ventricular myocardium, and the AV cushions. We suggest that the proper development of ventricular myocardium is dependent on the invasion of undifferentiated, WT1-positive, retinoic acid-synthesizing EPDCs. Furthermore, we propose that an interaction between EPDCs and endocardial (derived) cells is imperative for correct development of the AV cushions.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2002-06-28", "authors": ["J MP\u00e9rez-Pomares", "APhelps", "MSedmerova", "RCarmona", "MGonz\u00e1lez-Iriarte", "RMu\u00f1oz-Ch\u00e1puli", "AWessels"], "doi": "10.1006/dbio.2002.0706"}

Beta-blockers are first-line drugs for the management of systemic hypertension, used alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Drugs in the beta-blocking class have the common property of blocking the binding of catecholamines to beta-adrenergic receptor sites; however, there are significant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences between the individual agents that are of clinical importance. Among these differences are the completeness of gastrointestinal absorption, the degree of hepatic first-pass metabolism, lipid solubility, protein binding, brain penetration, concentration within the cardiac tissue, rate of hepatic biotransformation, and renal clearance of drug and/or metabolites. Long-acting formulations of existing beta-blockers are currently in use, and ultra-short-acting agents are also available. Age, race, cigarette smoking and concomitant drug therapy can also influence the pharmacokinetics of beta-blocking drugs. The wide interpatient variability in plasma drug concentrations observed with beta-blockers makes this parameter unreliable in routine patient management.

This method enables multibeam IMRT, which provides improved sparing of lung and heart tissue. In this paper, we present the general aspects of this approach and an evaluation of the optimum beam configuration for IMRT based on inverse treatment planning.

To understand the potential ionic mechanisms, we examined the effects of KCB-328, which encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) current in cardiac tissues, on human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The amplitudes of steady-state currents and tail currents of HERG were decreased by KCB-328 dose dependently. The decrease became more pronounced at more positive potential, suggesting that the block of HERG by KCB-328 is voltage-dependent. IC(50) values at -30, -20, -10, 0, +10, +20, +30, and +40 mV were 7.6 +/- 0.5, 4.8 +/- 0.4, 3.2 +/- 0.3, 2.1 +/- 0.3, 1.7 +/- 0.2, 1.4 +/- 0.2, 1.3 +/- 0.1, and 1.2 +/- 0.1 microM, respectively. Induction of block depended on depolarization beyond the threshold for channel opening. In addition, time-dependent block developed slowly, with tau = 1.7 +/- 0.3 s (100 microM) at 0 mV, and was delayed by a stronger depolarization to +80 mV, at which HERG channel is inactivated. We can conclude that KCB-328 preferentially blocks open (or activated) HERG channels.

{"title": "The role of thrombin inhibition during percutaneous coronary intervention.", "abstract": "Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of conditions, including myocardial infarction and unstable angina. These syndromes are related to the formation and disruption of atherosclerotic plaque. Rupture of plaque leads to thrombin generation, fibrin deposition, and platelet aggregation, ultimately resulting in restriction of blood flow and ischemia of cardiac tissue. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including angioplasty and coronary stent placement, has been developed to open occluded arteries. The frequency with which these procedures are performed speaks to their largely successful outcomes. However, the mechanical manipulations of PCI result in additional plaque rupture and damage to the vessel wall, exposing subendothelial components to blood and resulting in the initiation of the clotting cascade and in platelet activation. Left unchecked, these intertwined processes lead to formation of arterial thrombi at the site of endothelial damage, and potentially to abrupt vessel closure or embolization of thrombi into the distal microcirculation. Thrombin plays a central role in thrombus formation and platelet activation, and its inhibition significantly reduces thrombus-related sequelae. Current antithrombotic strategies during PCI are based on the traditional indirect thrombin inhibitor heparin. Heparin has several limitations in efficacy and safety, due in part to its indirect mechanism of action. Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, offers significant improvement over heparin in the clinical outcomes and risks associated with PCI.", "journal": "Pharmacotherapy", "date": "2002-06-18", "authors": ["Ann KWittkowsky"], "doi": "10.1592/phco.22.10.97s.33614"}

We used the Courtemanche human atrial cell model and the Luo-Rudy guinea pig ventricular model to compare the roles of electrical restitution in destabilizing spiral wave reentry in simulated two-dimensional homogeneous atrial and ventricular tissue. Because atrial AP morphology is complex, we also validated the usefulness of effective refractory period (ERP) restitution. ERP restitution correlated best with APD restitution at transmembrane potentials greater than or equal to -62 mV, and its steepness was a reliable predictor of spiral wave phenotype (stable, meandering, hypermeandering, and breakup) in both atrial and ventricular tissue. Spiral breakup or single hypermeandering spirals occurred when the slope of ERP restitution exceeded 1 at short diastolic intervals. Thus ERP restitution, which is easier to measure clinically than APD restitution, is a reliable determinant of spiral wave stability in simulated atrial and ventricular tissue.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

TASK-1 expression in cardiac tissue was initially demonstrated by Western blot and then localized by immunofluorescence. In single rat ventricular myocytes, strong staining of the TASK-1 protein was located at the intercalated disks and across the cell in a striated pattern, corresponding to the transverse axial tubular network (T tubules). In contrast, single rat atrial myocytes were stained at the intercalated disks with a weak punctate, striated pattern corresponding to underdeveloped T tubules. Also, formamide was used to induce the detubulation of ventricular myocytes, which enabled confirmation that TASK-1 protein expression occurs in T tubules. Consistent with this, RT-PCR revealed the expression of TASK-1 mRNA in total RNA from both the ventricles and atria. In this study, we conclusively demonstrated that TASK-1 protein and mRNA were expressed in rat atrial and ventricular tissue.

Peptide N-glycosidase F-sensitive forms of horse ERG1 (145 kDa) and KCNQ1 (75 kDa) were detected. Both ERG1 and KCNQ1 coimmunoprecipitated with KCNE1. Cardiac action potential duration was prolonged by antagonists of either ERG1 (MK-499, cisapride) or KCNQ1/KCNE1 (chromanol 293B). Patch-clamp analysis confirmed the presence of a slow delayed rectifier current.

{"title": "In vivo measurement of QT prolongation, dispersion and arrhythmogenesis: application to the preclinical cardiovascular safety pharmacology of a new chemical entity.", "abstract": "In addition to in silico and in vitro measurements, cardiac electrophysiology in experimental animals plays a decisive role in the selection of a potential 'cardio-safe' new chemical entity (NCE). The present synopsis critically reviews such in vivo techniques in experimental animals. In anaesthetized guinea-pigs, surface ECG recordings readily identify the typical effects of Class I to IV anti-arrhythmic compounds and of If blockers such as zatebradine on ECG intervals and morphology, but also of non-cardiovascular NCEs affecting cardiac electrical activity via ion channels or neurogenic mechanisms. QT/RR plots indicate that bradycardia is a dominant effect of IKr blockers (dual modulation by IKr of sinus node activity and ventricular repolarization). Nevertheless, correction of QT with Bazett's formula usually distinguishes between drug-induced heart rate reduction and real prolongation of ventricular repolarization (QTc). The anaesthetized guinea-pig model thus is a useful tool for first line in vivo testing of an NCE for effects on cardiac electrophysiology, in particular when combined with measurements of drug levels in plasma and heart tissues. In anaesthetized dogs, advanced ECG analyses identify drug-induced effects on atrial and ventricular intervals, on temporal and transmural dispersion of ventricular repolarization and on incidences of early after-depolarizations. This can be combined with complete haemodynamic, pulmonary and pharmacokinetic analyses in one preparation. However, compound doses/plasma levels needed for effects on ventricular repolarization in this model are substantially higher than those identified in guinea-pigs, at least for IKr blocking compounds. Therefore, we use this 'information-rich' canine model as a second line approach. In awake, trained and appropriately instrumented dogs, readings of surface ECG in combination with cardio-haemodynamic and behavioural assessments can be performed after the administration of an NCE via the expected therapeutic route, including oral medication. However, at higher doses the compound under scrutiny may induce overall behavioural side-effects, related to its primary pharmacological action, such as gastrokinetic repercussions or CNS-mediated sedation or excitation. Such primary pharmacological effects are bound to compromise the evaluation of real drug-induced changes on cardiac electrophysiology, readily identified by resource-friendly setups in smaller animals. Therefore, we use such paradigms as an imperative, final cardiovascular check-up, before a 'First in Man' administration of the NCE. In anaesthetized, methoxamine-challenged rabbits, arrhythmogenic effects of IKr blockers (torsades de pointes) and of dual channel INa/IKr blockers (conduction disturbances) are readily identified. Drug-induced QT dispersion rather than a 'simple' QTc prolongation determines the ventricular arrhythmogenic effect of IKr blockers. The latter effect also depends on the rate of drug delivery (plasma levels vs. heart level, equilibrium throughout the myocardium). Therefore, we use models sensitized for arrhythmogenesis to document further the profile of a comparatively 'cardio-safe' NCE. We conclude that the interpretation of an integrated profile of activity of an NCE on in vitro and in vivo cardiovascular parameters, in comparison with the characteristics of its primary pharmacology and target disease, determines its eventual selection via a scientific, rather than a 'checklist' or 'menu' approach to cardiovascular safety pharmacology.

The brain was a relatively large organ. Deiodinase activities in liver, kidney, lung, heart, gut, and brain from day 29 to day 77 of development of the saltwater crocodile were investigated. High-K(m) reverse triiodothyronine (rT(3)) outer ring deiodination (ORD) activity was present in all tissues except the brain. Activity ranged from 559 +/- 51.3 pmol rT(3) deiodinated/mg protein/min in the liver at day 77 to below 10 pmol rT(3) deiodinated/mg protein/min in gut, lung, and heart tissue. rT(3) ORD increased during development in the liver and kidney but decreased in the gut and lung. Activity in the heart was very low (less than 2 pmol rT(3) deiodinated/mg protein/min) and did not change during development. Low-K(m) thyroxine (T(4)) ORD in liver and kidney tissue had peaks of activity around day 49 of incubation (0.52 and 0.09 fmol T(4) deiodinated/mg protein/min, respectively). After day 49, T(4) ORD activity in these tissues decreased. T(4) ORD activity in gut, lung, and heart was very low (less than 0.04 fmol T(4) deiodinated/mg protein/min), with activity in lung increasing slightly during the rest of development. T(4) ORD activity in the brain increased toward day 77 (0.14 +/- 0.03 fmol T(4) deiodinated/mg protein/min), illustrating its importance in local triiodothyronine (T(3)) production during brain development.

However, it remains unclear whether VF always has a steep restitution curve. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that afterdepolarizations occur at excitable gaps during VF and affect the SW dynamics, even if the restitution curve is gentle. Homogeneous and isotropic 3-dimensional tissue was simulated with a LRd model. Because of the gentle restitution curve, it was not expected that SW instabilities would occur in this condition. In the tissue, a stationary SW reentry was initially observed; however, afterdepolarizations erupted from the excitable gap near the SW tip, and the SW then meandered widely. Following that, afterdepolarizations erupted far from the SW tip, resulting in SW breakup. In this manner, the wave dynamics degenerated into a chaotic state within a few seconds. Furthermore, not only triggered activity but also subthreshold afterdepolarizations were found to cause SW instabilities. These results suggest that afterdepolarizations may play an important role in the transition to VF and that the mechanism is independent of restitution properties.", "journal": "Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "date": "2002-05-28", "authors": ["TakashiAshihara", "TakenoriYao", "TsunetoyoNamba", "AyakaKawase", "TakanoriIkeda", "KazuoNakazawa", "MakotoIto"], "doi": "10.1253/circj.66.505"}

In atrial homogenate preparations, cathepsin A (deamidase) is responsible for 65% of the liberated Ang 1-9. Ang 1-7 was released (88% to 100%) by a metallopeptidase, as established with peptidase inhibitors. Ang II was liberated to about equal degrees by ACE and chymase-type enzymes. Cathepsin A's presence in heart tissue was also proven because it deamidated enkephalinamide substrate by immunoprecipitation of cathepsin A with antiserum to human recombinant enzyme and by immunohistochemistry. In immunohistochemistry, cathepsin A was detected in myocytes of atrial tissue. The products of Ang I cleavage, Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7, potentiated the effect of an ACE-resistant bradykinin analog and enhanced kinin effect on the B(2) receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected to express human ACE and B(2) (CHO/AB), and in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Ang 1-9 and 1-7 augmented arachidonic acid and nitric oxide (NO) release by kinin. Direct assay of NO liberation by bradykinin from endothelial cells was potentiated at 10 nmol/L concentration, 2.4-fold (Ang 1-9) and 2.1-fold (Ang 1-7); in higher concentrations, Ang 1-9 was significantly more active than Ang 1-7. Both peptides had traces of activity in the absence of bradykinin. Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7 potentiated bradykinin action on the B(2) receptor by raising arachidonic acid and NO release at much lower concentrations than their 50% inhibition concentrations (IC(50)s) with ACE.

Starting from the first studies regarding the presence of mitochondrial damage in cardiac tissue from patients who died of AIDS, researchers have investigated different aspects of the interactions between the virus and mitochondria, from acute primary infection to the final stages of the disease. Only recently a significant impulse to this type of research has come from the observation that the so called \"highly active antiretroviral therapy\" (HAART), a combination of potent antiretroviral drugs such as viral protease inhibitors or nucleoside-analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, is capable of damaging these organelles and cause a clinical syndrome called lipodystrophy. There is still an open debate concerning the exact responsibility of HAART as well as on metabolic pathways and mechanisms that are involved in the onset of lipodystrophy. The hypothesis that drug-induced damage to mitochondrial (mt) DNA is able to alter mitochondria functionality to a similar extent as that occurring in genetic disease affecting mtDNA suggests that mitochondria plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

{"title": "Amelioration of myocardial global ischemia/reperfusion injury with volume-regulatory chloride channel inhibitors in vivo.", "abstract": "Recently, the apoptotic volume decrease was suggested to be regulated by volume regulatory Cl- channels in cultured cell lines. We thus examined whether inhibition of volume-regulatory Cl- channels is cardioprotective, like caspase inhibition, by hindering the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in vivo.\nWe performed global ischemia for 8 min at 37 degrees C or 4 degrees C in isolated rat hearts, followed by 24-hr reperfusion via heterotopic heart transplantation. The heart tissue was examined by means of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method, genomic DNA electrophoresis, and caspase-3 activity. Two blockers of volume-regulatory Cl- channels, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB), and a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, benzoyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene (Z-Asp-DCB), were administered intravenously. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and ultrasound cardiography were performed to examine myocardial viability. The TTC-unstained region was assessed by means of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) infiltration and the TUNEL method.\nThe transplanted hearts showed TUNEL-positivity and DNA laddering with a peak at 24 hr during reperfusion after ischemia at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. NPPB and DIDS were as potent as Z-Asp-DCB for recovery of cardiac function and for blocking the appearance of TUNEL-positivity, DNA laddering, caspase 3 activity, and a TTC-unstained area. TTC-unstained areas were composed of either TUNEL- and slightly HRP-positive or TUNEL-negative and strongly HRP-positive cardiomyocytes.\nThe present results demonstrated that myocardial DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, and loss of cardiac function after global I/R were blocked by NPPB and DIDS, similar to in the case of Z-Asp-DCB.

{"title": "Goto-Kakizaki rat is protected from proteinuria after induction of anti-Thy1 nephritis.", "abstract": "Hyperglycemia, although necessary, alone is insufficient for the development of progressive diabetic nephropathy. Two factors implicated in its pathogenesis are mesangial cell activation and/or proliferation and monocyte/macrophage influx. We have shown that prolonged hyperglycemia in the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is associated with renal structural changes similar to those in patients with diabetes before the onset of progressive nephropathy. The aim of the current study is to examine the role of mesangial cell injury and macrophage influx on renal structure and function. After induction of nephritis in either hyperglycemic GK rats or normoglycemic Wistar rats by the administration of Ox-7 antibody, the degree of mesangiolysis and subsequent mesangial proliferation was no different between GK and Wistar rats. Similarly, macrophage influx and mesangial cell activation (assessed by alpha-smooth actin expression) was no different between the two groups. Wistar rats developed marked albuminuria; conversely, no significant proteinuria or albuminuria was seen in GK rats. Analysis of glomerular proteoglycans (PGs) showed an increase in (35)S incorporation into heparan sulfate PGs of GK compared with Wistar rats, with no alteration in glycosaminoglycan chain size or charge density. These changes were kidney specific and not seen in spleen, lung, or heart tissue. Western blot analysis showed increased agrin core protein expression in whole-kidney homogenates of untreated GK rats. Induction of Thy1.1 nephritis was associated with reduced expression of agrin in both GK and Wistar rats. However, agrin expression was greater in GK rats at all times. In summary, acute mesangial cell injury associated with a macrophage influx did not initiate progressive diabetic nephropathy in GK rats. Despite a similar magnitude of glomerular/mesangial injury, GK rats, in contrast to normoglycemic Wistar rats, did not develop proteinuria after the administration of anti-Thy1 antibody.

Within 97 +/- 163 s, aconitine induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a mean cycle length 268 +/- 37 ms, which accelerated before converting to VF. Drugs that flatten the APD restitution slope, including diacetyl monoxime (10-20 mM, n = 6), bretylium (10-20 microg/ml, n = 3), and verapamil (2-4 microg/ml, n = 3), reversibly converted VF to VT in all cases. In two RVs, VF persisted despite of the excision of the aconitine site. Simulations in two-dimensional cardiac tissue showed that once VF was initiated, it remained sustained even after the \"aconitine\" site was eliminated. In this model of focal source VF, the VT-to-VF transition occurred due to a wave break outside the aconitine site, and drugs that flattened the APD restitution slope converted VF to VT despite continuous activation from aconitine site.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We have examined heart microsomes from rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, frogs, cows, dogs, cats, mini pigs and human beings for activities of these two enzymes. N-Acyl-transferase activity was very high in dogs and cats (>13 pmol/min/mg protein) whereas it was very low to barely detectable in the other species (<3 pmol/min/mg protein). NAPE-PLD activity was very high in rats and guinea pigs (>45 pmol/min/mg protein) whereas it was 9 pmol/min/mg protein in frogs and below that in the other species. The ratio of activity between the two enzymes varied from 0.002 to 15 in the investigated species. The activity of the two enzymes in rat hearts as opposed to rat brain did not change during development.

Nonmyocarditic reoviruses induce more IFN-beta and/or are more sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN-beta in cardiac cells than myocarditis reoviruses. The roles of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) in the cardiac response to viral infection are reviewed, and results suggest possible cardiac-specific variations in IRF-3 and IRF-1 function. In addition, data are presented indicating that the role of IRF-2 in regulation of IFN-beta expression is cell type-specific and differs between skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.

These benefits are of utmost importance when considering gene therapy approaches for glycogen storage disease type-II (GSD-II). GSD-II is a prototypical lysosomal storage disorder caused by lack of intralysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) activity. Lack of GAA can result in a proximal limb myopathy and respiratory and cardiac failure, each due to abnormal glycogen accumulation in the skeletal muscles or cardiac tissues, respectively. After converting the liver into a \"depot\" organ, we found that intravenous injection of the [E1-,polymerase-]AdGAA vector allowed for hepatic secretion of GAA over an at least 20-fold dosage range. We noted that very low plasma GAA levels (derived from hepatic secretion of GAA) can allow for GAA uptake by muscle tissues (skeletal or cardiac), but significantly higher plasma GAA levels are required before glycogen \"cross-correction\" can occur in these same tissues. We also demonstrated that liver-specific enhancer/promoters prolonged GAA transgene expression from persistent [E1-,polymerase-] adenovirus based vector genomes for at least 180 days, and significantly diminished the amounts of neutralizing anti-GAA antibodies elicited in this animal model. Finally, we demonstrated that skeletal muscles can also serve as a \"depot\" organ for GAA secretion, allowing for secretion of GAA and its uptake by noninfected distal tissues, although glycogen reductions in non-injected muscles were not achieved by the latter approach.", "journal": "Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy", "date": "2002-04-12", "authors": ["EnyuDing", "HuiminHu", "Bradley LHodges", "FeliciaMigone", "DelilaSerra", "FangXu", "Yuan-TsongChen", "AndreaAmalfitano"], "doi": "10.1006/mthe.2002.0563"}

These proteins are not constituent parts of the mature complex but are associated with smaller intermediate complexes of the assembly process and have a chaperone-like function. We have characterized the human homologue of one of these two complex I intermediate associated proteins, named CIA30, and show that expression of the human CIA30 protein is ubiquitous with a slightly higher expression in various heart tissues, kidney, lung and liver. As deletion of the Neurospora crassa CIA genes results in severe disruption of the assembly process, human CIA30 can be considered as a candidate gene related to complex I deficiency. Thirteen patients with an isolated complex I deficiency, but who were ruled out for mutations in the 35 nuclear genes of the complex and mtDNA, were subjected to mutational analysis of the gene coding for the human CIA30 protein.

In the present study, we investigated whether plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) is related to the distinct patterns of left ventricular (LV) geometry and LV diastolic function in treated essential hypertension. In 92 patients with chronically treated essential hypertension, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic examinations were performed and LV inflow velocities were measured for evaluation of LV diastolic function. When patients were divided into four groups by the different LV geometric patterns, PAC in patients with eccentric hypertrophy was significantly higher than in those with concentric hypertrophy (15.2+/-2.1 vs. 10.0+/-0.7 ng/dl, p<0.01). However, the ratio of the peak velocity of early diastolic filling to that of atrial filling (EIA), an index of LV diastolic function, was significantly decreased in patients with concentric hypertrophy compared with those showing normal geometry. In the relationship between PAC and LV diastolic function, PAC was negatively correlated with EIA (r=-0.35, p<0.05) only in the subgroup with normal relative wall thickness (i.e., without the concentric change in LV geometry). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that PAC was one of the independent determinants of E/A in the overall subject group. These observations indicate that PAC is associated with the eccentric change in LV geometry in patients with treated essential hypertension and also suggest that the increase in PAC participates in the impairment of LV diastolic function apart from the concentric change in LV geometry, although concentric hypertrophy clearly impairs LV diastolic function.", "journal": "Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension", "date": "2002-04-02", "authors": ["YoshioIwashima", "TakeshiHorio", "SetsukoKuroda", "ShuichiTakishita", "YuheiKawano"], "doi": "10.1291/hypres.25.49"}

This stems from the limited role opioid receptors have been perceived to have in the regulation of the cardiovascular system. Instead, the focus of opioid receptor research, for many years, relates to the characterization of the actions of opioid drugs in analgesia associated with receptor activation in the CNS. However, recent studies suggest that opioid receptors have a role in the heart and cardiovascular system. While some of these actions may be mediated by activation of peripheral opioid receptors, others are not, and may result from direct or receptor-independent actions on cardiac tissue and the peripheral vascular system. This review will outline some of the diverse molecular mechanisms that may be responsible for the cardiovascular actions of opioids, and will characterize the role opioid receptors have in several cardiovascular pathophysiological disease states, including hypertension, heart failure, and ischaemic arrhythmogenesis.

The potential effect of M(1) mAChR on heart function was investigated using M(1) knockout (M(1)-KO) mice. In vivo cardiodynamic analysis showed that basal values of heart rate (HR), developed left ventricular pressure (DLVP), left ventricular dP/dt(max) (LV dP/dt(max)), and mean blood pressure (MBP) were similar between wild-type (WT) and M(1)-KO mice. Injection of the putative M(1)-selective agonist 4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium (McN-A-343) produced an increase in LV dP/dt(max), DLVP, HR, and MBP in WT mice but did not affect hemodynamic function in the M(1)-KO mice. The stimulatory effect of McN-A-343 in WT mice was blocked by pretreatment with propranolol, indicating that stimulation of the M(1) mAChRs on sympathetic postganglionic neurons evoked release of catecholamines. Intravenous injection of ACh in both WT and M(1)-KO mice caused atrioventricular conduction block, without a significant change in the frequency of atrial depolarization, or atrial fibrillation. Immunoprecipitation and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction failed to detect the expression of M(1) mAChR in cardiac tissue from WT mice. The carbachol-induced increase of phospholipase C activity in cardiac tissues was not different between WT and M(1)-KO mice. These results demonstrate that 1) activation of M(1) mAChR subtype on sympathetic postganglionic cells results in catecholamine-mediated cardiac stimulation, 2) M(1) mAChR is not expressed in mouse heart, and 3) administration of ACh to mice induces arrhythmia.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2002-03-22", "authors": ["Sandrine NHardouin", "Keith NRichmond", "AndrewZimmerman", "Susan EHamilton", "Eric OFeigl", "Neil MNathanson"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.301.1.129"}

The effects of treatment with a number of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, (celecoxib, meloxicam, DuP-697 and aspirin) on ischaemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial dysfunction were examined using an in vitro perfused rabbit heart model. 2. Ischaemia resulted in myocardial dysfunction, as indicated by a significant increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure and marked changes in coronary perfusion pressure and left ventricular developed pressure. In the post-ischaemic state, coronary perfusion pressure increased dramatically, left ventricular developed pressure recovered to a small degree and there were significant increases in creatinine kinase release (indicative of myocardial damage) and prostacyclin release. 3. Pretreatment with aspirin, or with drugs that selectively inhibit cyclo-oxygenase-2 (celecoxib, meloxicam and DuP-697), resulted in a concentration-dependent exacerbation of the myocardial dysfunction and damage. Exacerbation of myocardial dysfunction and damage was evident with 10 microM concentrations of the cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, which inhibited prostacyclin release but did not affect cyclo-oxygenase-1 activity (as measured by whole blood thromboxane synthesis). 4. NCX-4016, a nitric oxide-releasing aspirin derivative, significantly reduced the myocardial dysfunction and damage caused by ischaemia and reperfusion. Beneficial effects were observed even at a concentration (100 microM) that significantly inhibited prostacyclin synthesis by the heart. 5.

In an attempt to determine the factor(s) released in response to hypoxia, we inhibited the contribution of adenosine, ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide. Isolated rat septal artery segments without (-T) and with a layer of cardiac tissue (+T) were mounted in a double wire myograph, and constriction was induced. Hypoxia induced a decrease in isometric force of 21% and 61% in -T and +T segments, respectively (P < 0.05). EC removal increased the relaxation to hypoxia in -T segments to 33% but had the same effect in +T segments (61%). Only one of the inhibitors, the adenosine antagonist in +T segments, partially affected the relaxation due to hypoxia. The role of adenosine is thus limited and other mechanisms have to contribute.

To assess the impact of improved antenatal diagnosis in the management and outcome of conjoined twins, the authors reviewed their experience with 14 cases.\nA retrospective review of prenatally diagnosed conjoined twins referred to our institution from 1996 to present was conducted.\nIn 14 sets of conjoined twins, there were 10 thoracoomphalopagus, 2 dicephalus tribrachius dipus, 1 ischiopagus, and 1 ischioomphalopagus. The earliest age at diagnosis was 9 weeks' gestation (range, 9 to 29; mean, 20). Prenatal imaging with ultrasonography, echocardiography, and ultrafast fetal MRI accurately defined the shared anatomy in all cases. Associated anomalies included cardiac malformations (11 of 14), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (4 of 14), abdominal wall defects (2 of 14), and imperforate anus (2 of 14). Three sets of twins underwent therapeutic abortion, 1 set of twins died in utero, and 10 were delivered via cesarean section at a mean gestational age of 34 weeks. There were 5 individual survivors in the series after separation (18%). In one case, in which a twin with a normal heart perfused the cotwin with a rudimentary heart, the ex utero intrapartum treatment procedure (EXIT) was utilized because of concern that the normal twin would suffer immediate cardiac decompensation at birth. This EXIT-to-separation strategy allowed prompt control of the airway and circulation before clamping the umbilical cord and optimized control over a potentially emergent situation, leading to survival of the normal cotwin. In 2 sets of twins in which each twin had a normal heart, tissue expanders were inserted before separation.\nAdvances in prenatal diagnosis allow detailed, accurate evaluations of conjoined twins. Careful prenatal studies may uncover cases in which emergent separation at birth is lifesaving.", "journal": "Journal of pediatric surgery", "date": "2002-03-06", "authors": ["Tippi CMackenzie", "Timothy MCrombleholme", "Mark PJohnson", "LouiseSchnaufer", "Alan WFlake", "Holly LHedrick", "Lori JHowell", "N ScottAdzick"], "doi": "10.1053/jpsu.2002.30830"}

These mechanisms contribute to the ability of insulin to increase hepatic glycogen synthesis. Human G(L) shows >88% amino acid identity to its rat and mouse homologs, with complete conservation of the phosphorylase a binding site. G(L) is highly expressed in the liver and present at appreciable levels in heart tissue of all three species. Surprisingly, G(L) is highly expressed in human skeletal muscle while only being detected at very low levels in rat, mouse, and rabbit skeletal muscle. The amino acid sequence of G(L) predicted from the cDNA is identical in human liver and skeletal muscle and encoded by a gene on chromosome 8 at p23.1. The species-specific difference in the level of expression of G(L) mRNA and protein in skeletal muscle has important implications for understanding the mechanisms by which insulin regulates glycogen synthesis in human skeletal muscle and for questions regarding whether rodents are appropriate models for this purpose.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2002-03-02", "authors": ["ShonaghMunro", "Daniel J RCuthbertson", "JoanCunningham", "MarkSales", "Patricia T WCohen"], "doi": "10.2337/diabetes.51.3.591"}

This protein, fSp3, is most similar to and homologous with mammalian Sp3 proteins. The evolution of the Sp transcription family is described, with Sp1 and Sp3 representing the most recent duplication of the Sp family. Sp4 appears to be the most ancestral member. Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 form a monophyletic group without Sp2. Sp2 is the least similar of the Sp family and is more similar to the non-Sp transcription factors. These results suggest that Sp2 should not be considered a member of the Sp family. Only two domains (zinc fingers and B domain) share similarity outside the Sp family. The zinc fingers are homologous to other GC-binding domains, yet the B domain is homologous to protein-protein interacting domains in the CCAAT-binding/NF-Y transcription factor families.

{"title": "Fabrication of pulsatile cardiac tissue grafts using a novel 3-dimensional cell sheet manipulation technique and temperature-responsive cell culture surfaces.", "abstract": "Recent progress in cell transplantation therapy to repair impaired hearts has encouraged further attempts to bioengineer 3-dimensional (3-D) heart tissue from cultured cardiomyocytes. Cardiac tissue engineering is currently pursued utilizing conventional technology to fabricate 3-D biodegradable scaffolds as a temporary extracellular matrix. By contrast, new methods are now described to fabricate pulsatile cardiac grafts using new technology that layers cell sheets 3-dimensionally. We apply novel cell culture surfaces grafted with temperature-responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm), from which confluent cells detach as a cell sheet simply by reducing temperature without any enzymatic treatments. Neonatal rat cardiomyocyte sheets detached from PIPAAm-grafted surfaces were overlaid to construct cardiac grafts. Layered cell sheets began to pulse simultaneously and morphological communication via connexin43 was established between the sheets. When 4 sheets were layered, engineered constructs were macroscopically observed to pulse spontaneously. In vivo, layered cardiomyocyte sheets were transplanted into subcutaneous tissues of nude rats. Three weeks after transplantation, surface electrograms originating from transplanted grafts were detected and spontaneous beating was macroscopically observed. Histological studies showed characteristic structures of heart tissue and multiple neovascularization within contractile tissues. Constructs transplanted into 3-week-old rats exhibited more cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and less connective tissue than those placed into 8-week-old rats. Long-term survival of pulsatile cardiac grafts was confirmed up to 12 weeks. These results demonstrate that electrically communicative pulsatile 3-D cardiac constructs were achieved both in vitro and in vivo by layering cardiomyocyte sheets. Cardiac tissue engineering based on this technology may prove useful for heart model fabrication and cardiovascular tissue repair.

This sequence of events may be precipitated by a period doubling bifurcation, manifest as a beat-to-beat alternation, or alternans, of cardiac action potential duration and conduction velocity. How alternans causes the local conduction block required for initiation of spiral wave reentry remains unclear, however. In the present study, a mechanism for conduction block was derived from experimental studies in linear strands of cardiac tissue and from computer simulations in ionic and coupled maps models of homogeneous one-dimensional fibers. In both the experiments and the computer models, rapid periodic pacing induced marked spatiotemporal heterogeneity of cellular electrical properties, culminating in paroxysmal conduction block. These behaviors resulted from a nonuniform distribution of action potential duration alternans, secondary to alternans of conduction velocity. This link between period doubling bifurcations of cellular electrical properties and conduction block may provide a generic mechanism for the onset of tachycardia and fibrillation.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2002-02-28", "authors": ["Jeffrey JFox", "Mark LRiccio", "FeiHua", "EberhardBodenschatz", "Robert FGilmour"], "doi": "10.1161/hh0302.104723"}

To investigate the effects of cocaine on myocardial injuries and cardiac P450 expression, BALB/c mice were injected daily intraperitoneally with cocaine (30 mg/kg) or cocaine plus pretreatment of P450 inhibitors for 14 days. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) content and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity in mice hearts and serums were significantly increased after long-term treatment with cocaine. Pretreatment with the P450 inhibitor, cimetidine (Cime, 50 mg/kg) or metyrapone (Mety, 40 mg/kg) abolished or significantly attenuated the effects of cocaine on TNF-alpha and CPK activity. Western blot analysis shows that mouse cardiac tissues express the P450 isoforms CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2J2. The protein levels normalized with cyclophilin A were 1.20 plus minus 0.07, 0.67 plus minus 0.03, and 1.48 plus minus 0.01 for CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP 2J2, respectively. After cocaine administration, CYP2J2 increased by 43.6% and CYP1A1 increased by 108.5%, but CYP1A2 was not significantly altered. However, the cytochrome P450 inhibitors Cime and Mety suppressed the cocaine-induced increase in CYP1A1 and CYP2J2 expression. Moreover, application of Cime or Mety alone did not alter the level of cardiac TNF-alpha or the expression of P450. Our results demonstrate that long-term exposure to cocaine causes an increase in cardiac CYP1A1 and CYP2J2 concentration.

{"title": "Ageing is associated with a decrease in the number of sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ channels in a gender-dependent manner.", "abstract": "The opening of sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels is considered to be an important endogenous cardioprotective mechanism. On the other hand, age-dependent changes in the myocardial susceptibility to ischemia and hypoxia have been observed in different species, including humans. Here, we have hypothesized that aging might be associated with the changes in sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to establish whether aging changes expression of cardiac sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels. RT-PCR using primers specific for K(ATP) channel subunits, Kir6.2, Kir6.1 and SUR2A subunits was performed using total RNA from guinea-pig ventricular tissue. Whole cell electrophysiology was done on isolated guinea-pig ventricular cardiomyocytes. Western blotting using anti-Kir6.2 and anti-SUR2A antibodies was performed on cardiac membrane fraction. Tissue and cells were harvested from young and old, male and female guinea-pigs. RT-PCR analysis did not reveal significant age-related changes in levels of Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 mRNAs. However, levels of SUR2A were significantly lower in old than in young females. Such age-differences were not observed with cardiac tissue from male animals. In both old and young males, pinacidil (100 microM) induced outward currents. The difference between current density of pinacidil-sensitive component in females, but not males, was statistically significant. Western blotting analysis revealed higher levels of Kir6.2 and SUR2A proteins in cardiac membrane fraction from young than old females.

{"title": "Stimulation of collagen production by transforming growth factor-beta1 during differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to elucidate how transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) can stimulate collagen deposition in cardiac tissue by interstitial cells via stimulation of fibroblasts, via myofibroblasts, or via differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. The dose- and time-dependent stimulation of collagen production and of expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), a marker of myofibroblasts, was studied in cultures of second-passage adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. The TGF-beta(1)-stimulated collagen production is positively correlated (r=0.68, P<0.001) with the appearance of alpha-SMA. Only at high concentrations (40 to 600 pmol/L) and after a long time (24 to 48 hours) of incubation, TGF-beta(1) increases the collagen production and stimulates the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. The maximal stimulation of the collagen production (2-fold, P<0.001) observed after incubation of cultures of fibroblasts with 600 pmol/L TGF-beta(1) for 48 hours is accompanied by a maximal stimulation of alpha-SMA expression (3.5-fold, P<0.001), when cultures consist mainly of myofibroblasts. The stimulation of collagen production cannot be reversed either after additional incubation of TGF-beta(1)-stimulated second-passage cultures for 2 days or in their offspring in the next third passage after incubation for 7 days without TGF-beta(1). The increased collagen production in these third-passage cultures cannot be further stimulated by TGF-beta(1). Our data suggest that TGF-beta(1)-stimulated collagen production in cultures of adult rat cardiac ventricular fibroblasts cannot be explained by a direct stimulation of the collagen production either in fibroblasts or in myofibroblasts. Instead, TGF-beta(1) induces the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which have a higher activity for collagen production than fibroblasts.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2002-02-16", "authors": ["Victor VPetrov", "Robert HFagard", "Paul JLijnen"], "doi": "10.1161/hy0202.103268"}

Fifteen patients had persistent AF (> or =6 months), and the remaining 15 patients had no history of AF. ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM15 expression was analyzed quantitatively at the mRNA and protein levels. ADAM expression was localized by immunohistochemistry. ADAM expression was correlated with amounts of integrins beta1 and beta3. The amount of ADAM10 protein more than doubled during AF (82+/-15 versus 36+/-8 U; P<0.01). Amounts of ADAM15 protein (102+/-12 versus 40+/-6 U; P<0.01) and mRNA (24.0+/-5.6 versus 10.5+/-2.5 U; P<0.05) increased significantly during AF compared with sinus rhythm.

The suitability of engineered heart tissue (EHT) for both in vitro and in vivo applications will depend on the degree of syncytoid tissue formation and cardiac myocyte differentiation in vitro, contractile function, and electrophysiological properties. Here, we demonstrate that cardiac myocytes from neonatal rats, when mixed with collagen I and matrix factors, cast in circular molds, and subjected to phasic mechanical stretch, reconstitute ring-shaped EHTs that display important hallmarks of differentiated myocardium. Comparative histological analysis of EHTs with native heart tissue from newborn, 6-day-old, and adult rats revealed that cardiac cells in EHTs reconstitute intensively interconnected, longitudinally oriented, cardiac muscle bundles with morphological features resembling adult rather than immature native tissue. Confocal and electron microscopy demonstrated characteristic features of native differentiated myocardium; some of these features are absent in myocytes from newborn rats: (1) highly organized sarcomeres in registry; (2) adherens junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes; (3) a well-developed T-tubular system and dyad formation with the sarcoplasmic reticulum; and (4) a basement membrane surrounding cardiac myocytes. Accordingly, EHTs displayed contractile characteristics of native myocardium with a high ratio of twitch (0.4 to 0.8 mN) to resting tension (0.1 to 0.3 mN) and a strong beta-adrenergic inotropic response. Action potential recordings demonstrated stable resting membrane potentials of -66 to -78 mV, fast upstroke kinetics, and a prominent plateau phase.

{"title": "Frequency analysis of ventricular fibrillation in Swine ventricles.", "abstract": "It has been suggested from frequency analysis that cardiac fibrillation is driven by stable intramural reentry, with wavebreak occurring due to failure of 1:1 propagation. We tested this hypothesis with a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Optical mapping was performed on epicardial, endocardial, and transmural cut surfaces of fibrillating swine ventricles. Wavelets were characterized, the frequency content of optical signals analyzed, and space-time plots (STPs) constructed to detect Wenckebach-like conduction. The findings were compared with simulations in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue using the Luo-Rudy action potential model. The incidence of reentry in the cut transmural surface (11.8% in right ventricle, 14.3% in left ventricle) was similar to that on the endocardial surface (13.1%, P=NS) but greater than on the epicardial surface (7.7%, P<0.01). Frequency spectra of optically recorded membrane voltage were organized into spatial domains with the same dominant frequency, but these domains were nonstationary. In STPs, pseudo-2:1 conduction block was caused by double potentials arising when reentry occurred on the recording site rather than true Wenckebach conduction. The latter was observed in 11 of 166 STPs but did not occur at borders of high-to-low frequency domains. In simulations, similar findings were obtained when action potential duration (APD) restitution slope was steep. Stationary dominant frequency domains with Wenckebach conduction patterns were observed only in the presence of shallow APD restitution slope and marked nonuniform tissue heterogeneity. In conclusion, stable intramural reentry as the engine of fibrillation was not observed.

We investigated the intracellular distribution of protein nitration during doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in mice. Following in vivo cardiac function assessments by echocardiography, cardiac tissues were prepared for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy 5 days after doxorubicin (20 mg kg(-1)) or vehicle control. Increased cardiac 3-nitrotyrosine was observed using light microscopy in doxorubicin treated animals. Immunogold electron microscopy (55,000x) revealed increased myofibrillar and mitochondrial 3-nitrotyrosine levels following doxorubicin, but cellular 3-nitrotyrosine density was 2 fold higher in myofibrils. We therefore investigated the actions of peroxynitrite on intact cardiac contractile apparatus. Skinned ventricular trabeculae were exposed to physiologically relevant peroxynitrite concentrations (50 or 300 nM) for 1 h, then Ca(2+) induced contractile responses were measured in the presence of ATP (4 mM) or phosphocreatine (12 mM) as high energy phosphate supplier. ATP maximal force generation was unaltered after 50 nM peroxynitrite, but phosphocreatine/ATP response was reduced (0.99+/-0.63 vs 1.59+/-0.11), suggesting selective inactivation of myofibrillar creatine kinase (MM-CK). Reduction of ATP maximal force was observed at 300 nM peroxynitrite and phosphocreatine/ATP response was further reduced (0.64+/-0.30). Western blotting showed concentration dependent nitration of MM-CK in treated trabeculae. Similarly, cardiac tissues from doxorubicin treated mice demonstrated increased nitration and inactivation of MM-CK compared to controls. These results demonstrate that peroxynitrite-related protein nitration are mechanistic events in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy and that the cardiac myofibril is an important oxidative target in this setting.

We suggest a new approach, in which transfected cellular grafts expressing various ionic channels may be used to manipulate the local electrophysiological properties of cardiac tissue. To examine the feasibility of this concept, we tested the hypothesis that transfected fibroblasts expressing the voltage-sensitive potassium channel Kv1.3 can modify the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytic cultures.\nA high-resolution multielectrode mapping technique was used to assess the electrophysiological and structural properties of primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The transfected fibroblasts, added to the cardiomyocytic cultures, caused a significant effect on the conduction properties of the hybrid cultures. These changes were manifested by significant reduction in extracellular signal amplitude and by the appearance of multiple local conduction blocks. The location of all conduction blocks correlated with the spatial distribution of the transfected fibroblasts assessed by vital staining. All electrophysiological changes were reversed after the application of Charybdotoxin, a specific Kv1.3 blocker. In contrast, conduction remained uniform in the control hybrid cultures when nontransfected fibroblasts were used.\nTransfected fibroblasts are able to electrically couple with cardiac myocytes, causing a significant local and reversible modification of the tissue's electrophysiological properties.

We predict that virtual electrode polarization can produce three topologically distinct types of rotors anchored to: (1) transmural I-shaped scroll wave filaments; (2) near-surface U-shaped scroll wave filaments; and (3) intramural O-shaped scroll wave filaments.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2002-01-29", "authors": ["AlexandreSambelashvili", "Igor REfimov"], "doi": "10.1006/jtbi.2001.2456"}
{"title": "Measurement of myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density in clinical studies: a role for positron emission tomography?", "abstract": "The beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart function and has been extensively studied in recent decades. In vitro studies have shown down-regulation of beta-AR density in heart failure and cardiac conditions that may lead to heart failure. As in vitro measurements on cardiac tissue samples do not allow longitudinal and regional assessment of myocardial beta-ARs in humans, new methods are being developed to measure beta-ARs in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Studies using PET and the radioligand [(11)C]CGP 12177 have shown promising results that are in agreement with those of in vitro studies. However, the radiochemical synthesis of [(11)C]CGP 12177 is very demanding, preventing its widespread use. Hence, new radioligands are being developed using simpler methods of radiochemical synthesis. ( S)-[(11)C]CGP 12388 has been presented as a promising new radioligand. So far, in vivo measurements of beta-AR density using PET have mainly been performed to confirm in vitro studies. Using the full potential of PET, performance of regional measurements and longitudinal studies might add further knowledge on the pathophysiological role of the beta-AR in cardiac disease and the effect of interventions. Furthermore, PET might gain a role in the clinical management of patients with abnormalities of cardiac contractile function.", "journal": "European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging", "date": "2002-01-25", "authors": ["R Mde Jong", "P KBlanksma", "Avan Waarde", "D Jvan Veldhuisen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00259-001-0671-7"}

Yet, excessive neovascularization in the retina causes proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the major angiogenic factor expressed in response to hypoxia, we have characterized expression of VEGF and its receptors in retina, renal glomeruli, aorta, and myocardium in insulin-resistant and diabetic states. Methods and Results- The expression of mRNA and protein for VEGF and its receptors, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2, in the myocardium was decreased significantly by 40% to 70% in both diabetic and insulin-resistant nondiabetic rats. Twofold reductions in VEGF and VEGF-R2 were observed in ventricles from diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic donors. In contrast, expression of VEGF and its receptors were increased 2-fold in retina and glomeruli from diabetic or insulin-resistant rats. Insulin treatment of diabetic rats normalized changes in both cardiac and microvascular tissues. Insulin increased VEGF mRNA expression in cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes.\nThe results documented for the first time that differential regulation of VEGF and its receptors exist between microvascular and cardiac tissues, which can be regulated by insulin.

{"title": "Enhanced nitric oxide inactivation and protein nitration by reactive oxygen species in renal insufficiency.", "abstract": "Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with oxidative stress which promotes production of reactive carbonyl compounds and lipoperoxides leading to the accumulation of advanced glycation and lipoxidation end products. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) avidly reacts with nitric oxide (NO) producing cytotoxic reactive nitrogen species capable of nitrating proteins and damaging other molecules. This study tested the hypothesis that CRF results in enhanced ROS-mediated NO inactivation and protein nitration which can be ameliorated with antioxidant therapy. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to CRF (5/6 nephrectomy) and sham-operated controls and fed either a regular diet (vitamin E, 40 U/Kg food) or an antioxidant-fortified diet (vitamin E, 5000 U/Kg food) for 6 weeks. Blood pressure, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), tissue NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, tissue nitrotyrosine (the footprint of NO interaction with ROS), and vascular tissue NO production were determined. CRF resulted in marked elevations of blood pressure, plasma MDA, and tissue nitrotyrosine abundance, but did not change plasma L-arginine level. This was coupled with depressed vascular tissue NO production and reduced immunodetectable NOS proteins in the vascular, renal, and cardiac tissues. Antioxidant therapy ameliorated the CRF-induced hypertension, improved vascular tissue NO production, lowered tissue nitrotyrosine burden, and reversed downregulations of NOS isoforms. In contrast, antioxidant therapy had no effects in the controls. CRF is associated with oxidative stress which promotes NO inactivation by ROS leading to functional NO deficiency, hypertension, and widespread accumulation of protein nitration products. Amelioration of oxidative stress by high-dose vitamin E enhances NO availability, improves hypertension, lowers protein nitration products, and increases NOS expression and vascular NO production in CRF animals.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2002-01-19", "authors": ["Nosratola DVaziri", "ZhenminNi", "FaribaOveisi", "KaihuiLiang", "RajPandian"], "doi": "10.1161/hy0102.100540"}

However, typical in vivo biosensors only approximate endogenous function via the measurement of surrogate signals and, therefore, may often lack a high degree of dynamic fidelity with physiological requirements. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an excitable tissue-based implantable biosensor approach, which exploits the inherent electropotential input-output relationship of cardiac myocytes to measure the physiological regulatory inputs of chronotropic demand via the detection of blood-borne signals. In this study, we report the improvement of this application through the modulation of host-biosensor communication via the enhancement of vascularization of chronotropic complexes in mice. Moreover, in an effort to further improve translational applicability as well as molecular plasticity, we have advanced this approach by employing stem cell-derived cardiac myocyte aggregates in place of whole cardiac tissue. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential of biologically based biosensors to predict endogenous physiological dynamics and may facilitate the translation of this approach for in vivo monitoring.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2002-01-18", "authors": ["Jay MEdelberg", "Jason TJacobson", "David SGidseg", "LilongTang", "David JChristini"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00672.2001"}

To determine whether the R+ enantiomer releases nitric oxide, the ability of amlodipine, its enantiomers, and nitrendipine to release nitric oxide in isolated coronary microvessels and to regulate cardiac tissue oxygen consumption via nitric oxide release was studied in vitro. Amlodipine and the R+ enantiomer released nitric oxide in a concentration-dependent fashion, increasing nitrite release from coronary microvessels by 57 +/- 12 and 45 +/- 5 pmol/mg/20 min at 10(-6) M (p < 0.05 from control). Nitrite release was entirely blocked by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and HOE-140, a B2-kinin receptor antagonist. The S- enantiomer had no effect on nitrite release at any concentration. Amlodipine and the R+ enantiomer also reduced oxygen consumption in canine cardiac tissue in vitro and this was in an L-NAME-blockable manner. The S- enantiomer of amlodipine had no effect. This study shows that the R+ enantiomer of amlodipine is responsible for the release of nitric oxide and not the S- enantiomer (the L-type calcium channel blocking portion of amlodipine). Interestingly, nitric oxide release is dependent on the production of kinins because it is blocked by HOE-140. This study defines a potentially important property by which calcium channel blockers may release nitric oxide and may contribute to their use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2002-01-16", "authors": ["Xiao-PingZhang", "Kit EeLoke", "SeemaMital", "SureshChahwala", "Thomas HHintze"], "doi": "10.1097/00005344-200202000-00007"}
{"title": "Cocaethylene and heart disease during murine AIDS.", "abstract": "Cocaethylene is an active cocaine metabolite believed to play a causative role in the increased incidence of sudden cardiac death in individuals who co-administer alcohol and cocaine. Prolonged and excessive abuse of cocaine and alcohol will result in marked alteration of host immunity to increased susceptibility to infection. To test the chronic direct effect of cocaethylene on the heart function, a conductance catheter system (CCS) was used in vivo in this study. To test whether cocaethylene injection exacerbates coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) cardiomyopathy during murine AIDS, female C57BL/6 mice were infected with LP-BM5 retrovirus and superinfected with CVB3 or CMV. Daily, mice were injected intraperitoneally with cocaethylene in 0.9% saline solution (concentration increased gradually from 15 to 25 mg/ml). Histopathology of heart tissue was analyzed in all groups, and cytokines of spleen were measured in the CMV-infected groups. Results showed there was little effect on the cardiovascular system after cocaethylene injection. Cocaethylene injection during murine retrovirus infection greatly exacerbated the pathogenesis of CVB3 or CMV infection, whereas CMV-infected mice showed relatively moderate cardiac pathology compared with CVB3 infection. Both CMV and retrovirus infection suppressed the Th1 response. Our data suggest that cocaethylene treatment shifts the cytokine balance and suppresses Th1 response particularly, facilitating increased CVB3- or CMV-induced myocarditis.", "journal": "International immunopharmacology", "date": "2002-01-16", "authors": ["YingyingLiu", "SergioMontes", "DongqinZhang", "Ram\u00f3n TomasSep\u00falveda", "QianliYu", "JinZhang", "Douglas FLarson", "Ronald RossWatson"], "doi": "10.1016/s1567-5769(01)00157-6"}
{"title": "The metal-binding properties of DREAM: evidence for calcium-mediated changes in DREAM structure.", "abstract": "DREAM, an EF-hand protein, associates with and modulates the activity of presenilins and Kv4 potassium channels in neural and cardiac tissues and represses prodynorphin and c-fos gene expression by binding to DNA response elements in these genes. Information concerning the metal-binding properties of DREAM and the consequences of metal binding on protein structure are important in understanding how this protein functions in cells. We now show that DREAM binds 1 mol of calcium/mol of protein with relatively high affinity and another 3 mol of calcium with lower affinity. DREAM binds 1 mol of magnesium/mol of protein. DREAM, pre-loaded with 1 mol of calcium, binds 1 mol of magnesium, thus demonstrating that the magnesium-binding site is distinct from the high affinity calcium-binding site. Analysis of metal binding to mutant DREAM protein constructs localizes the high affinity calcium-binding site and the magnesium-binding site to EF-hands 3 or 4. Binding of calcium but not magnesium changes the conformation, stability, and alpha-helical content of DREAM. Calcium, but not magnesium, reduces the affinity of apo-DREAM for specific DNA response elements in the prodynorphin and c-fos genes.

Wikswo et al. (30) explained both types of stimulations by virtual electrode polarization. Make excitation propagates from depolarized regions (virtual cathodes). Break excitation propagates from hyperpolarized regions (virtual anodes). However, these studies were limited to strong stimulus intensities. We examined excitation during weak near-threshold diastolic stimulation. We optically mapped electrical activity from a 4 x 4-mm area of epicardium of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts (n = 12) around the pacing electrode in the presence (n = 12) and absence (n = 2) of 15 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime. Anodal and cathodal 2-ms stimuli of various intensities were applied. We imaged an excitation wavefront with 528-micros resolution. We found that strong stimuli (x5 threshold) result in make excitation, starting from the virtual cathodes. In contrast, near-threshold stimulation resulted in break excitation, originating from the virtual anodes. Characteristic biphasic upstrokes in the virtual cathode area were observed. Break and make excitation represent two extreme cases of near-threshold and far-above-threshold stimulations, respectively. Both mechanisms are likely to contribute during intermediate clinically relevant strengths.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Exacerbation of myocardial injury in transgenic mice overexpressing FGF-2 is T cell dependent.", "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is cardioprotective when added exogenously, stimulates cardiac myocyte proliferation, and is a mediator of tissue repair after injury. Furthermore, transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing FGF-2 in cardiac muscle demonstrate increased resistance to injury in an isolated heart model of ischemia-reperfusion. We investigated how increasing the endogenous FGF-2 levels in the heart affects the extent of myocardial damage induced by isoproterenol in vivo. Histopathological evaluation of hearts after intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol yielded significantly higher scores for myocardial damage in FGF-2 TG lines compared with non-TG mice. After 1 day, FGF-2 TG mouse hearts displayed more cellular infiltration correlating with increased tissue damage. Immunostaining of non-TG and FGF-2 TG mouse hearts showed the presence of leukocytes in the infiltrate, including T cells expressing FGF receptor-1. Treatment of mice with T cell suppressors cyclosporin A and anti-CD3epsilon significantly decreased the level of myocardial injury observed after isoproterenol and equalized the histopathology scores in FGF-2 TG and non-TG hearts. These data demonstrate a direct T cell involvement in the response to isoproterenol-induced injury in vivo. Moreover, the findings indicate that the exacerbation of myocardial damage in FGF-2 TG mice was dependent on T cell infiltration, implicating FGF-2 in the inflammatory response seen in cardiac tissue after injury in vivo.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Despite recent studies from our laboratory demonstrating protection of ischemic hearts by an aldose reductase inhibitor, the presence and influence of aldose reductase in cardiac tissue remain unknown. Our goal in this study was to isolate and characterize the kinetic properties of cardiac aldose reductase, as well as to study the impact of flux via this enzyme on glucose metabolism and contractile function in hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Results demonstrate that ischemia increases myocardial aldose reductase activity and that these increases are, in part, due to activation by nitric oxide. The kinetic parameter of cardiac aldose reductase (Kcat) was significantly higher in ischemic tissues. Aldose reductase inhibition increased glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Aldose reductase inhibited hearts, when subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, exhibited less ischemic injury and was associated with lower lactate/pyruvate ratios (a measure of cytosolic NADH/NAD+), greater tissue content of adenosine triphosphate, and improved cardiac function.

NOS activity (L-[(3)H]citrulline formation), eNOS immunostaining, and caveolin abundance were measured in heart tissue of 23 mongrel dogs before and at 3 and 7 wk of perinephritic hypertension (PHT). Hemodynamic parameters in vivo and endothelial NO-dependent relaxation of macro- and coronary microvessels in vitro were assessed in the same animals. eNOS immunostaining and total calcium-dependent NOS activity decreased at 7 wk in all four heart cavities (in left ventricle, from 17.0 +/- 1.3 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 fmol. min(-1). mg protein(-1), P < 0.001). Caveolin-1 and -3 also decreased in PHT dog hearts. Accordingly, basal vascular tone was preserved, but maximal endothelial NO-dependent relaxation was impaired in all vessels from 7-wk PHT dogs. The latter had preserved systolic function but impaired diastolic relaxation [relaxation time constant (T(1)), 25.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 22.0 +/- 1 ms in controls; P < 0.05]. Peripheral infusion of the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased mean aortic pressure in both groups and reduced diastolic (T(1), 31.9 +/- 1.4 ms) and systolic function in PHT dogs (DP40, 47.5 +/- 2.5 vs. 59.4 +/- 3.8 s(-1) in control animals). In conclusion, both eNOS and caveolin proteins are decreased in the hypertrophic hearts of PHT dogs. This is associated with altered maximal (but not basal) vascular relaxation and impaired diastolic function. Further degradation of cardiac function after NOS inhibition suggests a critical role of residual NOS activity, probably supported by the concurrent downregulation of caveolin.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Water content and its intracellular distribution in intact and saline perfused rat hearts revisited.", "abstract": "Precise estimation of cellular water content is a necessary basis for quantitative studies of metabolic control in the heart; however, marked discrepancies in water spaces of heart tissue are found in the literature. Reasons for this wide diversity are analyzed, and the conclusion is that the most probable value of total intracellular water content is 615 ml H(2)O/kg of wet mass (wm) and intracellular content of dry substance is 189 g/kg wm in intact in vivo rat heart. An extracellular water of 174 ml per kg wm and 22 g of dry mass per kg wm in vascular and interstitium spaces account for the rest of the tissue mass. These values can be directly related to normoosmotic saline perfused hydrated hearts, characterized by water accumulation in the extracellular spaces. Due to essentially intact heart cells, the experimentally determined dry mass, water and metabolite contents of these hydrated hearts can be extrapolated to the original morphological configuration of an intact heart muscle before the onset of edema. Such an 'extrapolated' heart is defined as a standardized perfused heart (SPH). SPH is the heart in its original morphological configuration, characterized by cell density and cellular water contents of the intact heart, but with perfusate in the extracellular spaces. The total cellular water is distributed in the cell compartments of SPH and intact hearts according to volumes of particular compartments and density of their dry mass. The volumes of bulk water phases in different organelles, accessible to diffusion of low molecular metabolites, were obtained after corrections for the fraction of 'bound' water of 0.3 g per g of compartmental dry mass content. The diffusible water spaces are proposed to be 321, 55, 153, 21 and 8 ml/kg wm for myofibrils, sarcoplasm, mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum and nuclei, respectively.
