{"title": "Hamilton energy balance and synchronization behaviors of two functional neurons.", "abstract": "The nervous system is composed of various functional neurons, some of which perceive sound or light, and these physical signals can be converted into bioelectrical signals. From the biophysical point of view, piezoelectric ceramic embedded in neuronal circuits can detect the external auditory waves, while phototube can capture light signals, so as to obtain two functional neurons with auditory recognition and light-dependent recognition. Considering the two identical or different functional neurons are connected by an induction coil to stimulate magnetic field coupling, and there will be energy diversity when they are driven by different initial conditions or external stimulation. Thus, synaptic connections can be activated and awakened in an adaptive manner when field energy is exchanged, and the coupling channel remains open until the energy diversity between neurons is controlled at a limited threshold. For this purpose, a criterion of the coupling strength increases exponentially is proposed to discuss the enhancement of neuronal synaptic connections. It is found that two neurons can be coupled adaptively to achieve complete synchronization, quasi-synchronization or intermittent quasi-synchronization. These results could help in designing functional assistive devices for patients with hearing or vision impairment.", "journal": "Cognitive neurodynamics", "date": "2023-11-17", "authors": ["LiZhang", "LiXiong", "XinleiAn", "QianqianShi"], "doi": "10.1007/s11571-022-09908-w\n10.1007/s11064-012-0807-0\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110587\n10.1016/j.chaos.2017.11.025\n10.1007/s11071-020-05529-2\n10.1038/sj.npp.1301559\n10.1016/S0006-3495(61)86902-6\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2020.164993\n10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004716\n10.1007/s11071-019-05155-7\n10.1631/FITEE.1900606\n10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109533\n10.1007/s11431-017-9217-x\n10.1016/j.chaos.2022.112149\n10.1142/S0217979216502519\n10.1631/jzus.A1900273\n10.1146/annurev-neuro-090919-022842\n10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.031\n10.1016/j.cub.2014.10.071\n10.1016/S0006-3495(81)84782-0\n10.1142/S0217979221500247\n10.1016/j.physa.2018.02.063\n10.1142/S0217979218502983\n10.1007/s11071-016-3283-2\n10.1007/s11071-017-3396-2\n10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105175\n10.1007/s10948-015-3220-5\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000433\n10.1016/S0165-0270(98)00033-8\n10.1038/s41467-020-15147-6\n10.1007/s11071-019-04909-7\n10.1063/1.5004234\n10.1007/s11071-017-3564-4\n10.1140/epjst/e2019-800193-8\n10.7498/aps.65.240501\n10.1142/S021797922150291X\n10.1088/1674-1056/ac1fdc\n10.1631/FITEE.2100563\n10.7498/aps.70.20210676\n10.7498/aps.65.240701\n10.1038/s41598-018-19858-1\n10.1103/PhysRevE.83.046207\n10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111361\n10.1007/s11071-019-04784-2\n10.1016/j.neucom.2020.09.083\n10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105583\n10.7498/aps.66.200201\n10.1007/s11071-020-05576-9\n10.1016/j.aeue.2019.153050\n10.1007/s11431-019-1547-5\n10.1142/S021798492050267X\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110455\n10.7498/aps.70.20201953\n10.1007/s12043-020-02073-x\n10.1007/s11071-021-06575-0\n10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110751\n10.1007/s11071-022-07282-0"}

Additionally, it has been established that shear waves are more severely affected by the presence of such a zone, compared with longitudinal waves. Our study utilises these phenomena to develop a method able to characterise the fatigue state of steel pipes. Initially, the existing theory regarding the increased sensitivity of shear waves to the presence of fatigue is validated through measuring and comparing the change in propagation speed of both longitudinal and bulk shear waves on flat geometries, at different fatigue states. The comparison is achieved with the aid of ultrasonic speed C-scans of both longitudinal and shear waves, with the latter now being obtainable through our implementation of advances in Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducers (EMAT) technology. EMATs have not been traditionally used for producing C-scans, and their ability do to so with adequate repeatability is demonstrated here; we show that shear wave scanning with EMATs now provides a possibility for inspection of fatigue damage on the inner surface of pressure-containing components in the nuclear power industry. We find that the change in ultrasonic wave speed is amplified when shear waves are used, with the magnitude of this amplification agreeing well with the theory. Following the verification of the theory, the use of EMATs allowed us to tailor the shear wave scanning method to pipe geometries, where C-scans with conventional piezoelectric transducers would not have been possible, with the results successfully revealing the presence of fatigue zones.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2023-04-05", "authors": ["GeorgiosSarris", "Stewart GHaslinger", "PeterHuthwaite", "Michael J SLowe"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3226502"}

The aim of this study was to compare the periorbital edema and ecchymosis after transcutaneous lateral osteotomy in rhinoplasty using 2-mm osteotome versus Piezo scalpel respectively. In a randomized clinical trial and split-mouth-design, we performed primary rhinoplasty in 15 patients (7 men, 8 women; age 18-35\u00a0years, mean age 26.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7\u00a0years). Transcutaneous lateral osteotomy was performed using a 2-mm osteotome on the one side and a piezo scalpel on the opposite side. We took digital photographs of the face on 1, 3, 7 and 14 postoperative days. Three examiners used a standard 5-point Kara-Gokalan scale to assess the early postoperative periorbital edema and ecchymosis on each side. We found more difficult to use the piezo scalpel via only one incision and found easier to use two stab incisions for inserting the piezo scalpel.

In this study, near-field electrospinning was used to prepare a new poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)/Ag nanoparticle (AgNP)/MXene composite nanofiber film as a self-powered flexible human motion-sensing device. The composite film displayed highly piezoelectric properties with the presence of MXene. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the intercalated MXene in the composite nanofibers was evenly spread out, which not only prevented the aggregation of MXene but also enabled the composite materials to form self-reduced AgNPs. The prepared PVDF/AgNP/MXene fibers displayed exceptional stability and excellent output performance, enabling their use for energy harvesting and powering light-emitting diodes. The doping of MXene/AgNPs increased the electrical conductivity of the PVDF material, improved its piezoelectric properties, and enhanced the piezoelectric constant of PVDF piezoelectric fibers, thereby allowing the production of flexible, sustainable, wearable, and self-powered electrical devices.", "journal": "International journal of bioprinting", "date": "2023-02-28", "authors": ["Cheng-TangPan", "KarishmaDutt", "AmitKumar", "RahulKumar", "Cheng-HsinChuang", "Yi-TingLo", "Zhi-HongWen", "Chien-ShuWang", "Shiao-WeiKuo"], "doi": "10.18063/ijb.v9i1.647"}

Processing PVDF into its electroactive phase is a mandatory condition for featuring electroactive behavior and specific (post)processing may be needed to achieve this state, although electroactive phase crystallization is favored at processing temperatures below 60 \u00b0C. Different techniques are used to process PVDF-CFO nanocomposite structures into microspheres with high CFO dispersion, with microfluidics adding the advantages of high reproducibility, size tunability, and time and resource efficiency.

We describe the production of high content electroactive phase PVDF and PVDF-CFO microspheres using microfluidic technology. A flow-focusing polydimethylsiloxane device is fabricated based on a 3D printed polylactic acid master, which enables the production of spherical microspheres with mean diameters ranging from 80 to 330 \u03bcm. The microspheres feature internal and external cavernous structures and good CFO distribution with an encapsulation efficacy of 80% and prove to be in the electroactive \u03b3-phase with a mean content of 75%.

{"title": "Label-free full-field Doppler phase microscopy based on optical computation.", "abstract": "The capability to image subtle mechanical motion at cellular and sub-cellular scales can be used to study how extracellular particles interact with cultured cells and, more generally, how cells interact with their environment. However, current technologies need to provide sufficient spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and motion sensitivity to image cellular and sub-cellular motion in the en face plane. To address this unmet need, we investigate a full-field Doppler phase microscopy (FF-DPM) technology based on an innovative optical computation strategy that enables depth-resolved imaging and phase quantification. In this study, we validated the motion tracking (displacements and velocities) capability of FF-DPM by imaging samples actuated by a piezo transducer (PZT). We demonstrated FF-DPM imaging of magnetic particles under different conditions with different motion characteristics. Our results show that free particles (suspended in a cell culture medium) had a significantly larger magnitude of motion than particles adhered to a cell. The key innovation of this study is the use of an optical computation strategy to perform depth-resolved phase quantification and Doppler measurement. The FF-DPM will have a significant impact, as it provides a unique capability to quantitatively measure subtle motion for models based on cultured cells.", "journal": "Biomedical optics express", "date": "2023-01-27", "authors": ["YuweiLiu", "ShupeiYu", "YuanweiZhang", "XuanLiu"], "doi": "10.1364/BOE.479255\n10.1126/science.121.3141.345\n10.1364/AO.39.002326\n10.1364/OL.29.002503\n10.1364/OL.30.001165\n10.1364/AO.46.001836\n10.1038/s41566-018-0253-x\n10.1109/2944.796340\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2014.03.004\n10.1364/BOE.3.002669\n10.1126/science.1957169\n10.1117/1.2772871\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2017.07.002\n10.1364/BOE.7.000688\n10.1364/OE.11.003116\n10.1167/iovs.13-12318\n10.1364/BOE.3.002162\n10.1364/BOE.8.000828\n10.1364/OE.20.006761\n10.1364/OL.27.000530\n10.1364/OL.35.003432\n10.1364/BOE.449034\n10.1002/lpor.200900047\n10.1364/OL.382045\n10.1364/BOE.2.002175\n10.1364/AO.463843\n10.1364/OPEX.13.000410\n10.1364/AO.40.000268\n10.1063/1.1287627\n10.1117/1.3080133\n10.1364/OE.18.013563\n10.1073/pnas.1212506109"}

{"title": "A novel platform using homobifunctional hydrazide for enrichment and isolation of urinary circulating RNAs.", "abstract": "Changes in specific circulating RNA (circRNA) expressions can serve as diagnostic noninvasive biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa). However, there are still unmet needs, such as unclear types and roles of circRNAs, PCa detection in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by unstandardized methods, and limitations of sample volume capacity and low circRNA concentrations. This study reports a simple and rapid circRNA enrichment and isolation technique named \"HAZIS-CirR\" for the analysis of urinary circRNAs. The method utilizes homobifunctional hydrazides with amine-modified zeolite and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) syringe filtration for combining electrostatic and covalent coupling and size-based filtration, and it offers instrument-free isolation of circRNAs in 20\u2009min without volume limitation, thermoregulation, and lysis. HAZIS-CirR has high capture efficiency (82.03%-92.38%) and a 10-fold more sensitive detection limit (20\u2009fM) than before enrichment (200\u2009fM). The clinical utility of HAZIS-CirR is confirmed by analyzing circulating mRNAs and circulating miRNAs in 89 urine samples. Furthermore, three miRNA panels that differentiate PCa from BPH and control, PCa from control, and BPH from control, respectively, are established by comparing miRNA levels. HAZIS-CirR will be used as an optimal and established method for the enrichment and isolation of circRNAs as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in human cancers.", "journal": "Bioengineering & translational medicine", "date": "2023-01-24", "authors": ["BonhanKoo", "YunlimKim", "Yoon OkJang", "HuifangLiu", "Myoung GyuKim", "Hyo JooLee", "Myung KyunWoo", "Choung-SooKim", "YongShin"], "doi": "10.1002/btm2.10348"}

This article provides an overview of recent developments in the modification of PVDF fibrous structures and prospects for its application with a major focus on energy harvesting devices, sensors and actuator materials, and other types of biomedical engineering and devices. Many sources of energy harvesting are available in the environment, including waste-heated mechanical, wind, and solar energy. While each of these sources can be impactively used to power remote sensors, the structural and biological communities have emphasized scavenging mechanical energy by functional materials, which exhibit piezoelectricity. Piezoelectric materials have received a lot of attention in past decades. Piezoelectric nanogenerators can effectively convert mechanical energy into electrical energy suitable for low-powered electronic devices. Among piezoelectric materials, PVDF and its copolymers have been extensively studied in a diverse range of applications dealing with recent improvements in flexibility, long-term stability, ease of processing, biocompatibility, and piezoelectric generators based on PVDF polymers. This article reviews recent developments in the field of piezoelectricity in PVDF structure, fabrication, and applications, and presents the current state of power harvesting to create completely self-powered devices.

In this work, a new coupling tuning mechanism for regulating the near-open-circuit resonance frequency by changing the effective electrode coverage (EEC) is presented. A linear model of a bimorph piezoelectric cantilever with segmented electrodes is used to evaluate the power harvesting behavior near the open-circuit resonance frequency when EEC changes from 0 to 100%. According to the theoretical analysis, it is found that the variation of EEC brings about the change in coupling strength, which is positively associated with the near-open-circuit resonance frequency of PEH. Two cantilever PEHs with segmented electrodes based on PZT and PZT-PT are constructed for validation of the coupling tuning mechanism. The analytical and experimental results illustrate remarkable improvements in both bandwidth and average power through the coupling resonance frequency tuning method.

{"title": "A Novel Integrated Transdermal Drug Delivery System with Micropump and Microneedle Made from Polymers.", "abstract": "Transdermal drug delivery (TDD), which enables targeted delivery with microdosing possibilities, has seen much progress in the past few years. This allows medical professionals to create bespoke treatment regimens and improve drug adherence through real-time monitoring. TDD also increases the effectiveness of the drugs in much smaller quantities. The use of polymers in the drug delivery field is on the rise owing to their low cost, scalability and ease of manufacture along with drug and bio-compatibility. In this work, we present the design, development and characterization of a polymer-based TDD platform fabricated using additive manufacturing technologies. The system consists of a polymer based micropump integrated with a drug reservoir fabricated by 3D printing and a polymer hollow microneedle array fabricated using photolithography. To the best of our knowledge, we present the fabrication and characterization of a 3D-printed piezoelectrically actuated non-planar valveless micropump and reservoir integrated with a polymer hollow microneedle array for the first time. The integrated system is capable of delivering water at a maximum flow rate of 1.03 mL/min and shows a maximum backpressure of 1.37 kPa while consuming only 400 mW.

{"title": "A Design Method of Traveling Wave Rotary Ultrasonic Motors Driving Circuit under High Voltage Using Single-Sided Hertzian Contact Forced Oscillator Model.", "abstract": "Traveling wave rotary ultrasonic motors (TRUMs) are widely used in various industrial processes due to their attractive features, such as compact structure, high accuracy, and fast response. However, the major limiting factors of the operational performance of TRUMs under high-voltage excitation are the nonlinear behavior caused by the nonlinearities of the piezoelectric materials and the friction between the stator and rotor of the motor. In this study, a nonlinear dynamics model and an identification method are presented to directly design the driver circuit for suppressing the nonlinear behavior under high voltage excitation. Firstly, by studying the time-frequency characteristics of the isolated electrode voltage, a single-sided Hertzian contact forced oscillator model of TRUMs is established, involving the nonlinearities of the piezoelectric material and friction. Secondly, a harmonic balance nonlinear identification is proposed in the time domain for TRUMs. The influence of the voltage and preload on the nonlinear phenomena is discussed. Lastly, a novel driver circuit is proposed to suppress the nonlinearities using feedback from the isolated electrode. Experiments showed that the total harmonic distortion decreased by 89.4% under 500 Vpp. The proposed drive circuit design method is used to find a high excitation voltage and preload to achieve greater motor output power.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors": ["XiaoniuLi", "TianluHuang", "NingZhao", "YoutaoShen", "JiadaHuang", "XuanLi", "JiayiLi", "LinYang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi14010064\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2019.01.041\n10.1109/TMECH.2018.2794379\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2019.03.004\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2119\n10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106518\n10.1515/IJNSNS.2007.8.4.561\n10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106659\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.02.022\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.06.003\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2021.102543\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00013-8\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.696\n10.1007/s11071-010-9673-y\n10.1088/0964-1726/7/3/011\n10.1016/S0043-1648(03)00371-5\n10.1016/j.wear.2015.07.007\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112037\n10.3390/mi13091407\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2760854\n10.1142/S1758825115500313\n10.7567/1347-4065/ab0ba9\n10.1109/TMECH.2010.2050209\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106634\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2007.06.003\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.04.015\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.02.006\n10.1109/TMECH.2015.2392126\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2019.03.001\n10.1007/s11071-010-9784-5\n10.1023/A:1024489210804\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.03.004"}
{"title": "Fundamentals and Applications of ZnO-Nanowire-Based Piezotronics and Piezo-Phototronics.", "abstract": "The piezotronic effect is a coupling effect of semiconductor and piezoelectric properties. The piezoelectric potential is used to adjust the p-n junction barrier width and Schottky barrier height to control carrier transportation. At present, it has been applied in the fields of sensors, human-machine interaction, and active flexible electronic devices. The piezo-phototronic effect is a three-field coupling effect of semiconductor, photoexcitation, and piezoelectric properties. The piezoelectric potential generated by the applied strain in the piezoelectric semiconductor controls the generation, transport, separation, and recombination of carriers at the metal-semiconductor contact or p-n junction interface, thereby improving optoelectronic devices performance, such as photodetectors, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes (LED). Since then, the piezotronics and piezo-phototronic effects have attracted vast research interest due to their ability to remarkably enhance the performance of electronic and optoelectronic devices. Meanwhile, ZnO has become an ideal material for studying the piezotronic and piezo-phototronic effects due to its simple preparation process and better biocompatibility. In this review, first, the preparation methods and structural characteristics of ZnO nanowires (NWs) with different doping types were summarized. Then, the theoretical basis of the piezotronic effect and its application in the fields of sensors, biochemistry, energy harvesting, and logic operations (based on piezoelectric transistors) were reviewed. Next, the piezo-phototronic effect in the performance of photodetectors, solar cells, and LEDs was also summarized and analyzed. In addition, modulation of the piezotronic and piezo-phototronic effects was compared and summarized for different materials, structural designs, performance characteristics, and working mechanisms' analysis.

{"title": "Pulsation Reduction Using Dual Sidewall-Driven Micropumps.", "abstract": "Single-cell manipulation in microfluidic channels at the micrometer scale has recently become common. However, the current mainstream method using a syringe pump and a piezoelectric actuator is not suitable for long-term experiments. Some methods incorporate a pump mechanism into a microfluidic channel, but they are not suitable for mass production owing to their complex structures. Here, we propose a sidewall-driven micropump integrated into a microfluidic device as well as a method for reducing the pulsation of flow. This sidewall-driven micropump consists of small chambers lined up on both sides along the main flow path, with a wall separating the flow path and each chamber being deformed by air pressure. The chambers are pressurized to make the peristaltic motion of the wall possible, which generates flow in the main flow path. This pump can be created in a single layer, which allows a simplified structure to be achieved, although pulsation can occur when the pump is used alone. We created two types of chips with two micropumps placed in the flow path and attempted to reduce pulsation by driving them in different phases. The proposed dually driven micropump reduced pulsation when compared with the single pump. This device enables precise particle control and is expected to contribute to less costly and easier cell manipulation experiments.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors": ["TakutoAtsumi", "ToshioTakayama", "MakotoKaneko"], "doi": "10.3390/mi14010019\n10.1063/1.3567888\n10.1039/C7LC00546F\n10.1088/0953-8984/23/18/184116\n10.1088/1464-4258/9/8/S02\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.04.015\n10.1039/C4LC01100G\n10.1039/c3lc51003d\n10.1007/s10404-008-0399-9\n10.1007/s10404-018-2046-4\n10.1109/JMEMS.2019.2953290\n10.1002/elps.202000313\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2008.06.015\n10.1039/b911412m\n10.3390/mi10020112\n10.1063/1.2209999\n10.1246/cl.170217\n10.1002/elps.201600500\n10.1017/S1727719100000575\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.126669\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.06.026\n10.1038/s41598-017-10785-1\n10.1016/S0925-4005(02)00468-9\n10.1002/bit.10787\n10.3390/mi12121459\n10.3390/s22031273\n10.1126/science.1109173\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.09.008\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.04.005\n10.1063/5.0032377\n10.1126/science.288.5463.113\n10.3390/mi13020294"}
{"title": "Matching the Optimal Operating Mode of Polydimethylsiloxane Check Valves by Tuning the Resonant Frequency of the Resonator in a Piezoelectric Pump for Improved Output Performance.", "abstract": "This paper proposes to improve the output performance of a piezoelectric pump by matching the resonant frequency of the resonator to the optimal operating mode of bridge-type polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) check valves. Simulation analyses reveal that the side-curling mode of the PDMS valve is conducive to liquid flow and exhibits a faster frequency response compared with the first bending mode. The first bending resonant frequency of a beam-type piezoelectric resonator was tuned close to the side-curling mode of the PDMS valve by adjusting the weight of two mass blocks installed on both ends of the resonator, so that both the resonator and the valve could work at their best conditions. Experiments were conducted on a detachable prototype piezoelectric pump using PDMS valves with three different lengths. The results confirm that the peak flowrate at the resonant point of the pump reaches its maximum when the resonant frequencies between the resonator and the valve are matched.

A macro-fibre composite energy harvester was studied as an advanced, flexible, high-performance energy material. Gaussian white noise, and single-frequency and multi-frequency excitation were used to investigate nonlinearity and multiple-frequency interactions. Using single low and high frequencies, we identified the nonlinearity of the harvester's vibration. Multi-frequency excitation with a series of low-to-high-frequency harmonics mimicked the practical vibration signal. Under such multi-frequency excitation, the harvester's nonlinear behaviour was studied. Finally, the interaction effects among multiple frequencies were identified. The results show that under pure resonant excitation, high-level vibration led to high-level mechanical strain, which caused nonlinear vibration behaviour. Moreover, it was shown that the different harmonics excited the various structure bending modes, which caused the nonlinearity of multi-frequency excitation. The first four harmonics of the real-time signal were important. The experimental results emphasise the resonant nonlinearity and interactions of multi-frequency excitation effects.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors": ["MajidKhazaee"], "doi": "10.3390/mi14010001\n10.3390/s22093395\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.012\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111634\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105567\n10.3390/s20123512\n10.1016/j.seta.2022.102228\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/11/115005\n10.1016/j.apm.2021.03.032\n10.3390/ma14195816\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/5/030\n10.1109/MPRV.2005.14\n10.1109/COMST.2017.2691551\n10.1063/1.4900845\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113567\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104978\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.073\n10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00248-7\n10.1177/1077546319855162\n10.2514/3.4506\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab36e4\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.05.016\n10.1007/978-3-319-69823-6_27\n10.1155/2017/8098591\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116427\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116427\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.951.3\n10.1063/1.1427403\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/4/045023\n10.1007/s11071-011-0064-9\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2017.08.048"}

Despite the membrane separation technique having a promising application in wastewater purification, the membrane fabrication method and separation robustness have remained unsatisfactory until now. Herein, we developed a novel strategy, spacer-assisted sequential phase conversion, to create a patterned polyvinylidene fluoride@polypropylene (P-PVDF@PP) substrate membrane with a multiscale roughened surface. Based on that surface structure, the underwater oil resistance behavior of the P-PVDF@PP membrane was improved. Moreover, owing to the abundant active sites on the P-PVDF@PP surface, the polydopamine/P-PVDF@PP (PDA/P-PVDF@PP) Janus membrane could be readily fabricated via wet chemical modification, which exhibited excellent switchable oil-water separation performance. Regarding surfactant-stabilized oil-water emulsion, the as-prepared PDA/P-PVDF@PP Janus membrane also had robust separation efficiency (as high as 99% in the n-hexane/water, chloroform/water, and toluene/water emulsion separation cases) and desirable reusability. Finally, the underlying mechanism of emulsion separation in the PDA/P-PVDF@PP Janus membrane was specified.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasound Transducer Technology: Recent Advances and Applications.", "abstract": "The objective of this article is to review the recent advancement in piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) technology and the associated piezoelectric materials, device fabrication and characterization, as well as applications. PMUT has been an active research topic since the late 1990s because of the ultrasound application needs of low cost large 2D arrays, and the promising progresses on piezoelectric thin films, semiconductors, and micro/nano-electromechanical system technology. However, the industrial and medical applications of PMUTs have not been very significant until the recent success of PMUT based fingerprint sensing, which inspired growing interests in PMUT research and development. In this paper, recent advances of piezoelectric materials for PMUTs are reviewed first by analyzing the material properties and their suitability for PMUTs. PMUT structures and the associated micromachining processes are next reviewed with a focus on the complementary metal oxide semiconductor compatibility. PMUT prototypes and their applications over the last decade are then summarized to show the development trend of PMUTs.

{"title": "Recent Advances in Self-Powered Wearable Sensors Based on Piezoelectric and Triboelectric Nanogenerators.", "abstract": "Early clinical diagnosis and treatment of disease rely heavily on measuring the many various types of medical information that are scattered throughout the body. Continuous and accurate monitoring of the human body is required in order to identify abnormal medical signals and to locate the factors that contribute to their occurrence in a timely manner. In order to fulfill this requirement, a variety of battery-free and self-powered methods of information collecting have been developed. For the purpose of a health monitoring system, this paper presents smart wearable sensors that are based on triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) and piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG), as well as hybrid nanogenerators that combine piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators (PTNG). Following the presentation of the PENG and TENG principles, a summary and discussion of the most current developments in self-powered medical information sensors with a variety of purposes, structural designs, and electric performances follows. Wearable sensors that generate their own electricity are crucial not only for the proper development of children and patients with unique conditions, but for the purpose of maintaining checks on the wellbeing of the elderly and those who have recently recovered from illness, and for administering any necessary medical care. This work sought to do two things at once: provide perspectives for health monitoring, and open up new avenues for the analysis of long-distance biological movement status.", "journal": "Biosensors", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors": ["ArashRayegani", "MohammadmohsenSaberian", "ZahraDelshad", "JunweiLiang", "MuhammadSadiq", "Ali MatinNazar", "Syed Agha HassnainMohsan", "Muhammad AsgharKhan"], "doi": "10.3390/bios13010037\n10.3390/en14185600\n10.1109/MIM.2021.9448251\n10.1016/j.egyr.2021.09.085\n10.1155/2021/9953416\n10.3390/jmse10010005\n10.1016/j.seta.2022.102022\n10.3390/en15031069\n10.3390/s20133730\n10.1007/s00521-013-1342-x\n10.1002/adhm.202070031\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107722\n10.1063/5.0064300\n10.3390/ma14226882\n10.1080/13632469.2020.1822230\n10.1016/j.istruc.2022.07.085\n10.1002/aenm.201901320\n10.3390/bios12090697\n10.1016/j.cap.2020.11.001\n10.1016/j.seta.2022.102644\n10.1038/s41598-021-04100-2\n10.1007/s12274-017-1609-0\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.02.073\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.096\n10.1007/s40820-017-0185-x\n10.1126/sciadv.1501478\n10.1126/sciadv.1601314\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.07.015\n10.1002/adhm.201701298\n10.1039/C7TA10175A\n10.1039/C8TA07784C\n10.1021/acsami.9b19721\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.02.052\n10.1021/acsnano.9b00140\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.069\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106580\n10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103556\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.02.057\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107130\n10.1002/adfm.202200570\n10.1016/j.cej.2022.138549\n10.3389/fnbot.2022.840594\n10.1016/j.bspc.2022.103658\n10.3390/app12062828\n10.1109/JIOT.2021.3051060\n10.1109/JSYST.2022.3173538\n10.1038/s41467-022-29962-6\n10.1002/aenm.201602832\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.05.082\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105383\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104546\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.02.054\n10.1002/adma.201503407\n10.1016/j.measurement.2022.112010\n10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100657\n10.1002/adfm.201907312\n10.1021/acsnano.7b00396\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106015\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106612\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105387\n10.3390/s18061713\n10.1002/advs.201900149\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.06.040\n10.1002/adma.201702648\n10.1002/adfm.200800541\n10.1002/adma.201705918\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105303\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.07.053\n10.3390/molecules24101903\n10.1080/00405000.2019.1678558\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2274151\n10.1039/C3EE43987A\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/JNanoR.29.1\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.080\n10.1021/acsaelm.1c00165\n10.1016/j.nantod.2020.100882\n10.1007/s40820-020-00575-2\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105769\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.04.035\n10.1021/acsnano.5b02010\n10.1021/acsami.0c12709\n10.1021/acsaelm.2c00118\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107511\n10.1039/C9NR00083F\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105405\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105385\n10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.064\n10.1038/s41467-021-22663-6\n10.1021/acsaem.2c02521\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111796\n10.1021/acsanm.0c01551\n10.1021/acsaelm.9b00363\n10.3390/polym12112697\n10.1007/s12274-021-3322-2\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.02.034\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00998\n10.1007/s40820-021-00649-9\n10.1002/ente.202200063\n10.34133/2021/7248579\n10.1021/acsnano.8b08329"}
{"title": "Engineering Dental Tissues Using Biomaterials with Piezoelectric Effect: Current Progress and Future Perspectives.", "abstract": "Dental caries and traumatic injuries to teeth may cause irreversible inflammation and eventual death of the dental pulp. Nevertheless, predictably, repair and regeneration of the dentin-pulp complex remain a formidable challenge. In recent years, smart multifunctional materials with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and pro-regenerative properties have emerged as promising approaches to meet this critical clinical need. As a unique class of smart materials, piezoelectric materials have an unprecedented advantage over other stimuli-responsive materials due to their inherent capability to generate electric charges, which have been shown to facilitate both antimicrobial action and tissue regeneration.

The polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane system was applied to examine the influence of coagulation bath temperature change on the skin-sublayer of the membrane structure, thereby elucidating the development process of membrane structure under different conditions and shedding light on the most suitable coagulation bath temperature ranges. It was found that as coagulation bath temperature increased, the number of interface pores in the outer skin layer decreased, but the size increased. As a result, it changed from the crack shape to round-hole shape, thus making the pore structure looser. In the sublayer, the mesh support structure was increased, which enhanced the mechanical strength of the membrane. Relevant experiments also verify the effectiveness of the model.", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2023-01-17", "authors": ["PingFang", "ShurongCui", "ZhaoyangSong", "LongtaoZhu", "MingshanDu", "ChaoyuYang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.2c06983\n10.1007/s11705-016-1561-7\n10.1016/j.coche.2013.04.003\n10.1021/acsomega.0c05982\n10.1002/aic.15076\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.122368\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.09.064\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141528\n10.1021/acsami.8b13589\n10.1016/0376-7388(96)00088-9\n10.1295/polymj.24.737\n10.1002/pol.1979.180170312\n10.1002/app.1986.070310837\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)82040-2\n10.1002/polb.1994.090320813\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.05.050\n10.1016/j.memsci.2022.120597\n10.1016/j.seppur.2021.120106\n10.1209/0295-5075/19/3/001\n10.1016/0956-7151(94)90482-0\n10.1021/ma00163a006\n10.1016/0920-5632(88)90043-6\n10.1039/D0RA07592B\n10.1021/acs.cgd.5b00908\n10.1007/s00289-015-1324-5\n10.57262/die/1367329670\n10.1063/1.1744102\n10.1016/0001-6160(62)90114-1\n10.1016/0001-6160(79)90196-2\n10.1021/ja01639a090\n10.1016/S0376-7388(97)00142-7\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.05.002\n10.1021/jp411471r\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)81159-X\n10.1002/aic.690010222\n10.1002/pen.11009\n10.1016/j.memsci.2005.05.030\n10.1002/app.28169\n10.1007/s12221-014-1429-8\n10.1590/S1516-14392012005000115\n10.1016/S0011-9164(00)80207-6"}
{"title": "Optimization Analysis of Particle Separation Parameters for a Standing Surface Acoustic Wave Acoustofluidic Chip.", "abstract": "Microparticle separation technology is an important technology in many biomedical and chemical engineering applications from sample detection to disease diagnosis. Although a variety of microparticle separation techniques have been developed thus far, surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based microfluidic separation technology shows great potential because of its high throughput, high precision, and integration with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels. In this work, we demonstrate an acoustofluidic separation chip that includes a piezoelectric device that generates tilted-angle standing SAWs and a permanently bonded PDMS microchannel. We established a mathematical model of particle motion in the microchannel, simulated the particle trajectory through finite element simulation and numerical simulation, and then verified the validity of the model through acoustophoresis experiments. To improve the performance of the separation chip, the influences of particle size, flow rate, and input power on the particle deflection distance were studied. These parameters are closely related to the separation purity and separation efficiency. By optimizing the control parameters, the separation of micron and submicron particles under different throughput conditions was achieved. Moreover, the separation samples were quantitatively analyzed by digital light scattering technology and flow cytometry, and the results showed that the maximum purity of the separated particles was \u223c95%, while the maximum efficiency was \u223c97%.", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2023-01-17", "authors": ["JunlongHan", "HongHu", "YulinLei", "QingyunHuang", "ChenFu", "ChenhuiGai", "JiaNing"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.2c04273\n10.1109/jbhi.2014.2356402\n10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.119\n10.1038/s41378-021-00244-3\n10.1038/35042517\n10.1039/c0an00609b\n10.1016/j.trac.2019.06.034\n10.1039/c6lc01045h\n10.1039/c2lc21304d\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.014\n10.1039/c3lc51367j\n10.1039/c7lc00691h\n10.1039/c0lc00225a\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.05.023\n10.1002/elps.201400084\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.024301\n10.1002/bit.26270\n10.1063/1.3661129\n10.1039/c2lc40751e\n10.3390/s120100905\n10.1039/c8an01061g\n10.1039/b915999c\n10.1016/j.aca.2017.02.017\n10.1039/c3lc50451d\n10.1039/c6lc01142j\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00605\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.08.020\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03580\n10.1039/c7ra01168g\n10.1039/c8lc01155a\n10.1021/ac402607p\n10.1039/c7lc00715a\n10.1007/s42242-020-00071-x\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01827\n10.1038/s41378-019-0064-3\n10.1007/s10404-014-1380-4\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b02746\n10.1039/c5lc01335f\n10.1039/c6lc00590j\n10.1039/c5lc00706b\n10.1063/1.5024888\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112731\n10.1021/ac4017715\n10.3390/s17010106\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b00525\n10.1039/d0lc00106f\n10.1002/adfm.201606039\n10.1073/pnas.1709210114\n10.1039/c6lc00951d\n10.1073/pnas.1413325111\n10.1073/pnas.1504484112\n10.1002/smll.201801131\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.06.006\n10.1109/tuffc.2021.3101248\n10.35848/1347-4065/ab8d4d\n10.1039/c5lc00231a\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2021.105651"}

Over the past few decades, the application of US has increased substantially in endodontics owing to the predictable prognosis and ease of operation. The objective of this survey was to determine the knowledge, practice, and attitude of US in endodontics among the general practitioners, postgraduates, and endodontists. An electronic questionnaire containing 16 questions regarding the knowledge, attitude, and practice of US in endodontics was circulated among the general dentists, postgraduates, and endodontists and the responses were collected online. Data were statistically examined using IBM SPSS software. A total of 202 dentists (general dentists = 92, endodontists = 77, and postgraduates = 33) participated in the survey. Eighty-nine percent of them were aware of the use of US in endodontics, 36.1% of them preferred using US in the removal of pulp chamber calcifications, pulp stones, access refinement, and troughing hidden canals, and 61.4% chose <3% sodium hypochlorite for root canal irrigation with US. The cost of the ultrasonic unit and heat generation during procedures were considered the greatest limitation in using the US. The majority of the dentists were well aware of the use of US and its advantages in various endodontic procedures but they did not use it routinely in their practice. The use of US has been reported to have greatly increased the predictability of endodontic treatment.", "journal": "Journal of advanced pharmaceutical technology & research", "date": "2023-01-17", "authors": ["NishithaArun", "SindhuRamesh", "AnjaliSankar"], "doi": "10.4103/japtr.japtr_242_22"}

Tuina, also known as massage and manual therapy, has been used to treat pain in China for thousands of years. It has been clinically proven to be effective in the treatment of pNP caused by cervical spondylosis, lumbar disc herniation, etc. However, its analgesic mechanism is still not clear and has been the focus of research. In this review, we summarize the existing research progress, so as to provide guidance for clinical and basic studies. The analgesic mechanism of tuina is mainly manifested in suppressing peripheral inflammation by regulating the TLR4 pathway and miRNA, modulating ion channels (such as P2X3 and piezo), inhibiting the activation of glial cells, and adjusting the brain functional alterations. Overall, tuina has an analgesic effect by acting on different levels of targets, and it is an effective therapy for the treatment of pNP.

{"title": "Optimization of the Polarization Profile of Conical-Shaped Shells Piezoelectric Sensors.", "abstract": "Conical shell structures are frequently submitted to severe static and dynamic mechanical loads that can result in situations that affect the service of the systems that are part of, or even cause catastrophic failures. For this reason, a common solution is to design an active deformation control system, usually using piezoelectric patches strategically distributed along the surface of the shell structure. Moreover, these elements may be part of an energy recovery system. This paper details the methodology to topologically optimize the placement of piezoelectric elements through a characteristic function, analysing static and free vibration loading cases by means of the finite element method. Then, the optimal arrangement of the electrode with different polarization profiles is distributed throughout the entire structure. The nature of the loading cases studied corresponds to a general situation where static loads and dynamics vibration are considered. The objective function of the problem only depends linearly on the displacement fields, and therefore, the optimal electrode profile can be obtained for any combination of loads. As a consequence, this technique allows for maximising the electric charge obtained, which results in a greater capacity for monitoring, actuation and/or energy harvesting.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-01-09", "authors": ["SergioHorta Mu\u00f1oz", "DavidRuiz"], "doi": "10.3390/s23010442\n10.1177/1077546305058652\n10.2514/1.J059518\n10.1177/1077546311429055\n10.1016/j.jsv.2005.09.017\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.113107\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.115031\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/1/015016\n10.1177/1045389X18770905\n10.1080/15376494.2018.1432791\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2009.02.003\n10.1177/1461348417744304\n10.1177/1077546321996922\n10.1038/s41598-022-06905-1\n10.1080/15376494.2022.2081890\n10.1115/1.2892008\n10.1007/s00158-008-0279-7\n10.1002/nme.2757\n10.1007/s00158-013-0923-8\n10.1007/s00158-015-1354-5\n10.3390/math10152753\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2022.106936"}
{"title": "A Rapid Prototyping Method for Sub-MHz Single-Element Piezoelectric Transducers by Using 3D-Printed Components.", "abstract": "We present a rapid prototyping method for sub-megahertz single-element piezoelectric transducers by using 3D-printed components. In most of the early research phases of applying new sonication ideas, the prototyping quickness is prioritized over the final packaging quality, since the quickness of preliminary demonstration is crucial for promptly determining specific aims and feasible research approaches. We aim to develop a rapid prototyping method for functional ultrasonic transducers to overcome the current long lead time (>a few weeks). Here, we used 3D-printed external housing parts considering a single matching layer and either air backing or epoxy-composite backing (acoustic impedance > 5 MRayl). By molding a single matching layer on the top surface of a piezoceramic in a 3D-printed housing, an entire packaging time was significantly reduced (<26 h) compared to the conventional methods with grinding, stacking, and bonding. We demonstrated this prototyping method for 590-kHz single-element, rectangular-aperture transducers for moderate pressure amplitudes (mechanical index > 1) at focus with temporal pulse controllability (maximum amplitude by <5-cycle burst). We adopted an air-backing design (Type A) for efficient pressure outputs, and bandwidth improvement was tested by a tungsten-composite-backing (Type B) design.

What this methodology takes into account is the amplitude and frequency analyses discussed in the article, as well as a sensing system based on diverse piezoelectric and magnetic phenomena, the Doppler effect, etc. Both contact and non-contact (laser measurement) methods were used during the tests. The purpose of the tests conducted at the stand, originally designed by the authors in accordance with the methodology proposed, was to evidence that using the innovative and patented, highly torsionally flexible metal clutch makes it possible to reduce the vibrations of multi-stage toothed gears, consequently reducing the forces affecting the gear bearings and those acting at the tooth space, which is to enable the service life of individual components of the power transmission systems intended for mining scraper conveyors to be significantly extended. Based on the studies and analyses performed by the authors, one can observe and conclude that the methodology proposed in the paper makes it possible to use an example of a relatively complex power transmission system in order to examine the relationships between the processes at work, i.e., the decline of the linear vibrations of the gear housing (which is undoubtedly positive in power transmission systems) at the expense of increasing torsional vibrations of the innovative clutch, the latter not to be considered unfavourable to users in the case analysed.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-01-09", "authors": ["MariuszKuczaj", "Andrzej NWieczorek", "\u0141ukaszKonieczny", "Rafa\u0142Burdzik", "GrzegorzWojnar", "KrzysztofFilipowicz", "GrzegorzG\u0142uszek"], "doi": "10.3390/s23010287\n10.1515/amm-2015-0078\n10.1515/acsc-2017-0012\n10.29119/1641-3466.2017.111.2\n10.1007/s11668-020-00949-z\n10.1515/amm-2017-0351\n10.2478/amm-2014-0282\n10.3390/coatings9010002\n10.1016/J.ENG.2017.04.003\n10.3390/lubricants10090225\n10.3390/ma15155384\n10.3390/coatings12050604\n10.1080/10803548.2012.11076956\n10.1016/j.engfailanal.2015.06.004\n10.3390/app9091852\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.07.001\n10.1016/j.comcom.2019.12.032\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.04.063\n10.1080/10236198.2016.1254206\n10.1016/j.promfg.2020.07.014\n10.1109/TIM.2019.2902806\n10.1016/j.jsv.2012.06.006\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.07.046\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2018.03.009\n10.3390/s21237808\n10.1080/17480930.2017.1388336\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107065\n10.3390/en15051720\n10.3390/app9071345\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.107668\n10.1016/j.dsp.2017.11.003\n10.1016/j.engfailanal.2020.104798\n10.1016/j.acme.2017.03.001\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2017.11.011\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2018.12.014\n10.1007/s10010-019-00317-w\n10.1007/s40430-021-03188-x\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.06.045\n10.1006/jsvi.1995.0407\n10.1007/s12239-018-0046-8\n10.7494/miag.2017.3.531.93\n10.3390/s22062183\n10.1063/1.4985271\n10.1016/j.jsv.2013.03.009"}

{"title": "Ultrasonic Measurement of Axial Preload in High-Frequency Nickel-Based Superalloy Smart Bolt.", "abstract": "A high-frequency, piezoelectric thin-film sensor was successfully deposited on a nickel-based superalloy bolt by radio frequency magnetron sputtering to develop a smart, nickel-based superalloy bolt. Ultrasonic response characterization, high accuracy, and repeatability of ultrasonic measurement of axial preload in nickel-based superalloy smart bolts are reported here and were fully demonstrated. The axial preload in the nickel-based superalloy smart bolt was directly measured by the bi-wave method (TOF ratio between transverse and longitudinal-mode waves) without using the traditional integration of a longitudinal and shear transducer. A model concerning the bolt before and after tensioning was established to demonstrate the propagation and displacement distribution of the ultrasonic waves inside a nickel-based superalloy smart bolt. The measured A-scan signal presented significantly favorable features including a mixture of transverse and longitudinal mode waves, a pure and broad frequency spectrum which peaked at 17.14 MHz, and high measurement accuracy below 3% for tension of 4 kN-20 kN. For the temporal ultrasonic signal, the measurement envelopes were narrower than for the counterpart of the simulation, justifying the 'filtration' advantage of the high-frequency sensor. Both the TOF change of the single longitudinal-mode wave and the TOF ratio between transverse- and longitudinal-mode waves increased linearly with preload force in the range of 0 kN to 20 kN. Compared with the commercial piezoelectric probe, the proposed probe, based on the combination of a high-frequency, piezoelectric thin-film sensor and a magnetically mounted transducer connector, exhibited high tolerance to temperatures as high as 320 \u00b0C and high repeatability free from some interference factors such as bolt detection position change and couplant layer thickness. The results indicate that this system is a promising axial preload measurement system for high-temperature fasteners and connectors, and the proposed sensor is a practical, high-frequency ultrasonic sensor for non-destructive testing.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-01-09", "authors": ["ShuangLiu", "ZhongruiSun", "GuanpinRen", "ChengLiao", "XulinHe", "KunLuo", "RuLi", "WeiJiang", "HuanZhan"], "doi": "10.3390/s23010220\n10.1016/j.engfailanal.2016.12.018\n10.1186/s10033-020-0431-x\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2021.108329\n10.1590/1679-78254231\n10.1177/1475921720912780\n10.3390/s20185329\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab06dc\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2008.09.005\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.102210\n10.3390/app10248848\n10.1088/1361-665X/ababe1\n10.1109/TIM.2021.3106102\n10.1109/JSEN.2021.3132679\n10.1007/s00170-018-2337-7\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6a8e\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/087001\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2021.108603\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.11.003\n10.1002/advs.202002044\n10.1007/s00170-022-08840-x\n10.1364/AO.457426\n10.1364/AO.463264\n10.1258/ult.2011.011027\n10.1109/78.492555\n10.1115/1.4050354\n10.3390/s22228665"}

{"title": "PET/ZnO@MXene-Based Flexible Fabrics with Dual Piezoelectric Functions of Compression and Tension.", "abstract": "The traditional self-supported piezoelectric thin films prepared by filtration methods are limited in practical applications due to their poor tensile properties. The strategy of using flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric as the flexible substrate is beneficial to enhancing the flexibility and stretchability of the flexible device, thus extending the applications of pressure sensors. In this work, a novel wearable pressure sensor is prepared, of which uniform and dense ZnO nanoarray-coated PET fabrics are covered by a two-dimensional MXene nanosheet. The ternary structure incorporates the advantages of the three components including the superior piezoelectric properties of ZnO nanorod arrays, the excellent flexibility of the PET substrate, and the outstanding conductivity of MXene, resulting in a novel wearable sensor with excellent pressure-sensitive properties.

{"title": "Flexible SbSI/Polyurethane Nanocomposite for Sensing and Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "The dynamic development of flexible wearable electronics creates new possibilities for the production and use of new types of sensors. Recently, polymer nanocomposites have gained great popularity in the fabrication of sensors. They possess both the mechanical advantages of polymers and the functional properties of nanomaterials. The main drawback of such systems is the complexity of their manufacturing. This article presents, for the first time, fabrication of an antimony sulfoiodide (SbSI) and polyurethane (PU) nanocomposite and its application as a piezoelectric nanogenerator for strain detection. The SbSI/PU nanocomposite was prepared using simple, fast, and efficient technology. It allowed the obtainment of a high amount of material without the need to apply complex chemical methods or material processing. The SbSI/PU nanocomposite exhibited high flexibility and durability. The microstructure and chemical composition of the prepared material were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. These studies revealed a lack of defects in the material structure and relatively low agglomeration of nanowires. The piezoelectric response of SbSI/PU nanocomposite was measured by pressing the sample with a pneumatic actuator at different excitation frequencies. It is proposed that the developed nanocomposite can be introduced into the shoe sole in order to harvest energy from human body movement.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-01-09", "authors": ["Bart\u0142omiejNowacki", "JakubJa\u0142a", "KrystianMistewicz", "RomanPrzy\u0142ucki", "GrzegorzKope\u0107", "TomaszStenzel"], "doi": "10.3390/s23010063\n10.1016/j.copbio.2021.07.027\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107682\n10.1016/j.matdes.2022.111195\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.142\n10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100690\n10.1016/j.mtphys.2022.100647\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114710\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.081\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114496\n10.1016/j.mser.2017.05.001\n10.1007/s11029-011-9192-z\n10.1016/j.mtsust.2022.100233\n10.1016/j.sna.2022.113934\n10.1016/j.isci.2022.103782\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.110229\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2020.108478\n10.1007/s40684-019-00144-y\n10.1038/s41928-021-00592-y\n10.3390/en10101483\n10.1038/s41378-021-00248-z\n10.3390/polym12112697\n10.1002/adfm.201801327\n10.1088/1361-6463/aa7b28\n10.1088/1361-665X/aad037\n10.1007/s11664-020-07940-2\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.127974\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104243\n10.1039/C8EE02792G\n10.1038/srep26122\n10.1126/science.1124005\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167393\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.009\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.08.052\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112072\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.113783\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.264\n10.1016/j.matpr.2022.02.514\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2739745\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3045420\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab0cd5\n10.1016/j.measurement.2022.111742\n10.1016/j.matdes.2022.110787\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.628\n10.1088/1742-6596/773/1/012005\n10.1016/j.matpr.2020.04.622\n10.1039/c1jm10255a\n10.1002/adfm.202000151\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2017.06.003\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab20a2\n10.1039/C6TC00613B\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112900\n10.1007/s10570-017-1597-y\n10.1557/PROC-459-231\n10.1115/1.4006881\n10.1021/jacs.8b07844\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2014.01.018\n10.1016/j.polymer.2019.121729\n10.3390/ma13225281\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.146138\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2007.09.003\n10.3390/polym10111246\n10.1049/mnl.2017.0075\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2016.08.015\n10.12989/sss.2013.12.1.055\n10.1021/acsaem.7b00337\n10.1109/ICSD.2013.6619813\n10.1002/app.28139\n10.1002/advs.202002131\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.06.063\n10.3390/ma13040902\n10.1021/acsami.7b16973\n10.1016/j.matdes.2019.108176\n10.1039/C8SE00519B"}
{"title": "Microstructure and Self-Healing Capability of Artificial Skin Composites Using Biomimetic Fibers Containing a Healing Agent.", "abstract": "The aging and damage of artificial skin materials for artificial intelligence robots are technical problems that need to be solved urgently in their application. In this work, poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) fibers containing a liquid agent were fabricated directly as biomimetic microvasculars, which were mixed in a glycol-polyvinyl alcohol-gelatin network gel to form biomimetic self-healing artificial skin composites. The self-healing agent was a uniform-viscous buffer solution composed of phosphoric acid, acetic acid, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na), which was mixed under 40 \u00b0C. Microstructure analysis showed that the fiber surface was smooth and the diameter was uniform. SEM images of the fiber cross-sections showed that there were uniformly distributed voids. With the extension of time, there was no phenomenon of interface separation after the liquid agent diffused into the matrix through the fiber cavity. The entire process of self-healing was observed and determined including fiber breakage and the agent diffusion steps. XRD and FT-IR results indicated that the self-healing agent could enter the matrix material through fiber damage or release and it chemically reacted with the matrix material, thereby changing the chemical structure of the damaged matrix. Self-healing behavior analysis of the artificial skin indicated that its self-healing efficiency increased to an impressive 97.0% with the increase in temperature to 45 \u00b0C.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2023-01-09", "authors": ["QianSun", "XuGao", "SaiWang", "Rong-YueShao", "Xin-YuWang", "Jun-FengSu"], "doi": "10.3390/polym15010190\n10.1126/sciadv.aba9624\n10.1038/nature25494\n10.1002/adfm.202000381\n10.1007/s12369-008-0008-9\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.03.079\n10.1002/adfm.202008020\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.07965.x\n10.1007/s10853-020-05382-z\n10.3390/polym13121991\n10.1021/acsami.9b10100\n10.1021/acsami.9b19272\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.106700\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.08.001\n10.1021/acsnano.1c09732\n10.1088/2053-1591/abf52c\n10.1002/admi.202100742\n10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70205-5\n10.1021/acsami.5b01272\n10.1007/s10965-021-02492-3\n10.1021/ma202461e\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.127189\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122947\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.12.012\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127864\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.03.033\n10.1038/nmat4671\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.125547\n10.1021/acsami.7b03491\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.08.036\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.181\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.01.001\n10.3390/polym14193941"}

{"title": "Modeling of Single-Process 3D-Printed Piezoelectric Sensors with Resistive Electrodes: The Low-Pass Filtering Effect.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing by material extrusion enables the production of fully functional dynamic piezoelectric sensors in a single process. Because the complete product is finished without additional processes or assembly steps, single-process manufacturing opens up new possibilities in the field of smart dynamic structures. However, due to material limitations, the 3D-printed piezoelectric sensors contain electrodes with significantly higher electrical resistance than classical piezoelectric sensors. The continuous distribution of the capacitance of the piezoelectric layer and the resistance of the electrodes results in low-pass filtering of the collected charge. Consequently, the usable frequency range of 3D-printed piezoelectric sensors is limited not only by the structural properties but also by the electrical properties. This research introduces an analytical model for determining the usable frequency range of a 3D-printed piezoelectric sensor with resistive electrodes. The model was used to determine the low-pass cutoff frequency and thus the usable frequency range of the 3D-printed piezoelectric sensor. The low-pass electrical cutoff frequency of the 3D-printed piezoelectric sensor was also experimentally investigated and good agreement was found with the analytical model. Based on this research, it is possible to design the electrical and dynamic characteristics of 3D-printed piezoelectric sensors.

{"title": "Effects of Co-Solvent-Induced Self-Assembled Graphene-PVDF Composite Film on Piezoelectric Application.", "abstract": "A persistent purpose for self-powered and wearable electronic devices is the fabrication of graphene-PVDF piezoelectric nanogenerators with various co-solvents that could provide enhanced levels of durability and stability while generating a higher output. This study resulted in a piezoelectric nanogenerator based on a composite film composed of graphene, and poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as a flexible polymer matrix that delivers high performance, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. By adjusting the co-solvent in the solution, a graphene-PVDF piezoelectric nanogenerator can be created (acetone, THF, water, and EtOH). The solution becomes less viscous and is more diluted the more significant the concentration of co-solvents, such as acetone, THF, and EtOH. Additionally, when the density is low, the thickness will be thinner. The final film thickness for all is ~25 \u00b5m. Furthermore, the- crystal phase becomes more apparent when graphene is added and combined with the four co-solvents.

CNT composite filaments of 3 and 5 wt% were 3D-printed into tensile samples, while the PEEK 10CNT filament was found to be barely printable. The 3D-printed PEEK 3CNT and PEEK 5CNT composites presented piezo-resistive behavior, with an increase in electrical resistance under mechanical stress, and showed an average gauge factor of 4.46 and 2.03, respectively.

{"title": "Size Effect of a Piezoelectric Material as a Separator Coating Layer for Suppressing Dendritic Li Growth in Li Metal Batteries.", "abstract": "Li metal has been intensively investigated as a next-generation rechargeable battery anode. However, its practical application as the anode material is hindered by the deposition of dendritic Li. To suppress dendritic Li growth, introducing a modified separator is considered an effective strategy since it promotes a uniform Li ion flux and strengthens thermal and mechanical stability. Herein, we present a strategy for the surface modification of separator, which involves coating the separator with a piezoelectric material (PM). The PM-coated separator shows higher thermal resistance than the pristine separator, and its modified surface properties enable the homogeneous regulation of the Li-ion flux when the separator is punctured by Li dendrite. Furthermore, PM was synthesized in different solvents via solvothermal method to explore the size effect. This strategy would be helpful to overcome the intrinsic Li metal anode problems.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-01-09", "authors": ["JunghwanKim", "KihwanKwon", "KwanghyunKim", "SeungminHan", "Patrick JoohyunKim", "JunghyunChoi"], "doi": "10.3390/nano13010090\n10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100180\n10.1088/0034-4885/68/6/R02\n10.1016/j.susoc.2021.10.001\n10.1093/forestry/69.3.215\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.12.012\n10.3390/en12061074\n10.1038/nnano.2017.16\n10.1038/s41586-022-05281-0\n10.3390/nano11092275\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.008\n10.1016/j.mattod.2019.09.018\n10.1021/jacs.9b10195\n10.1002/aenm.201902254\n10.1002/aenm.202002736\n10.1021/acsami.8b18660\n10.1016/j.ensm.2020.11.019\n10.1039/C6TA07384K\n10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100751\n10.3390/en5125190\n10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02629\n10.1002/anie.201702099\n10.1039/C8TA02810A\n10.1038/ncomms9058\n10.1016/j.elecom.2009.07.019\n10.1016/j.ensm.2018.06.023\n10.1016/j.carbon.2022.11.101\n10.1038/s41598-019-39237-8\n10.1002/inf2.12097\n10.1149/2.F07122if\n10.1016/j.coelec.2021.100858\n10.2298/SOS0802155V\n10.1038/s41467-021-26859-8\n10.1039/C9TA11527G\n10.1021/acsmaterialslett.9b00289\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116538\n10.1021/acsnano.0c09745\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.07.039\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231728\n10.1016/j.ssi.2012.11.010\n10.1007/s10008-010-1264-9\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.12.059\n10.1021/acsami.5b07230\n10.1002/adfm.201602498\n10.1002/sstr.202200114"}

Based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback gain was optimized. The effect of system vibration damping under different controller parameters, piezoelectric-constrained layer position and excitation signal was studied. The study show that the optimal feedback gain of the controller can effectively balance the control effect and the control cost.

{"title": "Electroactive Hydroxyapatite/Carbon Nanofiber Scaffolds for Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Traditional bone defect treatments are limited by an insufficient supply of autologous bone, the immune rejection of allogeneic bone grafts, and high medical costs. To address this medical need, bone tissue engineering has emerged as a promising option. Among the existing tissue engineering materials, the use of electroactive scaffolds has become a common strategy in bone repair. However, single-function electroactive scaffolds are not sufficient for scientific research or clinical application. On the other hand, multifunctional electroactive scaffolds are often complicated and expensive to prepare. Therefore, we propose a new tissue engineering strategy that optimizes the electrical properties and biocompatibility of carbon-based materials. Here, a hydroxyapatite/carbon nanofiber (HAp/CNF) scaffold with optimal electrical activity was prepared by electrospinning HAp nanoparticle-incorporated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and then carbonizing the fibers. Biochemical assessments of the markers of osteogenesis in human adipose-derived stem cells (h-ADSCs) cultured on HAp/CNF scaffolds demonstrate that the material promoted the osteogenic differentiation of h-ADSCs in the absence of an osteogenic factor. The results of this study show that electroactive carbon materials with a fibrous structure can promote the osteogenic differentiation of h-ADSCs, providing a new strategy for the preparation and application of carbon-based materials in bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-01-09", "authors": ["BaojunSun", "YajieSun", "ShuweiHan", "RuitongZhang", "XiujuanWang", "ChunxiaMeng", "TuoJi", "ChunhuiSun", "NaRen", "ShaohuaGe", "HongLiu", "YangYu", "JingangWang"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24010530\n10.1155/2014/392398\n10.1186/1741-7015-9-66\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2017.05.007\n10.1039/C5BM00350D\n10.1016/j.cej.2022.136508\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.228-229.714\n10.1002/smll.200500095\n10.1038/srep18833\n10.1038/s41598-018-19742-y\n10.1186/s40580-017-0096-z\n10.1016/j.mssp.2015.08.013\n10.1021/nl802855c\n10.1016/j.apmt.2019.07.006\n10.1016/j.diamond.2021.108320\n10.1002/anie.201403794\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.05.014\n10.1016/j.biologicals.2016.09.010\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b00227\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.09.030\n10.1021/acsami.7b13313\n10.1007/s10856-010-4011-y\n10.1038/nm1515\n10.1039/C7RA02410J\n10.1002/adhm.201300126\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04747\n10.1039/D0NR02765K\n10.1186/1478-811X-9-12\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104688\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b06832\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00612\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.04.047\n10.1038/s41586-018-0650-9\n10.1038/nm.3651\n10.1038/nature03890\n10.1039/C5RA07014G\n10.1021/acssensors.0c00428\n10.1038/boneres.2016.9\n10.1038/ncomms11149\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.01.158\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.04.040\n10.3390/biology10040295\n10.1039/C6RA26713K\n10.1002/jcp.26826\n10.1021/acsnano.9b00489\n10.1038/s41413-017-0005-4\n10.1002/adbi.202000247\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.027\n10.1021/nn3004923\n10.3390/cancers11070899\n10.1139/o81-033\n10.1002/jbm.a.36659\n10.3390/app11199082\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106192\n10.1126/science.aaf1343"}

{"title": "Impact of a prestrained graded InGaN/GaN interlayer towards enhanced optical characteristics of a multi-quantum well LED based on silicon substrate.", "abstract": "This paper presents alternate pairs of InGaN/GaN prestrained layers with varying indium compositions, which are inserted between the GaN/InGaN MQW active region and the n-GaN layer in a light-emitting diode (LED) nanostructure in order to obtain enhanced optical characteristics. The device is mounted on a silicon substrate followed by a GaN buffer layer that promotes charge injection by minimizing the energy barrier between the electrode and active layers.

{"title": "Microalgal extract as bio-coating to enhance biofilm growth of marine microalgae on microporous membranes.", "abstract": "Microalgal biofilm is a popular platform for algal production, nutrient removal and carbon capture; however, it suffers from significant biofilm exfoliation under shear force exposure. Hence, a biologically-safe coating made up of algal extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was utilized to secure the biofilm cell retention and cell loading on commercial microporous membrane (polyvinylidene fluoride), making the surfaces more hydrophobic (contact angle increase up to 12\u00b0). Results demonstrated that initial cell adhesion of three marine microalgae (Amphora coffeaeformis, Cylindrotheca fusiformis and Navicula incerta) was enhanced by at least 1.3 times higher than that of pristine control within only seven days with minimized biofilm exfoliation issue due to uniform distribution of sticky transparent exopolymer particles. Bounded extracellular polysaccharide gathered was approximately 23% higher on EPS-coated membranes to improve the biofilm's hydraulic resistance, whereas bounded extracellular protein would only be substantially elevated after the attached cells re-accommodate themselves onto the EPS pre-coating of themselves. In accounting the rises of hydrophobic protein content, biofilm was believed to be more stabilized, presumably via hydrophobic interactions. EPS biocoating would generate a groundswell of interest for bioprocess intensifications though there are lots of inherent technical and molecular challenges to be further investigated in future.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2023-01-03", "authors": ["C YTong", "M XChua", "Win HungTan", "C J CDerek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137712"}
{"title": "ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFICIENCY OF PIEZOELECTRIC AND CLASSIC OSTEOTOMY WHEN PERFORMING SEPTORHINOPLASTY.", "abstract": "The aim: Comparison and analysis of the main intraoperative and postoperative results of piezoelectric and traditional osteotomy in septorhinoplasty.\nMaterials and methods: Examination and treatment were carried out in 40 patients who were divided into two groups. The first included patients who underwent septorhinoplasty using a traditional osteotomy - 20 people (control group). In the second group of patients, piezoelectric surgery was used for septorhinoplasty. This research group consisted of 20 people. All patients of both groups underwent only primary septorhinoplasty by closed and open methods. Piezoelectric surgery was performed using a Japanese VarioSurg3 NSK piezotome.\nResults: The research was conducted on the first day after surgery, 3 days and a week after treatment. The following indicators were evaluated: intraoperative complications (mucosa damage), postoperative complications: (swelling of the eyelids,periorbital ecchymoses, nasal secretion activity, inflammatory reaction of the nasal cavity, postoperative pain). Significantly fewer cases of mucosal damage were detected in the second study group compared to the first. And the severity of postoperative complications in the second group of patients who underwent septorhinoplasty with the help of a piezotome was statistically significantly (p<0.05) lower than in patients of the control group.\nConclusions: Piezoelectric surgery has a number of advantages over traditional osteotomy techniques, such as selectivity of impact on soft tissues, accuracy of bone destruction.

In this work, we develop a focused sub-millimeter ultrasound detector composed of a silicon-photonics optical resonator and a micro-machined acoustic lens.

The restoration and delivery of electrical cues locally through piezoelectric materials have been demonstrated to facilitate osteogenesis in vitro and bone repair in vivo. However, the underlying mechanism by which piezoelectric stimulation promotes osteogenesis and bone repair remains unclear yet, limiting the design and clinical application of piezoelectric materials for bone repair. Herein, a piezoelectric BaTiO3/Ti6Al4V (BT/Ti) scaffold was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis of a uniform BaTiO3 layer on three dimensionally printed Ti6Al4V scaffold. The BT/Ti scaffolds exhibited piezoelectricity and favorable biocompatibility with RAW264.7 macrophages after polarization. In vitro results demonstrated that the piezoelectric effects of the poled BT/Ti scaffolds promoted M2 polarization of macrophages and immunoregulatory osteogenesis of MC-3T3 osteoblasts.

While positive effects have been documented in improving fertilization and degeneration, the outcomes in patients with previous poor results from conventional ICSI remain unclear. It is hypothesized that these patients may benefit the most from this form of insemination.\nThis retrospective paired within-patient cohort study investigated patients (n=72) undertaking PIEZO-ICSI after a previous conventional ICSI cycle resulted in poor outcomes (including low fertilization (<50%), high degeneration (>15%), and/or poor embryo development and utilization). Patients required at least five oocytes collected in both cycles and a period of less than 2 years between the cycles. The outcomes of both cycles were compared in respect to fertilization, degeneration, embryo utilization, and pregnancy rates. Further analyses were applied to patients <38 and \u226538 years of age, with <50% or \u226550% fertilization with conventional ICSI and with <20% or \u226520% utilization with conventional ICSI.\nPIEZO-ICSI resulted in significantly higher fertilization (61.9% vs 45.3%, P<0.0001) and lower degeneration (7.7% vs 18.2%, P=0.0001) when compared to the conventional ICSI cycles. The greatest benefit was seen in patients who had less than 50% fertilization or <20% utilization in their conventional ICSI cycle, with improvements in fertilization and degeneration rates resulting in a significantly higher number of embryos utilized (frozen or transferred) per cycle.\nPIEZO-ICSI improved fertilization, degeneration, and utilization rates in patients with previous poor outcomes from conventional ICSI.

However, the piezoelectric phased array cannot be applied in hazardous environments and online monitoring due to its couplant requirement. The laser ultrasonic technique can readily address these challenging tasks via fully non-contact inspection, but low detection sensitivity and complicated wave mode conversion hamper its practical applications. The laser-induced full-matrix ultrasonic imaging of complex defects was displayed in this study. Full matrix data acquisition and deep learning method were adapted to the laser ultrasonic technique to overcome the existing challenges. For proof-of-concept demonstrations, simulations and experiments were conducted on an aluminum sample with representative defects. Numerical and experimental results showed good agreement, revealing the excellent imaging performance of proposed method. Compared with the total focusing method based on ray-trace model, the deep learning method could create superior images with additional quantitative information through end-to-end networks, which use the hierarchical features and generate details from all the relevant imaging and physical characteristics information.

However, PVDFs' hydrophobic nature requires modifications by incorporating natural polymers. In this study, we focussed on the hybrid electrospinning of PVDF and gelatine and the further introduction of graphene oxide nanoparticles to investigate either hydrophilicity or piezoelectricity enhancement and its impact on mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes. The results revealed a nanofibre diameter of 379\u2009\u00b1\u200973\u2009nm for the PVDF/gelatine/graphene oxide (PVDF-GO-CG) platform, providing excellent tensile strength. Additionally, hydrophilicity was improved by gelatine and GO incorporation compared with pure PVDF. Cellular studies also showed an elongated morphology of cardiomyocytes, similar to the myocardial tissue, as well as high viability and non-toxicity in the PVDF-GO-CG scaffold according to the average survival rate. Furthermore, the expression of connexin 43 and troponin T genes underwent an increment of 41 and 35% in the PVDF-GO-CG compared with the PVDF-CG sample.

{"title": "Piezo protein determines stem cell fate by transmitting mechanical signals.", "abstract": "Piezo ion channel is a mechanosensitive protein on the cell membrane, which contains Piezo1 and Piezo2. Piezo channels are activated by mechanical forces, including stretch, matrix stiffness, static pressure, and shear stress. Piezo channels transmit mechanical signals that cause different downstream responses in the differentiation process, including integrin signaling pathway, ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway, Notch signaling, and WNT signaling pathway. In the fate of stem cell differentiation, scientists found differences in Piezo channel expression and found that Piezo channel expression is related to developmental diseases. Here, we briefly review the structure and function of Piezo channels and the relationship between Piezo and mechanical signals, discussing the current understanding of the role of Piezo channels in stem cell fate and associated molecules and developmental diseases. Ultimately, we believe this review will help identify the association between Piezo channels and stem cell fate.", "journal": "Human cell", "date": "2022-12-30", "authors": ["XiaoleiQiu", "ZhuoyueDeng", "MeijingWang", "YuqiFeng", "LintaoBi", "LishaLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s13577-022-00853-8\n10.18388/abp.2015_1023\n10.1038/ncomms10366\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1038/s41598-017-18089-0\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.7863/jum.2012.31.4.623\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1038/nature15247\n10.1172/jci87343\n10.1016/j.bone.2020.115247\n10.7554/eLife.52779\n10.7554/eLife.49631\n10.7554/eLife.47454\n10.1038/nn.3894\n10.1038/s41586-019-1484-9\n10.1093/molehr/gaz018\n10.1038/s41598-018-38376-8\n10.7554/eLife.33149\n10.1038/s41586-019-1505-8\n10.1038/s41586-019-1499-2\n10.1113/jp274404\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/nature25743\n10.1111/febs.14711\n10.1038/ncomms11984\n10.1186/s13578-020-00522-z\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1038/ncomms8223\n10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.046\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.033\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.08.032\n10.7554/eLife.12088\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.4161/chan.21064\n10.1038/nmat3945\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.06.018\n10.1371/journal.pone.0015655\n10.7554/eLife.52779\n10.7554/eLife.49631\n10.7554/eLife.47454\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.06.018\n10.1038/s41467-019-12501-1\n10.7554/eLife.07369\n10.1038/s41467-018-04405-3\n10.1038/s41467-018-03570-9\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010919-023703\n10.1111/bph.14188\n10.1152/physrev.00032.2008\n10.1038/s41467-017-01712-z\n10.1021/bi200770q\n10.1016/j.bpj.2016.11.013\n10.1074/jbc.M311201200\n10.1113/jp271714\n10.1038/s41598-018-27275-7\n10.1038/s41598-019-51381-9\n10.18632/aging.103448\n10.1007/s00056-016-0061-1\n10.1242/jcs.247643\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183226\n10.2319/123113-955.1\n10.1186/s13287-018-1025-8\n10.1096/fj.201901458R\n10.1038/nature25744\n10.1038/nature21407\n10.1038/s41419-021-03481-6\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00177\n10.18632/aging.202244\n10.7150/ijms.21620\n10.1073/pnas.2001611118\n10.1038/nrm2593\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00958\n10.1016/j.ceb.2019.12.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0071283\n10.1186/1741-7007-10-37\n10.1359/jbmr.041013\n10.1165/rcmb.2005-0103OC\n10.1161/circulationaha.106.670026\n10.1073/pnas.0712353105\n10.1073/pnas.1507309112\n10.1126/science.aab0988\n10.1126/science.1241359\n10.7554/eLife.50684\n10.7554/eLife.44706\n10.7518/hxkq.2020.06.004\n10.1016/j.ceca.2021.102431\n10.1679/aohc.71.131\n10.1074/jbc.M500608200\n10.1002/jcb.22994\n10.1002/stem.3114\n10.1007/s00018-017-2545-6\n10.1359/jbmr.070113\n10.1089/scd.2010.0576\n10.1016/j.exphem.2010.12.001\n10.1002/stem.2370\n10.1038/376737a0\n10.1038/srep45032\n10.1016/j.joen.2017.02.022\n10.1016/bs.apha.2017.08.009\n10.1073/pnas.1919702117\n10.1038/nature06254\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.09.011\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.07.025\n10.1038/ncomms2899\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422253\n10.1152/ajpcell.00346.2018\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.17219/acem/71080\n10.1084/jem.20180483\n10.1165/rcmb.2018-0197OC\n10.1093/ajh/hpz158\n10.1038/emboj.2011.456\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.12.020\n10.1172/jci.insight.125068\n10.1073/pnas.1817070115\n10.1038/ncomms9085\n10.1038/ncomms9329\n10.1016/j.stem.2021.04.002\n10.1073/pnas.1516036113\n10.1038/ncomms2673\n10.1038/nn.4162\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9897\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9892\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.09.019\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.1038/nature20793\n10.1002/ajmg.a.36881\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.015\n10.1073/pnas.1221400110\n10.1126/science.aau6324\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00791\n10.1073/pnas.1412740111"}

In this paper, we present a fully-coupled 3D model of standing SAW acoustofluidic devices for obtaining particle motion. The \"improved limiting velocity method\" (ILVM) was used to investigate the distribution of acoustic pressure and acoustic streaming in microchannel. The results show that the distribution of acoustic pressure and acoustic streaming on the piezoelectric substrate surface perpendicular to the acoustic wave propagation direction is inhomogeneous. The motion of micro-particles with diameters of 0.5-, 5-, and 10\u00a0\u03bcm is then simulated to investigate the interaction of acoustic radiation force and drag force caused by pressure and acoustic streaming. We demonstrate that micro and nanoparticles can move in three dimensions when acoustic radiation force and acoustic streaming interact.

The combination of inorganic nanoparticles and polymers as the artificial SEI layer shows great potential in regulating lithium-ion flux. Here, we design spatially confined LiF nanoparticles in an aligned polymer matrix as the artificial SEI layer. A high dielectric polymer matrix homogenizes the electric field near the surface of lithium metal. Aligned pores with LiF nanoparticles promote the lithium-ion transport across the artificial SEI layer. The synergistic effect of the highly polar \u03b2-phase PVDF and LiF nanoparticles provides high stability over 900 h for the Li//Li symmetrical cell. Besides, a Li//LFP full battery equipped with this artificial layer shows good performance in the commercial carbonate electrolyte, demonstrating the great potential of this protective film in lithium metal batteries.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2022-12-29", "authors": ["TianyangYu", "TengZhao", "NanxiangZhang", "TianyangXue", "YiChen", "YushengYe", "FengWu", "RenjieChen"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c04242"}
{"title": "Control of Fluorescence of Organic Dyes in the Solid-State by Supramolecular Interactions.", "abstract": "Fluorescent organic dyes play an essential role in the creation of new \"smart\" materials. Fragments and functional groups capable of free rotation around single bonds can significantly change the fluorescent organic dye's electronic structure under analyte effects, phase state transitions, or changes in temperature, pressure, and media polarity. Dependencies between steric and electronic structures become highly important in transition from a solution to a solid-state. Such transitions are accompanied by a significant increase in the dye molecular structure's rigidity due to supramolecular associates' formation such as H-bonding, \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 and dipole-dipole interactions. Among those supramolecular effects, H-bonding interactions, first of all, lead to significant molecular packing changes between loose or rigid structures, thus affecting the fluorescent dye's electronic states' energy and configuration, its fluorescent signal's position and intensity. All the functional groups and heteroatoms that are met in the organic dyes seem to be involved in the control of fluorescence via H-bonding: C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N, C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0, S\u2009=\u2009O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H-C, P\u2009=\u2009O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H, C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O, NH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N, C\u2009-\u2009H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C, C\u2009-\u2009H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Se, N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O, C\u2009-\u2009H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F, C-F\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H.

{"title": "Complex Three-Dimensional Terrains Traversal of Insect-Scale Soft Robot.", "abstract": "This article proposes a piezoelectric-driven insect-scale soft robot with ring-like curved legs, enabling it to traverse complex three-dimensional (3D) terrain only by body-terrain mechanical action. Relying on the repeated deformation of the main body's n and u shapes, the robot's leg-ground mechanical action produces an \"elastic gait\" to move. Regarding the detailed design, first, a theoretical curve of the front leg with a fixed angle of attack of 75\u00b0 is designed by finite element simulation and comparative experiments. It ensures no increase in drag and no decrease in the lift when climbing steps. Second, a ring-like leg structure with 100% closed degree is proposed to ensure a smooth pass through small-sized uneven terrain without getting stuck. Then, the design of the overall asymmetrical structure of the robot can improve the conversion ratio of vibration to forward force. The shape of curved legs is controlled by pulling the flexible leg structure with two metal wires working as spokes. The semirigid leg structure made of fully flexible materials has shape stability and structural robustness. Compared with the plane-legged robot, the curved-legged robot can smoothly traverse different rugged 3D terrains and cross the terrain covering obstacles 0.36 times body height (BH) at a speed of >4 body lengths per second. Moreover, the curved-legged robot shows 100% and 64% chances of climbing steps with 1.2- and 1.9-times BH, respectively.", "journal": "Soft robotics", "date": "2022-12-29", "authors": ["YingLiu", "JiamingLiang", "JiangfengLu", "HuiminChen", "ZicongMiao", "DongkaiWang", "XiaohaoWang", "MinZhang"], "doi": "10.1089/soro.2022.0073"}

{"title": "Numerical Analysis of Microchannels Designed for Heat Sinks.", "abstract": "Conjugate heat transfer is numerically investigated using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics approach in various microchannel geometries to identify a high-performance cooling method for piezoelectric ceramic stacks and spindle units in high-precision machines. Straight microchannels with rectangular cross sections are first considered, showing the performance limitations of decreasing the size of the microchannels, so other solutions are needed for high applied heat fluxes. Next, many microchannel designs, focusing on streamwise geometric variation, are compared to straight channels to assess their performances. Sinusoidally varying channels produce the highest heat transfer rates of those studied. Thus, their optimization is considered at a channel width and height of 35 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. Heat transfer increases as the amplitude and spatial frequencies of the channels increase due to increased interfacial surface area and enhanced Dean flow. The highest performance efficiencies are observed at intermediate levels of amplitude and frequency, with efficiency decreasing as these geometric parameters are increased further at the onset of flow separation.

The effects of hPMSCs and their conditioned media on HepG2 are, however, still a mystery. As a result, the goal of this study was to look into the effects of hPMSCs and their conditioned media on HepG2 and figure out what was going on. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and the MTT test were used to determine the percentage of cells that died (early apoptosis, late apoptosis). The DIO and DID colors were used to detect cell fusion and cell death in both cells. HepG2 cells were co-treated with hPMSCs or hPMSCs-conditioned medium (hPMSCs-CM) to reduce growth and promote apoptosis. Morphological changes were also seen in the 30 percent, 50 percent, and 60 percent cases. The secretion of cytokine was determined by the ELISA. Flow cytometry, caspase 9 immunofluorescence, qPCR (detection of Bax, Bcl-2, and \u03b2-catenin genes), western blot, and immunophenotyping revealed that treatment with hPMSCs or hPMSCs-CM caused HepG2 cell death through apoptosis (detection of caspase 9, caspase 3 protein). HepG2 cell cycle arrest could be induced by hPMSCs and hPMSCs-CM. Following treatment with hPMSCs or hPMSCs-CM, HepG2 cell development was stopped in the G0/G1 phase. These treatments also inhibited HepG2 cells from migrating, with the greatest effect when the highest ratio/concentration of hPMSCs (70%) and hPMSCs-CM were used (90%). Our findings indicated that hPMSCs and hPMSCs-CM could be promising treatment options for liver cancer.

An instrumented tire with different sizes of PVDF-based piezoelectric patches and a tri-axial accelerometer attached to its inner liner was used for this purpose and was tested under different conditions on asphalt and concrete surfaces. The results demonstrated that on both pavement types, the generated voltage was directly proportional to the size of the harvester patches, the longitudinal velocity, and the normal load. Additionally, the generated voltage was inversely proportional to the tire inflation pressure. Moreover, the range of generated voltages was slightly higher on asphalt compared to the same testing conditions on the concrete surface.

{"title": "A Tiled Ultrasound Matrix Transducer for Volumetric Imaging of the Carotid Artery.", "abstract": "High frame rate three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging would offer excellent possibilities for the accurate assessment of carotid artery diseases. This calls for a matrix transducer with a large aperture and a vast number of elements. Such a matrix transducer should be interfaced with an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for channel reduction. However, the fabrication of such a transducer integrated with one very large ASIC is very challenging and expensive. In this study, we develop a prototype matrix transducer mounted on top of multiple identical ASICs in a tiled configuration. The matrix was designed to have 7680 piezoelectric elements with a pitch of 300 \u03bcm \u00d7 150 \u03bcm integrated with an array of 8 \u00d7 1 tiled ASICs. The performance of the prototype is characterized by a series of measurements. The transducer exhibits a uniform behavior with the majority of the elements working within the -6 dB sensitivity range. In transmit, the individual elements show a center frequency of 7.5 MHz, a -6 dB bandwidth of 45%, and a transmit efficiency of 30 Pa/V at 200 mm. In receive, the dynamic range is 81 dB, and the minimum detectable pressure is 60 Pa per element.

Specifically, we propose a technique that detects whether there is a diversion on a pipe or not.

We propose to use the Zadoff-Chu sequence to modulate the input signals, then utilize its correlation properties to estimate the pipe channel response. The processed signal is then fed to a DNN that extracts the features and decides whether there is a diversion or not. The proposed technique demonstrates an average classification accuracy of 90.3% (when one sensor is used) and 99.6% (when two sensors are used) on 34 inch pipes.

{"title": "Transient Response of Miniature Piezoresistive Pressure Sensor Dedicated to Blast Wave Monitoring.", "abstract": "Blast waves generated by energetic materials involve very fast time variations in the pressure. One important issue for blast wave metrology is the accurate measurement (typical precision in the range of \u00b15% or better) of the static overpressure peak. For most near field configurations, this measurement requires ultra-fast sensors with response times lower than a few microseconds. In this paper, we design, model, fabricate and characterize a new ultra-fast sensor using piezo-resistive gauges at the center of a miniaturized and rectangular silicon membrane. When a pressure step of 10 bar is applied to the membrane, the signal delivered to the sensor output presents dampened oscillations, with a resonant frequency of 20.6 MHz and quality factor of 24,700 ns after the arrival of the shock wave. After removing undesirable drifts that appear after 700 ns, we may expect the sensor to have a response time (at \u00b15%) of 1.2 \u00b5s.

{"title": "Model Development of a Hybrid Battery-Piezoelectric Fiber System Based on a New Control Method.", "abstract": "By increasing the application of smart wearables, their electrical energy supply has drawn great attention in the past decade. Sources such as the human body and its motion can produce electrical power as renewable energy using piezoelectric yarns. During the last decade, the development of the piezoelectric fibers used in smart clothes has increased for energy-harvesting applications. Therefore, the energy harvesting from piezoelectric yarns and saving process is an important subject. For this purpose, a new control system was developed based on the combination of the sliding mode and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Using this method, due to the piezoelectric yarn cyclic deformation process, electrical power is produced. This power is considered the input voltage to the controlling system modeled in this article. This system supplies constant voltage to be saved in a battery. The battery supplies power for the electrical elements of smart fabric structure for different applications, such as health care. It is shown that the presence of PSO led to the improvement of system response and error reduction by more than 30%.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["Mir SaeidHesarian", "JafarTavoosi", "Tarek IAlanazi"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14245428\n10.1109/JSYST.2021.3077213\n10.3390/su14106183\n10.3389/fenrg.2021.792418\n10.3390/su141811731\n10.1002/adma.200602223\n10.1147/sj.353.0618\n10.3390/s17010130\n10.1080/00405160903465220\n10.1002/aisy.202000184\n10.1088/1742-6596/1907/1/012058\n10.1088/1742-6596/1907/1/012008\n10.1088/1742-6596/1846/1/012087\n10.1002/anie.201409366\n10.1108/IJCST-12-2020-0197\n10.1080/00405000.2017.1369346\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00821\n10.1109/MPOT.2016.2549998\n10.1088/1361-665X/aab865\n10.3390/polym13020174\n10.1016/j.est.2021.102578\n10.3390/electronics11010088\n10.3390/en14196071"}

Membrane scaling and wetting are the drawbacks that prevent the widespread implementation of the MD process. In this study, coaxially electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-co-HFP) nanofibrous membranes were fabricated with re-entrant architecture and enhanced hydrophobicity/omniphobicity. The multiscale roughness was constructed by incorporating Al2O3 nanoparticles and 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H Perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane in the sheath solution. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) could confirm the formation of the core-sheath nanofibrous membranes, which exhibited a water contact angle of ~142.5\u00b0 and enhanced surface roughness. The membrane displayed a stable vapor flux of 12 L.m\u22122.h\u22121 (LMH) for a 7.0 wt.% NaCl feed solution and no loss in permeate quality or quantity. Long-term water recovery from 10.5 wt.% NaCl feed solution was determined to be 8\u221210 LMH with >99.9% NaCl rejection for up to 5 cycles of operation (60 h).

{"title": "Investigation of Ferromagnetic and Ferroelectric Properties in Binderless Cellulose/Ni Laminates for Magnetoelectric Applications.", "abstract": "According to reported polymer-based magnetoelectric (ME) laminates, which generate voltage via an external magnetic field, a binder is indispensable for the adhesion between phases. However, if the binder is excluded, the ME response is expected to improve via efficient strain transfer from the magnetostrictive phase to the piezoelectric phase. Nevertheless, an understanding of the binderless state has not yet been addressed in polymer-based ME laminates. In this study, cellulose/Ni (CN) laminates were designed to obtain binderless polymer-based ME laminates. The surface properties of Ni foil desirable for the anchoring effect and the electrostatic interactions required for binderless states were determined via heat treatment of the Ni substrate. Moreover, to confirm the potential of the binderless laminate in ME applications, the ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties of the CN laminates were recorded. Consequently, the CN laminates exhibited remnant and saturation magnetizations of 29.5 emu/g and 55.2 emu/g, respectively.

{"title": "BN-PVDF/rGO-PVDF Laminate Nanocomposites for Energy Storage Applications.", "abstract": "The increasing demand for high energy storage devices calls for concurrently enhanced dielectric constants and reduced dielectric losses of polymer dielectrics. In this work, we rationally design dielectric composites comprising aligned 2D nanofillers of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) in a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix through a novel press-and-fold technique. Both nanofillers play different yet complementary roles: while rGO is designed to enhance the dielectric constant through charge accumulation at the interfaces with polymer, BNNS suppress the dielectric loss by preventing the mobility of free electrons. The microlaminate containing eight layers each of rGO/PVDF and BNNS/PVDF films exhibits remarkable dielectric performance with a dielectric constant of 147 and an ultralow dielectric loss of 0.075, due to the synergistic effect arising from the alternatingly electrically conductive and insulating films.

{"title": "Triboelectric and Piezoelectric Nanogenerators for Self-Powered Healthcare Monitoring Devices: Operating Principles, Challenges, and Perspectives.", "abstract": "The internet of medical things (IoMT) is used for the acquisition, processing, transmission, and storage of medical data of patients. The medical information of each patient can be monitored by hospitals, family members, or medical centers, providing real-time data on the health condition of patients. However, the IoMT requires monitoring healthcare devices with features such as being lightweight, having a long lifetime, wearability, flexibility, safe behavior, and a stable electrical performance. For the continuous monitoring of the medical signals of patients, these devices need energy sources with a long lifetime and stable response. For this challenge, conventional batteries have disadvantages due to their limited-service time, considerable weight, and toxic materials. A replacement alternative to conventional batteries can be achieved for piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators. These nanogenerators can convert green energy from various environmental sources (e.g., biomechanical energy, wind, and mechanical vibrations) into electrical energy. Generally, these nanogenerators have simple transduction mechanisms, uncomplicated manufacturing processes, are lightweight, have a long lifetime, and provide high output electrical performance. Thus, the piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators could power future medical devices that monitor and process vital signs of patients. Herein, we review the working principle, materials, fabrication processes, and signal processing components of piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators with potential medical applications. In addition, we discuss the main components and output electrical performance of various nanogenerators applied to the medical sector. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of the design, materials and fabrication process, signal processing, and reliability of nanogenerators are included.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["EnriqueDelgado-Alvarado", "JaimeMart\u00ednez-Castillo", "LuisZamora-Peredo", "Jose AmirGonzalez-Calderon", "RicardoL\u00f3pez-Esparza", "Muhammad WaseemAshraf", "ShahzadiTayyaba", "Agust\u00edn LHerrera-May"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12244403\n10.3390/s20236835\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9\n10.1186/s12884-022-04878-7\n10.1177/20552076221081689\n10.1159/000519085\n10.3390/cancers14081884\n10.1177/02692163211024451\n10.2196/34758\n10.1186/s12913-022-07938-y\n10.1016/j.seta.2022.102335\n10.1007/s42979-022-01250-6\n10.1016/j.compeleceng.2022.108210\n10.1109/JIOT.2022.3143704\n10.1109/JIOT.2021.3138516\n10.3390/app12168148\n10.3390/s22155517\n10.3390/s22145401\n10.1016/j.bbe.2022.05.008\n10.3390/bios12030139\n10.1016/j.coelec.2021.100925\n10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3136793\n10.1016/j.biosx.2022.100153\n10.1049/cmu2.12301\n10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3137364\n10.1016/j.compeleceng.2022.108196\n10.1016/j.smhl.2022.100295\n10.1021/acsphotonics.2c00898\n10.1016/j.jobcr.2021.11.010\n10.1016/j.matdes.2022.110406\n10.1039/D1EE00419K\n10.1002/er.3499\n10.1016/j.nantod.2020.101075\n10.1007/s10853-020-05157-6\n10.1016/j.est.2019.01.010\n10.3390/nano12152549\n10.3390/nanoenergyadv2010004\n10.1039/D1NA00501D\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.081\n10.1002/adfm.202101047\n10.1007/s40820-021-00779-0\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133702\n10.1016/j.jmat.2022.04.003\n10.1021/acsaem.2c01314\n10.1021/acsami.2c07297\n10.3390/s22114181\n10.1016/j.cej.2022.138279\n10.1016/j.cej.2022.137491\n10.1021/acsanm.2c02026\n10.34133/2021/9793458\n10.1016/j.cej.2022.139077\n10.1021/acsami.2c04196\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106786\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107719\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107442\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107208\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107199\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01730\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107635\n10.1007/s10854-021-07622-7\n10.1038/s41598-020-68751-3\n10.1002/admi.202200290\n10.1007/s11431-021-1984-9\n10.3390/s21113634\n10.3390/mi12040352\n10.1039/D0NA00536C\n10.1021/acsapm.2c00330\n10.1002/smll.202200952\n10.1016/j.matlet.2020.127686\n10.1016/j.matdes.2019.108176\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107309\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.889364\n10.1002/admt.202100702\n10.1021/acsami.0c12709\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.133620\n10.1002/admt.202000779\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105066\n10.1002/adfm.201801606\n10.1088/2631-8695/ac8529\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107454\n10.1007/s11664-022-09597-5\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107091\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107051\n10.1021/acsnano.1c11321\n10.1038/s41598-022-12390-3\n10.1016/j.tcm.2021.08.001\n10.1093/ons/opaa300\n10.1002/adfm.202203533\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107318\n10.1177/15280837211057575\n10.3389/fenrg.2022.900534\n10.1002/er.7585\n10.1038/s41467-021-24417-w\n10.1002/adfm.202105169\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106123\n10.1002/advs.202004023\n10.1016/j.matt.2021.01.006\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105566\n10.1155/2021/6074657\n10.1016/j.nantod.2020.100882\n10.1016/j.joule.2020.05.003\n10.1016/j.scib.2019.07.001\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.05.047\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.071\n10.1021/acsnano.8b08329\n10.1007/s12274-019-2443-3\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105029\n10.1002/adma.201907336\n10.1002/admt.202101332\n10.1038/s41467-019-09851-1\n10.1002/adma.201703456\n10.1002/adfm.201803413\n10.1021/acsnano.0c00675\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.119586\n10.1002/adma.201805722\n10.1016/j.mtsust.2022.100146\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104016\n10.1016/j.mee.2019.111059\n10.1021/acsami.0c01061\n10.1021/acsaelm.2c00909\n10.1002/er.6589\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.06.034\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac54e8\n10.1109/TCSI.2016.2555249\n10.1109/TIE.2021.3139175\n10.1109/TCSII.2022.3173966"}
{"title": "Application of Piezoelectric Material and Devices in Bone Regeneration.", "abstract": "Bone injuries are common in clinical practice. Given the clear disadvantages of autologous bone grafting, more efficient and safer bone grafts need to be developed. Bone is a multidirectional and anisotropic piezoelectric material that exhibits an electrical microenvironment; therefore, electrical signals play a very important role in the process of bone repair, which can effectively promote osteoblast differentiation, migration, and bone regeneration. Piezoelectric materials can generate electricity under mechanical stress without requiring an external power supply; therefore, using it as a bone implant capable of harnessing the body's kinetic energy to generate the electrical signals needed for bone growth is very promising for bone regeneration. At the same time, devices composed of piezoelectric material using electromechanical conversion technology can effectively monitor the structural health of bone, which facilitates the adjustment of the treatment plan at any time.

{"title": "A Piezoelectrically Excited ZnO Nanowire Mass Sensor with Closed-Loop Detection at Room Temperature.", "abstract": "One-dimensional nanobeam mass sensors offer an unprecedented ability to measure tiny masses or even the mass of individual molecules or atoms, enabling many interesting applications in the fields of mass spectrometry and atomic physics. However, current nano-beam mass sensors suffer from poor real-time test performance and high environment requirements. This paper proposes a piezoelectrically excited ZnO nanowire (NW) mass sensor with closed-loop detection at room temperature to break this limitation. It is detected that the designed piezo-excited ZnO NW could operate at room temperature with a resonant frequency of 417.35 MHz, a quality factor of 3010, a mass sensitivity of -8.1 Hz/zg, and a resolution of 192 zg. The multi-field coupling dynamic model of ZnO NW mass sensor under piezoelectric excitation was established and solved. The nonlinear amplitude-frequency characteristic formula, frequency formula, modal function, sensitivity curve, and linear operating interval were obtained. The ZnO NW mass sensor was fabricated by a top-down method and its response to ethanol gas molecules was tested at room temperature. Experiments show that the sensor has high sensitivity, good closed-loop tracking performance, and high linearity, which provides great potential for the detection of biochemical reaction process of biological particles based on mechanics.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["XianfaCai", "LizhongXu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13122242\n10.1007/s00339-022-05794-5\n10.1002/mop.33355\n10.3390/s19061285\n10.1038/nnano.2008.125\n10.1038/nnano.2012.42\n10.1038/ncomms7482\n10.3390/mi11010007\n10.1021/nl801982v\n10.1021/nl802181c\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04301\n10.1021/acsnano.1c08423\n10.1038/s41598-020-60296-9\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112176\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.09.024\n10.1038/nature08967\n10.1016/j.vacuum.2019.109008\n10.1143/JJAP.45.1909\n10.1016/j.cjac.2021.12.001\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2877736\n10.1049/iet-epa.2018.5195\n10.1016/S0304-3991(00)00082-6\n10.1038/nrg3316\n10.1039/C6NR04103E\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2925597\n10.1126/science.1145002\n10.1038/nmat3537\n10.1126/sciadv.aba6012\n10.1063/1.3575560\n10.1016/j.sna.2003.09.037\n10.1021/nl303132c\n10.1088/0957-4484/19/28/285712\n10.1016/j.cnsns.2018.05.013\n10.1016/j.physe.2014.01.033\n10.1016/j.physe.2013.04.003\n10.1109/TIE.2020.3038090\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2011.10.013\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00518-5\n10.1007/s40820-021-00779-0\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107876\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105826\n10.3390/mi12111278\n10.3390/mi13060952\n10.1109/LPT.2007.912491\n10.1143/APEX.3.092101\n10.1021/nl062206p\n10.1039/C6NR00713A\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2016.05.013\n10.1103/PhysRevB.66.085416\n10.1021/acsnano.2c01673\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.087203\n10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03636.x\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000003573\n10.1016/j.microc.2021.106111\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.12.090\n10.1063/1.5125060\n10.1038/nature02905"}

{"title": "A High-Sensitivity Bowel Sound Electronic Monitor Based on Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers.", "abstract": "Bowel sounds contain some important human physiological parameters which can reflect information about intestinal function. In this work, in order to realize real-time monitoring of bowel sounds, a portable and wearable bowel sound electronic monitor based on piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) is proposed. This prototype consists of a sensing module to collect bowel sounds and a GUI (graphical user interface) based on LabVIEW to display real-time bowel sound signals. The sensing module is composed of four PMUTs connected in parallel and a signal conditioning circuit. The sensitivity, noise resolution, and non-linearity of the bowel sound monitor are measured in this work. The result indicates that the designed prototype has high sensitivity (-142.69 dB), high noise resolution (50 dB at 100 Hz), and small non-linearity. To demonstrate the characteristic of the designed electronic monitor, continuous bowel sound monitoring is performed using the electronic monitor and a stethoscope on a healthy human before and after a meal. Through comparing the experimental results and analyzing the signals in the time domain and frequency domain, this bowel sound monitor is demonstrated to record bowel sounds from the human intestine.

{"title": "Intelligent Predictive Solution Dynamics for Dahl Hysteresis Model of Piezoelectric Actuator.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuated models are promising high-performance precision positioning devices used for broad applications in the field of precision machines and nano/micro manufacturing. Piezoelectric actuators involve a nonlinear complex hysteresis that may cause degradation in performance. These hysteresis effects of piezoelectric actuators are mathematically represented as a second-order system using the Dahl hysteresis model. In this paper, artificial intelligence-based neurocomputing feedforward and backpropagation networks of the Levenberg-Marquardt method (LMM-NNs) and Bayesian Regularization method (BRM-NNs) are exploited to examine the numerical behavior of the Dahl hysteresis model representing a piezoelectric actuator, and the Adams numerical scheme is used to create datasets for various cases. The generated datasets were used as input target values to the neural network to obtain approximated solutions and optimize the values by using backpropagation neural networks of LMM-NNs and BRM-NNs. The performance analysis of LMM-NNs and BRM-NNs of the Dahl hysteresis model of the piezoelectric actuator is validated through convergence curves and accuracy measures via mean squared error and regression analysis.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["SidraNaz", "Muhammad Asif ZahoorRaja", "AmmaraMehmood", "Aneela ZameerJaafery"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13122205\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107190\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112542\n10.1049/cth2.12132\n10.1007/s11071-020-05508-7\n10.1177/0954405419889201\n10.1117/1.JATIS.6.3.039001\n10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.10.018\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128906\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112031\n10.3390/s17112577\n10.1007/s00542-020-04853-2\n10.1063/1.5093000\n10.1016/j.scs.2021.102822\n10.1109/TIE.2020.2977567\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111797\n10.3390/mi12030315\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112431\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107079\n10.3906/elk-1907-28\n10.2514/3.61511\n10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-01382-3\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037216\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03999\n10.3390/mi12010092\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106856\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab874b\n10.3390/app10207268\n10.3390/mi11010084\n10.3390/s20123342\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.106501\n10.1007/s11432-020-3157-5\n10.3390/s21010269\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2014.10.012\n10.1109/TAC.2007.892369\n10.1177/0954406220928370\n10.1016/j.camwa.2011.12.015\n10.1177/1045389X19831360\n10.1142/S0217984918501312\n10.1016/j.engappai.2019.103317\n10.1631/FITEE.1500393\n10.1016/j.amc.2020.125093\n10.1016/j.matcom.2020.10.004\n10.1007/s00521-017-2949-0\n10.1140/epjp/i2018-12013-3\n10.1007/s00521-019-04203-y\n10.1016/j.matcom.2020.01.005\n10.1007/s00521-019-04573-3\n10.1080/09540091.2014.907555\n10.1140/epjp/i2019-12530-5\n10.1016/j.neucom.2016.08.079\n10.1016/j.asoc.2015.10.015\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985763\n10.1186/s13662-017-1461-2\n10.1016/j.asoc.2017.10.049\n10.1016/j.jtice.2015.10.020\n10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.032\n10.1016/j.asoc.2016.10.009\n10.1007/s00521-017-2951-6\n10.1140/epjp/s13360-020-00417-5\n10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107835\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2021.108293\n10.1016/j.matcom.2022.01.011\n10.1016/j.jtice.2018.05.046\n10.1063/1.5011727\n10.1016/j.matcom.2016.08.002\n10.1016/j.cam.2019.112575\n10.1007/s12555-017-0482-7\n10.1016/j.molliq.2018.11.148\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105093\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.05.012\n10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2915353\n10.1007/s12555-019-0053-1\n10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2019.104431\n10.3390/math7050428\n10.1007/s12555-019-0831-9\n10.1115/1.4001712\n10.1007/s40313-019-00506-6\n10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2021.105544\n10.1016/j.surfin.2021.101321\n10.1016/j.surfin.2021.101403\n10.3390/coatings11070779\n10.1007/s13369-021-05814-1\n10.1007/s00366-021-01427-2\n10.3390/su13179537"}

{"title": "A Polymeric Piezoelectric Tactile Sensor Fabricated by 3D Printing and Laser Micromachining for Hardness Differentiation during Palpation.", "abstract": "Tactile sensors are important bionic microelectromechanical systems that are used to implement an artificial sense of touch for medical electronics. Compared with the natural sense of touch, this artificial sense of touch provides more quantitative information, augmenting the objective aspects of several medical operations, such as palpation-based diagnosis. Tactile sensors can be effectively used for hardness differentiation during the palpation process. Since palpation requires direct physical contact with patients, medical safety concerns are alleviated if the sensors used can be made disposable. In this respect, the low-cost, rapid fabrication of tactile sensors based on polymers is a possible alternative. The present work uses the 3D printing of elastic resins and the laser micromachining of piezoelectric polymeric films to make a low-cost tactile sensor for hardness differentiation through palpation. The fabricated tactile sensor has a sensitivity of 1.52 V/mm to mechanical deformation at the vertical direction, a sensitivity of 11.72 mV/HA in sensing material hardness with a pressing depth of 500 \u00b5m for palpation, and a validated capability to detect rigid objects buried in a soft tissue phantom. Its performance is comparable with existing piezoelectric tactile sensors for similar applications.

The mechanism of longitudinal-torsional conversion was analyzed to guide the design of a vibration transducer. The transducer features five spiral grooves around the front cover plate, which function under the excitation of a group of longitudinal piezoelectric ceramics. A portion of the longitudinal vibration was successfully converted into torsional vibration. The resonant frequency, longitudinal vibration displacement and torsional amplitude at the top of the disk milling cutter were 24,609 Hz, 19 \u03bcm and 9 \u03bcm, respectively. In addition, the directivity of the longitudinal-torsional transducer was theoretically analyzed.

{"title": "Modeling and Measurement of an Ultrasound Power Delivery System for Charging Implantable Devices Using an AlN-Based pMUT as Receiver.", "abstract": "Ultrasound power delivery can be considered a convenient technique for charging implantable medical devices. In this work, an intra-body system has been modeled to characterize the phenomenon of ultrasound power transmission. The proposed system comprises a Langevin transducer as transmitter and an AlN-based square piezoelectric micro-machined ultrasonic transducer as receiver. The medium layers, in which elastic waves propagate, were made by polydimethylsiloxane to mimic human tissue and stainless steel to replace the case of the implantable device.

{"title": "Tiny Piezoelectric Multi-Layered Actuators with Application in a Compact Camera Module-Design, Fabrication, Assembling and Testing Issues.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators with multi-layer structures have largely gained attention from academic and industry experts. This is due to its distinctive advantages of fast response time, huge generative force and the inherent good planar electromechanical coupling factor, as well as other mechanical qualities. Typically, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is one of the most represented piezoelectric ceramic materials that have been used for multi-layer piezoelectric actuators. Piezoelectric multi-layered actuators (PMLAs) were developed vigorously in the past decades due to the emergence of portable devices, such as smartphones with a highly compact camera module (CCM) and an image stabilizer (IS). This study reviewed the progress made in the field of PMLA applications, with a particular focus on the miniaturized dimensions and associated generated output force, speed and maximum output power requirement for various loads. Several commercial attempts, such as Helimorph, Lobster and the two-degrees-of-freedom ultrasonic motor (USM), were investigated. The proposed simple bimorph and multi-layer bimorph USMs experimentally showed thrust as high as 3.08 N and 2.57 N with good free speed and structural thicknesses of 0.7 and 0.6 mm, respectively. When compared with the other 14 reported linear USMs, they ranked as the top 1 and 2 in terms of the thrust-to-volume ratio. The proposed design shows great potential for cellphone camera module application, especially in moving sensor image stabilization.

The sorted cells can be used for downstream analysis to expand our knowledge of cell-to-cell differences. We previously demonstrated a user-friendly image-activated microfluidic cell sorting technique using an optimized and fast deep learning algorithm. Real-time isolation of cells was carried out using this technique with an inverted microscope. In this study, we devised a recently upgraded sorting system. The cell sorting techniques shown on the microscope were implemented as a real system. Several new features were added to make it easier for the users to conduct the real-time sorting of cells or particles. The newly added features are as follows: (1) a high-resolution linear piezo-stage is used to obtain in-focus images of the fast-flowing cells; (2) an LED strobe light was incorporated to minimize the motion blur of fast-flowing cells; and (3) a vertical syringe pump setup was used to prevent the cell sedimentation. The sorting performance of the upgraded system was demonstrated through the real-time sorting of fluorescent polystyrene beads. The sorter achieved a 99.4% sorting purity for 15 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm beads with an average throughput of 22.1 events per second (eps).", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["KeondoLee", "Seong-EunKim", "SeokhoNam", "JunsangDoh", "Wan KyunChung"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13122105\n10.1002/cyto.a.23764\n10.1038/s41592-020-0831-y\n10.1063/5.0051354\n10.1038/s41467-020-17285-3\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.028\n10.1039/D0LC00080A\n10.1126/science.aan0096\n10.1039/C9LC00163H\n10.1039/D0LC00679C\n10.1039/D0RA04919K\n10.1038/s41598-019-47193-6\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2020.10.006\n10.52810/TPRIS.2021.100050\n10.1038/s41467-020-14929-2\n10.1039/D0LC00747A\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/9/095024\n10.1039/C9LC00774A\n10.3390/mi11010094"}
{"title": "The Limit Tuning Effects Exerted by the Mechanically Induced Artificial Potential Barriers on the ", "abstract": "A mechanically induced artificial potential barrier (MIAPB) in piezoelectric semiconductor devices is set up under the action of a pair of tensile/compressive mechanical loadings. Three factors, namely, the barrier height, width and position, affect the nature and extent of interaction between the MIAPB and the contact barrier, and the tuning characteristics (generated under conditions of the artificial barrier) of the piezoelectric PN junctions were studied. The influence of these factors resulted in variations in the interaction intensities, superposition effects, carrier inversion degrees and carrier redistribution ranges. Subsequently, the limit tuning effects exerted by the tensile/compressive-mode MIAPB on the PN junctions were studied. The inconsistency between the left and right end of the tensile-mode MIAPB under conditions of the offset loading state proves that the maximum tuning effect is generated when both sides of the interface are symmetrically loaded. The range of carrier redistribution and the over-inversion of local carriers, affected by the width and height of MIAPB, result in a second competitive mechanism. The carrier redistribution range and the carrier inversion degree require that the compressive-mode MIAPB be sufficiently wide. The interaction intensities and the superposition effects, affected by the position and height of the MIAPB, contribute to the second competing mechanism. We logically clarify the relationship between multiple competition and find that the emergence of multiple competitive mechanisms proves the existence of the limit tuning effect of MIAPB on the ", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["YizhanYang", "JiankangChen", "YunboWang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13122103\n10.1021/nl204440g\n10.1021/nl071310j\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.03.027\n10.1038/ncomms3682\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.06.035\n10.1021/acsaelm.1c00703\n10.1016/j.apm.2022.05.004\n10.1063/1.1729015\n10.1063/1.1728525\n10.1103/PhysRevB.88.085307\n10.1088/0957-4484/25/13/135204\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104663\n10.1002/adma.201100906\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2022.115358\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104081\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2021.104153\n10.1007/s10338-020-00163-2\n10.1016/j.carbon.2022.08.077\n10.1021/acsaelm.2c00069\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104140\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.06.008\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104986\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2022.104407\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107281\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104345\n10.1063/1.5110876\n10.1007/s10483-019-2481-6\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.017\n10.1007/s10483-020-2617-9\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105581\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105421\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106741\n10.1007/s11664-020-08026-9\n10.1007/s11664-020-08634-5"}

Considering that the prototype actuator was designed just with engineering intuition and the performance optimization through experimental developments would take a vast amount of cost and time, a mathematical model was developed to investigate the actuator's critical design parameters and optimize its presently undesirable performance. Based on the lumped parameter method reported previously, and taking full account of the detailed modeling of the complex actuator housing and the actual nonlinear behaviors from the high-force contact and friction occurring at the screw-nut interface, as well as the output performance of the main drive elements including the piezoelectric stack and hollow ultrasonic motors (HUSMs), this model was built and then was experimentally verified for its accuracy and availability. Finally, nine design parameters were studied for their individual effect on the actuator's output using the proposed model.

Additionally, preparing antifouling green membranes in one step by blending the polymer with an antifouling material before inducing phase separation remains extremely challenging due to the solubility issues. Here, the green solvent triethyl phosphate (TEP) was used to solubilize both PVDF and a copolymer (synthesized from styrene monomer and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate). VIPS was then used, yielding symmetric bi-continuous microfiltration membranes. For a 2 wt% copolymer content in the casting solution, the corresponding membrane P2 showed a homogeneous and dense surface distribution of the copolymer, resulting in a high hydration capacity (>900 mg/cm3) and effective resistance to biofouling during the adsorption tests using bovine serum albumin, Escherichia coli or whole blood, with a measured fouling reduction of 80%, 89% and 90%, respectively. Cyclic filtration tests using bacteria highlighted the competitive antifouling properties of the membranes with a flux recovery ratio after two water/bacterial solution cycles higher than 70%, a reversible flux decline ratio of about 62% and an irreversible flux decline ratio of 28%.

{"title": "Enhancing the Performance of PVDF/GO Ultrafiltration Membrane via Improving the Dispersion of GO with Homogeniser.", "abstract": "In this study, PVDF/GO-h composite membranes were synthesised using a homogeniser to improve the dispersion of GO nanosheets within the composite membrane's structure, and then characterised and contrasted to PVDF/GO-s control samples, which were synthesised via traditional blending method-implementing a magnetic stirrer. By characterizing membrane via X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle (WCA) and membrane performance. SEM results showed that the number of the finger-like structure channels and pores in the sponge like structure of PVDF/GO-h composite membranes become more compared with PVDF/GO-s membranes. Water contact angle tests showed that the PVDF/GO-h composite membranes have lower contact angle than PVDF/GO-s control, which indicated the PVDF/GO-h composite membranes are more hydrophilic. Results also showed that composite membranes blended using homogeniser exhibited both improved water flux and rejection of target pollutants. In summary, it was shown that the performance of composite membranes could be improved significantly via homogenisation during synthesis, thus outlining the importance of further research into proper mixing.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-12-24", "authors": ["XinSun", "HanaShiraz", "RiccardoWong", "JingtongZhang", "JinxinLiu", "JunLu", "NaMeng"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12121268\n10.1039/c3cp50955a\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.055\n10.1039/c2ta01415g\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.07.005\n10.1016/j.arabjc.2020.04.009\n10.1016/j.enmm.2022.100696\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014\n10.1126/science.1236686\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.07.035\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2019.100833\n10.1038/nature04969\n10.1039/B917103G\n10.1126/science.1245711\n10.1126/science.1236098\n10.1021/nn304471w\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2012.05.005\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.05.015\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.11.037\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.07.042\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.11.018\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.01.050\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.02.022\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.10.070\n10.1039/C5RA06893B\n10.1016/j.seppur.2012.10.012\n10.1016/j.jece.2013.05.014\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.07.064\n10.1016/j.carbon.2006.06.004\n10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.09.017\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.04.032\n10.1016/j.jiec.2008.07.008\n10.1016/j.lwt.2008.12.016\n10.1177/0021998308096327\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.08.003\n10.1039/C5RA08643D\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.12.004\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.044\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.04.118\n10.1295/polymj.3.600\n10.1021/ma901765j\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.110732\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.07.118\n10.1016/j.jcis.2011.07.042\n10.1016/j.polymer.2010.09.067\n10.1021/jp073102l\n10.1088/2053-1591/ab5f82\n10.1002/pc.21106\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.09.030\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)00315-X\n10.1016/j.seppur.2015.02.043\n10.1002/pat.5072\n10.1016/S1383-5866(98)00050-1\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.05.003\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.05.003"}

{"title": "Effect of Temperature on Ultrasonic Nonlinear Parameters of Carbonated Concrete.", "abstract": "In order to explore the monitoring technique of concrete carbonation in various temperatures, longitudinal ultrasonic nonlinear parameters of carbonated concrete are measured by using an embedded composite piezoelectric transducer (ECPT) and a surface-mounted transducer. The effect of temperature from -20 \u2218C to 40 \u2218C with a temperature interval of 5 \u2218C and water-cement ratio on the measurements of ultrasonic parameters for carbonated concrete is investigated. The ultrasonic transmission detection method and the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique for longitudinal waves are used in the study. Results of the experiment demonstrate that ECPT is effective in the monitoring of the changes in ultrasonic parameters of carbonated concrete. At the temperature ranging from 15 \u2218C to 40 \u2218C, the increasing temperature slightly increases the relative nonlinear parameters of carbonated concrete. It decreases significantly that the relative nonlinear parameters of carbonated concrete measured at 0 \u2218C compared with that at 10 \u2218C.

In the same carbonation time, the relative nonlinear parameters also increase slightly when the temperature is at -20 \u2218C to 0 \u2218C, but it does not change too much.

In this article, FeCoSiB thin films were deposited on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) substrate by DC magnetron sputtering. The structure of PVDF-TrFE/FeCoSiB heterostructure thin films was similar to 2-2. Under a bias magnetic field of 70 Oe, the composites have a dramatically increased ME voltage coefficient as high as 111 V/cm\u22c5Oe at a frequency of about 85 kHz. The piezoelectric coefficient of PVDF-TrFE thin films is 34.87 pC/N. The surface morphology of PVDF-TrFE thin films were studied by FESEM, and the results of XRD and FTIR showed that the \u03b2-phase of PVDF-TrFE thin films was dominant.

{"title": "PDMS/PVDF Electrospinning Membranes for Water-in-Oil Emulsion Separation and UV Protection.", "abstract": "With industry development, the separation of oily wastewater is becoming more critical. Inspired by organisms such as lotus leaves, biomimetic superhydrophobic surfaces with micro-nano structures have shown great potential in this regard. In this work, PDMS/PVDF oil-water separation membranes with designed microstructures were prepared by electrospinning technology. The membrane-forming effect of electrospinning with different ratios of PDMS and PVDF was studied. The study found that membranes with high PDMS content were more likely to form microspheres, and PDMS tended to concentrate on the microspheres. The results also showed that the microspheres would bring better hydrophobicity to the membrane. When the ratio of PDMS to PVDF is 1:2, the membrane has a water contact angle of up to 150\u00b0 and an oil contact angle of 0\u00b0. At this ratio, the separation efficiency of the membrane for the water-in-oil emulsion is 98.7%, and it can still maintain more than 98% after ten separation cycles, which is a good candidate for oil-water separation. Furthermore, microspheres enable the membrane to achieve macroscopic uniformity and microscopic phase separation so that the membranes have both good elongation and fracture strength. In addition, the PDMS/PVDF membranes also exhibit excellent UV resistance, and their UV protection factor is greater than 185, making them a potential UV protective material.", "journal": "Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-12-23", "authors": ["JieLi", "YushanLi", "YiyiLu", "WentianShi", "HuafengTian"], "doi": "10.3390/biomimetics7040217\n10.1002/adma.201601812\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2019.101121\n10.1039/C7NH00185A\n10.1021/acsami.0c18794\n10.1016/j.desal.2015.05.017\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.122862\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.117116\n10.3390/pharmaceutics11010006\n10.1016/j.cherd.2018.01.045\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.117962\n10.1016/j.seppur.2021.119720\n10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.164\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117362\n10.1016/j.carbon.2020.10.060\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.08.189\n10.1007/s10570-020-03578-9\n10.3390/nano12010044\n10.1038/s41467-022-28036-x\n10.1039/tf9444000546\n10.1016/j.seppur.2016.04.016\n10.1016/j.jece.2020.103921\n10.1038/s41598-018-34440-5\n10.1021/acsmacrolett.1c00256\n10.1002/app.47123\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.06.007\n10.1039/C8TA00275D\n10.1039/C8RA03262A\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.073\n10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.040\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2020.100713\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.03.008\n10.1016/j.cap.2021.09.003\n10.1021/acsami.1c22404\n10.1002/pi.5725\n10.1016/j.cej.2015.09.063\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.10.028\n10.1021/acsnano.1c00158\n10.1007/s42114-017-0016-z\n10.1016/j.polymer.2020.123366\n10.1080/1023666X.2019.1656388\n10.1038/s41467-019-12391-3\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151128\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2019.03.042\n10.1038/s41467-020-19054-8\n10.1007/s10570-020-03369-2\n10.1016/j.molstruc.2020.128616\n10.1007/s10853-020-04929-4"}

This asymmetry remains unclear and is often attributed to extrinsic effects. We show here for the first time that such an asymmetry can be intrinsic, steaming from the superposition of asymmetries of internal FE bias and electro-piezo-strictive deformation. This hypothesis is confirmed by the observed decrease of PV asymmetry for smaller FE bias. Moreover, the both PV effect and remanent polarization are found to increase under vacuum-induced expansion and to decrease for gas-induced compression, with tens percents tunability. The change in cations positions under pressure is analysed through the first-principle density functional theory calculations.

Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and two-pore domain potassium ion (K2P) channels, are highly expressed in lung tissues, and the activity of these MSCs can be modulated by mechanical forces (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and other stimuli (e.g., LPS, hyperoxia). Dysfunction of MSCs has been found in various types of ALI/ARDS, and MSCs play a key role in regulating alveolar fluid clearance, alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier function, the inflammatory response and surfactant secretion in ALI/ARDS lungs. Targeting MSCs exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In this review, we summarize the structure and functions of several well-recognized MSCs, the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and recent advances in the pharmacological and molecular modulation of MSCs in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature, targeting MSCs might be a very promising therapeutic approach against ALI/ARDS.", "journal": "Respiratory research", "date": "2022-12-21", "authors": ["QiJia", "YiyiYang", "XiangdongChen", "ShanglongYao", "ZhiqiangHu"], "doi": "10.1186/s12931-022-02303-3\n10.1001/jama.2017.21907\n10.1164/rccm.201609-1767CI\n10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00439-6\n10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30505-1\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01722\n10.1164/rccm.202009-3536OC\n10.1152/ajplung.00315.2009\n10.1038/s41598-020-78886-y\n10.1152/ajplung.00365.2017\n10.7554/eLife.07370\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.688918\n10.7554/eLife.50597\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9892\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.006\n10.1038/ncomms15321\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00824\n10.1146/annurev-neuro-070918-050509\n10.1038/s41586-018-0522-3\n10.1073/pnas.1911243117\n10.1038/ncomms10366\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.024\n10.1073/pnas.1320768111\n10.1016/j.neuron.2019.10.017\n10.1016/j.neuron.2018.09.046\n10.1073/pnas.2023130118\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.056\n10.1016/j.devcel.2018.01.008\n10.1038/nature20793\n10.1073/pnas.1902165116\n10.1152/ajplung.00379.2016\n10.1172/jci.insight.134464\n10.1152/ajplung.00121.2017\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000001443\n10.1164/rccm.201405-0833OC\n10.1073/pnas.1306798111\n10.1152/ajplung.00078.2011\n10.1152/ajplung.00065.2014\n10.1016/j.resp.2009.11.004\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.075\n10.1038/s41586-020-2933-1\n10.7554/eLife.70988\n10.4049/jimmunol.1501688\n10.4049/jimmunol.1901033\n10.1183/13993003.01805-2016\n10.1038/s41586-019-1485-8\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e31822f09d7\n10.1152/ajplung.00263.2009\n10.1186/s12931-021-01785-x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.163\n10.1165/rcmb.2019-0024OC\n10.1016/j.ccm.2016.07.004\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000003943\n10.1096/fj.202000613RRR\n10.1186/s12931-019-1083-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0196055\n10.1007/s001340051217\n10.3390/ijms22126443\n10.1172/JCI75331\n10.1007/s00424-017-1983-1\n10.1152/ajplung.00275.2015\n10.1038/nm.4035\n10.1165/rcmb.2013-0468OC\n10.1152/ajplung.00223.2011\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.725275\n10.1074/jbc.M311783200\n10.1152/ajprenal.00200.2017\n10.1152/ajplung.00195.2019\n10.1053/j.gastro.2008.02.030\n10.1152/ajplung.00153.2006\n10.1002/emmm.200900050\n10.1096/fj.06-7694com\n10.1164/ajrccm.163.6.2004035\n10.1038/ng0396-325\n10.1152/ajplung.00373.2006\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101592\n10.1152/ajplung.00023.2013\n10.1074/jbc.M410561200\n10.1152/ajplung.00326.2002\n10.1152/ajpcell.00139.2012\n10.1152/ajplung.00260.2011\n10.1007/s00134-011-2251-z\n10.1074/jbc.M310145200\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00178\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.00842\n10.1016/j.bpj.2021.06.005\n10.1074/jbc.C400080200\n10.7554/eLife.58603\n10.1186/1465-9921-13-29\n10.4049/jimmunol.1302421\n10.3390/toxins10020079\n10.1111/aas.12034\n10.1186/1471-2253-14-42\n10.1186/s13054-017-1795-x\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1172/JCI87343\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1038/nature21407\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.725274\n10.1186/s12931-021-01844-3\n10.1182/blood.2021014614\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010919-023238\n10.1016/j.canlet.2018.07.042\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318279ba42\n10.7554/eLife.58388\n10.7554/eLife.21074\n10.1242/jcs.238360\n10.1152/ajplung.00221.2007\n10.1165/rcmb.2007-0192OC\n10.1084/jem.20111355\n10.1152/ajplung.00255.2019\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101785\n10.1152/ajplung.00113.2014\n10.1152/ajplung.00254.2014\n10.1155/2020/1936580\n10.1016/j.ceca.2020.102198\n10.1096/fj.15-275891\n10.1038/ncomms1660\n10.1038/ni.2171\n10.1113/JP279870\n10.1016/j.str.2017.03.006\n10.1111/nyas.12874\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601116\n10.1016/B978-0-12-800181-3.00005-1\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2019.183091\n10.4161/chan.5.5.16469\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089429\n10.1152/ajplung.00299.2012\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000000603\n10.1074/jbc.RA120.015059\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.033\n10.7554/eLife.53308\n10.1038/ncomms4520\n10.1038/ncomms9512"}

{"title": "Surface modification of polyether ether ketone implant with a novel nanocomposite coating containing poly (vinylidene fluoride) toward improving piezoelectric and bioactivity performance.", "abstract": "Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is an appropriate biomaterial for orthopedic implant applications due to its superior mechanical properties, chemical resistance, nontoxicity, and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility. Unfortunately, the inherent bio-inertness of PEEK restricted its application and required some modification to provide better bioactivity. Besides it, the generated electrical signals in the bone due to its piezoelectricity features have a vital role in regulating bone repair and regeneration. We aimed to modify the surface of PEEK with a dual-functionality nanocomposite that provides surface bioactivity and simulates the piezoelectricity of bone. So, we introduced a novel piezoelectric-bioactive nanocomposite of dispersed poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in a sulfonated PEEK (SPEEK) matrix containing Nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) and Carbon nanofiber (CNF) fillers for coating on PEEK substrate to improve its biological activity and simulate the electrical microenvironment for bone tissue.\u00a0Furthermore, sulfonation of the PEEK surface was conducted as an intermediate layer to prepare better adhesion between the coating nanocomposite and the PEEK sublayer. Surface and cross-section morphology, apatite formation, and cell attachment were investigated on the different treated PEEK surfaces using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Also, piezoelectric performance, electrical conductivity, contact angle, and mechanical properties were examined on the prepared samples. Moreover, cell viability and cell morphology were investigated for biological evaluation with human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. Collectively, the hydrophilicity of modified PEEK (mPEEK) coated with nanocomposite was improved due to the synergistic effects of SPEEK functional groups and nHA. Also, comprehensive investigation on the mPEEK treated with nanocomposite indicated a noticeably better bone-like apatite formation, cell proliferation, and cell attachments in the presence of nHA. The transfer of induced piezoelectric charges from dispersed PVDF in the matrix to the surface of nanocomposite containing 2\u00a0wt% of CNF increased output voltage to 1893\u00a0mV. On the other hand, the presence of CNF in nanocomposites enhanced tensile strength and Young's modulus by 92% and 117%, respectively.", "journal": "Colloids and surfaces.

Silicon, glass, epoxy with fiberglass filling (FR4), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) are considered as chip materials. The acoustophoretic chips in this study were manufactured with four different fabrication methods: plasma etching, chemical etching, micromachining and molding. A novel chip material, FR4, has been employed as a microfluidic chip material in acoustophoretic particle manipulation for the first time in literature, which combines the ease of manufacturing of polymer materials with improved acoustic performance. The acoustic particle manipulation performance is evaluated through acoustophoretic focusing experiments with 2\u03bcm and 12\u03bcm polystyrene microspheres and cultured breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). Unlike the common approach in the literature, the piezoelectric materials were actuated with partitioned cross-polarized electrodes which allowed effective actuation of different family of chip materials. Different from previous studies, this study evaluates the performance of each acoustophoretic device through the perspective of synchronization of electrical, vibrational and acoustical resonances, considers the thermal performance of the chip materials with their effects on cell viability as well as manufacturability and scalability of their fabrication methods. We believe our study is an essential work towards the commercialization of acoustophoretic devices since it brings a critical understanding of the effect of chip material on device performance as well as the cost of achieving that performance.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-12-19", "authors": ["Hande NA\u00e7\u0131kg\u00f6z", "AlaraKaraman", "M Akif\u015eahin", "\u00d6mer R\u00c7aylan", "G\u00f6knur CB\u00fcke", "EnderY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m", "\u0130rem CEro\u011flu", "A ElifErson-Bensan", "Barbaros\u00c7etin", "M B\u00fclent\u00d6zer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106911"}
{"title": "Exploring functional protein covariation across single cells using nPOP.", "abstract": "Many biological processes, such as cell division cycle and drug resistance, are reflected in protein covariation across single cells. This covariation can be quantified and interpreted by single-cell mass spectrometry with sufficiently high throughput and accuracy.\nHere, we describe nPOP, a method that enables simultaneous sample preparation of thousands of single cells, including lysing, digesting, and labeling individual cells in volumes of 8-20 nl. nPOP uses piezo acoustic dispensing to isolate individual cells in 300 pl volumes and performs all subsequent sample preparation steps in small droplets on a fluorocarbon-coated glass slide. Protein covariation analysis identifies cell cycle dynamics that are similar and dynamics that differ between cell types, even within subpopulations of melanoma cells delineated by markers for drug resistance priming. Melanoma cells expressing these markers accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, display distinct protein covariation across the cell cycle, accumulate glycogen, and have lower abundance of glycolytic enzymes. The non-primed melanoma cells exhibit gradients of protein abundance, suggesting transition states. Within this subpopulation, proteins functioning in oxidative phosphorylation covary with each other and inversely with proteins functioning in glycolysis. This protein covariation suggests divergent reliance on energy sources and its association with other biological functions.

{"title": "Innovative antibacterial electrospun nanofibers mats depending on piezoelectric generation.", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach of testing piezoelectric nanofibers as antibacterial mat. In this work, both Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and PVDF embedded with thermoplastic polyurethane nanofibers are synthesized as nanofibers mat via electrospinning technique. Then, such mat is analyzed as piezoelectric material to generate electric voltage under different mechanical excitations. Furthermore, morphological and chemical characteristics have been operated to prove the existence of beta sheets piezoelectricity of the synthesized nanofibers mats. Then, the synthesized nanofibers surfaces have been cyclically stretched and exposed to bacteria specimen. It has been noticed that the generated voltage and the corresponding localized electric field positively affect the growth of bacteria and reduces the formation of K. penomenue samples bacteria colonies. In addition, the effect of both stretching frequency and pulses numbers have been studied on the bacteria count, growth kinetics, and protein leakage. Our contribution here is to introduce an innovative way of the direct impact of the generated electric field from piezoelectric nanofibers on the reduction of bacteria growth, without depending on traditional anti-bacterial nanoparticles.

The modulator acts as a pF-scale capacitor, requires no bias voltage, and operates at CMOS voltages of down to 0.5V.

{"title": "Optical frequency combs in dispersion-controlled doubly resonant second-harmonic generation.", "abstract": "We report on the experimental realization and a systematic study of optical frequency comb generation in doubly resonant intracavity second harmonic generation (SHG). The efficiency of intracavity nonlinear processes usually benefits from the increasing number of resonating fields. Yet, achieving the simultaneous resonance of different fields may be technically complicated, all the more when a phase matching condition must be fulfilled as well. In our cavity we can separately control the resonance condition for the fundamental and its second harmonic, by simultaneously acting on an intracavity dispersive element and on a piezo-mounted cavity mirror, without affecting the quasi-phase matching condition. In addition, by finely adjusting the laser-to-cavity detuning, we are able to observe steady comb emission across the whole resonance profile, revealing the multiplicity of comb structures, and the substantial role of thermal effects on their dynamics. Lastly, we report the results of numerical simulations of comb dynamics, which include photothermal effects, finding a good agreement with the experimental observations. Our system provides a framework for exploring the richness of comb dynamics in doubly resonant SHG systems, assisting the design of chip-scale quadratic comb generators.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2022-12-17", "authors": ["IolandaRicciardi", "PasqualeMaddaloni", "PaoloDe Natale", "MiroErkintalo", "TobiasHansson", "AdyArie", "StefanWabnitz", "MaurizioDe Rosa"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.472424"}
{"title": "Texture recognition based on multi-sensory integration of proprioceptive and tactile signals.", "abstract": "The sense of touch plays a fundamental role in enabling us to interact with our surrounding environment. Indeed, the presence of tactile feedback in prostheses greatly assists amputees in doing daily tasks. In this line, the present study proposes an integration of artificial tactile and proprioception receptors for texture discrimination under varying scanning speeds. Here, we fabricated a soft biomimetic fingertip including an 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 array tactile sensor and a piezoelectric sensor to mimic Merkel, Meissner, and Pacinian mechanoreceptors in glabrous skin, respectively. A hydro-elastomer sensor was fabricated as an artificial proprioception sensor (muscle spindles) to assess the instantaneous speed of the biomimetic fingertip. In this study, we investigated the concept of the complex receptive field of RA-I and SA-I afferents for naturalistic textures. Next, to evaluate the synergy between the mechanoreceptors and muscle spindle afferents, ten naturalistic textures were manipulated by a soft biomimetic fingertip at six different speeds. The sensors' outputs were converted into neuromorphic spike trains to mimic the firing pattern of biological mechanoreceptors. These spike responses are then analyzed using machine learning classifiers and neural coding paradigms to explore the multi-sensory integration in real experiments. This synergy between muscle spindle and mechanoreceptors in the proposed neuromorphic system represents a generalized texture discrimination scheme and interestingly irrespective of the scanning speed.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-12-16", "authors": ["BehnamRostamian", "MohammadRezaKoolani", "PouyaAbdollahzade", "MiladLankarany", "EgidioFalotico", "MahmoodAmiri", "NitishV Thakor"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-24640-5"}

However, when used as linear ultrasonic motors (LUSMs), a linear guide and a preload mechanism are required, complicating the structure. In the present paper, a hollow cylindrical linear stator without an extra linear guide has been considered. The stator consists of a metal pipe and two piezoelectric (PZT) tubes installed at both ends of the metal pipe. Their connected parts are tapered for the first longitudinal axisymmetric vibration mode of the cylinder, namely L(0,1) mode excitation, and the metal pipe is subjected to radial strain. The vibration of the stator is assumed to be one-dimensional and is modeled by an electromechanical equivalent circuit. The principle that the traveling wave is formed on the metal pipe by dual-PZT-tube phase difference excitation was clarified. Finite element analysis and some measurements were conducted to confirm that the theory was consistent. The analyses and measurements were in good agreement. Therefore, the operating principle was confirmed. The results of the transport experiment showed that the average speed of the 8.5-g slider was 7.9\u00a0mm/s.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-12-14", "authors": ["KaitoMurai", "DeqingKong", "HidekiTamura", "ManabuAoyagi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106910"}

Here, we report a Cl-functionalized iontronic pressure sensitive material (CLiPS), designed via the introduction of Cl-functionalized groups into a polyurethane matrix, which realizes an ultrafast, autonomous self-healing speed (4.3\u2009\u00b5m/min), high self-healing efficiency (91% within 60\u2009min), and mechanosensitive piezo-ionic dynamics. This strategy promotes both an excellent elastic recovery (100%) and effective control of ion dynamics because the Cl groups trap the ions in the system via ion-dipole interactions, resulting in excellent pressure sensitivity (7.36\u2009kPa", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2022-12-13", "authors": ["Elvis KBoahen", "BaohaiPan", "HyukminKweon", "Joo SungKim", "HanbinChoi", "ZhengyangKong", "Dong JunKim", "JinZhu", "Wu BinYing", "Kyung JinLee", "Do HwanKim"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-022-35434-8"}

Empirically, modulation for a given ML material is achieved by application of programmed mechanical actuation with different amplitude, repetition velocity and frequency. However, to date modulation on the ML is very limited within several to a few hundred hertz low-frequency actuation range, due to the paucity of high-frequency mechanical excitation apparatus. The universality of temporal behavior and frequency response is an important aspect of ML phenomena, and serves as the impetus for much of its applications.

{"title": "Reliability analysis of smart laminated composite plates under static loads using artificial neural networks.", "abstract": "The applications of smart structures with integrated piezoelectric elements have been expanding in the last few decades due to the abilities of such structures to withstand mechanical loads and operate as sensors or actuators using their electromechanical coupling. The available manufacturing techniques can result in uncertainties in the structure's geometric parameters, which, coupled with uncertainties in material properties, can lead to unexpected failures or unreliable performance. This paper presents a reliability analysis of a smart laminated composite plate made of a graphite/epoxy cross-ply substrate with a piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite (PFRC) actuator layer under static electrical and mechanical loads. A coupled finite element (FE) model was developed in COMSOL Multiphysics, from which nondimensional stresses and displacements were calculated. To investigate the effects of randomness in the material and geometric properties, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed and trained using generated FE data. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and First- and Second-Order Reliability Methods (FORM/SORM) were then used to shed light on the significance of considering randomness in the various material and geometric parameters and the effect of such uncertainty on the resulting nondimensional stresses and displacements. A coefficient of variation (CV) study identified the piezoelectric stress coefficient as the most significant contributing factor to the variation of all nondimensional parameters. Variation in the nondimensional parameters also increases under the application of an electric load. ANN-based FORM, SORM, and MCS all indicate a pattern of low probability of failure until a threshold value of about 3% of input parameter variation is reached, beyond which there is a rapid nonlinear increase in failure probability with increasing input parameter variation.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2022-12-13", "authors": ["James RMartinez", "Peter LBishay", "Mena ETawfik", "Edward ASadek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11889"}

Even though conventional batteries are widely used to operate IoT devices as a power source, these batteries have a drawback of limited capacity, which impedes broad commercialization of the IoT. In this regard, piezoelectric energy harvesting technology has attracted a great deal of attention because piezoelectric materials can convert electricity from mechanical and vibrational movements in the ambient environment. In particular, piezoelectric-based flexible energy harvesters can precisely harvest tiny mechanical movements of muscles and internal organs from the human body to produce electricity. These inherent properties of flexible piezoelectric harvesters make it possible to eliminate conventional batteries for lifetime extension of implantable and wearable IoTs.

Detailed procedures of simulating grooves and then processing the data were described and the calibration curve was obtained using regression analysis.

{"title": "Multiple Damage Detection in PZT Sensor Using Dual Point Contact Method.", "abstract": "Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) is used to make ultrasound transducers, sensors, and actuators due to its large piezoelectric coefficient. Several micro-defects develop in the PZT sensor due to delamination, corrosion, huge temperature fluctuation, etc., causing a decline in its performance. It is thus necessary to identify, locate, and quantify the defects. Non-Destructive Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is the most optimal and economical evaluation method. Traditional ultrasound SHM techniques have a huge impedance mismatch between air and solid material, and most of the popular signal processing methods define time series signals in only one domain, which provides sub-optimal results for non-stationary signals. Thus, to improve the accuracy of detection, the point contact excitation and detection method is implemented to determine the interaction of ultrasonic waves with micro-scale defects in the PZT. The signal generated from this method being non-stationary in nature, it requires signal processing with changeable resolutions at different times and frequencies. The Haar Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) is applied to the time series data obtained from the coulomb coupling setup. Using the above process, defects up to 100 \u03bcm in diameter could be successfully distinguished.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-12-12", "authors": ["SayantaniBhattacharya", "NitinYadav", "AzeemAhmad", "FrankMelands\u00f8", "AnowarulHabib"], "doi": "10.3390/s22239161\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2011.07.002\n10.1177/1475921718765955\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.01.074\n10.1177/1045389X06071435\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1928\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/5/316\n10.1177/1475921707081979\n10.3390/s17010095\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.04.008\n10.1364/OL.22.000061\n10.1016/j.ultras.2010.11.011\n10.1177/1045389X14521875\n10.1098/rspa.1998.0193\n10.1098/rspa.2003.1123\n10.1016/0045-7949(94)90357-3\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/304\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/309\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2000)126:11(1356)\n10.1115/1.1410933\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.02.014\n10.1002/stc.215\n10.7567/JJAP.51.07GB05\n10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106834\n10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3108440\n10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106113"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (PMUTs): Performance Metrics, Advancements, and Applications.", "abstract": "With the development of technology, systems gravitate towards increasing in their complexity, miniaturization, and level of automation. Amongst these systems, ultrasonic devices have adhered to this trend of advancement. Ultrasonic systems require transducers to generate and sense ultrasonic signals. These transducers heavily impact the system's performance. Advancements in microelectromechanical systems have led to the development of micromachined ultrasonic transducers (MUTs), which are utilized in miniaturized ultrasound systems. Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) exhibit higher capacitance and lower electrical impedance, which enhances the transducer's sensitivity by minimizing the effect of parasitic capacitance and facilitating their integration with low-voltage electronics. PMUTs utilize high-yield batch microfabrication with the use of thin piezoelectric films. The deposition of thin piezoelectric material compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) has opened novel avenues for the development of miniaturized compact systems with the same substrate for application and control electronics. PMUTs offer a wide variety of applications, including medical imaging, fingerprint sensing, range-finding, energy harvesting, and intrabody and underwater communication links. This paper reviews the current research and recent advancements on PMUTs and their applications. This paper investigates in detail the important transduction metrics and critical design parameters for high-performance PMUTs.

In the proposed electrode system, the discharge process was accompanied by the generation of acoustic waves on the emitter surface and, consequently, in the ambient air. The gas discharge emitter vibrations were analyzed by applying the technique of Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry (SLDV). It was shown that the magnitude of displacements matched the corresponding characteristics of classical piezoelectric and magnetostrictive transducers. The use of the Fast Fourier transform procedure supplied amplitude-frequency spectra of vibrations generated by the gas discharge emitter. The amplitude-frequency spectrum analysis showed that the proposed emitter was able to generate acoustic waves in the air with frequencies from 50 Hz to 100 kHz, and such a device can be used for the nondestructive testing (NDT) of materials. The results of the statistical analysis of vibration displacements in the repetitive pulsed mode were discussed. A non-stable characteristic of the vibration displacement of the emitter membrane was demonstrated. The parameters of such instability were associated with the features of gas discharge processes.

The second step was to optimize the time required for the production of the membranes. In the third step, it was shown that the freezing temperature had a remarkable effect on the morphology of the membranes: as the temperature decreases, there is a transition from spherulite structures to interconnected pores. It was shown that the diversity in the pore pattern for PVDF affects remarkably the water permeability through the polymer membrane. During the monitoring of the spread of crystallized areas during the formation of the membrane, it was found that the crystallization of the solvent begins at localized points of the microscale, further crystallized areas spread radially or unevenly along the surface of the solution, forming contact borders, which can lead to changes in the properties of the membrane in its area.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-12-12", "authors": ["SergeyFomin", "EvgeniaShirokova", "IrenKraeva", "IvanTolstobrov", "AndreyBushuev", "KirillYuzhanin", "BorisAnanchenko", "Alexandre AVetcher", "AlexeyIordanskii"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14235283\n10.1016/J.JWPE.2020.101241\n10.1016/J.PSEP.2022.03.075\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2014.03.055\n10.1016/J.JWPE.2016.10.011\n10.1039/9781782629368-00127\n10.1021/cr800187m\n10.1016/J.PROGPOLYMSCI.2013.07.006\n10.1038/nmat3577\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2022.101591\n10.3390/polym13091354\n10.1016/J.DESAL.2012.10.005\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2011.03.014\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2007.01.008\n10.1002/app.27432\n10.1016/0376-7388(96)00037-3\n10.1016/J.EURPOLYMJ.2018.12.009\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2015.01.021\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2014.08.028\n10.1016/J.COCHE.2013.04.003\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2008.04.033\n10.1016/J.PROGPOLYMSCI.2020.101289\n10.1126/science.1120937\n10.1016/J.PMATSCI.2018.01.001\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2010.06.021\n10.1038/ncomms12804\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2021.119857\n10.1007/s11356-018-3575-9\n10.1016/J.SEPPUR.2022.121691\n10.1016/J.MEMSCI.2019.02.005\n10.1016/J.JWPE.2021.102504\n10.1016/J.COLSURFA.2021.128012\n10.1016/J.JIEC.2021.12.016\n10.25750/1995-4301-2021-4-064-070\n10.1016/J.POLYMERTESTING.2021.107308\n10.1007/s10853-013-7813-8"}

{"title": "A New Look at the Structure and Thermal Behavior of Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Camphor Mixtures.", "abstract": "An experimental quasi-equilibrium phase diagram of the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-camphor mixture is constructed using an original optical method. For the first time, it contains a boundary curve that describes the dependence of camphor solubility in the amorphous regions of PVDF on temperature. It is argued that this diagram cannot be considered a full analogue of the eutectic phase diagrams of two low-molar-mass crystalline substances. The phase diagram is used to interpret the polarized light hot-stage microscopy data on cooling the above mixtures from a homogeneous state to room temperature and scanning electron microscopy data on the morphology of capillary-porous bodies formed upon camphor removal. Based on our calorimetry and X-ray studies, we put in doubt the possibility of incongruent crystalline complex formation between PVDF and camphor previously suggested by Dasgupta et al.

{"title": "Ion-Conducting Robust Cross-Linked Organic/Inorganic Polymer Composite as Effective Binder for Electrode of Electrochemical Capacitor.", "abstract": "Poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) are used in many electrochemical energy storage/conversion devices owing to their favorable physical properties. Therefore, PIL binders have been examined as polymeric binders for electrodes in energy storage systems (ESSs) and have shown superior performance. Several innovative technologies have been developed to improve the properties of polymers, with cross-linking being the most effective and easy strategy to achieve this. In this study, we designed a breakthrough complex cross-linking and composite technique that could successfully develop the physical properties of a polymer in a simple one-step process. Additionally, the technique could improve the thermal stability and mechanical properties of the polymer. The proposed polymeric binder showed better adhesion, higher capacitance, and good energy density with improved cyclic stability compared to that shown by conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).

{"title": "Electrosprayed CNTs on Electrospun PVDF-Co-HFP Membrane for Robust Membrane Distillation.", "abstract": "In this investigation, the electrospraying of CNTs on an electrospun PVDF-Co-HFP membrane was carried out to fabricate robust membranes for the membrane distillation (MD) process. A CNT-modified PVDF-Co-HFP membrane was heat pressed and characterized for water contact angle, liquid entry pressure (LEP), pore size distribution, tensile strength, and surface morphology. A higher water contact angle, higher liquid entry pressure (LEP), and higher tensile strength were observed in the electrosprayed CNT-coated PVDF-Co-HFP membrane than in the pristine membrane. The MD process test was conducted at varying feed temperatures using a 3.5 wt. % simulated seawater feed solution. The CNT-modified membrane showed an enhancement in the temperature polarization coefficient (TPC) and water permeation flux up to 16% and 24.6%, respectively. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the PVDF-Co-HFP and CNT-modified membranes were observed before and after the MD process. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the presence of inorganic salt ions deposited on the membrane surface after the DCMD process. Permeate water quality and rejection of inorganic salt ions were quantitatively analyzed using ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

The obtained ZnO@PVDF composite membranes is superior to the pure PVDF membrane in decomposing methyl orange (MO) under ultrasonication at room temperature, which is mainly attributed to the synergy effect of the contact-electro-catalysis of dielectric PVDF, as well as the piezoelectric catalysis of tetrapodal ZnO and the \u03b2-phase of PVDF. The heterostructure of the piezoelectric-ZnO@dielectric-PVDF composite is beneficial in reducing the electron/hole pair recombination. As compared to the pure PVDF membrane, the catalytic degradation efficiency of the ZnO@PVDF composite membrane was improved by 444.23% under ultrasonication.

{"title": "All-Polymer Piezo-Composites for Scalable Energy Harvesting and Sensing Devices.", "abstract": "Silicone elastomer composites with piezoelectric properties, conferred by incorporated polyimide copolymers, with pressure sensors similar to human skin and kinetic energy harvester capabilities, were developed as thin film (<100 micron thick) layered architecture. They are based on polymer materials which can be produced in industrial amounts and are scalable for large areas (m2). The piezoelectric properties of the tested materials were determined using a dynamic mode of piezoelectric force microscopy. These composite materials bring together polydimethylsiloxane polymers with customized poly(siloxane-imide) copolymers (2\u221220 wt% relative to siloxanes), with siloxane segments inserted into the structure to ensure the compatibility of the components. The morphology of the materials as free-standing films was studied by SEM and AFM, revealing separated phases for higher polyimide concentration (10, 20 wt%). The composites show dielectric behavior with a low loss (<10\u22121) and a relative permittivity superior (3\u22124) to pure siloxane within a 0.1\u2212106 Hz range. The composite in the form of a thin film can generate up to 750 mV under contact with a 30 g steel ball dropped from 10 cm high. This capability to convert a pressure signal into a direct current for the tested device has potential for applications in self-powered sensors and kinetic energy-harvesting applications.

In this work, we prepared fluoroalkyl-silanized silica nanoparticles (F-SiNPs, ca. 200 nm) that were solvent-blended with polyvinylenedifluoride (PVDF) in order to prepare composites with varying weight fractions. We demonstrated that the ability to functionalize SiNPs with long fluoroalkylchains that induced co-crystallization with the PVDF matrix, resulting in uniform particle dispersion and improved interlaminate adhesion. This was quantitatively investigated using calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, which showed a decrease in the bulk crystallinity of the virgin PVDF from 37% to 10% with minimal 10 wt % F-SiNP loading, rendering a nearly amorphous PVDF.

{"title": "Osseointegration Properties of Titanium Implants Treated by Nonthermal Atmospheric-Pressure Nitrogen Plasma.", "abstract": "Pure titanium is used in dental implants owing to its excellent biocompatibility and physical properties. However, the aging of the material during storage is detrimental to the long-term stability of the implant after implantation. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to improve the surface properties and circumvent the negative effects of material aging on titanium implants by using a portable handheld nonthermal plasma device capable of piezoelectric direct discharge to treat pure titanium discs with nitrogen gas. We evaluated the osteogenic properties of the treated samples by surface morphology and elemental analyses, as well as in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results showed that nonthermal atmospheric-pressure nitrogen plasma can improve the hydrophilicity of pure titanium without damaging its surface morphology while introducing nitrogen-containing functional groups, thereby promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and osseointegration to some extent. Therefore, nitrogen plasma treatment may be a promising method for the rapid surface treatment of titanium implants.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-12-12", "authors": ["SifanYan", "SatoshiKomasa", "AkinoriAgariguchi", "GiuseppePezzotti", "JojiOkazaki", "KenjiMaekawa"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms232315420\n10.1034/j.1600-0501.2003.00972.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2010.01912.x\n10.1111/jre.12469\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.11.055\n10.5051/jpis.2011.41.6.263\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2008.06.004\n10.1126/science.1067404\n10.5772/16475\n10.1016/j.mser.2004.11.001\n10.1002/jbm.1220\n10.1016/j.jpor.2011.12.002\n10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00254-X\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00202-3\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.01.071\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199805)40:2<324::AID-JBM18>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.4012/dmj.2014-125\n10.1016/j.dental.2006.06.025\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.05.045\n10.1016/S0927-796X(02)00004-9\n10.1063/1.1340029\n10.1039/C6RA08922D\n10.1155/2015/761718\n10.4012/dmj.2017-030\n10.1038/s41598-017-05626-0\n10.1002/ppap.202000053\n10.3390/app9112257\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.08.028\n10.1002/jbm.a.30462\n10.1002/ppap.200731008\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.01.034\n10.1023/A:1023942211714\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab1a02\n10.1016/j.actbio.2007.12.002\n10.1016/0169-4332(90)90100-E\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.126934\n10.3390/nano10061225\n10.1021/jz302119g\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.06.033\n10.1016/s0269-7491(02)00107-0\n10.1016/j.scr.2013.12.001\n10.3390/ijms19061674\n10.1210/en.2004-1343\n10.1002/jrs.4438\n10.1016/j.apmt.2017.05.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.061\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.040\n10.1016/S0378-5173(01)00752-9\n10.1039/b504752h\n10.1111/j.1600-051X.2012.01853.x\n10.1089/107632700300003297\n10.1155/2013/354125\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.11.004\n10.1007/s10856-013-5020-4\n10.1038/srep33421\n10.1016/j.cap.2012.12.023\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00366-1\n10.1177/00220345010800061201\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)81388-1\n10.3390/ma11030391\n10.1016/j.acthis.2008.02.005\n10.1016/j.cotox.2018.01.002\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.12.035\n10.1038/cddis.2013.50\n10.1007/s10439-009-9868-x\n10.1074/jbc.M108653200\n10.1359/jbmr.2001.16.11.2074\n10.1529/biophysj.106.087098\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.027\n10.1186/s12866-014-0234-2\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.05.012\n10.1080/0021846708544582\n10.2147/IJN.S126248"}

By adjusting a controllable tuning voltage, the nonlinearity of microdevices, especially on microactuators, can be precisely manipulated. To trap and separate small particles, generating a large and stable rotation force is critical in micromanipulations. Here, we report a simple and potential angular momentum cell comprising a piezoelectric MEMS-based nonlinear multi-mode resonator with integrated electrodes. A nonlinear rotating nodal line has been observed in specific frequency bands by applying a controllable low voltage of sub 5\u00a0V on a 4-port resonator made of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. The magnitude of the actuated voltage is Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible and easy to integrate with the circuit. Furthermore, the real-time rotation motion of the MEMS-based nonlinear multi-mode resonator is also verified by a laser doppler vibrometer (LDV) at both chirp and single input frequencies, respectively.

It is assumed that the coefficient of heat conduction is temperature-dependent, a fact that plays an important role in the coupling behaviour analysis of thermoelastic and piezo-thermoelastic solids. Taking such a dependence into account becomes a necessity at higher temperatures and in nano-structures, when the material properties can no longer be considered as constants. Normal mode analysis is applied to find a particular solution to the problem under consideration. A concrete case is solved under prescribed boundary conditions and tentative values of the different material coefficients. The results are discussed to reveal the effect of temperature dependence of the heat conduction coefficient, as well as the thermal relaxation times, on nonlinear Rayleigh wave propagation.

{"title": "Monitoring of thermal stress in metal plates by using bonded shear horizontal wave piezoelectric transducers.", "abstract": "Thermal stress is one of the major causes of failure of engineering structures and its measurement has attracted more attention in recent years. The ultrasonic wave method is very promising in stress measurement due to its non-destructive nature and easy manipulation. The traditional ultrasonic wave transducers require a coupling medium which would introduce large repeatability errors in travel time measurement and thus in the measured stress. In this work, a methodology based on bonded shear horizontal (SH) guided wave piezoelectric transducers was developed to monitor thermal stress in metal plates. The adhesive bonding between the transducer and the specimen ensures the repeatability in travel time measurements, and the strain gauges are also employed to monitor the wave path length. The dispersive equation of acoustoelastic SH wave propagating in an isotropic medium under the uniaxial stress is derived. Both the uniaxial tension test and thermal modulation test have been performed in aluminum and steel plates.

Real-time detection of ongoing exposure with potentially unknown time and frequency domain characteristics is a critical first step in preventing acute health effects by alerting and then enabling the timely use of electromagnetic frequency energy shielding, such as structures and vehicles. Leveraging the TA effect as a field interaction mechanism, a lossy dielectric polymer subjected to pulsed HPM was tested using a planar sample geometry with thin film piezoelectric sensors used to capture the resulting TA output. The piezoelectric signal was analyzed in both the time and frequency domain to determine empirical relationships between incident microwave beam properties and signal components. This analysis was coupled with an empirically-based single term Cole-Cole model approximation fit for the complex permittivity.

{"title": "Compressed composite carbon felt as a negative electrode for a zinc-iron flow battery.", "abstract": "Flow batteries possess several attractive features including long cycle life, flexible design, ease of scaling up, and high safety. They are considered an excellent choice for large-scale energy storage. Carbon felt (CF) electrodes are commonly used as porous electrodes in flow batteries. In vanadium flow batteries, both active materials and discharge products are in a liquid phase, thus leaving no trace on the electrode surface. However, zinc-based flow batteries involve zinc deposition/dissolution, structure and configuration of the electrode significantly determine stability and performance of the battery. Herein, fabrication of a compressed composite using CF with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is investigated in a Zn-Fe flow battery (ZFB). Graphene (G) is successfully introduced in order to improve its electrochemical activity towards zinc reactions on the negative side of the ZFB. A compressed composite CF electrode offers more uniform electric field and lower nucleation overpotential (NOP) of zinc than a pristine CF, resulting in higher zinc plating/stripping efficiency. Batteries with modified electrodes are seen to provide lower overpotential.

{"title": "Enhanced removal of trace pesticides and alleviation of membrane fouling using hydrophobic-modified inorganic-organic hybrid flocculants in the flocculation-sedimentation-ultrafiltration process for surface water treatment.", "abstract": "Pesticide concentrations in surface water occasionally exceed regulated values due to seasonal events (rainy season in high intensity agricultural areas) or intermittent discharges (leakage, spillage, or other emergency events). The need to remove pesticide compounds in these situations poses a challenge for drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). In this work, the performance of dosing hydrophobic-modified inorganic-organic hybrid flocculants (HOC-M; lower acute toxicity than corresponding metal salt coagulants; acceptable economic costs when M=Al or Fe; prepared in large-scale quantities), for the removal of four different pesticides (each initial concentration: 0.25 \u03bcg/L) from Yangtze River water, and in mitigating membrane fouling, by an integrated flocculation-sedimentation-ultrafiltration (FSUF) process, was evaluated over a period of 40 days; the FSUF is well-established in many DWTPs. The mechanisms underlying the treatment were unveiled by employing a combination of instrumental characterizations, chemical computations, material flow analyses, and statistical analyses. Efficient pesticide removal (80.3%\u223c94.3%) and membrane fouling reduction (26.6%\u223c37.3% and 28.3%\u223c57.6% for reversible and irreversible membrane resistance, respectively) in the FSUF process were achieved by dosing HOC-M, whereas conventional inorganic coagulants were substantially inferior for pesticide removal (< 50%) and displayed more severe fouling development. Hydrophobic association between the pesticides and the hydrophobic organic chain of HOC-M played a predominant role in the improvement in pesticide removal; coexisting particulate/colloid inorganic minerals and natural organic matter with HOC-M adsorbed on the surface, acting as floc building materials, provided sites for the indirect combination of pesticides into flocs. The observed fouling alleviation from dosing HOC-M was ascribed to both the pre-removal of fouling-causing materials in the flocculation-sedimentation prior to UF, and a stable hydrophilization modification effect of residual HOC-M in the UF unit. The latter effect resulted from a hydrophobic association between the PVDF substrate of the membranes and the hydrophobic organic chains of the HOC-M, causing the hydrophilic ends of the HOC-M to be exposed away from the membrane surface, thereby inhibiting foulant accumulation. This work has not only demonstrated the superior performance of dosing HOC-M in the FSUF process for trace pesticide removal in DWTPs, but also clarified the underlying mechanisms.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2022-12-09", "authors": ["YunyunLi", "YadongWang", "JinJin", "ZiqiTian", "WeibenYang", "Nigel J DGraham", "ZhenYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2022.119447"}

In this Perspective, we aim to expose some of the physicochemical phenomena associated with the hydration of collagen and to examine the role collagen's hydration water plays in determining its biological function as well as applications ranging from radiology to bioengineering. The main focus is on the Magic-Angle Effect, a phenomenon observed in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of anisotropic collagenous tissues such as articular cartilage and tendon. While the effect has been known in NMR and MRI for decades, its exact molecular mechanism remains a topic of debate and continuing research in scientific literature. We survey some of the latest research aiming to develop a comprehensive molecular-level model of the Magic-Angle Effect.

{"title": "Correlating the Interfacial Polar-Phase Structure to the Local Chemistry in Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites by Combined Scanning Probe Microscopy.", "abstract": "Ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites possess exceptional electric properties with respect to the two otherwise uniform phases, which is commonly attributed to the critical role of the matrix-particle interfacial region. However, the structure-property correlation of the interface remains unestablished, and thus, the design of ferroelectric polymer nanocomposite has largely relied on the trial-and-error method. Here, a strategy that combines multi-mode scanning probe microscopy-based electrical characterization and nano-infrared spectroscopy is developed to unveil the local structure-property correlation of the interface in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites. The results show that the type of surface modifiers decorated on the nanoparticles can significantly influence the local polar-phase content and the piezoelectric effect of the polymer matrix surrounding the nanoparticles. The strongly coupled polar-phase content and piezoelectric effect measured directly in the interfacial region as well as the computed bonding energy suggest that the property enhancement originates from the formation of hydrogen bond between the surface modifiers and the ferroelectric polymer. It is also directly detected that the local domain size of the ferroelectric polymer can impact the energy level and distribution of charge traps in the interfacial region and eventually influence the local dielectric strength.", "journal": "Nano-micro letters", "date": "2022-12-07", "authors": ["JiajieLiang", "ShaojieWang", "ZhenLuo", "JingFu", "JunHu", "JinliangHe", "QiLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s40820-022-00978-3\n10.1038/358136a0\n10.1126/science.220.4602.1115\n10.1021/ma2024057\n10.1126/science.1127798\n10.1002/adma.201705662\n10.1002/adma.201601727\n10.1002/adma.201301752\n10.1039/C8TA07364C\n10.1021/acsami.7b16973\n10.1002/smll.201704022\n10.1002/adma.201405495\n10.1002/adma.201404591\n10.1002/adma.201801949\n10.1007/s10853-011-5916-7\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.217601\n10.1002/adma.200801758\n10.1039/C6RA01869F\n10.1021/am200492q\n10.1063/1.3257371\n10.1088/0957-4484/27/21/215401\n10.1063/1.3673555\n10.1063/1.4792513\n10.1002/adfm.201201824\n10.1039/C2JM32579A\n10.1021/am201650g\n10.1039/C3NR00625E\n10.1002/admi.201800096\n10.1002/admi.201500098\n10.1002/adv.21956\n10.1002/app.46352\n10.1021/acsmacrolett.6b00915\n10.1088/0256-307X/34/4/048201\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2015.11.010\n10.1021/acs.macromol.5b00962\n10.1109/TDEI.2009.4815188\n10.1002/pssa.202000695\n10.1002/mame.202200235\n10.1049/iet-nde.2018.0029\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.930\n10.1038/srep38978\n10.1021/acsnano.5b06893\n10.1038/s41563-018-0034-4\n10.1002/adma.201807722\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b01216\n10.1038/s41467-020-17760-x\n10.1016/j.ensm.2020.03.017\n10.1016/j.surfrep.2010.10.001\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00448\n10.1038/s41563-020-0724-6\n10.1016/j.polymer.2009.03.003\n10.1002/app.38949\n10.1039/C5RA11753D\n10.1039/C8TA01294F\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.04.070\n10.1021/jp409474k\n10.1016/j.ensm.2022.04.028\n10.1007/s00396-012-2815-7\n10.1039/C6RA22939E\n10.1002/app.41577\n10.1103/PhysRevB.7.3706"}

A key factor in their performance as photon emitters is their dynamic frequency tunability, which can be used to render the emission from multiple molecules indistinguishable. In this work we demonstrate dynamic tuning of dibenzoterrylene molecules embedded in anthracene crystals through the application of uniaxial strain fields. By bending a piezoelectric strip in two opposite directions in linear steps, we impose an escalating compressive or tensile strain on the molecular crystals, resulting in two opposite dynamic detunings of the dopant dibenzoterrylene emission wavelength. To validate that the tuning mechanism is strain, we performed a similar measurement using an identical strip that was depolarised by annealing in which the tuning was absent. Finally, we simulated the effect of strain on the dopant dibenzoterrylene emission wavelength by combining molecular dynamics and density functional theory techniques to determine the strain tuning rate which matched well with that found experimentally.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2022-12-07", "authors": ["AnastasiosFasoulakis", "Kyle DMajor", "Rowan AHoggarth", "PaulBurdekin", "Dominika PBogusz", "Ross CSchofield", "Alex SClark"], "doi": "10.1039/d2nr02439j"}

{"title": "Tuning the Ferroelectric Phase Transition of P(VDF-TrFE) through a Simple Approach of Modification by Introducing Double Bonds.", "abstract": "Electroactive polymer (EAP) is a kind of intelligent material that, driven by external electric field, could produce changes in shape or volume. As an important class of EAP materials, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) based relaxor ferroelectric polymers show remarkable potential for applications in sensors, actuator, and artificial muscles because of their excellent electrostrictive properties. However, the strain of PVDF-based relaxor ferroelectrics relies strongly on a high electric field, which seriously damages their reliability and limits their practical applications as wearable devices. To explore more suitable materials for actuator applications, in this present work, we report the influences of a double bond (DB) on the electroactive properties of P(VDF-TrFE) (TrFE: trifluoroethylene). The crystalline phase of P(VDF-TrFE) is partially destroyed after the DB is introduced, and the molecular chain flexibility of the product P(VDF-TrFE-DB) can be greatly improved. Therefore, P(VDF-TrFE-DB) has a larger electric displacement while having a lower dipole orientation electric field compared with that of P(VDF-TrFE). The result confirms that the DB could tune the ferroelectric properties and effectively reduce the driving electric field of the PVDF-based relaxor ferroelectric polymers.

Piezoelectric devices and special implant drilling inserts are now emerging to replace conventional drills showing improved bone response and healing around implants.

Each patient received two implants; one installed after piezosurgery assisted osteotomy, while the contralateral side received the implant with the original drilling protocol. The timing of surgery, implant stability, and bone density around the installed dental implants have been evaluated during a follow-up period extended to 4 months.\na significant difference in terms of time of surgery (p\u2009<\u20090.005) and in implant stability at 4 months (p\u2009=\u20090.024) on the study side, while a non-statistical significance in terms of bone density was detected (p\u2009=\u20090.468).\nThe piezoelectric implant site drilling protocol seemed to be a reliable and repeatable technique.

{"title": "Three-dimensional scaled boundary finite element method to simulate Lamb wave health monitoring of homogeneous structures: Experiment and modelling.", "abstract": "Exploiting scattering and reflection related data of ultrasonic Lamb wave interactions with damage is a common approach to health monitoring of thin-walled structures. Using thin PZT sensors, the method can be implemented in real-time. Simulation of Lamb wave propagation and its interaction with damage plays an important role in damage diagnosis and prognosis. It is, however, a time-consuming task due to the high-frequency waves that are commonly used to detect tiny damage. The current study employs the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM) for effective modeling of Lamb wave health monitoring of homogenous thin plates. The electromechanical effects of piezoelectric sensors are included in the model to improve accuracy and make the results comparable to those of laboratory experiments. Simple meshing of complex topologies is possible by converting standard finite elements to scaled boundary elements. The 3D SBFEM wave motion equations are solved in the time domain to capture the sensor's PZT response to a high-frequency tone-burst actuation. The results are validated by pitch-catch and pulse-echo laboratory tests carried out on thin plates. SBFEM is used to study wave propagation in complex configurations, such as a stiffened plate, and the results are compared to their FEM counterparts. According to the findings, SBFEM significantly reduces the computational costs associated with simulation of Lamb wave health monitoring while also providing significant accuracy in comparison to the experimental results.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-12-04", "authors": ["MohammadEhsani", "MahnazShamshirsaz", "MojtabaSadighi", "NaserodinSepehry", "RichardLoendersloot"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106892"}

We demonstrate an unprecedented range of tunability of the mirror position in the cryogenic regime (over 22 \u03bcm at 10\u00a0K). The capability of controlling the mirror position in the range from few to few tens of microns is crucial for cavity-enhanced molecular spectroscopy techniques, especially in the important mid-infrared spectral regime where the length of an optical cavity has to be tunable in a range larger than the laser wavelength. The piezoelectric actuator offering this range of tunability in the cryogenic conditions, on the one hand, will enable development of optical cavities operating at low temperatures that are crucial for spectroscopy of large molecules whose dense spectra are difficult to resolve at room temperature.

This has led to theoretical and practical research on the development of robotic caudal fin thrusters that offer similar properties and performance. However, the current caudal fin thrusters are driven by electromagnetic motors, which require a transmission system that makes them difficult to miniaturize, and need protection against water intrusion. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel piezoelectric caudal fin thruster with a fully open structure that has no chambers in any of its parts. The converse, piezoelectric effect and direct friction drive principle are used to make a rotation unit for the piezoelectric actuator drive and achieve a reciprocating motion that makes the caudal fin flap. The proposed piezoelectric caudal fin thruster has an open and simple structure. It has a weight of 30\u00a0g, a length of 89\u00a0mm, and a thrust of 0.07 N. It is easy to miniaturize and is lighter, smaller, and more efficient than previously reported caudal fin thrusters that were based on ionic polymer-metal composites and shape memory alloys.

Among the loudspeakers investigated, the all-fabric loudspeakers with ePTFE ferroelectret and PEDOT:PSS-coated spandex electrodes have a higher frequency dependency. Loudspeakers equipped with PEDOT:PSS-coated spandex electrodes are less angle dependent compared to other loudspeakers evaluated. Moreover, the soft loudspeaker constituted of an all-organic FEP(fluorinated-ethylene-propylene)-ePTFE-based ferroelectret and PEDOT:PSS-coated fabrics presented in this paper is easy to integrate with clothes and has a higher thermal stability.

The probes-labeled microparticle array offers a platform for full molecular contact under dynamic ultrasonic streaming, and the array supplies a multipoint data correction to reduce the false positive of the detection results for more precisely visible fluorescence multiple target miRNAs sensing.

The method was standardized with strains of Escherichia coli TS7, Staphylococcus arlettae HWI8, Enterococcus faecalis HWI19, and Aerococcus viridans HWII16 with known antibiogram using six clinically important antibiotics. The method was verified with different water sources having different physicochemical parameters successfully. Only 1\u00a0ml of sample water is required to be mixed with an optimized concentration of the antibiotic solution and incubated for 6h; subsequently, a color change to pink may be observed within a specified amount of time upon the addition of the bacterial detection PVDF membrane to monitor the presence of resistant bacteria. There is no color change in the case of antibiotic-susceptible bacterial communities or the absence of a resistant community. Moreover, the time taken for color change is inversely related to the magnitude of the antibiotic-resistant communities in terms of enumeration.

{"title": "A minimal-complexity light-sheet microscope maps network activity in 3D neuronal systems.", "abstract": "In vitro systems mimicking brain regions, brain organoids, are revolutionizing the neuroscience field. However, characterization of their electrical activity has remained a challenge as it requires readout at millisecond timescale in 3D at single-neuron resolution. While custom-built microscopes used with genetically encoded sensors are now opening this door, a full 3D characterization of organoid neural activity has not been performed yet, limited by the combined complexity of the optical and the biological system. Here, we introduce an accessible minimalistic light-sheet microscope to the neuroscience community. Designed as an add-on to a standard inverted microscope it can be assembled within one day. In contrast to existing simplistic setups, our platform is suited to record volumetric calcium traces.

{"title": "Autonomous Resonance-Tuning Mechanism for Environmental Adaptive Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "An innovative autonomous resonance-tuning (ART) energy harvester is reported that utilizes adaptive clamping systems driven by intrinsic mechanical mechanisms without outsourcing additional energy. The adaptive clamping system modulates the natural frequency of the harvester's main beam (MB) by adjusting the clamping position of the MB. The pulling force induced by the resonance vibration of the tuning beam (TB) provides the driving force for operating the adaptive clamp. The ART mechanism is possible by matching the natural frequencies of the TB and clamped MB. Detailed evaluations are conducted on the optimization of the adaptive clamp tolerance and TB design to increase the pulling force. The energy harvester exhibits an ultrawide resonance bandwidth of over 30\u00a0Hz in the commonly accessible low vibration frequency range (<100\u00a0Hz) owing to the ART function. The practical feasibility is demonstrated by evaluating the ART performance under both frequency and acceleration-variant conditions and powering a location tracking sensor.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2022-11-29", "authors": ["Dong-GyuLee", "JoonchulShin", "Hyun SooKim", "SunghoonHur", "ShuailingSun", "Ji-SooJang", "SangmiChang", "InkiJung", "SahnNahm", "HeeminKang", "Chong-YunKang", "SangtaeKim", "Jeong MinBaik", "Il-RyeolYoo", "Kyung-HoonCho", "Hyun-CheolSong"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202205179\n10.1002/aenm.202202306"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric Surgery Is Effective in Reducing Pain, Swelling, and Trismus After Removal of Impacted Lower Third Molars: A Meta-Analysis.", "abstract": "Surgery of impacted lower third molars may be associated with postoperative complications. The aim of this study is to determine whether piezoelectric surgery is effective in reducing pain, swelling, and trismus compared to conventional rotary instruments during extraction of impacted lower third molars.\nFor this systematic review, the searches were performed independently by 2 researchers. Randomized clinical trials that used the piezoelectric instrument for the removal of impacted lower third molars in humans were included. The predictor variable was the study group (piezo surgery vs rotary instruments). The main outcome was the analysis of postoperative pain, swelling, and trismus. Data analysis included risk of bias assessment (RoB 2 Cochrane) and meta-analysis with heterogeneity based on random effects I\nIn the initial results, 956 articles were revised and after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, the final sample was composed of 18 publications, all being randomized clinical trials. The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in pain scores with a Cohen's d of -0.95 [CI 95%\u00a0=\u00a0-1.23 to -0.67] of high clinical impact (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In the piezo group there was a significant increase in mouth opening of 4.29 [CI 95%\u00a0=\u00a02.33 to 6.25] mm (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Regarding swelling, Tragus-Ang and Go-eye, both showed a significant reduction in the piezo group (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). There was a significant increase of 7.32 [CI 95%\u00a0=\u00a04.40 to 10.24] minutes in the piezo group (P\u00a0<\u00a0.00001), and none of the studies showed a significant risk of bias.\nPiezo proved to be effective in reducing pain, swelling, and trismus in third molar surgeries even with longer surgical time, but due to the lack of standardization in primary studies regarding swelling, new, controlled and standardized studies should be carried out with the objective of proving the effectiveness of this therapeutic modality in the reduction of postoperative swelling.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2022-11-29", "authors": ["Daniela Guimar\u00e3es de MeloNogueira", "Jair CarneiroLe\u00e3o", "Pedro Henrique da HoraSales", "Paulo Goberl\u00e2nio de BarrosSilva", "Ana Cl\u00e1udia AmorimGomes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2022.10.020"}

Patients frequently develop an irreversible state of neuronal disfunction that lacks treatment, strongly reducing life quality and expectancy. Novel strategies are thus necessary and tissue engineering research is struggling to provide alternatives to current treatments, making use of biomaterials capable to provide cell supports and active stimuli to develop permissive environments for neural regeneration. As neuronal cells are naturally found in electrical microenvironments, the electrically active materials can pave the way for new and effective neuroregenerative therapies. In this work the influence of piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) with different surface charges and dynamic mechanoelectrical stimuli on neuron-like cells adhesion, proliferation and differentiation was addressed.

{"title": "Simulation of novel jellyfish type of process for bioremediation application.", "abstract": "A bioinspired device was fabricated as a sustainable remedial method and its performance as a membrane-enzyme reactor with cyclic ultrafiltration was investigated. The body of the jellyfish-like device was composed of two parts: 1) Jellyfish arms: Mono and co-axial electrospinning have been utilized to synthesize the flexible parts (e.g., multilayer membrane PS-PVDF/PAN/PS-PVDF) used for immobilization of aliphatic degrading enzymes, and 2) Jellyfish tentacles: Hollow fiber membranes were selected for physical immobilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degrading enzymes. To study the behavior of the membrane/enzyme reactor, the hollow fiber enzyme reactor with pulsation was operated by recycling an enzyme solution to assess ultrafiltration efficiency.

{"title": "Shape morphing of plastic films.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) architectures have qualitatively expanded the functions of materials and flexible electronics. However, current fabrication techniques for devices constrain their substrates to 2D geometries and current post-shape transformation strategies are limited to heterogenous or responsive materials and are not amenable to free-standing inert plastic films such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyimide (PI), which are vital substrates for flexible electronics. Here, we realize the shape morphing of homogeneous plastic films for various free-standing 3D frameworks from their 2D precursors by introducing a general strategy based on programming the plastic strain in films under peeling. By modulating the peeling parameters, previously inaccessible free-standing 3D geometries ranging from millimeter to micrometer were predicted theoretically and obtained experimentally. This strategy is applicable to most materials capable of plastic deformation, including polymers, metals, and composite materials, and can even enable 4D transformation with responsive plastic films.

{"title": "Pre-Matching Circuit for High-Frequency Ultrasound Transducers.", "abstract": "High-frequency ultrasound transducers offer higher spatial resolution than low-frequency ultrasound transducers; however, their maximum sensitivity are lower. Matching circuits are commonly utilized to increase the amplitude of high-frequency ultrasound transducers because the size of the piezoelectric material decreases as the operating frequency of the transducer increases. Thus, it lowers the limit of the applied voltage to the piezoelectric materials. Additionally, the electrical impedances of ultrasound transducers generally differ at the resonant-, center-, and anti-resonant-frequencies. The currently developed most-matching circuits provide electrical matching at the center frequency ranges for ultrasound transmitters and transducers. In addition, matching circuits with transmitters are more difficult to use to control the echo signal quality of the transducers because it is harder to control the bandwidth and gain of an ultrasound transmitter working in high-voltage operation. Therefore, we provide a novel pre-matching circuit method to improve the amplitude and bandwidth of high-frequency ultrasound transducers at the resonant-, center-, and anti-resonant-frequency ranges, with an ultrasound receiver and transducer. To verify the pre-matching circuit, pulse-echo response tests were conducted on the ultrasound transducers. The results show that the designed pre-matching circuits provide higher amplitude (5.63- and 2.02-times) and wider bandwidth (175.55% and 62.01%) for the high-frequency ultrasound transducer compared to the original circuit without a pre-matching circuit, and the parallel capacitor with a series-inductor circuit, respectively; therefore, the proposed pre-matching circuit is an appropriate solution for improving the amplitudes and bandwidths of high-frequency ultrasound transducers over wide frequency ranges.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-11-27", "authors": ["HojongChoi"], "doi": "10.3390/s22228861\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2004.03.004\n10.1007/978-3-030-51288-0_1\n10.1121/1.4919318\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2631224\n10.1063/1.4943492\n10.7863/jum.2004.23.10.1255\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2014.06.001\n10.1016/j.phpro.2010.01.132\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.05.028\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.10.025\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2132\n10.3390/s140406828\n10.1007/s10470-021-01857-4\n10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1588408\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2898256"}

The signal quality of the produced sensors is investigated in a frequency range from 100 Hz to 50,000 Hz and is compared with the results of piezo patches and strain gauges under the same conditions. The results show that due to a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a better coherence, the structurally integrated piezoceramics and the piezo patches are more qualified sensors for vibration measurement in the examined frequency range than the strain gauges. The measurements also indicate that the patches provide higher amplitudes for the frequency range up to 20 kHz. Beyond that, up to 40 kHz, the integrated sensors supplied higher amplitudes. The better signal quality in different frequency ranges as well as the different manufacturing and application methods can be interpreted as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the boundary conditions of the condition-monitoring system.

The linear relationship between time of flight (TOF) of the ultrasonic longitudinal wave and bolt torque was almost independent from the center frequency of the smart bolt.

Here, we study the anisotropic mechanical response of 3D-printed binary blends of poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with the isotropic mechanical response of these blends fabricated via injection molding. Various PVDF/PMMA filament compositions were produced by twin-screw extrusion and, subsequently, injection-molded or 3D printed into dog-bone shapes. Specimen mechanical and thermal properties were evaluated by mode I tensile testing and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. Results show that higher PMMA concentration not only improved the tensile strength and decreased ductility but reduced PVDF crystallization. As expected, injection-molded samples revealed better mechanical properties compared to 3D printed specimens. Interestingly, 3D printed blends with lower PMMA content demonstrated better diffusion (adhesion) across interfaces than those with a higher amount of PMMA.

{"title": "Design and Preparation of Double-Harmonic Piezoelectric Composite Lamination.", "abstract": "In this work, a new type of double-harmonic piezoelectric composite laminated structure is designed. Two bending vibration frequencies are generated by designing the structure with non-equal length and non-equal width, and the response is relatively consistent at the frequency point of the double-harmonic vibration. Firstly, the finite element software ANSYS is used to establish the simulation model of double-harmonic piezoelectric composite lamination. Two bending vibration frequencies are generated by using the non-equal length structure design, and the variation law of the conductance curve with the laminated structure is analyzed. Then, according to this law, the structure is optimized, and a non-equal width structure is further proposed in this work. Different double-harmonic piezoelectric composite laminations are prepared for comparison. The simulation and experimental results show that the value of the corresponding conductance curve at the two vibration frequency points can be increased or reduced by changing the lamination width. Then, the same conductance peak can be obtained to have a relatively consistent response at the double-harmonic frequency point.

{"title": "Electrical Detection of Vibrations of Electrospun PVDF Membranes.", "abstract": "We prepared electroactive PVDF membranes, which were subjected to mechanical as well as dual electro-mechanical signals and their responses were detected by the evoked electrical pulses. The aim was to obtain primarily electric energy that could be used for light signalling, sensing of the membrane properties and membrane motion detection. The obtained data showed the unique as well as usable properties of PVDF membranes.

In this study, we demonstrate a human-machine interface (HMI) system that uses piezoelectric sensors to translate face and tongue movements. This study addresses two issues. First, we used six piezoelectric sensors to acquire muscular facial signals to observe the sensor positions and features during winking and tongue movements. Second, we verified the proposed HMI for online simulated wheelchair control. Twelve volunteers participated in the experiment. A maximum classification accuracy of 98.0% from the maximum and mean parameters could be achieved using the linear discriminant analysis and K-nearest neighbors classification algorithms. Using the proposed algorithm, command translation patterns for command translation reached more than 95% of the average classification accuracy with 0.5 s of the window for command creation. For online control of the simulated wheelchair, the results showed high efficiency based on the time condition. The combination of winking and tongue actions results in a steering time of the same magnitude as that of joystick-based control, which is less than twice the time of a joystick.

{"title": "Magnetic Interconnects Based on Composite Multiferroics.", "abstract": "The development of magnetic logic devices dictates a need for a novel type of interconnect for magnetic signal transmission. Fast signal damping is one of the problems which drastically differs from conventional electric technology. Here, we describe a magnetic interconnect based on a composite multiferroic comprising piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials. Internal signal amplification is the main reason for using multiferroic material, where a portion of energy can be transferred from electric to magnetic domains via stress-mediated coupling. The utilization of composite multiferroics consisting of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials offers flexibility for the separate adjustment of electric and magnetic characteristics. The structure of the proposed interconnect resembles a parallel plate capacitor filled with a piezoelectric, where one of the plates comprises a magnetoelastic material. An electric field applied across the plates of the capacitor produces stress, which, in turn, affects the magnetic properties of the magnetostrictive material. The charging of the capacitor from one edge results in the charge diffusion accompanied by the magnetization change in the magnetostrictive layer. This enables the amplitude of the magnetic signal to remain constant during the propagation. The operation of the proposed interconnects is illustrated by numerical modeling. The model is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the electric field-dependent anisotropy term included. A variety of magnetic logic devices and architectures can benefit from the proposed interconnects, as they provide reliable and low-energy-consuming data transmission.

The PMUT around 200 kHz is selected to fit the system requirements. All PMUT elements on this single array are then electrically grouped into transmitter and receiver. In order to minimize the crosstalk signal between transmitter and receiver, a phase shift signal is applied at the transmitter to reduce the amplitude of the crosstalk signal by 87.8%, hence, the resultant high sensing resolution. Based on the analog signal extracted from the single PMUT array, a complete flow sensing system is built by using the cross-correlation method and cosine interpolation, whereby the change in flow rate is reflected by the time of flight difference (dTof) recorded at the receiver. Meanwhile, the acoustic path self-calibration is realized by using multiple echoes.

{"title": "Enhancing the Ammonia Selectivity by Using Nanofiber PVDF Composite Membranes Fabricated with Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes.", "abstract": "Conventional hydrophobic membrane-based membrane distillation (MD) has been applied for ammonia recovery from an anaerobic digestion (AD) effluent. However, the typical hydrophobic membranes do not have selectivity for ammonia and water vapor, which results in high energy consumption from the water evaporation. To enhance the selectivity during the ammonia recovery process, the functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber membranes were fabricated by electrospinning, and the effects of different CNTs and their contents on the performance of nanofiber membranes were investigated.

{"title": "Janus electro-microenvironment membrane with surface-selective osteogenesis/gingival healing ability for guided bone regeneration.", "abstract": "Guided bone regeneration is widely applied in clinical practice to treat alveolar bone defects. However, the rate of healing of severe alveolar bone defects is slow, and there is a high incidence of soft tissue wound dehiscence. In this study, we propose a barrier membrane with a Janus electro-microenvironment (JEM) to achieve side-selective bone regeneration and soft tissue healing. The JEM membrane was constructed using a polarized polyvinylidene fluoride ferroelectric membrane with different surface potentials on either side. It promoted osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration on the negatively polarized side (JEM-) and soft tissue regeneration on the positively polarized side (JEM+). Further investigation revealed that the JEM-mediated promotion of bone formation was related to mitochondrial autophagy, as indicated by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression of LC3, Pink I, and Parkin. Moreover, the gingival healing promoted by JEM+ was related to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, as indicated by the upregulation of mitochondrial complexes I-V and an increase in ATP generation. The design concept of the JEM provides a new avenue for regulating tissue regeneration between different tissue interfaces.", "journal": "Materials today.

{"title": "Vibration energy harvesting from tunnel invert-filling using rubberized concrete.", "abstract": "With the increasing operation mileage of urban rail transit, to ensure its operation safety, it is necessary to carry out health monitoring on the rail, tunnel, and other structures. How to capture the vibration energy generated by train operation and use it to monitor the power supply of sensors has become a research hotspot in recent years. In this paper, a new type of spherical energy harvester is designed for rubberized concrete tunnel invert-filling. Based on the calculation model of rubberized concrete tunnel invert-filling under train load, the vertical displacement, stress, voltage, and total electric energy are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The spherical energy harvester is embedded in the rubberized concrete tunnel invert-filling in the form of an array, and the optimal position is 5\u00a0mm below the sleeper. (2) Ten energy harvesters are set up in the scope of a 6-m-long rubberized concrete tunnel invert-filling. The electric energy of the millijoule level can be generated when an A-type train of 8-vehicle formation passes by. If the departure interval of 5\u00a0min/trip is calculated, the total electric energy harvesting in 1\u00a0h is 122.4\u00a0mJ. (3) Rubberized concrete tunnel invert-filling is more conducive to energy harvesting than ordinary concrete tunnel invert-filling. When the content of rubber is 10%, the total electric energy harvesting by the energy harvester array inside the tunnel invert-filling is 5% higher than that of the ordinary concrete, and the mechanical performance indexes such as stress are within the safe range. The research results of this paper have reference value for further exploration of electric energy harvesting in the running environment of rail transit trains.", "journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "date": "2022-11-24", "authors": ["HaoJin", "ZhengLi", "ZhihongWang", "ShilongTang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11356-022-24289-7\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.12.077\n10.1016/j.matlet.2008.04.068\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2005.12.011\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113969\n10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101991\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125283\n10.1007/s12205-022-1414-5\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.126409\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.125932\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.127851\n10.1109/TIE.2013.2278954\n10.3130/jaabe.9.423\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.032\n10.1016/j.measurement.2022.110992\n10.1617/s11527-013-0151-0\n10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2008)20:10(640)\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.107890\n10.15951/j.tmgcxb.2017.s1.008\n10.1016/S0008-8846(97)00204-4\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/10/105017\n10.1016/j.soildyn.2022.107246\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120071\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/12/125046\n10.1557/JMR.1997.0030\n10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.012\n10.2109/jcersj2.118.909\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.03.005\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.06.032"}

Fabricating humidity-responsive actuators that can conduct such energy transduction is of paramount importance. Herein, we incorporate covalent organic frameworks with flexible polyethylene glycol to fabricate rigid-flexible coupled membrane actuators. This strategy significantly improves the mechanical properties and humidity-responsive performance of the actuators, meanwhile, the existence of ordered structures enables us to unveil the actuation mechanism. These high-performance actuators can achieve various actuation applications and exhibit interesting self-oscillation behavior above a water surface.

{"title": "Proton beam range verification by means of ionoacoustic measurements at clinically relevant doses using a correlation-based evaluation.", "abstract": "The Bragg peak located at the end of the ion beam range is one of the main advantages of ion beam therapy compared to X-Ray radiotherapy. However, verifying the exact position of the Bragg peak within the patient online is a major challenge. The goal of this work was to achieve submillimeter proton beam range verification for pulsed proton beams of an energy of up to 220 MeV using ionoacoustics for a clinically relevant dose deposition of typically 2 Gy per fraction by i) using optimal proton beam characteristics for ionoacoustic signal generation and ii) improved signal detection by correlating the signal with simulated filter templates.\nA water tank was irradiated with a preclinical 20 MeV proton beam using different pulse durations ranging from 50 ns up to 1 \u03bcs in order to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ionoacoustic signals. The ionoacoustic signals were measured using a piezo-electric ultrasound transducer in the MHz frequency range. The signals were filtered using a cross correlation-based signal processing algorithm utilizing simulated templates, which enhances the SNR of the recorded signals. The range of the protons is evaluated by extracting the time of flight (ToF) of the ionoacoustic signals and compared to simulations from a Monte Carlo dose engine (FLUKA).\nOptimised SNR of 28.0 \u00b1 10.6 is obtained at a beam current of 4.5 \u03bcA and a pulse duration of 130 ns at a total peak dose deposition of 0.5 Gy. Evaluated ranges coincide with Monte Carlo simulations better than 0.1 mm at an absolute range of 4.21 mm. Higher beam energies require longer proton pulse durations for optimised signal generation. Using the correlation-based post-processing filter a SNR of 17.8 \u00b1 5.5 is obtained for 220 MeV protons at a total peak dose deposition of 1.3 Gy. For this clinically relevant dose deposition and proton beam energy, submillimeter range verification was achieved at an absolute range of 303 mm in water.\nOptimal proton pulse durations ensure an ideal trade-off between maximising the ionoacoustic amplitude and minimising dose deposition. In combination with a correlation-based post-processing evaluation algorithm, a reasonable SNR can be achieved at low dose levels putting clinical applications for online proton or ion beam range verification into reach.", "journal": "Frontiers in oncology", "date": "2022-11-22", "authors": ["JannisSchauer", "Hans-PeterWieser", "YuanhuiHuang", "HeinrichRuser", "JulieLascaud", "MatthiasW\u00fcrl", "AndriyChmyrov", "MarieVidal", "JoelHerault", "VasilisNtziachristos", "WalterAssmann", "KatiaParodi", "G\u00fcntherDollinger"], "doi": "10.3389/fonc.2022.925542\n10.1016/S0167-8140(99)00036-5\n10.1038/nrc.2016.18\n10.1088/0031-9155/57/11/R99\n10.1016/j.nima.2017.07.063\n10.1002/mp.12960\n10.1088/1361-6560/aae659\n10.1016/j.radonc.2017.09.042\n10.1088/1361-6633/aa8b1d\n10.7150/thno.5162\n10.1088/1361-6560/aad513\n10.1118/1.4905047\n10.1016/j.nima.2019.162935\n10.1038/srep29305\n10.1088/0031-9155/61/15/5621\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa81f8\n10.1063/1.2720455\n10.1016/j.nds.2014.07.049\n10.1109/TNS.2015.2391102\n10.1109/TNS.2015.2487266\n10.1063/1.5052059\n10.1109/TIT.1960.1057571\n10.1088/0031-9155/61/6/2213\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa9d16\n10.1002/mp.12929\n10.1137/1.9781611974669\n10.1117/1.3360308\n10.1117/1.3360308\n10.1118/1.4929939\n10.1118/1.4935865\n10.1088/1361-6560/ac3ead\n10.1016/j.pacs.2021.100240\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3008973"}

{"title": "AbsorbaTack", "abstract": "Treatment of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) often requires the use of synthetic mesh. In case of a novel and standardized bilateral apical fixation, both uterosacral ligaments are replaced by polyvinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) tapes. One of the main problems remains the fixation method, which should be stable, but also simple and quick to use. The current study evaluated biomechanical differences between the cervical tape fixation with sutures (group 1), non-absorbable tacks (group 2) and absorbable tacks (group 3) in an in vitro porcine model.\nA total of 28 trials, conducted in three groups, were performed on porcine, fresh cadaver uteri. All trials were performed until mesh, tissue or fixation device failure occurred. Primary endpoints were the biomechanical properties maximum load (N), displacement at failure (mm) and stiffness (N/mm). The failure mode was a secondary endpoint.\nThere was a significant difference between all three groups concerning the maximum load. Group 1 (sutures) supported a maximum load of 64\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u00a0N, group 2 (non-absorbable tacks) yielded 41\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0N and group 3 (absorbable tacks) achieved 15\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u00a0N. The most common failure mode was a mesh failure for group 1 and 2 and a fixation device failure for group 3.\nThe PVDF-tape fixation with sutures supports 1.5 times the load that is supported by non-absorbable tacks and 4.2 times the load that is supported by absorbable tacks. Nevertheless, there was also a stable fixation through tacks. Sutures are the significantly stronger and cheaper fixation device but may prolong the surgical time in contrast to the use of tacks.", "journal": "Archives of gynecology and obstetrics", "date": "2022-11-21", "authors": ["LudwigSebastian", "JansenAlina", "ThangarajahFabinshy", "RatiuDominik", "SauerwaldAxel", "HachenbergJens", "WegmannKilian", "RudroffClaudia", "KarapanosLeonidas", "RadosaJulia", "TrageserNadja", "EichlerChristian"], "doi": "10.1007/s00404-022-06827-3\n10.1001/jama.300.11.1311\n10.1016/j.ajog.2003.07.017\n10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181f73729\n10.1590/s1677-5538.ibju.2018.0581\n10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182a8a5e4\n10.1016/S0002-9378(94)70346-9\n10.1159/000339972\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2022.10.004\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00070-4\n10.3109/08941939.2011.589883\n10.1089/end.2018.0474\n10.21873/invivo.11690\n10.1155/2015/860784\n10.1016/j.ijgo.2016.05.007\n10.1002/ijgo.12935\n10.1007/s00464-012-2161-3\n10.1007/s00192-011-1616-8\n10.1371/journal.pone.0190137\n10.1007/s00404-021-06343-w\n10.1371/journal.pone.0144143\n10.1007/s00192-020-04609-6\n10.1007/s00192-019-03911-2\n10.1016/j.ijsu.2018.03.042\n10.1002/bjs.9750\n10.3109/13645706.2013.808228"}

In this study, using a previously published model of cavitating liquids implementable as a non-linear Helmholtz equation, it is shown that a full sonoreactor can be modelled and simulated. The model includes the full transducer and the vibrations of the vessel walls, using the physics of elastic solids and piezo-electricity. The control-loop used by the generator to set the optimal frequency is also accounted for. Apart from the geometry, the unique input of the model is the current feeding the transducer whereas the dissipated electrical power, transducer complex impedance and working frequency are available as outputs. The model is put to the test against experiments realized in different geometries, varying either the input current or the transducer immersion depth. Despite the overestimation of the power dissipated in the liquid, the evolution of the acoustic load in both cases is reasonably well reproduced by simulation, which partially validates the method used.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2022-11-20", "authors": ["IgorGarcia-Vargas", "LaurieBarthe", "PascalTierce", "OlivierLouisnard"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2022.106226"}

The polarization profiles are designed based on the electromechanical impedance response of non-uniformly polarized wafers as obtained from the theory. The circular wafers are fabricated with non-uniform polarization profiles that involve a central polarized region surrounded by an unpolarized region. The radius of the polarization zone is designed based on the condition for specific mode enhancement obtained from the electromechanical impedance response of non-uniformly polarized wafers. We actually show how the condition can not only be used to enhance but also to suppress electromechanical resonances. Two kinds of wafers are designed and fabricated to specifically suppress second and third radial modes respectively. Similarly, rectangular wafers are designed with two different kinds of non-uniform polarization profiles - the first of which enhances the second in-plane extensional mode in the impedance spectrum and the second polarization profile suppresses all the electromechanical resonances pertaining to the in-plane extensional modes and selectively excites only the in-plane bending modes.

By coupling mechanochemistry and electron-transfer processes (i.e., mechanoredox catalysis), an energy-conscious controlled radical polymerization methodology is realized. This work explores an efficient mechanoredox reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization process using mechanical stimuli by implementing piezoelectric barium titanate and a diaryliodonium initiator with minimal solvent usage. This mechanoredox RAFT process demonstrates exquisite control over poly(meth)acrylate dispersity and chain length while also showcasing an alternative to the solution-state synthesis of semifluorinated polymers that typically utilize exotic solvents and/or reagents. This chemistry will find utility in the sustainable development of materials across the energy, biomedical, and engineering communities.", "journal": "Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "date": "2022-11-18", "authors": ["ProgyategChakma", "Sarah MZeitler", "F\u00e1bioBaum", "JiatongYu", "WaseemShindy", "Lilo DPozzo", "Matthew RGolder"], "doi": "10.1002/anie.202215733"}
{"title": "Recent advances in PLLA-based biomaterial scaffolds for neural tissue engineering: Fabrication, modification, and applications.", "abstract": "Repairing and regenerating injured neural tissue remains a worldwide challenge. Tissue engineering (TE) has been highlighted as a potential solution to provide functional substitutes for damaged organs or tissue. Among the biocompatible and biodegradable materials, poly-L-lactic-acid (PLLA) has been widely investigated in the TE field because of its tunable mechanical properties and tailorable surface functionalization. PLLA-based biomaterials can be engineered as scaffolds that mimic neural tissue extracellular matrix and modulate inflammatory responses. With technological advances, PLLA-based scaffolds can also have well-controlled three-dimensional sizes and structures to facilitate neurite extension. Furthermore, PLLA-based scaffolds have the potential to be used as drug-delivery carriers with controlled release. Moreover, owing to the good piezoelectric properties and capacity to carry conductive polymers, PLLA-based scaffolds can be combined with electrical stimulation to maintain stemness and promote axonal guidance. This mini-review summarizes and discusses the fabrication and modification techniques utilized in the PLLA-based biomaterial scaffolds for neural TE. Recent applications in peripheral nerve and spinal cord regeneration are also presented, and it is hoped that this will guide the future development of more effective and multifunctional PLLA-based nerve scaffolds.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2022-11-18", "authors": ["YuanDai", "TingweiLu", "MinghaoShao", "FeizhouLyu"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2022.1011783\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01074\n10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135049\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.03.050\n10.3390/pharmaceutics14020219\n10.1089/neu.2019.6949\n10.3390/polym14061153\n10.4103/1673-5374.264461\n10.1021/acsami.9b01066\n10.1002/jbm.a.36781\n10.3390/ijms22115588\n10.3390/pharmaceutics13060848\n10.1007/s12033-021-00346-3\n10.1002/adhm.201601130\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.06.049\n10.1515/revneuro-2013-0022\n10.1088/1748-605X/abaf06\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.024\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.024\n10.1021/acschemneuro.9b00203\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.110564\n10.1002/jcb.29513\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.10.040\n10.1021/acsami.8b18344\n10.3390/ijms23031244\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120062\n10.3389/fncel.2019.00248\n10.1016/j.actbio.2022.01.042\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.110972\n10.3892/ijmm.2017.3299\n10.1016/j.msec.2017.11.020\n10.1002/smll.202107236\n10.3390/ma12152491\n10.1002/jdn.10119\n10.1007/s11064-022-03584-2\n10.1016/j.msec.2020.111858\n10.3390/gels7040196\n10.34172/bi.2020.14\n10.1097/scs.0000000000005398\n10.1007/s12015-022-10332-0\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01326\n10.1021/acsami.1c16138\n10.1159/000515549\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.266\n10.1016/j.msec.2018.09.021\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.12.032\n10.3390/nano10030415\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.09.039\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.09.037\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.119499\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01102\n10.1016/j.msec.2017.08.030\n10.1016/j.msec.2020.111415\n10.3390/ijms22073536\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120479\n10.1021/acsami.0c05024\n10.1002/adma.201301762\n10.1016/j.mtbio.2022.100381\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2018.05.016\n10.3390/ijms22073504\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0277\n10.1002/jbm.a.36053\n10.1088/1741-2552/ab8d81\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00874\n10.1039/d1tb00944c"}
{"title": "Beyond fundamental resonance mode: high-order multi-band ALN PMUT for in vivo photoacoustic imaging.", "abstract": "This paper reports on an aluminum nitride (AlN) piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) array for photoacoustic (PA) imaging, where the high-order resonance modes of the PMUT are utilized to improve imaging resolution. A flexural vibration mode (FVM) PMUT is fabricated and applied in a photoacoustic imaging (PAI) system. Specifically, the microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based PMUT is suitable for PA endoscopic imaging of blood vessels and bronchi due to its miniature size and high sensitivity. More importantly, AlN is a nontoxic material, which makes it harmless for biomedical applications. In the PAI system, the AlN PMUT array is used to detect PA signals, and the acousto-mechanical response is designed and optimized at the PMUT's fundamental resonance. In this work, we focus on the high-order resonance performance of the PMUT PAI beyond the fundamental resonance. The acoustic and electrical responses of the PMUT's high-order resonance modes are characterized and analyzed. The fundamental and three high-order resonance bandwidths are 2.2, 8.8, 18.5, and 48.2\u2009kHz. Compared with the resolution at the fundamental resonance mode, the resolutions at third- and fourth-order resonance modes increase by 38.7% and 76.9% in a phantom experiment. The high-order resonance modes of the AlN PMUT sensor array provide higher central frequency and wider bandwidth for PA signal detection, which increase the resolution of PAI compared to the PMUT working at the fundamental resonance mode.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2022-11-18", "authors": ["JunxiangCai", "YiyunWang", "DaohuaiJiang", "SongsongZhang", "Yuandong AlexGu", "LiangLou", "FeiGao", "TaoWu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41378-022-00426-7\n10.3390/s20092745\n10.3390/s91209616\n10.1126/science.1216210\n10.3390/mi9010025\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2605451\n10.1016/j.pacs.2019.100144\n10.1063/5.0049855\n10.2174/2211555211302010010\n10.1364/BOE.9.005159\n10.1007/s10832-007-9044-3\n10.3390/s19020380\n10.1002/jbio.201800034\n10.1117/1.JBO.20.6.065006\n10.1364/OL.40.002921\n10.1364/AO.55.002301\n10.1364/OL.43.000138\n10.1038/nm.2823\n10.1371/journal.pone.0092463\n10.1364/BOE.1.001278\n10.3390/s17061381\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa851b\n10.1109/JMEMS.2015.2503336\n10.1038/micronano.2017.59\n10.1063/1.4772469\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2577038\n10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2387154\n10.3390/mi11100928\n10.1109/JSEN.2011.2157490\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.05.006\n10.1109/JMEMS.2022.3161055\n10.1109/JMEMS.2021.3096733\n10.1006/jfls.1996.0051"}

Here, in order to avoid the collision of conventional galloping triboelectric nanogenerators (GTENGs), and cause material damage or noise, a freestanding gallop-based triboelectric-piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator (HG P-TENG) is proposed to reduce material wear and improve the reliability of GTENG. Two piezoelectric sheets are attached to the cantilever beam. The root-mean-square (RMS) and peak output power of the HG P-TENG are 68.9\u00a0\u03bcW and 1.27 mW, respectively. To improve the harvesting efficiency, the fixed copper electrodes are segmented, and experiments indicate that this way of segmenting electrodes can improve the\u00a0energy harvesting efficiency. Finer electrodes can effectively increase the charging rate of capacitors. A self-powered thermohygrometer and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are demonstrated in the wind tunnel.

{"title": "Investigating the feasibility of a hand-held photoacoustic imaging probe for margin assessment during breast conserving surgery.", "abstract": "Approximately 19 % of breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS) must return for a secondary surgery due to incomplete tumour removal. Our previous work demonstrated that the lower lipid content, characteristic of tumour tissue, was observed as regions of hypo-intense photoacoustic (PA) contrast. The goal of this work was to evaluate feasibility of a low-frequency, hand-held PA imaging probe for surgical margin assessment based on lipid content differences. Here, we describe (i) the design of a prototype hand-held PA imaging probe, (ii) the effect of limited-bandwidth on image contrast, (iii) accuracy towards hypo-intense contrast detection, (iv) the limited-view characteristics of the single sensor design, and (iv) early imaging results of an ex-vivo breast cancer specimen. The probe incorporates a single polyvinylidene fluoride acoustic sensor, a 1-to-4 optical fibre bundle and a polycarbonate axicon lens for light delivery. Imaging results on phantoms designed to mimic positive margins demonstrated the ability to detect gaps in optical absorption as small as 1\u202fmm in width. Compared to images from a near full-view PAI system, the hand-held PAI probe had higher signal to noise ratio but suffered from negativity image artifacts. Lumpectomy specimen imaging showed that strong signals can be obtained from the fatty tissue. Taken together, the results show this imaging approach with a hand-held probe has potential for detection of residual breast cancer tissue during BCS; however, more work is needed to reduce the size of the probe to fit within the surgical cavity.", "journal": "Photoacoustics", "date": "2022-11-18", "authors": ["ERascevska", "L C MYip", "POmidi", "MBrackstone", "J J LCarson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pacs.2022.100424\n10.1200/JCO.2014.55.1572\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2013.11.012\n10.6004/JNCCN.2021.0023\n10.1186/s12913-018-2882-7\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2018.12.043\n10.1309/AJCP4IEMXCJ1GDTS\n10.1245/s10434-012-2492-2\n10.1245/S10434-006-9126-5\n10.1117/1.3600708\n10.1117/1.JBO.23.10.100901\n10.1016/J.EJSO.2016.07.141\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3005623\n10.1364/boe.5.003684\n10.1038/srep40683\n10.1016/j.pacs.2020.100165\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4340\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2815\n10.1364/OE.21.002185\n10.1364/OE.18.008058\n10.1109/MPUL.2015.2409099\n10.1364/boe.6.001273\n10.1002/MDS3.10018\n10.1364/BOE.417056\n10.1364/BOE.6.001273\n10.1117/1.JBO.24.5.056002\n10.1117/1.3611010\n10.1088/1361-6463/ABC37D\n10.1118/1.1644531\n10.1016/J.PACS.2020.100218\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-3200\n10.1016/J.PACS.2020.100173\n10.1016/J.JID.2017.01.016\n10.1016/j.pacs.2018.02.002\n10.1016/J.PACS.2021.100290\n10.1117/1.JBO.22.4.041011\n10.3390/S21134458\n10.1016/J.PACS.2018.07.001\n10.1109/TAP.1982.1142739\n10.1016/J.PACS.2022.100404\n10.1117/1.3454392\n10.1117/1.jbo.27.8.086004\n10.1007/S11010-012-1523-4\n10.1016/J.AMJSURG.2008.06.024"}

Meanwhile, repetitive respiration generates temperature variation wherein the heat is regrettably wasted. Herein, a biocidal ZnO nanorod-modified paper (ZNR-paper) composite that is 1) integrated on a face mask, 2) harvests waste breathing-driven thermal energy, 3) facilitates the pyrocatalytic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ultimately 4) exhibits antibacterial and antiviral performance is proposed. Furthermore, in situ generated compressive/tensile strain of the composite by being attached to a curved mask is investigated for high pyroelectricity.

{"title": "On-chip generation and dynamic piezo-optomechanical rotation of single photons.", "abstract": "Integrated photonic circuits are key components for photonic quantum technologies and for the implementation of chip-based quantum devices. Future applications demand flexible architectures to overcome common limitations of many current devices, for instance the lack of tuneabilty or built-in quantum light sources. Here, we report on a dynamically reconfigurable integrated photonic circuit comprising integrated quantum dots (QDs), a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) transducers directly fabricated on a monolithic semiconductor platform. We demonstrate on-chip single photon generation by the QD and its sub-nanosecond dynamic on-chip control. Two independently applied SAWs piezo-optomechanically rotate the single photon in the MZI or spectrally modulate the QD emission wavelength. In the MZI, SAWs imprint a time-dependent optical phase and modulate the qubit rotation to the output superposition state.

Finally, the combination of the dynamic single photon control and spectral tuning of the QD realizes wavelength multiplexing of the input photon state and demultiplexing it at the output.

{"title": "Reevaluation of Piezo1 as a gut RNA sensor.", "abstract": "Piezo1 is a stretch-gated ion channel required for mechanosensation in many organ systems. Recent findings point to a new role for Piezo1 in the gut, suggesting that it is a sensor of microbial single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) rather than mechanical force. If true, this would redefine the scope of Piezo biology. Here, we sought to replicate the central finding that fecal ssRNA is a natural agonist of Piezo1. While we observe that fecal extracts and ssRNA can stimulate calcium influx in certain cell lines, this response is independent of Piezo1. Additionally, sterilized dietary extracts devoid of gut biome RNA show similar cell line-specific stimulatory activity to fecal extracts. Together, our data highlight potential confounds inherent to gut-derived extracts, exclude Piezo1 as a receptor for ssRNA in the gut, and support a dedicated role for Piezo channels in mechanosensing.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2022-11-17", "authors": ["Alec RNickolls", "Gabrielle SO'Brien", "SarahShnayder", "YunxiaoZhang", "MaximilianNagel", "ArdemPatapoutian", "Alexander TChesler"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.83346\n10.1038/ncomms2899\n10.1073/pnas.1219777110\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.034\n10.1126/scisignal.2005667\n10.1038/s41467-019-12501-1\n10.1038/nbt.4096\n10.7554/eLife.07370\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.7554/eLife.04660\n10.1073/pnas.1507309112\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.07.014\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.039\n10.1038/nature10999\n10.3324/haematol.2013.086090\n10.1038/ncomms9085\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00177\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.02.010\n10.1182/blood-2017-05-786004\n10.1126/science.1093620\n10.1002/jbmr.4198\n10.1038/s41467-021-21178-4\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.04.096\n10.1073/pnas.1414298111\n10.4049/jimmunol.1201078\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.7554/eLife.49631\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.07.025\n10.1038/ncomms9329\n10.1007/s00424-016-1811-z\n10.1074/jbc.M113.528638\n10.1038/s41467-018-03502-7\n10.1038/nrm.2017.92\n10.7554/eLife.32346\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185543\n10.1073/pnas.1817070115\n10.1073/pnas.0805323106\n10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.011\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.1007/s12551-019-00584-5\n10.1085/jgp.201912515\n10.1038/s41467-017-00429-3\n10.1038/s41467-019-09055-7\n10.1038/s41467-020-16816-2\n10.1093/intimm/dxv062\n10.1038/s41586-019-1485-8\n10.1038/s41598-017-18089-0\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.022\n10.7554/eLife.47454\n10.7554/eLife.07369\n10.1146/annurev-neuro-093020-120939\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-081720-023244\n10.1039/c0lc00641f\n10.1038/nn.3881\n10.1172/JCI87343\n10.1113/JP272718\n10.1038/s41467-018-03570-9\n10.1038/s41467-019-14146-6\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1038/nn.4162\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.11.081\n10.1111/febs.14711\n10.7554/eLife.52779"}

The objective of this study was to measure VA length changes that occur during cervical spine manipulation and to compare these to the VA failure length.\nPiezoelectric ultrasound crystals were implanted along the length of the VA (C1 to C7) and were used to measure length changes during cervical spine manipulation of seven un-embalmed, post-rigor human cadavers. Arteries were then excised, and elongation from arbitrary in-situ head/neck positions to first force (0.1 N) was measured. Following this, VA were stretched (8.33\u2009mm/s) to mechanical failure. Failure was defined as the instance when VA elongation resulted in a decrease in force.\nFrom arbitrary in-situ head/neck positions, the greatest average VA length change during spinal manipulation was [mean (range)] 5.1% (1.1 to 15.1%). From arbitrary in-situ head/neck positions, arteries were elongated on average 33.5% (4.6 to 84.6%) prior to first force occurrence and 51.3% (16.3 to 105.1%) to failure. Average failure forces were 3.4 N (1.4 to 9.7 N).\nMeasured in arbitrary in-situ head/neck positions, VA were slack. It appears that this slack must be taken up prior to VA experiencing tensile force. During cervical spine manipulations (using cervical spine extension and rotation), arterial length changes remained below that slack length, suggesting that VA elongated but were not stretched during the manipulation. However, in order to answer the question if cervical spine manipulation is safe from a mechanical perspective, the testing performed here needs to be repeated using a defined in-situ head/neck position and take into consideration other structures (e.g. carotid arteries).", "journal": "The Journal of manual & manipulative therapy", "date": "2022-11-17", "authors": ["Lindsay MGorrell", "AndrewSawatsky", "W BrentEdwards", "WalterHerzog"], "doi": "10.1080/10669817.2022.2148048\n10.1001/jama.299.6.656\n10.1186/s12998-017-0165-8\n10.1007/s00586-008-0634-9\n10.1136/neurintsurg-2022-018686"}

{"title": "Evaluating polyvinylidene fluoride - carbon black composites as solid phase microextraction coatings for the detection of urinary volatile organic compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.", "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are biomarkers of disease, which can be utilized for accurate diagnostics. The gold standard for VOC identification is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as it allows for structure elucidation and quantification. Headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) is often used in biomarker discovery due to its ability to preconcentrate VOCs prior to GC-MS analysis. However, HS-SPME GC-MS is time-consuming, expensive and requires trained personnel. Gas sensor arrays can detect VOC biomarkers at a point-of-care and therefore are more suitable for disease diagnostics in the clinic. Nevertheless, qualification and optimization of sensing layers is tedious as each VOC of interest needs to be tested individually. Therefore, using SPME fibers to extract VOCs and GC-MS to quantitate the analytes may be an efficient strategy with high throughput to tune sensing layers and increase analyte affinity. To investigate this, suspensions of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinylidene fluoride-carbon black (PVDF-CB) fabricated at varying concentration were immobilized on SPME fibers through physical deposition, used to extract urinary VOCs and were subject to GC-MS analysis. The addition of CB shows increased fiber performance in terms of total integrated signal and sensitivity toward individual VOCs. PVDF-CB fibers were compared to a commercial polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) SPME fiber run using the same method. The PVDF-CB fiber outperformed the commercial fiber in detecting numerous urinary VOCs of interest. Results of this study show not only that custom SPME fiber performance can be evaluated through GC-MS analysis, but the capability of custom fibers to adsorb urinary VOCs can be tuned based on properties of interest. Hence, this method may be utilized as an analytical tool to characterize and tune gas sensing layers with high analytical throughput.", "journal": "Journal of chromatography.

It is well known that amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) infiltrates into the collagen through the gap regions, but its underlying driving force is not understood. Based on the authors' previous observations that a collagen fibril has higher piezoelectricity at gap regions, it was hypothesized that the piezoelectric heterogeneity of collagen helps ACP infiltration through the gap. To further examine this hypothesis, the collagen piezoelectricity of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), known as brittle bone disease, is characterized by employing Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM). The OI collagen reveals similar piezoelectricity between gap and overlap regions, implying that losing piezoelectric heterogeneity in OI collagen results in abnormal intrafibrillar mineralization and, accordingly, losing the benefit of mechanical heterogeneity from the fibrillar level.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Gas Sensors with Polycomposite Coatings in Biomedical Application.", "abstract": "When developing methods for diagnosing pathologies and diseases in humans and animals using electronic noses, one of the important trends is the miniaturization of devices, while maintaining significant information for diagnostic purposes. A combination of several sorbents that have unique sorption features of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on one transducer is a possible option for the miniaturization of sensors for gas analysis. This paper considers the principles of creating polycomposite coatings on the electrodes of piezoelectric quartz resonators, including the choice of sorbents for the formation of sensitive layers, determining the mass and geometry of the formation of sensitive layers in a polycomposite coating, as well as an algorithm for processing the output data of sensors to obtain maximum information about the qualitative and quantitative composition of the gas phase. A comparative analysis of the efficiency and kinetics of VOC vapor sorption by sensors with polycomposite coatings and a set of sensors with relevant single coatings has been carried out. Regression equations have been obtained to predict the molar-specific sensitivity of the microbalance of VOC vapors by a sensor with a polycomposite coating of three sorbents with an error of 5-15% based on the results of the microbalance of VOC vapors on single coatings. A method for creating \"visual prints\" of sensor signals with polycomposite coatings is shown, with results comparable to those from an array of sensors.

Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was chosen as the device to be tested. Recently, QCMs found use in many fields of study such as biology, chemistry, and aerospace. They often operate in harsh environments and are exposed to many external factors including temperature fluctuations, to which QCMs are highly susceptible. Such disturbances can cause undesirable resonant frequency shifts resulting in measurement errors that are difficult to eliminate. The proposed solution enables measurements of QCMs thermal characteristics, effectiveness evaluation of temperature compensation methods, and testing of the frequency stability. As a part of the developed solution, two independent temperature regulators were used: first to maintain the QCM crystal at desired temperature, and second to keep the QCM oscillator circuit at fixed temperature. The single regulator consists of a thermoelectric module (TEC) used for both heating and cooling. Two considered TEC driving methods were compared in terms of EMI and their impact on the QCM signal quality.

One way to obtain additional diagnostic information quickly is to study the volatile metabolome of biosamples using arrays of sensors. The goal of this work was to assess the possibility of using an array of chemical sensors with various sensitive coatings to determine the presence of a bacterial infection in children by analyzing the equilibrium gas phase (EGP) of urine samples. The EGP of 90 urine samples from children with and without a bacterial infection (urinary tract infection, soft tissue infection) was studied on the \"MAG-8\" device with seven piezoelectric sensors in a hospital. General urine analysis with sediment microscopy was performed using a Uriscan Pro analyzer and using an Olympus CX31 microscope. After surgical removal of the source of inflammation, the microbiological studies of the biomaterial were performed to determine the presence and type of the pathogen. The most informative output data of an array of sensors have been established for diagnosing bacterial pathology.

However, VEH (vibration energy harvester) based on PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) piezoelectric materials have a low output power and energy conversation efficiency due to the relatively low piezoelectric constant, coupling coefficient, and dielectric constant. For this reason, we design a vibration energy conversion power supply, which consists of a VEH with a PVDF piezoelectric thin film planar array vibration structure and an energy harvesting circuit for regulating the electric energy of multiple sources. Furthermore, our solution was validated by simulations of structural dynamics in COMSOL and equivalent circuits model in Multisim. From the circuitry simulation results, the output current and the charging period increase and decrease, doubling, respectively, for each doubling of the number of array groups of films. Moreover, the solid mechanics simulation results show that the planar array structure makes the phase and amplitude of the input vibration waves as consistent as possible so that the same theoretical enhancement effect of the circuitry model is achieved. An identical experimental test was implemented with vibration conditions of 75 Hz-2.198 g. The fabricated harvester quickly charged the 22 V-0.022 F ultracapacitor bank to 5 V in 24 min. The maximum open circuit voltage and output power, respectively, were 10.4 V and 0.304 mW. This maximum charging power was 11.69 times higher than that of a single film.

In this paper, the bifurcation theory is applied to quantitatively reveal the effects of structural parameters on the statics and dynamics of a quad-stable energy harvester (QEH). Firstly, a novel QEH system utilizing the geometric nonlinearity of springs is proposed. Static bifurcation analysis is carried out to design quad-stable working conditions. To investigate the cross-well and high-energy vibration, the complex dynamic frequency (CDF) method, suitable for both weakly and strongly nonlinear dynamic problems, is then applied to deduce the primary response solution. By using the unfolding analysis in singularity theory, four steady-state properties and dozens of primary resonance modes are demonstrated. Based on the transition set, the effective bandwidth for energy harvesting can be customized to adapt well to various vibration environments by parametric adjustment. Finally, the experimental tests verify that the output power can reach up to 1 mW.

{"title": "Ultrasonic Guided Waves for Liquid Water Localization in Fuel Cells: An Ex Situ Proof of Principle.", "abstract": "Water management is a key issue in the design and operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). For an efficient and stable operation, the accumulation of liquid water inside the flow channels has to be prevented. Existing measurement methods for localizing water are limited in terms of the integration and application of measurements in operating PEMFC stacks. In this study, we present a measurement method for the localization of liquid water based on ultrasonic guided waves. Using a sparse sensing array of four piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS), the measurement requires only minor changes in the PEMFC cell design. The measurement method is demonstrated with ex situ measurements for water drop localization on a single bipolar plate. The wave propagation of the guided waves and their interaction with water drops on different positions of the bipolar plate are investigated. The complex geometry of the bipolar plate leads to complex guided wave responses. Thus, physical modeling of the wave propagation and tomographic methods are not suitable for the localization of the water drops. Using machine learning methods, it is demonstrated that the position of a water drop can be obtained from the guided wave responses despite the complex geometry of the bipolar plate.

{"title": "Efficacy and Damage Diagnosis of Reinforced Concrete Columns and Joints Strengthened with FRP Ropes Using Piezoelectric Transducers.", "abstract": "Recent research has indicated that the implantation of a network of piezoelectric transducer patches in element regions of potential damage development, such as the beam-column joint (BCJ) area, substantially increases the efficacy and accuracy of the structural health monitoring (SHM) methods to identify damage level, providing a reliable diagnosis. The use of piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers for the examination of the efficiency of an innovative strengthening technique of reinforced concrete (RC) columns and BCJs is presented and commented on. Two real-scale RC BCJ subassemblages were constructed for this investigation. The columns and the joint panel of the second subassemblage were externally strengthened with carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (C-FRP) ropes. To examine the efficiency of this strengthening technique we used the following transducers: (a) PZT sensors on the ropes and the concrete; (b) tSring linear variable displacement transducers (SLVDTs), diagonally installed on the BCJ, to measure the shear deformations of the BCJ panel; (c) Strain gauges on the internal steel bars. From the experimental results, it became apparent that the PZT transducers successfully diagnosed the loading step at which the primary damage occurred in the first BCJ subassemblage and the damage state of the strengthened BCJ during the loading procedure. Further, data acquired from the diagonal SLVDTs and the strain gauges provided insight into the damage state of the two tested specimens at each step of the loading procedure and confirmed the diagnosis provided by the PZT transducers. Furthermore, data acquired by the PZT transducers, SLVDTs and strain gauges proved the effectiveness of the applied strengthening technique with C-FRP ropes externally mounted on the column and the conjunction area of the examined BCJ subassemblages.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["Chris GKarayannis", "EmmanouilGolias", "Maria CNaoum", "Constantin EChalioris"], "doi": "10.3390/s22218294\n10.12989/eas.2018.15.6.617\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.11.009\n10.1080/13632469.2018.1531091\n10.12989/sem.2002.13.1.017\n10.1002/eqe.785\n10.2495/MC090261\n10.12989/smm.2014.1.3.323\n10.1016/j.istruc.2021.06.028\n10.1016/j.jobe.2022.104087\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2022.104597\n10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0000781\n10.3390/fib8020013\n10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0000950\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.124365\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2013.04.021\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112206\n10.1177/1369433220969028\n10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103445\n10.1016/j.istruc.2021.08.042\n10.1088/1757-899X/933/1/012037\n10.1016/j.cscm.2021.e00567\n10.3390/fib6040099\n10.3390/app12157419\n10.1016/j.istruc.2021.10.024\n10.12989/eas.2021.20.1.123\n10.3390/fib6030052\n10.3390/su13116454\n10.1115/1.1421056\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2004.05.018\n10.12989/smm.2014.1.1.001\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.05.042\n10.3390/s21237918\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.07.047\n10.1007/s11803-003-0005-9\n10.3390/s19020383\n10.1177/1045389X11414219\n10.1088/2631-8695/abded9\n10.3390/s17020394\n10.3390/s18124312\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/4/047001\n10.3390/s16081343\n10.3390/s18114018\n10.1515/eng-2015-0046\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.3390/s19173775\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.09.006\n10.3390/app10010050\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.113305\n10.3390/fib10030028\n10.3390/fib9070042\n10.12989/eas.2019.16.2.141\n10.12989/smm.2015.2.2.165\n10.2174/2405465801666160830155120\n10.3390/s21030679\n10.3390/fib10010005\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/2/018\n10.3970/sdhm.2007.003.211\n10.1016/j.cscm.2016.03.003\n10.2495/ERES150191\n10.3390/s8010327\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.074\n10.3390/s18092953\n10.3390/s17122880\n10.3390/ma14237168"}

{"title": "A Flexible Piezoelectric Device for Frequency Sensing from PVDF/SWCNT Composite Fibers.", "abstract": "Polymer piezoelectric devices have been widely studied as sensors, energy harvesters, and generators with flexible and simple processes. Flexible piezoelectric devices are sensitive to external stimuli and are attracting attention because of their potential and usefulness as acoustic sensors. In this regard, the frequency sensing of sound must be studied to use flexible piezoelectric devices as sensors. In this study, a flexible piezoelectric device composed of a polymer and an electrode was successfully fabricated. Polyvinylidene fluoride, the active layer of the piezoelectric device, was prepared by electrospinning, and electrodes were formed by dip-coating in a prepared single-walled carbon nanotube dispersion. The output voltage of the external sound was matched with the input frequency through a fast Fourier transform, and frequency matching was successfully performed, even with mechanical stimulation. In a high-frequency test, the piezoelectric effect and frequency domain peak started to decrease sharply at 300 Hz, and the limit of the piezoelectric effect and sensing was observed from 800 Hz. The results of this study suggest a method for developing flexible piezoelectric-fiber frequency sensors based on piezoelectric devices for acoustic sensor systems.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["SejinChoi", "JihwanLim", "HansolPark", "Han SeongKim"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14214773\n10.1063/5.0044997\n10.1121/1.3543957\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.22\n10.1080/10916466.2015.1044613\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2630008\n10.1785/0120080155\n10.1038/s41598-020-73178-x\n10.3390/mi12020218\n10.1002/adma.201302397\n10.1021/nl4013002\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107164\n10.1002/mop.25688\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.01.023\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.01.008\n10.1021/acsanm.0c01551\n10.1016/j.apmt.2019.100539\n10.1039/C8RA10315A\n10.1021/acsnano.5b01478\n10.1088/0957-0233/17/12/R01\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111672\n10.3390/s20185214\n10.1002/aenm.201301624\n10.1002/advs.202002817\n10.3390/s20144051\n10.1023/A:1017959111402\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.03.038\n10.1063/5.0051431\n10.1002/adma.201904020\n10.1039/c1jm11445j\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/095044\n10.3390/s18113605\n10.1002/pen.20885\n10.1023/A:1004689205706\n10.1002/polb.10035\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.12.019\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.04.118\n10.1039/C3RA45134H\n10.1002/elsc.201400144\n10.1007/s10965-015-0765-8\n10.1039/c4cp01004c\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.01.051\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/5/055018\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2856082"}

The length effects of the CF on the thermal conductivity, polymer crystallization behaviors, and mechanical properties of the PVDF composites were studied. The through-plane thermal conductivity of the PVDF composites increased significantly with the rise in CF loadings. The highest thermal conductivity of 2.89 W/(m\u2219K) was achieved for the PVDF composites containing 40 wt.% shorter CFs, ~17 times higher than that of the pure PVDF (~0.17 W/(m\u2219K)). The shorter CFs had more pronounced thermal conductive enhancement effects than the original longer CFs at higher filler loadings.

{"title": "Facile One-Step Synthesis of PVDF Bead-on-String Fibers by Pressurized Gyration for Reusable Face Masks.", "abstract": "Single-use face masks pose a threat to the environment and are not cost-effective, which prompts the need for developing reusable masks. In this study, pressurized gyration (PG) successfully produced bead-on-string polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers with fiber diameters ranging from 2.3 \u03bcm to 26.1 \u03bcm, and bead diameters ranging from 60.9 \u03bcm to 88.5 \u03bcm by changing the solution parameters. The effect of the solution parameters on the crystalline phase was studied by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), where the \u03b2-phase contents of PG PVDF fibers reached over 75%. The fiber morphology and \u03b2-phase contents of PG PVDF fibers indicated the potential mechanical and electrostatic filtration efficiency of PG PVDF fibers, respectively. Additionally, the hydrophobicity was investigated by static water contact angle tests, and the PVDF fibers showed superior hydrophobicity properties (all samples above 125\u00b0) over commercial polypropylene (PP) single-use masks (approximately 107\u00b0).

{"title": "Competition between Ferroelectric and Ferroelastic Domain Wall Dynamics during Local Switching in Rhombohedral PMN-PT Single Crystals.", "abstract": "The possibility to control the charge, type, and density of domain walls allows properties of ferroelectric materials to be selectively enhanced or reduced. In ferroelectric-ferroelastic materials, two types of domain walls are possible: pure ferroelectric and ferroelastic-ferroelectric. In this paper, we demonstrated a strategy to control the selective ferroelectric or ferroelastic domain wall formation in the (111) single-domain rhombohedral PMN-PT single crystals at the nanoscale by varying the relative humidity level in a scanning probe microscopy chamber. The solution of the corresponding coupled electro-mechanical boundary problem allows explaining observed competition between ferroelastic and ferroelectric domain growth. The reduction in the ferroelastic domain density during local switching at elevated humidity has been attributed to changes in the electric field spatial distribution and screening effectiveness.

The early detection of cancer contributes to early diagnosis and subsequent treatment. How to detect early cancer has become one of the hot research directions of cancer. Tumor biomarkers, biochemical parameters for reflecting cancer occurrence and progression have caused much attention in cancer early detection. Due to high sensitivity, convenience and low cost, biosensors have been largely developed to detect tumor biomarkers. This review describes the application of various biosensors in detecting tumor markers. Firstly, several typical tumor makers, such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), carbohydrate, antigen19-9 (CA19-9) and tumor suppressor p53 (TP53), which may be helpful for early cancer detection in the clinic, are briefly described. Then, various biosensors, mainly focusing on electrochemical biosensors, optical biosensors, photoelectrochemical biosensors, piezoelectric biosensors and aptamer sensors, are discussed.

{"title": "Investigation of Needle Motion Profile Effect on Diesel Spray in Near-Nozzle Field.", "abstract": "A variety of needle-motion profiles are used in diesel injectors. However, it is unclear what the underlying mechanism is to determine the needle-motion profiles and how they affect the spray dynamics. It has been of significant interest to examine how the spray dynamics will change if only altering the needle valve opening speed or closing speed while all other parameters are kept the same. The different needle-motion profiles were obtained using a piezo nozzle (Nozzle #P) and a solenoid nozzle (Nozzle #S), which have identical nozzle geometry. By utilizing the X-ray imaging technique, it was observed that the average needle valve speed of Nozzle #P was 51% higher at the opening stage but 17% lower at the closing stage than Nozzle #S. When the needle valve lift is low (approximately 200 \u03bcm), the needle valve opening speed has a crucial effect on spray dynamics. The faster needle valve opening of Nozzle #P results in a 42% larger spray spreading angle and 34% lower spray velocity at the downstream field. The spray dynamics may be controllable by properly designing the needle-motion profiles in the scenarios of the low needle lifts. However, when the needle valve is sufficiently open (approximately over 200 \u03bcm), almost identical spray characteristics were observed regardless of the needle-motion profiles.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["YaGao", "WeidiHuang", "Raditya HendraPratama", "HuifengGong", "JinWang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13111944\n10.1016/j.fuel.2016.03.097\n10.1177/1468087416688805\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.07.038\n10.1016/j.fuel.2015.01.097\n10.4271/2008-01-0936\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.06.102\n10.1115/ICES2009-76148\n10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.062\n10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2016.08.004\n10.2298/TSCI190925289X\n10.4271/2013-24-0146\n10.1243/PIME_PROC_1996_210_276_02\n10.4271/980811\n10.4271/1999-01-0527\n10.4271/2007-01-0250\n10.1007/s40430-017-0801-1\n10.1115/ICEF2009-14076\n10.1615/AtomizSpr.2015011058\n10.1016/j.enconman.2016.01.038\n10.1016/j.fuel.2020.119088\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121838\n10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2018.12.022\n10.1016/j.fuel.2017.06.012\n10.4271/2014-01-1426\n10.1016/j.fuel.2016.04.042\n10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122303\n10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123406\n10.1016/j.fuel.2004.10.009\n10.3390/en13143734\n10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2009.03.011\n10.1615/AtomizSpr.v21.i1.30\n10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2019.04.018"}
{"title": "AlScN Film Based Piezoelectric Micromechanical Ultrasonic Transducer for an Extended Long-Range Detection.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) have been widely applied in distance sensing. However, the sensing distance of currently reported miniaturized ultrasonic sensors (e.g., PMUTs or CMUT) is still limited up to a certain range (e.g., \u22645 m) compared to conventional bulk ultrasonic devices. This paper reports a PMUT array design using scandium-doped aluminum nitride (AlScN) as its piezoelectric layer for an extended long-range detection purpose. To minimize air attenuation, our device is resonating at 66 kHz for a high receive sensitivity of 5.7 mV/Pa. The proposed PMUT array can generate a sound pressure level (SPL) as high as 120 dB at a distance of 10 cm without beam forming. This PMUT design is catered for a pin-to-pin replacement of the current commercial bulk ultrasonic ranging sensor and works directly with the conventional range finding system (e.g., TI PGA460). In comparison with the common bulk transducer, the size of our device is 80% smaller. With the identical ranging detection setup, the proposed PMUT array improves the system SNR by more than 5 dB even at a distance as far as 6.8 m. The result of extended sensing distance validates our miniaturized PMUT array as the optimized candidate for most ultrasonic ranging applications.

{"title": "Two-Degree-of-Freedom Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from Vortex-Induced Vibration.", "abstract": "In recent years, vortex-induced vibration (VIV) has been widely employed to collect small-scale wind energy as a renewable energy source for microelectronics and wireless sensors. In this paper, a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) VIV-based piezoelectric energy harvester (VIVPEH) was designed, and its aerodynamic characteristics were thoroughly investigated. First, based on the traditional model theory and combined with the knowledge of vibration dynamics, the governing equations of the 2DOF VIVPEH were established. The dynamic responses, including the displacement and voltage output, were numerically simulated. Compared with the traditional 1DOF VIVPEH, the 2DOF VIVPEH proposed in this paper produced two lock-in regions for broadband wind energy harvesting. Furthermore, it was unveiled that the first- and second-order resonances were induced in the first and lock-in regions, respectively. Subsequently, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the influences of the circuit and mechanical parameters on the energy harvesting performance of the 2DOF VIVPEH. It was found that when the 2DOF VIVPEH was induced to vibrate in different lock-in regions, its optimal resistance became different. Moreover, by varying the masses and stiffnesses of the primary and secondary DOFs, we could adjust the lock-in regions in terms of their bandwidths, locations, and amplitudes, which provides a possibility for further customization and optimization.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["DeLu", "ZhiqingLi", "GuobiaoHu", "BoZhou", "YaowenYang", "GuiyongZhang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13111936\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112166\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108419\n10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115466\n10.1016/j.apor.2015.03.003\n10.1063/1.5126476\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.01.028\n10.1109/TMECH.2014.2308182\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.041\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114034\n10.1063/1.5109457\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112835\n10.1007/s11071-014-1355-8\n10.1109/48.972090\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.262\n10.1002/er.5228\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(1990)116:6(1392)\n10.1177/1045389X14538329\n10.1063/1.5042774\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.11.019\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab0852\n10.1063/1.4748794\n10.1177/1045389X14541494\n10.1177/1045389X13498315\n10.7567/JJAP.53.060302\n10.1002/er.5878\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107301\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/6/065016\n10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113991\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(1999)125:3(263)\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2003.12.004\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108339\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108724"}

It may be viewed as a unique way to operate atomic force microscopy with a ferromagnetic tip. The enhancement of magnetic signal resolution, the utilization of external fields during measurement, and quantitative data analysis are now the main areas of MFM development. We describe a new structure of MFM design based on a cryogen-free superconducting magnet. The piezoelectric tube (PZT) was implemented with a tip-sample coarse approach called SpiderDrive. The technique uses a magnetic tip on the free end of a piezo-resistive cantilever which oscillates at its resonant frequency. We obtained a high-quality image structure of the magnetic domain of commercial videotape under extreme conditions at 5 K, and a high magnetic field up to 11 T. When such a magnetic field was gradually increased, the domain structure of the videotape did not change much, allowing us to maintain the images in the specific regions to exhibit the performance. In addition, it enabled us to locate the sample region in the order of several hundred nanometers.

{"title": "Nondestructive Wafer Level MEMS Piezoelectric Device Thickness Detection.", "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel nondestructive wafer scale thin film thickness measurement method by detecting the reflected picosecond ultrasonic wave transmitting between different interfacial layers. Unlike other traditional approaches used for thickness inspection, this method is highly efficient in wafer scale, and even works for opaque material. As a demonstration, we took scandium doped aluminum nitride (AlScN) thin film and related piezoelectric stacking layers (e.g. Molybedenum/AlScN/Molybdenum) as the case study to explain the advantages of this approach. In our experiments, a laser with a wavelength of 515 nm was used to first measure the thickness of (1) a single Molybdenum (Mo) electrode layer in the range of 100-300 nm, and (2) a single AlScN piezoelectric layer in the range of 600-1000 nm. Then, (3) the combined stacking layers were measured. Finally, (4) the thickness of a standard piezoelectric composite structure (Mo/AlScN/Mo) was characterized based on the conclusions and derivation extracted from the aforementioned sets of experiments. This type of standard piezoelectric composite has been widely adopted in a variety of Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices such as the Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (PMUT), the Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR), the Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) and more.

Six parallel kinematics revolute-revolute-revolute-revolute (RRRR) branched chains were used to create a 6-RRRR CPM for superior mechanical performance. Three in-plane and three out-of-plane chains were combined using a two-in-one structure to ensure fabrication feasibility. A two-in-one 6-RRRR CPM was employed to build the proposed NPS. Second, the mechanical performance was analyzed. High-efficiency finite-element modeling approaches were derived using the compliance-based matrix method (CMM) and a pseudo-rigid body model (PRBM). The model included both 6-RRRR CPM and NPS. The simulation results validated the static and dynamic performance, and the experimental results verified the kinematics.

{"title": "Constant-Power versus Constant-Voltage Actuation in Frequency Sweeps for Acoustofluidic Applications.", "abstract": "Supplying a piezoelectric transducer with constant voltage or constant power during a frequency sweep can lead to different results in the determination of the acoustofluidic resonance frequencies, which are observed when studying the acoustophoretic displacements and velocities of particles suspended in a liquid-filled microchannel. In this work, three cases are considered: (1) Constant input voltage into the power amplifier, (2) constant voltage across the piezoelectric transducer, and (3) constant average power dissipation in the transducer. For each case, the measured and the simulated responses are compared, and good agreement is obtained. It is shown that Case 1, the simplest and most frequently used approach, is largely affected by the impedance of the used amplifier and wiring, so it is therefore not suitable for a reproducible characterization of the intrinsic properties of the acoustofluidic device. Case 2 strongly favors resonances at frequencies yielding the lowest impedance of the piezoelectric transducer, so small details in the acoustic response at frequencies far from the transducer resonance can easily be missed.

{"title": "Airline Point-of-Care System on Seat Belt for Hybrid Physiological Signal Monitoring.", "abstract": "With a focus on disease prevention and health promotion, a reactive and disease-centric healthcare system is revolutionized to a point-of-care model by the application of wearable devices. The convenience and low cost made it possible for long-term monitoring of health problems in long-distance traveling such as flights. While most of the existing health monitoring systems on aircrafts are limited for pilots, point-of-care systems provide choices for passengers to enjoy healthcare at the same level. Here in this paper, an airline point-of-care system containing hybrid electrocardiogram (ECG), breathing, and motion signals detection is proposed. At the same time, we propose the diagnosis of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) on flights as an application of this system to satisfy the inevitable demands for sleeping on long-haul flights.

{"title": "Development of an Inkjet Setup for Printing and Monitoring Microdroplets.", "abstract": "Inkjet printing is a digitally controlled additive technology that allows the precise deposition of droplets. Because it is additive, it enables geometries usually unattainable by other technologies. Because it is digitally controlled, its output is easily modulated, even during operation. Combined with the development of functional materials and their micrometer precision, it can be applicable in a wide range of fields beyond the traditional graphic industry, such as medical diagnosis, electronics manufacturing, and the fabrication of microlenses. In this work, a solution based on open-source hardware and software was implemented instead of choosing a commercial alternative, making the most of inkjet flexibility in terms of inks, substrates, and actuation signal. First, a piezoelectric printhead from MicroFab, driven by an ArduinoDue, was mounted in a 3D printer adapted to ensure precise movement in three dimensions. Then, a monitoring system using a USB digital microscope and a computational algorithm was integrated. Both systems combined allow the printing and measurement of microdroplets by digital regulation of a unipolar signal. Finally, based on a theoretical model and a set of experimentally collected samples, the curve that relates the unipolar signal amplitude to the size of the microdroplets was estimated with an acceptable range of prediction uncertainty.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["BeatrizCavaleiro de Ferreira", "TiagoCoutinho", "MiguelAyala Botto", "SusanaCardoso"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13111878\n10.1007/s00170-018-1932-y\n10.1557/PROC-769-H8.3\n10.1117/12.384419\n10.2320/matertrans.45.1794\n10.1126/science.1228183\n10.3390/ma9110910\n10.1147/rd.283.0314\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/11/115005\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.3.034005\n10.1063/1.2234853\n10.1146/annurev.fluid.38.050304.092144\n10.1063/1.1773551\n10.1016/S0262-8856(98)00160-7"}

{"title": "A Linear Ultrasonic Motor Based on Coupling Vibration Mode.", "abstract": "A coupled linear ultrasonic motor (LUSM) based on an eccentric constraint was proposed. Two pieces of oblique piezoelectric ceramics were arranged at each end of the elastomer, and the polarization direction of the ceramics was vertically upward. Using the tilting characteristics of the piezoelectric ceramics, the two ends of the fixed piezoelectric ceramics formed an eccentric restraint on the motor, providing conditions for the motor to generate coupled modes. When the elastomer of the motor generated the coupling vibration, the motion trajectories of the driving feet ends were oblique straight lines, and the oblique straight-line motion trajectories of the upper and lower driving feet ends were in opposite directions, driving the upper and lower sliders to run simultaneously. The stator parameters were optimized by using ANSYS to obtain larger amplitudes for the ends of the driving feet in both X and Z directions. The structure and operation principle of the motor are explained in detail. A prototype was fabricated to study the arrangement scheme with fixed constraints at the ends of the motor.

{"title": "Influence of Dispersed TiO", "abstract": "Herein, the influence of various contents of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles and the comprehensive properties of PVDF/TiO2 composite membranes via the steric hindrance interaction was systematically explored. Hydrophilic PEG was employed as a dispersing surfactant of TiO2 nanoparticles in the pre-dispersion process and as a pore-forming additive in the following membrane preparation process. The slight overlap shown in the TEM image and low TSI value (<1) of the composite casting solution indicated the effective dispersion and stabilization under the steric interaction with a PEG content of 6 wt.%. Properties such as the surface pore size, the development of finger-like structures, permeability, hydrophilicity and Zeta potential were obviously enhanced. The improved antifouling performance between the membrane surface and foulants was corroborated by less negative free energy of adhesion (about \u221242.87 mJ/m2), a higher interaction energy barrier (0.65 KT) and low flux declination during the filtration process. The high critical flux and low fouling rate both in winter and summer as well as the long-term running operation in A/O-MBR firmly supported the elevated antifouling performance, which implies a promising application in the municipal sewage treatment field.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["JieZhang", "ZicongJian", "MinminJiang", "BoPeng", "YuanyuanZhang", "ZhichaoWu", "JunjianZheng"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12111118\n10.1016/j.biortech.2018.09.061\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130763\n10.1016/j.biortech.2017.10.027\n10.1080/15422119.2014.926274\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.11.059\n10.3390/membranes12020245\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.08.003\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.11.014\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.06.164\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.06.032\n10.3390/membranes12040386\n10.1016/j.jece.2021.106250\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.06.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.05.006\n10.1007/s11356-012-1273-6\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.117631\n10.1016/j.msec.2020.110787\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125282\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.02.007\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118531\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117495\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117443\n10.1016/j.watres.2019.115195\n10.1016/j.desal.2006.11.005\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.030\n10.3390/membranes11110876\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.01.031\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.07.001\n10.3390/polym9120718\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.010\n10.1016/j.watres.2012.02.030\n10.3390/membranes12020161"}
{"title": "Effect of Electrode Morphology on Performance of Ionic Actuators Based on Vat Photopolymerized Membranes.", "abstract": "Bucky gel electrodes are composed of morphology-determining polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filled with carbon nanotubes (CNT). The electrodes are commonly fabricated via the casting of a CNT dispersion containing PVDF and ionic liquid. In this study, several pore-forming additives such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and the common ionic liquid BMIMBF4 were used to control the morphology of the bucky gel electrodes. The crystalline phase type and content of PVDF in the electrodes were determined by FT-IR and DSC, respectively. SEM revealed a sponge-like structure in the case of the use of BMIMBF4 and a spherulite structure if PEG and DBP were used as additives. A strong influence of morphology on the anisotropic increase in the volume of electrodes upon impregnation with electrolyte was observed. The PEG-based electrode elongated more than the others, while the BMIMBF4-based electrode thickened to a greater extent. Ionic actuators were fabricated to experimentally reveal the effect of electrode morphology on their electromechanical efficiency. A high-precision vat photopolymerization technique was used to fabricate identical ionic membranes and minimize their influence on the properties of the actuators. The electrodes were characterized by the same porosity and electrical capacitance, while the actuators differ significantly in performance. As a result, a simple method of using pore-forming additives made it possible to increase the maximum deformation of bucky gel ionic actuators by 1.5 times by changing the morphology of the electrodes.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["Oleg SMorozov", "Anna VIvanchenko", "Sergey SNechausov", "Boris ABulgakov"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12111110\n10.5772/intechopen.75085\n10.1089/soro.2013.0006\n10.1007/s42235-022-00153-9\n10.1295/polymj.27.436\n10.2139/SSRN.3323672\n10.1007/978-3-030-50476-2_6\n10.1007/s42235-018-0065-1\n10.1109/ICSE49846.2020.9166899\n10.1115/IPACK2011-52259\n10.1088/0964-1726/7/6/001\n10.1177/1045389X03034976\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.07.061\n10.1021/cm020918k\n10.1016/j.synthmet.2003.10.005\n10.1002/anie.200462318\n10.1038/srep06913\n10.1002/admt.201800519\n10.1038/ncomms3208\n10.1038/ncomms13576\n10.3390/membranes12030316\n10.1016/j.dib.2019.104626\n10.1126/science.1082289\n10.1016/j.electacta.2008.02.113\n10.1016/j.matpr.2016.02.030\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.034\n10.1002/adfm.201802464\n10.1038/s41467-018-03095-1\n10.5796/electrochemistry.81.849\n10.3390/polym13234137\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.06.002\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.04.056\n10.1021/acsami.8b04250\n10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989496\n10.1002/adma.201906564\n10.1021/am401351q\n10.1002/adfm.201000570\n10.18321/ectj957\n10.1088/1757-899X/683/1/012060\n10.1039/b615950h\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.04.001\n10.1016/j.electacta.2008.10.007\n10.1063/1.1516269\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1016/j.dib.2022.108395\n10.1016/j.addma.2022.102895"}

{"title": "Rupture Prediction for Microscopic Oocyte Images of Piezo Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection by Principal Component Analysis.", "abstract": "Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has progressed rapidly, resulting in a great improvement in the clinical pregnancy ratio. When applying the protocol of piezo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (Piezo-ICSI), it is very important to puncture the zona pellucida and the oocyte cytoplasmic membrane without rupturing the oocyte cytoplasmic membrane. Previous studies have shown that the poor extensibility of the oocyte cytoplasmic membrane might be closely related to rupture. However, no consensus has been reached regarding how the quality of the oocyte for extensible ability or rupture possibility affects the surfaces of the oocyte on the microscopic frames. We conducted this study to provide evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are superior for predicting the tendency of oocyte rupture before puncturing on Piezo-ICSI. To inspect it, we provided a retrospective trial of 38 rupture oocytes and 55 nonruptured oocytes. This study marked the highest accuracy of 91.4% for predicting oocytes rupture using the support-vector machine method of machine learning. We conclude that AI technologies might serve an important role and provide a significant benefit to ART.", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["NaomiYagi", "HyodoTsuji", "TakashiMorimoto", "TomohiroMaekawa", "ShimpeiMizuta", "TomomotoIshikawa", "YutakaHata"], "doi": "10.3390/jcm11216546\n10.1002/rmb2.12434\n10.1093/humrep/deab198\n10.1016/0140-6736(92)92425-F\n10.1007/BF02070146\n10.1095/biolreprod52.4.709\n10.1093/humrep/14.2.448\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a019012\n10.1093/humupd/dmv050\n10.1016/0031-3203(95)00067-4\n10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2118750\n10.1109/TIM.2010.2057552\n10.1530/REP-18-0523\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2019.07.825\n10.1016/j.rbmo.2022.09.011\n10.1080/14786440109462720\n10.1002/wics.101\n10.1109/TBME.2018.2807487\n10.1038/s41598-021-91144-z\n10.1587/transfun.E97.A.913"}

{"title": "The Combination of Low-Frequency Ultrasound and Antibiotics Improves the Killing of In Vitro ", "abstract": "Due to an increase in underlying predisposing factors, chronic wounds have become an increasing burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Chronic infections often contain biofilm-forming bacteria, which are challenging to eradicate due to increased antibiotic tolerance; thus, new and improved therapeutic strategies are warranted. One such strategy is the combination of ultrasound and antibiotics. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the combinatory effects of low-frequency (50 kHz) ultrasound delivered by specially designed ultrasound patches using flexible piezoelectric material, PiezoPaint\u2122, in combination with antibiotics against biofilms with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reduction in viable cells in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms was evaluated post-treatment with fusidic acid, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and colistin in combination with ultrasound treatment. Two-hour ultrasound treatment significantly increased the bactericidal effect of all four antibiotics, resulting in a 96\u221298% and 90\u221293% reduction in P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively. In addition, an additive effect was observed when extending treatment to 4 h, resulting in >99% and 95\u221297% reduction in P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively. These results contrasted the lack of effect observed when treating filter-biofilms with antibiotics alone. The combined effect of ultrasound and antibiotic treatment resulted in a synergistic effect, reducing the viability of the clinically relevant pathogens S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The modularity of the specially designed patches intended for topical treatment holds promising applications as a supplement in chronic wound therapy. Further studies are warranted with clinically isolated strains and other clinically relevant antibiotics before proceeding to studies where safety and applicability are investigated.", "journal": "Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-11-12", "authors": ["LasseKvich", "Mads HChristensen", "Malgorzata KPierchala", "KonstantinAstafiev", "RasmusLou-Moeller", "ThomasBjarnsholt"], "doi": "10.3390/antibiotics11111494\n10.1016/j.tim.2013.06.002\n10.1136/thoraxjnl-2021-217576\n10.1038/s41522-022-00306-y\n10.12968/jowc.2017.26.1.20\n10.1038/nrmicro.2016.94\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2009.12.011\n10.2337/dc06-1136\n10.12968/jowc.2010.19.5.48046\n10.1089/wound.2015.0635\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2011.02.001\n10.1093/jac/dkl402\n10.12968/jowc.2015.24.2.64\n10.1128/AAC.38.11.2577\n10.1021/bp0340685\n10.2323/jgam.52.295\n10.1126/science.1206157\n10.1002/adma.201905590\n10.2147/IDR.S260708\n10.1111/j.1742-481X.2006.00159.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04368.x\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.09.251\n10.1097/ICO.0000000000000184\n10.2147/IDR.S176390\n10.1067/mhn.2000.107888\n10.1089/wound.2014.0554\n10.1128/JCM.01395-09\n10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0\n10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00461.x\n10.1155/2020/5916260\n10.1002/jps.2600641005\n10.1046/j.1365-2133.1998.1390s3037.x\n10.1016/j.cmet.2019.06.009\n10.1038/s41579-022-00682-4\n10.1007/s10156-004-0319-1\n10.1111/1751-7915.13471\n10.1016/j.bioflm.2022.100069\n10.1111/iwj.12623\n10.12968/jowc.2009.18.4.41607\n10.1186/s13643-016-0400-8\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2018.05.011\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2836311"}
{"title": "Hybrid ultrasound-activated nanoparticles based on graphene quantum dots for cancer treatment.", "abstract": "Theranostic liposomes have recently found a broad range of applications in nanomedicine due to stability, the high solubility of biomacromolecules, bioavailability, efficacy, and low adverse effects. However, the limitations of liposomes concerning the short systemic circulation in the body, limited controllability of the release rate, and the inability of in vivo imaging remain challenging. Herein, the development of novel hybrid ultrasound-activated piezoelectric nanoparticles based on a hybrid liposome nanocarrier composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene), graphene quantum dots (GQDs), and Silibinin (a hydrophobic drug) is presented. The hybrid nanoparticles are an acoustically sensitive drug delivery platform that releases the biomacromolecules in a specific tissue area (through surface labeling with PD-1 antibody) in a non-invasive and controlled manner. We show that the developed hybrid nanoparticles (with an average outer diameter of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0230\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0nm) enable piezoelectric-stimulated drug delivery combined with simultaneous fluorescent imaging of cancer cells in vivo. Significant enhancement (>80\u00a0% up to 240\u00a0h) and tunable drug release from the nanocarrier through enhanced diffusion from the liposome membrane are demonstrated. Cytotoxicity assays using MCF-7, 4T1, and NIH3T3 cell lines exhibit no confrontational influence of nanoparticles on cell viability up to 125\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. The PD-1 antibody on the surface of the hybrid nanocarrier allows for selective delivery to breast cancer tumors and low biodistribution to other tissues. Our results affirm that the developed ultrasound-activated piezoelectric nanoparticles have great potential as multifunctional platforms with sustainable release profiles for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs to breast cancer, especially when the ability for adequate labeling and cell monitoring is valued.", "journal": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "date": "2022-11-11", "authors": ["ArashRamedani", "OmidSabzevari", "AbdolrezaSimchi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2022.122373"}

{"title": "Robotic multi-probe single-actuator inchworm neural microdrive.", "abstract": "A wide range of techniques in neuroscience involve placing individual probes at precise locations in the brain. However, large-scale measurement and manipulation of the brain using such methods have been severely limited by the inability to miniaturize systems for probe positioning. Here, we present a fundamentally new, remote-controlled micropositioning approach composed of novel phase-change material-filled resistive heater micro-grippers arranged in an inchworm motor configuration. The microscopic dimensions, stability, gentle gripping action, individual electronic control, and high packing density of the grippers allow micrometer-precision independent positioning of many arbitrarily shaped probes using a single piezo actuator.

{"title": "Polyvinylidene Fluoride Aerogels with Tailorable Crystalline Phase Composition.", "abstract": "In this work, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) aerogels with a tailorable phase composition were prepared by following the crystallization-induced gelation principle. A series of PVDF wet gels (5 to 12 wt.%) were prepared from either PVDF\u2212DMF solutions or a mixture of DMF and ethanol as non-solvent. The effects of the non-solvent concentration on the crystalline composition of the PVDF aerogels were thoroughly investigated. It was found that the nucleating role of ethanol can be adjusted to produce low-density PVDF aerogels, whereas the changes in composition by the addition of small amounts of water to the solution promote the stabilization of the valuable \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases. These phases of the aerogels were monitored by FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. Furthermore, the crystallization process was followed by in-time and in situ ATR\u2212FTIR spectroscopy. The obtained aerogels displayed specific surface areas > 150 m2 g\u22121, with variable particle morphologies that are dependent on the non-solvent composition, as observed by using SEM and Synchrotron Radiation Computed micro-Tomography (SR-\u03bcCT).", "journal": "Gels (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-11-11", "authors": ["JorgeTorres-Rodriguez", "DianaE Bedolla", "FrancescoD'Amico", "Ann-KathrinKoopmann", "LisaVaccari", "GiuliaSaccomano", "RichardKohns", "NicolaHuesing"], "doi": "10.3390/gels8110727\n10.1023/A:1004689205706\n10.1021/acsami.8b20759\n10.1002/adfm.201602624\n10.1088/2631-6331/ab0f48\n10.1039/C6TA09590A\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2017.04.004\n10.1002/polb.20223\n10.1063/1.2352799\n10.1016/0032-3861(92)90082-8\n10.1126/science.220.4602.1115\n10.1016/j.polymer.2017.07.004\n10.3390/polym13070998\n10.1016/S0014-3057(98)00136-0\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2012.04.002\n10.1016/S0032-3861(01)00064-7\n10.1002/mame.202000129\n10.1039/C9CE01051C\n10.1080/00222340801954811\n10.1007/s10853-019-04279-w\n10.1007/s10965-014-0434-3\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2018.02.017\n10.1016/j.polymer.2021.123564\n10.1007/s10853-011-6221-1\n10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2011.06.036\n10.1016/j.clay.2019.105171\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105895\n10.1021/am800101a\n10.1080/1539445X.2011.552702\n10.1016/j.supflu.2011.07.022\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b02035\n10.1002/adfm.201702926\n10.1016/j.cej.2016.09.038\n10.1007/s12274-020-3263-1\n10.1038/s41598-019-52230-5\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105519\n10.1016/j.matlet.2019.126890\n10.1021/acsami.6b14784\n10.1016/S0032-3861(98)00462-5\n10.1515/pac-2014-1117\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1021/ma00154a040\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.42.518\n10.1007/s42452-020-2512-y\n10.1002/polb.1988.090260405\n10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00875\n10.1002/polb.21924\n10.1021/jp3043494\n10.1021/ie101928r\n10.1039/c3ta14262k\n10.1039/C8EE03006E\n10.1080/00150193.2017.1362243\n10.1039/C7RA00586E\n10.1002/jps.23321\n10.1021/ma60044a013\n10.1021/ma50007a028\n10.1080/01411598908206864\n10.1016/j.vibspec.2017.12.003\n10.1038/s41586-018-0550-z\n10.1021/ja01269a023\n10.1186/s40679-016-0036-8\n10.1046/j.1365-2818.2002.01010.x\n10.1016/j.nima.2012.11.037\n10.1002/polb.1994.090320509"}

Recent advances of wearable and implantable biomedical devices bring promise as well as requirements for the piezoelectric materials building blocks. Owing to their biocompatibility, biosafety, and environmental sustainability, natural piezoelectric biomaterials are known as a promising candidate in this emerging field, with a potential to replace conventional piezoelectric ceramics and synthetic polymers. Herein, we provide a thorough review of recent progresses of research on five major types of piezoelectric biomaterials including amino acids, peptides, proteins, viruses, and polysaccharides. Our discussion focuses on their structure- and phase-related piezoelectric properties and fabrication strategies to achieve desired piezoelectric phases. We compare and analyze their piezoelectric performance and further introduce and comment on the approaches to improve their piezoelectric property. Representative biomedical applications of this group of functional biomaterials including energy harvesting, sensing, and tissue engineering are also discussed.

{"title": "Improved performance of stretchable piezoelectric energy harvester based on stress rearrangement.", "abstract": "With the development of wearable devices and soft electronics, the demand for stretchable piezoelectric energy harvesters (SPEHs) has increased. Energy harvesting can provide energy when large batteries or power sources cannot be employed, and stretchability provides a user-friendly experience. However, the performance of SPEHs remains low, which limits their application. In this study, a wearable SPEH is developed by adopting a kirigami structure on a polyvinylidene fluoride film. The performance of the SPEH is improved by rearranging the stress distribution throughout the film. This is conducted using two approaches: topological depolarization, which eliminates the opposite charge generation by thermal treatment, and optimization of the neutral axis, which maximizes the stress applied at the surface of the piezoelectric film. The SPEH performance is experimentally measured and compared with that of existing SPEHs. Using these two approaches, the stress was rearranged in both the x-y plane and z-direction, and the output voltage increased by 21.57% compared with that of the original film with the same stretching motion. The generated energy harvester was successfully applied to smart transmittance-changing contact lenses.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-11-10", "authors": ["Young-GyunKim", "SeongheonHong", "BosunHwang", "Sung-HoonAhn", "Ji-HyeonSong"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-23005-2\n10.1002/adma.202004832\n10.1021/acsaelm.1c00165\n10.1002/adma.201400633\n10.1002/adma.201602251\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112569\n10.1038/s41586-022-04476-9\n10.1002/aenm.201701520\n10.1126/sciadv.abf0795\n10.1002/adfm.202104737\n10.1002/admt.201700249\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.003\n10.1021/acsami.9b12187\n10.1039/D2MH00442A\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.10.010\n10.1126/sciadv.1500661\n10.1002/adfm.201500856\n10.1021/acsaem.9b01061\n10.1039/C7NR05222G\n10.1002/aenm.201301624\n10.1002/adma.201902254\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104676\n10.1002/admt.201900100\n10.1038/srep24758\n10.1063/1.5001094\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.084301\n10.1038/nmat4327\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114615\n10.1039/C7TC01727H\n10.1039/c3nr06007a\n10.1002/ente.201402148\n10.1002/admt.201800335\n10.1038/s41928-018-0189-7\n10.1021/nl104412b\n10.1063/1.4927677\n10.1002/adma.201604989\n10.1038/s41467-019-13637-w\n10.3390/polym9120714\n10.3390/mi8040115\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.02.034\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/4/045008\n10.1038/s41528-018-0022-4\n10.1021/am508812a\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/7/075002\n10.1039/c3ee41063c\n10.1063/1.5025025\n10.1038/s41528-022-00186-4\n10.1021/acsami.8b22613\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.9.021002\n10.1007/s40684-019-00127-z\n10.1039/C8TA10964H\n10.1016/S0924-0136(98)00079-X\n10.1063/1.336332"}
{"title": "Longitudinal modes of a surface bonded piezoelectric wafer active transducer (PWaT) and their influences on PWaT resonances.", "abstract": "This work investigates the longitudinal modes of surface-bonded piezoelectric wafer active transducers (PWaTs) and how they influence the PWaT resonances. Unlike conventional one-dimensional bar structures that essentially have only one non-dispersive longitudinal mode, the bonded PWaT has two dispersive longitudinal modes, with one evanescent (non-propagating) wave mode below a cut-off frequency. Their propagation characteristics, such as wave numbers, attenuations, and mode conversion at the PWaT edges, clarify two research questions raised from the time-frequency analysis of the PWaT electromechanical impedance (EMI) signature and the associated broadband pitch-catch signal. The study also revealed that the PWaT resonances stem from the Fabry-Perot interference of the waves reflected at the two edges of the PWaT, providing a sound theoretical foundation that further explains the influence of the adhesive on the PWaT resonances. These theoretical discoveries will lead to physics-based interpretation of EMI and ultrasonic pitch-catch signals generated by surface bonded PWaTs, which could lead to new sensing mechanisms in future.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-11-10", "authors": ["HaiyingHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106877"}

Here, a simple method is reported to fabricate polar PVDF nanotubes using anodize aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes as templates that are removed by etching in a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution and then ageing at room temperature. PVDF nanotubes originally crystallized in the AAO membrane are pure \u03b1-crystals with very low crystallinity, yet after being released from the templates, the crystallinity of the nanotubes markedly increases with ageing at room temperature, leading to the formation of \u03b2-PVDF crystals in a very short time, with the formation of \u03b3 crystals after longer ageing times. A large amount of \u03b3 crystals formed when the released PVDF nanotubes are heated to \u2248130\u00a0\u00b0C.

{"title": "Ultrasonically actuated neural probes for reduced trauma and inflammation in mouse brain.", "abstract": "Electrical neural recordings measured using direct electrical interfaces with neural tissue suffer from a short lifespan because the signal strength decreases over time. The inflammatory response to the inserted microprobe can create insulating tissue over the electrical interfaces, reducing the recorded signal below noise levels. One of the factors contributing to this inflammatory response is the tissue damage caused during probe insertion. Here, we explore the use of ultrasonic actuation of the neural probe during insertion to minimize tissue damage in mice. Silicon neural microprobes were designed and fabricated with integrated electrical recording sites and piezoelectric transducers. The microprobes were actuated at ultrasonic frequencies using integrated piezoelectric transducers. The microprobes were inserted into mouse brains under a glass window over the brain surface to image the tissue surrounding the probe using two-photon microscopy. The mechanical force required to penetrate the tissue was reduced by a factor of 2-3 when the microprobe was driven at ultrasonic frequencies. Tissue histology at the probe insertion site showed a reduced area of damage and decreased microglia counts with increasing ultrasonic actuation of the probes. Two-photon imaging of the microprobe over weeks demonstrated stabilization of the inflammatory response. Recording of electrical signals from neurons over time suggests that microprobes inserted using ultrasound have a higher signal-to-noise ratio over an extended time period.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2022-11-08", "authors": ["Po-ChengChen", "Catharine GYoung", "Chris BSchaffer", "AmitLal"], "doi": "10.1038/s41378-022-00438-3\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4088-04.2005\n10.1016/S0006-8993(03)03023-3\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.04.013\n10.1016/B978-0-12-008302-2.50012-2\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.08.015\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3696-05.2006\n10.1038/nn1472\n10.3390/electronics2010001\n10.1088/1741-2560/9/5/056015\n10.1109/TBME.2004.827465\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00424-1\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199805)40:2<264::AID-JBM11>3.0.CO;2-M\n10.1088/1741-2560/8/1/014001\n10.1109/TNSRE.2007.909811\n10.1088/1741-2560/3/1/007\n10.1016/j.bios.2006.08.035\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.07.027\n10.1109/10.55638\n10.1109/TBME.2006.872824\n10.1088/1741-2560/3/3/002\n10.1109/10.141202\n10.1109/TBME.2008.2003261\n10.1073/pnas.1934665100\n10.1002/jbm.820271106\n10.1109/10.83588\n10.1016/S0165-0270(00)00159-X\n10.1006/exnr.1998.6983\n10.1007/BF00608344\n10.1109/58.656639\n10.1121/1.3613939\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026612\n10.1016/0041-624X(76)90022-6\n10.1121/1.1910444\n10.1109/TBME.2009.2026910\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/5/054011\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00420-8\n10.1128/MCB.20.11.4106-4114.2000"}
{"title": "Development and evaluation of different electroactive poly(vinylidene fluoride) architectures for endothelial cell culture.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering (TE) aims to develop structures that improve or even replace the biological functions of tissues and organs. Mechanical properties, physical-chemical characteristics, biocompatibility, and biological performance of the materials are essential factors for their applicability in TE. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is a thermoplastic polymer that exhibits good mechanical properties, high biocompatibility and excellent thermal properties. However, PVDF structuring, and the corresponding processing methods used for its preparation are known to significantly influence these characteristics. In this study, doctor blade, salt-leaching, and electrospinning processing methods were used to produce PVDF-based structures in the form of films, porous membranes, and fiber scaffolds, respectively. These PVDF scaffolds were subjected to a variety of characterizations and analyses, including physicochemical analysis, contact angle measurement, cytotoxicity assessment and cell proliferation. All prepared PVDF scaffolds are characterized by a mechanical response typical of ductile materials. PVDF films displayed mostly vibration modes for the a-phase, while the remaining PVDF samples were characterized by a higher content of electroactive \u03b2-phase due the low temperature solvent evaporation during processing. No significant variations have been observed between the different PVDF membranes with respect to the melting transition. In addition, all analysed PVDF samples present a hydrophobic behavior. On the other hand, cytotoxicity assays confirm that cell viability is maintained independently of the architecture and processing method. Finally, all the PVDF samples promote human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, being higher on the PVDF film and electrospun randomly-oriented membranes. These findings demonstrated the importance of PVDF topography on HUVEC behavior, which can be used for the design of vascular implants.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2022-11-08", "authors": ["DavidDur\u00e1n-Rey", "RicardoBrito-Pereira", "ClarisseRibeiro", "SylvieRibeiro", "Juan AS\u00e1nchez-Margallo", "Ver\u00f3nicaCris\u00f3stomo", "IgorIrastorza", "UnaiSilv\u00e1n", "SenentxuLanceros-M\u00e9ndez", "Francisco MS\u00e1nchez-Margallo"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2022.1044667\n10.1021/bm401825c\n10.1089/ten.TEB.2012.0183\n10.1002/app.12267\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.12.009\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2010.01.004\n10.1016/S0142-9612(96)00114-7\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.12.046\n10.1016/j.apmt.2022.101507\n10.1021/acsami.1c00227\n10.3390/nano9010039\n10.1080/1539445X.2015.1083444\n10.1039/c6ra26931a\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.771400\n10.1021/acsami.9b14001\n10.1016/j.matpr.2018.04.182\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.09.007\n10.1007/s10439-011-0365-7\n10.1002/bit.25918\n10.1002/term.1978\n10.1039/c8nr10384d\n10.3390/jcm8101602\n10.3390/nano9070952\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.11.065\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104669\n10.1002/jbm.a.36050\n10.1002/jbm.a.36050\n10.1016/j.jiec.2016.12.016\n10.1586/17434440.4.1.65\n10.1073/pnas.1704543115\n10.1038/nprot.2017.157\n10.1080/1539445X.2010.495630\n10.1016/j.msec.2018.07.044\n10.3390/nano8110933\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.05.004\n10.3389/fphar.2019.01568\n10.3390/polym11010034\n10.1002/jbm.a.32276\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.09.020\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310738\n10.1088/1748-605X/ab673c"}

{"title": "Ion rectification based on gel polymer electrolyte ionic diode.", "abstract": "Biological ion channels rely on ions as charge carriers and unidirectional ion flow to produce and transmit signals. To realize artificial biological inspired circuitry and seamless human-machine communication, ion-transport-based rectification devices should be developed. In this research, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are assembled to construct a novel ionic diode, enabling ion rectification through ion-diffusion/migration that emulates biological systems. This ion rectification results from the different diffusion/migration behaviors of mobile ions transporting in the GPE heterojunction. The electrical tests of the GPE heterojunction reveal outstanding rectifying ratio of 23.11.

Anatomical differences across OHC rows suggest differences in their motion. Using optical coherence tomography, we measured in vivo and postmortem displacements through the gerbil round-window membrane from approximately the 40-47\u00a0kHz best-frequency (BF)\u00a0regions. Our high spatial resolution allowed measurements across the RL surface at the tops of the three rows of individual OHCs and their bottoms, and across the BM. RL motion varied radially; the third-row gain was more than 3 times greater than that of the first row near BF, whereas the OHC-bottom motions remained similar. This implies that the RL mosaic, comprised of OHC and phalangeal-process tops joined together by adhesion molecules, is much more flexible than the Deiters'\u00a0cells connected to the OHCs at their bottom surfaces. Postmortem, the measured points moved together approximately in phase. These imply that in vivo, the RL does not move as a stiff plate hinging around the pillar-cell heads near the first row as has been assumed, but that its mosaic-like structure may instead bend and/or stretch.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-11-06", "authors": ["Nam HyunCho", "SunilPuria"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-23525-x\n10.1016/j.heares.2021.108389"}
{"title": "Sperm factors associated with the production of equine blastocysts by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using frozen/thawed semen.", "abstract": "Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) using frozen/thawed sperm is a common procedure to obtain embryos from fertile or subfertile mares and stallions. Stallion-associated factors that impact the efficiency of ICSI have been studied less than those associated with the mare. Three experiments were conducted: Experiment 1: the effect of freezing extender composition and cryoprotectant; Experiment 2: the effect of sperm exposure to seminal plasma prior to freezing (ejaculated vs. epididymal sperm; two-freeze/thaw cycles each); and Experiment 3: the effect of sperm morphologic feature used for fertilization (normal vs. cytoplasmic droplet vs. bent tail); on the blastocyst rate after ICSI. In Experiment 1, stallion sperm was cryopreserved using commercially available extenders containing: a) 2% egg-yolk\u00a0+\u00a0milk\u00a0+ 4% glycerol (MFR5); b) 2% egg-yolk\u00a0+\u00a0milk\u00a0+\u00a02% glycerol\u00a0+\u00a03% methyl formamide (CMMFR5); c) 20% egg-yolk\u00a0+\u00a04.75% glycerol (LE); or d) 20% egg-yolk\u00a0+\u00a02% glycerol\u00a0+\u00a03% methyl formamide (CMLE). Sperm from each of the treatment groups were used for Piezo-driven ICSI on in\u00a0vitro-matured equine oocytes (n\u00a0=\u00a0321). Extender CMLE resulted in a lower cleavage rate (35%) than the other treatment groups (MFR5: 74%, CMMFR5: 62%, LE: 68%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Extender MFR5 yielded a higher blastocyst rate per injected oocyte (21/82 [26%]) than the Groups LE (8/77 [10%]), CMLE (4/80 [5%]) or CMMFR5 (4/82 [5%]; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Extender MFR5 also yielded a higher blastocyst rate per cleaved oocyte (34%) than Groups LE, CMLE or CMMFR5 (15%, 14%, 8%; respectively P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In Experiment 2, ejaculated (EJ) and epididymal (EPD) sperm from a fertile stallion which was initially cryopreserved in the CMLE extender, was thawed and re-cryopreserved in MFR5 extender for use in ICSI. Sperm from both groups (EJ vs. EPD) were used for ICSI on in\u00a0vitro matured oocytes (n\u00a0=\u00a0127). Differences were not detected for cleavage rate (EJ: 36/63 [57%] vs. EPD: 49/64 [77%]), blastocyst rate per injected oocyte (EJ: 11/63 [17%] vs. EPD: 11/64 [17%]), or blastocyst rate per cleaved oocyte (EJ: 31% vs. EPD: 22%) between treatment groups (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In Experiment 3, morphologically normal sperm (N), or sperm with proximal droplets (PD) or bent tails (BT), were obtained from a single fertile stallion and were used for ICSI on in\u00a0vitro matured oocytes (n\u00a0=\u00a075). No differences were detected among treatment groups for cleavage rate (N: 19/25 [77%] vs. PD: 20/25 [88%] vs. BT: 18/25 [72%]), blastocyst rate per injected oocyte (N: 6/25 [24%] vs. PD: 5/25 [20%] vs. BT: 2/25 [8%]), and blastocyst rate per cleaved oocyte (N: 32% vs. PD: 23% vs. BT: 11%; P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In conclusion, the current study indicates that freezing extender composition used for stallion sperm cryopreservation has an impact on the developmental competence of in\u00a0vitro-matured equine oocytes after ICSI and in\u00a0vitro culture. Furthermore, we were unable to detect differences on cleavage and blastocyst rates when performing ICSI when using: 1) ejaculated or epididymal sperm; or 2) sperm with different morphologic features. The results from the current study provide additional insight regarding stallion-related factors that should be considered when performing ICSI in horses.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2022-11-05", "authors": ["LuisaRam\u00edrez-Ag\u00e1mez", "CamiloHern\u00e1ndez-Avil\u00e9s", "Dickson DVarner", "Charles CLove"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.10.014"}

{"title": "Miniature Ferroelectret Microphone Design and Performance Evaluation Using Laser Excitation.", "abstract": "Miniature microphones suitable for measurements of ultrasonic wave field scans in air are expensive or lack sensitivity or do not cover the range beyond 100 kHz. It is essential that they are too large for such fields measurements. The use of a ferroelectret (FE) film is proposed to construct a miniature, needle-style 0.5-mm-diameter sensitive element ultrasonic microphone. FE has an acoustic impedance much closer to that of air compared with other alternatives and is low cost and easy to process. The performance of the microphone was evaluated by measuring the sensitivity area map, directivity, ac response, and calibrating the absolute sensitivity. Another novel contribution here is that the sensitivity map was obtained by scanning the focused beam of a laser diode over the microphone surface, producing thermoelastic ultrasound excitation. The electroacoustic response of the microphone served as a sensitivity indicator at a scan spot. Micrometer scale granularity of the FE sensitivity was revealed in the sensitivity map images. It was also demonstrated that the relative ac response of the microphone can be obtained using pulsed laser beam thermoelastic excitation of the whole microphone surface with a laser diode. The absolute sensitivity calibration was done using the hybrid three-transducer reciprocity technique. A large aperture, air coupled transducer beam was focused onto the microphone surface, using the parabolic off-axis mirror. This measurement validated the laser ac response measurements. The FE microphone performance was compared with biaxially stretched polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) microphone of the same construction.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-11-05", "authors": ["LinasSvilainis", "AndriusChaziachmetovas", "ValdasEidukynas", "Tomas GomezAlvarez-Arenas", "SteveDixon"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3220082"}
{"title": "Ionic dielectrics for fully printed carbon nanotube transistors: impact of composition and induced stresses.", "abstract": "Printed carbon nanotube thin-film transistors (CNT-TFTs) are candidates for flexible electronics with printability on a wide range of substrates. Among the layers comprising a CNT-TFT, the gate dielectric has proven most difficult to additively print owing to challenges in film uniformity, thickness, and post-processing requirements. Printed ionic dielectrics show promise for addressing these issues and yielding devices that operate at low voltages thanks to their high-capacitance electric double layers. However, the printing of ionic dielectrics in their various compositions is not well understood, nor is the impact of certain stresses on these materials. In this work, we studied three compositionally distinct ionic dielectrics in fully printed CNT-TFTs: the polar-fluorinated polymer elastomer PVDF-HFP; an ion gel consisting of triblock polymer PS-PMMA-PS and ionic liquid EMIM-TFSI; and crystalline nanocellulose (CNC) with a salt concentration of 0.05%. Although ion gel has been thoroughly studied, e-PVDF-HFP and CNC printing are relatively new and this study provides insights into their ink formulation, print processing, and performance as gate dielectrics. Using a consistent aerosol jet printing approach, each ionic dielectric was printed into similar CNT-TFTs, allowing for direct comparison through extensive characterization, including mechanical and electrical stress tests. The ionic dielectrics were found to have distinct operational dependencies based on their compositional and ionic attributes. Overall, the results reveal a number of trade-offs that must be managed when selecting a printable ionic dielectric, with CNC showing the strongest performance for low-voltage operation but the ion gel and elastomer exhibiting better stability under bias and mechanical stresses.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2022-11-05", "authors": ["Brittany NSmith", "HopeMeikle", "James LDoherty", "ShihengLu", "GiannaTutoni", "Matthew LBecker", "Michael JTherien", "Aaron DFranklin"], "doi": "10.1039/d2nr04206a\n10.1080/15980316.2021.1957032"}

Biosensors offer several advantages as diagnostic tool due to their independence on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, simplicity, low-cost, high sensitivity and specificity. Likewise, the increasing interest on aptamers as biorecognition elements in biosensor application lies in their ease of synthesis and modification, chemical and thermal stability, low-cost, and high sensitivity and specificity towards their targets.

The excitation of single or coupled vibration modes of piezoelectric devices is mainly related to the structure and property of piezoelectric materials. However, for the generally used piezoelectric materials, e.g., lead zirconate titanate ceramics, most of piezoelectric coefficients in the piezoelectric matrix are equal to zero, resulting in many piezoelectric vibration modes cannot be excited, which hinders the design of piezoelectric devices. In this work, an orderly stacked structure with piezoelectric strain units is proposed to achieve all nonzero piezoelectric coefficients, and consequently generate artificially coupled multi-vibration modes with ultrahigh strains.

{"title": "Soft, Multifunctional, Robust Film Sensor Using a Ferroelectret with Significant Longitudinal and Transverse Piezoelectric Activity for Biomechanical Monitoring.", "abstract": "Soft and intelligent bioelectronics have achieved unprecedented development in both academics and industries over the last few decades, especially as ideal body-worn detectors for continuous human health status monitoring. However, the longstanding functional stability of bioelectronics in multiple environmental conditions of variant temperatures, humidities, and mechanical stimuli or even in some extremes, such as ultraviolet radiation and X-ray radiation, has confined the application of these electronics. Herein, a self-sustainable, multifunctional, robust sensor for biomechanical monitoring is prepared by hybridizing a parallel-tunnel fluorinated poly(ethylene propylene) (FEP) ferroelectret film (sensing layer) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS, protection layer). A fast response (80 ms) and a low pressure detection limit (10 Pa) were achieved. Notably, the self-powered sensor can not only sensitively detect the loading of solid objects but also percept liquid water droplets and airflow, which satisfies the diverse needs of wearable devices. Meanwhile, the capability of stable and repeatable operation under a wide temperature range (-26-70 \u00b0C), extreme moisture, continuous mechanical stimulus (\u223c1.08 million cycles), and long-time ultraviolet radiation enabled the extensive and long-term application of such sensors in multiple scenarios. Moreover, the reproducibility of sensing performance after X-ray radiation can be realized through second contact polarization even after encapsulation. Due to the inherent mechanical flexibility, the fabricated sensor was conformally attached to rough and deformed skin and verified the feasibility of wearable biomechanical sensing with high sensitivity from facial smiling to plantar movement. This work provides an efficient strategy for multifunctional sensing, holding great promise for advanced soft bioelectronics in the next generation of wearable intelligent electronic systems.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-11-03", "authors": ["XingchenMa", "ChaoSong", "FeiZhang", "YingDai", "PengfeiHe", "XiaoqingZhang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c14378"}

{"title": "Raman mapping of piezoelectric poly(l-lactic acid) films for force sensors.", "abstract": "Poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) is a synthetic, biocompatible, biodegradable polymer with good piezoelectric properties. The prepared PLLA films were annealed in the oven at 140 \u00b0C for 0 h, 3 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively. The influences of temperature treatment time on the optoelectronic properties of the PLLA films and piezoelectric sensors based on them were investigated. The morphology and crystal structure of the PLLA films obtained under various post-processing conditions were examined by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The micromechanical equipment for tension-compression measurements was built in the laboratory for the tested piezoelectric sensors. The analysis of the structure shows that the increase in the crystallite size of the PLLA film influences the growth of the piezoelectric signal of the sensors based on them. The vibrational analysis of the PLLA films confirmed their crystal structure. The improvement in the structure and the stretching of the dipole C[double bond, length as m-dash]O for the film obtained after 3 h treatment increased the piezoelectric properties of the PLLA films. The analysis of Raman mapping added information that the area of the ordered phase of the PLLA films depends on the time of temperature treatment. The maximum value of the piezoelectric signal was 0.98 mV for sensors prepared on films annealed for 3 h at a load of 20 N. For films without temperature annealing at the same load, the maximum value was 0.45 mV.

{"title": "A novel two-degrees of freedom (2-DOF) piezo-driven positioning platform with the working stroke being over 20 cm.", "abstract": "Multi-degrees of freedom piezo-driven precision positioning platforms with large working strokes are demanded in many research fields. Although many multi-degrees of freedom piezo-driven positioning platforms have been proposed, few of them can achieve both large working stroke and high speed, which hinders their applications. In this study, a two-degrees of freedom piezo-driven positioning platform was proposed by stacking two identical stick-slip piezoelectric actuators. To simplify the practical implementation of a large working stroke, the actuator employed a special structure, in which the compliant mechanism and the slider were connected together as a mover and the guide rail was fixed as a stator. The working stroke of the actuator can be increased easily by increasing only the length of the guide rail without changing the output performances. By designing a lever-type compliant mechanism (LCM) on the side surface of the slider, a large loading space was obtained. Theoretical calculation and finite element analysis of the LCM were performed in detail. As the structures of these two stick-slip piezoelectric actuators are the same, only the output performances of the upper actuator (x direction) were tested as an example. Experimental results indicated that the upper actuator had a stable bi-direction motion with a working stroke being over 20\u00a0cm. The maximum speeds along the positive x and negative x directions reached 17.864 and 18.73 mm/s, and the resolutions were 100 and 230\u00a0nm, respectively.

However, in conventional stress measurements, the spatial electromagnetic interference (EMI) produced by the discharge can affect the measurement accuracy or even damage the experimental instruments. In this study, a novel system for measuring stress in a strong electromagnetic field, based on a piezoelectric film and a conditioning circuit, was debugged and evaluated. Shielding was used to eliminate the intense EMI due to the strong electromagnetic field.

{"title": "Overturning the mechanisms of cochlear amplification via area deformations of the organ of Corti.", "abstract": "The mammalian ear embeds a cellular amplifier that boosts sound-induced hydromechanical waves as they propagate along the cochlea. The operation of this amplifier is not fully understood and is difficult to disentangle experimentally. In the prevailing view, cochlear waves are amplified by the piezo-electric action of the outer hair cells (OHCs), whose cycle-by-cycle elongations and contractions inject power into the local motion of the basilar membrane (BM). Concomitant deformations of the opposing (or \"top\") side of the organ of Corti are assumed to play a minor role and are generally neglected. However, analysis of intracochlear motions obtained using optical coherence tomography calls this prevailing view into question. In particular, the analysis suggests that (i) the net local power transfer from the OHCs to the BM is either negative or highly inefficient; and (ii) vibration of the top side of the organ of Corti plays a primary role in traveling-wave amplification. A phenomenological model derived from these observations manifests realistic cochlear responses and suggests that amplification arises almost entirely from OHC-induced deformations of the top side of the organ of Corti.

While the top set of electrodes is connected to RF transmit and receive channels for conventional diverging wave imaging (DWI), the orthogonal bottom set of electrodes is connected to independently controlled variable dc bias channels. By implementing modulated bias patterns compounded across multiple pulses, fine delay control across the bottom elements can be achieved simultaneously with imaging with the top set of electrodes.

This geometry is especially convenient for the implementation of multifrequency AO diffraction, which has found wide application for solving the problems related to the laser pulse shaping. Since acoustic beams propagate over long distances in quasicollinear AO devices, and optical radiation spectral components diffract in the acoustic field in different parts of the AO crystal, accurate calculation of the characteristics of such devices requires knowing the distribution of the acoustic field amplitude inside the AO cell. The acoustic beam structure is affected by several factors in quasicollinear AO cells: the dimensions of the piezoelectric transducer, the geometry of acoustic wave propagation in the AO cell, acoustic anisotropy and the acoustic energy absorption along the chosen direction in the crystalline material used. In this paper, we propose a generic method to measure the acoustic beam power distribution along the direction of its propagation in the quasicollinear AO cell in the presence of ultrasound power absorption and media acoustic absorption. The measurements were carried out for the ultrasound frequency range from 72 to 176 MHz, for the case when the wave vector of the acoustic beam is directed at an angle of 1.58", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-10-29", "authors": ["Sergey NMantsevich", "Ekaterina IKostyleva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106875"}

Synthetic motion, that is, using an actuator such as a nanopositioning stage to drive a particle along a known ground-truth trajectory, is a means for achieving these ends. However, the resolution, accuracy, and flexibility of this method is limited by the actuator static and dynamic characteristics. In this work we apply system identification and model inverse feedforward control to increase actuator bandwidth and address some common actuator nonlinearities, develop a set of dimensionless numbers that describe system limitations, and provide a set of guidelines for the practical use of synthetic motion in SPT.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on control systems technology : a publication of the IEEE Control Systems Society", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["Nicholas AVickers", "Sean BAndersson"], "doi": "10.1109/tcst.2022.3149597"}
{"title": "Validation of PiezoSleep Scoring Against EEG/EMG Sleep Scoring in Rats.", "abstract": "Current methods of sleep research in rodents involve invasive surgical procedures of EEG and EMG electrodes implantation. Recently, a new method of measuring sleep, PiezoSleep, has been validated against implanted electrodes in mice and rats. PiezoSleep uses a piezoelectric film transducer to detect the rodent's movements and respiration and employs an algorithm to automatically score sleep. Here, we validate PiezoSleep scoring versus EEG/EMG implanted electrodes sleep scoring in rats.\nAdult male Brown Norway and Wistar Kyoto rats were implanted with bilateral stainless-steel screws into the skull for EEG recording and bilateral wire electrodes into the nuchal muscles for EMG assessment. In Brown Norway rats, the EEG/EMG electrode leads were soldered to a miniature connector plug and fixed to the skull. In Wistar Kyoto rats, the EEG/EMG leads were tunneled subcutaneously to a telemetry transmitter implanted in the flank. Rats were allowed to recover from surgery for one week. Brown Norway rats were placed in PiezoSleep cages, and had their headsets connected to cable for recording EEG/EMG signals, which were then manually scored by a human scorer in 10-sec epochs. Wistar Kyoto rats were placed in PiezoSleep cages, and EEG/EMG signals were recorded using a telemetry system (DSI). Sleep was scored automatically in 4-sec epochs using NeuroScore software. PiezoSleep software recorded and scored sleep in the rats.\nRats implanted with corded EEG/EMG headsets had 85.6% concurrence of sleep-wake scoring with PiezoSleep. Rats implanted with EEG/EMG telemetry had 80.8% concurrence sleep-wake scoring with PiezoSleep. Sensitivity and specificity rates were similar between the EEG/EMG recording systems. Total sleep time and hourly sleep times did not differ in all three systems. However, automatic sleep detection by NeuroScore classified more sleep during the light period compared to the PiezoSleep.\nWe showed that PiezoSleep system can be a reliable alternative to both automatic and visual EEG/EMG- based sleep-wake scoring in rat.", "journal": "Nature and science of sleep", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["IrinaTopchiy", "Anne MFink", "Katherine AMaki", "Michael WCalik"], "doi": "10.2147/NSS.S381367\n10.1185/030079907X253771\n10.12871/000398292015231\n10.1093/ilar.50.3.248\n10.1101/226522\n10.1186/1475-925X-7-14\n10.1109/TBME.2006.886938\n10.5665/sleep.3936\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.11.004\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.08.004\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.05.011\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.01.035\n10.1016/j.bbi.2015.01.001\n10.5665/sleep.3582\n10.3109/02699052.2014.888768\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082507\n10.1093/sleep/zsy116\n10.1371/journal.pone.0140678\n10.1111/gbb.12570\n10.1177/0748730418803802\n10.2147/NSS.S214423\n10.1101/gr.233866.117\n10.1111/jsr.13373\n10.1016/j.resp.2021.103653\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00039.2020\n10.5665/sleep.4184\n10.1093/sleep/zsx112\n10.1186/s13040-021-00244-z\n10.1186/s12864-019-6413-7\n10.1109/10.966600\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.02.016\n10.3389/fnsys.2020.00006\n10.1080/10253890.2021.1879788\n10.1038/ijo.2010.93"}

In this context, the resulting interference pattern can reveal the acoustic wavelength in the liquid medium with remarkable accuracy, providing thus reliable estimations of the speed of sound in reference liquids (error \u223c0.1%) such as distilled and sea water, acetonitrile, and ethanol.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["George JTserevelakis", "GiannisZacharakis"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.455557"}
{"title": "Enhancement of Ultrasonic Transducer Bandwidth by Acoustic Impedance Gradient Matching Layer.", "abstract": "High-performance broadband ultrasound transducers provide superior imaging quality in biomedical ultrasound imaging. However, a matching design that perfectly transmits the acoustic energy between the active piezoelectric element and the target medium over the operating spectrum is still lacking. In this work, an anisotropic gradient acoustic impedance composite material as the matching layer of an ultrasonic transducer was designed and fabricated; it is a non-uniform material with the continuous decline of acoustic impedance along the direction of ultrasonic propagation in a sub-wavelength range. This material provides a broadband window for ultrasonic propagation in a wide frequency range and achieves almost perfect sound energy transfer efficiency from the piezoelectric material to the target medium. Nano tungsten particles and epoxy resin were selected as filling and basic materials, respectively. Along the direction of ultrasonic propagation, the proportion of tungsten powder was carefully controlled to decrease gradually, following the natural exponential form in a very narrow thickness range. Using this new material as a matching layer with high-performance single crystals, the -6 dB bandwidth of the PMN-PT ultrasonic transducer could reach over 170%, and the insertion loss was only -20.3 dB. The transducer achieved a temporal signal close to a single wavelength, thus there is the potential to dramatically improve the resolution and imaging quality of the biomedical ultrasound imaging system.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["KeZhu", "JinpengMa", "XudongQi", "BingzhongShen", "YangLiu", "EnweiSun", "RuiZhang"], "doi": "10.3390/s22208025\n10.1038/nature16066\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2015.03.016\n10.3949/ccjm.72.6.487\n10.1038/nmeth.1641\n10.1088/0031-9155/58/18/6447\n10.1038/ncomms6023\n10.1109/51.544509\n10.1007/PL00014060\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.04.004\n10.1109/T-SU.1966.29370\n10.1109/T-SU.1975.30776\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.08.015\n10.1063/1.3065476\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1320834\n10.1109/ultsym.1993.339558\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2014.06.001\n10.1109/ultsym.1999.849150\n10.1080/00150193.2010.485546\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1825\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.06.017\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.08.017\n10.3390/s131013543\n10.1038/srep42863\n10.1063/1.4792661\n10.1007/s10853-011-5816-x\n10.1088/0256-307X/29/2/024302\n10.1109/58.852060\n10.1016/j.ultras.2010.04.001\n10.1063/1.2903456\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2020.107789\n10.3390/mi13101715\n10.1093/imamat/hxn030\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.12.020"}

However, the diameters of large-end and small-end micro-tapered holes in industrial applications deviate from the design values by 15.25% and 15.83%, respectively, which adversely impacts the effect of atomizers. In this study, two main factors that influence the machining quality of tapered holes, the external vibration disturbance and the internal system errors inside the laser processor, were explored; consequently, the vibration model of the machining device and the laser drilling model were established, respectively. Based on the models and the experimental results, it was found that the errors in diameter caused by these two factors accounted for 20% and 67.87% of the total deviation, respectively. Finally, an improved method was proposed, where a damping system was added to the machining device, and the diameter of the initial laser spot was corrected. The measurement results of tapered holes machined by the improved method showed that the deviation of the large diameters and the small diameters from the design values declined to 4.85% and 4.83%, respectively.

{"title": "The Frontiers of Functionalized Nanocellulose-Based Composites and Their Application as Chemical Sensors.", "abstract": "Chemical sensors are a rapidly developing technology that has received much attention in diverse industries such as military, medicine, environmental surveillance, automotive power and mobility, food manufacturing, infrastructure construction, product packaging and many more. The mass production of low-cost devices and components for use as chemical sensors is a major driving force for improvements in each of these industries. Recently, studies have found that using renewable and eco-friendly materials would be advantageous for both manufacturers and consumers. Thus, nanotechnology has led to the investigation of nanocellulose, an emerging and desirable bio-material for use as a chemical sensor. The inherent properties of nanocellulose, its high tensile strength, large specific surface area and good porous structure have many advantages in its use as a composite material for chemical sensors, intended to decrease response time by minimizing barriers to mass transport between an analyte and the immobilized indicator in the sensor.

{"title": "Combined Triboelectric and Piezoelectric Effect in ZnO/PVDF Hybrid-Based Fiber-Structured Nanogenerator with PDMS:Carbon Black Electrodes.", "abstract": "We report a fiber-structured hybrid nanogenerator wearable device fabricated on a single polyethylene terephthalate (PET) textile cylindrical substrate. The device can be described as a capacitor with inner and outer carbon-black-dispersed poly dimethyl siloxane (PDMS:Carbon black) electrodes, and zinc oxide and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the dielectric medium between the electrodes. The compositional analysis in terms of X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy of the synthesized ZnO/PVDF has been measured and analyzed. The combined effect of triboelectricity between PDMS:Carbon black and PVDF, and piezoelectricity in a ZnO/PVDF hybrid, was investigated. Current-voltage characteristics were observed with varying load from 0-20 g, and resistance was observed to be decreased with load. Compared to earlier reports, there was a significant enhancement in voltage (\u22485.1 V) and current (\u224892.5 nA) at 10 g. Due to the introduction of interfacial polarization between PVDF and ZnO, the piezoelectric properties and pressure sensitivity of the hybrid ZnO/PVDF is enhanced. The hysterical behavior in the device's response while measuring voltage and current with varying time shows the signature of the triboelectric effect between PVDF and ZnO, as well as PDMS:Carbon black and ZnO/PVDF layers. Reduction of triboelectric behavior was confirmed with increasing relaxation time. Because of the enhancement in piezoelectricity, fiber-structured nanogenerator (FNG) ZnO/PVDF proved to a potential candidate to be used for wearable computing devices, such as smart watches and sports bracelets.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["Vikas NarayanThakur", "Jeong InHan"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14204414\n10.1126/science.1124005\n10.1016/j.jnca.2012.12.028\n10.3390/polym14183875\n10.3390/polym14183730\n10.3390/polym11101667\n10.3390/polym14173672\n10.3390/polym14173670\n10.3390/polym14173652\n10.1038/nnano.2011.36\n10.1021/nn3016585\n10.1021/nl0346427\n10.1007/s13391-015-5239-y\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.03.022\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.05.011\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.04.024\n10.1021/nl061802g\n10.1038/nnano.2008.314\n10.1002/adma.200390100\n10.1063/5.0006261\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111536\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.11.047\n10.1016/j.mtcomm.2020.101846\n10.1039/D0RA00484G\n10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.103924\n10.1016/j.mser.2009.02.001\n10.1039/c2nr31031g\n10.1002/adma.201200150\n10.1002/adma.201303570\n10.1021/acsnano.6b03293\n10.1016/S0022-3093(02)01103-1\n10.1063/1.1358847\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.260\n10.1016/j.surfin.2020.100780\n10.3390/s20113053\n10.1038/srep07887\n10.3390/polym14183912\n10.1039/c2ee22354f\n10.1039/c3cp54083a\n10.1002/adma.200602515\n10.1155/2013/497873\n10.1039/C5RA02631H\n10.1016/j.mee.2006.01.195\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.09.042\n10.1016/j.elecom.2009.02.019\n10.1088/1402-4896/aad749\n10.1016/S0142-9418(03)00003-5\n10.1039/C7TC03767H\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1007/s10854-020-04390-8\n10.1063/1.4895187\n10.1155/2019/5961563\n10.1002/app.45955\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112767\n10.1016/j.bea.2022.100046\n10.1016/j.mee.2008.02.004\n10.1109/TNANO.2018.2833201\n10.1063/1.1712836\n10.1039/d0se01201g\n10.1063/1.4766921\n10.1021/am5018072\n10.3390/chemosensors9020027\n10.1016/j.sna.2022.113368\n10.1039/C8SM01655K\n10.1039/C5RA24602D"}

{"title": "Processes of Electrospun Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Based Nanofibers, Their Piezoelectric Properties, and Several Fantastic Applications.", "abstract": "Since the third scientific and technological revolution, electronic information technology has developed rapidly, and piezoelectric materials that can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy have become a research hotspot. Among them, piezoelectric polymers are widely used in various fields such as water treatment, biomedicine, and flexible sensors due to their good flexibility and weak toxicity. However, compared with ceramic piezoelectric materials, the piezoelectric properties of polymers are poor, so it is very important to improve the piezoelectric properties of polymers. Electrospinning technology can improve the piezoelectric properties of piezoelectric polymers by adjusting electrospinning parameters to control the piezoelectrically active phase transition of polymers. In addition, the prepared nanofibrous membrane is also a good substrate for supporting piezoelectric functional particles, which can also effectively improve the piezoelectric properties of polymers by doping particles. This paper reviews the piezoelectric properties of various electrospun piezoelectric polymer membranes, especially polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based electrospun nanofibrous membranes (NFs). Additionally, this paper introduces the various methods for increasing piezoelectric properties from the perspective of structure and species.

However, the low power output and ineffective transformation of mechanical energy into electric energy l limit the role of PENGs in energy conversion and storage devices, especially in fiber-based wearable electronics. Here, a PAN-PVDF/ZnO PENG with a hierarchical structure was designed through electrospinning and a hydrothermal reaction. Compared with other polymer nanofibers, the PAN-PVDF/ZnO nanocomposites not only showed two distinctive diameter distributions of uniform nanofibers, but also the complete coverage and embedment of ZnO nanorods, which brought about major improvements in both mechanical and piezoelectric properties. Additionally, a simple but effective method to integrate the inorganic nanoparticles into different polymers and regulate the hierarchical structure by altering the types of polymers, concentrations of spinning solutions, and growth conditions of nanoparticles is presented. Further, the designed P-PVDF/ZnO PENG was demonstrated as an energy generator to successfully power nine commercial LEDs.

As the most widely used high-energy explosive, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) is limited in application due to its high sensitivity. In this work, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was used as an energetic binder. Core-shell-structured RDX@PVDF microspheres are produced using electrospray assembly technology and fully characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and mechanical sensitivity. Their thermal stability and mechanical sensitivity are directly related to the weight fraction of the added PVDF. Moreover, core-shell-structured RDX@PVDF microspheres with RDX and PVDF in the proportion three to one possess a spherical-like morphology, the lowest impact sensitivity, the lowest friction sensitivity, and the highest thermal stability.

{"title": "Biocompatible, Multi-Mode, Fluorescent, ", "abstract": "There is a need to improve current cancer treatment regimens to reduce systemic toxicity, to positively impact the quality-of-life post-treatment. We hypothesized the negation of off-target toxicity of anthracyclines (e.g., Doxorubicin) by delivering Doxorubicin on magneto-electric silica nanoparticles (Dox-MagSiNs) to cancer cells. Dox-MagSiNs were completely biocompatible with all cell types and are therapeutically inert till the release of Doxorubicin from the MagSiNs at the cancer cells location. The MagSiNs themselves are comprised of biocompatible components with a magnetostrictive cobalt ferrite core (4\u22126 nm) surrounded by a piezoelectric fused silica shell of 1.5 nm to 2 nm thickness. The MagSiNs possess T2-MRI contrast properties on par with RESOVIST\u2122 due to their cobalt ferrite core. Additionally, the silica shell surrounding the core was volume loaded with green or red fluorophores to fluorescently track the MagSiNs in vitro. This makes the MagSiNs a suitable candidate for trackable, drug nanocarriers. We used metastatic triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDAMB231), ovarian cancer cells (A2780), and prostate cancer cells (PC3) as our model cancer cell lines. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used as control cell lines to represent blood-vessel cells that suffer from the systemic toxicity of Doxorubicin. In the presence of an external magnetic field that is 300\u00d7 times lower than an MRI field, we successfully nanoporated the cancer cells, then triggered the release of 500 nM of doxorubicin from Dox-MagSiNs to successfully kill >50% PC3, >50% A2780 cells, and killed 125% more MDAMB231 cells than free Dox.HCl. In control HUVECs, the Dox-MagSiNs did not nanoporate into the HUVECS and did not exhibited any cytotoxicity at all when there was no triggered release of Dox.HCl. Currently, the major advantages of our approach are, (i) the MagSiNs are biocompatible in vitro and in vivo; (ii) the label-free nanoporation of Dox-MagSiNs into cancer cells and not the model blood vessel cell line; (iii) the complete cancellation of the cytotoxicity of Doxorubicin in the Dox-MagSiNs form; (iv) the clinical impact of such a nanocarrier will be that it will be possible to increase the current upper limit for cumulative-dosages of anthracyclines through multiple dosing, which in turn will improve the anti-cancer efficacy of anthracyclines.", "journal": "Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["MargoWaters", "JulianeHopf", "EmmaTam", "StephanieWallace", "JordanChang", "ZachBennett", "HadrianAquino", "Ryan KRoeder", "PaulHelquist", "M SharonStack", "Prakash DNallathamby"], "doi": "10.3390/ph15101216\n10.2174/157340311799960645\n10.1093/jnci/djp440\n10.1200/JCO.2007.14.3248\n10.4103/2211-4122.117983\n10.2174/1389200216888150915112039\n10.1021/tx000013q\n10.1021/acsami.6b16485\n10.1016/S0041-624X(99)00070-0\n10.1166/jnn.2015.9096\n10.2217/nnm-2017-0080\n10.1038/s41598-017-01647-x\n10.1038/srep20867\n10.2217/nnm-2017-0300\n10.1186/s42234-018-0012-9\n10.1039/C6TB01659F\n10.1039/c3nr02639f\n10.1039/C9NA00461K\n10.1088/1361-6528/aab181\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1671\n10.1002/jbm.b.33302\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048049\n10.1109/TMAG.2017.2719699\n10.1016/j.actamat.2009.09.054\n10.1208/s12249-014-0177-9\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/JNanoR.25.110\n10.1002/anie.201711705\n10.1021/mp800051m\n10.1038/srep02953\n10.1364/BOE.9.001613\n10.1021/cr5004634\n10.1016/0378-5173(87)90200-6\n10.1021/ac0709706\n10.1021/ja8068853\n10.1097/ALN.0b013e31826d3bef\n10.1016/j.actbio.2006.12.001\n10.1021/nl101140t\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00185\n10.7567/JJAP.53.06JL01\n10.3389/fncel.2012.00044\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03295\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.05.002\n10.1097/01.rli.0000184756.66360.d3\n10.1039/C4NR06441K\n10.30919/es8d708\n10.1039/c0nr00080a\n10.4161/cbt.1.5.169\n10.1155/2019/1345026\n10.1002/jbm.b.34800\n10.1074/jbc.M107442200\n10.1038/s41565-020-0639-z\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0067\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00487\n10.1007/s00289-015-1301-z\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2017.11.012\n10.1063/1.5019728\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.06.043\n10.1093/abt/tby003"}

In this work, superhydrophobic n-Al/PVDF films were fabricated by the cryogel-templated method. The underwater ignition performance of the energetic films was investigated. The preparation process of energetic materials is relatively simple, and avoids excessively high temperatures, ensuring the safety of the entire experimental process. The surface of the n-Al/PVDF energetic film exhibits super-hydrophobicity. Because the aluminum nanoparticles are uniformly encased in the hydrophobic energetic binder, the film is more waterproof and anti-aging. Laser-induced underwater ignition experiments show that the superhydrophobic modification can effectively induce the ignition of energetic films underwater.

An alumina oxide ball is glued at the end of each spike of the steel ring and is used as contacting element. The spikes are used to transfer vibrations of the piezoelectric ring to contacting elements and to induce the planar motion of the payload. Additionally, three alumina oxide balls are glued on the top surface of the piezoelectric ring and are used to generate rotational motion of the spherical payload by impacting it. Finally, the top electrode of the piezoceramic ring is divided into six equal sections and is used to control the direction of angular and planar motion of the payload.

{"title": "An Experimental Investigation on Polarization Process of a PZT-52 Tube Actuator with Interdigitated Electrodes.", "abstract": "The manipulator is the key component of the micromanipulator. Using the axial expansion and contraction properties, the piezoelectric tube can drive the manipulator to achieve micro-motion positioning. It is widely used in scanning probe microscopy, fiber stretching and beam scanning. The piezoceramic tube actuator used to have continuous electrodes inside and outside. It is polarized along the radial direction. There are relatively high polarization voltages, but poor axial mechanical properties. A new tubular actuator is presented in this paper by combining interdigitated electrodes and piezoceramic tubes. The preparation, polarization and mesoscopic mechanical properties were investigated. Using Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT-52) as a substrate, the preparation process of interdigitated electrodes by screen printing was studied. For initial polarization voltage determination, the local characteristic model of the actuator was extracted and the electric field was analyzed by a finite element method. By measuring the actuator's axial displacement, we measured the actuator's polarization effect. Various voltages, times and temperatures were evaluated to determine how polarization affects the actuator's displacement. Optimal polarization conditions are 800 V, 60 min and 150 \u00b0C, with a maximum displacement of 0.88 \u03bcm generated by a PZT-52 tube actuator with interdigitated electrodes. PZT-52 tube actuators with a continuous electrode cannot be polarized under these conditions. The maximum displacement is 0.47 \u03bcm after polarization at 4 kV. Based on the results, the new actuator has a more convenient polarization process and a greater axial displacement from an application standpoint. It provides technical guidance for the preparation and polarization of the piezoceramic tube actuator.

{"title": "Temperature Stable Piezoelectric Imprint of Epitaxial Grown PZT for Zero-Bias Driving MEMS Actuator Operation.", "abstract": "In piezoelectric transducer applications, it is common to use a unipolar operation signal to avoid switching of the polarisation and the resulting nonlinearities of micro-electromechanical systems. However, semi-bipolar or bipolar operation signals have the advantages of less leakage current, lower power consumption and no additional need of a DC-DC converter for low AC driving voltages. This study investigates the potential of using piezoelectric layers with an imprint for stable bipolar operation on the basis of epitaxially grown lead zirconate titanate cantilevers with electrodes made of a metal and metal oxide stack. Due to the manufacturing process, the samples exhibit high crystallinity, rectangular shaped hysteresis and a high piezoelectric response. Furthermore, the piezoelectric layers have an imprint, indicating a strong built-in field, which shifts the polarisation versus electric field hysteresis. To obtain the stability of the imprint, laser doppler vibrometry and switching current measurements were performed at different temperatures, yielding a stable imprinted electric field of -1.83 MV/m up to at least 100 \u00b0C. The deflection of the cantilevers was measured with a constant AC driving voltage while varying the DC bias voltage to examine the influence of the imprint under operation, revealing that the same high deflection and low nonlinearities, quantified by the total harmonic distortion, can be maintained down to low bias voltages compared to unipolar operation. These findings demonstrate that a piezoelectric layer with a strong imprint makes it possible to operate with low DC or even zero DC bias, while still providing strong piezoelectric response and linear behaviour.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["MarcoTeuschel", "PaulHeyes", "SamuHorvath", "ChristianNovotny", "AndreaRusconi Clerici"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13101705\n10.1007/s10832-006-6287-3\n10.1063/5.0053943\n10.1038/s41467-020-17950-7\n10.1063/5.0012244\n10.1063/5.0012132\n10.1088/1757-899X/149/1/012190\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.018\n10.3390/coatings11080944\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/085013\n10.1016/j.mseb.2004.06.011\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1166421\n10.1063/1.121610\n10.1038/nmat3141\n10.1063/1.1593830\n10.1088/0953-8984/13/39/304\n10.1063/1.3457348\n10.1063/1.3584031\n10.1080/10584589808208071\n10.1002/aelm.202100115\n10.1088/1742-6596/1400/5/055003\n10.1016/j.ssc.2009.09.042\n10.1063/1.3126707\n10.1038/ncomms4279\n10.1038/s41467-020-20407-6\n10.1111/jace.16367\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/6/065021\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.01.033\n10.1038/srep25028\n10.1103/PhysRevB.75.104103\n10.1063/1.1786364\n10.1007/s10853-015-8907-2\n10.1063/1.1555838"}

{"title": "Low-Cost In Vivo Full-Range Optical Coherence Tomography Using a Voice Coil Motor.", "abstract": "In this work, we demonstrated a novel and low-cost full-range optical coherence tomography (FROCT) method. In comparison with the off-pivot approach, which needs precise control of the deflecting distance and should be adjusted for different situations, our proposed method is more flexible without regulating the system itself. Different from the previous systems reported in the literature, which used a high-cost piezo-driven stage to introduce the phase modulation, our system utilizes a cost-effective voice coil motor for retrieving the complex-valued spectral signal. The complex-valued data, with a twofold increase in the accessible depth range, can be calculated using an algorithm based on the Hilbert transform and Dirac delta function. To confirm the effectivity of our method, both simulation and experiments were performed. In particular, for the in vivo experiment, we presented the FROCT result of a fingernail fold, demonstrating the availability of in vivo imaging. Since the key element of our system is a low-cost voice coil motor, which is flexible and more accessible for most of the clinics, we believe that it has great potential to be a clinical modality in the future.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["XiaoqiaoLiao", "LiangHe", "ZhaoDuan", "PengTian", "YuHe", "QinyuanDeng", "ZeyuMa", "RuiqiSong", "LeixinWu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13101626\n10.1126/science.1957169\n10.1364/OL.28.002067\n10.1117/1.JBO.22.12.121716\n10.1038/s41433-020-0819-y\n10.3390/mi10070474\n10.3390/mi10010035\n10.3390/mi11121051\n10.1364/OL.29.000171\n10.1117/1.JBO.26.10.100601\n10.1186/s13195-020-00715-1\n10.1117/1.2136147\n10.1364/OL.27.001415\n10.1088/0034-4885/66/2/204\n10.1364/OL.30.000147\n10.1038/86589\n10.1364/BOE.408903\n10.1364/OE.11.002183\n10.1016/j.optcom.2003.10.041\n10.1364/OE.14.001487\n10.1364/OL.28.002201\n10.1364/AO.45.001861\n10.1063/1.2437682\n10.1088/2040-8978/12/8/084003\n10.1364/OL.32.003423\n10.1364/OE.15.013375\n10.1364/AO.49.004756"}
{"title": "Working Mechanisms and Experimental Research of Piezoelectric Pump with a Cardiac Valve-like Structure.", "abstract": "In this study, based on the working principle of the cardiac valve structure that prevents blood from flowing back, a piezoelectric pump with a cardiac valve-like structure (PPCVLS) is designed. The operating principles of cardiac-valve-like structures (CVLSs) are introduced. Furthermore, the closure conditions of the CVLSs on both sides of the flow channel are explored. The principle behind the working-state conversion between \"valve-based\" and \"valve-less\" of PPCVLS is also analyzed. A high-speed dynamic microscopic image-analysis system was utilized to observe and verify the working-state conversion between \"valve-based\" and \"valve-less\" PPCVLSs. The resonant frequency of the piezoelectric pump was measured by Doppler laser vibrometer, and the optimal working frequency of the piezoelectric vibrator was determined as 22.35 Hz. The prototype piezoelectric pump was fabricated by the 3D printing technique, and the output performance of the piezoelectric pump was also evaluated. The experimental results show that the piezoelectric pump is valve-based when the driving voltage is greater than 140V, and the piezoelectric pump is valve-less when the driving voltage is less than 140 V. Furthermore, the maximum output pressure of the piezoelectric pump was 199 mm H", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["JiayueZhou", "WantingSun", "JunFu", "HuixiaLiu", "HongmeiWang", "QiufengYan"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13101621\n10.3390/w7095031\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112649\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab8c23\n10.1016/j.powtec.2018.04.009\n10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2629439\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.02.063\n10.3390/app11157061\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107393\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112647\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112567\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112123\n10.3390/app10155294\n10.1039/C8LC00957K\n10.1039/C5LC01396H\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.07.026\n10.1007/s10832-012-9740-5\n10.1177/1045389X20978285\n10.1109/TIE.2021.3066922\n10.3901/CJME.2013.03.462\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/085023\n10.1007/s11434-014-0214-9\n10.3390/app11072909"}

{"title": "Comparison of Four Electrical Interfacing Circuits in Frequency Up-Conversion Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "Efficiently scavenging piezoelectric vibration energy is attracting a lot of interest. One important type is the frequency up-conversion (FUC) energy harvester, in which a low-frequency beam (LFB) impacts a high-frequency beam (HFB). In this paper, four interface circuits, standard energy harvesting (SEH), self-powered synchronous electric charge extraction (SP-SECE), self-powered synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SP-SSHI) and self-powered optimized SECE (SP-OSECE), are compared while rectifying the generated piezoelectric voltage. The efficiencies of the four circuits are firstly tested at constant displacement and further analyzed. Furthermore, the harvested power under FUC is tested for different electromechanical couplings and different load values. The results show that SP-OSECE performs best in the case of a weak coupling or low-load resistance, for which the maximum power can be 43% higher than that of SEH. As the coupling level increases, SP-SSHI becomes the most efficient circuit with a 31% higher maximum power compared to that of SEH. The reasons for the variations in each circuit with different coupling coefficients are also analyzed.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["HanLu", "KairuiChen", "HaoTang", "WeiqunLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13101596\n10.1109/TITS.2014.2366512\n10.1016/j.enbenv.2022.06.005\n10.1109/JIOT.2021.3086186\n10.3390/cryst11060643\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114846\n10.1016/j.physleta.2021.127366\n10.1038/s42005-022-00869-4\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108419\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108047\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/11/026\n10.1557/mrs2009.177\n10.1063/1.4900845\n10.1016/j.mejo.2010.10.007\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.143\n10.1177/1045389X15624795\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.02.048\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.01.033\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/4/045004\n10.1007/s00542-016-3077-y\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.261\n10.3390/mi10100701\n10.1140/epjst/e2019-800211-8\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2021.106838\n10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115643\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1428041\n10.1177/1045389X05056859\n10.1177/1045389X12470307\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.051\n10.1109/TIE.2020.2970662\n10.1088/1361-665X/aae0aa\n10.1177/1045389X14533437\n10.1051/epjap/2012110355\n10.1109/TIE.2011.2167116\n10.1088/1742-6596/476/1/012080\n10.1109/TPEL.2018.2790965\n10.1088/1361-665X/aab339\n10.1109/TIE.2019.2908610\n10.1109/TPEL.2015.2422717\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035005\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.12.033\n10.1109/JMEMS.2011.2162488\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab38fb\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111759\n10.1109/TCSI.2016.2608999\n10.1109/TPEL.2014.2334611\n10.1177/1045389X13517315\n10.3233/JAE-150093"}

{"title": "Atomistic-Scale Energetic Heterogeneity on a Membrane Surface.", "abstract": "Knowing the energetic topology of a surface is important, especially with regard to membrane fouling. In this study, molecular computations were carried out to determine the energetic topology of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with different surface wettability and three representative probe molecules (namely argon, carbon dioxide and water) of different sizes and natures. Among the probe molecules, water has the strongest interaction with the PVDF surface, followed by carbon dioxide and then argon. Argon, which only has van der Waals interactions with PVDF, is a good probing molecule to identify crevices and the molecular profile of a surface. Carbon dioxide, which is the largest probing molecule and does not have dipole moment, exhibits similar van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. As for water, the dominant attractive interactions are electrostatics with fluorine atoms of the intrinsically hydrophobic PVDF membrane, but the electrostatic interactions are much stronger for the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the hydrophilic PVDF due to strong dipole moment. PVDF only becomes hydrophilic when the interaction energy is approximately doubled when grafted with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. The energetic heterogeneity and the effect of different probe molecules revealed here are expected to be valuable in guiding membrane modifications to mitigate fouling.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-10-28", "authors": ["Shiliang JohnathanTan", "ChisiangOng", "JiaweiChew"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12100977\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.117865\n10.1016/S0376-7388(02)00014-5\n10.1016/S0376-7388(96)00351-1\n10.1016/j.jcis.2005.12.031\n10.1080/08927010601035738\n10.1021/j150453a001\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.02.064\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.017\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118369\n10.1006/jcis.1997.5076\n10.1063/1.4982926\n10.1021/jp003919d\n10.1039/C3TA13073H\n10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00251\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.01.027\n10.1021/jp506895p\n10.1021/acsestengg.1c00262\n10.1016/j.carbon.2013.05.036\n10.1021/jp012542o\n10.1002/aic.690470719\n10.1021/j100308a038\n10.1021/ie300248z\n10.1016/S0927-7757(01)00790-7"}

{"title": "Recent nanoengineered diagnostic and therapeutic advancements in management of Sepsis.", "abstract": "COVID-19 acquired symptoms have affected the worldwide population and increased the load of Intensive care unit (ICU) patient admissions. A large number of patients admitted to ICU end with a deadly fate of mortality. A high mortality rate of patients was reported with hospital-acquired septic shock that leads to multiple organ failures and ultimately ends with death. The patients who overcome this septic shock suffer from morbidity that also affects their caretakers. To overcome these situations, scientists are exploring progressive theragnostic techniques with advanced techniques based on biosensors, biomarkers, biozymes, vesicles, and others. These advanced techniques pave the novel way for early detection of sepsis-associated symptoms and timely treatment with appropriate antibiotics and immunomodulators and prevent the undue effect on other parts of the body. There are other techniques like externally modulated electric-based devices working on the principle of piezoelectric mechanism that not only sense the endotoxin levels but also target them with a loaded antibiotic to neutralize the onset of inflammatory response. Recently researchers have developed a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) neutralizing cartridge that not only senses the LPS but also appropriately neutralizes with dual mechanistic insights of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory effects.

A hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) protection layer with ferroelectric \u03b2-phases is formed on the Zn metal using a simple electrospinning method. This suppresses Zn metal failure modes such as side reactions and dendrite growth and supports rapid electrolyte accessibility.

By connecting the audiovisual display device to the skin-attached multi-functional sensor, changes in the body temperature and UV exposure are displayed as LED patterns with accompanying acoustic alarms. This study demonstrates the significant potential of our proposed audiovisual monitoring device and multi-functional sensor for use in health-monitoring applications, especially for the elderly and infants requiring prompt care.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-10-22", "authors": ["YonghuiLee", "GyusungJung", "Sang WooJin", "Jeong SookHa"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c13277"}

{"title": "Expedient secondary functions of flexible piezoelectrics for biomedical energy harvesting.", "abstract": "Flexible piezoelectrics realise the conversion between mechanical movements and electrical power by conformally attaching onto curvilinear surfaces, which are promising for energy harvesting of biomedical devices due to their sustainable body movements and/or deformations. Developing secondary functions of flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters is becoming increasingly significant in recent years via aiming at issues that cannot be addressed or mitigated by merely increasing piezoelectric efficiencies. These issues include loose interfacial contact and pucker generation by stretching, power shortage or instability induced by inadequate mechanical energy, and premature function degeneration or failure caused by fatigue fracture after cyclic deformations. Herein, the expedient secondary functions of flexible piezoelectrics to mitigate above issues are reviewed, including stretchability, hybrid energy harvesting, and self-healing. Efforts have been devoted to understanding the state-of-the-art strategies and their mechanisms of achieving secondary functions based on piezoelectric fundamentals. The link between structural characteristic and function performance is unravelled by providing insights into carefully selected progresses. The remaining challenges of developing secondary functions are proposed in the end with corresponding outlooks.

The current NA extraction methods from FFPE samples using chemical solvent are tedious, environmentally unfriendly, and unamenable to automation or field deployment. We present a tool for NA extraction from FFPE samples using a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) technology. A cartridge strip containing reagents for FFPE sample deparaffinization and NA extraction and purification is operated by an automation tool consisting of a HIFU module, a liquid handling robot unit, and accessories including a thermal block and magnets. The HIFU module is a single concaved piezoelectric ceramic plate driven by a current-mode class-D power amplifier. Based on the ultrasonic cavitation effects, the HIFU module provides highly concentrated energy introducing paraffin emulsification and disintegration.

{"title": "Piezo Actuator-Driven Pulsed Water Jet for Neurosurgery: Laboratory Evaluation with the Swine Model and Implications of Mechanical Properties.", "abstract": "Object Pulsed water jet is an emerging surgical instrumentation intended to achieve both maximal lesion resection and functional maintenance through preservation of fine vessels and minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. The piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet (ADPJ) is a new technology that can deliver a precisely controlled uniform and efficient pulsed water jet with minimum water flow. The present study evaluated the ADPJ system in preclinical animal studies in the swine brain, and investigated breaking strength, one of the parameters for mechanical properties, to elucidate the mechanism of tissue selectivity for tissue dissection by the water jet. Methods This system consisted of a pump chamber driven by a piezo actuator, a stainless steel tube, and a nozzle (internal diameter: 0.15 mm). The water was supplied at 6 ml/min. The relationship between input voltage (3-25 V at 400 Hz) and peak pressure was measured using a pressure sensor through a sensing hole. Temporal profile of dissection depth during moving application was evaluated using gelatin brain phantom and swine brain. The dissected specimens were evaluated histologically. The mechanical property (breaking strength) of swine brain was measured by a compact table-top universal tester. Results Peak pressure increased linearly with increase in the input voltage, which reflected dissection depth in both the gelatin brain phantom and swine brain. Small arteries were preserved, and minimum damage to surrounding tissues occurred. The breaking strength of arachnoid membrane (0.12 \u00b1 0.014 MPa) was significantly higher compared to gray matter (0.030 \u00b1 0.010 MPa) and white matter (0.056 \u00b1 0.009 MPa) (p < 0.05). The breaking strength of gray matter corresponded to that of 3 wt% gelatin, and that of white matter corresponded to a value between those of 3.5 and 4 wt% gelatin, and the dissection depth seemed to be estimated by 3-4 wt% gelatin. Conclusion The present study suggests that the ADPJ system has the potential to achieve accurate tissue dissection with preservation of blood vessels in neurosurgery.

Herein, we propose the PVDF@Ag-ZnO/Au composite nanofiber membranes utilizing the piezoelectric and plasmonic effects to promote the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. Here, ZnO nanorods can generate a built-in electric field under vibration to separate electron-hole pairs. The Schottky junction formed by noble metal/semiconductor can not only inhibit the recombination of photo-generated carriers and accelerate the migration of carriers, but also enhance the utilization of visible light. In addition, the structure has excellent flexibility and easy recycling characteristics. We demonstrate that the plasmonic effect of noble metal can enhance the light response of membranes and broaden light absorption from ultraviolet to visible light region. With the help of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), modulation effects of the piezoelectric effect on light response is proved. For catalytic processes, rhodamine B (98.8%) can be almost completely degraded using PVDF@Ag-ZnO/Au within 120 minutes in the piezoelectric photocatalysis process, which is 2.2 and 2.8 times higher than photocatalysis and piezoelectric catalysis, respectively.

{"title": "Silicon nitride stress-optic microresonator modulator for optical control applications.", "abstract": "Modulation-based control and locking of lasers, filters and other photonic components is a ubiquitous function across many applications that span the visible to infrared (IR), including atomic, molecular and optical (AMO), quantum sciences, fiber communications, metrology, and microwave photonics. Today, modulators used to realize these control functions consist of high-power bulk-optic components for tuning, sideband modulation, and phase and frequency shifting, while providing low optical insertion loss and operation from DC to 10s of MHz. In order to reduce the size, weight and cost of these applications and improve their scalability and reliability, modulation control functions need to be implemented in a low loss, wafer-scale CMOS-compatible photonic integration platform. The silicon nitride integration platform has been successful at realizing extremely low waveguide losses across the visible to infrared and components including high performance lasers, filters, resonators, stabilization cavities, and optical frequency combs. Yet, progress towards implementing low loss, low power modulators in the silicon nitride platform, while maintaining wafer-scale process compatibility has been limited.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membranes with Self-Powered and Electrified Antifouling Performance in Pressure-Driven Ultrafiltration Processes.", "abstract": "Electroactive membranes have the potential to address membrane fouling via electrokinetic phenomena. However, additional energy consumption and complex material design represent chief barriers to achieving sustainable and economically viable antifouling performance. Herein, we present a novel strategy for fabricating a piezoelectric antifouling polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Pi-UFM) by integrating the ion-dipole interactions (NaCl coagulation bath) and mild poling (in situ electric field) into a one-step phase separation process. This Pi-UFM with an intact porous structure could be self-powered in a typical ultrafiltration (UF) process via the responsivity to pressure stimuli, where the dominant \u03b2-PVDF phase and the out-of-plane aligned dipoles were demonstrated to be critical to obtain piezoelectricity. By challenging with different feed solutions, the Pi-UFM achieved enhanced antifouling capacity for organic foulants even with high ionic strength, suggesting that electrostatic repulsion and hydration repulsion were behind the antifouling mechanism. Furthermore, the TMP-dependent output performance of the Pi-UFM in both air and water confirmed its ability for converting ambient mechanical energy to in situ surface potential (\u03b6), demonstrating that this antifouling performance was a result of the membrane electromechanical transducer actions. Therefore, this study provides useful insight and strategy to enable piezoelectric materials for membrane filtration applications with energy efficiency and extend functionalities.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["YangZhang", "HaoquanZhang", "LinglingChen", "JieWang", "JunWang", "JianLi", "YuanZhao", "MengZhang", "HongweiZhang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.2c05359"}
{"title": "Leveraging IoT-Aware Technologies and AI Techniques for Real-Time Critical Healthcare Applications.", "abstract": "Personalised healthcare has seen significant improvements due to the introduction of health monitoring technologies that allow wearable devices to unintrusively monitor physiological parameters such as heart health, blood pressure, sleep patterns, and blood glucose levels, among others. Additionally, utilising advanced sensing technologies based on flexible and innovative biocompatible materials in wearable devices allows high accuracy and precision measurement of biological signals. Furthermore, applying real-time Machine Learning algorithms to highly accurate physiological parameters allows precise identification of unusual patterns in the data to provide health event predictions and warnings for timely intervention. However, in the predominantly adopted architectures, health event predictions based on Machine Learning are typically obtained by leveraging Cloud infrastructures characterised by shortcomings such as delayed response times and privacy issues. Fortunately, recent works highlight that a new paradigm based on Edge Computing technologies and on-device Artificial Intelligence significantly improve the latency and privacy issues. Applying this new paradigm to personalised healthcare architectures can significantly improve their efficiency and efficacy. Therefore, this paper reviews existing IoT healthcare architectures that utilise wearable devices and subsequently presents a scalable and modular system architecture to leverage emerging technologies to solve identified shortcomings. The defined architecture includes ultrathin, skin-compatible, flexible, high precision piezoelectric sensors, low-cost communication technologies, on-device intelligence, Edge Intelligence, and Edge Computing technologies. To provide development guidelines and define a consistent reference architecture for improved scalable wearable IoT-based critical healthcare architectures, this manuscript outlines the essential functional and non-functional requirements based on deductions from existing architectures and emerging technology trends. The presented system architecture can be applied to many scenarios, including ambient assisted living, where continuous surveillance and issuance of timely warnings can afford independence to the elderly and chronically ill. We conclude that the distribution and modularity of architecture layers, local AI-based elaboration, and data packaging consistency are the more essential functional requirements for critical healthcare application use cases.

{"title": "Multimodal Finger Pulse Wave Sensing: Comparison of Forcecardiography and Photoplethysmography Sensors.", "abstract": "Pulse waves (PWs) are mechanical waves that propagate from the ventricles through the whole vascular system as brisk enlargements of the blood vessels' lumens, caused by sudden increases in local blood pressure. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is one of the most widespread techniques employed for PW sensing due to its ability to measure blood oxygen saturation. Other sensors and techniques have been proposed to record PWs, and include applanation tonometers, piezoelectric sensors, force sensors of different kinds, and accelerometers. The performances of these sensors have been analyzed individually, and their results have been found not to be in good agreement (e.g., in terms of PW morphology and the physiological parameters extracted). Such a comparison has led to a deeper comprehension of their strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately, to the consideration that a multimodal approach accomplished via sensor fusion would lead to a more robust, reliable, and potentially more informative methodology for PW monitoring. However, apart from various multichannel and multi-site systems proposed in the literature, no true multimodal sensors for PW recording have been proposed yet that acquire PW signals simultaneously from the same measurement site. In this study, a true multimodal PW sensor is presented, which was obtained by integrating a piezoelectric forcecardiography (FCG) sensor and a PPG sensor, thus enabling simultaneous mechanical-optical measurements of PWs from the same site on the body. The novel sensor performance was assessed by measuring the finger PWs of five healthy subjects at rest. The preliminary results of this study showed, for the first time, that a delay exists between the PWs recorded simultaneously by the PPG and FCG sensors. Despite such a delay, the pulse waveforms acquired by the PPG and FCG sensors, along with their first and second derivatives, had very high normalized cross-correlation indices in excess of 0.98. Six well-established morphological parameters of the PWs were compared via linear regression, correlation, and Bland-Altman analyses, which showed that some of these parameters were not in good agreement for all subjects.

The passive Helmholtz resonator is constructed using an SU8 photolithography-defined square opening plate as the neck portion, a 3D-printed hollow structure with a threaded insert nut, and a precision set screw to form the volume-controllable cavity of the Helmholtz resonator. The fabricated piezoelectric films acted as ultrasonic actuators attached to the surface of the neck SU8 plate. Experimental results show that the sound pressure level (SPL) and operation bandwidth could be effectively tuned, and a 200% SPL increase and twofold bandwidth enhancement are achieved when setting the cavity length to 0.75 mm compared with the open-cavity case. A modified Helmholtz resonator model is proposed to explain the experimental results. The adjusting factors of the effective mass and viscous damper are created to modify the existing parameters in the conventional Helmholtz resonator model. The relationship between the adjusting factors and cavity length can be described well using a two-term power series curve. This modified Helmholtz resonator model not only provides insight into this active-type Helmholtz resonator operation but also provides a useful estimation for its optimal design and fabrication.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["Guo-HuaFeng", "Wen-ShengChen"], "doi": "10.3390/s22197471\n10.1007/s00419-008-0279-5\n10.1242/jeb.160234\n10.1134/S1063771017030071\n10.1063/5.0024804\n10.1063/5.0046582\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.03.014\n10.1016/j.jsv.2008.09.006\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2012.03.016\n10.1063/1.5042683\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.078\n10.1016/j.measurement.2021.109856\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/2/023001\n10.1109/JMEMS.2011.2160045\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/5/055013\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/10/104001\n10.1063/5.0074701\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2861575\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/8/085019\n10.3390/s19214696\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab67ca\n10.1016/S0921-5107(03)00193-4\n10.1098/rsos.171363\n10.35848/1882-0786/ac444a\n10.1121/1.2839000\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2993805\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.05.008\n10.1260/147547202760236969"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from Rotational Motion to Power Industrial Maintenance Sensors.", "abstract": "In industry, forecasting machinery failures could save significant time and money if any maintenance breaks are predictable. The aim of this work was to develop an energy harvesting system which could, in theory, power condition monitoring sensors in heavy machinery. In this study, piezoelectric-cantilever-type energy harvesters were attached to a motor and spun around with different rotational speeds. A mass was placed on the tip of the cantilevers, which were mounted pointing inward toward the center axis of the motor. Pointing a cantilever tip inward and increasing the distance from the center axis of the motor decreased the natural resonance frequency significantly and thus enabled higher harvested energy levels with lower rotational frequencies. Motion of the cantilever was also controlled by altering the movement space of the tip mass. This created another possibility to control the cantilever dynamics and prevent overstressing of the piezoelectric material. Restricting the movement of the tip mass can also be used to harvest energy over a wider frequency range and prevent the harvester from getting trapped into a stagnant position. The highest calculated raw power of 579.2 \u00b5W at 7.4 Hz rotational frequency was measured from a cantilever with outer dimensions of 25 mm \u00d7 100 mm.

Numerical tests were divided into two main parts-analysis of the dynamics of the system due to periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic solutions and the efficiency of energy generation. The results of numerical simulations were limited to zero initial conditions as they are the natural position of the static equilibrium. The article compares the energy efficiency for the selected range of the dimensionless excitation frequency. For this purpose, three cases of piezoelectric mounting were analyzed-only on the first stage of the beam, on the second and both stages. The analysis has been carried out with the use of diagrams showing difference of the effective values of the voltage induced on the piezoelectric electrodes.

The methods investigated include a structure-borne sound acoustic, a dielectric, an optical and a strain-based observation method, which for the first time are measured simultaneously on one and the same resin sample. In addition, the degree of cure is determined using a kinetic resin model based on temperature measurement data. The comparison shows that the methods have considerable but well-explainable differences in their sensitivity, interference immunity and repeatability. Some measurement methods are only sensitive before and around the gel point, while the strain-based measurement method only reacts to the curing from the gel point onwards. These differences have to be taken into account when implementing a cure monitoring system. For this reason, a multi-sensor node is suitable for component-integrated curing monitoring, measuring several physical properties of the epoxy resin simultaneously.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["AlexanderKyriazis", "ChristianPommer", "DavidLohuis", "KorbinianRager", "AndreasDietzel", "MichaelSinapius"], "doi": "10.3390/s22197301\n10.5772/intechopen.82353\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2022.107701\n10.1002/pat.5589\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2005.09.015\n10.1007/s11740-018-0793-4\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2013.01.021\n10.1016/j.tca.2004.08.010\n10.1007/s10973-018-7961-9\n10.1002/app.34605\n10.1177/0021998310387683\n10.1021/ma501441c\n10.1002/pen.21448\n10.1016/j.crci.2006.06.006\n10.1007/s10856-009-3822-1\n10.1002/pola.22319\n10.1002/app.1994.070531310\n10.1002/pen.24550\n10.1002/chem.201700907\n10.1002/app.11745\n10.1016/0142-9612(95)00240-5\n10.1002/app.20584\n10.1016/0266-3538(93)90108-S\n10.1088/0964-1726/5/4/005\n10.1177/002199839703100106\n10.1088/0964-1726/7/2/002\n10.1088/0964-1726/7/4/017\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00361-7\n10.1002/pc.10207\n10.1557/mrs2002.122\n10.1002/app.30115\n10.1088/0957-0233/21/11/117001\n10.1002/pen.23596\n10.3390/s150818229\n10.1088/2053-1591/aaad33\n10.1002/pc.750150408\n10.1016/0266-3538(95)00007-0\n10.1177/002199839603001302\n10.1177/0021998304040563\n10.1016/S0263-8223(02)00072-7\n10.1016/S1359-8368(97)00020-6\n10.1007/s00170-015-6892-x\n10.1007/s00170-016-8338-5\n10.1109/ISSE.2016.7563239\n10.1590/1980-5373-mr-2017-0067\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.03.015\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.01.141\n10.1021/acssensors.8b00425\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.03.017\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.10.007\n10.3390/proceedings1040612\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.825-826.936\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2309172\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2885708\n10.1088/0953-8984/11/10A/004\n10.1109/TASC.2004.830477\n10.1177/0731684402021002353\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.10.029\n10.1109/JSEN.2010.2050475\n10.1038/srep44056\n10.1016/0143-7496(94)90035-3\n10.1177/073168449501400306\n10.1002/pen.10327\n10.1002/polb.24101\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(19990906)73:10<1969::AID-APP16>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1002/pen.11196\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.404\n10.1002/masy.200750107\n10.1088/0957-0233/22/12/124002\n10.1111/j.1747-1567.2011.00741.x\n10.3390/ma6093783\n10.1002/pc.25811\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107397\n10.3390/s18010096\n10.3390/s21010172\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112861\n10.3390/jcs4030115\n10.3390/s21196479\n10.1021/ja01856a061\n10.1063/1.1750906\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(19970705)65:1<17::AID-APP3>3.0.CO;2-T\n10.1002/pen.760342002\n10.1243/09544100JAERO158\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2014.07.027\n10.1016/S0079-6700(02)00027-8"}

It is found that (i) in contrast to bulk and surface acoustic waves propagating in piezoelectric semiconductors, the acoustoelectric attenuation of the modes is not symmetric in respect to its maximum, (ii) a large increase in attenuation may be accompanied by a small decrease in phase velocity and vice versa, (iii) the peculiarities are valid for \"pure\" (without beam steering) and \"not pure\" (with beam steering) modes, as well as for modes of different orders and polarizations, and (iv) conductivity of test liquid increases electromagnetic leakage between input and output transducers, affecting results of the measurements. To decrease the leakage, the liquid should be localized between transducers, outside the zone over them. If so, the mode sensitivity may be as large as 8.6 dB/(S/m) for amplitude and 107\u00b0/(S/m) for phase.

{"title": "Additively Manufactured Detection Module with Integrated Tuning Fork for Enhanced Photo-Acoustic Spectroscopy.", "abstract": "Starting from Quartz-Enhanced Photo-Acoustic Spectroscopy (QEPAS), we have explored the potential of a tightly linked method of gas/vapor sensing, from now on referred to as Tuning-Fork-Enhanced Photo-Acoustic Spectroscopy (TFEPAS). TFEPAS utilizes a non-piezoelectric metal or dielectric tuning fork to transduce the photoacoustic excitation and an optical interferometric readout to measure the amplitude of the tuning fork vibration. In particular, we have devised a solution based on Additive Manufacturing (AM) for the Absorption Detection Module (ADM). The novelty of our solution is that the ADM is entirely built monolithically by Micro-Metal Laser Sintering (MMLS) or other AM techniques to achieve easier and more cost-effective customization, extreme miniaturization of internal volumes, automatic alignment of the tuning fork with the acoustic micro-resonators, and operation at high temperature. This paper reports on preliminary experimental results achieved with ammonia at parts-per-million concentration in nitrogen to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution. Prospectively, the proposed TFEPAS solution appears particularly suited for hyphenation to micro-Gas Chromatography and for the analysis of complex solid and liquid traces samples, including compounds with low volatility such as illicit drugs, explosives, and persistent chemical warfare agents.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["RobertoViola", "NicolaLiberatore", "SandroMengali"], "doi": "10.3390/s22197193\n10.1364/OL.27.001902\n10.1063/1.1884196\n10.3390/s140406165\n10.3390/app8101822\n10.1364/OL.32.001177\n10.1088/1742-6596/157/1/012002\n10.3390/s100908466\n10.1007/s00340-014-5809-y\n10.1016/j.pacs.2020.100169\n10.1364/OL.37.004461\n10.1364/OE.22.028222\n10.1364/OE.15.007357\n10.1007/s00340-010-4183-7\n10.3390/s20010120\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.12.096\n10.1155/2016/5757361\n10.1007/s00340-010-4222-4\n10.1364/OE.26.009666\n10.1016/j.pacs.2019.100155\n10.1007/s00340-010-4072-0\n10.1080/23746149.2016.1271285"}

In view of the limitations of large transducer size, single fixed beam angle, low detection resolution and high cost of conventional ultrasonic inspection technologies, a 16-channel piezoelectric micro ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) array probe was developed through theoretical analysis and structural optimization design. After the probe impedance characterization, the experimental results show that the theoretical model can effectively guide the design of the ultrasonic transducer array, offering the maximum operating frequency deviation of less than 5%. The ultrasonic echo performance tests indicate that the average -6 dB bandwidth of the PMUT array probe can be up to 77.9%. In addition, the fabricated PMUT array probe has been used to successfully detect five common internal defects in pipeline girth welds.

{"title": "The Aging Performance of PVDF in Acid Oil and Gas Medium.", "abstract": "In the process of transporting oil and gas, the service performance of thermoplastic pipes will decline due to the multiple influences of medium, temperature, and pressure. In order to study the service performance changes of PVDF pipes under oil and gas transportation conditions, the high-temperature autoclave is used to simulate the service state of the pipe in the mediums. The PVDF samples are exposed to simulated oil and gas mediums for 1 week, 3 weeks, 5 weeks, and 7 weeks under 60 \u00b0C and 90 \u00b0C conditions. After the exposure test, the physical and chemical properties of the PVDF pipe are tested and compared with the initial samples. Compared with the initial sample, the sample quality after the exposure test has a slight increase, with growth rates of 2% and 3% at 60 \u00b0C and 90 \u00b0C, respectively. Meanwhile, the tensile strength of the samples is about 13% and 21% lower than that of the initial sample, respectively. According to the microscopic morphology analyses, there are some crack defects on the surface of the sample after the exposure test. Through infrared analysis, it is shown that no molecular chain breakage, crosslinking, or other reactions are found after the exposure test. The above analysis shows that the PVDF sample has slight penetration and swelling during the exposure test.

In this context, the electrospinning process has gained prominence in obtaining fibers of micro- and nanometric sizes from polymeric solutions aiming to produce scaffolds for tissue engineering. In this manuscript, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) was used as a polymeric matrix for the manufacture of piezoelectric scaffolds, exploring the formation of the \u03b2-PVDF piezoelectric phase. Micro- and nanometric hydroxyapatite (HA) particles were incorporated as a dispersed phase in this matrix, aiming to produce multifunctional composite membranes also with bioactive properties. The results show that it is possible to produce membranes containing micro- and nanofibers of the composite by the electrospinning process. The HA particles show good dispersion in the polymer matrix and predominance of \u03b2-PVDF phase. Also, the composite showed apatite growth on its surface after 21 days of immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF).

The adhesive precoated (APC) Flash-Free brackets were placed on the buccal surfaces of sixty maxillary first premolars, which were divided into three equal groups of 20 specimens each, following the control group (no scaling), the magnetostrictive group, and the piezoelectric group. All specimens were measured for SBS value by using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.75 mm/minute. The mode of failure was examined under a\u00d710 magnification light microscope digital camera and scores for the adhesive remnant index (ARI) were recorded and measured load between the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric groups. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and multiple comparison, as well as unpaired t-test and chi-square tests, at the 0.05 significance level were used. The results showed that the average SBS value of the control group was greater than that of the magnetostrictive group and the piezoelectric group. However, the SBS was not significantly influenced by ultrasonic instruments (p > 0.05). The ARI score and load showed no significant differences among the groups (p > 0.05).

{"title": "Structural Health Monitoring Impact Classification Method Based on Bayesian Neural Network.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for multi-class classification and uncertainty quantification of impact events on a flat composite plate with a structural health monitoring (SHM) system by using a Bayesian neural network (BNN). Most of the existing research in passive sensing has focused on deterministic approaches for impact detection and characterization. However, there are variability in impact location, angle and energy in real operational conditions which results in uncertainty in the diagnosis. Therefore, this paper proposes a reliability-based impact characterization method based on BNN for the first time. Impact data are acquired by a passive sensing system of piezoelectric (PZT) sensors. Features extracted from the sensor signals, such as their transferred energy, frequency at maximum amplitude and time interval of the largest peak, are used to develop a BNN for impact classification (i.e., energy level). To test the robustness and reliability of the proposed model to impact variability, it is trained with perpendicular impacts and tested by variable angle impacts. The same dataset is further applied in a method called multi-artificial neural network (multi-ANN) to compare its ability in uncertainty quantification and its computational efficiency against the BNN for validation of the developed meta-model. It is demonstrated that both the BNN and multi-ANN can measure the uncertainty and confidence of the diagnosis from the prediction results. Both have very high performance in classifying impact energies when the networks are trained and tested with perpendicular impacts of different energy and location, with 94% and 98% reliable predictions for BNN and multi-ANN, respectively. However, both metamodels struggled to detect new impact scenarios (angled impacts) when the data set was not used in the development stage and only used for testing. Including additional features improved the performance of the networks in regularization; however, not to the acceptable accuracy. The BNN significantly outperforms the multi-ANN in computational time and resources. For perpendicular impacts, both methods can reach a reliable accuracy, while for angled impacts, the accuracy decreases but the uncertainty provides additional information that can be further used to improve the classification.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["HaofanYu", "Aldyandra HamiSeno", "ZahraSharif Khodaei", "M H FerriAliabadi"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14193947\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112403\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.03.032\n10.1016/0266-3538(95)00018-6\n10.1016/S0963-8695(02)00004-X\n10.3390/s19224933\n10.1002/stc.1910\n10.4236/wjm.2017.72003\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1928\n10.1109/JIOT.2018.2867722\n10.1177/1475921707081979\n10.1109/58.143172\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107107\n10.1177/1687814020914732\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.05.047\n10.3390/s18092955\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.05.050\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/10/105026\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/085014\n10.3390/ma9110946\n10.1109/MAES.2018.170157\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025016\n10.1109/TIM.2015.2450354\n10.1155/2021/6658575\n10.3390/s19173733\n10.1142/S1756973716400059\n10.1016/j.jsv.2016.10.043\n10.1177/1475921720932813\n10.1260/136943306778812787\n10.1155/2014/837963\n10.1016/j.strusafe.2012.01.004\n10.1162/neco.1992.4.3.448\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.04.023\n10.3390/s19173659\n10.1088/1361-665X/abb06e"}

{"title": "Smart Self-Nourishing and Self-Healing Artificial Skin Composite Using Bionic Microvascular Containing Liquid Agent.", "abstract": "Artificial skin composites have attracted great interest in functional composite materials. The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize a smart artificial skin composite comprising a bionic microvascular with both self-nourishing and self-healing functions. A poly(vinyl alcohol)-glycerol-gelatin double network organic hydrogel was used as the artificial skin matrix. The hydrogel had high mechanical strength because of the strong hydrogen bond formed between the PVA and glycerol (GL). The gelatin (GEL) increased the toughness and elasticity of the hydrogel to ensure the strength of the artificial skin and fit of the interface with the body.

Barium titanate nanocomposites can achieve attractive performance, provided that the compatibility between ceramic particles and polymeric matrices is enhanced to the benefit of the physical properties of the final composite. Tuning the particle-matrix interface through particle functionalization represents a viable solution. In this work, surface functionalization of BT nanoparticles (NPs), obtained by hydrothermal synthesis, with 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 2-[(acetoxy(polyethyleneoxy)propyl]triethoxysilane and triethoxysilylpropoxy(polyethyleneoxy)dodecanoate, was performed after optimizing the hydroxylation process of the NPs to improve their surface reactivity and increase the yield of grafting. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and thermogravimetric analysis were used to quantify the molecules grafted onto the ceramic nanoparticles. Both bare and functionalized particles were employed in the realization of epoxy- and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based nanocomposites.

Atmosphere-assisted FLASH sintering (AAFS) combines the direct use of electric power to packed powders with the engineering of operating atmosphere to allow low-temperature conduction. The AAFS of nanometric Potassium Sodium Niobate, K0.5Na0.5NbO3, a lead-free piezoelectric, is of great interest to electronics technology to produce efficient, low-thermal-budget sensors, actuators and piezo harvesters, among others. Not previously studied, the role of different atmospheres for the decrease in FLASH temperature (TF) of KNN is presented in this work. Additionally, the effect of the humidity presence on the operating atmosphere and the role of the compact morphology undergoing FLASH are investigated. While the low partial pressure of oxygen (reducing atmospheres) allows the decrease of TF, limited densification is observed. It is shown that AAFS is responsible for a dramatic decrease in the operating temperature (T < 320 \u00b0C), while water is essential to allow appreciable densification.

{"title": "Solvent-Free Fabrication of Thick Electrodes in Thermoplastic Binders for High Energy Density Lithium-Ion Batteries.", "abstract": "The rapid development of electric vehicles has generated a recent demand for high energy density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). One simple, effective way to enhance energy density of LIBs is to increase the thickness of electrodes. However, the conventional wet process used to fabricate thick electrodes involves the evaporation of large amounts of organic solvents, which causes an inhomogeneous distribution of conductive additives and binders. This weakens the mechanical and electrochemical network between active materials, resulting in poor electrochemical performance and structural degradation. Herein, we introduce a new strategy to produce homogeneous thick electrodes by using a dry, solvent-free process. Instead of using a conventional PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) binder, we employed a phenoxy resin as the binder in dry process for the first time. This thermoplastic binder exhibits better ductile properties than PVDF in the way that it generates a uniform network structure that connects the active materials during the hot press process.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Nanogenerator Based on Electrospinning PVDF/Cellulose Acetate Composite Membranes for Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "The organic piezoelectric polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has attracted extensive research because of its excellent flexibility and mechanical energy-harvesting properties. Here, the electrospinning technique was taken to fabricate synthesized fiber membranes of a PVDF/cellulose acetate (CA) composite. The obtained PVDF/CA electrospun fiber membranes (EFMs) were employed to prepare a flexible nanogenerator. XRD and FTIR spectroscopy revealed the enhancement of piezoelectric behavior due to an increase in \u03b2-phase in PVDF/CA EFMs compared with cast films. The PVDF/CA fibers (mass ratio of PVDF to CA = 9:1) showed an output voltage of 7.5 V and a short-circuit current of 2.1 \u03bcA under mechanical stress of 2 N and frequency of 1 Hz, which were 2.5 and two times greater than those of the pure PVDF fibers, respectively. By charging a 4.7 \u00b5F capacitor for 15 min with the voltage generated by the PVDF/CA EFMs, nine LED lamps could be lit.

The effect of the MLD process temperature (110 \u00b0C, 125 \u00b0C) and of the calcination temperature (340 \u00b0C, 400 \u00b0C, 500 \u00b0C) on the chemical, morphological, and crystallographic properties of the resulting ZnO was thoroughly investigated. Spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals that the thickness of the calcinated layers depends on the MLD temperature, resulting in 38-43% and 52-56% of remaining thickness for the 110 \u00b0C and 125 \u00b0C samples, respectively.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Response and Substrate Effect of ZnO Nanowires for Mechanical Energy Harvesting in Internet-of-Things Applications.", "abstract": "Recently, an unprecedented growth in the internet of things (IoT) is being observed, which is becoming the main driver for the entire semiconductor industry. Reliable maintenance and servicing of the IoT is becoming challenging, knowing that the IoT nodes outnumber the human population by a factor of seven. Energy harvesting (EH) can overcome those difficulties, delivering the energyautonomous IoT nodes to the market. EH converts natural or waste energies (vibrations, heat losses, air flows, light, etc.) into useful energy. This article explores the performance of ZnO nanowires under mechanical actuation to characterize their piezoelectric performance. ZnO nanowires were fabricated using ALD and a subsequent chemical bath growth. AISI 301 steel was used as a substrate of the EH device to better fit the mechanical requirements for the piezoelectric generator. We determined that a thin layer of another oxide below ZnO provides outstanding adhesion. The samples were submitted under repetitive mechanical stress in order to characterize the output piezovoltage for different conditions. They exhibited a piezoelectric signal which was stable after hundreds of actuations. This shows good promise for the use of our device based on ZnO, an Earth-abundant and non-toxic material, as an alternative to the conventional and popular but harmful and toxic PZT. The designed measurement setup demonstrated that a AISI 301 steel substrate coated with ZnO deposited by ALD and grown in a chemical bath has promising performance as a piezoelectric material. Characterized ZnO samples generate up to 80 nJ of energy during 55 s runs under matched load conditions, which is sufficient to supply a modern IoT node.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["MateuszWlaz\u0142o", "MaciejHaras", "GrzegorzKo\u0142odziej", "OliwiaSzawcow", "JakubOstapko", "WojciechAndrysiewicz", "Dzmitry SKharytonau", "ThomasSkotnicki"], "doi": "10.3390/ma15196767\n10.1109/COMST.2015.2444095\n10.1257/aer.91.2.268\n10.1038/nnano.2010.89\n10.3390/s140304755\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.013\n10.1016/j.sse.2008.12.011\n10.1088/0957-0233/25/1/012002\n10.1117/12.2084574\n10.3390/s151026039\n10.1109/eumc.2008.4751554\n10.1109/micc.2009.5431410\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/10/104006\n10.1109/DTIP36261.2015\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953019\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975424\n10.1098/rsnr.2011.0049\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.03.107\n10.1258/ult.2011.011027\n10.1155/2012/358953\n10.1109/ultsym.1987.199059\n10.1002/9781119991151.fmatter\n10.1016/j.renene.2010.06.014\n10.1002/adma.201003161\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1401\n10.1177/1045389X13510788\n10.1109/40.928763\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/4/403\n10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00248-7\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/1/007\n10.1177/1045389X05053151\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.12.032\n10.1109/MPRV.2005.14\n10.1109/cicc.2005.1568617\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/4/011\n10.1016/j.mejo.2006.07.023\n10.48550/ARXIV.0711.3309\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/5/055017\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.03.299\n10.1126/science.1124005\n10.1126/science.1139366\n10.1039/c2nr31031g\n10.1039/c3ee41889h\n10.1016/j.arabjc.2016.12.010\n10.3390/ma13061368\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105986\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07875\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.07.007\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.10.073\n10.1166/jnn.2006.354\n10.1002/adma.201001289\n10.3390/nanoenergyadv2020008\n10.1016/j.jmrt.2020.11.038\n10.1007/s11051-018-4348-6\n10.1007/s42452-019-0642-x\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/4/045604\n10.1039/C5TC02977E"}

{"title": "Mechanosensitive Ion Channel PIEZO1 Signaling in the Hall-Marks of Cancer: Structure and Functions.", "abstract": "Tumor cells alter their characteristics and behaviors during tumorigenesis. These characteristics, known as hallmarks of cancer, are crucial for supporting their rapid growth, need for energy, and adaptation to tumor microenvironment. Tumorigenesis is also accompanied by alteration in mechanical properties. Cells in tumor tissue sense mechanical signals from the tumor microenvironment, which consequently drive the acquisition of hallmarks of cancer, including sustained proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, apoptosis resistance, sustained angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion. Piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1) is a mechanically sensitive ion channel protein that can be activated mechanically and is closely related to various diseases. Recent studies showed that Piezo1 mediates tumor development through multiple mechanisms, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, the discovery of Piezo1, which links-up physical factors with biological properties, provides a new insight for elucidating the mechanism of tumor progression under a mechanical microenvironment, and suggests its potential application as a tumor marker and therapeutic target. In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding the role of Piezo1 in regulating cancer hallmarks and the underlying molecular mechanisms.

In this work, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was employed as the carrier for \u03b1-glucosidase immobilization. By virtue of the co-polymerization of tannic acid (TA) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and the hydrolysis of APTES, a hierarchical layer-colloidal nanospheres coating was decorated on the surface of PVDF membrane. Subsequently, \u03b1-glucosidase was covalently bound to the modified PVDF membrane through Schiff base reaction and Michael addition reaction between the residual quinine groups in the coating and the amino groups in enzyme molecules. Several parameters affecting the immobilization procedure were investigated thoroughly. The morphology and functional groups of the prepared composite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared-Attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Combined with capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis, the performance, enzyme reaction kinetics and inhibition kinetics of PVDF-immobilized \u03b1-glucosidase were studied. The immobilized enzyme exhibited the enhanced tolerance to temperature and pH value. In addition, it possessed good reusability maintaining 77.1% of initial relative activity after 11 recycles, and batch-to-batch reproducibility with RSD of 4.3% (n\u00a0=\u00a010).

Thus, a piezoelectric fiber membrane is embedded into a highly hydratable light-absorbing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel for synergistic water activation. The integrated evaporator is capable of continuously converting the wave energy reserved in the ocean into electrical energy, activating the water in the hydrogel.

{"title": "Fluoropolymers and Their Nanohybrids As Energy Materials: Application to Fuel Cells and Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "The current review article provides deep insight into the fluoropolymers and their applications in energy technology, especially in the field of energy harvesting and the development of fuel cell electrolyte polymeric membranes. Fluoropolymers have gained wide attention in the field of energy applications due to their versatile properties. The incorporation of nanofillers within the fluoropolymer to develop the nanohybrid results in an enhancement in the properties, like thermal, mechanical, gas permeation, different fuel cross-over phenomena through the membrane, hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature, ion transport, and piezo-electric properties for fabricating energy devices. The properties of nanohybrid materials/membranes are influenced by several factors, such as type of filler, their size, amount of filler, level of dispersion, surface acidity, shape, and formation of networking within the polymer matrix. Fluoropolymer-based nanohybrids have replaced several commercial materials due to their chemical inertness, better efficacy, and durability.

In this paper, a wrist motion sensing sensor based on the PVDF piezoelectric film is developed. To realize the monitoring of wrist motion signals, this paper designs and manufactures a series of PVDF noninvasive sensors for motion perception. The characteristics of sports dance movements are reflected in the coordination between men and women, and the dance posture and movements must be synchronized with the music according to the level of music rhythm structure. The transfer of center of gravity is the main driving force of sports, and the gait of athletes is related to the transfer of center of gravity.

{"title": "Quantification of the Electromechanical Measurements by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy.", "abstract": "Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is widely used for characterization and exploration of the nanoscale properties of ferroelectrics. However, quantification of the PFM signal is challenging due to the convolution of various extrinsic and intrinsic contributions. Although quantification of the PFM amplitude signal has received considerable attention, quantification of the PFM phase signal has not been addressed. A properly calibrated PFM phase signal can provide valuable information on the sign of the local piezoelectric coefficient-an important and nontrivial issue for emerging ferroelectrics. In this work, two complementary methodologies to calibrate the PFM phase signal are discussed. The first approach is based on using a standard reference sample with well-known independently measured piezoelectric coefficients, while the second approach exploits\u00a0the electrostatic sample-cantilever interactions to determine the parasitic phase offset.

{"title": "Equine shock wave therapy - where are we now?", "abstract": "Over the past three decades, electrohydraulic extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) as a treatment modality for equine orthopaedic disorders has sparked exponential interest among practitioners, but its clinical applications are quickly evolving and a current review highlighting modernised equine clinical use is lacking. The objective of this review is to summarise the most current ESWT technology, evidence for its use, proposed mechanisms of action and clinical applications in horses while also highlighting the areas requiring further investigation. The three ways to generate a shock wave are through electrohydraulic, electromagnetic or piezoelectric mechanisms, but over the last decade, electrohydraulic systems have predominated due to the ability to focus and control a therapeutic waveform. Shock waves' primary physical effect is believed to be via mechanotransduction leading to cellular activation and downstream signalling. Experimentally, ESWT's effects on osseous, connective tissue and wound healing via various mechanisms of action have been reported both in the human and veterinary literature. Clinical trials have investigated ESWT's orthopaedic application including osteoarthritis, thoracolumbar pain, navicular syndrome, tendinopathy and proximal suspensory desmopathy, with its concomitant use with biologics representing an area of active research. Direct ESWT protocol comparisons in terms of long-term efficacy with variables of energy, depth and exposed tissue types are still lacking with evidence-based recommendations being largely anecdotal. Technical advancements to facilitate the safe and judicious use of ESWT include human and equine hearing protection, light sedation and/or patient restraint.

{"title": "Do Merkel complexes initiate mechanical itch?", "abstract": "Itch is a common sensation which is amenable to disabling patients' life under pathological and chronic conditions. Shared assertion easily limits itch to chemical itch, without considering mechanical itch and alloknesis, its pathological counterpart. However, in recent years, our understanding of the mechanical itch pathway, particularly in the central nervous system, has been enhanced. In addition, Merkel complexes, conventionally considered as tactile end organs only responsible for light touch perception due to Piezo2 expressed by both Merkel cells and SA1 A\u03b2-fibres - low threshold mechanical receptors (LTMRs) -, have recently been identified as modulators of mechanical itch. However, the tactile end organs responsible for initiating mechanical itch remain unexplored. The consensus is that some LTMRs, either SA1 A\u03b2- or A\u2202- and C-, are cutaneous initiators of mechanical itch, even though they are not self-sufficient to finely detect and encode light mechanical stimuli into sensory perceptions, which depend on the entire hosting tactile end organ. Consequently, to enlighten our understanding of mechanical itch initiation, this article discusses the opportunity to consider Merkel complexes as potential tactile end organs responsible for initiating mechanical itch, under both healthy and pathological conditions. Their unsuspected modulatory abilities indeed show that they are tuned to detect and encode light mechanical stimuli leading to mechanical itch, especially as they host not only SA1 A\u03b2-LTMRs but also A\u2202- and C-fibres.", "journal": "Experimental dermatology", "date": "2022-10-09", "authors": ["AdelineBataille-Savattier", "ChristelleLe Gall-Ianotto", "NicolasLebonvallet", "LaurentMisery", "MatthieuTalagas"], "doi": "10.1111/exd.14685"}
{"title": "Assessment of a three-axis on-rotor sensing performance for machining process monitoring: a case study.", "abstract": "Online monitoring of cutting conditions is essential in intelligent manufacturing, and vibrations are one of the most effective signals in monitoring machining conditions. Generally, traditional wired accelerometers should be installed on a motionless or stable platform, such as a tool holder or lathe bed, to sense vibrations. Such installation methods would cause the signals to suffer more serious noise interferences and a low signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in less sensitivity to valuable information. Therefore, this study developed a novel three-axis wireless on-rotor sensing (ORS) system for monitoring the turning process. The Micro Electromechanical System (MEMS) accelerometer sensor node can be mounted on a rotating workpiece or spindle rotor and is more sensitive in detecting the vibrations of the entire rotor system without any modification of the lathe system and interference in the cutting procedure. The processor, data acquisition, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0+ modules were developed and debugged to cooperate with a piezoelectric triaxial accelerometer, with a vibration amplitude not larger than \u00b1\u200916\u00a0g. A series of turning tests were conducted and the results were compared with those from the commercial wired accelerometers, which proved that the ORS system can measure the vibration signal of the rotor system more effectively and sensitively than wired accelerometers, thus demonstrating the accurate monitoring of machining parameters.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-10-08", "authors": ["ChunLi", "ZhexiangZou", "KaiboLu", "HongjunWang", "RobertCattley", "Andrew DBall"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-21415-w\n10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.10.056\n10.1007/s00170-020-06005-2\n10.1007/s10845-019-01511-x\n10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2004.11.028\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.07.017\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.113147\n10.1016/j.procir.2016.05.072\n10.1007/s00542-020-04768-y\n10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.07.001\n10.1016/j.cirp.2018.04.115\n10.1016/j.measurement.2020.108034\n10.3390/s16030269\n10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2010.10.001\n10.1016/j.cirp.2017.04.025\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.12.033\n10.1007/s00170-019-04224-w\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.223.591\n10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2007.11.002\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107123"}

Hence, we focused on the construction of a novel ternary-layer NF membrane through \"electrospinning Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) (as bottom layer)\", \"generating middle layer by electrospinning PVDF along with, the implementation cross-linking after electrospraying Sodium Alginate\", and \"synthesizing Polyamide (as top layer) through interfacial polymerization\".

We further implemented our grafts with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents to allow the in-vitro monitoring of the TEVG's remodeling process.\nBiodegradable polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) was electrospun onto a non-degradable polyvinylidene fluoride scaffold and molded along with copolymer-reinforced fibrin hydrogel and human arterial cells.

{"title": "", "abstract": "Mechanical nociception is an evolutionarily conserved sensory process required for the survival of living organisms. Previous studies have revealed much about the neural circuits and sensory molecules in mechanical nociception, but the cellular mechanisms adopted by nociceptors in force detection remain elusive. To address this issue, we study the mechanosensation of a fly larval nociceptor (class IV da neurons, c4da) using a customized mechanical device. We find that c4da are sensitive to mN-scale forces and make uniform responses to the forces applied at different dendritic regions. Moreover, c4da showed a greater sensitivity to localized forces, consistent with them being able to detect the poking of sharp objects, such as wasp ovipositor. Further analysis reveals that high morphological complexity, mechanosensitivity to lateral tension and possibly also active signal propagation in dendrites contribute to the sensory features of c4da. In particular, we discover that Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26, two key mechanosensory molecules, make differential but additive contributions to the mechanosensitivity of c4da. In all, our results provide updates into understanding how c4da process mechanical signals at the cellular level and reveal the contributions of key molecules.\nBeing able to sense harm is essential for survival. Animals have to be able to tell the difference between a gentle touch and a dangerous pressure. They do this using nerve cells called mechanical nociceptors which switch on when the body feels a potentially painful pressure, such as a sharp object poking the skin. Once activated, the nerves send outputs to other parts of the central nervous system which coordinate the motions needed to escape the source of the pain. One popular model to understand harm-sensing is the larvae of fruit flies which automatically roll back and forth when they sense the pointy sting of a wasp. This process is initiated by sensory nerve cells called class IV dendritic arborization neurons (or c4da for short) which sit under the fly\u2019s skin. However, it is still not fully understood how these mechanical nociceptors detect the poking forces of the wasp\u2019s tail. To investigate, Liu, Wu et al. built a device that could poke sections of fly larvae under a microscope so they could see how different types of pressure affected the activity and shape of c4da cells. This revealed that c4da nerves were most sensitive to sharp objects that illicit a more localized force, which may explain why these cells are so good at responding to wasp attacks. Further analysis showed that this sensitivity was due to the high number of branches, or dendrites, protruding from the body of c4da nerves. Liu, Wu et al. discovered that the dendrites were coated in a touch-sensitive protein that can sense and amplify both squashing and pulling, resulting in a signal that activates c4da nerves to send outputs to other parts of the central nervous system. This mechanism increases the likelihood that a c4da cell will detect a mechanical pressure even if it is far away from the body of the nerve. These findings shed light on how sensory cells like c4da are optimized to carry out specific roles. This could be important for understanding other nerve systems which sense mechanical pressure, such as those involved in touch or auditory processes. However, further work is needed to see whether the molecules and mechanism identified by Liu, Wu et al. are also present in humans.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2022-10-07", "authors": ["ZhenLiu", "Meng-HuaWu", "Qi-XuanWang", "Shao-ZhenLin", "Xi-QiaoFeng", "BoLi", "XinLiang"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.76574\n10.1016/j.bpj.2021.06.001\n10.7554/eLife.26016\n10.1073/pnas.1706162114\n10.1038/nrm2595\n10.1038/nn.2581\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4179-07.2007\n10.1093/genetics/148.3.1159\n10.1038/nmeth.3125\n10.7554/eLife.29089\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.10.034\n10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00160-0\n10.1242/dev.02666\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.10.020\n10.1073/pnas.1606537113\n10.7554/eLife.33660\n10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.025\n10.1073/pnas.2009224117\n10.1038/nn.4580\n10.1016/j.mcn.2007.04.001\n10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.029\n10.1016/j.neuron.2007.10.031\n10.1017/CBO9781139171731\n10.1088/0960-1317/24/3/035017\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.06.034\n10.1038/nature10801\n10.1002/jbm.a.10028\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044348\n10.1016/j.neuron.2006.03.042\n10.1126/science.abk2432\n10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.078\n10.1038/s41586-019-1499-2\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2950-18.2019\n10.1083/jcb.201006074\n10.1016/j.cub.2014.10.038\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9897\n10.1038/nature14297\n10.1371/journal.pone.0078704\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1073/pnas.1413656111\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1988.tb33415.x\n10.1007/BF00215114\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.10.030\n10.7554/eLife.12959\n10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.037\n10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.019\n10.1101/2021.12.16.473007\n10.1515/rams-2018-0038\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.08.070\n10.1186/s13059-017-1382-0\n10.1038/nature09576\n10.1038/nature11685\n10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.068\n10.1016/j.cub.2009.12.057\n10.1126/science.1254229"}

Previous studies suggest that bioelectric signals facilitate the process of angiogenesis. Owing to their biomimetic electroactivity, piezoelectric membranes have garnered substantial interest in the field of guided bone regeneration. Nevertheless, the knowledge of their influence due to varying surface potentials on the progression of angiogenesis remains ambiguous. Therefore, we proposed the preparation of an electroactive material, P(VDF-TrFE), and investigated its effects on the activity and angiogenic functions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

However, the controlled growth of amino acid nanostructures is still challenging due to the limited understanding of their growth mechanism. Herein, we base on the Stranski-Krastanov (S-K) growth mode and propose a mechanism for the growth of ordered amino acid array structures via physical vapor deposition. The growth of vertical valine sheet arrays is examined by changing the substrate temperature, chamber pressure, and source-substrate distance, and a \"layer-plus-sheet\" growth process is revealed. The modified S-K growth mode is applied to fabricate other amino acid nanostructures like leucine and isoleucine. The growth mode not only explains the formation of uniform and controllable morphology of amino acid structures but also leads to the significant enhancement of their piezoelectric properties.

{"title": "A Biocompatible Self-Powered Piezoelectric Poly(vinyl alcohol)-Based Hydrogel for Diabetic Wound Repair.", "abstract": "Acute and chronic wounds, caused by trauma, tumors, diabetic foot ulcers, etc., are usually difficult to heal, while applying exogenous electrical stimulation to enhance the endogenous electric field in the wound has been proven to significantly accelerate wound healing. However, traditional electrical stimulation devices require an additional external power supply, making them poor in portability and comfort. In this work, a self-powered piezoelectric poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite hydrogel is constructed by establishing a distinctive preparation process of freezing/thawing-solvent replacement-annealing-swelling. The hydrogen bonding in the hydrogel is remarkably enhanced by the annealing-swelling process, which is stronger between PVA/PVDF molecules than that between PVA molecules, promoting transformation of the \u03b1-phase into the electroactive \u03b2-phase PVDF and facilitating formation of a much more crystalline structure with high cross-linking density. Hence, an obvious piezoelectric response with high piezoelectric coefficient and electrical signal output with superior stability and sensitivity and excellent mechanical strength and stretchability was achieved for hydrogels. PVA/PVDF composite hydrogels with good cytocompatibility significantly promote proliferation, migration, and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors of fibroblasts, possibly through activating the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. In a wound model of diabetic rats, piezoelectric hydrogels could not only rapidly attract wound exudate and maintain the wet environment of the wound bed but also convert the mechanical energy generated by rats' physical activities into electrical energy, so as to provide local piezoelectric stimulation to the wound bed evenly and symmetrically in real time. Such an effect significantly promotes re-epithelialization and collagen deposition and increases angiogenesis and secretion of growth factors in wound tissue. Besides, it regulates the macrophage phenotype from the M1 subtype (pro-inflammatory subtype) to the M2 subtype (anti-inflammatory subtype) and reduces the expression levels of inflammatory factors, thus accelerating wound healing. The development of such a novel piezoelectric hydrogel provides new therapeutic strategies for chronic wound healing.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-10-05", "authors": ["LiminWang", "YaruYu", "XiaowenZhao", "ZhenZhang", "XuelingYuan", "JinlongCao", "WeikunMeng", "LinYe", "WeiLin", "GuanglinWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c13026"}

As a result, continuous work on conventional semiconductor-process-compatible ferroelectric memory devices such as ferroelectric field-effect transistors, ferroelectric random-access memory, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) cell capacitors is ongoing. To operate high-performance computing devices, high-density, high-speed, and reliable memory devices such as DRAMs are required. Consequently, considerable attention has been devoted to the enhanced high dielectric constant and reduced equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of DRAM cell capacitors. The advancement of ferroelectric hafnia has enabled the development of various devices, such as ferroelectric memories, piezoelectric sensors, and energy harvesters. Therefore, in this review, we focus the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between ferroelectric orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, where we can achieve a high dielectric constant and thereby reduce the EOT. We also present the role of the MPB in perovskite and fluorite structures as well as the history of the MPB phase. We also address the different approaches for achieving the MPB phase in a hafnia material system. Subsequently, we review the critical issues in DRAM technology using hafnia materials. Finally, we present various applications of the hafnia material system near the MPB, such as memory, sensors, and energy harvesters.", "journal": "Nano convergence", "date": "2022-10-02", "authors": ["MinhyunJung", "VenkateswarluGaddam", "SanghunJeon"], "doi": "10.1186/s40580-022-00333-7\n10.1063/5.0037617\n10.1063/1.3629784\n10.1038/nature06459\n10.1143/JJAP.39.5156\n10.1063/1.3634052\n10.1109/TED.2019.2961208\n10.1109/LED.2019.2955198\n10.1002/adma.201404531\n10.1039/C7TC01200D\n10.1021/acsami.8b15576\n10.1557/mrs.2018.95\n10.1039/D1NR02272E\n10.1088/1361-6528/ac1716\n10.1038/s41586-022-04425-6\n10.1109/LED.2021.3059901\n10.1109/TED.2021.3131403\n10.1038/am.2015.57\n10.1016/j.mser.2010.12.001\n10.1021/cm2002572\n10.1002/adma.200701085\n10.1021/am506677e\n10.1109/TED.2020.2998444\n10.1016/j.mee.2009.03.045\n10.1143/JPSJ.7.12\n10.1143/JPSJ.8.615\n10.1143/JJAP.37.L985\n10.1080/00150190600732694\n10.1557/mrc.2018.175\n10.1109/LED.2021.3075082\n10.5573/JSTS.2021.21.1.062\n10.1016/j.sse.2020.107914\n10.1063/5.0050535\n10.1109/LED.2021.3055140\n10.1109/TED.2021.3061963\n10.1063/1.4902179\n10.1063/1.4916707\n10.3390/s100301935\n10.1002/aelm.201800522\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153905\n10.1109/TED.2022.3165167\n10.1186/s40580-014-0024-4\n10.1021/acsami.7b00776\n10.1021/acsaelm.1c00792\n10.1039/D0TC01695K\n10.1088/1361-6633/ab49d6\n10.1021/acsami.5b04303\n10.1021/nl302049k\n10.1002/adem.202000791\n10.1063/1.4973928\n10.1109/TED.2013.2265326\n10.1109/LED.2015.2438433\n10.1109/TED.2020.2985635\n10.1021/acsami.1c16873\n10.1021/acsaelm.0c01065\n10.1038/s41928-019-0305-3\n10.1186/s40580-020-00230-x\n10.1186/s40580-022-00321-x\n10.1186/s40580-021-00289-0\n10.1186/s40580-018-0163-0\n10.1088/2058-8585/ab8073\n10.1038/s41528-019-0051-7\n10.1149/1.3633656"}

{"title": "Maximum power point tracking for a multi-layered piezoelectric heel charger with a levered mechanism toward impact-based energy harvesting.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric footstep energy harvester does not always work at its maximum power point when the external load is fixed, as the optimal load changes when the walking excitation alters. Thus, the harvesting efficiency is downgraded largely in real-life scenarios compared to in-lab experiments and theoretical or numerical predictions due to the mismatch between the actual load and the optimal load. To address this issue, the concept of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is investigated in this paper and the circuit design is implemented for a multi-layered levered piezoelectric footstep energy harvester (heel charger). The proposed event-driven MPPT circuit interface with a customized buck converter aims to maximize the power gained from daily walking using the heel charger to power a fixed load, such as smart insole or shoes. The MPPT circuit design is conceptually simulated and then tested with the heel charger to further validate if it works at its maximum power point when the frequency of the input excitation alters. Results show that the extracted power from the heel charger connected to a fixed resistance load with MPPT implementation is improved up to 300% compared to the one without MPPT implementation in simulation and up to 180% in the experiment when connected to a fixed load. The difference between simulation and experimental results is due to the optimization of using voltage sources as the heel charger and the control signals (pulse width modulation) from the microcontroller in the simulation.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2022-10-02", "authors": ["RuiHua", "SebastianMarin-Quiros", "Harsha KalkunteMohan", "YaWang"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0091254"}
{"title": "A piezoelectric rotatable magnetic force microscope system in a 10\u00a0T cryogen-free superconducting magnet.", "abstract": "We constructed a piezoelectric rotatable magnetic force microscope (MFM) that works in a 10\u00a0T cryogen-free superconducting magnet. The piezoelectric tube is deformed tangentially and drives a bearing under the inertial drive principle so the MFM head can obtain rotary movement. Due to the novel piezoelectric design, the MFM can be hung underneath the heat sink via a soft spring, and it can be rotated in a cryogen-free superconducting magnet so that the direction of the magnetic field can be changed from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 continuously. The system functions in magnetic fields of up to 10\u00a0T in any direction relative to the tip-sample geometry. This is the first piezoelectric rotatable MFM ever reported. Using this homemade rotatable MFM, we imaged the structure of magnetic tracks on a commercial videotape. When the magnetic field angle changes from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, the magnetic moments on the tape and probe tip also rotate. A magnetic field strength of 0.8\u00a0T parallel to the sample surface is required to fully rotate the magnetic moment of the tip we used, but 0.8\u00a0T is not enough to fully rotate the magnetic moment of the sample. The piezoelectric rotatable MFM is expected to be widely used to study the anisotropy of magnetic materials due to its superiority in obtaining the same high field in and out of plane (compared with a vector magnet) as well as in maintaining the same scan area precisely (compared with a mechanical rotatable MFM, especially for atomic-scale scan areas).", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2022-10-02", "authors": ["KuiXiang", "YubinHou", "JihaoWang", "JingZhang", "QiyuanFeng", "ZeWang", "WenjieMeng", "QingyouLu", "YalinLu"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0100662"}

The valveless chamber is designed eccentrically to promote the tendency of positive flow and diminish the backflow. Numerical simulation and analyses are carried out to optimize the chamber design, and the experiments with liquid in different viscosity, radius of the vibrating block, and the influence of gravity are conducted.

The layered structures of semiconductors are often used in intelligent devices, and the PN junction plays an important role for performance improvement. Due to the migration and diffusion of carriers, the electric potential and concentration of the carrier are graded distribution in the PN junction. This inhomogeneity results in the reflection and transmission of coupled waves, which are the complex of multiple physical fields including the mechanical, electric, and carrier fields. The state transfer equation method is used to obtain the transfer matrix of the PN junction, and the reflection and transmission waves under the plane strain situation are evaluated numerically. The energy fluxes of the reflection and transmission waves are estimated and used to validate the numerical results by the check of energy conservation. It is found that PN junction effects hinder the wave propagation and drastically enhance the reflection ability of the interface, especially, on the coupled carrier waves, and thus are very important and cannot be ignored for the wave propagation problem. The influences of external applied stress and bias electric field are also discussed.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2022-10-02", "authors": ["ZiboWei", "PeijunWei", "ChunyuXu", "XiaoGuo"], "doi": "10.1121/10.0014179"}

{"title": "Flapping dynamics of an inverted flag behind a cylinder.", "abstract": "The inverted flag configuration is inspired by biological structures (e.g. leaves on a tree branch), showing rich dynamics associated with instabilities at lower flow speeds than the regular flag configuration. In the biological counterpart, the arrangement of leaves and twigs on foliage creates a complex interacting environment that promotes certain dynamic fluttering modes. While enabling a large amplitude response for reduced flow speeds is advantageous in emerging fields such as energy harvesting, still, little is known about the consequence of such interactions. In this work, we numerically study the canonical bio-inspired problem of the flow-structural interaction of a 2D inverted flag behind a cylindrical bluff body, mimicking a leaf behind a tree branch, to investigate its distinct fluttering regimes. The separation distance between the cylinder and flag is gradually modified to determine the effective distance beyond which small-amplitude or large-amplitude flapping occurs for different flow velocities. It is shown that the flag exhibits a periodic large amplitude-low frequency response mode when the cylinder is placed at a sufficiently large distance in front of the flag. At smaller distances, when the flag is within the immediate wake of the cylinder, the flag undergoes a high frequency-small amplitude response. Finally, the flag's piezoelectric power harvesting capability is investigated numerically and experimentally for varying geometrical and electrical parameters associated with these two conditions. Two separate optimal response modes with the highest energy output have also been identified.", "journal": "Bioinspiration & biomimetics", "date": "2022-10-01", "authors": ["OluwafemiOjo", "EetuKohtanen", "AojiaJiang", "JacobBrody", "AlperErturk", "KouroshShoele"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-3190/ac96b9"}

{"title": "The emerging roles of piezo1 channels in animal models of multiple sclerosis.", "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Its pathogenesis is quite complex: Accumulated evidence suggests that biochemical signals as well as mechanical stimuli play important roles in MS. In both patients and animal models of MS, brain viscoelasticity is reduced during disease progression. Piezo mechanosensitive channels are recently discovered, and their three-dimensional structure has been solved. Both the membrane dome mechanism and the membrane footprint hypothesis have been proposed to explain their mechanosensitivity. While membrane-mediated forces alone appear to be sufficient to induce Piezo gating, tethers attached to the membrane or to the channel itself also seem to play a role. Current research indicates that Piezo1 channels play a key role in multiple aspects of MS pathogenesis. Activation of Piezo1 channels in axon negatively regulates CNS myelination. in addition, the inhibition of Piezo1 in CD4+ T cells and/or T regulatory cells (Treg) attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) symptoms.

{"title": "Theory of Borazine-Derived Nanothreads: Enumeration, Reaction Pathways, and Piezoelectricity.", "abstract": "Nanothreads are one-dimensional macromolecules formed by pressure-induced polymerization along stacks of multiply unsaturated (or highly strained) molecules such as benzene (or cubane). Borazine is isoelectronic to benzene yet with substantial bond polarity, thus motivating a theoretical examination of borazine-derived nanothreads with degrees of saturation of 2, 4, and 6 (defined as the number of four-coordinated boron and nitrogen atoms per borazine formula unit). The energy increases upon going from molecular borazine to degree-2 borazine-derived threads and then decreases for degree-4 and degree-6 nanothreads as more \u03c3 bonds are formed. With the constraint of no more than two borazine formula units within the repeat unit of the framework's bonding topology, there are only 13 fully saturated (i.e., degree-6) borazine-derived nanothreads that avoid energetically costly homopolar bonds (as compared to more than 50 such candidates for benzene-derived threads). Only two of these are more stable than borazine. Hypothetical pathways from molecular borazine to these two degree-6 borazine-derived nanothreads are discussed. This relative paucity of outcomes may assist in kinetic control of reaction products. Beyond the high mechanical strength also predicted for carbon-based threads, properties such as piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity may be accessible to the polar lattice of borazine-derived nanothreads, with intriguing prospects for expression in these extremely thin yet rigid objects.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2022-09-28", "authors": ["TaoWang", "En-ShiXu", "BoChen", "RoaldHoffmann", "Vincent HCrespi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.2c02778"}

However, to obtain an efficient nanoparticle-decorated membrane, the compatibility of nanomaterials remains a challenge. Hydrophilic carboxylated covalent organic frameworks (COF-COOH) might be expected to avoid the drawbacks of aggregation and easy shedding of inorganic materials caused by the poor interfacial compatibility. Herein, a highly compatible dip-coating strategy was proposed for the superhydrophilic modification of polyvinylidene fluoride membrane via COF-COOH integrated with dopamine. COF-COOH together with polydopamine nanoparticles were uniformly and stably attached to the membrane due to the high interfacial compatibility, constructing a coating with rough hierarchical nanostructures and abundant carboxyl groups. The synergistic effects of multiscale structures and chemical groups endow the membrane with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity, the water contact angle decreased from 123 to 15\u00b0, and the underwater oil contact angle increased from 132 to 162\u00b0.

{"title": "Modulating the Electromechanical Response of Bio-Inspired Amino Acid-Based Architectures through Supramolecular Co-Assembly.", "abstract": "Supramolecular packing dictates the physical properties of bio-inspired molecular assemblies in the solid state. Yet, modulating the stacking modes of bio-inspired supramolecular assemblies remains a challenge and the structure-property relationship is still not fully understood, which hampers the rational design of molecular structures to fabricate materials with desired properties. Herein, we present a co-assembly strategy to modulate the supramolecular packing of N-terminally capped alanine-based assemblies (Ac-Ala) by changing the amino acid chirality and mixing with a nonchiral bipyridine derivative (BPA). The co-assembly induced distinct solid-state stacking modes determined by X-ray crystallography, resulting in significantly enhanced electromechanical properties of the assembly architectures. The highest rigidity was observed after the co-assembly of racemic Ac-Ala with a bipyridine coformer (BPA/Ac-DL-Ala), which exhibited a measured Young's modulus of 38.8 GPa. Notably, BPA crystallizes in a centrosymmetric space group, a condition that is broken when co-crystallized with Ac-L-Ala and Ac-D-Ala to induce a piezoelectric response. Enantiopure co-assemblies of BPA/Ac-D-Ala and BPA/Ac-L-Ala showed density functional theory-predicted piezoelectric responses that are remarkably higher than the other assemblies due to the increased polarization of their supramolecular packing. This is the first report of a centrosymmetric-crystallizing coformer which increases the single-crystal piezoelectric response of an electrically active bio-inspired molecular assembly.

{"title": "A Comparison Between Piezosurgery and Conventional Osteotomies in Rhinoplasty on Post-Operative Oedema and Ecchymosis: A Systematic Review.", "abstract": "Piezosurgery use has become increasingly prevalent in osteotomies. Piezoelectric ultrasound waves can cut bone effectively, and some studies have shown reduced post-operative morbidities compared to conventional osteotomies. Oedema and ecchymosis are common complications of rhinoplasty and can impact patient satisfaction, wound healing, and recovery. We aim to provide an up-to-date comparison of post-operative oedema and ecchymosis in piezosurgery and conventional osteotomies. A literature search was conducted using the following online libraries; Pubmed, Cochrane, Science Direct, and ISRCTN (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number). English publications between 2015 and 2020 were included. A systematic review was completed, and a comparison of oedema and ecchymosis in piezosurgery and conventional osteotomies was examined alongside other outcomes such as pain, mucosal injury, and surgery time. Eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met our criteria with a combined total of 440 patients: 191 male and 249 female. Piezosurgery had statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) reduction in short-term oedema compared to conventional osteotomies in 75% of the papers included, and in 50% this persisted across the whole follow-up period. Similarly, ecchymosis scoring was initially statistically lower (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in piezosurgery in 87.5% of the RCTs, and in 75% this persisted across the whole follow-up period. A reduction in pain (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and mucosal injury (p\u2009<\u20090.05) was also seen in piezoelectric osteotomies. The length of surgery time varied. Piezoelectric osteotomies reduce oedema and ecchymosis compared to conventional osteotomies, in addition to improving pain and mucosal injury. However, disadvantages such as length of surgery time and cost have been reported. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

This study was to investigate the effect of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) on pain and swelling after flapless computer guided implant site preparation utilizing a novel surgical guide designed to be used with piezotome.\nA total of thirty patients were enrolled in this study having history of bilateral extractions in the lower molar area not less than 6 months ago. One side from each patient was randomly selected for the intervention group to receive LLLT immediately after insertion of bendable one-piece implant (Rough-B Implant, Monoimplant, Novodent SA, Swizerland) using diode laser with a wavelength of 980 nm and a 100 mW energy for 1 minute. The other side received placebo LLLT and was regarded as a control group. Piezo-surgical implant site preparation was done on both sides using a third generation piezotome (Surgic Touch, Guilin Woodpecker Medical Instrument Co., Ltd, China). Pain and swelling scores were measured by utilizing a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and a graded swelling scale respectively. The measurements were recorded on both sides after 2, 6 and 24 hour of the day of surgery then at 2, 3, 4 and 7 days post-surgically.\nIn general, the overall scores were ranging from very mild to mild degree of pain and swelling. Females reported significantly higher pain score than males with a mean score of 20.3 \u00b1 5.1 for females and 14.7 \u00b1 3.1 for males (P < .05). Swelling showed no statistically significant results between females and males (P> .05). Pain scores were found to be significantly lower in the LLLT side after 2, 6, 24, 48 hour of implant insertion (P < .05). Moreover, Sweling scores were also found to be significantly lower in the LLLT side after 2, 6, 24, 48 hour, and at day 3 of implant insertion (P < .05). However, day 4 and day 7 showed very minimal if any pain and swelling with insignificant differences between the 2 sides (P > .05).\nLLLT was found to be an effective non pharmacological method for relieving pain after implant insertion.

{"title": "The Osteogenic Role of Barium Titanate/Polylactic Acid Piezoelectric Composite Membranes as Guiding Membranes for Bone Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Biopiezoelectric materials have good biocompatibility and excellent piezoelectric properties, and they can generate local currents in vivo to restore the physiological electrical microenvironment of the defect and promote bone regeneration. Previous studies of guided bone regeneration membranes have rarely addressed the point of restoring it, so this study prepared a Barium titanate/Polylactic acid (BT/PLA) piezoelectric composite membrane and investigated its bone-formation, with a view to providing an experimental basis for clinical studies of guided bone tissue regeneration membranes.\nBT/PLA composite membranes with different BT ratio were prepared by solution casting method, and piezoelectric properties were performed after corona polarization treatment. The optimal BT ratio was selected and then subjected to in vitro cytological experiments and in vivo osteogenic studies in rats. The effects on adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the pre-osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1) were investigated. The effect of composite membranes on bone repair of cranial defects in rats was investigated after 4 and 12 weeks.\nThe highest piezoelectric coefficient d33 were obtained when the BT content was 20%, reaching (7.03 \u00b1 0.26) pC/N. The value could still be maintained at (4.47\u00b10.17) pC/N after 12 weeks, meeting the piezoelectric constant range of bone.

The performance of organic film capacitors is determined by polymer materials, so it is crucial to develop a polymer composite with high energy storage density and high charge-discharge efficiency.

In this study, effects of long-term ozone exposure on properties and performance of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) UF membrane reinforced by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layer were systematically investigated. The exposure intensities were designed to simulate ozone exposure at 0.1\u00a0mg/L for 0.5-5 years. Chemical composition analysis suggested that the hydrophilic additives, such as possibly polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), was gradually degraded and released from the membrane, whereas the PVDF matrix exhibited fairly good ozone resistance. Ozonation resulted in increase of pore size and decrease of surface hydrophilicity, which can be attributed to oxidation and dislodgement of hydrophilic additives. Accordingly, long-term ozonation led to moderate changes in performance factors, including increase of membrane permeability by 34%, decrease of retention ability by 21.8%, increase of organic fouling propensity. It is worth noting that membrane tensile strength suffered substantial decrease after ozonation, probably due to ozonation of the PET support layer. Overall, it seems that the PVDF functional layer exhibited good ozone resistance, but the PET support layer was the Achilles' heel of the reinforced PVDF membrane for integrating with pre-ozonation.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2022-09-25", "authors": ["KaiLi", "WeihuaXu", "GangWen", "ZhipengZhou", "MinHan", "ShujiaZhang", "TinglinHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136520"}

{"title": "Modeling of core-shell magneto-electric nanoparticles for biomedical applications: Effect of composition, dimension, and magnetic field features on magnetoelectric response.", "abstract": "The recent development of core-shell nanoparticles which combine strain coupled magnetostrictive and piezoelectric phases, has attracted a lot of attention due to their ability to yield strong magnetoelectric effect even at room temperature, thus making them a promising tool to enable biomedical applications. To fully exploit their potentialities and to adapt their use to in vivo applications, this study analyzes, through a numerical approach, their magnetoelectric behavior, shortly quantified by the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient (\u03b1ME), thus providing an important milestone for the characterization of the magnetoelectric effect at the nanoscale. In view of recent evidence showing that \u03b1ME is strongly affected by both the applied magnetic field DC bias and AC frequency, this study implements a nonlinear model, based on magnetic hysteresis, to describe the responses of two different core-shell nanoparticles to various magnetic field excitation stimuli. The proposed model is also used to evaluate to which extent realistic variables such as core diameter and shell thickness affect the electric output. Results prove that \u03b1ME of 80 nm cobalt ferrite-barium titanate (CFO-BTO) nanoparticles with a 60:40 ratio is equal to about 0.28 V/cm\u2219Oe corresponding to electric fields up to about 1000 V/cm when a strong DC bias is applied. However, the same electric output can be obtained even in absence of DC field with very low AC fields, by exploiting the hysteretic characteristics of the same composites. The analysis of core and shell dimension is as such to indicate that, to maximize \u03b1ME, larger core diameter and thinner shell nanoparticles should be preferred. These results, taken together, suggest that it is possible to tune magnetoelectric nanoparticles electric responses by controlling their composition and their size, thus opening the opportunity to adapt their structure on the specific application to pursue.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["SerenaFiocchi", "EmmaChiaramello", "AlessandraMarrella", "GiuliaSuarato", "MartaBonato", "MartaParazzini", "PaoloRavazzani"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0274676\n10.3390/nano12071049\n10.1038/nature05023\n10.1016/j.mtbio.2021.100149\n10.1002/wnan.1781\n10.2217/nnm-2017-0080\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c01588\n10.1038/s41598-022-12303-4\n10.1038/ncomms2717\n10.1126/sciadv.abc4189\n10.1007/s13311-021-01071-0\n10.2217/nnm-2017-0300\n10.1038/srep45663\n10.1038/srep20867\n10.1038/srep32019\n10.1002/adhm.202100695\n10.1007/978-3-030-03137-4\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.05.019\n10.2217/nnm.15.52\n10.1016/j.nano.2020.102337"}
{"title": "Towards breath sensors that are self-powered by design.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials are widely used to generate electric charge from mechanical deformation or vice versa. These strategies are increasingly common in implantable medical devices, where sensing must be done on small scales. In the case of a flow rate sensor, a sensor's energy harvesting rate could be mapped to that flow rate, making it 'self-powered by design (SPD)'. Prior fluids-based SPD work has focused on turbulence-driven resonance and has been largely empirical. Here, we explore the possibility of sub-resonant SPD flow sensing in a human airway. We present a physical model of piezoelectric sensing/harvesting in the airway, which we validated with a benchtop experiment.

{"title": "Nucleus size and its effect on nucleosome stability in living cells.", "abstract": "DNA architectural proteins play a major role in organization of chromosomal DNA in living cells by packaging it into chromatin, whose spatial conformation is determined by an intricate interplay between the DNA-binding properties of architectural proteins and physical constraints applied to the DNA by a tight nuclear space. Yet, the exact effects of the nucleus size on DNA-protein interactions and chromatin structure currently remain obscure. Furthermore, there is even no clear understanding of molecular mechanisms responsible for the nucleus size regulation in living cells. To find answers to these questions, we developed a general theoretical framework based on a combination of polymer field theory and transfer-matrix calculations, which showed that the nucleus size is mainly determined by the difference between the surface tensions of the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as well as the osmotic pressure exerted by cytosolic macromolecules on the nucleus. In addition, the model demonstrated that the cell nucleus functions as a piezoelectric element, changing its electrostatic potential in a size-dependent manner. This effect has been found to have a profound impact on stability of nucleosomes, revealing a previously unknown link between the nucleus size and chromatin structure.

{"title": "", "abstract": "A protocol for successfully depositing [001] textured, 2\u22123 \u00b5m thick films of Al0.75Sc0.25N, is proposed. The procedure relies on the fact that sputtered Ti is [001]-textured \u03b1-phase (hcp). Diffusion of nitrogen ions into the \u03b1-Ti film during reactive sputtering of Al0.75,Sc0.25N likely forms a [111]-oriented TiN intermediate layer. The lattice mismatch of this very thin film with Al0.75Sc0.25N is ~3.7%, providing excellent conditions for epitaxial growth. In contrast to earlier reports, the Al0.75Sc0.25N films prepared in the current study are Al-terminated. Low growth stress (<100 MPa) allows films up to 3 \u00b5m thick to be deposited without loss of orientation or decrease in piezoelectric coefficient. An advantage of the proposed technique is that it is compatible with a variety of substrates commonly used for actuators or MEMS, as demonstrated here for both Si wafers and D263 borosilicate glass.

{"title": "3D-Printable Piezoelectric Composite Sensors for Acoustically Adapted Guided Ultrasonic Wave Detection.", "abstract": "Commercially available photopolymer resins can be combined with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) micrometer size piezoelectric particles to form 3D-printable suspensions that solidify under UV light. This in turn makes it possible to realize various non-standard sensor geometries which might bring benefits, such as increased piezoelectric output in specific conditions and less interference with incoming waves due to better acoustical adaptation compared to solid PZT ceramics. However, it is unclear whether piezoelectric composite materials are suitable for guided ultrasonic wave (GUW) detection, which is crucial for structural health monitoring (SHM) in different applications. In this study, thin piezoelectric composite sensors are tape casted, solidified under UV light, covered with electrodes, polarized in a high electric field and adhesively bonded onto an isotropic aluminum waveguide. This approach helps to demonstrate the capabilities of tape casting's freedom to manufacture geometrically differently shaped, thin piezoelectric composite sensors for GUW detection. In an experimental study, thin two-dimensional piezoelectric composite sensors demonstrate successful detection of GUW for frequency-thickness products of up to 0.5 MHz mm. An analytical calculation of the maximum and minimum amplitudes for the ratio of the wavelength and the sensor length in wave propagation direction shows good agreement with the sensor-recorded signals. The output of the piezoelectric composite sensors and occurring reflections as measure for wave interactions are compared to commercial piezoelectric discs to evaluate their performance.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["ThomasRoloff", "RytisMitkus", "Jann NiklasLion", "MichaelSinapius"], "doi": "10.3390/s22186964\n10.1002/9780470612071\n10.1007/978-3-319-49715-0\n10.1016/j.ultras.2007.10.008\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/7/075017\n10.1002/stc.2171\n10.1017/CBO9781107273610\n10.1098/rspa.1917.0008\n10.1115/IMECE2004-60929\n10.1063/5.0048444\n10.1016/j.coco.2021.100937\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.06.048\n10.3390/s19194078\n10.1002/adem.201700743\n10.1109/ISAF.2013.6748696\n10.18494/SAM.2016.1333\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119307\n10.1106/8BFB-GC8P-XQ47-YCQ0\n10.1007/978-3-662-55884-3\n10.1115/SMASIS2020-2287\n10.1115/SMASIS2021-68029\n10.3390/ecsa-8-11308\n10.1007/978-3-319-30084-9_7\n10.2514/6.2007-2303\n10.1177/1045389X14557506\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.11.008\n10.1007/s11340-011-9503-2\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/6/037"}
{"title": "Analysis of a Clapping Vibration Energy Harvesting System in a Rotating Magnetic Field.", "abstract": "This technical note proposes a clapping vibration energy harvesting system (CVEH system) installed in a rotating system. This device includes a rotating wheel, a drive shaft that rotates the wheel, and a double elastic steel sheet fixed on the drive shaft. One of the free ends of the steel is fixed with a magnet, and the free end of the other elastic steel is fixed with a PZT patch. We also install an array of magnets on the periphery (rim) of the wheel. The rim magnets repulse the magnet on the elastic steel sheet of the transmission shaft, causing the elastic steel to oscillate periodically, and slap the piezoelectric patch installed on the other elastic steel sheet to generate electricity. In this study, the authors' previous study on the voltage output was improved, and the accurate nonlinear natural frequency of the elastic steel was obtained by the dimensional analysis method. By adjusting the rotation speed of the wheel, the precise frequency was controlled to accurately excite the energy harvesting system and obtain the best output voltage. A simple experiment was also performed to correlate with the theoretical model. The voltage and power output efficiencies of the nonlinear frequency to linear frequency excitation of the CVEH system can reach 15.7% and 33.5%, respectively. This study confirms that the clapping VEH system has practical power generation benefits, and verifies that nonlinear frequencies are more effective than linear frequencies to excite the CVEH system to generate electricity.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["Yi-RenWang", "Chao-KangFeng", "Chin-HanCheng", "Pin-TungChen"], "doi": "10.3390/s22186916\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/018\n10.1115/1.2890402\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/2/023001\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa791d\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.12.032\n10.1063/1.4803445\n10.1016/j.egyr.2021.12.073\n10.3390/en13071793\n10.1142/S0219455421501133\n10.3390/s21217364\n10.1007/s11664-021-08910-y\n10.3390/app10020671\n10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3195052\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117479\n10.1007/s00542-022-05279-8"}
{"title": "Calibration of Ultrasonic Transducer Based on Ultrasonic Logging Instrument for Shaft Sinking.", "abstract": "High-precision logging equipment is critical for measuring the borehole diameter and drilling offset in coal mining and petroleum drilling. We propose a module composition and positioning principle for an ultrasonic transducer based on an ultrasonic logging instrument for shaft sinking by drilling (ULISSD) for calculating the reflection distance. The logging distance, which is the primary performance index of a logging system, is determined by using the self-reception sensitivity and error of the ultrasonic transducer in a downhole system. To measure the error between the piezoelectric element of the transducer and the rubber seal of the borehole logging system, we developed an ultrasonic-transducer error-calibration device and a calibration method for a central-air-return-shaft-drilling project. This calibration device can eliminate the inherent error of the transducer and calculate the rate of propagation with high accuracy. The measurement error is reduced by approximately 1.5 mm; thus, the ULISSD measurement accuracy can be effectively improved in central-air-return-shaft drilling.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["MaoyongCao", "XiaoanSi", "HuiZhang", "FengyingMa", "PengJi", "HuiYao"], "doi": "10.3390/s22186867\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.03.074\n10.1155/2020/8529836\n10.1016/j.measurement.2012.08.010\n10.1109/58.4161\n10.1109/58.4165\n10.1080/09349847.2017.1375585\n10.3390/s17061351\n10.1121/1.380869\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2008.08.003\n10.3390/s16081210\n10.1016/j.ultras.2010.05.001\n10.1111/j.1747-1567.1990.tb01130.x\n10.1016/j.measurement.2014.10.017\n10.1016/j.measurement.2013.09.025\n10.1016/j.measurement.2016.05.067\n10.1016/j.measurement.2014.03.011\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.06.018"}

Increasing the duration of electrospinning rendered more electret dipoles in PVDF porous electrospun films, resulting in higher piezoelectric output.

Optically isotropic domains grew, and then optical anisotropy started to increase in the domain to yield spherulite. Double peaks were seen in the time variation of the Vv light scattering intensity caused by the density fluctuation and optical anisotropy, and the Hv light scattering intensity caused by the optical anisotropy started to increase during the second increase in the Vv light scattering intensity. These results suggest the two-stage evolution of the \u03b3-phase spherulites, i.e., the disordered domain grows in the first stage and ordering in the spherulite increases due to the increase in the fraction of the lamellar stacks in the spherulite without a change in the spherulite size in the second stage.

The effect of nanofillers in PVDF nanocomposite films on the structural, phase, and friction and mechanical properties was examined and compared with that of the natural PVDF film. The surface topography of PVDF nanocomposite films was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and correlative imaging (CPEM, combinate AFM and SEM). A selection of 2D CPEM images was used for a detailed study of the spherulitic morphologies (grains size around 6-10 \u03bcm) and surface roughness (value of 50-68 nm).

{"title": "Polyetherimide-Reinforced Smart Inlays for Bondline Surveillance in Composites.", "abstract": "An integrable sensor inlay for monitoring crack initiation and growth inside bondlines of structural carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components is presented. The sensing structures are sandwiched between crack-stopping poly(vinyliden fluoride) (PVDF) and a thin reinforcing polyetherimide (PEI) layer. Good adhesion at all interfaces of the sensor system and to the CFRP material is crucial, as weak bonds can counteract the desired crack-stopping functionality. At the same time, the chosen reinforcing layer must withstand high strains, safely support the metallic measuring grids, and possess outstanding fatigue strength. We show that this robust sensor system, which measures the strain at two successive fronts inside the bondline, allows to recognize cracks in the proximity of the inlay regardless of the mechanical loads. Feasibility is demonstrated by static load tests as well as cyclic long-term fatigue testing for up to 1,000,000 cycles. In addition to pure crack detection, crack distance estimation based on sensor signals is illustrated. The inlay integration process is developed with respect to industrial applicability. Thus, implementation of the proposed system will allow the potential of lightweight CFRP constructions to be better exploited by expanding the possibilities of structural adhesive bonding.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["Chrestenvon der Heide", "JulianSteinmetz", "OliverV\u00f6lkerink", "PatrickMakiela", "ChristianH\u00fchne", "MichaelSinapius", "AndreasDietzel"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14183816\n10.2514/4.103261\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.05.052\n10.2514/3.58825\n10.1016/S1359-835X(00)00131-7\n10.2514/6.2022-1778\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2004.04.016\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.107967\n10.1177/1475921711419994\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025016\n10.12783/SHM2015/27\n10.1007/978-3-031-07254-3_75\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.106954\n10.1080/00218464.2018.1555041\n10.1177/0954410020950071\n10.3390/s21113852\n10.3390/jcs4030138\n10.1080/00218464.2018.1553120\n10.3390/s21196479\n10.3390/jcs5020051"}
{"title": "Analysis of Force Sensing Accuracy by Using SHM Methods on Conventionally Manufactured and Additively Manufactured Small Polymer Parts.", "abstract": "Fabricating complex parts using additive manufacturing is becoming more popular in diverse engineering sectors. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods can be implemented to reduce inspection costs and ensure structural integrity and safety in these parts. In this study, the Surface Response to Excitation (SuRE) method was used to investigate the wave propagation characteristics and load sensing capability in conventionally and additively manufactured ABS parts. For the first set of the test specimens, one conventionally manufactured and three additively manufactured rectangular bar-shaped specimens were prepared. Moreover, four additional parts were also additively manufactured with 30% and 60% infill ratios and 1 mm and 2 mm top surface thicknesses. The external geometry of all parts was the same. Ultrasonic surface waves were generated using three different signals via a piezoelectric actuator bonded to one end of the part. At the other end of each part, a piezoelectric disk was bonded to monitor the response to excitation. It was found that hollow sections inside the 3D printed part slowed down the wave travel. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) were implemented for converting the recorded sensory data into time-frequency images. These image datasets were fed into a convolutional neural network for the estimation of the compressive loading when the load was applied at the center of specimens at five different levels (0 N, 50 N, 100 N, 150 N, and 200 N). The results showed that the classification accuracy was improved when the CWT scalograms were used.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["AlirezaModir", "IbrahimTansel"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14183755\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.126162\n10.1016/j.techfore.2017.01.006\n10.1109/TVCG.2016.2518298\n10.12783/shm2019/32244\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.3390/s20030826\n10.1088/1361-665X/abd4b1\n10.1007/s10845-019-01505-9\n10.3390/automation2030011\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2003)129:5(571)\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2006.06.008\n10.1177/1475921714542890\n10.1016/j.jsv.2005.10.024\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002535\n10.1016/j.asoc.2011.03.014\n10.1109/TIM.2014.2330494\n10.1108/13552511011048922\n10.1007/s13349-017-0252-5\n10.1007/s13349-016-0160-0\n10.1016/j.jsv.2005.11.017\n10.1177/1045389X07077400\n10.3390/s20102778\n10.3390/s20061790\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111509\n10.3390/inventions4010017\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.111347\n10.1111/mice.12263\n10.1007/s42417-022-00553-5\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.12.035\n10.1002/stc.2296\n10.1007/s40436-019-00254-5\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.09.081"}
{"title": "Novel Rubber Composites Based on Copper Particles, Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotubes and Their Hybrid for Stretchable Devices.", "abstract": "New technologies are constantly addressed in the scientific community for updating novel stretchable devices, such as flexible electronics, electronic packaging, and piezo-electric energy-harvesting devices. The device promoted in the present work was found to generate promising ~6V and durability of >0.4 million cycles. This stretchable device was based on rubber composites. These rubber composites were developed by solution mixing of room temperature silicone rubber (RTV-SR) and nanofiller, such as multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and micron-sized copper particles and their hybrid. The hybrid composite consists of 50:50 of both fillers. The mechanical stretchability and compressive modulus of the composites were studied in detail. For example, the compressive modulus was 1.82 MPa (virgin) and increased at 3 per hundred parts of rubber (phr) to 3.75 MPa (MWCNT), 2.2 MPa (copper particles) and 2.75 MPa (hybrid). Similarly, the stretching ability for the composites used in fabricating devices was 148% (virgin) and changes at 3 phr to 144% (MWCNT), 230% (copper particles) and 199% (hybrid). Hence, the hybrid composite was found suitable with optimum stiffness and robust stretching ability to be useful for stretching electronic devices explored in this work. These improved properties were tested for a real-time stretchable device, such as a piezoelectric energy-harvesting device and their improved voltage output and durability were reported. In the end, a series of experiments conducted were summarized and a discussion on the best candidate with higher properties useful for prospective applications was reported.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["VineetKumar", "SirajAzam", "Md NajibAlam", "Won-BeomHong", "Sang-ShinPark"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14183744\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.249\n10.1007/s10854-007-9177-9\n10.1039/c1ee01598b\n10.1007/s12541-011-0151-3\n10.1002/3527607420.ch65\n10.1063/1.336051\n10.1002/adma.201707007\n10.1143/JJAP.15.2041\n10.3390/act5010005\n10.1080/00150193.2015.997146\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.090\n10.1002/adma.201603167\n10.1002/pc.26449\n10.1016/j.mtchem.2019.100232\n10.1002/app.11659\n10.1080/15583724.2019.1673406\n10.3390/nano9010012\n10.5254/rct.15.84850\n10.5254/1.3535229\n10.1002/vnl.21930\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.03.005\n10.1016/S0008-6223(01)00164-6\n10.1002/app.21855\n10.1007/s12633-019-00229-y\n10.1103/RevModPhys.81.109\n10.1016/j.carbon.2006.02.038\n10.1016/j.polymer.2007.06.046\n10.1002/app.44407\n10.1002/pssa.201330051\n10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108698\n10.1016/j.polymer.2020.122455\n10.1021/acsami.6b13956\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2005.02.005\n10.1177/0731684407072522\n10.1063/1.1723792\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.115509\n10.1016/j.polymer.2011.10.063\n10.1038/354056a0\n10.1002/adfm.200700065\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.03.011\n10.1002/app.52503\n10.1002/adma.201103382\n10.1039/C8CS00706C\n10.1039/C8CS00834E\n10.1039/C6RA25350D\n10.1126/science.1121401\n10.1002/pen.21113\n10.5254/rct.13.87903\n10.5254/1.3538492\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.12.005\n10.1002/vnl.21799\n10.1002/pen.760312204\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.01.023\n10.5254/1.3538240\n10.1002/pen.760160512\n10.1088/1742-6596/476/1/012117"}

However, it is still difficult to prepare nanofibers with a large number of functional particle loads on the surface simply and efficiently, which hinders the further improvement of performance and increases the cost. Here, a new one-step strategy was developed to maximize the adhesion of graphene oxide (GO) particle to the surface of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers, which was combined with coaxial surface modification technology and blended electrospinning. The oxygen content on the as-prepared fiber surface increased from 0.44% to 9.32%, showing the maximized GO load. The increased adsorption sites and improved hydrophilicity greatly promoted the adsorption effect of Cr(VI). The adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) was 271 mg/g, and 99% removal rate could be achieved within 2 h for 20 mL Cr(VI) (100 mg/L), which was highly efficient. After five adsorption-desorption tests, the adsorption removal efficiency of the Cr(VI) maintained more than 80%, exhibiting excellent recycling performance.

The results show that the arrangement structure and spacing of gold nanorod dimers greatly affect the local surface plasmon resonance of nanorods, which in turn affects the detection results of biomolecules. Moreover, high concentrations of \"hot spots\" are distributed between both ends and the gap of the gold nanorod dimer, which reflects the strong hybridization of the multiple resonance modes of the nanoparticles. In addition, by simulating and calculating the surface potential distribution of the electrode area and non-electrode area of the biosensor chip, it was found that the biosensor chip with these two areas can enhance the piezoelectric effect of the quartz chip. Under the same simulation conditions, the biochip with a completely electrodeless structure showed a better sensing performance. The sensor chip combining QCM and LSPR can reduce the influence of the metal electrode on the quartz wafer to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of detection. Considering the significant influence of the gold nanorod dimer plasma resonance mode and the significant advantages of the electrodeless biosensor chip, an electrodeless biosensor combining these two technologies is proposed for RNA virus detection and screening, which has potential applications in biomolecular measurement and other related fields.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["JinZhu", "YushanXie"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13091523\n10.1038/s41422-021-00581-y\n10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2021.115353\n10.1039/D0NJ00951B\n10.3390/s110201565\n10.3389/fchem.2021.762638\n10.1021/la800305j\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112850\n10.4236/ojapps.2018.83010\n10.5562/cca3558\n10.3390/bios10100146\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.01.056\n10.1007/BF03215587\n10.1016/j.aca.2019.07.032\n10.3389/fchem.2020.553541\n10.1016/j.trac.2016.03.015\n10.1016/j.bios.2008.10.013\n10.1006/jcis.2001.8060\n10.1021/bm025506j\n10.1016/j.snb.2022.132240\n10.1016/j.snb.2021.131327\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.133864\n10.1016/j.bios.2021.113956\n10.1016/j.bios.2021.113672\n10.1021/acsami.0c08229\n10.1039/D0NR03193C\n10.1039/D0AY01481H\n10.1016/j.bios.2011.04.010\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.10.038\n10.1039/D0AN00308E\n10.1039/D0AN01399D\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03387\n10.1016/j.bios.2010.12.033\n10.1007/s11837-009-0138-z\n10.1021/jp9040666\n10.1021/la0112716\n10.1002/andp.19083300302\n10.1364/OE.19.009213\n10.1021/nn9016235\n10.1021/jp907413n\n10.1021/jp990183f\n10.1364/OPEX.12.002795\n10.1021/nl080872f\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b06519\n10.1021/jp062536y\n10.1021/jp811075u\n10.1039/c2nr30253e"}

A combined beam tri-stable piezoelectric energy harvester (CTPEH) is designed by introducing magnetic force into the combined beam structure. In order to explore the vibration characteristics of CTPEH, a nonlinear magnetic model is obtained based on the magnetic dipole theory, and the dynamic equation of the system is established using the Lagrange theorem and Rayleigh-Ritz theory. The influence of the different magnet distances and excitation conditions on the static bifurcation characteristics and dynamic response characteristics of the system are analyzed by numerical simulation, and the simulation results are validated by the experiments. The research results show that the motion state of the CTPEH system has four transition forms from mono-stable to tri-stable with the change in magnet distance. The tri-stable system has three potential energy curves with different characteristic shapes. The appropriate starting excitation position and excitation frequency can make it easier for the system to realize a large-amplitude response state, thereby improving the output performance of the system.

{"title": "Optimal Design for 3-PSS Flexible Parallel Micromanipulator Based on Kinematic and Dynamic Characteristics.", "abstract": "This paper proposes two optimal design schemes for improving the kinematic and dynamic performance of the 3-PSS flexible parallel micromanipulator according to different application requirements and conditions. Firstly, the workspace, dexterity, frequencies, and driving forces of the mechanism are successively analyzed. Then, a progressive optimization design is carried out, in which the scale parameters of this mechanism are firstly optimized to maximize the workspace, combining the constraints of the minimum global dexterity of the mechanism. Based on the optimized scale parameters, the minimum thickness and the cutting radius of the flexure spherical hinge are further optimized for minimizing the required driving forces, combined with constraints of the minimum first-order natural frequency of the mechanism and the maximum stress of the flexure spherical hinge during the movement of the mechanism. Afterward, a synchronous optimization design is proposed, in which the scale parameters are optimized to maximize the first-order natural frequency of the mechanism, combined with the constraints of a certain inscribed circle of the maximum cross-section of the workspace, the maximum stroke of the selected piezoelectric stages, and the maximum ultimate angular displacement of the flexure spherical hinge. The effectiveness of both optimization methods is verified by the comparison of the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the original and optimized mechanism. The advantage of the progressive optimization method is that both the workspace and the driving forces are optimized and the minimum requirements for global dexterity and first-order natural frequency are ensured. The merit of the synchronous optimization method is that only the scale parameters of the mechanism need to be optimized without changing the structural parameters of the flexible spherical hinge.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["JunRen", "QiliangLi", "HanhaiWu", "QiuyuCao"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13091457\n10.1017/S0263574799001903\n10.1109/3516.809518\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.06.007\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2009.07.006\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2004.07.002\n10.3390/mi13071014\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2016.04.002\n10.1007/s00542-018-3861-y\n10.3390/mi9010015\n10.3901/CJME.2014.0929.155\n10.5194/ms-8-117-2017\n10.1007/s12206-019-1234-9\n10.3901/JME.2003.08.032\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2020.103951\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.113083\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2020.104214\n10.1007/s10846-008-9300-z\n10.5772/5721\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.163.111\n10.1007/s00158-008-0276-x\n10.3321/j.issn:1004-924X.2006.06.015\n10.1109/TASE.2012.2198466\n10.3390/mi12060678"}

For this reason, we review the recent progress in growth of aptamer-based QCM biosensors for medical diagnoses, including virus, bacteria, cell, protein, and disease biomarker detection.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["SemraAkg\u00f6n\u00fcll\u00fc", "Erdo\u011fan\u00d6zg\u00fcr", "AdilDenizli"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13091441\n10.1126/science.2200121\n10.1038/346818a0\n10.1038/344467a0\n10.1016/j.trac.2018.04.001\n10.1016/j.matlet.2021.131240\n10.1080/10643389.2019.1634457\n10.3390/mi11020220\n10.1007/s11274-021-03002-9\n10.1016/j.addr.2010.03.003\n10.1080/10408398.2011.642905\n10.1038/nmeth1127\n10.1016/j.talanta.2019.05.075\n10.1016/j.ab.2017.03.011\n10.1016/j.talanta.2017.11.048\n10.1126/science.287.5454.820\n10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.181208\n10.1007/s00216-019-01645-0\n10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138078\n10.1016/j.talanta.2016.02.054\n10.1007/s00604-019-3465-y\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.129316\n10.1016/j.aca.2019.07.054\n10.1002/cphc.201900104\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.02.024\n10.1016/j.talanta.2018.10.007\n10.1007/s13206-020-4401-2\n10.1016/j.talanta.2019.03.048\n10.1007/s00216-020-02774-7\n10.3390/ijms20102511\n10.1021/acsami.0c14788\n10.1117/1.JBO.19.8.080902\n10.1016/S0958-1669(96)80094-2\n10.1016/S0956-5663(01)00124-5\n10.1016/j.bios.2005.10.027\n10.1016/j.aca.2007.08.003\n10.1039/c0cc04140h\n10.1007/s00339-020-3328-8\n10.1016/j.talanta.2017.07.011\n10.1016/j.aca.2015.05.055\n10.1016/j.bios.2021.113087\n10.3390/chemosensors9120363\n10.1016/j.biosx.2022.100110\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.01.010\n10.1016/j.bios.2019.111914\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.125176\n10.3390/s140304948\n10.1021/acssensors.6b00834\n10.1007/s12274-011-0148-3\n10.3389/fbioe.2018.00029\n10.1021/ja108127r\n10.1080/21691401.2018.1548474\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112513\n10.1166/jbn.2010.1103\n10.3389/fchem.2014.00063\n10.3390/s19061279\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.173\n10.1007/s11664-019-07705-6\n10.1016/j.cis.2021.102431\n10.1038/s41598-018-30201-6\n10.1063/1.4866460\n10.1021/acsami.0c18582\n10.1021/acsami.0c19621\n10.3390/chemosensors10030106\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03115\n10.1021/acs.analchem.9b05397\n10.1021/acs.est.0c04347\n10.1016/B978-0-12-809597-3.00248-0\n10.1021/acsami.0c19010\n10.1021/acsomega.0c06181\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b03392\n10.1039/C9RA04152D\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.064\n10.1016/j.snb.2008.10.026\n10.1016/bs.apcsb.2015.08.002\n10.1021/ac981245l\n10.3390/molecules25173950\n10.3390/s8010370\n10.1016/j.polymer.2020.123335\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112837\n10.3390/chemosensors7030039\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b03026\n10.1039/c2sm26272j\n10.1021/am400909g\n10.3390/s22062337\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.03.143\n10.1002/pol.20210324\n10.1007/978-3-540-36568-6_12\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.117578\n10.1021/acsami.9b21604\n10.1016/j.jcis.2020.11.090\n10.1016/j.cjche.2021.04.016\n10.1002/anie.202110187\n10.1016/j.aca.2021.338329\n10.1021/am2005724\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.125787\n10.1007/s10853-020-05283-1\n10.1039/D1CE00212K\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.04.026\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.01.074\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107296\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.12.003\n10.1016/j.micromeso.2008.01.024\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.104\n10.1088/978-0-7503-3867-7ch4\n10.1038/s41598-018-34285-y\n10.1016/j.talanta.2019.06.060\n10.1080/09205063.2020.1865691\n10.1021/acsomega.1c04957\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.04.156\n10.3390/s150818565\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.10.038\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.09.067\n10.4236/ojab.2013.24013\n10.1039/C5RA03467A\n10.1016/j.jviromet.2004.01.005\n10.1002/advs.202001739\n10.1016/j.bios.2019.111933\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.12.011\n10.1021/la400224a\n10.1002/jcb.27771\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003553\n10.1021/acsanm.1c01350\n10.1016/j.bmcl.2004.10.083\n10.1039/D1AN02278D\n10.1016/j.microc.2017.02.025\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2004.04.011\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.03.037\n10.1016/j.bios.2008.12.036\n10.1002/1521-4095(200110)13:19<1480::AID-ADMA1480>3.0.CO;2-V\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.12.032\n10.1016/j.sbsr.2021.100416\n10.1136/bmj.1.6006.394-a\n10.1016/S0959-8049(00)00152-0\n10.5858/2010-0387-RAR.1\n10.1021/mp100455h\n10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.056\n10.1021/ac500375p\n10.3390/s140100144\n10.3390/chemosensors5010007\n10.1021/acsami.1c12716\n10.1039/C5AN01824B\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.12.009\n10.1039/C0CS00049C\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111984"}

Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is an analytical technique that uses the collective vibration of free electrons on metal surfaces. These measurements are known as analysis techniques that use metal surfaces and have been applied as biosensors because they allow for the label-free monitoring of biomolecular binding reactions. These measurements can be used in combination to analyze the reactions that occur on metal surfaces because different types of information can be obtained from them. However, as different devices are used for these measurements, the results often contain device-to-device errors and are not accurately evaluated. In this study, we directly fabricated gold nanostructures on the surface of a QCM to create a device that can simultaneously measure the mass and refractive index information of the analyte. In addition, the device could be easily fabricated because nanoimprint lithography was used to fabricate gold nanostructures. As a proof of concept, the nanoparticle adsorption on gold nanostructures was evaluated, and it was observed that mass and refractive index information were successfully obtained without device-to-device errors.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["RyosukeNishitsuji", "KenjiSueyoshi", "HideakiHisamoto", "TatsuroEndo"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13091430\n10.1007/BF01337937\n10.1016/S0925-4005(97)80077-9\n10.3390/s17122799\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.01.014\n10.1021/cm050704d\n10.1016/S0956-5663(00)00115-9\n10.1021/ac303268z\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.012\n10.1016/0039-6028(78)90283-2\n10.1146/annurev.physchem.58.032806.104607\n10.1021/ja063575q\n10.1021/nn901457f\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2011.03.003\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.05.009\n10.1021/ja044087q\n10.1021/ac0513459\n10.3390/s18041283\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.113\n10.1021/ac0606103\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02532\n10.1016/j.sbsr.2021.100415\n10.1021/nl035100s\n10.3390/s17071548\n10.1021/acsanm.9b00930\n10.7567/JJAP.55.08RE02"}

The challenges of microrobots in the direction of autonomy are categorized into four sections: mechanisms, power, sensing, and control. In each section, innovative research ideas are presented to inspire researchers in their prospective microrobot designs according to specific applications.

{"title": "Investigation of Nonlinear Piezoelectric Energy Harvester for Low-Frequency and Wideband Applications.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a monostable nonlinear Piezoelectric Energy Harvester (PEH). The harvester is based on an unconventional exsect-tapered fixed-guided spring design, which introduces nonlinearity into the system due to the bending and stretching of the spring. The physical-mathematical model and finite element simulations were performed to analyze the effects of the stretching-induced nonlinearity on the performance of the energy harvester.

{"title": "Production of Inhalable Ultra-Small Particles for Delivery of Anti-Inflammation Medicine via a Table-Top Microdevice.", "abstract": "A table-top microdevice was introduced in this work to produce ultrasmall particles for drug delivery via inhalation. The design and operation are similar to that of spray-drying equipment used in industry, but the device itself is much smaller and more portable in size, simpler to operate and more economical. More importantly, the device enables more accurate control over particle size. Using Flavopiridol, an anti-inflammation medication, formulations have been developed to produce inhalable particles for pulmonary delivery. A solution containing the desired components forms droplets by passing through an array of micro-apertures that vibrate via a piezo-electrical driver. High-purity nitrogen gas was introduced and flew through the designed path, which included the funnel collection and cyclone chamber, and finally was pumped away. The gas carried and dried the micronized liquid droplets along the pathway, leading to the precipitation of dry solid microparticles. The formation of the cyclone was essential to assure the sufficient travel path length of the liquid droplets to allow drying. Synthesis parameters were optimized to produce microparticles, whose morphology, size, physio-chemical properties, and release profiles met the criteria for inhalation. Bioactivity assays have revealed a high degree of anti-inflammation. The above-mentioned approach enabled the production of inhalable particles in research laboratories in general, using the simple table-top microdevice. The microparticles enable the inhalable delivery of anti-inflammation medicine to the lungs, thus providing treatment for diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["Matthew JOwen", "UmitCelik", "Subash KChaudhary", "Jasper H NYik", "John SPatton", "Mei-ChangKuo", "Dominik RHaudenschild", "Gang-YuLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13091382\n10.1007/s00011-018-1191-2\n10.1016/j.ccm.2011.09.001\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2015.08.002\n10.1007/s00428-021-03053-1\n10.3389/fphar.2021.808797\n10.1016/j.trsl.2015.08.004\n10.3389/fphar.2020.01096\n10.1002/art.38378\n10.22203/eCM.v030a14\n10.1016/j.joca.2018.11.006\n10.1016/j.joca.2018.02.610\n10.1016/j.joca.2020.07.012\n10.1007/s40242-021-1262-8\n10.1182/blood-2008-07-168583\n10.1016/j.tips.2007.10.012\n10.1182/blood-2006-05-020735\n10.1074/jbc.C000446200\n10.1074/jbc.M102306200\n10.1089/adt.2015.0003.drrr\n10.7573/dic.2020-4-15\n10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110380\n10.1128/mSystems.00431-19\n10.14336/AD.2017.0306\n10.1208/s12248-015-9814-9\n10.3390/pharmaceutics13010031\n10.3390/pharmaceutics12111025\n10.1208/s12249-021-02043-5\n10.1007/s12325-019-01066-6\n10.1016/S0168-3659(00)00362-X\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2008.06.013\n10.1016/j.powtec.2021.02.031\n10.1089/jamp.2020.29028.whf\n10.1186/2008-2231-22-50\n10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00896\n10.1039/C9RA00821G\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2015.07.049\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.07.034\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.11.012\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2018.03.005\n10.1016/j.bmcl.2015.03.065\n10.1080/02786826.2014.962685\n10.1046/j.1365-2125.2003.01892.x\n10.1038/s41598-019-42599-8\n10.1208/s12249-015-0317-x\n10.3389/fphar.2016.00181\n10.1046/j.1365-2125.2001.01304.x\n10.1021/acsnano.0c10040\n10.1016/j.addr.2021.02.017\n10.3390/pharmaceutics12080765\n10.1088/1752-7163/ac2589\n10.1002/jps.20618\n10.1080/02786826.2021.1904129\n10.1016/j.drudis.2021.04.009\n10.1002/ejlt.201300368\n10.1016/j.ajps.2014.09.004\n10.1023/A:1013082531394\n10.1016/j.ajps.2015.07.006\n10.4155/tde.14.3\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2003.10.039\n10.3390/pharmaceutics14061130\n10.1021/ja01128a023\n10.1139/v56-231\n10.1080/00268976.2011.575408\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2022.121758\n10.3390/ijerph17165795\n10.3389/fcell.2020.579658\n10.1111/bph.12408\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2011.06.035"}

{"title": "Droplet Distribution in a University Dental Clinic Setting: The Importance of High-Volume Evacuation.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to compare droplet distribution during a piezoelectric ultrasonic debridement procedure using either high-volume or slow-volume evacuation. Droplet distribution during a crown preparation with slow-volume evacuation is also examined. Fluorescein dye is added to the water reservoir and the procedures are performed by a single operator for 15 min on a dental manikin with artificial upper and lower teeth. Placement of filter paper squares (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) in radiating lines away from the oral cavity of the dental manikin allows for visualization of droplet dispersion. Results show minimal difference in the spread of the droplets between the two evacuators during the debridement procedure; however, the slow-volume evacuator produces a higher concentration of droplets than the high-volume evacuator. An even higher concentration of droplets in the vicinity of the dental chair is observed during the crown preparation procedure.

{"title": "Direct Purification of Digestate Using Polymeric Ultrafiltration Membranes: Influence of Materials on Filtration Behavior and Fouling Characteristics.", "abstract": "In-depth exploration of filtration behavior and fouling characteristics of polymeric ultrafiltration (UF) membranes can provide guidance for the selection of materials and the control of membrane fouling during the purification of digestate. In this study, four types of polymeric membranes, (polyethersulfone (PES), polysulfone (PS), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN)), were employed to filter digestate from swine manure. The results showed that the viscosity of the digestate dropped from 45.0 \u00b1 11.3 mPa\u00b7s to 18.0 \u00b1 9.8 mPa\u00b7s, with an increase in temperature from 30.0 \u00b0C to 45.0 \u00b0C. The four membrane fluxes all increased by more than 30%, with the cross flow velocity increasing from 1.0 m s\u22121 to 2.0 m s\u22121. During the batch experiments, the flux maintenance abilities of the membranes were in the order: PAN > PS > PVDF > PES. There were no significant differences in the effects of membrane materials on the removal of COD, TN, and TP (p < 0.05). For UV254 removal efficiency, PS showed the highest efficiency (68.6%), while PVDF showed the lowest efficiency (63.4%). The major fouling type was irreversible hydraulic fouling, and the main elements of scaling were C, O, S, and Ca. Pseudomonadales were the dominant bacteria in the PS (26.2%) and in the PVDF (51.4%) fouling layers, while Bacteroidales were the dominant bacteria in the PES (26.8%) and in the PAN (14.7%) fouling layers. The flux recovery rates (FRRs) of the cleaning methods can be arranged as follows: NaClO > NaOH > Citric acid \u2248 Tap water.

Eliminating these artifacts provides an opportunity for precisely mapping domain wall structures and dynamics, accurately quantifying local piezoelectric coupling coefficients, and reliably investigating hysteretic processes at the single nanometer scale to determine properties and mechanisms which underly important applications including computing, batteries and biology. Here we exploit the existence of an electrostatic blind spot (ESBS) along the length of the cantilever, due to the distributed nature of the electrostatic force, which can be universally used to separate unwanted long range electrostatic contributions from short range electromechanical responses of interest. The results of ESBS-PFM are compared to state-of-the-art interferometric displacement sensing PFM, showing excellent agreement above their respective noise floors. Ultimately, ESBS-PFM allows for absolute quantification of piezoelectric coupling coefficients independent of probe, lab or experimental conditions.

Prior to SW-ASV, PAA grafted nanopores demonstrated to efficiently trap Zn(II) ions at open circuit. This passive adsorption followed a Langmuir law. An affinity constant of 1.41\u00a0L\u00a0[Formula: see text]mol[Formula: see text] and a maximum Zn(II) adsorbed mass q[Formula: see text] of 1.21\u00a0[Formula: see text]mol\u00a0g[Formula: see text] were found.

{"title": "Mucosa-interfacing electronics.", "abstract": "The surface mucosa that lines many of our organs houses myriad biometric signals and, therefore, has great potential as a sensor-tissue interface for high-fidelity and long-term biosensing. However, progress is still nascent for mucosa-interfacing electronics owing to challenges with establishing robust sensor-tissue interfaces; device localization, retention and removal; and power and data transfer. This is in sharp contrast to the rapidly advancing field of skin-interfacing electronics, which are replacing traditional hospital visits with minimally invasive, real-time, continuous and untethered biosensing. This Review aims to bridge the gap between skin-interfacing electronics and mucosa-interfacing electronics systems through a comparison of the properties and functions of the skin and internal mucosal surfaces. The major physiological signals accessible through mucosa-lined organs are surveyed and design considerations for the next generation of mucosa-interfacing electronics are outlined based on state-of-the-art developments in bio-integrated electronics.

{"title": "Monolithic Silica Microbands Enable Thin-Layer Chromatography Analysis of Single Cells.", "abstract": "A picoliter thin-layer chromatography (pTLC) platform was developed for analyzing extremely miniature specimens, such as assay of the contents of a single cell of 1 picoliter volume. The pTLC chip consisted of an array of microscale bands made from highly porous monolithic silica designed to accept picoliter-scale volume samples. pTLC bands were fabricated by combining sol-gel chemistry and microfabrication technology. The width (60-80 \u03bcm) and depth (13 \u03bcm) of each band is comparable to the size of single cells and acted to reduce the lateral diffusion and confine the movement of compounds along the microbands. Ultrasmall volumes (tens of pL) of model fluorescent compounds were spotted onto the microband by a piezoelectric microdispenser and successfully separated by pTLC. The separation resolution and analyte migration were dependent on the macropore size (ranging from 0.3 to 2.3 \u03bcm), which was adjustable by changing the porogen concentration during the sol-gel process. For a 0.3 \u03bcm macropore size, attomoles of analyte were detectable by fluorescence using standard microscopy methods. The separation resolution, theoretical plate number, and separation times ranged from 1.3 to 2.1, 4 to 357, and 2 to 8 min, respectively, for the chosen model biological lipids. To demonstrate the capability of pTLC for separating analytes from single mammalian cells, cells loaded with fluorescent lipophilic dyes or sphingosine kinase reporter were spotted on microbands, and the single-cell contents separated by pTLC were detected from their fluorescence. These results demonstrate the potential of pTLC for applications in many areas where miniature specimens and high-throughput parallel analyses are needed.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2022-09-20", "authors": ["YuliWang", "MingYao", "Christopher ESims", "Nancy LAllbritton"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02622"}
{"title": "Optimization of an Antibody Microarray Printing Process Using a Designed Experiment.", "abstract": "Antibody microarrays have proven useful in immunoassay-based point-of-care diagnostics for infectious diseases. Noncontact piezoelectric inkjet printing has advantages to print antibody microarrays on nitrocellulose substrates for this application due to its compatibility with sensitive solutions and substrates, simple droplet control, and potential for high-capacity printing. However, there remain real-world challenges in printing such microarrays, which motivated this study. The effects of three concentrations of capture antibody (cAb) reagents and nozzle hydrostatic pressures were chosen to investigate three responses: the number of printed membrane disks, dispensing performance, and microarray quality. Printing conditions were found to be most ideal with 5 mg/mL cAb and a nozzle hydrostatic pressure near zero, which produced 130 membrane disks in a single print versus the 10 membrane disks per print before optimization. These results serve to inform efficient printing of antibody microarrays on nitrocellulose membranes for rapid immunoassay-based detection of infectious diseases and beyond.", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2022-09-20", "authors": ["Alexander JSummers", "Jasmine PDevadhasan", "JianGu", "Douglas CMontgomery", "BrittanyFischer", "Marcellene AGates-Hollingsworth", "Kathryn JPflughoeft", "TuanVo-Dinh", "David PAuCoin", "FredericZenhausern"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.2c03595\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c05278\n10.1373/clinchem.2014.223230\n10.2147/IJN.S267212\n10.3390/bios9040143\n10.1016/j.talanta.2014.09.027\n10.1016/j.talanta.2018.08.043\n10.1039/c9lc00011a\n10.1007/978-1-0716-1064-0_13\n10.1177/2211068215577570\n10.1002/pmic.201500429\n10.1088/1361-6528/aac84a\n10.1002/9780470559277.ch120035\n10.1002/biot.202000288\n10.1088/0960-1317/24/5/053001\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104502\n10.1039/c3an01577g\n10.1016/j.physrep.2010.03.003\n10.1109/AERO.2009.4839625\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1007/978-1-59745-240-3_6\n10.1016/j.jcis.2017.12.011"}
{"title": "Flexible multifunctional platform based on piezoelectric acoustics for human-machine interaction and environmental perception.", "abstract": "Flexible human-machine interfaces show broad prospects for next-generation flexible or wearable electronics compared with their currently available bulky and rigid counterparts. However, compared to their rigid counterparts, most reported flexible devices (e.g., flexible loudspeakers and microphones) show inferior performance, mainly due to the nature of their flexibility. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve their performance by developing and optimizing new materials, structures and design methodologies. In this paper, a flexible acoustic platform based on a zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film on an aluminum foil substrate is developed and optimized; this platform can be applied as a loudspeaker, a microphone, or an ambient sensor depending on the selection of its excitation frequencies. When used as a speaker, the proposed structure shows a high sound pressure level (SPL) of ~90\u2009dB (with a standard deviation of ~3.6\u2009dB), a low total harmonic distortion of ~1.41%, and a uniform directivity (with a standard deviation of ~4\u2009dB). Its normalized SPL is higher than those of similar devices reported in the recent literature. When used as a microphone, the proposed device shows a precision of 98% for speech recognition, and the measured audio signals show a strong similarity to the original audio signals, demonstrating its equivalent performance compared to a rigid commercial microphone. As a flexible sensor, this device shows a high temperature coefficient of frequency of -289\u2009ppm/K and good performance for respiratory monitoring.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2022-09-20", "authors": ["QianZhang", "YongWang", "DongshengLi", "JinXie", "RanTao", "JingtingLuo", "XuewuDai", "HamdiTorun", "QiangWu", "Wai PangNg", "RichardBinns", "YongQingFu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41378-022-00402-1"}

We have obtained the ground state energy (GSE) and the ground state binding energy (GSBE) of piezoelectric polaron. The effects of the EF, the MF, the range of the asymmetrical Gaussian confinement potential (RAGCP), Debye cut-off wavenumber (DCOW) and the electron-phonon coupling strength on the GSE and the GSBE are also analyzed. It is found that the GSE is an increasing function of the EF and the cyclotron frequency (CF), whereas it is a decreasing one of the RAGCP, the DCOW and electron-phonon coupling strength. The GSBE is an increasing function of the DCOW and the electron-phonon coupling strength. It is also an aggrandizing function with decreasing of the RAGCP, whereas it is a decayed one of the EF and CF. It is shown that the EF, the RAGCP, the MF, the DCOW and electron-phonon coupling strength are important factors that have great influence on the properties of the piezoelectric polaron in AGCPQW.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2022-09-17", "authors": ["FManfouo", "INsangou", "M F CFobasso", "A JFotue"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10505"}

{"title": "Decreasing free fatty acid of crude palm oil with polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membranes using a combination of chitosan and glutaraldehyde.", "abstract": "Crude palm oil (CPO) has emerged as a significant commodity in the economic and social development of producer nations. However, the presence of free fatty acids (FFAs) results in decreased CPO quality. Due to many advantages, the PVDF hollow fiber membrane has a higher potential to remove FFA from CPO than other polymeric membranes, despite the fact that FFA rejection performance remains poor. To solve this issue, membrane surface modification has emerged as one of the potential options for increasing electrostatic contact between the membrane surface and the FFA, resulting in high efficiency FFA separation from CPO. In this investigation, the membrane surface was coated with chitosan (CS) as a coating agent and glutaraldehyde (GA) as a crosslinking agent.

An ultrasonic horn, the most commonly used acoustic cavitation device, creates unique cavitation conditions under the horn tip that depend on various parameters such as the tip diameter, the driving frequency of the horn, its amplitude, and fluid properties. Unlike for hydrodynamic cavitation, the scaling laws for acoustic cavitation are poorly understood. Empirical relationships between cavitation dynamics, ultrasonic horn operating conditions, and fluid properties were found through systematic characterization of cavitation under the tip. Experiments were conducted in distilled water with various sodium chloride salt concentrations under different horn amplitudes, tip geometries, and ambient pressures. Cavitation characteristics were monitored by high-speed (200,000 fps) imaging, and numerous relations were found between operating conditions and cavitation dynamics. The compared results are discussed along with a proposal of a novel acoustic cavitation parameter and its relationship to the size of the cavitation cloud under the horn tip.

The prognosis of HB metastasis is poor, despite the increasing diversity of treatment. Piezo, a ubiquitously expressed membrane mechano-transduction protein, is involved in the process of tumor cell migration. Under the gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) database, Piezo1 was highly expressed in HB and negatively correlated with the overall survival time.\nFirstly, the expression of Piezo1 in both paracancerous and HB tissues (n = 7) was detected, and the prognostic value of Piezo1 was assessed in HB (n = 160) patients. Secondly, the inhibition and overexpression of Piezo1were executed in two HB cell lines, HepG2 and Huh 6. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT), wound healing and trans-well assays were performed to identify the effect of Piezo1 on the proliferation and metastasis of HB cells, respectively. In addition, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to determine whether Piezo1 has an interaction with HIF-1\u03b1. Finally, the expressions level of Piezo1, HIF-1\u03b1, and VEGF by overexpression/inhibition each other were detected by RT-qPCR and western blots to find a possible signaling channel in HB metastasis.\nWe found that Piezo1 was highly expressed in HB tissues and associated with poor prognosis of patients. Piezo1 was related to cell proliferation in HepG2 and Huh 6 cells. We also found that Piezo1 stimulated HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Meanwhile, overexpression of Piezo1 promoted the migration and invasion of HB cells, while the promotion was not detected when HIF-1\u03b1 was suppressed. Additionally, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 inhibited the expression of VEGF, but showed no effect on Piezo1 expression.\nIn this study, we identified that Piezo1 was involved in HB metastasis, and the Piezo1-HIF-1\u03b1-VEGF axis could be a possible signaling pathway in HB metastasis.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2022-09-14", "authors": ["XiaoshuoYe", "YongjieXia", "YuelanZheng", "WeiChen", "ZiminChen", "ZhenCheng", "BinWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10301"}

In this paper, finite element analysis is carried out to simulate lens-focused transducers with different matching layer structures and materials. It is found that the focused transducer with magnesium alloy matching layer has the best comprehensive performance. A lens-focused PZT-5H ultrasonic transducer was then fabricated with AZ31B magnesium alloy as the first matching layer.

Considering that hyperactivity is one of the main symptoms of ADHD, the inaccuracy of ADHD diagnosis based on subjective criteria necessitates the identification of a method to objectively diagnose ADHD.\nIn this study, a medical chair containing a piezoelectric material was applied to objectively analyze movements of patients with ADHD, which were compared with those of patients without ADHD.

The L-G@PVDF film exhibits high light absorption (\u223c95.4%) in the visible and NIR region. After lubricating with paraffin, the resultant surface shows excellent self-healing ability and light-responsive wettability change due to the photothermal effect of L-G@PVDF and the hot melting effect of paraffin. Additionally, by introducing anisotropic grooved structures, the paraffin-infused L-G@PVDF surface displays anisotropic wettability that further affects droplet manipulation under light irradiation. Also, the photothermal responsive slippery property endows the paraffin-infused L-G@PVDF surface with excellent anti-frosting and de-icing capability. Moreover, the smart paraffin-infused L-G@PVDF surface can be combined with a microfluidics chip for light-driven automatic sampling.

Forming p-n junction through interface engineering is an effective strategy to enhance its piezoelectric output, but the unclear regulation mechanism is a bottleneck in developing high-performance devices. In this work, the enhancement mechanism of interface engineering on the piezoelectric performance of ZnO nanorods (NRs) based devices is revealed from the perspective of carrier concentration. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that the piezoelectric output is significantly correlated with the carrier concentration, which is mainly attributed to the suppression of screening effect and the modulation of the device capacitance. After a reasonable matching design of carrier concentration, the piezoelectric potential of the ZnO NRs-based device is greatly enhanced by about 12 times.

{"title": "Next-generation graphene oxide additives composite membranes for emerging organic micropollutants removal: Separation, adsorption and degradation.", "abstract": "In the past two decades, membrane technology has attracted considerable interest as a viable and promising method for water purification. Emerging organic micropollutants (EOMPs) in wastewater have trace, persistent, highly variable quantities and types, develop hazardous intermediates and are diffusible. These primary issues affect EOMPs polluted wastewater on an industrial scale differently than in a lab, challenging membranes-based EOMP removal. Graphene oxide (GO) promises state-of-the-art membrane synthesis technologies and use in EOMPs removal systems due to its superior physicochemical, mechanical, and electrical qualities and high oxygen content. This critical review highlights the recent advancements in the synthesis of next-generation GO membranes with diverse membrane substrates such as ceramic, polyethersulfone (PES), and polyvinylidene \ufb02uoride (PVDF). The EOMPs removal efficiencies of GO membranes in filtration, adsorption (incorporated with metal, nanomaterial in biodegradable polymer and biomimetic membranes), and degradation (in catalytic, photo-Fenton, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic membranes) and corresponding removal mechanisms of different EOMPs are also depicted. GO-assisted water treatment strategies were further assessed by various influencing factors, including applied water flow mode and membrane properties (e.g., permeability, hydrophily, mechanical stability, and fouling). GO additive membranes showed better permeability, hydrophilicity, high water flux, and fouling resistance than pristine membranes. Likewise, degradation combined with filtration is two times more effective than alone, while crossflow mode improves the photocatalytic degradation performance of the system. GO integration in polymer membranes enhances their stability, facilitates photocatalytic processes, and gravity-driven GO membranes enable filtration of pollutants at low pressure, making membrane filtration more inexpensive. However, simultaneous removal of multiple contaminants with contrasting characteristics and variable efficiencies in different systems demands further optimization in GO-mediated membranes.

Compounds to capacitate bovine spermatozoa, such as heparin and methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and compounds to destabilize sperm membranes such as NaOH, lysolecithin and Triton X-100, have been assessed, although they have failed to substantially improve post-ICSI embryonic development. Disulfide bond reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol (DTT), dithiobutylamine and reduced glutathione, have been assessed to decondense the hypercondensed head of bovine spermatozoa, the two latter being more efficient than DTT and less harmful. Although piezo-directed ICSI without external activation has generated high fertilization rates and modest rates of early embryo development, other studies have required exogenous activation to improve the results.

LW simulation based on piezoelectric transducers (referred to as PZTs) is an efficient and low-cost method. This paper proposes a multiphysics simulation method of LW propagation with the PZTs under temperature effect. The effect of temperature on LW propagation is considered from two aspects. On the one hand, temperature affects the material parameters of the structure, the adhesive layers and the PZTs. On the other hand, it is considered that the thermal stress caused by the inconsistency of thermal expansion coefficients among the structure, the adhesive layers, and the PZTs affect the piezoelectric constant of the PZTs. Based on the COMSOL Multiphysics, the mechanic-electric-thermal directly coupling simulation model under temperature effect is established. The simulation model consists of two steps. In the first step, the thermal-mechanic coupling is carried out to calculate the thermal stress, and the thermal stress effect is introduced into the piezoelectric constant model. In the second step, mechanic-electric coupling is carried out to simulate LW propagation, which considers the piezoelectric effect of the PZTs for the LW excitation and reception. The simulation results at -20 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C are obtained and compared to the experiment.

This work presents the development of a prototype of an impact rain gauge based on a very low-cost piezoelectric sensor. The sensor was developed by assembling off-the-shelf and reused components following an easy prototyping approach; the calibration of the relationship between the different properties of the voltage signal, as sampled by the rain drop impact, and rainfall intensity was established using machine-learning methods.

{"title": "Scattered Ultrasonic Guided Waves Characterized by Wave Damage Interaction Coefficients: Numerical and Experimental Investigations.", "abstract": "The present paper comprehensively investigates the complex interaction between ultrasonic guided waves and local structural discontinuities, such as damages, through highly sensitive features: so-called wave damage interaction coefficients (WDICs). These WDICs are unique for each structural discontinuity and depend solely on their characteristics for a given structure and condition. Thus, they can be particularly useful for advanced assessment of lightweight structures in the context of non-destructive evaluation and structural health monitoring. However, the practical application of WDICs entails significant difficulties due to their sensitivity and complex patterns. Therefore, this study attempts to guide researchers and practitioners in the estimation of WDICs from numerical simulations and physical experiments. Detailed investigations are made for an aluminum host plate modified by artificial structural discontinuities, i.e., surface-bonded steel sheets. The numerical simulations are performed to predict WDICs and study sensitivities using a sophisticated finite element model. The experimental setup uses piezoelectric transducers to excite guided waves in the host plate. A single scanning laser Doppler vibrometer measures the scattered guided waves caused by the surface-bonded steel sheets, and the resulting WDICs with possible influences are investigated. In both cases, the orientation and thickness of the attached steel sheets were varied to create 12 different damage scenarios. In general, the comparison between numerical and experimental WDICs show good agreement. This underpins the applicability of the general methodology for simulating and measuring WDICs over all scenarios. Furthermore, the WDIC scattering patterns reveal a clear dependency of the peaks in the back-scattered reflections for both the numerical and experimental amplitude coefficients on the damage orientation, basically following the law of reflection. However, some discrepancies between both studies were observed. Numerical sensitivity analysis identified the adhesive layer as one reason for such differences. Additionally, misalignment errors in the experimental measurements were also found to affect WDICs. Therefore, an improved baseline subtraction method is proposed, which clearly enhances the experimental WDICs. Finally, an experimental sensitivity study of WDICs for selected sensing radii revealed only a minor influence. All these investigations were made for the amplitude as well as the phase representation of WDICs. Thus, these findings may open the way to future research and development of techniques employing WDICs for advanced applications of non-destructive evaluation and structural health monitoring.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-09-10", "authors": ["ChristophHumer", "SimonH\u00f6ll", "ChristophKralovec", "MartinSchagerl"], "doi": "10.3390/s22176403\n10.3390/s20205835\n10.3390/s19020383\n10.3390/s21010044\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.3390/s20030826\n10.1098/rspa.2007.1834\n10.1177/1045389X18818775\n10.1177/1045389X15571383\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2009.09.003\n10.1177/1475921719830612\n10.1016/S0165-2125(02)00051-3\n10.1006/jsvi.1995.0129\n10.1016/j.jsv.2008.04.028\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2019.08.015\n10.1016/j.apm.2018.08.019\n10.3390/s21030860\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.03.019\n10.1016/j.wavemoti.2015.05.009\n10.3390/ma9070602\n10.3390/s21082749\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.09.011\n10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106743\n10.1016/j.wavemoti.2016.03.009\n10.1016/S0167-6636(98)00060-X\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.09.008\n10.1177/1475921718817169"}
{"title": "A Novel High-Speed Resonant Frequency Tracking Method Using Transient Characteristics in a Piezoelectric Transducer.", "abstract": "When driving the piezoelectric transducer (PT: piezo transducer), which is a key device, it is important for the ultrasonic system (using ultrasonic waves of 20 kHz or higher) to operate at a resonant frequency that can maximize the conversion of mechanical energy (vibration) from electrical energy. The resonant frequency of the PT changes during the actual operation according to the load fluctuations and environmental conditions. Therefore, to maintain a stable output in an ultrasonic system, it is essential to track the resonant frequency in a short time. In particular, fast resonant frequency tracking (RFT: resonant frequency tracking) is an important factor in the medical ultrasonic system, i.e., the system applied in this thesis. The reason is that in the case of a medical ultrasonic system, heat-induced skin necrosis, etc., may cause the procedure to be completed within a short period of time. Therefore, tracking the RFT time for maximum power transfer is an important factor; in this thesis, we propose a new high-speed RFT method. The proposed method finds the whole system resonance frequency by using the transient phenomenon (underdamped response characteristic) that appears in an impedance system, such as an ultrasonic generator, and uses this to derive the mechanical resonance frequency of the PT. To increase the accuracy of the proposed method, parameter fluctuations of the pressure of the PT, the equivalent circuit impedance analysis of the PT, and a MATLAB simulation were performed. Through this, the correlation between the resonance frequency of the ultrasonic system, including the LC filter with nonlinear characteristics and the mechanical resonance frequency of the PT, was analyzed. Based on the analyzed results, a method for tracking the mechanical resonance frequency that can transfer the maximum output to the PT is proposed in this thesis. Experiments show that using the proposed high-speed RFT method, the ultrasonic system can track the mechanical resonance frequency of the PT with high accuracy in a short time.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-09-10", "authors": ["JeonghoonMoon", "SungjunPark", "SangkilLim"], "doi": "10.3390/s22176378\n10.1186/s10033-022-00767-4\n10.1146/annurev-food-030212-182537\n10.3390/s121217343\n10.1016/j.enconman.2009.02.020\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.08.007\n10.1250/ast.30.180\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2014.06.001\n10.1109/TIE.2014.2308156\n10.1038/srep09309\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2011.09.001\n10.1109/TIE.2018.2840503\n10.3390/s140203323\n10.3390/sym12040643\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.11.170\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.07.001\n10.1021/acsami.0c11913\n10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3093867\n10.1109/TIE.2015.2436874\n10.1054/bjps.1999.3266\n10.1109/TPEL.2005.861125\n10.1016/S0041-624X(01)00060-9\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2674612\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2740827\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2784350\n10.1109/TPEL.2019.2921384\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2963214\n10.3390/electronics8020169\n10.1049/iet-pel.2015.0365\n10.1049/iet-pel.2012.0031\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.3008762\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.05.021\n10.3390/s17020329\n10.1115/1.2202157\n10.1142/S2010135X15500320\n10.1177/1045389X09351757\n10.1109/TIE.2016.2582460\n10.1109/TPEL.2014.2328337\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2009.06.005\n10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2437199\n10.1080/00207217.2020.1793419\n10.1016/j.jsv.2008.04.052\n10.1016/j.jsv.2003.05.012\n10.1063/1.4932107\n10.1186/1687-1847-2012-215\n10.1016/S0019-0578(07)60142-6\n10.1080/02286203.1998.11760397\n10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2290083\n10.3390/mi12070779\n10.1109/58.883527"}
{"title": "Micronized Recycle Rubber Particles Modified Multifunctional Polymer Composites: Application to Ultrasonic Materials Engineering.", "abstract": "There is a growing interest in multifunctional composites and in the identification of novel applications for recycled materials. In this work, the design and fabrication of multiple particle-loaded polymer composites, including micronized rubber from end-of-life tires, is studied. The integration of these composites as part of ultrasonic transducers can further expand the functionality of the piezoelectric material in the transducer in terms of sensitivity, bandwidth, ringing and axial resolution and help to facilitate the fabrication and use of phantoms for echography. The adopted approach is a multiphase and multiscale one, based on a polymeric matrix with a load of recycled rubber and tungsten powders. A fabrication procedure, compatible with transducer manufacturing, is proposed and successfully used. We also proposed a modelling approach to calculate the complex elastic modulus, the ultrasonic damping and to evaluate the relative influence of particle scattering. It is concluded that it is possible to obtain materials with acoustic impedance in the range 2.35-15.6 MRayl, ultrasound velocity in the range 790-2570 m/s, attenuation at 3 MHz, from 0.96 up to 27 dB/mm with a variation of the attenuation with the frequency following a power law with exponent in the range 1.2-3.2.

{"title": "The 3.4 GHz BAW RF Filter Based on Single Crystal AlN Resonator for 5G Application.", "abstract": "To meet the stringent requirements of 5G communication, we proposed a high-performance bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter based on single crystal AlN piezoelectric films on a SiC substrate. The fabrication of the BAW filter is compatible with the GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) process, enabling the implementation of the integration of the BAW device and high-performance monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC). The single crystal AlN piezoelectric film with 650-nm thickness was epitaxially grown on the SiC substrate by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). After wafer bonding and substrate removal, the single crystal AlN film with electrode layers was transferred to another SiC wafer to form an air gap type BAW. Testing results showed that the fabricated resonators have a maximum Q-factor up to 837 at 3.3 GHz resonant frequency and electromechanical coupling coefficient up to 7.2%. Ladder-type filters were developed to verify the capabilities of the BAW and process, which has a center frequency of 3.38 GHz with 160 MHz 3 dB bandwidth. The filter achieved a minimum 1.5 dB insertion loss and more than 31 dB out-of-band rejection. The high performance of the filters is attributed to the high crystallinity and low defects of epitaxial single crystal AlN films.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-09-10", "authors": ["RuiDing", "WeipengXuan", "ShurongDong", "BiaoZhang", "FengGao", "GangLiu", "ZichaoZhang", "HaoJin", "JikuiLuo"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12173082\n10.1038/s41378-020-00183-5\n10.3390/mi11070630\n10.1088/1361-6641/abe5fd\n10.1109/JMEMS.2020.3036379"}

{"title": "Recent Progress on Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Vibration Energy Harvesting and Vibration Sensing.", "abstract": "The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a recent technology that reforms kinetic energy generation and motion sensing. A TENG comes with variety of structures and mechanisms that make it suitable for wide range of applications and working conditions. Since mechanical vibrations are abundant source of energy in the surrounding environment, the development of a TENG for vibration energy harvesting and vibration measurements has attracted a huge attention and great research interest through the past two decades. Due to the high output voltage and high-power density of a TENG, it can be used as a sustainable power supply for small electronics, smart devices, and wireless sensors. In addition, it can work as a vibration sensor with high sensitivity. This article reviews the recent progress in the development of a TENG for vibration energy harvesting and vibration measurements. Systems of only a TENG or a hybrid TENG with other transduction technologies, such as piezoelectric and electromagnetic, can be utilized for vibrations scavenging. Vibration measurement can be done by measuring either vibration displacement or vibration acceleration. Each can provide full information about the vibration amplitude and frequency. Some TENG vibration-sensing architectures may also be used for energy harvesting due to their large output power. Numerous applications can rely on TENG vibration sensors such as machine condition monitoring, structure health monitoring, and the Internet of things (IoT).", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-09-10", "authors": ["AhmedHaroun", "MohamedTarek", "MohamedMosleh", "FaroukIsmail"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12172960\n10.5120/ijca2016909120\n10.1088/0957-0233/17/12/R01\n10.1088/2631-6331/ab376f\n10.1109/ICInfA.2012.6246873\n10.1785/BSSA0270040267\n10.1177/2472630319891128\n10.3390/en10101483\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab36e4\n10.1063/1.4936607\n10.1007/s42947-019-0032-1\n10.3390/en13010223\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.04.027\n10.1109/JMEMS.2017.2728821\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111535\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.02.048\n10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.053\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.105\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.01.025\n10.1016/j.jsv.2015.03.048\n10.3390/mi8100288\n10.3390/app10020671\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105568\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/11/115025\n10.1109/INECCE.2011.5953877\n10.1088/1742-6596/476/1/012127\n10.1088/1742-6596/476/1/012115\n10.1088/1742-6596/557/1/012126\n10.1088/0960-1317/24/3/035001\n10.1002/aenm.201802906\n10.1515/ntrev-2020-0049\n10.1039/c3ee42571a\n10.1155/2016/5651613\n10.3390/s20041063\n10.1002/adfm.201302453\n10.1002/aenm.201702432\n10.1016/j.cap.2020.11.001\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115799\n10.1021/acsnano.6b06622\n10.1021/nn405209u\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104524\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104813\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105880\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104918\n10.1109/NANO.2015.7388828\n10.1039/C7NR04610C\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105373\n10.1002/eom2.12058\n10.1088/2632-959X/abf3d4\n10.34133/2021/9143762\n10.1007/s40820-021-00713-4\n10.1002/adma.202005521\n10.3390/jsan10010022\n10.1016/j.matlet.2019.127119\n10.1016/j.eml.2020.101100\n10.3390/mi12020218\n10.1016/j.joule.2017.09.004\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.01.013\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104011\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.116871\n10.1002/adfm.201304211\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107368\n10.1002/aenm.201301322\n10.1038/s41598-019-44683-5\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.022\n10.3390/s21041514\n10.1039/d0se01201g\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.08.024\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.11.039\n10.3390/en10122024\n10.1038/srep41396\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.113270\n10.1016/j.smaim.2020.07.005\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.03.004\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.12.046\n10.1021/nn5054365\n10.1002/adma.201304619\n10.1002/aenm.201700565\n10.1002/admt.201800328\n10.1021/acsnano.9b10142\n10.1126/sciadv.aav6437\n10.1016/j.eml.2020.101021\n10.1021/acsnano.7b03818\n10.1021/acsnano.8b01589\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.12.022\n10.1002/aenm.201802159\n10.1002/admt.202000159\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105952\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104228\n10.1002/aenm.201902460\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105555\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/1/014005\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2020.103905"}

Herein, a novel two-dimensional (2D) nano-mica sheets assembled composite membrane with underwater super-oleophobic properties was developed for effective oil/water separation. A 2D nano-mica sheet was synthesized by a facile solvent-assisted ultrasonic exfoliation and then the obtained 2D nano-mica sheets were co-deposited with dopamine on polyvinylidene fluoride substrate to prepare nano-mica composite membranes (NCM). The NCM is hydrophilic in air and super-oleophobic underwater (the water contact angle in the air is 37.6\u00b0, and the oil contact angle in water is 151.4\u00b0). Furthermore, the prepared NCM provided outstanding stability in different acid-base environments (pH = 1-11). Noteworthily, the oil removal rate is higher than 99.5% as the sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS-stabilized oil (soya-bean oil, mineral oil and pump oil) -in-water emulsions. Meanwhile, the NCM showed excellent reusability, as the oil removal efficiency kept at 99.0% after ten soya-bean oil-in-water or mineral oil-in-water emulsion filtration cycles.

{"title": "Highly Sensitive and Real-Time Detection of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles Using Quartz Crystal Microbalance via DNA Induced Conjugation.", "abstract": "With the development of nanotechnology, nanomaterials have been widely used in the development of commercial products. In particular, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) have been of great interest due to their extraordinary properties, such as semiconductive, piezoelectric, and absorbance properties in UVA and UVB (280-400 nm) spectra. However, recent studies have investigated the toxicity of these ZnONPs; therefore, a ZnONP screening tool is required for human health and environmental problems. In this study, we propose a detection method for ZnONPs using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and DNA. The detection method was based on the resonance frequency shift of the QCM. In detail, two different complementary DNA strands were used to conjugate ZnONPs, which were subjected to mass amplification. One of these DNA strands was designed to hybridize to a probe DNA immobilized on the QCM electrode. By introducing the ZnONP conjugation, we were able to detect ZnONPs with a detection limit of 100 ng/mL in both distilled water and a real sample of drinking water, which is 3 orders less than the reported critical harmful concentration of ZnONPs. A phosphate terminal group, which selectively interacts with a zinc oxide compound, was also attached at one end of a DNA linker and was attributed to the selective detection of ZnONPs. As a result, better selective detection of ZnONPs was achieved compared to gold and silicon nanoparticles.

This technical note describes the covering of a tear in the palatal mucosa using a buccal fat pad (BFP) flap, in the context of maxillary segmentation during Le Fort I osteotomy. Through the limited buccal incision used for the Le Fort I osteotomy, a small incision is made in the right periosteum posteriorly, and a supraperiosteal dissection is performed to access the BFP. After a sufficient amount of flap is made available, it is gently introduced through the osteotomy gap until it reaches the palatal mucosa defect and is then sutured. In the patient case presented, the palatal mucosa healed fully within 18 days, and the patient reported no nasal regurgitation of food, defective speech, fetid odour, bad taste, or upper respiratory tract or ear infection during the postoperative period. This technique using a BFP flap should therefore be considered in the context of unexpected tearing of the palatal mucosa in patients undergoing a segmented Le Fort I osteotomy.", "journal": "International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2022-09-09", "authors": ["FHern\u00e1ndez-Alfaro", "DSoriano-Mart\u00edn", "GMolins-Ballabriga", "AValls-Onta\u00f1\u00f3n"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2022.08.016"}
{"title": "Simulation Study on the Screening of Hydrophobic Surface Materials for Pipeline Drag Reduction Based on Adsorption Properties.", "abstract": "Hydrophobic surface drag reduction techniques are effective in reducing the frictional resistance of fluids, the adsorption of liquid molecules on hydrophobic surfaces can reflect the resistance to fluid flow through such solid surfaces. Based on molecular simulation technology, we investigate the adsorption characteristics of water molecules on hydrophobic surfaces to achieve rapid screening of hydrophobic materials in fire-fighting water supply systems. The Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the adsorption process of polymers and to analyze the effects of temperature and fixed adsorption quantity. Contact angle tests were also done to verify polymer hydrophobicity. The isothermal adsorption heat, water molecule distribution, and energy distribution were studied by molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics methods. Then, adsorption localization simulations and electrostatic potential distributions were used to predict possible adsorption sites on hydrophobic surfaces and single-molecule chains. Finally, the interaction energy, diffusion coefficient, and free volume were investigated to explain the adsorption mechanism at the molecular level. Simulation results show that, overall, PTFE was more hydrophobic and PES was more hydrophilic and at 298 K, the number of adsorbed water molecules was ranked as follows: PTFE < PVDF < PVC < PMMA < PPS < CSM < BD-HDI < BD-MDI < BD-TDI < PES. Furthermore, PTFE, PVDF, PVC, PES, and PPS have more stable adsorption configurations on the (0 -1 0) surface. According to the findings, hydrogen bonding dominates the interaction between water molecules and hydrophilic polymers, whereas \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions increase water molecules' diffusion resistance in polymers with benzene rings. In addition, PES contains many sulfone groups and ether bonds, which disorganize the chain arrangement to provide more free volume, whereas the water adsorption rate of PTFE is reduced because its molecular chains are less convoluted and more organized.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2022-09-09", "authors": ["JunqingMeng", "JieWang", "LijuanWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01299"}

The nature of nonlinear constitutive behavior of each constituent is expected to significantly influence the overall responses of the composites. To obtain the effective nonlinear responses, a mathematical linearization is first introduced to perform the constitutive linearization for the nonlinear materials, and the resulting constitutive equations are then unified and nested into the micromechanics model followed by iterations in order to minimize errors from the linearization process. For the purpose of comparison, we also reformulate the well-established Mori-Tanaka micromechanics model insofar as its mathematical structure is aligned with that of the simplified unit-cell model. Numerical results are first validated against limited experimental measurements available in literature. Parametric studies are then conducted in order to reveal the effect of phase constitutive laws, volume fractions, and geometries on the overall nonlinear responses of there-phase magnetoelectric composites.

This paper details the use of nanoclay fillers to enhance the properties of silicone, successfully increasing strength whilst maintaining flexibility. The performance of the enhanced silicone is as robust and resistant to tear and puncture as commercial gloves, while being more flexible. This flexibility makes the incorporation of a piezo-electric pressure sensor based on the EEonyx conductive fabric, practical. A sandwich of the cloth and copper fabric creates the sensor, which decreases in resistance with increasing pressure. The sensors are characterised and production variability within the silicone are tested. Three sensors are incorporated into a glove made to fit around a Southampton Intelligent Hand.

Sequential wood modifications (delignification, oxidation, and model fluorination) are performed, and effects on vibration sensing abilities are investigated. Wood veneer piezoelectricity is characterized by the piezoresponse force microscopy mode in atomic force microscopy. Delignification, oxidation, and model fluorination of wood-based sensors provide output voltages of 11.4, 23.2, and 60 mV by facilitating cellulose microfibril deformation. The vibration sensing ability correlates with improved piezoelectricity and increased cellulose deformation, most likely by large, local cell wall bending. This shows that nanostructural wood materials design can tailor the functional properties of wood devices with potential in sustainable nanotechnology.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2022-09-07", "authors": ["FarsaRam", "JonasGaremark", "YuanyuanLi", "Torbj\u00f6rnPettersson", "Lars ABerglund"], "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.2c04668\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2011.12.006\n10.1002/adma.202008452\n10.1002/admt.202001164\n10.1002/adfm.201002077\n10.1063/1.4979081\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.118188\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.117460\n10.1038/s41578-020-0195-z\n10.1007/BF00350276\n10.2737/FPL-GTR-212\n10.1021/acsami.0c05680\n10.1209/0295-5075/107/28006\n10.1021/acsnano.1c07614\n10.1021/acsami.6b03597\n10.1007/s10570-021-03896-6\n10.1021/acsabm.0c00364\n10.1002/adma.202003653\n10.1021/acsnano.0c05493\n10.1126/sciadv.abd9138\n10.1016/j.crvi.2004.03.010\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(19990321)71:12<1969::AID-APP6>3.0.CO;2-D\n10.1039/C4AN02248C\n10.1126/sciadv.aau4238\n10.1021/acsnano.0c07613\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c05038\n10.1007/s10086-010-1133-2\n10.1021/am5008968\n10.1021/acsabm.8b00309\n10.1038/srep34616\n10.1109/58.883516\n10.1016/j.mattod.2016.12.001\n10.1515/HF.2007.015\n10.1007/BF00521871\n10.1039/C7RA04752E\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.153701\n10.1063/1.1143970"}
{"title": "A Strategy for Polar Crystals with Dipolar Heterohelicenes.", "abstract": "Polar crystals have attracted interest for the applications to polar materials with piezo- and pyroelectricity, and second harmonic generation. Despite their potential utility for flexible polar materials, a strategy for ordering polar helicenes has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the creation of polar crystals with unsymmetrically substituted aza[5]helicenes tuned by substituents. The unsymmetric aza[5]helicenes have been prepared through regioselective mono-protiodesilylations. We disclose that triisopropylsilyl-substituted derivatives show 1D chain columnar packings. In particular, enantiopure crystals showed spontaneous polarization. Optical and single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments with other derivatives, as well as theoretical calculations, revealed that the presence of triisopropylsilyl or electron-withdrawing aryl substituents is essential for forming the 1D chain columnar structure. Hirshfeld surface analyses further showed that CH-\u03c0 interactions between 1D chain columns regulate the polar assembly. Finally, we determined the polarizability of the nitro derivative by ab initio calculation to be 4.53\u2005\u03bcC/cm", "journal": "Chemistry, an Asian journal", "date": "2022-09-07", "authors": ["SatoruHiroto", "ManaWakita", "MoekoChujo"], "doi": "10.1002/asia.202200808"}

{"title": "Waste to treasure: Superwetting foam enhanced by bamboo powder for sustainable on-demand oil-water separation.", "abstract": "Low-cost and sustainable superwetting materials are urgently required for oily wastewater treatment. Many poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based materials have been designed for oil-water separation. However, their fabrication processes frequently require toxic organic solvents and high-cost materials (e.g., carbon tubes and graphene). In this study, a highly porous and superhydrophobic bamboo powders (BP)-enhanced PVDF foam (SBPF) was fabricated via an organic solvent-free process. The SBPF exhibits efficient adsorption and recovery for various oils and organic solvents. Moreover, the SBPF shows high adsorption and separation performance under ultraviolet exposure and turbulent environments. It can also be used for water-in-oil emulsions separation, with a high separation efficiency more than 99.3\u00a0% under gravity. Interestingly, the amphiphilic PVDF-BP foam (ABPF) shows underwater superoleophobicity and underoil superhydrophobicity after delignification of SBPF. Owing to the conversion of wettability, it presents a high performance in treatment of both surfactant-stabilied water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions with the high separation efficiency achieving more than 99.6\u00a0% and 99.5\u00a0% respectively under gravity. In addition, the ABPF shows a high separation performance even after ten cycles. Hence, this fabricated organic solvent-free foams are promising candidates for sustainable on-demand separation of oils or organic solvents and water in complex environments.", "journal": "Journal of hazardous materials", "date": "2022-09-05", "authors": ["DongWu", "ShunyouHu", "BeibeiLu", "YuanyuanHu", "MiWang", "WenYu", "Gui-GenWang", "JiahengZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129829"}
{"title": "Acoustic Focusing of Protein Crystals for In-Line Monitoring and Up-Concentration during Serial Crystallography.", "abstract": "Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) has become one of the standard techniques at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) to obtain high-resolution structural information from microcrystals of proteins. Nevertheless, reliable sample delivery is still often limiting data collection, as microcrystals can clog both field- and flow-focusing nozzles despite in-line filters. In this study, we developed acoustic 2D focusing of protein microcrystals in capillaries that enables real-time online characterization of crystal size and shape in the sample delivery line after the in-line filter. We used a piezoelectric actuator to create a standing wave perpendicular to the crystal flow, which focused lysozyme microcrystals into a single line inside a silica capillary so that they can be imaged using a high-speed camera. We characterized the acoustic contrast factor, focus size, and the coaxial flow lines and developed a splitting union that enables up-concentration to at least a factor of five. The focus size, flow rates, and geometry may enable an upper limit of up-concentration as high as 200 fold. The novel feedback and concentration control could be implemented for serial crystallography at synchrotrons with minor modifications. It will also aid the development of improved sample delivery systems that will increase SFX data collection rates at XFELs, with potential applications to many proteins that can only be purified and crystallized in small amounts.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2022-09-03", "authors": ["Bj\u00f6rnHammarstr\u00f6m", "Thomas JLane", "HazalBatili", "RaymondSierra", "MartinWiklund", "Jonas ASellberg"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01701\n10.1126/science.1217737\n10.1126/science.1259357\n10.1038/s41586-018-0681-2\n10.1038/s41467-019-10758-0\n10.1038/35021099\n10.1038/nphys461\n10.1126/science.1234273\n10.1038/s41586-021-04218-3\n10.1088/0022-3727/41/19/195505\n10.1038/srep44628\n10.1107/S1600576721011079\n10.1038/ncomms4309\n10.1016/j.str.2016.02.007\n10.1038/nmeth.4195\n10.1038/nmeth.4335\n10.1107/S0907444912038152\n10.1038/nmeth.3667\n10.1038/s41467-020-14434-6\n10.1107/S2052252521008125\n10.1364/OE.440173\n10.1039/C3LC51144H\n10.1002/adma.201503916\n10.1016/j.fsigen.2019.03.012\n10.1038/s41598-021-96288-6\n10.1121/10.0003600\n10.1039/c2lc21068a\n10.3390/mi9110594\n10.1039/b609184a\n10.1039/C8LC00537K\n10.1007/s10544-017-0157-4\n10.3390/cryst9030120\n10.1021/ac071402t\n10.1112/plms/s1-10.1.4\n10.1038/nature13266\n10.1039/c2lc40120g\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.09.016\n10.1121/10.0001634\n10.1039/b920376a"}

To make the osteotomy cuts, on the one side, piezo-osteotome was used, and on the other side, conventional osteotomy bur was used.\nDuration of osteotomy was found to be greater with piezo osteotomy compared to bur osteotomy. Mild bleeding was observed with piezosurgery. Postoperative swelling was greater on the side of piezosurgery compared to the bur side. Altered neurosensory activity was found to be equal on the 1\nPiezoelectric device offers better advantages over the conventional bur in orthognathic surgery and hence can be considered an alternative to the bur in some orthognathic procedures.", "journal": "National journal of maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2022-09-03", "authors": ["HarshithaRaj", "MadhumatiSingh", "Anjan KumarShah"], "doi": "10.4103/njms.njms_357_21"}

{"title": "Enhanced absorption in structural acoustic silencers using piezo-shunting.", "abstract": "Structural acoustic silencers (sas) consist of a thin flexible plate that is introduced into a wall of an otherwise rigid-walled duct in which acoustic noise is propagating. Transmission loss (TL) in sas arises from reflection due to impedance mismatch, as well as partial absorption due to material damping in the plate. Reflection-based TL is less preferable than absorption-based TL, especially where back-pressure is undesirable. In this study, the TL arising out of absorption is increased by increasing the effective plate damping using the piezo-shunting method. Experiments are conducted on a custom-made sas with copper sheets of two different thicknesses. Piezo-shunting to increase the damping of the copper plate is done by connecting an electrical resistor to the external circuit of a thin piezoelectric bimorph attached to the copper plate. The effect of piezo-shunting on the sas TL is analyzed using a model. Piezo-shunt increases the fraction of power absorbed and decreases the reflected power fraction. The dependency of these fractions on the value of the electrical resistor and the impedance of the plate are discussed. This study demonstrates that piezo-shunting can be used to improve absorption-based TL in sas.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2022-09-02", "authors": ["Chappe NarsingSuryakant", "AbhishekSingh", "RahulRamdas", "KunalDighe", "SripriyaRamamoorthy"], "doi": "10.1121/10.0013573"}

This piezoelectric energy harvester uses vibrations caused by vortex excitation behind the winding fluid to harvest wind energy. In particular, this structure uses vortex excitation formed behind a vertically suspended cylindrical winding fluid to cause the vibration of the cylindrical winding fluid, which then indirectly excites the piezoelectric element. The CCBPH consists of a fixed support, a cantilever beam, magnet-1 and magnet-2, a support beam, two piezoelectric units-PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride), a compound cantilever beam, and a cylindrical winding fluid. We investigated the parameters affecting the structure and verify the effectiveness of the energy harvester through the design of the structure, simulation analysis, and experiments. The experimental results show that the CCBPH can obtain the maximum output voltage from the energy harvester at a wind speed of 18\u00a0m/s.

These pressure sensors can be comfortably attached onto human skin or can be implanted on the surface of vascular grafts for uninterrupted monitoring of arterial blood pressure. While the traditional monitoring systems are time-consuming, expensive, and not user-friendly, flexible sensor technology has emerged as a promising and dynamic practice to collect important health information at a comparatively low cost in a reliable and user-friendly way.

{"title": "PVDF/MOFs mixed matrix ultrafiltration membrane for efficient water treatment.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), with excellent mechanical strength, thermal stability and chemical corrosion resistance, has become an excellent material for separation membranes fabrication. However, the high hydrophobicity of PVDF membrane surface normally leads a decreased water permeability and serious membrane pollution, which ultimately result in low operational efficiency, short lifespan of membrane, high operation cost and other problems. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been widely applied for membrane modification due to its large specific surface area, large porosity and adjustable pore size. Currently, numerous MOFs have been synthesized and used to adjust the membrane separation properties. In this study, MIL-53(Al) were blended with PVDF casting solution to prepare ultrafiltration (UF) membrane through a phase separation technique. The optimal separation performance was achieved by varying the concentration of MIL-53(Al). The surface properties and microstructures of the as-prepared membranes with different MIL-53(Al) loading revealed that the incorporation of MIL-53(Al) enhanced the membrane hydrophilicity and increased the porosity and average pore size of the membrane.

{"title": "Mesowestern Blot: Simultaneous Analysis of Hundreds of Submicroliter Lysates.", "abstract": "Western blotting is a widely used technique for molecular-weight-resolved analysis of proteins and their posttranslational modifications, but high-throughput implementations of the standard slab gel arrangement are scarce. The previously developed Microwestern requires a piezoelectric pipetting instrument, which is not available for many labs. Here, we report the Mesowestern blot, which uses a 3D-printable gel casting mold to enable high-throughput Western blotting without piezoelectric pipetting and is compatible with the standard sample preparation and small (\u223c1 \u03bcL) sample sizes. The main tradeoffs are reduced molecular weight resolution and higher sample-to-sample CV, making it suitable for qualitative screening applications. The casted polyacrylamide gel contains 336, \u223c0.5 \u03bcL micropipette-loadable sample wells arranged within a standard microplate footprint. Polyacrylamide % can be altered to change molecular weight resolution profiles. Proof-of-concept experiments using both infrared-fluorescent molecular weight protein ladder and cell lysate (RIPA buffer) demonstrate that the protein loaded in Mesowestern gels is amenable to the standard Western blotting steps. The main difference between Mesowestern and traditional Western is that semidry horizontal instead of immersed vertical gel electrophoresis is used. The linear range of detection is at least 32-fold, and at least \u223c500 attomols of \u03b2-actin can be detected (\u223c29 ng of total protein from mammalian cell lysates: \u223c100-300 cells). Because the gel mold is 3D-printable, users with access to additive manufacturing cores have significant design freedom for custom layouts.

In this study, vascular endothelial cells laden with thermosensitive bio-ink were bioprinted in situ on the inner surfaces of interconnected tubular channels of bone mesenchymal stem cell-laden 3D-bioprinted scaffolds. Endothelial cells exhibited a more uniform distribution and greater seeding efficiency throughout the channels. In vitro, the in situ bioprinted endothelial cells can form a vascular network through proliferation and migration. The in situ vascularized tissue-engineered bone also resulted in a coupling effect between angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of genes related to osteogenesis and angiogenesis is upregulated in biological processes. The in vivo 3D-bioprinted in situ vascularized scaffolds exhibited excellent performance in promoting new bone formation in rat calvarial critical-sized defect models.

Therefore, new protective materials with good filtration and antibacterial capabilities are required.\nIn this study, we prepared multi-scale polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibrous membranes for efficient filtration and durable antibacterial properties via N-halamine modification.\nThe N-halamine-modified nanofibrous membrane (PVDF-PAA-TMP-Cl) had sufficient active chlorine content (800\u00a0ppm), and the tensile stress and strain were improved compared with the original membrane, from 6.282 to 9.435\u00a0MPa and from 51.3\u00a0% to 56.4\u00a0%, respectively. To further improve the interception efficiency, ultrafine nanofibers (20-35\u00a0nm) were spun on PVDF-PAA-TMP-Cl nanofibrous membranes, and multi-scale PVDF-PAA-TMP-Cl nanofibrous membranes were prepared.

{"title": "Cellulose Nanofiber Films and Their Vibration Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "Cellulose, the most abundant sustainable material on Earth, has excellent mechanical and physical properties, high optical transparency, biocompatibility, and piezoelectricity. So, it has many possibilities for future materials, and many researchers are interested in its application. In this paper, cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and CNF/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films are made, and their vibration energy harvesting is studied. CNF was isolated by chemical and physical methods, and the CNF suspension was cast on a flat substrate to make a film. A cast CNF wet film stayed in a 5 Tesla superconductor magnet for 7 days, which resulted in CNF alignment perpendicular to the magnetic field. To further improve the mechanical properties of the CNF film, mechanical stretching was applied. The CNF suspension was mixed with PVA, giving the film toughness. The cast CNF/PVA wet film was mechanically stretched and dried, which improved the CNF alignment. The fabricated CNF and CNF/PVA films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to verify the alignment. By stretching, the aligned CNF/PVA film exhibits the largest mechanical properties along the aligned direction. The maximum Young's modulus and tensile strength of the 50% stretched CNF/PVA film are 14.9 GPa and 170.6 MPa, respectively. Finally, a vibration energy harvesting experiment was performed by invoking the piezoelectric behavior of the pure CNF, and 50% stretched CNF/PVA films. The harvester structure was innovated by adopting a cymbal structure, which was beneficial to producing large in-plane strain on the films. The designed cymbal structure was analyzed using ANSYS, and its natural frequency was experimentally verified. The CNF/PVA film performs better vibration energy harvesting than the pure CNF film.

We found that the system could image small structures with a diameter of 0.5 mm or more when using a 1 m-long tube (maximal signal intensity of 241 in 1 mm, 199 in 0.8 mm, and 133 in 0.5 mm). We also found that the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) appeared on 2-dimensional time-of-flight low-resolution imaging and that the flow velocity (10.03 cm/s) was similar to the actual velocity (11.01 cm/s in a flowmeter) when velocity encoding of 30 cm/s was used in a 0.8 mm-diameter tube.

{"title": "A Variable Kinematic Multifield Model for the Lamb Wave Propagation Analysis in Smart Panels.", "abstract": "The present paper assessed the use of variable kinematic two-dimensional elements in the dynamic analysis of Lamb waves propagation in an isotropic plate with piezo-patches. The multi-field finite element model used in this work was based on the Carrera Unified Formulation which offers a versatile application enabling the model to apply the desired order theory. The used variable kinematic model allowed for the kinematic model to vary in space, thereby providing the possibility to implement a classical plate model in collaboration with a refined kinematic model in selected areas where higher order kinematics are needed. The propagation of the symmetric (S0) and the antisymmetric (A0) fundamental lamb waves in an isotropic strip was considered in both mechanical and piezo-elastic plate models. The convergence of the models was discussed for different kinematics approaches, under different mesh refinement, and under different time steps. The results were compared to the exact solution proposed in the literature in order to assess and further determine the effects of the different parameters used when dynamically modeling a Lamb wave propagating in such material. It was shown that the higher order kinematic models delivered a higher accuracy of the propagating wave evaluated using the corresponding Time Of Flight (TOF). Upon using the appropriate mesh refinement of 2000 elements and sufficient time steps of 4000 steps, the error between the TOF obtained analytically and numerically using a high order kinematics was found to be less than 1% for both types of fundamental Lamb waves S0 and A0. Node-dependent kinematics models were also exploited in wave propagation to decrease the computational cost and to study their effect on the accuracy of the obtained results. The obtained results show, in both the mechanical and the piezo-electric models, that a reduction in the computational cost of up to 50% can be easily attained using such models while maintaining an error inferior to 1%.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-08-27", "authors": ["JamalNajd", "EnricoZappino", "ErasmoCarrera", "WalidHarizi", "ZoheirAboura"], "doi": "10.3390/s22166168\n10.1063/1.1699629\n10.1016/0041-624X(96)00024-8\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/5/019\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/1/015004\n10.3390/s18113958\n10.1121/1.1466870\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/2/310\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2011.01.025\n10.1016/j.measurement.2012.10.011\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.01.015\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2022.115466\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.01.020\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.10.044\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/8/085019\n10.1115/1.4050521\n10.1177/1475921720944933\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/1/015014\n10.1121/1.400530\n10.1016/S0963-8695(98)00045-0\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2009)22:2(185)\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.04.023\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000646\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2006.04.034\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2011.02.021\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/4/045017\n10.1016/j.jsv.2019.05.053\n10.1016/j.cma.2012.06.011\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(154)\n10.1177/1045389X17721045"}
{"title": "A Self-Powered Strain Sensor Applied to Real-Time Monitoring for Movable Structures.", "abstract": "This study uses near-field electrospinning (NFES) technology to make a novel self-powered strain sensor and applies it to the real-time monitoring of a bending structure, so that the measurement equipment can be reduced in volume. A self-powered strain sensor consists of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) fibers, a PDMS fixed substrate, and an aluminum electrode. PVDF fibers are spun with DMSO and acetone using NFES technology, with a diameter of about 8 \u03bcm, Young's modulus of 1.1 GPa, and piezoelectric effect of up to 230 mV. The fixed substrate is a film made of PDMS by thermal curing, then adhered to the PDMS film surface of the sheet Al metal as an Al electrode, and then combined with PVDF fiber film, to become a self-powered strain sensor. As a result, the XRD \u03b2 value of the self-powered strain sensor reaches 2112 and the sensitivity is increased by 20% over a traditional strain sensor. The cumulative angle algorithm can be applied to measure the angular change of the object over a unit of time or the cumulative displacement of the object over the entire period of motion. The experimental results demonstrate that the self-powered strain sensor combined with the angle accumulation algorithm may be applied to monitor the bending structure, thereby achieving continuous measurements of bending structure changes, and improving on traditional piezoelectric sensors, which can only be sensed once. In the future, self-powered strain sensors will have the ability to continuously measure in real-time, enabling the use of piezoelectric sensors for long-term monitoring of structural techniques.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-08-27", "authors": ["Yan-KueiWu", "Sheng-ChihShen", "Chun-YenLee", "Yen-JuChen"], "doi": "10.3390/s22166084\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2021.106593\n10.1016/j.mtchem.2021.100718\n10.1016/j.eml.2021.101279\n10.3390/s21248422\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104932\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.04.028\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112907\n10.1109/JSEN.2021.3094845\n10.1063/1.4979081\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.036\n10.1007/s12274-013-0328-4\n10.1016/j.mtcomm.2020.101629\n10.1016/j.matpr.2019.06.613\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105451\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2994552\n10.1016/j.mattod.2021.07.027\n10.1021/nl0602701\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.10.061\n10.1016/j.sna.2022.113580"}

First, using the piezoelectric inverse effect of the AE sensor, an arbitrary waveform generator was used to generate frequency-tunable pulses in the range of 1 kHz to 150 kHz as the AE source, where the AE source energy could be regulated by the output voltage level. Then, five AE sensors were placed at equal intervals of 100 mm on the surface of the specimen to collect AE signals, and the sampling frequency was set to 500 kHz. Finally, the energy value of AE signal of each sensor was calculated based on the AC principle, and the energy attenuation model was established by exponential fitting. The results showed that both the amplitude and energy of the AE signals of different frequencies showed negative exponential decay with the increase of propagation distance, and, at the same frequency, the change of AE source energy level had no significant effect on its attenuation rate.

{"title": "An Arterial Compliance Sensor for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Based on Piezoelectric and Optical Signals.", "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) data can influence therapeutic decisions for some patients, while non-invasive devices that continuously monitor BP can provide patients with a more comprehensive BP assessment. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-sensor-based small cuffless BP monitoring device that integrates a piezoelectric sensor array and an optical sensor, which can monitor the patient's physiological signals from the radial artery.\nBased on the Moens-Korteweg (MK) equation of the hemodynamic model, pulse wave velocity (PWV) can be correlated with arterial compliance and BP can be estimated. Therefore, the novel method proposed in this study involves using a piezoelectric sensor array to measure the PWV and an optical sensor to measure the photoplethysmography (PPG) intensity ratio (PIR) signal to estimate the participant's arterial parameters. The parameters measured by multiple sensors were combined to estimate BP based on the P-\u03b2 model derived from the MK equation.\nWe recruited 20 participants for the BP monitoring experiment to compare the performance of the BP estimation method with the regression model and the P-\u03b2 model method with arterial compliance. We then compared the estimated BP with a reference device for validation. The results are presented as the error mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Based on the regression model method, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 0.32 \u00b1 5.94, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 2.17 \u00b1 6.22, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 1.55 \u00b1 5.83.

{"title": "Anomalous Photocurrent Reversal Due to Hole Traps in AlGaN-Based Deep-Ultraviolet Light-Emitting Diodes.", "abstract": "The trap states and defects near the active region in deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LED) were investigated through wavelength-dependent photocurrent spectroscopy. We observed anomalous photocurrent reversal and its temporal recovery in AlGaN-based DUV LEDs as the wavelength of illuminating light varied from DUV to visible. The wavelength-dependent photocurrent measurements were performed on 265 nm-emitting DUV LEDs under zero-bias conditions. Sharp near-band-edge (~265 nm) absorption was observed in addition to broad (300-800 nm) visible-range absorption peaks in the photocurrent spectrum, while the current direction of these two peaks were opposite to each other. In addition, the current direction of the photocurrent in the visible wavelength range was reversed when a certain forward bias was applied. This bias-induced current reversal displayed a slow recovery time (~6 h) when the applied forward voltage was removed. Furthermore, the recovery time showed strong temperature dependency and was faster as the sample temperature increased. This result can be consistently explained by the presence of hole traps at the electron-blocking layer and the band bending caused by piezoelectric polarization fields.

{"title": "A Bridge-Shaped Vibration Energy Harvester with Resonance Frequency Tunability under DC Bias Electric Field.", "abstract": "A vibration piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) is usually designed with a resonance frequency at the external excitation frequency for higher energy conversion efficiency. Here, we proposed a bridge-shaped PEH capable of tuning its resonance frequency by applying a direct current (DC) electric field on piezoelectric elements. A theoretical model of the relationship between the resonance frequency and DC electric field was first established. Then, a verification experiment was carried out and the results revealed that the resonance frequency of the PEH can be tuned by applying a DC electric field to it. In the absence of an axial preload, the resonance frequency of the PEH can be changed by about 18.7 Hz under the DC electric field range from -0.25 kV/mm to 0.25 kV/mm. With an axial preload of 5 N and 10 N, the resonance frequency bandwidth of the PEH can be tuned to about 13.4 Hz and 11.2 Hz, respectively. Further experimental results indicate that the output power and charging response of the PEH can also be significantly enhanced under a DC electric field when the excitation frequency deviates from the resonance frequency.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-08-27", "authors": ["GuanDuan", "YingweiLi", "ChiTan"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13081227\n10.1016/j.rser.2019.109418\n10.1063/1.5074184\n10.1016/j.spmi.2020.106549\n10.1038/ncomms1454\n10.3390/s19173776\n10.1038/s41378-021-00248-z\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112743\n10.3390/mi12040436\n10.1016/j.egyr.2021.01.087\n10.3390/mi13020232\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118311\n10.1021/acsenergylett.1c00368\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.078\n10.1038/s41586-020-1985-6\n10.1177/1045389X17704917\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab36e4\n10.1002/aenm.202000137\n10.1109/TPEL.2007.904230\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.004\n10.1063/1.5089289\n10.1016/j.sna.2003.08.008\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561617\n10.1080/00150198208210604\n10.1063/1.5022599\n10.1016/j.renene.2021.03.064\n10.1177/1045389X9700801005\n10.1143/JJAP.48.091406"}
{"title": "Q-Factor Enhancement of Coupling Bragg and Local Resonance Band Gaps in Single-Phase Phononic Crystals for TPOS MEMS Resonator.", "abstract": "This paper presents a type of single-phase double \"I\" hole phononic crystal (DIH-PnC) structure, which is formed by vertically intersecting double \"I\" holes. By using the finite element method, the complex energy band curve, special point mode shapes, and different delay lines were calculated. Numerical results showed that DIH-PnC yielded ultra-wide band gaps with strong attenuation. The formation mechanism is attributed to the Bragg-coupled local resonance mechanism. The effects of the pore width in DIH-PnC on the band gaps were further explored numerically. Significantly, as the pore width variable, the position of the local resonance natural frequency could be modulated, and this enabled the coupling between the local resonance and the Bragg mechanism. Subsequently, we introduced this DIH-PnC into the thin-film piezoelectric-on-silicon (TPOS) resonator. The results illustrated that the anchor loss quality factor (Qanc) of the DIH-PnC resonator was 20,425.1% higher than that of the conventional resonator and 3762.3% higher than the Qanc of the cross-like holey PnC resonator.

One such factor is a notable ozone concentration which can be generated as a result of corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge, piezoelectric direct discharge, UV light photochemical processes, and others characteristic of the power industry. In this work, the mechanisms of degradation of the superhydrophobic coatings under prolonged exposure to high ozone concentrations at dynamic and nearly static conditions were studied. Our results indicate that in dynamic conditions, when the coatings are subjected to joint action of erosion loads initiated by the high-speed flow of the atmospheric air enriched with ozone, with ozone oxidation activity, the superhydrophobic state degrades quite rapidly. At the same time, in nearly static atmospheric conditions with the same ozone content, the degradation is substantially lower.

The graphene platelets (GPLs) are distributed in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a power function along the plate thickness direction to generate functionally gradient materials (FGMs). The modified Halpin-Tsai parallel model predicts the effective Young's modulus of each graphene-reinforced piezoelectric composite plate layer, and the rule of the mixture can be used to calculate the effective Poisson's ratio, mass density, and piezoelectric properties. Under different graphene distribution patterns and boundary conditions, the effects of a plate's geometric dimensions, GPLs' physical properties, GPLs' geometric properties and the elastic coefficient of the Winkler elastic foundation on deflections, frequencies and bucking loads of the FG-GRP plates are investigated in depth. The convergence and computational efficiency of the present IGA are confirmed versus other studies. Furthermore, the results illustrate that a small amount of GPL reinforcements can improve the FG-GRP plates' mechanical properties, i.e., GPLs can improve the system's vibration and stability characteristics.

New test rigs have been developed and used to precisely investigate the possibility of using actuators in active foil bearings. Since their geometry and control methods differ, the measurement systems have been adapted accordingly. The actuators studied were piezoelectrics, shape-memory alloys (SMAs) and stepper motors.

The efficiency of molybdenum trade effluent treatment is low and it is difficult to extract and recycle. To solve this problem, a novel membrane chemical reactor with mixed organic-water solvent(MCR-OW) had been used for the investigation of impact factors on the migration characteristics of Mo(VI) in the simulated trade effluent. The novel MCR-OW contains three parts, such as feeding pool, reacting pool and renewal pool. Flat membrane of polyvinylidene fluoride(PVDF) membrane was used in the reacting pool, the mixed solutions of diesel and NaOH with N, N'-di(1-methyl-pentyl)-acetamide(N-503) as the carrier in the renewal pool and the simulated trade effluent with Mo(VI) as feeding solution. The influencing factors of pH and the ion strength in the feeding solutions, the volume ratio of diesel to NaOH solution and N-503 concentration in the renewal solutions were investigated for the testing of the migration efficiency of Mo(VI). It was found that the migration efficiency of Mo(VI) could reach 94.3% in 225 min, when the concentration of carrier(N-503) was 0.21 mol/L, the volume ratio of diesel to NaOH in the renewal pool was 4:3, pH in the feeding pool was 3.80 and the initial concentration of Mo(VI) was 2.50 \u00d7 10", "journal": "Toxics", "date": "2022-08-26", "authors": ["LiangPei", "LiyingSun"], "doi": "10.3390/toxics10080438\n10.1080/00206810903053902\n10.1080/00206814.2013.774195\n10.1016/j.oregeorev.2020.103643\n10.1007/s40436-019-00282-1\n10.1007/s00128-015-1695-1\n10.1007/s00128-018-2443-0\n10.3390/min8070288\n10.15244/pjoes/83693\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111631\n10.1007/s10311-021-01365-x\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152370\n10.1139/s05-021\n10.1021/acs.est.9b06869\n10.1016/j.hydromet.2016.05.003\n10.1007/s10163-018-0811-9\n10.1007/s11837-019-03915-9\n10.2320/matertrans.M2012208\n10.1515/gps-2015-0033\n10.2116/analsci.14.621\n10.1007/s11468-015-0053-9\n10.2166/wst.2013.067\n10.1016/j.cep.2020.107958\n10.1016/j.envpol.2008.12.003\n10.2166/wst.2022.035\n10.1016/S0043-1354(98)00475-8\n10.1016/j.hydromet.2019.04.006\n10.1016/j.hydromet.2020.105401\n10.1007/s12010-020-03468-7\n10.2166/wst.2001.0109\n10.1007/s11783-013-0540-1\n10.1016/j.seppur.2008.10.043\n10.1016/j.mineng.2004.05.011\n10.1007/s11696-019-00868-w\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135634\n10.1002/elps.201800529\n10.1134/S1070427217040061\n10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.090\n10.1016/j.molliq.2019.111793\n10.1139/v01-106"}

The compatibility of PVDF and PEI was evaluated by analyzing the physical structure and properties of the blend membrane, the microstructure, the glass transition temperature Tg, the enthalpy, and the mechanism of the polymer blend enthalpy change. The results show that the blend membranes have -NH and C=O-N binding energies at X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which preliminarily proves that fluorine-amine bonds are formed between the polymers, and new spectra appeared by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks, which further proves that the two have the formation of fluorine-amine bonds, the Tg and enthalpy of the mixed membrane was increased, and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) observed that the membrane pores changed from finger-like pores to sponge-like macropores. When the content of PEI is 15%, the performance of the blended membrane is the best, the water contact angle increases to 58.5\u00b0, the porosity increases to 17.33%, the maximum force increases to 8.04 N, and the elongation at break decreases to 24.26%, the pure water flux is 1870.292 L/m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-08-26", "authors": ["MingGao", "YuanluZhu", "JiangyiYan", "WeixingWu", "BeifuWang"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12080809\n10.1007/s10008-021-05010-z\n10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2019.03.018\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.03.013\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.09.026\n10.5004/dwt.2019.24611\n10.18517/ijaseit.6.5.911\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2019.03.001\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118017\n10.3390/polym10101134\n10.1002/adfm.201804121\n10.1016/j.seppur.2021.118316\n10.1002/chem.202002543\n10.1016/j.desal.2018.10.019\n10.1016/j.seppur.2021.118388\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116745\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2020.108204\n10.1007/s11814-021-0845-x\n10.18517/ijaseit.10.6.7526\n10.1177/0967391120984606\n10.3390/polym12122765\n10.31788/RJC.2019.1225104\n10.12989/mwt.2014.5.2.109\n10.1111/j.2164-0947.1967.tb02297.x"}

{"title": "Mechanical Sensors for Cardiovascular Monitoring: From Battery-Powered to Self-Powered.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Long-term and real-time monitoring of cardiovascular indicators is required to detect abnormalities and conduct early intervention in time. To this end, the development of flexible wearable/implantable sensors for real-time monitoring of various vital signs has aroused extensive interest among researchers. Among the different kinds of sensors, mechanical sensors can reflect the direct information of pressure fluctuations in the cardiovascular system with the advantages of high sensitivity and suitable flexibility. Herein, we first introduce the recent advances of four kinds of mechanical sensors for cardiovascular system monitoring, based on capacitive, piezoresistive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric principles. Then, the physio-mechanical mechanisms in the cardiovascular system and their monitoring are described, including pulse wave, blood pressure, heart rhythm, endocardial pressure, etc. Finally, we emphasize the importance of real-time physiological monitoring in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and discuss its challenges in clinical translation.", "journal": "Biosensors", "date": "2022-08-26", "authors": ["ChuyuTang", "ZhirongLiu", "LinlinLi"], "doi": "10.3390/bios12080651\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31820a55f5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00490.2012\n10.1038/s41569-020-0426-4\n10.1161/01.STR.0000199147.30016.74\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000002819\n10.1146/annurev-med-050919-031534\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.02.023\n10.1586/erd.12.18\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01853-3\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.01.061\n10.2471/BLT.08.062364\n10.1038/nmat2834\n10.1002/adma.201303570\n10.1002/adma.201403807\n10.1039/C7TB01439B\n10.1021/acsami.9b03261\n10.1186/s12938-018-0551-z\n10.1007/s42765-021-00121-8\n10.1161/HYP.0000000000000087\n10.3390/s20164484\n10.1002/adfm.201808509\n10.1002/adma.202109357\n10.1002/adma.202103320\n10.1002/smll.201801657\n10.1002/adhm.201900109\n10.1038/s41427-018-0031-8\n10.1021/acsami.6b07833\n10.1063/1.4972478\n10.1002/adfm.201903162\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.003\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106257\n10.1002/adma.201807795\n10.1002/aenm.201802906\n10.1021/acsnano.0c06100\n10.1126/sciadv.abi4563\n10.1002/adma.201502535\n10.1186/s13054-018-2171-1\n10.1002/adfm.201805045\n10.1021/acsnano.1c06695\n10.1002/adma.201702308\n10.1002/adma.201703456\n10.1002/adfm.202102378\n10.1002/phar.1167\n10.1111/jch.14128\n10.1517/14796678.1.1.69\n10.1002/adma.202110291\n10.1002/adma.202104178\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105614\n10.1002/adfm.201806388\n10.1038/s41528-020-00090-9\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000001038\n10.1089/ten.teb.2015.0100\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.685313\n10.1016/j.jvs.2006.10.049\n10.1038/s41551-018-0336-5\n10.1126/sciadv.abm1175\n10.1002/adfm.202002868\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106074\n10.1002/adma.202106317\n10.3390/nanoenergyadv2010005\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.037\n10.1021/acsnano.9b02483\n10.1002/adma.202006093\n10.1002/adma.202102302\n10.1021/accountsmr.1c00078\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.088971\n10.1002/adfm.201807560\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106507\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01968\n10.1002/adhm.202000053\n10.1021/acsnano.8b08567\n10.1038/s41467-019-09851-1\n10.1007/s10877-022-00848-8\n10.1093/bja/aeu447\n10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181f08a5b\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000003553\n10.1016/j.bja.2020.09.049\n10.7717/peerj.4132\n10.19756/j.issn.0253-3820.211247\n10.1002/adma.201504366\n10.1002/EXP.20210029"}
{"title": "Recent Advances in Stretchable and Wearable Capacitive Electrophysiological Sensors for Long-Term Health Monitoring.", "abstract": "Over the past several years, wearable electrophysiological sensors with stretchability have received significant research attention because of their capability to continuously monitor electrophysiological signals from the human body with minimal body motion artifacts, long-term tracking, and comfort for real-time health monitoring. Among the four different sensors, i.e., piezoresistive, piezoelectric, iontronic, and capacitive, capacitive sensors are the most advantageous owing to their reusability, high durability, device sterilization ability, and minimum leakage currents between the electrode and the body to reduce the health risk arising from any short circuit. This review focuses on the development of wearable, flexible capacitive sensors for monitoring electrophysiological conditions, including the electrode materials and configuration, the sensing mechanisms, and the fabrication strategies. In addition, several design strategies of flexible/stretchable electrodes, body-to-electrode signal transduction, and measurements have been critically evaluated. We have also highlighted the gaps and opportunities needed for enhancing the suitability and practical applicability of wearable capacitive sensors. Finally, the potential applications, research challenges, and future research directions on stretchable and wearable capacitive sensors are outlined in this review.", "journal": "Biosensors", "date":

{"title": "Use of Cysteamine and Glutaraldehyde Chemicals for Robust Functionalization of Substrates with Protein Biomarkers-An Overview on the Construction of Biosensors with Different Transductions.", "abstract": "Currently, several biosensors are reported to confirm the absence/presence of an abnormal level of specific human biomarkers in research laboratories. Unfortunately, public marketing and/or pharmacy accessibility are not yet possible for many bodily fluid biomarkers. The questions are numerous, starting from the preparation of the substrates, the wet/dry form of recognizing the (bio)ligands, the exposure time, and the choice of the running buffers. In this context, for the first time, the present overview summarizes the pre-functionalization of standard and nanostructured solid/flexible supports with cysteamine (Cys) and glutaraldehyde (GA) chemicals for robust protein immobilization and detection of biomarkers in body fluids (serum, saliva, and urine) using three transductions: piezoelectrical, electrochemical, and optical, respectively.

This article aims to review the necessary specifications for a viable TICI. An overview of the remaining challenges when designing TICIs will be provided, focusing on energy supply and implantable microphones.\nThe literature review highlights how research efforts to generate sufficient power to supply a fully implantable CI could take advantage of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based energy harvesters incorporating piezoelectric materials. Using one of the various energy sources in the vicinity of the temporal bone would allow the development of a self-sufficient implant, overcoming the limitations of electrochemical batteries. Middle ear implantable microphones could also use similar fabrication techniques and transduction mechanisms to meet the sensor requirements for a TICI.\nRecent breakthroughs in power supply using MEMS-based energy harvesting technologies and piezoelectric implantable microphones may make TICIs become a more practical reality in the foreseeable future.

{"title": "A study of degradation mechanisms in PVDF-based photovoltaic backsheets.", "abstract": "Commercial backsheets based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) can experience premature field failures in the form of outer layer cracking. This work seeks to provide a better understanding of the changes in material properties that lead to crack formation and find appropriate accelerated tests to replicate them. The PVDF-based backsheet outer layer can have a different structure and composition, and is often blended with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer. We observed depletion of PMMA upon aging with sequential (MAST) and combined (C-AST) accelerated stress testing. In field-aged samples from Arizona and India, where PVDF crystallizes in its predominant \u03b1-phase, the degree of crystallinity greatly increased. MAST and C-AST protocols were, to some extent, able to replicate the increase in crystallinity seen in PVDF after\u2009~\u20097\u00a0years in the field, but no single-stress test condition (UV, damp heat, thermal cycling) resulted in significant changes in the material properties. The MAST regimen used here was too extreme to produce realistic degradation, but the test was useful in discovering weaknesses of the particular PVDF-based outer layer structure studied. No excessive \u03b2-phase formation was observed after aging with any test condition; however, the presence of \u03b2-phase was identified locally by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We conclude that both MAST and C-AST are relevant tests for screening outdoor failure mechanisms in PVDF backsheets, as they were successful in producing material degradation that led to cracking.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-08-25", "authors": ["So\u0148aUli\u010dn\u00e1", "MichaelOwen-Bellini", "Stephanie LMoffitt", "ArchanaSinha", "JaredTracy", "KaushikRoy-Choudhury", "David CMiller", "PeterHacke", "Laura TSchelhas"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-18477-1\n10.1080/00150193.1991.11876614\n10.1007/s00289-021-03790-y\n10.1016/j.jfluchem.2005.01.008\n10.3390/polym10030228\n10.1016/S0142-9418(03)00003-5\n10.1515/msp-2015-0020\n10.1021/ma00229a008\n10.1007/s10853-011-5618-1\n10.1088/0022-3727/28/2/028\n10.3390/polym13070998\n10.1038/pj.2013.53\n10.1016/j.solmat.2021.111044\n10.1109/JPHOTOV.2014.2305472\n10.1002/pip.3342\n10.1002/pip.3144\n10.1107/S0021889813003531\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2018.11.036\n10.1039/c7ra01267e\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.07.051\n10.1016/j.solmat.2012.05.043\n10.1016/j.solener.2005.02.008\n10.1002/app.1991.070430314\n10.1109/JPHOTOV.2021.3090152\n10.1002/app.42093\n10.1109/PVSC40753.2019.9198979\n10.1016/j.polymer.2014.03.055\n10.1021/ma050390f"}

MiGriBot combines in a single robot the benefits of a parallel kinematic architecture with a configurable platform and the use of soft joints at the millimeter scale. The configurable platform of the robot provides an internal degree of freedom that can be used to actuate microtweezers using piezoelectric bending actuators located at the base of the robot, which notably reduces the robot's inertia. The soft joints make it possible to miniaturize the mechanism and to avoid friction.

The system filled with 1 wt % THDA (CP1) was proved to possess balanced cross-linking density and crystallinity, which would play a crucial role in achieving a switchable piezoelectric effect.

{"title": "Two- and three-dimensional piezoelectric scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The incidence of bone disorders worldwide is increasing. For this reason, new and more effective strategies for bone repair are needed. The most common strategy used for cell regeneration relies in biochemical stimulation while biophysical stimulation using mechanical, and electrical cues is a promising, however, still under-investigated field. This work reports on the development of piezoelectric 2D and 3D porous scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration strategies. While the porous scaffolds mimic the bone's structure, the piezoelectric activity of the scaffolds mimics the bone mechano-electric microenvironment. The piezoelectric activity is related to the electroactive \u03b2-phase of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in the scaffolds and was dynamically stimulated by cell culture in a custom-made mechanical bioreactor. These two factors combined provide an effective biomimetic environment for the proliferation of preosteoblasts. The electromechanically-responsive scaffolds are found to promote the enhancement of proliferation rate of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells in about 20\u00a0% as well as an improved adhesion and proliferation over the materials, mainly when dynamically stimulated. These results prove that local piezoelectric effect, as the one existing in bone tissue, allows effective cell proliferation, which could be further translated in more efficient strategies for bone tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Colloids and surfaces.

Nevertheless, it is still difficult to directly extract SNFs from natural silk fibers due to their high crystallinity and recalcitrant complex structures. In the present study, a dilute alkali-assisted separation of high-yield SNFs is proposed. The degummed silk was first treated with a tiny amount of alkali at a mild temperature, followed by high-pressure homogenization. Under the optimized conditions (2% sodium hydroxide, 0 \u00b0C, 48 h), SNFs with diameters of 8-42 nm and lengths of 0.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcm were prepared with yields higher than 75%, which retained the natural structures at the nanoscale and some inherent properties of silk fibers. Interestingly, SNFs can be used as a stabilizing matrix to assist carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to disperse, aiming to form a uniform and stable CNT/SNF dispersion. Thereafter, a strong and flexible conductive composite film was fabricated with good mechanical properties. The composite film showed good piezoelectric properties and electric thermal response, which has promising application prospects for SNFs, such as in optical devices, nanoelectronics, and biosensors.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2022-08-20", "authors": ["MengyueShi", "YanleiHu", "XinLuo", "LiangLiu", "JuanYu", "YiminFan"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c00667"}

Porphyrin-incorporated FFs are also formed as piezoelectric nanostructures well aligned on the substrate through self-assembly, and their piezoelectric properties are comparable to those of FF. The FF-based PENG degrades in only 5 min, whereas the FF-porphyrin-based PENG produces a stable output for >15 min in phosphate-buffered saline.

{"title": "Stability Bounds for Micron Scale Ag Conductor Lines Produced by Electrohydrodynamic Inkjet Printing.", "abstract": "Continuous conducting lines of width 5-20 \u03bcm have been printed with a Ag nanoparticle ink using drop-on-demand (DOD) electrohydrodynamic (EHD) inkjet printing on Si and PDMS substrates, with advancing contact angles of 11\u00b0 and 35\u00b0, respectively, and a zero receding contact angle. It is only possible to achieve stable parallel sided lines within a limited range of drop spacings, and this limiting range for stable line printing decreases as the contact angle of the ink on the substrate increases. The upper bound drop spacing for stable line formation is determined by a minimum drop overlap required to prevent contact line retraction, and the lower bound is governed by competing flows for drop spreading onto an unwetted substrate and a return flow driven by a Laplace pressure difference between the newly deposited drops and the fluid some distance from the growing tip. The upper and lower bounds are shown to be consistent with those predicted using existing models for the stability of inkjet printed lines produced using piezoelectric droplet generators. A comparison with literature data for EHD printed lines finds that these limiting bounds apply with printed line widths as small as 200 nm using subfemtoliter drop volumes. When a fine grid pattern is printed, local differences in Laplace pressure lead to the line width retracting to the minimum stable width and excess ink being transported to the nodes of the grid. After printing and sintering, the printed tracks have a conductivity of about 15%-20% of bulk Ag on the Si substrate, which correlates with a porosity of about 60%.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-08-19", "authors": ["JinxinYang", "PeiHe", "BrianDerby"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c11133\n10.1126/science.290.5499.2123\n10.1002/adma.200300385\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.2001.tb01045.x\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c01296\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104502\n10.1098/rspa.1964.0151\n10.1038/nmat1974\n10.1002/smll.201500593\n10.1002/adfm.201503705\n10.1038/s41598-019-45504-5\n10.1039/C7NR09570H\n10.1016/j.orgel.2019.03.025\n10.1021/acsami.8b04051\n10.1021/jacs.6b02952\n10.1021/bm201126j\n10.1021/ac302463p\n10.1088/1758-5090/abd158\n10.1016/S1387-3806(98)14025-3\n10.1063/1.2356891\n10.1063/1.3020719\n10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2012.11.025\n10.1063/1.4902241\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa7c6b\n10.1007/s00339-014-8650-6\n10.1063/1.5031950\n10.1017/S0022112080000110\n10.1021/la7026847\n10.1007/s10853-006-6653-1\n10.1021/la101296e\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01928\n10.1016/j.elstat.2013.12.002\n10.1063/1.4905387\n10.1007/s11431-012-4843-4\n10.1016/j.rcim.2015.09.010\n10.1016/j.jmsy.2014.07.005\n10.1038/ncomms1891\n10.1007/s13391-019-00155-6\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2011.10.024\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/6/065012\n10.1149/1945-7111/ab9c7e\n10.1021/nn5022605\n10.1017/S0022112002003117\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2013.12.040\n10.1039/C7TC04114D\n10.1021/acsaelm.0c00747\n10.1063/1.3176952\n10.1115/1.4033903"}
{"title": "Mechanical Force Directs Proliferation and Differentiation of Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Stem cells have attracted much attention in the field of regeneration due to their unique ability to promote regeneration. Among the many approaches used to regulate directed proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, application of mechanical forces is safe, simple, and easy to implement, all of which are advantageous to practical applications. In this review, the mechanisms of mechanical regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation are summarized with emphasis on force transduction pathways from the extracellular matrix to the nucleus. Prospects for future clinical applications are also discussed. In conclusion, through specific signaling pathways, mechanical signals ultimately affect gene expression and thus guide cell fate. Mechanical factors can regulate proliferation and differentiation of stem cells through signaling pathways, a greater understanding of which will contribute to future research and applications of cell regeneration therapy. Impact statement Mechanical mechanics is vital for the regulation of cell fate; especially in the field of regenerative medicine, mechanical control has characteristics that are simple and comparable. Mechanically regulated pathways exist widely in cells and are distributed at various structural levels of cells. In this review, we categorized the mechanical regulatory pathways through the clue of the mechanical transmission.

With the emergence of attached cultivation systems, this study aims to promote a cost-effective approach for sustainable cultivation of microalgae, Navicula incerta, by pre-coating the main substrates, commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with its own washed algal cells and self-produced soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) for strengthened biofilm development. The effects of pH value (6 to 9), cell suspension volume (10 to 30\u00a0mL), and EPS volume (10 to 50\u00a0mL) were statistically optimized by means of response surface methodology toolkit. Model outputs revealed good agreement with cell adhesion data variation less than 1% at optimized pre-coating conditions (7.20 pH, 30\u00a0mL cell suspension volume, and 50\u00a0mL EPS volume). Throughout long-term biofilm cultivation, results demonstrated that EPS pre-coating substantially improved the attached microalgae density by as high as 271% than pristine PVDF due to rougher surface and the presence of sticky exopolymer particles. Nutrients absorbed via the available EPS coating from the bulk medium made the immobilized cells to release less polysaccharides on an average of 30% less than uncoated PVDF.

The resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) can determine full material constants of a single piezoelectric sample by matching the numerically computed eigenfrequencies to the measured resonance spectrum. However, typically the usage of PZT transducers for excitation and reception makes the testing complicated and may add additional mass and damping. In this work, we propose a new method called partial electrode electromechanical impedance spectroscopy (PE-EMIS), which can obtain all the elastic, piezoelectric constants, and related internal frictions of a piezoelectric crystal by just using a single sample without additional transducers. In PE-EMIS, two small PEs are fabricated on one corner of a piezoelectric sample, and the sample's resonance frequencies, along with the internal frictions of the k th eigenmode, can be accurately obtained from the conductance spectrum measured using an impedance analyzer. The PE-EMIS experiment is carried out on a rectangular parallelepiped PZT-4 piezoelectric ceramic, and the extracted material constants are highly repeatable.

TF was observed in all 51 AT samples (ranges of 16-313, 12-310, and 24-661 \u03bcg of F/g in backing, filling, and blades, respectively), while EOF and target PFAS occurred in <42% of all samples (<200 and <1 ng of F/g, respectively).

Moreover, application of the total oxidizable precursor assay revealed negligible perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) formation across all three sample types, indicating that the fluorinated substances in AT are not low-molecular weight PFAA precursors. Collectively, these results point toward polymeric organofluorine (e.g., fluoroelastomer, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polyvinylidene fluoride), consistent with patent literature.

{"title": "How the mechanical microenvironment of stem cell growth affects their differentiation: a review.", "abstract": "Stem cell differentiation is of great interest in medical research; however, specifically and effectively regulating stem cell differentiation is still a challenge. In addition to chemical factors, physical signals are an important component of the stem cell ecotone. The mechanical microenvironment of stem cells has a huge role in stem cell differentiation. Herein, we describe the knowledge accumulated to date on the mechanical environment in which stem cells exist, which consists of various factors, including the extracellular matrix and topology, substrate stiffness, shear stress, hydrostatic pressure, tension, and microgravity. We then detail the currently known signalling pathways that stem cells use to perceive the mechanical environment, including those involving nuclear factor-kB, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the piezoelectric mechanosensitive ion channel, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1. Using this information in clinical settings to treat diseases is the goal of this research, and we describe the progress that has been made.

The aim of this review is to explore the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of this instrument in comparison to the drill.\nWe conducted a\u00a0search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations. The primary selection included all studies reporting on the use of PEI in ear surgery or its effect on the inner ear. Only studies with a\u00a0control group were included in the secondary selection.\nThe first search identified 49\u00a0studies between 2003 and 2022. These reported on a\u00a0total of 1162\u00a0ear operations, during which PEI was used for various indications. Most data were based on uncontrolled retrospective studies or case reports (76%). Only one of the five controlled clinical studies was prospective and randomized. The advantages of PEI weighed against its limitations and disadvantages were critically analyzed in comparison to the drill.\nPiezoelectric surgery is an innovative and promising surgical technique in the temporal bone. PEI appears to enable safer and more precise bone removal in close proximity to soft tissue when compared to the drill. The slower bone removal and cost factors represent current limitations to its wider use in ear surgery.\nHINTERGRUND: Durch die Kombination aus Mikrooszillationen und Kavitation bietet das piezoelektrische Instrument (PEI) eine f\u00fcr die Ohrchirurgie neuartige Technologie zur Knochenabtragung.

{"title": "Researching progress on bio-reactive electrogenic materials with electrophysiological activity for enhanced bone regeneration.", "abstract": "Bone tissues are dynamically reconstructed during the entire life cycle phase, which is an exquisitely regulated process controlled by intracellular and intercellular signals transmitted through physicochemical and biochemical stimulation. Recently, the role of electrical activity in promoting bone regeneration has attracted great attention, making the design, fabrication, and selection of bioelectric bio-reactive materials a focus. Under specific conditions, piezoelectric, photoelectric, magnetoelectric, acoustoelectric, and thermoelectric materials can generate bioelectric signals similar to those of natural tissues and stimulate osteogenesis-related signaling pathways to enhance the regeneration of bone defects, which can be used for designing novel smart biological materials for engineering tissue regeneration. However, literature summarizing studies relevant to bioelectric materials for bone regeneration is rare to our knowledge. Consequently, this review is mainly focused on the biological mechanism of electrical stimulation in the regeneration of bone defects, the current state and future prospects of piezoelectric materials, and other bioelectric active materials suitable for bone tissue engineering in recent studies, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for novel clinical treatment strategies for bone defects.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["ShaojieDong", "YuweiZhang", "YukunMei", "YifeiZhang", "YaqiHao", "BeileiLiang", "WeijiangDong", "RuiZou", "LinNiu"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2022.921284\n10.1002/jbm.a.35390\n10.1089/bioe.2020.0027\n10.3390/polym13213790\n10.3390/coatings8070244\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2019.107468\n10.1002/adma.201802084\n10.1103/physrevlett.104.037204\n10.1166/jnn.2008.18375\n10.1615/critrevbiomedeng.2021035327\n10.1007/s12221-019-8702-9\n10.1093/nsr/nwz023\n10.1093/nsr/nwz023\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.148\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.04.118\n10.1088/1674-1056/27/4/047210\n10.1038/natrevmats.2016.46\n10.1016/s0167-577x(99)00020-8\n10.1021/acsnano.9b08115\n10.1143/jjap.37.2775\n10.1143/jjap.3.502b\n10.1038/s41578-020-0209-x\n10.1016/j.carbon.2021.08.040\n10.31436/iiumej.v22i1.1548\n10.1002/jbm.a.30251\n10.1098/rsif.2007.1274\n10.1023/a:1013671526975\n10.1186/s40824-020-0185-7\n10.1186/s41232-018-0059-8\n10.1021/acsabm.9b00667\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b00297\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0638\n10.1021/jacs.8b03001\n10.1002/adfm.201909045\n10.1002/mds3.10090\n10.1002/adma.201906989\n10.1021/ma060261e\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.03.002\n10.1038/s41467-019-09707-8\n10.1088/2053-1591/ac0364\n10.1002/smll.201901116\n10.3390/nano9070952\n10.1016/j.apmt.2021.101254\n10.1039/c3ra43499k\n10.1039/c0nr00323a\n10.1002/1097-4636(20011205)57:3<366:aid-jbm1179>3.0.co;2-x\n10.1007/bf00045712\n10.1134/s1063782618150083\n10.3747/co.2007.110\n10.1038/s41563-018-0060-2\n10.1016/j.msec.2013.12.008\n10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c00767\n10.1088/1361-6463/aab3ec\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.01.006\n10.1089/107632700418074\n10.1136/jnnp.2004.050286\n10.3390/ijms21186944\n10.1038/nature03028\n10.3390/jcs4040191\n10.1002/jbm.b.34884\n10.1038/nmat2090\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112470\n10.1016/j.jphotochemrev.2021.100420\n10.1016/s1470-2045(20)30559-3\n10.1038/s41467-020-19125-w\n10.1515/nanoph-2021-0119\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.11.023\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.04.014\n10.1002/adma.202108325\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120314\n10.1038/s41413-021-00180-y\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120977\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126510\n10.1021/ar400290f\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.06.010\n10.1063/5.0055475\n10.1021/cm9602858\n10.1002/aenm.201701797\n10.1088/0022-3727/40/18/042\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120997\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.056\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.01.004\n10.3390/polym12112754\n10.1002/adhm.201701466\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01276\n10.1049/iet-nde.2018.0039\n10.1021/acsnano.6b02284\n10.1088/1361-6528/abe156\n10.1039/c8nr04883e\n10.1038/s41563-020-00884-2\n10.3389/fmats.2021.790753\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.12.008"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from Low-Frequency Vibrations Based on Magnetic Plucking and Indirect Impacts.", "abstract": "This work proposes a mono-axial piezoelectric energy harvester based on the innovative combination of magnetic plucking and indirect impacts, e.g., impacts happening on the package of the harvester. The harvester exploits a permanent magnet placed on a non-magnetic mass, free to move within a predefined bounded region located in front of a piezoelectric bimorph cantilever equipped with a magnet as the tip mass. When the harvester is subjected to a low-frequency external acceleration, the moving mass induces an abrupt deflection and release of the cantilever by means of magnetic coupling, followed by impacts of the same mass against the harvester package. The combined effect of magnetic plucking and indirect impacts induces a frequency up-conversion. A prototype has been designed, fabricated, fastened to the wrist of a person by means of a wristband, and experimentally tested for different motion levels. By setting the magnets in a repulsive configuration, after 50 s of consecutive impacts induced by shaking, an energy of 253.41 \u03bcJ has been stored: this value is seven times higher compared to the case of harvester subjected to indirect impacts only, i.e., without magnetic coupling. This confirms that the combination of magnetic plucking and indirect impacts triggers the effective scavenging of electrical energy even from low-frequency non-periodical mechanical movements, such as human motion, while preserving the reliability of piezoelectric components.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["MicheleRosso", "AlessandroNastro", "MarcoBa\u00f9", "MarcoFerrari", "VittorioFerrari", "AlbertoCorigliano", "RaffaeleArdito"], "doi": "10.3390/s22155911\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111973\n10.1016/0021-9290(85)90043-0\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.12.032\n10.1080/10584580590964574\n10.3390/s22030772\n10.3390/mi10100701\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.076\n10.3390/app10103614\n10.34133/2019/1087946\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104986\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117577\n10.3390/en15082764\n10.1007/s11071-020-05594-7\n10.1007/s11071-020-06170-9\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025009\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.10.003\n10.1088/1361-665X/aac8ad\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085029\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/4/045008\n10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103173\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab9a8d\n10.3389/fmats.2016.00017\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.02.065\n10.1109/TMAG.1984.1063554\n10.1109/TMAG.2011.2122339\n10.1109/TMAG.2007.892316\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2020.166694\n10.1007/s11012-022-01481-0"}

To eliminate the localization bias caused by these errors, a calibrated 2D-MUSIC-based impact localization method is first introduced. Firstly, time-frequency characteristics of the non-stationary impact signals are evaluated by experiment to obtain a clear first wave packet or a wave packet that purely corresponds to a single mode through continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, the uniform linear array covariance matrix with gain-phase errors is calibrated to be constructed as a Toeplitz structural matrix. By reconstructing covariance matrix R, 2D-MUSIC-based impact localization is calibrated for stiffened curved composite structures.

{"title": "Active Ultrasonic Structural Health Monitoring Enabled by Piezoelectric Direct-Write Transducers and Edge Computing Process.", "abstract": "While the active ultrasonic method is an attractive structural health monitoring (SHM) technology, many practical issues such as weight of transducers and cables, energy consumption, reliability and cost of implementation are restraining its application. To overcome these challenges, an active ultrasonic SHM technology enabled by a direct-write transducer (DWT) array and edge computing process is proposed in this work. The operation feasibility of the monitoring function is demonstrated with Lamb wave excited and detected by a linear DWT array fabricated in situ from piezoelectric P(VDF-TrFE) polymer coating on an aluminum alloy plate with a simulated defect. The DWT array features lightweight, small profile, high conformability, and implementation scalability, whilst the edge-computing circuit dedicatedly designed for the active ultrasonic SHM is able to perform signal processing at the sensor nodes before wirelessly transmitting the data to a remote host device. The successful implementation of edge-computing processes is able to greatly decrease the amount of data to be transferred by 331 times and decrease the total energy consumption for the wireless module by 224 times. The results and analyses show that the combination of the piezoelectric DWT and edge-computing process provides a promising technical solution for realizing practical wireless active ultrasonic SHM system.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["Voon-KeanWong", "Sarbudeen MohamedRabeek", "Szu ChengLai", "MarilynePhilibert", "David Boon KiangLim", "ShutingChen", "Muthusamy KumarasamyRaja", "KuiYao"], "doi": "10.3390/s22155724\n10.3390/app11062750\n10.1088/1742-6596/2037/1/012110\n10.1016/j.matpr.2020.09.318\n10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104168\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2021.108282\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112330\n10.1016/j.prostr.2022.01.008\n10.33640/2405-609X.2408\n10.1109/COMST.2017.2691551\n10.1109/APMC46564.2019.9038809\n10.1063/5.0033952\n10.1016/j.csi.2021.103600\n10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103954\n10.1109/JIOT.2017.2664072\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111252\n10.1088/1757-899X/263/5/052029\n10.3390/s19020383\n10.1016/j.measurement.2020.108026\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.117495\n10.1002/stc.2849\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.03.003\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2021.100790\n10.3390/app11031071\n10.3390/s18113958\n10.1016/j.matpr.2019.12.048\n10.3390/aerospace5030087\n10.3390/s19235070\n10.1177/1475921714522842\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2768238\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab1e88\n10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3073131\n10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3176488\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2694454\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.102131\n10.1088/2631-8695/ab6b69\n10.1177/14759217211040719\n10.1177/14759217211073950\n10.1177/1475921719854528\n10.3390/vibration4030033\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108113\n10.1109/JPROC.2016.2547946\n10.22214/ijraset.2021.33068\n10.1109/TIE.2016.2598529\n10.3390/s21206760\n10.1002/advs.202103842\n10.3390/s21092929\n10.1109/APMC52720.2021.9661913"}
{"title": "Smart Active Vibration Control System of a Rotary Structure Using Piezoelectric Materials.", "abstract": "A smart active vibration control (AVC) system containing piezoelectric (PZT) actuators, jointly with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller, is proposed in this article to control transverse deflections of a wind turbine (WT) blade. In order to apply controlling rules to the WT blade, a state-of-the-art semi-analytical solution is developed to obtain WT blade lateral displacement under external loadings. The proposed method maps the WT blade to a Euler-Bernoulli beam under the same conditions to find the blade's vibration and dynamic responses by solving analytical vibration solutions of the Euler-Bernoulli beam. The governing equations of the beam with PZT patches are derived by integrating the PZT transducer vibration equations into the vibration equations of the Euler-Bernoulli beam structure. A finite element model of the WT blade with PZT patches is developed. Next, a unique transfer function matrix is derived by exciting the structures and achieving responses. The beam structure is projected to the blade using the transfer function matrix. The results obtained from the mapping method are compared with the counter of the blade's finite element model. A satisfying agreement is observed between the results. The results showed that the method's accuracy decreased as the sensors' distance from the base of the wind turbine increased. In the designing process of the LQR controller, various weighting factors are used to tune control actions of the AVC system. LQR optimal control gain is obtained by using the state-feedback control law. The PZT actuators are located at the same distance from each other an this effort to prevent neutralizing their actuating effects. The LQR shows significant performance by diminishing the weights on the control input in the cost function. The obtained results indicate that the proposed smart control system efficiently suppresses the vibration peaks along the WT blade and the maximum flap-wise displacement belonging to the tip of the structure is successfully controlled.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["AliHashemi", "JinwooJang", "ShahrokhHosseini-Hashemi"], "doi": "10.3390/s22155691\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.11.060\n10.1016/j.jsv.2019.05.052\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3035611\n10.2514/1.C035607\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab7541\n10.1177/10775463221099350\n10.3390/en14165145\n10.1016/j.marstruc.2021.102938\n10.1177/1077546319870933\n10.3390/s19030540\n10.3390/app11104526\n10.3390/ma15113907\n10.1177/1077546320957533\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.05.078\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2010.06.001\n10.3390/s130302997\n10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2011.03.017\n10.1016/S0020-7683(97)00065-6\n10.1016/S0022-460X(88)80024-5\n10.2514/3.20429\n10.2514/3.20460\n10.1115/1.2896354\n10.1007/s11804-012-1139-9\n10.1007/BF03184733\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.07.131\n10.3390/s21051654\n10.1002/we.2141\n10.1007/s11803-019-0515-8\n10.1017/S000192400000960X\n10.1177/0954410016675891\n10.1177/1099636217698443\n10.3390/s17081820\n10.1177/0957456520901355\n10.1016/j.jsv.2018.10.011\n10.1177/1077546315576431\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.03.026\n10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115204\n10.1016/j.jsv.2019.114961\n10.1007/s10483-019-2506-6\n10.1007/s11012-020-01236-9\n10.1016/j.tws.2017.06.018\n10.1088/0964-1726/9/1/311\n10.1177/1045389X14554134\n10.1007/s00773-020-00705-w\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2007.07.005\n10.1016/j.jsv.2007.10.027\n10.1080/15376494.2017.1387324\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.04.016\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000853\n10.1177/1077546319868883\n10.1177/1077546320980574\n10.3390/en14113058\n10.1515/secm-2021-0039\n10.1016/j.renene.2020.12.009\n10.3390/en14227536\n10.3390/infrastructures6110162\n10.1016/j.egyr.2022.03.083\n10.1177/0020294020983377\n10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.111474\n10.1177/1045389X20916804\n10.23967/j.rimni.2020.04.001\n10.1177/1045389X20948597\n10.3390/s21061941\n10.1002/adc2.48\n10.3390/s20102955\n10.1109/JIOT.2020.2990449\n10.1109/TAC.1998.705000\n10.1177/1687814020913782"}

{"title": "Cellular Mechanosensitivity: Validation of an Adaptable 3D-Printed Device for Microindentation.", "abstract": "Mechanotransduction refers to the cellular ability to sense mechanical stimuli from the surrounding environment and convert them into biochemical signals that regulate cellular physiology and homeostasis. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), especially ones of Piezo family (Piezo1 and Piezo2), play a crucial role in mechanotransduction. These transmembrane proteins directly react to mechanical cues by triggering the onset of an ionic current. The relevance of this mechanism in driving physiology and pathology is emerging, and there is a growing need for the identification of an affordable and reliable assay to measure it. Setting up a mechanosensitivity assay requires exerting a mechanical stimulus on single cells while observing the downstream effects of channels opening. We propose an open-hardware approach to stimulate single adherent cells through controlled microindentation, using a 3D-printed actuation platform. We validated the device by measuring the mechanosensitivity of a neural mice cell line where the expression level and activity of Piezo1 were genetically and pharmacologically manipulated. Moreover, this extremely versatile device could be integrated with different read-out technologies, offering a new tool to improve the understanding of mechanotransduction in living cells.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["GiulioCapponi", "MartinaZambito", "IgorNeri", "FrancescoCottone", "MaurizioMattarelli", "MassimoVassalli", "SilviaCaponi", "TullioFlorio"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12152691\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.816149\n10.1016/j.neuron.2018.09.046\n10.1038/s41586-019-1485-8\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1073/pnas.1804938115\n10.1016/j.bpc.2015.06.013\n10.1186/s13578-020-00522-z\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.7554/eLife.47454\n10.1038/s41467-019-14146-6\n10.1038/s41467-020-16026-w\n10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110070\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108225\n10.4161/chan.21064\n10.2174/1875397301206010087\n10.1101/702423\n10.3390/ijms23073763\n10.1038/s41467-018-04194-9\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00177\n10.1038/s41413-020-00124-y\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110796\n10.1006/excr.1999.4636\n10.1111/jnc.12004\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)83641-4\n10.1038/290527a0\n10.1124/mol.105.015255\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.120\n10.1152/physrev.00032.2008\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1364/OPEX.13.009361\n10.1007/978-1-62703-351-0_12\n10.1038/nprot.2011.343\n10.1364/OE.384207\n10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.02095.x\n10.1364/OL.24.000291\n10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79546-2\n10.1109/2944.577313\n10.1117/1.3431712\n10.1038/s41592-019-0686-2\n10.1085/jgp.201912515\n10.1038/s42003-020-01600-1"}

Zinc oxide NWs tend to incline due to geometric instability and because of the piezoelectric properties, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscope images. A cantilever bending model adequately describes the bending and bundling events, which are linked to the electrostatic interaction between nanowires. The light absorption of zinc oxide nanowires in the visible and near infrared bands has been modelled using the finite difference time domain method. The influence of the density of nanowires (25%, 50%, 75%) and the integration of plasmonic nanoparticles distributed on the seed layer (with varied radii) on the light absorption of zinc oxide nanowires was studied using simulation analysis. We have shown that the geometry of zinc oxide nanowires in terms of length, separation distance, and surface charge density affects the process of zinc oxide nanowires bending and bundling and that absorption will be maximized by integrating Au plasmonic nanoparticles with a radius of 10 nm.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-08-13", "authors": ["BasmaElZein", "AliElrashidi", "ElhadjDogheche", "GhassanJabbour"], "doi": "10.3390/ma15155358\n10.4236/oja.2015.54017\n10.1063/1.1883715\n10.1002/advs.201901637\n10.1016/S0040-6090(03)00243-8\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2018.10.026\n10.1557/mrs.2018.263\n10.1021/jp9045098\n10.1007/s11706-021-0565-5\n10.1021/nn800353q\n10.3390/ma13194427\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.12.014\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/11/015\n10.3390/app12052519\n10.3390/polym14050862\n10.1063/1.4766736"}
{"title": "Candle Soot-Based Electrosprayed Superhydrophobic Coatings for Self-Cleaning, Anti-Corrosion and Oil/Water Separation.", "abstract": "The interest in candle soot (CS)-based superhydrophobic coatings has grown rapidly in recent years. Here, a simple and low-cost process has been developed for the fabrication of CS-based superhydrophobic coatings through electrospraying of the composite cocktail solution of CS and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Results show that the superhydrophobicity of the coating closely relates to the loading amount of CS which results in coatings with different roughnesses. Specifically, increasing the CS amount (not more than 0.4 g) normally enhances the superhydrophobicity of the coating due to higher roughness being presented in the produced microspheres. Further experiments demonstrate that the superhydrophobicity induced in the electrosprayed coating results from the synergistic effect of the cocktail solution and electrospray process, indicating the importance of the coating technique and the solution used. Versatile applications of CS-based superhydrophobic coatings including self-cleaning, anti-corrosion and oil/water separation are demonstrated.

{"title": "How to discern external acoustic waves in a piezoelectric neuron under noise?", "abstract": "Biological neurons keep sensitive to external stimuli and appropriate firing modes can be triggered to give effective response to external chemical and physical signals. A piezoelectric neural circuit can perceive external voice and nonlinear vibration by generating equivalent piezoelectric voltage, which can generate an equivalent trans-membrane current for inducing a variety of firing modes in the neural activities. Biological neurons can receive external stimuli from more ion channels and synapse synchronously, but the further encoding and priority in mode selection are competitive. In particular, noisy disturbance and electromagnetic radiation make it more difficult in signals identification and mode selection in the firing patterns of neurons driven by multi-channel signals. In this paper, two different periodic signals accompanied by noise are used to excite the piezoelectric neural circuit, and the signal processing in the piezoelectric neuron driven by acoustic waves under noise is reproduced and explained. The physical energy of the piezoelectric neural circuit and Hamilton energy in the neuron driven by mixed signals are calculated to explain the biophysical mechanism of auditory neuron when external stimuli are applied. It is found that the neuron prefers to respond to the external stimulus with higher physical energy and the signal which can increase the Hamilton energy of the neuron. For example, stronger inputs used to inject higher energy and it is detected and responded more sensitively. The involvement of noise is helpful to detect the external signal under stochastic resonance, and the additive noise changes the excitability of neuron as the external stimulus. The results indicate that energy controls the firing patterns and mode selection in neurons, and it provides clues to control the neural activities by injecting appropriate energy into the neurons and network.", "journal": "Journal of biological physics", "date": "2022-08-11", "authors": ["YingXie", "JunMa"], "doi": "10.1007/s10867-022-09611-1\n10.1016/j.neuron.2019.09.007\n10.1016/j.conb.2010.03.009\n10.1016/S0378-5955(02)00393-3\n10.1038/ncomms14412\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2449-04.2004\n10.1088/1741-2560/13/5/056014\n10.1098/rstb.2016.0101\n10.1038/s41598-021-94876-0\n10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102966\n10.1016/j.neuron.2019.06.004\n10.1002/adma.201900903\n10.1093/cercor/bhab118\n10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110751\n10.1007/s11071-021-06770-z\n10.1631/jzus.A2100323\n10.1007/BF01053970\n10.1016/j.clinph.2003.09.014\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.2130\n10.1109/19.997828\n10.1103/PhysRevE.65.050902\n10.1063/1.1493096\n10.1142/S0217984921504339\n10.1007/s11571-018-09518-5\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.2.034009\n10.1038/nrn1668\n10.1038/nn1790\n10.1038/nrn3061\n10.1007/s004220000176\n10.1080/00107514.2011.639605\n10.1007/s11071-021-06247-z\n10.1007/s11431-020-1696-8\n10.1631/FITEE.1900606\n10.1088/1674-1056/ab9dee\n10.1016/j.neucom.2020.09.083\n10.1109/TCSII.2016.2641008\n10.1080/00207217.2018.1426122\n10.1631/FITEE.1900360\n10.1007/s11431-019-1458-5\n10.1007/s11431-020-1730-0\n10.1007/s11431-019-1547-5\n10.1016/j.cjph.2020.11.011\n10.1007/s11071-020-05991-y\n10.1007/s11071-021-06427-x\n10.1088/1674-1056/ac1fdc\n10.7498/aps.70.20210676\n10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00311-w\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110455\n10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111361\n10.1038/s41598-021-84230-9\n10.1142/S0218127410027076\n10.1109/81.295246\n10.1016/j.chaos.2022.112149\n10.1007/s11071-022-07282-0\n10.1631/FITEE.2100563\n10.1103/PhysRevE.69.011606\n10.1088/1674-1056/ac7bff\n10.1103/PhysRevE.74.011905"}

This in vitro study investigated eight debridement protocols across three implant surfaces to assess both biofilm removal and surface alterations.\nOne hundred sixty commercially pure titanium discs were treated to simulate commercially available titanium implant surfaces-smooth, abraded and abraded and etched. Following inoculation with whole human saliva to create a mixed species biofilm, the surfaces were treated with eight debridement methods currently used for clinical peri-implantitis (n\u00a0=\u00a010). This included air abrasion using powders of glycine, sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate; conventional mechanical methods-piezoelectric scaler, carbon and stainless steel scalers; and a chemical protocol using 40% citric acid. Following treatment, remaining biofilm was analysed using scanning electron microscopy and crystal violet assays. For statistical analysis, ANOVA was applied (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nAll debridement techniques resulted in greater than 80% reduction in biofilm compared with baseline, irrespective of the surface type. Glycine powder delivered through an air polishing system eliminated the most biofilm. Mechanical instruments were the least effective at eliminating biofilm across all surfaces and caused the greatest surface alterations. Citric acid was comparable with mechanical debridement instruments in terms of biofilm removal efficacy. Titanium surfaces were least affected by air abrasion protocols and most affected by mechanical methods.\nMechanical protocols for non-surgical debridement should be approached with caution.

{"title": "Novel identification and modulation of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel in human myometrium.", "abstract": "Approximately 10% of US births deliver preterm before 37\u00a0weeks of completed gestation. Premature infants are at risk for life-long debilitating morbidities and death, and spontaneous preterm labour explains 50% of preterm births. In all cases existing treatments are ineffective, and none are FDA approved. The mechanisms that initiate preterm labour are not well understood but may result from dysfunctional regulation of quiescence mechanisms. Human pregnancy is accompanied by large increases in blood flow, and the uterus must enlarge by orders of magnitude to accommodate the growing fetus. This mechanical strain suggests that stretch-activated channels may constitute a mechanism to explain gestational quiescence. Here we identify for the first time that Piezo1, a mechanosensitive cation channel, is present in the uterine smooth muscle and microvascular endothelium of pregnant myometrium. Piezo is downregulated during preterm labour, and stimulation of myometrial Piezo1 in an organ bath with the agonist Yoda1 relaxes the tissue in a dose-dependent fashion. Further, stimulation of Piezo1 while inhibiting protein kinase A, AKT, or endothelial nitric oxide synthase mutes the negative inotropic effects of Piezo1 activation, intimating that actions on the myocyte and endothelial nitric oxide signalling contribute to Piezo1-mediated contractile dynamics. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of stretch-activated channels in pregnancy maintenance and parturition, and identify Piezo1 as a tocolytic target of interest. KEY POINTS: Spontaneous preterm labour is a serious obstetric dilemma without a known cause or effective treatments. Piezo1 is a stretch-activated channel important to muscle contractile dynamics. Piezo1 is present in the myometrium and is dysregulated in women who experience preterm labour.

In this study, we evaluated whether low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) could enhance the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism. \nRats in the ADSC+LIPUS group achieved significantly higher ICP and ICP/MAP ratios than those in the DM, ADSC, and LIPUS groups.

In vitro experiments demonstrated that LIPUS promoted proliferation and cell cycle progression in ADSCs. The excretion of cytokines such as CXCL12, FGF2, and VEGF was also enhanced by LIPUS. Bioinformatic analysis based on RNA sequencing indicated that LIPUS stimulation might activate the MAPK pathway.

In the last few years, the remarkable capacity of Alg to form hydrogels and the electro-responsive properties of PEDOT have been combined to form not only layered composites (PEDOT-Alg) but also interpenetrated multi-responsive PEDOT/Alg hydrogels. These materials have been found to display outstanding properties, such as electrical conductivity, piezoelectricity, biocompatibility, self-healing and re-usability properties, pH and thermoelectric responsiveness, among others. Consequently, a wide number of applications are being proposed for PEDOT-Alg composites and, especially, PEDOT/Alg hydrogels, which should be considered as a new kind of hybrid material because of the very different chemical nature of the two polymeric components. This review summarizes the applications of PEDOT-Alg and PEDOT/Alg in tissue interfaces and regeneration, drug delivery, sensors, microfluidics, energy storage and evaporators for desalination.

To address this problem, we developed a multi-PVDF film-based tactile array finger cot to collect piezoelectric signals from the acupuncturist's finger-needle contact during manual acupuncture operations. In order to recognize the four typical TCM manual acupuncture techniques, we developed a method to capture piezoelectric signals in related \"windows\" and subsequently extract features to model acupuncture techniques. Next, we created an ensemble learning-based action classifier for manual acupuncture technique recognition. Finally, the proposed classifier was employed to recognize the four types of manual acupuncture techniques performed by 15 TCM physicians based on the piezoelectric signals collected using the tactile array finger cot.

{"title": "Electrospun piezoelectric scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The use of smart materials in tissue engineering is becoming increasingly appealing to provide additional functionalities and control over cell fate. The stages of tissue development and regeneration often require various electrical and electromechanical cues supported by the extracellular matrix, which is often neglected in most tissue engineering approaches. Particularly, in cardiac cells, electrical signals modulate cell activity and are responsible for the maintenance of the excitation-contraction coupling. Addition of electroconductive and topographical cues improves the biomimicry of cardiac tissues and plays an important role in driving cells towards the desired phenotype. Current platforms used to apply electrical stimulation to cells in vitro often require large external equipment and wires and electrodes immersed in the culture media, limiting the scalability and applicability of this process. Piezoelectric materials represent a shift in paradigm in materials and methods aimed at providing electrical stimulation to cardiac cells since they can produce and deliver electrical signals to cells and tissues by mechanoelectrical transduction. Despite the ability of piezoelectric materials to mimic the mechanoelectrical transduction of the heart, the use of these materials is limited in cardiac tissue engineering and methods to characterise piezoelectricity are often built in-house, which poses an additional difficulty when comparing results from the literature. In this work, we aim at providing an overview of the main challenges in cardiac tissue engineering and how piezoelectric materials could offer a solution to them. A revision on the existing literature in electrospun piezoelectric materials applied to cardiac tissue engineering is performed for the first time, as electrospinning plays an important role in the manufacturing of scaffolds with enhanced piezoelectricity and extracellular matrix native-like morphology. Finally, an overview of the current techniques used to evaluate piezoelectricity and their limitations is provided.", "journal": "Biomaterials advances", "date": "2022-08-06", "authors": ["Mariana RamalhoGomes", "FredericoCastelo Ferreira", "PaolaSanjuan-Alberte"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioadv.2022.212808"}
{"title": "Wearable Exoskeleton System for Energy Harvesting and Angle Sensing Based on a Piezoelectric Cantilever Generator Array.", "abstract": "Wearable exoskeletons are developing rapidly due to their superiority in improving human ability and efficiency. The construction of a multifunctional exoskeleton system relies on an efficient continuous energy supply and various high-performance sensors. Here, a magnetic-driven piezoelectric cantilever generator (MPCG) array is designed for energy harvesting and angle sensing of joint motions. Combining theoretical derivation and experimental characterization, it is found that the nonlinear magnetic force acting on the cantilever structure will cause the phenomenon of frequency upconversion, which greatly improves the output of the MPCG. The experiment successfully proves the feasibility of using the MPCG array as an energy-harvesting module to collect energy from human joint motions and power an RH/temp sensor. Furthermore, the MPCG array can also be used to sense the rotation angle and angular velocity. By integrating with a wireless data acquisition and transmission module and supporting software, a wearable joint rehabilitation monitoring and assessment system is built, which can measure the activities of the joint in real time and evaluate the flexion degree. The demonstrated wearable exoskeleton system for joint motion energy harvesting and joint angle sensing is of great value for the construction of a multifunctional exoskeleton system and wearable smart rehabilitation equipment.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-08-05", "authors": ["BingshanHu", "JiangtaoXue", "DongjieJiang", "PuchuanTan", "YiqianWang", "MinghaoLiu", "HongliuYu", "YangZou", "ZhouLi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c08757"}

Then, the performance of the piezohydraulic hybrid actuator is experimentally investigated, and the effects of exciting frequency, exciting voltage, and bias pressure are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the hybrid actuator performs the best when the exciting frequency is near the resonant frequency; meanwhile, the higher the exciting voltage, the better the performance. Moreover, it indicates that a larger bias pressure will bring a larger reaction force to the vibrator and reduce the performance of the actuator system.

Here, we demonstrate and test a new setup, which combines advantages of AFM and the surface forces apparatus, where absolute distances are measured by Multiple Beam White Light Interferometry (MBI).

{"title": "Acoustically accelerated neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their derived products offer great promise for targeted therapies and drug screening, however, the hESC differentiation process of mature neurons is a lengthy process. To accelerate the neuron production, an acoustic stimulator producing surface acoustic waves (SAWs) is proposed and realized by clamping a flexible printed circuit board (PCB) directly onto a piezoelectric substrate. Neural differentiation of the hESCs is greatly accelerated after application of the acoustic stimulations. Acceleration mechanisms for neural differentiation have been explored by bulk RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunostaining. The RNA sequencing results show changes of extracellular matrix-related and physiological activity-related gene expression in the low or medium SAW dose group and the high SAW dose group, respectively. The neural progenitor cell markers, including Pax6, Sox1, Sox2, Sox10 and Nkx2-1, are less expressed in the SAW dose groups compared with the control group by the qPCR. Other genes including Alk, Cenpf, Pcdh17, and Actn3 are also found to be regulated by the acoustic stimulation. Moreover, the immunostaining confirmed that more mature neuron marker Tuj1-positive cells, while less stem cell marker Sox2-positive cells, are presented in the SAW dose groups. These results indicate that the SAW stimulation accelerated neural differentiation process. The acoustic stimulator fabricated by using the PCB is a promising tool in regulation of stem cell differentiation process applied in cell therapy.

The aim of this work is the design of new, highly effective materials possessing high blood compatibility. To do this, the new composites based on the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) support covered with a single-walled carbon nanohorns (CNHs) layer were prepared. The PVDF-CNHs composites were subsequently used for the first time in the hemocompatibility studies. To raise the hemocompatibility a new, never applied before for CNHs, plasma-surface modifications in air, nitrogen and ammonia were implemented. This relatively cheap, facile and easy method allows generating the new hybrid materials with high effectiveness and significant differences in surface properties (water contact angle, surface \u03b6-potential, and surface functional groups composition). Changing those properties made it possible to select the most promising samples for blood-related applications. This was done in a fully controlled way by applying Taguchi's \"orthogonal array\" procedure. It is shown for the first time that nitrogen plasma treatment of new surfaces is the best tool for hemocompatibility rise and leads to very low blood platelet adhesion, no cytotoxicity, and excellent performance in thromboelastometry and hemolysis tests. We propose a possible mechanism explaining this behavior. The optimisation results are coherent with biological characterisation and are supported with Hansen Solubility Parameters.

{"title": "Electrical stimulation: Effective cue to direct osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells?", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a major role in bone tissue engineering (BTE) thanks to their capacity for osteogenic differentiation and being easily available. In vivo, MSCs are exposed to an electroactive microenvironment in the bone niche, which has piezoelectric properties. The correlation between the electrically active milieu and bone's ability to adapt to mechanical stress and self-regenerate has led to using electrical stimulation (ES) as physical cue to direct MSCs differentiation towards the osteogenic lineage in BTE. This review summarizes the different techniques to electrically stimulate MSCs to induce their osteoblastogenesis in vitro, including general electrical stimulation and substrate mediated stimulation by means of conductive or piezoelectric cell culture supports. Several aspects are covered, including stimulation parameters, treatment times and cell culture media to summarize the best conditions for inducing MSCs osteogenic commitment by electrical stimulation, from a critical point of view. Electrical stimulation activates different signaling pathways, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) Smad-dependent or independent, regulated by mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and p38. The roles of voltage gate calcium channels (VGCC) and integrins are also highlighted according to their application technique and parameters, mainly converging in the expression of RUNX2, the master regulator of the osteogenic differentiation pathway. Despite the evident lack of homogeneity in the approaches used, the ever-increasing scientific evidence confirms ES potential as an osteoinductive cue, mimicking aspects of the in vivo microenvironment and moving one step forward to the translation of this approach into clinic.", "journal": "Biomaterials advances", "date": "2022-08-02", "authors": ["MGuillot-Ferriols", "SLanceros-M\u00e9ndez", "J LG\u00f3mez Ribelles", "GGallego Ferrer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioadv.2022.212918"}

{"title": "Measurement of the Compressibility of Cell and Nucleus Based on Acoustofluidic Microdevice.", "abstract": "Cell mechanics play an important role in tumor metastasis, malignant transformation of cells, and radiosensitivity. During these processes, studying the mechanical properties of the cells is often challenging. Conventional measurement methods based on contact such as compression or stretching are prone to cause cell damage, affecting measurement accuracy and subsequent cell culture. Measurements in adherent state can also affect accuracy, especially after irradiation since ionizing radiation will flatten cells and enhance adhesion. Here, a cell mechanics measurement system based on acoustofluidic method has been developed. The cell compressibility can be obtained by recording the cell motion trajectory under the action of the acoustic force, which can realize fast and non-destructive measurement in suspended state. This paper reports in detail the protocols for chip design, sample preparation, trajectory recording, parameter extraction and analysis. The compressibility of different types of tumor cells was measured based on this method. Measurement of the compressibility of nucleus was also achieved by adjusting the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric ceramic and the width of the microchannel. Combined with the molecular level verification of immunofluorescence experiments, the cell compressibility before and after drug-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were compared. Further, the change of cell compressibility after X-ray irradiation with different doses was revealed. The cell mechanics measurement method proposed in this paper is universal and flexible and has broad application prospects in scientific research and clinical practice.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2022-08-02", "authors": ["QibinFu", "YanZhang", "TuchenHuang", "YangLiu"], "doi": "10.3791/64225"}

{"title": "Comparison Between the Bone Lid Technique and the Traditional Technique in Surgical Treatment of the Posterior Mandibular Lesions: A Randomized Controlled Trial.", "abstract": "Introduction Cystic lesions of the jaws and the impacted teeth are two of the most common cases that require surgical intervention in oral and maxillofacial surgery; however, surgeons also frequently use a traditional technique that involves the removal of the buccal bone plate. This study was conducted to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of the bone lid technique and the traditional technique. Methods This randomized controlled trial included 20 patients who were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10 each): the T group, in which the lesions were accessed using the traditional technique with classical rotating instruments, and the BL group, in which the lesions were accessed with the bone lid technique performed using a piezoelectric device, with repositioning of the buccal bone plate. Operative time, pain, edema, inferior alveolar nerve injury, and\u00a0bone defect healing were measured during clinical and radiological follow-ups at 24 h, 72 h, one week, one month, and six months after the surgery. Results Normal soft tissue and bone healing were observed in all cases except one case in\u00a0the BL group. The T group\u00a0had a shorter mean operative time than\u00a0the BL group. In terms of pain, edema, and inferior alveolar nerve injury, the groups did not differ statistically significantly. The percentage of bone defect healing was significantly greater in the BL group\u00a0than in the T group\u00a0after six months of follow-up. Conclusion The bone lid technique performed using a piezoelectric device was effective and safe for managing lesions in the posterior mandibular region and was not associated with increased postoperative complications. The disadvantages of this technique include a longer operative time and the need for fixation tools in some cases. In contrast, this technique outperforms the traditional technique in terms of reducing bone loss and improving the healing of bone defects.", "journal": "Cureus", "date": "2022-08-02", "authors": ["Mohamad HusamAbu Hawa", "ZaedShehri", "IssamAlkhouri"], "doi": "10.7759/cureus.26223"}

Most broadly defined, an ion channel is called mechanosensitive if its activity is controlled by application of a physical force. The last decade has witnessed a revolution in mechanosensory physiology at the molecular, cellular, and system levels, both in health and in diseases. Since the discovery of the PIEZO proteins as prototypical mechanosensitive channel, many proteins have been proposed to transduce mechanosensory information in mammals.

{"title": "Pyro-catalysis for tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation.", "abstract": "Tooth whitening has recently become one of the most popular aesthetic dentistry procedures. Beyond classic hydrogen peroxide-based whitening agents, photo-catalysts and piezo-catalysts have been demonstrated for non-destructive on-demand tooth whitening. However, their usage has been challenged due to the relatively limited physical stimuli of light irradiation and ultrasonic mechanical vibration. To address this challenge, we report here a non-destructive and convenient tooth whitening strategy based on the pyro-catalysis effect, realized via ubiquitous oral motion-induced temperature fluctuations. Degradation of organic dyes via pyro-catalysis is performed under cooling/heating cycling to simulate natural temperature fluctuations associated with intake and speech.

{"title": "Varifocal Concave-Convex Lens Using Viscoelastic Gel and Ultrasound Vibration.", "abstract": "A varifocal concave-convex lens using ultrasound and transparent viscoelastic gel is reported. The configuration of the lens is simple and thin, consisting of four pieces of a piezoelectric ultrasound transducer, a glass disk, and a transparent silicone gel film. It uses a combination of the ultrasound resonant flexural standing- and traveling-wave modes excited by in-phase and four-phase drives so that the lens can change its shape to both concave and convex by switching the resonance mode with the same structure. The acoustic radiation force (ARF) originated from the resonant flexural vibration modes changed the surface profile of the gel. Convex and concave deformation were generated at the center of the lens at the resonance frequencies of 38 and 60 kHz, respectively, indicating that a varifocal concave-convex lens could be fabricated by controlling the driving frequency, voltage amplitude, and phase differences among the ultrasound transducers. The deformational displacement on the lens surface and the change in the focal length increased with the input voltage amplitude. The optical microscopic images observed through the lens were enlarged 1.28\u00d7 (reduced 0.92\u00d7 ) in the convex (concave) mode with 20 [Formula: see text]. The response time for focusing and the temperature stability under operation were evaluated. By switching the resonance vibration modes of the lens through the input signals to multiple ultrasound transducers, the variable-focus function with both concave and convex lenses was achieved in the same configuration.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-07-30", "authors": ["ShunsukeHashimoto", "YukiHarada", "KosukeNakamura", "TakahiroIwase", "JessicaOnaka", "MamiMatsukawa", "DaisukeKoyama"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3194861"}
{"title": "Piezo channels contribute to the regulation of myelination in Schwann cells.", "abstract": "Peripheral nerves and Schwann cells have to sustain constant mechanical constraints, caused by developmental growth as well as stretches associated with movements of the limbs and mechanical compressions from daily activities. In Schwann cells, signaling molecules sensitive to stiffness or stretch of the extracellular matrix, such as YAP/TAZ, have been shown to be critical for Schwann cell development and peripheral nerve regeneration. YAP/TAZ have also been suggested to contribute to tumorigenesis, neuropathic pain, and inherited disorders. Yet, the role of mechanosensitive ion channels in myelinating Schwann cells is vastly unexplored. Here we comprehensively assessed the expression of mechanosensitive ion channels in Schwann cells and identified that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are among the most abundant mechanosensitive ion channels expressed by Schwann cells. Using classic genetic ablation studies, we show that PIEZO1 is a transient inhibitor of radial and longitudinal myelination in Schwann cells. Contrastingly, we show that PIEZO2 may be required for myelin formation, as the absence of PIEZO2 in Schwann cells delays myelin formation. We found an epistatic relationship between PIEZO1 and PIEZO2, at both the morphological and molecular levels. Finally, we show that PIEZO1 channels affect the regulation of YAP/TAZ activation in Schwann cells. Overall, we present here the first demonstration that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 contribute to mechanosensation in Schwann cells as well myelin development in the peripheral nervous system.", "journal": "Glia", "date": "2022-07-30", "authors": ["JenicaAcheta", "UrjaBhatia", "JeanetteHaley", "JiayueHong", "KyleRich", "RachelClose", "Marie EBechler", "SophieBelin", "YannickPoitelon"], "doi": "10.1002/glia.24251\n10.7554/eLife.58591\n10.7554/eLife.20982\n10.7554/eLife.30839\n10.7554/eLife.52779"}

Here, we develop a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) with a composite structure consisting of multiple polyimide and copper layers and demonstrate it as a novel acoustic matching layer. With a flexible substrate and robust ACF bonding, the FPCB not only serves as an acoustic matching layer between piezoelectric elements and the surrounding medium but also as a ground for the electrical connection between the transducer array elements and the folded substrate. A 1D linear ultrasound transducer array with the FPCB matching layer exhibits larger output pressure, wider -3dB bandwidth, and higher ultrasound beam intensity compared to that of an ultrasound transducer array with the alumina/epoxy matching layer, which is one of the most commonly applied composite matching layers.

{"title": "Static, Dynamic, and Signal-To-Noise Analysis of a Solid-State Magnetoelectric (Me) Sensor with a Spice-Based Circuit Simulator.", "abstract": "Modeling the non-electrical processes by equivalent electrical circuits is a widely known and successfully used technique in research and development. Although finite element methods software development has supplanted electrical analogy techniques due to greater accuracy and intuitiveness in recent decades, the modeling of physical processes based on analogies has several advantages in some cases. Representation of physical processes in the form of lumped circuits and graphs allows researchers to estimate the system with an alternative view, use standardized methods for solving electrical circuits for non-electrical systems, and, most importantly, allows us to use electrical circuit simulators with their unique capabilities. Of particular interest for using the analogy technique are systems that include electronic components along with components belonging to other physical domains, such as mechanical, thermal, magnetic, and others. A solid-state magnetoelectric (\u041c\u0415) sensor equipped with a charge amplifier is proposed in this study as an example of analysis using the equivalent electrical circuit and simulating these circuits using SPICE-based circuit simulators. Sensor analysis is conducted with an emphasis on noise budgeting and optimizing the sensor's signal-to-noise ratio and resolution.

In this work, a novel GaOCl monolayer is proposed and studied systematically based on first-principles calculations. With excellent thermal and dynamic stability at room temperature, its wide direct bandgap (4.46 eV) can be further modulated under applied strains. The 2D semiconductor exhibits high mechanical flexibility, and anisotropy in Poisson's ratio and carrier mobilities, endowing it with a broad spectrum of electronic and optoelectronic applications. More importantly, the GaOCl monolayer has spontaneous magnetization induced by hole doping and shows outstanding multidirectional piezoelectricity, which are comparable with those of either magnetic or piezoelectric 2D materials. Our calculations indicate that the GaOCl monolayer with wide bandgaps and tunable piezoelectricity and ferromagnetism could be promising for applications in multifunctional integrated nano-devices with high performance.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["ShujuanJiang", "HuabingYin", "Guang-PingZheng"], "doi": "10.1039/d2nr02821b"}
{"title": "Effect of the Surface Functionalization of Graphene and MWCNT on the Thermodynamic, Mechanical and Electrical Properties of the Graphene/MWCNT-PVDF Nanocomposites.", "abstract": "The nanocomposites of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) with pristine graphene nanoflakes (GNF) and a multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) were prepared by the solution casting method. Additionally, the GNF and MWCNT were functionalized by acid treatment, and nanocomposites of the acid-treated MWCNT/GNF and PVDF were prepared in the same method. The effect of the acid treatment of MWCNT and GNF on the mechanical, thermal and thermo-oxidative stability and the thermal conductivity of the MWCNT/GNF-PVDF nanocomposites was evaluated, and the results were compared with the untreated MWCNT/GNF-PVDF nanocomposites. In both cases, the amount of GNF and MWCNT was varied to observe and compare their thermal and mechanical properties. The functionalization of the GNF or MWCNT resulted in the change in the crystallization and melting behavior of the nanocomposites, as confirmed by the differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The addition of the functionalized GNF/MWCNT led to the improved thermal stability of the PVDF nanocomposites compared to that of the non-functionalized GNF/MWCNT-PVDF nanocomposites. The thermal and electrical conductivity of the functionalized and non-functionalized GNF/MWCNT-PVDF composites were also measured and compared. The functional groups, crystal structure, microstructure and morphology of the nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["Mamdouh AAl-Harthi", "ManwarHussain"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14152976\n10.1016/S0032-3861(99)00719-3\n10.1021/ma060733p\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2005.03.008\n10.1002/macp.200600447\n10.1002/marc.200600268\n10.1002/app.22849\n10.1016/j.matpr.2018.06.503\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.01.050\n10.1016/S0009-2614(01)00490-0\n10.1021/ja0354418\n10.1016/S0921-4526(02)00999-7\n10.1016/j.electacta.2007.05.038\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.07.120\n10.1016/j.mser.2005.04.002\n10.1016/j.polymer.2007.04.073\n10.1016/j.msea.2007.02.091\n10.1016/j.jcis.2006.10.034\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2006.10.021\n10.1007/b10971390\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.07.144\n10.1126/science.282.5386.95\n10.1016/j.diamond.2006.08.021\n10.1021/jp027500u\n10.1002/adfm.200305200\n10.1016/S0032-3861(02)00349-X\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2012.06.014\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2013.01.060\n10.1016/j.tca.2004.09.001\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.08.019\n10.1016/j.polymer.2010.09.067\n10.1002/marc.200500043\n10.1021/jp0759168\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2013.09.054\n10.1016/j.jcis.2010.01.035\n10.1038/nnano.2008.96\n10.1007/s10973-015-4903-7\n10.1016/j.carbon.2012.08.062\n10.1007/s10853-017-1592-6\n10.1002/app.38081\n10.5301/jabfm.5000351\n10.1016/j.carbon.2013.03.050\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.11.005\n10.1177/0021998313514256\n10.18321/ectj886\n10.1038/372159a0"}
{"title": "Recent Progress of Nanogenerators for Green Energy Harvesting: Performance, Applications, and Challenges.", "abstract": "Natural sources of green energy include sunshine, water, biomass, geothermal heat, and wind. These energies are alternate forms of electrical energy that do not rely on fossil fuels. Green energy is environmentally benign, as it avoids the generation of greenhouse gases and pollutants. Various systems and equipment have been utilized to gather natural energy. However, most technologies need a huge amount of infrastructure and expensive equipment in order to power electronic gadgets, smart sensors, and wearable devices. Nanogenerators have recently emerged as an alternative technique for collecting energy from both natural and artificial sources, with significant benefits such as light weight, low-cost production, simple operation, easy signal processing, and low-cost materials. These nanogenerators might power electronic components and wearable devices used in a variety of applications such as telecommunications, the medical sector, the military and automotive industries, and internet of things (IoT) devices. We describe new research on the performance of nanogenerators employing several green energy acquisition processes such as piezoelectric, electromagnetic, thermoelectric, and triboelectric.

Sterilization with saturated steam under pressure is the most widely used method; however, data concerning heat sterilization applicability to polymeric ultrafiltration (UF) membranes are scarcely available. In this study, the effect of the sterilization process on the filtration performance of a commercial polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber UF membrane was evaluated. Membrane modules were constructed and sterilized several times in an autoclave. Pure water flux tests were performed, to assess the effect of heat sterilization on the membrane's pure water permeance. Dextran rejection tests were performed for the characterization of membrane typical pore size and its fouling propensity. Filtration performance was also assessed by conducting filtration tests with real fermentation broth. After repeated sterilization cycles, pure water permeance remained quite constant, varying between approx. 830 and 990 L\u00b7m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["AlexandraNastouli", "AsiminaTsirigka", "MichaelHarasek", "Anastasios JKarabelas", "Sotiris IPatsios"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12080725\n10.1016/j.eng.2021.07.025\n10.1016/j.procbio.2018.12.012\n10.1016/j.procbio.2011.11.022\n10.1186/1475-2859-10-10\n10.1007/s10529-007-9507-2\n10.1002/1097-0290(20001220)70:6<670::AID-BIT9>3.0.CO;2-7\n10.1002/jctb.3834\n10.1016/j.cej.2015.11.058\n10.1016/j.procbio.2015.09.023\n10.1016/j.cep.2017.05.002\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.01.006\n10.2166/wpt.2020.022\n10.1016/j.cscee.2021.100149\n10.1007/BF00253608\n10.1007/s007920050117\n10.1016/j.jbiosc.2014.06.002\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.02.042\n10.1016/j.procbio.2014.04.009\n10.1271/bbb.110499\n10.1016/j.biortech.2013.12.043\n10.1007/s00449-011-0521-3\n10.1271/bbb.110486\n10.1002/elsc.202000099\n10.4014/jmb.1402.02017\n10.1007/s10098-016-1275-z\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.10.051\n10.1002/ceat.201500257\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.055\n10.3390/polym9120718\n10.3390/polym9100524\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014\n10.1177/0021998313490537\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.12.059\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)82391-1\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.09.028\n10.2166/wst.2009.370"}

{"title": "Morphological Fabrication of Equilibrium and Auditory Sensors through Electrolytic Polymerization on Hybrid Fluid Rubber (HF Rubber) for Smart Materials of Robotics.", "abstract": "The development of auditory sensors and systems is essential in smart materials of robotics and is placed at the strategic category of mutual communication between humans and robots. We designed prototypes of the rubber-made equilibrium and auditory sensors, mimicking hair cells in the saccule and the cochlea at the vestibule of the human ear by utilizing our previously proposed technique of electrolytic polymerization on the hybrid fluid rubber (HF rubber). The fabricated artificial hair cells embedded with mimicked free nerve endings and Pacinian corpuscles, which are well-known receptors in the human skin and have already been elucidated effective in the previous study, have the intelligence of equilibrium and auditory sensing. Moreover, they have a voltage that is generated from built-in electricity caused by the ionized particles and molecules in the HF rubber due to piezoelectricity.

{"title": "Feedforward Control of Piezoelectric Ceramic Actuators Based on PEA-RNN.", "abstract": "Multilayer perceptron (MLP) has been demonstrated to implement feedforward control of the piezoelectric actuator (PEA). To further improve the control accuracy of the neural network, reduce the training time, and explore the possibility of online model updating, a novel recurrent neural network named PEA-RNN is established in this paper. PEA-RNN is a three-input, one-output neural network, including one gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer, seven linear layers, and one residual connection in the linear layers. The experimental results show that the displacement linearity error of piezoelectric ceramics reaches 8.96 \u03bcm in the open-loop condition. After using PEA-RNN compensation, the maximum displacement error of piezoelectric ceramics is reduced to 0.465 \u03bcm at the operating frequency of 10 Hz, which proves that PEA-RNN can accurately compensate piezoelectric ceramics' dynamic hysteresis nonlinearity. At the same time, the training epochs of PEA-RNN are only 5% of the MLP, and fewer training epochs provide the possibility to realize online updates of the model in the future.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["YongchengXiong", "WenhongJia", "LiminZhang", "YingZhao", "LifangZheng"], "doi": "10.3390/s22145387\n10.1109/TASE.2014.2352364\n10.1016/j.cossms.2004.03.010\n10.1063/1.5093000\n10.1007/BF01349418\n10.1109/3516.847090\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/11/001\n10.1061/JMCEA3.0002106\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2005.04.030\n10.1016/S0020-7683(98)00040-7\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111553\n10.3390/s20123342"}

The optical medium voltage transducer (MVT) module was designed to be combined with a capacitive voltage divider (CVD) to form a voltage sensor intended for 132 kV high voltage (HV) networks. The MVT module comprises a combination of a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) as a core optical sensing element. Changes in the input voltage across the PZT translate into strain being detected by the FBG. The resultant FBG peak wavelength can be calibrated in terms of the input voltage to obtain a precise voltage measurement. The module was experimentally evaluated in the laboratory, and its performance was assessed based on the requirements specified by the IEC standards for electronic voltage transformers and low power voltage transformers. The results of accuracy tests demonstrate that the MVT module is free from hysteresis, within the experimental error, and is capable of simultaneously meeting the requirements for 0.1 metering and 1P protection classes specified by the IEC 60044-7 and IEC 61869-11 standards.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["GrzegorzFusiek", "PawelNiewczas"], "doi": "10.3390/s22145307\n10.3390/en12234552\n10.1007/s40565-016-0222-7\n10.1109/JPROC.2010.2060450\n10.1007/s40565-016-0211-x\n10.1007/s40565-016-0218-3\n10.1051/matecconf/20166102017\n10.1109/PQ.2010.5549998\n10.3390/en12040682\n10.1109/TIM.2014.2329740\n10.3390/s20174830\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.145\n10.1023/A:1022072500963\n10.3390/s19092196\n10.1088/0957-0233/8/4/002\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.06.020\n10.1117/1.2714931\n10.1109/JLT.2012.2213891"}
{"title": "Machine-Learning-Based Fine Tuning of Input Signals for Mechano-Tactile Display.", "abstract": "Deducing the input signal for a tactile display to present the target surface (i.e., solving the inverse problem for tactile displays) is challenging. We proposed the encoding and presentation (EP) method in our prior work, where we encoded the target surface by scanning it using an array of piezoelectric devices (encoding) and then drove the piezoelectric devices using the obtained signals to display the surface (presentation). The EP method reproduced the target texture with an accuracy of over 80% for the five samples tested, which we refer to as replicability. Machine learning is a promising method for solving inverse problems. In this study, we designed a neural network to connect the subjective evaluation of tactile sensation and the input signals to a display; these signals are described as time-domain waveforms. First, participants were asked to touch the surface presented by the mechano-tactile display based on the encoded data from the EP method. Then, the participants recorded the similarity of the surface compared to five material samples, which were used as the input. The encoded data for the material samples were used as the output to create a dataset of 500 vectors. By training a multilayer perceptron with the dataset, we deduced new inputs for the display. The results indicate that using machine learning for fine tuning leads to significantly better accuracy in deducing the input compared to that achieved using the EP method alone. The proposed method is therefore considered a good solution for the inverse problem for tactile displays.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["ShutoYamanaka", "TatsuhoNagatomo", "TakefumiHiraki", "HirokiIshizuka", "NorihisaMiki"], "doi": "10.3390/s22145299\n10.1016/j.displa.2007.07.003\n10.1016/j.displa.2014.10.007\n10.1109/TOH.2017.2689006\n10.1109/TOH.2020.3018754\n10.1145/1060581.1060587\n10.1109/TOH.2019.2912960\n10.1299/jsmec.41.94\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.07.002\n10.7567/JJAP.53.06JM11\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.03.035\n10.1109/TOH.2019.2932990\n10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3130277"}

Therefore, the detection of impact vibration is critical for the reliability, stability, and overall life of mechanical parts. Accordingly, this paper proposes a method to indirectly characterize the impact force by using an impact stress wave. The LS-DYNA software is utilized to establish the model of a ball impacting the steel plate, and the impact force of the ball and the impact response of the detection point are obtained through explicit dynamic finite element analysis. In addition, on this basis, a correspondence between the impact force and the impact response is established, and finally, an experimental platform for impact force detection is built for experimental testing. The results obtained by the finite element method are in good agreement with the experimental measurement results, and it can be inferred that the detected piezoelectric signal can be used to characterize the impact force.

{"title": "Freestanding Activated Carbon Nanocomposite Electrodes for Capacitive Deionization of Water.", "abstract": "Freshwater reserves are being polluted every day due to the industrial revolution. Man-made activities have adverse effects upon the ecosystem. It is thus the hour of need to explore newer technologies to save and purify water for the growing human population. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is being considered as an emerging technique for removal of excess ions to produce potable water including desalination. Herein, cost-effective activated carbon incorporated with carbon nanotubes (CNT) was used as a freestanding electrode. Further, the desalination efficiency of the designed electrodes was tuned by varying binder concentration, i.e., polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in the activated carbon powder and CNT mixture. PVDF concentration of 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 wt% was selected to optimize the freestanding electrode formation and further applied for desalination of water.

{"title": "A Microfluidic System of Gene Transfer by Ultrasound.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic gene transfer has advantages beyond other cell transfer techniques because ultrasound does not directly act on cells, but rather pushes the gene fragments around the cells into cells through an acoustic hole effect. Most examples reported were carried out in macro volumes with conventional ultrasonic equipment. In the present study, a MEMS focused ultrasonic transducer based on piezoelectric thin film with flexible substrate was integrated with microchannels to form a microfluidic system of gene transfer. The core part of the system is a bowl-shaped curved piezoelectric film structure that functions to focus ultrasonic waves automatically. Therefore, the low input voltage and power can obtain the sound pressure exceeding the cavitation threshold in the local area of the microchannel in order to reduce the damage to cells. The feasibility of the system is demonstrated by finite element simulation and an integrated system of MEMS ultrasonic devices and microchannels are developed to successfully carry out the ultrasonic gene transfection experiments for HeLa cells. The results show that having more ultrasonic transducers leads a higher transfection rate.

For the sake of maximum compactness, which is obligatory for all implantable devices, power is to be supplied by a piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG). Several meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and an ANN (artificial neural network)-assisted goal attainment method were applied to the circuit, aiming to provide us with the set of optimal design parameters which ensure the minimal overall area of the preamplifier. These parameters are the slew rate, load capacitor, gain-bandwidth product, maximal input voltage, minimal input voltage, input voltage, reference voltage, and dissipation power. The results are re-evaluated and compared in the Cadence 180 nm SCL environment. It has been observed that, among the metaheuristic algorithms, the whale optimization technique reached the best values at low computational cost, decreased complexity, and the highest convergence speed. However, all metaheuristic algorithms were outperformed by the ANN-assisted goal attainment method, which produced a roughly 50% smaller overall area of the preamplifier.

It is used to classify and recognize the four contact patterns loaded on the tactile sensor, and the recognition accuracies of the four patterns are 99.60%, 99.67%, 99.07%, and 99.40%, respectively. At last, a CNN model and a random forest (RF) algorithm model are constructed to recognize the four contact patterns based on the same dataset as those for the CNN-LSTM model. The average accuracies of the four contact patterns based on the CNN-LSTM, the CNN, and the RF algorithm are 99.43%, 96.67%, and 91.39%, respectively. All of the experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM constructed in this paper has very efficient performance in recognizing and classifying the contact patterns for the flexible tactile sensor.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["YangSong", "MingkunLi", "FeiluWang", "ShannaLv"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13071053\n10.1002/advs.202002606\n10.1109/TIE.2019.2912788\n10.1021/acsami.1c17923\n10.1088/1361-6528/abf59e\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2959311\n10.1002/advs.202002362\n10.1109/LRA.2022.3142433\n10.1002/admt.201700248\n10.1002/admt.201900317\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2965083\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112697\n10.3390/polym12122905\n10.1002/admi.202101068\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.130599\n10.1007/s12274-021-3906-x\n10.1088/1361-6528/ac0c3f\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.113022\n10.1109/JSEN.2022.3166706\n10.1063/1.5078943\n10.3390/mi10110730\n10.1002/adfm.201807957\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104105\n10.1109/TMECH.2018.2870917\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab8748\n10.3390/s130505478\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab667a\n10.1109/JSEN.2021.3055035\n10.1021/acsami.0c23042\n10.1021/acsami.1c12241\n10.1016/j.matlet.2021.131308\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.054\n10.1016/j.robot.2014.09.022\n10.3390/coatings10111094\n10.1063/5.0005215\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.02.032\n10.1109/TIM.2021.3091990\n10.3390/s19071716\n10.1109/JSEN.2021.3055565"}

{"title": "Comparison between Piezoelectric and Piezoresistive Wearable Gait Monitoring Techniques.", "abstract": "Insole plantar stress detection (PSD) techniques play an important role in gait monitoring. Among the various insole PSD methods, piezoelectric- and piezoresistive-based architectures are broadly used in medical scenes. Each year, a growing number of new research outcomes are reported. Hence, a deep understanding of these two kinds of insole PSD sensors and state-of-the-art work would strongly benefit the researchers in this highly interdisciplinary field. In this context, this review article is composed of the following aspects. First, the mechanisms of the two techniques and corresponding comparisons are explained and discussed.

{"title": "Recent Advances in Early Diagnosis of Viruses Associated with Gastroenteritis by Biosensors.", "abstract": "Gastroenteritis, as one of the main worldwide health challenges, especially in children, leads to 3-6 million deaths annually and causes nearly 20% of the total deaths of children aged \u02c25 years, of which ~1.5 million gastroenteritis deaths occur in developing nations. Viruses are the main causative agent (~70%) of gastroenteritis episodes and their specific and early diagnosis via laboratory assays is very helpful for having successful antiviral therapy and reduction in infection burden. Regarding this importance, the present literature is the first review of updated improvements in the employing of different types of biosensors such as electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric for sensitive, simple, cheap, rapid, and specific diagnosis of human gastroenteritis viruses. The Introduction section is a general discussion about the importance of viral gastroenteritis, types of viruses that cause gastroenteritis, and reasons for the combination of conventional diagnostic tests with biosensors for fast detection of viruses associated with gastroenteritis. Following the current laboratory detection tests for human gastroenteritis viruses and their limitations (with subsections: Electron Microscope (EM), Cell Culture, Immunoassay, and Molecular Techniques), structural features and significant aspects of various biosensing methods are discussed in the Biosensor section. In the next sections, basic information on viruses causing gastroenteritis and recent developments for fabrication and testing of different biosensors for each virus detection are covered, and the prospect of future developments in designing different biosensing platforms for gastroenteritis virus detection is discussed in the Conclusion and Future Directions section as well.", "journal": "Biosensors", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["AbouzarBabaei", "NastaranRafiee", "BehnazTaheri", "HessamaddinSohrabi", "AhadMokhtarzadeh"], "doi": "10.3390/bios12070499\n10.2147/CEG.S6554\n10.1016/j.ijid.2011.02.006\n10.4081/jphr.2013.e9\n10.1016/S0891-5520(05)70187-2\n10.1586/14737159.2016.1167599\n10.1097/QCO.0b013e328330662f\n10.1016/j.pop.2013.05.006\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60560-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60549-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61798-0\n10.3201/eid1202.050006\n10.1046/j.1469-0691.2003.00560.x\n10.1046/j.1442-200x.2004.01896.x\n10.1097/00001432-200410000-00011\n10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2013.07.020\n10.1056/NEJMra0804575\n10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.09.016\n10.1016/j.envres.2022.113536\n10.1128/CMR.00002-06\n10.1128/CMR.00011-14\n10.1002/jmv.24926\n10.3389/fmicb.2019.01957\n10.1128/JCM.01535-14\n10.1111/1541-4337.12913\n10.1016/j.trac.2017.10.005\n10.1016/j.trac.2021.116344\n10.1016/j.talanta.2022.123330\n10.2174/157489111794407877\n10.1016/j.microc.2022.107248\n10.1016/j.trac.2022.116686\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132531\n10.3390/s20030813\n10.1016/j.fct.2022.113176\n10.3390/bios9020065\n10.1007/s10096-018-3230-x\n10.1016/j.watres.2018.02.004\n10.1007/s40820-020-00533-y\n10.1016/j.bdq.2014.07.001\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.204\n10.1016/j.jcv.2005.04.001\n10.1134/S0006350919060095\n10.1038/nprot.2011.410\n10.1016/j.jcv.2013.06.022\n10.1021/acsomega.0c00502\n10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.07.005\n10.1128/CDLI.10.4.506-513.2003\n10.1590/S1517-83822006000400035\n10.1016/S0166-0934(01)00397-4\n10.1155/2020/8832728\n10.3201/eid2008.140526\n10.1016/j.jcv.2010.12.009\n10.1016/j.jcv.2011.05.025\n10.2217/fvl-2020-0013\n10.1016/j.jviromet.2003.09.005\n10.1002/jmv.24711\n10.2174/1874357901206010104\n10.3389/fbioe.2016.00011\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1962.tb13623.x\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.028\n10.1016/j.trac.2017.11.012\n10.1007/s00604-018-3088-8\n10.1016/j.trac.2019.02.012\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132373\n10.1007/s00604-021-04757-6\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.08.008\n10.1016/j.bios.2019.111833\n10.1002/bab.1621\n10.3390/s21041109\n10.1109/JSEN.2009.2014427\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.12.052\n10.2147/IJN.S294417\n10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.088\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119652\n10.1016/j.bios.2021.113112\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112214\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.06.023\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.091\n10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.05.007\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.07.165\n10.1016/B978-0-323-44923-6.00001-7\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.114989\n10.1016/j.trac.2018.03.019\n10.1016/j.bios.2019.111693\n10.1080/14737159.2019.1554435\n10.1016/j.trac.2019.02.030\n10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.01.011\n10.1021/acsanm.0c00872\n10.1007/s12257-018-0410-6\n10.3390/s19061279\n10.1007/s00604-015-1728-9\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112403\n10.1088/2043-6262/5/4/045004\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.06.025\n10.1016/j.elecom.2020.106762\n10.1038/nrdp.2017.83\n10.1002/ange.201001428\n10.1007/s13206-011-5204-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010222\n10.1016/j.bios.2021.113503\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.05.097\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2764178\n10.1364/BOE.8.003383\n10.3390/s140203675\n10.1039/C5RA21665F\n10.1002/elan.201600179\n10.4172/2090-4967.1000149\n10.1002/rmv.2148\n10.1016/j.jcv.2018.01.008\n10.1016/j.trac.2019.02.019\n10.3390/bios11070238\n10.3390/s120100612\n10.26434/chemrxiv.8312324.v1\n10.1016/j.coesh.2020.01.007\n10.1166/sl.2016.3723\n10.1166/sl.2009.1168\n10.1128/JCM.01384-12\n10.1128/AAC.00841-08\n10.1016/j.jcv.2016.10.015\n10.1007/s12560-010-9038-1\n10.1016/j.virol.2005.11.015\n10.1093/infdis/jis251\n10.1128/jvi.10.5.1075-1081.1972\n10.1128/jvi.66.11.6527-6532.1992\n10.1128/CMR.14.1.15-37.2001\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.08.064\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.09.025\n10.1016/j.bios.2017.11.052\n10.3390/s18092980\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.099\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.09.024\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.03.006\n10.3390/foods9030318\n10.1002/adma.201702945\n10.1128/AEM.02051-06\n10.1016/S1386-6532(03)00011-8\n10.1021/acssensors.9b00489\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.12.032\n10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.12.004\n10.2116/analsci.31.159\n10.1128/JVI.77.22.11896-11909.2003\n10.1007/s00604-019-3420-y\n10.1073/pnas.0406159101"}
{"title": "A Flexible Ultrasound Array for Local Pulse Wave Velocity Monitoring.", "abstract": "Pulse wave velocity (PWV) measured at a specific artery location is called local PWV, which provides the elastic characteristics of arteries and indicates the degree of arterial stiffness. However, the large and cumbersome ultrasound probes require an appropriate sensor position and pressure maintenance, introducing usability constraints. In this paper, we developed a light (0.5 g) and thin (400 \u03bcm) flexible ultrasound array by encapsulating 1-3 composite piezoelectric transducers with a silicone elastomer. It can capture the distension waveforms of four arterial positions with a spacing of 10 mm and calculate the local PWV by multi-point fitting. This is illustrated by in vivo experiments, where the local PWV value of five normal subjects ranged from 3.07 to 4.82 m/s, in agreement with earlier studies.

{"title": "Advances in Detection of Antibiotic Pollutants in Aqueous Media Using Molecular Imprinting Technique-A Review.", "abstract": "Antibiotics constitute one of the emerging categories of persistent organic pollutants, characterised by their expansion of resistant pathogens. Antibiotic pollutants create a major public health challenge, with already identifiable detrimental effects on human and animal health. A fundamental aspect of controlling and preventing the spread of pollutants is the continuous screening and monitoring of environmental samples. Molecular imprinting is a state-of-the-art technique for designing robust biomimetic receptors called molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), which mimic natural biomolecules in target-selective recognition. When integrated with an appropriate sensor transducer, MIP demonstrates a potential for the needed environmental monitoring, thus justifying the observed rise in interest in this field of research. This review examines scientific interventions within the last decade on the determination of antibiotic water pollutants using MIP receptors interfaced with label-free sensing platforms, with an expanded focus on optical, piezoelectric, and electrochemical systems. Following these, the review evaluates the analytical performance of outstanding MIP-based sensors for environmentally significant antibiotics, while highlighting the importance of computational chemistry in functional monomer selection and the strategies for signal amplification and performance improvement. Lastly, the review points out the future trends in antibiotic MIP research, as it transits from a proof of concept to the much demanded commercially available entity.", "journal": "Biosensors", "date": "2022-07-28", "authors": ["Akinrinade GeorgeAyankojo", "JekaterinaReut", "Vu Bao ChauNguyen", "RomanBoroznjak", "VitaliSyritski"], "doi": "10.3390/bios12070441\n10.1002/clen.201300989\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.068\n10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.037\n10.1016/j.envpol.2016.11.045\n10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.054\n10.3390/toxics2020188\n10.1016/j.aquatox.2005.09.009\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.02.060\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.03.132\n10.1016/j.watres.2012.10.041\n10.1007/s00253-010-2649-5\n10.1007/s00216-010-4300-9\n10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.01.023\n10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.051\n10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30605-4\n10.1074/jbc.M115.671222\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.04.010\n10.1007/s00244-010-9624-0\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3006055\n10.1016/S1002-0160(11)60124-0\n10.1016/j.jes.2020.05.030\n10.1093/femsec/fiy105\n10.1016/0968-0004(94)90166-X\n10.3390/s19061279\n10.1016/j.trac.2018.01.011\n10.1002/jssc.202000832\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2018.08.009\n10.1039/C6RA18911C\n10.1039/C7CS00854F\n10.1016/j.snb.2021.131160\n10.3390/molecules26206233\n10.3390/s17040718\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.129369\n10.3390/polym13111781\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128973\n10.3390/polym13172841\n10.1007/s00216-011-5696-6\n10.3176/proc.2019.2.07\n10.1016/j.trac.2013.07.006\n10.1038/s41598-018-29585-2\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.08.014\n10.1002/jmr.2878\n10.3390/molecules23020316\n10.1002/pssa.202100021\n10.1080/19440049.2018.1508889\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107381\n10.1080/10408347.2019.1626697\n10.1016/j.jece.2022.107703\n10.1039/C6CS00061D\n10.1016/j.chroma.2010.10.097\n10.1016/S0003-2670(96)00356-X\n10.1002/jssc.201600003\n10.1021/jo3019522\n10.1039/C9RA01852B\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.08.058\n10.1039/C4AY01651C\n10.3389/fchem.2020.616326\n10.1039/c2an35228a\n10.1021/ma101013c\n10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.042\n10.1016/j.aca.2009.05.040\n10.1002/elan.201400251\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.11.194\n10.1016/j.chroma.2016.09.074\n10.1039/C5RA10367C\n10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.056\n10.1039/C6NJ03901D\n10.1039/C5RA16237H\n10.1515/epoly-2015-0017\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04735\n10.1039/C9AY02566A\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.126786\n10.1002/elan.201900397\n10.1016/j.talanta.2016.08.028\n10.1002/app.42817\n10.1002/jssc.201601180\n10.1007/s00216-010-4254-y\n10.1021/cr068107d\n10.1016/j.snb.2006.09.014\n10.1016/S0925-4005(98)00321-9\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.01.032\n10.1021/ac050227i\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04251\n10.1021/ac902944k\n10.1088/2053-1591/2/3/035007\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.07.042\n10.1080/09205063.2018.1457417\n10.1002/jbio.201000025\n10.1002/macp.200390015\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02725\n10.1021/acssensors.9b02039\n10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03613\n10.1016/j.talanta.2015.12.043\n10.1016/j.optmat.2021.111581\n10.1007/s00216-022-04012-8\n10.1039/D2TB00497F\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.129000\n10.1016/j.apt.2021.07.014\n10.1016/j.jiec.2017.09.022\n10.1039/D1SM00176K\n10.1016/j.polymer.2021.124448\n10.1016/j.optmat.2020.110200\n10.1039/D2TC00558A\n10.1002/jmr.826\n10.1063/1.4976024\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.127678\n10.1016/j.trac.2007.10.009\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.06079.x\n10.3390/s17030454\n10.1039/a907844d\n10.1007/s12161-017-1020-1\n10.1016/j.aca.2013.05.005\n10.1016/S0924-4247(96)01311-8\n10.1016/0924-4247(93)00660-V\n10.3390/s17040801\n10.1016/j.aca.2015.11.004\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.10.098\n10.3390/chemosensors9120362\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.110775\n10.1007/s13204-021-02220-9\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112836\n10.1016/j.cclet.2020.10.025\n10.1016/j.microc.2022.107515\n10.3390/s80314000\n10.1016/j.coelec.2019.04.020\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04092\n10.1039/C4AY03055A\n10.1016/j.molliq.2017.12.060\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129107\n10.1007/s11581-020-03554-0\n10.1016/j.talanta.2019.120502\n10.1149/1945-7111/ab6a7e\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114216\n10.2174/1573411015666190103144415\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115298\n10.1039/D0RA01838D\n10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122835\n10.1007/s00604-022-05205-9\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.08.041\n10.1016/j.watres.2021.117670\n10.3389/fchem.2021.615602\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.129112\n10.3390/chemosensors8010005\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114922\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124831\n10.1016/j.microc.2021.106017\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112522\n10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136161\n10.1016/j.aca.2007.05.053\n10.1016/j.talanta.2015.08.001\n10.3176/proc.2018.2.04\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.11.045\n10.1016/S0003-2670(02)01545-3\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.07.002\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.04.097\n10.1007/s00604-017-2089-3\n10.1016/j.microc.2022.107459\n10.1016/j.electacta.2018.03.104\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.05.156\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.06.006\n10.1002/bio.3003\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.06.002\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.09.053\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.110451\n10.1016/j.talanta.2016.11.007\n10.3390/ijms12095908\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00171\n10.1016/j.envint.2020.105733"}

Recognized causes include local anesthetic toxicity, subperineural injection, high subepineural fluid injection pressures and subepineural hematoma after forceful needle--nerve contact.We hypothesize that subperineural injection is still possible, but less likely to be the cause of nerve damage because needle penetration of fascicles and mechanical damage is difficult to achieve. High-resolution (75\u2009\u00b5m) 40 MHz micro-ultrasound images of pig axillae show short-bevelled 22\u2009g, 0.7\u2009mm wide block needles that are three times larger than the average fascicle. Fascicular bundles are extremely difficult to puncture because they spin away on needle contact. Histology from fresh cadavers after supposed intrafascicular injection shows fluid spread within perineurium and intrafascicular perineural septae, but no breach of endoneurium or axons.We propose that mechanotransduction, the cellular changes that occur in response to force, contributes to nerve damage.

{"title": "Chemical Cleaning and Membrane Aging in MBR for Textile Wastewater Treatment.", "abstract": "Membrane bioreactors have been widely used in textile wastewater treatment. Intensive chemical cleaning is indispensable in the MBR for textile wastewater treatment due to the severe membrane fouling implied. This work investigated the aging of three different membranes, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyether sulfone (PES), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), in the MBRs for textile wastewater treatment. Pilot-scale MBRs were operated and the used membrane was characterized. Batch chemical soaking tests were conducted to elucidate the aging properties of the membranes. The results indicated that the PVDF membrane was most liable to the chemical cleaning, and the PES and PTFE membranes were rather stable. The surface hydrophobicity of the PVDF increased in the acid aging test, and the pore size and pure water flux decreased due to the elevated hydrophobic effect; alkaline oxide aging destructed the structure of the PVDF membrane, enlarged pore size, and increased pure water flux.

{"title": "High Conduction Band Inorganic Layers for Distinct Enhancement of Electrical Energy Storage in Polymer Nanocomposites.", "abstract": "Dielectric polymer nanocomposites are considered as one of the most promising candidates for high-power-density electrical energy storage applications. Inorganic nanofillers with high insulation property are frequently introduced into fluoropolymer to improve its breakdown strength and energy storage capability. Normally, inorganic nanofillers are thought to introducing traps into polymer matrix to suppress leakage current. However, how these nanofillers effect the leakage current is still unclear. Meanwhile, high dopant (>\u20095 vol%) is prerequisite for distinctly improved energy storage performance, which severely deteriorates the processing and mechanical property of polymer nanocomposites, hence brings high technical complication and cost. Herein, boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) layers are utilized for substantially improving the electrical energy storage capability of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanocomposite. Results reveal that the high conduction band minimum of BNNS produces energy barrier at the interface of adjacent layers, preventing the electron in PVDF from passing through inorganic layers, leading to suppressed leakage current and superior breakdown strength.

Particularly, benefiting from the intrinsic flexibility of composite fabrics, the ILCP/P(VDF-TrFE) device can maintain stable performance under dynamic bending even if the frequency is up to 2.5\u00a0Hz, with a bending insensitivity of less than 1% performance variation under 1.0\u00a0mW\u00a0cm", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2022-07-25", "authors": ["XiaoxiongZheng", "ZhefengLiu", "RuiWang", "AihuaChen"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.202202639"}
{"title": "Analysis of molecular photomechanical performance using a one-dimensional harmonic model.", "abstract": "The photochemical reaction of a molecule leads to a change in the position of its nuclei that can be harnessed to perform mechanical work. Photomechanical materials use this effect to act as light-powered actuators. In this paper, a one-dimensional model based on coupled harmonic potential energy surfaces is developed to describe the photomechanical response of a molecule. This model generates predictions that are qualitatively consistent with standard mechanochemistry models for ground state rate reactions. To analyze the photomechanical process, excited state dynamics like photon absorption and relaxation are included. The model allows us to derive analytical expressions for the work output, blocking force, and absorbed photon-to-work efficiency. The effects of nonadiabatic electronic coupling, unequal frequency potentials, and the cycling efficiency are also analyzed. If the starting state is the stable (lower energy) isomer, it is possible to attain photon-to-work efficiencies up to 55.4%. If initial state is higher in energy, for example a metastable isomer, then one-way efficiencies\u2009>\u2009100% are possible due to the release of stored potential energy.

{"title": "Wearable Piezoelectric Airflow Transducers for Human Respiratory and Metabolic Monitoring.", "abstract": "Despite the importance of respiration and metabolism measurement in daily life, they are not widely available to ordinary people because of sophisticated and expensive equipment. Here, we first report a straightforward and economical approach to monitoring respiratory function and metabolic rate using a wearable piezoelectric airflow transducer (WPAT). A self-shielded bend sensor is designed by sticking two uniaxially drawn piezoelectric poly l-lactic acid films with different cutting angles, and then the bend sensor is mounted on one end of a plastic tube to engineer the WPAT. The airflow sensing principle of the WPAT is theoretically determined through finite element simulation, and the WPAT is calibrated with a pulse calibration method. We prove that the WPAT has similar accuracy (correlation coefficient >0.99) to a pneumotachometer in respiratory flow and lung volume assessment. We demonstrate metabolism measurement using the WPAT and the relationship between minute volume and metabolic rates via human wear trials.

Both molecules can be easily measured in human fluids or tissue extracts by immunoassays. However, the different molecular weight species can only be differentiated on Western Blot gels. Analysis of native proteins from polyacrylamide gels is also not well characterized. Hence, we developed a modified method to elute proteins or peptides from native agarose gels. Initially, full-length tau (60 kDa) and beta-amyloid(42) (4 kDa) were separated on a Western Blot gel and eluted from native agarose gels (WANGEL) using an elution system inside a polypropylene tube. The eluates were analyzed with the Lumipulse immunoassay. Both molecules were successfully eluted into 1% agarose gels to the cathode and were detected in the eluate. Additionally, tau was eluted from mouse cortical extracts, but was below the detection limit when eluted from human cerebrospinal fluid. Beta-amyloid(40) was eluted from CSF extracts and detected by Lumipulse. In cortical extracts taken from transgenic mice (APP_SweDI) beta-amyloid(42) was detectable as a native peptide and small oligomeric aggregates.

Emerging evidence suggests that Piezo channels (Piezo1 and Piezo2) can be regulated by their local membrane environment and particularly by cholesterol and phosphoinositides.

{"title": "Investigating the influence of the viscoelastic material as a heart muscle simulator on the powering leadless pacemaker from heartbeats by using a piezoelectric beam.", "abstract": "This paper studies experimentally and analytically the influence of the viscoelastic cardiac muscle on the energy harvesting from heartbeats for powering the leadless pacemakers by using a piezoelectric beam. An appropriate representative gel-type viscoelastic material that mimics the heart tissue is used in the tests. The piezoelectric beam coupled with a gel-type material is analytically modeled, and experimentally tested. By considering a combination of the translational standard linear solid model and a rotational spring component for the gel-type material, the analytical model of the coupled system is developed utilizing the generalized Hamilton's principle. The system is attached on top of a shaker and excited harmonically, and the time history of output voltage and accelerations are measured. The analytical model is verified by experimental results for the tip displacement, voltage, generated power, phase-portraits histories, and voltage FRF with harmonic base excitations. Transmissibility analysis by the analytical model shows that for excitation frequencies beyond a specific frequency, the viscoelastic material can magnify the amplitude of the excitation and incredibly improve the power generation. Experimental results demonstrate that by coupling the gel into the harvester, oscillations of the tip are increased into high energy orbits and large tip deflections around the resonance frequency. The significantly widened frequency bandwidth and the increased power output at specific input frequencies are the other results of considering the viscoelastic characteristics of the heart wall in the dynamic investigations. By simulating the response of the energy harvesting system to the heartbeat impulsive rhythm, when the energy harvesting system is attached to the viscoelastic material, the output power is increased from 18 to 55\u2009\u00b5W. The obtained results reveal that influence of the viscoelastic properties of the heart muscle is crucial in the accurate design of the energy harvesting system for the self-powered medical leadless pacemaker.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

In the unicellular phase, the calcium response through Piezo channels also functions in mechanosensing. However, calcium dynamics during multicellular morphogenesis are still unclear. Here, live imaging of cytosolic calcium revealed that calcium wave propagation, depending on cAMP relay, disappeared at the onset of multicellular body (slug) formation. Later, other forms of occasional calcium bursts and their propagation were observed in both anterior and posterior regions of migrating slugs. This calcium signaling also occurred in response to mechanical stimuli. Two pathways-calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum via IP3 receptor and calcium influx from outside the cell-were involved in calcium signals induced by mechanical stimuli.

{"title": "Minimally Invasive Local-Skull Electrophysiological Modification With Piezoelectric Drill.", "abstract": "The research on non-invasive BCI is nowadays hitting the bottleneck due to the humble quality of scalp EEG signals. Whereas invasive solutions that offer higher signal quality in contrast are suffocated in their spreading because of the potential surgical complication and health risks caused by electrode implantation. Therefore, it puts forward a necessity to explore a scheme that could both collect high-quality EEG signals and guarantee high-level operation safety.This study proposed a Minimally Invasive Local-skull Electrophysiological Modification method to improve scalp EEG signals qualities at specific brain regions. Six eight-month-old SD rats were used for in vivo verification experiment. A hole with a diameter of about 500 micrometers was drilled in the skull above the visual cortex of rats. Significant changes in rsEEG and SSVEP signals before and after modification were observed. After modification, the skull impedance of rats decreases by about 84 %, the average maximum bandwidth of rsEEG increase by 57 %, and the broadband SNR of SSVEP is increased by 5.13 dB. The time of piezoelectric drilling operation is strictly controlled under 30 seconds for each rat to prevent possible brain damage from overheating. Compared with traditional invasive procedures such as ECoG, Minimally Invasive Local-skull Electrophysiological Modification operation time is shorter and no electrode implantation is needed while it remarkably boosts the scalp EEG signal quality. This technical solution has the potential to replace the use of ECoG in certain application scenarios and further invigorate studies in the field of scalp EEG in the future.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "date": "2022-07-21", "authors": ["YikeSun", "AnruoShen", "JingnanSun", "ChenlinDu", "XiaogangChen", "YijunWang", "WeihuaPei", "XiaorongGao"], "doi": "10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3192543"}

Recently the world experienced a global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Although the vaccines are available, COVID-19 resulted a huge threat to the entire world with high mortality rates. Irrespective of a specific disease, there is a constant need for a cheaper and faster in-vitro, lab-on-a-chip sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity. Such sensors will not only facilitate the disease detection but will expedite and vaccine development process through detection of its corresponding antibodies when developed. In this article, we present an ultrasonic guided wave sensor using 128\u00b0 YX lithium niobate piezoelectric wafer, specially designed in a shape of a multi-threaded comb with cantilever beams which is equally selective and sensitive for the detection of corresponding antigen-antibody assays. As a proof of concept in this article, the diagnostic sensor is created and tested for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies. Sensors were functionalized with SARS-COV-2 antigens and target antibody for the same was detected. Unique and judicially tuned acoustic features are analyzed for successful detection of the right antibodies. The proposed lab-on-a-chip device utilizes a wide range of diagnostic frequencies resulting into a highly sensitive platform for the diagnostics even to the slightest biophysical changes. The proposed sensor is also believed to extend to the detection of various other antigens/antibodies of different diseases in the future.", "journal": "Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research", "date": "2022-07-21", "authors": ["DebdyutiMandal", "Mustahseen MIndaleeb", "AlexandraYounan", "SouravBanerjee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.sbsr.2022.100510\n10.1016/B978-0-12-822548-6.00080-7"}

The PVDF and SBS membranes retained much of the properties of PVDF, SBS, and native MIL-53(Al). The prepared MMMs were then placed in a vortex-stirred sample solution to develop a membrane solid-phase extraction method to extract estrogens and parabens, which were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The extraction efficiencies of the two membranes were compared, with the PVDF membrane exhibiting superior performance. In addition, the PVDF membrane was more freestanding and flexible, and its preparation method was also more facile and simple. The extraction conditions were optimized, and the analytical method showed low limits of detection (0.005-0.18\u2009ng/mL), good linearity, and high accuracy, with recoveries ranging from 90.7% to 102.5%. As a result, this membrane solid-phase extraction method indicated its potential for application in aqueous sample pretreatment.

However, deterioration in the mechanical strength of PLLANFs during the regeneration process leads to low osteoinductive performances. Additionally, their high hydrophobicity and limited piezoelectric properties have to be addressed concerning BTE. Herein, we report an efficient approach for fabricating high-performance PLLANF hybrid scaffolds for BTE by reinforcing amphiphilic triblock copolymer pluronic F-127 (PL)-functionalized nanofillers (PL-functionalized carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PL-cMWCNTs) and PL-functionalized exfoliated boron nitride nanosheets (PL-EBN)). The synergistic reinforcement effect from one-dimensional (1D) electrically conducting PL-cMWCNTs and two-dimensional (2D) piezoelectric PL-EBN was remarkable in PLLANFs, and the obtained PL-Hybrid (PL-cMWCNTs + PL-EBN) reinforced scaffolds have outperformed the mechanical strength, wettability, and piezoelectric performances of pristine PLLANFs. Consequently, in vitro biocompatibility results reveal the enhanced proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells on PL-Hybrid nanofiber scaffolds. Furthermore, the ALP activity, ARS staining, and comparable osteogenic gene expression results demonstrated significant osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells on PL-Hybrid nanofiber scaffolds than on the pristine PLLANF scaffold. Thus, the reported approach for constructing high-performance piezoelectric biodegradable scaffolds for BTE by the synergistic effect of PL-cMWCNTs and PL-EBN holds great promise in tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2022-07-20", "authors": ["MadeshwaranSekkarapatti Ramasamy", "VigneshKrishnamoorthi Kaliannagounder", "AshiqurRahaman", "Chan HeePark", "Cheol SangKim", "ByungkiKim"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c00459"}

{"title": "Sleep Staging Using Noncontact-Measured Vital Signs.", "abstract": "As a physiological phenomenon, sleep takes up approximately 30% of human life and significantly affects people's quality of life. To assess the quality of night sleep, polysomnography (PSG) has been recognized as the gold standard for sleep staging. The drawbacks of such a clinical device, however, are obvious, since PSG limits the patient's mobility during the night, which is inconvenient for in-home monitoring. In this paper, a noncontact vital signs monitoring system using the piezoelectric sensors is deployed. Using the so-designed noncontact sensing system, heartbeat interval (HI), respiratory interval (RI), and body movements (BM) are separated and recorded, from which a new dimension of vital signs, referred to as the coordination of heartbeat interval and respiratory interval (CHR), is obtained. By extracting both the independent features of HI, RI, and BM and the coordinated features of CHR in different timescales, Wake-REM-NREM sleep staging is performed, and a postprocessing of staging fusion algorithm is proposed to refine the accuracy of classification. A total of 17 all-night recordings of noncontact measurement simultaneous with PSG from 10 healthy subjects were examined, and the leave-one-out cross-validation was adopted to assess the performance of Wake-REM-NREM sleep staging.

{"title": "Biomechanical microenvironment in peripheral nerve regeneration: from pathophysiological understanding to tissue engineering development.", "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) caused by trauma, chronic disease and other factors may lead to partial or complete loss of sensory, motor and autonomic functions, as well as neuropathic pain. Biological activities are always accompanied by mechanical stimulation, and biomechanical microenvironmental homeostasis plays a complicated role in tissue repair and regeneration. Recent studies have focused on the effects of biomechanical microenvironment on peripheral nervous system development and function maintenance, as well as neural regrowth following PNI. For example, biomechanical factors-induced cluster gene expression changes contribute to formation of peripheral nerve structure and maintenance of physiological function. In addition, extracellular matrix and cell responses to biomechanical microenvironment alterations after PNI directly trigger a series of cascades for the well-organized peripheral nerve regeneration (PNR) process, where cell adhesion molecules, cytoskeletons and mechanically gated ion channels serve as mechanosensitive units, mechanical effector including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) as mechanotransduction elements. With the rapid development of tissue engineering techniques, a substantial number of PNR strategies such as aligned nerve guidance conduits, three-dimensional topological designs and piezoelectric scaffolds emerge expected to improve the neural biomechanical microenvironment in case of PNI. These tissue engineering nerve grafts display optimized mechanical properties and outstanding mechanomodulatory effects, but a few bottlenecks restrict their application scenes. In this review, the current understanding in biomechanical microenvironment homeostasis associated with peripheral nerve function and PNR is integrated, where we proposed the importance of balances of mechanosensitive elements, cytoskeletal structures, mechanotransduction cascades, and extracellular matrix components; a wide variety of promising tissue engineering strategies based on biomechanical modulation are introduced with some suggestions and prospects for future directions.", "journal": "Theranostics", "date": "2022-07-16", "authors": ["LingchiKong", "XinGao", "YunQian", "WeiSun", "ZhengweiYou", "CunyiFan"], "doi": "10.7150/thno.74571"}

The scientific literature has long highlighted the impact of anxiety, stress, and depression on CTS. The goal of this case report is to highlight how the emotional state of patients and their neuro-psychomotor behavior induce a state of constant muscular tension which, through the physical phenomenon of piezoelectricity, causes calcium salts to precipitate and form calcifications. Therefore, stress, anxiety, and depression are likely factors underlying the etiopathogenesis of CTS. Consistent with this interpretation, this report presents five cases of CTS treated with three specific neurobiological stimulation treatments using the radioelectric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology, which has demonstrated its effectiveness on alterations in postural attitude intended as neuro-psychomotor behavior, anxiety, stress, and depression, as well as on autonomic and metabolic alterations of the tissues at a local level.

{"title": "Health monitoring of bacterial concrete structure under dynamic loading using electro-mechanical impedance technique: a numerical approach.", "abstract": "Health monitoring of structures using techniques based on the smart material is an innovative concept that is exploding technological revolutions in the field of civil engineering. The electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique is used for structural health monitoring (SHM) and to investigate the damages in the structures. The bacterial incorporation in concrete produces calcite material through metabolism process in presence of moisture and carbon dioxide, which improves the mechanical properties of concrete. Hence, its application in construction of the buildings will improve the health of structures. In this research paper, dynamic behaviour of the bacterial concrete was investigated numerically. The beams of size 700\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u00a0mm of bacterial concrete and control concrete were modelled using finite element-based package ANSYS19. The beam of bacterial concrete was simulated as per the characteristics of the materials produced after the bacterial metabolism reactions. The EMI technique was applied to investigate the health of these beams. Admittance (conductance and susceptance) signatures were determined using piezo-ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors installed at mid-point on the top surface of concrete beams. The beams were exposed to dynamic loading and the intensity of dynamic loading was increased in four sub-steps. For the quantification of strength development in the concrete beam, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) statistical index had been applied. It was observed that the bacterial concrete beam has more resistance to the dynamic loading.", "journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "date": "2022-07-15", "authors": ["Krishna KumarMaurya", "AnupamRawat", "RamaShanker"], "doi": "10.1007/s11356-022-21949-6\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.05.119\n10.1007/s10295-010-0901-8\n10.1061/(asce)mt.1943-5533.0000159\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.99-100.1157\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.046\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2000)126:7(711)\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.11.086\n10.1016/j.adhoc.2018.06.011\n10.1177/1045389X08100384\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(154)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(166)\n10.1177/1045389X04046309\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2003.07.001\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2016.01.009\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2005.03.005\n10.1106/N0J5-6UJ2-WlGV-Q8MC\n10.1080/09349847.2015.1044587\n10.1016/j.ecoleng.2008.12.036\n10.1007/s13369-016-2285-1\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.11.006\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.04.004\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.07.040\n10.1177/1475921717703053\n10.1177/1045389X9700800406\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095003\n10.1016/j.stmat.2018.11.006\n10.1177/1045389X12440754\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.01.059\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2019.103340\n10.1117/12.424404\n10.1177/1045389X11414219\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.02.017\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.02.002\n10.1177/1045389X14554133\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.02.033\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.08.025\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.06.080\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2011.03.012\n10.1146/annurev.energy.26.1.303\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.08.013\n10.3390/s101211644\n10.1016/j.micres.2016.03.010"}

{"title": "Using a Traveling-Wave Piezoelectric Device to Generate a Liquid Wave for Efficient Lightweight Particle Transfer.", "abstract": "In this study, the transfer process of extremely light and small-sized particles along a defined direction without flipping them over on the transportation surface is evaluated by using a traveling wave. For this, the use of a liquid, as the contact layer injected onto the top surface of a piezoelectric traveling-wave device, is proposed to transmit the wave into the particles. As a preload is unlikely to be assigned here, the adhesion force between the lightweight particle and the liquid is expected to dominate the delivery effect. A short-beam linear motor is chosen as an example of a piezoelectric device that can generate a traveling wave in association with several selected liquids such as water, saline water, oil, and glycerol. The influence on the traveling-wave amplitude transmitted to liquids with different viscosities and heights is studied by an analytical approach and the finite-element simulation. The surface energy theory is used to determine the adhesion force between the liquid and the lightweight particle. An experiment is conducted to measure the speed of particles with variable sizes that are transported by the liquid wave. The analytical and experimental results are in good agreement, verifying the influence of the above concerned factors on the particle transfer speed.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-07-15", "authors": ["YungTing", "Chih-HsuanYu", "SuhailAbbas", "Yu-ChinChien"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3190877"}

{"title": "Air-liquid interface cultivation of Navicula incerta using hollow fiber membranes.", "abstract": "Microalgae cultivation in open ponds requires a large footprint, while most photobioreactors need improvement in the ratio of surface to volume and energy consumption. In this study, polyethersulfone (PES) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes with a large surface area were rearranged into open-ended and dead-ended configurations to improve the air-liquid interface cultivation of Navicula incerta. N. incerta were successfully grown on the porous membrane surface with the nutrients circulating inside the lumen. Fourier-transform infrared spectra showed the accumulation of polysaccharides, proteins and humic acids. Hydrophilic polysaccharides reduced water contact angles on PES and PVDF membranes to 37.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00b0 and 55.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00b0, respectively.

Scanning electron images further confirmed that N. incerta, cell debris and extracellular organic matter accumulated on the membrane. With large pores and a hydrophobic surface, PVDF hollow fiber membranes offered a greater improvement in N. incerta cell growth rate compared to PES hollow fiber membranes despite using different configurations. In the dead-ended configuration, they even attained the greatest improvement in N. incerta growth rate, up to 54.0%. However, PES hollow fiber membranes only achieved improvement in harvesting efficiency within the range of 18.7-38.0% due to weak cell adhesion.

Materials that are capable of harvesting energy from the surrounding environment are advantageous for autonomous electrically powered systems. However, most energy harvesting materials are non-structural and add parasitic mass, reducing structural efficiency. Here, we show a structural energy harvesting composite material consisting of two carbon fiber (CF) layers embedded in a structural battery electrolyte (SBE) with a longitudinal modulus of 100 GPa\u2500almost on par with commercial CF pre-pregs. Energy is harvested through mechanical deformations using the piezo-electrochemical transducer (PECT) effect in lithiated CFs. The PECT effect creates a voltage difference between the two CF layers, driving a current when deformed. A specific power output of 18 nW/g is achieved. The PECT effect in the lithiated CFs is observed in tension and compression and can be used for strain sensing, enabling structural health monitoring with low added mass.

{"title": "Impact of Polymers on Magnesium-Based Hydrogen Storage Systems.", "abstract": "In the present scenario, much importance has been provided to hydrogen energy systems (HES) in the energy sector because of their clean and green behavior during utilization. The developments of novel techniques and materials have focused on overcoming the practical difficulties in the HES (production, storage and utilization). Comparatively, considerable attention needs to be provided in the hydrogen storage systems (HSS) because of physical-based storage (compressed gas, cold/cryo compressed and liquid) issues such as low gravimetric/volumetric density, storage conditions/parameters and safety. In material-based HSS, a high amount of hydrogen can be effectively stored in materials via physical or chemical bonds. In different hydride materials, Mg-based hydrides (Mg-H) showed considerable benefits such as low density, hydrogen uptake and reversibility. However, the inferior sorption kinetics and severe oxidation/contamination at exposure to air limit its benefits. There are numerous kinds of efforts, like the inclusion of catalysts that have been made for Mg-H to alter the thermodynamic-related issues. Still, those efforts do not overcome the oxidation/contamination-related issues. The developments of Mg-H encapsulated by gas-selective polymers can effectively and positively influence hydrogen sorption kinetics and prevent the Mg-H from contaminating (air and moisture). In this review, the impact of different polymers (carboxymethyl cellulose, polystyrene, polyimide, polypyrrole, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polymethylpentene, and poly(methyl methacrylate)) with Mg-H systems has been systematically reviewed.

Furthermore, there is a lack of explicit extraction of the compression mode piezoelectric coefficient (d33) in ex situ rGO doped PVDF composite films prepared using low-cost, solution-cast processes. In this work, we describe an optimal procedure for preparing high-quality pristine and nano-composite PVDF films using solution-casting and thermal poling. We then verify their electromechanical properties by rigorously characterizing \u03b2-phase concentration, crystallinity, piezoelectric coefficient, dielectric permittivity, and loss tangent. We also demonstrate a novel stationary atomic force microscope (AFM) technique designed to reduce non-piezoelectric influences on the extraction of d33 in PVDF films. We then discuss the benefits of our d33 measurements technique over commercially sourced piezometers and conventional piezoforce microscopy (PFM). Characterization outcomes from our in-house synthesized films demonstrate that the introduction of 0.3%w.t. rGO nanoparticles in a solution-cast only marginally changes the \u03b2-phase concentration from 83.7% to 81.7% and decreases the crystallinity from 42.4% to 37.3%, whereas doping increases the piezoelectric coefficient by 28% from d33 = 45 pm/V to d33 = 58 pm/V, while also improving the dielectric by 28%. The piezoelectric coefficients of our films were generally higher but comparable to other in situ prepared PVDF/rGO composite films, while the dielectric permittivity and \u03b2-phase concentrations were found to be lower.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-07-10", "authors": ["DaneHintermueller", "RaviPrakash"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14132546\n10.1070/RCR4860\n10.1039/c1ee02241e\n10.1002/tee.21840\n10.1080/10739140701255631\n10.1016/j.memsci.2005.01.015\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.04.002\n10.1021/acsanm.9b00033\n10.1002/app.31488\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.12.019\n10.3390/s20185214\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2021.109312\n10.1039/c0jm01265c\n10.1016/j.matdes.2021.110273\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2017.04.004\n10.1007/s12274-021-3490-0\n10.1038/ncomms2639\n10.3390/polym12122905\n10.1021/ma00229a008\n10.1080/00222340902837527\n10.1002/polb.23146\n10.1088/2053-1591/ab2d85\n10.1039/C5CC01688F\n10.3390/mi11121076\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.07.005\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.01.005\n10.1021/acsami.8b17085\n10.1002/smll.201804779\n10.1002/adv.21956\n10.1002/advs.202100864\n10.3390/polym11061065\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.07.118\n10.1039/C4RA07379G\n10.1016/j.jiec.2018.07.022\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1063/1.1735059\n10.1557/JMR.2002.0138\n10.1109/TUFFC.2006.170\n10.1016/j.cap.2016.12.012\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.01.035\n10.1002/app.44940\n10.1039/C5NR02067K\n10.1002/app.46324\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2008.03.016\n10.1021/acsomega.8b00237\n10.1016/j.vibspec.2011.11.005\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01018\n10.1063/1.1600515\n10.1016/B978-1-45-573058-2.00006-1\n10.1063/1.122914\n10.1109/T-SU.1978.30994\n10.1109/58.19169\n10.3390/s20144051\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.11.012\n10.1002/pc.25581\n10.1002/app.23137\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.04.118\n10.1007/s10853-010-4515-3\n10.1016/j.molstruc.2018.05.083\n10.1515/epoly-2013-0119\n10.1080/00222348.2016.1170253\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.09.019\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.02.012\n10.1002/pol.1973.180110804\n10.1088/0957-4484/18/47/475504\n10.1021/nn901397r\n10.1039/c4cp01004c\n10.1002/adma.200801758\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2012.03.082"}
{"title": "Possibility to Alter Dynamics of Luminescence from Surface of Polymer Membrane with Ultrasonic Waves.", "abstract": "The temporal dynamics of luminescence from the surface of Nafion polymer membranes have been studied. In fact, the polymer membrane was soaked in liquids with different contents of deuterium. The test liquids were ordinary (natural) water (deuterium content equal to 157 ppm) and deuterium-depleted water (deuterium content is equal to 3 ppm). Simultaneously with the excitation of luminescence, the Nafion plate was irradiated with ultrasonic pulses, having a duration of 1 \u03bcs. The ultrasonic waves were generated with different repetition rates and amplitudes, and irradiated the surface of Nafion in the geometry of grazing or normal incidence. Luminescence regimes were studied when the membrane was irradiated with one ultrasonic wave (one piezoelectric transducer) or two counter-propagating waves (two piezoelectric transducers). It turned out that ultrasonic waves, which fall normal to the membrane interface, do not affect the dynamics of luminescence. At the same time, in the case of ultrasonic irradiation in the grazing incidence geometry, sharp jumps in the luminescence intensity occur, and the behavior of these jumps substantially depends on the mode of irradiation: one or two piezoelectric transducers. This allows for control of the dynamics of luminescence from the polymer surface. In accordance with this model, the possibility of altering the luminescence dynamics is due to the effect of unwinding the polymer fibers from the surface toward the liquid bulk upon soaking. It is important that such unwinding does not occur in deuterium-depleted water, which was confirmed in a direct experiment with dynamic light scattering from polydisperse aqueous suspensions of Nafion nanometer-sized particles; these suspensions were prepared in ordinary water and deuterium-depleted water. Thus, ultrasonic irradiation affects the dynamics of luminescence only when Nafion is swollen in ordinary water; in the case of deuterium-depleted water this effect is missed.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-07-10", "authors": ["Nikolai FBunkin", "Maxim EAstashev", "Polina NBolotskova", "Valeriy AKozlov", "Artem OKravchenko", "Egor INagaev", "Maria AOkuneva"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14132542\n10.1021/cr0207123\n10.1134/S2517751622010073\n10.1109/TED.2021.3137088\n10.3389/fchem.2021.807244\n10.5599/jese.1117\n10.1016/j.talanta.2021.123202\n10.1007/s13726-021-01015-7\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c09531\n10.3390/polym14010080\n10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.038\n10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138133\n10.3390/membranes11090713\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.12.065\n10.1016/j.memsci.2005.05.002\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.09.030\n10.1139/V10-117\n10.1021/la051866r\n10.1021/ma049153n\n10.1016/S0032-3861(01)00049-0\n10.1021/jp4100729\n10.1063/1.5042065\n10.3390/polym13091443\n10.3390/polym13162635\n10.3390/polym14040688\n10.1126/science.133.3467.1833\n10.3390/polym12122888\n10.3390/polym14081511\n10.1016/0009-2614(95)00045-6\n10.1002/andp.19484370105\n10.1021/bi00617a025\n10.1021/ma102361f\n10.12743/quanta.v1i1.5\n10.1109/PROC.1965.4253\n10.1016/0022-460X(78)90388-7\n10.2514/2.6443\n10.1122/1.5113739"}
{"title": "A Drifter-Based Self-Powered Piezoelectric Sensor for Ocean Wave Measurements.", "abstract": "Recently, piezoelectric materials have received remarkable attention in marine applications for energy harvesting from the ocean, which is a harsh environment with powerful and impactful waves and currents. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, although there are various designs of piezoelectric energy harvesters for marine applications, piezoelectric materials have not been employed for sensory and measurement applications in marine environment. In the present research, a drifter-based piezoelectric sensor is proposed to measure ocean waves' height and period. To analyze the motion principle and the working performance of the proposed drifter-based piezoelectric sensor, a dynamic model was developed. The developed dynamic model investigated the system's response to an input of ocean waves and provides design insights into the geometrical and material parameters. Next, finite element analysis (FEA) simulations using the commercial software COMSOL-Multiphysics were carried out with the help of a coupled physics analysis of Solid Mechanics and Electrostatics Modules to achieve the output voltages. An experimental prototype was fabricated and tested to validate the results of the dynamic model and the FEA simulation. A slider-crank mechanism was used to mimic ocean waves throughout the experiment, and the results showed a close match between the proposed dynamic modeling, FEA simulations, and experimental testing. In the end, a short discussion is devoted to interpreting the output results, comparing the results of the simulations with those of the experimental testing, sensor's resolution, and the self-powering functionality of the proposed drifter-based piezoelectric sensor.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-10", "authors": ["Seyyed MasoudKargar", "GuangboHao"], "doi": "10.3390/s22135050\n10.3406/bulmi.1880.1564\n10.1007/s40722-014-0008-9\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.04.002\n10.1088/0957-0233/19/6/065703\n10.1039/D0RA03293J\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.02.041\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00476-3\n10.1016/S0019-0578(07)60151-7\n10.3390/s130505478\n10.1016/0921-8890(88)90009-7\n10.1002/adma.202005448\n10.3390/s130506365\n10.3390/act10050101\n10.1016/j.enconman.2016.01.030\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.049\n10.1021/acsami.7b08541\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.016\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2018.12.008\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.12.038\n10.1109/COMST.2021.3053118\n10.1145/1107548.1107617\n10.1088/0960-1317/13/2/307\n10.1002/aelm.202100277\n10.1007/s10832-007-9043-4\n10.3390/en12112184\n10.3390/s22051949\n10.1109/JOE.2019.2933131\n10.1002/9781118476406.emoe077\n10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.124\n10.3390/s22010078\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2976517\n10.1109/T-SU.1974.29802\n10.3390/ma14195736\n10.7567/JJAP.52.10MB01"}
{"title": "Determination of Lamb Wave Modes on Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Piezoelectric Transducers.", "abstract": "This work presents a method to determine the type of Lamb mode (antisymmetric or symmetric) that propagates through a lithium-ion pouch cell. To determine the type of mode and the group velocity at a specific frequency, two- and three-transducer setups were created. For these setups, it is important that all transducers have the same polarization direction. Two transducers are affixed to the center of the cell at a distance of several centimeters from each other so that the group velocity can be determined. Using cross-correlation, the group velocity of the emerging mode can be calculated. The measurement setup and the processing method was first validated with experiments on acrylic glass and aluminum plates. The measurements were supported with FEM simulations and a numerically calculated model. The output voltages of the receiving piezo-elements obtained in the FEM simulation are in agreement with the underlying theories. The phase shift, which results from the output voltage of the piezo-elements mounted one above the other on different sides of the plate, shows the type of mode. The results of the experimental determination of the Lamb mode that propagates through a lithium-ion pouch cell were validated with a numerically calculated multi-layer model and therefore validate this novel experimental approach.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-10", "authors": ["MarkusKoller", "GregorGlanz", "AlexanderBergmann", "HartmutPopp"], "doi": "10.3390/s22134748\n10.1016/B978-0-12-418691-0.00001-0\n10.3390/ma10060616\n10.3390/ma10060648\n10.3390/ma10070832\n10.1016/j.est.2020.101859\n10.12783/shm2019/32215\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.056\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2955556\n10.3390/s17122858\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.05.003\n10.1106/8BFB-GC8P-XQ47-YCQ0\n10.1007/978-3-540-68427-5\n10.1016/B0-12-227410-5/00687-6\n10.1016/j.egyr.2021.05.015\n10.3390/en11010150\n10.3390/en12030504\n10.1016/j.etran.2020.100098"}

Three major impacts are discussed and evaluated in this paper-partial removal, complete removal, and drop deformations of the seal. These impacts were compared with the ambient responses to distinguish the conditions. All three impact cases show distinct characteristics in terms of sensor values, pulses, and pulse widths. For partial removal and complete removal of the seal, both cases exhibited maximum sensor values but differed in pulse and pulse width. A partially removed seal experienced the maximum number of pulses while complete removal experienced the maximum pulse width.

{"title": "Effect of Fabrication Method on the Thermo Mechanical and Electrical Properties of Graphene Doped PVDF Nanocomposites.", "abstract": "Nanocomposites of poly (vinylidene fluoride) PVDF with graphene nanoflakes (GNF) were prepared using two different routes. Initially, a mix-melting method was used to prepare composites, and their thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated to choose the better method for future experiment and properties investigation. Then, nanocomposite films were prepared by a simple solution-casting technique using a PVDF/graphene solution. In both cases, the amount of graphene was varied to observe and to compare their thermal and mechanical properties. The addition of graphene to the PVDF matrix resulted in changes in the crystallization and melting behaviors as confirmed by DSC analyses. Increasing the graphene content led to improved thermal stability of the PVDF nanocomposites prepared using both methods. Improvements in mechanical properties by the addition of graphene were also observed.

{"title": "Electroactive Polymer-Based Composites for Artificial Muscle-like Actuators: A Review.", "abstract": "Unlike traditional actuators, such as piezoelectric ceramic or metallic actuators, polymer actuators are currently attracting more interest in biomedicine due to their unique properties, such as light weight, easy processing, biodegradability, fast response, large active strains, and good mechanical properties. They can be actuated under external stimuli, such as chemical (pH changes), electric, humidity, light, temperature, and magnetic field. Electroactive polymers (EAPs), called 'artificial muscles', can be activated by an electric stimulus, and fixed into a temporary shape. Restoring their permanent shape after the release of an electrical field, electroactive polymer is considered the most attractive actuator type because of its high suitability for prosthetics and soft robotics applications. However, robust control, modeling non-linear behavior, and scalable fabrication are considered the most critical challenges for applying the soft robotic systems in real conditions. Researchers from around the world investigate the scientific and engineering foundations of polymer actuators, especially the principles of their work, for the purpose of a better control of their capability and durability. The activation method of actuators and the realization of required mechanical properties are the main restrictions on using actuators in real applications. The latest highlights, operating principles, perspectives, and challenges of electroactive materials (EAPs) such as dielectric EAPs, ferroelectric polymers, electrostrictive graft elastomers, liquid crystal elastomers, ionic gels, and ionic polymer-metal composites are reviewed in this article.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-10", "authors": ["Aleksey VMaksimkin", "TarekDayyoub", "Dmitry VTelyshev", "Alexander YuGerasimenko"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12132272\n10.1117/12.847240\n10.1117/12.475183\n10.1063/1.4740023\n10.1016/B978-0-08-100741-9.00003-6\n10.1016/j.addr.2020.09.011\n10.1002/adma.200904059\n10.3390/s18113605\n10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70018-4\n10.1002/app.50406\n10.1016/j.jpcs.2020.109774\n10.2514/6.2001-1492\n10.5301/jabfm.5000184\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111565\n10.1038/s41598-017-07982-3\n10.1016/j.jmrt.2021.10.029\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2019.103136\n10.1126/sciadv.abe9495\n10.1002/aisy.202000125\n10.3390/app10020640\n10.1021/acs.macromol.1c00362\n10.1002/marc.202100732\n10.1039/C8CS00963E\n10.1002/adem.201700762\n10.1016/j.cej.2022.136000\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.131354\n10.1021/acsami.6b13770\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112830\n10.1016/b978-0-08-102135-4.00008-4\n10.1007/978-0-387-76540-2_2\n10.1039/C6TA09590A\n10.1109/14.30878\n10.1063/1.322685\n10.1121/1.387225\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/3/033001\n10.1126/science.280.5372.2101\n10.1007/978-3-319-31530-0_22\n10.1117/12.548647\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac3d9d\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.113255\n10.1557/PROC-600-131\n10.1088/1361-648X/aa5706\n10.1039/b413835j\n10.1080/00150190490464827\n10.1038/35068522\n10.1016/j.xcrp.2020.100276\n10.1117/12.880528\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2005.09.009\n10.1246/cl.1985.1285\n10.1007/s42558-019-0005-1\n10.1002/marc.201800246\n10.1002/adma.201504152\n10.1021/acs.macromol.5b00882\n10.1038/nature11409\n10.1088/0957-4484/19/32/325501\n10.3390/ma11091615\n10.1016/j.jmrt.2019.11.052\n10.3389/frobt.2019.00114\n10.1007/978-3-319-31767-0_11-1\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.084\n10.1039/C8TC04079F\n10.1063/1.4939265\n10.1021/acs.macromol.8b01430\n10.1016/j.jcis.2022.03.086\n10.1038/ncomms14305\n10.1007/s10853-016-9727-8\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.06.171\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.132430\n10.1016/j.apt.2022.103528\n10.3390/polym14010080\n10.1007/s10008-020-04520-6\n10.1016/j.jmps.2021.104394\n10.1007/s12541-012-0020-8\n10.1080/19475411.2014.914108\n10.1063/1.4892636\n10.1021/acsami.8b04250\n10.1088/1361-665X/aafa5a"}

This paper therefore provides a complete set of elastic and piezoelectric coefficients, as well as complex dielectric constants and the electrical conductivity, for congruent monocrystalline LiNbO3 from 25 \u00b0C to 900 \u00b0C at atmospheric pressure. An inverse approach using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) resonance method was used to determine the materials\u2019 coefficients and constants. Single crystal Y-cut and Z-cut samples were used to estimate the twelve coefficients defining the electromechanical coupling of LiNbO3. We employed an analytical model inversion to calculate the coefficients based on a linear superposition of nine different bulk acoustic waves (three longitudinal waves and six shear waves), in addition to considering the thermal expansion of the crystal. The results are reported and compared with those of other studies for which the literature has available values. The dominant piezoelectric stress constant was found to be e15, which remained virtually constant between 25 \u00b0C and 600 \u00b0C; thereafter, it decreased by approximately 10% between 600 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C.

{"title": "Topology Optimization of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters for Enhanced Open-Circuit Voltage Subjected to Harmonic Excitations.", "abstract": "Energy harvesting devices made of piezoelectric material are highly anticipated energy sources for power wireless sensors. Tremendous efforts have been made to improve the performance of piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs). Noticeably, topology optimization has shown an attractive potential to design PEHs with enhanced energy conversion efficiency. In this work, an alternative yet more practical design objective was considered, where the open-circuit voltage of PEHs is enhanced by topologically optimizing the through-thickness piezoelectric material distribution of plate-type PEHs subjected to harmonic excitations. Compared to the conventional efficiency-enhanced designs, the open-circuit voltage of PEHs can be evidently enhanced by the proposed method while with negligible sacrifice on the energy conversion efficiency. Numerical investigations show that the voltage cancellation effect due to inconsistent voltage phases can be effectively ameliorated by optimally distributed piezoelectric materials.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-07-10", "authors": ["MengHe", "MuHe", "XiaopengZhang", "LiangXia"], "doi": "10.3390/ma15134423\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.011\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab36e4\n10.1063/1.2344868\n10.1016/j.eml.2017.05.002\n10.1007/s00366-016-0460-3\n10.1007/s12206-011-0910-1\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2904025\n10.1063/1.5049852\n10.1007/s00542-009-1000-5\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/10/104013\n10.1177/1045389X13489365\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/115023\n10.3390/app7020134\n10.1016/j.jmps.2016.03.027\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.114261\n10.1007/s00158-008-0265-0\n10.1016/j.cma.2010.04.008\n10.1016/S0045-7825(02)00559-5\n10.1007/s11465-020-0588-0\n10.1016/j.cma.2010.06.021\n10.1016/j.cma.2013.07.003\n10.1016/j.finel.2007.06.006\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.113783\n10.1016/j.advengsoft.2012.07.008\n10.1007/s00158-020-02726-w\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.1177/1045389X09341200\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/057001\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.03.023\n10.1007/s00158-013-0889-6\n10.1109/58.55314\n10.1088/0964-1726/8/3/307\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.114846\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2022.115389\n10.1177/1045389X05054043\n10.1177/1045389X05054044\n10.1002/nme.1620240207\n10.1007/s00158-013-0978-6"}
{"title": "Large Vertical Piezoelectricity in a Janus Cr", "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials have potential applications in nanoscale sensors and spintronic devices. Herein, motivated by experimental synthesis of a CrI3 monolayer possessing intrinsic magnetism and a Janus MoSSe monolayer with piezoelectricity, we propose a 2D Janus Cr2I3F3 monolayer as a multifunctional material exhibiting both piezoelectricity and ferromagnetism. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the structural stability and the electronic, magnetic, and piezoelectric properties of the Janus Cr2I3F3 monolayer. We predicted that a vertical polarization of up to -0.155 \u00d7 10-10 C/m is induced in the Cr2I3F3 monolayer due to the breaking of symmetry. The origination mechanism of polarization was demonstrated in terms of a local dipole moment calculated by maximally localized Wannier functions. Meanwhile, it was found that a remarkable piezoelectric response can be produced under a uniaxial strain in the basal plane. The calculated piezoelectric coefficients of the Cr2I3F3 monolayer compare favorably with those of the frequently used bulk piezoelectric materials such as \u03b1-quartz and wurtzite AlN.

Here, we demonstrate the tunability of strong gauge fields in nonlocal experiments using a large planar graphene sheet that conforms to the deformation of a piezoelectric layer by a surface acoustic wave. The acoustic wave induces a longitudinal and a giant synthetic Hall voltage in the absence of external magnetic fields. The superposition of a synthetic Hall potential and a conventional Hall voltage can annihilate the sample's transverse potential at large external magnetic fields. Surface acoustic waves thus provide a promising and facile avenue for the exploitation of gauge fields in large planar graphene systems.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2022-07-09", "authors": ["PaiZhao", "Chithra HSharma", "RenrongLiang", "ChristianGlasenapp", "LevMourokh", "Vadim MKovalev", "PatrickHuber", "MartaPrada", "LarsTiemann", "Robert HBlick"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.256601"}

{"title": "Origin of giant electric-field-induced strain in faulted alkali niobate films.", "abstract": "A large electromechanical response in ferroelectrics is highly desirable for developing high-performance sensors and actuators. Enhanced electromechanical coupling in ferroelectrics is usually obtained at morphotropic phase boundaries requiring stoichiometric control of complex compositions. Recently it was shown that giant piezoelectricity can be obtained in films with nanopillar structures. Here, we elucidate its origin in terms of atomic structure and demonstrate a different system with a greatly enhanced response. This is in non-stoichiometric potassium sodium niobate epitaxial thin films with a high density of self-assembled planar faults. A giant piezoelectric coefficient of \u223c1900 picometer per volt is demonstrated at 1\u2009kHz, which is almost double the highest ever reported effective piezoelectric response in any existing thin films.

Piezo channels transduce mechanical stimulation into cellular signaling in a variety of tissues and organ systems. The functional roles of Piezo1 and Piezo2 have been revealed in both developmental and physiological scenarios by using mouse genetic models. Mechanotransduction by Piezo1 channels regulates osteoblast/osteocyte activity and, thus, strengthens the skeleton enabling it to adapt to a wide range of mechanical loadings. Deletion of the Piezo1 gene in the developing skeleton causes bone malformations that lead to spontaneous bone fractures, while inactivity of Piezo1 in adulthood results in osteoporosis. Furthermore, Piezo2 channels in sensory neurons might provide another route of skeletal regulation. Piezo channels also regulate the proliferation and differentiation of various types of stem cells. PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 mutations and channel malfunctions have been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases, and PIEZO channels are currently emerging as potential targets for disease treatment.

The protein family is constituted by other 4 members (besides STOML3): STOM, STOML1, STOML2 and podocin. Interestingly, STOML3 with STOM and STOML1 are expressed in other peripheral sensory neurons: dorsal root ganglia. In here, they functionally interact and modulate the activity of the mechanosensitive Piezo channels and members of the ASIC family. Therefore, we investigated whether STOM and STOML1 are expressed together with STOML3 in the OSNs and whether they could interact. We found that all three are indeed expressed in ONSs, although STOML1 at very low level. STOM and STOML3 share a similar expression pattern and STOML3 is necessary for STOM to properly localize to OSN cilia. In addition, we extended our investigation to podocin and STOML2, and while the former is not expressed in the olfactory system, the latter showed a peculiar expression pattern in multiple cell types.

The effect of the distance between the magnets, the spring stiffness ratio and mass ratio of the two dynamic magnifiers, and the load resistance on the performance of the harvester is investigated. Analytical results show that compared with the bistable piezoelectric energy harvester with a typical spring-mass dynamic magnifier, the proposed new-type energy harvester system with a two-spring-mass dynamic magnifier can provide higher output power over a broader frequency band, and increasing the mass ratio of the magnifier tip mass to the tip magnet can significantly increase the output power of the BPEH\u2009+\u2009TDM system.

Herein, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/GE composite membranes with controllable pore structure were fabricated with a simple non-solvent-induced phase separation method. The change of crystallinity and crystal structure (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, etc.) generated is due to the addition of GE, which benefits the design of a suitable pore structure for oil channels. Meanwhile, the hydrophobicity and thermal stability of the composite membrane were obviously enhanced. With 3 wt % GE, the contact angle was 124.6\u00b0, which was increased greatly compared to that of the GE-0 sample.

For example, the composite membrane showed better oil-water separation properties when the coagulation bath was dioctyl phthalate.

{"title": "Optical-Beam-Induced Current in InAs/InP Nanowires for Hot-Carrier Photovoltaics.", "abstract": "Using the excess energy of charge carriers excited above the band edge (hot carriers) could pave the way for optoelectronic devices, such as photovoltaics exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit or ultrafast photodetectors. Semiconducting nanowires show promise as a platform for hot-carrier extraction. Proof of principle photovoltaic devices have already been realized based on InAs nanowires, using epitaxially defined InP segments as energy filters that selectively transmit hot electrons. However, it is not yet fully understood how charge-carrier separation, relaxation, and recombination depend on device design and on the location of optical excitation. Here, we introduce the use of an optical-beam-induced current (OBIC) characterization method, employing a laser beam focused close to the diffraction limit and a high precision piezo stage, to study the optoelectric performance of the nanowire device as a function of the position of excitation. The photocurrent response agrees well with modeling based on hot-electron extraction across the InP segment via diffusion. We demonstrate that the device is capable of producing power and estimate the spatial region within which significant hot-electron extraction can take place to be on the order of 300 nm away from the barrier. When comparing to other experiments on similar nanowires, we find good qualitative agreement, confirming the interpretation of the device function, while the extracted diffusion length of hot electrons varies. Careful control of the excitation and device parameters will be important to reach the potentially high device performance theoretically available in these systems.", "journal": "ACS applied energy materials", "date": "2022-07-06", "authors": ["JonatanFast", "Yen-PoLiu", "YangChen", "LarsSamuelson", "Adam MBurke", "HeinerLinke", "AndersMikkelsen"], "doi": "10.1021/acsaem.2c01208\n10.1088/1361-6641/ab8171\n10.1038/nnano.2014.311\n10.1021/acsphotonics.0c01003\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03871\n10.1063/5.0038263\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/49/495606\n10.1063/1.1447312\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b00251\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04873\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00536\n10.1088/1361-6528/aa8984\n10.1103/PhysRevB.81.155210\n10.1038/s41560-020-0602-0\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab9bd7\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b01962\n10.1021/nl1038456\n10.1021/nl050631x\n10.1088/0022-3727/48/35/355105\n10.1103/PhysRevB.93.235204\n10.1088/0957-4484/21/20/205703\n10.1016/j.ssc.2004.05.033\n10.1088/0957-4484/18/10/105307\n10.1103/PhysRev.134.A713\n10.1063/1.118271\n10.1088/0034-4885/55/4/002\n10.1093/jmicro/dfs048\n10.1103/PhysRevB.19.3004\n10.1021/acsnano.0c08101\n10.1063/1.97691\n10.1021/acsami.7b14415\n10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c01879\n10.1021/acsami.6b13775\n10.1063/1.3495776\n10.1038/s41565-018-0200-5"}

The outer layer of the MPP absorber is a common metal MPP, and the inner layer is a piezoelectric MPP made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film. When an alternating voltage is applied to the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-micro-perforated panel (MPP), it can be excited to generate different structural vibration modes, which can bring an additional absorption peak to the absorption performance curve of the piezoelectric acoustic absorber. The numerical simulation and experimental results indicate that the frequency and sound absorption coefficient of the additional sound absorption peak are closely related to the voltage parameters. Especially when the frequency of the alternating voltage is close to the eigen-frequency of PVDF-MPP, the additional sound absorption peak is more significant. Therefore, the absorption coefficient of the piezoelectric acoustic absorber at the corresponding frequency can be effectively enhanced by appropriately adjusting the parameters of the excitation voltage.

{"title": "Study of a piezoelectric energy harvester in the form of vortex oscillation for fixed disturbance fluid type.", "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to study a piezoelectric energy harvester in the form of vortex oscillation for fixed disturbance fluid type. The harvester consists of a fixed cylinder, an oscillating cylinder, flexible beams, and polyvinylidene fluorides (PVDFs). The flexible beam connects the fixed cylinder to the oscillating cylinder, and the PVDF is fixed to the flexible beam by means of adhesive, thus completing the assembly of the entire energy harvester. In this paper, the diameters of the fixed cylinder and oscillating cylinder and the length of the flexible beam are studied. In different parameter states, the harvester has different output performance; so the purpose of this study is to find a set of optimum parameters that will lead to the best harvester output. When the diameters of the fixed cylinder and oscillating cylinder are 50 and 20\u00a0mm, respectively, and the length of the flexible beam is 60\u00a0mm, the whole prototype has the best electrical output performance with 5.98 \u00b5W power at 18\u00a0m/s.

{"title": "Independent Flexural Wave Frequency Conversion by a Linear Active Metalayer.", "abstract": "Wave frequency is a critical parameter for applications ranging from structural health monitoring, noise control, and medical imaging to quantum of energy in matter. Frequency conversion is an inevitable wave phenomenon in nonlinear or time-modulated media. However, frequency conversion in linear media holds the promise of breaking limits imposed by the physics laws of wave diffraction such as Snell's law and Rayleigh criterion. In this Letter, we physically introduce a linear active metalayer in a structural beam that can convert the wave frequency of an flexural incidence into arbitrary frequencies of transmitted waves, which is underpinned by time modulation of sensing signals and insensitive to incident amplitude. The active element, involving piezoelectric components and time-modulated transfer function, breaks energy conservation such that the generated harmonics can be fully decoupled, making the frequency conversion linear and independent. By leveraging the time-modulated unit, phase-gradient and frequency-gradient metalayers are proposed for frequency-converted wave steering and dynamic beam steering, respectively. The linear active metalayer proposed herein suggests a promising solution to fully control time-domain signals of flexural waves, in stark contrast with existing elastic metasurfaces, regardless of being passive or active.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2022-07-02", "authors": ["QianWu", "XiaodongZhang", "PShivashankar", "YangyangChen", "GuoliangHuang"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.244301"}

{"title": "3D Printed Piezoelectric Wound Dressing with Dual Piezoelectric Response Models for Scar-Prevention Wound Healing.", "abstract": "During the long process of wound defect repair, the bioelectric stimulation around the wound gradually decreases, which can cause gradual down-regulation of the wound healing cascade response, disordered deposition of collagen fibers, and abnormal remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). All these combined will eventually result in delayed wound healing and scar tissue formation. To resolve these issues, a novel ZnO nanoparticles modified PVDF/sodium alginate (SA) piezoelectric hydrogel scaffold (ZPFSA) is prepared by 3D printing technology. The prepared ZPFSA scaffold has dual piezoelectric response models, mainly consisting of vertical swelling and horizontal friction, which can be used to simulate and amplify endogenous bioelectricity to promote wound healing and prevent scar formation. Compared with other composite scaffolds, ZPFSA 0.5 (contain 0.5% ZnO nanoparticles) exhibits good biocompatibility, excellent antimicrobial properties, and stable piezoelectric response, so that it can significantly accelerate the wound healing and effectively prevent the scar tissue formation within 2 weeks thanks to the cascade regulation in wound healing, including cell migration, vascularization, collagen remodeling, and the expression of related growth factors.

Prevention of PIs/PUs is the least costly approach and minimizes the patient suffering compared with treatment. Besides, sustained tissue load alleviation and microenvironment management are the most crucial properties for dressings in PI/PU prevention. Hydrogel dressings have attracted a lot of attention to prevent PIs/PUs because of their unique mechanical properties and ability to manage the microenvironment of skin. However, auxiliary prophylaxis and early treatment of PIs/PUs remain a challenge and an acute clinical demand. Here, we report on an electroactive hydrogel with large stretchability (\u223c380%) and skinlike ductility, and Young's modulus (0.48 \u00b1 0.03 MPa) matches that of human skin (0.5-1.95 MPa). The hydrogel displayed piezoelectric properties and mechanical-electric response stability and sensitivity. Our results indicated that the hydrogel was able to promote in vitro angiogenesis under piezoelectric stimulation and exhibited biocompatibility, which has the potential for forming fine vessels at the damaged sites of PIs/PUs. Furthermore, finite element analysis and pressure dispersion experiments demonstrated that the hydrogel was suitable for preventing PIs/PUs by redistributing force, reducing tissue distortion, and maintaining the microenvironment for skin.

{"title": "State of the Art and Future Opportunities in MRI-Guided Robot-Assisted Surgery and Interventions.", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide high-quality 3-D visualization of target anatomy, surrounding tissue, and instrumentation, but there are significant challenges in harnessing it for effectively guiding interventional procedures. Challenges include the strong static magnetic field, rapidly switching magnetic field gradients, high-power radio frequency pulses, sensitivity to electrical noise, and constrained space to operate within the bore of the scanner. MRI has a number of advantages over other medical imaging modalities, including no ionizing radiation, excellent soft-tissue contrast that allows for visualization of tumors and other features that are not readily visible by other modalities, true 3-D imaging capabilities, including the ability to image arbitrary scan plane geometry or perform volumetric imaging, and capability for multimodality sensing, including diffusion, dynamic contrast, blood flow, blood oxygenation, temperature, and tracking of biomarkers. The use of robotic assistants within the MRI bore, alongside the patient during imaging, enables intraoperative MR imaging (iMRI) to guide a surgical intervention in a closed-loop fashion that can include tracking of tissue deformation and target motion, localization of instrumentation, and monitoring of therapy delivery. With the ever-expanding clinical use of MRI, MRI-compatible robotic systems have been heralded as a new approach to assist interventional procedures to allow physicians to treat patients more accurately and effectively. Deploying robotic systems inside the bore synergizes the visual capability of MRI and the manipulation capability of robotic assistance, resulting in a closed-loop surgery architecture.

{"title": "Investigation of Plasmonic-Enhanced Solar Photothermal Effect of Au NR@PVDF Micro-/Nanofilms.", "abstract": "Gold nanospheres (Au NSs) and gold nanorods (Au NRs) are traditional noble metal plasmonic nanomaterials. Particularly, Au NRs with tunable longitudinal plasmon resonance from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) range were suitable for highly efficient photothermal applications due to the extended light-receiving range. In this work, we synthesized Au NRs and Au NSs of similar volumes and subsequently developed them into Au NR/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and Au NS/PVDF nanofilms, both of which exhibited excellent solar photothermal performance evaluated by solar photothermal experiments. We found that the Au NR/PVDF nanofilm showed a higher solar photothermal performance than the Au NS/PVDF nanofilm. Through detailed analysis, such as morphological characterization, optical measurement, and finite element method (FEM) modeling, we found that the plasmonic coupling effects inside the aggregated Au NR nanoclusters contributed to the spectral blue shifts and intensified the photothermal performance. As compared to Au NS/PVDF nanofilms, the Au NR/PVDF nanofilm exhibited a higher efficient light-to-heat conversion rate because of the extended light-receiving range and high absorbance, as a result of the strong plasmonic interactions inside nanoclusters, which was further validated by monochromatic laser photothermal experiments and FEM simulations.

The influence of the local concentration of microcracks on the spectral efficiency of backscattering of pulses of longitudinal ultrasonic waves in the studied specimens (the so-called \"structural noise power\") is studied. A specially designed laser-ultrasonic transducer used in experiments combines laser excitation of probe broadband ultrasonic pulses in a black polyethylene film and piezoelectric detection of both probe pulses and that scattered in the specimen. We study specimens of a potash feldspar and soda-calcium plagioclase with nonuniformly distributed local microcracks. The cracking domains were identified by optical microscopy as well as using the attenuation coefficient of longitudinal ultrasonic waves measured in these domains. The increase in the ultrasonic attenuation coefficient was associated with a higher concentration of microcracks, which efficiently scatter acoustic waves. At the same time, the domains with a higher ultrasonic attenuation exhibited an increased structural noise power.

{"title": "A Versatile Model for Describing Energy Harvesting Characteristics of Composite-Laminated Piezoelectric Cantilever Patches.", "abstract": "Vibration-based energy harvesters consisting of a laminated piezoelectric cantilever have recently attracted attention for their potential applications. Current studies have mostly focused on the harvesting capacity of piezoelectric harvesters under various conditions, and have given less attention to the electromechanical characteristics that are, in fact, crucial to a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanism of piezoelectric harvesting. In addition, the current related models have mostly been suitable for harvesting systems with very specific parameters and have not been applicable if the parameters were vague or unknown. Drawing on the available background information, in this study, we conduct research on a vibration-based cantilever beam of composite-laminated piezoelectric patches through an experimental study of its characteristics as well as a modeling study of energy harvesting. In the experimental study, we set out to investigate the harvesting capacity of the system, as well as the electromechanical (voltage/current-strain and power-strain relationships) characteristics of the cantilever harvester. In addition, we summarize some pivotal rules with regard to several design variables, which provide configuration design suggestions for maximizing energy conversion of this type of harvesting system. In the modeling study, we propose a coupled electromechanical model with a set of updated parameters by using an optimization program. The preceding experimental data are used to verify the superiority of the model for accurately predicting the amount of harvested energy, while effectively imitating the characteristics of a cantilever harvesters. The model also has merit since it is suitable for diversified harvesters with vague or even unknown parameters, which cannot be dealt with by using traditional modeling methods. Overall, the experimental study provides information on a comprehensive way to enhance the harvesting capacity of piezoelectric cantilever transducers, and the modeling study provides a wide scope of applications for cantilever harvesters even if precise information is lacking.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["XiaominXue", "QingSun", "QiangliMa", "JiajiaWang"], "doi": "10.3390/s22124457\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/4/045039\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab36e4\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.1088/0960-1317/26/10/103001\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/2/023001\n10.1016/j.energy.2014.12.065\n10.1002/adem.201700743\n10.1088/1742-6596/744/1/012077\n10.1016/j.physrep.2018.11.001\n10.1016/j.phpro.2011.06.136\n10.1063/1.5093956\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.08.031\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.06.028\n10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00248-7\n10.1080/10584580590964574\n10.1115/1.2890402\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2004.00120.x\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2006.03.003\n10.1177/1045389X9000100305\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/024\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009"}
{"title": "Fiber-Optic Hydrophone Based on Michelson's Interferometer with Active Stabilization for Liquid Volume Measurement.", "abstract": "Sensing technologies using optical fibers have been studied and applied since the 1970s in oil and gas, industrial, medical, aerospace, and civil areas. Detecting ultrasound acoustic waves through fiber-optic hydrophone (FOH) sensors can be one solution for continuous measurement of volumes inside production tanks used by these industries. This work presents an FOH system composed of two optical fiber coils made with commercial single mode fiber (SMF) working in the sensor head of a Michelson's interferometer (MI) supported by an active stabilization mechanism that drives another optical coil wound around a piezoelectric actuator (PZT) in the reference arm to mitigate external mechanical and thermal noise from the environment. A 1000 mL glass graduated cylinder filled with water is used as a test tank, inside which the sensor head and an ultrasound source are placed. For detection, amplitudes and phases are measured, and machine learning algorithms predict their respective liquid volumes. The acoustic waves create patterns electronically detected with resolution of 1 mL and sensitivity of 340 mrad/mL and 70 mvolts/mL. The nonlinear behavior of both measurands requires classification, distance metrics, and regression algorithms to define an adequate model. The results show the system can determine liquid volumes with an accuracy of 99.4% using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classification with one neighbor and Manhattan's distance.

{"title": "Flexible Platform of Acoustofluidics and Metamaterials with Decoupled Resonant Frequencies.", "abstract": "The key challenge for a lab-on-chip (LOC) device is the seamless integration of key elements of biosensing and actuation (e.g., biosampling or microfluidics), which are conventionally realised using different technologies. In this paper, we report a convenient and efficient LOC platform fabricated using an electrode patterned flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) pressed onto a piezoelectric film coated substrate, which can implement multiple functions of both acoustofluidics using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and sensing functions using electromagnetic metamaterials, based on the same electrode on the FPCB. We explored the actuation capability of the integrated structure by pumping a sessile droplet using SAWs in the radio frequency range. We then investigated the hybrid sensing capability (including both physical and chemical ones) of the structure employing the concept of electromagnetic split-ring resonators (SRRs) in the microwave frequency range. The originality of this sensing work is based on the premise that the proposed structure contains three completely decoupled resonant frequencies for sensing applications and each resonance has been used as a separate physical or a chemical sensor. This feature compliments the acoustofluidic capability and is well-aligned with the goals set for a successful LOC device.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["ShahrzadZahertar", "HamdiTorun", "ChaoSun", "ChristopherMarkwell", "YinhuaDong", "XinYang", "YongqingFu"], "doi": "10.3390/s22124344\n10.1039/D0MH00483A\n10.1002/admt.202001020\n10.1016/j.mattod.2020.08.017\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112782\n10.3390/mi11020126\n10.1039/C9LC01189G\n10.1021/acsapm.0c01071\n10.1038/s41746-017-0014-0\n10.1007/s12195-020-00642-z\n10.1038/lsa.2017.53\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112291\n10.1016/j.cobme.2018.02.004\n10.1002/wsbm.1381\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.09.001\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2014.04.010\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.03.078\n10.1063/1.5079815\n10.1063/1.2951467\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2017.04.006\n10.1063/1.3701725\n10.1039/C8LC00112J\n10.1039/C7LC00715A\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.09.173\n10.1007/s00216-004-2693-z\n10.1016/j.jala.2006.08.001\n10.1039/C8LC01117F\n10.1063/1.5010219\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.11.009\n10.1002/adfm.201606039\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.12.013\n10.1007/s00542-016-2880-9\n10.1039/B412712A\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab8f50\n10.1039/C7SM02534C\n10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2019.02.002\n10.1063/1.4982073\n10.1039/C5IB00206K\n10.1039/C8LC01347K\n10.1007/s13361-017-1716-x\n10.1002/adom.201900653\n10.1063/1.4896261\n10.1063/1.4935910\n10.1038/s41598-019-43470-6\n10.1038/nnano.2015.302\n10.1063/1.3056052\n10.1109/JSTQE.2017.2659226\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.595\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2953251\n10.3390/s16111802\n10.3390/s18093049\n10.1108/SR-06-2018-0152\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.10.061\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2363095\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab3f7d\n10.1021/acssensors.0c00948\n10.1039/D1SD00050K\n10.3390/s19051230\n10.1109/TED.2020.3039760\n10.1063/5.0043550"}

{"title": "A Bibliometric Analysis of Low-Cost Piezoelectric Micro-Energy Harvesting Systems from Ambient Energy Sources: Current Trends, Issues and Suggestions.", "abstract": "The scientific interest in piezoelectric micro-energy harvesting (PMEH) has been fast-growing, demonstrating that the field has made a major improvement in the long-term evolution of alternative energy sources. Although various research works have been performed and published over the years, only a few attempts have been made to examine the research's influence in this field. Therefore, this paper presents a bibliometric study into low-cost PMEH from ambient energy sources within the years 2010-2021, outlining current research trends, analytical assessment, novel insights, impacts, challenges and recommendations. The major goal of this paper is to provide a bibliometric evaluation that is based on the top-cited 100 articles employing the Scopus databases, information and refined keyword searches. This study analyses various key aspects, including PMEH emerging applications, authors' contributions, collaboration, research classification, keywords analysis, country's networks and state-of-the-art research areas.

The numerical modeling technique adopted to generate an array of PMUTs consisting of a considerable number of transducers allows for a large reduction in computational cost without reducing accuracy. The modeling idea is based on coupling shell elements applied to the PMUT structural layers with 3D-solid elements applied to the piezoelectric layer. A set of eigenfrequency and frequency domain analyses are presented considering a single ROM of a PMUT performing in different ambients and the performing central frequencies are obtained for every considered scenario. A unique arrangement of 228 PMUTs is presented and tested for its ability to transmit and receive acoustic waves. The operating frequency band of the array and the level of interference and cross-talk among different PMUTs in the near field are estimated. Finally, the results from a preliminary experimental test performed to analyze the acoustic abilities of an 8 \u00d7 8 array of PMUTs are presented.

However, they have a short life cycle and limited applications. In addition, high-intensity operation will result in a decrease in their stability. Electromagnetic-driven multi-degree-of-freedom motors, on the other hand, are simple and highly integrated, but they are large in volume and lack positioning accuracy. Therefore, combining the two drive modes can achieve complementary advantages, such as improving the motor's torque, accuracy, and output performance. Firstly, the structure of the hybrid drive motor is introduced and its working principle is analyzed. The motor can achieve single and hybrid drive control, which is beneficial to improving the performance of the motor. Secondly, the influence of magnetization mode, permanent magnet thickness, slot torque, and stator mode on the motor is analyzed. Thirdly, the structure of the motor is determined to be 6 poles and 15 slots, the thickness of the permanent magnet is 12 mm, and the radial magnetization mode is used.

{"title": "Dual-Wavelength Photoacoustic Computed Tomography with Piezoelectric Ring-Array Transducer for Imaging of Indocyanine Green Liposomes Aggregation in Tumors.", "abstract": "Recently, indocyanine green (ICG), as an FDA-approved dye, has been widely used for phototherapy. It is essential to obtain information on the migration and aggregation of ICG in deep tissues. However, existing fluorescence imaging platforms are not able to obtain the structural information of the tissues. Here, we prepared ICG liposomes (ICG-Lips) and built a dual-wavelength photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) system with piezoelectric ring-array transducer to image the aggregation of ICG-Lips in tumors to guide phototherapy.

{"title": "Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a Rotational Magnetic Couple Piezoelectric Energy Harvester.", "abstract": "With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and the popularity of wireless sensors, using internal permanent or rechargeable batteries as a power source will face a higher maintenance workload. Therefore, self-powered wireless sensors through environmental energy harvesting are becoming an important development trend. Among the many studies of energy harvesting, the research on rotational energy harvesting still has many shortcomings, such as rarely working effectively under low-frequency rotational motion or working in a narrow frequency band. In this article, a rotational magnetic couple piezoelectric energy harvester is proposed. Under the low-frequency excitation (<10 Hz) condition, the harvester can convert low-frequency rotational into high-frequency vibrational of the piezoelectric beam by frequency up-conversion, effectively increasing the working bandwidth (0.5\u221216 Hz) and improving the efficiency of low-speed rotational energy harvesting. In addition, when the excitation frequency is too high (>16 Hz), it can solve the condition that the piezoelectric beam cannot respond in time by frequency down-conversion. Therefore, the energy harvester still has a certain degree of energy harvesting ability (18\u221222 Hz and 29\u221231 Hz) under high-frequency conditions. Meanwhile, corresponding theoretical analyses and experimental verifications were carried out to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the harvester with different excitation and installation directions. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed energy harvester has a wider working bandwidth benefiting from the frequency up-conversion mechanism and frequency down-conversion mechanism. In addition, the forward beam will have a wider bandwidth than the inverse beam due to the softening effect. In addition, the maximum powers of the forward and inverse beams at 310 rpm (15.5 Hz) are 93.8 \u03bcW and 58.5 \u03bcW, respectively. The maximum powers of the two beams at 420 rpm (21 Hz) reached 177 \u03bcW and 85.2 \u03bcW, respectively. The self-powered requirement of micromechanical systems can be achieved. Furthermore, this study provides the theoretical and experimental basis for rotational energy harvesting.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["FengSun", "RunhongDong", "RanZhou", "FangchaoXu", "XutaoMei"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13060936\n10.3390/mi12040436\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab36e4\n10.3390/mi12040363\n10.3390/mi12040425\n10.1088/1757-899X/1085/1/012031\n10.1140/epjst/e2019-800211-8\n10.1038/s41378-018-0024-3\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab1598\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2956773\n10.1088/1757-899X/730/1/012039\n10.1088/1361-665X/aaee4e\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2875788\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.02.003\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114615\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab7f44\n10.3390/app7121324\n10.3390/s19051149\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.12.020\n10.1177/1045389X19862642\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.04.043\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.07.084\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.11.030\n10.1016/j.egyr.2021.09.085\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.006\n10.1063/1.5018077\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.11.041\n10.1088/1361-665X/aaca56"}

{"title": "Vibration Energy Harvesting from the Subwavelength Interface State of a Topological Metamaterial Beam.", "abstract": "Topological metamaterial has been a research hotpot in both physics and engineering due to its unique ability of wave manipulation. The topological interface state, which can efficiently and robustly centralize the elastic wave energy, is promising to attain high-performance energy harvesting. Since most of environmental vibration energy is in low frequency range, the interface state is required to be designed at subwavelength range. To this end, this paper developed a topological metamaterial beam with local resonators and studied its energy-harvesting performance. First, the unit cell of this topological metamaterial beam consists of a host beam with two pairs of parasitic beams with tip mass. Then, the band structure and topological features are determined. It is revealed that by tuning the distance between these two pairs of parasitic beams, band inversion where topological features inverse can be obtained. Then, two sub-chains, their design based on two topologically distinct unit cells, are assembled together with a piezoelectric transducer placed at the conjunction, yielding the locally resonant, topological, metamaterial, beam-based piezoelectric energy harvester. After that, its transmittance property and output power were obtained by using the frequency domain analysis of COMSOL Multiphysics. It is clear that the subwavelength interface state is obtained at the band-folding bandgap. Meanwhile, in the interface state, elastic wave energy is successfully centralized at the conjunction. From the response distribution, it is found that the maximum response takes place on the parasitic beam rather than the host beam. Therefore, the piezoelectric transducer is recommended to be placed on the parasitic beam rather than host beam. Finally, the robustness of the topological interface state and its potential advantages on energy harvesting were studied by introducing a local defect. It is clear that in the interface state, the maximum response is always located at the conjunction regardless of the defect degree and location. In other words, the piezoelectric transducer placed at the conjunction can maintain a stable and high-efficiency output power in the interface state, which makes the whole system very reliable in practical implementation.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["YonglingLu", "ZhenWang", "XueqiongZhu", "ChengboHu", "JinggangYang", "YipengWu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13060862\n10.3390/mi13020210\n10.3390/mi13030388\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.01.025\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118511\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2022.108963\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/5/030\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108038\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.107672\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2022.109169\n10.1063/1.3253710\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.08.001\n10.1177/1045389X20930080\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac3c04\n10.1063/1.3159815\n10.1115/1.4026278\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112164\n10.1016/j.cnsns.2018.02.017\n10.1007/s11071-019-05005-6\n10.1007/s11071-019-04853-6\n10.1063/1.5114891\n10.1115/1.4029606\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.082\n10.1177/1045389X17730927\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.197701\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/6/065004\n10.1063/1.4960792\n10.1016/j.jmps.2008.11.002\n10.1063/1.5011999\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac0cbc\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105897\n10.1007/s11433-021-1787-x\n10.1063/5.0001548\n10.1063/5.0047965\n10.1016/j.eml.2021.101578\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108047\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.42.1698\n10.1038/s41598-018-24952-5\n10.1103/PhysRevB.98.014110\n10.1038/nphys3228"}

{"title": "Interaction between Electromechanical Fields and Carriers in a Multilayered Piezoelectric Semiconductor Beam.", "abstract": "This study discusses the interaction between electromechanical fields and carriers in a multilayered ZnO beam where the c-axis of every two adjacent layers is alternately opposite along the thickness direction. A multi-field coupling model is proposed from the Timoshenko beam theory together with the phenomenological theory of piezoelectric semiconductors, including Gauss's law and the continuity equation of currents. The analytical solutions are obtained for a bent beam with different numbers of layers. Numerical results show that polarized charges occur at the interfaces between every two adjacent layers due to the opposite electromechanical coupling effects.

{"title": "A Linear-Arc Composite Beam Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Modeling and Finite Element Analysis.", "abstract": "To improve the output performance of the piezoelectric energy harvester, this paper proposed the design of a linear-arc composite beam piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH-C). First the nonlinear restoring force model of a composite beam was obtained by the numerical simulation method. Afterwards, the corresponding coupled governing equations were derived by using the generalized Hamilton principle, laying the foundation for subsequent in-depth research. After this, a finite element simulation was performed in the COMSOL software to simulate the output voltage, stress distribution, and resonance frequency of the PEH-C under different curvatures. In this way, the effect of curvature change on the PEH-C was analyzed. Finally, the PEH-C with a curvature of 40 m\u22121 was prepared, and an experimental platform was built to verify the correctness of the relevant analysis. The results showed that the resonant frequency of the PEH-C can be changed by changing the curvature, and that the stress on the composite beam will increase after the arc segment is introduced. When the curvature of the PEH-C was 40 m\u22121, the open-circuit output voltage was 44.3% higher than that of the straight beam.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["XuhuiZhang", "YanGuo", "FulinZhu", "XiaoyuChen", "HaoTian", "HengtaoXu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13060848\n10.1109/TSMC.2018.2833204\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2983091\n10.1007/s11276-017-1558-2\n10.1016/j.jsv.2021.116394\n10.1115/1.4026278\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa5fda\n10.3390/s20051370\n10.1177/1045389X05056859\n10.1063/1.3253710\n10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115689\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.12.025\n10.1063/1.4919711\n10.1088/1361-665X/26/3/035008\n10.1063/1.4795296\n10.1016/j.jsv.2016.03.017\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.077\n10.1063/1.4913606\n10.1115/1.4042139\n10.1016/j.jsv.2016.09.022\n10.1007/s10409-019-00852-3\n10.1007/s11071-019-05133-z\n10.1080/15376494.2018.1472341\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.07.014\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112232\n10.3390/mi12080973\n10.1177/1045389X17730926\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.011\n10.3390/s18124472\n10.3390/s21217213"}
{"title": "Design Rules for a Wearable Micro-Fabricated Piezo-Resistive Pressure Sensor.", "abstract": "Wearable flexible piezo-resistive pressure sensors hold a wide-ranging potential in human health monitoring, electronic skin, robotic limbs, and other human-machine interfaces. Out of the most successful recent efforts for arterial pulse monitoring are sensors with micro-patterned conductive elastomers. However, a low-current output signal (typically in the range of nano-amperes) and bulky and expensive measurement equipment for useful signal acquisition inhibits their wearability. Herein, through a finite element analysis we establish the design rules for a highly sensitive piezo-resistive pressure sensor with an output that is high enough to be detectable by simple and inexpensive circuits and therefore ensure wearability. We also show that, out of four frequently reported micro-feature shapes in micro-patterned piezo-resistive sensors, the micro-dome and micro-pyramid yield the highest sensitivity. Furthermore, investigations of different conductivity values of micro-patterned elastomers found that coating the elastomer with a conductive material (usually metallic) leads to higher current response when compared to composited conductive elastomers. Finally, the geometric parameters and spatial configurations of micro-pyramid design of piezo-resistive sensors were optimized. The results show that an enhanced sensitivity and higher current output is achieved by the lower spatial density configuration of three micro-features per millimeter length, a smaller feature size of around 100 \u03bcm, and a 60-50 degrees pyramid angle.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["BorzooyeJafarizadeh", "Azmal HudaChowdhury", "ImanKhakpour", "NezihPala", "ChunleiWang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13060838\n10.1038/nmat3380\n10.3390/s19051250\n10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.006\n10.1021/acsami.8b20929\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c01827\n10.1002/adma.201302869\n10.1002/smll.201402890\n10.1002/adfm.201504560\n10.1039/C4MH00147H\n10.3390/s20020371\n10.1021/acsami.0c00255\n10.1126/sciadv.1500661\n10.1088/1361-6528/aba4cd\n10.1109/SENSORS47125.2020.9278604\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab3695\n10.1021/acsami.9b00941\n10.1002/smll.201700368\n10.1021/acsami.8b11121\n10.1002/adma.201702308\n10.3390/s150923402\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.02.057\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104671\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.020\n10.1038/ncomms4002\n10.1021/acsami.7b14048\n10.1002/adma.201305182\n10.1021/nn500441k\n10.1002/adfm.201500453\n10.1002/adfm.201808783\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104560\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2018.02.005\n10.1021/acsami.0c22938\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112372\n10.1021/acsami.0c10516\n10.1002/adfm.201909603\n10.1007/s10825-019-01429-w\n10.1016/j.aeue.2021.153707\n10.3390/mi12091095\n10.3390/s18072023\n10.1016/j.ihj.2014.08.010\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107600\n10.1063/1.1712836\n10.1111/jace.18421"}

The tests are performed in a controlled environmental chamber at two different elevated temperatures. The interlaminar shear properties of the specimens remain largely unaffected by the testing temperature. However, the SEM micrographs show different damage progressions between the specimens tested at 100 \u00b0C and 120 \u00b0C. Fibre ruptures and longer delamination between the plies, as a result of a high temperature, are observed in the specimens tested at 120 \u00b0C, which are not observed in the specimens tested at 100 \u00b0C. In addition, the acoustic emission activities during the tests are investigated by using piezoelectric sensors. The information-theoretic parameter, the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity, is calculated for the recorded acoustic signals. The LZ Complexities are used for identifying the occurrence of the first delamination failure in the specimens. Additionally, the two features of the acoustic signals, LZ complexity and Weighted Peak Frequency (W.P-Freq), are used for distinguishing the different damage sources in the CFRP specimens.

All analyzed tumors displayed PIEZO2 in nearly all cells, showing two patterns of immunostaining: membranous and perinuclear dot-like.

{"title": "A Comparative Feasibility Study for Transcranial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy.", "abstract": "The potential beneficial regenerative and stimulatory extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) applications to the central nervous system have garnered interest in recent years. Treatment zones for these indications are acoustically shielded by bones, which heavily impact generated sound fields. We present the results of high-resolution tissue-realistic simulations, comparing the viability of different ESWT applicators in their use for transcranial applications. The performances of electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric transducers for key reflector geometries are compared. Based on density information obtained from CT imaging of the head, we utilized the non-linear wave propagation toolset Matlab k-Wave to obtain spatial therapeutic sound field geometries and waveforms. In order to understand the reliability of results on the appropriate modeling of the skull, three different bone attenuation models were compared. We find that all currently clinically ESWT applicator technologies show significant retention of peak pressures and energies past the bone barrier. Electromagnetic transducers maintain a significantly higher energy flux density compared to other technologies while low focusing strength piezoelectric applicators have the weakest transmissions. Attenuation estimates provide insights into sound field degradation and energy losses, indicating that effective transcranial therapies can readily be attained with current applicators. Furthermore, the presented approach will allow for future targeted in silico development and the design of applicators and therapy plans to ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["CyrillSlezak", "JonasFlatscher", "PaulSlezak"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines10061457\n10.1302/2058-5241.5.190067\n10.1007/s00402-018-3071-1\n10.5455/msm.2018.30.141-146\n10.1007/s10039-017-0310-6\n10.1016/j.injury.2016.04.010\n10.1038/s41443-019-0115-1\n10.1177/0363546519871059\n10.1016/j.jss.2013.07.004\n10.1097/MD.0000000000011418\n10.7759/cureus.11200\n10.1002/advs.201902583\n10.1038/s41598-018-35486-1\n10.1088/1361-6560/aabe37\n10.1121/1.5136742\n10.1121/1.5126685\n10.1121/1.4976339\n10.1088/1741-2552/aa843e\n10.1007/978-1-4471-4387-1_38\n10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2600862\n10.1016/j.phpro.2016.12.020\n10.1134/S1063771015030148\n10.1242/bio.033258\n10.1088/0031-9155/41/1/009\n10.1002/0470093978.ch4\n10.3390/s19020345\n10.1118/1.3668316\n10.1121/1.2766779\n10.1016/j.phpro.2010.01.003\n10.1121/1.382016\n10.1121/1.1336896\n10.1016/0041-624X(86)90102-2\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0070\n10.1103/PhysRevResearch.1.033205\n10.3389/fnins.2020.00317\n10.1088/0031-9155/56/1/014\n10.1007/s13311-018-00691-3\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0296\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa7ccc\n10.1002/jbmr.2613\n10.1186/s40349-016-0056-9"}

{"title": "Carbon Nanotube Enhanced Filtration and Dewatering of Kerosene.", "abstract": "Current approaches to dewatering aviation fuel such as kerosene are adsorption by activated charcoal, gravity separation, etc. The objective of this work is to develop and demonstrate the filtration and dewatering of kerosene using a carbon nanotube immobilised membrane (CNIM). Highly hydrophobic membranes were prepared by immobilising carbon nanotube (CNTs) over polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) microfiltration membrane for the dewatering of ppm level water from kerosene. The effects of different CNT concentrations on membrane morphology, hydrophobicity, porosity, and permeability were characterised. After immobilising CNT into membranes, the contact angle increased by 9%, 16%, and 43% compared to unmodified 0.1 \u03bcm PTFE, 0.22 \u03bcm PTFE and 0.22 \u03bcm PVDF membranes, respectively. The CNIM showed remarkable separation efficiency for the fuel-water system. The micro/nano water droplets coalesced on the CNT surface to form larger diameters of water droplets detached from the membrane surface, leading to enhanced water rejection. In general, the water rejection increased with the amount of CNT immobilised while the effective surface porosity over pore length and flux decreased. PTFE base membrane showed better performance compared to the PVDF substrate. The CNIMs were fabricated with 0.1 and 0.22 \u03bcm PTFE at an optimised CNT loading of 3 and 6 wt.%, and the water rejection was 99.97% and 97.27%, respectively, while the kerosene fluxes were 43.22 kg/m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-06-24", "authors": ["SumonaPaul", "Mitun ChandraBhoumick", "SagarRoy", "SomenathMitra"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12060621\n10.1016/j.cis.2003.10.023\n10.1021/cr500006j\n10.4172/2155-9589.1000188\n10.1186/s11671-018-2693-0\n10.1016/j.isci.2021.103114\n10.3390/ma9040262\n10.1038/am.2014.23\n10.1515/ntrev-2021-0039\n10.1016/j.jiec.2014.03.022\n10.1016/j.seppur.2013.03.033\n10.1016/j.carbon.2010.10.016\n10.1016/j.seppur.2022.121047\n10.3390/nano10030578\n10.3390/w11122588\n10.3390/molecules27092896\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.118133\n10.1016/j.seppur.2021.118681\n10.1016/j.chroma.2018.07.068\n10.1016/j.jtice.2016.12.024\n10.1039/D0SE00461H\n10.1021/acs.iecr.9b02376\n10.1016/j.seppur.2017.11.053\n10.1016/S0376-7388(03)00137-6\n10.1016/0376-7388(88)80014-0\n10.1016/j.matdes.2019.108200\n10.2175/106143096X128621\n10.1016/j.seppur.2012.02.042\n10.1016/j.mtcomm.2021.102743\n10.1021/acsanm.0c00664\n10.1080/10934520701513381\n10.1021/ac100428m\n10.1039/C8RA01233D\n10.1039/C8RA00055G\n10.3390/ma14092431\n10.1021/acsomega.9b01181\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b01637"}

The transport was forced by an electrical potential difference between two electrodes inside the lumen of a hollow fiber and glass tube.

In this study, a reagent-free immobilization method based on electron beam irradiation was investigated, which allows much faster, cleaner, and cheaper fabrication of enzyme membrane reactors. Two industrial lipase enzymes were coupled onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) flat sheet membrane to create self-cleaning surfaces. The response surface methodology (RSM) in the design-of-experiments approach was applied to investigate the effects of three numerical factors on enzyme activity, yielding a maximum activity of 823 \u00b1 118 U m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-06-24", "authors": ["MartinSchmidt", "AndreaPrager", "NadjaSch\u00f6nherr", "RogerGl\u00e4ser", "AgnesSchulze"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12060599\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2019.09.010\n10.1007/s13205-012-0071-7\n10.1007/s12154-013-0102-9\n10.1039/C3CS60075K\n10.1016/0141-0229(94)90030-2\n10.1016/S0167-7799(00)01472-4\n10.1039/c1gc15178a\n10.1016/j.cep.2021.108729\n10.1039/C7AN00778G\n10.1016/j.jece.2016.03.007\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.06.011\n10.1016/j.bej.2016.06.029\n10.1016/j.bej.2012.03.013\n10.1002/1097-0290(20010105)72:1<77::AID-BIT11>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131757\n10.1016/j.seppur.2021.120098\n10.3390/polym9030097\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.06.013\n10.1007/s00253-015-6390-y\n10.1002/marc.200900666\n10.2166/wst.2012.890\n10.1016/j.cattod.2020.05.017\n10.1039/c3ra43659d\n10.3390/jfb9010021\n10.3389/fchem.2021.804698\n10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2013.02.013\n10.3390/molecules190811860\n10.1006/abio.1996.0238\n10.1016/j.ab.2016.11.001\n10.3109/14756366.2012.688039\n10.1006/jtbi.1997.0425\n10.1111/j.2517-6161.1951.tb00067.x\n10.1080/00224065.1980.11980968\n10.3390/polym7091485\n10.1016/0003-2697(85)90442-7\n10.1016/0378-4347(91)80262-B\n10.2174/092986609789071333\n10.3390/polym13111849\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.127\n10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(66)88125-0\n10.1016/S0141-3910(03)00064-8\n10.1016/S0079-6700(00)00008-3\n10.1063/1.555805\n10.1038/s42004-021-00572-5\n10.1016/j.biortech.2021.126201\n10.1080/10942912.2021.1937209\n10.1002/cbic.201900202\n10.3390/catal11101222\n10.1042/BA20020059\n10.1007/s12033-007-0038-9\n10.1021/jp004051u\n10.1088/1757-899X/547/1/012054\n10.1007/s10311-018-0717-8\n10.1021/ac101857j\n10.3390/polym13060846\n10.1007/s41204-020-00077-x\n10.1007/s00449-009-0400-3\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130779\n10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112061\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130870\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119707\n10.1016/j.talanta.2019.03.116\n10.1002/ejlt.201900347\n10.2174/1389557516666160630123356"}

The membrane chemistry and spinning processes were adapted from a previously reported method and optimized to suit large-scale production processes with the objective of translating the technology from lab scale to pilot scale and eventual commercialization. The membrane process was successfully optimized in small 1.5 kg batches and scaled-up to 20 kg and 50 kg batch sizes with good reproducibility of membrane properties. The membranes were then assembled into 0.5-inch and 2-inch modules of different lengths and evaluated in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) mode, as well as vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) mode.

There is continuous control of the position of the surgical instrument. The use of the navigated piezoelectric device allowed the surgeon's uncertainty to be reduced during the performance of the osteotomies in depth, in poorly visible areas, with little access or reduced visibility. It also increases the safety of bone resections near important anatomical structures.\nCANPS combines the advantages of piezoelectric surgery and navigation.

However, the spherical skeleton structure obtained through the conventional method fails to build continuous Li ion transmission channels due to the slow volatilization of high boiling solvent, leading to inferior cycling performance, especially in a Ni-rich system. Herein, a novel strategy is presented to enrich the Li ion transfer paths and improve the Li ion migration kinetics. The tactic is to prepare cross-linked segments through the PVDF-HFP matrix by adopting free radical polymerization and Li salt induced ring-opening polymerization. Most significantly, the visualization of the structure of as-prepared electrolyte is innovatively realized with the combination of polarization microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectroscopy, PVDF-HFP, and cross-linked network form interconnected microstructures.

This strategy is the key for non-transfer assembly of flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators (FPENGs) with both mechanical robustness and high electrical performance via direct lamination.

{"title": "A narrative review on the biology of piezo1 with platelet-rich plasma in cardiac cell regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte regeneration following cardiac damage is challenging to study because of the inflammatory process, the multiplication of cells in the stroma, and the creation of scar tissue. In addition to the initial damage, the subsequent decrease in cardiac myocytes adds to heart failure. Piezo1 is remarkably understudied in the heart, which may be related to its recent discovery. Despite this, Piezo1 is expressed in a variety of cardiovascular cell populations, notably epithelial cells (EC), cardiac fibroblasts (CF), and cardiac myocytes (CM), in both animal and human samples, with fibroblasts expressing more than myocytes. Researchers have recently shown that disrupting Piezo1 signaling causes defects in zebrafish developing the outflow tract (OFT) and aortic valves. Platelet plasma membranes may provide lipid substrates, such as phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, that aid in activating the piezo 1 ion channel in the cardiovascular system. In addition, CXC chemokine ligand 8/CXC chemokine receptor 1/2 (CXCL8-CXCR1/2) signaling was identified to establish the proliferation of coronary endothelial cells during cardiac regeneration. Notably, all these pathways are calcium-dependent, and cell proliferation and angiogenesis were necessary to recover myocardial cells.

However, the actuation of sound waves in Si PICs usually requires integration of a piezoelectric thin film. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is a promising material due to its strong piezoelectric and electromechanical coupling coefficient. Unfortunately, the traditional methods to grow PZT on silicon are detrimental for photonic applications due to the presence of an optical lossy intermediate layer. In this work, we report integration of a high quality PZT thin film on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic chip using an optically transparent buffer layer. We demonstrate acousto-optic modulation in silicon waveguides with the PZT actuated acoustic waves.

The high accuracy and robustness in the control design are coupled to each other, making it difficult to achieve both optimally at the same time. In addition, the system itself has a weakly damped resonant mode, which makes it extremely difficult to control the piezoelectric nanopositioning platform while suppressing the inherent resonance of the system as well as meeting the requirements for robustness and high accuracy.

Enabled by their in-memory event-driven computing abilities, hybrid memristive-Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor neuromorphic architectures provide an ideal hardware substrate for such tasks. To demonstrate the full potential of such systems, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an end-to-end sensory processing solution for a real-world object localization application. Drawing inspiration from the barn owl's neuroanatomy, we developed a bio-inspired, event-driven object localization system that couples state-of-the-art piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer sensors to a neuromorphic resistive memories-based computational map.

Ultrasonic testing can ensure the quality of these components and detect typical defects generated during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). However, it is difficult to find a single ultrasonic inspection technique that can detect defects in the large variety of geometries generated using LPBF. In this work, phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) is suggested to inspect thick LPBF components, while guided waves are explored for thin curved ones. PAUT is used to detect cylindrical lack of fusion defects in thick LPBF rectangular parts. Practical defects are generated by reducing the laser power at prespecified locations in the samples. The defects' shape and density are verified using optical microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. Partially fused defects down to 0.25\u00a0mm in diameter are experimentally detected using a 10 MHz PAUT probe with the total focusing method post-processing. The experimental results are compared to defect images predicted by finite element simulations. For thin components with curved geometry, guided waves are used to detect powder-filled cylindrical defects. The waves are generated using piezoelectric transducers, and the spatiotemporal wavefield is measured using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. Using root-mean-square imaging of the wavefield, defects down to 1\u00a0mm are clearly detected despite the complex internal features in the samples.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-06-19", "authors": ["AAllam", "OAlfahmi", "HPatel", "CSugino", "MHarding", "MRuzzene", "AErturk"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106780"}

{"title": "L-shape triple defects in a phononic crystal for broadband piezoelectric energy harvesting.", "abstract": "This study proposes a phononic crystal (PnC) with triple defects in an L-shape arrangement for broadband piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH). The incorporation of defects in PnCs has attracted significant attention in PEH fields owing to properties such as energy localization and amplification near the defect. Several studies have been conducted to enhance output electric power of PnC-based PEH systems with single defects. However, it is susceptible to the limitations of narrow bandwidth. Recently, double-defect-incorporated systems have been proposed to widen the PEH bandwidth via defect-band splitting. Nevertheless, the PEH performance rapidly decreases in the frequency range between the split defect bands. The limitations of single- and double-defect-incorporated systems can be resolved by the incorporation of the proposed design concept, called the L-shape triple defects in a PnC. The isolated single defect at the top vertex of the letter 'L' compensates for the limitations of double-defect-incorporated systems, whereas the double defects at the bottom vertices compensate for the limitations of the single-defect-incorporated systems. Hence, the proposed design can effectively confine and harvest elastic-wave energy over broadband frequencies while enhancing the application of single and double defects. The effectiveness of the proposed design concept is numerically validated using the finite element method. In the case of a circular hole-type PnC, it is verified that the PnC with L-shape triple defects broadens the bandwidth, and improves the output voltage and electric power compared with those of single- and double-defect-incorporated systems. This study expands the design space of defect-incorporated PnCs and might shed light on other engineering applications of the\u00a0frequency detector and elastic wave power transfer.", "journal": "Nano convergence", "date": "2022-06-16", "authors": ["Soo-HoJo", "HeonjunYoon", "Yong ChangShin", "WonjaeChoi", "Byeng DYoun", "MisoKim"], "doi": "10.1186/s40580-022-00321-x\n10.1016/j.physb.2013.12.040\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113717\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac0cbc\n10.1186/s40580-021-00289-0\n10.1039/D1TC06089A\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.106938\n10.1002/sstr.202100128\n10.1063/5.0063488\n10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114174\n10.3390/cryst10040305\n10.1007/s11831-021-09612-8\n10.1063/5.0042337\n10.1186/s40580-014-0034-2\n10.1063/1.5111566\n10.1016/j.eml.2021.101578\n10.1016/j.rinp.2021.105006\n10.1016/j.surfrep.2010.08.002\n10.1002/adts.201900017\n10.1016/j.ssc.2022.114697\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2019.105088\n10.1007/s11433-012-4890-7\n10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066609\n10.1016/j.physleta.2013.07.039\n10.1016/j.physleta.2016.09.055\n10.3390/cryst8010021\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.106160\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2021.106593\n10.1063/5.0072053\n10.3390/cryst9080391\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.026\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105670\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105226\n10.1063/1.4788810\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/6/065004\n10.1063/1.5063949\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107253\n10.1016/j.eml.2020.101073\n10.1063/5.0003688\n10.1088/1361-6463/abe1e7\n10.3390/cryst11060643\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105833\n10.1103/PhysRevB.58.1318\n10.1063/1.5119328\n10.1186/s40580-020-00251-6\n10.1186/s40580-020-00240-9\n10.1088/0022-3727/42/1/015403\n10.1063/1.4766907\n10.1186/s40580-021-00277-4\n10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2051820\n10.1016/j.measurement.2022.110912\n10.1177/1045389X08098096\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/4/045023\n10.1016/j.ultras.2011.11.006\n10.1016/j.physb.2013.02.011\n10.1038/s41598-021-99269-x"}

Here, we describe a self-sufficient subcutaneous push button-controlled cellular implant powered simply by repeated gentle finger pressure exerted on the overlying skin. Pushing the button causes transient percutaneous deformation of the implant's embedded piezoelectric membrane, which produces sufficient low-voltage energy inside a semi-permeable platinum-coated cell chamber to mediate rapid release of a biopharmaceutical from engineered electro-sensitive human cells. Release is fine-tuned by varying the frequency and duration of finger-pressing stimulation.

{"title": "Piezo1-Regulated Mechanotransduction Controls Flow-Activated Lymphatic Expansion.", "abstract": "Mutations in PIEZO1 (Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1) cause human lymphatic malformations. We have previously uncovered an ORAI1 (ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1)-mediated mechanotransduction pathway that triggers lymphatic sprouting through Notch downregulation in response to fluid flow. However, the identity of its upstream mechanosensor remains unknown. This study aimed to identify and characterize the molecular sensor that translates the flow-mediated external signal to the Orai1-regulated lymphatic expansion.\nVarious mutant mouse models, cellular, biochemical, and molecular biology tools, and a mouse tail lymphedema model were employed to elucidate the role of Piezo1 in flow-induced lymphatic growth and regeneration.\nPiezo1 was found to be abundantly expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells. Piezo1 knockdown in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells inhibited the laminar flow-induced calcium influx and abrogated the flow-mediated regulation of the Orai1 downstream genes, such as KLF2 (Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 2), DTX1 (Deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 1), DTX3L (Deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3L,) and NOTCH1 (Notch receptor 1), which are involved in lymphatic sprouting. Conversely, stimulation of Piezo1 activated the Orai1-regulated mechanotransduction in the absence of fluid flow. Piezo1-mediated mechanotransduction was significantly blocked by Orai1 inhibition, establishing the epistatic relationship between Piezo1 and Orai1. Lymphatic-specific conditional Piezo1 knockout largely phenocopied sprouting defects shown in Orai1- or Klf2- knockout lymphatics during embryo development. Postnatal deletion of Piezo1 induced lymphatic regression in adults. Ectopic Dtx3L expression rescued the lymphatic defects caused by Piezo1 knockout, affirming that the Piezo1 promotes lymphatic sprouting through Notch downregulation. Consistently, transgenic Piezo1 expression or pharmacological Piezo1 activation enhanced lymphatic sprouting. Finally, we assessed a potential therapeutic value of Piezo1 activation in lymphatic regeneration and found that a Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1, effectively suppressed postsurgical lymphedema development.\nPiezo1 is an upstream mechanosensor for the lymphatic mechanotransduction pathway and regulates lymphatic growth in response to external physical stimuli.

{"title": "Piezo channels in the urinary system.", "abstract": "The Piezo channel family, including Piezo1 and Piezo2, includes essential mechanosensitive transduction molecules in mammals. Functioning in the conversion of mechanical signals to biological signals to regulate a plethora of physiological processes, Piezo channels, which have a unique homotrimeric three-blade propeller-shaped structure, utilize a cap-motion and plug-and-latch mechanism to gate their ion-conducting pathways. Piezo channels have a wide range of biological roles in various human systems, both in vitro and in vivo. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of their antagonists and agonists, and therefore further investigation is needed. Remarkably, increasingly compelling evidence demonstrates that Piezo channel function in the urinary system is important. This review article systematically summarizes the existing evidence of the importance of Piezo channels, including protein structure, mechanogating mechanisms, and pharmacological characteristics, with a particular focus on their physiological and pathophysiological roles in the urinary system.

By monolithically combining the compressive and tensile ultrathin AlN bilayer membranes (20-60 nm) during deposition, perfectly curved three-dimensional (3D) architectures are spontaneously formed upon dry-releasing from the substrate via a 3D MEMS approach: the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible strain-induced self-rolled-up membrane (S-RuM) method. The thermal stability of the AlN 3D architectures is examined, and the curvature of S-RuM microtubes and helical structures as a function of the cumulative membrane thickness and stress are characterized experimentally and simulated using a finite-element physiomechanic method.

The post-synthetic amine and BWO modified MIL-100 (Fe) nanofillers were synthesized. The photocatalytic property of amine-functionalized and BWO@MIL-100(Fe) nanofillers was confirmed by the lesser bandgap energy than the unmodified MIL-100 (Fe) nanofiller. Herein, we constructed a nanofillers grafted PVDF membrane via in-situ polymerization technique for the pirimicarb reduction and photodegradation. Furthermore, the nanofiller's grafted membranes were characterized by FESEM, XRD, FTIR, and contact angle analysis. The carboxylic acid peak was observed on the FTIR which demonstrated the PAA grafted on the membrane surface and similar crystalline peaks evident that the nanofillers were grafted on the membrane surface. Furthermore, surface morphology studies have exhibited the dispersion of nanofillers and enhanced microvoids in the cross-section of the membrane. The decrease in the water contact angle of the membrane depicted the improved antifouling properties and surface energy.

The device function is based on the process that the piezoelectric micropump pumps the dialysis fluid into the mass-transfer compartment microchannels, where the interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose diffusion into this dialysis fluid gives it a glucose content, then detected and measured in the sensor section. This diffusion takes place through the semipermeable membranes located in the microchannels at the base of the hollow microneedles entering the body skin painlessly. The value of dialysis fluid flow rate (1\u00a0\u03bcL/min) was chosen so that the best achievable recovery factor can be obtained while the size and time delay of system were being kept at the best minimum possible. In the mass-transfer compartment, the number of microneedles, the dimensions of microchannels and the thickness of membranes were selected so as to achieve the best appropriate recovery factor, minimum possible size as well as considering the fabrication feasibility.

{"title": "A Review on the Role of TRP Channels and Their Potential as Drug Targets_An Insight Into the TRP Channel Drug Discovery Methodologies.", "abstract": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins are a large group of ion channels that control many physiological functions in our body. These channels are considered potential therapeutic drug targets for various diseases such as neurological disorders, cancers, cardiovascular disease, and many more. The Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in the year 2021 was awarded to two scientists for the discovery of TRP and PIEZO ion channels. Improving our knowledge of technologies for their study is essential. In the present study, we reviewed the role of TRP channel types in the control of normal physiological functions as well as disease conditions. Also, we discussed the current and novel technologies that can be used to study these channels successfully. As such, Flux assays for detecting ionic flux through ion channels are among the core and widely used tools for screening drug compounds. Technologies based on these assays are available in fully automated high throughput set-ups and help detect changes in radiolabeled or non-radiolabeled ionic flux. Aurora's Ion Channel Reader (ICR), which works based on label-free technology of flux assay, offers sensitive, accurate, and reproducible measurements to perform drug ranking matching with patch-clamp (gold standard) data.

For this purpose, a system based on a set of devices (piezoelectric sensor, optical module and thermistor) able to detect the heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) in mice anesthetized with sevoflurane was implemented. Results were validated by comparison with the reported literature on similar anesthetics. A new non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) module was developed, and its first results reflect the viability of its integration in the system. The sensors were strategically positioned on mice, and the signals were acquired through a custom-made printed circuit board during imaging procedures with a micro-PET (Positron Emission Tomography). For sevoflurane concentration of 1.5%, the average values obtained were: 388 bpm (beats/minute), 124 rpm (respirations/minute) and 88.9% for the heart rate, respiratory rate and SpO2, respectively. From the ECG information, the value obtained for the heart rate was around 352 bpm for injectable anesthesia. The results compare favorably to the ones established in the literature, proving the reliability of the proposed system. The ECG measurements show its potential for mice heart monitoring during imaging acquisitions and thus for integration into the developed system.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["Regina GOliveira", "Pedro M MCorreia", "Ana L MSilva", "Pedro M C CEncarna\u00e7\u00e3o", "Fabiana MRibeiro", "Ismael FCastro", "Jo\u00e3o F C AVeloso"], "doi": "10.3390/s22114264\n10.1186/2191-219X-2-44\n10.1538/expanim.14-0050\n10.3390/s18113653\n10.1117/1.JBO.24.6.066011\n10.1088/2057-1976/ab79f1\n10.1016/j.nima.2016.05.004\n10.1093/ilar.53.1.55\n10.1088/1361-6501/ab8cfc\n10.1258/la.2010.009085\n10.1093/ilar/ilab016\n10.1371/journal.pone.0124665"}

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the eigenfrequency and the early strength development of cement mortar. Embedded piezoceramic-based smart aggregates recorded the early strength of cement mortar. An eigenfrequency analysis model demonstrated the relationship between strength and frequency. Experiments were performed by using piezoelectric transducers to monitor the early strength formation process during the testing period. Three types of specimens with different strength grades were tested, and the early strength formation processes were recorded. The experimental results demonstrate that cement mortar strength has a good linear relationship with the resonance frequency, and the average square of the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.98.

{"title": "Parameter Optimization of a Magnetic Coupled Piezoelectric Energy Harvester with the Homogenized Material-Numerical Approach and Experimental Study.", "abstract": "This paper presents the process optimization of some key parameters, such as beam spacing, flux density and optimal impedance load matching of magnetic coupled piezoelectric harvesters. In order to do this, the distributed parameters model of this structure, containing macro-fiber components (MFC) with homogenous material in the piezoelectric fiber layer, was determined. Next, the computational model of this structure was designed on the basis of the first-order shear theory (FOST). The performed analysis of the calculated voltage outputs on the basis of the theoretical approach and finite element model by various beam spacing allowed us to indicate that optimized parameters play an important role in enhancing the efficiency of the system. Experiments carried out in a laboratory stand for this structure, allowed for the verification of the numerical results.

{"title": "Stress Monitoring of Concrete via Uniaxial Piezoelectric Sensor.", "abstract": "The uniaxial piezoelectric sensor was developed to overcome the problem of reflecting the output charge of the piezoelectric element as a combination of vectors in the three stress directions. The work performance of the uniaxial piezoelectric sensor under varying load patterns and load rates was investigated. The sensor was embedded in concrete to monitor stress, and its elastic modulus was used as the intermediate bridge to establish the correlation between the embedded sensor and the external sensor. Furthermore, a correction factor for the charge transformation strain was suggested to overcome the mismatching of the sensor's medium and the concrete. Considering related circumstances, a new stress monitoring method based on a uniaxial piezoelectric sensor was proposed, which can achieve stress whole-process monitoring in concrete and confining stress monitoring in the reinforced concrete column. The results reveal that through the proposed method, the output charge curve of the sensor has a substantial overlap with the stress waveform and high fitting linearity. The work performance of the sensor was stable, and its sensitivity was not affected by loading rate and load pattern. The sensor was embedded in concrete and can coordinate with the concrete deformation. The correction factor of strain obtained by the sensor embedded in concrete was 1.07. The relationship between the charge produced by the embedded sensor and its external calibration sensitivity may be used to implement the whole process of stress monitoring in concrete.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["ChenWu", "HongXiang", "ShaofeiJiang", "ShenglanMa"], "doi": "10.3390/s22114041\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120783\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109383\n10.1016/j.tws.2021.107949\n10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102947\n10.3151/jact.19.999\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000879\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.124881\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.03.002\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112884\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109924\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.08.021\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002289\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2004.00163.x\n10.1016/j.yofte.2021.102506\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.11.013\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.05.011\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.04.105\n10.1080/10589759.2015.1046452\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.02.048\n10.1016/j.acme.2018.12.007\n10.1117/12.602658\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/026\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2006)132:7(565)\n10.1155/2013/978313\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/10/105035\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/6/065012\n10.1177/1045389X15610909\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.07.087\n10.3390/s17081930\n10.1177/1045389X17689935\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.03.041\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1988)114:8(1804)"}

{"title": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Intestinal Sleeve Implants for the Treatment of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.", "abstract": "Currently, treatment of diabetes and associated obesity involves Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy to reduce the absorption of nutrients from the intestine to achieve blood glucose control. However, the surgical procedure and subsequent recovery are physically and psychologically burdensome for patients, with possible side effects, so alternative treatments are being developed. In this study, two methods, solution casting and machine direction orientation (MDO), were used to prepare intestinal implants made of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) film and implant them into the duodenum of type 2 diabetic rats for the treatment of obesity and blood glucose control. The PVDF film obtained by the MDO process was characterized by FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, XRD and piezoelectricity tests, which showed higher composition of \u03b2 crystalline phase and better elongation and mechanical strength in specific directions. Therefore, the material was finally tested on rats after it was proven to be non-toxic by biological toxicity tests. The PVDF was implanted into alloxan-induced diabetic rats, which were used as a model of impaired insulin secretion due to pancreatic beta cell destruction rather than obesity-induced diabetes, and rats were tracked for 24 days, showing significantly improved body weight and blood glucose levels. As an alternative therapeutic option, intestinal sleeve implant showed future potential for application.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["Hao-MingChang", "Wei-PingZhan", "Hsieh-ChihTsai", "Meng-RuYang"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14112178\n10.4103/2468-8827.184853\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30163-5\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30058-2\n10.1038/oby.2008.351\n10.1111/j.1742-1241.2007.01336.x\n10.2174/187152908785849080\n10.4088/JCP.v65n0507\n10.2337/db07-0633\n10.1001/archfami.9.7.631\n10.1089/dia.2010.0037\n10.1016/j.soard.2010.10.019\n10.1097/00000658-200010000-00007\n10.1097/01.sla.0000089851.41115.1b\n10.1007/s11695-007-9151-x\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181e90b31\n10.1016/j.suc.2011.08.012\n10.1007/s11695-012-0607-2\n10.1016/j.orcp.2015.08.003\n10.1381/096089201321209468\n10.1016/j.nut.2018.05.024\n10.1016/S0039-6060(03)00392-1\n10.1007/s00464-008-9913-0\n10.1155/2018/7823182\n10.1007/s11695-018-3123-1\n10.1007/s11695-015-1594-x\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2019.100617\n10.1002/polb.23146\n10.1063/1.361055\n10.1080/1539445X.2010.495630\n10.1002/app.33239\n10.1007/BF01739296\n10.1016/j.tca.2007.05.023\n10.1080/00150193.2014.964596\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1002/app.28851\n10.1016/j.cap.2016.10.011\n10.1364/OME.8.002579\n10.3390/membranes10030038\n10.1007/s11695-018-3322-9"}

{"title": "Study on the Actuating Performance of an Embedded Macro Fiber Composite Considering the Shear Lag Effect.", "abstract": "Macro fiber composite (MFC), which are new ultrathin piezoelectric smart materials, are mostly applied in the fields of shell structure deformation and vibration control. Among others, the application of embedded MFCs in sandwich structures has received wide attention. Currently, its actuating force formula is primarily acquired based on the Bernoulli-Euler Model, which does not consider the shear lag effect and actuating force of MFC ends. To study the actuating performance of an MFC in a sandwich structure, according to its action characteristics, the MFC is divided into upper and lower actuating units without any interaction between to two under the condition of plane strain, and the shear lag effect is considered between the units and the top and bottom of the sandwich structure. The actuating force of the MFC ends is obtained by considering its influence on the bending deformation of the sandwich structure, which deduces the actuating force formula of the embedded MFC. In contrast to ANSYS piezoelectric simulation, the distribution of the MFC interior normal stress is similar to the result from ANSYS piezoelectric simulation, and there is a very small deviation between the MFC end and central normal stress and the result from ANSYS piezoelectric simulation. Taking the end deflection of the sandwich structure with an embedded MFC as an example, the actuating force simulation of the MFC considering the shear lag effect is compared with the ANSYS piezoelectric simulation and actuating force simulation based on the Bernoulli-Euler model. The result indicates that the actuating force simulation of the MFC considering the shear lag effect is closer to the ANSYS piezoelectric simulation, which proves the rationality and necessity of considering the shear lag effect and end actuating force of the MFC.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["JianhuiWei", "ShuangGao", "JiaruiZhang", "JianweiTu"], "doi": "10.3390/ma15113968\n10.1088/0964-1726/5/1/005\n10.1177/1045389X9700800504\n10.1016/j.ast.2017.02.013\n10.1115/1.4003941\n10.1177/1077546311421516\n10.1177/1077546314526919\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/4/033\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab47d5\n10.3390/app9142893\n10.5604/12314005.1137311\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/6/016\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2007.11.006\n10.1177/1077546307078757\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/3/035010\n10.2514/1.J052715\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.10.035\n10.1016/S0045-7949(98)00280-6\n10.1007/s00158-008-0273-0\n10.1115/1.2801276\n10.1006/jsvi.1996.0104\n10.1177/1045389X9000100102\n10.1007/s11431-009-0211-4\n10.2514/1.J057681\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/12/125032\n10.1016/0020-7225(91)90165-Y\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0207(19970415)40:7<1197::AID-NME109>3.0.CO;2-B\n10.1016/S0020-7683(02)00647-9\n10.1088/0965-0393/21/8/085014\n10.1023/A:1004817011240\n10.1177/1045389X15620060"}
{"title": "Sound Transmission Loss of Metamaterial Honeycomb Core Sandwich Plate Elastically Connected with Periodic Subwavelength Arrays of Shunted Piezoelectric Patches.", "abstract": "Honeycomb core sandwich plates are widely used as a lightweight, high-strength sound insulation material. However, they do not perform well in specific frequency bands. Acoustic metamaterials can break the law of mass in specific frequency bands and have high sound transmission loss (STL); however, the resonance frequency is difficult to regulate. To solve this problem, this paper first proposes an infinitely large metamaterial honeycomb core sandwich plate, which can generate newly tuned piezoelectric resonance frequencies, and we study its STL. The structure has piezoelectric patches arranged in sub-wavelength arrays with inductance shunting circuits that are elastically connected to both sides of the honeycomb core sandwich plate. The effective dynamic mass density and effective dynamic bending stiffness of the metamaterial plates were obtained using the effective medium (EM) method. A theoretical model for the numerical calculation of oblique STL and diffuse-field STL was established by the structural bending wave method. The finite element simulation method was used to verify that the metamaterial plates can generate three peaks at 1147 Hz, 1481 Hz and 1849 Hz in oblique or diffuse-field STL curves, which reached 57 dB, 86 dB and 63 dB, respectively, and are significantly better than the plate rigidly connected with piezoelectric sheets and the bare plate with the same mass. In order to better understand the characteristics of STL, the explicit functions of the resonance frequencies were derived.

{"title": "Active Vibration Control of Piezoelectric Sandwich Plates.", "abstract": "This paper deals with the active vibration control of piezoelectric sandwich plate. The structure consists of a substrate plate layer sandwiched between two layers of piezoelectric sensor and actuator. Based on laminate theory and constitutive equation of piezoelectric material, the vibration active control dynamic equation of the sandwich structure is established by using hypothetical mode method and Hamilton principle. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is used to solve it. The form of hypothetical solution is used for approximate solution, which is simple and accurate. The method of this paper is verified by several examples. The parametric studies of the sandwich plate structures are carried out. The results show that applying different boundary conditions and piezoelectric patch positions to the structures have a great influence on the natural frequency. When the driving voltage increases, the deflection of the plate structures increase approximately linearly. The active vibration control studies are investigated as well. The results show that within a certain range, the larger the value of the speed feedback coefficient, the better the active control effect. The positions of the piezoelectric patches affect the effectiveness and cost of active control.

Nano-ZnO synthesized by the ultrasound-assisted method can reach a safe level because of its import physical processing characteristics. Firstly, the micromorphology and microstructure of nano-ZnO synthesized by the ultrasonic method were compared with that by the mechanical stirring method through atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared. Secondly, the on-line monitoring of different ultrasonic fields in real-time was studied during the whole synthesis process of nano-ZnO by polyvinylidene fluoride sensor, and two control groups (water medium) were set. The results showed that nano-ZnO obtained by the ultrasonic method were smaller in size and had less surface roughness compared with the mechanical stirring method. The nucleation and crystallization process of nano-ZnO was controlled by the ultrasonic method with sharp diffraction peaks of higher intensities. Moreover, for the ultrasonic mechanism, it was found that the oscillation behavior of bubbles varied from liquid to liquid, and variation was also found in the same liquid under different restraint of interfaces. Based on voltage waveforms monitored in the three liquid media, differences in the life cycle of cavitation bubble oscillation, cycle of collapse stage, maximum voltage amplitude, and acoustic intensity were observed. The physical mechanism of ultrasound-assisted synthesis of nano-ZnO was revealed through voltage fluctuations of the acoustics signal, which can lay a theoretical foundation for the controllability of food ultrasonic physical processing.", "journal": "Foods (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["LeiZhang", "YangHu", "XueWang", "AoZhang", "XianliGao", "Abu El-Gasim AYagoub", "HaileMa", "CunshanZhou"], "doi": "10.3390/foods11111656\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.09.230\n10.1016/j.jiec.2022.03.024\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2016.12.031\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.12.232\n10.1016/j.msec.2017.03.280\n10.19812/j.cnki.jfsq11-5956/ts.2016.11.051\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.03.066\n10.1016/j.postharvbio.2022.111891\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.112472\n10.1016/j.ifset.2010.06.003\n10.1021/la104825u\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.118\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.089\n10.1016/j.ssc.2014.07.011\n10.1016/j.matlet.2006.11.089\n10.1016/S0009-2614(03)00842-X\n10.3390/foods11060880\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.12.043\n10.3390/foods11060883\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2016.07.014\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2016.01.034\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2014.09.006\n10.1016/j.cis.2016.08.004\n10.1016/j.matlet.2006.07.133\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2008.05.017\n10.1016/j.matlet.2008.12.035\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.119\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.12.056\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2011.02.017\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2012.10.015\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125750\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.128418\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2021.105803\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2015.11.021\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2015.11.010\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.117639\n10.1016/j.cis.2017.07.033\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2013.11.009\n10.1038/nature17431\n10.3969/j.issn.1673-1689.2020.01.011\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2021.105794\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2016.12.034\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2015.04.006\n10.1016/j.lwt.2016.08.002"}

Initially, optimized conditions of ACP for relaxor-PT SCs and unsolved issues on polycrystalline ceramics and spurious modes are reviewed. Second, the ferroelectric domain size dependence of piezoelectricity associated with ACP is discussed. We hypothesize that a tradeoff between domain and domain wall contributions exists for high piezoelectricity, suggesting an optimum 109\u00b0 domain wall size, which is presumably dependent on compositions, crystallographic symmetries, and domain configurations. Finally, crystals synthesized by a solid-state crystal growth (SSCG) method are briefly introduced due to their unprecedented piezoelectricity obtained by ACP ( d", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-06-09", "authors": ["Hwang-PillKim", "HaotianWan", "ChengtaoLuo", "YiqinSun", "YohachiYamashita", "TomoakiKaraki", "Ho-YongLee", "XiaoningJiang"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3181236"}

{"title": "Design considerations for piezocomposite materials for electrical stimulation in medical implants.", "abstract": "Incidence of non-union following long bone fracture fixation and spinal fusion procedures is increasing, and very costly for patients and the medical system. Direct current (DC) electrical stimulation has shown success as an adjunct therapy to stimulate bone healing and increase surgery success rates, though drawbacks of current devices and implantable battery packs have limited widespread use. Energy harvesting utilising piezoelectric materials has been widely studied for powering devices without a battery, and a preclinical animal study has shown efficacy of a piezocomposite spinal fusion implant resulting in faster, more robust fusion. Most piezoelectric energy harvesters operate most effectively at high frequencies, limiting power generation from loads experienced by orthopaedic implants during human motion. This work characterises the efficient power generation capability of a novel composite piezoelectric material under simulated walking loads. Building on compliant layer adaptive composite stacks (CLACS), the power generation of mixed-mode CLACS (MMCLACS) is defined. Utilising poling direction to capitalise on in-plane strain generation due to compliant layer expansion, MMCLACS significantly increased power output compared to a standard piezo stack. The combination of radial and through-thickness poled piezoelectric elements within a stack to create MMCLACS significantly increases power generation under low-frequency dynamic loads. This technology can be adapted to a variety of architectures and assembled as a load-bearing energy harvester within current implants. MMCLACS integrated with implants would provide enough power to deliver bone healing electrical stimulation directly to the fusion site, decreasing non-union rates, and also could provide quantitative assessment of healing progression through load sensing.", "journal": "Journal of medical engineering & technology", "date": "2022-06-09", "authors": ["EmberKrech", "EvanHaas", "GraceTideman", "BonnieReinsch", "ElizabethFriis"], "doi": "10.1080/03091902.2022.2080881\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab85a5"}

This study fabricated size 2-0 PVDF and PP bidirectional barbed sutures and compared their mechanical properties and anchoring performance in patellar tendons. The mechanical properties were evaluated via tensile testing, and the anchoring performance of the barbed sutures was assessed by a tendon suture pullout test. Sixty porcine patellar tendons were harvested, transected to mimic a full-thickness injury, and repaired using a cross-locked cruciate suturing technique. The ultimate tensile force was 60% higher for the PVDF barbed sutures (22.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009N) than for the PP barbed sutures (14.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7\u2009N).

Results reveal that power output peaks at a best frequency much higher than implied by the low-pass character of nonlinear capacitance, and much higher than the whole-cell resistive-capacitive corner frequency. High frequency power output is enabled by a -90\u00b0 shift in the phase of electrical charge displacement in the membrane, manifested electrically as emergence of imaginary-valued nonlinear capacitance.", "journal": "Journal of the Royal Society, Interface", "date": "2022-06-09", "authors": ["Richard DRabbitt"], "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2022.0139\n10.1126/science.3966153\n10.1038/nature01059\n10.1038/35012009\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.07.034\n10.1038/s41586-021-04152-4\n10.1038/s41467-021-27915-z\n10.1007/s12264-022-00839-4\n10.1529/biophysj.107.107573\n10.1021/j100063a004\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.05.025\n10.1016/0006-291x(80)91619-8\n10.1007/s00232-009-9202-4\n10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81053-1\n10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75481-7\n10.1073/pnas.2025206118\n10.1038/s41467-018-05483-z\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2608-18.2019\n10.1038/srep19475\n10.1007/BF00199252\n10.7554/eLife.47667\n10.1007/s004240050395\n10.1038/s41598-021-95121-4\n10.1016/j.isci.2019.11.036\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0425-18.2018\n10.1073/pnas.96.8.4420\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.02.026\n10.1073/pnas.1900695116\n10.1073/pnas.1302911110\n10.1073/pnas.2003838117\n10.1039/c5sm01519g\n10.1007/s10237-005-0011-0\n10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78092-5\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.03.052\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050572\n10.1101/2022.02.02.478769\n10.1016/s0378-5955(97)00135-4\n10.1038/ncomms14530"}

{"title": "Efficacy and safety of piezocision in accelerating maxillary anterior teeth en-masse retraction: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.", "abstract": "Orthodontic treatment is commonly more time-consuming in adults than in teenagers, especially when it comes to the maxillary en-masse retraction, which may take 9 months or even longer. As to solve this concern, orthodontists have been striving to seek new methods for shortening orthodontic treatment time. Piezocision, as a popular alternative treatment, has been widely used in different types of tooth movement. However, its effect on en-masse retraction of maxillary anterior teeth remains unclear. This randomized controlled trial intends to figure out the role piezocision plays in accelerating en-masse retraction.\nThis protocol is designed for a prospective, single-center, assessor-blinded and parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Twenty adult patients aged from 18 to 40 whose orthodontic treatment required bilateral maxillary first premolars extraction will be randomly assigned to the piezocision group and the control group at a ratio of 1:1. The piezocision group will undergo en-masse retraction immediately after the piezo surgery, while the control group will start en-masse retraction directly. Both groups will be followed up every 2 weeks to maintain the retraction force until the end of space closure. The space closing time is set as the primary endpoint. Meanwhile, the secondary endpoints include the change of root length, labial and palatal alveolar bone thickness, vertical bone height, probing depth of maxillary anterior teeth, cephalometric measurements, visual analogue scale, and postoperative satisfaction questionnaire.\nThis study will attempt to provide more convincing evidence to verify whether piezocision will shorten the time of en-masse retraction or not. Distinguished with previous studies, our study has made some innovations in orthodontic procedure and primary outcome measurement, aiming to clarify the efficacy and safety of piezocision-assisted en-masse retraction in Chinese population.\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR 1900024297 .

{"title": "Present status and future directions: Surgical endodontics.", "abstract": "Endodontic surgery encompasses several procedures for the treatment of teeth with a history of failed root canal treatment, such as root-end surgery, crown and root resections, surgical perforation repair and intentional replantation. Endodontic microsurgery is the evolution of the traditional apicoectomy techniques and incorporates high magnification, ultrasonic root-end preparation and root-end filling with biocompatible filling materials. Modern endodontic surgery uses the dental operating microscope, incorporates cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for preoperative diagnosis and treatment planning, and has adopted piezoelectric approaches to osteotomy and root manipulation. Crown and root resection techniques have benefitted from the same technological advances. This review focuses on the current state of root-end surgery by comparing the techniques and materials applied during endodontic microsurgery to the most widely used earlier methods and materials. The most recent additions to the clinical protocol and technical improvements are discussed, and an outlook on future directions is given. Whilst nonsurgical retreatment remains the first choice to address most cases with a history of endodontic failure, modern endodontic microsurgery has become a predictable and minimally invasive alternative for the retention of natural teeth.", "journal": "International endodontic journal", "date": "2022-06-08", "authors": ["Frank CSetzer", "Samuel IKratchman"], "doi": "10.1111/iej.13783"}
{"title": "Outperforming piezoelectric ultrasonics with high-reliability single-membrane CMUT array elements.", "abstract": "It has long been hypothesized that capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) could potentially outperform piezoelectric technologies. However, challenges with dielectric charging, operational hysteresis, and transmit sensitivity have stood as obstacles to these performance outcomes. In this paper, we introduce key architectural features to enable high-reliability CMUTs with enhanced performance. Typically, a CMUT element in an array is designed with an ensemble of smaller membranes oscillating together to transmit or detect ultrasound waves. However, this approach can lead to unreliable behavior and suboptimal transmit performance if these smaller membranes oscillate out of phase or collapse at different voltages. In this work, we designed CMUT array elements composed of a single long rectangular membrane, with the aim of improving the output pressure and electromechanical efficiency. We compare the performance of three different modifications of this architecture: traditional contiguous dielectric, isolated isolation post (IIP), and insulated electrode-post (EP) CMUTs. EPs were designed to improve performance while also imparting robustness to charging and minimization of hysteresis. To fabricate these devices, a wafer-bonding process was developed with near-100% bonding yield. EP CMUT elements achieved electromechanical efficiency values as high as 0.95, higher than values reported with either piezoelectric transducers or previous CMUT architectures. Moreover, all investigated CMUT architectures exhibited transmit efficiency 2-3 times greater than published CMUT or piezoelectric transducer elements in the 1.5-2.0\u2009MHz range. The EP and IIP CMUTs demonstrated considerable charging robustness, demonstrating minimal charging over 500,000 collapse-snap-back actuation cycles while also mitigating hysteresis.

However, the non-negligible energy loss and inferior temperature stability of PVDF-based polymers deteriorated the energy storage performance or even the thermal runaway, which could be ascribed to vulnerable amorphous regions at elevated temperatures. Herein, a new strategy was proposed to achieve high energy density and high temperature stability simultaneously of PVDF/PMMA blends by ", "journal": "Frontiers in chemistry", "date": "2022-06-07", "authors": ["YongbinLiu", "ZhengweiLiu", "JinghuiGao", "MingWu", "XiaojieLou", "YanhuaHu", "YongLi", "LishengZhong"], "doi": "10.3389/fchem.2022.902487\n10.1021/acs.macromol.6b02669\n10.1021/acs.macromol.6b02669\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2007.07.012\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2007.07.012\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1126/science.1127798\n10.1126/science.1127798\n10.1021/acsapm.9b00061\n10.1021/acsapm.9b00061\n10.1155/2010/829752\n10.1155/2010/829752\n10.1126/science.aau0759\n10.1126/science.aau0759\n10.1021/ma00149a010\n10.1021/ma00149a010\n10.1016/j.polymer.2016.03.004\n10.1016/j.polymer.2016.03.004\n10.1021/acsaem.7b00211\n10.1021/acsaem.7b00211\n10.1007/s10973-018-7764-z\n10.1007/s10973-018-7764-z\n10.1007/s10973-016-5240-1\n10.1007/s10973-016-5240-1\n10.1002/adfm.200900589\n10.1002/adfm.200900589\n10.1038/ncomms3845\n10.1038/ncomms3845\n10.1038/nature14647\n10.1038/nature14647\n10.1039/C9EE03603B\n10.1039/C9EE03603B\n10.1109/TDEI.2018.00763710.1109/tdei.2019.8726017\n10.1109/TDEI.2018.00763710.1109/tdei.2019.8726017\n10.1039/D0CS00765J\n10.1039/D0CS00765J\n10.1073/pnas.1603792113\n10.1073/pnas.1603792113\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.02.006\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.02.006\n10.1039/D1EE03186D\n10.1039/D1EE03186D\n10.1002/marc.201900406\n10.1002/marc.201900406\n10.1142/S1793604719500346\n10.1002/masy.19940860106\n10.1002/masy.19940860106\n10.1080/15583728509412823\n10.1080/15583728509412823\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00495\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00495\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.127\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.127\n10.1002/adfm.201808567\n10.1002/adfm.201808567\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.126093\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.126093\n10.1021/am508488w\n10.1021/am508488w\n10.1039/D0TA03540H\n10.1039/D0TA03540H\n10.1016/j.ensm.2021.10.010\n10.1016/j.ensm.2021.10.010\n10.1016/S0079-6700(02)00085-0\n10.1016/S0079-6700(02)00085-0\n10.1002/app.47535\n10.1002/app.47535\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106438\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106438\n10.1016/j.matt.2021.04.026\n10.1016/j.matt.2021.04.026\n10.1016/j.polymer.2017.03.022\n10.1016/j.polymer.2017.03.022\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.049\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.049\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.107934\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.107934\n10.1002/adma.201805672\n10.1002/adma.201805672"}

{"title": "Study on the thermal reduction effect of organic components in spent ternary lithium battery cathode active materials.", "abstract": "To improve the adhesion between cathode materials and current collector, and increase the electronic conductivity among electroactive substances, a certain proportion of conductive agents (acetylene black) and agglomerant (PVDF) are usually added in the battery manufacturing process. However, these conductive agents have negative effects on the recovery of cathode materials by pyrolysis or calcination. Recognizing this issue, a method based on the concept of \"treating spent with spent\" was developed in this paper. Organic matters contained in cathode active materials functioned as the reduction reagents, which can reduce the valence state of transition metals, resulting in the breakdown of the strong chemical bond and the stable layered structure of cathode materials. In this study, the thermal reduction effect of different organic components on cathode active materials was analyzed respectively to evaluate the reduction function of each component. XRD, XPS and ICP-MS were used to compare and analyze changes of phase, element compound state and ion leaching efficiencies of different cathode materials before and after thermal reduction under different amounts of reducing agents. The results show that both PVDF and acetylene black reduced the high-valent metals to low-valent oxides or elemental substances, demonstrating their thermal reduction capabilities. Comparisons of the XRD, XPS analysis and ion leaching results of thermal reduced products suggest that acetylene black has a stronger thermal reduction ability than that of PVDF. The results also show that the reduction of the high nickel cathode material (NCM811) is easier than that of the low nickel cathode material (NCM111).", "journal": "Waste management (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2022-06-07", "authors": ["HaidiJiang", "ZhaohuiLi", "WeiningXie", "GuangwenZhang", "ZhaoyiYu", "QichangLu", "YaqunHe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wasman.2022.05.011"}

{"title": "An efficient Lamb wave-based virtual refined time-reversal method for damage localization in plates using broadband measurements.", "abstract": "This study proposes a modified virtual time-reversal (VTR) algorithm for baseline signal-free damage detection in plate-like structures. The physical actuation and sensing of Lamb waves are performed using a broadband Gaussian excitation instead of the conventional narrowband modulated tone burst excitations. The forward response and the reconstructed signal due to the time-reversal process for a narrowband input signal are then constructed virtually using the broadband transfer function. The method eliminates the possibility of numerical errors encountered in the conventional VTR method based on narrowband excitations. It is also more efficient than the traditional VTR algorithm because it can probe at multiple excitation frequencies using a single measurement for each sensing path. This modified VTR algorithm is employed in the recently developed refined time-reversal method (RTRM), which uses an extended signal length of the reconstructed signal for computing damage index (DI) and probes the structure at the best reconstruction frequency. The new method is termed the virtual refined time-reversal method (VRTRM). The DIs based on the VRTRM are used in the reconstruction algorithm for probabilistic inspection of defects to achieve baseline signal-free localization of damages. The efficacy of the proposed VRTRM for damage localization is experimentally verified with the established technique RTRM. Experiments are performed in an aluminium plate equipped with a network of surface-bonded piezoelectric patch transducers to illustrate the conventional VTR's pitfalls and the modified VTR's accuracy for a single mass damage scenario. The results show that the proposed VRTRM is as accurate as the established technique RTRM in estimating the reconstructed signals and localizing a block mass damage. Finally, the VRTRM is shown to localize in a dual damage scenario with excellent accuracy. In contrast, the conventional main mode-based VTR method fails to localize the damages with or without single-mode tuning.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-06-03", "authors": ["MKannusamy", "SantoshKapuria", "SaptarshiSasmal"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106767"}
{"title": "Plumbagin relieves rheumatoid arthritis through nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) pathway.", "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the effects of plumbagin on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its mechanism. The RA cell model was simulated following the treatment of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). After the treatment of various concentrations of plumbagin, the impact of plumbagin on the cell viability was examined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was established using the solution of bovine type II collagen. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the changes of ankle joint tissue, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot were applied to detect the level of inflammatory cytokines. Plumbagin inhibited the viability of human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS) at the concentration of 1\u00a0~\u00a03.5\u00a0\u03bcM. The inhibitory effect of 1\u00a0\u03bcM plumbagin on cell proliferation was similar to that of methotrexate, the drug used as the positive control. Plumbagin downregulated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in IL-1\u03b2-treated HFLS, and suppressed the activation of I\u03baB and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) as well as the entry of p65 into the nucleus. It was also demonstrated in animal experiments that plumbagin inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway, down-regulated the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and MMPs, and alleviated joint damage in CIA-modeled mice. Collectively speaking, plumbagin might down-regulate the levels of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs through inhibiting the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, thereby attenuating RA-induced damage to cells and joints.", "journal": "Bioengineered", "date": "2022-06-03", "authors": ["ChangShu", "JunChen", "MeiyanLv", "YiyuanXi", "JujiaZheng", "XiangweiXu"], "doi": "10.1080/21655979.2022.2081756\n10.1007/s13205-017-0888-1"}

{"title": "Kinematics of the head and associated vertebral artery length changes during high-velocity, low-amplitude cervical spine manipulation.", "abstract": "Cervical spine manipulation (CSM) is a frequently used treatment for neck pain. Despite its demonstrated efficacy, concerns regarding the potential of stretch damage to vertebral arteries (VA) during CSM remain. The purpose of this study was to quantify the angular displacements of the head relative to the sternum and the associated VA length changes during the thrust phase of CSM.\nRotation and lateral flexion CSM procedures were delivered bilaterally from C1 to C7 to three male cadaveric donors (Jan 2016-Dec 2019). For each CSM the force-time profile was recorded using a thin, flexible pressure pad (100-200\u00a0Hz), to determine the timing of the thrust. Three dimensional displacements of the head relative to the sternum were recorded using an eight-camera motion analysis system (120-240\u00a0Hz) and angular displacements of the head relative to the sternum were computed in Matlab. Positive kinematic values indicate flexion, left lateral flexion, and left rotation. Ipsilateral refers to the same side as the clinician's contact and contralateral, the opposite. Length changes of the VA were recorded using eight piezoelectric ultrasound crystals (260-557\u00a0Hz), inserted along the entire vessel. VA length changes were calculated as D\u2009=\u2009(L\nIrrespective of the type of CSM, the side or level of CSM application, angular displacements of the head and associated VA length changes during the thrust phase of CSM were small.

{"title": "Instrument for tensile testing of individual collagen fibrils with facile sample coupling and uncoupling.", "abstract": "Collagen is the major structural protein in human bodies constituting about 30% of the entire protein mass. Through a self-assembly process, triple helical collagen molecules assemble into high aspect-ratio fibers of tens to hundreds of nanometer diameter, known as collagen fibrils (CFs). In the last decade, several methods for tensile testing these CFs emerged. However, these methods are either overly time-consuming or offer low data acquisition bandwidth, rendering dynamic investigation of tensile properties impossible. Here, we describe a novel instrument for tensile testing of individual CFs. CFs are furnished with magnetic beads using a custom magnetic tweezer. Subsequently, CFs are lifted by magnetic force, allowing them to be picked-up by a microgripper structure, which is mounted on a cantilever-based interferometric force probe. A piezo-lever actuator is used to apply tensile displacements and to perform tensile tests of tethered CFs, after alignment. Once the mechanical tests are finished, CFs are removed from the microgripper by application of a magnetic field. Our novel instrument enables tensile tests with at least 25-fold increased throughput compared to tensile testing with an atomic force microscope while achieving force resolution (p-p) of 10 nN at a strain resolution better than 0.1%.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2022-06-02", "authors": ["MathisNalbach", "FranziskaChalupa-Gantner", "FelixSpoerl", "Victorde Bar", "BenediktBaumgartner", "Orestis GAndriotis", "ShingoIto", "AleksandrOvsianikov", "GeorgSchitter", "Philipp JThurner"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0072123"}

For samples that are opaque to visible light (such as metallic systems), it is necessary to rely on x-ray imaging methods for sample visualization. Here, we present an experimental platform developed at beamline P02.2 at the PETRA III synchrotron radiation source, which is capable of performing simultaneous x-ray imaging and diffraction of samples that are dynamically compressed in piezo-driven diamond anvil cells. This setup utilizes a partially coherent monochromatic x-ray beam to perform lensless phase contrast imaging, which can be carried out using either a parallel- or focused-beam configuration. The capabilities of this platform are illustrated by experiments on dynamically compressed Ga and Ar. Melting and solidification were identified based on the observation of solid/liquid phase boundaries in the x-ray images and corresponding changes in the x-ray diffraction patterns collected during the transition, with significant edge enhancement observed in the x-ray images collected using the focused-beam.

The actuator can achieve high speed and large stroke in the resonance mode by the stick-slip working principle and achieve nano-resolution in the non-resonant mode by the direct drive working principle. The excitation electrical signals used in the two working modes are the sine waveform and half-sine waveform, respectively. Compared with the traditional sawtooth waveform, the excitation signal of the sine and half-sine waveforms have no sudden change of voltage, which are more conducive to reduce the impact and vibration of the system. Moreover, a series of static analysis and modal analysis of the stator are carried out by the finite element method. The experimental system is built to test the output characteristics of the LTFH-PSSA. In the resonance state by the stick-slip working principle, the impedance analysis and frequency characteristic test of the LTFH-PSSA are carried out, which states that the tested resonance frequency agrees well with the simulated ones.

The power generation principle and microelement mechanics model are established, which can explain the principle that backpressure changes the internal energy of materials. The backpressure affects the internal stress of materials. The electromechanical coupling coefficient can be adjusted by the backpressure. The power generation obviously changes as the electromechanical coupling coefficient is adjusted. An experimental testing system is established, and the experimental results are analyzed to prove the effect of backpressure on the output power. There is a linear relationship between the peak voltage and backpressure. When the backpressure increases every 1 kPa, the voltage increases by 0.667 V. The voltage increment under backpressure is 5.13 times that without backpressure. The optimal output power is 12.3 mW in 30 kPa backpressure pre-load. The output power increases to the original 237% under the backpressure.

However, as a reaction proceeds inside an FP cavity, the refractive index of the reaction solution changes, detuning the cavity mode away from the vibrational mode and weakening the VSC effect. Here we overcome this issue, developing actuatable FP cavities to allow automated tuning of cavity mode energy to maintain maximized VSC during a reaction. As an example, the site-selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4-acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved by automated cavity tuning to maintain optimal VSC of the ketone carbonyl stretch during the reaction. A nearly 50\u2009% improvement in site-selective reactivity is observed compared to an FP cavity with static mirrors, demonstrating the utility of actuatable FP cavities as microreactors for organic chemistry.", "journal": "Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2022-06-01", "authors": ["KenjiHirai", "HirotoIshikawa", "YasufumiTakahashi", "James AHutchison", "HiroshiUji-I"], "doi": "10.1002/chem.202201260"}

{"title": "Extraction of Hidden Science from Nanoscale Images.", "abstract": "Scanning probe microscopies and spectroscopies enable investigation of surfaces and even buried interfaces down to the scale of chemical-bonding interactions, and this capability has been enhanced with the support of computational algorithms for data acquisition and image processing to explore physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. Here, we describe how scanning probe techniques have been enhanced by some of these recent algorithmic improvements. One improvement to the data acquisition algorithm is to advance beyond a simple rastering framework by using spirals at constant angular velocity then switching to constant linear velocity, which limits the piezo creep and hysteresis issues seen in traditional acquisition methods. One can also use image-processing techniques to model the distortions that appear from tip motion effects and to make corrections to these images. Another image-processing algorithm we discuss enables researchers to segment images by domains and subdomains, thereby highlighting reactive and interesting disordered sites at domain boundaries. Lastly, we discuss algorithms used to examine the dipole direction of individual molecules and surface domains, hydrogen bonding interactions, and molecular tilt. The computational algorithms used for scanning probe techniques are still improving rapidly and are incorporating machine learning at the next level of iteration.

Force platforms and wearable devices have been developed to study gait patterns during walking or running. However, these devices are often expensive, cumbersome, or have boundary constraints that limit the participant's motions. Recent advancements in the quality of plastic optical fiber (POF) have made it possible to manufacture a low-cost bend sensor with a novel design for use in plantar pressure monitoring. An intensity-based POF bend sensor is not only lightweight, non-invasive, and easy to construct, but it also produces a signal that requires almost no processing. In this work, we have designed, fabricated, and characterized a novel intensity POF sensor to detect the force applied by the human foot and measure the gait pattern. The sensors were put through a series of dynamic and static tests to determine their measurement range, sensitivity, and linearity, and their response was compared to that of two different commercial force sensors, including piezo resistive sensors and a clinical force platform. The results suggest that this novel POF bend sensor can be used in a wide range of applications, given its low cost and non-invasive nature.

{"title": "\"Singing\" Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors and Mitigation Methods-A Review.", "abstract": "Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors (MLCC) have a major role in modern electronic devices due to their small price and size, large range of capacitance, small ESL and ESR, and good frequency response. Unfortunately, the main dielectric material used for MLCCs, Barium Titanate, makes the capacitors vibrate due to the piezoelectric and electrostrictive effects. This vibration is transferred to the PCB, making it resonate in the audible range of 20 Hz-20 kHz, and in this way the singing capacitors phenomenon occurs. This phenomenon is usually measured with a microphone, to measure the sound pressure level, or with a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV), to measure the vibration. Besides this, other methods are mentioned in the literature, for example, the optical fiber and the active excitation method. There are several solutions to attenuate or even eliminate the acoustic noise caused by MLCC. Specially designed capacitors for low acoustic levels and different layout geometries are only two options found in the literature. To prevent the singing capacitor phenomenon, different simulations can be performed, the harmonic analysis being the most popular technique.

In this paper, similar to piezoelectric materials, three losses in Terfenol-D are considered by introducing complex quantities, representing the elastic loss, piezomagnetic loss, and magnetic loss. The frequency-dependent eddy current loss is also considered and incorporated into the complex permeability of giant magnetostrictive materials. These complex material parameters are then successfully applied to improve the popular plane-wave method (PWM) circuit model and finite element method (FEM) model. To verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods, a high-power Tonpilz Terfenol-D transducer with a resonance frequency of around 1 kHz and a maximum transmitting current response (TCR) of 187 dB/1A/\u03bcPa is manufactured and tested. The good agreement between the simulation and experimental results validates the improved PWM circuit model and FEA model, which may shed light on the more predictable design of high-power giant magnetostrictive transducers in the future.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-05-29", "authors": ["YanfeiWei", "XinYang", "YukaiChen", "ZhiheZhang", "HaobinZheng"], "doi": "10.3390/s22103781\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.065701\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2020.103477\n10.1177/1077546320932029\n10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106286\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112336\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.02.003\n10.1088/0960-1317/7/4/005\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.04.024\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112507\n10.1088/0964-1726/5/2/001\n10.1121/1.4744723\n10.1109/JSEN.2003.815846\n10.1109/TMAG.2019.2926237\n10.1121/1.5057443\n10.1016/j.ultras.2007.09.001\n10.1088/0022-3727/30/16/014\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.12.026\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3028698\n10.1080/00150199608244849\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.490-495.985\n10.1109/58.585191\n10.1121/1.381650\n10.1007/s11431-008-0184-8\n10.1121/1.383894\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.664\n10.1007/s10832-015-9985-x\n10.1016/S0925-8388(97)00079-0"}

To improve the degree of freedom (DOF) to adapt to more working scenes, a piezoelectric-electromagnetic hybrid-driven two-DOF actuator is proposed.

By introducing nonlinear factors, a linear-arch bi-stable piezoelectric energy harvester (LBPEH) is designed. In order to reveal the influence of system parameters on the dynamic characteristics of LBPEH, the magnetic force model is established by the magnetizing current method, and the restoring force model is acquired through experimental measurement. The electromechanical coupling dynamics model of the system is established based on the Lagrange equation and Kirchhoff's law. The influence of excitation amplitude and excitation frequency on the dynamic characteristics of the piezoelectric energy harvester is simulated and analyzed. Moreover, experiments are designed to verify the results of the simulation. The results reveal that the restoring force of the linear-arch beam is nonlinear, and the LBPEH constructed by the linear-arch beam has an asymmetric potential well. Changing the excitation frequency or excitation amplitude can make the system in the well chaotic and achieve a large periodic motion state. With the increase of excitation amplitude, it is beneficial for the system to realize large periodic motion.

{"title": "Study of the Influencing Factors on the Small-Quantity Fuel Injection of Piezoelectric Injector.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric injection-system provides a reliable approach for precise small-quantity fuel injection due to its fast, dynamic response. Considering the nonlinearity of a piezoelectric actuator, the complete electro-mechanical-hydraulic model of the piezoelectric injector was established and verified experimentally, which showed that it could accurately predict the fuel injection quantity. The small-quantity fuel injection with different driving voltages, pulse widths, and rail pressures was analyzed. The effects of key structural parameters of the injector on the delivery, control-chamber pressure fluctuation, and small-quantity injection characteristics were studied. The results show that the linearity of the curve of the injection volume with the pulse width was relatively poor, and there was a significant inflection point when the piezoelectric injector worked in the small pulse width region (PW < 0.6 ms). The bypass valve significantly accelerated the establishment of the control-chamber pressure, reduced the pressure fluctuation in the chamber, shortened the closing delay and duration of the needle valve, and reduced the rate of the fuel-quantity change so that it provided a greater control margin for the pulse width over the same fuel volume change interval. Under the condition of a small-quantity fuel injection of 20 mm3, decreasing the inlet orifice diameter and increasing the outlet orifice diameter shortened the minimum control pulse width and fuel injection duration required for the injector injection, which is beneficial for multiple and small-quantity fuel injection. However, these behaviors reduce the control margin for the pulse width, especially in small pulse width regions.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-05-29", "authors": ["ZhenmingLiu", "NanLiu", "JingbinLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13050813\n10.1007/BF02984041\n10.1016/j.fuel.2007.03.015\n10.1007/s38313-016-0090-6\n10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b02121\n10.1115/1.4003095\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.12.014\n10.1108/MMMS-01-2013-0004"}

{"title": "A Magnetically Coupled Piezoelectric-Electromagnetic Low-Frequency Multidirection Hybrid Energy Harvester.", "abstract": "The traditional single electromechanical conversion energy harvester can collect energy only in a single vibration direction. Moreover, it requires high environmental vibration frequency, and its output power is low. To solve these problems, a cross-shaped magnetically coupled piezoelectric-electromagnetic hybrid harvester is proposed. The harvester comprised a ring-shaped support frame, a piezoelectric generation structure, and an electromagnetic generation structure. The harvester could simultaneously generate energy piezoelectrically and electrically, in addition, it could generate electricity efficiently at a lower environmental vibration, and it can collect the energy in two vibration directions simultaneously. To verify the effectiveness of the device, we set up a vibration experiment system and conducted comparative experiments about non-magnetically coupled piezoelectric, magnetically coupled piezoelectric, and magnetically coupled piezoelectric-electromagnetic hybrid energy harvesters. The experimental results showed that the output power of the magnetically coupled piezoelectric-electromagnetic hybrid energy harvester was 2.13 mW for the piezoelectric structure and 1.76 mW for the electromagnetic structure under the vibration of single-direction resonant frequency. The total hybrid output power was 3.89 mW. The hybrid harvester could collect vibration energy parallel to the ring in any direction.

{"title": "PAC-UF Process Improving Surface Water Treatment: PAC Effects and Membrane Fouling Mechanism.", "abstract": "In this study, the water purification effect and membrane fouling mechanism of two powdered activated carbons (L carbon and S carbon) enhancing Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration (UF) membranes for surface water treatment were investigated. The results indicated that PAC could effectively enhance membrane filtration performance. With PAC addition, organic removal was greatly enhanced compared with direct UF filtration, especially for small molecules, i.e., the S-UF had an additional 25% removal ratio of micro-molecule organics than the direct UF. The S carbon with the larger particle size and lower specific surface area exhibited superior performance to control membrane fouling, with an operation duration of S-UF double than the direct UF. Therefore, the particle size and pore structure of carbon are the two key parameters that are essential during the PAC-UF process. After filtration, acid and alkaline cleaning of UF was conducted, and it was found that irreversible fouling contributed the most to total filtration resistance, while the unrecoverable irreversible resistance ratio with acid cleaning was greater than that with alkaline cleaning. With PAC, irreversible UF fouling could be relieved, and thus, the running time could be extended. In addition, the membrane foulant elution was analyzed, and it was found to be mainly composed of small and medium molecular organic substances, with 12% to 21% more polysaccharides than proteins. Finally, the hydrophilicity of the elution was examined, and it was observed that alkaline cleaning mainly eluted large, medium, and small molecules of hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic matter, while acid cleaning mainly eluted small molecules of hydrophilic organic matter.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-05-29", "authors": ["TianLi", "HongjianYu", "JingTian", "JunxiaLiu", "TonghaoYuan", "ShaozeXiao", "HuaqiangChu", "BingzhiDong"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12050487\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131561\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.128801\n10.1089/ees.2020.0525\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.179\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118469\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.118297\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2021.102374\n10.1016/j.watres.2016.04.045\n10.1021/acs.est.1c00435\n10.1007/s11783-020-1361-7\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.03.044\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.01.009\n10.1016/j.watres.2009.11.012\n10.1016/j.watres.2012.10.048\n10.1016/S0011-9164(02)00584-2\n10.1016/S0043-1354(01)00182-8\n10.2166/ws.2006.017\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.05.039\n10.1016/S0011-9164(01)00368-X\n10.1016/j.procbio.2014.06.024\n10.1016/j.watres.2004.10.012\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2014.04.003\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.01.003\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.06.089\n10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00317-8\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.12.009\n10.1016/j.cej.2015.08.093\n10.1016/j.desal.2011.01.051\n10.1016/0008-6223(90)90054-3\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.075\n10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.061\n10.1039/D0EW01093F\n10.1080/19443994.2015.1110727\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.035\n10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60923-6\n10.1016/j.desal.2005.10.030"}

{"title": "Development of Bionic Semicircular Canals and the Sensation of Angular Acceleration.", "abstract": "To study the sensing process of the human semicircular canals (HSCs) during head rotation, which is difficult to directly measure due to physiological reasons. A 1-BSC (one-dimensional bionic semicircular canal) and 3-BSC were prepared with soft SMPFs (symmetric electrode metal core polyvinylidene difluoride fibers), which could sense deformations similar to human sensory cells. Based on these models, experiments were carried out to study the principle of the HSCs. Deformations of the bionic ampulla (BA) depended on the angular acceleration.

However, caution must be exercised when analyzing and interpreting the data, as demonstrated in this paper, because sizeable photo-response observed in the PFM amplitude image of the sample is shown to be caused by the electrostatic interaction between the photo-induced surface charge and tip. Through photo-assisted Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), positive surface potential is found to be developed near the sample's surface under 405 nm light illumination, whose effects on the measured PFM signal is revealed by the comparative studies on its amplitude curves that are obtained using PFM spectroscopy mode with/without illumination.

{"title": "Exploring 3D elastic-wave scattering at interfaces using high-resolution phased-array system.", "abstract": "The elastic-wave scattering at interfaces, such as cracks, is essential for nondestructive inspections, and hence, understanding the phenomenon is crucial. However, the elastic-wave scattering at cracks is very complex in three dimensions since microscopic asperities of crack faces can be multiple scattering sources. We propose a method for exploring 3D elastic-wave scattering based on our previously developed high-resolution 3D phased-array system, the piezoelectric and laser ultrasonic system (PLUS). We describe the principle of PLUS, which combines a piezoelectric transmitter and a 2D mechanical scan of a laser Doppler vibrometer, enabling us to resolve a crack into a collection of scattring sources. Subsequently, we show how the 3D elastic-wave scattering in the vicinity of each response can be extracted. Here, we experimentally applied PLUS to a fatigue-crack specimen. We found that diverse 3D elastic-wave scattering occurred in a manner depending on the responses within the fatigue crack. This is significant because access to such information will be useful for optimizing inspection conditions, designing ultrasonic measurement systems, and characterizing cracks.

{"title": "X-ray nanoimaging of a transversely embedded carbon fiber in epoxy matrix under static and cyclic loads.", "abstract": "The initial stage of fatigue failure has not been thoroughly clarified for carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs). Although the initiation of fatigue cracks has been regarded to be interfacial debonding between the carbon fiber and polymer matrix, their detection among numerous carbon fibers, whose diameter is only 7\u00a0\u00b5m, is extremely difficult. In this study, a single carbon fiber was transversely embedded in a dumbbell-shaped epoxy sample to focus on the interfacial debonding and was observed using synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray computed tomography (CT). A tabletop fatigue testing machine driven by a piezoelectric actuator was developed to apply static and cyclic loads along the beamline. SR X-ray multiscale CT imaging was conducted by switching between an absorption-contrast projection method (micro-CT) and a phase-contrast imaging-type X-ray microscopic CT (nano-CT). The carbon fiber was entirely captured by micro-CT and then magnified at both ends on the free surfaces. Nano-CT clearly visualized the interfacial debonding under 30\u00a0MPa static tensile load and the implication of the coalescence of nano-voids along the interface under 50\u00a0MPa.

Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting.

{"title": "Electroactive Ultrafiltration Membrane for Simultaneous Removal of Antibiotic, Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, and Antibiotic Resistance Genes from Wastewater Effluent.", "abstract": "To combat the spread of antibiotic resistance into the environment, we should adequately manage wastewater effluent treatment to achieve simultaneous removal of antibiotics, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Herein, we fabricate a multifunctional electroactive poly(vinylidene fluoride) ultrafiltration membrane (C/PVDF) by phase inversion on conductive carbon cloth. The membrane possesses not only excellent retention toward ARB and ARGs but also exhibits high oxidation capacity as an electrode. Notably, sulfamethoxazole degradation involving hydroxylation and hydrolysis by the anode membrane is predominant, and the degradation efficiency is up to 81.5% at +4 V. Both electro-filtration processes exhibit significant ARB inactivation, anode filtration is superior to cathode filtration. Moreover, the degradation of intracellular ARGs (iARGs) located in the genome is more efficient than those located in the plasmid, and these degradation efficiencies at -2 V are higher than +2 V. The degradation efficiencies of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) are opposite and are lower than iARGs. Compared with regular filtration, the normalized flux of electroactive ultrafiltration membrane is improved by 18.0% at -2 V, 15.9% at +2 V, and 30.4% at +4 V during treating wastewater effluent, confirming its antifouling properties and feasibility for practical application.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2022-05-26", "authors": ["JiahuanLi", "ShaojieRen", "XiaoQiu", "ShanZhao", "RuiWang", "YunkunWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.2c00268"}

In China, over 90% of esophageal cancer patients are diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Currently, the survival and prognosis of ESCC patients are not satisfying because of insufficient early screening and lack of efficacious medication. Accumulating studies have suggested that antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) represent a promising antitumor strategy.\nHere, we carried out a specific membrane proteome screening with ESCC patients' samples using a high-throughput antibody microarray to uncover potential targets for ADC development. Candidates were validated with expression and cytotoxicity evaluation both in vitro and in vivo.\nOur data have shown that the Piezo-Type Mechanosensitive Ion Channel Component 1 (PIEZO1) is particularly overexpressed in human ESCC tumors and can be efficiently internalized when bound with its monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, the PIEZO1 antibody combined with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) can specifically kill PIEZO1 high-expressed ESCC tumor cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. More importantly, the Anti-PIEZO1-MMAE can significantly suppress tumor progression in ESCC xenograft tumor models without any obvious side effects.\nTaken together, our work demonstrates that PIEZO1 is a promising target to develop ADCs for human ESCC treatment, providing a new strategy for ESCC patients' personalized therapy.", "journal": "Cancer medicine", "date": "2022-05-25", "authors": ["XunQin", "ZhenNi", "JianjunJiang", "XiguangLiu", "XiaoyingDong", "MeiLi", "KaiMiao", "ShuanRao", "WenqingZhang", "KaicanCai"], "doi": "10.1002/cam4.4744"}

The mechanosensitive Piezo1 ion channel can sense the changes in mechanical stress and convert the mechanical signals into chemical signals. This study aims to investigate the effect of Piezo1 on the mechanical stress-induced IVDD and explore the possible mechanism.\nThe expression of Piezo1 and collagen II in immunohistochemical staining, cervical curvature, and the stiffness of nucleus pulpous (NP) were performed in normal and degenerated human intervertebral discs. In the experiment, high-intensity compression was applied to mimic the mechanical environment of IVDD. The cell viability, matrix macromolecules, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined to investigate the effect of Piezo1 on mechanical stress-treated NP cells. Additionally, autophagy condition of NP cells was detected within high-intensity compression and/or the inhibitor of Piezo1, GsMTx4.\nThe up-expression of Piezo1, down-expression of Col II, elevated stiffness of NP, and poor kyphosis were observed in degenerated human intervertebral discs.

However, GsMTx4 can partly attenuate these effects.\nPiezo1 upregulation under excessive mechanical stress promotes the apoptosis, senescence, and pro-inflammatory cytokines of NP and leads to the loss of extracellular matrix by mitochondrial dysfunction and the suppression of autophagy; on the other hand, the inhibition of Piezo1 can partly alleviate these effects.", "journal": "Arthritis research & therapy", "date": "2022-05-24", "authors": ["ShengShi", "Xing-JianKang", "ZhiZhou", "Zhi-MinHe", "ShuangZheng", "Shi-ShengHe"], "doi": "10.1186/s13075-022-02804-y\n10.1016/j.joca.2015.03.028\n10.1097/BRS.0000000000003291\n10.1186/s13075-020-02353-2\n10.1186/s13075-021-02686-6\n10.1186/s13075-021-02501-2\n10.1016/j.joca.2017.01.001\n10.1038/nature25743\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2016.10.003\n10.1111/1440-1681.12917\n10.7554/eLife.47454\n10.1038/s41467-019-14146-6\n10.1002/jbmr.4198\n10.1097/00007632-200109010-00011\n10.1016/j.spinee.2015.04.024\n10.1016/j.micron.2020.102824\n10.1016/j.spinee.2020.08.004\n10.1097/00007632-199905150-00013\n10.1186/s12967-020-02382-0\n10.1097/00007632-199904150-00005\n10.1016/S0268-0033(01)00006-7\n10.1007/s00586-016-4382-y\n10.1007/s00586-013-2855-9\n10.1038/nature21407\n10.1186/s12931-019-1083-1\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.163\n10.1002/jcb.27683\n10.1097/BRS.0000000000004203\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106681\n10.1074/jbc.RA119.009167\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00977\n10.1080/15548627.2020.1822097\n10.1016/j.joca.2013.10.002"}

{"title": "Round window stimulation with an interface coupler demonstrates proof of concept.", "abstract": "To mechanically stimulate the round window (RW) membrane, an actuator with an interface coupler (IC) has the potential to improve sound transmission to the cochlea as compared to the most used RW stimulation device implanted today. If a proof-of-concept IC prototype shows promise as compared the most common method for RW stimulation, there is potential that future design development of an IC will be worthwhile.\nA variety of hearing pathologies resulting in mixed and conductive hearing loss can be addressed by mechanically stimulating the RW to transmit sound to the cochlea. The most common method for RW stimulation is with the floating mass transducer (FMT, Med-El). However, the FMT suffers poor sound transmission and unreliable device positioning. The dynamic range and bandwidth of the FMT as a RW stimulator is limited because the entire FMT needs freedom to vibrate. Thus the FMT has difficulty overcoming its own inertia and it cannot be stabilized in a manner that may limit its motion. Here we test an idea of using a generic actuator that vibrates on one side while stationary and held stable on the other (unlike the FMT), and coupling the actuator vibration to the RW membrane with a proof-of-concept IC designed to safely transmit sound to the cochlea. We determine if this proof-of-concept IC can perform as well or better than the FMT in one specimen. If so, further developments of the IC would be worthwhile.\nRW sound transmission comparison was made between an ideally implanted FMT and a proof-of-concept IC prototype driven by a piezoelectric stack actuator with vibrating tip in a fresh human temporal bone. Velocities of stapes, FMT, and IC actuator were measured with laser Doppler vibrometry to determine bandwidth, linearity, and dynamic range of cochlear sound transmission.\nStimulation with proof-of-concept prototype of the IC provided increased sound transmission, more linear output for larger dynamic range, and wider frequency range as compared to the FMT. This experiment demonstrates the potential of the IC concept to improve performance, and that it merits further development. However, it was challenging to stabilize the coupling between an external actuator and the proof-of-concept IC prototype. Thus, although we were successful in showing that this IC concept has promise, major design improvements and developments are required in the future.\nWe demonstrated that the proof-of-concept IC prototype driven with a tip connected to a piezoelectric stack actuator can stimulate the RW membrane with improved acoustic performance as compared to the FMT in one specimen. This study demonstrated proof of concept: that the idea of an IC for sound transmission to the cochlea through the RW has potential, and that it would be worthwhile to pursue the IC idea with further developments. This idea has the potential to provide robust sound transmission to the cochlea via the RW while preventing possible trauma to the cochlea. We also learned that critical design improvements are necessary because coupling the generic external actuator to the IC was challenging. A possible future IC design is to integrate a piezoelectric actuator permanently to the IC, allowing only the soft balloon membrane of the IC to vibrate the RW while the rest of the exterior housing of the combined IC (with actuator) would not vibrate and would be stabilized in a fixed manner.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2022-05-24", "authors": ["Darcy LFrear", "Hideko HeidiNakajima"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2022.108512"}

The reactivity of catechol and amine groups in the formulation was measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy and observation of the change in colour of the coating solutions. Then, the deposition of catechol-amine coating solutions was applied onto the hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The formulation results show significant differences in alkaline conditions, revealing the role of catechol groups in the oxidation of polyphenolics. The reactions of quinone and amines to form crosslinks by Michael addition and Schiff base reactions were observed at different concentrations of each compound in coating solution.

Filtration efficiency (FE) of these materials against virus is critical in the assessment of their use in disease prevention. Due to the high cost and biosafety laboratory required for conducting research using actual virus samples, surrogates for virus are commonly used in the filtration test. Here, we explore the employment of polymersomes (polymeric vesicles) as a new type of surrogate. The polymersomes are hollow shell nanoparticles with amphiphilic bilayer membranes, which can be fabricated in nanosized, and possess similar size and structural features to virus. The performance of commercial KN95 mask and surgical mask with micro-sized fibers, and electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers were chosen to be evaluated.

{"title": "Physics of mechanotransduction by Piezo ion channels.", "abstract": "Piezo ion channels are sensors of mechanical forces and mediate a wide range of physiological mechanotransduction processes. More than a decade of intense research has elucidated much of the structural and mechanistic principles underlying Piezo gating and its roles in physiology, although wide gaps of knowledge continue to exist. Here, we review the forces and energies involved in mechanical activation of Piezo ion channels and their functional modulation by other chemical and physical stimuli including lipids, voltage, and temperature. We compare the three predominant mechanisms likely to explain Piezo activation-the force-from-lipids mechanism, the tether model, and the membrane footprint theory. Additional sections shine light on how Piezo ion channels may affect each other through spatial clustering and functional cooperativity, and how substantial functional heterogeneity of Piezo ion channels arises as a byproduct of the precise physical environment each channel experiences. Finally, our review concludes by pointing out major research questions and technological limitations that future research can address.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2022-05-21", "authors": ["MichaelYoung", "Amanda HLewis", "J\u00f6rgGrandl"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.202113044\n10.7554/eLife.65930\n10.1080/19336950.2017.1279370\n10.1016/j.str.2017.03.006\n10.1073/pnas.1219777110\n10.7554/eLife.16041\n10.1038/ncomms11984\n10.1080/19336950.2016.1224624\n10.1085/jgp.200910371\n10.1113/jphysiol.2010.199034\n10.1126/scisignal.2005667\n10.1038/s41467-019-12501-1\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.08.054\n10.1038/nature14013\n10.1073/pnas.1320768111\n10.1021/jp0620163\n10.1016/S0006-3495(04)74337-4\n10.1073/pnas.1708990114\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/ncomms8223\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.1038/ncomms10366\n10.1073/pnas.2104820118\n10.1016/j.bpj.2021.02.006\n10.1085/jgp.200609599\n10.1038/s41467-020-17538-1\n10.1021/jacs.1c03524\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c00599\n10.1073/pnas.1514138112\n10.1038/s42003-019-0514-3\n10.1073/pnas.2107095118\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00177\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.02.010\n10.1016/j.bpj.2016.11.013\n10.1126/sciadv.abl4411\n10.4161/chan.21064\n10.1529/biophysj.103.034322\n10.7554/eLife.33660\n10.7554/eLife.41968\n10.1016/j.str.2011.09.005\n10.7554/elife.65415\n10.1038/nrn2117\n10.1085/jgp.20028605\n10.1016/0896-6273(88)90139-0\n10.1038/emboj.2009.398\n10.1016/j.neulet.2014.05.055\n10.1038/s42003-020-01600-1\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-101011-155833\n10.1085/jgp.201912374\n10.1038/s41586-020-2933-1\n10.1016/s0304-4157(98)00017-3\n10.1016/j.ceb.2018.04.002\n10.1038/s41467-018-04405-3\n10.1016/j.ceca.2007.04.004\n10.1038/s41563-020-00896-y\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.079\n10.7554/eLife.12088\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.12.040\n10.7554/eLife.70988\n10.1016/bs.mie.2020.12.024\n10.1073/pnas.2101207118\n10.7554/eLife.01901\n10.1038/s41586-019-1499-2\n10.4161/chan.5.1.13906\n10.1007/s12551-018-0450-3\n10.1073/pnas.1103979108\n10.7554/eLife.15744\n10.1038/s41467-018-03502-7\n10.3389/fphys.2011.00025\n10.1529/biophysj.107.115691\n10.1038/ncomms1533\n10.1038/ncomms4520\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2017.12.020\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.1007/s00232-005-0834-8\n10.1085/jgp.201912515\n10.1038/s41467-020-16816-2\n10.1038/s41467-019-09055-7\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1073/pnas.1204700109\n10.1038/s41593-020-00751-y\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.054\n10.1038/s41598-019-42492-4\n10.1073/pnas.2006980118\n10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75169-2\n10.1038/35055559\n10.1085/jgp.113.4.525\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.033\n10.7554/eLife.07369\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.035\n10.1073/pnas.1905985116\n10.1101/2021.04.16.440217\n10.1038/s41467-018-04436-w\n10.1038/s41467-022-28974-6\n10.1038/nature02732\n10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110342\n10.1038/s41586-019-1505-8\n10.1038/s41467-018-03570-9\n10.7554/eLife.58388\n10.1038/ncomms12939\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.120\n10.1021/acsnano.8b00867\n10.1038/s41586-021-03196-w\n10.7554/eLife.44003\n10.1073/pnas.1910213116"}

{"title": "On 3D printed biomedical sensors for non-enzymatic glucose sensing applications.", "abstract": "Some studies have been reported in the recent past on smart sensors for non-enzymatic glucose sensing applications. Nevertheless, little has been reported on the in-house development of low-cost 3D printed smart biomedical sensors with tunable sensitivity. This study reports investigations on the in-house, low-cost fabrication of polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) matrix-based 3D printed tunable non-enzymatic glucose sensors. For fabrication of smart sensors, Cu (4%) doped ZnO nanoparticles have been reinforced (in different weight proportions (wt%) in PVDF matrix through melt processing. The results suggest that 4% reinforcement (of 4% Cu doped-ZnO), processed at 190\u00b0C, 40\u2009rpm screw speed on twin screw extrusion (TSE) followed by post heat treatment (HT) at 60\u00b0C are the best settings for fabrication of feedstock filaments (for bio-sensor 3D printing). Finally, a PVDF-based sensor to support bioreceptor and transducer requirements has been successfully prepared (with 4D properties (i.e. one-way programing feature), optical, morphological, bond strength, piezoelectric and mechanical characteristics).

{"title": "Static Electro-Mechanical Response of Axisymmetric One-Dimensional Piezoelectric Quasicrystal Circular Actuator.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric effect of piezoelectric quasicrystalline materials is coexcited by phonon and phason fields. Piezoelectric quasicrystalline materials have excellent properties of both piezoelectric materials and quasicrystalline materials, which are expected to be used as actuators in the fields of aerospace, automotive, and intelligent manufacturing. Based on the three-dimensional elastic theory of piezoelectric quasicrystals, the state space equation for axisymmetric piezoelectric quasicrystal circular plate actuators is derived by using the state space method. Afterwards, the finite Hankel transformation is performed on the state equation, and a system of ordinary differential equations and corresponding boundary conditions are obtained. Finally, the exact solution of axisymmetric bending of one-dimensional hexagonal piezoelectric quasicrystal circular actuators under generalized elastic simply supported boundary conditions is obtained by using the propagator matrix method. Numerical results are given to compare the degradation results in this paper with those in the literature, and present the influences of the thickness-to-span ratio and stacking sequence on the phonon, phason, and electric fields when the surface of the laminated circular actuators is subjected to mechanical load.

VCII is the dual circuit of a second-generation current conveyor (CCII), which provides the possibility of processing signals in the current domain while providing output signals in the voltage form. The scope of this paper is to discuss the benefits and opportunities of new VCII-based read-out circuits over traditional ones and bioelectrical signals. The achieved main benefits compared to conventional circuits are the simpler read-out circuits, producing an output signal in a voltage form that can be directly used, improved accuracy, possibility of gain adjustment using a single grounded resistor, and the possibility of connecting several SiPM sensors to the readout circuit. The circuits studied in this paper include VCII- based read-out circuits suitable for all types of sensors configured in the current-mode Wheatstone bridge (CMWB) topology, the VCII-based read-out circuits solutions reported for silicon photomultiplier, spiral-shaped ultrasonic PVDF and differential capacitive sensors, and, finally, a simple readout circuitry for sensing bioelectrical signals.

{"title": "A Wind Tunnel Study of the Flow-Induced Vibrations of a Cylindrical Piezoelectric Transducer.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric transducers are used as a sensing device to study the fluids' motion. Moreover, they are used as a harvester of energy of Flow-Induced Vibration (FIV). The current FIV harvesters in the literature rely on piezoelectric cantilevers coupled with a bluff body that creates flow instabilities. This paper studies the use of piezoelectric cylinders as a novel transducer in the field of fluid mechanics, where the transducer makes use of its bluff geometry to create instability.

{"title": "FPI Based Hyperspectral Imager for the Complex Surfaces-Calibration, Illumination and Applications.", "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) applications for biomedical imaging and dermatological applications have been recently under research interest. Medical HSI applications are non-invasive methods with high spatial and spectral resolution. HS imaging can be used to delineate malignant tumours, detect invasions, and classify lesion types. Typical challenges of these applications relate to complex skin surfaces, leaving some skin areas unreachable. In this study, we introduce a novel spectral imaging concept and conduct a clinical pre-test, the findings of which can be used to develop the concept towards a clinical application. The SICSURFIS spectral imager concept combines a piezo-actuated Fabry-P\u00e9rot interferometer (FPI) based hyperspectral imager, a specially designed LED module and several sizes of stray light protection cones for reaching and adapting to the complex skin surfaces. The imager is designed for the needs of photometric stereo imaging for providing the skin surface models (3D) for each captured wavelength. The captured HS images contained 33 selected wavelengths (ranging from 477 nm to 891 nm), which were captured simultaneously with accordingly selected LEDs and three specific angles of light. The pre-test results show that the data collected with the new SICSURFIS imager enable the use of the spectral and spatial domains with surface model information. The imager can reach complex skin surfaces. Healthy skin, basal cell carcinomas and intradermal nevi lesions were classified and delineated pixel-wise with promising results, but further studies are needed. The results were obtained with a convolutional neural network.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-05-21", "authors": ["Anna-MariaRaita-Hakola", "LeeviAnnala", "VivianLindholm", "RobertsTrops", "AnttiN\u00e4sil\u00e4", "HeikkiSaari", "AnnamariRanki", "IlkkaP\u00f6l\u00f6nen"], "doi": "10.3390/s22093420\n10.1109/TGRS.2005.846154\n10.1109/MGRS.2013.2244672\n10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3133021\n10.3390/cancers11060756\n10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101922\n10.3390/cancers13050967\n10.2340/00015555-2010\n10.1016/j.bspc.2014.10.010\n10.1111/jdv.15102\n10.1002/wics.1465\n10.4161/cbt.5.8.3261\n10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346777\n10.3390/jcm9061662\n10.1109/34.3909\n10.1007/s10812-007-0071-2\n10.3390/s21010252\n10.1111/j.1600-0846.2011.00571.x\n10.1109/ITW.2015.7133169\n10.1364/BOE.428143\n10.1364/BOE.10.003545\n10.1117/12.897712\n10.1137/080725891\n10.1145/2786984.2786995\n10.7717/peerj.453\n10.1038/s41592-019-0686-2\n10.2340/00015555-3755\n10.1109/LGRS.2005.857031\n10.1109/TGRS.2018.2815613\n10.1148/rg.2020200040\n10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2491921\n10.1016/j.patter.2021.100336"}

{"title": "A High-Performance Synthetic Jet Piezoelectric Air Pump with Petal-Shaped Channel.", "abstract": "The synthetic jet piezoelectric air pump is a potential miniature device for electronic cooling. In order to improve the performance of the device, a small-sized synthetic jet piezoelectric air pump is proposed in this work, which is mainly characterized by petal-shaped inlet channels. First, the structure and working principle of the piezoelectric vibrator and the proposed pump are analyzed. Then, three synthetic jet piezoelectric air pumps with different inlet channels are compared. These inlets are the direct channels, the diffuser/nozzle channels, and the petal-shaped channels, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of the synthetic jet piezoelectric air pump with the petal-shaped inlet channels is optimized by orthogonal tests. Finally, the simulation was used to investigate the heat dissipation capability of the synthetic jet piezoelectric pump. The experimental results show that among the three inlet channels, the petal-shaped channel can greatly improve the performance of the pump. The unoptimized pump with petal-shaped channels has a maximum flow rate of 1.8929 L/min at 100 V, 3.9 kHz. Additionally, the optimized pump with petal-shaped channels reaches a maximum flow rate of 3.0088 L/min at 100 V, 3.7 kHz, which is 58.95% higher than the unoptimized one. The proposed synthetic jet piezoelectric air pump greatly improves the output performance and has the advantages of simple structure, low cost, and easy integration. The convective heat transfer coefficient of the synthetic jet piezoelectric pump is 28.8 W/(m2\u00b7\u00b0C), which can prove that the device has a better heat dissipation capability.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-05-21", "authors": ["XingqiLi", "XiaopengLiu", "LuntaoDong", "XiaodongSun", "HuajieTang", "GuojunLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/s22093227\n10.3390/mi11020172\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.12.034\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107393\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.10.018\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.04.005\n10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2008.04.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.07.026\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.118484\n10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2021.106911\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.09.036\n10.1177/16878140211049139\n10.1115/1.4028342\n10.1007/s00542-019-04417-z\n10.1007/s00542-019-04743-2\n10.1109/TMECH.2019.2960332\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112296\n10.3390/s18051302\n10.1038/148606a0\n10.1063/1.866920\n10.1063/1.869828\n10.2514/1.12910"}
{"title": "In silico assessment of electrophysiological neuronal recordings mediated by magnetoelectric nanoparticles.", "abstract": "Magnetoelectric materials hold untapped potential to revolutionize biomedical technologies. Sensing of biophysical processes in the brain is a particularly attractive application, with the prospect of using magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs) as injectable agents for rapid brain-wide modulation and recording. Recent studies have demonstrated wireless brain stimulation in vivo using MENPs synthesized from cobalt ferrite (CFO) cores coated with piezoelectric barium titanate (BTO) shells. CFO-BTO core-shell MENPs have a relatively high magnetoelectric coefficient and have been proposed for direct magnetic particle imaging (MPI) of brain electrophysiology. However, the feasibility of acquiring such readouts has not been demonstrated or methodically quantified. Here we present the results of implementing a strain-based finite element magnetoelectric model of CFO-BTO core-shell MENPs and apply the model to quantify magnetization in response to neural electric fields. We use the model to determine optimal MENPs-mediated electrophysiological readouts both at the single neuron level and for MENPs diffusing in bulk neural tissue for in vivo scenarios.

In this research work, nanocomposite membranes of different blend ratios from PVDF and TPU have been synthesized. The PVDF is responsible for piezoelectric performance where it is one of the promising polymeric organic materials containing \u03b2-sheets, to convert applied mechanical stress into electric voltage. In addition, the TPU is widely used in the plastic industry due to its superior elasticity. Our work investigates the piezoresponse analysis for different blending ratios of PVDF/TPU. It has been found that TPU blending ratios of 15-17.5% give higher output voltage at different stresses conditions along with higher piezosensitivity.

The airbag system consists of a six-sided polygon inflatable airbag, a same shape plate, a stiff air supply tube, an air-supply pump and a digital pressure load cell monitor. Piezoelectric sensors were installed in the plate to detect compression pressure load changes; pressure load data were transferred to the digital pressure load cell monitor through Bluetooth. Five volunteers underwent cine-MRI with and without airbag compression to detect differences in the respiratory motion of the organs. The volunteers' physiologic signs were stable during the experiment. The maximum inspiration pressure load was 4.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.86\u00a0kgf (range, 4.00-6.00\u00a0kgf), while the minimum expiration pressure load was 3.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.95\u00a0kgf (range, 2.8-5.3\u00a0kgf).

However, the design and fabrication of high-quality and stable MOF-based mixed matrix membrane for pervaporation are still a big challenge. Herein, PDMS functionalized MOF-derived nanoporous carbon (P-ZNC) was first explored as compatible nanofiller to mutually blend with polydimethylsiloxane on PVDF substrate to fabricate defect-free mixed matrix membranes via dip-coating and thermal cross-linkng. Induced by UV illumination, hydrophobic modification of MOF-derived nanoporous carbon was successfully realized under mild conditions within one step, simplifying the operation step. By using this facile strategy, we can not only solve the existing problem of agglomeration, but also covalently cross-link MOF derivative with polymeric matrix and effectively eliminate the interface defect between polymer and nanoparticles without any extra steps. The method also gives a good level of generality for the synthesis of versatile stable nanoporous MOF-derived carbon-based mixed matrix membranes on various supports.

{"title": "Porosity Tunable Poly(Lactic Acid)-Based Composite Gel Polymer Electrolyte with High Electrolyte Uptake for Quasi-Solid-State Supercapacitors.", "abstract": "The growing popularity of quasi-solid-state supercapacitors inevitably leads to the unrestricted consumption of commonly used petroleum-derived polymer electrolytes, causing excessive carbon emissions and resulting in global warming. Also, the porosity and liquid electrolyte uptake of existing polymer membranes are insufficient for well-performed supercapacitors under high current and long cycles. To address these issues, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a widely applied polymers in biodegradable plastics is employed to fabricate a renewable biocomposite membrane with tunable pores with the help of non-solvent phase inversion method, and a small amount of poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) is introduced as a modifier to interconnect with PLA skeleton for stabilizing the porous structure and optimizing the aperture of the membrane. Owing to easy film-forming and tunable non-solvent ratio, the porous membrane possesses high porosity (ca. 71%), liquid electrolyte uptake (366%), and preferable flexibility endowing the GPE with satisfactory electrochemical stability in coin and flexible supercapacitors after long cycles.

{"title": "Silicalite-1/PDMS Hybrid Membranes on Porous PVDF Supports: Preparation, Structure and Pervaporation Separation of Dichlorobenzene Isomers.", "abstract": "Separation of dichlorobenzene (DCB) isomers with high purity by time\u2212 and energy\u2212saving methods from their mixtures is still a great challenge in the fine chemical industry. Herein, silicalite-1 zeolites/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) hybrid membranes (silicalite-1/PDMS) have been successfully fabricated on the porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) supports to first investigate the pervaporation separation properties of DCB isomers. The morphology and structure of the silicalite-1 zeolites and the silicalite-1/PDMS/PVDF hybrid membranes were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and BET. The results showed that the active silicalite-1/PDMS layers were dense and continuous without any longitudinal cracks and other defects with the silicalite-1 zeolites content no more than 10%. When the silicalite-1 zeolites content exceeded 10%, the surfaces of the active silicalite-1/PDMS layers became rougher, and silicalite-1 zeolites aggregated to form pile pores. The pervaporation experiments both in single-isomer and binary\u2212isomer systems for the separation of DCB isomers was further carried out at 60 \u00b0C. The results showed that the silicalite-1/PDMS/PVDF hybrid membranes with 10% silicalite-1 zeolites content had better DCB selective separation performance than the silicalite-1/\u03b1\u2212Al2O3 membranes prepared by template method. The permeate fluxes of the DCB isomers increased in the order of m\u2212DCB < o\u2212DCB < p\u2212DCB both in single-isomer and binary-isomers solutions for the silicalite-1/PDMS/PVDF hybrid membranes. The separation factor of the silicalite-1/PDMS/PVDF hybrid membranes for p/o\u2212DCB was 2.9 and for p/m\u2212DCB was 4.6 in binary system. The permeate fluxes of the silicalite-1/PDMS/PVDF hybrid membranes for p\u2212DCB in p/o\u2212DCB and p/m\u2212DCB binary\u2212isomers solutions were 126.2 g\u2219m\u22122\u2219h\u22121 and 104.3 g\u2219m\u22122\u2219h\u22121, respectively. The thickness\u2212normalized pervaporation separation index in p/o\u2212DCB binary\u2212isomers solutions was 4.20 \u03bcm\u2219kg\u2219m\u22122\u2219h\u22121 and in p/m\u2212DCB binary\u2212isomers solutions was 6.57 \u03bcm\u2219kg\u2219m\u22122\u2219h\u22121.

Using a finite element method, we carry out a physical investigation of the mechanisms of the impact of distributed deformations on the magnetic properties of YIG film. Micromagnetic simulations and finite-element modelling can explain the evolution of spin-wave interference patterns under strain induced via the application of an electric field to PP electrodes.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Property of Electrospun PVDF Nanofibers as Linking Tips of Artificial-Hair-Cell Structures in Cochlea.", "abstract": "The death of hair cells and damage of natural tip links is one of the main causes of hearing-loss disability, and the development of an advanced artificial hearing aid holds the key to assisting those suffering from hearing loss. This study demonstrates the potential of using electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers to serve as the artificial tip links, for long-term hearing-aid-device development based on their piezoelectric properties. We have shown that the electrospun PVDF-fiber web, consisting of fibers ranging from 30-220 nm in diameter with high \u03b2-phase content, possesses the high piezoresponse of 170 mV. Analyses based on combined characterization methods including SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman, DSC, XPS, PFM and piezoelectricity have confirmed that an optimized value of 15 wt.% PVDF could act as an effective candidate for a tip-link connector in a vibration-frequency prototype. Based on this easily reproducible electrospinning technique and the multifunctionalities of the resulting PVDF fibers, this fundamental study may shed light on the bio-inspired design of artificial, self-powered, high performance, hair-cell-like sensors in cochlea to tackle the hearing loss issue.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-05-15", "authors": ["RanaSabouni Tabari", "YuChen", "KunyapatThummavichai", "YanZhang", "ZakariaSaadi", "Ana I SNeves", "YongdeXia", "YanqiuZhu"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12091466\n10.2471/BLT.21.285643\n10.1038/nature06091\n10.3389/fncel.2018.00100\n10.1002/adma.200701709\n10.1039/c0ee00137f\n10.3390/s20164483\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.918749\n10.1109/dMEMS.2012.10\n10.1073/pnas.1110036108\n10.1063/1.4994968\n10.3390/s140305296\n10.1155/2015/140716\n10.1063/1.361055\n10.1021/cm960166s\n10.1016/0376-7388(96)00088-9\n10.3390/s20102925\n10.1002/adhm.201700674\n10.1063/1.4980130\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/4/045009\n10.3390/polym9020033\n10.1088/0022-3727/44/46/464003\n10.1109/ise.1996.578073\n10.1016/S0014-3057(98)00136-0\n10.1016/S0376-7388(02)00407-6\n10.1021/jp204513w\n10.1002/app.23137\n10.1016/0254-0584(95)01617-4\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1238723\n10.1016/0261-3069(84)90003-7\n10.1039/C5RA21903E\n10.1088/2043-6262/1/4/043002\n10.3390/polym10030228\n10.1063/1.2812702\n10.1007/s10853-007-1787-3\n10.1002/adfm.201804121\n10.3144/expresspolymlett.2009.11\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.07.149\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.089\n10.1039/x0xx00000x\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.11.072\n10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.017\n10.1242/jeb.094599\n10.1186/2228-5547-3-2\n10.3390/polym13040662\n10.1002/polb.20737\n10.1007/s40204-017-0071-0\n10.1016/j.cej.2016.08.125\n10.1023/A:1004689205706"}

{"title": "Experimental research on surface acoustic wave microfluidic atomization for drug delivery.", "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that surface acoustic wave (SAW) atomization can produce suitable aerosol concentration and size distribution for efficient inhaled lung drug delivery and is a potential atomization device for asthma treatment. Using the SAW device, we present comprehensive experimental results exploring the complexity of the acoustic atomization process and the influence of input power, device frequency, and liquid flow rate on aerosol size distribution. It is hoped that these studies will explain the mechanism of SAW atomization aerosol generation and how they can be controlled. The insights from the high-speed flow visualization studies reveal that it is possible by setting the input power above 4.17\u00a0W, thus allowing atomization to occur from a relatively thin film, forming dense, monodisperse aerosols. Moreover, we found that the aerosol droplet size can be effectively changed by adjusting the input power and liquid flow rate to change the film conditions. In this work, we proposed a method to realize drug atomization by a microfluidic channel. A SU-8 flow channel was prepared on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate by photolithography technology. Combined with the silicon dioxide coating process and PDMS process closed microfluidic channel was prepared, and continuous drug atomization was provided to improve the deposition efficiency of drug atomization by microfluidic.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-05-14", "authors": ["Qing-YunHuang", "YingLe", "HongHu", "Zhi-JianWan", "JiaNing", "Jun-LongHan"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-11132-9\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119196\n10.1080/17425247.2017.1252329\n10.1378/chest.96.6.1241\n10.1039/C5IB00206K\n10.1038/mt.2012.37\n10.1016/S0169-409X(03)00077-2\n10.1183/09031936.97.10020292\n10.1016/S0954-6111(97)90100-1\n10.1016/j.addr.2006.07.009\n10.1039/b903575c\n10.1007/s00348-002-0456-1\n10.1517/17425247.3.5.693\n10.1517/17425247.2010.485608\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2010.05.013\n10.2174/156720108783954815\n10.35848/1347-4065/ab8d4d\n10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104221\n10.1063/1.2953537\n10.1039/B915833B\n10.3390/mi10110794\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112731\n10.1088/1367-2630/13/2/023005\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.11.027\n10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2020.110257\n10.1364/OE.21.030148\n10.1063/1.4953548\n10.1186/1465-9921-15-60\n10.1063/1.3055282\n10.1021/ac100372c\n10.1016/j.jaerosci.2014.10.004\n10.1103/PhysRevE.86.056312\n10.1038/s41598-019-42599-8\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.14.014071\n10.4236/oja.2016.63003\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.01.001\n10.1016/S0041-624X(01)00054-3\n10.1039/C5LC00756A\n10.1007/s10544-017-0152-9\n10.1007/s00542-016-2880-9\n10.1021/la304608a\n10.1143/JJAP.43.2987\n10.1016/S0169-409X(03)00083-8"}

Improper sampling leads to erroneous results and, consequently, e.g. increased uncertainty in models of geochemical processes (scaling, corrosion) in geothermal installations, aquifer geothermometry, or environmental assessments. The impact of the applied filters (nylon, PVDF, MCE), containers (HDPE, borosilicate glass) and preservation on concentration of 34 major, minor and trace elements was studied for the samples of two geothermal waters used in practice. The results of replicated chemical analyses in duplicated samples of geothermal waters and deionized water blanks were subjected to statistical analyses, including nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, Wald-Wolfowitz). The PVC housing of the used MCE syringe filters contaminates water samples with Sb. Borosilicate glass increases Al, Cu, Pb and Se concentrations in samples. Acidification protects against changes in concentrations of numerous elements (i.a. Al, B, Ba, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb) in the solution.

Quantification of IgY is therefore becoming a topic of interest. Here, we demonstrate a piezoelectric biosensor with carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) as the immobilization matrix. Gelation and hydrophilic nature of CMCS are favored to form a crosslinked matrix for antibody immobilization, and a comparison was made between carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and CMCS to investigate the benefits of such substitution. Calibration from 500\u00a0ng/mL to 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL was established in buffer with the detection limit (LOD) down to 270\u00a0ng/mL, confirming its feasibility. As-prepared biosensor effectively prevents non-specific binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme. Each real-time assay took 15\u00a0min including sensor regeneration, which can be further reduced to 4\u00a0min for signal readout only, ready for both repeated measurements after regeneration and disposable devices.

{"title": "Virtual Sensor Array Based on Piezoelectric Cantilever Resonator for Identification of Volatile Organic Compounds.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric cantilever resonator is one of the most promising platforms for real-time sensing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, it has been a great challenge to eliminate the cross-sensitivity of various VOCs for these cantilever-based VOC sensors. Herein, a virtual sensor array (VSA) is proposed on the basis of a sensing layer of GO film deposited onto an AlN piezoelectric cantilever with five groups of top electrodes for identification of various VOCs. Different groups of top electrodes are applied to obtain high amplitudes of multiple resonance peaks for the cantilever, thus achieving low limits of detection (LODs) to VOCs. Frequency shifts of multiple resonant modes and changes of impedance values are taken as the responses of the proposed VSA to VOCs, and these multidimensional responses generate a unique fingerprint for each VOC. On the basis of machine learning algorithms, the proposed VSA can accurately identify different types of VOCs and mixtures with accuracies of 95.8 and 87.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the VSA has successfully been applied to identify the emissions from healthy plants and \"plants with late blight\" with an accuracy of 89%. The high levels of identifications show great potentials of the VSA for diagnosis of infectious plant diseases by detecting VOC biomarkers.", "journal": "ACS sensors", "date": "2022-05-14", "authors": ["DongshengLi", "BoyiZhu", "KaiPang", "QianZhang", "MengjiaoQu", "WeitingLiu", "YongQingFu", "JinXie"], "doi": "10.1021/acssensors.2c00442"}

{"title": "Profile of dorsal root ganglion neurons: study of oxytocin expression.", "abstract": "Although dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons have been so far classified according to the difference in their fibers (A\u03b2, A\u03b4, and C), this classification should be further subdivided according to gene expression patterns. We focused on oxytocin (OXT) and its related receptors, because OXT plays a local role in DRG neurons. We measured the mRNA levels of OXT, OXT receptor (OXTR), vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), and piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (Piezo2) in single DRG neurons by using real-time PCR, and then performed a cluster analysis. According to the gene expression patterns, DRG neurons were classified into 4 clusters: Cluster 1 was characterized mainly by Piezo2, Cluster 2 by TRPV1, Cluster 4 by OXTR, and neurons in Cluster 3 did not express any of the target genes. The cell body diameter of OXT-expressing neurons was significantly larger in Cluster 1 than in Cluster 2. These results suggest that OXT-expressing DRG neurons with small cell bodies (Cluster 2) and large cell bodies (Cluster 1) probably correspond to C-fiber neurons and A\u03b2-fiber neurons, respectively. Furthermore, the OXT-expressing neurons contained not only TRPV1 but also Piezo2, suggesting that OXT may be released by mechanical stimulation regardless of nociception. Thus, mechanoreception and nociception themselves may induce the autocrine/paracrine function of OXT in the DRG, contributing to alleviation of pain.", "journal": "Molecular brain", "date": "2022-05-10", "authors": ["TaiseiNoguri", "DaiHatakeyama", "TakashiKitahashi", "KotaroOka", "EtsuroIto"], "doi": "10.1186/s13041-022-00927-6\n10.1016/j.neuron.2021.09.004\n10.1016/j.jpain.2021.07.008\n10.12659/MSM.890707\n10.1155/2018/1260285\n10.2142/biophysico.16.0_132\n10.1111/bph.12635\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.12.058\n10.1038/s41598-018-31361-1\n10.4196/kjpp.2018.22.2.173\n10.1038/cr.2015.149\n10.1016/s0028-3908(02)00127-2\n10.1016/j.npep.2012.09.008\n10.2142/biophysics.11.33\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.063\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107912\n10.1086/282436\n10.1007/s00285-012-0589-7\n10.1002/kjm2.12044\n10.1101/cshperspect.a013656\n10.1126/science.1254229\n10.1126/science.150.3699.971\n10.1016/j.pain.2013.12.010\n10.1186/1744-8069-4-19\n10.1016/j.brainres.2008.10.030\n10.3389/fncel.2011.00003\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1594-10.2010\n10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.001\n10.2142/biophysico.bppb-v19.0014\n10.3389/fnana.2014.00021"}

{"title": "Vector of motion measurements in the living cochlea using a 3D OCT vibrometry system.", "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become an important tool for measuring the vibratory response of the living cochlea. It stands alone in its capacity to measure the intricate motion of the hearing organ through the surrounding otic capsule bone. Nevertheless, as an extension of phase-sensitive OCT, it is only capable of measuring motion along the optical axis. Hence, measurements are 1-D. To overcome this limitation and provide a measure of the 3-D vector of motion in the cochlea, we developed an OCT system with three sample arms in a single interferometer. Taking advantage of the long coherence length of our swept laser, we depth (frequency) encode the three channels. An algorithm to depth decode and coregister the three channels is followed by a coordinate transformation that takes the vibrational data from the experimental coordinate system to Cartesian or spherical polar coordinates. The system was validated using a piezo as a known vibrating element that could be positioned at various angles. The angular measurement on the piezo was shown to have an RMSE of\u2009\u2264\u20090.30\u00b0 (5.2 mrad) with a standard deviation of the amplitude of\u2009\u2264\u2009120 pm.

{"title": "Effect of the area of a lithium niobate transducer on the efficiency of ultrasonic atomization driven by resonance vibration.", "abstract": "In recent years, individual control of one's personal environment has been drawing increasing attention due to the growing interest in health care. Wearable devices are especially useful because of their controllability regardless of location. Humidity is one of the inevitable factors in the personal environment as a preventive against infectious diseases. Although atomization devices are commonly used as a method of humidity control, at present, there are no wearable humidity control devices. Vibration of a lithium niobate (LN) device in the thickness mode is a promising piezoelectric method for miniaturization of atomization devices for humidity control. To miniaturize the atomization device, the transducer size needs to be small not so much as to decrease the atomization efficiency. However, the effect of the device area on the atomization efficiency of LN at a size suitable for mounting in wearable devices has not been studied. Here, we conducted an atomization demonstration of LN devices with different sizes to evaluate particle size and atomization efficiency. Furthermore, to reveal the relationship between vibration behavior and atomization efficiency, resonance vibration in the MHz frequency band was evaluated by the finite element method and an impedance analyzer. The results showed that the peak size of water particles atomized by each device was in the range of 3.2 to 4.2\u00a0\u00b5m, which is smaller than particles produced by typical piezoelectric ceramics. Moreover, the best LN size for efficient atomization was found to be 8\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0mm among the five LN device sizes used in experiments. From the relationship between vibration behavior and atomization efficiency, the size of the transducer was suggested to affect the vibration mode.

{"title": "Identification of a coherent twin relationship from high-resolution reciprocal-space maps.", "abstract": "Twinning is a common crystallographic phenomenon which is related to the formation and coexistence of several orientation variants of the same crystal structure. It may occur during symmetry-lowering phase transitions or during the crystal growth itself. Once formed, twin domains play an important role in defining physical properties: for example, they underpin the giant piezoelectric effect in ferroelectrics, superelasticity in ferroelastics and the shape-memory effect in martensitic alloys. Regrettably, there is still a lack of experimental methods for the characterization of twin domain patterns. Here, a theoretical framework and algorithm are presented for the recognition of ferroelastic domains, as well as the identification of the coherent twin relationship using high-resolution reciprocal-space mapping of X-ray diffraction intensity around split Bragg peaks. Specifically, the geometrical theory of twinned ferroelastic crystals [Fousek & Janovec (1969). J. Appl. Phys. 40, 135-142] is adapted for the analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns. The necessary equations are derived and an algorithm is outlined for the calculation of the separation between the Bragg peaks, diffracted from possible coherent twin domains, connected to one another via a mismatch-free interface. It is demonstrated that such separation is always perpendicular to the planar interface between mechanically matched domains. For illustration purposes, the analysis is presented of the separation between the peaks diffracted from tetragonal and rhombohedral domains in the high-resolution reciprocal-space maps of BaTiO", "journal": "Acta crystallographica.

{"title": "Damage identification using wave damage interaction coefficients predicted by deep neural networks.", "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for efficiency and cost improvements in lightweight structures with guaranteed safety and reliability is leading to the application of a damage-tolerant design philosophy. Here, accurate knowledge of structural health is critical to avoid catastrophic failures. This knowledge can be obtained by using advanced structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. For thin-walled lightweight structures, methods utilizing guided waves generated by piezoelectric transducers are well suited. The interaction between the guided waves and potential damages can be described by so-called wave damage interaction coefficients (WDICs). These WDICs are unique for each damage and depend solely on its characteristics for a given structure. Therefore, the comparison of known WDICs with estimated ones allows drawing conclusions about the current structural state. In this paper, a novel damage identification method for plate-like structures based on a database of such WDICs is presented. Selected damages are simulated numerically with finite elements to generate WDIC patterns. However, these simulations are computationally highly demanding, thus only a very limited number of damage scenarios can be simulated. This study proposes an innovative technique to substantially enhance the resulting WDIC database by using deep neural networks (DNNs). These DNNs enable smart interpolations and allow not only predicting WDICs for previously unseen damages at low computational costs but also the discovery of knowledge about the complex relationship between damage features and WDIC patterns. A comparison to other machine learning algorithms clearly shows the superior performance of the utilized DNNs for interpolating complex WDIC patterns. The proposed damage identification method is verified using advanced time-domain simulations of a large aluminum plate. A statistical analysis of correct identification rates in a common three-sensor setting is employed for assessing the general performance. It is demonstrated that carefully identified DNNs enable to accurately replicate and interpolate complex WDIC patterns. Furthermore, it is shown that these predicted WDICs allow identifying damage characteristics with high confidence.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-05-03", "authors": ["ChristophHumer", "SimonH\u00f6ll", "ChristophKralovec", "MartinSchagerl"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106743"}
{"title": "Generation of Piezo1-CreER transgenic mice for visualization and lineage tracing of mechanical force responsive cells in vivo.", "abstract": "Cells and tissues are exposed to a wide range of mechanical stimuli during development, tissue homeostasis, repair, and regeneration. Over the past few decades, mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), as force-sensing integral membrane proteins, have attracted great attention with regard to their structural dynamics and mechanics at the molecular level and functions in various cells. Piezo-type MSC component 1 (Piezo1) is a newly discovered MSC; it is inherently mechanosensitive. However, which type of cells express Piezo1 in vivo remains unclear. To detect and trace Piezo1-expressing cells, we generated and characterized a novel tamoxifen-inducible Cre knock-in mouse line, Piezo1-CreER, which expresses CreER recombinase under the control of the endogenous Piezo1 promoter. Using this genetic tool, we detected the expression of Piezo1 in various cell types at the embryonic, neonatal, and adult stages. Our data showed that Piezo1 was highly expressed in endothelial cells in all the three stages, while the Piezo1 expression in epithelial cells was dynamic during development and growth. In summary, we established a new genetic tool, Piezo1-CreER, to study Piezo1-expressing cells in vivo during development, injury response, and tissue repair and regeneration.", "journal": "Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)", "date": "2022-05-03", "authors": ["XufengLi", "ZhenqianZhang", "MaoyingHan", "YangLi", "LingjuanHe", "BinZhou"], "doi": "10.1002/dvg.23476"}
{"title": "Tribo-Piezoelectricity in Group III Nitride Bilayers: A Density Functional Theory Investigation.", "abstract": "The notable out-of-plane piezoelectric effect caused by the large electronegativity of the constituent elements makes two-dimensional (2D) group III nitrides appealing for nanoscale energy-harvesting applications. Here, we demonstrate by extensive density functional theory investigations that the vertical piezoelectricity is enhanced significantly in 2D XN (X = B, Al, Ga) bilayers due to in-plane interlayer sliding. The sliding operation generates tribological energy from the vertical resistance force between the monolayers. A maximum shear strength between the monolayers of 1-25 GPa is recorded during vertical sliding. We elucidate the tribo-piezoelectricity generation mechanism of XN bilayers using the tribological energy conversion to overcome the interfacial sliding barrier. The strongest out-of-plane piezoelectricity is found when the bilayers are in the A-A stacking arrangement. Any reduction in the interlayer distance between group III nitride bilayers enhances out-of-plane polarization due to the increase in sliding energy resistances, leading to an increased inductive voltage output. An induced voltage of \u223c3.5 V is achieved during vertical compressive sliding of the upper layer. Using these phenomena, we present a compression-slide XN bilayer nanogenerator strategy capable of tuning the produced tribo-piezoelectric energy through sliding and compression.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-05-03", "authors": ["Md YasirZamil", "Md SherajulIslam", "CatherineStampfl", "JeongwonPark"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c00855"}
{"title": "Optimizing graphene oxide membranes for effective removal of dyes by modulating the reduction degree and doped nitrogen.", "abstract": "The excellent mechanical and chemical characteristics of graphene oxide (GO) enable their potential application in the realm of membrane separation. However, the expansion and instability of GO nanosheets in water limit its application. In this work, nitrogen-doped GO (NGO) was obtained by a harmless hydrothermal reduction method. The obtained NGO films were attached to a polyvinylidene fluoride support membrane by vacuum filtration. By changing the hydrothermal reaction temperature, the reduction degree of GO and doping amount of nitrogen was adjusted to control the inter-layer structure and permeability of NGO. The defect of NGO nanosheets and the reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups could accelerate the transportation of water molecules through the inter-layer space of the hydrophobic graphene sheets. Significantly, the polarization and high adsorption energy of pyridine-N serve as a supplement to the exclusion mechanism of the inter-layer spacing. NGO membranes have better permeability than the initial GO membranes without sacrificing the rejection rate. The optimized NGO film has a significant rejection rate of above 99% for various dyes, such as methylene blue, Congo red and methyl blue.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2022-05-03", "authors": ["JinBai", "JianrenHuang", "QiruiWu", "LunhuiGuan"], "doi": "10.1039/d2ra00725h\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.11.041\n10.1002/anie.201600438\n10.1002/adfm.202006949\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.03.070\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.12.046\n10.1039/C3CC46136J\n10.1126/science.1254227\n10.1039/C8TA03701A\n10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.005\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.12.063\n10.1016/j.memsci.2021.119192\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c00176\n10.1002/adma.201001068\n10.1021/nn700349a\n10.1002/adfm.201202601\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00148\n10.1126/science.1245711\n10.1002/elps.201800529\n10.1021/acs.est.9b01914\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118635\n10.1126/science.1250247\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.085\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116730\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b01904\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.10.039\n10.1016/j.electacta.2016.10.115\n10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.059\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.02.091\n10.1007/s12274-014-0408-0\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.031\n10.1021/nl0808684\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.03.024\n10.1021/am403427h\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.051\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.12.018\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b02831\n10.1126/science.1211694\n10.1016/j.scib.2018.05.015\n10.1126/science.1212101\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.12.018\n10.1021/acs.est.5b02086\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.09.043\n10.1039/C3CC41953C\n10.1039/C9RA04729H"}
{"title": "Recent Trends and Practices Toward Assessment and Rehabilitation of Neurodegenerative Disorders: Insights From Human Gait.", "abstract": "The study of human movement and biomechanics forms an integral part of various clinical assessments and provides valuable information toward diagnosing neurodegenerative disorders where the motor symptoms predominate. Conventional gait and postural balance analysis techniques like force platforms, motion cameras, etc., are complex, expensive equipment requiring specialist operators, thereby posing a significant challenge toward translation to the clinics. The current manuscript presents an overview and relevant literature summarizing the umbrella of factors associated with neurodegenerative disorder management: from the pathogenesis and motor symptoms of commonly occurring disorders to current alternate practices toward its quantification and mitigation. This article reviews recent advances in technologies and methodologies for managing important neurodegenerative gait and balance disorders, emphasizing assessment and rehabilitation/assistance. The review predominantly focuses on the application of inertial sensors toward various facets of gait analysis, including event detection, spatiotemporal gait parameter measurement, estimation of joint kinematics, and postural balance analysis. In addition, the use of other sensing principles such as foot-force interaction measurement, electromyography techniques, electrogoniometers, force-myography, ultrasonic, piezoelectric, and microphone sensors has also been explored. The review also examined the commercially available wearable gait analysis systems. Additionally, a summary of recent progress in therapeutic approaches, viz., wearables, virtual reality (VR), and phytochemical compounds, has also been presented, explicitly targeting the neuro-motor and functional impairments associated with these disorders. Efforts toward therapeutic and functional rehabilitation through VR, wearables, and different phytochemical compounds are presented using recent examples of research across the commonly occurring neurodegenerative conditions [viz., Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Studies exploring the potential role of Phyto compounds in mitigating commonly associated neurodegenerative pathologies such as mitochondrial dysfunction, \u03b1-synuclein accumulation, imbalance of free radicals, etc., are also discussed in breadth. Parameters such as joint angles, plantar pressure, and muscle force can be measured using portable and wearable sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, footswitches, force sensors, etc. Kinetic foot insoles and inertial measurement tools are widely explored for studying kinematic and kinetic parameters associated with gait. With advanced correlation algorithms and extensive RCTs, such measurement techniques can be an effective clinical and home-based monitoring and rehabilitation tool for neuro-impaired gait. As evident from the present literature, although the vast majority of works reported are not clinically and extensively validated to derive a firm conclusion about the effectiveness of such

{"title": "Covalent organic framework membrane on electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride substrate with a hydrophilic intermediate layer.", "abstract": "Generally, electrospun membranes have high mechanical strength, high porosity and low permeation resistance. Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted great interest as advanced membrane materials, few works disclosed that the COFs composite membranes were synthesized on electrospun substrates. In this work, the electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes were used as substrates for the preparation of COF composite membranes with graphene oxide and oxidized carbon nanotubes (GO-OCNTs) as an intermediate layer. The COF/GO-OCNTs/PVDF composite membranes were prepared by suction filtering the GO-OCNTs intermediate layer on the electrospun substrate, and then interfacial polymerization of COF layer. After adding the intermediate layer, the water permeance and dye retention rate of the composite COF membrane are both improved. By exploring the reaction parameters in the interfacial polymerization process, the optimized membrane shows that the rejection rate of Coomassle brilliant blue G250 (BBG-250) is about 97.1%, and the water permeability achieves 96.7\u00a0L\u00a0m", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2022-05-02", "authors": ["MingQian", "XiYan", "YanChen", "Xiao-JingGuo", "Wan-ZhongLang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.049"}
{"title": "A planar piezoelectric motor of two dimensional XY motions driven by one cross-shaped piezoelectric unit: A new principle.", "abstract": "We present a two-degree-of-freedom piezoelectric motor, which is driven by a simple cross-shaped piezo unit. Here, not only the structure of high novelty and simplicity but also the working principle is new. The cross-shaped piezo unit is sandwiched between top and bottom guiding plates with roughly equal pressing forces applied between the four free ends of the piezo unit and the plates. The working principle is as follows: A pair of opposite arms of the piezo unit quickly and simultaneously expand and contract periodically in the X direction, which results in a vanishing total friction force in the X direction; meanwhile, the other two arms in the Y direction deform slowly in a push-pull manner, which will move the aforementioned X-direction arms a step in the Y direction; then, the Y direction piezo arms restore their initial states slowly one by one. Repeating these actions will produce continuous stepping in the Y direction. Because the structure is symmetric in X and Y directions, we can similarly produce stepping in the X direction. The advantages are obvious: compact, rigid, and planar, which are all important for high stability and, hence, crucial in building an atomically resolved scanning probe microscope.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2022-05-01", "authors": ["ShaofengZheng", "JihaoWang", "WenjieMeng", "JingZhang", "QiyuanFeng", "ZeWang", "YubinHou", "QingyouLu", "YalinLu"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0080598"}

In this work, first-principles calculations are performed to investigate the strain tunability of thermal transport in \u03b2-phase PVDF. Thermal conductivity of single-chain PVDF is found to decrease significantly as the tensile strain increases. Moreover, detailed spectral phonon analysis shows that the dominant phonon branch, which contributes most to the overall thermal conductivity, transits from the longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch to transverse acoustic (TA) branches as the tensile strain increases to 5%. This transition is attributed to the strain-induced flattening of the LA branch. We also find that, upon further stretching of the PVDF chain to 15%, its thermal conductivity decreases monotonically due to increased anharmonic scattering of TA modes.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2022-04-30", "authors": ["TengfeiMa", "YanWang"], "doi": "10.1039/d1cp05865g"}
{"title": "3D Conformal Fabrication of Piezoceramic Films.", "abstract": "Piezoceramic films are an essential class of energy-conversion materials that have been widely used in the electronics industry. Although current methods create a great freedom for fabricating high-quality piezoceramic films, it requires well-controlled synthesis conditions, including special high-cost equipment and planar substrates particularly. The limited substrate selections hinder the applications of piezoceramic films in 3D conformal structures where most objects possess complex curvilinear surfaces. To overcome such limitations, a fast, energy-efficient, and cost-effective approach, named flame treated spray (FTS) coating, is developed for preparing piezoceramic films on free-form surfaces. The flame treatment significantly enhances the hydrophilicity of a substrate, assisting in forming a uniform and continuous thin film. The followed spray coating deposits hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers thick films on 3D free-form surfaces. Given the size controllability and arbitrary surface compatibility of the FTS method, a highly conformal piezoelectric tactile sensor array (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04) is assembled on a spherical surface for mimicking robot fingers and an on-site thin-film sensor on the wing of an aircraft model to monitor the vibration in real-time during flight. The FTS film deposition offers a highly promising methodology for the application of functional thin-film from micro- to marcoscale devices, regardless of conformal problems.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2022-04-30", "authors": ["ShiyuanLiu", "YaoShan", "YingHong", "YuankaiJin", "WeikangLin", "ZhuominZhang", "XiaoteXu", "ZuankaiWang", "ZhengbaoYang"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202106030"}
{"title": "Matrix stiffness regulates macrophage polarization in atherosclerosis.", "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and the pathological basis of many fatal cardiovascular diseases. Macrophages, the main inflammatory cells in atherosclerotic plaque, have a paradox role in disease progression. In response to different microenvironments, macrophages mainly have two polarized directions: pro-inflammatory macrophages and anti-inflammatory macrophages. More and more evidence shows that macrophage is mechanosensitive and matrix stiffness regulate macrophage phenotypes in atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mechanism of matrix stiffness regulating macrophage polarization still lacks in-depth research, which hinders the development of new anti-atherosclerotic therapies. In this review, we discuss the important role of matrix stiffness in regulating macrophage polarization through mechanical signal transduction (Hippo, Piezo, cytoskeleton, and integrin) and epigenetic mechanisms (miRNA, DNA methylation, and histone). We hope to provide a new perspective for atherosclerosis therapy by targeting matrix stiffness and macrophage polarization.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2022-04-29", "authors": ["YinWang", "RuotongShi", "RanZhai", "ShiyanYang", "TianqiPeng", "FuwenZheng", "YanNanShen", "MeiyingLi", "LishaLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106236"}

As in rapid- and slow-adapting mechanoreceptors, piezoionic currents can vary widely in duration, from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. These currents are shown to elicit direct neuromodulation and muscle excitation, suggesting a path toward bionic sensory interfaces. The signal magnitude and duration depend on cationic and anionic mobility differences. Patterned hydrogel films with gradients of fixed charge provide voltage offsets akin to cell potentials. The combined effects enable the creation of self-powered and ultrasoft piezoionic mechanoreceptors that generate a charge density four to six orders of magnitude higher than those of triboelectric and piezoelectric devices.", "journal": "Science (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2022-04-29", "authors": ["YutaDobashi", "DicksonYao", "YaelPetel", "Tan NgocNguyen", "Mirza SaquibSarwar", "YacineThabet", "Cliff L WNg", "EttoreScabeni Glitz", "Giao Tran MinhNguyen", "C\u00e9dricPlesse", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricVidal", "Carl AMichal", "John D WMadden"], "doi": "10.1126/science.aaw1974"}

This study aimed to screen for MP contamination in marine fish in Taif market, Saudi Arabia. A total of 22 fish species were used according to their different marine habitats and feedings. We have focused on extracting MPs from gills and muscles using KOH digestion. Nile red dye was used for the MP identification under fluorescence microscopy followed by the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. This study has reported MP contamination in gills and muscles of all the studied fish, in which poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) was present in epipelagic species, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and poly(2,4,6,-tribromostyrene) (PtBS) were present in pelagic species, and PtBS and chlorosulfonated polyethylene were present in demersal/benthopelagic species. Moreover, benthic fish samples contain PtBS particles; reef-associated species have three different MP particles/fiber PtBS, PVDF, and poly(vinyl formal) and the rest of the studied species samples contain PtBS. The results highlight that the MP pollution increased to reach different species from the pelagic species to the benthic ones.

{"title": "Nebulization Swab Assisted Photoionization Tandem Miniaturized Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry for On-Site Analysis of Nonvolatile Compounds.", "abstract": "Nonvolatile compounds usually have a high molecular weight and exhibit a high boiling point, which poses great challenges to the ionization method of MS. Ambient ionization sources can efficiently analyze the nonvolatile compounds without complex pretreatment, but they generally require special media such as heating devices, laser optical devices, or corona needles. Acoustic nebulization assisted photoionization (ANPI) is a potential method for the analysis of nonvolatile compounds that uses nebulization as a prerequisite for photoionization and introduces many advantages of PI, including excellent ionization efficiency, a high yield of molecular ions, and simplified spectrum interpretation. However, the ANPI source can be limited in on-site applications by the complexity of the analytical devices and the high cost of the nebulization chip. To address this issue, in this paper, we explored cheap and commercially piezoelectric materials used in a mist sprayer and fabricated a nebulization swab assisted photoionization (NSAP) as an ambient ionization source. Some useful results are presented: numerical simulation was introduced successfully for optimizing the aerosol distribution in the NSAP source; nonvolatile muscle relaxants, drugs of abuse, antibiotics, phthalates, and cholesterol were detected mostly as their protonated molecular ions while some special acetone/water cluster ions were detected. In addition, the LOD for most of the target analytes ranged from 10.0 to 50.0 pg with RSD \u2264 9%. Finally, this method is implemented for Chinese baijiu spiked with phthalates.

{"title": "Structure and Properties of PVDF/PA6 Blends Compatibilized by Ionic Liquid-Grafted PA6.", "abstract": "Compatibilization of immiscible blends is critically important for developing high-performance polymer materials. In this work, an ionic liquid, 1-vinyl-3-butyl imidazole chloride, grafted polyamide 6 (PA6-g-IL(Cl)) with a quasi-block structure was used as a compatibilizer for an immiscible poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/PA6 blend. The effects of two PA6-g-IL(Cl)s (E-2%-50K and E-8%-50K) on the morphology, crystallization behavior, mechanical properties, and surface resistance of the PVDF/PA6 blend were investigated systematically. It was found that the two types of PA6-g-IL(Cl)s had a favorable compatibilization effect on the PVDF/PA6 blend. Specifically, the morphology of the PVDF/PA6 = 60/40 blend transformed from a typical sea-island into a bicontinuous structure after incorporating E-8%-50K with a high degree of grafting (DG). In addition, the tensile strength of the PVDF/PA6/E-8%-50K blend reached 66 MPa, which is higher than that of PVDF, PA6 and the PVDF/PA6 blend. Moreover, the PVDF/PA6/E-8%-50K blend exhibited surface conductivity due to the conductive path offered by the bicontinuous structure and conductive ions offered by grafted IL(Cl). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffractometry (WAXD) results revealed that PA6-g-IL(Cl) exhibits different effects on the crystallization behavior of PVDF and PA6. The compatibilization mechanism was concluded to be based on the fact that the nongrafted PA6 blocks entangled with the PA6 chains, while the ionic liquid-grafted PA6 blocks interacted with the PVDF chains.

PDRC has attracted considerable attention and shows great potential for personal thermal management (PTM).

In this study, a series of polymer films based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and their composite films with silica aerogels (aerogel-functionalized TPU (AFTPU)) are prepared using a simple and scalable non-solvent-phase-separation strategy. The TPU and AFTPU films are freestanding, mechanically strong, show high solar reflection up to 94%, and emit strongly in the atmospheric transparency window, thereby achieving subambient cooling of 10.0 and 7.7\u00a0\u00b0C on a hot summer day for the TPU and AFTPU film (10 wt%), respectively. The AFTPU films can be used as waterproof and moisture permeable coatings for traditional textiles, such as cotton, polyester, and nylon, and the highest temperature drop of 17.6\u00a0\u00b0C is achieved with respect to pristine nylon fabric, in which both the cooling performance and waterproof properties are highly desirable for the PTM applications.

While strategies for increasing the crystallinity of electroactive \u03b2 phases have thus far been the major focus in realizing enhanced piezoelectric performance, tailoring the fiber morphology can also be a promising alternative. Herein, a design strategy that combines the nonsolvent-induced phase separation of a polymer/solvent/water ternary system and electrospinning for fabricating piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE) fibers with surface porosity under ambient humidity is presented. Notably, electrospun P(VDF-TrFE) fibers with higher surface porosity outperform their smooth-surfaced counterparts with a higher \u03b2 phase content in terms of output voltage and power generation. Theoretical and numerical studies also underpin the contribution of the structural porosity to the harvesting performance, which is attributable to local stress concentration and reduced dielectric constant due to the air in the pores.

This paper presents a new deformable mirror for wavefront control that meets the active mode matching requirements of advanced LIGO. The active element is a piezo-electric transducer, which actuates on the radius of curvature of a 5 mm thick mirror via an axisymmetric flexure. The operating range of the deformable mirror is 120\u00b18 mD in vacuum and an additional 200 mD adjustment range accessible out of vacuum. Combining the operating range and the adjustable static offset, it is possible to deform a flat mirror from -65 mD to -385 mD. The measured bandwidth of the actuator and driver electronics is 6.8 Hz. The scattering into higher-order modes is measured to be <0.2% over the nominal beam radius.

In this study, the co-pyrolysis characteristics of fluorine-containing substances and active materials from LIB were investigated using thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Associated with the pyrolysis, active materials adsorb the residues of electrolyte on the surface and into the pores (20-200\u00a0\u00b0C), while polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) forms a liquid film to cover the local surface of active materials (400-500\u00a0\u00b0C).

The system is modeled as a set of two coupled harmonic oscillators: one corresponds to the compliant ink channel and the other corresponds to the microbubble. The predicted and measured eigenfrequencies are in excellent agreement. It was found that the resonance frequency is independent of the bubble size as long as the compliance of the bubble dominates over that of the piezo actuator. An accurate description of the eigenfrequency of the coupled system requires the inclusion of the increased inertance of the entrained microbubble due to confinement. It is shown that the inertance of a confined bubble can be accurately obtained by using a simple potential flow approach.

{"title": "Influence of zwitterionic structure design on mixed matrix membrane stability, hydrophilicity, and fouling resistance: A computational study.", "abstract": "Zwitterion-based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with designed characteristics of enhanced water flux, selectivity, and fouling mitigation have emerged as a new class of advanced membranes for oilsands process-affected wastewater (OSPW) treatment. Zwitterions (ZW) characterized by super-hydrophilicity and excellent fouling resistance have gained increasing attention in membrane modification research. In general, zwitterion properties are determined by the chemistry and structural properties of its constituents, including the polymer backbone, charged moieties, spacers, as well as molecular configuration. This study used molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) to investigate the effects of polymer backbone (PB), spacer length (SL), and spacer chemistry (SC) on ZW-based MMM properties such as stability, hydrophilicity, and oil-antifouling potentiality. Membrane performance was also assessed at high temperatures (50, 70, and 90\u00a0\u00b0C. The results suggest PB, SL, and SC all influence the resultant MMM performance, with SL being the most impactful structural parameter on stability and hydrophilicity. Variation of SL was suspected to alter the ionic association and partial charges of zwitterionic moieties, which affect their ability to interact with the polymer network and water molecules. Spacer chemistry (i.e., hydroxyl (-OH) groups) can initiate self-association between zwitterionic charged groups having short SL, lessening their inter-molecular networking ability. However, for ZWs with long SL, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the spacer can result in the formation of hydrogen bonds and/or electrostatic interactions with other ZW molecules and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) polymer chains or water molecules, improving membrane stability and hydrophilicity. High temperatures reduced membrane stability but to a lesser extent for MMMs compared to unmodified PVDF membrane. While temperature greatly influenced membrane hydrophilicity, the impacts were membrane-specific. The oil-fouling propensity of pristine PVDF membrane increased with temperature but of MMMs appeared stable across the temperature range studied.", "journal": "Journal of molecular graphics & modelling", "date": "2022-04-24", "authors": ["Vu TanBui", "AmiraAbdelrasoul", "Dena WMcMartin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmgm.2022.108187"}

The research question is how the pressure on the feet would vary depending on walking/running speed. This study involved 20 healthy volunteers. Dynamic measurement of foot pressure was performed using the Ortopiezometr at normal, slow, and fast paces of walking. Obtained data underwent analysis in a \"Steps\" program. Based on the median, the power generated by the sensors during the entire stride period is the highest during a fast walk, whereas based on the average; a walk or slow walk prevails. During a fast walk, the difference between the mean and the median of the stride period is the smallest. Regardless of the pace of gait, the energy released per unit time does not depend on the paces of the volunteers' gaits. Conclusions: Ortopiezometr is a feasible tool for the dynamic measurement of foot pressure. For investigations on walking motions, the plantar pressure analysis system, which uses the power generated on sensors installed in the insoles of shoes, is an alternative to force or energy measurements.

{"title": "Bi-Directional Piezoelectric Multi-Modal Energy Harvester Based on Saw-Tooth Cantilever Array.", "abstract": "The paper presents numerical and experimental investigations on a bi-directional multi-modal energy harvester which is based on a piezoelectric saw-tooth cantilever array. The harvester is composed of four piezoelectric cantilevers which are connected rigidly to each other. At each junction of the cantilevers, there are placed seismic masses which are used to reduce resonant frequencies of the cantilever array. Moreover, at the center of the cantilever array is placed a Z-shaped seismic mass, which is used to obtain an additional rotation moment during excitation of the energy harvester to this way increase the stability of output characteristics via the whole angular range. The rigid connection between cantilevers ensures the transfer of bending deformations from cantilevers which are resonant to cantilevers which are out of resonance operation mode. The design of cantilever array ensures that all piezo ceramics are affected or partly affected by bending deformations while excitation frequency changes from 10 Hz to 160 Hz. In addition, such a composition of the array ensures the multi-modal operation principle. Additionally, the proposed cantilever array is designed to respond to changes of excitation force angle in an XY plane. The numerical and experimental investigation have shown that the proposed energy harvester has four resonant frequencies at a range from 10 Hz to 160 Hz. The electrical characteristics of the harvester were investigated as well. The results of these investigations have shown that cantilever array is able to provide an average output power of 15.3 mW while excitation amplitude is 0.5 m/s", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-04-24", "authors": ["Andrius\u010ceponis", "DaliusMa\u017eeika", "Art\u016brasKilikevi\u010dius"], "doi": "10.3390/s22082880\n10.1109/MCOM.2015.7120024\n10.1016/j.rser.2020.109901\n10.3390/electronics9091345\n10.1109/PerComWorkshops48775.2020.9156195\n10.3390/s20030764\n10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064066\n10.1016/j.matpr.2020.04.115\n10.3390/smartcities4020025\n10.1016/j.jksus.2017.05.019\n10.1007/s00542-018-3763-z\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.029\n10.1063/1.5004254\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112068\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105567\n10.3390/s20123512\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112503\n10.1109/TIM.2020.3026462\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108043\n10.1209/0295-5075/130/54003\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac112c\n10.3390/en12163166\n10.1177/1045389X211006910\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/095012\n10.1177/1045389X211001456\n10.1515/ehs-2016-0028\n10.4236/jpee.2019.79003\n10.1007/s40684-020-00281-9\n10.1088/1361-665X/abe87e\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114615"}

This technique allowed us to obtain POMS-based membranes with silver nanoparticles (8 nm), which are dispersed in the polymer matrix. The dispersion of silver in the POMS matrix is confirmed by the data IR-spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence analyses.

Each component is optimized through experiments to control the electrical and physical characteristics of the conductive nonwoven fabric. The static and dynamic piezoresistive properties of the fabricated MWCNT composite conductive nonwoven are measured using a source meter and the fabricated sensor driving circuitry. In addition, a prototype bag with a touch sensor is developed using the fabricated conductive nonwoven fabric and its touchpad function is demonstrated using an Android application. The operation as a mode-switchable touch sensor was experimentally verified by inserting the sensor into a bag so that it can be used without direct manipulation on a mobile device.

{"title": "Scaled-Up Multi-Needle Electrospinning Process Using Parallel Plate Auxiliary Electrodes.", "abstract": "Electrospinning has gained much attention in recent years due to its ability to easily produce high-quality polymeric nanofibers. However, electrospinning suffers from limited production capacity and a method to readily scale up this process is needed. One obvious approach includes the use of multiple electrospinning needles operating in parallel. Nonetheless, such an implementation has remained elusive, partly due to the uneven electric field distribution resulting from the Coulombic repulsion between the charged jets and needles. In this work, the uniformization of the electric field was performed for a linear array of twenty electrospinning needles using lateral charged plates as auxiliary electrodes. The effect of the auxiliary electrodes was characterized by investigating the semi-vertical angle of the spun jets, the deposition area and diameter of the fibers, as well as the thickness of the produced membranes. Finite element simulation was also used to analyze the impact of the auxiliary electrodes on the electric field intensity below each needle. Implementing parallel lateral plates as auxiliary electrodes was shown to help achieve uniformization of the electric field, the semi-vertical angle of the spun jet, and the deposition area of the fibers for the multi-needle electrospinning process.

{"title": "The Effect of Ink Supply Pressure on Piezoelectric Inkjet.", "abstract": "Experimental and numerical analysis of the drop-on-demand inkjet was conducted to determine the jetting characteristics and meniscus motion under the control of the ink supply pressure. A single transparent nozzle inkjet head driven by a piezoelectric actuator was used to eject droplets. To control ink supply pressure, the pressure of the air in the reservoir was regulated by a dual valve pressure controller. The inkjet performance and the motion of the meniscus were evaluated by visualization and numerical simulation. A two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical simulation with the dynamic mesh method was performed to simulate the inkjet dynamics, including the actual deformation of the piezoelectric actuator. Numerical simulation showed good agreement with the experimental results of droplet velocity and volume with an accuracy of 87.1%. Both the experimental and simulation results showed that the drop volume and velocity were linearly proportional to the voltage change. For the specific voltages, an analysis of the effect of the ink supply pressure control was conducted. At the maximum negative pressure, -3 kPa, the average velocity reductions were 0.558 and 0.392 m/s in the experiment and simulation, respectively, which were 18.7 and 11.6% less than those of the uncontrolled case of 0 kPa. Therefore, the simulation environment capable of simulating the entire inkjet dynamics, including meniscus movement regarded to be successfully established. The average volume reductions were 18.7 and 6.97 pL for the experiment and simulation, respectively, which were 21.7 and 9.17% less than those of the uncontrolled case. In the results of the meniscus motion simulation, the damping of the residual vibration agreed well with the experimental results according to the ink supply pressure change. Reducing the ink supply pressure reduced the speed and volume, improved the damping of residual vibrations, and suppressed satellite drops.

As key components in ultrasonic applications, the characteristic parameters of ultrasonic transducers fundamentally determine the performance of ultrasonic systems. High-frequency ultrasonic transducers are small in size and require high precision, which puts forward higher requirements for sensor design, material selection, and processing methods. In this paper, a three-dimensional model of a high-frequency piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) is established based on the finite element method (FEM). This 3D model consists of a substrate, a silicon device layer, and a molybdenum-aluminum nitride-molybdenum (Mo-AlN-Mo) sandwich piezoelectric layer. The effect of the shape of the transducer's vibrating membrane on the transmission performance was studied. Through a discussion of the parametric scanning of the key dimensions of the diaphragms of the three structures, it was concluded that the fundamental resonance frequency of the hexagonal diaphragm was higher than that of the circle and the square under the same size. Compared with the circular diaphragm, the sensitivity of the square diaphragm increased by 8.5%, and the sensitivity of the hexagonal diaphragm increased by 10.7%. The maximum emission sound-pressure level of the hexagonal diaphragm was 6.6 times higher than that of the circular diaphragm.

The funnel type energy harvester (FTEH) with PVDF proposed in this study is an energy harvester in which the inlet has a larger cross-sectional area than the outlet and a spiral structure is inserted to generate a vortex flow at the inlet. Based on numerical analysis, when PVDF with L = 100 mm and t = 1 mm was used, the electric power of 39 \u03bcW was generated at flow velocity of 0.25 m/s. In experiment the average RMS voltage of FTEH increased by 0.0209 V when the flow velocity increased by 1 m/s. When measured at 0.25 m/s flow velocity for 25 s, it was shown that voltage doubler rectifier (VDR) generated a voltage of 133.4 mV, 2.25 times larger than that of full bridge rectifier (FBR), and the energy charged in the capacitor was 44.3 nJ, 14% higher in VDR than that of the FBR. In addition, the VDR can deliver power of 17.75 \u03bcW for 1 k\u03a9 load.

{"title": "Self-Adaptive Pendulum-Ball Switches for Piezoelectric Synchronous-Extraction Circuits.", "abstract": "Electronic synchronous switches are usually used to enhance the performance of piezoelectric energy-extraction circuits, but the electronic components leading to additional power consumption are not desired for energy extraction. In view of the advantage of mechanical switches without power consumption, this article proposed a synchronous-switch circuit which can adapt to the amplitude of a cantilever-beam-vibration generator with less energy loss. This mechanical switch consists of two pendulum balls and two buffer springs. This switch mechanism can automatically adapt to the cantilever-displacement amplitude, control the closing and opening of switches with the decrease in phase advance angle, and increase in energy-extraction efficiency. Different from previous adaptive mechanical switches, this unique pendulum-ball mechanism can not only reduce the weight and volume of the generator to improve the energy density, but can also simply adjust the pendulum length to achieve better harvesting performance. It is verified experimentally that the adaptive mechanical switch can close and open automatically under different cantilever amplitudes and excitation frequencies; the results show that the optimal power of the proposed circuit can reach 4.2 times that of the standard circuit. In order to further optimize the adaptive mechanical switch, the parameters of the swing-ball mechanism affecting harvesting performance is analyzed.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-04-24", "authors": ["YaoHuang", "GangQin", "WeiqunLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13040532\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.040\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.04.020\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.053\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/2/025029\n10.1063/1.4748794\n10.1063/1.4919532\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.06.029\n10.1063/1.5022599\n10.1177/1045389X06057533\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/12/125009\n10.1109/TUFFC.912\n10.1177/1045389X05056859\n10.1177/1045389X12470307\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa5e92\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/035030\n10.1109/TIE.2011.2167116\n10.1109/TPEL.2016.2636903\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2762640\n10.1109/TPEL.2018.2790965\n10.1088/1361-665X/aab339\n10.1051/epjap/2012110355\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.04.018\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.04.040\n10.1177/1045389X14533437\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/12/125013\n10.1063/1.4932519\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.051\n10.1088/1361-665X/aae0aa\n10.1109/TIE.2020.2970662"}
{"title": "Self-Powered Galvanic Vibration Sensor.", "abstract": "The development of the IoT demands small, durable, remote sensing systems that have energy harvesters and storage. Various energy harvesters are developed, including piezoelectric, triboelectric, electromagnetic, and reverse-electrowetting-on-dielectric. However, integrating energy storage and sensing functionality receives little attention. This paper presents an electrochemical vibration sensor with a galvanic cell (Zn-Cu cell) as energy storage and a vibration transducer. The frequency response, scale factor, long-term response, impedance study, and discharge characteristics are given. This study proved the possibility of integrating energy storage and vibration sensing functionality with promising performance. The performance of the sensor halved within 74 min. The longevity of the sensor is short due to the spontaneous reactions and ions drained. The sensitivity can be restored after refilling the electrolyte.

{"title": "A Strategy for Extracting Full Material Coefficients of AlN Thin Film Based on Resonance Method.", "abstract": "AlN thin film is widely used in piezoelectric MEMS devices, and the accurate characterizations of its material coefficients are critical for the optimization of the AlN thin film process and the design of AlN thin-film-based devices. However, it is difficult to extract the material coefficients of AlN in the form of thin film. This paper reports a strategy for systematically extracting full elastic coefficients, piezoelectric coefficients and dielectric constants of c-axis-oriented AlN thin film based on the resonance method outlined in IEEE Standard on Piezoelectricity Std 176-1987. In this strategy, four self-suspended resonators with length thickness extension (LTE), thickness extension (TE), radial extension (RE), lateral electric field excited thickness shear (LEF-TS) modes together with a lamb wave resonator (LWR) are specifically adopted, and the material coefficients of AlN thin film are extracted by measuring the impedance spectra of these resonators. In addition, the effects of the pad and electrodes on the resonators were systematically studied, and the corresponding procedures to eliminate their influences on the extraction accuracy of material coefficients were proposed. Finally, a complete extraction process based on the above strategy was established. The simulation results show that the strategy can achieve high accuracy for AlN thin film with different thicknesses and electrode configurations, and it can also be applied to other materials belonging to the 6 mm piezoelectric crystal class such as ZnO, ScAlN, etc.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-04-24", "authors": ["ChenWang", "YangYang", "LifengQin", "ShenglinMa", "YufengJin"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13040513\n10.1038/s41598-019-53713-1\n10.1063/1.3194148\n10.1109/LED.2017.2769619\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2010.08.109\n10.1088/0268-1242/28/6/065013\n10.1063/1.4973648\n10.1021/acs.cgd.8b01045\n10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2011.10.052\n10.1063/1.4885058\n10.1116/1.1649343\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.03.001\n10.1109/T-SU.1985.31647\n10.1143/APEX.1.077004\n10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007252\n10.1143/JJAP.48.09KD09\n10.1109/101.933786\n10.1063/1.3483245\n10.1109/T-SU.1973.29750\n10.1007/s00339-010-5591-6\n10.1109/TMTT.1969.1127082\n10.1109/22.275248\n10.1063/1.101189\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1485"}

{"title": "The Role of the Built-In Electric Field in Recombination Processes of GaN/AlGaN Quantum Wells: Temperature- and Pressure-Dependent Study of Polar and Non-Polar Structures.", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the optical properties of non-polar and polar GaN/AlGaN multi-quantum well (MQW) structures by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and pressure-dependent studies. The lack of internal electric fields across the non-polar structures results in an improved electron and hole wavefunction overlap with respect to the polar structures. Therefore, the radiative recombination presents shorter decay times, independent of the well width. On the contrary, the presence of electric fields in the polar structures reduces the emission energy and the wavefunction overlap, which leads to a strong decrease in the recombination rate when increasing the well width. Taking into account the different energy dependences of radiative recombination in non-polar and polar structures of the same geometry, and assuming that non-radiative processes are energy independent, we attempted to explain the 'S-shape' behavior of the PL energy observed in polar GaN/AlGaN QWs, and its absence in non-polar structures. This approach has been applied previously to InGaN/GaN structures, showing that the interplay of radiative and non-radiative recombination processes can justify the 'S-shape' in polar InGaN/GaN MQWs. Our results show that the differences in the energy dependences of radiative and non-radiative recombination processes cannot explain the 'S-shape' behavior by itself, and localization effects due to the QW width fluctuation are also important. Additionally, the influence of the electric field on the pressure behavior of the investigated structures was studied, revealing different pressure dependences of the PL energy in non-polar and polar MQWs. Non-polar MQWs generally follow the pressure dependence of the GaN bandgap. In contrast, the pressure coefficients of the PL energy in polar QWs are highly reduced with respect to those of the bulk GaN, which is due to the hydrostatic-pressure-induced increase in the piezoelectric field in quantum structures and the nonlinear behavior of the piezoelectric constant.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-04-24", "authors": ["KamilKoronski", "Krzysztof PKorona", "SerhiiKryvyi", "AleksandraWierzbicka", "KamilSobczak", "StanislawKrukowski", "PawelStrak", "EvaMonroy", "AgataKaminska"], "doi": "10.3390/ma15082756\n10.1063/1.1390485\n10.1143/JJAP.43.5945\n10.1002/pssc.200461446\n10.1063/1.1899760\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab4d7b\n10.1088/0953-8984/13/32/316\n10.12691/ajn-7-4-2\n10.1016/j.solmat.2016.07.047\n10.1088/0268-1242/28/7/074022\n10.1063/1.4926423\n10.1063/1.116981\n10.1063/1.119013\n10.1063/1.120025\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.323\n10.1016/0031-8914(67)90062-6\n10.1103/PhysRevB.30.1979\n10.1002/pssb.200405208\n10.1063/1.119797\n10.1063/1.122164\n10.1063/1.1403655\n10.1063/1.1625111\n10.1063/1.4845715\n10.12693/APhysPolA.130.1209\n10.1063/1.1418255\n10.1063/1.1689736\n10.1063/1.1651323\n10.1103/PhysRevB.90.205302\n10.1063/1.4964842\n10.1063/1.118767\n10.1063/1.122266\n10.1103/PhysRevB.64.115319\n10.1063/1.1396631\n10.1103/PhysRevB.64.241308\n10.1063/1.1483906\n10.1002/pssb.200301563\n10.1063/1.2977608\n10.1063/1.4749405\n10.1063/1.3043888\n10.1063/1.4962282\n10.7567/JJAP.56.05FA02\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.050\n10.1063/1.1343479\n10.1088/0957-4484/27/14/145201\n10.1063/1.4993570\n10.1063/1.119949\n10.1088/0034-4885/72/3/036502\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.53.2173\n10.1063/1.120269\n10.1002/pssc.200303127\n10.1063/1.124193\n10.1103/PhysRevB.59.15363\n10.1103/PhysRevB.57.R9435\n10.1002/pssa.201127485\n10.1103/PhysRevB.52.R17028\n10.1016/S0038-1098(98)00381-0\n10.1063/1.4813446\n10.1063/1.117892\n10.1103/PhysRevB.55.9251\n10.1063/1.1582230\n10.1063/1.1600519\n10.1063/1.3125508\n10.1063/1.113774\n10.1063/1.369554"}

However, the liquid operating environment poses a challenge to maintaining a fine sensing performance, particularly through electrical characterization. This paper presents a piezoelectric micromachined cantilever with a stepped shape for liquid monitoring purposes. Multiple modes of the proposed cantilever are available with full electrical characterization for realizing self-actuated and self-sensing capabilities. The focus is on higher flexural resonances, which nonconventionally feature two-dimensional vibration modes. Modal analyses are conducted for the developed cantilever under flexural vibrations at different orders. Modeling explains not only the basic length-dominant mode but also higher modes that simultaneously depend on the length and width of the cantilever. This study determines that the analytical predictions for resonant frequency in liquid media exhibit good agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, the experiments on cantilever resonators are performed in various test liquids, demonstrating that higher-order flexural modes allow for the decoupled measurements of density and viscosity. The measurement differences achieve 0.39% in density and 3.50% in viscosity, and the frequency instability is below 0.05\u2030.

{"title": "Flat PVDF Membrane with Enhanced Hydrophobicity through Alkali Activation and Organofluorosilanisation for Dissolved Methane Recovery.", "abstract": "A three-step surface modification consisting of activation with NaOH, functionalisation with a silica precursor and organofluorosilane mixture (FSiT), and curing was applied to a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane for the recovery of dissolved methane (D-CH4) from aqueous streams. Based on the results of a statistical experimental design, the main variables affecting the water contact angle (WCA) were the NaOH concentration and the FSiT ratio and concentration used. The maximum WCA of the modified PVDF (mPVDFmax) was >140\u00b0 at a NaOH concentration of 5%, an FSiT ratio of 0.55 and an FSiT concentration of 7.2%. The presence of clusters and a lower surface porosity of mPVDF was detected by FESEM analysis. In long-term stability tests with deionised water at 21 L h\u22121, the WCA of the mPVDF decreased rapidly to around 105\u00b0, similar to that of pristine nmPVDF. In contrast, the WCA of the mPVDF was always higher than that of nmPVDF in long-term operation with an anaerobic effluent at 3.5 L h\u22121 and showed greater mechanical stability, since water breakthrough was detected only with the nmPVDF membrane. D-CH4 degassing tests showed that the increase in hydrophobicity induced by the modification procedure increased the D-CH4 removal efficiency but seemed to promote fouling.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-04-22", "authors": ["Ram\u00f3nJim\u00e9nez-Robles", "Beatriz Mar\u00edaMoreno-Torralbo", "Jose DavidBadia", "VicenteMart\u00ednez-Soria", "MartaIzquierdo"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12040426\n10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.019\n10.1016/j.seppur.2017.08.021\n10.1007/s11157-020-09546-w\n10.1038/s41545-018-0021-y\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.115791\n10.1007/s10311-019-00919-4\n10.1205/cherd.04196\n10.1016/j.seppur.2021.120057\n10.1021/cr800208y\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118621\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.055\n10.1557/jmr.2017.403\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.06.045\n10.1016/j.seppur.2005.04.007\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130448\n10.1002/anie.201601509\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.06.016\n10.1016/j.desal.2020.114857\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.12.008\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.059\n10.1039/C5RA00085H\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.09.048\n10.1016/S0032-3861(99)00343-2\n10.1002/app.39197\n10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.01.002\n10.1016/j.jfluchem.2016.06.005\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.07.016\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.10.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.04.062\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.07.022\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.11.003\n10.1002/app.24350\n10.1039/C4RA15448G\n10.1016/b978-0-444-63776-5.00012-7\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118560\n10.2166/wst.2012.897\n10.1016/j.watres.2011.04.030\n10.1016/j.seppur.2017.05.035\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118301\n10.1016/S0032-3861(00)00328-1\n10.1016/j.ces.2010.12.019\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.050\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.03.010\n10.1016/j.desal.2021.115241\n10.1016/j.seppur.2016.06.024\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.05.016\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117263\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.12.038\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.01.016"}
{"title": "Novel Sandwich-Structured Hollow Fiber Membrane for High-Efficiency Membrane Distillation and Scale-Up for Pilot Validation.", "abstract": "Hollow fiber membranes were produced from a commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer, Kynar HSV 900, with a unique sandwich structure consisting of two sponge-like layers connected to the outer and inner skin layers while the middle layer comprises macrovoids. The sponge-like layer allows the membrane to have good mechanical strength even at low skin thickness and favors water vapor transportation during vacuum membrane distillation (VMD). The middle layer with macrovoids helps to significantly reduce the trans-membrane resistance during water vapor transportation from the feed side to the permeate side. Together, these novel structural characteristics are expected to render the PVDF hollow fiber membranes more efficient in terms of vapor flux as well as mechanical integrity. Using the chemistry and process conditions adopted from previous work, we were able to scale up the membrane fabrication from a laboratory scale of 1.5 kg to a manufacturing scale of 50 kg with consistent membrane performance. The produced PVDF membrane, with a liquid entry pressure (LEPw) of >3 bar and a pure water flux of >30 L/m2\u00b7hr (LMH) under VMD conditions at 70\u221280 \u00b0C, is perfectly suitable for next-generation high-efficiency membranes for desalination and industrial wastewater applications.

{"title": "Preparation of Nano-TiO", "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles have been applied in membrane antifouling performance modification for years. However, the influence of TiO2 nanoparticle dispersion status during the blending process on membrane properties and the inner mechanism has seldom been focused on. Herein, we investigated the influence of the various dispersing statuses of TiO2 nanoparticles on membrane properties and antifouling performance by exploring various blending processes without changing the original recipe. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was employed as a pore-forming agent during the membrane preparation process, and also as a pre-dispersing agent for the TiO2 nanoparticles via the steric hindrance effect. Compared to the original preparation process of the PVDF/TiO2 composite membrane, the pre-dispersing of TiO2 via PEG ensured a modified membrane with uniform surface pores and structures on cross-sectional morphologies, larger porosity and water permeability, and more negative zeta potential. The contact angle was decreased by 6.0%, implying better hydrophilicity. The improved antifouling performance was corroborated by the increasing free energy of cohesion and adhesion, the interaction energy barrier (0.43 KT) between the membrane surfaces and approaching foulants assessed by classic XDLVO theory and the low flux decline in the filtration experiment. A kinetics mechanism analysis of the casting solutions, which found a low TSI value (<1.0), substantiated that the pre-dispersion of TiO2 with PEG contributed to the high stability and ultimately favorable antifouling behaviors.

{"title": "Evaluation of Host Cell Impurity Effects on the Performance of Sterile Filtration Processes for Therapeutic Viruses.", "abstract": "Efficient downstream processing represents a significant challenge in the rapidly developing field of therapeutic viruses. While it is known that the terminal sterile filtration step can be a major cause of product loss, there is little known about the effect of host cell impurities (DNA and protein) on filtration performance. In this study, fractions of relatively pure Vero host cell protein and DNA were spiked into a highly pure preparation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Then, the resulting solutions were sterile filtered using two commercially available 0.22 \u00b5m rated microfiltration membranes. A combination of transmembrane pressure measurements, virus recovery measurements, and post-filtration microscopy images of the microfiltration membranes was used to evaluate the sterile filtration performance. It was found that increasing the amount of host cell protein from approximately 1 \u00b5g/mL (in the un-spiked VSV preparation) to 25 \u00b5g/mL resulted in a greater extent of membrane fouling, causing the VSV recovery to decrease from 89% to 65% in experiments conducted with the highly asymmetric Express PLUS PES membrane and to go as low as 48% in experiments conducted with the symmetric Durapore PVDF membrane. Similar effects were not seen when bovine serum albumin, a common model protein used in filtration studies, was spiked into the VSV preparation, which indicates that the sterile filtration performance is critically dependent on the complex composition of the mixture of host cell proteins rather than the presence of any protein. The results presented in this work provide important insights into the role of host cell impurities on the performance of sterile filtration processes for therapeutic viruses.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-04-22", "authors": ["EvanWright", "KarinaKawka", "Maria Fe CMedina", "David RLatulippe"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12040359\n10.1038/mtm.2016.18\n10.1186/s13027-018-0218-1\n10.21037/cco.2018.04.04\n10.1056/NEJMoa1414216\n10.1016/j.drudis.2018.05.011\n10.1038/s41598-018-23593-y\n10.1038/gt.2017.91\n10.1089/hgtb.2012.059\n10.1002/bit.25545\n10.1080/21645515.2015.1009817\n10.1371/journal.pone.0115802\n10.1371/journal.pone.0150700\n10.1371/journal.pone.0034834\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.022\n10.1371/journal.pone.0057224\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.08.074\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.11.005\n10.1002/btpr.2125\n10.1016/j.seppur.2008.03.013\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.002\n10.1021/bp049644r\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.02.021\n10.1016/S0376-7388(01)00522-1\n10.1007/BF02953246\n10.1002/bit.260100612\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.01.031\n10.1021/ie000810j\n10.1016/S0166-0934(03)00046-6\n10.1128/AEM.66.7.2914-2920.2000\n10.4161/hv.4.5.5863\n10.1021/bp050294y\n10.3390/biomedicines2010080\n10.1016/j.jpba.2019.06.038\n10.18609/cgti.2018.016\n10.4161/mabs.4.1.18748\n10.1002/btpr.1514\n10.3390/antib6030013\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19970705)55:1<91::AID-BIT11>3.0.CO;2-6\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)00658-X\n10.1006/jcis.1994.1338\n10.1016/0376-7388(93)85142-J\n10.1080/14712598.2020.1693541\n10.1099/jgv.0.000980\n10.1126/science.1181766\n10.1128/JVI.01106-12\n10.1016/j.omtm.2020.03.025\n10.1016/j.omtm.2020.09.015\n10.1186/1743-422X-6-166\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.117503\n10.1002/btpr.2114\n10.1021/bp070396j\n10.1002/btpr.1581\n10.1002/bit.24607\n10.2174/1566523218666181109141257\n10.1007/s10529-010-0469-4\n10.1080/07373937.2012.683123\n10.1016/S0376-7388(98)00324-X\n10.1016/0376-7388(93)85193-Z\n10.1128/am.19.2.317-320.1970\n10.1002/jps.22045\n10.1128/JVI.76.8.3756-3764.2002\n10.1002/app.42042\n10.1016/j.polymer.2019.01.053"}

Blood pressure is an important indicator for diagnosing hypertension. Currently, blood pressure measurement methods are mainly based on mercury sphygmomanometers in hospitals or electronic sphygmomanometers at home. However, people's blood pressure changes with time, and using only the blood pressure value at the current moment to judge hypertension may cause misdiagnosis. Continuous blood pressure measurement can monitor sudden increases in blood pressure, and can also provide physicians with long-term continuous blood pressure changes as a diagnostic reference. In this article, we design an artificial intelligence-enhanced blood pressure monitoring wristband. The wristband's sensors are based on piezoelectric nanogenerators, with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 29.7 dB. Through the transformer deep learning model, the wristband can predict blood pressure readings, and the loss value is lower than 4 mmHg. By wearing this blood pressure monitoring wristband, we realized three days of continuous blood pressure monitoring of the subjects.

{"title": "A Comparison of Heart Pulsations Provided by Forcecardiography and Double Integration of Seismocardiogram.", "abstract": "Seismocardiography (SCG) is largely regarded as the state-of-the-art technique for continuous, long-term monitoring of cardiac mechanical activity in wearable applications. SCG signals are acquired via small, lightweight accelerometers fixed on the chest. They provide timings of important cardiac events, such as heart valves openings and closures, thus allowing the estimation of cardiac time intervals of clinical relevance. Forcecardiography (FCG) is a novel technique that records the cardiac-induced vibrations of the chest wall by means of specific force sensors, which proved capable of monitoring respiration, heart sounds and infrasonic cardiac vibrations, simultaneously from a single contact point on the chest. A specific infrasonic component captures the heart walls displacements and looks very similar to the Apexcardiogram. This low-frequency component is not visible in SCG recordings, nor it can be extracted by simple filtering. In this study, a feasible way to extract this information from SCG signals is presented. The proposed approach is based on double integration of SCG. Numerical double integration is usually very prone to large errors, therefore a specific numerical procedure was devised. This procedure yields a new displacement signal (DSCG) that features a low-frequency component (LF-DSCG) very similar to that of the FCG (LF-FCG). Experimental tests were carried out using an FCG sensor and an off-the-shelf accelerometer firmly attached to each other and placed onto the precordial region. Simultaneous recordings were acquired from both sensors, together with an electrocardiogram lead (used as a reference). Quantitative morphological comparison confirmed the high similarity between LF-FCG and LF-DSCG (normalized cross-correlation index >0.9). Statistical analyses suggested that LF-DSCG, although achieving a fair sensitivity in heartbeat detection (about 90%), has not a very high consistency within the cardiac cycle, leading to inaccuracies in inter-beat intervals estimation.

{"title": "Degradation of G-Type Nerve Agent Simulant with Phase-Inverted Spherical Polymeric-MOF Catalysts.", "abstract": "For the neutralization of chemical warfare agents (CWAs), the generation of an effective catalyst that can be handled safely and applied in personal protective equipment is required. Recently, zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs: UiO-66 and UiO-67) have shown great promise in the degradation of CWAs, including nerve agents. Their catalytic activity is owed to the interplay of both Zr(IV) Lewis acids and Lewis basic groups in the MOF structure. The latter act as proximal bases that can interact with CWAs and improve the catalytic activity of Zr-MOFs. The powder form of MOFs, though, makes them impractical catalysts, as it is challenging to handle, regenerate, and reuse them. To address this challenge, we have synthesized three Zr-MOFs with Lewis basic amino and pyridine functionalities and shaped them in spherical polymeric beads using the phase inversion method. Using this method, we can generate beads with many polymer and MOF combinations (MOF@polymer). We controlled the MOF loading in these beads, and scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the MOF crystals are evenly distributed in the polymeric matrix, ensuring effective catalytic activity.

As a result, mechanical energy harvesters such as piezoelectric and triboelectric generators (TEGs) have been explored recently either as sensors or harvesters to store charge in small, but long-life, energy-storage devices to power the sensors. The use of energy harvesters as sensors is particularly interesting, as with such multifunctional operations it is possible to reduce the number devices needed in a system, which also helps overcome the integration complexities. In this regard, TEGs are promising, particularly for energy autonomous chemical and biological sensors, as they can be developed with a wide variety of materials, and their mechanical energy to electricity conversion can be modulated by various analytes. This review focuses on this interesting dimension of TEGs and presents various self-powered active chemical and biological sensors.

{"title": "Label-Free Real-Time Detection of HBsAg Using a QCM Immunosensor.", "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) is an important protein in both diagnosis and prevention of hepatitis B infection. In the current study, a piezoelectric immunosensor based on antibody-antigen interaction was designed to detect HBsAg. A quartz crystal microbalance system was employed to detect antibody-antigen interaction.\nAt first, an oscillator was designed to measure the resonant frequency affected by the reactants using IC 74LVC1GX04. Antibody against HBsAg was immobilized on 10 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal. The surface modifications were monitored by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements. Different concentrations of antibody were used for surface immobilization and the frequency shifts were assessed. The system stability was studied by evaluating the stability of the crystal and the immobilized antibody. The adsorption of antibody onto the crystal was analyzed using AFM and changes in the resonance frequency. Further, a direct immunoassay was performed with this immobilized antibody to identify HBsAg solutions at different concentrations. Finally, specific and non-specific responses were investigated using hepatitis B (HBsAg) and hepatitis C (HCV Ag) antigens, respectively.\nAntibodies against HBsAg were successfully immobilized on 10 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal. The stability tests of crystal immobilized with antibody and unimmobilized crystal revealed that both forms of crystals were stable. Theoretical and experimental frequency assays were compared. A decrease in the contact angle indicated the hydrophilicity of surface after modifications. AFM images illustrated a more uniform surface after antibody adsorption and the surface roughness (RMS) reduced from 1.13 to 0.99 nm. Changes in the frequency were detected after the physical adsorption of HBsAb on the designed chip. The standard curve of antigen revealed the frequency changes depend on concentration of antigen. Finally, the specificity test confirmed the specificity of the designed biosensor for the detection of HBsAg from HCV Ag. The quantization of immobilized antibody was characterized by the frequency shift of the QCM. The obtained results were compared with ELISA assay. The correlation coefficients of HBsAg dilution between QCM and ELISA was 0.9821.\nThis study is a new step to meet the challenges regarding HBsAg detection. Physical adsorption used in this study was effective as the simplest immobilization method to design a QCM-based immunosensor for HBsAg detection.

One hundred cases had at least 1 year of follow-up. Patients had follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Technical details were recorded, including dissection planes, preservation of the dorsum (DP) vs component reductions, surface vs foundational DP techniques, and open vs closed approach.\nOne hundred patients had at least 1 year of follow-up. Fifty-six patients underwent an open approach and 44 a closed approach. Eighty-three patients had preservation of the dorsal soft tissue envelope. All patients who underwent a closed approach had preservation of the dorsal soft tissue envelope. Sixty-seven patients underwent DP, with 38 receiving surface techniques and 29 undergoing impaction techniques. Thirty-three patients underwent structural rhinoplasty with piezoelectric osteotomies and mid-vault reconstruction. All structural cases were performed employing an open approach. Four revision surgeries were necessary.\nOpen and closed approaches have indications depending on the tip and dorsal deformities. A closed PR is favored with thin skin, minimal dorsal modification, osseocartilaginous preservation (foundation techniques), less complex tip deformities, and overprojected noses. An open PR is favored for extensive dorsal modification, S-shaped nasal bones, complex tip deformities, and tip augmentation.

It is well known that PIEZO1 is expressed at the surface of red blood cells where it adjusts their hydration status under mechanical constraints. Besides this, recent findings suggest that PIEZO1 plays a broader role in erythroid lineage. This review aims to actualize the knowledge on PIEZO1 functions all along erythropoiesis.\nPIEZO1 is expressed in erythroid progenitors, and controls proliferation and differentiation of nucleated cells, as well as maturation of reticulocytes. As PIEZO1 detects displacements in the range of cell-cell interactions, it might mediate the interaction between the differentiating cells and their microenvironment through an inside-out activation of integrins on human erythroblasts as suggested by in-vitro data. Moreover, PIEZO1 is also expressed at the surface of macrophages where it regulates red blood cells clearance through erythrophagocytosis.\nThese new findings on PIEZO1 suggest a continuous effect of mechanotransduction all over erythropoiesis from progenitors to clearance of red blood cells.

{"title": "State-of-the-art review of advanced electrospun nanofiber yarn-based textiles for biomedical applications.", "abstract": "The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made biotextiles, including face masks and protective clothing, quite familiar in our daily lives. Biotextiles are one broad category of textile products that are beyond our imagination. Currently, biotextiles have been routinely utilized in various biomedical fields, like daily protection, wound healing, tissue regeneration, drug delivery, and sensing, to improve the health and medical conditions of individuals. However, these biotextiles are commonly manufactured with fibers with diameters on the micrometer scale (> 10\u00a0\u03bcm). Recently, nanofibrous materials have aroused extensive attention in the fields of fiber science and textile engineering because the fibers with nanoscale diameters exhibited obviously superior performances, such as size and surface/interface effects as well as optical, electrical, mechanical, and biological properties, compared to microfibers. A combination of innovative electrospinning techniques and traditional textile-forming strategies opens a new window for the generation of nanofibrous biotextiles to renew and update traditional microfibrous biotextiles. In the last two decades, the conventional electrospinning device has been widely modified to generate nanofiber yarns (NYs) with the fiber diameters less than 1000 nm. The electrospun NYs can be further employed as the primary processing unit for manufacturing a new generation of nano-textiles using various textile-forming strategies. In this review, starting from the basic information of conventional electrospinning techniques, we summarize the innovative electrospinning strategies for NY fabrication and critically discuss their advantages and limitations. This review further covers the progress in the construction of electrospun NY-based nanotextiles and their recent applications in biomedical fields, mainly including surgical sutures, various scaffolds and implants for tissue engineering, smart wearable bioelectronics, and their current and potential applications in the COVID-19 pandemic.

In MoSI, mechanical vibrations aerosolize solution phase analytes, whereby the resulting microdroplets can be directed into the inlet orifice of a mass spectrometer. In this work, MoSI is applied to biomolecules up to 80 kDa in mass in both denatured and native conditions as well as polymers up to 12 kDa in mass. The various MoSI devices used in these analyses were all comprised of a piezoelectric annulus attached to a central metallic disk containing an array of 4 to 7 \u03bcm diameter holes. The devices vibrated in the 100-170 kHz range to generate a beam of microdroplets that ultimately resulted in ion formation. A linear quadrupole ion trap (LIT) and orbitrap mass spectrometer were used in the analysis to investigate higher mass proteins at both native (folded) and denatured (unfolded) conditions. MoSI native mass spectra of proteins acquired on the orbitrap and LIT instrument demonstrated that proteins could remain intact and in a folded state. In the case of native MS of holomyoglobin, the intact folded protein remained mostly bound noncovalently to the heme group, and typically, the spectra showed reduced loss of the heme group by MoSI as compared to ESI. In both non-native and native protein analyses examples, broader often multimodal distributions to lower charge states were observed. When using the LIT instrument, a significant increase in the relative abundance of dimers was observed by MoSI as compared to ESI. The softness of the MoSI technique was evidenced by the lack of fragmentation, the formation of dimers as also noted by others ( ", "journal": "Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry", "date": "2022-04-15", "authors": ["Liam DDugan", "Mark EBier"], "doi": "10.1021/jasms.1c00344"}

Overall, the contribution of four variables were studied: two knee specimens; two points in the gait cycle; two averaging methods; and seven observers, to determine if variations in these values played a role in accurately quantifying the ROI. The relative error between the force ratio from each observer's ROI and the expert ROI was calculated as the output of interest.

The transmembrane pressure increased rapidly during the glycoconjugate filtration due to membrane fouling, with the rate of pressure increase being more pronounced in the pleated cartridge. Additional insights into the fouling behavior were obtained using confocal microscopy by in situ labeling of the glycoconjugate captured within the filter media using an Alexa Fluor fluorescent dye.

{"title": "Instantaneous discharge characteristics and its methane ignition mechanism of coal mine rock damage.", "abstract": "The goaf is the main site of gas explosions in coal mines. A large number of accidents indicate that the occurrence of gas explosion in the goaf is related to the deformation and fracture of the goaf roof. An experimental system was constructed to study the instantaneous discharge characteristics and its ignition mechanism caused by rock damage. The research results reveal that different rocks produce avalanche-like dust clouds ejected outward during the fracture process, and the generation process takes an extremely short time. This dust cloud is not caused by rock fragments heated to incandescence because of friction. The electric sparks produced in the process of rock rupture and the appearance of instantaneous discharge are related not only to the quartz content of the rock, but also to the compressive strength of the rock.

The proposed phononic crystal integrates fluidic elements. A solid block with periodic cylindrical holes contains a defect-a liquid-filled cylindrical cavity. We pay attention to acoustic excitation and the readout of the axisymmetric cylindrical resonator eigenmode of the liquid-filled defect in the middle of the phononic crystal structure. This mode solves the challenge of mechanical energy losses due to liquid viscosity. We also analyze the coupling effects between oscillations of liquid and solid systems and consider coupling issues between piezoelectric transducers and the liquid-filled cavity resonator. The numerical simulation of the propagation of acoustic waves through the phononic crystal sensor was carried out in COMSOL Multiphysics Software. The phononic crystal was made of stainless steel with mechanically drilled holes and was fabricated for experimental verification.

{"title": "Selective Detection of Liquid Viscosity Using Acoustic Plate Waves with In-Plane Polarization.", "abstract": "Using plates of weak piezoeletcric crystal (quartz) loaded with various liquids, it is shown that along with common modes, whose sensitivity towards different liquid parameters comparable with each other, there are some uncommon modes, whose amplitude responses towards viscosity \u03b7 are much larger than towards temperature T and electric conductivity \u03c3. The search of the modes with the selective properties is accomplished by varying plate thickness h, crystal orientation, wave length \u03bb, and mode order n. It is found that all modes possessing the property are characterized by small surface-normal displacement, avoiding wave radiation into adjacent liquid, large in-plane displacements, enhancing viscous coupling the modes and liquids, and small electro-mechanical constant, reducing electro-acoustic interaction. Basing on the modes, the sensor prototypes with selective operation are developed and tested for \u03b7 from 1 to 1500 cP, \u03c3 from 0 to 1.2 S/m, and t from 0 to 55 \u00b0C. Because of operation at ultrasonic frequency (tens MHz) the prototypes have different sensitivities in various \u03b7-ranges: 0.3 dB/cP for 1\u221220 cP, 0.12 dB/cP for 20\u2212100 cP, and 0.015 dB/cP for 100\u22121500 cP.

{"title": "Review of Recent Bio-Inspired Design and Manufacturing of Whisker Tactile Sensors.", "abstract": "Whisker sensors are a class of tactile sensors that have recently attracted attention. Inspired by mammals' whiskers known as mystacial vibrissae, they have displayed tremendous potential in a variety of applications e.g., robotics, underwater vehicles, minimally invasive surgeries, and leak detection. This paper provides a supplement to the recent tactile sensing techniques' designs of whiskers that only sense at their base, as well as the materials employed, and manufacturing techniques. The article delves into the technical specifications of these sensors, such as the resolution, measurement range, sensitivity, durability, and recovery time, which determine their performance. The sensors' sensitivity varies depending on the measured physical quantity; for example, the pressure sensors had an intermediate sensitivity of 58%/Pa and a response time of around 90 ms, whereas the force sensors that function based on piezoelectric effects exhibited good linearity in the measurements with a resolution of 3 \u00b5N and sensitivity of 0.1682 mV/\u00b5N. Some sensors were used to perform spatial mapping and the identification of the geometry and roughness of objects with a reported resolution of 25 nm. The durability and recovery time showed a wide range of values, with the maximum durability being 10,000 cycles and the shortest recovery time being 5 ms. Furthermore, the paper examines the fabrication of whiskers at the micro- and nanoscales, as well as their contributions to mechanical and thermal behavior. The commonly used manufacturing techniques of 3D printing, PDMS casting, and screen printing were used in addition to several micro and nanofabrication techniques such as photolithography, etching, and chemical vapor deposition. Lastly, the paper discusses the main potential applications of these sensors and potential research gaps in this field.

{"title": "Nonlinear Dynamics of a Star-Shaped Structure and Variable Configuration of Elastic Elements for Energy Harvesting Applications.", "abstract": "The subject of the model research contained in this paper is a new design solution of the energy harvesting system with a star-shaped structure of elastic elements and variable configuration. Numerical experiments focused mainly on the assessment of the configuration of elastic elements in the context of energy harvesting efficiency.

The article compares the energy efficiency for the selected range of the dimensionless excitation frequency. For this purpose, four cases of elastic element configurations were compared. The results are visualized based on the diagram of RMS voltage induced on piezoelectric electrodes, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, and Poincar\u00e9 maps, showing the impact of individual solutions on the efficiency of energy harvesting. The results of the simulations show that the harvester's efficiency ranges from 4 V to 20 V depending on the configuration and the frequency range of the excitation, but the design allows for a smooth adjustment to the given conditions.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-04-13", "authors": ["JerzyMargielewicz", "DamianG\u0105ska", "GrzegorzLitak", "PiotrWolszczak", "CarloTrigona"], "doi": "10.3390/s22072518\n10.24425/amm.2018.125129\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.05.024\n10.1016/j.jsv.2016.07.008\n10.1016/j.measurement.2021.109856\n10.1016/j.joule.2021.03.006\n10.1016/j.apm.2021.08.002\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.07.047\n10.1177/1045389X211006912\n10.1109/JPROC.2008.927494\n10.1016/j.nanoms.2021.04.001\n10.1016/j.jksus.2017.05.019\n10.1016/j.cnsns.2018.02.017\n10.3390/en14051284\n10.3390/e21050441\n10.1016/j.jsv.2005.08.018\n10.1002/9781119991151\n10.1109/TIM.2010.2089576\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.05.022\n10.1088/1742-6596/1736/1/012032\n10.1088/1361-665X/abaa95\n10.1016/j.eml.2018.04.003\n10.1063/2.1204309\n10.1063/1.4954169\n10.1016/j.physd.2017.04.003\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112356\n10.1016/j.jsv.2021.116014\n10.1016/j.energy.2021.120374\n10.1016/j.jsv.2022.116886\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118159\n10.1016/S0960-0779(04)00428-X"}
{"title": "Diffuse Ultrasonic Wave-Based Damage Detection of Railway Tracks Using PZT/FBG Hybrid Sensing System.", "abstract": "Damage detection of railway tracks is vital to ensure normal operation and safety of the rail transit system. Piezoelectric sensors, which are widely utilized to receive ultrasonic wave, may be disturbed in the railway system due to strong electromagnetic interference (EMI). In this work, a hybrid ultrasonic sensing system is proposed and validated by utilizing a lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) actuator and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor to evaluate damage conditions of the railway tracks. The conventional ultrasonic guided wave-based method utilizing direct wave to detect damages is limited by the complex data analysis procedure and low sensitivity to incipient damage. Diffuse ultrasonic wave (DUW), referring to later arrival wave packets, is chosen in this study to evaluate structural conditions of railway tracks due to its high sensitivity, wider sensing range, and easy implementation. Damages with different sizes and locations are introduced on the railway track to validate the sensitivity and sensing range of the proposed method. Two damage indices are defined from the perspective of energy attenuation and waveform distortion. The experimental results demonstrate that the DUW signals received by the hybrid sensing system could be used for damage detection of the railway tracks and the waveform-distortion-based index is more efficient than the energy-based index.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-04-13", "authors": ["XiangtaoSun", "ChuanruiGuo", "LeiYuan", "QingzhaoKong", "YiqingNi"], "doi": "10.3390/s22072504\n10.1121/1.2211587\n10.1177/1475921713498533\n10.1177/0954409716657848\n10.1109/TMAG.2015.2430283\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.3020907\n10.1093/tse/tdz007\n10.1061/jtepbs.0000026\n10.1177/1475921717742339\n10.1111/mice.12316\n10.1177/1475921720976941\n10.1177/1475921720922797\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.11.017\n10.1002/stc.1966\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.106922\n10.1177/1475921719893887\n10.3390/app11031071\n10.1126/science.1070015\n10.1007/s00024-005-0026-6\n10.1177/1475921719834045\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.04.012\n10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2020.110219\n10.1002/stc.2689\n10.1029/2004GL021143\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2016.01.006\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2019.105862\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2013.07.009\n10.1007/s10921-019-0563-z\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107063\n10.1177/1475921720905046\n10.1177/1475921718762323\n10.1121/1.2000827\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.254302\n10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106498\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561631\n10.1177/1475921717699878\n10.1016/j.ultras.2019.106031\n10.12989/sss.2020.26.2.227\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab6076\n10.1177/1475921718755572\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2903323\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2927381\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107140\n10.1109/IMOC.2017.8121109\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/1/314\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.926894\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2006.07.001\n10.1364/ao.56.007262\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.06.009\n10.1364/oe.20.028353\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.10.017\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.106858\n10.1177/14759217211013110\n10.1002/stc.2688\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.09.015\n10.3390/app6110341\n10.1016/j.ultras.2005.05.001\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.03.050\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2950748"}
{"title": "Detection of Highway Pavement Damage Based on a CNN Using Grayscale and HOG Features.", "abstract": "Aiming at the demand for rapid detection of highway pavement damage, many deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed. However, CNN methods with raw image data require a high-performance hardware configuration and cost machine time. To reduce machine time and to apply the detection methods in common scenarios, the CNN structure with preprocessed image data needs to be simplified. In this work, a detection method based on a CNN and the combination of the grayscale and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features is proposed. First, the Gamma correction was employed to highlight the grayscale distribution of the damage area, which compresses the space of normal pavement. The preprocessed image was then divided into several unit cells, whose grayscale and HOG were calculated, respectively. The grayscale and HOG of each unit cell were combined to construct the grayscale-weighted HOG (GHOG) feature patterns. These feature patterns were input to the CNN with a specific structure and parameters. The trained indices suggested that the performance of the GHOG-based method was significantly improved, compared with the traditional HOG-based method. Furthermore, the GHOG-feature-based CNN technique exhibited flexibility and effectiveness under the same accuracy, in comparison to those deep learning techniques that directly deal with raw data. Since the grayscale has a definite physical meaning, the present detection method possesses a potential application for the further detection of damage details in the future.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-04-13", "authors": ["Guo-HongChen", "JieNi", "ZhuoChen", "HaoHuang", "Yun-LeiSun", "Wai HungIp", "Kai LeungYung"], "doi": "10.3390/s22072455\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.126162\n10.3390/su14031825\n10.1016/j.aei.2011.01.002\n10.1111/mice.12412\n10.1109/TITS.2019.2931297\n10.1049/iet-ipr.2019.0973\n10.1080/14680629.2019.1615533\n10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3062070\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985216\n10.1016/j.aei.2021.101303\n10.1007/s10665-014-9742-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010331\n10.1016/j.patcog.2017.06.036\n10.1007/s00500-018-3076-2"}

{"title": "A Non-Resonant Piezoelectric-Electromagnetic-Triboelectric Hybrid Energy Harvester for Low-Frequency Human Motions.", "abstract": "With the rapid development of wireless communication and micro-power technologies, smart wearable devices with various functionalities appear more and more in our daily lives. Nevertheless, they normally possess short battery life and need to be recharged with external power sources with a long charging time, which seriously affects the user experience. To help extend the battery life or even replace it, a non-resonant piezoelectric-electromagnetic-triboelectric hybrid energy harvester is presented to effectively harvest energy from low-frequency human motions. In the designed structure, a moving magnet is used to simultaneously excite the three integrated energy collection units (i.e., piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and triboelectric) with a synergistic effect, such that the overall output power and energy-harvesting efficiency of the hybrid device can be greatly improved under various excitations. The experimental results show that with a vibration frequency of 4 Hz and a displacement of 200 mm, the hybrid energy harvester obtains a maximum output power of 26.17 mW at 70 k\u03a9 for one piezoelectric generator (PEG) unit, 87.1 mW at 500 \u03a9 for one electromagnetic generator (EMG) unit, and 63 \u03bcW at 140 M\u03a9 for one triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) unit, respectively. Then, the generated outputs are adopted for capacitor charging, which reveals that the performance of the three-unit integration is remarkably stronger than that of individual units. Finally, the practical energy-harvesting experiments conducted on various body parts such as wrist, calf, hand, and waist indicate that the proposed hybrid energy harvester has promising application potential in constructing a self-powered wearable system as the sustainable power source.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-04-13", "authors": ["GangTang", "ZhenWang", "XinHu", "ShaojieWu", "BinXu", "ZhibiaoLi", "XiaoxiaoYan", "FangXu", "DandanYuan", "PeishengLi", "QiongfengShi", "ChengkuoLee"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12071168\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106715\n10.1109/OJCAS.2021.3123272\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.08.024\n10.1088/1361-6439/ac168e\n10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171043\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/9/094011\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105525\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.011\n10.1063/1.5074184\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035005\n10.1063/1.4927466\n10.1002/adma.201400562\n10.1063/1.4948973\n10.1038/srep24946\n10.1177/1045389X12436739\n10.3390/mi9080395\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2411313\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2375354\n10.1109/TMAG.2015.2455041\n10.1063/1.4918688\n10.1002/adma.201505839\n10.3390/electronics8121526\n10.1002/advs.201901437\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104167\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.08.018\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2021.168819\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103871\n10.1038/srep41396\n10.1002/advs.202101834\n10.1007/s12274-021-3540-7\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105052\n10.34133/2021/6849171\n10.1016/j.isci.2020.101934\n10.1021/acsnano.6b01569\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.01.004\n10.1002/aenm.201802906\n10.1002/eom2.12058\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.002\n10.1002/adma.201802405\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104039\n10.1021/acsnano.5b02010\n10.1002/aenm.201701300\n10.1002/aenm.201702649\n10.1002/adma.201403944\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.07.006\n10.1021/acsnano.5b00534\n10.1021/nn502618f\n10.1002/adfm.201304211\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104760\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.03.015\n10.1126/science.aan3997\n10.1021/nn4063616\n10.1021/nn504243j\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115799\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104415\n10.1021/nn400361p\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.09.004\n10.1021/acsaelm.0c00302"}
{"title": "Synergistic Enhancement Properties of a Flexible Integrated PAN/PVDF Piezoelectric Sensor for Human Posture Recognition.", "abstract": "The flexible pressure sensor has attracted much attention due to its wearable and conformal advantage. All the same, enhancing its electrical and structural properties is still a huge challenge. Herein, a flexible integrated pressure sensor (FIPS) composed of a solid silicone rubber matrix, composited with piezoelectric powers of polyacrylonitrile/Polyvinylidene fluoride (PAN/PVDF) and conductive silver-coated glass microspheres is first proposed. Specifically, the mass ratio of the PAN/PVDF and the rubber is up to 4:5 after mechanical mixing. The output voltage of the sensor with composite PAN/PVDF reaches 49 V, which is 2.57 and 3.06 times that with the single components, PAN and PVDF, respectively. In the range from 0 to 800 kPa, its linearity of voltage and current are all close to 0.986. Meanwhile, the sensor retains high voltage and current sensitivities of 42 mV/kPa and 0.174 nA/kPa, respectively.

{"title": "Implementing the Reactor Geometry in the Modeling of Chemical Bath Deposition of ZnO Nanowires.", "abstract": "The formation of nanowires by chemical bath deposition is of great interest for a wide variety of optoelectronic, piezoelectric, and sensing devices, from which the theoretical description of their elongation process has emerged as a critical issue. Despite its strong influence on the nanowire growth kinetics, reactor size has typically not been taken into account in the theoretical modeling developed so far. We report a new theoretical description of the axial growth rate of nanowires in dynamic conditions based on the solution of Fick's diffusion equations, implementing a sealed reactor of finite height as a varying parameter. The theoretical model is applied in various chemical bath deposition conditions in the case of the growth of ZnO nanowires, from which the influence of the reactor height is investigated and compared to experimental data. In particular, it is found that the use of reactor heights smaller than 2 cm significantly decreases the ZnO nanowires' axial growth rate in typical experimental conditions due to the faster depletion of reactants. The present approach is further used predictively, showing its high potential for the design of batch reactors for a wide variety of chemical precursors and semiconductor materials in applied research and industrial production.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-04-13", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mentLausecker", "BassemSalem", "XavierBaillin", "VincentConsonni"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12071069\n10.1002/adfm.200500468\n10.1039/b616684a\n10.1016/j.cap.2010.07.007\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/33/332001\n10.1007/s12274-014-0661-2\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab1f2e\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.059\n10.1557/mrs.2018.263\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab268a\n10.1002/anie.200351461\n10.1021/jp010026s\n10.1039/b205384e\n10.1002/1521-4095(20020903)14:17>3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1002/adma.200305327\n10.1002/adma.200390108\n10.1557/mrs2010.507\n10.1007/s12274-011-0160-7\n10.1021/cg900082u\n10.1021/la105147u\n10.1021/jp507496a\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b00479\n10.1021/nl050788p\n10.1021/jp308643w\n10.1021/cg2002755\n10.1021/nn500620t\n10.1038/s41598-017-15447-w\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab1d6e\n10.1021/cg900021u\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b04625\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b00935\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b08958\n10.1021/acs.cgd.0c00144\n10.1002/andp.18551700105\n10.1002/(SICI)1099-1204(199805/06)11:33.0.CO;2-C\n10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b01916\n10.1016/0016-7037(88)90057-9\n10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02242.x\n10.1021/nn900523p\n10.1016/S0022-0728(00)00378-8\n10.1016/j.cis.2008.01.007"}

{"title": "Piezoelectric Fibers: Processing and Challenges.", "abstract": "Integration of piezoelectric materials in composite and textile structures is promising for creating smart textiles with sensing or energy harvesting functionalities. The most direct integration that combines wearability, comfort, and piezoelectric efficiency consists of using fibers made of piezoelectric materials. The latter include inorganic ceramics or organic polymers. Ceramics have outstanding piezoelectric properties but can not be easily melted or solubilized in a solvent to be processed in the form of fibers. They have to be spun from precursor materials and thermally treated afterward for densification and sintering. These delicate processes have to be carefully controlled to optimize the piezoelectric properties of the fibers. On the other hand, organic piezoelectric polymers, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), can be spun by more conventional textile fibers technologies. In addition to enjoy an easier manufacturing, organic piezoelectric fibers display flexibility that facilitates their integration and use in smart textiles. However, organic fibers suffer from a low piezoelectric efficiency. This reviews looks at the processing techniques and their specific limitations and advantages to realize single-component or coaxial piezofibers. Fundamental challenges related to the use of composite fibers are discussed. The latter include challenges for poling and electrically wiring the fibers to collect charges under operation or to apply electrical fields. The electromechanical properties of these fibers processed by different manufacturing techniques are compared. Recent studies of structures used to integrate such fibers in textiles and composites with conventional techniques and their potential applications are discussed.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-04-12", "authors": ["SarahScheffler", "PhilippePoulin"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.1c24611"}

In addition, polyaniline/graphene (PAG) nanoparticles were synthesized and added to gelatin solutions in different percentages to induce electrical conductivity. After obtaining optimum PAG percentage, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) treatment was applied over the best samples by different plasma variable parameters.

{"title": "Tonic endocannabinoid signaling supports sleep through development in both sexes.", "abstract": "Sleep is an essential behavior that supports brain function and cognition throughout life, in part by acting on neuronal synapses. The synaptic signaling pathways that mediate the restorative benefits of sleep are not fully understood, particularly in the context of development. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) including 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), are bioactive lipids that activate cannabinoid receptor, CB1, to regulate synaptic transmission and mediate cognitive functions and many behaviors, including sleep. We used targeted mass spectrometry to measure changes in forebrain synaptic eCBs during the sleep/wake cycle in juvenile and adolescent mice of both sexes. We find that eCBs lack a daily rhythm in juvenile mice, while in adolescents AEA and related oleoyl ethanolamide are increased during the sleep phase in a circadian manner. Next, we manipulated the eCB system using selective pharmacology and measured the effects on sleep behavior in developing and adult mice of both sexes using a noninvasive piezoelectric home-cage recording apparatus. Enhancement of eCB signaling through inhibition of 2-AG or AEA degradation, increased dark-phase sleep amount and bout length in developing and adult males, but not in females. Inhibition of CB1 by injection of the antagonist AM251 reduced sleep time and caused sleep fragmentation in developing and adult males and females. Our data suggest that males are more sensitive to the sleep-promoting effects of enhanced eCBs but that tonic eCB signaling supports sleep behavior through multiple stages of development in both sexes.

{"title": "Association of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Use With Abnormal Physical Movement Patterns as Detected Using a Piezoelectric Accelerometer and Deep Learning in a Nationally Representative Sample of Noninstitutionalized Persons in the US.", "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a common first-line treatment for some psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety; although they are generally well tolerated, SSRIs have known adverse effects, including movement problems, sleep disruption, and gastrointestinal problems (eg, nausea and upset stomach). No large-scale studies using naturalistic, longitudinal, objective data have validated physical activity findings, and actigraphy data are well suited to address this task.\nTo evaluate whether differences in physical movement exist among individuals treated with SSRIs compared with control participants and to identify the unique features of the movement of patients treated with SSRIs.\nThis cross-sectional study examines longitudinally collected wearable movement data within a cross-sectional sample of 7162 participants from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative population-based sample of noninstitutionalized persons in the US having both medication information and passive movement data. Statistical analysis was performed from April 1, 2021, to February 1, 2022.\nThe use of SSRIs (sertraline hydrochloride, escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride, and citalopram hydrobromide), as reported by participants interviewed by NNHANES personnel, was the primary exposure, measured as a binary variable (taking an SSRI vs not taking an SSRI).\nThe primary outcome was the intensity of body movement as recorded by a piezoelectric accelerometer worn on the right hip for more than 1 week.\nOf the 7162 participants included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 33.7 (22.6) years, 266 (3.7%) were taking an SSRI, 3706 (51.7%) were female, 1934 (27.0%) were Black, 1823 (25.5%) were Mexican American, 210 (2.9%) were other Hispanic, 336 (4.7%) were other or multiracial, and 2859 (39.9%) were White (per the NHANES data collection protocol). A cross-validated, deep learning classifier was constructed that achieved fair performance predicting SSRI use (area under the curve, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.64-0.71] for the validation set and 0.66 [95% CI, 0.64-0.68] for the test set). To account for possible confounding by indication, we constructed a parallel model incorporating depression severity, finding only marginal performance improvement. When averaged across individuals and across 7 days, the results show less overall movement in the SSRI group (mean, 120.1 vertical acceleration counts/min [95% CI, 115.7-124.6 vertical acceleration counts/min]) compared with the non-SSRI control group (mean, 168.8 vertical acceleration counts/min [95% CI, 162.8-174.9 vertical acceleration counts/min]).\nThis cross-sectional study found a moderate association between passive movement and SSRI use, as well as SSRI detection capacity of passive movement using time series deep learning models.

The present study used preoperative virtual planning to establish a surgical cutting guide for pterygomaxillary osteotomy. It was placed in the maxillary tuberosity supported by molars, and a flapless vertical osteotomy was performed with a piezoelectric saw. Then, maxillary down-fracture was performed with slight pressure through an anterior approach. The use of the surgical guide added accuracy and predictability to the procedure, with no prolongation of the surgery time. There were no undesired fractures or bleeding. Regarding manipulation of the surgical guide in the posterior area, it was found to be easily manageable and very stable over the posterior teeth, due to its small size and precision, respectively. In conclusion, this technique seems to improve the accuracy of pterygomaxillary disjunction without prolonging the surgery time.

{"title": "Design, fabrication, and characterization of a multimodal reconfigurable bioreactor for bone tissue engineering.", "abstract": "In the past decades, bone tissue engineering developed and exploited many typologies of bioreactors, which, besides providing proper culture conditions, aimed at integrating those bio-physical stimulations that cells experience in vivo, to promote osteogenic differentiation. Nevertheless, the highly challenging combination and deployment of many stimulation systems into a single bioreactor led to the generation of several unimodal bioreactors, investigating one or at mostly two of the required biophysical stimuli. These systems miss the physiological mimicry of bone cells environment, and often produced contrasting results, thus making the knowledge of bone mechanotransduction fragmented and often inconsistent. To overcome this issue, in this study we developed a perfusion and electroactive-vibrational reconfigurable stimulation bioreactor to investigate the differentiation of SaOS-2 bone-derived cells, hosting a piezoelectric nanocomposite membrane as cell culture substrate. This multimodal perfusion bioreactor is designed based on a numerical (finite element) model aimed at assessing the possibility to induce membrane nano-scaled vibrations (with ~12\u2009nm amplitude at a frequency of 939\u2009kHz) during perfusion (featuring 1.46\u2009dyn\u2009cm", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2022-04-07", "authors": ["MargheritaMontorsi", "Giada GGenchi", "DanieleDe Pasquale", "GiorgioDe Simoni", "EdoardoSinibaldi", "GianniCiofani"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.28100"}

{"title": "A Low-Voltage Cylindrical Traveling Wave Ultrasonic Motor Incorporating Multilayered Piezoelectric Ceramics.", "abstract": "In-plane bending traveling wave ultrasonic motors (USM), which are compact in structure and flexible in design, have been widely applied in biological engineering, optical engineering, and aerospace engineering. However, the high driving voltage and complicated driving circuit of this kind of USM restrict their further miniaturization and electromechanical integration in these applications and bring some potential safety hazards. To solve this problem, a low-voltage-driving traveling wave USM incorporating cofired multilayer piezoelectric ceramics was proposed in this work. Four cofired piezoelectric ceramics were strategically designed to excite two orthogonal third-order in-plane bending modes with the same frequency of the USM. The principles of traveling wave synthesis and low-voltage-driving of the USM were deduced, and the stator dynamic design and transient dynamic simulation were carried out by finite-element method. The microproperties of cofired piezoelectric multilayer ceramics, the vibration characteristics of the stator, and the mechanical output performance of the USM were tested by experiments. The results indicated that the motor can work as low as 5 [Formula: see text]. A long stroke with a maximum forward and reverse rotational speeds of 187.7 and 176.6 r/min were obtained, respectively, and a maximum stalling torque of 4.8 mN \u00b7 m at 47.3 kHz under 15 [Formula: see text] was achieved. The results showed that the proposed USM is small, low in driving voltage, and high in torque output, which has promising applications in aerospace, biomedicine, and other fields that require a lightweight and integration of driving devices.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-04-06", "authors": ["ZhiyiWen", "XiaoniuLi", "TengCao", "BoquanWang", "RuixuanLiu", "DaweiWu"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3164940"}

This paper demonstrates a high data-rate intrabody communication link based on Lithium Niobate (LN) Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (pMUTs). The properties of the LN allow to activate multiple flexural mode of vibration with only top electrodes. When operating in materials like the human tissue, these modes are merging and forming a large communication bandwidth. Such large bandwidth, up to 400\u2009kHz, allows for a high-data rate communication link for IMDs. Here we demonstrate a full communication link in a tissue phantom with a fabricated LN pMUT array of 225 elements with an area of just 3 by 3\u2009mm square, showing data-rates up to 800\u2009kbits/s, starting from 3.5\u2009cm and going up to 13.5\u2009cm, which covers the vast majority of IMDs.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2022-04-06", "authors": ["FlaviusPop", "BernardHerrera", "MatteoRinaldi"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-022-29355-9\n10.1007/s11036-010-0260-8\n10.4018/IJTD.2020010102\n10.1109/TBME.2017.2668612\n10.1109/TMC.2016.2561277\n10.1063/1.366015\n10.1063/1.4909508\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.11.041\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2797684\n10.1177/0161734612464451\n10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2552538\n10.4031/002533208786861326\n10.1109/JMEMS.2017.2712101\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2878785\n10.1007/s11548-014-0987-y\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.12.005\n10.1109/JSSC.2015.2427336\n10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594459"}

{"title": "Polyoxometalate Functionalized Sensors: A Review.", "abstract": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of metal oxide complexes with a large structural diversity. Effective control of the final chemical and physical properties of POMs could be provided by fine-tuning chemical modifications, such as the inclusion of other metals or non-metal ions. In addition, the nature and type of the counterion can also impact POM properties, like solubility. Besides, POMs may combine with carbon materials as graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide or carbon nanotubes to enhance electronic conductivity, with noble metal nanoparticles to increase catalytic and functional sites, be introduced into metal-organic frameworks to increase surface area and expose more active sites, and embedded into conducting polymers. The possibility to design POMs to match properties adequate for specific sensing applications turns them into highly desirable chemicals for sensor sensitive layers. This review intends to provide an overview of POM structures used in sensors (electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric), highlighting their main functional features. Furthermore, this review aims to summarize the reported applications of POMs in sensors for detecting and determining analytes in different matrices, many of them with biochemical and clinical relevance, along with analytical figures of merit and main virtues and problems of such devices.

{"title": "Loss of detection of fatty acid-metabolizing proteins in Western blot analyses - Impact of sample heating.", "abstract": "When performing western blots for protein detection using the classical Laemmli method, experimenters often encounter difficulties with the detection of transmembrane proteins involved in lipid or fatty acid metabolism. A crucial phase in sample preparation is heating the samples to 100\u00a0\u00b0C in a Laemmli sample buffer containing SDS before separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). In the current study, the analysis of several proteins was performed following modifications of the heating step during sample preparation. Multiple samples of the human Jurkat cell line were prepared using commercial or homemade Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to incubation at different temperatures for varying periods of time prior to separation by SDS-PAGE, transfer onto PVDF membranes and detection with specific antibodies. In samples incubated at temperatures of 25\u00a0\u00b0C, 40\u00a0\u00b0C, 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0\u00b0C, detection of the transmembrane protein elongase of long chain fatty acids 5 (ELOVL5) significantly decreased with temperature to a near total absence of signal at 100\u00a0\u00b0C. Heating (100\u00a0\u00b0C) the samples even for 1\u00a0min resulted in significant loss of ELOVL5 band intensity that was associated with the appearance of higher molecular weight immunoreactive materials. Loss of ELOVL5 band intensity was also observed with heating of samples at 100\u00a0\u00b0C prepared from HepG2, HEK293, MCF-7 and SKRB cells. The robust induction of ELOVL5 in stimulated primary T cells was not detected when sample were heated. The detection of fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligases 3 and 4 showed bands with significantly less intensity after heating at 100\u00a0\u00b0C compared to samples prepared at room temperature. Heating samples at 100\u00a0\u00b0C did not affect the detection of transmembrane proteins ERBB2 and five-lipoxygenase activating protein, or the soluble 5-lipoxygenase protein. Overall, the number of transmembrane passes of a protein was not predictive of loss of band intensity after heating, however this study indicates that sample heating can drastically affect the ability to detect proteins following separation by SDS-PAGE. This has implications for any detection methods that follow SDS-PAGE.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2022-04-04", "authors": ["Roody SBiam", "Philippe-PierreRobichaud", "MarouaMbarik", "PaskalePineau", "Marc ESurette"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.130"}
{"title": "Research on a large opening and high flow rate piezoelectric pump with straight arm wheeled check valve.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric pumps are applied in cooling systems of microelectronic devices because of their small size. However, cooling efficiency is limited by the low flow rate. A straight arm wheeled check valve made of silica gel was proposed, which can improve the flow rate of piezoelectric pumps, solve the influence of glue aging on the sealing ability of a wheeled check valve, and reduce the size of piezoelectric pumps. This paper discusses the influence of the valve arm number (N = 2, 3, and 4), the valve arm width (W = 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4\u00a0mm), and the valve thickness (T = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0\u00a0mm) on the flow rate characteristics of piezoelectric pumps. When valve opening rises, the flow rate increases. The simulation results show that valves with 2 valve arm number, 0.6\u00a0mm valve thickness, and 1.0\u00a0mm valve arm width have maximum valve opening. The experimental results show that piezoelectric pumps with different valve parameters have different optimal frequencies. In addition, the maximum flow rate is 431.6 ml/min at 220\u00a0V and 70\u00a0Hz.

This paper reports a high-speed piezoelectric direct-drive flow control valve with an enhanced flow rate by introducing a new push-pull complementary compliant mechanism. An improved semi-rhombus compliant amplifying mechanism is designed to amplify the microstroke of piezo-stacks with an enhanced resonance frequency. To facilitate the design, the dynamic stiffness model of the compliant amplifying mechanism is derived and the structural parameters are optimized using the Pareto multi-objective optimization strategy. In addition, a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based high-response displacement sensor with an improved differential charge amplifier circuit is developed and integrated into the valve to measure the spool displacement in real time. A proof-of-concept prototype is fabricated, and the flow characteristics are experimentally tested in a closed-loop control with the PVDF sensor. The flow rate and dynamic bandwidth of the presented piezo-valve are evidently enhanced, reaching the dynamic bandwidth in excess of 920 Hz (-3 dB) and the flow rate of \u00b16 l/min (corresponding stroke is 0.2 mm) under the supply pressure of 70 bars.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2022-04-03", "authors": ["LisongDeng", "MingxiangLing"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0067483"}

The negative value of the piezo-optical anisotropy ratio of the used material allowed for the development of a Faraday isolator with compensation of thermally induced depolarization without a reciprocal rotator. The potential of single-crystal silicon as a magneto-optical material for Faraday isolators operating at room as well as at cryogenic temperatures in high-power laser radiation was considered. It was shown that single-crystal silicon is highly promising for the development of Faraday devices, including ones for next-generation laser interferometers aimed at detecting gravitational waves.", "journal": "Optics letters", "date": "2022-04-02", "authors": ["IlyaSnetkov", "AlexeyYakovlev"], "doi": "10.1364/OL.452218"}
{"title": "Speaking-Induced Charge-Laden Face Masks with Durable Protectiveness and Wearing Breathability.", "abstract": "Face masks, which serve as personal protection equipment, have become ubiquitous for combating the ongoing COVID-19. However, conventional electrostatic-based mask filters are disposable and short-term effective with high breathing resistance, causing respiratory ailments and massive consumption (129 billion monthly), intensifying global environmental pollution. In an effort to address these challenges, the introduction of a piezoelectric polymer was adopted to realize the charge-laden melt-blown via the melt-blowing method. The charge-laden melt-blown could be applied to manufacture face masks and to generate charges triggered by mechanical and acoustic energy originated from daily speaking. Through an efficient and scalable industrial melt-blown process, our charge-laden mask is capable of overcoming the inevitable electrostatic attenuation, even in a high-humidity atmosphere by long-wearing (prolonging from 4 to 72 h) and three-cycle common decontamination methods. Combined with outstanding protective properties (PM", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-04-02", "authors": ["DanChen", "LianweiTang", "YunmingWang", "YongyaoTan", "YueFu", "WeihaoCai", "ZhaohanYu", "ShuangSun", "JiaqiZheng", "JingqiangCui", "GuoshengWang", "YangLiu", "HuaminZhou"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c01077"}

We found that the most effective SAW excitation takes place when spontaneous polarization occurs in the film plane and the wave propagates along the direction adjacent to the direction of the spontaneous polarization vector. Based on a nonlinear model of phase transitions in solid BST solutions, the dependency of the material constants of piezo-effect equations on the misfit strain with a fixed concentration was obtained numerically. The effect of various misfit strains on SAW characteristics was studied for the film located on single-crystal silicon. It was shown that the effectiveness of SAW excitation increases as the misfit strain nears the boundary of phase transition.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-03-31", "authors": ["Vladimir BShirokov", "Pavel ETimoshenko", "Valery VKalinchuk"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3163610"}

{"title": "High magnetoelectric coupling of Metglas and P(VDF-TrFE) laminates.", "abstract": "Magnetoelectric (magnetic/piezoelectric) heterostructures bring new functionalities to develop novel transducer devices such as (wireless) sensors or energy harvesters and thus have been attracting research interest in the last years. We have studied the magnetoelectric coupling between Metglas films (2826\u00a0MB) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) in a laminate structure. The metallic Metglas film itself served as bottom electrode and as top electrode we used an electrically conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Besides a direct electrical wiring via a graphite ink, a novel contactless readout method is presented using a capacitive coupling between the PEDOT:PSS layer and an electrode not in contact with the PEDOT:PSS layer. From the experimental result we determined a magnetoelectric coupling of 1445\u00a0V/(cm\u00b7Oe) at the magnetoelastic resonance of the structure, which is among the highest reported values for laminate structures of a magnetostrictive and a piezoelectric polymer layer. With the noncontact readout method, a magnetoelectric coupling of about 950\u00a0V/(cm\u00b7Oe) could be achieved, which surpasses previously reported values for the case of direct sample contacting. 2D laser Doppler vibrometer measurements in combination with FE simulations were applied to reveal the complex vibration pattern resulting in the strong resonant response.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-03-30", "authors": ["HenrikStaaf", "AnurakSawatdee", "CristinaRusu", "DavidNilsson", "PhilippSch\u00e4ffner", "ChristerJohansson"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-09171-3\n10.1080/00150197608241997\n10.3390/s17061251\n10.1039/C7SE00403F\n10.1039/C9EE03902C\n10.1002/ente.201800852\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b05058\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.04.033\n10.1002/adfm.201202780\n10.1109/TMAG.2021.3086635\n10.1063/1.2337996\n10.1063/1.3660767\n10.1063/1.5013235\n10.1088/0022-3727/44/49/495303\n10.1039/C5RA04409J\n10.3390/nano11051154\n10.1021/acsami.5b04102\n10.1063/1.4940382\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.08.009\n10.3390/s20700294\n10.3390/s110302809\n10.5772/intechopen.70523\n10.1109/TMAG.1986.1064381\n10.1006/jsvi.1996.0779\n10.1590/1679-78253222"}

Upper cranial nerves such as the trigeminal nerve and other nerves responsible for sensory/motor functions in the head may be potential targets for ultrasound pain therapy. The location of upper cranial nerves close to the skull base poses additional challenges when compared with conventional cortical or middle brain targets. In the work described here, a series of computational and empirical testing methods using human skull specimens were conducted to assess the feasibility of sonicating the trigeminal pathway near the sphenoid bone region. The results indicate a transducer with a focal length of 120 mm and diameter of 85 mm (350 kHz) can deliver sonication to upper cranial nerve regions with spatial accuracy comparable to that of focused ultrasound brain targets used in previous human studies. Temperature measurements in cortical bone and in the skull base with embedded thermocouples yield evidence of minimal bone heating. Conventional pulse parameters were found to cause reverberation interference patterns near the cranial floor; therefore, changes in pulse cycles and pulse repetition frequency were examined for reducing standing waves.

{"title": "Sensitivity-Bandwidth Optimization of PMUT with Acoustical Matching Using Finite Element Method.", "abstract": "A new model in finite element method to study round-trip performance of piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (pMUTs) is established. Most studies on the performance of pMUT are based only on the transmission sensibility, but the reception capacity is as much important as the transmission one, and is quite different from this latter. In this work, the round-trip sensitivity of pMUT is defined as the product of the frequency response of transmitted far field pressure to source voltage excitation and that of reception output to return wave pressure. Based on this sensitivity characteristic, firstly, a multi-parameter optimization for a cavity pMUT is performed using the sensitivity-bandwidth product parameter SBW as criterion. The radii of the electrode and the piezoelectric layer, the thicknesses of the piezoelectric layer and the vibration diaphragm are adjusted to maximize the performance. Secondly, an acoustic matching method is proposed and applied to pMUTs for the first time. As a result, the round-trip sensitivity can be evaluated and the pulse-echo response of wide-band excitation can be simulated, giving the most quantitative and intuitive feedback for pMUT design. The optimization enhances the sensitivity-bandwidth product by 52% when the top electrode and piezoelectric layer are both etched to 75% radius of the cavity beneath; the introduction of an acoustic matching layer shows significant bandwidth expansion in both the transmitting and receiving process.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-03-27", "authors": ["Le-MingHe", "Wei-JiangXu", "YanWang", "JiaZhou", "Jun-YanRen"], "doi": "10.3390/s22062307\n10.1177/0846537120940684\n10.3390/mi8070210\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa851b\n10.1109/JSSC.2016.2604291\n10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2387154\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563270\n10.3390/s21010157\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006725\n10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2525802\n10.1109/JMEMS.2020.3026547\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1320834\n10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1588408\n10.3390/s19204450\n10.1109/JMEMS.2020.3037298\n10.1088/1361-665X/abee37\n10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2039697\n10.1080/00319100500192889\n10.1006/jcph.1994.1159\n10.1016/S0021-9991(03)00005-6\n10.1109/JMEMS.2017.2712101\n10.3390/s150408020\n10.3390/s20144051\n10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2358991\n10.1002/pssc.200673503"}
{"title": "Structural Damage Detection through EMI and Wave Propagation Techniques Using Embedded PZT Smart Sensing Units.", "abstract": "Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) sensors have become popular in structural health monitoring (SHM) using the electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique for damage identification. The vibrations generated during the casting process in concrete structures substantially impact the conductance signature's (real part of admittance) magnitude and sensitivity. The concept of smart sensing units (SSU) is presented, composed of a PZT patch, an adhesive layer, and a steel plate. It is embedded in the concrete structure to study the impact of damage since it has high sensitivity to detect any structural changes, resulting in a high electrical conductance signature. The conductance signatures are obtained from the EMI technique at the damage state in the 10-500 kHz high-frequency range. The wave propagation technique proposes implementing the novel embedded SSUs to detect damage in the host structure. The numerical simulation is carried out with COMSOL multiphysics, and the received voltage signal is compared between the damaged and undamaged concrete beam with the applied actuation signal. A five-cycle sine burst modulated by a Hanning window is employed as the transient excitation signal. For numerical investigation, six cases are explored to better understand how the wave travels when a structural discontinuity is accounted for. The changes in the received signal during actuator-receiver mode in the damage state of the host structure are quantified using time of flight (TOF). Furthermore, the numerical studies are carried out by combining the EMI-WP technique, which implies synchronous activation of EMI-based measurements and wave stimulation. The fundamental idea is to implement EMI-WP to improve the effectiveness of SSU patches in detecting both near-field and far-field damage in structures. One SSU is used as an EMI admittance sensor for local damage identification.

{"title": "An Electromechanical Model for Clamped-Edge Bimorph Disk Type Piezoelectric Transformer Utilizing Kirchhoff Thin Plate Theory.", "abstract": "In this paper, an analytical solution for a clamped-edge bimorph disk-type piezoelectric transformer with Kirchhoff thin plate theory is proposed. The electromechanical equations for transient motions are first derived, and coupled expressions for mechanical response and voltage output are obtained. For the case of excitation around the first resonant frequency, the resulting equations are further simplified. There are analytical solutions for a mechanical response, voltage, current, and power outputs. According to the analytical model, the output voltage is affected by the inner radius of the input and output electrodes, the radius of the piezoelectric transformer (PT), and the thickness ratio between the lead zirconate titanate (PZT) layer and the substrate. When the inner radius of the input electrode approaches zero (electrode becomes circular shape), it achieves maximum output voltage at the first resonance frequency excitation. On the contrary, when the inner radius of the output electrode approaches zero, the output voltage reaches its minimum value. Voltage ratios remain constant as the disk radius changes, and the first resonance frequency is inversely proportional to the square of the disk radius. The voltage ratio is fixed even with the miniaturization of the PT.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-03-27", "authors": ["Shao-EnChen", "HadiGunawan", "Chia-CheWu"], "doi": "10.3390/s22062237\n10.3390/act5020012\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.04.014\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.10.062\n10.1109/TPEL.2018.2877699\n10.3938/jkps.58.627\n10.1109/TPEL.2015.2482990\n10.3813/AAA.918919\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.02.008\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006719\n10.1007/s41779-018-0206-3\n10.35848/1347-4065/abb4be\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/4/045018\n10.1080/10584580590964574\n10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2727\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.07.009\n10.1115/1.2890402\n10.1007/s00542-012-1495-z\n10.1177/1045389X07085639\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.10.040\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2284\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.06.009\n10.1093/comjnl/10.4.402\n10.1007/s11139-018-0070-3\n10.1080/10586458.1992.10504564"}

{"title": "Effect of the Dynamic Response of a Side-Wall Pressure Measurement System on Determining the Pressure Step Signal in a Shock Tube Using a Time-of-Flight Method.", "abstract": "Technological progress demands accurate measurements of rapidly changing pressures. This, in turn, requires the use of dynamically calibrated pressure meters. The shock tube enables the dynamic characterization by applying an almost ideal pressure step change to the pressure sensor under calibration. This paper evaluates the effect of the dynamic response of a side-wall pressure measurement system on the detection of shock wave passage times over the side-wall pressure sensors installed along the shock tube. Furthermore, it evaluates this effect on the reference pressure step signal determined at the end-wall of the driven section using a time-of-flight method. To determine the errors in the detection of the shock front passage times over the centers of the side-wall sensors, a physical model for simulating the dynamic response of the complete measurement chain to the passage of the shock wave was developed. Due to the fact that the use of the physical model requires information about the effective diameter of the pressure sensor, special attention was paid to determining the effective diameter of the side-wall pressure sensors installed along the shock tube. The results show that the relative systematic errors in the pressure step amplitude at the end-wall of the shock tube due to the errors in the detection of the shock front passage times over the side-wall pressure sensors are less than 0.0003%. On the other hand, the systematic errors in the phase lag of the end-wall pressure signal in the calibration frequency range appropriate for high-frequency dynamic pressure applications are up to a few tens of degrees. Since the target phase measurement uncertainty of the pressure sensors used in high-frequency dynamic pressure applications is only a few degrees, the corrections for the systematic errors in the detection of the shock front passage times over the side-wall pressure sensors with the use of the developed physical dynamic model are, therefore, necessary when performing dynamic calibrations of pressure sensors with a shock tube.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-03-27", "authors": ["AndrejSvete", "Francisco JavierHern\u00e1ndez Castro", "Jo\u017eeKutin"], "doi": "10.3390/s22062103\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2005.08.001\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2016.02.001\n10.1016/j.ast.2016.04.016\n10.1016/j.ast.2017.10.021\n10.1016/j.ast.2019.02.002\n10.1016/j.ast.2020.105772\n10.1016/j.ast.2021.106838\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2021.100763\n10.1088/0026-1394/50/6/631\n10.1098/rsta.2013.0299\n10.1088/1681-7575/aaad1b\n10.1088/1361-6501/aaa664\n10.1088/1742-6596/1065/16/162013\n10.1088/1681-7575/ab8fb9\n10.1007/s00340-020-07519-z\n10.3390/s21134470\n10.1088/0034-4885/25/1/308\n10.1088/0026-1394/51/3/326\n10.1088/1361-6501/aaa514\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.08.035\n10.1016/j.isatra.2020.10.022\n10.1016/j.ast.2020.106302\n10.1139/p71-240\n10.1007/PL00004051\n10.1063/1.3058609\n10.1007/s00193-009-0205-y\n10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.03.023\n10.1088/0026-1394/52/1/48\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107015\n10.1088/1681-7575/ab7f99\n10.1088/1681-7575/ab8f79\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108014\n10.1177/0142331219880700\n10.1109/TIM.1982.6312529\n10.1109/19.69956"}

However, the missing detection of damage occurs occasionally due to the angular scattering characteristic of Lamb waves. To solve this problem, a novel baseline-free damage detection approach based on path scanning at the detection region edges using mobile piezoelectric transducers is proposed herein. Several sensing points carrying separated damage scattering signals were picked out from the scanning paths. By removing the direct and boundary reflected signals, the damage signals were extracted and exported to a delay-and-sum imaging method to locate the damage. Two experiments with and without mobile transducers were conducted to validate the proposed method on an aluminum plate with artificially fabricated crack-like damage. The results show that the proposed baseline-free approach can locate the crack-like damage with high accuracy and efficiency and avoid potential loss of damage information.

{"title": "Double-Focusing Gradient-Index Lens with Elastic Bragg Mirror for Highly Efficient Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "The applicability of piezoelectric energy harvesting is increasingly investigated in the field of renewable energy. In improving harvester efficiency, manipulating elastic waves through a geometric configuration as well as upgrading harvester elements is important. Periodic structures, such as phononic crystals and metamaterials, are extensively employed to control elastic waves and enhance harvesting performance, particularly in terms of wave localization and focusing. In this study, we propose a double-focusing flexural energy harvesting platform consisting of a gradient-index lens and elastic Bragg mirror. Based on the design process, the frequency and time response of the harvesting platform are analyzed. The results indicate that the output voltage and power calculated at 1800 \u03a9 are 7.9 and 62 times higher than those observed in the bare plate, respectively. Even when compared to the existing gradient-index system, they are 1.5 and 2.3 times higher, respectively.

{"title": "Pulse-Atomic Force Lithography: A Powerful Nanofabrication Technique to Fabricate Constant and Varying-Depth Nanostructures.", "abstract": "The widespread use of nanotechnology in different application fields, resulting in the integration of nanostructures in a plethora of devices, has addressed the research toward novel and easy-to-setup nanofabrication techniques to realize nanostructures with high spatial resolution and reproducibility. Owing to countless applications in molecular electronics, data storage, nanoelectromechanical, and systems for the Internet of Things, in recent decades, the scientific community has focused on developing methods suitable for nanopattern polymers. To this purpose, Atomic Force Microscopy-based nanolithographic techniques are effective methods that are relatively less complex and inexpensive than equally resolute and accurate techniques, such as Electron Beam lithography and Focused Ion Beam lithography. In this work, we propose an evolution of nanoindentation, named Pulse-Atomic Force Microscopy, to obtain continuous structures with a controlled depth profile, either constant or variable, on a polymer layer. Due to the modulation of the characteristics of voltage pulses fed to the AFM piezo-scanner and distance between nanoindentations, it was possible to indent sample surface with high spatial control and fabricate highly resolved 2.5D nanogrooves. That is the real strength of the proposed technique, as no other technique can achieve similar results in tailor-made graded nanogrooves without the need for additional manufacturing steps.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-03-27", "authors": ["PaoloPellegrino", "Alessandro PaoloBramanti", "IsabellaFarella", "MariafrancescaCascione", "ValeriaDe Matteis", "AntonioDella Torre", "FabioQuaranta", "RosariaRinaldi"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12060991\n10.3390/polym11101590\n10.1038/nnano.2014.157\n10.3390/mi8030090\n10.1021/nl101675s\n10.1016/j.msea.2004.04.070\n10.1143/JJAP.47.712\n10.1088/0957-4484/10/4/317\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.08.134\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2017.07.016\n10.1088/0957-4484/24/1/015303\n10.1063/1.1326053\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.09.020\n10.1166/jnn.2010.2355\n10.1186/1556-276X-9-372\n10.1063/1.1421632\n10.1063/1.112914\n10.1109/TNANO.2019.2904336\n10.1016/j.mser.2006.10.001\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.08.068\n10.1016/j.promfg.2016.08.100\n10.1088/0957-4484/23/22/225301\n10.1126/science.1187851\n10.1016/j.matdes.2021.109547\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/9/095301\n10.1007/s11671-010-9653-7\n10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2021.103701\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2019.105328\n10.1016/j.mssp.2018.07.032\n10.1109/TNANO.2018.2826841\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2016.09.003\n10.1063/1.1143970\n10.1109/ACC.2014.6859224\n10.1016/S0304-3991(00)00077-2\n10.1117/12.716169\n10.1186/1556-276X-6-518\n10.3390/jlpea8030024\n10.1039/C1NR10988J\n10.1063/1.2767382\n10.1088/0957-4484/25/45/455301\n10.1186/s11671-019-2962-6\n10.1021/acsnano.8b08730"}
{"title": "Effects of Solvent and Electrospinning Parameters on the Morphology and Piezoelectric Properties of PVDF Nanofibrous Membrane.", "abstract": "PVDF electrospun membranes were prepared by employing different mixtures of solvents and diverse electrospinning parameters. A comprehensive investigation was carried out, including morphology, nanofiber diameter, crystallinity, \u03b2-phase fraction, and piezoelectric response under external mechanical strain. It was demonstrated that by using low-toxicity DMSO as the solvent, PVDF membranes with good morphology (bead-free, smooth surface, and uniform nanofiber) can be obtained. All the fabricated membranes showed crystallinity and \u03b2-phase fraction above 48% and 80%, respectively; therefore, electrospinning is a good method for preparing PVDF membranes with the piezoelectric properties. Moreover, we considered a potential effect of the solvent properties and the electrospinning parameters on the final piezoelectric properties. When PVDF membranes with different \u03b2-phase fractions and crystallinity values are applied to make the piezoelectric transducers, various piezoelectric voltage outputs can be obtained. This paper provides an effective and efficient strategy for regulating the piezoelectric properties of PVDF electrospun membranes by controlling both solvent dipole moment and process parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the influence of a solvent's dipole moment on the piezoelectric properties of electrospun materials has been reported.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-03-27", "authors": ["Jia-YiYin", "CarloBoaretti", "AlessandraLorenzetti", "AlessandroMartucci", "MartinaRoso", "MicheleModesti"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12060962\n10.1007/s12541-011-0151-3\n10.1080/09506608.2021.1915935\n10.1002/mame.201800463\n10.1002/adma.201504299\n10.1038/s41928-018-0189-7\n10.1016/j.jece.2021.106250\n10.1002/pen.23169\n10.1063/1.4939152\n10.1088/1361-6463/aa5f85\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1002/app.24531\n10.1039/C3RA45134H\n10.1002/app.35627\n10.1007/s10965-017-1196-5\n10.1002/app.38949\n10.1002/pen.24088\n10.1002/marc.200700544\n10.1039/C5RA16604G\n10.1002/app.47049\n10.1177/0892705712455036\n10.1002/polb.1988.090260405\n10.1063/5.0011686\n10.1021/ma011744f\n10.1063/1.4880119\n10.1002/adfm.201700702\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.09.025\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.06.050\n10.1016/j.polymer.2020.123366\n10.1002/pi.4314\n10.3390/membranes10030036\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1002/pen.21032\n10.1021/acsami.8b02172\n10.1016/j.desal.2005.07.043\n10.1002/polb.20223\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113856"}

{"title": "Chemical Cleaning Process of Polymeric Nanofibrous Membranes.", "abstract": "Membrane fouling is one of the most significant issues to overcome in membrane-based technologies as it causes a decrease in the membrane flux and increases operational costs. This study investigates the effect of common chemical cleaning agents on polymeric nanofibrous membranes (PNM) prepared by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polyamide 6 (PA6) nanofibers. Common alkaline and acid membrane cleaners were selected as the chemical cleaning agents. Membrane surface morphology was investigated. The PAN PNM were selected and fouled by engine oil and then cleaned by the different chemical cleaning agents at various ratios. The SEM results indicated that the use of chemical agents had some effects on the surface of the nanofibrous membranes.

The optimal bonding parameters by comparative experiments were defined as 1350 \u00b0C for 3 h. Due to simple experimental conditions, low experimental cost, and be suitable for bonding wafers with various sizes, the method is convenient for popularization and mass-production, thus promoting the development of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices at high temperatures. Simultaneously, an intact microcavity was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and a tight and void-free bonding interface with a transition layer thickness of 2.2 nm was confirmed via transmission electron microscopy. The results of tensile and leakage experiments indicated that the bonded wafer with the sealed microcavity exhibited a high bonding strength of 4.02 MPa and excellent seal performance. Compared to the original wafer, the piezoelectric constant of the LGS bonded wafer had a reduction of only 4.43%. The above characteristics show that the sealed microcavity prepared by this method satisfies the conditions for fabricating the LGS SAW pressure sensors.

However, the transmitting sensitivity of the reported PMUTs is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we report a beam-membrane coupled PMUT (BM-PMUT), which enhances the transmitting sensitivity via simultaneously increasing the acoustic emission areas and maintaining the comparable vibration amplitude. Experimental results show that the center and edge transmitting sensitivities of the BM-PMUT are 108.1 and 96 nm/V at 370 kHz, which are 109.9 and 49.6 nm/V at 677 kHz for the traditional PMUT (T-PMUT). Thus, the BM-PMUT realizes piston-like mode shapes and achieves around twofold improvement in the effective acoustic emission area relative to the traditional T-PMUT of the same size.

{"title": "Development and Characterization of ZnO Piezoelectric Thin Film Sensors on GH4169 Superalloy Steel Substrate by Magnetron Sputtering.", "abstract": "At present, piezoelectric sensors are primarily applied in health monitoring areas. They may fall off owing to the adhesive's durability, and even damage the monitored equipment. In this paper, a piezoelectric film sensor (PFS) based on a positive piezoelectric effect (PPE) is presented and a ZnO film is deposited on a GH4169 superalloy steel (GSS) substrate using magnetron sputtering. The microstructure and micrograph of ZnO piezoelectric thin films were analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM). The results showed that the surface morphology was dense and uniform and had a good c-axis-preferred orientation. According to the test results of five piezoelectric sensors, the average value of the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient was 1.36 pC/N, and the average value of the static calibration sensitivity was 19.77 mV/N. We selected the sensor whose parameters are closest to the average value for the dynamic test experiment and we drew the output voltage response curve of the piezoelectric film sensor under different loads.

{"title": "Design, Implementation, and Medical Applications of 2-D Ultrasound Sparse Arrays.", "abstract": "An ultrasound sparse array consists of a sparse distribution of elements over a 2-D aperture. Such an array is typically characterized by a limited number of elements, which in most cases is compatible with the channel number of the available scanners. Sparse arrays represent an attractive alternative to full 2-D arrays that may require the control of thousands of elements through expensive application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). However, their massive use is hindered by two main drawbacks: the possible beam profile deterioration, which may worsen the image contrast, and the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which may result too low for some applications. This article reviews the work done for three decades on 2-D ultrasound sparse arrays for medical applications. First, random, optimized, and deterministic design methods are reviewed together with their main influencing factors. Then, experimental 2-D sparse array implementations based on piezoelectric and capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) technologies are presented. Sample applications to 3-D (Doppler) imaging, super-resolution imaging, photo-acoustic imaging, and therapy are reported.

{"title": "Double-Stage DMAS With Fresnel Zone Filtering in Guided Waves Damage Imaging.", "abstract": "Digital beamforming methods in plate-like structures are widely exploited for Lamb waves-based damage imaging. Among them, the delay and sum (DAS) imaging technique is the most popular thanks to its low-computational cost and ease of implementation. However, the imaging outputs are low quality due to the high levels of side lobes and limited off-axis signal rejection, which leads to limited image resolution and contrast. Recently, the delay multiply and sum (DMAS) beamforming has been applied to nondestructive testing (NDT) field as a promising DAS alternative able to enhance the imaging reconstruction in terms of contrast and damage detectability. However, DMAS is still affected by high levels of artifacts. To tackle this aspect, literature offers a beamforming algorithm called double-stage DMAS (DS-DMAS), first introduced in photoacoustic imaging and medical ultrasound imaging. In this article, the DS-DMAS performance is analyzed for Lamb waves inspection, to provide an exhaustive comparison between DAS, DMAS, and DS-DMAS. As a further step, a filtering process addressed as Fresnel zone filtering (FZF) is used to restrict the beamforming partial sums in a physical way to the area around the scattering point. The proposed approach is an adaptation of a well-established technique in seismic data processing called Fresnel migration, able to suppress artifacts and enhance the quality of the imaging.

{"title": "Calculation of the modified control matrix for a selected unimorph deformable mirror to compensate the piezoelectric hysteresis effect using the inverse Bouc-Wen model.", "abstract": "The hysteresis behavior of piezoelectric actuators degrades the positioning accuracy and bandwidth of nano-positioning systems. Therefore, considering the hysteresis of piezoelectric deformable mirrors is completely essential and also improves the modeling accuracy of adaptive optics layouts. Because of the unique adaptability and mathematical flexibility of the Bouc-Wen model it has gained popularity, and as a result, in many scientific applications, it is one of the most conventional models typically employed to describe nonlinear hysteretic systems. Among different deformable mirrors, a unimorph piezoelectric deformable mirror is a suitable choice to be used in adaptive optics systems because of its relative convenience and cost-effective production. This paper proposes a new, to the best of our knowledge, approach to determine the influence function and the voltage control matrix of a specific unimorph mirror by considering a simplified inverse Bouc-Wen hysteresis model as a frequency function. Then the results for two selected standard Zernike modes, defocus and astigmatism-x, have been simulated using Comsol Multiphysics and MATLAB at a range of 5 to 100 Hz. For a more comprehensive comparison, the root-mean-square error and the coefficients of the Zernike terms have been applied as two criteria. According to the simulation results, the hysteresis effect of piezoelectric actuators has been significantly compensated by applying the inverse Bouc-Wen model at different frequencies, especially for higher frequencies. The effectiveness of the inverse Bouc-Wen model to compensate the hysteresis has been observed in astigmatism-x mode slightly more than in the defocus mode.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2022-03-26", "authors": ["M AAghababayee", "MMosayebi", "HSaghafifar"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.448707"}

A bi-stable harvester is proposed. By adjusting the tip and fixed magnets, different types of potential energy can be generated, and then the harvester can exhibit the linear, mono-stable and bi-stable characteristics. In the bi-stable state, the harvester triggers snap-through motions easily and generates large outputs. The corresponding prototype was fabricated, and the experiment was carried out to validate the advantage of the bi-stable energy harvester. The experiment results show that the bi-stable energy harvester outperforms the classical linear harvester over the whole range of vehicle speed.

{"title": "A Frequency-Adjustable Tuning Fork Electromagnetic Energy Harvester.", "abstract": "In this paper, a frequency-adjustable tuning fork electromagnetic energy harvester is introduced. The electromagnetic vibration energy harvester can adjust its natural frequency according to a change in the environmental excitation frequency without any change to the structure.

The frequency-adjustable tuning fork electromagnetic energy harvester significantly increases the range of frequencies used. The operating frequency of the centre can be easily switched from 9.2 to 20 Hz, enabling the application of multiple excitation frequencies.

{"title": "Vibration Excitation and Suppression of a Composite Laminate Plate Using Piezoelectric Actuators.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric (PZT) actuators bonded on a structure can be used to generate deformation and excite vibration for the shape control and vibration suppression, respectively. This article proposes a theoretical model for predicting vibrational response of a composite laminate plate with PZT actuators. The bending moment induced by the PZT actuator was obtained and applied on the composite laminate plate. Utilizing composite mechanics and plate theory, an analytical solution of the vibrational response of a composite laminate plate excited by the PZT actuator with oscillating voltage was derived. Furthermore, the finite element analysis using ANSYS software (2019 version) was carried out to compare with the proposed model with a good agreement. A parametric study was performed to investigate the influences of PZT location and frequency on the vibration. Numerical results illustrate that mode can be selectively excited provided the PZT actuator is placed in an appropriate location. Moreover, the proposed model was employed to predict the effectiveness of vibration suppression by distributed PZT actuators. The novelty of this work is that a complicated coupling problem between the composite plate and bonded PZT actuator is resolved into two simple problems, leading to a simple analytical solution for the vibrational response of a composite plate induced by PZT actuators. The proposed model has been successfully demonstrated its applications on the vibration excitation and suppression of a composite laminate plate.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-03-26", "authors": ["Shiuh-ChuanHer", "Han-YungChen"], "doi": "10.3390/ma15062027\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2006.09.007\n10.1016/S0263-8223(01)00080-0\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.09.002\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.04.021\n10.1177/1045389X19849247\n10.1016/j.robot.2014.09.026\n10.1063/1.4896185\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2006.02.002\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2009.09.003\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2014.11.031\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2006.01.014\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.06.054\n10.1016/j.procs.2016.06.040\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2013.07.003\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2014.12.044\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.05.021\n10.1177/1045389X19873422\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.02.056\n10.1177/1045389X17742736\n10.1007/s10999-015-9297-y\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.114518\n10.1016/j.jsv.2021.116438\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.114462\n10.1007/s00542-020-04808-7\n10.1080/19475411.2020.1841038\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119992\n10.1109/TMECH.2018.2790923\n10.1177/1045389X19891523\n10.1080/19475411.2020.1829159\n10.1016/S0045-7949(99)00151-0\n10.1016/S0168-874X(02)00225-1\n10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00110-X\n10.3390/ma13143201\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2007.04.023"}

However, no satisfactory clinical treatments have been developed to date to resolve this unmet medical issue. Osteochondral tissue engineering (OCTE) strategies involving the fabrication of OCT-mimicking scaffold structures capable of replacing damaged tissue and promoting its regeneration are currently under development. While the piezoelectric properties of the OCT have been extensively reported in different studies, they keep being neglected in the design of novel OCT scaffolds, which focus primarily on the tissue's structural and mechanical properties. Given the promising potential of piezoelectric electrospun scaffolds capable of both recapitulating the piezoelectric nature of the tissue's fibrous ECM and of providing a platform for electrical and mechanical stimulation to promote the regeneration of damaged OCT, the present review aims to examine the current state of the art of these electroactive smart scaffolds in OCTE strategies. A summary of the piezoelectric properties of the different regions of the OCT and an overview of the main piezoelectric biomaterials applied in OCTE applications are presented. Some recent examples of piezoelectric electrospun scaffolds developed for potentially replacing damaged OCT as well as for the bone or articular cartilage segments of this interfacial tissue are summarized.

{"title": "In Vitro Qualitative Evaluation of Root-End Preparation Performed by Piezoelectric Instruments.", "abstract": "Although the application of ultrasounds in endodontic surgery allows for effective debridement of the root canal, incorrect device setting or inefficient tips seem to generate cracks during root-end retropreparation. The primary aim of this in vitro study was to establish the presence, or absence, of a correlation between ultrasonic root-end preparation and the formation of cracks. The present study was conducted on human teeth, extracted for periodontal reasons. After root canal treatment, roots were resected 3 mm from the anatomical apex by using a high-speed handpiece and carbide burs. The resected teeth were retroprepared by using an ultrasonic tip (R1D, Piezomed, W&H, B\u00fcrmoos, Austria), setting the piezoelectric device at maximum power available for the tip. Time required for the retropreparation was recorded. Before and after retropreparation, all roots were photographed under a stereomicroscope and analyzed by two different operators to evaluate: (a) the presence and extension of dentinal cracks and (b) the morphology of root-end preparation. Finally, piezoelectric tips were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate morphologic changes after use. A total of 43 single roots (33 with one root canal, 10 with two root canals) were treated. Average preparation time was 1 minute and 54 seconds. None of the roots without initial cracks developed new cracks after retropreparation. Quality of the preparation margins was fairly equal among the prepared specimens. None of the piezoelectric tips broke during instrumentation, and SEM analysis showed minimal surface wear of the tips after performing 11 retropreparations.

{"title": "Detection of Aortic Valve Opening and Estimation of Pre-Ejection Period in Forcecardiography Recordings.", "abstract": "Forcecardiography (FCG) is a novel technique that measures the local forces induced on the chest wall by the mechanical activity of the heart. Specific piezoresistive or piezoelectric force sensors are placed on subjects\u2019 thorax to measure these very small forces. The FCG signal can be divided into three components: low-frequency FCG, high-frequency FCG (HF-FCG) and heart sound FCG. HF-FCG has been shown to share a high similarity with the Seismocardiogram (SCG), which is commonly acquired via small accelerometers and is mainly used to locate specific fiducial markers corresponding to essential events of the cardiac cycle (e.g., heart valves opening and closure, peaks of blood flow). However, HF-FCG has not yet been demonstrated to provide the timings of these markers with reasonable accuracy. This study addresses the detection of the aortic valve opening (AO) marker in FCG signals. To this aim, simultaneous recordings from FCG and SCG sensors were acquired, together with Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, from a few healthy subjects at rest, both during quiet breathing and apnea. The AO markers were located in both SCG and FCG signals to obtain pre-ejection periods (PEP) estimates, which were compared via statistical analyses. The PEPs estimated from FCG and SCG showed a strong linear relationship (r > 0.95) with a practically unit slope, and 95% of their differences were found to be distributed within \u00b1 4.6 ms around small biases of approximately 1 ms, corresponding to percentage differences lower than 5% of the mean measured PEP.

{"title": "Isoporous Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membranes with Selective Skin Layers via a Thermal-Vapor Assisted Phase Separation Method for Industrial Purification Applications.", "abstract": "The membrane filtration process is the most widely used purification process in various industries due to its high separation efficiency, process simplicity, and low cost. Although there is a wide range of membrane products with diverse materials and pore sizes on the market, there is a technological gap between microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes. Here we developed highly porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with a selective skin layer with a pore size range of 20 to 80 nm by using a thermal-vapor assisted phase separation method.

The overall membrane structure and pore size changed with the dope composition, while the pore size and thickness of the selective skin layer were effectively controlled by water vapor exposure.

This study aimed to investigate the biofunction of lncRNA RPSAP52 in GC. Quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was employed to analyze the gene level of lncRNA RPSAP52 and miR-665. Cell proliferation capacity was evaluated via CCK-8 and colony formation assay. Flow cytometry was applied to detect cell cycle and cell apoptosis. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was conducted for histopathological analysis. Immunochemical staining was carried out to detect expression level of ki-67. Subcellular fractionation was performed to explore the position of lncRNA RPSAP52. The binding relationship among lncRNA RPSAP52, miR-665 and STAT3 was verified via luciferase reporter assay. RNA pull down experiments were used to verify the binding relationship between lncRNA RPSAP52 and miR-665. The STAT3 level was evaluated via Western blot. LncRNA RPSAP52 is significantly elevated in GC cells. Deletion of lncRNA RPSAP52 restrained cell proliferation and induced G0-G1 phase arrest, while expediting apoptosis in GC cells. Tumor growth in vivo was suppressed following lncRNA RPSAP52 depletion. MiR-665 was verified as the target of lncRNA RPSAP52. A ceRNA-sponge mechanism of lncRNA RPSAP52 on miR-665 was identified. Meanwhile, miR-665 functions as STAT3 sponge. MiR-665 overexpression and STAT3 depletion served the same functions as lncRNA RPSAP52 depletion in GC cells.

The sensitivity, repeatability, and linearity of the measurements were assessed for ultrasound measurements at 1, 5, and 10 MHz. The bandwidth of the FBG sensor was measured and compared to that of a calibrated needle hydrophone. The FBG showed a sensitivity of 0.99, 0.769, and 0.818 V/MPa for 1, 5, and 10 MHz ultrasound, respectively.

Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based on the piezoelectric effect can accurately detect the mass changes at the nanogram level. However, water-capture materials deposited on the surface of QCM generally show disadvantages in either cost, sensitivity, or recyclability. Herein, novel QCM-based humidity sensors (NQHSs) are developed by uniformly depositing green microspheres (GMs) of natural polymers prepared by the chemical synthesis of the emulsification/inner gel method on QCM as humidity-sensitive materials. The NQHSs demonstrate high accuracy and sensitivity (27.1 Hz/% RH) owing to the various hydrophilic groups and porous nano-3D deposition structure. Compared with the devices deposited with a smooth film, the frequency of the NQHSs shows almost no changes during the cyclic test and exhibits long-term stability. The NQHSs have been successfully applied to non-contact sensing human activities and remote real-time humidity monitoring via Bluetooth transmission.

One of the fundamental acoustic modes of the modulator is excited through the surface electrodes, confining an acoustic standing wave to the electrode region. The modulator is placed between optical polarizers; light propagating through the modulator and polarizers is intensity modulated with a wide acceptance angle and record breaking modulation efficiency in the megahertz frequency regime.

{"title": "Comprehensive Analysis of TRP Channel-Related Genes for Estimating the Immune Microenvironment, Prognosis, and Therapeutic Effect in Patients With Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.", "abstract": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the year 2021 was awarded to Ardem Patapoutian and David Julius for their discoveries of temperature-sensitive receptors (TRP channels) and tactile receptors (Piezo channels), both of which were previously unknown. TRP channels are at the heart of the human ability to detect temperature, and they also play crucial regulatory functions in the occurrence and progression of cancer. Despite this, there have been no research conducted on the prognostic significance of TRP channels in individuals with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In GEO and TCGA cohorts, unsupervised clustering was first conducted based on 18 TRP channel-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) extracted from MSigDB database and KEGG database. Two TRP subtypes were identified and patients in subtype B had the best prognosis among the two subtypes. Significant differences in staging and grading existed among the different subtypes. In GEO cohort, univariate Cox analysis were performed to screen prognosis related genes. A TRP channel-related prognostic signature, which included 7 signature-related genes, was constructed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. Patients were divided into a high-risk group and low-risk group by the median risk score. In GEO and TCGA cohorts, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, principal component analysis (PCA), and univariate and multivariate Cox regression were performed to confirm the validity of signature. Following a more in-depth study of the TME based on the risk signature, it was discovered that the high-risk group had higher immune cell infiltration and lower tumor purity, indicating a bad prognosis. Patients with high risk scores also had increased immune checkpoint expression, indicating that these patients may be more likely to benefit from immunotherapy than other patients.

{"title": "Rapid and Efficient Removal of Anionic Dye in Water Using a Chitosan-Coated Iron Oxide-Immobilized Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane.", "abstract": "Anionic dyes are one of the most serious contaminants in water as these molecules are known to be toxic to many living organisms. Herein, we report the development of functionalized polyvinylidene fluoride membranes modified with chitosan-coated iron oxide nanomaterials (Fe-PVDF) for the efficient treatment of anionic dye-contaminated water. Aqueous solutions of anionic dyes could be captured rapidly by passing through the functionalized membrane under reduced pressure. Under neutral conditions, Fe-PVDF showed a maximum removal capacity of 74.6 mg/g for Evans blue (EB) through the adsorption process. In addition, the adsorption capacity was significantly enhanced up to 434.78 mg/g under acidic conditions. The adsorption process for EB matched well with the Langmuir model, indicating monolayer adsorption of the dye to the membrane surface. Moreover, Fe-PVDF can be reusable by a simple washing step in an alkaline solution, and thus, the composite membrane was applied several times without a significant decrease in its adsorption performance. The same composite membrane was further applied to the removal of five other different anionic dyes with high efficiencies. The adsorption mechanism can be explained by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged chitosan and the negatively charged dye as well as the affinity of the sulfate groups in dye molecules for the surface of the iron oxide nanoparticles. The easy preparation and rapid decolorization procedures make this composite membrane suitable for efficient water treatment.", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2022-03-22", "authors": ["Jun-HoShin", "Jung EunYang", "Jung EunPark", "Sun-WookJeong", "Sang-JuneChoi", "Yong JunChoi", "JonghoJeon"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.1c06991\n10.1146/annurev-environ-100809-125342\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137222\n10.1016/j.desal.2011.07.019\n10.1007/s10311-017-0650-2\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.062\n10.1016/j.eti.2018.05.006\n10.1016/j.saa.2016.02.002\n10.1039/c5ra28052d\n10.1016/j.poly.2019.03.033\n10.1016/j.cej.2011.12.017\n10.2166/aqua.2017.029\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07007\n10.1016/j.supflu.2014.01.004\n10.1039/c5ay00807g\n10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.04.002\n10.1016/j.cis.2010.06.007\n10.1039/d0ra02979c\n10.1016/j.molliq.2018.11.156\n10.1021/es204489h\n10.1016/j.jiec.2014.03.044\n10.1016/j.dyepig.2005.07.015\n10.1016/j.biortech.2005.05.001\n10.1155/2012/629103\n10.1039/c0ee00541j\n10.1016/j.jiec.2019.03.029\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.11.019\n10.1016/j.desal.2010.11.033\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.02.034\n10.1038/natrevmats.2016.18\n10.1016/j.jcis.2018.01.002\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.04.032\n10.1007/s11814-020-0668-1\n10.1039/c7en00759k\n10.1515/ntrev-2015-0014\n10.1021/la990663y\n10.1038/s41598-019-57017-2\n10.1016/j.cej.2018.08.222\n10.1016/j.jiec.2013.10.040\n10.3390/nano8030162\n10.1016/j.nanoso.2019.100290\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.125897\n10.1186/2052-336x-12-58\n10.1016/j.jiec.2019.11.033\n10.1007/s10311-020-01149-9\n10.1007/s10311-021-01289-6\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.116400\n10.3390/nano9081164"}

The constructed ZnO/SnS nanocomposites exhibited higher catalytic efficiency for Cr(VI) reduction under a mechanical force (e.g., ultrasonic vibration) compared to pristine ZnO and SnS. In particular, the ZnO/SnS (with 30 wt.% of SnS) heterojunctions revealed an optimal degradation activity among all the prepared samples, which completely removed the Cr(VI) (20 mg/L) solution within 35 min. Moreover, the piezoelectric catalytic activity of ZnO/SnS remained stable after four consecutive cycling experiments. The results of the morphology observations indicated that the SnS nanoparticles adhere to the surface of the ZnO nanorods. The improved piezoelectric catalytic performance of the ZnO/SnS heterojunctions can be attributed to the formation of an intimate interfacial between ZnO and SnS, which effectively inhibits the electron-hole recombination and speeds up the rate of charge transfer.

{"title": "Controlling the thickness dependence of torsional wave mode in pipe-like structures with the gradient-index phononic crystal lens.", "abstract": "The fundamental torsional wave mode, T(0,1), is typically preferred in monitoring defects in long-range pipe-like structures due to non-dispersive and low attenuation characteristics such that the wave packet is not distorted with distance. However, the sensitivity of T(0,1) wave mode depends on the defect type and orientation. While it is highly sensitive to cracks along the axis of pipes, the sensitivity to detect thickness change is low as T(0,1) wave mode generates tangential displacement motion around the pipe circumference. In this study, a gradient-index phononic crystal (GRIN-PC) lens is integrated into a steel pipe to manipulate its dispersion characteristics such that the phase velocity of T(0,1) wave mode is affected by the overall change in pipe thickness. The modified behavior of T(0,1) wave mode within the GRIN-PC lens region increases the damage detection capability of T(0,1) wave mode. Numerical models involving a parametric unit cell study indicate that the phase velocity of T(0,1) wave mode decreases as the thickness of the pipe with the GRIN-PC lens decreases, in contrast with the conventional pipe. The signal difference coefficient (SDC) is applied to the acquired signal from the focal point of GRIN-PC lens to quantify the uniform thickness change. Full-scale wave propagation simulations involving solid mechanics coupled with the piezoelectric actuation demonstrate that the SDC increases as the thickness decreases. The numerical results are validated with experiments using three steel pipes with different wall thicknesses.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-03-20", "authors": ["GorkemOkudan", "ChenxiXu", "HrishikeshDanawe", "SerifeTol", "DidemOzevin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106728"}

For higher resolutions, a microscopy approach is preferred, in which a single focused ultrasound transducer images the object point-by-point, but the bulky apparatus and long acquisition time of this approach limit clinical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a miniaturized acoustic detector capable of tomographic imaging with spread functions whose width is below 20\u2009\u00b5m.

{"title": "Memory related predictive compensation control of Piezoelectric actuators based on global linearization Koopman theory.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) are widely applied in precision positioning. However, the nonlinear characteristics such as hysteresis and creep limit the ultra-precision applications. This paper proposes a linear model predictive control (MPC) scheme for compensating the nonlinearity of PEA. Firstly, a global linearization predictor is constructed based on Koopman theory to represent the hysteresis behavior of PEA. The high-precision predictor is implemented by a novel memory related neural network (NN), and the prediction error reaches only 0.002\u00a0\u03bcm. Then the tracking control problem is transformed into a linear MPC optimization problem, thereby avoids the sophisticated nonconvex optimization problem. In practice, the constrained MPC problem is rewritten into a dense form, and solved by quadratic programming technique. Finally, the validity of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by experiments. The short-term steady-state error of the proposed scheme is 0.002\u00a0\u03bcm, which is far less than that of the inversion method; the long-term steady-state performance also indicates its effectiveness in compensating creep. Further, the excellent frequency-dependent results show that the proposed scheme is superior to the existing control method. Especially, the computational efficiency can be improved by 20%.

While the use of wideband sources may enable parallel interrogation of multiple resonators, it comes at the cost of reduction in the optical power, and ultimately in sensitivity, per channel. In this work we have developed a new interferometric approach to overcome this signal loss by using high-power bursts that are synchronized with the time window in which ultrasound detection is performed. Each burst is composed of a train of low-noise optical pulses which are sufficiently wideband to interrogate an array of resonators with non-overlapping spectra. We demonstrate our method, termed burst-mode pulse interferometry, for interrogating a single resonator in which the optical power was reduced to emulate the power loss per channel that occurs in parallel interrogation of 20 to 200 resonators.

Here we examined the role of the intracellular domains of PIEZO2, which account for 25% of the channel, and demonstrate that these domains fine-tune properties such as poking and stretch-sensitivity, velocity coding and single channel conductance. Moreover, we show that the intrinsically disordered linker between the transmembrane helices twelve and thirteen (IDR5) is required for the activation of PIEZO2 by cytoskeleton-transmitted forces. The deletion of IDR5 abolishes PIEZO2-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth, while it only partially affected its sensitivity to cell indentation and does not alter its stretch sensitivity.

Experiments on the vibrissal system often require highly repeatable stimulation of multiple whiskers and the ability to vary stimulation parameters across a wide range. The stimulator must also be easy to position and adjust. Developing a multi-whisker stimulation system that meets these criteria remains challenging.\nWe describe a novel multi-whisker stimulator to assess neural selectivity for the direction of global motion. The device can generate repeatable, linear sweeps of tactile stimulation across the whisker array in any direction and with a range of speeds. A fiber optic beam break detects the interval of whisker contact as the stimulator passes through the array.\nWe demonstrate the device's function and utility by recording from a small number of multi-whisker-responsive neurons in the trigeminal brainstem. Neurons had higher firing rates in response to faster stimulation speeds; some also exhibited strong direction-of-motion tuning.\nThe stimulator complements more standard piezo-electric stimulators, which offer precise control but typically stimulate only single whiskers, require whisker trimming, and travel through small angles. It also complements non-contact methods of stimulation such as air-puffs and electromagnetic-induced stimulation. Tradeoffs include stimulation speed and frequency, and the inability to stimulate whiskers individually.\nThe stimulator could be used - in either anesthetized or awake, head-fixed preparations - as an approach to studying global motion selectivity of multi-whisker sensitive neurons at multiple levels of the vibrissal-trigeminal system.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "date": "2022-03-17", "authors": ["SchnaudeDorizan", "Kevin JKleczka", "AdmirResulaj", "TrevorAlston", "Chris SBresee", "Mitra J ZHartmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jneumeth.2022.109565\n10.1093/cercor/13.1.53\n10.1016/j.cub.2014.05.036\n10.1113/jphysiol.1975.sp010902\n10.1371/journal.pone.0194981\n10.1152/jn.00054.2016\n10.1152/jn.01034.2005\n10.1152/jn.00600.2002\n10.1080/0899022021000037809\n10.1371/journal.pone.0232916\n10.3389/fnint.2011.00053\n10.7554/eLife.13969\n10.1073/pnas.2020194118\n10.1016/j.conb.2016.08.001\n10.7554/eLife.10696\n10.1038/s41467-018-06200-6\n10.1371/journal.pone.0228260\n10.1523/jneurosci.2999-08.2008\n10.1038/s41467-020-17087-7\n10.1038/ncomms13528\n10.1523/jneurosci.1746-06.2006\n10.1523/jneurosci.4274-09.2010\n10.1038/s41467-018-06585-4\n10.1080/01421590120072204\n10.1152/jn.00511.2015\n10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00356\n10.1152/jn.00011.2015\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2010.03.020\n10.1016/j.neuron.2008.10.017\n10.1152/jn.00289.2016\n10.1126/science.1097779\n10.1016/j.neuron.2014.10.014\n10.1371/journal.pone.0158399\n10.1038/s41598-017-11477-6\n10.1016/j.neuron.2011.10.009\n10.1016/s0165-0270(00)00345-9\n10.1152/jn.00350.2020\n10.1152/jn.00044.2011\n10.1016/j.neuron.2006.10.036\n10.7554/eLife.62687\n10.3389/fncir.2014.00092\n10.1016/0006-8993(85)90441-x\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.04.026\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.04.008\n10.1038/nn.3720\n10.1152/jn.00404.2006\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.045\n10.1152/jn.1974.37.1.73\n10.1016/0006-8993(83)90561-9\n10.1152/jn.2001.86.1.339\n10.1152/jn.01109.2003\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001120\n10.1016/j.neuron.2007.10.023\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.006\n10.1152/jn.00261.2020\n10.1523/jneurosci.2971-18.2019\n10.1073/pnas.2011905118"}

{"title": "Direct Ink Printing of PVdF Composite Polymer Electrolytes with Aligned BN Nanosheets for Lithium-Metal Batteries.", "abstract": "The use of polymer electrolytes is of great interest for lithium-metal batteries (LMBs) due to their stability with lithium metal. However, the low thermal conductivity of polymer electrolytes poses a significant barrier to minimizing the formation of local hot spots during electrochemical reactions in lithium batteries that may lead to dendritic plating of Li or thermal runaway events. Electrolyte nanocomposites with proper distribution of thermally conductive nanomaterials offer an opportunity to address this shortcoming. Utilizing a custom-designed direct ink writing (DIW) process, we show that highly aligned boron nitride (BN) nanosheets can be embedded in poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF) polymer composite electrolytes (CPE-BN), enabling novel architectural designs for safe Li-metal batteries. It is observed that the CPE-BN electrolytes possess a 400% increase in their in-plane thermal conductivity, which enables faster heat distribution in the CPE-BN electrolyte compared to the polymer electrolytes without BN nanosheets.

LEM domain containing 1 (LEMD1) is overexpressed in multiple tumor tissues and plays a key role in cancer carcinogenesis and progression. However, little is known about the potential of LEMD1 in PC. In this study, we explored the clinical values, as well as the potential roles and mechanisms of LEMD1 in PC. We, for the first time, showed that LEMD1 was upregulated in PC and negatively correlated with the overall and disease-free survival of patients with PC. Of the function, LEMD1 knockdown inhibited cancer cell growth, migration and invasion, while LEMD1 overexpression promoted tumor aggressiveness. The tumor-promoting influences of LEMD1 in PC were also proved by in vivo assays. Mechanistically, GSEA identified that LEMD1 promoted PC aggressiveness, as well as affecting cell cycle dysregulation and apoptosis resistance, by p53 suppression and the activation of the mTORC1 signal pathway. In short, LEMD1 could serve as a valuable prognostic candidate and a potential therapeutic target of PC.", "journal": "Bioengineered", "date": "2022-03-15", "authors": ["XiangCao", "NaYao", "ZidanZhao", "YueFu", "YutingHu", "PingZhu", "WeihaiShi", "LimingTang"], "doi": "10.1080/21655979.2022.2047404"}

This technique can elucidate significant information about the health and development of human tissue such as liver and brain, and has been used on phantom models (e.g., agar, silicone) to determine their suitability for use as a mechanical surrogate for human tissues in experimental models. The applied harmonic deformation used in MRE is generated by an actuator, transmitted in bursts of a specified duration, and synchronized with the magnetic resonance signal excitation. These actuators are most often a pneumatic design (common for human tissues or phantoms) or a piezoelectric design (common for small animal tissues or phantoms).

For each of these actuator types, we discuss displacement requirements, end-effector options and challenges, electronics and electronic-driving requirements and considerations, and full MRE implementation.

However, achieving accurate continuous blood pressure wave monitoring based on arterial pulse waves remains challenging, because the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and their related blood pressure waves is unclear. To address this, the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and blood pressure waves is first elucidated via theoretical, simulation, and experimental analysis of these dynamics. Based on this correlation, the authors develop a wireless wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring system, with better portability than conventional systems that are based on the pulse wave velocity between multiple sensors.

{"title": "Optical phase modulation by natural eye movements: application to time-domain FF-OCT image retrieval.", "abstract": "Eye movements are commonly seen as an obstacle to high-resolution ophthalmic imaging. In this context we study the natural axial movements of the in vivo human eye and show that they can be used to modulate the optical phase and retrieve tomographic images via time-domain full-field optical coherence tomography (TD-FF-OCT). This approach opens a path to a simplified ophthalmic TD-FF-OCT device, operating without the usual piezo motor-camera synchronization.

{"title": "Fatty acids as biomodulators of Piezo1 mediated glial mechanosensitivity in Alzheimer's disease.", "abstract": "The brain is the softest organ in the body, and any change in the mechanical properties of the tissue induces the activation of glial cells, astrocytes and microglia. Amyloid plaques, one of the main pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are substantially harder than the surrounding brain tissue and can activate astrocytes and microglia resulting in the glial engulfment of plaques. Durotaxis, a migratory preference towards stiffer tissue, is prompting microglia to form a mechanical barrier around plaques reducing amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced neurotoxicity. Mechanoreceptors are highly expressed in the brain, particularly in microglia. The large increase in the expression of the mechanoreceptor Piezo1 was observed in the brains from AD animal models and AD patients in plaque encompassing glia. Importantly, Piezo1 function is regulated via force-from-lipids through the lipid composition of the membrane and membranous incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can affect the function of Piezo1 altering mechanosensitive properties of the cell. On the other hand, PUFAs dietary supplementation can alter microglial polarization, the envelopment of amyloid plaques, and immune response and Piezo1 activity was implicated in the similar modulations of microglia behavior. Finally, PUFAs treatment is currently in use in medical trials as the therapy for sickle cell anemia, a disease linked with the mutations in Piezo1. Further studies are needed to elucidate the connection between PUFAs, Piezo1 expression, and microglia behavior in the AD brain. These findings could open new possibilities in harnessing microglia in AD and in developing novel therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2022-03-15", "authors": ["SanjaIvkovic", "TamaraMajor", "MilosMitic", "NatasaLoncarevic-Vasiljkovic", "MilenaJovic", "MiroslavAdzic"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120470"}

{"title": "Prestin-Mediated Frequency Selectivity Does not Cover Ultrahigh Frequencies in Mice.", "abstract": "In mammals, the piezoelectric protein, Prestin, endows the outer hair cells (OHCs) with electromotility (eM), which confers the capacity to change cellular length in response to alterations in membrane potential. Together with basilar membrane resonance and possible stereociliary motility, Prestin-based OHC eM lays the foundation for enhancing cochlear sensitivity and frequency selectivity. However, it remains debatable whether Prestin contributes to ultrahigh-frequency hearing due to the intrinsic nature of the cell's low-pass features. The low-pass property of mouse OHC eM is based on the finding that eM magnitude dissipates within the frequency bandwidth of human speech. In this study, we examined the role of Prestin in sensing broad-range frequencies (4-80\u00a0kHz) in mice that use ultrasonic hearing and vocalization (to >100\u00a0kHz) for social communication. The audiometric measurements in mice showed that ablation of Prestin did not abolish hearing at frequencies >40\u00a0kHz. Acoustic associative behavior tests confirmed that Prestin-knockout mice can learn ultrahigh-frequency sound-coupled tasks, similar to control mice.

Understanding the role of the choice of materials and the filler-matrix architecture is critical to achieving desired functionality of a composite towards applications in flexible electronics and energy harvest devices. Herein, a high-throughput phase-field simulation is conducted to systematically reveal the influence of morphology and spatial orientation of an oxide filler on the piezoelectric, mechanical, and dielectric properties of the piezoelectric nanocomposites. It is discovered that with a constant filler volume fraction, a composite composed of vertical pillars exhibits superior piezoelectric response and electromechanical coupling coefficient as compared to the other geometric configurations. An analytical regression is established from a linear regression-based machine learning model, which can be employed to predict the performance of nanocomposites filled with oxides with a given set of piezoelectric coefficient, dielectric permittivity, and stiffness.

Due to the limited clinical treatment option, loss of skin sensation with unsatisfactory nerve regeneration is remained to be a challenge for wound therapy. Endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) based in situ regeneration, of which, MSCs recruited by chemokines and directed for neuronal differentiation by biological and electrical signals have been thought a novel strategy with potential to accelerate the nerve regeneration and sensory functions recovery. However, most current therapeutic systems usually deliver the chemokines, biological and electrical signals separately and statically, resulting in limited nerve regeneration and sensory functions recovery. Moreover, most of the devices for providing electrical signals need external energy input and complicated practice, leading to poor compliance in patients. To address these issues, we propose a self-powered smart patch (PRG-G-C) to provide chemokine and biological-electrical cues in program. PRG-G-C was composed of a flexible piezoelectric generator to supply electrical stimulation and a conductive gel, which served as the reservoir of chemokine and neural directing exosomes as well as the electrode to transfer electric cue. PRG-G-C was shown to efficiently accelerate rapid nerve regeneration and sensation restoration at the wound site within 23 days.

Here, we translated the single clinical problem to a multidisciplinary approach that combined the periodontal surgery, biomaterial implantation, and orthodontics to treat this condition. This study aimed to explore the clinical effectiveness of modified periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO) in adult patients with skeletal Class II discrepancy via a camouflage orthodontic approach. This clinical trial has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (trial number: ChiCTR2100052638, trial URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=135827). A total of 26 adult female patients with similar skeletal Class II malocclusions and similar dental and skeletal discrepancies were enrolled. A total of 13 patients in the experimental group received modified PAOO characterized by vertical incisions in interradicular areas and random punching made by a piezoelectric device, whereas 13 patients in the control group received orthodontic treatment only. All patients underwent extraction of four premolars and orthodontic treatment with the sliding MBT straight-wire technique. Treatment courses were recorded and changes in dental and skeletal parameters were evaluated by cephalometric analysis and translated into upper digital cast for further measurements. The results showed that the durations of the alignment and leveling stage (4.51\u00b11.53 mos versus 9.41\u00b11.46 mos. P<0.01), space closing stage (13.56\u00b12.57 mos versus 17.09\u00b13.50 mos.

The modified PAOO accelerated orthodontic tooth movement in adult extraction cases with skeletal Class II discrepancy and convex profile; the modified PAOO achieved dual goals of periodontal health and long-term stability of orthodontics.

But challenges still remain with respect to the operational locations and the techniques required to address them. Posterior sites, with substantial cortical plate thicknesses and sensitive anatomy, present the dichotomy of visualization versus postsurgical regeneration of bone. The bony lid technique bridges the gap between these 2 concepts, and the application of piezosurgery renders a precise and biocompatible osseous incision. The purpose of this paper was to outline, through case reports, the progression of piezo-guided surgery in a postgraduate resident setting.\nThe primary evolution of the bony lid technique relied on the transfer of measurements from defined landmarks in the CBCT volume to the cortical plate of the surgical site. The secondary evolution used the same measurement protocols transferred to a laboratory model of the patients' arch. A vacuformed stent was fabricated with pertinent fiducial markers in gutta percha defining the surgical site parameters, and a scan exposed with the stent in place. These 2 evolutions are designated as the surgeon-defined site location method and are explained in greater detail in this the first of 2 parts of the topic. All surgeries were executed using the piezosurgical method with increasing levels of guidance and precision throughout the evolution process.\nEach step in the technique implementation enabled the resident to assimilate a new technique and skill set while maintaining bone architecture and minimizing volume loss postoperatively. The patient benefits were an increase in intraoperative safety and postoperative comfort. The resident benefits were accelerated regeneration timetables, and increase in the confidence level of the resident and number of scheduled posterior surgical procedures.\nThe progression from crude on-site measurements to elegant and precise surgical guides enabled the access and manipulations of difficult surgical sites without compromising visibility, postoperative osseous regeneration, or patient comfort.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2022-03-11", "authors": ["Stephen PNiemczyk", "FrederickBarnett", "James DJohnson", "RonaldOrdinola-Zapata", "AnnaGlinianska", "Jin-HweiJulianna Bair", "Austin SungminJang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2022.02.013"}
{"title": "An Atlas of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters in Oceanic Applications.", "abstract": "Nowadays, a large number of sensors are employed in the oceans to collect data for further analysis, which leads to a large number of demands for battery elimination in electronics due to the size reduction, environmental issues, and its laborious, pricy, and time-consuming recharge or replacement. Numerous methods for direct energy harvesting have been developed to power these low-power consumption sensors. Among all the developed harvesters, piezoelectric energy harvesters offer the most promise for eliminating batteries from future devices. These devices do not require maintenance, and they have compact and simple structures that can be attached to low-power devices to directly generate high-density power. In the present study, an atlas of 85 designs of piezoelectric energy harvesters in oceanic applications that have recently been reported in the state-of-the-art is provided.

{"title": "MetaMembranes for the Sensitivity Enhancement of Wearable Piezoelectric MetaSensors.", "abstract": "The low stretchability of plain membranes restricts the sensitivity of conventional diaphragm-based pressure and inflatable piezoelectric sensors. Using theoretical and computational tools, we characterized current limitations and explored metamaterial-inspired membranes (MetaMems) to resolve these issues. This paper develops two MetaMem pressure sensors (MPSs) to enrich the sensitivity and stretchability of the conventional sensors. Two auxetic hexagonal and kirigami honeycombs are proposed to create a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in the MetaMems which enables them to expand the piezo-element of sensors in both longitudinal and transverse directions much better, and consequently provides the MPSs' diaphragm a higher capability for flexural deformation. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polycarbonate (PC) are considered as the preferable materials for the piezo-element and MetaMem, respectively. A finite element analysis was conducted to investigate the stretchability behavior of the MetaMems and study its effect on the PVDF's polarization and sensor sensitivity. The results obtained from theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed MetaMems enhance the sensitivity of pressure sensors up to 3.8 times more than an equivalent conventional sensor with a plain membrane.

The electrical or mechanical impedance of its structure plays an important role in deriving its equivalent model, which in turn helps to predict its behavior for any system-level application, such as with respect to the rectifiers containing diodes and switches, which represent a nonlinear electrical load. In this paper, we study the electrical impedance response of different sizes of commercial piezoelectric discs for a wide range of frequencies (without and with mechanical load for 0.1-1000 kHz with resolution 20 Hz). It shows significant changes in the position of resonant frequency and amplitude of resonant peaks for different diameters of discs and under varying mechanical load conditions, implying variations in the mechanical boundary conditions on the structure. The highlight of our work is the proposed electrical equivalent circuit model for varying mechanically loaded conditions with the help of impedance technique.

{"title": "Impact of the Nanocarbon on Magnetic and Electrodynamic Properties of the Ferrite/Polymer Composites.", "abstract": "Binary and ternary composites (CM) based on M-type hexaferrite (HF), polymer matrix (PVDF) and carbon nanomaterials (quasi-one-dimensional carbon nanotubes-CNT and quasi-two-dimensional carbon nanoflakes-CNF) were prepared and investigated for establishing the impact of the different nanosized carbon on magnetic and electrodynamic properties. The ratio between HF and PVDF in HF + PVDF composite was fixed (85 wt% HF and 15 wt% PVDF). The concentration of CNT and CNF in CM was fixed (5 wt% from total HF + PVDF weight). The phase composition and microstructural features were investigated using XRD and SEM, respectively. It was observed that CM contains single-phase HF, \u03b3- and \u03b2-PVDF and carbon nanomaterials. Thus, we produced composites that consist of mixed different phases (organic insulator matrix-PDVF; functional magnetic fillers-HF and highly electroconductive additives-CNT/CNF) in the required ratio.

{"title": "A Simple Polypyrrole/Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane with Hydrophobic and Self-Floating Ability for Solar Water Evaporation.", "abstract": "The traditional hydrophobic solarevaporator is generally obtained through the modification of alkyl or fluoroalkyl on the photothermal membrane. However, the modified groups can easily be oxidized in the long-term use process, resulting in the poor salt resistance and stability of photothermal membrane. In order to solve this problem, a simple polypyrrole/polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, consisting of an intrinsic hydrophobic support (polyvinylidene fluoride) and a photothermal material (polypyrrole), was fabricated by ultrasonically mixing and immersed precipitation. This photothermal membrane showed good self-floating ability in the process of water evaporation. In order to further improve the photothermal conversion efficiency, a micropyramid structure with antireflective ability was formed on the surface of membrane by template method. The micropyramids can enhance the absorption efficiency of incident light.

This supplementation is usually excessive, causing nutrient leaching in periods of rainfall leading to environmental problems. To overcome such issues, many studies have been devoted to developing polymeric matrices for the controlled and continuous release of nutrients, reducing losses, and keeping plants nourished for as long as possible. However, the release mechanism of these matrices is based on water diffusion. They start immediately for swellable polymeric matrices, which is not interesting and also may cause some waste, because the plant only needs nutrition only after the germination process.

However, under pathological conditions, such as cholestatic disease, cholestasis can damage hepatocytes/biliary epithelial cells leading to apoptosis or necrosis. Clinically, pancreatic head cancer usually presents with obstructive jaundice and increased serum bile acid levels, suggesting that pancreatic cancer is intricately correlated with a high bile acid environment in the human body. An increasing body of evidence suggests that bile acids are toxic to normal human and colon cancer cells. Nonetheless, the effect of bile acids on the occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer remains a matter of debate. In the present study, to explore the direct effects of high serum concentrations of bile acids on pancreatic cancer and the possible related mechanisms, human pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cells were subject to different concentrations of bile acid mixtures to assess cell viability and the migration and invasion ability.

Biosensors can be based on electrochemical, piezoelectric, thermal, and optical transduction mechanisms. Early virus identification provides critical information about potentially effective and selective therapies, extends the therapeutic window, and thereby reduces morbidity. The sensitivity and selectivity of graphene can be amended via functionalizing it or conjoining it with further materials. Amendment of the optical and electrical features of the hybrid structure by introducing appropriate functional groups or counterparts is especially appealing for quick and easy-to-use virus detection. Various techniques for the electrochemical detection of viruses depending on antigen-antibody interactions or DNA hybridization are discussed in this work, and the reasons behind using graphene and related carbon nanomaterials for the fabrication are presented and discussed. We review the existing state-of-the-art directions of graphene-based classifications for detecting DNA, protein, and hormone biomarkers and summarize the use of the different biosensors to detect several diseases, like cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes, to sense numerous viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, rotavirus, Zika virus, and hepatitis B virus, and to detect the recent pandemic virus COVID-19. The general concepts, mechanisms of action, benefits, and disadvantages of advanced virus biosensors are discussed to afford beneficial evidence of the creation and manufacture of innovative virus biosensors. We emphasize that graphene-based nanomaterials are ideal candidates for electrochemical biosensor engineering due to their special and tunable physicochemical properties.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2022-03-02", "authors": ["Heba MohamedFahmy", "Esraa SamyAbu Serea", "Reem EssamSalah-Eldin", "Sara AymanAl-Hafiry", "Miar KhaledAli", "Ahmed EsmailShalan", "SenentxuLanceros-M\u00e9ndez"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c00710"}
{"title": "Emerging approaches of neural regeneration using physical stimulations solely or coupled with smart piezoelectric nano-biomaterials.", "abstract": "Neural regeneration is a challenging venture as it is limited by various intrinsic physiological parameters such as the presence of biomolecules like Nogo-A, Ephrin-B3 and Neurocan, that inhibit Central nervous system (CNS) regeneration, and the absence of conducive factors such as ATF3, Sox2 and GAP-43, that promote the neuronal differentiation and regeneration. The design of an effective strategy for neuronal repair or regeneration is a daunting task as neural cells are responsive to a very narrow window of the conductive cellular microenvironment. It requires specific inductive signals and chemical cues from neighbouring cells that can trigger the process of regeneration or repair. It is this complexity that adds to the plight in the scenarios of patients confronted with trauma resulting in spinal cord injury (SCI) or traumatic brain injury (TBI). SCI or TBI may cause temporary or permanent locomotory disorders in patients, affecting the quality of their lives. The regenerative potential of neural cells in the CNS is comparatively lesser than that of peripheral nervous system (PNS). Also, the activation and migration of astrocytes to the injury site causes glial scar, thus hindering further repair process, especially in CNS injuries. Therefore, an effective strategy for stimulating neuritic branching and growth can be a solution to the problem. This review discusses the various facets of strategies that have been adopted to understand and improve the progress of neural tissue engineering for treating the conditions like SCI and TBI. This review also provides an insight regarding the influence of various nano-topographical cues on neuronal cell behavior, the importance of inherent piezoelectric properties in biological systems, various forms of physical stimulation methods that can drive the process of neuritic outgrowth, and finally concludes with the elucidations of advances in development of various biomaterials that have been found effective in achieving enhancement in neuronal physiological properties.

The results reveal that the nanofibers made from solutions with high concentration were smooth and defect-free, compared to the fibers obtained from solutions with low concentration, and possess high crystallinity as well.

In this work, a 3D hyperboloidal arrayed self-polarized PVDF piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) is successfully fabricated by incorporating electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pulling technology into fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. This strategy not only simplifies the layer-by-layer constructing procedure for arrays, but simultaneously realizes a self-polarized and high \u03b2-phase (92%) PVDF PEH in a single electric-pulling step, saving posttreatment such as poling and removing excessive additives. Such a PEH delivers a significantly enhanced piezoelectric potential which is around 8 times that of a 2D flat film sensor. Moreover, this PEH featuring excellent linearity within a wide pressure regime, enables the sensing of human activities in a relatively large force range, which is otherwise difficult for traditional film sensors to differentiate.

In our experiments, we mount a piezoelectric vibration sensor on the knob of a wooden bat to record: (1) 3600 vibration signals (waveforms) from ball-bat impacts in the static experiment-30 impacts from each of 40 positions (distributed 1-40 cm from the end of the barrel) and 3 intensities (drop heights at 75, 100, and 125 cm, resp.), and (2) 45 vibration signals from actual battings by three baseball players in the dynamic experiment. The results show that the peak amplitude of the signal in the time domain, and the peaks of the first, second, and third eigenfrequencies (EFs) of the bat all increase with the impact intensity. However, the ratios of peaks at these three EFs (1st/2nd, 2nd/3rd, and 1st/3rd) hardly change with the impact intensity, and the observation is consistent for both the static and dynamic experiments across all impact positions.

{"title": "Bidirectional Drive with Inhibited Hysteresis for Piezoelectric Actuators.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators with a flexible displacement amplification structure are widely used in the fields of precision driving and positioning. The displacement curve of conventional piezoelectric actuators is asymmetrical and non-linear, which leads to large non-linear errors and reduced positioning accuracy of these piezoelectric actuators. In this paper, a bidirectional active drive piezoelectric actuator is proposed, which suppresses the hysteresis phenomenon to a certain extent and reduces the non-linear error. Based on the deformation theory of the beam, a theoretical model of the rhombus mechanism was established, and the key parameters affecting the drive performance were analyzed. Then, the static and dynamic characteristics of series piezoelectric actuators were analyzed by the finite element method. A prototype was manufactured and the output performance was tested. The results show that the actuator can achieve a bidirectional symmetric output of amplification displacement, with a maximum value of 91.45 \u03bcm and a resolution of 35 nm.

{"title": "Damage Classification Using Supervised Self-Organizing Maps in Structural Health Monitoring.", "abstract": "Improvements in computing capacity have allowed computers today to execute increasingly complex tasks. One of the main benefits of these improvements is the possibility of developing machine learning algorithms, of which the fields of application are extensive and varied. However, an area in which this type of algorithms acquires an increasing relevance is structural health monitoring (SHM), where inspection strategies and guided wave-based approaches make the evaluation of the structural conditions of an aircraft, vessel or building among others possible, by detecting and classifying existing damages. The use of sensors, data acquisition systems (DAQ) and computation has also allowed these damage detection and classification tasks to be carried out automatically. Despite today's advances, it is still necessary to continue with the development of more robust, reliable, and low-cost structural health monitoring systems. For this reason, this work contemplates three key points: (i) the configuration of a data acquisition system for signal gathering from an an active piezoelectric (PZT) sensor network; (ii) the development of a damage classification methodology based on signal processing techniques (normalization and PCA), from which the models that describe the structural conditions of the plate are built; and (iii) the use of machine learning algorithms, more specifically, three variants of the self-organizing maps called CPANN (counterpropagation artificial neural network), SKN (supervised Kohonen) and XYF (X-Y fused Kohonen). The data obtained allowed one to carry out an experimental validation of the damage classification methodology, to determine the presence of damages in two aluminum plates of different sizes, where masses were added to change the vibrational responses captured by the sensor network and a composite (CFRP) plate with real damages, such as delamination and cracks. This classification methodology allowed one to obtain excellent results by validating the usefulness of the SKN and XYF networks in damage classification tasks, showing overall accuracies of 73.75% and 72.5%, respectively, according to the cross-validation process. These percentages are higher than those obtained in comparison with other neural networks such as: kNN, discriminant analysis, classification trees, partial least square discriminant analysis, and backpropagation neural networks, when the cross-validation process was applied.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-02-27", "authors": ["Gilbert AAngulo-Saucedo", "Jersson XLeon-Medina", "Wilman AlonsoPineda-Mu\u00f1oz", "Miguel AngelTorres-Arredondo", "Diego ATibaduiza"], "doi": "10.3390/s22041484\n10.1002/9781118443118.ch4\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/4/045006\n10.1016/B978-0-08-100148-6.00001-9\n10.1177/14759217211036880\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.09.472\n10.1002/suco.201000014\n10.3390/s20030860\n10.3390/s19030545\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916648\n10.3390/s20030733\n10.1088/1757-899x/138/1/012016\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.05.020\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.10.033\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/10/105023\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107077\n10.1155/2014/709127\n10.1504/IJBIC.2017.081843\n10.1155/2018/5081283\n10.3390/s17020417\n10.7763/IJMLC.2015.V5.526\n10.7158/S12-042.2014.15.1\n10.1007/s11012-014-0085-9\n10.1080/15376494.2011.621838\n10.1186/s13634-016-0355-x\n10.1109/5.58325\n10.1142/9789814522748_0008\n10.1016/j.chemolab.2006.02.003\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.518.37\n10.1016/j.procir.2020.05.057\n10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.113\n10.1155/2013/850712\n10.1002/stc.1540\n10.3390/s17061252\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1497\n10.20855/ijav.2019.24.11485\n10.3390/s17020302\n10.1016/B978-075067759-2/50006-5\n10.1109/CCAA.2016.7813875\n10.1016/j.aca.2010.06.036\n10.1177/1475921710388972\n10.3390/app10155062\n10.3390/s20030873\n10.1016/j.chemolab.2009.05.007\n10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.07.005\n10.1039/c3ay40582f"}

{"title": "Advances in Inorganic Nanomaterials for Triboelectric Nanogenerators.", "abstract": "Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that utilize triboelectrification and electrostatic induction to convert mechanical energy to electricity have attracted increasing interest in the last 10 years. As a universal physical phenomenon, triboelectrification can occur between any two surfaces that experience physical contact and separation regardless of the type of material. For this reason, many materials, including both organic and inorganic materials, have been studied in TENGs with different purposes. Although organic polymers are mainly used as triboelectric materials in TENGs, the application of inorganic nanomaterials has also been intensively studied because of their unique dielectric, electric, piezoelectric, and optical properties, which can improve the performance of TENGs.

{"title": "Fiber optic jerk sensor.", "abstract": "Jerk is directly related to a physical mutation process of structural damage and human comfort. A fiber optic jerk sensor (FOJS) based on a fiber optic differentiating Mach-Zehnder interferometer is proposed. It can directly measure jerk by demodulating the phase of interference light, which avoids the high-frequency noise interference caused by differentiating the acceleration. The sensing theory and sensor design are given in detail. The experimental and theoretical results agree, demonstrating that the FOJS has a high sensitivity, an ultralow phase noise floor, a wide measuring range, and good linearity. The impact test shows that the FOJS can directly measure jerk and has good consistency with a standard piezoelectric accelerometer. The FOJS has potential applications in earthquake engineering, comfort evaluations, and railway design. This is the first time that directly measuring jerk with an optical sensor is reported.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2022-02-26", "authors": ["HuicongLi", "WentaoZhang", "JianxiangZhang", "WenzhuHuang"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.448132"}

In this paper, the virtual optical scale bar with two retroreflectors is constructed by the absolute distance measurement based on pulse-to-pulse interferometry. The temporal and dispersive coherence could be utilized to determine the adjustable internal length of multiple pulse-to-pulse intervals with high precision. The proposed scheme was combined with a pellicle beamsplitter to minimize systematic error. The influence of its thickness on precision is also discussed and calibrated in detail. Besides, a femtosecond mode-locked pulse laser with 100-MHz repetition rates was employed in our system to develop an optical scale bar and verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The sub-micron precision could be realized by temporal coherence with a piezo-driven stage or a simplified non-polarized scheme of dispersed coherence.

In particular, flow in microtissue such as microvascular is free of pulsation and backflow. The refreshable Braille actuator-based integrated microfluidic system can be employed with simple microchannels and setups. However, due to high pulsatile flow and backflow, ordinary Braille-driven micropumps generate non-physiological flow conditions. We have described a simple method for creating steady flow employing Braille actuators driven with a high-voltage analog waveform, called \"constant flow waveform\", without incorporating complicated structures into the microchannel or actuator. We determined the constant flow waveform by measuring volume change of microchannel caused by actuated Braille pins using a conventional fluorescent dye and microscope. Using the constant flow waveform, we demonstrated that a Braille-driven pump reduced pulsating flow by 79% and backflow by 63% compared to conventional Braille-driven pump. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a parallel pair of three-stranded pin pumps effectively eliminated backflow by driving two pumps with the constant flow waveform half-cycle shifted to each other. Moreover, by raising the driving frequency, we could increase the average flow rate to ~2\u00d7 higher than previously reported flow rate of a typical Braille-driven micropump.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-02-26", "authors": ["KotaroNishikata", "MasatakaNakamura", "YutoArai", "NobuyukiFutai"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13020294\n10.1126/science.aaw7894\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00715\n10.1186/s40580-021-00261-y\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.08.041\n10.1007/s10544-021-00593-w\n10.1038/s41598-020-63096-3\n10.1039/D0RA00263A\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab9316\n10.3389/fphys.2021.727338\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00861\n10.1039/C2LC40787F\n10.1089/ten.tea.2018.0186\n10.1002/elps.201300205\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119547\n10.1021/acs.analchem.9b03247\n10.1039/C8LC00545A\n10.1088/1361-6439/aafd9c\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.12.132\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110330\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111704\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/6/065019\n10.1002/admt.202100150\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.04.005\n10.3390/mi12091007\n10.1039/D1LC00494H\n10.1073/pnas.0404353101\n10.1021/ac050131o\n10.1063/1.4865855\n10.1039/B510901A\n10.1039/b708187a\n10.1039/c2lc21050a\n10.1038/s41467-018-04919-w\n10.3390/mi4010080\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04689\n10.1002/adma.200400595\n10.1007/s10404-011-0925-z\n10.1016/j.mee.2010.12.108\n10.5334/jors.334\n10.1039/C8LC00333E"}
{"title": "Analysis of Output Performance of a Novel Symmetrical T-Shaped Trapezoidal Micro Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Using a PZT-5H.", "abstract": "In recent years, low-power wireless sensors with high flexibility, portability and computing capability have been extensively applied in areas such as military, medicine and mechanical equipment condition monitoring. In this paper, a novel symmetrical T-shaped trapezoidal micro piezoelectric energy harvester (STTM-PEH) is proposed to supply energy for wireless sensors monitoring the vibrations of mechanical equipment. Firstly, the finite element model (FEM) of the STTM-PEH is established. Secondly, the modal analysis of the T-shaped trapezoidal piezoelectric cantilever beam is carried out by finite element software and its vibration modes are obtained. Additionally, the structural characteristics of the STTM-PEH and the composition of piezoelectric patches are described. Furthermore, the effects of resistance, acceleration coefficient, substrate materials and structural parameters of the output performance of the STTM-PEH are researched. The results indicate that the output power of the STTM-PEH rises first and then falls with a change in resistance, while the output voltage does not increase as resistance increases to a certain extent. Meanwhile, selecting copper as the piezoelectric material of the T-shaped trapezoidal piezoelectric cantilever beam can generate a higher energy output. Finally, how the structural parameters, including piezoelectric patch thickness, substrate thickness and cantilever head length, affect the output performance of the STTM-PEH is studied, which illustrates that the load range of the STTM-PEH can be appropriately broadened by adjusting the length of the cantilever beam head. This research is valuable for designing a novel high performance piezoelectric energy harvester.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-02-26", "authors": ["WendaXu", "HongruiAo", "NannanZhou", "ZenghaoSong", "HongyuanJiang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13020282\n10.1038/s41928-019-0257-7\n10.3390/s19071494\n10.1007/s12652-019-01359-2\n10.1002/adma.201901924\n10.1109/TII.2019.2913535\n10.1155/2018/8475896\n10.1021/acsnano.1c02819\n10.1177/1045389X18758934\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/4/045040\n10.1016/j.mejo.2020.104702\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105567\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112569\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.009\n10.1016/j.enconman.2010.07.024\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117577\n10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.026\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.082\n10.1007/s11071-020-06008-4\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107526\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117274\n10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115354\n10.3923/ajsr.2016.160.166\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/7/075015\n10.1007/s00542-015-2583-7\n10.3390/en14216961\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2018.06.002\n10.1016/j.rser.2020.110473\n10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-01368-1\n10.1007/s10854-021-06416-1\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2017.04.006\n10.1016/j.ijprt.2017.08.001\n10.1109/MPRV.2005.14\n10.1007/s00542-019-04495-z\n10.2514/1.25047\n10.1115/1.2890402"}
{"title": "Wearable Multi-Functional Sensing Technology for Healthcare Smart Detection.", "abstract": "In recent years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of wearable multi-functional sensing technology to fulfill the requirements of healthcare smart detection, and much progress has been achieved. Due to the appealing characteristics of flexibility, stretchability and long-term stability, the sensors have been used in a wide range of applications, such as respiration monitoring, pulse wave detection, gait pattern analysis, etc. Wearable sensors based on single mechanisms are usually capable of sensing only one physiological or motion signal. In order to measure, record and analyze comprehensive physical conditions, it is indispensable to explore the wearable sensors based on hybrid mechanisms and realize the integration of multiple smart functions. Herein, we have summarized various working mechanisms (resistive, capacitive, triboelectric, piezoelectric, thermo-electric, pyroelectric) and hybrid mechanisms that are incorporated into wearable sensors. More importantly, to make wearable sensors work persistently, it is meaningful to combine flexible power units and wearable sensors and form a self-powered system. This article also emphasizes the utility of self-powered wearable sensors from the perspective of mechanisms, and gives applications. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging materials and structures that are applied to achieve high sensitivity.

Massive quantities and huge power consumption of the devices result in a severe increment of the chemical batteries, which is highly associated with problems, including environmental pollution, waste of human/financial resources, difficulty in replacement, etc. Driven by this issue, mechanical energy harvesting technology has been widely studied in the last few years as a great potential solution for battery substitution. Therefore, the piezoelectric generator is characterized as an efficient transformer from ambient vibration into electricity. In this paper, a spoke-like piezoelectric energy harvester is designed and fabricated with detailed introductions on the structure, materials, and fabrication. Focusing on improving the output efficiency and broadening the pulse width, on the one hand, the energy harvesting circuit is optimized by adding voltage monitoring and regulator modules. On the other hand, magnetic mass is adopted to employ the magnetic field of repulsive and upper repulsion-lower attraction mode.

{"title": "Three Frequency Up-Converting Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters Caused by Internal Resonance Mechanism: A Narrative Review.", "abstract": "Low frequency mechanical vibrations are ubiquitous in practical environments, and how to efficiently harvest them with piezoelectric materials remains a challenge. Frequency up-conversion strategies-up-converting low frequency vibrations to high frequency self-oscillations-can improve the power density of piezoelectric materials. This paper mainly introduces a kind of frequency which up-converts piezoelectric energy harvesters based on an internal resonance mechanism, compared with the other mechanisms caused by mechanical impact, mechanical plucking, etc.; the internal resonance-based harvesters can up-convert the frequency under a condition of lower excitation level, less energy loss, and less wideband operation bandwidth. Benefits to practical vibrations also exist in these multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear dynamic systems. Moreover, the value of the frequency up-conversion factor based on the 1:2:6 internal resonance mechanism can reach as much as six so far, which is also a quite a high frequency up-conversion value.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-02-26", "authors": ["JianLiu", "YonglingLu", "ZhenWang", "SenLi", "YipengWu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13020210\n10.21533/pen.v7i3.645\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.122934\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.246\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.044\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.12.034\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.06.028\n10.1007/s11277-019-06889-8\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.120\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.11.024\n10.1007/s40820-021-00644-0\n10.1016/j.powtec.2017.12.065\n10.1007/s11708-019-0632-0\n10.1016/j.isci.2020.101286\n10.1117/1.JMM.13.3.033012\n10.1007/s12541-020-00371-3\n10.1088/0957-0233/21/2/022001\n10.1155/2016/9614842\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.10.102\n10.1063/1.4748794\n10.1007/s12206-019-1006-6\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.10.043\n10.3390/app7121324\n10.1063/1.4940417\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/5/055021\n10.1115/1.4004543\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035005\n10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2019.103273\n10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103173\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.12.027\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/3/035013\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.11.041\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2795708\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.153\n10.1007/s40684-019-00144-y\n10.1063/1.5110368\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.917125\n10.1140/epjst/e2019-800211-8\n10.1115/1.4042002\n10.1007/s00542-014-2261-1\n10.3233/JAE-180074\n10.1177/1045389X18778370\n10.3390/mi10100639\n10.1109/TMECH.2018.2876007\n10.3390/s20216170\n10.1177/1045389X12443016\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.06.029\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.082\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108038\n10.1023/A:1016342326645\n10.1016/j.apm.2011.05.057\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.08.009\n10.1063/1.4949557"}

{"title": "Breakdown Behavior of Metal Contact Positions in GaN HEMT with Nitrogen-Implanted Gate Using TCAD Simulation.", "abstract": "In this study, the breakdown behavior of a calibrated depletion mode AlGaN/GaN transistor with a nitrogen-implanted gate region was simulated and analyzed using Sentaurus TCAD simulation, with particular emphasis on the metal contact design rule for a GaN-based high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) device with a variety of 2DEG concentrations grown on a silicon substrate. The breakdown behaviors for different source/drain contact schemes were investigated using Sentaurus simulation. The metal contact positions within the source and drain exhibited different piezoelectric effects and induced additional polarization charges for the 2DEG (two-dimensional electron gas). Due to the variation of source/drain contact schemes, electron density has changed the way to increase the electric field distribution, which in turn increased the breakdown voltage. The electric field distribution and 2DEG profiles were simulated to demonstrate that the piezoelectric effects at different metal contact positions considerably influence the breakdown voltage at different distances between drain metal contacts. When the contact position was far away from the AlGaN/GaN, the breakdown voltage of the nitrogen-implanted gated device decreased by 41% because of the relatively low electron density and weak induced piezoelectric effect. This reduction is significant for a 20 \u03bcm source-drain length. The minimum critical field used for the breakdown simulation was 4 MV/cm. The simulated AlGaN/GaN device exhibits different breakdown behaviors at different metal contact positions in the drain.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-02-26", "authors": ["GeneSheu", "Yu-LinSong", "RamyasriMogarala", "DupatiSusmitha", "KutagullaIssac"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13020169\n10.1109/icsai48974.2019.9010496\n10.1063/1.369664\n10.1109/LED.2013.2290471\n10.1109/JEDS.2017.2672685\n10.1109/c3it.2015.7060230\n10.1109/TED.2018.2823783\n10.1109/LED.2015.2475178\n10.1109/LED.2015.2404309\n10.1109/LED.2015.2432171\n10.1109/TED.2003.819248\n10.1016/j.microrel.2015.06.126\n10.1109/LED.2012.2224313\n10.1017/S1759078710000097\n10.1109/wipda.2014.6964617\n10.1007/978-981-10-3066-6_1\n10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2004.12.003\n10.1109/55.974794\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.04.001\n10.3390/electronics5020028\n10.3390/mi12070751\n10.1016/j.nimb.2013.05.008\n10.3390/membranes11110899\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.03.001\n10.1109/eiconrus49466.2020.9039032\n10.1063/1.1687983"}

{"title": "Improving Aeroelastic Stability of Bladed Disks with Topologically Optimized Piezoelectric Materials and Intentionally Mistuned Shunt Capacitance.", "abstract": "It is well known that bladed disks with certain patterns of mistuning can have higher aeroelastic stability than their tuned counterparts. This requires small but accurate deviation of the mechanical properties on each blade sector, and currently it is difficult to realize by mechanical manufacturing. In this paper, we propose an adaptive strategy to realize the intentional mistuning for the improvement of aeroelastic stability. The basic idea is to bond or embed piezoelectric materials to each blade and use different shunt capacitance on each blade as the source of mistuning. When the shunt capacitance varies from zero (open-circuit, OC) to infinity (short-circuit, SC), the stiffness of each blade changes within a relatively small interval. In this way, the required small difference of stiffness among blades is altered into a relatively larger difference of the shunt capacitance. This provides a more feasible and robust way to implement the intentional mistuning, provided that the variation interval of blade stiffness between OC and SC contains the limits of required mistuning. Thus, it is critical to maximize the ability of changing the blade stiffness by shunt capacitance with limited amount of piezoelectric materials. To do so, a straightforward approach is proposed to get the best distribution of piezoelectric materials on the blade for the targeting mode. This approach is based on the FE model of the bladed disc, and the piezoelectric materials are introduced by replacing elements (if they are embedded) or adding an extra layer of elements (if they are bonded). An empirical balded disc with NASA-ROTOR37 profile is used as the example. With a proper design of the mistuning pattern and replace use piezoelectric materials of only 10% the blade mass, the proposed method can significantly improve the aeroelastic stability of bladed disks.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-02-26", "authors": ["XinLiu", "YuFan", "LinLi", "XiaopingYu"], "doi": "10.3390/ma15041309\n10.1243/JMES_JOUR_1966_008_004_02\n10.1177/0954410016636916\n10.1115/1.483179\n10.1115/1.483180\n10.1115/1.3239742\n10.1115/1.3072491\n10.1115/1.2812957\n10.1115/1.2720503\n10.1007/s42405-018-0108-1\n10.4236/jpee.2015.34049\n10.1016/j.ast.2018.06.034\n10.1016/0022-460X(91)90762-9\n10.1177/1045389X03031062\n10.1016/j.jsv.2012.03.002\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/3/037002\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/7/075018\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/057001\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/6/065010\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/5/019\n10.1115/DETC2010-28737\n10.1177/1045389X14538533\n10.1115/GT2017-63877\n10.1299/jsme1958.23.880\n10.1080/15376490902746863\n10.1177/1045389X10367835\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/1/015008\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2010.06.005\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2010.06.006\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2013.06.001\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/7/075027"}

{"title": "TRPV4 and PIEZO Channels Mediate the Mechanosensing of Chondrocytes to the Biomechanical Microenvironment.", "abstract": "Articular cartilage and their chondrocytes are physiologically submitted to diverse types of mechanical cues. Chondrocytes produce and maintain the cartilage by sensing and responding to changing mechanical loads. TRPV4 and PIEZOs, activated by mechanical cues, are important mechanosensing molecules of chondrocytes and have pivotal roles in articular cartilage during health and disease. The objective of this review is to introduce the recent progress indicating that the mechanosensitive ion channels, TRPV4 and PIEZOs, are involved in the chondrocyte sensing of mechanical and inflammatory cues. We present a focus on the important role of TRPV4 and PIEZOs in the mechanotransduction regulating diverse chondrocyte functions in the biomechanical microenvironment. The review synthesizes the most recent advances in our understanding of how mechanical stimuli affect various cellular behaviors and functions through differentially activating TRPV4 and PIEZO ion channels in chondrocyte. Advances in understanding the complex roles of TRPV4/PIEZO-mediated mechanosignaling mechanisms have the potential to recapitulate physiological biomechanical microenvironments and design cell-instructive biomaterials for cartilage tissue engineering.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-02-26", "authors": ["MinZhang", "NanMeng", "XiaoxiaoWang", "WeiyiChen", "QuanyouZhang"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12020237\n10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2006.07.001\n10.1113/JP275451\n10.1007/s10237-018-1068-x\n10.1016/j.berh.2011.11.013\n10.1016/j.matbio.2020.11.002\n10.1038/s41584-021-00724-w\n10.1016/j.copbio.2021.09.011\n10.1002/art.24799\n10.1073/pnas.1414298111\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2016.10.003\n10.1186/ar2592\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.08.032\n10.1016/j.matbio.2018.05.008\n10.1007/978-94-007-2888-2_46\n10.1002/jor.23768\n10.1006/cbir.2001.0826\n10.1002/jor.20809\n10.1007/s00011-011-0414-6\n10.1002/art.22717\n10.1042/CBI20110432\n10.1242/jcs.067009\n10.1177/2309499020950262\n10.1073/pnas.1319569111\n10.1038/nrn2149\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.033\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010919-023703\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.09.004\n10.1038/nrm.2017.92\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00143-4\n10.1038/35036318\n10.1080/19336950.2021.1903184\n10.1080/03008207.2021.2007902\n10.1113/jphysiol.2005.088963\n10.3389/fphys.2010.00135\n10.1111/1440-1681.12917\n10.1038/s41594-018-0037-5\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.2.1.691\n10.1074/jbc.M706158200\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.031\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2021.0169\n10.1126/sciadv.abd9858\n10.7554/eLife.21074\n10.1016/j.joca.2020.08.002\n10.1073/pnas.0303329101\n10.1073/pnas.2001611118\n10.1074/jbc.M308212200\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2008.10.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011654\n10.1016/j.ceca.2021.102467\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.05.003\n10.7554/eLife.12088\n10.1002/jor.22348\n10.1002/jor.21552\n10.1016/j.orthres.2004.02.002\n10.1177/1535370219892601\n10.1038/srep29053\n10.1038/s41598-021-94938-3\n10.1038/s41586-020-2612-2\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-061008-124915\n10.1016/j.matbio.2019.11.005\n10.1007/s11926-019-0837-6\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.12.017\n10.1038/s41467-019-08465-x\n10.1038/s41551-021-00691-3\n10.1038/s41584-021-00649-4\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2020.109729\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.608951\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1038/s42003-019-0514-3"}

{"title": "Membrane Distillation Hybrid Peroxydisulfate Activation toward Mitigating the Membrane Wetting by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate.", "abstract": "The fouling/wetting of hydrophobic membrane caused by organic substances with low-surface energy substantially limits the development of the membrane distillation (MD) process. The sulfate radical (SO4&nbsp;\u00b7-)-based advanced oxidation process (AOP) has been a promising technology to degrade organics in wastewater treatment, and peroxydisulfate (PDS) could be efficiently activated by heat. Thus, a hybrid process of MD-AOP via PDS activated by a hot feed was hypothesized to mitigate membrane fouling/wetting. Experiments dealing with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) containing a salty solution via two commercial membranes (PVDF and PTFE) were performed, and varying membrane wetting extents in the coupling process were discussed at different PDS concentrations and feed temperatures. Our results demonstrated permeate flux decline and a rise in conductivity due to membrane wetting by SDS, which was efficiently alleviated in the hybrid process rather than the standalone MD process. Moreover, such a mitigation was enhanced by a higher PDS concentration up to 5 mM and higher feed temperature. In addition, qualitative characterization on membrane coupons wetted by SDS was successfully performed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS results implied both types of hydrophobic membranes were protected from losing their hydrophobicity in the presence of PDS activation, agreeing with our initial hypothesis. This work could provide insight into future fouling/wetting control strategies for hydrophobic membranes and facilitate the development of an MD process.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2022-02-26", "authors": ["MinyuanHan", "RuixueZhao", "JianchaoShi", "XiaoboLi", "DaolingHe", "LangLiu", "LeHan"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes12020164\n10.1016/j.watres.2019.03.021\n10.1016/j.desal.2020.114643\n10.1016/j.watres.2018.03.058\n10.1021/acs.est.0c05454\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.10.018\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.02.049\n10.1021/acsami.0c03577\n10.4491/eer.2020.377\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117196\n10.1021/acsestengg.0c00025\n10.1016/j.desal.2019.07.008\n10.1021/acs.est.1c04443\n10.1021/acs.est.7b02848\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121281\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.04.035\n10.1016/j.desal.2021.115225\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117639\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.127255\n10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112708\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.02.055\n10.1016/j.watres.2021.117971\n10.1021/acs.est.9b05141\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118078\n10.1016/j.desal.2021.115199\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.04.045\n10.1021/acs.estlett.7b00372\n10.1021/acs.est.8b02578\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.11.006\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.04.047\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116823\n10.3390/membranes10090214\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.012\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.01.027\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117495\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.01.061\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.07.010\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.024\n10.1016/j.desal.2021.115036\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.03.069\n10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00544\n10.1021/acsapm.0c00991\n10.1021/acs.est.9b06023\n10.1007/s10311-017-0703-6\n10.1016/j.serj.2017.11.002"}

Neat polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and PVDF hollow fiber membrane with the incorporation of antibacterial agent zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles with various loading (2.5-7.5 wt.%) were fabricated by using dry/wet spinning method. The membrane structure, particle distribution, functional group, hydrophilicity, and pore size of each membrane were all assessed. The result shows that all ZnO/PVDF hollow fiber membranes have the asymmetric structure with even dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles throughout the membranes. The results showed that increased ZnO loadings considerably improved membrane hydrophilicity, and average pore size, in addition to good performance of pure water flux. Antibacterial testing shows that ZnO incorporated in the membrane matrix and membrane surfaces prevents bacteria that cause biofouling from adhering to the membrane.

Next, the investigated membranes were applied for the sorption and desorption of lithium chloride.

Considering the desorption efficiency, membranes modified by four days were selected for further evaluation. The application in the HCDI process allowed reaching the desorption efficiency at 90%.

{"title": "An experimental technique for evaluating viscoelastic damping using ultrasonic guided waves.", "abstract": "This work presents an innovative approach according to an experiment-based fitting method to determine the damping property of a viscoelastic coating layer, in a simple, low-cost, and time-effective manner. In this experiment, symmetric and asymmetric ultrasonic Lamb waves were applied to two coated plates with different thicknesses, and the waves were generated using piezo discs. A viscoelastic coating influences the signal amplitude as well as the wave phase. By comparing the amplitude ratio (AR) of the transmitting signals between the coated and bare plates, the damping property of the viscoelastic coating was experimentally determined. Similar to the experiments employing the finite element method (FEM) software, in this experiment, ABAQUS, was employed to verify the conformity between numerical and experimental AR. By selecting a non-dispersive Rayleigh damping \u03b2 for the coating layers at all frequencies, the computational cost reduced significantly to one-tenth the original cost. Apart from corroboration by AR matching, the numerical dispersion curves of the group velocity were also validated by experimental curves. The FEM dispersion curves in the frequency range of the tests were found to be highly reliable, with an average error of less than 1% for the first experimental setup and 10% for the second setup. Furthermore, in coated waveguides, the proposed technique could precisely estimate the damping property of the viscoelastic coating layers, where excitability in a wide range of frequencies is required. However, this precision strongly relies on the selected mode, frequency range, PZT quality, and waveguide thickness.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2022-02-25", "authors": ["MohammadMehrabi", "MohammadHossein Soorgee", "HosseinHabibi", "VassiliosKappatos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106707"}

{"title": "A review of vibration energy harvesting in rail transportation field.", "abstract": "In this paper, we review, compare, and analyze previous studies on vibration energy harvesting and related technologies. First, the paper introduces the basic aspects of vibration energy acquisition in the railway environment, including vibration frequency, train speed, energy flow in the train, and vibration energy harvesting potential. Generally, the methods for scavenging vibration energy caused by passing trains can be divided into four categories: electromagnetic harvesters, piezoelectric harvesters, triboelectric harvesters, and hydraulic harvesters. The structure, output performance, merits, and disadvantages of different energy harvesting strategies are summarized and compared.

{"title": "An analytical study of sound transmission loss of functionally graded sandwich cylindrical nanoshell integrated with piezoelectric layers.", "abstract": "The multidisciplinary nature of piezoelectric (PZ) structures necessitates precise and efficient methods to express their behavior under different conditions. This article extends the general usage of PZ materials by introducing acoustic and fluid loading effects in a way that an unfilled multilayer cylindrical nanoshell with a functionally graded (FG) material core and PZ layers is subjected to preliminary external electric load, acoustic waves and external flow motion. As the properties of a functionally graded material changes along the shell thickness, a power law model is assumed to be governing such variations of desired characteristics. Evidently, this system includes different types of couplings and a comprehensive approach is required to describe the structural response. To this aim, the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is used to define different displacement components. Next, the coupled size-dependent vibroacoustic equations are derived based on in conjunction with nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT) with the aid of Hamilton's variational principle and fluid/structure compatibility conditions. NSGT is complemented with hardening and softening material effects which can greatly enhance the precision of results. It is expected to use the findings of this paper in the optimization of similar systems by selecting suitable FG index, incident angle of sound waves, flow Mach number, nonlocal and strain gradient parameters, starting electric potential and geometric features. One of the important findings of this study is that increasing the electric voltage can obtain better sound insulation at small frequencies, specially prior to the ring frequency.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2022-02-25", "authors": ["ChanachaiThongchom", "Pouyan RoodgarSaffari", "NimaRefahati", "Peyman RoudgarSaffari", "HosseinPourbashash", "SayanSirimontree", "SuraparbKeawsawasvong"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-06905-1\n10.1080/01495739.2015.1073986\n10.1007/s11012-016-0469-0\n10.1007/s00542-016-3133-7\n10.1007/s00542-017-3654-8\n10.1007/s00339-017-0784-x\n10.22034/jsm.2019.1865985.1420\n10.1016/j.actaastro.2016.10.001\n10.1016/j.physb.2016.12.033\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.075505\n10.1021/NL071986E\n10.1016/0020-7225(72)90050-X\n10.1063/1.332803\n10.1016/S0020-7683(02)00152-X\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/11/015\n10.1016/S0022-5096(03)00053-X\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.01.026\n10.1007/s00707-016-1570-0\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/10/105035\n10.1016/j.jmps.2015.02.001\n10.1007/s11071-016-2992-x\n10.22034/JSM.2019.1865985.1420\n10.1016/J.JSV.2013.11.038"}

In this work, filtration modeling was performed in combination with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis to investigate the membrane fouling mechanism. Sodium alginate (SA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used to perform dead-end filtration on hydrophilic and hydrophobic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes. The initial foulant deposition and layer formation on membranes as well as the interaction between the BSA and SA were comprehensively analyzed. Results indicated that during SA filtration, initial fouling on hydrophilic membranes were primarily attributed to the particle-membrane interactions, while the fouling on the hydrophobic membrane were dominantly caused by the interactions among SA particles. The interaction between BSA and SA led to more severe membrane fouling and hydrophobic membrane was more sensitive to it, especially in the initial filtration process. The SPR results helped clarify the in-situ deposition behavior of BSA and SA particles on the PVDF surface. Compared to SA, BSA adsorbed faster on the PVDF membrane, and specific interactions played an essential role in BSA adsorption, whereas the deposition of SA on PVDF could be easily removed by shear force. Interactions between BSA and SA could alleviate the bonding between BSA and the PVDF membrane.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2022-02-23", "authors": ["ChaoZhang", "QiBao", "HuananWu", "MingshuaiShao", "XueWang", "QiyongXu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.134056"}

Nevertheless, the electrical performance of piezoelectric polymers is very hard to reach that of piezoelectric ceramics basically and physically, even in the case of the representative ferroelectric polymer, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)). Very recently, the concept for the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), which has been exclusive in the field of high-performance piezoelectric ceramics, has been surprisingly confirmed in P(VDF-TrFE) piezoelectric copolymers by the groups. This study demonstrates the exceptional behaviors reminiscent of MPB and relaxor ferroelectrics in the feature of widely utilized electrospun P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers. Consequently, an energy harvesting device that exceeds the performance limitation of the existing P(VDF-TrFE) materials is developed.

Its role as a physical barrier to the outside world as well as its endocrinological and immunological functions subject it to continuous internal and external mechanical forces. Thus, mechanotransduction is of the utmost importance for the skin in order to process and leverage mechanical input for its various functions. Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel that is a primary mediator of mechanotransduction and is highly expressed in the skin. The discovery of Piezo1 earned a Nobel Prize, and has had a profound impact on our understanding of physiology and pathology including paramount contributions in cutaneous biology. This review provides insight into the roles of Piezo1 in the development, physiology and pathology of the skin with a special emphasis on the molecular pathways through which it instigates these various roles. In epidermal homeostasis, Piezo1 mediates cell extrusion in conditions of overcrowding and division in conditions of low cellular density. Piezo1 also aids in orchestrating mechanosensation, DNA protection from mechanical stress and the various components of wound healing. Conversely, Piezo1 is pathologically implicated in melanoma progression, wound healing delay, cutaneous scarring and hair loss.

The purpose of this article was to outline through case reports the progression of piezo-guided surgery in a resident setting.\nThe first 2 evolutions of the technique used a surgeon-defined method for site location. This third and final evolution uses a digital workflow to virtually plan the surgical procedure, integrating Standard Tessellation Language and Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine files to create 3-dimensional guides with exacting resection locations, levels, and angles. Export of the virtually planned guide in postproduction generates the precision endodontic surgical stent to accurately define the site location and parameters of the procedure. All surgeries were executed using the piezosurgical method with increasing levels of guidance and precision throughout the evolution process.\nEach step in the technique implementation enabled the resident to assimilate a new technique and skill set while maintaining bone architecture and minimizing volume loss postoperatively. The patient benefits were an increase in intraoperative safety and postoperative comfort. The resident benefits were accelerated regeneration timetables and increases in the confidence level of the resident and the number of scheduled posterior surgical procedures.\nThe progression from crude on-site measurements to elegant and precise surgical guides enabled the access and manipulations of difficult surgical sites without compromising visibility, postoperative osseous regeneration, or patient comfort.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2022-02-20", "authors": ["Stephen PNiemczyk", "FrederickBarnett", "James DJohnson", "RonaldOrdinola-Zapata", "AnnaGlinianska", "Jin-HweiJulianna Bair", "Austin SungminJang", "AndrewVo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2022.02.004"}

{"title": "A New Self-Healing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Polyurethane Coating and Its Application for Self-Powered Cathodic Protection.", "abstract": "With the increasing demand for carbon neutrality, the development of renewable and recycle green energy has attracted wide attention from researchers. A novel self-healing triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was constructed by applying a linear silicone-modified polyurethane (PU) coating as a triboelectric layer, which was obtained by reacting hydroxypropyl silicone oil and hexamethylene diisocyanate under the catalysis of Sn. The linear self-healing coating as the friction electrode could effectively alleviate the damages of TENG devices during long-term energy harvesting. When the triboelectric layer of the TENG device shows abrasion, the broken silicone-modified polyurethane polymer chains would gradually be cross-linked again through hydrogen bonding to achieve a self-healing effect. The entire self-healing process of the friction coating could be completed in 30 min at room temperature. The PU-based self-healing TENG exhibits an evident and stable output performance with a short-circuit current of 31.9 \u03bcA and output voltage of 517.5 V after multiple cutting-healing cycles, which could light 480 commercial LEDs. Besides, a self-powered cathodic protection system supplied by the self-healing TENG was constructed, which could transfer negative triboelectric charges to the protected metal surface to achieve an anti-corrosion effect by harvesting mechanical energy. Due to the self-healing characteristics of the TENG device as the power supply part, this intelligent system possesses great application potential in the long-term corrosion protection of multiple metal application industries, such as the marine industry.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2022-02-19", "authors": ["WeixiangSun", "NingLuo", "YuboLiu", "HaoLi", "DaoaiWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.2c00881"}

Through numerical simulation, the performance of three common piezoelectric substrate materials was compared qualitatively and quantitatively, and it was found that the output sound pressure intensity of 128\u00b0YX-LiNbO3 was high and the output was stable.

{"title": "Construction of a Pig Alveolar Cleft Model in Imitation of Cleft Lip and Palate Congenital Deformity.", "abstract": "Alveolar cleft repair is a key step in multiple disciplinary treatment for patients with cleft lip/and palate. Although autologous bone grafting has been used worldwide over the past half century, alternative advanced techniques, such as the use of bone substitutes and guided tissue regeneration, have shown their great potentials and have been recommended by a growing number of physicians and surgeons. The employment of new therapeutic approaches and devices in clinical routine requires tremendous experimental efforts and appropriate animal models with similar sizes and sites of deformity to that of human both anatomically and physiologically. The aim of this study is to develop a juvenile porcine model with surgically created alveolar clefts imitating congenital alveolar cleft in the cleft lip and palate. Alveolar defects between second incisor and canine were surgically created in two miniature pigs (unilateral cleft in P1 and P2); bilateral alveolar defects were surgically created between first and third incisor in one miniature pig (P3) using piezo surgery. Pigs were sacrificed (P1 at 1 month after the surgery and P2 at 3 months postoperatively) and the evaluation of defects were performed by assessing result from the computed tomography (CT) scan and histopathological examination. Postoperative CT scan results showed that the size of the defect remained the same, whereas the edge of the defect became irregular 3 months after the surgery. In all pig subjects, histopathological examination found no sign of osteogenesis in the area of defect, indicating that our surgical procedure was successful in establishing porcine models for alveolar cleft in congenital cleft lip and palate. In conclusion, we developed alveolar cleft in porcine models to mimic the size, site, and environment of congenital alveolar cleft in cleft lip and palate. The novel animal model can be employed in pilot studies for the purpose of optimizing the current surgical treatment techniques as well as developing new treatment procedures and test the bone substitute materials. The bilateral model can be applied in further control studies. Impact statement Cancellous iliac bone graft was the most popular surgical technique as well as the gold standard to reconstruct alveolar cleft. Nevertheless, several disadvantages exist regarding the additional surgical field of donor side and delayed age of alveolar bone grafting. Bone tissue-engineered strategy offers a promising alternative to address the gap in the current limitation of autologous bone to treat the growing craniofacial skeleton. Among different species of laboratory animals, porcine is suitable for oral and maxillofacial bone and implant-related research, where alveolar defect can be surgically developed simulating the size and site of alveolar cleft occurring together with cleft lip and palate. In this proposal, a reproducible porcine model of alveolar bone defect imitating congenital alveolar cleft during craniofacial growing stage is successfully constructed that will show great potential application in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

The ability of explicit-electron models to describe chemical reactions and electronic response properties has already been demonstrated, yet the description of short-range interactions for a broad range of chemical systems remains challenging. In this work, we present the electron machine learning potential (eMLP), a new explicit electron force field in which the short-range interactions are modeled with machine learning. The electron pair particles will be located at well-defined positions, derived from localized molecular orbitals or Wannier centers, naturally imposing the correct dielectric and piezoelectric behavior of the system.

The patients were grouped according to the methods of nasal pyramid surgery-Push Down (PD), Let Down (LD) with Rhinosculpture (Rs), or the combinations. The results of the surgeries with the application of PEIs on 134 patients were retrospectively analyzed before the surgery and 12 months after it according to the \"Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation\" (ROE).\nThe average age of the patients was 28, 125 were female and 9 were male.

{"title": "Stemness Maintenance and Massproduction of Neural Stem Cells on Poly L-Lactic Acid Nanofibrous Membrane Based on Piezoelectriceffect.", "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy is promising for treating neurodegenerative disorders and neural injuries. However, the limited in vitro expansion, spontaneous differentiation, and decrease in stemness obstruct the acquisition of high quantities of NSCs, restricting the clinical application of cell-based therapies and tissue engineering. This article reports a facile method of promoting NSCs expansion and maintaining stemness using wireless electrical stimulation triggered by piezoelectric nanomaterials. A nanofibrous membrane of poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) is prepared by electrostatic spinning, and the favorable piezoelectric property of PLLA facilitates the freeing of electrons after transformation. These self-powered electric signals generated by PLLA significantly enhance NSCs proliferation. Further, an undifferentiated cellular state is maintained in the NSCs cultured on the surfaces of PLLA nanofibers exposed to ultrasonic vibration. In addition, the neural differentiation potencies and functions of NSCs expanded by piezoelectric-driven localized electricity are not attenuated. Moreover, cell stemness can be maintained by wireless electric stimulation. Taken together, the electronic signals mediated by PLLA nanofibers facilitate NSCs proliferation. This efficient and simple strategy can maintain the stemness of NSCs during proliferation, which is essential for their clinical application, and opens up opportunities for the mass production of NSCs for use in cell therapy.", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2022-02-16", "authors": ["XihengLu", "ChunhuiSun", "LuChen", "ZhichaoFeng", "HaoyangGao", "ShuangHu", "MengweiDong", "JingangWang", "WeijiaZhou", "NaRen", "HengxingZhou", "HongLiu"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.202107236"}
{"title": "The Role of Phase Migration of Carbon Nanotubes in Melt-Mixed PVDF/PE Polymer Blends for High Conductivity and EMI Shielding Applications.", "abstract": "In this work, the effects of blend ratio and mixing time on the migration of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) within poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/polyethylene (PE) blends are studied. A novel two-step mixing approach was used to pre-localize MWCNTs within the PE phase, and subsequently allow them to migrate into the thermodynamically favored PVDF phase. Light microscopy images confirm that MWCNTs migrate from PE to PVDF, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show individual MWCNTs migrating fully into PVDF, while agglomerates remained trapped at the PVDF/PE interface. PVDF:PE 50:50 and 20:80 polymer blend nanocomposites with 2 vol% MWCNTs exhibit exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) at 10 min of mixing (13 and 16 dB, respectively-at a thickness of 0.45 mm), when compared to 30 s of mixing (11 and 12 dB, respectively), suggesting the formation of more interconnected MWCNT networks over time. TEM images show that these improved microstructures are concentrated on the PE side of the PVDF/PE interface. A modified version of the \"Slim-Fast-Mechanism\" is proposed to explain the migration behavior of MWCNTs within the PVDF/PE blend. In this theory, MWCNTs approaching perpendicular to the interface penetrate the PVDF/PE interface, while those approaching in parallel or as MWCNT agglomerates remain trapped. Trapped MWCNTs act as barriers to additional MWCNTs, regardless of geometry. This mechanism is verified via TEM and scanning electron microscopy and suggests the feasibility of localizing MWCNTs at the interface of PVDF/PE blends.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-02-16", "authors": ["CalinLencar", "ShashankRamakrishnan", "ElnazErfanian", "UttandaramanSundararaj"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules27030933\n10.1039/C4TA04559A\n10.1002/mame.200800060\n10.1016/j.carbon.2009.02.030\n10.1021/acs.iecr.8b05957\n10.1016/S0379-6779(99)00061-2\n10.1002/adv.1995.060140205\n10.1016/j.polymer.2016.01.010\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2010.01.008\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.05.067\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107614\n10.1063/1.5129817\n10.1016/j.polymer.2017.02.082\n10.1016/j.carbon.2012.06.053\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.04.039\n10.1016/j.synthmet.2013.05.004\n10.3139/217.2778\n10.1016/j.polymer.2003.12.013\n10.1002/macp.201800306\n10.1021/acsami.1c05720\n10.1007/BF00310802\n10.1007/BF00652179\n10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2009.11.007\n10.1021/bm801183f\n10.1016/j.carbon.2014.02.063\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2021.108956\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2021.101471\n10.1016/S0032-3861(98)00096-2\n10.1021/bm100135n\n10.1002/mame.200900242\n10.1002/adv.21427\n10.1002/macp.201000579\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.05.024\n10.1016/j.polymer.2013.04.012\n10.1021/ma200793a\n10.1088/0022-3727/28/2/028\n10.1002/marc.200700637\n10.1002/pen.20078\n10.1016/j.synthmet.2011.04.033\n10.1016/j.carbon.2013.04.008\n10.1002/app.1969.070130815\n10.1007/s11664-019-07371-8\n10.1016/j.carbon.2006.11.020\n10.1109/TDEI.2004.1349779\n10.1109/TDEI.2005.1511089\n10.1021/am3030239\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2015.09.053\n10.1021/acs.macromol.8b01774\n10.1016/j.mtcomm.2020.101010\n10.1063/1.5018863\n10.1080/00218460500189489\n10.1021/acs.macromol.7b02353"}

Understanding their function is important for elucidating the mechanosensitive mechanisms of a range of human diseases. Recently, Piezo channels were suggested to be contributors to migraine pain generation. Migraine is typically characterized by allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia associated with the activation and sensitization of trigeminal ganglion (TG) nerve fibers. Notably, migraine specific medicines are ineffective for other types of pain, suggesting a distinct underlying mechanism. To address, in a straightforward manner, the specificity of the mechanosensitivity of trigeminal vs. somatic nerves, we compared the activity of Piezo1 channels in mouse TG neurons vs. dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. We assessed the functional expression of Piezo1 receptors using a conventional live calcium imaging setup equipped with a multibarrel application system and utilizing a microfluidic chip-based setup.

{"title": "Multi-Physics Mesoscale Substructure Analysis on Stress Wave Measurement within CFST-PZT Coupling Models for Interface Debonding Detection.", "abstract": "In recent years, the development of interface debonding defect detection methods for concrete-filled steel tubes (CFSTs) using stress wave measurement with piezoelectric-lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) actuator and sensor has received significant attention. Because the concrete core in CFSTs is a heterogeneous material with randomness at the mesoscale, the size, position and distribution of aggregates unavoidably affect the stress wave propagation and the PZT sensor response. In this study, to efficiently investigate the influence of the mesoscale structure of the concrete core of CFSTs on the response of embedded PZT sensors, a multi-physics substructure model of CFST members coupled with a PZT actuator and a PZT sensor, where a single circular aggregate with different size and position and randomly distributed circular aggregates are considered, are established first. Then, multi-physics simulations on the effect of the local mesoscale structure of the concrete core on the response of the embedded PZT sensor excited by both a sinusoidal signal and sweep frequency signal are carried out. Moreover, corresponding multi-physics and mesoscale simulations on the embedded PZT sensor response of substructures with different interface debonding defects are also carried out for comparison. The amplitude and the wavelet packet energy of the embedded PZT sensor response of each mesoscale substructure are employed to distinguish the influence of the concrete core mesoscale structure and interface debonding defect on sensor measurement. The findings from the results with the multi-physics coupling substructure models are compared with those of the full CFST-PZT coupling models and the tested members of the previous studies to verify the rationality of the embedded PZT sensors measurement of the established substructure models. Results from this study show that the effect of interface debonding defect on the amplitude and the wavelet packet energy of the embedded PZT sensor measurement of the CFST members is dominant compared with the mesoscale heterogeneity and randomness of the concrete core.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-02-16", "authors": ["JiangWang", "BinXu", "HongbingChen", "HanbinGe", "TianminZhou"], "doi": "10.3390/s22031039\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112778\n10.1109/TAP.2016.2526043\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.047\n10.3390/s18113958\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.125838\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.05.052\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.118375\n10.1016/1065-7355(95)90037-3\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.123832\n10.1016/S0013-7944(97)00010-6\n10.1103/PhysRevB.60.2391\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-3951(200001)217:1<251::AID-PSSB251>3.0.CO;2-A\n10.12989/sss.2010.6.7.851\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.02.094\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.09.006\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000632\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.10.060\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000876\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.10.002\n10.12989/sss.2017.19.2.181\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2017.05.040\n10.1088/1361-665X/aae23b\n10.3390/s19153248\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106644\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.07.047\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.01.041\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108135\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.074"}

{"title": "The Driving Waveform Design Method of Power-Law Fluid Piezoelectric Printing Based on Iterative Learning Control.", "abstract": "In some applications of piezoelectric three-dimensional inkjet printing, the materials used are power-law fluids as they are shear thinning. Their time-varying viscosities affect the droplet formation, which is determined by the volume flow rate at the nozzle outlet. To obtain a fine printing effect, it is necessary to present a driving waveform design method that considers the shear-thinning viscosities of materials to control the volume flow rate at the nozzle outlet, which lays the foundation for the single and stable droplet generation during the printing process. In this research, we established the relationship between the driving waveform and the volume flow rate at the nozzle outlet by modifying a model that describes the inkjet mechanism of power-law fluid. The modified model was used to present a driving waveform design method based on iterative learning control. The iterative learning law of the method was designed based on the gradient descent algorithm and demonstrated its convergence.

{"title": "Impact Damage Detection Using Chirp Ultrasonic Guided Waves for Development of Health Monitoring System for CFRP Mobility Structures.", "abstract": "When impact damage occurs in carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) structures, it is barely visible but may cause significant degradation in the mechanical properties of the structure. Hence, a structural health monitoring (SHM) system that can be installed in CFRP mobility structures and is sensitive to impact damage is needed. In this study, we attempted to establish an SHM system based on ultrasonic guided waves, which are generated by inputting a broadband chirp signal into a film-like piezoelectric actuator. The relationship between impact damage size and maximum time-of-flight (ToF) delay was investigated for three types of CFRP plates: woven, non-woven, and hybrid laminates. As a result, it was found that the maximum ToF delay increased linearly with an increase in the damage size for all CFRP laminates.

{"title": "Optimal Array Design and Directive Sensors for Guided Waves DoA Estimation.", "abstract": "The estimation of Direction of Arrival (DoA) of guided ultrasonic waves is an important task in many Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications. The aim is to locate sources of elastic waves which can be generated by impacts or defects in the inspected structures. In this paper, the array geometry and the shape of the piezo-sensors are designed to optimize the DoA estimation on a pre-defined angular sector, from acquisitions affected by noise and interference. In the proposed approach, the DoA of a wave generated by a single source is considered as a random variable that is uniformly distributed in a given range. The wave velocity is assumed to be unknown and the DoA estimation is performed by measuring the Differences in Time of Arrival (DToAs) of wavefronts impinging on the sensors. The optimization procedure of sensors positioning is based on the computation of the DoA and wave velocity parameters Cram\u00e9r-Rao Matrix Bound (CRMB) with a Bayesian approach. An efficient DoA estimator is found based on the DToAs Gauss-Markov estimator for a three sensors array. Moreover, a novel directive sensor for guided waves is introduced to cancel out undesired Acoustic Sources impinging from DoAs out of the given angles range. Numerical results show the capability to filter directional interference of the novel sensor and a considerably improved DoA estimation performance provided by the optimized sensor cluster in the pre-defined angular sector, as compared to conventional approaches.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-02-16", "authors": ["MarcoDibiase", "MasoudMohammadgholiha", "LucaDe Marchi"], "doi": "10.3390/s22030780\n10.1177/0583102405052561\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.11.013\n10.1088/0964-1726/9/3/308\n10.1177/1475921710395815\n10.1109/78.301830\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.01.012\n10.1002/stc.2701\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.06.009\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.01.017\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.02.021\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.01.011\n10.1109/TSP.2005.845487\n10.1109/TSA.2003.818027\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2012.02.002\n10.1109/TAP.1986.1143830\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896979\n10.1109/TSP.2014.2388436\n10.3390/app10228150\n10.1088/1361-665X/aab19e\n10.1121/1.3626165\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.05.013\n10.1109/TIT.1973.1055077\n10.1109/LSP.2004.826636\n10.6028/jres.070C.025\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1962\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/5/055026\n10.1121/1.382599"}

Compared with other specimens, specimens with SL/FA = 40%:60% had the highest electromechanical coupling coefficient (Kt = 77.67%, Kp = 71%). Therefore, the specimen with SL/FA = 40%:60% was chosen to explore the effect of the sodium silicate modulus. Additionally, the specimen with SL/FA = 40%:60% and a sodium silicate modulus of 1.3 had the best electromechanical conversion efficiency with Kt = 75.68% and Kp = 75.95%.

Mechanical comparisons are scarcely reported in the literature, so the purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the mechanical behavior of different sutures commonly used in oral surgery in terms of traction resistance. Sutures made of eight different materials were analyzed: silk (S), polyglycolide-co-caprolactone (PGCL), polypropylene (PP), rapid polyglycolide (rPGA), standard polyglycolide (PGA), polyamide (PA), polyester (PE), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). For each material, three different sizes were tested: 3-0, 4-0, and 5-0. The breaking force of each suture was assessed with a uniaxial testing machine after being immersed in artificial saliva at 37 \u00b0C. The outcomes analyzed were the breaking force, the needle-thread detachment breaking-point and the node response after forward-reverse-forward (FRF) tying when subjected to a tensile force. The 3-0 rPGA provided the maximum resistance, while the lowest value was recorded for the 5-0 PGCL. In general, 3-0 and 4-0 gauges showed non-statistically significant differences in terms of needle-thread detachment. The highest needle-thread detachment was found for the 3-0 PGA, whereas the lowest value was observed for the 5-0 PGCL. After tying the knot with an FRF configuration, the thread that showed the highest resistance to tension was the 3/0 silk, while the thread with the lowest resistance was the 5/0 silk.

{"title": "Mechanical Shunt Resonators-Based Piezoelectric Metamaterial for Elastic Wave Attenuation.", "abstract": "The conventional piezoelectric metamaterials with operational-amplifier-based shunt circuits have limited application due to the voltage restriction of the amplifiers. In this research, we report a novel piezoelectric metamaterial beam that takes advantage of mechanical shunt resonators. The proposed metamaterial beam consisted of a piezoelectric beam and remote mechanical piezoelectric resonators coupled with electrical wires. The local resonance of the remote mechanical shunt resonators modified the mechanical properties of the beam, yielding an elastic wave attenuation capability.

The Janus membrane of cPVA-PVDF/PMMA/GO with opposite hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties was prepared by layer-by-layer electrospinning. The structure of the Janus membrane is as follows: firstly, the mixed solution of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and graphene oxide (GO) was electrospun to form a hydrophobic layer, then polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofiber was coated onto the hydrophobic membrane by layer-by-layer electrospinning to form a composite membrane, and finally, the composite membrane was crosslinked to obtain a Janus membrane. The addition of GO can significantly improve the hydrophobicity, mechanical strength and stability of the Janus membrane. In addition, the prepared Janus membrane still maintained good oil-water separation performance and its separation efficiency almost did not decrease after many oil-water separation experiments.

{"title": "Comprehensive Characterization of PVDF Nanofibers at Macro- and Nanolevel.", "abstract": "This study is focused on the characterization and investigation of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers from the point of view of macro- and nanometer level. The fibers were produced using electrostatic spinning process in air. Two types of fibers were produced since the collector speed (300 rpm and 2000 rpm) differed as the only one processing parameter. Differences in fiber's properties were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with cross-sections observation utilizing focused ion beam (FIB). The phase composition was determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The crystallinity was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and chemical analysis of fiber's surfaces and bonding states were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Other methods, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM), were employed to describe morphology and piezoelectric response of single fiber, respectively. Moreover, the wetting behavior (hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity) was also studied. It was found that collector speed significantly affects fibers alignment and wettability (directionally ordered fibers produced at 2000 rpm almost super-hydrophobic in comparison with disordered fibers spun at 300 rpm with hydrophilic behavior) as properties at macrolevel. However, it was confirmed that these differences at the macrolevel are closely connected and originate from nanolevel attributes. The study of single individual fibers revealed some protrusions on the fiber's surface, and fibers spun at 300 rpm had a core-shell design, while fibers spun at 2000 rpm were hollow.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-02-16", "authors": ["TatianaPisarenko", "NikolaPape\u017e", "DinaraSobola", "\u015etefan\u0162\u0103lu", "Kl\u00e1ra\u010c\u00e1stkov\u00e1", "Pavel\u0160karvada", "RobertMack\u016f", "Erik\u0160\u010dasnovi\u010d", "JaroslavKa\u0161tyl"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14030593\n10.3390/ma14206096\n10.3390/polym13152439\n10.1038/s41598-020-78706-3\n10.1021/acsabm.1c00099\n10.3390/nano10061221\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106586\n10.1002/polb.24752\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01108\n10.1021/acsnano.9b02483\n10.1088/1757-899X/460/1/012013\n10.1021/acsanm.0c01562\n10.1016/b978-1-4557-7631-3.00007-7\n10.1016/b978-1-78242-465-9.00012-4\n10.1533/9780857090348.342\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105066\n10.1016/j.egyr.2020.02.003\n10.3390/s19061404\n10.3390/s18061682\n10.1002/ADFM.201903633\n10.1006/biol.1996.0018\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116887\n10.1039/C6TA09590A\n10.1007/978-3-662-45240-0\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.130247\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2020.110941\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.09.117\n10.1007/s40204-017-0071-0\n10.1108/02602280110388315\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/NHC.12.42\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.05.048\n10.1016/j.matpr.2021.02.715\n10.3390/ma13102402\n10.1002/pssa.201228136\n10.3390/ma14061428\n10.1016/j.rinp.2015.04.005\n10.1088/2053-1591/ab5f82\n10.3390/ma6083482\n10.3390/polym12122766\n10.1021/acsami.8b16621\n10.1007/s10853-018-03223-8\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.09.023\n10.1002/app.22303\n10.1016/j.ces.2008.02.020\n10.3144/expresspolymlett.2010.69\n10.1016/j.jece.2019.103330"}

{"title": "Programmable Transition between Adhesive/Anti-Adhesive Performances on Porous PVDF Spheres Supported by Shape Memory PLLA.", "abstract": "Superhydrophobic surfaces with switchable adhesive/anti-adhesive performances are highly desired but still challenging. Herein, by loading porous poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) spheres on a shape memory polylactic acid (PLLA) film, a quasi-superhydrophobic surface of composite film (PVDF@PLLA) with the ability to tailor its surface structures/composition and related adhesive behaviors was fabricated. The as-prepared surface is covered by porous PVDF spheres. The combination of hydrophobicity of PVDF and hierarchical roughness resulted from porous spheres contributing to the high contact angle and low sliding angle, corresponding to Cassie state and lotus leaves effect. Upon uniaxial or biaxial tension, the distance among hydrophobic spheres is so high that more and more hydrophilic defects (PLLA film) have been exposed to water droplets, accounting for the quasi-superhydrophobic surface with a higher sliding angle. This is the reason for the Wenzel state and rose petals effect. After heating, PLLA film recovers to its original state.

{"title": "Improved Performance of Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium-Metal Batteries via Hot Press Rolling.", "abstract": "Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are gaining attention as they promise to provide better safety and a higher energy density than conventional liquid electrolyte batteries. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising candidates due to their flexibility providing better interfacial contact between electrodes and the electrolyte. However, SPEs exhibit very low ionic conductivity at ambient temperatures, which prevents their practical use in batteries. Herein, a simple and effective technique of hot press rolling is demonstrated to improve ionic conductivity and, hence, the performance of polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP)-based solid polymer electrolyte. Applying hot press rolling to the electrolyte membrane induced structural changes in the grain boundaries, which resulted in a reduction in the crystallinity of the material and, hence, an increase in the amorphous phase of the material, which eased the movement of the lithium ions within the material. This technique also improved the surface of the membrane, making it homogeneous and smoother, which resulted in better interfacial contact between the electrodes and electrolyte. Electrochemical tests were carried out on electrolyte membranes treated with and without hot press rolling to evaluate the effect of the treatment. The hot pressed electrolyte membrane showed significant improvements in its ionic conductivity and transference number. The cycling performance of the LFP/Li batteries using a hot press rolled electrolyte was also evaluated, which gave a specific discharge capacity of 134 mAh/g at 0.1 C. These results demonstrate that hot press rolling can have a significant effect on the electrochemical performance of solid polymer electrolytes.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-02-16", "authors": ["PoonamYadav", "Seyed HamidrezaBeheshti", "Anish RajKathribail", "PavloIvanchenko", "Joeri VanMierlo", "MaitaneBerecibar"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14030363\n10.1016/j.mtnano.2018.12.003\n10.1039/c3cs60177c\n10.1038/s41467-020-17976-x\n10.1021/acsenergylett.1c00445\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227175\n10.1002/advs.201903088\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.076\n10.1016/j.ensm.2016.07.003\n10.1016/j.cclet.2021.03.032\n10.3390/polym10111237\n10.1063/1.3123001\n10.1038/s41598-018-22442-2\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2017.12.004\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.068\n10.1149/2.0161514jes\n10.1063/1.4936195\n10.1002/pcr2.10009\n10.1002/9781118541838.ch5\n10.1016/j.jtice.2020.11.012\n10.1038/s43246-021-00187-2\n10.1038/35104644\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.038\n10.1149/1.2054852\n10.3390/polym13152468\n10.1016/j.est.2019.100767\n10.3390/polym12091889\n10.1186/s11671-020-03355-4\n10.1016/j.ssi.2020.115497\n10.1039/C7SE00441A\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.501.29\n10.1016/j.susmat.2019.e00104\n10.1039/D0RA07966A"}
{"title": "Coherent Integration of Organic Gel Polymer Electrolyte and Ambipolar Polyoxometalate Hybrid Nanocomposite Electrode in a Compact High-Performance Supercapacitor.", "abstract": "We report a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) supercapacitor concept with improved pathways for ion transport, thanks to a facile creation of a coherent continuous distribution of the electrolyte throughout the electrode. Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) was chosen as the polymer framework for organic electrolytes. A permeating distribution of the GPE into the electrodes, acting both as integrated electrolyte and binder, as well as thin separator, promotes ion diffusion and increases the active electrode-electrolyte interface, which leads to improvements both in capacitance and rate capability. An activation process induced during the first charge-discharge cycles was detected, after which, the charge transfer resistance and Warburg impedance decrease. We found that a GPE thickness of 12 \u03bcm led to optimal capacitance and rate capability. A novel hybrid nanocomposite material, formed by the tetraethylammonium salt of the 1 nm-sized phosphomolybdate cluster and activated carbon (AC/TEAPMo12), was shown to improve its capacitive performance with this gel electrolyte arrangement. Due to the homogeneous dispersion of PMo12 clusters, its energy storage process is non-diffusion-controlled. In the symmetric capacitors, the hybrid nanocomposite material can perform redox reactions in both the positive and the negative electrodes in an ambipolar mode. The volumetric capacitance of a symmetric supercapacitor made with the hybrid electrodes increased by 40% compared to a cell with parent AC electrodes. Due to the synergy between permeating GPE and the hybrid electrodes, the GPE hybrid symmetric capacitor delivers three times more energy density at higher power densities and equivalent cycle stability compared with conventional AC symmetric capacitors.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-02-16", "authors": ["Jun-JieZhu", "LuisMartinez-Soria", "PedroGomez-Romero"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12030514\n10.1039/C7CS00505A\n10.1016/j.ensm.2020.09.018\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2020.122945\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118660\n10.1016/j.jechem.2020.01.019\n10.1039/D0TA06331B\n10.1016/j.electacta.2019.135425\n10.1002/aenm.201803665\n10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135698\n10.1039/D0EE03407J\n10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137007\n10.1039/C3TA14455K\n10.1002/tcr.201700116\n10.1002/cssc.201700792\n10.1039/C5TA05660H\n10.1039/D0NR01070G\n10.1039/C5EE03084F\n10.1039/D0TA08759A\n10.1149/1.1391833\n10.1149/2.1411713jes\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.193\n10.1016/j.electacta.2019.02.092\n10.1039/C5CS00303B\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227390\n10.1016/S0022-0728(03)00346-2\n10.1016/0013-4686(94)E0192-3\n10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.136\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227678\n10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00707-8\n10.1039/C4CP03321C\n10.1002/celc.201801081"}

Although the photoelectrochemical (PEC)-based POCT platform offers the benefits of cheap cost and good user engagement, its commercialization is still limited by the photodetection components' downsizing and mobility, among other factors. In this work, a novel highly integrated PEC biosensor aided by piezophototronics to enhance the efficiency of PEC testing was reported for flexible detection of cancer-associated antigens in biological fluids (prostate-specific antigen, PSA, used as an example). Multiple signal enhancement strategies, including a magnetic bead-linked enzyme-linked immune system catalyzing the production of ascorbic acid from the substrate and a piezoelectric-assisted enhancement strategy, were used for sensitive detection of the analyte to be tested in human body fluids. Unlike the electron transfer mechanism in heterojunctions, piezoelectric semiconductors promote the transfer of electrons and holes by generating piezoelectric potentials in the ultrasonic field, thus contributing to the performance of the PEC testbed. Under optimized conditions, the test platform achieves good correspondence for PSA at 0.02-40 ng mL", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2022-02-12", "authors": ["ZhichaoYu", "HexiangGong", "JianhuiXu", "YuxuanLi", "YongyiZeng", "XiaolongLiu", "DianpingTang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c00066"}
{"title": "Computational Optimizing the Electromagnetic Wave Reflectivity of Double-Layered Polymer Nanocomposites.", "abstract": "Double-layered absorption-dominated electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composites are highly desirable to prevent secondary electromagnetic wave pollution. However, it is a tremendous challenge to optimize the shielding performance via the trial-and-error method due to the low efficiency. Herein, a novel approach of computation-aided experimental design is proposed to efficiently optimize the reflectivity of the double-layered composites. A\u00a0normalized input impedance (NII) method is presented to calculate the electromagnetic wave reflectivity of multilayered EMI shielding composites. The calculated results are a good match with the experimental results. Then, the NII method is utilized to design polyvinylidene difluoride/MXene/carbon nanotube (PVDF/MXene/CNT) composites. According to the optimization of the NII method, the prepared PVDF/MXene/CNT composite has an ultralow reflectivity of 0.000057, which outperforms that reported in current work and satisfies the requirement of electromagnetic wave absorbing material. Additionally, its average EMI shielding effectiveness is 30\u00a0dB, demonstrating that PVDF/MXene/CNT composite simultaneously achieves shielding and absorption. The ultralow reflection mechanism can be ascribed to the ideal impedance match. Both the PVDF/MXene and the PVDF/CNT layers can attenuate electromagnetic energy, which subverts the traditional cognition of double-layered absorption-dominated EMI shielding composites. The NII method opens a way for the practical fabrication of double-layered absorption-dominated EMI shielding composites.", "journal": "Small methods", "date": "2022-02-12", "authors": ["LinfengWei", "JianzhongMa", "LiMa", "ChongxiangZhao", "MenglongXu", "QingQi", "WenboZhang", "LeiZhang", "XiangHe", "Chul BPark"], "doi": "10.1002/smtd.202101510"}

The system relies on 8 identical oscillating cantilevers that are equally spaced on the perimeter of a circular well, through which the liquid solutions are introduced. When an oscillatory electrical signal is applied to a piezoelectric transducer attached to the device, the cantilevers start resonating. Due to the close proximity between the cantilevers, their circular arrangement and the liquid medium in which they are immersed, the vibration of each cantilever affects the response of its neighbours.

{"title": "Dual-Resonance (16/32 MHz) Piezoelectric Transducer With a Single Electrical Connection for Forward-Viewing Robotic Guidewire.", "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 200 million people globally. Minimally invasive endovascular procedures can provide relief and salvage limbs while reducing injury rates and recovery times. Unfortunately, when a calcified chronic total occlusion is encountered, ~25% of endovascular procedures fail due to the inability to advance a guidewire using the view provided by fluoroscopy. To enable a sub-millimeter, robotically steerable guidewire to cross these occlusions, a novel single-element, dual-band transducer is developed that provides simultaneous multifrequency, forward-viewing imaging with high penetration depth and high spatial resolution while requiring only a single electrical connection. The design, fabrication, and acoustic characterization of this device are described, and proof-of-concept imaging is demonstrated in an ex vivo porcine artery after integration with a robotically steered guidewire. Measured center frequencies of the developed transducer were 16 and 32 MHz, with -6 dB fractional bandwidths of 73% and 23%, respectively. When imaging a 0.2-mm wire target at a depth of 5 mm, measured -6 dB target widths were 0.498 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.268 \u00b1 0.01 mm for images formed at 16 and 32 MHz, respectively. Measured SNR values were 33.3 and 21.3 dB, respectively. The 3-D images of the ex vivo artery demonstrate high penetration for visualizing vessel morphology at 16 MHz and ability to resolve small features close to the transducer at 32 MHz. Using images acquired simultaneously at both frequencies as part of an integrated forward-viewing, guidewire-based imaging system, an interventionalist could visualize the best path for advancing the guidewire to improve outcomes for patients with PAD.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-02-11", "authors": ["Graham CCollins", "Timothy ABrumfiel", "Zachary LBercu", "Jaydev PDesai", "Brooks DLindsey"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3150746\n10.1016/j.jvs.2014.03.290\n10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30255-4\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.179\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.08.002\n10.1177/152660280701400216\n10.1109/TMI.2018.2869942\n10.1109/TBME.2017.2784437\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006679\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318261\n10.1038/s41569-018-0005-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022546\n10.1055/s-0034-1393976\n10.1109/LRA.2020.3004782\n10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.006789\n10.4068/cmj.2021.57.2.164\n10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-017296\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2014.12.005\n10.1177/1358863\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.08.709\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31922-5\n10.1016/j.jcin.2012.09.017\n10.1109/TBME.2020.3013267\n10.1118/1.4906194\n10.1007/s11370-020-00311-0\n10.1109/LRA.2021.3057295\n10.1109/TBME.2019.2948391\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2276739\n10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989796\n10.1109/ICRA.2018.8462694\n10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2620381\n10.1109/ULT-SYM.2013.0508\n10.1088/0031-9155/61/24/8476\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2017.09.015\n10.1098/rsos.180138\n10.1088/0031-9155/60/9/3441\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2506639\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2872911\n10.1109/TBME.2019.2901005\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2995305\n10.3390/s141120825\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2702010\n10.3390/s21103540\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.10.011\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2020.03.032\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2878785\n10.1063/1.5040787\n10.1109/TBME.2020.2986284\n10.1063/1.5097624\n10.3390/s18072290\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3001221\n10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3062071\n10.1016/j.optlaseng.2012.05.022\n10.1016/j.optlaseng.2014.11.018\n10.1109/ULTSYM.1999.849214\n10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3059942\n10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106404\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2898256\n10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2592525\n10.1038/s41378-020-0181-z\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1993\n10.1109/JSSC.2018.2828826\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2859824\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2128\n10.1109/ULTSYM.1990.171581\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.07.035\n10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1251138\n10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1311\n10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106200\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.04.022\n10.1109/TMI.2017.2723479\n10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106364\n10.1016/j.pacs.2021.100309\n10.1117/1.JMI.5.2.021224\n10.1007/978-3-030-01045-4_10\n10.1109/TMI.2016.2524992\n10.1117/1.JMI.3.2.027001\n10.1109/58.148539\n10.1109/58.148540"}

{"title": "Tethering Piezo channels to the actin cytoskeleton for mechanogating via the cadherin-\u03b2-catenin mechanotransduction complex.", "abstract": "The mechanically activated Piezo channel plays a versatile role in conferring mechanosensitivity to various cell types. However, how it incorporates its intrinsic mechanosensitivity and cellular components to effectively sense long-range mechanical perturbation across a cell remains elusive. Here we show that Piezo channels are biochemically and functionally tethered to the actin cytoskeleton via the cadherin-\u03b2-catenin mechanotransduction complex, whose perturbation significantly impairs Piezo-mediated responses. Mechanistically, the adhesive extracellular domain of E-cadherin interacts with the cap domain of Piezo1, which controls the transmembrane gate, while its cytosolic tail might interact with the cytosolic domains of Piezo1, which are in close proximity to its intracellular gates, allowing a direct focus of adhesion-cytoskeleton-transmitted force for gating. Specific disruption of the intermolecular interactions prevents cytoskeleton-dependent gating of Piezo1. Thus, we propose a force-from-filament model to complement the previously suggested force-from-lipids model for mechanogating of Piezo channels, enabling them to serve as versatile and tunable mechanotransducers.", "journal": "Cell reports", "date": "2022-02-10", "authors": ["JingWang", "JinghuiJiang", "XuzhongYang", "GeweiZhou", "LiWang", "BailongXiao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110342"}
{"title": "Boosting sluggish photocatalytic hydrogen evolution through piezo-stimulated polarization: a critical review.", "abstract": "To address the growing energy demand, remarkable progress has been made in transferring the fossil fuel-based economy to hydrogen-based environmentally friendly photocatalytic technology. However, the sluggish production rate due to the quick charge recombination and slow diffusion process needs careful engineering to achieve the benchmark photocatalytic efficiency. Piezoelectric photocatalysis has emerged as a promising field in recent years due to its improved catalytic performance facilitated by a built-in electric field that promotes the effective separation of excitons when subjected to mechanical stimuli. This review discusses the recent progress in piezo-photocatalytic hydrogen evolution while elaborating on the mechanistic pathway, effect of piezo-polarization and various strategies adopted to improve piezo-photocatalytic activity. Moreover, our review systematically emphasizes the fundamentals of piezoelectricity and piezo-phototronics along with the operational mechanism for designing efficient piezoelectric photocatalysts.

{"title": "Electrospun Liquid-Infused Membranes for Emulsified Oil/Water Separation.", "abstract": "From an environmental perspective, microfiltration membranes are attractive for the separation of emulsified oils from contaminated water. However, fouling of the membrane is a major drawback of the technology. \"Liquid-infused membranes\" (LIMs) have the potential to eliminate membrane fouling. Here, we demonstrate the practical application of LIMs for the separation of oil from a stable oil-in-water emulsion and characterize their resistance to fouling. The base membrane is an electrospun nonwoven fibrous layer of the fluorinated copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-co-HFP). The surface energy of the PVDF-co-HFP fibers was lowered by the covalent attachment of a fluorinated silane (PFOCTS), and then, the membrane was infused with a perfluoropolyether. The membrane was then challenged with model emulsions of dodecane in water in a cross-flow configuration. This PFOCTS-modified LIM showed better infused liquid stability, permeation selectivity, higher permeate flux than the unmodified LIM, and better anti-fouling properties than the bare membrane without infused liquid. We also examine the mechanism for transport of the dispersed oil phase through the liquid-infused membrane. We find a linear relationship between the dodecane flux and dodecane concentration in the feed and a higher dodecane flux through the PFOCTS-modified membrane than the unmodified one, which suggests that the capture of dodecane droplets from the feed plays an important role in determining the overall rate of permeation. Other factors such as lower viscosity of the infused liquid, larger pore size, and higher operating pressure also improved the permeate flux through the LIMs. Overall, this work provides some guidelines on the design of composite membranes comprising infused liquids and the choice of operating conditions for the filtration process.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2022-02-08", "authors": ["ChenSong", "Gregory CRutledge"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c03016"}

Integration of these two effects to fabricate a hybrid nanogenerator can further enhance the output efficiency of the nanogenerator. Here, we have discussed the importance of 2D materials which plays an important role in the fabrication of nanogenerators because of their distinct characteristics, such as, flexibility, mechanical stability, nontoxicity, and biodegradability. This review mainly emphasizes the piezoelectric, triboelectric, and hybrid nanogenerator based on the 2D materials and their van der Waals heterostructure, as well as the effect of polymer-2D composite on the output performance of the nanogenerator.", "journal": "iScience", "date": "2022-02-05", "authors": ["ShilpaRana", "VishalSingh", "BhartiSingh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isci.2022.103748\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.081\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.046\n10.1002/ente.201600419\n10.1007/s40544-018-0217-7"}
{"title": "Highly Efficient One-Step Protein Immobilization on Polymer Membranes Supported by Response Surface Methodology.", "abstract": "Immobilization of proteins by covalent coupling to polymeric materials offers numerous excellent advantages for various applications, however, it is usually limited by coupling strategies, which are often too expensive or complex. In this study, an electron-beam-based process for covalent coupling of the model protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) flat sheet membranes was investigated. Immobilization can be performed in a clean, fast, and continuous mode of operation without any additional chemicals involved. Using the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach, nine process factors were investigated for their influence on graft yield and homogeneity. The parameters could be reduced to only four highly significant factors: BSA concentration, impregnation method, impregnation time, and electron beam irradiation dose. Subsequently, optimization of the process was performed using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). A one-step method was developed, resulting in a high BSA grafting yield of 955\u00a0mg\u00a0m", "journal": "Frontiers in chemistry", "date": "2022-02-05", "authors": ["MartinSchmidt", "AmiraAbdul Latif", "AndreaPrager", "RogerGl\u00e4ser", "AgnesSchulze"], "doi": "10.3389/fchem.2021.804698\n10.17576/jsm-2018-4706-28\n10.3144/expresspolymlett.2015.2\n10.1021/ac9608376\n10.1002/0471238961.0405190908010814.a01.pub3\n10.1109/tnb.2015.2511622\n10.1016/j.jlumin.2008.12.010\n10.1016/s0021-9258(18)63402-7\n10.1111/j.2517-6161.1951.tb00067.x\n10.3390/polym7101497\n10.1039/c6ra13787c\n10.1080/15422119.2014.918884\n10.1063/1.555805\n10.3390/membranes9120163\n10.1016/j.jiec.2013.07.046\n10.1016/s0079-6700(03)00047-9\n10.1002/jmr.2609\n10.1080/00224065.1980.11980968\n10.1007/s00253-015-6390-y\n10.1007/s12221-010-0960-5\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.12.008\n10.1016/j.seppur.2013.03.017\n10.1016/s0079-6700(00)00008-3\n10.1007/s10965-019-1832-3\n10.1006/eesa.1997.1526\n10.1351/pac200476040889\n10.3390/molecules190811860\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.055\n10.1016/0142-9612(93)90045-4\n10.1016/s0079-6700(02)00032-1\n10.1080/10934529.2012.689183\n10.1002/(sici)1097-4628(19990620)72:12<1565:Aid-app9>3.0.Co;2-n\n10.1039/c4ra03652b\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014\n10.1163/156856209x412227\n10.1016/0969-806x(94)e0002-z\n10.1016/j.radphyschem.2017.01.047\n10.1016/j.molimm.2012.05.011\n10.1016/j.radphyschem.2016.12.003\n10.1007/s42452-020-03515-2\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2020.122911\n10.1039/c8pp00254a\n10.1016/j.radphyschem.2013.05.049\n10.1016/j.radphyschem.2011.06.014\n10.1002/app.37558\n10.1016/j.radphyschem.2011.12.019\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2004.01.003\n10.1002/app.1969.070130815\n10.1039/c0ee00541j\n10.1002/9783527819249.ch7\n10.3390/jfb9010021\n10.1080/03602559.2012.702254\n10.1063/1.1699113\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.06.013\n10.3390/polym13111849\n10.3390/polym9030097\n10.1039/c3ra43659d\n10.1002/marc.200900666\n10.2166/wst.2012.890\n10.1016/0003-2697(85)90442-7\n10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2013.02.013\n10.1016/s0958-2118(17)30191-x\n10.1016/j.tox.2018.04.006\n10.1002/9783527819249.ch13\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.01.084\n10.1016/s0142-9612(98)00029-5\n10.1016/j.desal.2020.114442\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.004\n10.1002/app.36630\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.04.242\n10.1039/c4ra08203f\n10.1002/app.25786\n10.1021/bp990120e\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.08.007\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.03.027\n10.1021/jp004051u"}

{"title": "Optical ultrasound sensors for photoacoustic imaging: a narrative review.", "abstract": "Optical ultrasound sensors have been increasingly employed in biomedical diagnosis and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) due to high sensitivity and resolution. PAI could visualize the distribution of ultrasound excited by laser pulses in biological tissues. The information of tissues is detected by ultrasound sensors in order to reconstruct structural images. However, traditional ultrasound transducers are made of piezoelectric films that lose sensitivity quadratically with the size reduction. In addition, the influence of electromagnetic interference limits further applications of traditional ultrasound transducers. Therefore, optical ultrasound sensors are developed to overcome these shortcomings. In this review, optical ultrasound sensors are classified into resonant and non-resonant ones in view of physical principles. The principles and basic parameters of sensors are introduced in detail. Moreover, the state of the art of optical ultrasound sensors and applications in PAI are also presented. Furthermore, the merits and drawbacks of sensors based on resonance and non-resonance are discussed in perspectives.

Currently, the methods to fabricate curved PSCCs are mostly derived from PCCs, including molding with flexible backing, molding with heating, and molding with the casting rubber method. Unfortunately, the methods mentioned above are not suitable for preparing curved PSCCs for underwater acoustic transducer applications because of their brittleness, the large anisotropy of piezoelectric single crystals, and the high thickness (>2 mm) of PSCCs for achieving the low operating frequency (<700 kHz). In the present work, we proposed a preparation method, 3D-printing-assisted dice and insert technology, and successfully prepared curved PSCCs with high performance.

It consists of the pedestal, the piezoelectric beam, the connection mass, the tip magnetic mass, the revolving host, the support frame, and the bolts. This device drives the intermittent magnetic vibration between the magnet and the tip magnetic mass to generate electric energy, avoids mechanical collision and wear, and extends the service life of the device. The working principle and vibration model of the proposed energy harvester are studied theoretically. The displacement state of the piezoelectric beam under a magnetic force is simulated and analyzed. In addition, a series of experiments verify the simulation results. With two driving magnets, 5\u00a0g tip magnetic mass, and 10\u00a0mm radial excitation distances, a piezoelectric energy harvester can capture energy efficiently. The results demonstrate that the piezoelectric energy harvester produces four resonance frequencies of 4, 11, 15, and 19\u00a0Hz.

To solve this problem, a novel two-stage amplification mechanism (TSAM) was designed, and correspondingly, a stick-slip piezoelectric actuator was developed. The structure, two-stage amplification principle, and motion processes of the designed actuator were addressed in detail, followed by analyzing the displacement amplification ratio and stress of TSAM via the elastic beam method and finite element method, respectively. Then, the actuator prototype was fabricated, and its output performances were tested under various experimental parameters. By comparative analysis with the actuator that only used the first-stage amplification hinge, the significant improvement in stepping displacement was verified when employing the TSAM. The resultant maximum motion speed was 20.05 mm/s, achieved under the locking force of 2 N, the input voltage of 100\u00a0V, and the driving frequency of 700\u00a0Hz.

The natural frequency and modal of this stage are analyzed with the finite element method. In order to reduce the hysteresis influence of the PZT actuator, the model parameters based on the Bouc-Wen hysteresis model are identified by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the boundedness of the hysteresis phenomenon is determined by this model.

Taking errors and the derivation in the errors as input and the parameters of the PID sliding surface as the output, the fuzzy sliding mode function is constructed.

{"title": "A Nonlinear Pulse Shaping Method Using Resonant Piezoelectric MEMS Devices.", "abstract": "In this article, a methodology for increasing the displacement of the membrane in nonlinear transducers is presented. This methodology that relies on pulse shaping is based on the frequency modulation of the excitation signal which in turn results in an amplitude modulation of the displacement of the resonator. The benefits of pulse shaping include the increase of the displacement of the membrane of the resonator, the ability to leverage two mechanisms to dynamically tune the resonant frequency of the device and a relative control of the decay time of the resonator. These properties have been verified using simulations and experimental results. The experimental results are performed using two nonlinear resonators with a frequency of 3.9 and 7.9 kHz. With a constant amplitude of the excitation voltage, experimental results show that the use of pulse shaping allows a velocity increase of the membrane of a piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonator of up to 191% for a softening type resonator (STR), and 348% for a hardening type resonator (HTR). The frequency tuning mechanism allowed the operation of the STR and of the HTR over a bandwidth of 280 and 115 Hz, respectively, while providing higher velocity than with the non-optimized excitation signal. The resulting pulse shaping methodology can be applied to other nonlinear resonators as shown using simulation and experimental results.

{"title": "Complications in sinus lifting procedures: Classification and management.", "abstract": "Open and closed sinus lifting procedures are predictable methods to augment the bone needed for appropriate implant placement in the posterior maxilla in cases where available bone is limited. However, these techniques may give rise to complications and associated comorbidities. In the case of open sinus lifting, perforation of the Schneiderian membrane during osteotomy is the most common complication, with an incidence rate of around 20%-25%. Apart from those complications associated with oral surgery in general (such as swelling or hematoma), there are specific complications of open sinus lifting procedures that may arise less frequently (chronic rhinosinusitis, hemorrhage, or ostium blockage by overfilling) but which may nevertheless compromise the viability of the graft and/or the implants and cause substantial discomfort to the patient. Closed sinus lifting is a less invasive approach that allows transcrestal placement of the implants in cases where there is sufficient residual bone height. However, it may also be associated with specific complications, including membrane perforation, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and implant displacement to the sinus cavity. New technologies have been proposed to reduce these complications and comorbidities associated with conventional sinus lifting procedures, such as the use of piezoelectric devices and hydraulic sinus lift or reamer burs. The evidence supporting their effectiveness and safety, however, is still lacking. A detailed medical history together with a thorough radiographic and clinical examination are essential prior to any kind of bone regenerative augmentation involving the maxillary sinus.

While structurally similar, PIEZO channels are expressed in distinct tissues and exhibit unique properties. How different PIEZOs transduce force, how their transduction mechanism varies, and how their unique properties match the functional needs of the tissues they are expressed in remain all-important unanswered questions. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a single PIEZO ortholog (pezo-1) predicted to have 12 isoforms. These isoforms share many transmembrane domains but differ in those that distinguish PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 in mammals. We used transcriptional and translational reporters to show that putative promoter sequences immediately upstream of the start codon of long pezo-1 isoforms predominantly drive green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in mesodermally derived tissues (such as muscle and glands). In contrast, sequences upstream of shorter pezo-1 isoforms resulted in GFP expression primarily in neurons. Putative promoters upstream of different isoforms drove GFP expression in different cells of the same organs of the digestive system. The observed unique pattern of complementary expression suggests that different isoforms could possess distinct functions within these organs. We used mutant analysis to show that pharyngeal muscles and glands require long pezo-1 isoforms to respond appropriately to the presence of food.

In this paper, the impact force generated by the impact wheel and the output voltage of the piezoelectric cantilever beam during the rotation process are given. Finally, the experimental test shows that the larger the radius of the drive wheel, the lower the impact force of the wheel and the lower the output voltage of the piezoelectric cantilever beam; the larger the diameter of the shape memory alloy wire, the higher the impact force of the wheel and the higher the output voltage of the piezoelectric cantilever beam; the more teeth of the drive wheel, the higher the impact frequency of the piezoelectric cantilever beam and the higher the output voltage.

However, conventionally, heart and respiration rates are monitored using different sensors, which is cumbersome and can further increase the psychological burden on patients. To address these issues, this report proposes a sensor consisting of two stacked elements that can simultaneously measure heart and respiration rates. The two signals received can be expressed separately as heart and respiration rates after signal processing. The two stacked elements are composed of polyvinylidene fluoride thin film bonded to a polydimethylsiloxane substrate. One element (element 1) measures movement related to the heart, and the other (element 2) measures movement related to breathing. Elements 1 and 2 were experimentally observed to have sensitivities of 0.163\u00a0V/N and 0.209\u00a0V/N, respectively. In addition, the proposed system was compared with a commercial digital heart rate and respiration rate measurement instrument and was verified to be effective for simultaneous measurement of human vital signals with multiple sensors.

Although various stem cell types have shown some clinical efficacy for injury repair they have not for SCI. Hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells have been shown to differentiate into neurons, Schwan cells, beating cardiomyocytes and many other type of cells, and have effectively regenerated acute spinal cord injury in mouse models. In the present report, HAP stem cells from C57BL/6J mice, encapsulated in polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PFM), were implanted into the severed thoracic spinal cord of C57BL/6J or athymic nude mice in the early chronic phase. After implantation, HAP stem cells differentiated to neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the regenerated thoracic spinal cord of C57BL/6J and nude mice. Quantitative motor function analysis, with the Basso Mouse Scale for Locomotion (BMS) score, demonstrated a significant functional improvement in the HAP-stem-cell-implanted mice, compared to non-implanted mice. HAP stem cells have critical advantages over other stem cells: they do not develop teratomas; do not loose differentiation ability when cryopreserved and thus are bankable; are autologous, readily obtained from anyone; and do not require genetic manipulation. HAP stem cells therefore have greater clinical potential for SCI repair than induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neuronal stem cells (NSCs)/neural progenitor cells (NPCs) or embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

{"title": "Tactile Sensing for Minimally Invasive Surgery: Conventional Methods and Potential Emerging Tactile Technologies.", "abstract": "As opposed to open surgery procedures, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) utilizes small skin incisions to insert a camera and surgical instruments. MIS has numerous advantages such as reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery time, and reduced learning curve for surgical trainees. MIS comprises surgical approaches, including laparoscopic surgery, endoscopic surgery, and robotic-assisted surgery. Despite the advantages that MIS provides to patients and surgeons, it remains limited by the lost sense of touch due to the indirect contact with tissues under operation, especially in robotic-assisted surgery. Surgeons, without haptic feedback, could unintentionally apply excessive forces that may cause tissue damage. Therefore, incorporating tactile sensation into MIS tools has become an interesting research topic. Designing, fabricating, and integrating force sensors onto different locations on the surgical tools are currently under development by several companies and research groups. In this context, electrical force sensing modality, including piezoelectric, resistive, and capacitive sensors, is the most conventionally considered approach to measure the grasping force, manipulation force, torque, and tissue compliance. For instance, piezoelectric sensors exhibit high sensitivity and accuracy, but the drawbacks of thermal sensitivity and the inability to detect static loads constrain their adoption in MIS tools. Optical-based tactile sensing is another conventional approach that facilitates electrically passive force sensing compatible with magnetic resonance imaging. Estimations of applied loadings are calculated from the induced changes in the intensity, wavelength, or phase of light transmitted through optical fibers. Nonetheless, new emerging technologies are also evoking a high potential of contributions to the field of smart surgical tools. The recent development of flexible, highly sensitive tactile microfluidic-based sensors has become an emerging field in tactile sensing, which contributed to wearable electronics and smart-skin applications. Another emerging technology is imaging-based tactile sensing that achieved superior multi-axial force measurements by implementing image sensors with high pixel densities and frame rates to track visual changes on a sensing surface. This article aims to review the literature on MIS tactile sensing technologies in terms of working principles, design requirements, and specifications. Moreover, this work highlights and discusses the promising potential of a few emerging technologies towards establishing low-cost, high-performance MIS force sensing.", "journal": "Frontiers in

{"title": "Functional Expression of Transient Receptor Potential and Piezo1 Channels in Cultured Interstitial Cells of Human-Bladder Lamina Propria.", "abstract": "The interstitial cells in bladder lamina propria (LP-ICs) are believed to be involved in sensing/afferent signaling in bladder mucosa. Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels act as mechano- or chemo-sensors and may underlie some of the sensing function of bladder LP-ICs. We aimed to investigate the molecular and functional expression of TRP channels implicated in bladder sensory function and Piezo1/Piezo2 channels in cultured LP-ICs of the human bladder. Bladder tissues were obtained from patients undergoing cystectomy. LP-ICs were isolated and cultured, and used for real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and calcium-imaging experiments. At the mRNA level, TRPA1, TRPV2, and Piezo1 were expressed most abundantly. Immunocytochemical staining showed protein expression of TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPM8, as well as Piezo1 and Piezo2. Calcium imaging using channel agonists/antagonists provided evidence for functional expression of TRPA1, TRPV2, TRPV4, Piezo1, but not of TRPV1 or TRPM8.

{"title": "Highly branched amylopectin binder for sulfur cathodes with enhanced performance and longevity.", "abstract": "The sulfur cathode of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries suffers from inherent problems of insufficient mechanical strength and the dissolution of sulfur and polysulfides. Inspired by the extraordinarily resilient and strong binding force of the Great Wall binder, that is, the sticky rice mortar, we extracted highly branched amylopectin (HBA), the effective ingredient, as a low-cost, nontoxic and environmentally benign aqueous binder for the sulfur cathode. The HBA-based cells outperform the Li-S batteries based on the traditional polyvinyldene diflouride (PVDF) binder and a lowly branched polysaccharide binder. The improved electrochemical performance in the HBA-based cell could be attributed to two mechanisms. First, the branched structure of the HBA provides enhanced mechanical and adhesive properties, which allow for a robust electronic and ionic conductive framework to be maintained throughout the cathode after extended cycling. Second, the HBA shows enhanced polysulfide retention due to the polymer's abundant lone-pair rich hydroxyl groups and the formation of C\u2500S bonds between the HBA and polysulfides prohibits the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The improved mechanical properties and polysulfide retention function of the HBA binder facilitate the HBA-based Li-S battery to deliver a long cycle life of 500\u00a0cycles at 2 C while only displaying a capacity fading of 0.104% per cycle.", "journal": "Exploration (Beijing, China)", "date": "2022-01-24", "authors": ["LukeHencz", "HaoChen", "ZhenzhenWu", "ShangshuQian", "SuChen", "XingxingGu", "XianhuLiu", "ChengYan", "ShanqingZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/EXP.20210131\n10.1002/eem2.12257"}

{"title": "Engineering Aspects of Incidence, Prevalence, and Management of Osteoarthritis: A Review.", "abstract": "The knee is the biggest and complicated lower extremity joint that supports mobility and the entire weight of the human body and lies between the hip joint and ankle joint. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease in the knee among various musculoskeletal disorders globally, with an age-associated increase in incidence and prevalence. Health monitoring of the knee joints in daily life, and early OA diagnosis is challenging and draws attention to the various methods of diagnosis for this irreversible disease. In this review, electronic databases have been searched from inception for a detailed study about knee OA and its management. It focuses on various sensor technologies and different semi-invasive and non-invasive diagnosis methods with their limitations. In the last decade, various researchers have engrossed their attention to the potential of piezoelectric-based acoustic sensors to fabricate a wearable device for OA and its management. A sensor-based wearable device using vibroarthrography as a tool can be an appropriate solution for early-stage disease detection. We firmly believe that wearable technology for the detection of OA in daily life activities will play a significant role in managing this disease and help to reduce the chances of total knee replacements.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2022-01-22", "authors": ["Dhirendra KumarVerma", "PoonamKumari", "SubramaniKanagaraj"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-022-02913-4\n10.3390/jfmk2040034\n10.1016/s0004-9514(09)70088-1\n10.1007/s40846-019-00484-9\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.012\n10.1097/BOR.0000000000000161\n10.1007/s10439-019-02430-x\n10.1615/CritRevPhysRehabilMed.2016017185\n10.1155/2015/591707\n10.1186/1471-2474-9-116\n10.1007/s11517-018-1785-4\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2277697\n10.1088/0957-0233/22/4/045801\n10.1056/NEJM190201161460304\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2503765\n10.2214/ajr.172.4.10587150\n10.1186/s12891-017-1624-z\n10.1136/ard.54.11.872\n10.1109/TNB.2002.806916\n10.1093/rheumatology/39.11.1218\n10.1038/ncprheum0216\n10.1016/j.compmedimag.2019.06.002\n10.3390/app10186266\n10.18494/SAM.2018.1877\n10.1002/art.27378\n10.1007/bf02442662\n10.1007/s10439-020-02558-1\n10.1007/s10439-019-02348-4\n10.1109/TIM.2008.925336\n10.1111/j.1365-2516.2010.02307.x\n10.1007/s10439-021-02838-4\n10.1007/s10439-019-02213-4\n10.1007/s10439-020-02559-0\n10.1016/S0021-9290(97)81146-3\n10.2214/ajr.170.3.9490936\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.06.025\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2007.12.003\n10.1002/art.1780400420\n10.1002/art.1780340402\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.02.006\n10.1002/acr.22415\n10.1186/1743-0003-2-7\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60802-3\n10.1016/j.rdc.2013.02.001\n10.1016/j.bspc.2014.04.008\n10.1093/rheumatology/kes328\n10.1155/2017/3409327\n10.1002/admi.201801376\n10.23743/acs-2019-03\n10.1136/ard.2008.102434\n10.1016/j.rdc.2009.09.002\n10.1136/ard.16.4.494\n10.1016/0141-5425(91)90041-5\n10.3109/17453679008993071\n10.1002/art.21951\n10.1007/s10439-020-02615-9\n10.1007/s00330-004-2312-6\n10.1007/s002560050169\n10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2005.12.010\n10.1080/01691864.2020.1837671\n10.1186/ar1491\n10.1007/s11465-011-0201-7\n10.4049/jimmunol.174.8.5016\n10.3109/17453678008990802\n10.1177/1941738113514369\n10.1109/10.477697\n10.1002/1529-0131(200110)45:5<453::AID-ART365>3.0.CO;2-W\n10.1302/0301-620X.69B2.3818762\n10.1007/s10439-020-02499-9\n10.3109/17483107.2013.805825\n10.1007/s10439-020-02666-y\n10.1016/0021-9290(83)90126-4\n10.1007/bf02442662\n10.1016/j.joca.2008.06.005\n10.1007/s10439-018-02184-y\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.01.090\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2370945\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4\n10.1136/ard.61.4.319\n10.1007/s10439-020-02539-4\n10.1007/s10439-020-02506-z\n10.1016/0749-8063(91)90101-3\n10.1155/2011/671308\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.10.056\n10.1097/RHU.0000000000000436\n10.1177/028418519503600104\n10.1002/adfm.201808369\n10.1136/ard.2009.112599\n10.1109/10.641334\n10.1007/s10439-008-9601-1\n10.1007/s00779-010-0303-y\n10.1155/2013/563268\n10.1007/BF02368303\n10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.v35.i5.20\n10.3390/s20154138\n10.1007/s10439-020-02641-7\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2010.12.009\n10.1007/s10439-019-02392-0\n10.1016/1350-4533(95)00013-D\n10.1007/s10439-017-1879-4\n10.1177/1941738109350438\n10.1016/S1063-4584(03)00080-3\n10.1109/JSEN.2012.2212883\n10.1007/s10439-020-02540-x\n10.3233/BMR-2012-0319\n10.1109/10.256430\n10.1063/1.4974623\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2543226\n10.1016/j.berh.2008.09.004\n10.1007/s10439-020-02646-2\n10.1007/s10439-020-02672-0\n10.3390/s151128435\n10.1109/JBHI.2016.2579610\n10.3390/s17102314\n10.1007/s10439-020-02516-x\n10.3390/s16122090\n10.1007/s10439-019-02333-x\n10.3390/e15041375\n10.1080/0952813X.2010.506288\n10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.v38.i2.60\n10.1088/0967-3334/35/3/429\n10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.v37.i1-2.10\n10.1109/10.284929"}

However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridizing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme-mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP-guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90\u2009% after 100\u2005min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted.

Therefore, we propose an infinite new lightweight broadband noise control structure and study its sound transmission loss (STL). The structure is an orthogonally rib-stiffened honeycomb double sandwich structure with periodic arrays of shunted piezoelectric patches, and demonstrates lighter mass and better strength than the existing sandwich structure. The structure is equivalent according to Hoff's equal stiffness theory and the effective medium (EM) method. Using the virtual work principle for a periodic element, two infinite sets of coupled equations are obtained. They are solved by truncating them in a finite range until the solution converges. The correctness and validity of the model are verified by using simulation results and theoretical predictions. Eventually, a further study is performed on the factors influencing the STL. All the results demonstrate that the STL in low-frequency can be improved by the structure, and the sound insulation bandwidth is significantly broadened by adding shunted piezoelectric patches.

{"title": "Influence of Etching Trench on Keff2&nbsp;of Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator.", "abstract": "As radio-frequency (RF) communication becomes more ubiquitous globally, film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR) have attracted great attention for their superior performance. One of the key parameters of an FBAR, the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient (Keff2), has a great influence on the bandwidth of RF filters. In this work, we propose a feasible method to tune the Keff2 of the FBAR by etching the piezoelectric material to form a trench around the active area of the FBAR. The influence of the position of the etching trench on the Keff2 of the FBAR was investigated by 3D finite element modeling and experimental fabricating. Meanwhile, a theoretical electrical model was presented to test and verify the simulated and measured results. The Keff2 of the FBAR tended to be reduced when the distance between the edge of the top electrode and the edge of the trench was increased, but the Q value of the FBAR was not degraded.

{"title": "Design and Optimization of the Dual-Mode Lamb Wave Resonator and Dual-Passband Filter.", "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF) filters with multiple passbands can meet the needs of miniaturization and integration for 5G communications. This paper reports a dual-mode Lamb wave resonator (DLWR) and a dual-passband filter based on DLWRs. The DLWR consists of a piezoelectric film and two interdigital electrode (IDT) arrays with different thicknesses, which leads to the coexistence of two main modes in the resonator. The resonance frequencies of the two modes can be adjusted separately by changing the thicknesses of the IDTs, which greatly satisfies the requirements of the dual-passband filter. Four DLWRs with different electrode configurations are designed, and the influences of the periodic length and thicknesses of the IDTs on the performance of the DLWR are studied. When the thickness of the piezoelectric layer is 0.75 \u03bcm and the two thicknesses of the IDTs are 0.1 \u03bcm and 0.3 \u03bcm, the resonance frequency of the second main mode is 1.27 GHz higher than the resonance frequency of the first main mode in the DLWR. Furthermore, a dual-passband filter based on the proposed DLWRs is demonstrated with an insertion loss less than 1 dB and a band rejection of about 15 dB. Moreover, two passbands at 2.45 GHz and 3.88 GHz with bandwidths of 66 MHz and 112 MHz, respectively, are achieved. The presented DLWR shows a potential application that can be used to obtain RF filters with adjustable dual passbands.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-01-22", "authors": ["TianchengLuo", "YanLiu", "YangZou", "JieZhou", "WenjuanLiu", "GuoqiangWu", "YaoCai", "ChengliangSun"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13010087\n10.3390/mi11070630\n10.1109/MMM.2017.2690883\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2867813\n10.1109/JMEMS.2020.3036379\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.06.023\n10.1364/OE.20.019185\n10.1109/TMTT.2004.825680\n10.1063/1.3427434\n10.1063/5.0028702\n10.1063/1.1900312\n10.1063/5.0042576\n10.1063/1.2996319\n10.1063/1.3697596\n10.1063/1.4757408\n10.1063/1.4979914\n10.1109/LED.2017.2769619\n10.1063/1.3643153\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2923579\n10.1063/1.5061740\n10.1109/LED.2019.2910836\n10.1016/j.tsf.2011.01.391\n10.1002/aelm.201800776\n10.1109/JMEMS.2019.2892708"}
{"title": "Comprehensive Schottky Barrier Height Behavior and Reliability Instability with Ni/Au and Pt/Ti/Pt/Au on AlGaN/GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistors.", "abstract": "The reliability instability of inhomogeneous Schottky contact behaviors of Ni/Au and Pt/Ti/Pt/Au gate contacts on AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) was investigated via off-state stress and temperature. Under the off-state stress condition, Pt/Ti/Pt/Au HEMT showed abruptly reduced reverse leakage current, which improved the Schottky barrier height (SBH) from 0.46 to 0.69 eV by suppression of the interfacial donor state. As the temperature increased, the reverse leakage current of the Pt/Ti/Pt/Au AlGaN/GaN HEMT at 308 K showed more reduction under the same off-state stress condition while that of the Ni/Au AlGaN/GaN HEMT increased. However, with temperatures exceeding 308 K under the same off-state stress conditions, the reverse leakage current of the Pt/Ti/Pt/Au AlGaN/GaN HEMT increases, which can be intensified using the inverse piezoelectric effect. Based on this phenomenon, the present work reveals the necessity for analyzing the concurrent SBH and reliability instability due to the interfacial trap states of the MS contacts.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-01-22", "authors": ["SurajitChakraborty", "Tae-WooKim"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13010084\n10.1016/j.microrel.2009.07.003\n10.1049/el:20000352\n10.1109/LED.2010.2055826\n10.1143/JJAP.45.L224\n10.1143/JJAP.44.L21\n10.1063/1.371866\n10.1063/1.5116356\n10.5923/j.eee.20120206.09\n10.1109/RELPHY.2008.4558923\n10.1038/s41598-020-73977-2\n10.1109/LED.2008.2003073\n10.1109/IEDM.2006.346799\n10.1109/TDMR.2008.923743\n10.1063/1.3695056\n10.1155/2013/931980\n10.1063/1.4811756\n10.1109/IMFEDK.2015.7158537\n10.1109/16.760391\n10.1063/1.3457356\n10.1063/1.4941531\n10.1016/j.mee.2013.03.017\n10.1109/JPROC.2007.911060\n10.1109/TED.2016.2532806\n10.1109/TED.2021.3074896\n10.1007/s11664-998-0396-5\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2004.05.091\n10.1116/1.1589520\n10.1063/1.2817647\n10.1063/1.1762980\n10.1109/JEDS.2020.2974260\n10.1063/1.2159547\n10.1109/IEDM.2007.4418953\n10.1149/1.3629954\n10.1109/16.52433\n10.1088/0268-1242/24/3/035004\n10.1063/1.4939936\n10.1063/1.2219985\n10.1002/pssb.200983617\n10.1063/1.1593218\n10.1088/0268-1242/28/7/074019"}

Specifically, the sarcoplasmic reticulum muscle is able to transmit electrical impulses in skeletal muscle due to its cross-linked hierarchical tubular cell structure. Inspired by the cross-linked tubular cell structure, we designed and built chemical cross-links between the carbon nanotubes within the carbon nanotube yarn (CNT yarn) structure by an esterification reaction. Consequently, compared with the pristine CNT yarn, its electrical conductivity dramatically enhanced 348%, from 557 S/cm to 1950 S/cm. Furthermore, when applied with three voltages, the electro-thermal temperature of esterified CNT yarn reached 261 \u00b0C, much higher than that of pristine CNT yarn (175 \u00b0C). In addition, the esterified CNT yarn exhibits a linear and stable piezo-resistive response, with a 158% enhanced gauge factor (the ratio of electrical resistance changing to strain change ~1.9). The superconductivity, flexibility, and stable sensitivity of the esterified flexible CNT yarn demonstrate its great potential in the applications of intelligent devices, smart clothing, or other advanced composites.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-01-22", "authors": ["SidraSaleemi", "Mohamed AmineAouraghe", "XiaoxiaoWei", "WeiLiu", "LiLiu", "M IrfanSiyal", "JihyunBae", "FujunXu"], "doi": "10.3390/nano12020208\n10.1007/s12034-019-1924-z\n10.1016/j.nantod.2016.08.010\n10.1002/adma.201601186\n10.3390/nano11112912\n10.1039/C9TA01474H\n10.1002/adma.201902028\n10.1002/adma.201901958\n10.1016/j.msea.2007.04.043\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.09.258\n10.4155/bio-2021-0138\n10.1155/2015/945091\n10.1002/adfm.201303716\n10.1007/s12221-018-8140-0\n10.1088/0957-4484/21/4/045708\n10.1039/C9TC06056A\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.02.024\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.07.034\n10.1038/srep00083\n10.1007/s10765-021-02806-z\n10.1177/00219983211041764\n10.1002/adma.201902670\n10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130421\n10.1007/s10853-021-06146-z\n10.1177/0040517518807441\n10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.078\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2020.108009\n10.1016/j.carbon.2016.04.043\n10.1080/19475411.2014.896426\n10.3390/nano11113020\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.09.060\n10.1126/scirobotics.aah3690\n10.1016/j.carbon.2019.05.024\n10.1039/C6RA24522F\n10.21577/0103-5053.20160274\n10.1007/s10853-017-1632-2\n10.1021/ja2016872\n10.1002/smll.200400118\n10.1002/sia.3023\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.12.218\n10.1002/pc.20533\n10.1016/j.surfin.2018.11.001\n10.1007/s40820-017-0128-6\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b01050\n10.1039/C3GC41335G\n10.1016/j.carbon.2019.05.023\n10.1021/am4026104\n10.1002/smll.201000493\n10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.041\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.05.008\n10.1039/C9TA12494B\n10.1016/j.carbon.2019.09.022\n10.1177/1528083720957404\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.106471\n10.1021/acsami.8b04695\n10.1002/smll.201702926\n10.1002/aelm.201600425\n10.1063/1.4977982\n10.1002/app.43243"}

{"title": "MXenes for Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "Energy harvesting modules play an increasingly important role in the development of autonomous self-powered microelectronic devices. MXenes (i.e., 2D transition metal carbide/nitride) have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy applications due to their excellent electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and tunable properties. Herein, a perspective on using MXenes to harvest energy from various sources in the environment is presented. First, the characteristics of MXenes that facilitate energy capturing are systematically introduced and the preparation strategies of MXenes and their derived nanostructures tailored toward such applications are summarized.

{"title": "Strategy to Achieve Augmented Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation via Heteroband Structure Engineering and In Situ Interface Activation.", "abstract": "A simple strategy to achieve remarkable activity of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation is both a critical requirement prior to accelerating the deployment of hydrogen and an important pursuit for renewable solar energy utilization. Despite various ways to improve the PEC performance, laborious fabrication and a statically driven process for water oxidation are still the most challenging tasks. We, herein, demonstrated an extremely simple but extraordinary effective strategy to boost PEC water splitting in a three-dimensional (3D) network structure (Ni foam, i.e., NF)-supported ZnO nanowire (NW)/CdS nanoparticle (NP) (NF/ZnO/CdS) photoelectrode. On the one hand, the establishment and optimization of a heteroband junction between ZnO NWs and CdS NPs substantially reduce the solar energy loss and increase the photocarrier utilization rate at the interface of two phases. On the other hand, the solution flow rotation in the unique macroporous 3D network structure gives rise to obvious piezoelectric (PE) polarization of ZnO located on the skeleton of Ni foam, which can dynamically enforce directional charge transfer. This real-time self-built PE polarization, assisted by the heteroband junction, enables the NF/ZnO/CdS photoanode system to obtain an improved photocurrent density by 12.2-fold compared with pure ZnO (at 1.23 V vs RHE). This work sheds light on an ingenious design strategy for fabricating photoelectrodes that combines a simplified structure and an effectively enhanced water oxidation performance.", "journal": "Inorganic chemistry", "date": "2022-01-20", "authors": ["YanfangHe", "XinranDing", "YingYang", "YuanLiu", "MingmingChen", "YinYin", "DaweiCao", "XiaohongYan"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03774"}

Surface acoustic waves (SAW) (phonons) of 5-35\u00a0GHz frequency launched into the substrate cause the magnetizations of the nanomagnets to precess at the frequency of the wave, giving rise to confined spin-wave modes (magnons) within the nanomagnets. The spin waves, in turn, radiate electromagnetic waves (photons) into the surrounding space at the SAW frequency. Here, the phonons couple into magnons, which then couple into photons. This tripartite phonon-magnon-photon coupling is thus exploited to implement an extreme sub-wavelength electromagnetic antenna whose measured radiation efficiency and antenna gain exceed the approximate theoretical limits for traditional antennas of the same dimensions by more than two orders of magnitude at some frequencies.

{"title": "Ultrasonic Transducers Made From Freeze-Cast Porous Piezoceramics.", "abstract": "Porous and composite piezoelectric ceramics are of interest for underwater ultrasonic transducers due to their improved voltage sensitivity and acoustic matching with water, compared with their dense counterparts. Commonly, these materials are fabricated by dice-and-fill of sintered blocks of polycrystalline piezoceramic, which results in a high volume of waste. The freeze-casting technique offers a low waste and scalable alternative to the dice-and-fill method to produce porous piezoceramics with highly orientated, anisometric pores. In this article, we have fabricated underwater ultrasonic transducers from freeze-cast lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with a range of porosities. The porous PZT samples were characterized in terms of their piezoelectric and dielectric properties before being encapsulated for acoustic performance testing in water. Off resonance, the on- axis receive sensitivity of the manufactured devices was approximately [Formula: see text]; the transmit voltage response (TVR) was in the range of approximately [Formula: see text] at 60 kHz to [Formula: see text] at 180 kHz. The most porous transducer devices (0.51, 0.43, and 0.33 pore fraction) exhibited primarily a thickness mode resonance, whereas the least porous transducers (0.29 pore fraction and dense benchmark) exhibited an undesired radial mode, which was observed as an additional resonant peak in the electrical impedance measurements and lateral off-axis lobes in the acoustic beampatterns. Our results show that the acoustic sensitivities and TVRs of the porous freeze-cast transducers are comparable to those of a dense pressed transducer. However, the freeze-cast transducers with porosity exceeding 0.30 pore fraction were shown to achieve an effective structure with aligned porosity that suppressed undesired radial mode resonances.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2022-01-19", "authors": ["ZuhayrRymansaib", "PolatKurt", "YanZhang", "James IRoscow", "Christopher RBowen", "Alan JHunter"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3144521"}

The first group included 50 patients who underwent piezo-assisted outfracturing of the inferior turbinates in combination with bipolar coagulation. The second group included 50 patients who underwent a treatment based on turbinate bipolar coagulation and partial resection of the inferior border of the turbinate. The severity of nasal obstruction was measured in both patient groups with a patient-related outcome questionnaire (NOSE) and objective measures (anterior rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry). Assessments were conducted prior to surgery and 3 months after the surgery.\nThere was a significant improvement in the values of the NOSE questionnaire with no relevant difference between the two study groups. Acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry also showed no statistically significant differences between the two study groups. No differences in postoperative healing were found, and postoperative complications were comparable low in both groups. However, the piezo-assisted procedure was quicker to perform with only minimal bleeding.\nDuring septorhinoplasty, the combination of thermo-coagulation with piezo-assisted turbinoplasty was as efficient as with partial turbinectomy to establish normal nasal breathing.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

The PLLA scaffold under applied force or joint load generated a controllable piezoelectric charge, which promoted extracellular protein adsorption, facilitated cell migration or recruitment, induced endogenous TGF-\u03b2 via calcium signaling pathway, and improved chondrogenesis and cartilage regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Rabbits with critical-sized osteochondral defects receiving the piezoelectric scaffold and exercise treatment experienced hyaline-cartilage regeneration and completely healed cartilage with abundant chondrocytes and type II collagen after 1 to 2 months of exercise (2 to 3 months after surgery including 1 month of recovery before exercise), whereas rabbits treated with nonpiezoelectric scaffold and exercise treatment had unfilled defect and limited healing.

The proposed system consists of a bistable oscillator based on a cantilever beam structure. The elastic force potential is modified by magnets. The hysteresis is an additional effect of the composite beam considered in this system, and it effects the modal solution with specific mass distribution. Consequently, the modal response is a compromise between two overlapping, competing shapes. The simulation results show evolution in the single potential well solution, and bifurcations into double-well solutions with the hysteretic effect. The maximal Lyapunov exponent indicated the appearance of chaotic solutions. Inclusion of the shape branch overlap parameter reduces the distance between the external potential barriers and leads to a large-amplitude solution and simultaneously higher voltage output with smaller excitation force. The overlap parameter works in the other direction: the larger the overlap value, the smaller the voltage output.

{"title": "Vibration Energy Harvesting by Means of Piezoelectric Patches: Application to Aircrafts.", "abstract": "Vibration energy harvesters in industrial applications usually take the form of cantilever oscillators covered by a layer of piezoelectric material and exploit the resonance phenomenon to improve the generated power. In many aeronautical applications, the installation of cantilever harvesters is not possible owing to the lack of room and/or safety and durability requirements. In these cases, strain piezoelectric harvesters can be adopted, which directly exploit the strain of a vibrating aeronautic component. In this research, a mathematical model of a vibrating slat is developed with the modal superposition approach and is coupled with the model of a piezo-electric patch directly bonded to the slat. The coupled model makes it possible to calculate the power generated by the strain harvester in the presence of the broad-band excitation typical of the aeronautic environment. The optimal position of the piezoelectric patch along the slat length is discussed in relation with the modes of vibration of the slat. Finally, the performance of the strain piezoelectric harvester is compared with the one of a cantilever harvester tuned to the frequency of the most excited slat mode.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["DomenicoTommasino", "FedericoMoro", "BrunoBernay", "ThibaultDe Lumley Woodyear", "Enriquede Pablo Corona", "AlbertoDoria"], "doi": "10.3390/s22010363\n10.1088/1742-6596/382/1/012025\n10.1109/JSEN.2009.2028775\n10.3390/s20226685\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2015.10.001\n10.1007/s13369-019-03721-0\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.06.010\n10.1117/12.917039\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.106861\n10.1177/1045389X20922907\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.518.246\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa95ed\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/11/115005\n10.1177/1045389X16635846\n10.3390/machines9080162\n10.1177/1045389X07085639\n10.3390/electronics9091377\n10.1109/TPEL.2012.2192291\n10.1016/j.ast.2021.106805\n10.1109/TIA.2021.3116221\n10.1109/EVER48776.2020.9243060\n10.1080/00150193.2019.1611110\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.043"}
{"title": "Rapid Prototypable Biomimetic Peristalsis Bioreactor Capable of Concurrent Shear and Multi-Axial Strain.", "abstract": "Peristalsis is a nuanced mechanical stimulus comprised of multi-axial strain (radial and axial strain) and shear stress. Forces associated with peristalsis regulate diverse biological functions including digestion, reproductive function, and urine dynamics. Given the central role peristalsis plays in physiology and pathophysiology, we were motivated to design a bioreactor capable of holistically mimicking peristalsis. We engineered a novel rotating screw-drive based design combined with a peristaltic pump, in order to deliver multi-axial strain and concurrent shear stress to a biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane \"wall.\" Radial indentation and rotation of the screw drive against the wall demonstrated multi-axial strain evaluated via finite element modeling. Experimental measurements of strain using piezoelectric strain resistors were in close alignment with model-predicted values (15.9 \u00b1 4.2% vs. 15.2% predicted). Modeling of shear stress on the \"wall\" indicated a uniform velocity profile and a moderate shear stress of 0.4 Pa. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) seeded on the PDMS \"wall\" and stimulated with peristalsis demonstrated dramatic changes in actin filament alignment, proliferation, and nuclear morphology compared to static controls, perfusion, or strain, indicating that hMSCs sensed and responded to peristalsis uniquely. Lastly, significant differences were observed in gene expression patterns of calponin, caldesmon, smooth muscle actin, and transgelin, corroborating the propensity of hMSCs toward myogenic differentiation in response to peristalsis. Collectively, our data suggest that the peristalsis bioreactor is capable of generating concurrent multi-axial strain and shear stress on a \"wall.\" hMSCs experience peristalsis differently than perfusion or strain, resulting in changes in proliferation, actin fiber organization, smooth muscle actin expression, and genetic markers of differentiation.

In this work, we showed that the angiogenic behavior of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells can be inhibited by using nutlin-3a-loaded ApoE-functionalized polymeric piezoelectric nanoparticles, which can remotely respond to ultrasound stimulation. The anti-angiogenic effect, derived from the use of chemotherapy and chronic piezoelectric stimulation, leads to disruption of tubular vessel formation, decreased cell migration and invasion, and inhibition of angiogenic growth factors in the presence of migratory cues released by the tumor cells.

{"title": "Progress in understanding the structural mechanism underlying prestin's electromotile activity.", "abstract": "Prestin (SLC26A5), a member of the SLC26 transporter family, is the molecular actuator that drives OHC electromotility (eM). A wealth of biophysical data indicates that eM is mediated by an area motor mechanism, in which prestin molecules act as elementary actuators by changing their area in the membrane in response to changes in membrane potential. The area changes of a large and densely packed population of prestin molecules sum up, resulting in macroscopic cellular movement. At the single protein level, this model implies major voltage-driven conformational rearrangements. However, the nature of these structural dynamics remained unknown. A main obstacle in elucidating the eM mechanism has been the lack of structural information about SLC26 transporters. The recent emergence of several high-resolution cryo-EM structures of prestin as well as other SLC26 transporter family members now provides a reliable picture of prestin's molecular architecture. Thus, SLC26 transporters including prestin generally are dimers, and each protomer is folded according to a 7+7 transmembrane domain inverted repeat (7TMIR) architecture. Here, we review these structural findings and discuss insights into a potential molecular mechanism. Most important, distinct conformations were observed when purifying and imaging prestin bound to either its physiological ligand, chloride, or to competitively inhibitory anions, sulfate or salicylate. Despite differences in detail, these structural snapshots indicate that the conformational landscape of prestin includes rearrangements between the two major domains of prestin's transmembrane region (TMD), core and scaffold ('gate') domains. Notably, distinct conformations differ in the area the TMD occupies in the membrane and in their impact on the immediate lipid environment. Both effects can contribute to generate membrane deformation and thus may underly electromotility. Further functional studies will be necessary to determine whether these or similar structural rearrangements are driven by membrane potential to mediate piezoelectric activity.

However, the low specificity and sensitivity of conventional biosensors, critically related to the choice of bio-recognition elements, limit their practical applicability. Mammalian antibodies have been widely investigated as biorecognition ligands due to high specificity and technological advancement in antibody production. However, antibody-based biosensors are not considered as an efficient approach due to the batch-to-batch inconsistencies as well as low stability. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been increasingly investigated as ligands as they have demonstrated high stability and possessed multiple sites for capturing bacteria. The conjugation of chemo-selective groups with AMPs has allowed effective immobilization of peptides on biosensor surface. However, the specificity of AMPs is a major concern for consideration as an efficient ligand. In this article, we have reviewed the advances and concerns, particularly the selectivity of AMPs for specific detection of pathogenic bacteria. This review also focuses the state-of-the-art mechanisms, challenges and prospects for designing potential AMP conjugated biosensors.

Linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is a practical solution to improve the positioning accuracy.

In this work, a robust U-model active disturbance rejection control (RUADRC) is proposed by incorporating the core idea of the U-model control and the Glover-McFarlane control. Then, the controlled plant can be dynamically transformed to a unit. Difficulties in stabilizing high-order pure integrators are decreased, the phase lag between the input and output of a controlled plant is reduced, and the closed-loop responses is sped up.

To address this challenge, a CT-compatible 2.5-MHz cardiac phased array transducer is developed via modeling, and then, an initial prototype is fabricated and evaluated for acoustic and radiographic performance. This 92-element piezoelectric array transducer is designed with a thin acoustic backing (6.5 mm) to reduce the volume of the radiopaque acoustic backing that typically causes arrays to be incompatible with CT imaging.

However, up-to-date, high-resolution study methods for the investigation of structural defects, such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray tomography, etc., are expensive and demand complicated sample preparation. With an example of the lanthanum-doped bismuth ferrite ceramics, a novel method is proposed based on the switching spectroscopy piezoresponse force microscopy (SSPFM) that allows probing the electric potential from buried subsurface charged defects in the ferroelectric materials with a nanometer-scale spatial resolution. When compared with the composition-sensitive methods, such as neutron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and local time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the SSPFM sensitivity to the variation of the electric potential from the charged defects is shown to be equivalent to less than 0.3 at% of the defect concentration. Additionally, the possibility to locally evaluate dynamics of the polarization screening caused by the charged defects is demonstrated, which is of significant interest for further understanding defect-mediated processes in ferroelectrics.", "journal": "Small methods", "date": "2021-12-31", "authors": ["DenisAlikin", "AlexanderAbramov", "AntonTurygin", "AntonIevlev", "VictoriaPryakhina", "DmitryKarpinsky", "QingyuanHu", "LiJin", "VladimirShur", "AlexanderTselev", "AndreiKholkin"], "doi": "10.1002/smtd.202101289"}
{"title": "Of mice and chickens: Revisiting the RC time constant problem.", "abstract": "Avian hair cells depend on electrical resonance for frequency selectivity. The upper bound of the frequency range is limited by the RC time constant of hair cells because the sharpness of tuning requires that the resonance frequency must be lower than the RC roll-off frequency. In contrast, tuned mechanical vibration of the inner ear is the basis of frequency selectivity of the mammalian ear. This mechanical vibration is supported by outer hair cells (OHC) with their electromotility (or piezoelectricity), which is driven by the receptor potential. Thus, it is also subjected to the RC time constant problem. Association of OHCs with a system with mechanical resonance leads to piezoelectric resonance. This resonance can nullify the membrane capacitance and solves the RC time constant problem for OHCs. Therefore, avian and mammalian ears solve the same problem in the opposite way.

The vibration characteristics, radiated sound field characteristics and heat dissipation characteristics of the HPUT are compared with those of traditional Langevin ultrasonic transducer (TLUT) through simulations and experiments. Results manifest that compared with the TLUT, the HPUT has much lower operation temperature (reduced by 60% in this study), much smaller resonant frequency shift (reduced by 75% in this study) and the higher vibration amplitude (increased by 25% in this study).

We present the use of the chameleon, a commercially-available piezoelectric cryogenic electron microscopy plunger, to address complex denaturation in the Neisseria gonorrhoeae class Ia RNR. Here, we characterize the extent of denaturation of the ring-shaped complex following grid preparation using a traditional plunger and using a chameleon with varying dispense-to-plunge times. We also characterize how dispense-to-plunge time influences the amount of protein sample required for grid preparation and preferred orientation of the sample. We demonstrate that the fastest dispense-to-plunge time of 54\u00a0ms is sufficient for generation of a data set that produces a high quality structure, and that a traditional plunging technique or slow chameleon dispense-to-plunge times generate data sets limited in resolution by complex denaturation.

Recently, piezocatalysis based removal of pollutants has become a promising field of research to combat such pollutions by virtue of the piezoelectric effect. In reality, piezoelectric materials can produce electron-hole separation upon external vibration, which greatly enhances the production of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) and further increases the pollutant degradation rate. Piezocatalysis does not alter the quality or composition of water, like several other conventional techniques (adsorption and photocatalysis), which makes this technique non-invasive. The simplicity and tremendously high efficacy of piezocatalysis have attracted researchers worldwide and thus various functional materials are employed for piezocatalytic wastewater remediation.

To address this issue, clinicians often use electrical stimulation to improve surgery success rates and decrease healing time in patients with increased risk of pseudarthrosis, including smokers and diabetics. Current invasive electrical stimulation devices require an implantable battery and a second surgery for removal. Piezoelectric composites within an interbody implant generate sufficient power under physiologic loads to deliver pulsed electrical stimulation without a battery and have demonstrated promising preclinical bone growth and fusion success. The objective of the current study was to assess the power generation and fatigue resistance of three commercially manufactured piezocomposite configurations in a modified implant design to demonstrate efficacy as a robust biomaterial within osteogenic implants. The three configurations were electromechanically assessed under physiological lumbar loading conditions, and all configurations produced sufficient power to promote bone healing. Additionally, electrical and mechanical fatigue performance was assessed under high load, low cycle conditions. All configurations demonstrated runout with no gross mechanical failure and two configurations demonstrated electrical fatigue resistance.

{"title": "C. elegans PEZO-1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel involved in food sensation.", "abstract": "PIEZO channels are force sensors essential for physiological processes, including baroreception and proprioception. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes an orthologue gene of the Piezo family, pezo-1, which is expressed in several tissues, including the pharynx. This myogenic pump is an essential component of the C. elegans alimentary canal, whose contraction and relaxation are modulated by mechanical stimulation elicited by food content. Whether pezo-1 encodes a mechanosensitive ion channel and contributes to pharyngeal function remains unknown. Here, we leverage genome editing, genetics, microfluidics, and electropharyngeogram recording to establish that pezo-1 is expressed in the pharynx, including in a proprioceptive-like neuron, and regulates pharyngeal function. Knockout (KO) and gain-of-function (GOF) mutants reveal that pezo-1 is involved in fine-tuning pharyngeal pumping frequency, as well as sensing osmolarity and food mechanical properties. Using pressure-clamp experiments in primary C. elegans embryo cultures, we determine that pezo-1 KO cells do not display mechanosensitive currents, whereas cells expressing wild-type or GOF PEZO-1 exhibit mechanosensitivity. Moreover, infecting the Spodoptera frugiperda cell line with a baculovirus containing the G-isoform of pezo-1 (among the longest isoforms) demonstrates that pezo-1 encodes a mechanosensitive channel. Our findings reveal that pezo-1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel that regulates food sensation in worms.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2021-12-03", "authors": ["Jonathan R MMillet", "Luis ORomero", "JungsooLee", "BriarBell", "ValeriaV\u00e1squez"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.202112960\n10.1098/rstb.1976.0085\n10.1038/ncomms2899\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2017.01.001\n10.3908/wormatlas.1.15\n10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125836\n10.1242/jeb.175.1.283\n10.1016/0896-6273(89)90206-7\n10.1093/genetics/134.2.455\n10.1073/pnas.1219777110\n10.7554/eLife.53603\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007584\n10.1093/genetics/77.1.71\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.09.029\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0803-20.2020\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.1051/medsci/20122812012\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1073/pnas.1221400110\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.075\n10.1093/emboj/16.19.5867\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.049\n10.1073/pnas.0904036106\n10.1038/nature15247\n10.1016/j.neuron.2012.04.023\n10.1073/pnas.1809662115\n10.4161/chan.21064\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000117\n10.7554/eLife.33660\n10.1146/annurev-arplant-043014-114700\n10.1242/jeb.204.20.3403\n10.1093/jpepsy/jsj069\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.10.005\n10.1074/jbc.M402429200\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110750\n10.1101/2021.05.24.445504\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.026\n10.1007/978-1-62703-619-1_21\n10.1093/genetics/164.1.153\n10.1038/nature10801\n10.1242/jeb.067199\n10.1146/annurev.micro.112408.134106\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-01-00159.1999\n10.1038/ncomms14221\n10.1038/ncomms1780\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.047\n10.1038/nature13250\n10.1895/wormbook.1.129.1\n10.1073/pnas.84.8.2297\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.015\n10.7554/eLife.63049\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9897\n10.1242/jeb.00101\n10.1046/j.1365-2443.1999.00264.x\n10.1016/j.neuron.2018.07.033\n10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.048\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1016/0896-6273(94)90207-0\n10.1093/genetics/141.4.1365\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.1038/s41467-017-00429-3\n10.1038/s41467-019-09055-7\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1534/genetics.116.195511\n10.1242/jeb.01955\n10.1163/187529278X00074\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000222\n10.1038/nprot.2007.143\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9892\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.023\n10.1038/srep22940\n10.1113/JP277895\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0030053\n10.4161/worm.19148\n10.1172/JCI87343\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.08.017\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1038/nn.4162\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.09.004\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.120\n10.1002/ajmg.a.61142\n10.1038/nature11685\n10.1371/journal.pone.0134401\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422253\n10.1126/science.aau6324\n10.1038/nature25743"}

In total, 18.43% of patients suffered from Clavien I-II and 2.48% from Clavien III-IV complications. In studies with >100 treated patients, Clavien I, III, and IV complication rates and need for auxiliary procedure rates were lower than in studies with smaller sample size. Electrohydraulic lithotripters led to a higher rate of Clavien IIIb and IV complications than electromagnetic lithotripters. Clavien I-II complications were increased by 14.3% in patients with multiple and complicated stones. Hematuria was increased by 8.29% in patients who underwent intravenous urography preoperatively and had longer duration of SWL. Pain occurrence was increased by 14.79% in patients with more than one stone at the time of SWL and by 3.21% in those who were managed with a piezoelectric lithotripter.\nSWL should not be considered an uneventful procedure, as in 2.5% of cases an intervention or Clavien III-V complication will be observed. Low-volume centers, treatment of multiple or complex stones, a long-lasting SWL session, and electrohydraulic lithotripters are associated with higher rates of complications.\nWe analyze the occurrence of shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) complications in 17000 patients.

This work presents a new jet dispenser driven by a single piezoelectric stack that enables the capability of drop-on-demand patterning under a high working frequency (500 Hz). Due to the special designs of the jet dispenser, a broad range of liquids, whose viscosities span more than four orders of magnitude (21-665 320 cps), can be jetted. Moreover, a coupled Coulomb damping physical model is proposed, which includes an electromechanical and a dynamic model. Both the Coulomb and the fluid-solid damping are considered in the dynamic model. In order to validate the results obtained by using MATLAB/Simulink, the experiments were carried out. The injection performance of this jet dispenser has been tested by employing a self-made jetting platform. The minimum volume of a jetting droplet is about 14.4 nL with liquid wax. The error of volume uniformity among droplets does not exceed 8%, and the error of angle trajectory is about 0.17\u00b0.

For five crystals with compositions distributed across the main body of a crystal ingot, the piezoelectric coefficient and free relative permittivity values were measured to vary by over 30%, whereas the transducer bandwidth and center frequency values were modeled to change by less than 10%. For the single-element ultrasonic transducers fabricated using those crystals without matching layers, the variations of -6-dB bandwidth, insertion loss, receiver-free field voltage response, and center frequency were measured to be 9.61%, -15.23%, 9.76%, and 1.41%, respectively, confirming the modeling results. Using the Mason and Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei (KLM) models, it is found that the relatively stable transducer performance can be attributed to the relatively consistent electromechanical coupling coefficient, acoustic impedance, and clamped relative permittivity originated from the stable elastic compliance properties among the crystals of various compositions. It is expected that the relatively stable performance could be extended to multielement transducers with matching layers for the same contributing mechanisms. Our results suggest that it is possible to use crystal plates of different compositions within the MPB region, obtained from one and the same ingot, to fabricate a batch of ultrasonic transducers that will exhibit a similar performance, significantly reducing the cost of materials.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-12-01", "authors": ["ZiboJiang", "ChenxueHou", "ChunlongFei", "ZhaoxiLi", "Zuo-GuangYe"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3131204"}

As there is little experience with the tapes so far and literature is scanty, the aim of this study was to investigate biomechanical properties for the fixation of the PVDF-tapes with three different fixation methods in context of apical fixations.\nEvaluation was performed on porcine, fresh cadaver sacral spines. A total of 40 trials, divided into 4 subgroups, was performed on the anterior longitudinal ligament. Recorded biomechanical properties were displacement at failure, maximum load and stiffness in terms of the primary endpoints. The failure mode was a secondary endpoint. Group 4 was a reference group to compare single sutures on porcine tissue with those on human tissue. Biomechanical parameters for single sutures on the human anterior longitudinal ligament were evaluated in a previous work by Hachenberg et al. RESULTS: The maximum load for group 1 (two single sutures) was 65\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0N, for group 2 (three titanium tacks arranged in a row) it was 25\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0N and for group 3 (three titanium tacks arranged in a triangle) it was 38\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0N. There was a significant difference between all three groups. The most common failure mode was a \"mesh failure\" in 9/10 trials for groups 1-3.\nThe PVDF-tape fixation with two single sutures endures 2.6 times more load than titanium tacks arranged in a row and 1.7 times more load than titanium tacks arranged in a triangle.

Superior and mesenteric resistance arteries, aortae, and their PVATs from male Sprague Dawley rats were used. Piezo1 mRNA was detected in aortic vessels, aortic PVAT, mesenteric vessels, and mesenteric PVAT. Both adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction of mesenteric PVAT expressed Piezo1 mRNA.

We recorded the initial dry weight for each PP and PVDFM using a digital balance to \u00b10.0001 precision for absorbency. PPs and PVDFMs were then immersed in deionized water and weighed to obtain the wet weight. The absorbency was calculated with the following formula: percent increase\u00a0=\u00a0([wet weight - dry weight]/dry weight) \u00d7 100. For endotoxin removal, we first quantified endotoxin remaining in wells after immersing PPs and PVDFMs in a 24-well plate containing 10 endotoxin units/mL Escherichia coli O55:B5 (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). We then extracted and quantified endotoxin from PPs and PVDFMs. Endotoxin was quantified using the Kinetic-QCL test (Lonza).\nThe absorbencies for the positively charged and noncharged PVDFMs were higher than the PPs (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), with no difference between them (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05). The positively charged PVDFMs removed more endotoxin than the noncharged PVDFMs and the PPs (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Moreover, the noncharged PVDFMs bound and removed more endotoxin than any PPs (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nPVDFM prototype points are more absorbent than PPs.

{"title": "Acidic pH reduces agonist efficacy and responses to synaptic-like glycine applications in zebrafish \u03b11 and rat \u03b11\u03b2 recombinant glycine receptors.", "abstract": "Many pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are modulated by extracellular pH. Glycine receptors (GlyRs) share this property, but it is not well understood how they are affected by pH changes. Whole cell experiments on HEK293 cells expressing zebrafish homomeric \u03b11 GlyR confirmed previous reports that acidic pH (6.4) reduces GlyR sensitivity to glycine, whereas alkaline pH (8.4) has small or negligible effects. In addition to that, at pH 6.4 we observed a reduction in the maximum responses to the partial agonists \u03b2-alanine and taurine relative to the full agonist glycine. In cell-attached single-channel recording, low pH reduced agonist efficacy, as the maximum open probability decreased from 0.97, 0.91 and 0.66 to 0.93, 0.57 and 0.34 for glycine, \u03b2-alanine and taurine, respectively, reflecting a threefold decrease in efficacy equilibrium constants for all three agonists. We also tested the effect of pH 6.4 in conditions that replicate those at the native synapse, recording outside-out currents elicited by fast application of millisecond pulses of agonists on \u03b11 and \u03b11\u03b2 GlyR, at a range of intracellular chloride concentrations. Acidic pH reduced the area under the curve of the currents, by reducing peak amplitude, slowing activation and speeding deactivation. Our results show that acidification of the extracellular pH by one unit, as may occur in pathological conditions such as ischaemia, impairs GlyR gating and is likely to reduce the effectiveness of glycinergic synaptic inhibition. KEY POINTS: Extracellular pH in the central nervous system (CNS) is known to shift towards acidic values during pathophysiological conditions such as ischaemia and seizures. Acidic extracellular pH is known to affect GABAergic inhibitory synapses, but its effect on signals mediated by glycine receptors (GlyR) is not well characterised. Moderate acidic conditions (pH 6.4) reduce the maximum single channel open probability of recombinant homomeric GlyRs produced by the neurotransmitter glycine or other agonists, such as \u03b2-alanine and taurine. When glycine was applied with a piezoelectric stepper to outside out patches, to simulate its fast rise and short duration at the synapse, responses became shorter and smaller at pH 6.4. The effect was also observed with physiologically low intracellular chloride and in mammalian heteromeric GlyRs. This suggests that acidic pH is likely to reduce the strength of inhibitory signalling at glycinergic synapses.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2021-11-22", "authors": ["JosipIvica", "RemigijusLape", "Lucia GSivilotti"], "doi": "10.1113/JP282171"}
{"title": "Crosstalk reduction in a piezoelectric phononic plate induced by electrical boundary conditions: Application to multi-element transducers.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a method of passive electrical decoupling which aimed at found application in reducing the crosstalk phenomenon in multi-element ultrasonic transducers. A homogeneous piezoelectric plate, covered on one side by a 1D periodic arrangement of thin metallic electrodes and on the other side by a full electrode, is considered. Finite element analysis and experimental measurements are performed to obtain the dispersion curves and normal displacements at the surface of the structure. It is shown that applying inductive shunts at the electrodes, band gaps can be created in the first Brillouin zone, which can prevent from the establishment of the first thickness mode in the plate. In that way the mechanical inter-element coupling can be lowered. Thus, the acoustic radiation in water from one sector excited at the resonance frequency is found to be closer to that of a piston mode. The transposition of this principle to the situation of a transducer including a rear medium and a front matching layer confirms the possibility of reducing the inter-element coupling. However, the physical effects at the origin of this reduction are different from those inherent to the cutting of a piezocomposite ceramic as it is done in most probes available in the market. As a result, we show that taking advantage of the electrical boundary conditions upon the passive elements in a transducer gives real opportunities for crosstalk reduction that may be implemented in ultrasonic systems for imaging in the medical field and in NDT.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-11-21", "authors": ["LFei", "LHaumesser", "L-PTran-Huu-Hu\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106638"}

In the last two decades, in particular, the research on piezoelectrics has largely been driven by the constantly changing technological demand, and the drive toward a sustainable society. Hence, environmental-friendly \"lead-free piezoelectrics\" have emerged in the anticipation of replacing lead-based counterparts with at least comparable performance. However, there are still obstacles to be overcome for realizing this objective, while the efforts in this direction already seem to culminate. Therefore, novel structural strategies need to be designed to address these issues and for further breakthrough in this field. Here, various strategies to enhance piezoelectric properties in lead-free systems with fundamental and historical context, and from atomic to macroscopic scale, are explored. The main challenges currently faced in the transition from lead-based to lead-free piezoelectrics are identified and key milestones for future research in this field are suggested.

The impact of the medium driven by ultrasonic vibration is significant to parameter optimization and excellent performance of the USP technology. However, the impact characteristics of the medium lack careful study, which is a complex dynamic analysis involving many factors, such as collision, plastic deformation, air pressure, etc. In this paper, a detection system is successfully developed to investigate the needle impact force and frequency against the material surface, consisting of a piezoelectric load sensor, oscilloscope, and a single needle USP device. Moreover, the FE model of the needle impact is developed simultaneously to study the characteristics of residual stress implantation induced by needle impact. Based on the experiment and FE simulation results, it is discovered that the impacts with high speed primarily determine the thickness of the modified layer implanted with residual stress during multiple impacts at different rates. According to residual stress implantation characteristics, the low-speed impact whose speed does not reach 50% of the maximum impact speed was defined as the ineffective impact. Besides, increasing the amplitude of ultrasonic vibration results in a significant increase in the maximum impact force and the effective impact frequency. The travel distance of needle impact has a considerable effect on the effective impact frequency, but it has little effect on the maximum impact force. Finally, it was concluded that the low air pressure plays a positive role in the needle impact. Furthermore, excessive air pressure hinders the needle impact and results in a decline in the effective impact frequency and the maximum impact force.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-11-16", "authors": ["QinglongZhang", "SuZhao", "AzizUl Hassan Mohsan", "LeiYu", "MenggangZhai", "XiaowenQi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106634"}

Complete data were obtained from 30 subjects (15 women, 15 men; mean age 31.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\u00a0years; mean weight 61.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4\u00a0kg). Compared to women, men showed a trend for generating larger MAIP (p\u2009=\u20090.06; d\u2009=\u20090.71) and RESS (p\u2009=\u20090.07; d\u2009=\u20090.69). After normalizing to body weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), such trends disappeared. At retest, MAIP and RESS proved stable and highly reliable (all ICCs\u2009\u2265\u20090.93) in men and women but associated to moderate variability as for SEM and MDC, with MAIP estimates associated to smaller SEM and MDC (SEM ranging 7.4-14.2%; MDC 18.6-20.9%) than RESS (SEM ranging 20.4-38.5%; MDC 52.5-55.6%). Piezo-resistive pressure sensors allow clinicians and researchers to perform reproducible measurements of tongue muscle performance. However, if therapeutic interventions are administered, measurement variability in tongue performance should be considered when appraising their clinical efficacy, especially for those populations who display impaired performance and may not be capable to generate high and stable forces.

Both assays are performed in a 96-well format and measures the frequency of analyte-secreting cells, in ELISpot usually limited to one analyte per well due to the use of enzymes and precipitating substrates for detection. FluoroSpot, performed in a similar way as ELISpot, overcomes this limitation by detecting each analyte with an assigned fluorophore instead of an enzyme. By using readers equipped with fluorophore-specific filters, cells producing single or multiple cytokines can be identified simultaneously in the same well. This greatly facilitates the analysis of functionally distinct subpopulations in heterogenous cell samples, for example, the frequency of polyfunctional T cells, suggested to be of importance in various disease states. FluoroSpot maintains the simplicity and sensitivity of the ELISpot while taking the assay a step further towards a multiplex analysis and an in-depth understanding of the quality of an immune response.

Homeostasis involves a variety of feedback mechanisms involving peripheral afferents, many of which contain molecular receptors sensitive to mechanical deformation, termed mechanosensors. Here, we focus on the molecular identity of mechanosensors involved in the baroreflex control of the cardiovascular system. Located within the walls of the aortic arch and carotid sinuses, and/or astrocytes in the brain, these mechanosensors are essential for the rapid moment-to-moment feedback regulation of blood pressure (BP). Growing evidence suggests that these mechanosensors form a co-existing system of peripheral and central baroreflexes. Despite the importance of these molecules in cardiovascular disease and decades of research, their precise molecular identity remains elusive. The uncertainty surrounding the identity of these mechanosensors presents a major challenge in understanding basic baroreceptor function and has hindered the development of novel therapeutic targets for conditions with known arterial baroreflex impairments. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to (i) provide a brief overview of arterial and central baroreflex control of BP, (ii) review classes of ion channels currently proposed as the baroreflex mechanosensor, namely Transient Receptor Potential (TRP), Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC), Acid Sensing Ion Channel (ASIC), and Piezo, along with additional molecular candidates that serve mechanotransduction in other organ systems, and (iii) summarize the potential clinical implications of impaired baroreceptor function in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2021-11-05", "authors": ["HannahYang", "LuanaTenorio Lopes", "Nicole OBarioni", "JamieRoeske", "Anthony VIncognito", "JacquieBaker", "Satish RRaj", "Richard J AWilson"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvab334"}
{"title": "An Original 2-D Analytical Model for Investigating Coupled Vibrations of Finite Piezoelectric Resonators.", "abstract": "This article deals with 2-D modeling of coupled vibrations of finite piezoelectric resonators. A general solution for all the physical quantities in the Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems is deduced from the governing equations by expansion in series summation of trigonometric functions of thickness coordinate and trigonometric or Bessel functions of the lateral one. The essential difference between this model and the earlier ones is that instead of expressing mainly in the thickness coordinate and integration through the thickness, the solutions are expressed in the form of double Fourier series augmented by single Fourier or Fourier-Bessel series, which contributes to better satisfy the mechanical and electrical boundary conditions. The dynamic stiffness matrix of the system is developed. Electrical impedances of a typical piezoelectric parallelepiped under stress-free and symmetrical loading conditions and its frequency spectrum for different width-to-thickness ratios are calculated using our model as well as by the finite element method. A comparison shows an excellent agreement. Finally, theoretical and measured electrical impedances of a piezoelectric parallelepiped and a piezoelectric disk are compared and discussed. The 2-D theoretical model proposed here is shown to be accurate and efficient for coupled vibration analysis of piezoelectric resonators and is applicable for any set of finite dimensions and crystal symmetry.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-11-03", "authors": ["WenxiangDing", "MaximeBavencoffe", "MarcLethiecq"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3125271"}

{"title": "Spatial arrangement of proteins in planar and curved membranes by PPM 3.0.", "abstract": "Cellular protrusions, invaginations, and many intracellular organelles have strongly curved membrane regions. Transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins that induce, sense, or stabilize such regions cannot be properly fitted into a single flat bilayer. To treat such proteins, we developed a new method and a web tool, PPM 3.0, for positioning proteins in curved or planar, single or multiple membranes. This method determines the energetically optimal spatial position, the hydrophobic thickness, and the radius of intrinsic curvature of a membrane-deforming protein structure by arranging it in a single or several sphere-shaped or planar membrane sections. In addition, it can define the lipid-embedded regions of a protein that simultaneously spans several membranes or determine the optimal position of a peptide in a spherical micelle. The PPM 3.0 web server operates with 17 types of biological membranes and 4 types of artificial bilayers. It is publicly available at https://opm.phar.umich.edu/ppm_server3.

However, neither a single polymer nor liquid electrolyte can realize this due to their limited internal energy gap, which cannot avoid lithium-metal deposition and electrolyte oxidation simultaneously. Herein, a novel type of quasi-double-layer composite polymer electrolytes (QDL-CPEs) is proposed by using plasticizers with high oxidation stability (propylene carbonate) and high reduction stability (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based electrolyte composites. In-situ-polymerized propylene carbonate can function as a cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film, which can enhance the antioxidant ability. The nucleophilic substitution reaction between diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and PVDF increases the reduction stability of the electrolyte on the anodic side, without the formation of lithium dendrites. The QDL-CPEs has high ionic conductivity, an enhanced electrochemical reaction window, adjustable electrode/electrolyte interphases, and no additional electrolyte-electrolyte interfacial resistance.

{"title": "Video-Rate Dual-Modal Wide-Beam Harmonic Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Computed Tomography.", "abstract": "Dual-modal ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging has tremendous advantages in biomedical applications, such as pharmacokinetics, cancer screening, and imaging-guided therapy. Compared with ring-shaped arrays, a linear piezoelectric transducer array applies to more anatomical sites and has been widely used in US/PA imaging. However, the linear array may limit the imaging quality due to narrow bandwidth, partial detection view, or sparse spatial sampling. To meet clinic demand of high-quality US/PA imaging with the linear transducer, we develop dual-modal wide-beam harmonic ultrasound (WBHUS) and photoacoustic computed tomography at video rate. The harmonic US imaging employs pulse phase inversion to reduce clutters and improve spatial resolution. Wide-beam US transmission can shorten the scanning times by 267% and enables a 20-Hz imaging rate, which can minimize motion artifacts in in vivo imaging. The harmonic US imaging does not only provide accurate anatomical references for locating PA features but also reduces artifacts in PA images. The improved image quality allows us to acquire high-resolution anatomical structures in deep tissue without labeling. The fast-imaging speed enables visualizing interventional procedures and monitoring the pulsations of the thoracic aorta and radial artery in real-time. The video-rate dual-modal harmonic US and single-shot PA computed tomography use a clinical-grade linear-array transducer and thus can be readily implemented in clinical US imaging.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "date": "2021-10-26", "authors": ["YachaoZhang", "YueWang", "PuxiangLai", "LidaiWang"], "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2021.3122240"}

The first step was to harvest the frontal bone flap and the orbitofrontal bone flap. The second step was to separate the scalp and expose the posterior occipital. Osteotomy was performed on the occipital tubercle. Thereafter, 2 distractors were horizontally installed on the upper edge of the anterior cranial orbit, 2 distractors of 3\u200acm were installed on the posterior cranial bone.

Bone distraction was initiated on postoperative day 5 at the rate of 0.4 to 0.6\u200amm/day, twice per-day, for a total of 10 to 15\u200adays.

Biosensors are effective for early detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection because they target viral antigens to assess clinical development and provide information on the severity and critical trends of infection. The biosensors are capable of being on-site, fast, and extremely sensitive to the target viral antigen, opening the door for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. They can screen individuals in hospitals, airports, and other crowded locations. Microfluidics and nanotechnology are promising cornerstones for the development of biosensor-based techniques. Recently, due to high selectivity, simplicity, low cost, and reliability, the production of biosensor instruments have attracted considerable interest. This review article precisely provides the extensive scientific advancement and intensive look of basic principles and implementation of biosensors in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, especially for human health. In this review, the importance of biosensors including Optical, Electrochemical, Piezoelectric, Microfluidic, Paper-based biosensors, Immunosensors, and Nano-Biosensors in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been underscored.

The transmit and receive performance figure of merit (FOM) of an individual PMUT over operating frequency is modeled and validated using laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) measurements. Given a fixed cross section, the FOM inversely scales with frequency. The array aperture size is selected to obtain enough pressure and received signal to measure the radial artery wall reflection at a 5-mm depth in tissue. The 2-mm acoustic beamwidth provides enough lateral resolution for radial artery wall motion tracking. Single-line ultrasonic pulse-echo measurements with high time resolution, also called M-mode ultrasound imaging, are demonstrated to reproduce a known target motion profile with a precision of around 0.5 [Formula: see text]. In vivo radial artery dynamics are measured by placing the sensor on the wrist of a volunteer.

{"title": "Passive Cavitation Detection With a Needle Hydrophone Array.", "abstract": "Therapeutic ultrasound and microbubble technologies seek to drive systemically administered microbubbles into oscillations that safely manipulate tissue or release drugs. Such procedures often detect the unique acoustic emissions from microbubbles with the intention of using this feedback to control the microbubble activity. However, most sensor systems reported introduce distortions to the acoustic signal. Acoustic shockwaves, a key emission from microbubbles, are largely absent in reported recording, possibly due to the sensors being too large or too narrowband, or having strong phase distortions. Here, we built a sensor array that countered such limitations with small, broadband sensors and a low-phase distorting material. We built eight needle hydrophones with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, diameter: 2 mm) then fit them into a 3-D-printed scaffold in a two-layered, staggered arrangement. Using this array, we monitored microbubbles exposed to therapeutically relevant ultrasound pulses (center frequency: 0.5 MHz, peak-rarefactional pressure: 130-597 kPa, pulselength: four cycles). Our tests revealed that the hydrophones were broadband with the best having a sensitivity of -224.8 dB \u00b1 3.2 dB re 1 V/ \u03bc Pa from 1 to 15 MHz. The array was able to capture shockwaves generated by microbubbles. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the array was approximately two times higher than individual hydrophones. Also, the array could localize microbubbles (-3 dB lateral resolution: 2.37 mm) and determine the cavitation threshold (between 161 and 254 kPa). Thus, the array accurately monitored and localized microbubble activities, and may be an important technological step toward better feedback control methods and safer and more effective treatments.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-10-15", "authors": ["ZhengJiang", "KritSujarittam", "Betul IlbilgiYildiz", "Robert JDickinson", "James JChoi"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3120263"}

The dependences of the resonance frequency and the maximum value of the real part of the electrical impedance of these resonance peaks on the conductivity of the liquid were measured.

In this case, the maximum value of the real part of the electrical impedance first decreases, reaches a minimum, and then increases in all cases.

However, the existing detection approaches cannot satisfy demand of rapid detection of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) because of the long detection time and high cost. Herein, we proposed a new M. tuberculosis piezoelectric sensor based on AuNPs-mediated enzyme assisted signal amplification. A hairpin-shaped DNA duplex with a protrusion of the 3' end was designed. In the presence of specific 16\u00a0S rDNA fragment of M. tuberculosis, the hairpin probe was opened, which triggered the selective cleavage of hairpin probe by Exonuclease III (Exo III), resulting in the release of uncut DNA probe and target DNA. The released target DNA hybridized with another hairpin-shaped DNA duplex, and a new digestion cycle was started, thus generating large amounts of uncut DNA probes.

{"title": "Backward Data Transfer From Deeply Implanted Device Employing Ultrasonic Load Amplitude-Phase Shift Keying.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic transcutaneous energy transfer (UTET) is used to wirelessly energize low-power miniature implanted devices. Whenever backward data transfer from the implant is of interest, load modulation may be utilized. With load modulation, data is sent backward by imposing ultrasonic reflections from the implant-tissue contact surface. This may be achieved by imposing unmatched electrical load over the implanted transducer electrical terminals. In order to sustain sufficient ultrasonic average power harvesting also during backward data transfer, only a small portion of the impinging ultrasonic energy is allowed to reflect backward. Previous work focused primarily on load modulation via ON- OFF keying (OOK). Herein, it is further shown that phase shift keying can be realized by exploiting the phase characteristics of a matched transducer around its vibration resonance. Load amplitude shift keying (ASK) properly combined with load phase shift keying (LPSK) may be applied, for introducing energy-efficient, high-order signaling schemes, thus improving utilization of the ultrasonic channel. LPSK is realized by momentary imposing reactive loads across the implanted transducer electrical terminals, according to the bit stream of the data to be sent. In this work, LPSK with various constellations and coding are demonstrated, exploiting the acoustic impedance dependency of the implanted piezoelectric resonator on its electrical loading. To support the theoretical notion, a backward data transfer using two-state phase modulation at a bit rate of 20 kbit/s over an ultrasonic carrier frequency of 250 kHz is demonstrated, using finite-element simulation. In the simulation, an implanted transducer was constructed of a 4-mm-diameter hard lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) disk (PZT8, unloaded mechanical quality property Q", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-10-09", "authors": ["ShaulOzeri", "OferAmrani"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3118722"}

Despite the rapid development in the past three years, the mechanism of piezocatalysis is still under debate. A fundamental understanding of the working principles of this technology should enable the future design and optimization of piezocatalysts. Herein, we provide an overview of the two popular theories used to explain the observed piezocatalysis: energy band theory and screening charge effect. A comprehensive discussion and clarification of the differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the two mechanisms are provided.

However, filter performance can be impacted by properties of both the membrane material and the solution being filtered, requiring extensive multi-factor studies to optimize the filtration process for a given drug product. Here, we report the use of a modified bundle of capillaries approximation to predict filter performance. The model is directly applicable for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian solutions and does not require assumptions of steady state. Using a hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filter as a test case, we show that the model fitting parameters align with expected values and both flux and shear are well predicted. Moreover, two case studies are presented to demonstrate the model's utility for filtration process optimization: 1) protein adsorption of an antibody formulation and 2) filter fouling of a 1% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution. In both cases, the model was able to accurately identify optimal filtration parameters to reduce the amount of adsorption or improve the filter capacity, respectively.

Considering the high cost and the limited availability of breast-dedicated meshes in our country, we conducted this study to investigate the consequences of using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh designed for endoscopic and laparoscopic hernia repair (ENDOLAP) as a coverage for breast prostheses in breast reconstruction.\nA retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on data of patients who had underwent immediate implant-based breast reconstruction between 2012 and 2019. After skin sparing mastectomy and subpectoral implant insertion, the exposed lower and lateral parts were covered with the mesh.\nSeventy-nine reconstructions were performed on 62 patients. The average follow-up was 31.9 months (ranges 6-102 months). Postoperative complications including small flap necrosis (3.8%), seroma (8.9%), infection (5.1%), hematoma (3.8%), malposition (1.3%), rippling (1.3%), grade two and three capsular contracture (2.5%), and chronic pain (1.3%) occurred in 19% of the operated breasts.

However, studies on the effects of additive and coagulation bath pH on the morphology and properties of surfactant-modified membranes have rarely been reported. Hence, this study aims to investigate the effects of the additive dosage and the coagulation bath pH on the mechanisms of phase inversion and performance improvement of amphoteric fluorocarbon special surfactant (FS-50) blended PVDF membranes. It was observed that the pure water flux increased from 114.68 LMH/bar of the original membrane M0 to 205.02 LMH/bar of the blend membrane M1, and then to 615.88 LMH/bar of the coagulation-bath-regulated membrane MPH9 with a high BSA rejection rate of 90.86%, showing a two-stage jump. The addition of FS-50 promoted the instantaneous phase inversion of the membrane, allowing the blend membrane to exhibit a higher proportion of pore characteristics and stronger permeability. After that, the mechanisms of the membrane phase inversion process affected by the coagulation bath pH were interpreted according to the pH-response characteristics of FS-50 in terms of charge repulsion effect and compressed double-electron layer effect. Furthermore, the cross-sectional morphology and the surface structure of the membrane prepared in acidic and alkaline coagulation baths were significantly affected by the pH of the coagulation bath, exhibiting different features. For one, the porosity of the membranes gradually decreased as the acidity and alkalinity of the coagulation bath increased, and the membrane MPH9 exhibited both maximum surface and overall porosity. For another, the coagulation bath pH did not negatively affect the contact angle, surface roughness and tensile strength of the membranes. Overall, adjusting the dosage of FS-50 and the pH of the coagulation bath is a promising approach to greatly enhance membrane performance.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2021-09-22", "authors": ["HailongLiu", "XiangjunLiao", "YuxiaRen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132212"}

All teeth were scanned with micro-CT before and after SRP. Group 1: SRP was performed by Gracey-curette, Group 2: SRP was performed by using an ultrasonic device and Group 3: SRP was performed by using a piezo ultrasonic device. Cement loss and porosity of the root surface were analysed by micro-computerized tomography, which is a current imaging technique that provides high-quality images and allows for qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples.\nResults of our study revealed that initial porosity values were 1.60%, 1.25%, 1.59% for the group 1, 2, 3, and 0.93%, 0.86 and 0.80 after SRP respectively. Although Group 3\u00a0had the least surface roughness, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Cement loss following SRP was 47.15\u00a0\u03bcmin the piezo ultrasonic device group, 59.44\u00a0\u00b5m in the ultrasonic device, and 134.163\u00a0\u00b5m in the Gracey-curette group respectively. The highest cement loss was seen in the Gracey-curette group, and there was a significant difference between the three groups.\nIn conclusion, it was observed that surface roughness decreased and similar surface roughness was obtained with all three methods, but more cementum loss was observed with Gracey-curette.

The proposed diagnostic technology directly couples a piezoelectric transducer signal into a Fowler-Nordheim (FN) quantum tunneling-based synchronized dynamical system to record the mechanical usage of spinal fixation devices. The operation of the proposed implantable FN sensor-data-logger is completely self-powered by harvesting the energy from the micro-motion of the spine during the course of fusion. Bench-top testing is performed using corpectomy models to evaluate the performance of the proposed monitoring system. In order to simulate the spinal fusion process, different materials with gradually increasing elastic modulus are used to fill the intervertebral space gap. Besides, finite element models are developed to analyze the strains induced on the spinal rods during the applied cyclic loading. Data measured from the benchtop experiment is processed using an FN sensor-data-logger model to obtain time-evolution curves representing each spinal fusion state.

This study elucidated the effect of vibration feedback stimulation via an oral appliance (OA) on SB when vibration feedback was applied for 4\u00a0weeks.\nThis was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, intervention study. Ten participants diagnosed with \"definite\" SB wore a specially designed OA for 45 nights in a home-setting. A force-based SB detection system, including a pressure-sensitive piezoelectric film placed internally in the OA, triggered a vibrator attached to the OA. Vibratory stimulation was withheld during the first 2-week adaptation period (1st-15th nights), applied during the 4-week stimulation period (16th-43rd nights), and again withheld during the post-stimulation period (44th and 45th nights). The number and duration of SB episodes/hour of sleep were calculated based on masseter electromyographic activity recorded with in-home portable polysomnography and compared between the 15th and 45th nights (without stimulation) and the 17th and 43rd nights (with stimulation).\nThe number and duration of SB episodes significantly decreased after vibratory stimulation (15th vs. 17th nights: p\u2009=\u20090.012 and p\u2009=\u20090.012, respectively), then significantly increased upon cessation of vibratory stimulation after the stimulation period (43rd vs. 45th nights: p\u2009=\u20090.023 and p\u2009=\u20090.023, respectively).\nContingent vibratory stimulation through an OA may suppress SB-related masticatory muscle activity continuously for 4\u00a0weeks and may be an effective alternative for the management of SB.\nhttps://jrct.niph.go.jp/ ; trial registration number: jRCTs032190225.", "journal": "Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung", "date": "2021-08-10", "authors": ["HironobuOhara", "MasayukiTakaba", "YukaAbe", "YukariNakazato", "RisaAoki", "YuyaYoshida", "TakeshiSuganuma", "KazuyoshiBaba"], "doi": "10.1007/s11325-021-02460-7\n10.5664/jcsm.6470\n10.1111/jsr.12481\n10.1016/S0022-3913(12)00086-8\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2010.02.013\n10.1111/joor.12558\n10.1016/j.cden.2012.01.003\n10.1111/jsr.12442\n10.1111/joor.12322\n10.3109/00016357.2012.741702\n10.1067/mpr.2003.82\n10.1067/mpr.2001.114270\n10.1111/j.1365-2842.2005.01576.x\n10.1111/joor.12251\n10.1007/s11325-019-01782-x\n10.1111/joor.13182\n10.1007/s00784-020-03270-z\n10.1177/154405910408300509\n10.5664/jcsm.6618\n10.5664/jcsm.7278\n10.1111/joor.12011\n10.1111/joor.12663\n10.1177/00220345960750010601\n10.1177/154405910708600906\n10.1111/joor.12233\n10.5664/jcsm.3152\n10.1016/j.jpor.2019.04.003\n10.1111/joor.12207"}

{"title": "Exploring electroactive microenvironments in polymer-based nanocomposites to sensitize bacterial cells to low-dose embedded silver nanoparticles.", "abstract": "The search for alternative antimicrobial strategies capable of avoiding resistance mechanisms in bacteria are highly needed due to the alarming emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The application of physical stimuli as a mean of sensitizing bacteria for the action of antimicrobials on otherwise resistant bacteria or by allowing the action of low quantity of antimicrobials may be seen as a breakthrough for such purpose. This work proposes the development of antibacterial nanocomposites using the synergy between the electrically active microenvironments, created by a piezoelectric polymer (poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE)), with green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The electrical microenvironment is generated via mechanical stimulation of piezoelectric PVDF-TrFE/AgNPs films using a lab-made mechanical bioreactor. The generated material's electrical response further translates to bacterial cells, namely Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis which in combination with AgNPs and the specific morphological features of the material induce important antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. Both porous and non-porous PVDF composites have shown antibacterial characteristics when stimulated at a mechanical frequency of 4\u00a0Hz being the effect boosted when AgNPs were incorporated in the nanocomposite, reducing in more than 80% the S. epidermidis bacterial growth in planktonic and biofilm form. The electroactive environments sensitize the bacteria allowing the action of a low dose of AgNPs (1.69% (w/w)). Importantly, the material did not compromise the viability of mammalian cells, thus being considered biocompatible. The piezoelectric stimulation of PVDF-based polymeric films may represent a breakthrough in the development of antibacterial coatings for devices used at hospital setting, taking advantage on the use of mechanical stimuli (pressure/touch) to exert antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The application of physical methods in alternative to the common chemical ones is seen as a breakthrough for avoiding the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial strategies that take advantage on the capability of bacteria to sense physical stimuli such as mechanical and electrical cues are scarce. Electroactive nanocomposites comprised of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) and green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were developed to obtain material able to inhibit the colonization of microorganisms. By applying a mechanical stimuli to the nanocomposite, which ultimately mimics movements such as walking or touching, an antimicrobial effect is obtained, resulting from the synergy between the electroactive microenvironments created on the surface of the material and the AgNPs. Such environments sensitize the bacteria to low doses of antimicrobials.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2021-08-07", "authors": ["JoanaMoreira", "Margarida MFernandes", "Estela OCarvalho", "AnaNicolau", "VesnaLazic", "Jovan MNedeljkovi\u0107", "SenentxuLanceros-Mendez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2021.07.067"}

In view of the lack of consensus on the effectiveness of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw treatments in the literature, the aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical technique described in the treatment of advanced stages of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw patients.\nTwenty-one patients affected by Stage 2-3 medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw were treated with ultrasonic piezoelectric bone surgery for necrotic bone removing, leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin concentrate obtained from the patient's peripheral blood and Nd:YAG laser for biostimulation. Success was assessed as the maintenance of full mucosal coverage without signs of residual infection at 1-month (T1), 3-months (T2), 6-months (T3) and 1-year (T4) after surgery. Logistic regressions were used to evaluate the association between the different independent variables and treatment outcomes.\nTwo Stage 3 patients had delayed healing at 1 month after the operation. Complete mucosal healing was achieved in all patients at the third month.

Pervasive screening emphasizes atherosclerotic monitoring with easy access, quick process, and advanced computing. In this work, we introduced five cutting-edge pervasive technologies including imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG), laser Doppler, radio frequency (RF), thermal imaging (TI), optical fiber sensing and piezoelectric sensor. IPPG measures physiological parameters by using video images that record the subtle skin color changes consistent with cardiac-synchronous blood volume changes in subcutaneous arteries and capillaries. Laser Doppler obtained the information on blood flow by analyzing the spectral components of backscattered light from the illuminated tissues' surface. RF is based on Doppler shift caused by the periodic movement of the chest wall induced by respiration and heartbeat. TI measures vital signs by detecting electromagnetic radiation emitted by blood flow. The working principle of optical fiber sensor is to detect the change of light properties caused by the interaction between the measured physiological parameter and the entering light. Piezoelectric sensors are based on the piezoelectric effect of dielectrics.

Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sustained attention in women caring for older adults in Japan.\nThe study was conducted in women aged 18-67\u00a0years old working in care service facilities for older adults in Japan. The sustained attention of participants was measured by the 10-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). SDB was assessed based on the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), which was measured using an ambulatory airflow monitor with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film sensor to monitor the respiratory airflow of nasal and oral breathing. The participants wore the monitor to record the breathing status while asleep at home. The severity of SDB was categorized as follows: normal, RDI\u2009<\u20095 events/h; mild SDB, RDI 5-10 events/h; and moderate-to-severe SDB, RDI\u2009\u2265\u200910 events/h.\nOf 688 women enrolled, medians of age, body mass index (BMI), sleep duration, and prevalence of hypertension tended to be higher with increasing RDI.

The Osia implant is placed subcutaneously under the intact skin behind the ear with the piezoelectric actuator connected to an osseointegrated BI300 implant - a titanium screw used for a 2-stage Baha surgery - on the mastoid. The external processor is magnetically attached to the subcutaneous implant receiver coil. As the Osia has recently been CE certified and is new on the market, with limited patient outcome data for SSD available, the objective of this study was the evaluation of surgical procedure, audiological results, and patient satisfaction for the Osia in SSD patients.\nIn a prospective, monocentric clinical observation study, 6 patients (18 years of age or older) with SSD and bone conduction thresholds pure tone average 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz \u226425 dB HL on the contralateral side were implanted with an Osia. Analysis of clinical outcome data with respect to surgical technique, adverse events, audiological measurement, and subjective benefit for SSD patients was conducted. Audiological measurements performed included hearing thresholds, sound field thresholds, word recognition scores (WRS; in %) in quiet, and speech recognition thresholds in noise (in dB SNR). All tests were performed unaided and aided with the Osia. The subjective benefit with the Osia was determined by using 2 questionnaires; the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and the Bern Benefit in Single-Sided Deafness (BBSSD).\nPreliminary results indicate a straightforward surgical procedure with a low rate of complications and an improvement in speech perception in quiet, listening performance in everyday situations and patient satisfaction. However, in one of 6 subjects, a revision surgery had to be performed.\nProvided that SSD patients are open for CROS hearing, they can benefit from the Osia by reduced head shadow effects and better speech recognition.

{"title": "Ultrasound-responsive nutlin-loaded nanoparticles for combined chemotherapy and piezoelectric treatment of glioblastoma cells.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), also known as grade IV astrocytoma, represents the most aggressive primary brain tumor. The complex genetic heterogeneity, the acquired drug resistance, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limit the efficacy of the current therapies, with effectiveness demonstrated only in a small subset of patients. To overcome these issues, here we propose an anticancer approach based on ultrasound-responsive drug-loaded organic piezoelectric nanoparticles. This anticancer nanoplatform consists of nutlin-3a-loaded ApoE-functionalized P(VDF-TrFE) nanoparticles, that can be remotely activated with ultrasound-based mechanical stimulations to induce drug release and to locally deliver anticancer electric cues. The combination of chemotherapy treatment with chronic piezoelectric stimulation resulted in activation of cell apoptosis and anti-proliferation pathways, induction of cell necrosis, inhibition of cancer migration, and reduction of cell invasiveness in drug-resistant GBM cells. Obtained results pave the way for the use of innovative multifunctional nanomaterials in less invasive and more focused anticancer treatments, able to reduce drug resistance in GBM. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Piezoelectric hybrid lipid-polymeric nanoparticles, efficiently encapsulating a non-genotoxic drug (nutlin-3a) and functionalized with a peptide (ApoE) that enhances their passage through the BBB, are proposed. Upon ultrasound stimulation, nanovectors resulted able to reduce cell migration, actin polymerization, and invasion ability of glioma cells, while fostering apoptotic and necrotic events.

Level of agreement using the Bland-Altman method was higher when 2 OSPW were used for FFR assessment (-0.002 95% CI [-0.033,0.029] vs. 0.026 95% CI [-0.078, 0.130], respectively). The rate of drift was significantly lower with an OSPW compared to a PEPW (4.8% vs. 26.7% respectively, P = 0.02).\nThe optical sensor guidewire showed a high level of readings' agreement after simultaneous usage of 2 optical sensor guidewires. There was also significantly less drift when compared to a piezoelectric guidewire.", "journal": "Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions", "date": "2021-03-30", "authors": ["KevinHaddad", "Brian JPotter", "AlexisMatteau", "JeannotPotvin", "Jean-BernardMasson", "ClaudePilon", "QuanVu-Hung", "Fran\u00e7oisGobeil", "SamerMansour"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carrev.2021.03.011"}

{"title": "Two Polyurethane Adhesives for PVDF Fixation Show Superior Biocompatibility in a Rat Model.", "abstract": "The current standard for open and laparoscopic repair of incisional hernia consist of an abdominal wall augmentation by mesh implantation. However, the ideal fixation method of the prothesis material remains under discussion, due to potential complications of conventional fixation methods such as chronic abdominal pain or intestinal obstruction. As the use of adhesive based mesh fixation is an option of growing interest, the aim of this experimental study was to investigate the strength and biocompatibility of two newly developed polyurethane-based adhesives in comparison to a cyanoacrylatic adhesive, which is currently in clinical use.\nTwo experimental polyurethane/urea-based adhesives (Adhesive-A and Adhesive-B) were compared to a conventional cyanoacrylatic adhesive and an untreated control group. Biomechanical testing was carried out using a pull-out test in uniaxial tensile mode, while biocompatibility assessment was performed in a rat model with 40 Sprague-Dawley rats receiving a subcutaneous implanted PVDF mesh fixed by the corresponding adhesive. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis by a Tissue FAXS system examined the tissue integration of the mesh/adhesive combination and characterized the foreign body reaction.\nBiomechanical testing of the mesh/adhesive combinations showed a minimal strength of 15.08\u2009N without a significant difference between the groups. Cellular penetration into the mesh/adhesive interface was significantly improved after application of polyurethane adhesives and Adhesive-A showed a significantly lower migration of CD68 positive cells to the adhesive sites compared to cyanoacrylate after 7\u2009days.\nThe developed polyurethane-based adhesives are a promising alternative with sufficient adhesive strength and superior short-term biocompatibility to cyanoacrylate.", "journal": "Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research", "date": "2021-02-04", "authors": ["DanielHeise", "YelyzavetaMirlas", "MariusHelmedag", "RomanEickhoff", "AndreasKroh", "AndreasLambertz", "Christian DanielKlink", "Ulf PeterNeumann", "UweKlinge", "ReneTolba"], "doi": "10.1080/08941939.2020.1833261"}

The actuators of the system include the dc motor at the end of the joint and m piezoelectric controllers installed at the flexible link, which is regarded as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. The problem of the infinite number of actuator failures, including the partial loss of the effectiveness and total loss of effectiveness, is solved by the adaptive compensation method. By introducing the relative threshold strategy, the event-triggered control (ETC) scheme is proposed to achieve angle regulation and vibration suppression while reducing the communication burden between the controllers and the actuators. The Lyapunov direct method is utilized to prove that the system is uniformly ultimately bounded and both the angular tracking error and elastic displacement converge to a neighborhood of zero.

In order to chemically immobilize CuFC on the surface of the PVDF hollow-fibre membrane, carboxyl groups were introduced onto the membrane surface (PVDF-COOH) to peptide bond with amine groups from CuFC. The introduction of the carboxyl group onto the surface of the PVDF hollow-fibre membrane was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), while the immobilization of CuFC was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersed spectroscopy, FT-IR, and thermogravimetric analysis. The PVDF-CuFC showed higher Cs adsorption kinetics and adsorption capacity than PVDF-COOH. Moreover, as the initial pH increased, the amount of Cs adsorption by PVDF-CuFC also increased. However, the amount of Cs adsorption at pH 10 was slightly less.

However, information regarding its performance is scarce.\nThe purpose of this in\u00a0vitro study was to evaluate the reliability and repeatability of a newly introduced digital occlusal analysis device (Accura) and to compare it with an established occlusal analyzer (T-scan Novus).\nThe sensor films of both devices were positioned between titanium maxillary and mandibular models that were equilibrated and arbitrarily mounted on a semiadjustable articulator. Compressive force was applied to the upper arm of the articulator with a universal testing machine, increased gradually to 50 N, and then released automatically. The time and force measurements from the universal testing machine and the tested devices were recorded by operating software programs. Five articulating film sensors of each device were tested 3 times each by 2 examiners and were repeated on consecutive days, totaling 60 trials per device. Reliability was defined as an agreement between the loaded force and measured force. Repeatability was defined as an agreement between repeated measurements of the Accura and T-scan Novus. Intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated for the statistical analysis (\u03b1=.05).\nThe calculated intraclass correlation coefficient of the Accura and the universal testing machine was 0.952. The intraclass correlation coefficient of the T-scan Novus and the universal testing machine was 0.963. Intraclass correlation coefficients that were calculated to compare the data acquired from different days were 0.938 for the Accura and 0.911 for the T-scan Novus.\nThe experimental results indicated that the reliability of both the Accura and T-scan Novus was excellent for measuring occlusal forces.
