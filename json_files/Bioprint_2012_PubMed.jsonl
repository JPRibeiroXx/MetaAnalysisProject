Based on computed tomography scans, polygon skulls were created. Following that virtual treatment plans entailing free microvascular transfer of fibula flaps using patient-specific reconstruction plates, mesh, and cutting guides were designed. The design was based on the specification of a Compact UniLOCK 2.4 Large (Synthes(\u00ae), Switzerland). The obtained polygon plates were bent virtually round the reconstructed mandibles. Next, the resections of the mandibles were planned virtually. A cutting guide was outlined to facilitate resection, as well as plates and titanium mesh for insertion of bone or bone substitutes. Polygon plates and meshes were converted to stereolithography format and used in the software Magics for preparation of input files for the successive step, additive manufacturing. EBM was used to manufacture the customized implants in a biocompatible titanium grade, Ti6Al4V ELI. The implants and the cutting guide were cleaned and sterilized, then transferred to the operating theater, and applied during surgery. Commercially available software programs are sufficient in order to virtually plan for production of patient-specific implants. Furthermore, EBM-produced implants are fully usable under clinical conditions in reconstruction of acquired defects in the mandible. A good compliance between the treatment plan and the fit was demonstrated during operation. Within the constraints of this article, the authors describe a workflow for production of patient-specific implants, using EBM manufacturing. Titanium cutting guides, reconstruction plates for fixation of microvascular transfer of osteomyocutaneous bone grafts, and mesh to replace resected bone that can function as a carrier for bone or bone substitutes were designed and tested during reconstructive maxillofacial surgery. A clinically fit, well within the requirements for what is needed and obtained using traditional free hand bending of commercially available devices, or even higher precision, was demonstrated in ablative surgery in four patients.", "journal": "Craniomaxillofacial trauma & reconstruction", "date": "2013-09-03", "authors": ["PerD\u00e9rand", "Lars-ErikR\u00e4nnar", "Jan-MHirsch"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0032-1313357"}
{"title": "Patterned three-dimensional encapsulation of embryonic stem cells using dielectrophoresis and stereolithography.", "abstract": "Controlling the assembly of cells in three dimensions is very important for engineering functional tissues, drug screening, probing cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions, and studying the emergent behavior of cellular systems. Although the current methods of cell encapsulation in hydrogels can distribute them in three dimensions, these methods typically lack spatial control of multi-cellular organization and do not allow for the possibility of cell-cell contacts as seen for the native tissue. Here, we report the integration of dielectrophoresis (DEP) with stereolithography (SL) apparatus for the spatial patterning of cells on custom made gold micro-electrodes. Afterwards, they are encapsulated in poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels of different stiffnesses. This technique can mimic the in vivo microscale tissue architecture, where the cells have a high degree of three dimensional (3D) spatial control. As a proof of concept, we show the patterning and encapsulation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and C2C12 skeletal muscle myoblasts. mESCs show high viability in both the DEP (91.79% \u00b1 1.4%) and the no DEP (94.27% \u00b1 0.5%) hydrogel samples. Furthermore, we also show the patterning of mouse embryoid bodies (mEBs) and C2C12 spheroids in the hydrogels, and verify their viability. This robust and flexible in vitro platform can enable various applications in stem cell differentiation and tissue engineering by mimicking elements of the native 3D in vivo cellular micro-environment.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2013-03-07", "authors": ["PiyushBajaj", "DanielMarchwiany", "CarlosDuarte", "RashidBashir"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201200318"}

A mPEG-PCL-mPEG triblock copolymer was synthesized as a biopolymer material. Biocomposite material was composed of synthesized biopolymer and hydroxyapatite (HA) with a mean diameter of 100 \u03bcm. The weight ratio of HA added to the synthesized biopolymer was 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1. The experimental results show that the maximum average compressive strength of biocomposite scaffolds, made of weight ratio 0.5, with mean pore size of 410 \u03bcm (porosity 81%) is 18.38 MPa which is two times stronger than that of biopolymer scaffolds. Osteoblast cells, MC3T3-E1, were seeded on both types of fabricated scaffolds to validate the biocompatibility using methylthianzol tetrazolium (MTT) assay and cell morphology observation. After 28 days of in vitro culturing, the seeded osteoblasts were well distributed in the interior of both types of scaffolds. Furthermore, MTT experimental results show that the cell viability of the biocomposite scaffold is higher than that of the biopolymer scaffold. This indicates that adding HA into synthesized biopolymer can enhance compressive strength and the proliferation of the osteoblast cell.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

This study aimed to produce a bioactive poly (l-lactide-co-glycolide)-tricalcium phosphate (PLGA-TCP)-based porous scaffold incorporating the osteopromotive phytomolecule icaritin, using a fine spinning technology. Both the structure and the composition of icaritin-releasing PLGA-TCP-based scaffolds were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The porosity was quantified by both water absorption and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The mechanical properties were evaluated using a compression test. In vitro release of icaritin from the PLGA-TCP scaffold was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the composite scaffold were evaluated. Both an in vitro cytotoxicity test and an in vivo test via muscular implantation were conducted to confirm the scaffold's biocompatibility. The results showed that the PLGA-TCP-icaritin composite scaffold was porous, with interconnected macro- (about 480\u2009\u00b5m) and micropores (2-15\u2009\u00b5m). The mechanical properties of the PLGA-TCP-icaritin scaffold were comparable with those of the pure PLGA-TCP scaffold, yet was spinning direction-dependent. Icaritin content was detected in the medium and increased with time. The PLGA-TCP-icaritin scaffold facilitated the attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In vitro cytotoxicity test and in vivo intramuscular implantation showed that the composite scaffold had no toxicity with good biocompatibility. In conclusion, an osteopromotive phytomolecule, icaritin, was successfully incorporated into PLGA-TCP to form an innovative porous composite scaffold with sustained release of osteopromotive icaritin, and this scaffold had good biocompatibility and osteopromotion, suggesting its potential for orthopaedic applications.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-12-21", "authors": ["Xin-HuiXie", "Xin-LuanWang", "GeZhang", "Yi-XinHe", "YangLeng", "Ting-TingTang", "XiaohuaPan", "LingQin"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1679"}

Based on the rationale that physical cues on the surface of culture substrates and implants, such as surface roughness, have proven to alter cell behaviour, we used electrospinning to fabricate fibrous three-dimensional scaffolds made of a poly (ethylene oxide terephthalate)/poly (butylene terephthalate) copolymer to mimic the physical microenvironment of extracellular matrix and applied radio-frequency oxygen plasma treatment to create nanoscale roughness. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed a fibre diameter of 5.49 \u00b1 0.96\u00a0\u00b5m for as-spun meshes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements determined an exponential increase of surface roughness with plasma treatment time. An increase in hydrophilicity after plasma treatment was observed, which was associated with higher oxygen content in plasma treated scaffolds compared to untreated ones. A more pronounced adsorption of bovine serum albumin occurred on scaffolds treated with plasma for 15 and 30\u00a0min compared to untreated fibres. Clinically relevant human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were cultured on untreated, 15 and 30\u00a0min treated scaffolds. SEM analysis confirmed cell attachment and a pronounced spindle-like morphology on all scaffolds. No significant differences were observed between different scaffolds regarding the amount of DNA, metabolic activity and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after 7\u00a0days of culture. The amount of ALP positive cells increased between 7 and 21\u00a0days of culture on both untreated and 30\u00a0min treated meshes. In addition, ALP staining of cells on plasma treated meshes appeared more pronounced than on untreated meshes after 21\u00a0days of culture. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed significant upregulation of bone sialoprotein and osteonectin expression on oxygen plasma treated fibres compared to untreated fibres in basic culture medium after 7\u00a0days of culture, while no differences were observed in the expression of other osteogenic markers. At 21\u00a0days, no osteocalcin protein could be detected by ELISA at any of the substrates.

The scaffold structure contains well-ordered nano-channels, micropores as well as controllable macropores beneficial for bone tissue engineering applications and drug delivery. The structural architecture of the scaffolds has been optimized by efficient designing of the plotting coordination. The effects of MBG on mechanical strength, apatite mineralization, cytocompatibility and drug delivery properties of the composite scaffolds have been systematically studied. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometry were used to characterize composition and microstructure of the composite scaffolds. The MBG/alginate pastes showed good processability in the 3D plotting process, in which stable MBG/alginate composite scaffolds with controllable architecture can be prepared. The incorporation of MBG particles significantly improved the mechanical properties and apatite-mineralization ability of alginate scaffolds as well as enhanced the attachment and alkaline phosphatase activity of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells cultivated onto the scaffolds. Dexamethasone, used as a model drug, can be efficiently loaded in MBG particles and then incorporated into alginate scaffolds resulting in a more sustained release as a function of the MBG content.

{"title": "Micro 3D printing using a digital projector and its application in the study of soft materials mechanics.", "abstract": "Buckling is a classical topic in mechanics. While buckling has long been studied as one of the major structural failure modes(1), it has recently drawn new attention as a unique mechanism for pattern transformation. Nature is full of such examples where a wealth of exotic patterns are formed through mechanical instability(2-5). Inspired by this elegant mechanism, many studies have demonstrated creation and transformation of patterns using soft materials such as elastomers and hydrogels(6-11). Swelling gels are of particular interest because they can spontaneously trigger mechanical instability to create various patterns without the need of external force(6-10). Recently, we have reported demonstration of full control over buckling pattern of micro-scaled tubular gels using projection micro-stereolithography (P\u03bcSL), a three-dimensional (3D) manufacturing technology capable of rapidly converting computer generated 3D models into physical objects at high resolution(12,13). Here we present a simple method to build up a simplified P\u03bcSL system using a commercially available digital data projector to study swelling-induced buckling instability for controlled pattern transformation. A simple desktop 3D printer is built using an off-the-shelf digital data projector and simple optical components such as a convex lens and a mirror(14). Cross-sectional images extracted from a 3D solid model is projected on the photosensitive resin surface in sequence, polymerizing liquid resin into a desired 3D solid structure in a layer-by-layer fashion. Even with this simple configuration and easy process, arbitrary 3D objects can be readily fabricated with sub-100 \u03bcm resolution. This desktop 3D printer holds potential in the study of soft material mechanics by offering a great opportunity to explore various 3D geometries. We use this system to fabricate tubular shaped hydrogel structure with different dimensions. Fixed on the bottom to the substrate, the tubular gel develops inhomogeneous stress during swelling, which gives rise to buckling instability. Various wavy patterns appear along the circumference of the tube when the gel structures undergo buckling. Experiment shows that circumferential buckling of desired mode can be created in a controlled manner. Pattern transformation of three-dimensionally structured tubular gels has significant implication not only in mechanics and material science, but also in many other emerging fields such as tunable matamaterials.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["HowonLee", "Nicholas XFang"], "doi": "10.3791/4457"}

Because of the lack of significant immunogenicity and the ability of the amniotic fluid-derived stem (AFS) cells to modulate the inflammatory response, we investigated whether they could augment wound healing in a mouse model of skin regeneration. We used bioprinting technology to treat full-thickness skin wounds in nu/nu mice. AFS cells and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were resuspended in fibrin-collagen gel and \"printed\" over the wound site. At days 0, 7, and 14, AFS cell- and MSC-driven wound closure and re-epithelialization were significantly greater than closure and re-epithelialization in wounds treated by fibrin-collagen gel only. Histological examination showed increased microvessel density and capillary diameters in the AFS cell-treated wounds compared with the MSC-treated wounds, whereas the skin treated only with gel showed the lowest amount of microvessels. However, tracking of fluorescently labeled AFS cells and MSCs revealed that the cells remained transiently and did not permanently integrate in the tissue. These observations suggest that the increased wound closure rates and angiogenesis may be due to delivery of secreted trophic factors, rather than direct cell-cell interactions. Accordingly, we performed proteomic analysis, which showed that AFS cells secreted a number of growth factors at concentrations higher than those of MSCs. In parallel, we showed that AFS cell-conditioned media induced endothelial cell migration in vitro.

We present a systematic investigation of regulating mouse pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell behavior on biodegradable polymer substrates with distinct mechanical properties and concentric microgrooves. The precursors for fabricating substrates used here were two poly(\u03f5-caprolactone) triacrylates (PCLTAs) synthesized from poly(\u03f5-caprolactone) triols with molecular weights of \u223c7000 and \u223c10000 g mol(-1) . These two PCLTAs were photo-crosslinked into PCL networks with distinct thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties at physiological temperature because of their different crystallinities and melting temperatures. Microgrooved substrates with four groove widths of 7.5, 16.1, 44.2, and 91.2 \u03bcm and three groove depths of 0.2, 1, and 10 \u03bcm were prepared through replica molding, i.e., photo-crosslinking PCLTA on micro-fabricated silicon wafers with pre-designed concentric groove patterns. MC3T3-E1 cell attachment and proliferation could be better supported by the stiffer substrates while not significantly influenced by the microgrooves. Microgroove dimensions could regulate MC3T3-E1 cell alignment, nuclear shape and distribution, mineralization, and gene expression. Among the microgrooves with a fixed depth of 10 \u03bcm, the smallest width of 7.5 \u03bcm could align and elongate the cytoskeleton and nuclei most efficiently. Strikingly, higher mineral deposition and upregulation of osteocalcin gene expression were found in the narrower microgrooves when the groove depth was 10 \u03bcm.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["KanWang", "LeiCai", "LiZhang", "JingyanDong", "ShanfengWang"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201200030"}
{"title": "A bio-inspired platform to modulate myogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells through focal adhesion regulation.", "abstract": "The use of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in cardiac-tissue engineering has gained widespread attention and many reports have shown that matrix compliance, micro/nano-patterns could be some of the important biophysical cues that drive hMSCs differentiation. Regardless of the type of biophysical induction cues, cells mainly explore their environment via focal adhesion (FA) and FA plays an important role in many cellular behaviours. Therefore, it is hypothesized that FA modulation through materials manipulation could be an important cue for modulation that would result in the stem cell lineage commitment. In this work, the FA of hMSCs is modulated by a novel microcontact printing method using polyvinyl alcohol as a trans-print media which can successfully print proteins on soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The FA is successfully modified into dense FA and elongated FA by micropatterning square and rectangular patterns on 12.6 kPa PDMS respectively. Additionally, the combined effects of stiffness of PDMS substrates (hard (308 kPa), intermediate (12.6 kPa)) and FA patterning on hMSCs differentiation are studied. The results indicate that dense FA does not induce myogenesis while elongated FA can promote cytoskeleton alignment and further myogenesis on PDMS with intermediate stiffness of 12.6 kPa. However, on stiff substrate (308 kPa), with or without patterns, the cytoskeleton alignment and myogenesis are not obvious. This demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to induce the differentiation of hMSCs by regulating the FA using a materials platform even in the absence of any biochemical factors. It also shows that there is a synergistic effect between FA regulation and matrix stiffness that results in a more specific and higher up-regulated myogenesis.

Two simple methods, hanging drop (HD) and conical tube (CT) were utilized to prepare cell aggregates. The size and viability of the aggregates obtained at different initial cell densities and pre-culture duration were compared. The proliferative ability of the cell aggregates and their ability to spread in culture plates were also investigated. In both methods, the optimum average size of the aggregates was less than 500 microm. CT aggregates were smaller than HD aggregates. 5,000 cells per drop HD aggregates showed a marked ability to attach and spread on the culture surface. The proliferative ability reduced when the initial cell density was increased.

{"title": "Hybrid printing of mechanically and biologically improved constructs for cartilage tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is an emerging technique used to fabricate viable, 3D tissue constructs through the precise deposition of cells and hydrogels in a layer-by-layer fashion. Despite the ability to mimic the native properties of tissue, printed 3D constructs that are composed of naturally-derived biomaterials still lack structural integrity and adequate mechanical properties for use in vivo, thus limiting their development for use in load-bearing tissue engineering applications, such as cartilage. Fabrication of viable constructs using a novel multi-head deposition system provides the ability to combine synthetic polymers, which have higher mechanical strength than natural materials, with the favorable environment for cell growth provided by traditional naturally-derived hydrogels. However, the complexity and high cost associated with constructing the required robotic system hamper the widespread application of this approach. Moreover, the scaffolds fabricated by these robotic systems often lack flexibility, which further restrict their applications. To address these limitations, advanced fabrication techniques are necessary to generate complex constructs with controlled architectures and adequate mechanical properties. In this study, we describe the construction of a hybrid inkjet printing/electrospinning system that can be used to fabricate viable tissues for cartilage tissue engineering applications. Electrospinning of polycaprolactone fibers was alternated with inkjet printing of rabbit elastic chondrocytes suspended in a fibrin-collagen hydrogel in order to fabricate a five-layer tissue construct of 1\u00a0mm thickness. The chondrocytes survived within the printed hybrid construct with more than 80% viability one week after printing. In addition, the cells proliferated and maintained their basic biological properties within the printed layered constructs. Furthermore, the fabricated constructs formed cartilage-like tissues both in vitro and in vivo as evidenced by the deposition of type II collagen and glycosaminoglycans. Moreover, the printed hybrid scaffolds demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties compared to printed alginate or fibrin-collagen gels alone.

An important aspect of polymer bridged gels that makes them excellent candidates for these applications is the precise control it affords for control of rheological properties. Recent studies have shown that adhesion between bridged surfaces increases with time as the number of polymer bridges formed grows. However, the consequences of the dynamics of these processes toward bulk rheological properties have not been studied. Here we investigate the link between the dynamics of polymer bridging and disruption and bulk rheology in dense colloidal silica particle suspensions flocculated by polyethylene oxide (PEO). Microscale pull-off force measurements using atomic force microscope (AFM) show that upon repeated disruption and establishment of bridged contact, the adhesion between the surfaces is reduced. During contact disruption, the polymer chains bridging the two surfaces are stretched leading to chain scission. On the re-establishment of contact, these fragmented polymer chains are unable to fully re-establish the adhesion. Macroscale measurements using oscillatory rheology show that this reduced adhesion results in reduction of both the storage modulus and the yield stress. If the slurry is subjected to high shear for long periods, polymer chain scission is amplified, and the fragmented polymer chains are unable to bridge the particles again, resulting in free-flowing slurries.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2012-11-17", "authors": ["Prasad SBhosale", "John CBerg"], "doi": "10.1021/la3039297"}

In the computer aided virtual planning was defined that, for the treatment, the patient needed to wear a series of 7 removable orthodontic appliances (ROA) over a duration of 21 weeks, with one appliance for every 3 weeks. A non-contact reverse engineering (RE) structured-light 3D scanner was used to create the 3D STL model of the impression of the patient's mouth.

FEM simulations showed a more uniform stress distribution for CNC-ROA than 3DP-ROA.\nIn this research, 6 different case studies and CAD-FEM simulations showed that, to fabricate an efficient clear and removable orthodontic aligner, it is necessary to consider a compromise of several factors.

Radiographic examination revealed a large radiolucent area associated with an invaginated right maxillary central incisor, which was found to contain a vital pulp. The affected tooth was strategic in the dental arch. Conventional periapical radiographs provided only partial information about the invagination and its relationship with the main root canal and with the periapical tissues. A limited-volume CBCT scan of the maxilla did not show evidence of communication between the infected invagination and the pulp in the main root canal, which could explain the pulp vitality. A novel method was adopted to allow for instrumentation, disinfection and filling of the invagination, without compromising the vitality of the pulp in the complex root canal system. The CBCT data were used to produce precise 3D plastic models of the tooth. These models facilitated the treatment planning process and the trial of treatment approaches. This approach allowed the vitality of the pulp to be maintained in the complex root canal space of the main root canal whilst enabling the healing of the periapical tissues.\nEven when extensive periapical pathosis is associated with a tooth with type III dens invaginatus, pulp sensibility tests should be performed. CBCT is a diagnostic tool that may allow for the management of such teeth with complex anatomy. 3D printed plastic models may be a valuable aid in the process of assessing and planning effective treatment modalities and practicing them ex vivo before actually performing the clinical procedure.

{"title": "Cartilage regeneration using zonal chondrocyte subpopulations: a promising approach or an overcomplicated strategy?", "abstract": "Cartilage defects heal imperfectly and osteoarthritic changes develop frequently as a result. Although the existence of specific behaviours of chondrocytes derived from various depth-related zones in vitro has been known for over 20\u2009years, only a relatively small body of in vitro studies has been performed with zonal chondrocytes and current clinical treatment strategies do not reflect these native depth-dependent (zonal) differences. This is surprising since mimicking the zonal organization of articular cartilage in neo-tissue by the use of zonal chondrocyte subpopulations could enhance the functionality of the graft. Although some research groups including our own have made considerable progress in tailoring culture conditions using specific growth factors and biomechanical loading protocols, we conclude that an optimal regime has not yet been determined. Other unmet challenges include the lack of specific zonal cell sorting protocols and limited amounts of cells harvested per zone. As a result, the engineering of functional tissue has not yet been realized and no long-term in vivo studies using zonal chondrocytes have been described.

{"title": "Selective cell recruitment and spatially controlled cell attachment on instructive chitosan surfaces functionalized with antibodies.", "abstract": "Bioactive constructs to guide cellular mobilization and function have been proposed as an approach for a new generation of biomaterials in functional tissue engineering. Adult mesenchymal stem cells have been widely used as a source for cell based therapeutic strategies, namely tissue engineering. This is a heterogeneous cell population containing many subpopulations with distinct regenerative capacity. Thus, one of the issues for the effective clinical use of stem cells in tissue engineering is the isolation of a highly purified, expandable specific subpopulation of stem cells. Antibody functionalized biomaterials could be promising candidates to isolate and recruit specific cell types. Here we propose a new concept of instructive biomaterials that are able to recruit and purify specific cell types from a mixed cell population. This biomimetic concept uses a target-specific chitosan substrate to capture specific adipose derived stem cells. Specific antibodies were covalently immobilized onto chitosan membranes using bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3). Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to monitor antibody immobilization/adsorption onto the chitosan films.

Essential to its ability to adhere to vertical surfaces is the secretion of a nanocomposite adhesive containing spherical nanoparticles, 60-85 nm in diameter, produced exclusively by root hairs present on adventitious roots. These organic nanoparticles have shown promise in biomedical and cosmetic applications, and represent a safer alternative to metal oxide nanoparticles currently available.\nIt was discovered that the maximum adventitious root production was achieved by a 4 h application of 1 mg/ml indole-3 butyric acid (IBA) to juvenile English ivy shoot segments cultured in custom vessels. After incubation of the shoots under continuous light at 83 \u03bcmol/m2 s at 20\u00b0C for 2 weeks, the adventitious roots were harvested from the culture system and it was possible to isolate 90 mg of dry weight nanoparticles per 12 g of roots. The nanoparticle morphology was characterized by atomic force microscopy, and found to be similar to previous studies.\nAn enhanced system for the production of English ivy adventitious roots and their nanoparticles by modifying GA7 Magenta boxes and identifying the optimal concentration of IBA for adventitious root growth was developed. This system is the first such platform for growing and harvesting organic nanoparticles from plants, and represents an important step in the development of plant-based nanomanufacturing.

For that, 38 runners (19 pairings) were recruited. The experimental conditions were: personalised and control. The personalised condition consisted of trainers fitted with personalised glove fit insoles manufactured using AM and using foot scans to match the plantar geometry of the feet. The control condition consisted of the same trainers fitted with insoles also manufactured using AM but using scans of the original insole shape. Participants were allocated to one of the experimental conditions and wore the trainers for 3 months. Over this period they attended three laboratory sessions (at months 0, 1.5 and 3) and completed an Activity Diary after each training session. The footwear was evaluated in terms of discomfort and biomechanics. Lower discomfort ratings were found in the heel area (P \u2264 0.05) and for overall fit (P \u2264 0.05), with the personalised insole. However, discomfort was reported under the arch region for both conditions.

In this paper, a piezoelectric inkjet head constructed with a glass capillary that enabled viewing of the nozzle section was developed, the movement of cells ejected from the nozzle tip was analyzed, and a method for stably ejecting cells was verified. A pull-push ejection method was compared with a push-pull ejection method regarding the voltage waveform applied to the piezoelectric element of the head. The push-pull method was found to be more suitable for stable ejection. Further, ejection of one cell per droplet was realized by detecting the position of the cell in the nozzle section and utilizing these position data. Thus, a method for more precise patterning of viable cells at desired position and number was established.

Primary rat hepatocyte aggregates around 100 \u00b5m in diameter coated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells were spontaneously and quickly formed after 12 h of incubation, thanks to the continuous supply of oxygen by diffusion through the PDMS honeycomb microwell device. Then, the recovered endothelialized rat hepatocyte aggregates were mixed with biodegradable poly-l-lactic acid fibres in suspension and packed into a PDMS-based bioreactor. Perfusion culture of 7 days was successfully achieved with more than 73.8% cells retained in the bioreactor. As expected, the fibres acted as spacers between aggregates, which was evidenced from the enhanced albumin production and more spherical morphology compared with fibre-free packing.

Through a plastic surface with controlled mechanical properties such as stiffness, one can change the orientation and migration of cells in a particular direction, thereby determining cell behaviors. In this study, we demonstrate a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold-based hot embossing technique for rapid, simple and low-cost replication of polystyrene (PS) surfaces having micropatterns. The PDMS mold was fabricated by UV-photolithography followed by PDMS casting; the elastomeric properties of PDMS enabled us to obtain conformal contact of the PDMS mold to a PS surface and to create high transcription quality of micropatterns on the PS surface. Two different types of circular micropillar and microwell arrays were successfully replicated on the PS surfaces based on the suggested technique. The micropatterns were designed to have various diameters (2-150 \u00b5m), spacings (2-160 \u00b5m) and heights (1.4, 2.4, 8.2 and 14.9 \u00b5m), so as to generate the gradient of physical properties on the surface. Experimental parametric studies indicated that (1) the embossing temperature became a critical processing parameter as the aspect ratio of micropattern increased and (2) the PDMS mold-based hot embossing could successfully replicate micropatterns, even having an aspect ratio of 2.7 for micropattern diameter of 6 \u00b5m, with an optimal processing condition (embossing pressure and temperature of 0.4 MPa and 130 \u00b0C, respectively) in this study. We carried out cell experiments with adipose-derived stem cells on the replicated PS surface with the height of 1.4 \u00b5m to investigate cellular behaviors in response to the micropattern array with gradient size. Cellular experiment results showed that the micropillar-arrayed surface improved cell proliferation as compared with the microwell-arrayed surface.

Currently available manufacturing technology, that is, additive manufacturing is essentially applied to fabricate the scaffold according to the predefined computer aided design (CAD) model. To develop scaffold CAD libraries, the polyhedrons could be used in the scaffold libraries development. In this present study, one hundred and nineteen polyhedron models were evaluated according to the established criteria. The proposed criteria included considerations on geometry, manufacturing feasibility, and mechanical strength of these polyhedrons. CAD and finite element (FE) method were employed as tools in evaluation. The result of evaluation revealed that the close-cellular scaffold included truncated octahedron, rhombicuboctahedron, and rhombitruncated cuboctahedron. In addition, the suitable polyhedrons for using as open-cellular scaffold libraries included hexahedron, truncated octahedron, truncated hexahedron, cuboctahedron, rhombicuboctahedron, and rhombitruncated cuboctahedron. However, not all pore size to beam thickness ratios (PO:BT) were good for making the open-cellular scaffold. The PO:BT ratio of each library, generating the enclosed pore inside the scaffold, was excluded to avoid the impossibility of material removal after the fabrication. The close-cellular libraries presented the constant porosity which is irrespective to the different pore sizes. The relationship between PO:BT ratio and porosity of open-cellular scaffold libraries was displayed in the form of Logistic Power function. The possibility of merging two different types of libraries to produce the composite structure was geometrically evaluated in terms of the intersection index and was mechanically evaluated by means of FE analysis to observe the stress level.

Tissue engineered living aortic valve conduits have potential for remodeling, regeneration, and growth, but fabricating natural anatomical complexity with cellular heterogeneity remain challenging. In the current study, we implement 3D bioprinting to fabricate living alginate/gelatin hydrogel valve conduits with anatomical architecture and direct incorporation of dual cell types in a regionally constrained manner. Encapsulated aortic root sinus smooth muscle cells (SMC) and aortic valve leaflet interstitial cells (VIC) were viable within alginate/gelatin hydrogel discs over 7 days in culture. Acellular 3D printed hydrogels exhibited reduced modulus, ultimate strength, and peak strain reducing slightly over 7-day culture, while the tensile biomechanics of cell-laden hydrogels were maintained. Aortic valve conduits were successfully bioprinted with direct encapsulation of SMC in the valve root and VIC in the leaflets. Both cell types were viable (81.4 \u00b1 3.4% for SMC and 83.2 \u00b1 4.0% for VIC) within 3D printed tissues. Encapsulated SMC expressed elevated alpha-smooth muscle actin, while VIC expressed elevated vimentin. These results demonstrate that anatomically complex, heterogeneously encapsulated aortic valve hydrogel conduits can be fabricated with 3D bioprinting.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The scaffolds have crushing strengths of 41 \u00b1 14 and 17 \u00b1 5 Mpa, respectively. Using a method of assembling discrete slices of scaffold, we are able to study cell behaviour within a scaffold by disassembly. Both scaffold structures were seeded with primary human osteoblasts and these penetrate, adhere, spread and proliferate on the scaffold structure. The larger channel diameter scaffold shows a greater cell population (despite its smaller surface area) and more pronounced production of ECM components (collagen and mineralization) with increased time in culture.

{"title": "Synthesis and interfacing of biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles through the ferroxidase activity of Helicobacter Pylori ferritin.", "abstract": "Ferritin is an iron storage protein that is often used to coat metallic nanoparticles, such as iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). However, the synthesis and biocompatibility of ferritin-coated IONPs remain unclear. Therefore, this study reports the synthesis of a ferritin gene cloned and expressed from Helicobacter pylori (HPFn). The ferroxidase activity of the synthase HPFn was used for the de novo synthesis of HPFn-coated IONPs under mild conditions. Gel filtration chromatography and transmission electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that the core-shell structure of both the 5.0 nm IONP nanocore and the 12.4 nm HPFn shell were correctly assembled. The cellular uptake of mouse macrophage cells (RAW 264.7 cells) has shown that only a few HPFn-coated IONPs (3%) were taken up after 24 h of incubation. This study compares the biocompatibility of HPFn-coated IONPs, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) and ferric salt (ferric ammonium citrate) in respect to cell growth inhibition, reactive oxygen species generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 release. Assessment results showed that the responses elicited by HPFn-coated IONPs were similar to those elicited by SPIO treatment but milder than those elicited by ferric salt treatment. This accounts for the notion that ferritin-coated IONPs are biocompatible iron agents. These findings show that the ferroxidase activity of ferritin can be used to synthesize biocompatible IONPs. The favorable properties of HPFn-coated IONPs suggest that they can be used as a non-macrophage contrast agent through further surface conjugation.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2012-09-28", "authors": ["I-LiangLee", "Pei-ShanLi", "Wei-LinYu", "Hsin-HsinShen"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/4/4/045001"}

These efforts have required enormous doses of BMP-2 and are not sufficiently refined to facilitate the detail-oriented repair required for intricate craniofacial structures. We have previously shown that inkjet-based bioprinting technologies allow for precisely customized low-dose protein patterns to induce spatially regulated osteogenesis. Here, we investigate the importance of direct contact between bioprinted BMP-2 and the dura mater (a source of osteoprogenitors) in mediating calvarial healing.\nFive-millimeter osseous defects were trephinated in mouse parietal bones (N=8). Circular acellular dermal matrix (ADM) implants were prepared such that 1 semicircle of 1 face per implant was printed with BMP-2 bio-ink. These implants were then placed ink-toward (N=3) or ink-away (N=5) from the underlying dura mater. After 4 weeks, osteogenesis was assessed in each of the 4 possible positions (BMP-2-printed area toward dura, BMP-2-printed area away from dura, unprinted area toward dura, and unprinted area away from dura) by faxitron.\nThe BMP-2-printed portion of the ADM generated bone covering an average of 66.5% of its surface area when it was face-down (printed surface directly abutting dura mater). By comparison, the BMP-2-printed portion of the ADM generated bone covering an average of only 21.3% of its surface area when it was face-up (printed surface away from dura). Similarly, the unprinted portion of the ADM generated an average of only 18.6% osseous coverage when face-down and 18.4% when face-up.\nWe have previously shown that inkjet-based bioprinting has the potential to significantly enhance the role of regenerative therapies in craniofacial surgery. This technology affords the precise control of osteogenesis necessary to reconstruct this region's intricate anatomical architecture. In the present study, we demonstrate that direct apposition of BMP-2-printed ADM to a source of osteoprogenitor cells (in this case dura mater) is necessary for bio-ink-directed osteogenesis to occur.

However, the development of architectonic tags to induce the self-assembling of functionalized monomers has been essentially neglected. We have examined here the nanoscale architectonic capabilities of arginine-rich cationic peptides, that when displayed on His-tagged proteins, promote their self-assembling as monodisperse, protein-only nanoparticles. The scrutiny of the cross-molecular interactivity cooperatively conferred by poly-arginines and poly-histidines has identified regulatable electrostatic interactions between building blocks that can also be engineered to encapsulate cargo DNA.

Limitations of current treatments necessitate the development of new methods that can be applied quicker, result in faster wound regeneration, and yield skin that is cosmetically similar to undamaged skin. The development of new hydrogel biomaterials and bioprinting deposition technologies has provided a platform to address this need. Herein we evaluated characteristics of twelve hydrogels to determine their suitability for bioprinting applications. We chose hydrogels that are either commercially available, or are commonly used for research purposes. We evaluated specific hydrogel properties relevant to bioprinting applications, specifically; gelation time, swelling or contraction, stability, biocompatibility and printability. Further, we described regulatory, commercial and financial aspects of each of the hydrogels. While many of the hydrogels screened may exhibit characteristics suitable for other applications, UV-crosslinked Extracel, a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel, had many of the desired properties for our bioprinting application.

Optimization of process variables (amplitude, normal load and velocity) is done to minimize voids along the bonded interfaces. This work pertains to the evaluation of bonds in UAM builds through ultrasonic testing of a build's elastic constants. Results from ultrasonic testing on UAM parts indicate orthotropic material symmetry and a reduction of up to 48% in elastic constant values compared to a control sample. The reduction in elastic constant values is attributed to interfacial voids. In addition, the elastic constants in the plane of the Al foils have nearly the same value, while the constants normal to the foil direction have much different values.

In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a nondestructive technique that captures the physical changes of solid dosage forms during dissolution. An example that highlights this application is in the dissolution of modified-release tablet studies. As the tablet dissolves, API disperses in a hydrogel matrix within the tablet, and swelling of the hydrogel layer eventually leads to release of API over time. To achieve optimum signal-to-noise ratios, the tablet should be placed in the most homogeneous region of the magnet and remain there throughout the dissolution experiment. Moreover, the tablet holder must maintain the tablet position without interfering with the natural dissolution process, such as by crushing the softened tablet. This can be difficult because the size, shape, and rigidity of the tablet change during dissolution.

{"title": "Self assembled temperature responsive surfaces for generation of cell patches for bone tissue engineering.", "abstract": "One of the major challenges in the fabrication of tissue engineered scaffolds is the ability of the scaffold to biologically mimic autograft-like tissues. One of the alternate approaches to achieve this is by the application of cell seeded scaffolds with optimal porosity and mechanical properties. However, the current approaches for seeding cells on scaffolds are not optimal in terms of seeding efficiencies, cell penetration into the scaffold and more importantly uniform distribution of cells on the scaffold. Also, recent developments in scaffold geometries to enhance surface areas, pore sizes and porosities tend to further complicate the scenario. Cell sheet-based approaches for cell seeding have demonstrated a successful approach to generate scaffold-free tissue engineering approaches. However, the method of generating the temperature responsive surface is quite challenging and requires carcinogenic reagents and gamma rays. Therefore, here, we have developed temperature responsive substrates by layer-by-layer self assembly of smart polymers. Multilayer thin films prepared from tannic acid and poly N-isopropylacrylamide were fabricated based on their electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Cell attachment and proliferation studies on these thin films showed uniform cell attachment on the substrate, matching tissue culture plates. Also, the cells could be harvested as cell patches and sheets from the scaffolds, by reducing the temperature for a short period of time, and seeded onto porous scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. An enhanced cell seeding efficiency on scaffolds was observed using the cell patch-based technique as compared to seeding cells in suspension. Owing to the already pre-existent cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, the cell patch showed the ability to reattach rapidly onto scaffolds and showed enhanced ability to proliferate and differentiate into a bone-like matrix.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2012-08-24", "authors": ["Chandra MValmikinathan", "WeiChang", "JiahuaXu", "XiaojunYu"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/4/3/035006"}

To investigate the mechanical behavior of the bellows structure, finite element method (FEM) analysis in terms of longitudinal tension/compression, bending and radial compression was conducted. The bellows structure was then compared with the cylinder structure generally used for artificial tracheal grafts. The FEM analysis showed that the bellows had outstanding flexibility in longitudinal tension/compression and bending. Moreover, the bellows kept the lumen open without severe luminal deformation in comparison with the cylinder structure. A three-dimensional artificial tracheal graft with a bellows design was fabricated using indirect solid freeform fabrication technology, and the actual mechanical test was conducted to investigate the actual mechanical behavior of the bellows graft. The fabricated bellows graft was then applied to segmental tracheal reconstruction in a rabbit model to assess its applicability.

Here we hypothesized that seeding the ECs first on Matrigel and then FBs 24 h later to stabilize the endothelial network (sequential preculture) would enhance cord formation in engineered cardiac organoids. Three sequential preculture groups were tested by seeding ECs (D4T line) at 8%, 15% and 31% of the total cell number on Matrigel-coated microchannels and incubating for 24 h. Cardiac FBs were then seeded (32%, 25% and 9% of the total cell number, respectively) and incubated an additional 24 h. Finally, neonatal rat CMs (60% of the total cell number) were added and the organoids were cultivated for seven days. Within 24 h, the 8% EC group formed elongated cords which eventually developed into beating cylindrical organoids, while the 15% and 31% EC groups proliferated into flat EC monolayers with poor viability.

In a novel biofabrication process known as bioprinting (Mironov et al., 2009a), live multicellular aggregates/clusters are used to make tissue or organ constructs via the layer-by-layer deposition technique, in which the printed bio-constructs are embedded in hydrogels rich in maturogens and placed in bioreactors to undergo the fusion process of self-assembly, maturation, and differentiation to form the desired functional tissue or organ products. We formulate the mathematical model to study the morphological development of the printed bio-constructs during fusion by exploring the chemical-mechanical interaction among the cellular aggregates involved. Specifically, we treat the cellular aggregates and the surrounding hydrogels as two immiscible complex fluids in the time scale comparable to cellular aggregate fusion and then develop an effective mean-field potential that incorporates the long-range, attractive interaction between cells as well as the short-range, repulsive interaction due to immiscibility between the cell and the hydrogel. We then implement the model using a high order spectral method to simulate the making of a set of tissues/organs in simple yet fundamental geometries like a ring, a sheet of tissues, and a Y-shaped, bifurcating vascular junction by the layer-by-layer deposition of spheroidal cellular clusters in the bioprinting technology.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2012-07-06", "authors": ["XiaofengYang", "VladimirMironov", "QiWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.03.003"}

In this study, novel biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) matrices were generated by 3D-printing. High porosity was achieved by starch consolidation. This study aimed to characterise the porous BCP-scaffold properties and interactions of osteogenic cells and growth factors under in vivo conditions. Five differently treated constructs were implanted subcutaneously in syngeneic rats: plain BCP constructs (group A), constructs pre-treated with BMP-2 (group B; 1.6\u2009\u00b5g BMP-2 per scaffold), seeded with primary osteoblasts (OB) (group C), seeded with OB and BMP-2 (group D) and constructs seeded with OB and pre-cultivated in a flow bioreactor for 6\u2009weeks (group E). After 2, 4 and 6\u2009weeks, specimens were explanted and subjected to histological and molecular biological analyses.

{"title": "Bridging the bio-electronic interface with biofabrication.", "abstract": "Advancements in lab-on-a-chip technology promise to revolutionize both research and medicine through lower costs, better sensitivity, portability, and higher throughput. The incorporation of biological components onto biological microelectromechanical systems (bioMEMS) has shown great potential for achieving these goals. Microfabricated electronic chips allow for micrometer-scale features as well as an electrical connection for sensing and actuation. Functional biological components give the system the capacity for specific detection of analytes, enzymatic functions, and whole-cell capabilities. Standard microfabrication processes and bio-analytical techniques have been successfully utilized for decades in the computer and biological industries, respectively. Their combination and interfacing in a lab-on-a-chip environment, however, brings forth new challenges. There is a call for techniques that can build an interface between the electrode and biological component that is mild and is easy to fabricate and pattern. Biofabrication, described here, is one such approach that has shown great promise for its easy-to-assemble incorporation of biological components with versatility in the on-chip functions that are enabled. Biofabrication uses biological materials and biological mechanisms (self-assembly, enzymatic assembly) for bottom-up hierarchical assembly. While our labs have demonstrated these concepts in many formats, here we demonstrate the assembly process based on electrodeposition followed by multiple applications of signal-based interactions. The assembly process consists of the electrodeposition of biocompatible stimuli-responsive polymer films on electrodes and their subsequent functionalization with biological components such as DNA, enzymes, or live cells. Electrodeposition takes advantage of the pH gradient created at the surface of a biased electrode from the electrolysis of water. Chitosan and alginate are stimuli-responsive biological polymers that can be triggered to self-assemble into hydrogel films in response to imposed electrical signals. The thickness of these hydrogels is determined by the extent to which the pH gradient extends from the electrode. This can be modified using varying current densities and deposition times. This protocol will describe how chitosan films are deposited and functionalized by covalently attaching biological components to the abundant primary amine groups present on the film through either enzymatic or electrochemical methods. Alginate films and their entrapment of live cells will also be addressed. Finally, the utility of biofabrication is demonstrated through examples of signal-based interaction, including chemical-to-electrical, cell-to-cell, and also enzyme-to-cell signal transmission. Both the electrodeposition and functionalization can be performed under near-physiological conditions without the need for reagents and thus spare labile biological components from harsh conditions. Additionally, both chitosan and alginate have long been used for biologically-relevant purposes. Overall, biofabrication, a rapid technique that can be simply performed on a benchtop, can be used for creating micron scale patterns of functional biological components on electrodes and can be used for a variety of lab-on-a-chip applications.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-06-20", "authors": ["TanyaGordonov", "BenjaminLiba", "Jessica LTerrell", "YiCheng", "XiaolongLuo", "Gregory FPayne", "William EBentley"], "doi": "10.3791/4231"}

{"title": "Scaffold pore space modulation through intelligent design of dissolvable microparticles.", "abstract": "The goal of this area of research is to manipulate the pore space of scaffolds through the application of an intelligent design concept on dissolvable microparticles. To accomplish this goal, we developed an efficient and repeatable process for fabrication of microparticles from multiple materials using a combination of rapid prototyping (RP) and soft lithography. Phase changed 3D printing was used to create masters for PDMS molds. A photocrosslinkable polymer was then delivered into these molds to make geometrically complex 3D microparticles. This repeatable process has demonstrated to generate the objects with greater than 95% repeatability with complete pattern transfer. This process was illustrated for three different shapes of various complexities. The shapes were based on the extrusion of 2D shapes. This may allow simplification of the fabrication process in the future combined with a direct transfer of the findings. Altering the shapes of particles used for porous scaffold fabrication will allow for tailoring of the pore shapes, and therefore their biological function within a porous tissue engineering scaffold. Through permeation experiments, we have shown that the pore geometry may alter the permeability coefficient of scaffolds while influencing mechanical properties to a lesser extent. By selecting different porogen shapes, the nutrition transport and scaffold degradation can be significantly influenced with minimal effect on the mechanical integrity of the construct. In addition, the different shapes may allow a control of drug release by modifying their surface-to-volume ratio, which could modulate drug delivery over time. While soft lithography is currently used with photolithography, its high precision is offset by high cost of production. The employment of RP to a specific resolution offers a much less expensive alternative with increased throughput due to the speed of current RP systems.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2012-06-14", "authors": ["Michael A KLiebschner", "MatthewWettergreen"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-61779-764-4_5"}
{"title": "A novel bone scaffold design approach based on shape function and all-hexahedral mesh refinement.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering is the application of interdisciplinary knowledge in the building and repairing of tissues. Generally, an engineered tissue is a combination of living cells and a support structure called a scaffold. The scaffold provides support for bone-producing cells and can be used to heal or replace a defective bone. In this chapter, a novel bone scaffold design approach based on shape function and an all-hexahedral mesh refinement method is presented. Based on the shape function in the finite element method, an all-hexahedral mesh is used to design a porous bone scaffold. First, the individual pore based on the subdivided individual element is modeled; then, the Boolean operation union among the pores is used to generate the whole pore model of TE bone scaffold; finally, the bone scaffold which contains various irregular pores can be modeled by the Boolean operation difference between the solid model and the whole pore model. From the SEM images, the pore size distribution in the native bone is not randomly distributed and there are gradients for pore size distribution. Therefore, a control approach for pore size distribution in the bone scaffold based on the hexahedral mesh refinement is also proposed in this chapter. A well-defined pore size distribution can be achieved based on the fact that a hexahedral element size distribution can be obtained through an all-hexahedral mesh refinement and the pore morphology and size are under the control of the hexahedral element. The designed bone scaffold can be converted to a universal 3D file format (such as STL or STEP) which could be used for rapid prototyping (RP). Finally, 3D printing (Spectrum Z510), a type of RP system, is adopted to fabricate these bone scaffolds.

We present a multi-nozzle-based versatile deposition approach to flexibly construct porous tissue engineering scaffolds using distinct polymeric biomaterials such as thermoplastic and photo-crosslinkable polymers. We first describe the development of the deposition system and fabrication of scaffolds from two types of biodegradable polymers using this system. The thermoplastic sample is semi-crystalline poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) that can be processed at a temperature higher than its melting point and solidifies at room temperature. The photo-crosslinkable one is polypropylene fumarate (PPF) that has to be dissolved in a reactive solvent as a resin for being cured into solid structures. Besides the direct fabrication of thermoplastic PCL scaffolds, we specifically develop a layer molding approach for the fabrication of crosslinkable polymers, which traditionally can only be fabricated by stereolithography. In this approach, a thermoplastic supporting material (paraffin wax) is first deposited to make a mold for each specific layer, and then PPF is deposited on demand to fill the mold and cured by the UV light. The supporting material can be removed to produce a porous scaffold of crosslinked PPF. Both PCL and crosslinked PPF scaffolds fabricated using the developed system have been characterized in terms of compressive mechanical properties, morphology, pore size and porosity.

An orthodontic patient, scheduled for conventional orthodontic treatment, served as a study subject. After a precise clinical and radiographic examination, the approach was to digitize the patient's dental arches and then to correct them virtually by computer. Additive manufacturing was then used to fabricate a mould for a soft customized appliance. The mould was manufactured using stereolithography from Somos ProtoGen O-XT 18420 material.

A novel fluorescent nanocomposite nanofiber material, consisting of CdS and zein has been fabricated through the electrospinning process. A detailed optimization was carried out to fabricate continuous and uniform nanofibers without beads or droplets. The synthesized hybrid nanofibers were characterized by various state-of-the-art techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TEM-energy dispersive spectrometry, atomic force microscopy and confocal fluorescence micrography. The optimization process was carried out to fabricate fibers ranging from 200 to 450 nm in diameter. The electrical conductivity of the zein-CdS hybrid nanofiber substrates was tested. The potential use of the electrospun CdS-encapsulated nanofibrous scaffold as substrates for cell/tissue culture was evaluated with two different cell types, i.e. mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts. The results showed that the electrospun fibrous scaffolds could support the attachment and the proliferation of cells. In addition, the cells cultured on the fibrous scaffolds exhibited normal cell shapes and integrated well with surrounding fibers.

{"title": "A quantitative metric for pattern fidelity of bioprinted cocultures.", "abstract": "This article describes a quantitative metric for coculture pattern fidelity and its use in the assessment of bioprinting systems. Increasingly, bioprinting is used to create in vitro cell and tissue models for the purpose of studying cell behavior and cell-cell interaction. To create meaningful models, a bioprinting system must be able to place cells in biologically relevant patterns with sufficient fidelity. A metric for assessing fidelity would be valuable for tuning experimental processes and parameters within a bioprinting system and for comparing performance between different systems. Toward this end, the \"bioprinting fidelity index\" (BFI), a metric which rates a bioprinted patterned coculture with a single number based on the proportions of correctly placed cells, is proposed. Additionally, a mathematical model of drop-on-demand printing is introduced, which predicts an upper bound on the BFI based on drop placement statistics. A proof-of-concept study was conducted in which patterned cocultures of D1 and 4T07 cells were produced in two different demonstration patterns. The BFI for the patterned cocultures was calculated and compared to the printing model fidelity prediction. The printing model successfully predicted the best BFI observed in the samples, and the BFI showed quantitatively that post-processing techniques negatively impacted the final fidelity of the samples. The BFI provides a principled method for comparing printing and post-processing methods.", "journal": "Artificial organs", "date": "2012-05-18", "authors": ["Matthew EPepper", "Richard EGroff", "Cheryl A PCass", "Justin PMattimore", "TimothyBurg", "Karen J LBurg"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1525-1594.2012.01460.x"}

Here we formulate two computer simulation methods: (1) a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) and (2) a cellular particle dynamics (CPD) method, which are capable of describing and predicting the shape evolution in time of three-dimensional multicellular systems during their biomechanical relaxation. Our work is motivated by the need of developing quantitative methods for optimizing postprinting structure formation in bioprinting-assisted tissue engineering. The KMC and CPD model parameters are determined and calibrated by using an original computational-theoretical-experimental framework applied to the fusion of two spherical cell aggregates.

Three generations of implant designs were developed and were optimized with the help of fit/fill and mechanical performance of implant-cadaver bone assembly using CT analysis and compression testing, respectively. A final optimized, custom Ti6Al4V alloy amputation implant, with approximately 25% porosity in the proximal region and approximately zero percent porosity in the distal region, was fabricated using Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS\u2122)--a laser based additive manufacturing technology.\nThe proposed design changes in the second generation designs, in terms of refining thresholds, increased the average fill of the bone cavity from 58% to 83%. Addition of a flange between the stem and the head in the second generation designs resulted in more than a seven-fold increase in the compressive load carrying capacity of the assembly. Application of LENS\u2122 in the fabrication of present custom fit Ti6Al4V alloy implants enabled incorporation of 20 to 30% porosity in the proximal region and one to two percent residual porosity in the distal portion of the implant.\nPatient specific prostheses having direct connection to the skeletal structure can potentially aid in problems related to load transfer and proprioception in amputees.

We assessed the biocompatibility of these scaffolds using an SH-SY5Y human neuronal cell line and primary cultured rat Schwann cells (of direct relevance to the repair of nerve injuries). A Comet assay with SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells revealed minimal DNA damage after washing the photocured material for 7 days in ethanol. Additionally, thin films and 3D scaffolds of the photocured PLA sustained a high degree of Schwann cell purity (99%), enabled proliferation over 7 days and provided a suitable substrate for supporting Schwann cell adhesion such that bi-polar and tri-polar morphologies were observed. Evidence of orthogonally aligned and organized actin thin filaments and the formation of focal contacts were observed for the majority of Schwann cells.

The usefulness of ASCs in biofabrication is further enhanced by our demonstration of the unique properties of these cells when they are cultured as three-dimensional cellular aggregates or spheroids. As described herein, three-dimensional formulations, or self-assembling ASC spheroids develop their own extracellular matrix that serves to increase the robustness of the cells to mechanical stresses. The composition of the extracellular matrix can be altered based on the external environment of the spheroids and these constructs can be grown in a reproducible manner and to a consistent size. The spheroid formulation helps preserve the viability and developmental plasticity of ASCs even under defined, serum-free media conditions. For the first time, we show that multiple generations of adherent ASCs produced from these spheroids retain their ability to differentiate into multiple cell/tissue types.

Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a digital feedback mechanism for device optimization.

Both solid gage parts and scaffolds having 1-D, 2-D and 3-D orthogonal, periodic porous architectures were made with 0, 10, 20 and 30 vol.% HA. PCL:HA scaffolds manufactured by SLS had nearly full density (99%) in the designed solid regions and had excellent geometric and dimensional control. Through optimization of the SLS process, the compressive moduli for our solid gage parts and scaffolds are the highest reported in the literature for additive manufacturing. The compressive moduli of solid gage parts were 299.3, 311.2, 415.5 and 498.3 MPa for PCL:HA loading at 100:0, 90:10, 80:20 and 70:30, respectively. The compressive effective stiffness tended to increase as the loading of HA was increased and the designed porosity was lowered. In the case of the most 3-D porous scaffold, the compressive modulus more than doubled from 14.9 to 36.2 MPa when changing the material from 100:0 to 70:30 PCL:HA. A micromechanical FEA model was developed to investigate the reinforcement effect of HA loading on the compressive modulus of the bulk material. Using a first-principles based approach, the random distribution of HA particles in a solidified PCL matrix was modeled for any HA loading to predict the bulk mechanical properties of the composites. The bulk mechanical properties were also used for FEA of the scaffold geometries. The results of the FEA were found to be in good agreement with experimental mechanical testing.

Human articular chondrocytes were printed at various densities, stimulated transiently with growth factors and subsequently with chondrogenic factors. Samples were cultured for up to 4 weeks to evaluate cell proliferation and viability, mechanical properties, mass swelling ratio, water content, gene expression, ECM production, DNA content, and histology. Bioprinted samples treated with FGF-2/TGF-\u03b21 had the best chondrogenic properties among all groups apparently due to synergistic stimulation of cell proliferation and chondrogenic phenotype. ECM production per chondrocyte in low cell density was much higher than that in high cell seeding density. This finding was also verified by mechanical testing and histology. In conclusion, cell seeding density that is feasible for bioprinting also appears optimal for human neocartilage formation when combined with appropriate growth and differentiation factors.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2012-04-18", "authors": ["XiaofengCui", "KurtBreitenkamp", "MartinLotz", "DarrylD'Lima"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.24488"}

Alternatively, to investigate the basic operational principles with morphological, electrophysiological and computational methods, the activity emerging from large in vitro networks of primary neurons organized with imposed topologies can be studied. Here, we validated the use of a new bio-printing approach, which effectively maintains the topology of hippocampal cultures in vitro and investigated, by patch-clamp and MEA electrophysiology, the emerging functional properties of these grid-confined networks. In spite of differences in the organization of physical connectivity, our bio-patterned grid networks retained the key properties of synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity and overall network activity with respect to random networks. Interestingly, the imposed grid topology resulted in a reinforcement of functional connections along orthogonal directions, shorter connectivity links and a greatly increased spiking probability in response to focal stimulation.

{"title": "Creating transient cell membrane pores using a standard inkjet printer.", "abstract": "Bioprinting has a wide range of applications and significance, including tissue engineering, direct cell application therapies, and biosensor microfabrication. Recently, thermal inkjet printing has also been used for gene transfection. The thermal inkjet printing process was shown to temporarily disrupt the cell membranes without affecting cell viability. The transient pores in the membrane can be used to introduce molecules, which would otherwise be too large to pass through the membrane, into the cell cytoplasm. The application being demonstrated here is the use of thermal inkjet printing for the incorporation of fluorescently labeled g-actin monomers into cells. The advantage of using thermal ink-jet printing to inject molecules into cells is that the technique is relatively benign to cells. Cell viability after printing has been shown to be similar to standard cell plating methods. In addition, inkjet printing can process thousands of cells in minutes, which is much faster than manual microinjection. The pores created by printing have been shown to close within about two hours. However, there is a limit to the size of the pore created (~10 nm) with this printing technique, which limits the technique to injecting cells with small proteins and/or particles. A standard HP DeskJet 500 printer was modified to allow for cell printing. The cover of the printer was removed and the paper feed mechanism was bypassed using a mechanical lever. A stage was created to allow for placement of microscope slides and coverslips directly under the print head. Ink cartridges were opened, the ink was removed and they were cleaned prior to use with cells. The printing pattern was created using standard drawing software, which then controlled the printer through a simple print command. 3T3 fibroblasts were grown to confluence, trypsinized, and then resuspended into phosphate buffered saline with soluble fluorescently labeled g-actin monomers. The cell suspension was pipetted into the ink cartridge and lines of cells were printed onto glass microscope cover slips. The live cells were imaged using fluorescence microscopy and actin was found throughout the cytoplasm. Incorporation of fluorescent actin into the cell allows for imaging of short-time cytoskeletal dynamics and is useful for a wide range of applications.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-03-29", "authors": ["Alexander BOwczarczak", "Stephen OShuford", "Scott TWood", "SandraDeitch", "DelphineDean"], "doi": "10.3791/3681"}

In this study, 3D scaffolds based on this polymer (PHMGCL, HMG:CL 8:92) were prepared by means of fiber deposition (melt-plotting). The biodegradation and tissue biocompatibility of PHMGCL and PCL scaffolds after subcutaneous implantation in Balb/c mice were investigated. At 4 and 12 weeks post implantation, the scaffolds were retrieved and evaluated for extent of degradation by measuring the residual weight of the scaffolds, thermal properties (DSC), and morphology (SEM) whereas the polymer was analyzed for both its composition ((1)H NMR) and molecular weight (GPC). The scaffolds with infiltrated tissues were harvested, fixed, stained and histologically analyzed. The in vitro enzymatic degradation of these scaffolds was also investigated in lipase solutions. It was shown that PHMGCL 3D-scaffolds lost more than 60% of their weight within 3 months of implantation while PCL scaffolds showed no weight loss in this time frame. The molecular weight (M(w)) of PHMGCL decreased from 46.9 kDa before implantation to 23.2 kDa after 3 months of implantation, while the molecular weight of PCL was unchanged in this period. (1)H NMR analysis showed that the degradation of PHMGCL was characterized by a loss of HMG units. In vitro enzymatic degradation showed that PHMGCL scaffolds were degraded within 50 h, while the degradation time for PCL scaffolds of similar structure was 72 h. A normal foreign body response to both scaffold types characterized by the presence of macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibrosis was observed with a more rapid onset in PHMGCL scaffolds. The extent of tissue-scaffold interactions as well as vascularization was shown to be higher for PHMGCL scaffolds compared to PCL ones.

Bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli interaction with nanostructured surfaces shows an increase in adhesion and biofilm formation with increasing nanoscale morphological properties. Conversely, limiting ns-TiO(2)\u00a0film distribution to micro/nanopatterned designed substrates integrated with bovine serum albumin functionalization leads to a reduction in biofilm formations due to a globally decreased bacterial cell-surface interaction area.

{"title": "Toward engineering functional organ modules by additive manufacturing.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering is emerging as a possible alternative to methods aimed at alleviating the growing demand for replacement tissues and organs. A major pillar of most tissue engineering approaches is the scaffold, a biocompatible network of synthetic or natural polymers, which serves as an extracellular matrix mimic for cells. When the scaffold is seeded with cells it is supposed to provide the appropriate biomechanical and biochemical conditions for cell proliferation and eventual tissue formation. Numerous approaches have been used to fabricate scaffolds with ever-growing complexity. Recently, novel approaches have been pursued that do not rely on artificial scaffolds. The most promising ones utilize matrices of decellularized organs or methods based on multicellular self-assembly, such as sheet-based and bioprinting-based technologies. We briefly overview some of the scaffold-free approaches and detail one that employs biological self-assembly and bioprinting.

These scaffolds were then sintered at 1150\u2009\u00b0C and 1250\u2009\u00b0C in conventional electric muffle and microwave furnaces, respectively. Total open porosity between 42% and 63% was obtained in the sintered scaffolds due to the presence of intrinsic micropores along with designed pores. A significant increase in compressive strength between 46% and 69% was achieved by microwave compared to conventional sintering as a result of efficient densification. Maximum compressive strengths of 10.95\u2009\u00b1\u20091.28\u2009MPa and 6.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67\u2009MPa were achieved for scaffolds with 500\u2009\u03bcm designed pores (~ 400\u2009\u03bcm after sintering) sintered in microwave and conventional furnaces, respectively. An increase in cell density with a decrease in macropore size was observed during in vitro cell-material interactions using human osteoblast cells. Histomorphological analysis revealed that the presence of both micro- and macropores facilitated osteoid-like new bone formation when tested in femoral defects of Sprague-Dawley rats.

Integration of implants with surrounding native tissues is crucial for long-term stability and enhanced functionality. In this study, we developed a bioprinting system with simultaneous photopolymerization capable for three-dimensional (3D) cartilage tissue engineering. Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) with human chondrocytes were printed to repair defects in osteochondral plugs (3D biopaper) in layer-by-layer assembly. Compressive modulus of printed PEGDMA was 395.73\u00b180.40\u2009kPa, which was close to the range of the properties of native human articular cartilage. Printed human chondrocytes maintained the initially deposited positions due to simultaneous photopolymerization of surrounded biomaterial scaffold, which is ideal in precise cell distribution for anatomic cartilage engineering. Viability of printed human chondrocytes increased 26% in simultaneous polymerization than polymerized after printing. Printed cartilage implant attached firmly with surrounding tissue and greater proteoglycan deposition was observed at the interface of implant and native cartilage in Safranin-O staining. This is consistent with the enhanced interface failure strength during the culture assessed by push-out testing. Printed cartilage in 3D biopaper had elevated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content comparing to that without biopaper when normalized to DNA. These observations were consistent with gene expression results.

In this study, a new unit cell-based computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system was developed for the automated design and fabrication of a porous structure with micro-scale inner architecture that can be applied to composite tissue regeneration. The CAM system was developed by first defining a data structure for the computing process of a unit cell representing a single pore structure.

We now demonstrate for the first time the 3D arrangement of vital cells by LaBP as multicellular grafts analogous to native archetype and the formation of tissue by these cells. For this purpose, fibroblasts and keratinocytes embedded in collagen were printed in 3D as a simple example for skin tissue. To study cell functions and tissue formation process in 3D, different characteristics, such as cell localisation and proliferation were investigated. We further analysed the formation of adhering and gap junctions, which are fundamental for tissue morphogenesis and cohesion.

In order to explore and evaluate this process, recreational runners were recruited. They had both feet scanned and 15 anthropometric measurements taken. Personalised insoles were designed from the scans and manufactured using AM.

To achieve comparable results in vitro, bioreactors are advised for improved cell survival, as they are able to provide a controlled flow through the scaffold. We hypothesize that a bioreactor would enhance long-term differentiation conditions of osteogenic cells in 3D scaffolds. To achieve this either primary rat osteoblasts or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) were implanted on uniform-sized biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffolds produced by a 3D printing method. Three types of culture conditions were applied: static culture without osteoinduction (Group A); static culture with osteoinduction (Group B); dynamic culture with osteoinduction (Group C). After 3 and 6\u00a0weeks, the scaffolds were analysed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), dsDNA amount, SEM, fluorescent labelled live-dead assay, and real-time RT-PCR in addition to weekly alamarBlue assays. With osteoinduction, increased ALP values and calcium deposition are observed; however, under static conditions, a significant decrease in the cell number on the biomaterial is observed. Interestingly, the bioreactor system not only reversed the decreased cell numbers but also increased their differentiation potential. We conclude from this study that a continuous flow bioreactor not only preserves the number of osteogenic cells but also keeps their differentiation ability in balance providing a suitable cell-seeded scaffold product for applications in regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2012-02-07", "authors": ["Subha NRath", "Leonie AStrobel", "AndreasArkudas", "Justus PBeier", "Anne-KathrinMaier", "PeterGreil", "Raymund EHorch", "UlrichKneser"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01545.x"}

Rapid prototyping and microreplication were used to produce a negative polydimethylsiloxane mold, and then a planar porous scaffold with predefined microchannel parameters was obtained by freeze-drying a silk fibroin/gelatin solution of an optimized concentration. After seeding with rat primary hepatocytes, the planar scaffold was rolled up to build spatial channels. By reconstructing the three-dimensional channel model in the scaffold in the form of micro-computed topography data and observing the cross-sections of the scroll, we confirmed that the bent channels were still interconnected, with restricted deviations. A comparison of the primary hepatocyte culture in the scaffolds with and without the devised channels proved that our design influenced cell organization and improved cell survival and proliferation.

Under the optimized condition, the water contact angle of chitosan films was significantly reduced from 90 \u00b1 1\u00b0 to 19 \u00b1 1\u00b0 after AP treatment. On the other hand, the surface charge and nanometric roughness of chitosan films increased after AP treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement on AP-treated three-dimensional chitosan scaffolds showed that nitrogen and oxygen increased at each location inside the scaffolds as compared to the untreated ones, which indicated that AP could permeate through the fibrous stacks of the scaffolds and effectively modify the interior (visible) surface of the scaffolds. Moreover, AP treatment enabled the migration of MC3T3-E1 cells into the scaffolds, facilitated their proliferation and promoted the bone mineral deposition.

This variation impacts the cell population size of bioprinted samples, which should ideally be consistent. The variation in output was specifically studied in the context of cell settling. The bioprinter studied is based on the thermal inkjet HP26A cartridge; however, the results are relevant to other cell delivery systems that draw fluid from a reservoir. A simple mathematical model suggests that the cell concentration in the bottom of the reservoir should increase linearly over time, up to some maximum, and that the cell output should be proportional to this concentration. Two studies were performed in which D1 murine stem cells and similarly sized polystyrene latex beads were printed. The bead output profiles were consistent with the model. The cell output profiles initially followed the increasing trend predicted by the settling model, but after several minutes the cell output peaked and then decreased. The decrease in cell output was found to be associated with the number of use cycles the cartridge had experienced. The differing results for beads and cells suggest that a biological process, such as adhesion, causes the decrease in cell output.

X-ray micro-computed tomography and 3D printing elucidate the mechanism of conformational change from a passive (slightly curved, attached to surface) to a defensive (rolled, detached from surface) state of the plate assembly. The passive and defensive conformations exhibited differences in longitudinal curvature index (0.43 vs. 0.70), average plate-to-plate overlap (\u223c62% vs. \u223c48%), cross-sectional overlap heterogeneity (60-82.5% vs. 0-90%, fourth plate), and plate-to-plate separation distance (100% increase in normalized separation distance between plates 4 and 5), respectively. The plate-to-plate interconnections consist of two rigid plates joined by a compliant, actuating muscle, analogous to a geometrically structured shear lap joint. This work provides an understanding of how T. marmorea achieves the balance between mobility and protection. In the passive state, the morphometry of the plates and plate-to-plate interconnections results in an approximately continuous curvature and constant armor thickness, resulting in limited mobility but maximum protection. In the defensive state, the underlying soft tissues gain protection and the chiton gains mobility through tidal flow, but regions of vulnerability open dorsally, due to the increase in plate-to-plate separation and decrease in plate-to-plate overlap. Lastly, experiments using optical and scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy explore the microstructure and spatial distribution of the six layers within the intermediate plates, the role of multilayering in resisting predatory attacks, and the detection of chitin as a major component of the intra-plate organic matrix and girdle.", "journal": "Journal of structural biology", "date": "2012-01-18", "authors": ["Matthew JConnors", "HermannEhrlich", "MartinHog", "ClemenceGodeffroy", "SergioAraya", "IlanKallai", "DanGazit", "MaryBoyce", "ChristineOrtiz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jsb.2011.12.019"}

This study explores the fabrication of a more compliant cantilever, similar to that of the native myocardium, with elasticity on the order of kilo (10(3)) Pascals. 3D stereolithographic technology, a layer-by-layer UV polymerizable rapid prototyping system, was used to rapidly fabricate multi-material cantilevers composed of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and acrylic-PEG-collagen (PC) mixtures. The incorporation of acrylic-PEG-collagen into PEGDA-based materials enhanced cell adhesion, spreading, and organization without altering the ability to vary the elastic modulus through the molecular weight of PEGDA. Cardiomyocytes derived from neonatal rats were seeded on the cantilevers, and the resulting stresses and contractile forces were calculated using finite element simulations validated with classical beam equations. These cantilevers can be used as a mechanical sensor to measure the contractile forces of cardiomyocyte cell sheets, and as an early prototype for the design of optimal cell-based biohybrid actuators.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2011-11-30", "authors": ["VincentChan", "Jae HyunJeong", "PiyushBajaj", "MitchellCollens", "TaherSaif", "HyunjoonKong", "RashidBashir"], "doi": "10.1039/c1lc20688e"}

One of the main issues regarding the application of CATE concerns the definition of the internal architecture of the fabricated scaffolds, which, in turn, influences their porosity and mechanical strength. The present study envisages an innovative strategy for the fabrication of highly optimized structures, based on the a priori finite element analysis (FEA) of the physiological load set at the implant site. The resulting scaffold micro-architecture does not follow a regular geometrical pattern; on the contrary, it is based on the results of a numerical study. The algorithm was applied to a solid free-form fabrication process, using poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) as the starting material for the processing of additive manufactured structures. A simple and intuitive geometry was chosen as a proof-of-principle application, on which finite element simulations and mechanical testing were performed. Then, to demonstrate the capability in creating mechanically biomimetic structures, the proximal femur subjected to physiological loading conditions was considered and a construct fitting a femur head portion was designed and manufactured.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2011-11-24", "authors": ["AlbertoRainer", "Sara MGiannitelli", "DinoAccoto", "StefanoDe Porcellinis", "EugenioGuglielmelli", "MarcellaTrombetta"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-011-0465-4"}
{"title": "Fabrication of protein micropatterns using a functional substrate with convertible protein-adsorption surface properties.", "abstract": "A functional substrate capable of regulating protein adsorption was prepared using a crosslinked albumin (cl-albumin) film for use in the fabrication of protein micropatterns. The adsorption of proteins with different characteristics onto cl-albumin film, including serum proteins, serum albumin, and lysozyme, was investigated using a quartz crystal microbalance. The results showed that surfaces coated with cl-albumin film are highly resistant to protein adsorption, regardless of protein charge and rigidity. In addition, this adsorption-resistance property can be easily converted to promote protein adsorption by exposing the cl-albumin film to a charged polymer solution. By combining the convertible surface property of cl-albumin film and inkjet printing techniques, a precise protein micropattern was successfully fabricated on the substrate. Protein adsorption onto the wall surface of microchannels could also be suppressed or promoted by coating the surface with cl-albumin film. This approach will aid in the development of biomaterials carrying protein micropatterns, such as biosensors, biochips, and cellular scaffolds.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Functional coating of surfaces with vWF allows the investigation of in vitro adhesion of blood platelet. We used soft lithography to create a functional patterned substrate. vWF was printed on plasma-treated glass and mica surfaces, producing elongated network-like fibril structures. A minimum layer thickness of 3 nm was observed, corresponding to the height of a monolayer of vWF. The stability of the patterns was verified in a laminar fluid flow, and the bioactivity of the structures was tested with platelet adhesion experiments. Platelets adhered to and spread on printed vWF. These results indicate that printed vWF substrates are stable and functional in typical perfusion experiments, and thus provide a useful tool for studying thrombus formation in vitro.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Although much is known concerning the mechanisms underlying the initiation of angiogenesis, it remains unclear how the final architecture of microcirculatory beds is regulated. To begin to address this, we determined the impact of angiogenic neovessel prepatterning on the final microvascular network topology using a model of implant neovascularization.\nWe used 3D direct-write bioprinting or physical constraints in a manner permitting postangiogenesis vascular remodeling and adaptation to pattern angiogenic microvascular precursors (neovessels formed from isolated microvessel segments) in 3D collagen gels before implantation and subsequent network formation. Neovasculatures prepatterned into parallel arrays formed functional networks after 4 weeks postimplantation but lost the prepatterned architecture. However, maintenance of uniaxial physical constraints during postangiogenesis remodeling of the implanted neovasculatures produced networks with aligned microvessels, as well as an altered proportional distribution of arterioles, capillaries, and venules.\nHere we show that network topology resulting from implanted microvessel precursors is independent from prepatterning of precursors but can be influenced by a patterning stimulus involving tissue deformation during postangiogenesis remodeling and maturation.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2011-11-05", "authors": ["Carlos CChang", "LaxminarayananKrishnan", "Sara SNunes", "Kenneth HChurch", "Lowell TEdgar", "Eugene DBoland", "Jeffery AWeiss", "Stuart KWilliams", "James BHoying"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.238725"}

{"title": "Layer-by-layer tissue microfabrication supports cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "Layer-by-layer biofabrication represents a novel strategy to create three-dimensional living structures with a controlled internal architecture, using cell micromanipulation technologies. Laser assisted bioprinting (LAB) is an effective printing method for patterning cells, biomolecules, and biomaterials in two dimensions. \"Biopapers,\" made of thin polymer scaffolds, may be appropriate to achieve three-dimensional constructs and to reinforce mechanical properties of printed materials. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the tridimensional organization of cells and biomaterials on cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The experimental LAB setup was comprised of an infrared laser, focused onto a glass ribbon coated with an absorbing layer of gold. The cell bioink was made of MG63 cells (50 millions cells/mL in culture medium and 1% alginate), transduced with Luciferase gene for tracking and quantification. The printing substrate was a 100-\u03bcm-thick polycaprolacton (PCL) electrospun scaffold. The building sequence comprised sequential layers of cells and PCL scaffolds stacked using two different tridimensional arrangements, which were compared in this study (layer-by-layer vs. seeding on a single locus of the scaffolds). Then the cell-seeded materials were cultured in vitro or implanted in vivo in NOD-SCID mice. The qualitative follow-up involved scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, live-dead assays, and histology. The cell amount was quantified by photon imager during 21 days in vitro and 2 months in vivo. Live- dead assay and SEM revealed that the cells survived after printing and spread onto PCL membranes. Circle-shaped patterns were maintained in vitro during the first week but they were no longer observable after 2 weeks, due to cell proliferation. Luciferase tracking displayed that the cell amount was increased in vitro and in vivo when the materials and the cells where stacked layer by layer. Histological sections of the in vivo samples revealed a thicker fibrous tissue in the layer-by-layer samples. We have demonstrated in this study that PCL electrospun biopapers can act as a shock-absorbing mattress for cell printing and could further support cell proliferation. The layer-by-layer printing provided an appropriate 3D environment for cell survival and enhanced cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Biofabrication of osteochondral tissue equivalents by printing topologically defined, cell-laden hydrogel scaffolds.", "abstract": "Osteochondral defects are prone to induce osteoarthritic degenerative changes. Many tissue-engineering approaches that aim to generate osteochondral implants suffer from poor tissue formation and compromised integration. This illustrates the need for further improvement of heterogeneous tissue constructs. Engineering of these structures is expected to profit from strategies addressing the complexity of tissue organization and the simultaneous use of multiple cell types. Moreover, this enables the investigation of the effects of three-dimensional (3D) organization and architecture on tissue function. In the present study, we characterize the use of a 3D fiber deposition (3DF) technique for the fabrication of cell-laden, heterogeneous hydrogel constructs for potential use as osteochondral grafts. Changing fiber spacing or angle of fiber deposition yielded scaffolds of varying porosity and elastic modulus. We encapsulated and printed fluorescently labeled human chondrocytes and osteogenic progenitors in alginate hydrogel yielding scaffolds of 1\u00d72\u2009cm with different parts for both cell types. Cell viability remained high throughout the printing process, and cells remained in their compartment of the printed scaffold for the whole culture period. Moreover, distinctive tissue formation was observed, both in vitro after 3 weeks and in vivo (6 weeks subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice), at different locations within one construct. These results demonstrate the possibility of manufacturing viable centimeter-scaled structured tissues by the 3DF technique, which could potentially be used for the repair of osteochondral defects.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "PLGA/hydrogel biopapers as a stackable substrate for printing HUVEC networks via BioLP.", "abstract": "Two major challenges in tissue engineering are mimicking the native cell-cell arrangements of tissues and maintaining viability of three-dimension (3D) tissues thicker than 300 \u00b5m. Cell printing and prevascularization of engineered tissues are promising approaches to meet these challenges. However, the printing technologies used in biofabrication must balance the competing parameters of resolution, speed, and volume, which limit the resolution of thicker 3D structures. We suggest that high-resolution conformal printing techniques can be used to print 2D patterns of vascular cells onto biopaper substrates which can then be stacked to form a thicker tissue construct. Towards this end we created 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm \u00d7 300 \u00b5m biopapers to be used as the transferable, stackable substrate for cell printing. 3.6% w/v poly-lactide-co-glycolide was dissolved in chloroform and poured into molds filled with NaCl crystals. The salt was removed with DI water and the scaffolds were dried and loaded with a Collagen Type I or Matrigel. SEM of the biopapers showed extensive porosity and gel loading throughout. Biological laser printing (BioLP) was used to deposit human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a simple intersecting pattern to the surface of the biopapers. The cells differentiated and stretched to form networks preserving the printed pattern. In a separate experiment to demonstrate \"stackability,\" individual biopapers were randomly seeded with HUVECs and cultured for 1 day. The mechanically stable and viable biopapers were then stacked and cultured for 4 days. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy showed cell infiltration and survival in the compound multilayer constructs.

{"title": "Novel composite implant in craniofacial bone reconstruction.", "abstract": "Bioactive glass (BAG) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) have been used in clinical applications. Antimicrobial BAG has the ability to attach chemically to surrounding bone, but it is not possible to bend, drill or shape BAG during the operation. PMMA has advantages in terms of shaping during the operation, but it does not attach chemically to the bone and is an exothermic material. To increase the usefulness of BAG and PMMA in skull bone defect reconstructions, a new composite implant containing BAG and PMMA in craniofacial reconstructions is presented. Three patients had pre-existing large defects in the calvarial and one in the midface area. An additive manufacturing (AM) model was used preoperatively for treatment planning and custom-made implant production. The trunk of the PMMA implant was coated with BAG granules. Clinical and radiological follow-up was performed postoperatively at 1 week, and 3, 6 and 12 months, and thereafter annually up to 5 years. Computer tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET-CT) were performed at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Uneventful clinical recovery with good esthetic and functional outcome was seen.
