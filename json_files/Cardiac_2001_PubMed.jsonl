It is a paradigm of the immune-mediated cardiac damage believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of postinfectious human cardiomyopathies. Myocarditis is induced in susceptible mice by immunization with purified cardiac myosin or specific peptides derived from cardiac myosin, or by adoptive transfer of myosin-reactive T cells. Myocarditis is induced in Lewis rats by immunization with purified cardiac myosin or by adoptive transfer of T cells stimulated by specific peptides derived from cardiac myosin. Myocarditis begins 12 to 14 days after the first immunization, and is maximal after 21 days. In addition to the protocols used to induce EAM in mice and rats, support protocols are included for preparing purified cardiac myosin using mouse or rat heart tissue, preparing purified cardiac myosin for injection, and collecting and assessing hearts by histopathological means.", "journal": "Current protocols in immunology", "date": "2008-04-25", "authors": ["S CSmith"], "doi": "10.1002/0471142735.im1514s31"}

Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is a standard tool for evaluating the complexity of multidimensional signals.

Electrotonic interaction is determined not merely by intercellular electrical resistance (Rj) but rather by the interplay of Rj and sarcolemmal passive and active electrical properties (Zaniboni et al., Spitzer et al.). In this work we combined a well established protocol to measure Rj in cell pairs (Weingart e Maurer) with a stimulation protocol which allowed to simultaneously study parameters relative to action potential transfer during sequential stimulation. Current clamp experiments, performed on cardiomyocyte pairs held in double-patch configuration, allowed to simultaneously monitor, at a relatively high frequency (1 Hz), membrane resistance (Rm), resting potential (Vm), maximum depolarization rate (dv/dtmax) and time to peak of dv/dtmax in both cells as well as Rj. Spontaneous electrical uncoupling was observed in guinea pig cell pairs with little or no effect on action potential transfer. Pharmacological uncoupling with 40 microM beta-glycyrrhetinic acid reached, in one case, a much higher level of Rj and dramatically increased time delay for action potential appearance. When only Rj was measured over a short time interval after approximately two minutes from cell-attachments, values of Rj approximately 40 M omega in rat cell pairs (n = 20) and Rj approximately 15 M omega in guinea pig cell pairs (n = 24) were obtained.

Recently, our group demonstrated that T cells infiltrating the heart of CCC patients crossreactively recognize cardiac myosin heavy chain and tandemly repetitive T. cruzi antigen B13, and possess an inflammatory T1-type cytokine profile. Susceptibility factors leading 30% of infected patients to develop CCC, while the rest of the patients remain largely asymptomatic (ASY), are still obscure. We compared immunological phenotypes of CCC and ASY patients, who have distinct clinical outcomes despite bearing a similar chronic T. cruzi infection. Preliminary observations indicate that PBMC from CCC patients recognize a set of B13 and cardiac myosin epitopes distinct from that recognized by ASY patients. Moreover, the IFN-gamma response of CCC patients is more intense than that of ASY, both at qualitative and quantitative levels. Taken together, results suggest that heart damage in Chagas' disease cardiomyopathy may be secondary to inflammatory cytokines and a delayed-type hypersensitivity process started and/or maintained by heart-crossreactive T cells. Furthermore, the distinct recognition repertoire and the high frequency of IFN-gamma producing among CCC patients could be important factors leading to the differential development of CCC among T. cruzi infected individuals.", "journal": "Autoimmunity", "date": "2002-03-23", "authors": ["ECunha-Neto", "JKalil"], "doi": "10.3109/08916930109007383"}

Methimazole administration markedly slowed the body weight growth in both normal and EAM rats, but did not induce morphologic change of cardiac tissue in normal rats.

To identify the mechanism responsible of this effect, we investigated the change of regulatory lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood using an immunofluorescence technique with a flow cytometer. A decrease in the helper/suppressor T cell ratio as a result of the increased proportion of suppressor T cells and a decrease in the proportion of B cells were observed in normal rats after methimazole administration, and similar findings were made in the EAM rats treated with methimazole.

In CD2F1 mice, LEM was significantly less toxic as compared with MTO. A single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 15 mg/kg MTO produced 100% mortality in CD2F1 mice by Day 10, whereas a single i.v. dose as high as 35 mg/kg LEM caused no mortality for at least up to Day 60 post-treatment. Multiple doses of MTO (i.v., 5.0 mg/kg, 1x daily, x5) caused 100% mortality by Day 10, whereas a similar dose regimen of LEM caused no mortality in CD2F1 mice. Clinical and histopathology evaluations indicated long-term normal tissue protection in mice treated with relatively high single dose (i.v., 35 mg/kg) or multiple doses of LEM (i.v., 5.0 mg/kg, 1x daily, x5).

Since then, the art of transplant surgery has come a long way in establishing itself as an important discipline with the support disciplines of immunology, molecular biology, etc., for the restoration of a failing organ. Today there is a major discrepancy in the demand and supply of organ grafts. The aim of the present study is to see whether fetal organ and tissue, with its intrinsic advantages of hypo-antigenicity, can survive in a HLA and sex-randomized host in a surgically prepared vascular subcutaneous axillary fold, without any immunosuppressive support. We have earlier reported two cases of fetal thymic transplant, collected from consenting mothers undergoing hysterotomy and ligation.\nFourteen cases were recruited for the present study after thorough informed consent and approval by the Ethical Committee of the Project. Of these, five patients were suffering from advanced cancer, three from diabetic gangrene, three from ischaemic heart disease and three from rheumatoid arthritis, liver abscess and disc prolapse. The ages of the patients varied from 39 to 82 years. Six fetal thymuses, three fetal liver tissues, three fetal cardiac tissues, one fetal pancreas and one fetal lung tissue were transplanted. All the fetuses were dissected and the selected tissues/organs were transplanted within one to three minutes after collecting them from the consenting mothers undergoing hysterotomy and ligation. The fetal tissue graft was placed in a surgically prepared subcutaneous vascular axillary fold, 2x1 cm, under local anaesthesia in the consenting adult recipient. Sequential Hb, Tc, Dc, ESR were done to see the impact of the transplant on the host system. After one month, the transplanted fetal tissue was taken out by an elliptical incision and the tissue was processed for histological staining.\nAll the 14 patients tolerated the transplant procedure well. There was no fever, intractable pain or any other specific serious side-effect justifying removal of the transplant earlier. There was no discharge from the incision site and the healing and scar were by and large normal. There was no unusual leucocytosis or lymphocytosis. The serial histological study did not suggest features of transplant rejection.\nPregnancy and neoplasm are two outstanding examples of natural tolerance to homograft. In both cases, blocking antibody has an important role in the phenomenon of immunotolerance.

These \"cooked-food mutagens\" constitute a potential health hazard because DNA damage arising from dietary exposure to heterocyclic amines can modify cell genomes and thereby affect future organ function. To determine enzymes responsible for heterocyclic amine processing in mammalian tissues, we performed studies to measure genotoxic activation of the N-hydroxy form of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) --a common dietary mutagen. O-Acetyltransferase, sulfotransferase, kinase, and amino-acyl synthetase activities were assayed using substrate-specific reactions and cytosolic enzymes from newborn and adult rat heart, liver, spleen, kidney, brain, lung, and skeletal muscle. The resultant enzyme-specific DNA adduct formation was quantified via (32)P-postlabeling techniques. In biochemical assays with rat tissue cytosolic proteins, O-acetyltransferases were the enzymes most responsible for N-hydroxy-PhIP (N-OH-PhIP) activation. Compared to O-acetyltransferase activation, there was significantly less kinase activity and even lesser amounts of sulfotransferase activity. Proyl-tRNA synthetase activation of N-OH-PhIP was not detected. Comparing newborn rat tissues, the highest level of O-acetyltransferase mutagen activation was observed for neonatal heart tissue with activities ranked in the order of heart > kidney > lung > liver > skeletal muscle > brain > spleen. Enzymes from cultured neonatal myocytes displayed high O-acetyltransferase activities, similar to that observed for whole newborn heart. This tissue specificity suggests that neonatal cardiac myocytes might be at greater risk for damage from dietary heterocyclic amine mutagens than some other cell types. However, cytosolic enzymes from adult rat tissues exhibited a different O-acetyltransferase activation profile, such that liver > muscle > spleen > kidney > lung > brain > heart. These results demonstrated that enzymes involved in catalyzing PhIP-DNA adduct formation varied substantially in activity between tissues and in some tissues, changed significantly during development and aging.

Computer simulation showed that its three dimensional structure is similar to that of the class Ib antiarrhythmic drugs, e.g., lidocaine or mexiletine. HNS-32 potently suppressed ventricular arrhythmias induced by ischemia due to coronary ligation and/or ischemia-reperfusion in dogs and rats. In the isolated dog and guinea pig cardiac tissues, HNS-32 had negative inotropic and chronotropic actions, prolonged atrial-His and His-ventricular conduction time and increased coronary blood flow. In the isolated guinea pig ventricular papillary muscle, HNS-32 decreased maximal rate of action potential upstroke (Vmax) and shortened action potential duration (APD). These findings suggest that HNS-32 inhibits inward Na+ and Ca2+ channel currents. In the isolated pig coronary and rabbit conduit arteries, HNS-32 inhibited both Ca2+ channel-dependent and -independent contractions induced by a wide variety of chemical stimuli. HNS-32 is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated constriction of cerebral arteries. It is likely to block both, Na+ and Ca2+ channels expressed in cardiac and vascular smooth muscles. These multiple ion channel blocking effects are largely responsible for the antiarrhythmic and vasorelaxant actions of HNS-32.

In addition, a model is introduced for investigating the impaired autonomic function in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and sepsis, integrating extrinsic mechanisms and factors that are intrinsic to the cardiac tissue.

{"title": "How epicardial electrodes influence the transmembrane potential during a strong shock.", "abstract": "This paper analyzes a possible artifact that may corrupt experiments studying defibrillation of the heart. Our hypothesis is that surface recording electrodes can influence the transmembrane potential during a shock. In the vicinity of an electrode, current leaves the intracellular space to take advantage of the low resistance of the extracellular path, thereby depolarizing the tissue. We calculate the transmembrane potential induced around a circular electrode when exposed to a uniform electric field. The bidomain model represents the electrical behavior of the cardiac tissue, and we account for electrode polarization impedance. Our results show that adjacent regions of depolarization and hyperpolarization exist around the electrode, and that the induced depolarization is greater than 100 mV for a 0.5 mm radius silver-silver chloride electrode in a 500 V/m electric field. We conclude that surface electrodes may produce artifacts during experiments designed to study defibrillation-strength electrical shocks.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2002-01-17", "authors": ["S GPatel", "B JRoth"], "doi": "10.1114/1.1415520"}

This article addresses characteristics of slow conduction at the cellular network level during (a) a reduction of excitability, (b) a reduction of gap junctional coupling, and (c) in the setting of branching tissue structures. Microscopic impulse propagation in these settings was studied by using multiple site optical recording of transmembrane voltage in conjunction with patterned growth cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. In linear cell strands, a reduction of excitability slowed conduction by approximately 70% before block occurred. In contrast, critical reduction of gap junctional coupling induced a much higher degree of slowing (>99%) before block of conduction. Interestingly, a similar degree of conduction slowing was also observed in branching tissue structures under conditions of reduced excitability (98%). The finding of extremely slow but nevertheless safe conduction in these structures might be explained by a \"pull and push\" effect of the branches: by drawing electronic current from the activation wavefront, they first act as current loads which slow conduction at the branch points (\"pull\" effect). Then, on activation, they turn into current sources which feed current back into the system, thus supporting downstream activation and enhancing the safety of propagation (\"push\" effect). This \"pull and push\" mechanism may play a significant role in slow conduction in the AV node and in structurally discontinuous myocardium, such as the border regions of infarct scars.", "journal": "Journal of electrocardiology", "date": "2002-01-10", "authors": ["J PKucera", "A GKl\u00e9ber", "SRohr"], "doi": "10.1054/jelc.2001.28827"}

Our goal in this study was to isolate and characterize the kinetic properties of cardiac aldose reductase, as well as to study the impact of flux via this enzyme on glucose metabolism and contractile function in hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Results demonstrate that ischemia increases myocardial aldose reductase activity and that these increases are, in part, due to activation by nitric oxide. The kinetic parameter of cardiac aldose reductase (Kcat) was significantly higher in ischemic tissues. Aldose reductase inhibition increased glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Aldose reductase inhibited hearts, when subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, exhibited less ischemic injury and was associated with lower lactate/pyruvate ratios (a measure of cytosolic NADH/NAD+), greater tissue content of adenosine triphosphate, and improved cardiac function.

Beginning at 17 d of incubation, immediately prior to the plateau stage in oxygen consumption, embryos from each of the treatment groups were sampled for BW, organ growth, glycogen concentration, and plasma glucose concentrations. Sampling continued through hatching. Plasma glucose concentrations increased significantly, and hepatic glycogen concentrations declined as embryos approached hatching. The rate at which glycogen was accrued into muscle and heart tissue displayed a significant three-way interaction among line, age, and storage. Embryos from the line that resisted storage mortality maintained greater glycogen concentrations in muscle and heart tissues than those from the line and age with diminished survival rates.

The source of myocardial renin maybe direct cardiac renin gene expression, or plasma renin of renal origin. A primary indication that myocardial renin is derived from plasma renin of renal origin was from work showing that cardiac renin activity was no longer detected 30 hours after bilateral nephrectomy (BNX). However, more recent studies have been able to detect myocardial renin after BNX. We measured normal rat cardiac renin before and after 48-hour BNX using a myocardial renin assay with improved sensitivity. The myocardial renin assay was also used to assess normal rat cardiac myocyte renin levels. Since cardiac tissue contains cathepsin D, a lysosomal enzyme capable of renin-like activity, a rat cathepsin D assay was also developed to assess cathepsin D contribution to renin-like activity. Several artifacts were shown to contribute to myocardial renin-like enzymatic activity levels after BNX, including initial plasma renin stimulation during BNX surgery, assay pH, and cardiac cathepsin D activity. Myocardial renin concentration after 48-BNX was found to be only approximately 1% of normal control levels, and renin concentration in normal cardiac myocytes was only 2-fold greater than assay blanks. Both results were probably overestimated due to cathepsin D contamination.

In driven canine Purkinje fibers, DL-017 decreased twitch tension, the maximal rate of upstroke of the action potential (Vmax), and intracellular Na+ activity (a(i)Na) in a concentration-dependent manner. The action potential duration was decreased in canine Purkinje fibers but increased in guinea pig papillary muscles. In guinea pig ventricular papillary muscles, phenylephrine in the presence of 1 microM propranolol increased the twitch tension in a concentration-dependent manner. At 10 microM, phenylephrine significantly decreased a(i)Na and shortened the action potential duration. DL-017 at 0.01 microM inhibited these phenylephrine-induced effects and shifted the concentration-dependent curve to the right. In sinoatrial nodes, DL-017 inhibited pacemaker activity, involving decreases in the slope of diastolic depolarization and Vmax and an increase in a delay of repolarization. These results suggest that, in addition to blockade of alpha1-adrenoceptors and Na+ channels, DL-017 reduces cardiac excitability and contractility in association with inhibition of slow inward Ca2+ and outward K+ channels.

First, the cardiac tissue is represented by a standard bidomain model which includes a membrane capacitance; second, this model is modified by adding an intracellular capacitance representing the intercalated disks. Numerical solutions are computed with a fast Fourier transform algorithm without constraining the anisotropy ratios of the interstitial and intracellular domains. We systematically investigate the effects of changes in the bidomain parameters on the voltage-to-current ratio curves. We also demonstrate how the bidomain parameters can be theoretically estimated by fitting, with a modified Shor's r algorithm, the simulated potentials along the longitudinal and transverse axes for different frequencies between 10 and 10,000 Hz.

The cardiac tissue is represented by the bidomain model where tissue anisotropy and fiber rotation have been incorporated with a view to predicting the epicardial surface potential distribution. The source of electric potential in this steady-state problem is the difference between plateau potentials in normal and ischaemic tissue, where it is assumed that ischaemic tissue has a lower plateau potential. Simulations with tissue anisotropy and no fiber rotation are also considered. Simulations are performed for various thicknesses of the transition region between normal and ischaemic tissue and for various sizes of the ischaemic region. The simulated epicardial potential distributions, based on an anisotropic model of the cardiac tissue, show that there are large potential gradients above the border of the ischaemic region and that there are dips in the potential distribution above the region of ischaemia. It could be concluded from the simulations that it would be possible to predict the region of subendocardial ischaemia from the epicardial potential distribution, a conclusion contrary to observed experimental data. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. In the interests of mathematical simplicity, isotropic models of the cardiac tissue are also considered, but results from these simulations predict epicardial potential distributions vastly different from experimental observations.

Cardiac tissue ADM immunoreactivity and gene expression were assessed by radioimmunoassay, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis in normal and CHF dogs in the presence and absence of ACE inhibition. Experimental CHF was produced by progressive rapid ventricular pacing and characterized by increased ventricular ADM concentrations as well as increased ventricular ADM gene expression. ACE inhibition abolished the increases in ventricular ADM concentrations and ventricular ADM gene expression in CHF. Ventricular ADM gene expression was localized to ventricular myocytes and correlated with left ventricular mass index, suggesting that ventricular ADM is a marker for ventricular hypertrophy. In contrast, atrial ADM concentrations and gene expression did not change in CHF with or without ACE inhibition. Increased plasma ADM concentrations in CHF were also abolished with ACE inhibition.

{"title": "Signal transduction mechanisms and nitric oxide in hypoxic and ischemic human cardiac ventricular cell.", "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) plays a well-known role in regulating endocellular adaptive changes to acute hypoxia and ischemia. The reversible inhibition of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain fulfils a cytoprotective function, whereas the progressive inhibition of complex I and II reveals the onset of irreversible oxidative damage due to persistent NO production in response to prolonged hypoxia and/or ischemia. In hypoxic or ischemic human myocardial cells, death may be caused by apoptosis or necrosis following the activation of the biomolecular signal transduction mechanisms. The activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) followed by ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) and p21waf is necessary in this respect. The myocardial cell is well known for its postmitotic nature and through their activation these kinases aim to repair DNA damaged by oxidative stress in order to guarantee the survival of the cell itself. A direct correlation has been found between the activation of these kinases and NO production. It was decided to carry out this study in hypoxic and ischemic human heart ventricular tissue in order to confirm this connection.\nIn 10 patients undergoing cardiac valvular replacement, ventricular samples were collected before aortic clamping, after 15 min of ischemia and after 60 minutes during which the patients received doses of hematic cardioplegic solution at regular intervals.\nThe results show a rapid increase in NO production in response to ischemia followed by a tendency for levels of this element to fall. MAPK, ERK and p21waf activation was parallel to No production, irrespective of the repeated administration of hematic cardioplegic solution. The heart tissue examined 60 minutes after aortic clamping came from a ventricular area subject to preconditioning mechanisms. In view of this, the data obtained must be seen in terms of the close correlation between the mitochondrial action played by NO and the contemporary and consequent activation of unique signal transduction mechanisms.\nThis may prove important to our understanding of preconditioning mechanisms involving the myocardial and confirms the role played by the said kinases with regard to the survival of hypoxic and ischemic human heart tissue.

{"title": "Implications of CAD and DNase II in ischemic neuronal necrosis specific for the primate hippocampus.", "abstract": "The exact molecular mechanism of ischemic neuronal death still remains unclear from rodents to primates. A number of studies using lower species animals have suggested implication of apoptosis cascade, while using monkeys the authors recently claimed necrosis cascade by calpain-induced leakage of lysosomal cathepsins (calpain-cathepsin hypothesis). This paper is to study implications of apoptotic versus necrotic cascades for the development of hippocampal CA1 neuronal death in the primate brain undergoing complete global ischemia. Here, we focused on two terminal cell death effectors; caspase-activated DNase (CAD) and lysosomal enzyme DNase II, in the monkey CA1 sector undergoing 18 min ischemia. The expressions of their mRNA and proteins, and the subcellular localizations as well as ultrastructure and specific DNA gel electrophoresis were examined. Expression of CAD was much less in the normal brain, compared with the lymph node or heart tissues. On day 1 after ischemia, however, CAD mRNA and protein were significantly increased in the CA1 sector, and then CAD protein immunohistochemically showed a translocation from the perikarya into the nucleus. Activated DNase II protein was significantly increased on days 2 and 3 after ischemia, and also showed a similar translocation indicating lysosomal leakage. Although the post-ischemic CA1 neurons showed positive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining on days 3-5, they showed eosinophilic coagulation necrosis on light microscopy, and frank membrane disruption and mild chromatin condensation on electron microscopy. Furthermore, DNA smear pattern typical for necrosis was observed instead of DNA laddering. These data altogether suggest that the post-ischemic CA1 neuronal death of the monkey occurs not by apoptosis but by necrosis with participations of lysosomal enzymes DNase II and cathepsins as well as CAD.

PRKAG2 exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. The genomic organization of the PRKAG2 gene was determined using inter-exon long-range polymerase chain reaction for cDNA sequence not available in the genome database. A missense mutation, Arg531Gly, was identified in all affected individuals but was absent in 150 unrelated individuals. The PRKAG2 gene was determined to consist of 16 exons and is at least 280 kb in size.\nWe identified a novel mutation (Arg531Gly) in the gamma-2 regulatory subunit (PRKAG2) of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to be responsible for a syndrome associated with ventricular preexcitation and early onset of atrial fibrillation and conduction disease.

The identification of the cardiac ion channel(s) serving as substrate for AMPK not only would provide insight into the molecular basis of atrial fibrillation and heart block but also may suggest targets for the development of more specific therapy for these common rhythm disturbances.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2001-12-19", "authors": ["M HGollob", "J JSeger", "T NGollob", "TTapscott", "OGonzales", "LBachinski", "RRoberts"], "doi": "10.1161/hc5001.102111"}

A critical review of genomics and proteomics.", "abstract": "The multiple causes and multiple consequences of mammalian heart failure make it an attractive proposition for analysis using gene array technology, especially where the failure is idiopathic in nature. However, gene arrays also hold potential artefacts, particularly when gene expression levels are low, and where changes in expression levels are modest. Also, at present, the number of genes available on arrays is not large enough to prevent potential sampling deficiencies. Thus, it may not be wise to place too much reliance on quantitative interpretations of gene array data. Also, recently doubts were raised about the qualitative reliability of array genes. Electrophoretic methods are slow, cumbersome and complex but they can provide confirmation that the trends and numbers arising from the new gene arrays are reliable. In this overview, we compare gene array data with data from protein activity assays such as zymograms, Western blots, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and immunohistochemistry. Similar or complementary data from the same heart tissues analyzed by either microarrays or macroarrays can be reassuring to those interested in reliable molecular analyses of normal and failing hearts.

A novel Prx1 antibody was produced to define the normal Prx1 protein expression pattern in the developing mouse embryo. In craniofacial and limb mesenchyme, Prx1 protein expression is consistent with previously published data on RNA localization. However, a remarkable discrepancy was found in cardiac tissue. Prx1 protein is undetectable in the murine embryonic and adult heart, despite the presence of Prx1 transcripts. These data demonstrate that Prx1 expression is posttranscriptionally regulated. This discrepancy between the presence of Prx1 transcript and the absence of detectable protein was also observed in embryonic chick heart, suggesting conservation of the regulatory mechanism in vertebrates.

This has been demonstrated by molecular detection of enteroviral RNA in human heart tissue, serologic associations with disease, and virus isolation from cases of fulminant myocarditis. The murine model of CVB-associated myocarditis has demonstrated that CVB can be attenuated through mutations at different genomic sites. Human CVB3 isolates demonstrate varying degrees of cardiovirulence in the murine model; one site of virulence determination has been mapped to domain II of the 5' non-translated region. The interplay of CVB replication and the immune response to that replication in the heart is a complex interaction determining the extent to which the virus replication is limited and the degree to which a pathogenic inflammation of cardiac muscle occurs. Studies of CVB3-induced myocarditis in murine strains lacking subsets of the immune system or genes regulating the immune response have demonstrated a pivotal role of the T cell response to the generation of myocarditis. While CVB are associated with 20-25% of cases of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the severity of the disease and the existence of attenuated strains shown to generate protective immunity in animal models indicates that vaccination against the CVBs would be valuable.", "journal": "Reviews in medical virology", "date": "2001-12-18", "authors": ["K SKim", "GHufnagel", "N MChapman", "STracy"], "doi": "10.1002/rmv.326"}

Since studies concerning the immunocytochemical localization of endothelin are often inconsistent we tried to clear up some of these discrepancies by comparing specificity and labeling patterns of different endothelin antibodies. Monoclonal and polyclonal endothelin antibodies ( n=7) were examined concerning their reactivity with endothelins and heart tissues by immunoblotting. Using immunofluorescence microscopy reactivities with human non-failing hearts, failing hearts, and cultured endothelial cells were examined. Specificity of labelings was assessed by absorption controls and functional controls using endothelial cells conditioned to produce different amounts of endothelin. As shown by immunoblotting five out of seven endothelin antibodies revealed both specific endothelin reactivity and negligible non-specific reactivities with heart proteins. Immunocytochemistry showed vascular reactivity of N-terminal endothelin antibodies to be associated with alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. One N-terminal antibody showed additional nuclear reactivity, and one C-terminal antibody vimentin-like labeling patterns. Although these reactivities were abolished in absorption controls these labelings had to be graded non-specific because functional specificity of endothelin antibodies could not be proven. The remaining antibodies revealed no endothelial reactivity even after tyramide signal amplification. Cellular endothelin concentrations ranged around 2,000-fold below the detection limit of immunocytochemical methods.

In the present study, broilers reared under cool temperature conditions (16 C) were provided tap water (control group), tap water supplemented with taurine, or tap water supplemented with the taurine transport antagonist beta-alanine. When compared with control values, taurine supplementation consistently elevated free taurine concentrations in the plasma but not in cardiac tissues, whereas beta-alanine supplementation consistently reduced free taurine concentrations in cardiac tissues but not in the plasma. Neither the incidence of PHS nor specific predictors of PHS susceptibility (electrocardiogram Lead II S-wave amplitude, % saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen, heart rate, right to total ventricular weight ratio) were affected by taurine or beta-alanine supplementation. Cardiopulmonary hemodynamic evaluations were conducted to compare control and beta-alanine supplemented broilers breathing room air or air containing 12% oxygen (low oxygen challenge). While breathing room air, the betaalanine-supplemented broilers had higher baseline values for cardiac output (186.2 vs. 146.9 mL/min/kg BW) and pulmonary arterial pressure (27.4 vs. 22.4 mm Hg), similar values for mean systemic arterial pressure (100 vs. 104 mm Hg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (0.062 vs. 0.064 resistance units), and lower values for total peripheral resistance (0.228 vs. 0.296 resistance units) when compared with control broilers breathing room air. During low oxygen challenges, the beta-alanine-supplemented broilers exhibited larger reductions in cardiac output, mean systemic arterial pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure and greater increases in pulmonary vascular resistance than control broilers. These observations indicate that beta-alanine-supplemented broilers breathing room air had a higher systemic demand for oxygen as evidenced by their lower total peripheral resistance (systemic vasodilation) and had a capacity sufficient to pump a higher cardiac output and, thereby, maintain a similar mean systemic arterial pressure when compared with control broilers. However, cardiac function rapidly deteriorated in beta-alanine-supplemented broilers during low oxygen challenges, leading to substantially greater reductions in cardiac output, stroke volume, and mean systemic arterial pressure when compared with control broilers. Concurrent changes in pulmonary arterial pressure within the beta-alanine group reflect interactions between cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance.

The proliferative effect of 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) was examined in aortic pC-SMC by [3H]thymidine incorporation and by cell counting. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS activity was estimated in aortic endothelial lining and in heart tissue homogenates by conversion of [3H]arginine into [3H]citrulline.

Because S100A1 is known to modulate SR Ca(2+) handling in skeletal muscle, we sought to investigate the specific role of S100A1 in the regulation of myocardial contractility. To address this issue, we investigated contractile properties of adult cardiomyocytes as well as of engineered heart tissue after S100A1 adenoviral gene transfer. S100A1 gene transfer resulted in a significant increase of unloaded shortening and isometric contraction in isolated cardiomyocytes and engineered heart tissues, respectively. Analysis of intracellular Ca(2+) cycling in S100A1-overexpressing cardiomyocytes revealed a significant increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) transients, whereas in functional studies on saponin-permeabilized adult cardiomyocytes, the addition of S100A1 protein significantly enhanced SR Ca(2+) uptake. Moreover, in Triton-skinned ventricular trabeculae, S100A1 protein significantly decreased myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity ([EC(50%)]) and Ca(2+) cooperativity, whereas maximal isometric force remained unchanged. Our data suggest that S100A1 effects are cAMP independent because cellular cAMP levels and protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban were not altered, and carbachol failed to suppress S100A1 actions. These results show that S100A1 overexpression enhances cardiac contractile performance and establish the concept of S100A1 as a regulator of myocardial contractility. S100A1 thus improves cardiac contractile performance both by regulating SR Ca(2+) handling and myofibrillar Ca(2+) responsiveness.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2001-11-22", "authors": ["PMost", "JBernotat", "PEhlermann", "S TPleger", "MReppel", "MB\u00f6rries", "FNiroomand", "BPieske", "P MJanssen", "TEschenhagen", "PKarczewski", "G LSmith", "W JKoch", "H AKatus", "ARemppis"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.241393598"}

Cardiac fibrosis is a major determinant of diastolic dysfunction and pumping capacity, and it may provide the structural substrate for arrhythmogenicity, thus potentially contributing the to progression of heart failure and sudden death. Aldosterone was shown to promote cardiac fibrosis in various experimental models. It was demonstrated that spironolactone may oppose the effect of aldosterone in promoting cardiac fibrosis. Measurement of cardiac collagen turnover by use of serological markers is a useful tool for monitoring cardiac tissue repair and fibrosis in experimental models or clinical conditions. We found that high serum levels of a marker of collagen turnover (procollagen type III N-terminal peptide ) in patients with chronic heart failure receiving conventional therapy, including ACE inhibitors, was associated with high mortality and hospitalization rates. In RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study), in patients randomized to placebo, markers continued to increase or remained unchanged after 6-month follow-up. On the contrary, adding spironolactone 25 mg daily significantly decreased the levels of these serum markers during the same period. Most importantly, the spironolactone-related morbidity and mortality benefit was most predominant in subgroups with highest baseline levels of serum markers.

These vary with respect to which renin-angiotensin system components are synthesized locally and which are taken up from plasma. Enzymes unrelated to the classical renin-angiotensin system may also contribute to tissue angiotensin synthesis. However, based on the available data, the prevailing opinion that kidney-derived renin is in all cases the only physiologically relevant renin in tissues must be revised. Also there is evidence indicating a role for tissue angiotensin systems in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and in cardiovascular structural remodeling. The angiotensin-regulated synthesis of aldosterone in cardiac tissue has been described, suggesting the possibility that a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system exists in the heart. In addition, intracellular (intracrine) sites of angiotensin action have been reported. Some of these findings have implications for therapeutics and, in particular, for the use of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels were lower, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were higher, in transgenic mice irrespective of gender, whereas only transgenic male mice had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Total serum apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels were not affected, but the amount of apoB in the LDL fraction was higher in transgenic mice. Hepatic LDL receptor expression was unchanged, whereas apoB mRNA editing and hepatic triglyceride secretion rate were reduced in bGH-transgenic male mice. Both lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose and heart tissue and beta-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis were increased in transgenic male mice. The relative weight of adipose tissue was lower in transgenic mice, whereas hepatic triglyceride content was unchanged.

{"title": "Entrainment by an extracellular AC stimulus in a computational model of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue can be entrained when subjected to sinusoidal stimuli, often responding with action potentials sustained for the duration of the stimulus. To investigate mechanisms responsible for both entrainment and extended action potential duration, computer simulations of a two-dimensional grid of cardiac cells subjected to sinusoidal extracellular stimulation were performed.\nThe tissue is represented as a bidomain with unequal anisotropy ratios. Cardiac membrane dynamics are governed by a modified Beeler-Reuter model. The stimulus, delivered by a bipolar electrode, has a duration of 750 to 1,000 msec, an amplitude range of 800 to 3,200 microA/cm, and a frequency range of 10 to 60 Hz. The applied stimuli create virtual electrode polarization (VEP) throughout the sheet. The simulations demonstrate that periodic extracellular stimulation results in entrainment of the tissue. This phase-locking of the membrane potential to the stimulus is dependent on the location in the sheet and the magnitude of the stimulus. Near the electrodes, the oscillations are 1:1 or 1:2 phase-locked; at the middle of the sheet, the oscillations are 1:2 or 1:4 phase-locked and occur on the extended plateau of an action potential. The 1:2 behavior near the electrodes is due to periodic change in the voltage gradient between VEP of opposite polarity; at the middle of the sheet, it is due to spread of electrotonic current following the collision of a propagating wave with refractory tissue.\nThe simulations suggest that formation of VEP in cardiac tissue subjected to periodic extracellular stimulation is of paramount importance to tissue entrainment and formation of an extended oscillatory action potential plateau.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2001-11-09", "authors": ["J MMeunier", "N ATrayanova", "R AGray"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1540-8167.2001.01176.x"}

{"title": "Mechanistic insights into very slow conduction in branching cardiac tissue: a model study.", "abstract": "It is known that branching strands of cardiac tissue can form a substrate for very slow conduction. The branches slow conduction by acting as current loads drawing depolarizing current from the main strand (\"pull\" effect). It has been suggested that, upon depolarization of the branches, they become current sources reinjecting current back into the strand, thus enhancing propagation safety (\"push\" effect). It was the aim of this study to verify this hypothesis and to assess the contribution of the push effect to propagation velocity and safety. Conduction was investigated in strands of Luo-Rudy dynamic model cells that branch from either a single branch point or from multiple successive branch points. In single-branching strands, blocking the push effect by not allowing current to flow retrogradely from the branches into the strand did not significantly increase the branching-induced local propagation delay. However, in multiple branching strands, blocking the push effect resulted in a significant slowing of overall conduction velocity or even in conduction failure. Furthermore, for certain slow velocities, the safety factor for propagation was higher when slow conduction was caused by branching tissue geometry than by reduced excitability without branching. Therefore, these results confirm the proposed \"pull and push\" mechanism of slow, but nevertheless robust, conduction in branching structures. Slow conduction based on this mechanism could occur in the atrioventricular node, where multiple branching is structurally present. It could also support reentrant excitation in diseased myocardium where the substrate is structurally complex.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2001-10-27", "authors": ["J PKucera", "YRudy"], "doi": "10.1161/hh2101.098442"}

Ultrastructural lesions were characterized by degeneration and necrosis of cardiac muscle cells and Purkinje fibers. Virus was present intracytoplasmically in cardiac muscle cells, Purkinje fibers, and endothelial cells of capillaries and intranuclearly in cardiac muscle cells. The cell membranes of the Purkinje fibers and endothelial cells had distinct protrusions that contained virus particles.

Although the CysLT(1) receptor mediates the proinflammatory effects of leukotrienes in human asthma, the physiological roles of CysLT(2) receptor are not defined, and a suitable mouse model would be useful in delineating function. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of the mouse CysLT(2) receptor (mCysLT(2)R) from heart tissue. mCysLT(2)R cDNA encodes a protein of 309 amino acids, truncated at both ends compared with the human ortholog (hCysLT(2)R). The gene resides on the central region of mouse chromosome 14 and is composed of 6 exons with the entire coding region located in the last exon. Two 5'-untranslated region splice variants were identified with the short form lacking exon 3 as the predominant transcript. Although the overall expression of mCysLT(2)R is very low, the highest expression was detected in spleen, thymus, and adrenal gland by ribonuclease protection assay, and discrete sites of expression in heart were observed by in situ hybridization. Intracellular calcium mobilization in response to cysteinyl leukotriene administration was detected in human embryonic kidney 293T cells transfected with recombinant mCysLT(2)R with a rank order of potency leukotriene C(4)(LTC(4) ) = LTD(4)>>LTE(4).

{"title": "Increased plasma endothelin-1 and cardiac nitric oxide during doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "The major limiting factor in long-term administration of doxorubicin is the development of cumulative dose-dependent cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Although several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the exact cause of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, the role of the vascular endothelium-derived vasoactive mediators in the pathophysiology of this toxic effect is still unknown. Accordingly, the present study has been initiated to investigate whether the changes in plasma level of endothelin-1 and nitric oxide along with cardiac nitric oxide are associated with the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Doxorubicin was injected with a single dose of 5 mg/kg and every other day with a dose of 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, to have four cumulative doses of, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg/kg in five separate groups of male rats. An additional group receiving a single dose of 20 mg/kg and one receiving normal saline were also included in the study. Twenty-four hr after the last dose, the animals were sacrificed and the plasma levels of endothelin-1 and nitric oxide in addition to cardiac nitric oxide were determined. The results show that doxorubicin caused a statistically significant increase of 85%, 76% and 97% in plasma endothelin-1 at a cumulative dose levels of 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. However, the level of plasma nitric oxide remained unchanged. Furthermore, doxorubicin treatment resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase. In contrast, the increase in nitric oxide production in cardiac tissue by doxorubicin was not dose-dependent with the maximum increase (81%) at a cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg. It is worth mentioning that plasma endothelin-1 and cardiac nitric oxide were significantly increased at 24 hr after the single dose of 20 mg/kg doxorubicin. The increase of plasma endothelin-1 and cardiac nitric oxide with the cardiomyopathy enzymatic indices, may point to the conclusion that both endothelin-1 and cardiac nitric oxide are increased during the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Pharmacology & toxicology", "date": "2001-10-09", "authors": ["M MSayed-Ahmed", "M MKhattab", "M ZGad", "A MOsman"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1600-0773.2001.d01-148.x"}

L-294 increased in a dose-dependent manner the spontaneous contractions of isolated hearts from Wistar rats with maximal effect (128.0+/-0.7% of control) observed at 25 microM. 3. The positive inotropic effect of L-294 was also observed in electrically stimulated cardiac tissues from Wistar rats. The maximal increment of twitches, at 200 microM, was 163.1+/-18.4% for atrial, 153.5+/-28.5% for papillary and 201.5+/-18.5% for ventricular muscles. 4. In saponin skinned ventricular cells: (a) L-294 present in the period of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) loading with Ca(2+) shifted the dose and caffeine-induced contracture curve; (b) L-294 (100 microM) increased 40% the Ca(2+) uptake into SR; (c) L-294 did not significantly alter the sensitivity of contractile proteins to Ca(2+) in SR-disrupted skinned ventricular cells. 5.

This paper explores a new hypothesis: the insulated plunge electrodes used in experiments to map the extracellular potential may affect the transmembrane potential when an electric field is applied to cardiac tissue. Our calculation simulates a 10-mm-diameter sheet of passive tissue with a circular insulated plunge electrode in the middle of it, ranging in diameter from 0.05 to 2 mm. We calculate the transmembrane potential induced by a 500-V/m electric field. Our results show that a transmembrane potential is induced around the electrode in alternating areas of depolarization and hyperpolarization. If the electric field is oriented parallel to the myocardial fibers, the maximum transmembrane potential is 89 mV. A layer of fluid around the electrode increases the transmembrane potential. We conclude that plunge electrodes may introduce artifacts during experiments designed to study the response of the heart to strong electric shocks.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2001-10-05", "authors": ["D MLangrill", "B JRoth"], "doi": "10.1109/10.951525"}

The spatial localization of the fluorescence signal for these two methods is unknown and may depend upon light absorption and scattering at both excitation and emission wavelengths. We measured the absorption coefficients (micro a), scattering coefficients (micro s), and scattering anisotropy coefficients (g) at representative excitation and emission wavelengths in rabbit heart tissue stained with di-4-ANEPPS or co-stained with both Rh237 and Oregon Green 488 BAPTA 1. Monte Carlo models were then used to simulate absorption and scattering of excitation light and fluorescence emission light for both broad-field and laser methods in three-dimensional tissue. Contributions of local emissions throughout the tissue to fluorescence collected from the tissue surface were determined for both methods.

Latest developments have brought this technology to a widespread use. In this paper we discuss its usefulness especially for the study of the genetic component in congenital heart disease as a model of multifactorial disease and the possible clinical applications in the near future. Malformations of the heart and blood vessels account for the largest number of human birth defects. The susceptibility of the heart to developmental anomalies reflects the complexity of the morphogenetic events responsible for the heart formation. The genetics of congenital heart disease points to the existence of powerful disease modifiers. Tissue analysis of gene expression with cDNA microarrays provides a measure of transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation. Large-scale partial sequencing of cDNA libraries generating expressed sequence tags is an effective means of discovering novel genes and characterizing transcription patterns in different organs and tissues. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of genes expressed in cardiac tissue by means of comparison of expression patterns related to the normal and to the pathological tissue may be of great importance for the study of cardiac pathologies.

{"title": "Cardioreparation in hypertensive heart disease.", "abstract": "The normal myocardium is composed of a variety of cells. Cardiac myocytes, tethered within an extracellular matrix of fibrillar collagen, represent one third of all cells; noncardiomyocytes account for the remaining two thirds. Ventricular hypertrophy involves myocyte growth. Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) includes myocyte and nonmyocyte growth that leads to an adverse structural remodeling of the intramural coronary vasculature and matrix. In HHD, it is not the quantity of myocardium but rather its quality that accounts for increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Structural homogeneity of cardiac tissue is governed by a balanced equilibrium existing between stimulator and inhibitor signals that regulate cell growth, apoptosis, phenotype, and matrix turnover. Stimulators (eg, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and endothelins) are normally counterbalanced by inhibitors (eg, bradykinin, NO, and prostaglandins) in a paradigm of reciprocal regulation. To reduce the risk of heart failure and sudden cardiac death that accompanies HHD, its adverse structural remodeling must be targeted for pharmacologic intervention. Cardioprotective agents counteract the imbalance between stimulators and inhibitors. They include ACE and endopeptidase inhibitors and respective receptor antagonists. Cardioreparative agents reverse the growth-promoting state and regress existing abnormalities in coronary vascular and matrix structure. ACE inhibition has achieved this outcome with favorable impact on vasomotor reactivity and tissue stiffness. Today's management of hypertension should not simply focus on a reduction in blood pressure, it must also target the adverse structural remodeling that begets HHD.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2001-09-22", "authors": ["K TWeber"], "doi": "10.1161/01.hyp.38.3.588"}
{"title": "Functional role of endogenous endothelin-1 in congestive heart failure treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonist.", "abstract": "Interactions between angiotensin (ANG) II and endothelin (ET)-1 receptor transduction pathways have been unclear in congestive heart failure (CHF). Therefore the objects of this study are, in CHF, whether production of ET-1 is modulated by ANG II and/or whether hemodynamic effects of endogenous ET-1 are modulated by ANG II. Twelve dogs were randomly assigned to two groups: untreated (n = 6) and treated with ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (TCV116, 1.5 mg/kg/d) (n = 6). After rapid ventricular pacing (240 bpm) for 4 weeks, plasma and cardiac ET-1 levels were compared between the two groups. Acute hemodynamic effects of a nonspecific ET(A&B) receptor antagonist, TAK044 (3 mg/kg plus 3 mg/kg/h i.v.) were examined in both groups by a conductance catheter and a micromanometer. After 4 weeks of pacing, plasma and cardiac tissue ET-1 levels were elevated in both groups to a similar degree. In the group treated with TCV116, TAK044 produced an increase in stroke volume and a decrease in total systemic resistance; heart rate was unchanged. The time constant of left ventricular (LV) relaxation was significantly decreased. The slope of LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation (E(ES)) was increased (p < 0.05), indicating an increased LV contractility. Thus endogenous ET-1 produces an arterial vasoconstriction and impairs LV contractility and relaxation in CHF with AT1 receptor antagonism. These hemodynamic responses to TAK044 in CHF treated with TCV116 were similar in untreated CHF. These results suggest that the production of ET-1 and the cardiac effects of endogenous ET-1 in CHF may be unaffected by ANG II acting through AT1 receptors.", "journal": "The Japanese journal of physiology", "date": "2001-09-21", "authors": ["KDohi", "KOnishi", "TKitamura", "TOkinaka", "MIto", "NIsaka", "TNakano"], "doi": "10.2170/jjphysiol.51.445"}

The aim of our study was to verify in human ischemic and reperfused cardiac tissue the relationship between mitochondrial enzyme activities and the activation of HSP70 and c-fos syntheses in the context of a cytoprotective mechanism. Nitric oxide (NO) modulating effects on mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities in ischemic and reperfused tissue were investigated (preliminary report).\nDuring elective coronary artery bypass grafting, in 30 consecutive patients ventricle samples were taken one before aortic clamping the second after 55+/-8 min ischemic period and the third 34+/-5 after final reperfusion. Coronary sinus blood samples were taken in parallel to assess free radical release measured by malonaldehyde (MDA) levels. In a small number of patients (N=5) nitric oxide tissue levels were analyzed.\nWhen compared with normoxic tissue, a significant decrease in cytochrome Coxidase (COX) and succinate Cyt-c reductase (SCR) activities in ischemic and reperfused samples were observed. The activation of HSP70-72 and c-fos transcription factor was evident in courses of ischemia and reperfusion. Blood MDA levels underline the concept that oxyradical generation characterize the peroxidative damage in reoxygenated myocardial tissue while adaptive changes which occur in ischemic cells seem to antagonize the oxyradical injury.\nIn the course of heart surgery the myocardial cell seems to prevent ischemic damage by activating some peculiar biomolecular and biochemical adaptive changes which permit the reversibility of the oxidative injury. In contrast it appears evident that massive and rapid reoxygenation of the cardiac tissue leads to peroxidative damage due to oxyradical generation. Nitric oxide seems to play a crucial role in cellular adaptation to ischemia even if further studies will be needed to elucidate these findings.

{"title": "Pathophysiological significance and clinical application of ANP and BNP in patients with heart failure.", "abstract": "Plasma levels of ANP and BNP increase in accordance with the severity of the heart failure. In severe cases, the amount of BNP secreted surpasses that of ANP. The main secretion site of BNP is the ventricles, and that of ANP is the atria. However, ANP is also secreted from the ventricles as heart failure advances, and thus the ventricles are important sites for both BNP and ANP. It is well known that myocardial stretch is a key factor in the stimulation of the secretion of ANP and BNP, although neurohumoral factors also play a role in the secretion mechanism. The major physiological effects of ANP and BNP are vasodilation, natriuresis, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) and the sympathetic nervous systems; all of which are supposed to suppress the progression of heart failure. The inhibitory action of ANP and BNP on the RAA system has been considered to be an extra-cardiac effect. We recently reported the activation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme and aldosterone production in failing human hearts. ANP and BNP, however, would inhibit aldosterone production, not only in the adrenal cortex but also in cardiac tissue. ANP, and especially BNP, are useful markers of the heart's status during treatment for heart failure.

These predictions were experimentally confirmed by optical mapping studies of transmembrane potentials while no direct validation is reported at the extracellular level. The present study aims at defining the influence of the virtual cathode on extracellular potentials by means of high-density epicardial mapping.\nEpicardial potentials were measured in seven exposed rat hearts by means of a 11 x 11 electrode array with 360 x 540 microns resolution. Cathodal current pulses, 100-200 microA intensity and 1 ms duration, to avoid superposition of stimulus and activation potentials, were delivered from one of the electrode array and unipolar potentials were measured from all other electrodes.\na) During stimulus, negative equipotential lines were elliptic along fibers, as expected, but for a 2 mm circular region at the pacing site. b) During 1-2 ms interval between stimulus offset and start of activation, equipotential lines became elliptic across fibers in the presence of the region directly excited by the stimulus field. Start of activation was either symmetric with isochrones initially circular around the pacing site and then elliptic along fibers, or asymmetric initiating at only one side of the pacing site across fibers with isochrones elliptic along fibers. In the latter case, the wave front was blocked through the refractory region directly excited by the stimulus field, subdivided into two wings which collided and merged at the opposite side, giving rise to a plane wave front propagating across fibers away from the pacing site.\nHigh spatial resolution epicardial potential mapping reveals the existence of the virtual cathode and its influence on impulse initiation and conduction. The unexpected existence of a region of conduction block at the pacing site, due to spatial asymmetry of normal cardiac tissue which enhances activation threshold at one of the two sides of the virtual cathode, is intriguing since it is one of the requirements for reentry of conduction in the presence of a circuit with decreased conduction velocity and short duration of refractory period.", "journal": "Acta bio-medica de L'Ateneo parmense : organo della Societa di medicina e scienze naturali di Parma", "date": "2001-09-14", "authors": ["EMacchi", "SBaruffi", "ABondavalli", "FCacciani", "MMiragoli", "MManghi", "EMusso", "GOlivetti", "MRota", "DStilli", "MZaniboni"], "doi": null}

Pharmacological activators and inhibitors allowed us to characterize the signaling pathways involved in alphaB crystallin phosphorylation during ischemia. Ischemic preconditioning alone caused 30% of the heart's alphaB crystallin pool to translocate, providing a significant translocation 'head-start' in protected tissue. This enhanced translocation is coupled with increased (3-fold) alphaB crystallin phosphorylation at both serine residues. The possible role of alphaB crystallin in the protection afforded by ischemic preconditioning is supported by the signal transduction data; which showed preconditioning-induced alphaB crystallin phosphorylation can be blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibition (using genistein) and by p38 MAP kinase or PKC inhibition (using SB203580 or bisindolylmaleimide, respectively). The activation of both p38 MAP kinase and PKC are recognized requirements for the induction of preconditioning and their inhibition is known to block protection. Western immunoblotting analysis after isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, confirmed the observations made with the phosphospecific antibodies; but also showed that 27+/-4% of total cardiac crystallin was phosphorylated after 30 min of ischemia. AlphaB crystallin exists as large polymeric aggregates in cardiac tissue under basal conditions (approximately 1 MDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography). We induced phosphorylation of alphaB crystallin during aerobic perfusion by the administration of phenylephrine. However this treatment did not alter the molecular aggregate size of alphaB crystallin. It appears that alphaB crystallin molecular aggregate size is not simply regulated by phosphorylation.

In this study, we examined the localization of the molecules involved in alpha1-adrenergic receptor signal relative to that of caveolin in the heart and the changes in caveolin expression during the development of hypertrophy in SHR.\nWe purified the caveolar protein fractions from rat cardiac tissues, H9C2 cells, and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Using radioligand receptor binding assay and immunoblot analysis, we examined the distribution and the amount of alpha1-AR and caveolin.\nCaveolin-3, the alpha1-adrenergic receptor, Gq and PLC-beta subtypes (PLC-beta1, -beta3) were found exclusively in the caveolar fraction in the above tissues. Caveolin-3 were co-immunoprecipitated with alpha1-adrenergic receptor and Gq from the cardiac tissues. The amount of caveolin subtypes expression (caveolin-1 and -3) and the amount of the alpha1-adrenergic receptor were examined in the hearts of SHR and age-matched WKY (4- and 24-weeks-old). The amount of caveolin-3 expression was significantly smaller in SHR at 24-weeks-old than that in SHR at 4-weeks-old and that in WKY at 24-weeks-old.\nThe molecules involved in alpha1-adrenergic signaling are confined to the same microdomain as caveolin.

Hypercholesterolaemia was induced by feeding rabbits 2% cholesterol-enriched diet for 28 days, whereas, carnitine deficiency was induced by daily i.p. administration of 250 mg kg(-1) of D-carnitine for 28 days. Histopathological examination of aorta and coronaries from hypercholesterolaemic rabbits revealed severe atherosclerotic lesions, intimal plaques and foam cell formation. Also, hypercholesterolaemic diet resulted in a significant 53 and 43% decrease in reduced glutathion (GSH) levels and a significant (1.87-fold) and (14.1-fold) increase in malonedialdhyde (MDA) levels in aorta and cardiac tissues, respectively. Daily administration of L-carnitine (250 mg kg(-1)) for 28 days, completely prevented the progression of atherosclerotic lesions induced by hpercholesterolaemia in both aorta and coronaries. Conversely, daily administration of D-carnitine (250 mg kg(-1)) for 28 days increased the progression of atherosclerotic lesions with the appearance of foam cells and apparent intimal plaques which are even larger than that seen in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits. Both L-carnitine and D-carnitine produced similar effects on the lipid profile, GSH and MDA which may point to the conclusion that: (1) L-carnitine prevents the progression of atherosclerotic lesions by another mechanism in addition to its antioxidant and lipid-lowering effects; (2) endogenous carnitine depletion and/or carnitine deficiency should be viewed as an additional risk factor in atherogenesis.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2001-09-01", "authors": ["M MSayed-Ahmed", "M MKhattab", "M ZGad", "NMostafa"], "doi": "10.1006/phrs.2001.0852"}
{"title": "Dynamics of travelling waves in visual perception.", "abstract": "Nonlinear wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, appearing in chemical reaction kinetics, cardiac tissue dynamics, cortical spreading depression and slow wave sleep. The application of dynamical modelling has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying such nonlinear wave phenomena in several domains. Wave propagation can also be perceived as sweeping waves of visibility that occur when the two eyes view radically different stimuli. Termed binocular rivalry, these fluctuating states of perceptual dominance and suppression are thought to provide a window into the neural dynamics that underlie conscious visual awareness. Here we introduce a technique to measure the speed of rivalry dominance waves propagating around a large, essentially one-dimensional annulus. When mapped onto visual cortex, propagation speed is independent of eccentricity. Propagation speed doubles when waves travel along continuous contours, thus demonstrating effects of collinear facilitation. A neural model with reciprocal inhibition between two layers of units provides a quantitative explanation of dominance wave propagation in terms of disinhibition. Dominance waves provide a new tool for investigating fundamental cortical dynamics.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2001-08-31", "authors": ["H RWilson", "RBlake", "S HLee"], "doi": "10.1038/35091066"}

Since gap junctions provide the syncytial properties of the atrium, changes in expression and distribution of intercellular connections may accompany the chronification of AF.\nAtrial tissues isolated from 12 patients in normal sinus rhythm at the time of cardiac surgery and from 12 patients with chronic AF were processed for immunohistology and immunoblotting for the detection of the gap junction proteins. The functional study of the cardiac tissue anisotropy was performed in rat atria in which AF was induced by 24 h of rapid pacing (10 Hz).\nImmunoblotting revealed that AF did not induce any significant change in Cx43 content in human atria. In contrast, a 2.7-fold increase in expression of Cx40 was observed in AF. Immunohistologic analysis indicated that AF resulted in an increase in the immunostaining of both connexins at the lateral membrane of human atrial cells. A similar spatial redistribution of the Cx43 signal was seen in isolated rat atria with experimentally-induced AF. In addition, AF in rat atria resulted in decreased anisotropy with slightly enhanced transverse conduction velocity.\nThis experimental study showed that AF is accompanied by spatial remodeling of gap junctions that might induce changes in the biophysical properties of the tissue.", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "date": "2001-08-31", "authors": ["LPolontchouk", "J AHaefliger", "BEbelt", "TSchaefer", "DStuhlmann", "UMehlhorn", "FKuhn-Regnier", "E RDe Vivie", "SDhein"], "doi": "10.1016/s0735-1097(01)01443-7"}
{"title": "Effect of fibre rotation on the initiation of re-entry in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Transmural rotation of cardiac fibres can have a big influence on the initiation of re-entry in the heart. However, owing to computational demands, this has not been fully explored in a three-dimensional model of cardiac tissue that has a microscopic description of membrane currents, such as the Luo-Rudy model. Using a previously described model that is computationally fast, re-entry in three-dimensional blocks of cardiac tissue is induced by a cross-shock protocol, and the activity is examined. In the study, the effect of the transmural fibre rotation is ascertained by examining differences between a tissue block with no rotation and ones with 1, 2 and 3 degrees of rotation per fibre layer. The direction of the re-entry is significant in establishing whether or not re-entry can be induced, with clockwise re-entry being easier to initiate. Owing to the rotating anisotropy that results in preferential propagation along the fibre axis, the timing of the second stimulus in the cross-shock protocol has to be changed for different rates of fibre rotation. The fibre rotation either increases or decreases the window of opportunity for re-entry, depending on whether the activation front is perpendicular or parallel to the fibre direction. By varying the transmural extent of the S2, it is found that a deeper stimulus has to be applied to the blocks with fibre rotation to create re-entry. Increasing the transmural resistance also tends to reduce the extent of the S2 required to induce re-entry. Results suggest that increasing fibre rotation reduces the susceptibility of the tissue to re-entry, but that more complex spatiotemporal patterns are possible, e.g. stable figure-of-eight re-entries and transient rotors. Three mechanisms of re-entry annihilation are identified: front catchup, filling of the excitable gap and core wander.", "journal": "Medical & biological engineering & computing", "date": "2001-08-29", "authors": ["E JVigmond", "L JLeon"], "doi": "10.1007/BF02345368"}

Doxorubicin induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. This expression of COX-2 limits doxorubicin-induced cardiac cell injury, raising the possibility that the administration of a prostaglandin may protect the heart during the in vivo administration of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin (15 mg/kg) administered to adult male Sprague Dawley rats induced COX-2 expression and activity in cardiac tissue. Prostacyclin generation measured as the excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF(1alpha) also increased, and this was blocked by a COX-2 inhibitor, SC236. In contrast, administration of a COX-1 inhibitor SC560 at a dose that reduced serum thromboxane B2 by more than 80% did not prevent the doxorubicin-induced increase in prostacyclin generation. Doxorubicin increased cardiac injury, detected as a rise in plasma cardiac troponin T, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis; this was aggravated by coadministration of SC236 but not SC560. The degree of injury in animals treated with a combination of doxorubicin and SC236 was attenuated by prior administration of the prostacyclin analogue iloprost.

Early generation of nitric oxide and delayed induction of nitric oxide synthase have been implicated in mediating delayed cardioprotection after ischemic preconditioning in rabbits. Recent evidence indicates that some of the regulatory roles of adenosine in cardiac tissue may be mediated by A1R-induced generation of nitric oxide. This study examined the role of nitric oxide in the mediation of A1R-induced delayed preconditioning against infarction. Pharmacologic preconditioning of rabbits with the selective A1R agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine 100 microg/kg (CCPA) significantly reduced myocardial infarct size compared with control animals, after 30 min regional ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in vivo 24 h later (27.3+/-4.7 vs. 46.0+/-3.7%, respectively; p = 0.001). Nonselective inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10 mg/kg) before administration of CCPA did not affect this infarct limitation at 24 h. Selective inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase before the prolonged ischemic insult on day 2, with two structurally independent inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine (10 mg/kg) or aminoguanidine (300 mg/kg), did not abrogate the reduction in infarction observed by pharmacologic preconditioning with CCPA 24 h earlier. These results suggest that the second window or delayed protection against myocardial infarction observed 24 h after pharmacologic preconditioning with an adenosine A1 agonist occurs independently of either early generation of nitric oxide or subacute induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2001-08-03", "authors": ["ADana", "G FBaxter", "D MYellon"], "doi": "10.1097/00005344-200108000-00014"}

Experimental data indicate that cytokines are involved in controlling CVB3 replication. Therefore, recombinant CVB3 (CVB3rec) variants expressing the T-helper-1 (T(H)1)-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) or the T(H)2-specific interleukin-10 (IL-10) as well as the control virus CVB3(muIL-10), which produce only biologically inactive IL-10, were established. Coding regions of murine cytokines were cloned into the 5' end of the CVB3 wild type (CVB3wt) open reading frame and were supplied with an artificial viral 3Cpro-specific Q-G cleavage site. Correct processing releases active cytokines, and the concentration of IFN-gamma and IL-10 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and bioassays. In mice, CVB3wt was detectable in pancreas and heart tissue, causing massive destruction of the exocrine pancreas as well as myocardial inflammation and heart cell lysis. Most of the CVB3wt-infected mice revealed virus-associated symptoms, and some died within 28 days postinfection. In contrast, CVB3rec variants were present only in the pancreas of infected mice, causing local inflammation with subsequent healing. Four weeks after the first infection, surviving mice were challenged with the lethal CVB3H3 variant, causing casualties in the CVB3wt- and CVB3(muIL-10)-infected groups, whereas almost none of the CVB3(IFN-gamma)- and CVB3(IL-10)-infected mice died and no pathological disorders were detectable.

Pretreatment with atropine (24 mg/kg) blocked the DEP-induced fall in blood pressure, while pretreatment with propranolol (48 mg/kg) proved ineffective against DEP, suggesting involvement of the parasympathetic system.

Why the heart would express these \"lipoprotein assembly\" genes has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that the beating mouse heart actually secretes spherical lipoproteins. Moreover, increased cardiac production of lipoproteins (e.g., in mice that express a human apolipoprotein B transgene) was associated with increased triglyceride secretion from the heart and decreased stores of triglycerides within the heart. Increased cardiac production of lipoproteins also reduced the pathological accumulation of triglycerides that occurs in the hearts of mice lacking long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase. In contrast, blocking heart lipoprotein secretion (e.g., in heart-specific microsomal triglyceride transfer protein knockout mice) increased cardiac triglyceride stores. Thus, heart lipoprotein secretion helps regulate cardiac triglyceride stores and may protect the heart from the detrimental effects of surplus lipids.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2001-08-02", "authors": ["JBjorkegren", "MV\u00e9niant", "S KKim", "S KWithycombe", "P AWood", "M KHellerstein", "R ANeese", "S GYoung"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M106839200"}

DMD is a fatal disorder, with a significant proportion of fatalities associated with cardiac failure ( approximately 40% having dilated cardiomyopathy and >90% clinically significant cardiac defects at death). In this study, the metabolic composition of intact dystrophic cardiac tissue was investigated using high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HRMAS) (1)H NMR spectroscopy with both 1- and 2D pulse sequences coupled with pattern recognition (PR). While conventional solvent presaturation spectra indicated increases in CH(2) chain length in lipids, PR analysis of correlation spectroscopy (COSY) spectra demonstrated that this was also accompanied by an increase in concentration of lactate or threonine along with a relative decrease in CH = CHCH(2)CO groups in these lipids. To investigate the physical environment of these lipids, T(2)- and diffusion-weighted (1)H MAS NMR spectra were acquired on whole-tissue samples. The relatively increased lipid signal intensity in dystrophic tissue was due to an increase in molecules with long T(2) and short diffusion rates. The use of a range of pulse programs allowed the direct probing of the biochemical environment in which the lipid infiltration occurred, and by coupling the experiments to PR the significance of lipid infiltration and accumulation was also assessed.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2001-07-31", "authors": ["J LGriffin", "H JWilliams", "ESang", "J KNicholson"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.1185"}
{"title": "Effects of ischemia on the metabolism of cardiac enkephalins.", "abstract": "The effect of ischemia on cardiac Leucine enkephalin (Leu-enk) content, degradation and coronary release was studied in the isolated perfused hearts of male Sprague Dawley rats. Hearts were electrically stimulated at 180 beats/min. Cardiac Leu-enk concentrations were increased when hearts were perfused (635 +/- 41 vs 301 +/- 60 fmol/g in control non-perfused hearts,) or during ischemia-reperfusion (520 +/- 78 vs 277 +/- 42 fmol/g in heart submitted to ischemia alone). The quantity of leucine-enkephalin released by the heart during perfusion was four times higher than the initial content measured in the heart tissue. The rate of this release was the same throughout the experiment (25.9 +/- 2.9 fmol/min/g during perfusion vs. 19.2 +/- 1.6 during ischemia-reperfusion). These findings suggested that cardiac enkephalin metabolism is regulated by cardiac events. In fact, enzymes involved in enkephalin degradation were decreased during perfusion (39%) and increased during ischemia (50%). The decrease in the enzyme activity during coronary perfusion depended on a reduced activity in the membrane fraction only while membrane and soluble fractions were interested in the increased enzyme activity after ischemia. Ischemia-reperfusion induced a larger release of Leu-enk than perfusion without ischemia. In view of the protective actions of enkephalin peptides against oxidative stress, we can infer from our results an implication of Leu-enk in ischemia-reperfusion and thus eventually in preconditioning phenomenon.", "journal": "Archives of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2001-07-27", "authors": ["YSemmoum", "AYounes", "JCoudert"], "doi": "10.1076/apab.109.1.18.4280"}

The peroxisomal membrane contains a number of integral and peripheral membrane proteins involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins and the transport of metabolites across the membrane. The most abundant peroxisomal membrane protein (Pmp) in rat peroxisomes is Pmp22, a 22 kDa protein of unknown function that is encoded by the Pxmp2 gene. To investigate the function of the Pxmp2 gene, we have initiated mouse knockout studies. The expression level of the Pxmp2 mRNA in mice was investigated by Northern blot analysis. Pxmp2 RNA was shown to be differentially expressed with highest expression levels in liver, kidney and in heart tissue. Comparison with other peroxisomal marker genes revealed that the expression of Pxmp2, Pmp70 (Pxmp1) and catalase was regulated independently. Using 5' and 3' RACE we have cloned the full-length cDNA of murine Pxmp2 which comprises 863 nucleotides and have isolated a genomic clone containing the entire murine Pxmp2. We have analyzed the complete intron/exon structure of the Pxmp2 gene which contains five exons spanning about 11 kb on the genomic clone. All intron/exon splice junctions conform to the GT/AG rule.

Apoptosis may be an important mode of cell death in heart failure but it must be demonstrated by multiple criteria and not just TUNEL staining alone. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that besides apoptosis other phenomena like active gene transcription can result in TUNEL positivity. Moreover, other types of cell death that are caspase-independent could be important in heart failure. This study examined the hypothesis whether TUNEL labeling parallels caspase activation.\nCardiac tissue of patients in the terminal stage of heart failure as a consequence of ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were studied. Embryonic mice hearts were used for positive control for detection of the classical apoptosis.\nIn mice embryonic hearts we could clearly find apoptotic cell death detected by TUNEL labeling and immunohistochemistry for activated caspase-3. In heart failure, TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes were negative for active caspase-3 but showed signs of active gene transcription (SC-35). However, autophagic cell death could be found in 0.3% of the cardiomyocytes. Autophagic cell death was demonstrated by granular cytoplasmic ubiquitin inclusions, an established marker of autophagocytosis in neurons. Interestingly, these autophagic cardiomyocytes were TUNEL and activated caspase-3 negative but were also negative for C9, a marker for necrosis. Western blot analysis confirmed that in cardiomyopathies no cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-7 occurred.\nThe present study demonstrates two fundamentally different situations of cell death in cardiac tissue.

The normotensive Wistar rats (NWR) were used as control. To determine whether cardiac hypertrophy is associated with increased elastinolytic matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity; quantitative elastin-zymography was performed on cardiac tissue homogenates. The MMP-2 activity was normalized by the levels of actin. The MMP-2/actin ratio was 2.0+/-0.5 in left ventricle (LV) and 1.5+/-0.25 in right ventricle (RV) of SHR(32wks); and 0.5+/-0.25 in LV and 0.25+/-0.12 in RV of NWR(32wks) (P<0.02 when SHR compared with NWR). To measure passive diastolic cardiac function, rings from LV as well as RV through transmyocardial wall from male SHR and NWR of 6--8 weeks and 24--36 weeks were prepared.

The ring was placed in tissue myobath and length--tension relationships were assessed. The pressure--length relationship was shifted to left in SHR as compared to NWR. The amounts of cardiac elastin and collagen were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring desmosine--isodesmosine and hydroxyproline contents, respectively. A negative correlation between elastic tensile strength and elastin/collagen ratio was elucidated. To create situation analogous to heart failure and MMP activation, we treated cardiac rings with active MMP-2 and length--tension relation was measured.

Three groups of rats (120 days old) were used: sedentary rats (S) and rats exercised by a single bout of swimming lasting 5 (E5) or 8 h (E8), respectively. The effect of exercise on the response to I/R was related to an index of oxidative damage such as lipid peroxidation, as well as to the tissue antioxidant capacity and the response of heart tissue to in vitro oxidative stress. The intrinsic performance of E5 Langendorff preparations paced at 220 beats x min(-1) was also determined. A group of sedentary animals was used for H2O2-treated preparations. The effect of antioxidant treatment on inotropic recovery during reperfusion was studied on preparations from 5 or 8 h swimming vitamin E-treated (EVT5 and EVT8 and 5 or 8 h swimming untreated (EVU5 and EVU8) rats. Hearts from exercised animals displayed a reduced preischaemic inotropism, which in E5 rats was accompanied by an increase in the intrinsic heart rate. The lower intrinsic cardiac inotropism of E5 animals was confirmed in the paced preparations. The reduced contractility found in control hearts after addition of H2O2 to perfusion medium suggested that the low inotropism of E5 and E8 hearts was due to an exercise-induced increase in reactive oxygen species. Inotropic recovery during reperfusion was low in the S hearts, was significantly increased in the E5 hearts, and was again reduced to the S level in the E8 hearts. In the E8 hearts the indexes of cellular damage (LDH release) and oxidative stress increased, and antioxidant capacity decreased, while in E5 hearts there was no evidence of significant changes in such parameters. Performance and reperfusion recovery of hearts from 5 h swimming rats was not affected by vitamin E treatment, while those of hearts from 8 h swimming rats was the highest observed. We suggest that the higher inotropic recovery during reperfusion in the hearts from the E5 rats is related to the negative inotropic effect of exercise.

Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a member of a conserved family of animal beta-galactoside-binding proteins, localized in human heart tissue, has been suggested to play key roles in immunological and inflammatory processes. In the present study we demonstrated the occurrence of anti-Gal-1 autoAb in sera from patients in the acute and chronic stages of Chagas' disease (ACD and CCD) by means of ELISA and Western blot analysis. We found a marked increase in the level and frequency of Ig E anti-Gal-1 antibodies in sera from patients with ACD, but a low frequency of Ig M anti-Gal-1 immunoreactivity. Moreover, Ig G immunoreactivity to this beta-galactoside-binding protein was found to be correlated with the severity of cardiac damage in CCD, but was absent in nonrelated cardiomyopathies. We could not detect immunoreactivity with Trypanosoma cruzi antigens using a polyclonal antibody raised to human Gal-1 and no hemagglutinating activity could be specifically eluted from a lactosyl-agarose matrix from parasite lysates. Moreover, despite sequence homology between Gal-1 and shed acute phase antigen (SAPA) of T. cruzi, anti-Gal-1 antibodies eluted from human sera failed to cross-react with SAPA. In an attempt to explore whether Gal-1 immunoreactivity was originated from endogenous human Gal-1, we finally investigated its expression levels in cardiac tissue (the main target of Chagas' disease). This protein was found to be markedly upregulated in cardiac tissue from patients with severe CCD, compared to cardiac tissue from normal individuals.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental immunology", "date": "2001-06-26", "authors": ["LGiordanengo", "SGea", "GBarbieri", "G ARabinovich"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01512.x"}

In this study, the possible mechanisms whereby PLC could protect against adriamycin (ADR)-induced cardiomyopathy were carried out. Administration of ADR (3 mg kg(-1)i.p., every other day over a period of 2 weeks) resulted in a significant two-fold increase in serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, whereas daily administration of PLC (250 mg kg(-1), i.p. for 2 weeks) induced non-significant change. Daily administration of PLC to ADR-treated rats resulted in complete reversal of ADR-induced increase in cardiac enzymes except lactate dehydrogenase which was only reversed by 66%. In cardiac tissue homogenate, ADR caused a significant 53% increase in malonedialdehyde (MDA) and a significant 50% decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, whereas PLC induced a significant 33% decrease in MDA and a significant 41% increase in GSH levels. Daily administration of PLC to ADR-treated rats completely reversed the increase in MDA and the decrease in GSH induced by ADR to the normal levels. In rat heart mitochondria isolated 24 h after the last dose, ADR induced a significant 48% and 42% decrease in(14)CO(2)released from the oxidation of [1-(14)C]palmitoyl-CoA and [1-(14)C]palmitoylcarnitine, respectively, whereas PLC resulted in a significant 66% and 54% increase in the oxidation of both substrates, respectively. Interestingly, administration of PLC to ADR-treated rats resulted in complete recovery of the ADR-induced decrease in the oxidation of both substrates. In addition, in rat heart mitochondria, the oxidation of [1-(14)C]pyruvate, [1-(14)C]pyruvate and [1-(14)C]octanoate were not affected by ADR and/or PLC treatment. Moreover, ADR caused severe histopathological lesions manifested as toxic myocarditis which is protected by PLC. Worth mentioning is that PLC had no effect on the antitumour activity of ADR in solid Ehrlich carcinoma. Results from this study suggest that: (1) in the heart, PLC therapy completely protects against ADR-induced inhibition of mitochondrial beta -oxidation of long-chain fatty acids; (2) PLC has and/or induces a powerful antioxidant defense mechanism against ADR-induced lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes; and finally (3) PLC has no effect on the antitumour activity of ADR.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2001-06-23", "authors": ["M MSayed-Ahmed", "T MSalman", "H EGaballah", "S AAbou El-Naga", "RNicolai", "MCalvani"], "doi": "10.1006/phrs.2000.0786"}

We studied wild-type hNav1.5 channels and hNav1.5 channels with the R1232W/T1620M double mutation expressed in Xenopus oocytes using the cell-attached macropatch technique. We demonstrate that these mutations destabilize the fast-inactivated state (described with a two-state first-order reaction model) by decreasing reaction valence, accelerating recovery, and slowing the onset of fast inactivation, collectively resulting in delayed decay of macroscopic currents. R1232W/T1620M mutations in hNav1.5 channels also significantly increase steady-state channel availability, indicating that mutated channels occupy the slow inactivated state less than hNav1.5 channels. Under the stress of repetitive depolarizing pulses, R1232W/T1620M channels demonstrate less use-dependent current reduction compared to wild-type channels.

In order to characterize the electrophysiological effects of the compound, its effects on calcium and potassium currents of isolated canine ventricular cardiomyocytes were studied in the present work using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. L-type Ca current (ICa) was significantly depressed by EGIS-7229 at concentrations of 3 microM or higher with no concomitant changes in the voltage-dependence of activation and time course of inactivation of ICa. The drug reversibly suppressed the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K current (IKr) in a concentration-dependent manner, having a K0.5 value of 1.1+/-0.1 microM and a slope factor of close to unity (1.23+/-0.16), indicating that probably one single binding site of high affinity may be involved in binding of EGIS-7229 to the IKr channel. In contrast, no changes in the slow component of the delayed rectifier K current (IKs) was observed with the compound up to the concentration of 100 microM, even if the current was fully activated by 8-bromo-cAMP. At a concentration of 10 microM or higher, EGIS-7229 caused also a moderate but significant reduction in the inward rectifier K current (IK1) and the transient outward K current (Ito) with no change in the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation of Ito. Present results indicate that EGIS-7229 can be considered as a selective IKr blocker at low (1 microM) concentration; however, its combined (class III + IV) mechanism of action is evident at concentrations of 3 microM or higher.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the A-II1 receptor antagonists are now clinically established. Because ACE is a relatively unspecific peptidase which catalyses the breakdown of A-I, bradykinin and neuropeptides like substance P and neurotensin, the effects of ACE inhibitors go far beyond the prevention of A-II production. On the other hand, in certain tissues like vascular and cardiac tissue, A-II is produced by other enzymes, for instance chymase, and ACE inhibitors do not consistently prevent A-II production. The action of A-II1 receptor antagonists may also not be confined to prevention of binding of A-II at the A-II1 receptor, as by rebound more A-II may bind at the A-II type 2 (A-II2) receptor and thus mediate until now not well defined effects. Thus, anti-ischemic actions of these drugs may be related to multiple mechanisms. Inhibition of A-II effects at the A-II1 receptor may prevent systemic and coronary vasoconstriction and growth effects of A-II on various cell types. In addition, A-II may potentiate, by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Prevention of breakdown of bradykinin, substance P and neurotensin may result in direct vasodilation or release of nitrous oxide from the endothelium. Thus, growth-inhibiting effects may also be mediated. All these mechanisms seem to direct to a reduction of cardiac load by vasodilation and to a limitation of cardiovascular cell growth. While the systemic circulating renin-angiotensin system is probably responsible for control of cardiac load, local systems seem to control cell growth. Systemic effects seem to depend on activation of the renin-angiotensin system which has been shown in various ischemic syndromes. Activation of various components of the renin-angiotensin system has been demonstrated in myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarction and coronary occlusion and reperfusion models as well as in chronic left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction. While animal models of stress-induced myocardial ischemia have revealed predominantly positive results, clinical studies, which mostly were small and not well controlled, were equivocal. Large clinical trials with ACE inhibitors in acute myocardial infarction showed small benefits over placebo. Hypotension seems to be a critical side-effect in this situation. Experimental models show protective effects of both ACE inhibitors and A-II1 receptor antagonists in the situation of ischemia and reperfusion. New data on large clinical trials in patients at risk of cardiovascular events but normal left ventricular function demonstrate clear benefits of an ACE inhibitor. Large clinical trials in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction show reduction of ischemic events.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2001-06-08", "authors": ["GErtl", "KHu"], "doi": "10.1097/00005344-200109011-00003"}

Additionally, we examined the effects of CGP 41251, WB-4101 (alpha1a -adrenoceptor antagonist), chloroethylclonidine (CEC) (alpha1b-adrenoceptor antagonist) and selective damage of endocardial endothelium by Triton X-100 on the protection against hypoxia induced by preconditioning of rat heart tissue. Experiments were performed on rat isolated left ventricular papillary muscle. The following parameters were measured: force of contraction (Fc), velocity of contraction (+dF/dt) and velocity of relaxation (-dF/dt). The temperature of the bath solution was 37 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C, and rate of electrical stimulation was 0.5 Hz. At concentrations less than 1 microM CGP 41251 did not cause any changes in contractility of rat heart. At 1 and 3 microM, significant positive inotropic action was observed. Treatment of rat papillary muscle by CGP 41251 at 3 microM reduced decreasing of contractility by simulated hypoxia and reperfusion. Moreover, protective effects of preconditioning was not affected by addition of CGP 41251 neither at 1 nor at 3 microM. Pretreatment with CEC at 3 microM, and selective damage of endocardial endothelium induced by fast (1-s) immersion of papillary muscle in 0.5% Triton X-100, but not pretreatment with WB-4101, abolished the protective effects of preconditioning. The results imply that CGP 41251 improves contractility of heart muscle under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and does not alter hypoxic preconditioning in rat isolated cardiac tissue. Moreover, it was shown that alpha1b-adrenoceptors and endocardial endothelium are involved in triggering of preconditioning in rat isolated heart muscle.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2001-06-08", "authors": ["IKocic", "DDworakowska", "RDworakowski", "JPetrusewicz"], "doi": "10.1097/00005344-200106000-00011"}

To identify a source of stem cells capable of restoring damaged cardiac tissue, we transplanted highly enriched hematopoietic stem cells, the so-called side population (SP) cells, into lethally irradiated mice subsequently rendered ischemic by coronary artery occlusion for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion. The engrafted SP cells (CD34(-)/low, c-Kit(+), Sca-1(+)) or their progeny migrated into ischemic cardiac muscle and blood vessels, differentiated to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, and contributed to the formation of functional tissue. SP cells were purified from Rosa26 transgenic mice, which express lacZ widely. Donor-derived cardiomyocytes were found primarily in the peri-infarct region at a prevalence of around 0.02% and were identified by expression of lacZ and alpha-actinin, and lack of expression of CD45. Donor-derived endothelial cells were identified by expression of lacZ and Flt-1, an endothelial marker shown to be absent on SP cells. Endothelial engraftment was found at a prevalence of around 3.3%, primarily in small vessels adjacent to the infarct.

The effect of the co-administration of both B(1) and B(2) kinin receptor antagonists (2.5 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) each) with metallopeptidase inhibitors was also evaluated. The pharmacological treatments were infused subcutaneously using micro-osmotic pumps for 5 days starting 4 days before the ligation of the left coronary artery. Immunoreactive kinins were quantified by highly sensitive and specific competitive enzyme immunoassays. The post-MI mortality of untreated rats with a large MI was high; 74% of rats dying prior to the hemodynamic study. Mortality in the other MI groups was not significantly different from that of the untreated MI rats. Cardiac BK levels were not significantly different in the MI vehicle-treated group compared with the sham-operated rats. Both omapatrilat and enalapril treatments of MI rats significantly increased cardiac BK concentrations compared with the sham-operated group (P < 0.05). However, cardiac BK levels were significantly increased only in the MI omapatrilat-treated rats compared with the MI vehicle-treated group (P < 0.01).

Absence of adequate intralysosomal GAA activity results in massive amounts of glycogen accumulation in multiple muscle groups, resulting in morbidity and mortality secondary to respiratory embarrassment and/or cardiomyopathy. In a mouse model of GSD-II, we demonstrate that infection of the murine liver with a modified adenovirus (Ad) vector encoding human GAA (hGAA) resulted in long-term persistence of the vector in liver tissues for at least 6 months. Despite both a rapid shutdown of hGAA mRNA expression from the vector, as well as the elicitation of anti-hGAA antibody responses (hGAA is a foreign antigen in this model), the hGAA secreted by the liver was taken up by all muscle groups analyzed and, remarkably, persisted in them for at least 6 months. The persistence of the protein also correlated with long-term correction of pathologic intramuscular glycogen accumulations in all muscle groups tested, but most notably the cardiac tissues, which demonstrated a significantly decreased glycogen content for at least 190 days after a single vector injection.

{"title": "Doxorubicin-induced persistent oxidative stress to cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "We recently reported a cardioselective and cumulative oxidation of cardiac mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) following subchronic administration of doxorubicin to rats. The mtDNA adducts persist for up to 5 weeks after cessation of doxorubicin treatment. Since the evidence suggests that this persistence of mtDNA adducts cannot be attributed to a lack of repair and replication, we investigated whether it might reflect a long-lasting stimulation of free radical-mediated adduct formation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received weekly s.c. injections of either doxorubicin (2 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline. Cardiac myocytes isolated from rats following 6 weekly injections of doxorubicin expressed a much higher rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation compared to saline controls. This higher rate of ROS formation persisted for 5 weeks following the last injection. Associated with this was a persistent depression of GSH in heart tissue, while protein-thiol content was not markedly altered. These data suggest that the accumulation and persistence of oxidized mtDNA may be due, not to the stability of the adducts, but to some as yet undefined toxic lesion that causes long-lasting stimulation of ROS generation by doxorubicin. This persistent generation of ROS may contribute to the cumulative and irreversible cardiotoxicity observed clinically with the drug.", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2001-05-23", "authors": ["SZhou", "C MPalmeira", "K BWallace"], "doi": "10.1016/s0378-4274(01)00329-0"}

Quantitative TEM data revealed a 3-fold increase in the number of developing GJs per intercalated disk in both AMs and VMs from 6 to 15 days in culture. However, at days 12 and 15, the percentage of GJ length per intercalated disk and mean GJ length were 2-fold higher in VMs than in AMS: Measurements of connexin43 GJs by confocal microscopy confirmed TEM data and demonstrated respectively 2- and 4.5-fold greater mean values of GJ length and area in VMs than in AMS: These differences are attributable to the development of large GJs (>3 micrometer) in VMs, closely resembling those observed in VMs in vivo. Although large GJs in cultured VMs comprised approximately 14% of the total number of GJs, their contribution to total GJ length and area constituted >60% and 85%, respectively. In marked contrast, the number of large GJs in AMs both in vitro and in vivo was <1% from the total number of GJS: These data confirm our hypothesis and provide the first evidence that tissue-specific patterns of GJs in AMs and VMs are determined primarily by intrinsic factors within cardiac myocytes and are developmentally regulated.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2001-05-23", "authors": ["SKostin", "JSchaper"], "doi": "10.1161/hh0901.089986"}

Our study reports inhibition of myocardial intracellular calcium-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)) activity by clinically relevant concentrations of the drug. The effect was first shown in vitro using suspensions of freshly isolated rat and rabbit cardiomyocytes. Addition of 0.1-10 microM doxorubicin to these cells led to a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of total iPLA(2), as measured using (16:0, [(3)H]18:1) plasmenylcholine and phosphatidylcholine substrates in the presence or absence of calcium. Subcellular fractionation into cytosolic and membrane fraction revealed that the drug selectively inhibits membrane-associated iPLA(2) activity, without altering activity of the cytosolic enzyme. Doxorubicin treatment of cells prelabeled with [H(3)]arachidonic acid led to a depression of baseline arachidonic acid release levels, corroborating iPLA(2) inhibition. Reducing agents blocked PLA(2) inhibition in cardiomyocyte suspensions, suggesting that the doxorubicin effect is mediated by oxidation of susceptible cysteines. In vivo experiments, in which adults rats were i.v. injected with a bolus dose of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin, confirmed in vitro findings, revealing a 2-fold decrease in membrane-associated Ca(2+)-independent iPLA(2) activity in the heart tissue of treated animals.

Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology (2001) 33, 933-945. The inducible NO synthase (NOS2) in cardiac tissue contributes to myocardial and coronary inflammation and dysfunction. Several natural (endogenous) hormones such as retinoic acid, the active metabolite of vitamin A, have the ability to attenuate NOS2 activation in inflammatory cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of RA on NOS2 activation in cultured cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) and adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). CMEC were stimulated either with a combination of 10 microg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 50 IU/ml interferon- gamma (IFN- gamma) or with a combination of 1 ng/ml interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)+IFN- gamma whereas ARVM were stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1 beta and 50 IU/ml IFN- gamma in the absence or presence of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). Activation of the NOS2 pathway was estimated by measurement of mRNA (Northern blot) and protein (Western blot) expression, enzyme activity by conversion of [(3)H]L -arginine to [(3)H]L -citrulline, and nitrite accumulation. NOS2 mRNA half-life was studied in CMEC and ARVM in the presence of actinomycin D. In CMEC and ARVM stimulated with a combination of LPS and/or cytokines, atRA (10(-6), 10(-5)M) significantly (P<0.05) attenuated NOS2 mRNA and protein expression, enzymatic activity and reduced supernatant nitrite concentration. Upon stimulation with LPS/IFN- gamma, atRA significantly decreased NOS2 mRNA half-life. This was not seen after stimulation with IL-1 beta/IFN- gamma.

After a month, animals were killed and their hearts were removed for use in analyses. In the other part, after fasting blood samples were obtained from 11 volunteer subjects, they were given aspirin (approximately 10 mg/kg/day) for 30 days and second blood samples were obtained after 1 month.

Antioxidant system was found to be impaired in the heart tissue from guinea pigs and in the erythrocytes from volunteer subjects. AOP and NSSA values were lower and MDA higher after aspirin treatment in both heart tissues and erythrocytes.

In human erythrocytes, SO was unchanged, but GSH-Px and CAT activities were increased after aspirin treatment. Changes in guinea pig heart tissues from animals treated with higher aspirin doses were more drastic relative to those of human erythrocytes, but no meaningful differences were observed between analysis parameters of control and lower-dose (10 mg/kg/day) aspirin-treated animals. Our results suggest that high-dose aspirin exerts significant toxicity to guinea pig myocardium and normal dose aspirin may cause peroxidation in the human erythrocytes due to its oxidant potential.

{"title": "Modeling advection and diffusion of oxygen in complex vascular networks.", "abstract": "A realistic geometric model for the three-dimensional capillary network geometry is used as a framework for studying the transport and consumption of oxygen in cardiac tissue. The nontree-like capillary network conforms to the available morphometric statistics and is supplied by a single arterial source and drains into a pair of venular sinks. We explore steady-state oxygen transport and consumption in the tissue using a mathematical model which accounts for advection in the vascular network, nonlinear binding of dissolved oxygen to hemoglobin and myoglobin, passive diffusion of freely dissolved and protein-bound oxygen, and Michaelis-Menten consumption in the parenchymal tissue. The advection velocity field is found by solving the hemodynamic problem for flow throughout the network. The resulting system is described by a set of coupled nonlinear elliptic equations, which are solved using a finite-difference numerical approximation. We find that coupled advection and diffusion in the three-dimensional system enhance the dispersion of oxygen in the tissue compared to the predictions of simplified axially distributed models, and that no \"lethal corner,\" or oxygen-deprived region occurs for physiologically reasonable values for flow and consumption. Concentrations of 0.5-1.0 mM myoglobin facilitate the transport of oxygen and thereby protect the tissue from hypoxia at levels near its P50, that is, when local oxygen consumption rates are close to those of delivery by flow and myoglobin-facilitated diffusion, a fairly narrow range.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2001-05-08", "authors": ["D ABeard", "J BBassingthwaighte"], "doi": "10.1114/1.1359450"}

Individuals with Syndrome X suffer increased morbidity from adult ischemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia initiates a defensive increase in cardiac glucose metabolism, and individuals with Syndrome X demonstrate reduced insulin sensitivity and reduced glucose uptake. Glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 facilitate glucose uptake across cardiac plasma membranes, and hexokinase II (HKII) is the predominant hexokinase isoform in adult cardiac tissue. We therefore hypothesized that GLUT1, GLUT4 and HKII gene expression would be reduced in heart muscle of growth-retarded rats, and that reduced gene expression would result in reduced myocardial glucose uptake. To prove this hypothesis, we measured cardiac GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA and protein in control IUGR rat hearts at day 21 and at day 120 of life. HKII mRNA quantification and 2-deoxyglucose-uptake studies were performed in day-120 control and IUGR cardiac muscle. Both GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced at day 21 and at day 120 of life in IUGR hearts. HKII mRNA was also reduced at day 120. Similarly, both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were significantly reduced in day-120 IUGR cardiac muscle. We conclude that adult rats showing IUGR as a result of uteroplacental insufficiency express significantly less cardiac GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA and protein than control animals (which underwent sham operations), and that this decrease in gene expression occurs in parallel with reduced myocardial glucose uptake. We speculate that this reduced GLUT gene expression and glucose uptake contribute towards mortality from ischemic heart disease seen in adults born with IUGR.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2001-04-20", "authors": ["A ETsirka", "E MGruetzmacher", "D EKelley", "V HRitov", "S UDevaskar", "R HLane"], "doi": "10.1677/joe.0.1690373"}

DNA fragmentation shown as DNA ladders on gels, the hallmark of apoptosis, was found in the heart tissue of these rats. In the early phase of delayed fluid resuscitation, the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) was examined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and was found to be activated. In comparison with burned rats with immediate fluid resuscitation, nitric oxide levels in hearts from burned rats with delayed fluid resuscitation were significantly lower (P<0.01).

{"title": "Two-dimensional manipulation of cardiac myocyte sheets utilizing temperature-responsive culture dishes augments the pulsatile amplitude.", "abstract": "Although cardiac myocytes adherent to tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) dishes retain the spontaneous beating, the pulsatile amplitude is highly limited compared to that in vivo. One of the main reasons for the limited pulsation may be the interface between the cells and the TCPS surfaces. Release of these cells from rigid TCPS surfaces may augment their pulsatile amplitude. With this perspective, we have developed a novel cell manipulation technique to detach cultured cardiac myocytes from rigid surfaces and to rescue higher pulsatile amplitude of the cells using temperature-responsive culture dishes and discuss the possibility of improving this heart tissue model. Primary cardiac myocytes were cultured on the slightly hydrophobic dish surfaces grafted with a temperature-responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). Cells adhered and proliferated, forming confluent cardiac myocyte sheets in a fashion similar to those on ungrafted TCPS dishes. Decrease in culture temperature resulted in surface change of the polymer from slight hydrophobic to highly hydrophilic due to extensive hydration of the grafted polymer on the dishes. This results in release of cardiac myocyte sheets from the dishes without enzymatic or EDTA treatment. When no support was used, the detached cardiac myocyte sheets shrank to one-tenth size, which ceased their pulsation. When chitin membranes were used to support the confluent sheets to prevent cell shrinkage, the detached cell sheets could be transferred and readily adhered onto another virgin TCPS dishes. These transferred cell sheets preserved the similar cell morphology and pulsation to those before the detachment. When polyethylene meshes were used to support cell sheet transfer, detached cardiac myocyte sheets partially attached to the mesh threads. Then, the constructs were inverted and placed in another culture dish to prevent direct association to dish surfaces. Moreover, the cardiac myocyte sheets were reorganized to heart tissue-like structures by the unisotropic contraction orientated by the mesh threads, and the pulsatile amplitude increased more than 10 times higher. This technique would bring about new insight in tissue engineering as well as cultured heart model.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2001-04-17", "authors": ["TShimizu", "MYamato", "AKikuchi", "TOkano"], "doi": "10.1089/107632701300062732"}

The objective of this study was to compare the gene expression of individual components of the renin-angiotensin system in hearts of normotensive and hypertensive rats. Two genetically hypertensive rat strains--spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats (HTG)--were compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Lewis (LEW) normotensive controls. In addition, developmental changes in gene expression of individual components of cardiac RAS were studied in 20-day-old fetuses, 2-day-old newborns and 3-month-old HTG and LEW rats. In our study, the angiotensinogen gene expression did not differ either among adult normotensive and hypertensive strains, or during development. In contrast, the renin gene expression was significantly increased in hearts of hypertensive compared to normotensive rats. Moreover, a 5-fold increase of renin mRNA was observed in hearts of HTG rats between day 2 and the third month of age. There was also an age-dependent increase of ACE gene expression in both HTG and LEW rats which was substantially delayed in HTG hearts.

{"title": "Effects of tocopheryl quinone on the heart: model experiments with xanthine oxidase, heart mitochondria, and isolated perfused rat hearts.", "abstract": "It is generally accepted that the protection effect of biological tissues by vitamin E is due to its radical scavenging potency in membranes, thereby being transformed to a vitamin E radical. A deficiency of appropriate reductants, which recycle vitamin E radicals back to its antioxidative active form, causes an irreversible degradation of vitamin E leading to tocopheryl quinone (TQ). TQ-like compounds were shown to result from both vitamin E and corresponding hydrophilic analogues of this antioxidant in vitro. In vivo elevated concentrations of tocopheryl quinones were detected after oxidative stress and TQ supplementation as well. Quinones in general are known to be efficient one-electron donors and acceptors. Therefore the question arises whether TQ-like compounds can undergo redox-cycling in conjunction with redox-active enzymes in the heart, thereby producing harmful oxygen radicals, or whether these compounds exhibit antioxidant properties. In order to elucidate this question we focused our interest on the interaction of TQ and a corresponding short-chain homologue (TQ(0)) with xanthine oxidase and heart mitochondria. Furthermore, we tested the influence of TQ on the recovery of isolated perfused rat hearts after ischemia/reperfusion. Our experiments revealed that hydrophilic TQ(0) was univalently reduced by xanthine oxidase (XOD) yielding semiquinone radicals in the absence of oxygen. However, under aerobic conditions TQ(0) enhanced the O(2)(*)(-) radical output of XOD. In the mitochondrial respiratory chain TQ was shown to interact with high potential cytochrome b in the bc(1) complex specifically. In contrast to the system XOD/TQ(0), lipophilic TQ in submitochondrial particles decreased the O(2)(*)(-) radical release during regular respiration possibly due to its interaction with b-cytochromes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In isolated rat hearts perfused with liposomes containing lipophilic TQ, it was efficiently accumulated in the heart tissue. When hearts were subjected to conditions of ischemia/reperfusion, infusion of TQ prior to ischemia significantly improved the recovery of hemodynamic parameters. Our results demonstrate that TQ derivatives may induce pro-oxidative and antioxidative effects depending on the distribution of TQ derivatives in the heart tissue and the interacting redox system.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2001-04-11", "authors": ["LGille", "KStaniek", "HNohl"], "doi": "10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00475-0"}

{"title": "Regulation of parasympathetic neurons by mast cells and histamine in the guinea pig heart.", "abstract": "The potential interaction between the immune system and the autonomic nervous system was examined in the cardiac ganglia of guinea pigs. Intracellular voltage recordings were used to determine the effects of mast cell degranulation on the membrane properties of parasympathetic neurons in animals actively sensitized to ovalbumin. Stimulation of mast cell degranulation by perfusion with ovalbumin (10 micrograms/ml) produced a depolarization and increase in the excitability of intracardiac neurons. These effects could be mimicked by histamine application, either by perfusion (10 microM) or by local pressure application (100 microM, 1-2 s application). In either case, histamine application resulted in a similar membrane depolarization and increase in excitability. Immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that histamine-immunoreactive mast cells are located in close proximity to parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. The histamine response was not due to release of other neurotransmitters from adjacent nerve terminals and both the depolarization and increase in excitability were inhibited by the H1 antagonist, pyrilamine (300 nM), and were unaffected by the H2 antagonist cimetidine (5 microM). Incubation of cardiac ganglion preparations from sensitized animals with pyrilamine prior to ovalbumin perfusion resulted in the inhibition of both the depolarization and increase in excitability. These results demonstrate that mast cell degranulation, and the subsequent release of histamine, results in the stimulation of intracardiac neurons via the activation of H1 receptors.

Earlier investigations of hemodynamic parameters and the recovery of ATP and creatine phosphate, carried out by means of 31P-NMR spectroscopy, had demonstrated that, depending on the composition of the perfusates (content of glucose, fatty acids, and carnitine), quite strong differences may occur in the reperfusion period after ischemia. In order to determine a possible relationship between these differences and the addition of carnitine, the study investigated whether carnitine penetrated into the tissue during the experiments, and whether it was able to reduce the concentration of detrimental substances. The concentrations of free and total carnitine as well as the malondialdehyde content as an indicator of ischemia/reperfusion damage were determined in different parts of the cardiac tissue as follows: After the Langendorff-experiments the hearts were dissected, homogenized and reconditioned; then carnitine and malondialdehyde were determined. The study included 63 hearts, which were divided into 8 different perfusion groups. Carnitine concentrations in heart tissue perfused with L-carnitine were much higher than those of the controls. Since exogenous L-carnitine and formed esters could be found in the tissue after the experiment, they must have permeated the cellular membrane rapidly. The concentrations of malondialdehyde behaved in an inverted way; as expected they were lower in carnitine-perfused hearts. The favourable effects of L-carnitine, expressed both by improved cardiac dynamics and ATP and CrP recovery in the reperfusion period, are obviously due to the fact that L-carnitine reduces ischemic damage.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2001-03-28", "authors": ["HL\u00f6ster", "UB\u00f6hm"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1007255021484"}
{"title": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase in the myocard.", "abstract": "Recognition of significance of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) in cardiovascular regulations has led to intensive research and development of therapies focused on NOS as potential therapeutic targets. However, the NOS isoform profile of cardiac tissue and subcellular localization of NOS isoforms remain a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to investigate the localization of an inducible NOS isoform (NOS2) in cardiomyocytes. Employing a novel immunocytochemical technique of a catalyzed reporter deposition system with tyramide and electron microscopical immunocytochemistry complemented with Western blotting and RT-PCR, we detected NOS2 both in rat neonatal and adult cultured cardiomyocytes and in the normal myocard of adult rats as well as in the human myocard of patients with dilative cardiomyopathy. NOS2 was targeted predominantly to a particulate component of the cardiomyocyte--along contractile fibers, in the plasma membrane including T-tubules, as well as in the nuclear envelope, mitochondria and Golgi complex. Our results point to an involvement of NOS2 in maintaining cardiac homeostasis and contradict to the notion that NOS2 is expressed in cardiac tissue only in response to various physiological and pathogenic factors. NOS2 targeting to mitochondria and contractile fibers suggests a relationship of NO with contractile function and energy production in the cardiac muscle.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2001-03-28", "authors": ["I BBuchwalow", "WSchulze", "PKarczewski", "M MKostic", "GWallukat", "RMorwinski", "E GKrause", "JM\u00fcller", "MPaul", "JSlezak", "F CLuft", "HHaller"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1007286602865"}

Four groups of rats were examined: control and diabetic, with or without bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) (BMOV, an organic form of vanadium) treatment for 8 weeks. The effect of vanadium on insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation was studied at 5 min as the early insulin response and at 15 min after insulin injection as the maximal insulin response. At 5 min after insulin injection, plasma membrane GLUT4 level in the diabetic-treated group was not different from the control groups and was significantly higher than that of the insulin-stimulated diabetic group, indicating an enhancement of insulin response on GLUT4 translocation brought about by vanadium treatment. In contrast to that at 5 min after insulin injection, no significant difference in the plasma membrane GLUT4 level was observed between the diabetic and the diabetic-treated groups at 15 min after insulin injection. GLUT4 mobilization from the intracellular pool in response to insulin was also investigated at 15 min after insulin injection. Basal intracellular GLUT4 content was significantly higher in the diabetic-treated group when compared to the diabetic group under the same condition. However, the increased basal intracellular GLUT4 in the diabetic-treated group did not result in more insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation at 15 min after insulin injection. In conclusion, the finding that plasma membrane GLUT4 in the diabetic-treated group is significantly higher than that of the diabetic group at 5 min but not at 15 min post-insulin injection indicates that vanadium treatment enhances insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation in cardiac tissue by enhancing its early response.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2001-03-28", "authors": ["S HLi", "J HMcNeill"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1007224828753"}
{"title": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligands: mitochondrial permeability transition induction in rat cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Strong evidence is emerging that mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) may be important in certain physiological conditions and, above all, in the processes of cell damage and death. Reversible MPT, triggered by inducing agents in the presence of calcium ions, has resulted in the opening of a dynamic multiprotein complex formed in the inner mitochondrial membrane and has caused large-amplitude mitochondrial swelling. In the present work, the exposure of de-energized rat cardiac mitochondria to peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands (1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK 11195), 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864), and diazepam) produced a dose-dependent and cyclosporin A (CSP)-sensitive loss of absorbance, which was indicative of mitochondrial swelling. By contrast, the addition of a high-affinity central benzodiazepine receptor ligand (clonazepam) was ineffective, even at the highest concentration tested. The ultrastructural changes associated with swelling were similar in mitochondria exposed either to PK 11195 or to calcium. Supporting the apoptotic role of PK 11195-induced swelling, supernatants from mitochondria that had undergone permeability transition caused apoptotic changes in isolated cardiac nuclei. In addition, ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in rat cardiac tissue following in vivo PK 11195 administration, with these abnormalities being prevented by CSP co-administration. These data indicate that PBR ligands induce mitochondrial permeability transition and ultrastructural alterations in isolated cardiac mitochondria as well as in myocardiocytes, suggesting a novel strategy for studying the implication of PBR ligands as apoptosis inducers, through a probable effect on the MPT pore.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2001-03-27", "authors": ["BChelli", "AFalleni", "FSalvetti", "VGremigni", "ALucacchini", "CMartini"], "doi": "10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00588-8"}

However, steep action potential duration restitution, recently proposed to be a major determinant of VF, is typically decreased rather than increased by hyperkalemia and acute ischemia. To investigate this apparent contradiction, we simulated the effects of regional hyperkalemia and other ischemic components (anoxia and acidosis) on the stability of spiral wave reentry in simulated two-dimensional cardiac tissue by use of the Luo-Rudy ventricular action potential model. We found that the hyperkalemic \"ischemic\" area promotes wavebreak in the surrounding normal tissue by accelerating the rate of spiral wave reentry, even after the depolarized ischemic area itself has become unexcitable. Furthermore, wavebreak and fibrillation can be prevented if the dynamical instability of the normal tissue is reduced significantly by targeting electrical restitution properties, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "The role of endothelins and their receptors in heart failure.", "abstract": "Endothelin (ET) is a peptide composed of 21 amino acids, derived from a larger precursor, the big-endothelin, by action of the endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) family; three isoforms of endothelin, named ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, have been identified. Endothelin-1 is generated mainly by vascular endothelial cells and exerts various important biological actions, mediated by two receptor subtypes, ET-A and ET-B, belonging to the G protein-coupled family that have been identified in various human tissues such as the cardiac tissue. Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictive agent, has inotropic and mitogenic actions, modulates salt and water homeostasis and plays an important role in the maintenance of vascular tone and blood pressure in healthy subjects. Endothelin-1, as well as ET-A and ECE-1, also has an important role in cardiovascular development, as observed by the variety of abnormalities related to neural crest-derived tissues in mouse embryos deficient of a member of the ET-1/ECE-1/ET-A pathway. Various evidence indicates that endogenous endothelin-1 may contribute to the pathophysiology of conditions associated with sustained vasoconstriction, such as heart failure. In heart failure, elevated circulating levels of both endothelin-1 and big-endothelin-1 are observed; in failing hearts an activation of the endothelin system is found: tissue level of ET-1 is increased with respect to non-failing hearts as well as receptor density, due mainly to an upregulation of the ET-A subtype, the prevalent receptor subclass in cardiac tissue. Finally, studies in both humans and animal models of cardiovascular disease show that inhibition of the endothelin function (anti-endothelin strategy) is associated with an improvement of haemodynamic conditions; these observations indicate that endothelin receptor antagonists or endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitors may constitute a novel and potentially important class of agents for the treatment of this disease.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2001-03-13", "authors": ["DGiannessi", "SDel Ry", "R LVitale"], "doi": "10.1006/phrs.2000.0758"}

Chagas' disease is an American endemic disease caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, which produces myocarditis and a blockade of the conduction system, resulting in cardiac dysfunction. We studied the expression of NCAM in paraffin-embedded human heart tissues from 34 autopsies of patients with Chagas' myocarditis and from murine and canine experimental acute Chagas' myocarditis, using a polyclonal anti-NCAM antibody and immunohistochemistry.

Here, we present an error analysis to investigate how well PSs can be localized. Computer simulations of rotating spiral waves scaled appropriately for cardiac tissue were studied with various levels of noise added. The accuracy in identifying and localizing singularities depended on three factors: (i) the point chosen as the origin in state space used to calculate the phase variable; (ii) signal to noise ratio; and (iii) discretization (number of levels used to represent data). We found that for both simulation as well as experimental data, there existed a wide range for the choice of origin for which PSs could be identified. Discretization coupled with noise affected this range adversely. However, there always existed a range for choice of the origin that was 20% or more of the action potential amplitude within which the accuracy of localizing PSs was better than 2 mm.

The goal of this computational study is to examine the interactions between wave fronts and various obstacles in a two-dimensional sheet of myocardium. The myocardium is modeled as an isotropic sheet with Luo-Rudy I membrane kinetics. An examination is conducted of wave front interactions with nonconductive and passive-tissue obstacles. Simulations were performed either in environments of reduced myocardial excitability, or with rapid stimulation via a line electrode. The shape of the obstacles and their ability to withdraw current from the active tissue greatly influence wave front-obstacle interactions in each of these environments. The likelihood of wave front detachment from an obstacle corner increases as the curvature of the obstacle corner is increased. A passive-tissue obstacle promotes wave front-obstacle separation in regions of depressed excitability. Under rapid pacing, the presence of the passive obstacle results in wave fragmentation, while the insulator obstacle promotes wave front detachment.

This could explain deleterious effects of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on cardiac function. We examined the influence of COX inhibition on myocardial function after low-flow ischaemia and reperfusion, employing either ASA (100 micromol/l), the partially selective COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam (0.3 micromol/l and 3.0 micromol/l), or the highly selective COX-2 inhibitor SC 58125 (1.0 micromol/l and 3.0 microgmol/l). Isolated, buffer-perfused guinea pig hearts, performing pressure-volume work before and after consecutive low-flow ischaemia and reperfusion, were used for the study. Measurement of coronary and aortic flow, ejection time and heart rate served to calculate external heart work (EHW), before and after ischaemia. Additionally, release of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2, production of lactate, consumption of pyruvate and tissue concentration of the isoprostane 8-iso-PGF2alpha were measured. ASA significantly reduced recovery of EHW (46+/-18% vs. 82+/-15% for controls), whereas meloxicam and SC 58125 did not (64+/-15% and 74+/-13% recovery, respectively). Paradoxically, ASA increased reactive hyperaemia and consumption of pyruvate in the early reperfusion phase in comparison to all other groups, while lactate production did not differ. Prostacyclin production did not increase during reperfusion and was not significantly different between groups at any time point. In contrast, thromboxane A2 release increased about fivefold in the 2nd min of reperfusion under control conditions and in the presence of SC 58125, but was inhibited by ASA and by meloxicam in both concentrations. Isoprostane content of heart tissue was not detectably influenced under the mild reperfusion conditions used here. We conclude that ASA can aggravate postischaemic cardiac dysfunction, independent of COX inhibition.

{"title": "Matrix metalloproteinase expression in cardiac myocytes following myocardial infarction in the rabbit.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI), leads to cardiac remodeling, thinning of the ventricle wall, ventricular dilation, and heart failure, and is a leading cause of death. Interactions between the contractile elements of the cardiac myocytes and the extracellular matrix (ECM) help maintain myocyte alignment required for the structural and functional integrity of the heart. Following MI, reorganization of the ECM and the myocytes occurs, contributing to loss of heart function. In certain pathological circumstances, the ECM is modulated such that the structure of the tissue becomes damaged. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of enzymes that degrade molecules of the ECM. The present experiments were performed to define the time-course, isozyme subtypes, and cellular source of increased MMP expression that occurs following MI in an experimental rabbit model. Heart tissue samples from infarcted and sham animals were analyzed over a time-course of 1-14 days. By zymography, it was demonstrated that, unlike the sham controls, MMP-9 expression was induced within 24 hours following MI. MMP-3 expression, also absent in sham controls, was induced 2 days after MI. MMP-2 expression was detected in both the sham and infarcted samples and was modestly up-regulated following MI. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression was evaluated and shown to be down-regulated following MI, inverse of MMP-9 and MMP-3 expression. Further, MMP-9 and MMP-3 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in myocytes within the infarct. Additional studies were conducted in which cultured rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to a hypoxic environment (2% O2) for 24 hours and the media analyzed for MMP expression.

However, little is known regarding the levels of kallikrein-kinin components in the heart during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The objectives of the present study were to define the effects of pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy on cardiac levels of kininogen, kallikrein and bradykinin B2 receptor mRNAs. The pressure-overload induced by aortic constriction produced cardiac hypertrophy in mice after 14 and 28d, assessed from the increased ratios of heart weight to body weight and elevation of brain natriuretic peptide mRNA in the heart. B2 receptor mRNA rapidly decreased in the heart within 7 d after the operation, subsequently returning to those of sham-operated animals. In contrast, levels of both low-molecular-weight kininogen and tissue kallikrein mRNAs were increased 7, 14 and 28 d after aortic constriction. These findings suggest that the mechanical load or stretch in cardiac tissue by pressue-overload rapidly produces the downregulation of B2 receptor expression during the initial stage which may allow the promotion of cardiac hypertrophy induced by a mediation of hypertophic factors such as angiotensin II, while upregulation of kininogen and kallikrein mRNAs during the chronic stage may lead to an enhancement of local kinin generation in the heart, from which further progression of cardiac hypertrophy during later stages may be regulated.", "journal": "Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["KYayama", "HHiyoshi", "HOkamoto"], "doi": "10.1248/bpb.24.34"}

The prodrug (referred to as doxorubicin conjugate) contains doxorubicin linked to a seven-amino acid peptide conjugate that was designed to increase delivery of doxorubicin to tumor sites through the hydrolytic properties of PSA, which prostate tumors express in high amounts. Following i.p. administration of the doxorubicin conjugate to mice, tumor exposure to doxorubicin was increased 2.5-fold as compared with that achieved after an equimolar dose of doxorubicin itself. However, in heart tissue, the site of clinical dose-limiting toxicity, doxorubicin concentrations observed after administration of doxorubicin conjugate were substantially lower than those in mice that received doxorubicin itself. While the prodrug provided selective delivery of doxorubicin to tumor tissue, there was substantial non-PSA-specific formation of doxorubicin in laboratory animals, a factor that would limit the extent of therapeutic gain of the prodrug. Following i.v. administration to mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys, about one-third of the dose was metabolized to doxorubicin. In tumor-bearing mice, the fraction of the dose metabolized to doxorubicin appeared even higher. This is likely the result of conjugate conversion to doxorubicin by both PSA-specific (in tumor) and non-PSA-specific proteolytic activities. In vitro studies provided further support for the PSA specificity of metabolism; LNCaP cells mediated rapid metabolism of the conjugate, while DuPRO-1 cells, which are deficient in PSA, were incapable of metabolism.", "journal": "Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals", "date": "2001-02-22", "authors": ["B KWong", "DDeFeo-Jones", "R EJones", "V MGarsky", "D MFeng", "AOliff", "MChiba", "J DEllis", "J HLin"], "doi": null}

IFN-gamma induces the proliferation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and augments the Th1 immune cascade. The role of IL-18 and IL-12 in the induction of IFN-gamma following allogeneic heart transplantation has not been described. We sought to characterize the IL-12 and IL-18 response to murine allogeneic heart transplantation, particularly with respect to IFN-gamma production and histologic transplant rejection. Forty-eight heterotopic heart transplants were performed in two groups of mice: syngeneic C3H/HeN to C3H/HeN mice and allogeneic BALB/C to C3H/HeN mice. Transplants were followed out to 2, 6, 10, and 14 days. Six transplants were performed in each group. Serum and splenic samples were used to evaluate the cytokine response by ELISA. Explanted heart tissue was processed for evidence of histologic rejection, and RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-gamma signal qualitatively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Fisher's projected least significant difference (PLSD) was used for statistical analysis. Transplant rejection occurred in the allogeneic group histologically by day 6 and clinically by day 10. Serum IFN-gamma levels rose significantly by day 6 in the allogeneic group and then continued to rise in the splenocyte cultures. Serum IL-18 also rose significantly in the allogeneic group at day 6 compared with syngeneic group. RT-PCR revealed that the allogeneic tissue contained an increased signal for IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-gamma beginning at day 6 and peaking at day 10 after transplant.

{"title": "Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 instigates apoptosis in transformed cardiac fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Tumor cells become malignant, in part, because of their activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inactivation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Myocardial tumors are rarely malignant. This raises the possibility that the MMPs and TIMPs are differentially regulated in the heart compared to other tissues. Therefore, we hypothesized that a tissue specific tumor suppressor exists in the heart. To test this hypothesis we prepared cardiac tissue extracts from normal (n = 4), ischemic cardiomypathic (ICM) [n = 5], and dilated cardiomyopathic (DCM) [n = 8] human heart end-stage explants. The level of cardiospecific TIMP-4 was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis. The results suggested reduced levels of TIMP-4 in ICM and DCM as compared to normal heart. TIMP-4 was purified by reverse phase HPLC and gelatin-sepharose affinity chromatography. Collagenase inhibitory activity of chromatographic peaks was determined using fluorescein-conjugated collagen as substrate and fluorescence spectroscopy. The activity of TIMP-4 (27 kDa) was characterized by reverse zymography. The role of TIMP-4 in cardiac fibroblast cell migration was examined using Boyden chamber analysis. The results suggested that TIMP-4 inhibited cardiac fibroblast cells migration and collagen gel invasion. To test whether TIMP-4 induces apoptosis, we cultured cardiac normal and polyomavirus transformed fibroblast cells in the presence and absence of TIMP-4. The number of cells were measured and DNA laddering was determined. The results suggested that TIMP-4 controlled normal cardiac fibroblast transformation and induced apoptosis in transformed cells. Cardiospecific TIMP-4 plays a significant role in regulating the normal cell phenotype. The reduced levels of TIMP-4 elicit cellular transformation and may lead to adverse extracellular matrix degradation (remodeling), cardiac hypertrophy and failure.

The principal component of Aconitum remedies is usually aconitine, a site 2 neurotoxin that may induce severe neurological symptoms and cardiovascular collapse. Some Aconitum species also contain lappaconitine, the structure of which is remarkably similar to that of aconitine. In contrast to aconitine, a sodium channel agonist, lappaconitine reportedly blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in heart tissue. The results in the present study demonstrate that lappaconitine blocks cloned human heart (hH1) sodium channels under whole-cell, voltage-clamp conditions. Lappaconitine binding has several characteristics in common with the binding of site 2 neurotoxins, such as aconitine and batrachotoxin. For example, lappaconitine binds almost exclusively to open channels, but has little affect on resting or inactivated channels. Moreover, lappaconitine binding is inhibited by bupivacaine, a tertiary amine local anesthetic. Whereas site 2 neurotoxins often irreversibly modify channel kinetics, lappaconitine irreversibly blocks the channels. Finally, channels containing lysine substitutions within the local anesthetic receptor region at residues F1760 or N1765 are resistant to block by bupivacaine or lappaconitine. Given that site 2 neurotoxins and local anesthetics have nonidentical but overlapping binding regions, these data suggest that lappaconitine irreversibly blocks hH1 channels by binding to the site 2 receptor.", "journal": "Molecular pharmacology", "date": "2001-02-13", "authors": ["S NWright"], "doi": "10.1124/mol.59.2.183"}

Recent studies demonstrated that the cardiac calpain system is activated during ischaemic events and is involved in cardiomyocyte injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of AT(1) and AT(2) receptors in the regulation of calpain-mediated myocardial damage following myocardial infarction (MI). 2. Infarcted animals were treated either with placebo, the ACE inhibitor ramipril (1 mg kg(-1) d(-1)), the AT(1) receptor antagonist valsartan (10 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) or the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD 123319 (30 mg kg(-1) d(-1)). Treatment was started 7 days prior to surgery. On day 1, 3, 7 and 14 after MI, gene expression and protein levels of calpain I, II and calpastatin were determined in left ventricular free wall (LVFW) and interventricular septum (IS). At day 3 and 14 post MI, morphological investigations were performed. 3. Calpain I mRNA expression and protein levels were increased in IS 14 days post MI, whereas mRNA expression and protein levels of calpain II were maximally increased in LVFW 3 days post MI. Ramipril and valsartan decreased mRNA and protein up-regulation of calpain I and II, and reduced infarct size and interstitial fibrosis. PD 123319 did not affect calpain I or II up-regulation in the infarcted myocardium, but decreased interstitial fibrosis. Calpastatin expression and translation were not affected by AT receptor antagonists or ACE inhibitor. 4. Our data demonstrate a distinct, temporary-spatial up-regulation of calpain I and II following MI confer with the hypothesis of calpain I being involved in cardiac remodelling in the late and calpain II contributing to cardiac tissue damage in the early phase of MI.

In the aortic rings of STZ rats, the Na-K-ATPase-dependent (86)Rb/K uptake was reduced to 60.0 +/- 5.5% of the control value (P < 0.01). However, Na-K-ATPase activity in soleus skeletal muscle fibers of STZ rats and paired control rats was similar, showing that the reduction of Na-K-ATPase activity in aortas of STZ rats is tissue specific. To functionally distinguish the contributions of ouabain-resistant (alpha(1)) and ouabain-sensitive (alpha(2) and alpha(3)) isoforms to the Na-K-ATPase activity in aortic rings, we used either a high (10(-3) M) or a low (10(-5) M) ouabain concentration during (86)Rb/K uptake. We found that the reduction in total Na-K-ATPase activity resulted from a dramatic decrement in ouabain-sensitive mediated (86)Rb/K uptake (26.0 +/- 3.9% of control, P < 0.01). Western blot analysis of membrane fractions from aortas of STZ rats demonstrated a significant reduction in protein levels of alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-catalytic isoforms (alpha(1) = 71.3 +/- 9.8% of control values, P < 0.05; alpha(2) = 44.5 +/- 11.3% of control, P < 0.01). In contrast, aortic rings from the STZ rats demonstrated an increase in NKCC1 activity (172.5 +/- 9.5%, P < 0.01); however, in heart tissue no difference in NKCC1 activity was seen between control and diabetic animals. Transport studies of endothelium-denuded or intact aortic rings demonstrated that the endothelium stimulates both Na-K-ATPase and Na-K-2Cl dependent (86)Rb/K uptake. The endothelium-dependent stimulation of Na-K-ATPase and Na-K-2Cl was not hampered by diabetes.

The degree of dynamic instability of the action potential model was controlled by varying the maximal amplitude of the slow inward Ca(2+) current to produce spiral waves in homogeneous tissue that were either nearly stable, meandering, hypermeandering, or in breakup regimes. Fixed electrophysiological heterogeneity was modeled by randomly varying action potential duration over different spatial scales to create dispersion of refractoriness. We found that the degree of dispersion of refractoriness required to induce wave break decreased markedly as dynamic instability of the cardiac model increased.

Both NOS3 protein abundance and calcium-dependent NOS activity were elevated in old compared with young adult hearts (7.2+/-1.1 versus 4.2+/-0.6 pmol/mg protein, respectively, P=0.03).

Essentially no p85 alpha subunit of PI 3-kinase was found to be associated with insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 or IRS-2 in basal and insulin-stimulated (5 min) cardiomyocytes. Instead, insulin produced a twofold increase in p85 beta associated with IRS-1, leading to a three- to fourfold increase in p85 beta-associated PI 3-kinase activity. This response was significantly reduced in obese animals. Comparable results were obtained in the intact heart after in vivo stimulation. In GLUT-4-containing vesicles, an increased abundance (3.7 +/- 0.7-fold over basal) of p85 alpha was observed after insulin stimulation of lean animals, with no significant effect in the obese group. No p85 beta could be detected in GLUT-4-containing vesicles. Recruitment of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase and a twofold increase in enzyme activity in GLUT-4-containing vesicles by insulin was observed only in lean rats. We conclude that, in the heart, p85 alpha recruits PI 3-kinase activity to GLUT-4 vesicles, whereas p85 beta represents the main regulator of IRS-1- and IRS-2-mediated PI 3-kinase activation. Furthermore, multiple defects of PI 3-kinase activation, involving both the p85 alpha and the p85 beta adaptor subunits, may contribute to cardiac insulin resistance.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.
