{"title": "[The heart].", "abstract": "The growing incidence of heart failure and the limitations of cardiac transplantation and totally implantable artificial hearts justify the search for alternative therapies. Self-reconstruction of the heart might be one of them. It is based on the use of an animal-derived decellularized scaffold reseeded with cells able to reconstitute a contractile, vascular and valvular pattern affording normal cardiac function. Whereas decellularization techniques are currently well controlled, the choice of cell type to generate the different constituents of cardiac tissue (cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, smooth vascular cells, myofibroblasts), and the optimal mode of cell transfer, are still far from clear. Furthermore, scaffold recolonization is not only dependent on the phenotype of the grafted cells: it is also influenced by the nature of the biochemical signals emitted by the scaffold and by the physical state of the substrate. Modulation of these two factors can influence the contractile performance of the self-rebuilt organ. The complexity of these challenges is such that total replacement of the heart by a self-built organ is at best a far-off perspective. However, continued pursuit of this objective stimulates the development of bioengineering techniques, and partial replacement of heart tissue by cell-seeded scaffolds appears more feasible. Applications could include the strengthening of infarcted myocardium and, possibly, cardiac valve replacement.", "journal": "Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine", "date": "2012-07-21", "authors": ["PhilippeMenasch\u00e9"], "doi": null}

The present study investigates the ability of Aegle marmelos fruit extract to prevent pathological changes and oxidative stress after isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats. In vitro studies showed that Aegle marmelos fruit extract possesses antioxidant activity. Administration of isoproterenol (85\u00a0mg/kg body weight) to rats resulted in significantly elevated plasma transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase, however, cardiac tissue analyses showed decreased activity of the above enzymes compared to experimental control rats. Further, isoproterenol administration significantly increased plasma and cardiac tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lowered the activities of cardiac tissue superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase when compared to control groups. Pretreatment with Aegle marmelos fruit extract at a dose of 150\u00a0mg/kg body weight for a period of 45 days significantly prevented the observed alterations.

In isolated mitochondria, UCP-2 content by Western blots, membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) by tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), and relative superoxide levels by dihydroethidium (DHE) were measured. Oxygen respiration was determined at baseline and after 10 min anoxia-reoxygenation.

Exercise training (ET) is thought to have a beneficial effect on these disorders, but the basis for this effect is not fully understood. Because endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathological events leading to cardiovascular complications in T2D, we hypothesized that the effects of ET will be evidenced by improvements in coronary endothelial function. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of ET on vascular function of diabetic (db/db, Lepr(db)) mice by evaluating endothelial function of isolated coronary arterioles of wild-type (WT) and db/db mice with/without ET. Although dilation of vessels to the endothelial-independent vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside was not different between db/db and WT, dilation to the endothelial-dependent agonist, acetylcholine (ACh), was impaired in db/db compared to WT mice. Vasodilation to ACh was restored in db/db with ET and insulin sensitivity was improved in the db/db after ET. Exercise did not change body weight of db/db, but superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2) and phosphorylated- eNOS protein (Ser1177) expression in heart tissue was up-regulated whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) protein level was decreased by ET. Serum level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was higher in db/db mice but ET decreased IL-6. This suggests that ET may improve endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability as well as decreasing chronic inflammation.

However, its clinical use is severely limited by the development of a progressive dose-dependent cardiomyopathy that results in irreversible congestive heart failure. To provide a strategy for constraining or minimizing the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP, a pirarubicin liposome powder (L-THP) was appropriately prepared, and the cumulative cardiotoxicity of L-THP and free THP (F-THP) were investigated on Sprague-Dawley rats after 3 successive doses. Urinary samples for metabonomic study, serum samples for biochemical assay, and heart samples for histopathology test were collected. As a result, the metabonomics-based findings such as PLS-DA plotting showed minimal metabolic alterations in L-THP as compared to F-THP, and correlated with the changes of serum biochemical assay and cardiac histopathology as measurements of damage to heart tissue. Our results confirm that when encapsulated into liposomes, the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP can be greatly ameliorated. Lipophilic aglycone metabolites of THP associated with redox cycling are cardiotoxic for the possibility of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Also, metabonomic analysis shows that the successive doses of THP will lead to severe metabolic pathways disturbances in the cell energy production.

{"title": "[Aldosterone as an endogenous cardiovascular toxin and the options for its therapeutic management].", "abstract": "In physiological, as well as pathological situations, aldosterone significantly influences volume, pressure and electrolyte balance. Primary hyperaldosteronism is caused by autonomous over-production, most frequently due to adrenal adenoma. Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) have more pronounced left ventricular hypertrophy and higher frequency of cardiovascular events than patients with essential hypertension (EH) with comparable blood pressure values. Consequently, there is an increased interest in the role ofaldosterone tissue function in cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present paper is to emphasise the pleiotropic actions of aldosterone on cardiovascular system and the options for their therapeutic management. Apart from the effects of circulating aldosterone on BP and its renal actions on water and electrolyte excretion, extra-renal effects are also been explored; paracrine affects through tissue mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) may impact on endothelial dysfunction, vascular elasticity, inflammatory changes in the myocardium, vessels and kidneys. Initial oxidative stress due to increased aldosterone concentrations may initiate subclinical endothelial changes and subsequent myocardial fibrosis. The effects on all three layers of vascular wall, together with increased blood coagulation and vascular thrombogenicity increases likelihood of microthrombosis and tissue microinfarctions. Slight increase in aldosterone concentrations in cardiac tissue adversely affects myofibrils as well as coronary artery function. Similar to peripheral vessels, it increases collagen content and changes vascular rigidity and the velocity of pulse wave and facilitates development of perivascular fibrosis. Higher salt intake may potentiate these pathophysiological effects of aldosterone, while higher intake of potassium may restrict them. Aldosterone vasculopathy together with perivascular fibrosis occurring at aldosterone concentrations seen with heart failure contributes to manifestation of heart failure. Consequently, aldosterone may rightly be called \"cardiovascular toxin\". The adverse effects of aldosterone in patients on long-term ACEI therapy are further facilitated by the aldosterone's ability to evade inhibitory effects of ACEI and parallel activation of renin-angiotensin system. To manage these situations, receptors of mineralcorticoids or direct renin inhibitor aliskiren are used. The positive effect of MR blockade is based on an increased release of nitric oxide (NO) with further improvement in endothelial functions. Detailed review of pleotropic effects of aldosterone helps to clarify a number of pathophysiological situations in essential hypertension, supports the view ofaldosterone as a potential cardiovascular toxin and indicates the use of mineralocorticoid receptor blockers in resistant hypertension and patients with cardiovascular or renal organ damage.", "journal": "Vnitrni lekarstvi", "date": "2012-01-27", "authors": ["KHork\u00fd"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Spatiotemporal control of cell fate and cardiac differentiation.", "abstract": "Congestive heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide [1]. Although not the only cause of congestive heart failure, loss of myocardium due to obstructive coronary artery disease is a major contributor to this condition [2,3]. The loss of myocardium is mainly regional and, therefore, localized therapy holds the most promise. In recent years, many clinical studies have been initiated to deliver localized therapy in the form of various cell types for reconstitution of the myocardium [4-6]. However, there is much debate on the optimal cell type, whether or not stem cells can differentiate into functional myocardium and the long-term effects of these non-myocytes. In addition to exogenous cell delivery, paracrine effects arising from delivery of angiogenic factors and other biochemical agents suggest that the myocardium retains the ability to remodel and heal [7,8]. Understandably, there has been tremendous focus on both growth factor- and gene therapy-based therapeutics. While a source of great promise, direct growth factor delivery to the myocardium will most likely be inefficient as several studies have noted that many of these small proteins are carried away in the highly vascularized cardiac tissue [9,10]. Gene therapy, while providing an excellent analytical tool, has not met with enthusiasm clinically, mostly due to the inability to quantify delivery and nonspecific targeting in vivo. This body of work supports two crucial conclusions: (1) appropriate biological cues that act locally on the myocardium can improve functional outcomes, and (2) spatiotemporal control over the delivery and presentation of these cues remains challenging and inefficient. The current body of work on cardiac drug delivery and stem cell therapy support two crucial conclusions: (1) appropriate biological cues that act locally on the myocardium can improve functional outcomes, and (2) spatiotemporal control over the delivery and presentation of these cues remains challenging and inefficient. Using specialized biomaterials, we are able to address this. Our laboratory has used functional nanoparticles to deliver regenerative cues with both spatial and temporal control. By adding biomimetic signals to the surface of the nanoparticles, we are able to enhance nonphagocytic cell uptake, achieve cell-specific targeting, and deliver molecules in a time-controlled manner. Furthermore, by combining our nanoparticles with self-assembling peptide nanofibers, we can achieve some of these in 3D while retaining implanted cells. Following infarction, and during cell differentiation and survival, there are unique sequences of events that contribute to the pathophysiology of the processes. By enhanced understanding of these signals, and the spatiotemporal control needed to deliver them, it will help design better therapeutics for cardiac regeneration. Using high-throughput screening, we have identified several carbohydrates that bind with high affinity to both cardiomyocytes and cardiac progenitor cells. For example, n-acetylglucasmine (GlcNAc) and related sugars bound with high affinity to both of these important cell types. Modification of the sugars with phospholipds allowed incorporation of into hydrophobic nanoparticles with high fidelity. When delivered to cardiomyocytes or cardiac progenitor cells, these biologically-modified nanoparticles enhanced uptake by several fold. In addition to using sugars, we also used metal affinity chromatography chemistry to link Nickel-NTA to the outside of nanoparticles. This not only allowed for conjugation of Histidine-tagged proteins to the outside for temporal delivery, but also allowed for conjugation of cell-specific targeting agents as well. Indeed, when His-VE-Cadherin was used as a model targeting agent, binding and uptake by endothelial cells increased significantly. For cell therapy, incorporation of proper signals to the micoenvironment is critical. One such signal that greatly impacts differentiation is the Notch1 pathway. We were able to immobilize Jagged1, the ligand of Notch1, on to self-assembling peptide nanofibers. Inclusion of this bioactive signal significantly enhanced cardiogenic differentiation.

{"title": "Effects of lead spatial resolution on the spectrum of cardiac signals: a simulation study.", "abstract": "Spectral analysis is widely applied to bioelectric cardiac signals for quantifying the spatiotemporal organization of cardiac tissue. Nevertheless, to date it is not well understood how lead characteristics affect the spectrum of recorded cardiac signals and, as a consequence, the interpretation of cardiac spectrum is still controversial. In this paper we use simulation methods to investigate the effects of lead spatial resolution on the spectrum of cardiac signals. We simulate three cardiac rhythms of different degrees of spatiotemporal organization in a square sample of cardiac tissue. Then, by using a lead field approach, we synthesize the signals recorded by four idealized leads of different spatial resolution. Finally, we estimate the spectrum of simulated cardiac signals. Our simulations indicate that lead spatial resolution affects cardiac spectrum, although the effects depend on the organization of the underlying rhythm. Specifically, our simulations show that for highly organized rhythms, the smaller the lead resolution region, the broader the distribution of power in frequency. Since lead resolution can affect significantly cardiac spectrum, we conclude that caution should be used when quantifying cardiac spatiotemporal organization based on the spectrum of cardiac signals.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Experimental validation of alternating transillumination for imaging intramural wave propagation.", "abstract": "Current techniques to map intramural activation patterns in ex vivo cardiac tissue have limited spatial resolution. Here, we report on the experimental validation of a novel optical technique that was recently proposed to resolve the size and depth of intramural wave fronts using alternating transillumination (AT). AT was achieved by simultaneously mapping the epi- and endocardial surfaces with two synchronized CCD cameras and rapidly alternating LED illumination between both surfaces. Optical phantoms were made based on tissue optical properties measured using a hybrid optical spectrometer. Spherical fluorescent sources (Scarlet microspheres, Invitrogen, UK) of varying sizes were embedded at known depths in the phantoms. Coronary-perfused procine left ventricular slab preparations were stained with DI-4-ANBDQBS (n = 3) and paced at known intramural depths. In phantoms we were able to reliably estimate the depth of the center of fluorescent sources (9.6 \u00b1 5.4% error), as well as their transmural extent (15.7 \u00b1 11.5% error). In ventricular slabs we were able to localize the sites of origin of intramural excitation waves with a precision of \u00b1 1.6 mm. Transmural conduction velocities were, for the first time, measured optically from the surfaces and found to be 21.0 \u00b1 12.4 cm/s. In conclusion, alternating transillumination is a promising technique for reliable reconstruction of depth and expansion rate of intramural activation wave fronts in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

However, since a CEW delivers rapid electrical pulses through injected probes, the risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF) has been considered. Animal studies have shown that the tip of the probe must come within a few millimeters of the surface of the heart for the CEW to induce VF in a typical animal application. Early calculations of the CEW VF risk in humans used sophisticated 3-D chest models to determine the size of the probe landing areas that had cardiac tissue within a given distance of the inner surface of the ribs. This produced a distribution of area (cm(2)) vs. mm of depth. Echocardiography was then used to determine the shortest distance from the skin surface to the cardiac surface. This produced a population distribution of skin-to-heart (STH) distances. These 2 distributions were then convolved to arrive at a probability of inducing VF for a typical human CEW application. With 900, 000 probe-mode field uses to date, epidemiological results have shown that these initial VF risk estimates were significant overestimates. We present model refinements that take into account the gender and body-mass-index (BMI) of the target demographics and produce VF risk estimates concordant with the epidemiological results.

{"title": "Preprocessing of fluoresced transmembrane potential signals for cardiac optical mapping.", "abstract": "Fluorescence imaging of transmembrane voltage-sensitive dyes is used to study electrical activation in cardiac tissue. However, fluorescence signals typically have a low signal to noise ratio that can be contaminated with motion artifacts. We describe an alternative processing approach for fluoresced transmembrane potentials (fTmps) using the wavelet multiresolution analysis. We show that fTmp signals can be decomposed and reconstructed to form three sub-signals that contain signal noise (noise signal), the early depolarization phase of the action potential (rTmp signal), and motion artifact (rMA signal). Discrete wavelet transform is used with coiflet 4 scaling and wavelet functions for fTmp decomposition and reconstruction of these sub-signals. Our results show that this type of analysis can be used to remove baseline drift, reduce noise, and reveal wavefronts. It streamlines the preprocessing of fTmps for subsequent measurement of activation times and conduction velocities. The approach is promising for studying wave fronts without aggressive mechanical tissue constraint or electromechanical uncoupling agents, and it is particularly useful for single camera systems that do not provide for ratiometric imaging.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The coordinated functions can be simulated by computational cardiac cell models, which could not only overcome the practical and ethical limitations in physical experiments but also provide predictive insights on the underlying mechanisms. This investigation is aimed at modeling the variations of cardiac electrical signaling due to changes in glycosylation of a voltage-gated K+ channel, hERG, responsible for late phase 2 and phase 3 of the human ventricular AP. The voltage-dependence of hERG channels steady-state activation and inactivation under four glycosylation conditions, i.e., full glycosylation, reduced sialylation, mannose-rich and N-Glycanase treated, demonstrated that reduced glycosylation modulates hERG channel gating. Here, the proposed multi-scale computer model incorporates the measured changes in hERG channel gating observed under conditions of reduced glycosylation, and further predicts the electrical behaviors of cardiac cells and tissues (cable/ring). The multi-scale modeling results show that reduced glycosylation would act to shorten the repolarization period of cardiac APs, and distort the AP propagation in cardiac tissues. This multi-scale modeling investigation reveals novel mechanisms of hERG channel modulation by regulated glycosylation that also impact cardiac myocyte and tissue functions.

To assess viability of the slices on consecutive days after preparation, drug effects on FP/AP parameters, like duration and latency, were monitored.\nIn the presence of the potassium channel blocker E4031 (1 \u03bcM), FP and AP duration (FPD and APD) were significantly increased (FPD, 39.0%; APD, 28.1%) in guinea-pig ventricular slices. Similar changes were observed 24-28 h after slice preparation (FPD, 48.6%; APD, 25.4%). Furthermore, AP duration was reduced in the presence of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (10 \u03bcM) on the day of preparation (40.5%) and 24-28 h later (38.7%). In contrast, in the presence of the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (30 mM) AP duration was prolonged 4.95 and 4.19-fold, 2-8 h and 24-28 h after preparation, respectively. Finally, FP propagation was repeatedly slowed down by the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (30 \u03bcM), as revealed from FP onset latency increases observed on three consecutive days (2-8 h after preparation, 93.0%; 24-28 h, 76.8%, 48-56 h, 61.7%).\nFreshly isolated cardiac slices reproduced established physiological and pharmacological responses for more than 24 h after preparation.

Here, we describe 11 young patients (5-13 years) with a predominant presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Metabolic investigations showed deficient protein N-glycosylation, leading to a diagnosis of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). Homozygosity mapping in the consanguineous families showed a locus with two known genes in the N-glycosylation pathway. In all individuals, pathogenic mutations were identified in DOLK, encoding the dolichol kinase responsible for formation of dolichol-phosphate. Enzyme analysis in patients' fibroblasts confirmed a dolichol kinase deficiency in all families. In comparison with the generally multisystem presentation in CDG, the nonsyndromic DCM in several individuals was remarkable. Investigation of other dolichol-phosphate dependent glycosylation pathways in biopsied heart tissue indicated reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan with concomitant functional loss of its laminin-binding capacity, which has been linked to DCM.

Temperature-induced nerve failure may play an important role in determining organismal thermal tolerance limits and distribution patterns. To expand our understanding of the role of neuronal thermal performance in setting thermal limits, we compared the thermal performance of neurons from five porcelain crab (genus Petrolisthes) congeners that differ in thermal habitat. In experiment 1, neuronal performance of sensory neurons was determined by extracellular recording of spontaneous action potentials during thermal ramps. Arrhenius break temperatures of action potential generation were used to calculate maximum critical temperature (CT(max)) and minimum critical temperature (CT(min)) for neuronal performance. CT(max) and CT(min) were related to habitat temperature across the five species and were found to respond to acclimation temperature. In experiment 2, we assessed the performance of neurons from Petrolisthes cinctipes acclimated at 8\u00b0, 18\u00b0, and 25\u00b0C when placed at 30\u00b0C (near the whole-organism CT(max) of this species) and demonstrated that neural performance near whole-organism CT(max) increases with increasing acclimation temperature. In experiment 3, we compared the thermal limits of sensory afferents and pacemaker efferents and found that they were correlated, although pacemaker efferents tended to have a higher CT(max) and reduced plasticity.

{"title": "Single cell transcriptional profiling of adult mouse cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "While numerous studies have examined gene expression changes from homogenates of heart tissue, this prevents studying the inherent stochastic variation between cells within a tissue. Isolation of pure cardiomyocyte populations through a collagenase perfusion of mouse hearts facilitates the generation of single cell microarrays for whole transcriptome gene expression, or qPCR of specific targets using nanofluidic arrays. We describe here a procedure to examine single cell gene expression profiles of cardiomyocytes isolated from the heart. This paradigm allows for the evaluation of metrics of interest which are not reliant on the mean (for example variance between cells within a tissue) which is not possible when using conventional whole tissue workflows for the evaluation of gene expression (Figure 1). We have achieved robust amplification of the single cell transcriptome yielding micrograms of double stranded cDNA that facilitates the use of microarrays on individual cells. In the procedure we describe the use of NimbleGen arrays which were selected for their ease of use and ability to customize their design. Alternatively, a reverse transcriptase - specific target amplification (RT-STA) reaction, allows for qPCR of hundreds of targets by nanofluidic PCR. Using either of these approaches, it is possible to examine the variability of expression between cells, as well as examining expression profiles of rare cell types from within a tissue.

In in vivo and ex vivo models, rat hearts were subjected to 30 min of regional ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion with dexmedetomidine before ischemia. The \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine was also given before ischemia, alone or with dexmedetomidine. Erk1/2, Akt and eNOS phosphorylations were determined before ischemia/reperfusion. Cardioprotection after regional ischemia/reperfusion was assessed from infarct size measurement and ventricular function recovery. Localization of \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptors in cardiac tissue was also assessed. Dexmedetomidine preconditioning increased levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2, Akt and eNOS forms before ischemia/reperfusion; being significantly reversed by yohimbine in both models. Dexmedetomidine preconditioning (in vivo model) and peri-insult protection (ex vivo model) significantly reduced myocardial infarction size, improved functional recovery and yohimbine abolished dexmedetomidine-induced cardioprotection in both models.

A strong cation exchange (SCX) monolithic cartridge was used to enrich analyte, improve robustness, and reduce biological complexity. A simple modifier-free mobile phase was employed to improve sensitivity and reproducibility. This method exhibits consistent precision and accuracy, and the RSDs or REs of all the intraday and interday determinations were within 10%. The calibration curve was linear across the examined dynamic range from 1nM to 500nM (r(2)=0.996). LOD and LOQ were determined to be 0.257nM and 0.857nM respectively, while LLOQ was below 10nM. This method was used to monitor changes of adenosine levels in patient plasma drawn intraoperatively during on-pump CABG surgery. The analysis of 84 patients revealed that the mean concentration of adenosine in coronary sinus plasma after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is higher than that in coronary sinus before CPB (p=0.0024; two-tailed t-test) and that in radial artery plasma after CPB (p=0.0409; two-tailed t-test). These findings suggest that the equilibrium between adenosine production and elimination has favored the elevation of adenosine basal level during on-pump CABG surgery and the change is specific to heart tissues. Evaluation of adenosine with a sensitive and robust analytical method has important implications on providing consistent results and meaningful insights into adenosine regulation, as well as its steady state and sustained action on the heart.

Murine ESCs were cultured on electrospun polymeric scaffolds and their differentiation to cardiomyocytes was assessed through measurements of viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), \u03b1-myosin heavy chain expression (\u03b1-MHC), and intracellular Ca(2+) signaling dynamics. Interestingly, ESCs on the most compliant substrate, 4%PEG-86%PCL-10%CPCL, exhibited the highest \u03b1-MHC expression as well as the most mature Ca(2+) signaling dynamics. To investigate the role of scaffold modulus in ESC differentiation, the scaffold fiber density was reduced by altering the electrospinning parameters. The reduced modulus was found to enhance \u03b1-MHC gene expression, and promote maturation of myocyte Ca(2+) handling. These data indicate that ESC-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation can be promoted by tuning the mechanical and chemical properties of polymer scaffold via copolymerization and electrospinning techniques.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-01-05", "authors": ["Mukesh KGupta", "Joel MWalthall", "RaghavVenkataraman", "Spencer WCrowder", "Dae KwangJung", "Shann SYu", "Tromondae KFeaster", "XintongWang", "Todd DGiorgio", "Charles CHong", "Franz JBaudenbacher", "Antonis KHatzopoulos", "Hak-JoonSung"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0028935"}

Activity of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB is increased in the diseased heart; however, our present understanding of how the individual subunits contribute to cardiovascular disease is limited. We assign a new role for the c-Rel subunit as a stimulator of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. We discovered that c-Rel-deficient mice have smaller hearts at birth, as well as during adulthood, and are protected from developing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis after chronic angiotensin infusion. Results of both gene expression and cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analyses identified transcriptional activators of hypertrophy, myocyte enhancer family, Gata4, and Tbx proteins as Rel gene targets. We suggest that the p50 subunit could limit the prohypertrophic actions of c-Rel in the normal heart, because p50 overexpression in H9c2 cells repressed c-Rel levels and the absence of cardiac p50 was associated with increases in both c-Rel levels and cardiac hypertrophy. We report for the first time that c-Rel is highly expressed and confined to the nuclei of diseased adult human hearts but is restricted to the cytoplasm of normal cardiac tissues. We conclude that c-Rel-dependent signaling is critical for both cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy.

{"title": "Cardiac bidomain bath-loading effects during arrhythmias: interaction with anatomical heterogeneity.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue is always surrounded by conducting fluid, both in\u00a0vivo (blood) and in experimental preparations (Tyrode's solution), which acts to increase conduction velocity (CV) close to the tissue-fluid interface, inducing transmural wavefront curvature. Despite its potential importance, computer modeling studies focused on arrhythmia mechanisms have previously not accounted for these bath-loading effects. Here, we investigate the increase in CV and concomitant change in transmural wavefront profiles upon both propagation and arrhythmia dynamics within models of differing anatomical complexity. In simplified slab models, in absence of transmural fiber rotation, bath-loading induced transmural wavefront curvature dominates, significantly increasing arrhythmia complexity compared to no bath. In the presence of fiber rotation, bath-loading effects are less striking and depend upon propagation direction: the bath accentuates natural concave curvature caused by transmurally rotating fibers, but attenuates convex curvature, which negates overall impact upon arrhythmia complexity. Finally, we demonstrate that the high degree of anatomical complexity within whole ventricular models modulates bath-loading induced transmural wavefront curvature. However, key is the increased surface CV that dramatically reduces both arrhythmia inducibility and resulting complexity by increasing wavelength and reducing the available excitable gap. Our findings highlight the importance of including bath-loading effects during arrhythmia mechanism investigations, which could have implications for interpreting and comparing simulation results with experimental data where such effects are inherently present.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2012-01-03", "authors": ["Martin JBishop", "EdwardVigmond", "GernotPlank"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2011.10.052"}

Among other adverse health effects, khat chewing has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in heavy consumers. This study was carried out to examine the direct effects of Catha edulis extract on contractility of spontaneously contracting, isolated rabbit heart and to investigate its mechanism of action. Isolated six rabbit's hearts attached to a Langendorff apparatus were perfused with extract at a constant flow rate and continuously bubbled with a 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture. Each heart served as its own control, as responses were recorded before and after administration of C. edulis extract. Varying concentrations of extract (50, 100 and 250\u00a0mg/ml) were loaded in the perfusate, their effects recorded and effluent fluid collected for assay of cardiac enzymes. Histological examination of the cardiac tissue was performed at the end of perfusion with 250\u00a0mg/ml extract. This study revealed that acute exposure to C. edulis extract exerted negative inotropic and chronotropic effects on isolated hearts. The extract also had a vasoconstrictor effect on coronary vessels, independent of \u03b11 adrenergic receptor stimulation. Histological examination of hearts perfused with 250\u00a0mg/ml C. edulis extract revealed the presence of histological changes unique to myocardial infarction, a finding consistent with observed increased levels of cardiac enzymes in perfusates. Thus, we have demonstrated experimentally a direct cardiac depressant- and MI inducing effects of C. edulis extract.

We postulate on numerical basis the possibility to induce a stable spiral wave in the arterial wall. Such a spiral wave can inhibit the propagation of the axial calcium wave and effectively stop the vasomotion. We also discuss the dynamics of the circumferential calcium wave in comparison to rotors in venous ostia that are a common source of supraventricular ectopy. We show that the velocity and in consequence the frequency range of the circumferential calcium wave is by orders of magnitude too small compared to that of the rotors. The mechanism of the rotor is not likely to involve the calcium-related dynamics of the smooth muscle cells. The calcium-related dynamics which is voltage-independent and hard to be reset seems to actually protect the blood vessels against the electric activity of the atria.

In isolated mitochondria, mPTP opening is triggered by calcium overload facilitated by oxidative stress. In isolated cells, however, it has been suggested that mPTP opening occurs before calcium overload and is stimulated by oxidative stress. Our objective was to establish the events that cause mPTP opening in the intact heart.\nWe performed multiphoton imaging of Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts expressing an inducible, Ca(2+)-sensitive reporter (circularly Permuted GFP and calmodulin (CaM), version 2), to examine the spatiotemporal relationship between [Ca(2+)](c), redox state, and mPTP opening in the intact heart during hypoxia and reoxygenation at sub-myocyte resolution. We found that during reperfusion, calcium waves propagated across multiple cells at 3.3 \u00b5m/s. mPTP opening caused an abrupt loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, measured using a potentiometric dye, which was invariably preceded by a rise in [Ca(2+)](c). The probability that localized [Ca(2+)](c) waves led to mPTP opening was greater early during reoxygenation. During reoxygenation, coordinated redox changes also occurred across large regions and preceded mPTP opening on average by 122 \u00b1 38 s. Fewer [Ca(2+)] waves led to mPTP opening in the presence of mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A or mitochondrial-targeted scavenger of reactive oxygen species, MitoQ.\nThese experiments define the spatiotemporal relationship between changes in [Ca(2+)](c), redox state and mPTP opening during reoxygenation in the intact heart.

It is expressed in the heart and is thought to play a role in the regulation of iron homeostasis in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. We have shown that expression of Hepc1 is strongly down-regulated in the heart of the cTnT(R141W) transgenic mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) at 3\u00a0months of age. Transgenic mice with heart tissue-specific Hepc1 expression alone or in combination with the cTnT(R141W) mutation were produced to study the effects of Hepc1 on DCM. Transgenic expression of Hepc1 was found to be nonlethal and resulted in decreased mortality in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice, from 29.6 to 7.4%(n\u00a0 =\u00a027; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), through 7\u00a0months of age. Expression of Hepc1 also brought about increases in the left ventricular wall, as well as ejection fraction and fractional shortening. In addition, the expression of Hepc1 inhibited the fibrosis and ultra-structural alterations seen in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice. Furthermore, transgenic expression of Hepc1 restored the iron level and phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the heart tissues of cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice. It was concluded that transgenic expression of Hepc1 compensated for the loss of Hepc1 expression and the release of iron and brought about a marked improvement in the pathologic phenotype of DCM, in which the ERK1/2 signal pathway might play an important role.", "journal": "Transgenic research", "date": "2011-12-27", "authors": ["LiZhang", "DanLu", "WeiZhang", "XiongzhiQuan", "WeiDong", "YanfengXu", "LianfengZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11248-011-9582-y"}

We find that randomly distributed heterogeneities in the medium have a decremental effect on the velocity, and above a critical density of such heterogeneities the conduction fails.

However, SIRT1 mRNA levels decreased in the DM group compared to controls and increased in the DM+RSV group when compared to the DM group. SIRT1 is activated by RSV treatment in diabetic heart tissue. Activation of SIRT1 by RSV may lead to a new therapeutic approach for diabetic heart tissue. We conclude that RSV treatment can alleviate heart dysfunction by inhibiton of inflammatory gene expression such as SIRT1.", "journal": "Genetics and molecular research : GMR", "date": "2011-12-20", "authors": ["A SYar", "SMenevse", "EAlp"], "doi": "10.4238/2011.November.29.7"}

Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is essential for the adequate remethylation of homocysteine, which is the dominant pathway for homocysteine removal during early embryonic development.\nHere, we report that the c.56+781 A>C (rs326119) variant of intron-1 of MTRR significantly increases the risk of CHD in the Han Chinese population. In 3 independent case-control studies involving a total of 2340 CHD patients and 2270 healthy control participants from different geographic areas, we observed that patients carrying the heterozygous AC and homozygous CC genotype had a 1.40-fold (odds ratio=1.40; P=2.32\u00d710(-7)) and 1.84-fold (odds ratio=1.84; P=2.3\u00d710(-11)) increased risk, respectively, of developing CHD than those carrying the wild-type AA genotype. Both in vivo quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of MTRR mRNA in cardiac tissue samples from CHD patients and in vitro luciferase assays in transfected cells demonstrated that the c.56+781 C allele profoundly decreased MTRR transcription. Further analysis demonstrated that the c.56+781 C allele manifested reduced CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 binding affinity. In addition, healthy individuals with the homozygous CC genotype had significantly elevated levels of plasma homocysteine compared with the wild-type AA carriers.\nWe have demonstrated that the MTRR c.56+781 A>C variant is an important genetic marker for increased CHD risk because this variant results in functionally reduced MTRR expression at the transcriptional level. Our results accentuate the significance of functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in noncoding regions of the homocysteine/folate metabolism pathway core genes for their potential contributions to the origin of CHD.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2011-12-20", "authors": ["Jian-YuanZhao", "Xue-YanYang", "Xiao-HongGong", "Zhuo-YaGu", "Wen-YuanDuan", "JueWang", "Zhi-ZhouYe", "Hong-BingShen", "Kai-HuShi", "JiaHou", "Guo-YingHuang", "LiJin", "BinQiao", "Hong-YanWang"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.050245"}

Loss of the GJA1-encoded gap junction channel protein connexin43 is known to underlie formation of lethal arrhythmias. GJA1 mutations have been associated with cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation. Therefore, GJA1 is a plausible candidate gene for premature sudden death.\nGJA1 open reading frame mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and direct DNA sequencing on DNA from 292 SIDS cases. Immunofluorescence and dual whole-cell patch-clamp studies were performed to determine the functionality of mutant gap junctions. Immunostaining for gap junction proteins was performed on SIDS-associated paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue. Two rare, novel missense mutations, E42K and S272P, were detected in 2 of 292 SIDS cases, a 2-month-old white boy and a 3-month-old white girl, respectively. Analysis of the E42K victim's parental DNA demonstrated a de novo mutation. Both mutations involved highly conserved residues and were absent in >1000 ethnically matched reference alleles. Immunofluorescence demonstrated no trafficking abnormalities for either mutation, and S272P demonstrated wild-type junctional conductance. However, junctional conductance measurements for the E42K mutation demonstrated a loss of function not rescued by wild type. Moreover, the E42K victim's cardiac tissue demonstrated a mosaic immunostaining pattern for connexin43 protein.\nThis study provides the first molecular and functional evidence implicating a GJA1 mutation as a novel pathogenic substrate for SIDS.

Bioreactors have been used to mimic aspects of these factors in vitro to engineer cardiac tissue but, due to design limitations, previous bioreactor systems have yet to simultaneously support nutrient perfusion, electrical stimulation and unconstrained (i.e. not isometric) tissue contraction. To the best of our knowledge, the bioreactor system described herein is the first to integrate these three key factors in concert. We present the design of our bioreactor and characterize its capability in integrated experimental and mathematical modelling studies. We then cultured cardiac cells obtained from neonatal rats in porous, channelled elastomer scaffolds with the simultaneous application of perfusion and electrical stimulation, with controls excluding either one or both of these two conditions. After 8 days of culture, constructs grown with simultaneous perfusion and electrical stimulation exhibited substantially improved functional properties, as evidenced by a significant increase in contraction amplitude (0.23 \u00b1 0.10% vs 0.14 \u00b1 0.05%, 0.13 \u00b1 0.08% or 0.09 \u00b1 0.02% in control constructs grown without stimulation, without perfusion, or either stimulation or perfusion, respectively). Consistently, these constructs had significantly improved DNA contents, cell distribution throughout the scaffold thickness, cardiac protein expression, cell morphology and overall tissue organization compared to control groups.

In this study, an in vitro cardiac muscle model was established on an MEA-based biochip with multiple cardiomyocytes that mimic cardiac tissue structure. Using a laser beam, stem cells were inserted adjacent to each muscle fiber (cell bridge model) and allowed to form cell-cell contact as determined by the formation of gap junctions. The electrical conductivity of stem cells was assessed and compared with the electrical conductivities of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts.

The ICMs isolated from IVF blastocysts were cultured on 10 \u03bcl/ml mitomycin-C inactivated fetal fibroblast feeder layer with LIF. The putative ES colonies were characterized for extracellular markers like alkaline phosphatase, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA-1, SSEA-4 by immunocytochemistry and intracellular markers like Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog with reverse-transcription-PCR. The ES cells were successfully subcultured up to 22nd passage with feeder layer and LIF and up to 12th passage without feeder layer with LIF only. They exhibited normal karyotyping (20th passage) and maintained the expression of specific surface markers like alkaline phosphatase, SSEA-4, TRA-1-61, TRA-1-81 and intracellular markers Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. The embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated from goat ES cells of 20th passage and were analyzed with markers like Gata4, BMP4 and Nestin. Differentiation was induced by medium containing 100 ng/ml Activin-A, 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and 100 ng/ml BMP-4. The embryoid bodies were analyzed with markers like Gata4, BMP4 and Nestin. The rhythmic beating of cardiomyocytes was observed after 30 d and the beating was still continuing even after 160 d of culturing.

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a family of intracellular Ca2+ release channels that control the flux of Ca2+ from internal stores into the cytosol. RyRs are primarily known for their role in excitation-contraction coupling in adult striated muscle and ryr gene mutations are implicated in several human diseases. Current evidence suggests that RyRs do not have a major role to play prior to organogenesis but regulate tissue differentiation.\nThe sequences of the five zebrafish ryr genes were confirmed, their evolutionary relationship established and the primary sequences compared to other vertebrates, including humans. RyRs are differentially expressed in slow (ryr1a), fast (ryr3) and both types (ryr1b) of developing skeletal muscle. There are two ryr2 genes (ryr2a and ryr2b) which are expressed exclusively in developing CNS and cardiac tissue, respectively. In addition, ryr3 and ryr2a mRNA is detectable in the initial stages of development, prior to embryonic axis formation.\nOur work reveals that zebrafish ryr genes are differentially expressed throughout the developing embryo from cleavage onwards. The data suggests that RyR-regulated Ca2+ signals are associated with several aspects of embryonic development, from organogenesis through to the differentiation of the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and nervous system.

These cells constitute a promising source of material for use in drug development, toxicity testing, and regenerative medicine.

In the present study, we used microarrays and analyzed the global transcription of hESC-derived cardiomyocyte clusters (CMCs) and determined similarities as well as differences compared with reference samples from fetal and adult heart tissue. In addition, we performed a focused analysis of the expression of cardiac ion channels and genes involved in the Ca(2+)-handling machinery, which in previous studies have been shown to be immature in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Our results show that hESC-derived CMCs, on a global level, have a highly similar gene expression profile compared with human heart tissue, and their transcriptional phenotype was more similar to fetal than to adult heart. Despite the high similarity to heart tissue, a number of significantly differentially expressed genes were identified, providing some clues toward understanding the molecular difference between in vivo sourced tissue and stem cell derivatives generated in vitro. Interestingly, some of the cardiac-related ion channels and Ca(2+)-handling genes showed differential expression between the CMCs and heart tissues.

Type 1 diabetic mellitus (T1DM) is associated with increased cardiovascular complications at an early stage of the disease. The purpose of the present study was to explore whether arjunolic acid (AA) plays any protective role against cardiovascular complications in T1DM and if so, what molecular pathways it utilizes for the mechanism of its protective action. Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce T1DM in experimental rats. Alteration in plasma lipid profile and release of membrane bound enzymes like LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and CK (creatine kinase) established the association of hyperlipidemia and cell membrane disintegration with hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia altered the levels of oxidative stress related biomarkers, decreased the intracellular NAD and ATP concentrations. Hyperglycemia-induced enhanced levels of VEGF, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 in the plasma of STZ treated animals indicate vascular inflammation in T1DM. Histological studies and FACS analysis revealed that hyperglycemia caused cell death mostly via the apoptotic pathway. Investigating molecular mechanism, we observed NF-\u03baB and MAPKs (p38 and ERK1/2) activations, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome C release, caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage in apoptotic cell death in the diabetic cardiac tissue. Treatment with AA (20\u00a0mg/kg body weight) reduced hyperglycemia, membrane disintegration, oxidative stress, vascular inflammation and prevented the activation of oxidative stress induced signaling cascades leading to cell death.

Kaempferol, one of the most common dietary flavonoids, is known to have anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties. The current study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of kaempferol against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms. Rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) treated with DOX (3 mg/kg) every other day for a cumulative dose of 9 mg/kg. After 28 days, DOX caused retarded body and heart growth, oxidative stress, apoptotic damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Bcl-2 expression disturbance. In contrast, kaempferol pretreatment (10 mg/kg i.p. before DOX administration) attenuated the DOX-induced apoptotic damage in heart tissues. In vitro studies also indicated that kaempferol may have used the mitochondrion-dependent pathway to counteract the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. This counteraction was achieved by inhibiting p53 expression and its binding to the promoter region of the Bax proapoptotic gene, but not to the Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene. Kaempferol also effectively suppressed DOX-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation, but had no effect on p38 and JNK. Therefore, kaempferol protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, at least, partially, by inhibiting the activation of p53-mediated, mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic signaling, and by being involved in an ERK-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These findings elucidated the potential of kaempferol as a promising reagent for treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and may have implications in the long-term clinical usefulness of DOX.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["JingXiao", "Gui-BoSun", "BingSun", "YingWu", "LingHe", "XinWang", "Rong-ChangChen", "LiCao", "Xiao-YuRen", "Xiao-BoSun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2011.11.018"}

Nebivolol (500 ng/kg), CL 316243 (1 \u03bcg/kg), BRL-37344 (1 \u03bcg/kg), or vehicle (VEH) was administered at the time of R. Myocardial area-at-risk (AAR) and infarct size (INF)/AAR was measured at 24 h of R. Cardiac tissue and plasma were collected to evaluate eNOS phosphorylation, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and nitrite and nitrosothiol levels.\nNebivolol (500 ng/kg) reduced INF/AAR by 37% (p < 0.001 vs. VEH) and serum troponin-I levels from 41 \u00b1 4 ng/ml to 25 \u00b1 4 ng/ml (p < 0.05 vs. VEH).

{"title": "Gold nanoparticles administration induces disarray of heart muscle, hemorrhagic, chronic inflammatory cells infiltrated by small lymphocytes, cytoplasmic vacuolization and congested and dilated blood vessels.", "abstract": "Despite significant research efforts on cancer therapy, diagnostics and imaging, many challenges remain unsolved. There are many unknown details regarding the interaction of nanoparticles (NPs) and biological systems. The structure and properties of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) make them useful for a wide array of biological applications. However, for the application of GNPs in therapy and drug delivery, knowledge regarding their bioaccumulation and associated local or systemic toxicity is necessary. Information on the biological fate of NPs, including distribution, accumulation, metabolism, and organ specific toxicity is still minimal. Studies specifically dealing with the toxicity of NPs are rare. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of intraperitoneal administration of GNPs on histological alterations of the heart tissue of rats in an attempt to identify and understand the toxicity and the potential role of GNPs as a therapeutic and diagnostic tool.\nA total of 40 healthy male Wistar-Kyoto rats received 50 \u03bcl infusions of 10, 20 and 50 nm GNPs for 3 or 7 days. Animals were randomly divided into groups: 6 GNP-treated rats groups and one control group (NG). Groups 1, 2 and 3 received infusions of 50 \u03bcl GNPs of size 10 nm (3 or 7 days), 20 nm (3 or 7 days) and 50 nm (3 or 7 days), respectively.\nIn comparison with the respective control rats, exposure to GNPs doses produced heart muscle disarray with a few scattered chronic inflammatory cells infiltrated by small lymphocytes, foci of hemorrhage with extravasation of red blood cells, some scattered cytoplasmic vacuolization and congested and dilated blood vessels. None of the above alterations were observed in the heart muscle of any member of the control group.\nThe alterations induced by intraperitoneal administration of GNPs were size-dependent, with smaller ones inducing greater affects, and were also related to the time exposure to GNPs. These alterations may indicate scattered cytoplasmic vacuolization, which may induce the toxicity effect through an inability to deal with the accumulated residues resulting from metabolic and structural disturbances caused by these NPs. These histological alterations were more prominent with 10 nm size particles than with the larger ones. The interaction of GNPs with proteins and various cell types should be considered as part of the toxicological evaluation. Additional experiments related to plasma, tissues cytokine, antioxidant defense mechanism, lipid peroxidation, histomorphologcal and ultrastructure will be performed to identify and understand the toxicity and the potential use of GNPs as therapeutic and diagnostic tools.", "journal": "Lipids in health and disease", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["Mohamed Anwar KAbdelhalim"], "doi": "10.1186/1476-511X-10-233\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.11.033\n10.1073/pnas.0406352102\n10.1289/ehp.7339\n10.1166/jnn.2004.081\n10.1002/smll.200400093\n10.1021/nl072658h\n10.1002/cbic.200300713\n10.1021/ja808033w\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00248-X\n10.1021/la0520029\n10.1002/smll.200700378\n10.1186/1477-3155-8-16\n10.1016/j.tiv.2005.06.034\n10.2174/156652406778195026\n10.1186/1476-511X-10-133\n10.1186/1476-511X-10-147\n10.1186/1476-511X-10-163\n10.1186/1476-511X-10-166\n10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.03.001\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05075.x\n10.1002/smll.200900466\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.02.046\n10.1126/science.1114397\n10.1097/00063198-200101000-00004\n10.1136/oem.58.3.211\n10.1289/ehp.7339\n10.1006/taap.2001.9240\n10.1016/j.mehy.2004.08.028\n10.1136/oem.2004.013243"}
{"title": "Inhibition of heart formation by lithium is an indirect result of the disruption of tissue organization within the embryo.", "abstract": "Lithium is a commonly used drug for the treatment of bipolar disorder. At high doses, lithium becomes teratogenic, which is a property that has allowed this agent to serve as a useful tool for dissecting molecular pathways that regulate embryogenesis. This study was designed to examine the impact of lithium on heart formation in the developing frog for insights into the molecular regulation of cardiac specification. Embryos were exposed to lithium at the beginning of gastrulation, which produced severe malformations of the anterior end of the embryo. Although previous reports characterized this deformity as a posteriorized phenotype, histological analysis revealed that the defects were more comprehensive, with disfigurement and disorganization of all interior tissues along the anterior-posterior axis. Emerging tissues were poorly segregated and cavity formation was decreased within the embryo. Lithium exposure also completely ablated formation of the heart and prevented myocardial cell differentiation. Despite the complete absence of cardiac tissue in lithium treated embryos, exposure to lithium did not prevent myocardial differentiation of precardiac dorsal marginal zone explants. Moreover, precardiac tissue freed from the embryo subsequent to lithium treatment at gastrulation gave rise to cardiac tissue, as demonstrated by upregulation of cardiac gene expression, display of sarcomeric proteins, and formation of a contractile phenotype. Together these data indicate that lithium's effect on the developing heart was not due to direct regulation of cardiac differentiation, but an indirect consequence of disrupted tissue organization within the embryo.", "journal": "Development, growth & differentiation", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["Lisa KMartin", "MomkaBratoeva", "Nadejda VMezentseva", "Jayne MBernanke", "Mathieu CRemond", "Ann FRamsdell", "Carol AEisenberg", "Leonard MEisenberg"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1440-169X.2011.01313.x"}

Recently, we have extended its use to investigate pancreatic \u03b2-cells and showed that, in the presence of MnCl(2), glucose-activated pancreatic islets yield significant signal enhancement in T(1)-weigheted MR images. In this study, we exploited for the first time the unique capabilities of X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) to both visualize and quantify the metal in pancreatic \u03b2-cells at cellular and subcellular levels. MIN-6 insulinoma cells grown in standard tissue culture conditions had only a trace amount of Mn, 1.14 \u00b1 0.03 \u00d7 10(-11)\u00b5g/\u00b5m(2), homogenously distributed across the cell. Exposure to 2 mM glucose and 50 \u00b5M MnCl(2) for 20 min resulted in nonglucose-dependent Mn uptake and the overall cell concentration increased to 8.99 \u00b1 2.69 \u00d7 10(-11) \u00b5g/\u00b5m(2). When cells were activated by incubation in 16 mM glucose in the presence of 50 \u00b5M MnCl(2), a significant increase in cytoplasmic Mn was measured, reaching 2.57 \u00b1 1.34 \u00d7 10(-10) \u00b5g/\u00b5m(2). A further rise in intracellular concentration was measured following KCl-induced depolarization, with concentrations totaling 1.25 \u00b1 0.33 \u00d7 10(-9) and 4.02 \u00b1 0.71 \u00d7 10(-10) \u00b5g/\u00b5m(2) in the cytoplasm and nuclei, respectively. In both activated conditions Mn was prevalent in the cytoplasm and localized primarily in a perinuclear region, possibly corresponding to the Golgi apparatus and involving the secretory pathway.

ALX-induced diabetes decreased body weight, increased glucose level, decreased insulin content, enhanced the levels of cardiac damage markers and altered lipid profile in the plasma. Moreover, it increased oxidative stress (decreased antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH/GSSG ratio, increased xanthine oxidase enzyme activity, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation and ROS generation) and enhanced the proinflammatory cytokines levels, activity of myeloperoxidase and nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB in the cardiac tissue of the experimental animals.

Positive inotropic effects of kisspeptin were observed in rat, human and mouse. No response was observed in mice with targeted disruption of Kiss1r. In human heart a decrease in cardiac kisspeptin level was detected in ischaemic heart disease. Kisspeptin and its receptor are expressed in the human, rat and mouse heart and kisspeptins possess potent positive inotropic activity. The cardiovascular actions of the kisspeptins may contribute to the role of these peptides in pregnancy but the consequences of receptor activation must be considered if kisspeptin receptor agonists are developed for use in the treatment of reproductive disorders or cancer.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-12-02", "authors": ["Janet JMaguire", "Helen RKirby", "Emma JMead", "Rhoda EKuc", "Xavierd'Anglemont de Tassigny", "William HColledge", "Anthony PDavenport"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0027601"}
{"title": "Dramatic increase of nitrite levels in hearts of anoxia-exposed crucian carp supporting a role in cardioprotection.", "abstract": "Nitrite (NO(2)(-)) functions as an important nitric oxide (NO) donor under hypoxic conditions. Both nitrite and NO have been found to protect the mammalian heart and other tissues against ischemia (anoxia)-reoxygenation injury by interacting with mitochondrial electron transport complexes and limiting the generation of reactive oxygen species upon reoxygenation. The crucian carp naturally survives extended periods without oxygen in an active state, which has made it a model for studying how evolution has solved the problems of anoxic survival. We investigated the role of nitrite and NO in the anoxia tolerance of this fish by measuring NO metabolites in normoxic, anoxic, and reoxygenated crucian carp. We also cloned and sequenced crucian carp NO synthase variants and quantified their mRNA levels in several tissues in normoxia and anoxia. Despite falling levels of blood plasma nitrite, the crucian carp showed massive increases in nitrite, S-nitrosothiols (SNO), and iron-nitrosyl (FeNO) compounds in anoxic heart tissue. NO(2)(-) levels were maintained in anoxic brain, liver, and gill tissues, whereas SNO and FeNO increased in a tissue-specific manner. Reoxygenation reestablished normoxic values. We conclude that NO(2)(-) is shifted into the tissues where it acts as NO donor during anoxia, inducing cytoprotection under anoxia/reoxygenation. This can be especially important in the crucian carp heart, which maintains output in anoxia. NO(2)(-) is currently tested as a therapeutic drug against reperfusion damage of ischemic hearts, and the present study provides evolutionary precedent for such an approach.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Residual Cx45 and its relationship to Cx43 in murine ventricular myocardium.", "abstract": "Gap junction channels in ventricular myocardium are required for electrical and metabolic coupling between cardiac myocytes and for normal cardiac pump function. Although much is known about expression patterns and remodeling of cardiac connexin(Cx)43, little is known about the less abundant Cx45, which is required for embryonic development and viability, is downregulated in adult hearts, and is pathophysiologically upregulated in human end-stage heart failure. We applied quantitative immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation to native myocardial extracts, immunogold electron microscopy to cardiac tissue and membrane sections, electrophysiological recordings to whole hearts, and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry to Cx45 fusion protein, and developed two new tools, anti-Cx45 antisera and Cre(+);Cx45 floxed mice, to facilitate characterization of Cx45 in adult mammalian hearts. We found that Cx45 represents 0.3% of total Cx protein (predominantly 200 fmol Cx43 protein/\u03bcg ventricular protein) and colocalizes with Cx43 in native ventricular gap junctions, particularly in the apex and septum. Cre(+);Cx45 floxed mice express 85% less Cx45, but do not exhibit overt electrophysiologic abnormalities. Although the basal phosphorylation status of native Cx45 remains unknown, CaMKII phosphorylates 8 Ser/Thr residues in Cx45 in vitro. Thus, although downregulation of Cx45 does not produce notable deficits in electrical conduction in adult, disease-free hearts, Cx45 is a target of the multifunctional kinase CaMKII, and the phosphorylation status of Cx45 and the role of Cx43/Cx45 heteromeric gap junction channels in both normal and diseased hearts merits further investigation.", "journal": "Channels (Austin, Tex.)", "date": "2011-12-01", "authors": ["MingweiBao", "Evelyn MKanter", "Richard Y-CHuang", "StephanMaxeiner", "MarinaFrank", "YanZhang", "Richard BSchuessler", "Timothy WSmith", "R ReidTownsend", "Henry WRohrs", "Viviana MBerthoud", "KlausWillecke", "James GLaing", "Kathryn AYamada"], "doi": "10.4161/chan.5.6.18523"}

In this study we describe a novel, single-detector mapping system that utilizes two excitation and one emission band for the simultaneous recording of action potentials and calcium transients in monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Cells stained with the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye X-Rhod-1 and the voltage-sensitive dye Di-4-ANEPPS were illuminated by a programmable, multicolor LED matrix. Blue and green LED pulses were flashed 180\u00b0 out of phase at a rate of 488.3 Hz using a custom-built dual bandpass excitation filter that transmitted blue (482 \u00b1 6 nm) and green (577 \u00b1 31 nm) light. A long-pass emission filter (>605 nm) and a 504-channel photodiode array were used to record combined signals from cardiomyocytes. Green excitation yielded Ca(i) transients without significant crosstalk from V(m).

It is suggested that PM smaller than 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5)) may contribute to these responses. However, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. To elucidate the changes in molecular level, we investigated the gene expression profile of concentrated ambient particles (CAPs)-exposed rats. Aged F344 rats were exposed with CAPs (594 \u03bcg/m(3)) or clean air 4 h per day for 3 days, and lung and heart tissues were then excised for DNA microarray analysis. Expression profiles related to inflammation and blood pressure regulation revealed differential expression of 7 genes in the lung and that of 3 genes in the heart ventricle. According to the complement activation-associated genes, complement factor B (Bf), complement component 2 and 4a (C4a), and C1 inhibitor genes were up-regulated in CAPs-exposed rat lung. Bf and C4a genes were also up-regulated in the heart. These suggest the treated animal ready for production of these proteins when activation of complement cascade is required. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1\u03b2, was also up-regulated in CAPs-exposed rat lung. Gene related with blood pressure regulation (angiotensin I converting enzyme) was also up-regulated in CAPs-exposed rat lung. Negative regulator of blood pressure (neuropeptide Y) was down-regulated in CAPs-exposed rat heart.

PTX3 is rapidly produced and released by several cell types in response to local inflammation of the cardiovascular system. Plasma PTX3 levels are very low in normal conditions and increase in heart failure (HF) patients with advancing NYHA functional class, but its exact role during HF pathogenetic mechanisms is not yet established. No data about PTX3 cardiac expression in normal and pathological conditions are currently available, either in human or in large-size animals. Of the latter, the pig has a central role in \"in vivo\" clinical settings but its genome has not been completely sequenced and the PTX3 gene sequence is still lacking. The aim of this study was to sequence the PTX3 in Sus scrofa, whose sequence is not yet present in GenBank. Utilizing our knowledge of this sequence, PTX3 mRNA expression was evaluated in cardiac tissue of normal (n=6) and HF pigs (n=5), obtained from the four chambers. To sequence PTX3 gene in S. scrofa, the high homology between Homo sapiens and S. scrofa was exploited. Pig PTX3 mRNA was sequenced using polymerase chain reaction primers designed from human consensus sequences. The DNA, obtained from different RT-PCR reactions, was sequenced using the Sanger method. S. scrofa PTX3 mRNA, 1-336 bp, was submitted to GenBank (ID: GQ412351). The sequence obtained from pig cardiac tissue shared an 84% sequence identity with human homolog.

Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) is a ubiquitous kinase prevalent in uterus and present in other contracting tissues including cardiac muscle. The recombinant 130 kDa (short) smMLCK phosphorylated S15 in MYL2 in vitro. Specific modification of S15 was verified using the direct detection of the phospho group on S15 with mass spectrometry. SmMLCK also specifically phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain S15 in porcine ventricular myosin and chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin (S20 in smooth muscle) but failed to phosphorylate the myosin regulatory light chain in rabbit skeletal myosin. Phosphorylation kinetics, measured using a novel fluorescence method eliminating the use of radioactive isotopes, indicates similar Michaelis-Menten V(max) and K(M) for regulatory light chain S15 phosphorylation rates in MYL2, porcine ventricular myosin, and chicken gizzard myosin. These data demonstrate that smMLCK is a specific and efficient kinase for the in vitro phosphorylation of MYL2, cardiac, and smooth muscle myosin.

{"title": "New mechanism of spiral wave initiation in a reaction-diffusion-mechanics system.", "abstract": "Spiral wave initiation in the heart muscle is a mechanism for the onset of dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. A standard protocol for spiral wave initiation is the application of a stimulus in the refractory tail of a propagating excitation wave, a region that we call the \"classical vulnerable zone.\" Previous studies of vulnerability to spiral wave initiation did not take the influence of deformation into account, which has been shown to have a substantial effect on the excitation process of cardiomyocytes via the mechano-electrical feedback phenomenon. In this work we study the effect of deformation on the vulnerability of excitable media in a discrete reaction-diffusion-mechanics (dRDM) model. The dRDM model combines FitzHugh-Nagumo type equations for cardiac excitation with a discrete mechanical description of a finite-elastic isotropic material (Seth material) to model cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and stretch activated depolarizing current. We show that deformation alters the \"classical,\" and forms a new vulnerable zone at longer coupling intervals. This mechanically caused vulnerable zone results in a new mechanism of spiral wave initiation, where unidirectional conduction block and rotation directions of the consequently initiated spiral waves are opposite compared to the mechanism of spiral wave initiation due to the \"classical vulnerable zone.\" We show that this new mechanism of spiral wave initiation can naturally occur in situations that involve wave fronts with curvature, and discuss its relation to supernormal excitability of cardiac tissue. The concept of mechanically induced vulnerability may lead to a better understanding about the onset of dangerous heart arrhythmias via mechano-electrical feedback.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-11-25", "authors": ["Louis DWeise", "Alexander VPanfilov"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0027264"}

Heart rate variability (HRV) can be used as a non-invasive marker of cardiac autonomic control and a low HRV is a predictor for SCD and arrhythmic events. Studies on HRV and omega-3 PUFA have been performed in several populations such as patients with ischemic heart disease, patients with diabetes mellitus, patients with chronic renal failure, and in healthy subjects as well as in children. The studies have demonstrated a positive association between cellular content of omega-3 PUFA and HRV and supplementation with omega-3 PUFA seems to increase HRV which could be a possible explanation for decreased risk of arrhythmic events and SCD sometimes observed after omega-3 PUFA supplementation.

{"title": "Tailoring material properties of a nanofibrous extracellular matrix derived hydrogel.", "abstract": "In the native tissue, the interaction between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, mechanical stability, and signaling. It has been shown that decellularized ECMs can be processed into injectable formulations, thereby allowing for minimally invasive delivery. Upon injection and increase in temperature, these materials self-assemble into porous gels forming a complex network of fibers with nanoscale structure. In this study we aimed to examine and tailor the material properties of a self-assembling ECM hydrogel derived from porcine myocardial tissue, which was developed as a tissue specific injectable scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering. The impact of gelation parameters on ECM hydrogels has not previously been explored. We examined how modulating pH, temperature, ionic strength, and concentration affected the nanoscale architecture, mechanical properties, and gelation kinetics. These material characteristics were assessed using scanning electron microscopy, rheometry, and spectrophotometry, respectively. Since the main component of the myocardial matrix is collagen, many similarities between the ECM hydrogel and collagen gels were observed in terms of the nanofibrous structure and modulation of properties by altering ionic strength. However, variation from collagen gels was noted for the gelation temperature along with varied times and rates of gelation. These discrepancies when compared to collagen are likely due to the presence of other ECM components in the decellularized ECM based hydrogel. These results demonstrate how the material properties of ECM hydrogels could be tailored for future in vitro and in vivo applications.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2011-11-22", "authors": ["Todd DJohnson", "Stephen YLin", "Karen LChristman"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/22/49/494015"}
{"title": "Catecholamine-induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction and mPTP opening: protective effect of curcumin.", "abstract": "The present study was designed to characterize the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by catecholamines and to investigate whether curcumin, a natural antioxidant, induces cardioprotective effects against catecholamine-induced cardiotoxicity by preserving mitochondrial function. Because mitochondria play a central role in ischemia and oxidative stress, we hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in catecholamine toxicity and in the potential protective effects of curcumin. Male Wistar rats received subcutaneous injection of 150 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) isoprenaline (ISO) for two consecutive days with or without pretreatment with 60 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) curcumin. Twenty four hours after, cardiac tissues were examined for apoptosis and oxidative stress. Expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Isolated mitochondria and permeabilized cardiac fibers were used for swelling and mitochondrial function experiments, respectively. Mitochondrial morphology and permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were assessed by fluorescence in isolated cardiomyocytes. ISO treatment induced cell damage, oxidative stress, and apoptosis that were prevented by curcumin. Moreover, mitochondria seem to play an important role in these effects as respiration and mitochondrial swelling were increased following ISO treatment, these effects being again prevented by curcumin. Importantly, curcumin completely prevented the ISO-induced increase in mPTP calcium susceptibility in isolated cardiomyocytes without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial network dynamic. The results unravel the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in isoprenaline-induced cardiotoxicity as well as a new cardioprotective effect of curcumin through prevention of mitochondrial damage and mPTP opening.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Although the mechanism is still under investigation, the possibility that this propeptide may be involved in promoting stem cell differentiation into the cardiac lineage has yet to be explored. To investigate whether IGF-1Ea promote cardiogenesis, we initially modified P19 embryonal carcinoma cells to express IGF-1Ea. Taking advantage of their cardiomyogenic nature, we analyzed whether overexpression of this propeptide affected cardiac differentiation program. The data herein presented showed for the first time that constitutively overexpressed IGF-1Ea increased cardiogenic differentiation program in both undifferentiated and DMSO-differentiated cells. In details, IGF-1Ea overexpression promoted localization of alpha-actinin in finely organized sarcomeric structure compared to control cells and upregulated the cardiac mesodermal marker NKX-2.5 and the ventricular structural protein MLC2v. Furthermore, activated IGF-1 signaling promoted cardiac mesodermal induction in undifferentiated cells independently of cell proliferation.

We hypothesized that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) applied to the heart in a collagen matrix would outperform the same cells grown in a monolayer and directly injected for cardiac cell replacement after myocardial infarction in a rat model. When hMSC patches were transplanted to infarcted hearts, several measures for left ventricle (LV) remodelling and function were improved, including fractional area change, wall thickness, -dP/dt and LV end-diastolic pressure. Neovessel formation throughout the LV infarct wall after hMSC patch treatment increased by 37% when compared to direct injection of hMSCs. This observation was correlated with increased secretion of angiogenic factors, with accompanying evidence that these factors enhanced vessel formation (30% increase) and endothelial cell growth (48% increase) in vitro. These observations may explain the in vivo observations of increased vessel formation and improved cardiac function with patch-mediated cell delivery. Although culture of hMSC in collagen patches enhanced angiogenic responses, there was no effect on cell potency or viability. Therefore, hMSCs delivered as a cardiac patch showed benefits above those derived from monolayers and directly injected. hMSCs cultured and delivered within TE constructs may represent a good option to maximize the effects of cellular cardiomyoplasty.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-11-19", "authors": ["David LSimpson", "Samuel CDudley"], "doi": "10.1002/term.511"}

Although identified in preclinical studies, the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects are often not fully characterized; potential targets include Akt signaling disruption in cardiac tissue, vascular smooth muscle, and/or autonomic system signaling. A selective Akt inhibitor was found to produce a rapid and marked hypotension and bradycardia in conscious rats. Isolated right atrial tissue and isolated thoracic aortic rings were used to examine direct effects of Akt inhibition on cardiac and vascular tissues, respectively. In addition, rats surgically prepared with telemetry units for monitoring blood pressure and heart rate were used to investigate potential effects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Whereas this Akt inhibitor did not produce any significant effect on atrial tissue, it did cause vasorelaxation of aortic rings. More significantly, in conscious rats, the Akt inhibitor inhibited the neural pressor response to the known nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP). In fact, the response observed was comparable to the response observed with the known ganglionic blocker hexamethonium. Thus, the hypotension and bradycardia produced by the Akt inhibitor is primarily due to blockade of nAchRs in autonomic ganglia.

In a preclinical model of transplantation, heart grafts after cold preservation with rCLU-containing UW solution had better functional recovery and decreased perivascular inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and cardiac cell death, including apoptosis and necrosis, that correlated with lower levels of serum creatine kinase and LDH in recipients.\nOur data suggest that supplement of CLU protein in a cold preservation solution may have potential in improving cold preservation of donor organs in transplantation.", "journal": "Surgery", "date": "2011-11-18", "authors": ["QiunongGuan", "ShuyuanLi", "GordonYip", "Martin EGleave", "Christopher Y CNguan", "CaiganDu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.surg.2011.09.032"}

Here, this last approach was further investigated. Experiments were performed in transparent gels and ex vivo bovine heart tissue using 1, 2, and 3 MHz focused transducers and different pulsing schemes in which the pressure, duty factor, and pulse duration were varied. A previously developed derating procedure to determine in situ shock amplitudes and the time-to-boil was refined. Treatments were monitored using B-mode ultrasound. Both inertial cavitation and boiling were observed during exposures, but emulsification occurred only when shocks and boiling were present. Emulsified lesions without thermal denaturation were produced with shock amplitudes sufficient to induce boiling in less than 20 ms, duty factors of less than 0.02, and pulse lengths shorter than 30 ms. Higher duty factors or longer pulses produced varying degrees of thermal denaturation combined with mechanical emulsification. Larger lesions were obtained using lower ultrasound frequencies. The results show that shock wave heating and millisecond boiling is an effective and reliable way to emulsify tissue while monitoring the treatment with ultrasound.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2011-11-18", "authors": ["Tatiana DKhokhlova", "Michael SCanney", "Vera AKhokhlova", "Oleg ASapozhnikov", "Lawrence ACrum", "Michael RBailey"], "doi": "10.1121/1.3626152\n10.1016/S0301-5629(96)00175-5\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2005.09.005\n10.1016/j.urology.2009.03.049\n10.1016/S0301-5629(98)00086-6\n10.1016/S0022-5347(05)00141-2\n10.1121/1.2735110\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2009.09.010\n10.1121/1.2967836\n10.1134/S1063771010030140\n10.1121/1.3081393\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2005.06.004\n10.1080/02656730701194131\n10.1109/TBME.2009.2028133\n10.1063/1.2956259\n10.1121/1.2161440\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.3.1.375\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.04.010\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.09.002"}
{"title": "Comparison of human cardiac gene expression profiles in paired samples of right atrium and left ventricle collected in vivo.", "abstract": "Studies of expressed genes in human heart provide insight into both physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. This is of importance for extended understanding of cardiac function as well as development of new therapeutic drugs. Heart tissue for gene expression studies is generally hard to obtain, particularly from the ventricles. Since different parts of the heart have different functions, expression profiles should likely differ between these parts. The aim of the study was therefore to compare the global gene expression in cardiac tissue from the more accessible auricula of the right atrium to expression in tissue from the left ventricle. Tissue samples were collected from five men undergoing aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting. Global gene expression analysis identified 542 genes as differentially expressed between the samples extracted from these two locations, corresponding to ~2% of the genes covered by the microarray; 416 genes were identified as abundantly expressed in right atrium, and 126 genes were abundantly expressed in left ventricle. Further analysis of the differentially expressed genes according to available annotations, information from curated pathways and known protein interactions, showed that genes with higher expression in the ventricle were mainly associated with contractile work of the heart. Transcription in biopsies from the auricula of the right atrium on the other hand indicated a wider area of functions, including immunity and defense. In conclusion, our results suggest that biopsies from the auricula of the right atrium may be suitable for various genetic studies, but not studies directly related to muscle work.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2011-11-17", "authors": ["JuliaAsp", "JaneSynnergren", "MarianneJonsson", "G\u00f6ranDellgren", "AndersJeppsson"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00137.2011"}
{"title": "Oxidation of HRas cysteine thiols by metabolic stress prevents palmitoylation in vivo and contributes to endothelial cell apoptosis.", "abstract": "Here we demonstrate a new paradigm in redox signaling, whereby oxidants resulting from metabolic stress directly alter protein palmitoylation by oxidizing reactive cysteine thiolates. In mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet and in cultured endothelial cells (ECs) treated with high palmitate and high glucose (HPHG), there was decreased HRas palmitoylation on Cys181/184 (61\u00b124% decrease for cardiac tissue and 38\u00b17.0% in ECs). This was due to oxidation of Cys181/184, detected using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF)-TOF. Decrease in HRas palmitoylation affected its compartmentalization and Ras binding domain binding activity, with a shift from plasma membrane tethering to Golgi localization. Loss of plasma membrane-bound HRas decreased growth factor-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (84\u00b18.6% decrease) and increased apoptotic signaling (24\u00b16.5-fold increase) after HPHG treatment that was prevented by overexpressing wild-type but not C181/184S HRas. The essential role of HRas in metabolic stress was made evident by the similar effects of expressing an inactive dominant negative N17-HRas or a MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, the relevance of thiol oxidation was demonstrated by overexpressing manganese superoxide dismutase, which improved HRas palmitoylation and ERK phosphorylation, while lessening apoptosis in HPHG treated ECs.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2011-11-17", "authors": ["Joseph RBurgoyne", "Dagmar JHaeussler", "VikasKumar", "YuhanJi", "David RPimental", "Rebecca SZee", "Cathrine ECostello", "ChengLin", "Mark EMcComb", "Richard ACohen", "Markus MBachschmid"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.11-189415"}
{"title": "Efficient derivation of human cardiac precursors and cardiomyocytes from pluripotent human embryonic stem cells with small molecule induction.", "abstract": "To date, the lack of a suitable human cardiac cell source has been the major setback in regenerating the human myocardium, either by cell-based transplantation or by cardiac tissue engineering. Cardiomyocytes become terminally-differentiated soon after birth and lose their ability to proliferate. There is no evidence that stem/progenitor cells derived from other sources, such as the bone marrow or the cord blood, are able to give rise to the contractile heart muscle cells following transplantation into the heart. The need to regenerate or repair the damaged heart muscle has not been met by adult stem cell therapy, either endogenous or via cell delivery. The genetically stable human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have unlimited expansion ability and unrestricted plasticity, proffering a pluripotent reservoir for in vitro derivation of large supplies of human somatic cells that are restricted to the lineage in need of repair and regeneration. Due to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease worldwide and acute shortage of donor organs, there is intense interest in developing hESC-based therapies as an alternative approach. However, how to channel the wide differentiation potential of pluripotent hESCs efficiently and predictably to a desired phenotype has been a major challenge for both developmental study and clinical translation. Conventional approaches rely on multi-lineage inclination of pluripotent cells through spontaneous germ layer differentiation, resulting in inefficient and uncontrollable lineage-commitment that is often followed by phenotypic heterogeneity and instability, hence, a high risk of tumorigenicity (see a schematic in Fig. 1A). In addition, undefined foreign/animal biological supplements and/or feeders that have typically been used for the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of hESCs may make direct use of such cell-specialized grafts in patients problematic. To overcome these obstacles, we have resolved the elements of a defined culture system necessary and sufficient for sustaining the epiblast pluripotence of hESCs, serving as a platform for de novo derivation of clinically-suitable hESCs and effectively directing such hESCs uniformly towards clinically-relevant lineages by small molecules (see a schematic in Fig. 1B). After screening a variety of small molecules and growth factors, we found that such defined conditions rendered nicotinamide (NAM) sufficient to induce the specification of cardiomesoderm direct from pluripotent hESCs that further progressed to cardioblasts that generated human beating cardiomyocytes with high efficiency (Fig. 2). We defined conditions for induction of cardioblasts direct from pluripotent hESCs without an intervening multi-lineage embryoid body stage, enabling well-controlled efficient derivation of a large supply of human cardiac cells across the spectrum of developmental stages for cell-based therapeutics.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2011-11-16", "authors": ["Xuejun HParsons", "Yang DTeng", "James FParsons", "Evan YSnyder", "David BSmotrich", "Dennis AMoore"], "doi": "10.3791/3274"}

Rapid pacing was applied at multiple sites, with action potential propagation optically mapped. Excitation either failed at the stimulus site or conduction block developed remotely, often initiating reentry. The incidence of conduction block in isotropic monolayers (0% of cultures) increased with the inclusion of realistic tissue boundaries (17%) and further with realistic fibre directions (34%). Conduction block incidence was stimulus site-dependent and highest (77%) with rapid pacing from the right ventricular (RV) free wall. Furthermore, conduction block occurred exclusively at the insertion of the RV free wall into the septum, where structure-mediated current source-load mismatches acutely reduced wavefront and waveback velocity. Tissue boundaries and sharp gradients in fibre direction uniquely determined the evolution, shape, and position of conduction block lines.\nOur study suggests that specific micro- and macrostructural features of the ventricle determine the incidence and spatiotemporal characteristics of conduction block, independent of spatial heterogeneities in ion channel expression.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2011-11-11", "authors": ["NimaBadie", "James AScull", "Rebecca YKlinger", "AvaKrol", "NenadBursac"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvr304"}

Both Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed enhancement of Rho-kinase and activator protein 1 activity and reduction of c-FLIP(L) expression in the T(4) group, and this response was inhibited by fasudil in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, fasudil inhibited apoptosis induced by T(4) as evidenced by the detection of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells and the expressions of bax and bcl-2.

Five of 18 pigs shot with 65-mm plastic projectiles (99-133 m/s; 284-513 J) to the front or side of the thorax died directly after the shot. No major physiologic changes could be observed in surviving animals. Animals shot with an oblique heart shot (99-106 m/s; 284-326 J) demonstrated a small, but significant decrease in saturation.

However, the rodent model has limitations when used for comparison to higher organisms such as humans. The rabbit model, on the other hand, has gained recognition as a useful model for studying anthrax infection and its pathophysiological effects. In this study, we assessed the hemodynamic effects of lethal toxin (LeTx) and edema toxin (EdTx) in the rabbit model using physiologically relevant amounts of the toxins. Moreover, we further examine the pathological effects of LeTx on cardiac tissue. We intravenously injected Dutch-belted rabbits with either low-dose and high-dose recombinant LeTx or a single dose of EdTx. The animals' heart rate and mean arterial pressure were continuously monitored via telemetry until either 48 or 72 h post-challenge. Additional animals challenged with LeTx were used for cardiac troponin I (cTnI) quantitation, cardiac histopathology, and echocardiography. LeTx depressed heart rate at the lower dose and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at the higher dose. EdTx, on the other hand, temporarily intensified heart rate while lowering MAP. Both doses of LeTx caused cardiac pathology with the higher dose having a more profound effect. Lastly, left-ventricular dilation due to LeTx was not apparent at the given time-points. Our study demonstrates the hemodynamic effects of anthrax toxins, as well as the pathological effects of LeTx on the heart in the rabbit model, and it provides further evidence for the toxins' direct impact on the heart.", "journal": "Toxins", "date": "2011-11-10", "authors": ["William SLawrence", "Jeffrey RMarshall", "Diana LZavala", "Lori EWeaver", "Wallace BBaze", "Scott TMoen", "Elbert BWhorton", "Randy LGourley", "Johnny WPeterson"], "doi": "10.3390/toxins3060721\n10.3201/eid0706.010604\n10.1016/S0041-0101(01)00161-1\n10.1016/S1286-4579(99)80004-5\n10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00227-9\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61218-7\n10.1086/510856\n10.1128/CVI.00023-06"}

We have reported abnormal activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) signalling in hearts from Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice, which develop dilated cardiomyopathy. We therefore determined whether an inhibitor of ERK1/2 signalling that has been investigated in clinical trials for cancer has the potential to be translated to humans with LMNA cardiomyopathy.\nTo evaluate the relevance of this finding in mice to patients, we analysed the ERK1/2 signalling in heart tissue from human subjects with LMNA cardiomyopathy and showed that it was abnormally activated. To determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway could potentially be used to treat LMNA cardiomyopathy, we administered selumetinib to male Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice starting at 16 weeks of age, after they show signs of cardiac deterioration, up to 20 weeks of age. Selumetinib is an inhibitor of ERK1/2 signalling and has been given safely to human subjects in clinical trials for cancer. Systemic treatment with selumetinib inhibited cardiac ERK1/2 phosphorylation and blocked increased expression of RNAs encoding natriuretic peptide precursors and proteins involved in sarcomere architecture that occurred in placebo-treated mice. Echocardiography and histological analysis demonstrated that treatment increases cardiac fractional shortening, prevents myocardial fibrosis, and prolongs survival.

Characterizing the proton modulation of the cardiac Na(V) channel, Na(V)1.5, will thus help define its contribution to ischemic arrhythmogenesis, where extracellular pH drops from pH 7.4 to as low as pH 6.0 within ~10 min of its onset. We expressed the human variant of Na(V)1.5 with and without the modulating \u03b2(1) subunit in Xenopus oocytes. Lowering extracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.0 affected a range of biophysical gating properties heretofore unreported. Specifically, acidic pH destabilized the fast-inactivated and slow-inactivated states, and elevated persistent I(Na).

We have shown that CST directly influences the basal performance of the vertebrate heart where CST dose dependently induced a nitric oxide-cGMP-dependent cardiosuppression and counteracted the effects of adrenergic stimulation through a noncompetitive antagonism. Here, we sought to determine the specific intracardiac signaling activated by CST in the rat heart. Physiological analyses performed on isolated, Langendorff-perfused cardiac preparations revealed that CST-induced negative inotropism and lusitropism involve \u03b2(2)/\u03b2(3)-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2(2)/\u03b2(3)-AR), showing a higher affinity for \u03b2(2)-AR. Interaction with \u03b2(2)-AR activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), increased cGMP levels, and induced activation of phosphodiesterases type 2 (PDE2), which was found to be involved in the antiadrenergic action of CST as evidenced by the decreased cAMP levels. CST-dependent negative cardiomodulation was abolished by functional denudation of the endothelium with Triton. CST also increased the eNOS expression in cardiac tissue and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. cells, confirming the involvement of the vascular endothelium. In ventricular extracts, CST increased S-nitrosylation of both phospholamban and \u03b2-arrestin, suggesting an additional mechanism for intracellular calcium modulation and \u03b2-adrenergic responsiveness.

We studied newborn (2 to 4 days old) and adult (>8 weeks old) rabbit hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (30 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion). Our data demonstrated chamber- and age-specific changes in oxidative stress. During ischemia, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) increased in both right-ventricular (RV) and left-ventricular (LV) myocytes of the newborn, although only the RV change was significant. In contrast, there was no significant increase in H(2)O(2) in either RV or LV myocytes of adults. There was a fivefold increase in H(2)O(2) formation in newborn RV myocytes compared with adults (P = 0.006). In whole-heart tissue, superoxide dismutase activity increased from sham versus ischemia in the left ventricle of both adult and newborn hearts, but it was increased only in the right ventricle of the newborn heart. Catalase activity was significantly increased after ischemia in both adult ventricles, whereas no increase was seen in newborn compared with sham hearts. In addition, catalase levels in newborns were significantly lower, indicating less scavenging potential.

We investigated p53-mediated expansion of ischemic damage with a focus on mitochondrial integrity in association with autophagy and apoptosis. p53(-/-) heart showed that autophagic flux was promoted under ischemia without a change in cardiac tissue ATP content. Electron micrographs revealed that ischemic border zone in p53(-/-) mice had 5-fold greater numbers of autophagic vacuoles containing mitochondria, indicating the occurrence of mitophagy, with an apparent reduction of abnormal mitochondria compared with those in WT mice. Analysis of autophagic mediators acting downstream of p53 revealed that TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) was exclusively up-regulated in ischemic myocardium. TIGAR(-/-) mice exhibited the promotion of mitophagy followed by decrease of abnormal mitochondria and resistance to ischemic injury, consistent with the phenotype of p53(-/-) mice. In p53(-/-) and TIGAR(-/-) ischemic myocardium, ROS production was elevated and followed by Bnip3 activation which is an initiator of mitophagy. Furthermore, the activation of Bnip3 and mitophagy due to p53/TIGAR inhibition were reversed with antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, indicating that this adaptive response requires ROS signal. Inhibition of mitophagy using chloroquine in p53(-/-) or TIGAR(-/-) mice exacerbated accumulation of damaged mitochondria to the level of wild-type mice and attenuated cardioprotective action.

The localization of distinct types of the tissue was preliminary marked by the pathologist and approved histologically after the spectral measurements. Variations in intensity, as well as in shape, were detected in autofluorescence spectra of different heart tissues. The most distinct differences were observed between the heart conduction system and the surrounding tissues under 330 and 380 nm excitation. The spectral region around 460 nm appeared to be the most suitable for an unambiguous differentiation of the human conduction system avoiding the absorption peak of blood. The visualization method, based on the intensity ratios calculated for two excitation wavelengths, was also demonstrated.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "date": "2011-10-28", "authors": ["JonasVenius", "SauliusBagdonas", "EdvardasZurauskas", "RicardasRotomskis"], "doi": "10.1117/1.3631786"}

However, high content experimental platforms are lacking that allow the function of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes to be studied under relatively physiological and standardized conditions. Here we describe a simple and robust protocol for the generation of fibrin-based human engineered heart tissue (hEHT) in a 24-well format using an unselected population of differentiated human embryonic stem cells containing 30-40% \u03b1-actinin-positive cardiac myocytes. Human EHTs started to show coherent contractions 5-10 days after casting, reached regular (mean 0.5 Hz) and strong (mean 100 \u00b5N) contractions for up to 8 weeks. They displayed a dense network of longitudinally oriented, interconnected and cross-striated cardiomyocytes. Spontaneous hEHT contractions were analyzed by automated video-optical recording and showed chronotropic responses to calcium and the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline. The proarrhythmic compounds E-4031, quinidine, procainamide, cisapride, and sertindole exerted robust, concentration-dependent and reversible decreases in relaxation velocity and irregular beating at concentrations that recapitulate findings in hERG channel assays.

{"title": "Preventing Staphylococcus aureus sepsis through the inhibition of its agglutination in blood.", "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus infection is a frequent cause of sepsis in humans, a disease associated with high mortality and without specific intervention. When suspended in human or animal plasma, staphylococci are known to agglutinate, however the bacterial factors responsible for agglutination and their possible contribution to disease pathogenesis have not yet been revealed. Using a mouse model for S. aureus sepsis, we report here that staphylococcal agglutination in blood was associated with a lethal outcome of this disease. Three secreted products of staphylococci--coagulase (Coa), von Willebrand factor binding protein (vWbp) and clumping factor (ClfA)--were required for agglutination. Coa and vWbp activate prothrombin to cleave fibrinogen, whereas ClfA allowed staphylococci to associate with the resulting fibrin cables. All three virulence genes promoted the formation of thromboembolic lesions in heart tissues. S. aureus agglutination could be disrupted and the lethal outcome of sepsis could be prevented by combining dabigatran-etexilate treatment, which blocked Coa and vWbp activity, with antibodies specific for ClfA. Together these results suggest that the combined administration of direct thrombin inhibitors and ClfA-antibodies that block S. aureus agglutination with fibrin may be useful for the prevention of staphylococcal sepsis in humans.", "journal": "PLoS pathogens", "date": "2011-10-27", "authors": ["MollyMcAdow", "Hwan KeunKim", "Andrea CDedent", "Antoni P AHendrickx", "OlafSchneewind", "Dominique MMissiakas"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1002307"}
{"title": "Deubiquitylating enzyme USP2 counteracts Nedd4-2-mediated downregulation of KCNQ1 potassium channels.", "abstract": "KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), together with its KCNE \u03b2 subunits, plays a pivotal role both in the repolarization of cardiac tissue and in water and salt transport across epithelial membranes. Nedd4/Nedd4-like (neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4) ubiquitin-protein ligases interact with the KCNQ1 potassium channel through a PY motif located in the C terminus of KCNQ1. This interaction induces ubiquitylation of KCNQ1, resulting in a reduced surface density of the channel. It was reported recently that the epithelial sodium channel is regulated by the reverse process-deubiquitylation-mediated by USP2 (ubiquitin-specific protease 2).\nIn this article, we investigated whether deubiquitylation may regulate KCNQ1 channel complexes.\nIn this study, we used electrophysiology, biochemistry, and confocal microscopy.\nElectrophysiological investigations of KCNQ1/KCNE1 proteins coexpressed with USP2-45 or USP2-69 isoforms and Nedd4-2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and mammalian cells revealed that both USP2 isoforms counter the Nedd4-2-specific downregulation of I(Ks). Biochemical studies showed that the total and surface-expressed KCNQ1 protein was more abundant when coexpressed with USP2 and Nedd4-2 as compared with Nedd4-2 alone. Western blotting revealed partial protection against covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties on KCNQ1 when USP2 was coexpressed with Nedd4-2. Coimmunoprecipitation assays suggested that USP2 can bind to KCNQ1 independently of the PY motif. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that USP2 restores the membrane localization of KCNQ1.\nThese results demonstrate that USP2 can be a potent regulator of KCNQ1 surface density. USP2, which is well expressed in many tissues, may therefore be important in controlling the KCNQ1 channel dynamics in vivo.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["KatarzynaKrzystanek", "Hanne BorgerRasmussen", "MortenGrunnet", "OlivierStaub", "S\u00f8ren-PeterOlesen", "HuguesAbriel", "ThomasJespersen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.10.026"}
{"title": "The effect of short-term hypoxic exposure on metabolic gene expression.", "abstract": "The long-term effect of hypoxia is to decrease both the production and use of ATP and thus decrease the reliance on mitochondrial oxidative energy production. Yet, recent studies include more immediate affects of hypoxia on gene expression and these data suggest the maintenance of mitochondrial function. To better understand the short-term physiological response to hypoxia, we quantified metabolic mRNA expression in the heart ventricles and livers of the teleost fish Fundulus grandis exposed to partial oxygen pressure of 2.8\u2009kPa (-13.5% air saturation).Twenty-eight individuals from a single population were exposed to hypoxia for 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 96\u2009 hr. Liver and cardiac tissues were sampled from the same individuals at 0-48 \u2009hr. At 96\u2009 hr, only cardiac tissue was assayed. Gene expression was significantly different (ANOVA, P < 0.05) for 17 of 226 metabolic genes (7.5%) in cardiac tissue and for 20 of 256 (7.8%) metabolic genes in hepatic tissue. For the two tissues examined in this study, the maximum response occurred at different times. For cardiac tissue, using Dunnett's post hoc test, most of these significant differences occurred at 96 \u2009hr of exposure. For liver, all but one significant difference occurred at 4 \u2009hr. Surprisingly, too many (relative to random expectations) of the genes with significant increase in mRNA are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway: 44% of the significant genes at 96 \u2009hr in the heart and 33% of the significant genes at 4 \u2009hr in the liver are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. These data indicate that there are tissue-specific differences in the timing of the response to hypoxia, yet both cardiac and hepatic tissues have increases in mRNA that code for enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. If these changes in mRNA produce a similar change in protein, then these data suggest that the initial response to hypoxia involves an increase in the oxidative pathway potentially as a mechanism to maintain ATP production.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

In comparison with control rats fed a standard corn starch diet (group C), the experimental group (group E) was fed a diet with an increased content of cholesterol and fructose (to 1% and 66% of the diet, respectively), as well as with oxidized soybean oil. Rats from the other two experimental groups were administered the same diet as group E during the first 2 wk of feeding, whereas at the beginning of the last 2 wk, the diet was enriched with rutin (group ER) or the CQA-rich ethanol extract from chicory seeds (9.6% of CQA, group EC), so the amount of added phenolics was equal in both dietary groups (0.15%).\nThe diet administered in group E caused hyperglycemia and increased blood serum atherogenicity in rats, but did not induce other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., dyslipidemia and oxidative stress. Additionally, it affected gut physiology through increasing mucosal sucrase activity and disturbing fermentative processes in the cecum, such as the production of short-chain fatty acids and the activity of microbial enzymes. Similarly to rutin, the dietary addition of the chicory seed extract improved glycemia, which was comparable to that determined in group C. In addition, the extract was found to decrease the atherogenic index to the level observed in group C and to increase blood antioxidant status. Both dietary supplements reduced the content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in kidney and heart tissue when compared with group E.\nThe potential efficacy of the CQA-rich extract from chicory seeds in improving diet-induced metabolic disturbances proved to be better than that of rutin; thus, the extract might be considered as a dietary supplement for carrying out clinical trials.", "journal": "Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)", "date": "2011-10-22", "authors": ["AdamJurgo\u0144ski", "JerzyJu\u015bkiewicz", "ZenonZdu\u0144czyk", "Bogus\u0142awKr\u00f3l"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nut.2011.06.010"}

The successful use of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes in cardiac tissue engineering requires an understanding of the important scaffold properties and culture conditions to promote cell attachment, differentiation, organization, and contractile function. The goal of this work was to investigate how scaffold architecture and coculture with fibroblasts influences the differentiated phenotype of murine ESC-derived cardiomyocytes (mESCDCs). Electrospinning was used to process an elastomeric biodegradable polyurethane (PU) into aligned or unaligned fibrous scaffolds. Bioreactor produced mESCDCs were seeded onto the PU scaffolds either on their own or after pre-seeding the scaffolds with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Viable mESCDCs attached to the PU scaffolds and were functionally contractile in all conditions tested. Importantly, the aligned scaffolds led to the anisotropic organization of rod-shaped cells, improved sarcomere organization, and increased mESCDC aspect ratio (length-to-diameter ratio) when compared to cells on the unaligned scaffolds. In addition, pre-seeding the scaffolds with MEFs improved mESCDC sarcomere formation compared to mESCDCs cultured alone. These results suggest that both fiber alignment and pre-treatment of scaffolds with fibroblasts improve the differentiation of mESCDCs and are important parameters for developing engineered myocardial tissue constructs using ESC-derived cardiac cells.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2011-10-19", "authors": ["Ian CParrag", "Peter WZandstra", "Kimberly AWoodhouse"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.23353"}
{"title": "Microanalytical isotope ratio measurements and elemental mapping using laser ablation ICP-MS for tissue thin sections: zinc tracer studies in rats.", "abstract": "The kinetics of zinc absorption, metabolism and excretion is extensively studied by nutritionists. Stable isotopes of zinc can be used to identify body zinc compartments that have different turnover kinetics. Since the compartments might belong to physiological subsections of different organs, there is a need for microsampling analysis to determine isotope ratios of the trace element zinc in tissue samples. Here, we study the feasibility to use laser ablation coupled to quadrupole ICP-MS for the determination of zinc tracers given to rats at different time points with the aim to generate isotope ratio bioimages of heart tissue. A double tracer ((70)Zn and (67)Zn) experiment with rats was designed to label the exchangeable zinc pool as well as the stable zinc pool. The isotope ratios determined by laser ablation ICP-MS were evaluated by additional measurements of tissue digests. Accumulated tracers which made up more than 0.1% of total zinc could be identified in the tissues of the treated rats. It was established that at least 50 measurements from the microsampling were necessary to distinguish between controls and a tracer treated rat resulting in reduced resolution of the bioimage. With the parameters used, features in the tissue thin sections of at least 250 \u03bcm(2) in size are necessary to detect the incorporation of a tracer. When different time points have to be measured, higher precisions are required and therefore a larger area needs to be ablated (1 mm(2)). Using the bioimages and pool measurements from one physiological feature, it was possible to show that the aorta cell walls incorporate the zinc tracer at the different time points.", "journal": "Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry", "date": "2011-10-19", "authors": ["Dagmar SUrgast", "OuOu", "Margaret-JaneGordon", "AndreaRaab", "Graeme FNixon", "In-SookKwun", "John HBeattie", "J\u00f6rgFeldmann"], "doi": "10.1007/s00216-011-5461-x"}

After we found the high expression of interleukin-1 receptor I (IL-1RI) gene in mice cardiac tissues with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, we assumed interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling might mediate acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In this report, Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with different dosage of DOX followed by different days of study. We found both IL-1\u03b2 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) concentrations in serum were highly induced after DOX treatment, associated with increased IL-1RI expression in cardiac tissues. Furthermore, IL-1 signaling was found to express higher with the increased dosage of DOX treatment. Histology score of cardiac tissues showed obvious cardiac damage after DOX treatment, while assessment with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient showed that histology score was closely correlated with IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1Ra concentrations in serum and IL-1RI expression in cardiac tissue.

To find new compounds which can improve the efficiency of directed differentiation of ESCs to cardiomyocytes, we screened several thousand chemical compounds and identified a promising group. All of the compounds found have a common structure of 1H-pyrrole,2,2'-(phenylmethylene)bis. Here we report the potential mechanism of action for 31002 which showed the strongest activity among the compounds selected. In the presence of 31002, 15 times more cardiomyocytes differentiated from ESCs, i.e., 3.5% to 52% of total differentiated cells. Moreover, the cardiomyocytes showed functional characteristics including rhythmic beating and marker gene expression. 31002 inhibited the down-regulation of genes related to the three germ layers in the late stage of ESCs differentiation, implying that 31002 supports a continuous fate commitment of undifferentiated ESCs to the cardiac lineage by prolonging the three germ layer stages.

Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3\u00a0months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-\u03b3 immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-\u03b21), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-\u03b3 protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-\u03b3 mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

{"title": "\"Autophagic flux\" in normal mouse tissues: focus on endogenous LC3A processing.", "abstract": "Autophagy is a major intracellular pathway for the degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins, mature ribosomes and even entire organelles. The best studied autophagic marker is the LC3B and it is believed that only the amount of the LC3B-II correlates with the amount of the autophagic membranes. Whether the LC3A processing, aside to LC3B, is a valuable endogenous 'autophagic flux' marker is far less clear. The specificity of rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the LC3A and the LC3B was tested against the commercial available human recombinant proteins LC3A and LC3B. In order to measure 'autophagic flux' in mouse liver, lung, kidney and heart we used: (1) a lysosomotropic reagent chloroquine, which inhibit the intra-lysosomal acidification or their fusion with autophagosome, (2) nutrient starvation as an autophagic stimulus and (3) ionizing radiation, which is known to destabilize lysosomes. According to the immunoblotting work the LC3A protein follows discrete patterns of LC3A-I and LC3A-II changes in liver, lung, kidney and heart tissues of mice, whereas the LC3B protein didn't follow the same pattern under stressor conditions. We conclude that the endogenous LC3A processing is a major marker of autophagy flux in mouse model. Fractionated samples (soluble vs. membrane fractions) should be used in immunoblotting to allow discrimination between the LC3-I soluble and the LC3-II membrane protein and kinetics.

The most clinically promising approach to regeneration of cardiac muscle currently under investigation is that of injecting cardiogenic repair cells or implanting a preformed tissue-engineered patch. While major advances are being made in the derivation of functional human cardiomyocytes and the development of tissue-engineering modalities for cardiac repair, the host environment into which the repair cells are placed is largely overlooked. Within seconds of myocardial ischemia, hypoxia sets in in the myocardium and the inflammatory response starts, characterized by rapid deployment of circulating cells and the release of paracrine and autocrine signals. Therefore, the inflammatory conditions under which these interactions take place, the design of the scaffold material used, and the maturity of the implanted cells will determine the outcomes of any stem cell-based therapy.

However, their existence in vivo has been debated and molecular mechanisms that regulate specification of different cardiovascular lineages are poorly understood. An ETS domain transcription factor Etv2/Etsrp/ER71 has been recently established as a crucial regulator of vascular endothelial differentiation in zebrafish and mouse embryos. In this study, we show that etsrp-expressing vascular endothelial/endocardial progenitors differentiate as cardiomyocytes in the absence of Etsrp function during zebrafish embryonic development. Expression of multiple endocardial specific markers is absent or greatly reduced in Etsrp knockdown or mutant embryos. We show that Etsrp regulates endocardial differentiation by directly inducing endocardial nfatc1 expression. In addition, Etsrp function is required to inhibit myocardial differentiation. In the absence of Etsrp function, etsrp-expressing endothelial and endocardial progenitors initiate myocardial marker hand2 and cmlc2 expression. Furthermore, Foxc1a function and interaction between Foxc1a and Etsrp is required to initiate endocardial development, but is dispensable for the inhibition of myocardial differentiation. These results argue that Etsrp initiates endothelial and endocardial, and inhibits myocardial, differentiation by two distinct mechanisms.

The present study investigated whether gene deletion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 influences cardiac inflammation and function in murine coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis.\nMatrix metalloproteinase-2 knockout mice (MMP-2(-/-)) and their wild-type controls (WT) were infected with CVB3 to induce myocarditis. Three days after infection, an increased invasion of CD4(+)-activated T cells into the myocardium was documented, followed by an excess of inflammatory cells 7 days after infection, which was significantly higher in the MMP-2(-/-)animals compared with the WT animals. Moreover, cardiac apoptosis, remodeling, viral load, and function were deteriorated in MMP-2(-/-) animals after CVB3 infection. This overwhelming inflammation was followed by 100% mortality after 15 days. This was associated with increased levels of MCP-3 in the cardiac tissue of MMP-2(-/-) mice. Because MMP-2 cleaves the chemokine MCP-3, the loss of this cleavage lead to an overreaction of the immune system with pronounced myocardial damage mediated by the inflammatory cells. When a neutralizing antibody against MCP-3 was given to MMP-2(-/-) mice, this exaggerated reaction of the immune system could be normalized to levels similar to WT-CVB3 animals.\nLoss of MMP-2 increased the inflammatory response after CVB3 infection, which impaired cardiac function and survival during CVB3-induced myocarditis.

We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-expressing cells were strongly increased by the parasite in BALB/c neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte cultures. Using a dominant-negative system, we showed that TLR2 mediated cardiomyocyte survival and the secretion of interleukin (IL) 6, which acted as an essential anti-apoptotic factor.

The ideal material for cardiac tissue repair should be haemostatic and resistant to tearing and calcification, and possibly one that will not induce an inflammatory cascade. In the last 25 months, we used an extracellular matrix for cardiac and vascular tissue repair. The patch is advocated to induce the patient's own tissue regeneration. The early results are encouraging, but a longer follow-up is needed to understand the real potential of this material.", "journal": "Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery", "date": "2011-10-08", "authors": ["AndreaQuarti", "StefaniaNardone", "MassimoColaneri", "GaetanoSantoro", "MarcoPozzi"], "doi": "10.1510/icvts.2011.280016"}
{"title": "Peripheral SMN restoration is essential for long-term rescue of a severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse model.", "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease and the leading genetic cause of infant mortality; it results from loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Humans have a paralogue, SMN2, whose exon 7 is predominantly skipped, but the limited amount of functional, full-length SMN protein expressed from SMN2 cannot fully compensate for a lack of SMN1. SMN is important for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, but downstream splicing targets involved in pathogenesis remain elusive. There is no effective SMA treatment, but SMN restoration in spinal cord motor neurons is thought to be necessary and sufficient. Non-central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including cardiovascular defects, were recently reported in severe SMA mouse models and patients, reflecting autonomic dysfunction or direct effects in cardiac tissues. Here we compared systemic versus CNS restoration of SMN in a severe mouse model. We used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), ASO-10-27, that effectively corrects SMN2 splicing and restores SMN expression in motor neurons after intracerebroventricular injection. Systemic administration of ASO-10-27 to neonates robustly rescued severe SMA mice, much more effectively than intracerebroventricular administration; subcutaneous injections extended the median lifespan by 25 fold. Furthermore, neonatal SMA mice had decreased hepatic Igfals expression, leading to a pronounced reduction in circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and ASO-10-27 treatment restored IGF1 to normal levels. These results suggest that the liver is important in SMA pathogenesis, underscoring the importance of SMN in peripheral tissues, and demonstrate the efficacy of a promising drug candidate.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2011-10-08", "authors": ["YiminHua", "KentaroSahashi", "FrankRigo", "GeneHung", "GuyHorev", "C FrankBennett", "Adrian RKrainer"], "doi": "10.1038/nature10485"}
{"title": "Postnatal overfeeding in rats leads to moderate overweight and to cardiometabolic and oxidative alterations in adulthood.", "abstract": "In contrast to the masses of data on obesity, few data are available concerning the cardiometabolic and oxidative consequences of moderate overweight. The model of postnatal overfeeding (OF) induces an increase in body weight at weaning that remains during adult life. Litters of Wistar rats were either maintained at 12 pups (normal-fed group, NF), or reduced to 3 pups at birth in order to induce OF. At 6 months of age, metabolic parameters, circulating oxidative stress and aortic and coronary vasoreactivity were assessed. Cardiac susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury was also evaluated ex vivo as were markers of cardiac remodeling. OF led to an increase in body weight at weaning (+50%); the increase in body weight persisted throughout adult life, but was less marked (+10%). Significant increases in plasma levels of fasting glucose, insulin and leptin were found in OF rats. An increase in both plasma hydroperoxides and cardiac superoxide dismutase activity and a decrease in plasma ascorbate were found in OF rats. Vasoreactivity was not modified, but ex vivo, after 30 min of ischemia, isolated hearts from OF rats showed lower recovery of coronary flow along with a greater release of LDH. Studies on heart tissues showed an increase in collagen content and increased expression and activity of MMP-2. Our findings show that moderate overweight in adult rats, induced by postnatal overfeeding, leads to both metabolic and oxidative disturbances as well as a higher susceptibility to cardiac injury after ischemia ex vivo, which may be explained, at least in part, by ventricular remodeling.", "journal": "Biochimie", "date": "2011-10-08", "authors": ["AhmedHabbout", "StephanieDelemasure", "Fran\u00e7oiseGoirand", "Jean-ClaudeGuilland", "FranckChabod", "MouradSediki", "LucRochette", "CatherineVergely"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biochi.2011.09.023"}

In human end-stage heart failure, BK-2Rs are significantly downregulated by mechanisms that have remained elusive. Heart tissues from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC; n = 7), coronary heart disease (CHD; n = 6), and normal patients (n = 6) were analyzed by RT-PCR, SSCP, and Western blotting. In normal and IDC hearts, BK-2R expression increased with age, with a lower relative increase in IDC hearts. BK-2R mRNA and protein levels showed a positive linear correlation, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Two known BK-2R promoter polymorphisms, -58T/C and -9/+9, were found to be present in the study population. The allelic frequencies for the C-allele in -58T/C were 0.58 in normal and CHD hearts and 0.81 in IDC hearts. Furthermore, the allelic frequencies for the -9 and +9 alleles were 0.42 and 0.58 in normal hearts and 0.64 and 0.36 in IDC hearts, respectively. All analyzed CHD hearts were homozygous for the -9 allele. Thus, the expression of cardioprotective BK-2Rs in human hearts is increased with age in normal and IDC hearts and may be regulated on the transcriptional level. Moreover, comparison of normal subjects and patients with failing hearts revealed different allelic frequencies in each of two known BK-2R gene polymorphisms.", "journal": "International journal of vascular medicine", "date": "2011-10-07", "authors": ["InkaLiesmaa", "NaotakaShiota", "Jorma OKokkonen", "Petri TKovanen", "Ken ALindstedt"], "doi": "10.1155/2012/159646"}
{"title": "Cardiac insulin resistance and microRNA modulators.", "abstract": "Cardiac insulin resistance is a metabolic and functional disorder that is often associated with obesity and/or the cardiorenal metabolic syndrome (CRS), and this disorder may be accentuated by chronic alcohol consumption. In conditions of over-nutrition, increased insulin (INS) and angiotensin II (Ang II) activate mammalian target for rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) signaling, whereas chronic alcohol consumption inhibits mTOR/S6K1 activation in cardiac tissue. Although excessive activation of mTOR/S6K1 induces cardiac INS resistance via serine phosphorylation of INS receptor substrates (IRS-1/2), it also renders cardioprotection via increased Ang II receptor 2 (AT2R) upregulation and adaptive hypertrophy. In the INS-resistant and hyperinsulinemic Zucker obese (ZO) rat, a rodent model for CRS, activation of mTOR/S6K1signaling in cardiac tissue is regulated by protective feed-back mechanisms involving mTOR\u2194AT2R signaling loop and profile changes of microRNA that target S6K1. Such regulation may play a role in attenuating progressive heart failure. Conversely, alcohol-mediated inhibition of mTOR/S6K1, down-regulation of INS receptor and growth-inhibitory mir-200 family, and upregulation of mir-212 that promotes fetal gene program may exacerbate CRS-related cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Experimental diabetes research", "date": "2011-10-07", "authors": ["LakshmiPulakat", "Annayya RAroor", "RukhsanaGul", "James RSowers"], "doi": "10.1155/2012/654904"}

Viability and functionality were proven by viability staining, enzyme activity tests, intracellular potential recordings, and force measurements. Precision-cut slices showed high viability throughout 28 days in culture and displayed typical cardiomyocyte action potential characteristics, which enabled pharmacological safety testing on the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kr)) and ATP-dependent potassium channels throughout the whole culture period. Constant expression of major ion channels was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Acute slices developed excitation-dependent contractions with a clear preload dependency and a \u03b2-adrenergic response. Contractility and myosin light chain expression decreased during the first days in culture but reached a steady state with reactivity upon \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation being preserved.\nOrganotypic heart slices represent a multicellular model of the human myocardium and a novel platform for studies ranging from the investigation of molecular interactions to tissue engineering.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2011-10-06", "authors": ["MatthiasBrandenburger", "JanWenzel", "RomanBogdan", "DoreenRichardt", "FilomainNguemo", "MichaelReppel", "J\u00fcrgenHescheler", "HeinrichTerlau", "AndreasDendorfer"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvr259"}

{"title": "Encapsulation of cardiomyocytes in a fibrin hydrogel for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Culturing cells in a three dimensional hydrogel environment is an important technique for developing constructs for tissue engineering as well as studying cellular responses under various culture conditions in vitro. The three dimensional environment more closely mimics what the cells observe in vivo due to the application of mechanical and chemical stimuli in all dimensions (1). Three-dimensional hydrogels can either be made from synthetic polymers such as PEG-DA (2) and PLGA (3) or a number of naturally occurring proteins such as collagen (4), hyaluronic acid (5) or fibrin (6,7). Hydrogels created from fibrin, a naturally occurring blood clotting protein, can polymerize to form a mesh that is part of the body's natural wound healing processes (8). Fibrin is cell-degradable and potentially autologous (9), making it an ideal temporary scaffold for tissue engineering. Here we describe in detail the isolation of neonatal cardiomyocytes from three day old rat pups and the preparation of the cells for encapsulation in fibrin hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering. Neonatal myocytes are a common cell source used for in vitro studies in cardiac tissue formation and engineering (4). Fibrin gel is created by mixing fibrinogen with the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptides FpA and FpB from fibrinogen, revealing binding sites that interact with other monomers (10). These interactions cause the monomers to self-assemble into fibers that form the hydrogel mesh. Because the timing of this enzymatic reaction can be adjusted by altering the ratio of thrombin to fibrinogen, or the ratio of calcium to thrombin, one can injection mold constructs with a number of different geometries (11,12). Further we can generate alignment of the resulting tissue by how we constrain the gel during culture (13). After culturing the engineered cardiac tissue constructs for two weeks under static conditions, the cardiac cells have begun to remodel the construct and can generate a contraction force under electrical pacing conditions (6). As part of this protocol, we also describe methods for analyzing the tissue engineered myocardium after the culture period including functional analysis of the active force generated by the cardiac muscle construct upon electrical stimulation, as well as methods for determining final cell viability (Live-Dead assay) and immunohistological staining to examine the expression and morphology of typical proteins important for contraction (Myosin Heavy Chain or MHC) and cellular coupling (Connexin 43 or Cx43) between myocytes.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2011-10-05", "authors": ["KathyYuan Ye", "Kelly ElizabethSullivan", "Lauren DeemsBlack"], "doi": "10.3791/3251"}

It has been proposed that the highly homologous G(i) isoforms are functionally distinct. To test for isoform-specific functions of G(i) proteins, we examined their role in the regulation of cardiac L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC).\nVentricular tissues and isolated myocytes were obtained from mice with targeted deletion of either G\u03b1(i2) (G\u03b1(i2) (-/-)) or G\u03b1(i3) (G\u03b1(i3) (-/-)). mRNA levels of G\u03b1(i/o) isoforms and L-VDCC subunits were quantified by real-time PCR. G\u03b1(i) and Ca(v)\u03b1(1) protein levels as well as protein kinase B/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation levels were assessed by immunoblot analysis. L-VDCC function was assessed by whole-cell and single-channel current recordings.\nIn cardiac tissue from G\u03b1(i2) (-/-) mice, G\u03b1(i3) mRNA and protein expression was upregulated to 187 \u00b1 21% and 567 \u00b1 59%, respectively. In G\u03b1(i3) (-/-) mouse hearts, G\u03b1(i2) mRNA (127 \u00b1 5%) and protein (131 \u00b1 10%) levels were slightly enhanced. Interestingly, L-VDCC current density in cardiomyocytes from G\u03b1(i2) (-/-) mice was lowered (-7.9 \u00b1 0.6 pA/pF, n = 11, p<0.05) compared to wild-type cells (-10.7 \u00b1 0.5 pA/pF, n = 22), whereas it was increased in myocytes from G\u03b1(i3) (-/-) mice (-14.3 \u00b1 0.8 pA/pF, n = 14, p<0.05). Steady-state inactivation was shifted to negative potentials, and recovery kinetics slowed in the absence of G\u03b1(i2) (but not of G\u03b1(i3)) and following treatment with pertussis toxin in G\u03b1(i3) (-/-). The pore forming Ca(v)\u03b1(1) protein level was unchanged in all mouse models analyzed, similar to mRNA levels of Ca(v)\u03b1(1) and Ca(v)\u03b2(2) subunits. Interestingly, at the cellular signalling level, phosphorylation assays revealed abolished carbachol-triggered activation of ERK1/2 in mice lacking G\u03b1(i2).\nOur data provide novel evidence for an isoform-specific modulation of L-VDCC by G\u03b1(i) proteins.

Recently, we were presented with a case that challenged the specificity of cTnT.\nPatients with myopathies seen in the Neuromuscular Clinic at the Mayo Clinic were screened for increases in cTnT. If present, an assay for cTnI was performed. If normal, skeletal biopsy tissue was obtained for Western blot analysis using the capture and detection antibodies from both the fourth-generation and high-sensitivity cTnT assays. Results were compared with findings in normal cardiac tissue.\nSixteen patients had increases in cTnT but not cTnI. All had a myopathy by clinical evaluation, clinical testing, and biopsy. Four residual biopsy samples were obtained. All 3 antibodies used in the cTnT (M11.7, M7) and high-sensitivity cTnT (5D8, M7) assays were immunoreactive with a 37- to 39-kDa protein in all 4 diseased skeletal muscle biopsy specimens and in cardiac tissue. A second immunoreactive isoform (34 to 36 kDa) was also found in 1 patient. None of the noncardiac control tissues expressed immunoreactive protein.\nThese results document that there are forms in diseased skeletal muscle that could cause increases in circulating levels of cTnT.

Consumption of diets rich in flavonoids is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. Oxidative stress resulting from increased production of free radicals associated with decreased levels of antioxidants in the myocardium plays a major role in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction. This study aims to evaluate the preventive effects of (-) epicatechin on oxidative stress in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with (-) epicatechin (20mg/kg body weight) daily for 21 days. After pretreatment, isoproterenol (100mg/kg body weight) was injected into the rats at an interval of 24h for two days to induce myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol induced rat's electrocardiogram showed elevated ST segments and significant increase in the activity of serum creatine kinase-MB, level of serum troponin-T and increased intensities of serum lactate dehydrogenase 1 and 2-isoenzymes. The rats also showed significant increased levels of heart lipid peroxidation products and significant decreased activities of heart superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and levels of reduced glutathione. Pretreatment with (-) epicatechin revealed significant protective effects on all the biochemical parameters and electrocardiogram investigated. Histopathology of myocardium confirmed the present findings. The in vitro study on the effects of (-) epicatechin on scavenging free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl revealed the free radical scavenging potential of (-) epicatechin.

However, the size of the engineered patch is limited due to insufficient vascularization. This study evaluated the effects of autologous atrial tissue patch cardiomyoplasty and omentopexy in rats with myocardial infarction.\nMyocardial infarction was induced by left coronary artery ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats. Three weeks later, either a patch of left atrium (A group) or omentum (O group) or both (OA group) were placed over the infarct zone. The atrial tissue patch was harvested from the autologous left atrial appendage along its long axis. The rats in the Control group received rethoracotomy only. After 4 weeks, the survival of the transplanted atrial tissue patch, ventricular remodeling, and cardiac performance were examined.\nAfter 4 weeks, surviving myocardium was only detected in the OA group, as indicated by immunolabeling of cardiac troponin-I. Compared with the Control group, only animals in the OA group showed improved heart function assessed by left ventricular ejection fraction (57.9% \u00b1 5.8% vs 47.5% \u00b1 4.5%, p < 0.05) and left ventricular fractional shortening (25.2% \u00b1 3.6% vs 20.7% \u00b1 2.0%, p < 0.05). The histologic analysis demonstrated increased scar thickness in the OA group. This was accompanied by increased angiogenesis of the border zone but decreased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase and endothelin-1 levels.\nThe omentopexy supported the survival of the autologous atrial tissue patch, which resulted in attenuated ventricular remodeling and restoration of heart function in rats with myocardial infarction.

Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a regular chow or a high-fat diet for 15 weeks, and consumed 6% deuterium-enriched drinking water as a tracer for 14 days. CL and PE were extracted from cardiac tissue and isolated by TLC. Fatty acids from CL, PE, and plasma were analyzed by GC/MS for deuterium incorporation. Results showed oleate and vaccenate turnover were the highest in CL whereas palmitate and stearate turnover were low. Among the nonessential fatty acids in PE, turnover of stearate and vaccenate were the highest. The high turnover rate in vaccenate was unexpected, because vaccenate previously had no known metabolic or physiologic function.

Abnormalities in cardiac impulse propagation underlie lethal reentrant arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation.

Electrical stimulation has been applied to nervous tissue to cause reversible conduction block, but has not been explored sufficiently in cardiac tissue. We show that reversible propagation block can be achieved in cardiac tissue by holding myocardial cells in a refractory state for a designated period of time by applying a sustained sinusoidal high-frequency alternating current (HFAC); in doing so, reentrant arrhythmias are terminated. We demonstrate proof of concept using several models, including optically mapped monolayers of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, Langendorff-perfused guinea pig and rabbit hearts, intact anesthetized adult rabbits, and computer simulations of whole-heart impulse propagation.

Fecal bile acids excretion was increased in HC rats treated with OS. The high serum levels of TBARS as well as AST, ALT, AP, LDH, CK-MB significantly decreased in HC rats treated with OS. OS suppressed the high level of TABARS and raised the low activities of GPx and CAT without any impact on SOD in the liver. As for the cardiac tissues, OS lowered the high level of TABARS, and raised the activities of GPx, CAT, and SOD. Histopathological results show that OS preserved the liver and myocardial tissues. It can be concluded that OS leaf extracts decreased hepatic and serum lipid profile, and provided the liver and cardiac tissues with protection from hypercholesterolemia. The lipid-lowering effect is probably due to the rise of bile acids synthesis using cholesterol as precursor, and antioxidative activity to protect liver from hypercholesterolemia.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2011-09-29", "authors": ["ThamolwanSuanarunsawat", "Watcharaporn Devakul NaAyutthaya", "ThanapatSongsak", "SuwanThirawarapan", "SomlakPoungshompoo"], "doi": "10.1155/2011/962025"}

Moreover, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis directly activates endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase and NO generation in the heart. However, the role of ACE2 in cardiovascular remodeling induced by persistent inhibition of NO under chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) remains poorly understood.\nChimeric hypertensive mice that exhibit activation of the human RAS were produced by mating human renin (hRN) and human angiotensinogen (hANG) transgenic mice. Persistent NO inhibition with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was started at 8 weeks of age for 4 weeks. After administration of L-NAME, blood pressure (BP) markedly increased in the chimeric mice (hRN/hANG-Tg), whereas wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) showed little increase in BP. Cardiovascular remodeling with enhanced oxidative stress in hRN/hANG-Tg was markedly accelerated by NO inhibition compared with that in wild-type mice. Moreover, ACE2 mRNA expression and activity in cardiac tissue were markedly reduced in L-NAME-treated hRN/hANG-Tg. Co-administration of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan, inhibited L-NAME-induced cardiovascular remodeling and improved the reduction in cardiac ACE2. The preventive effect of olmesartan on cardiac hypertrophy was blunted by co-administration of a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist, [D-Ala7]-Ang-(1-7).\nOur findings demonstrate that cardiovascular remodeling induced by persistent NO inhibition was enhanced in hRN/hANG-Tg.

In this study, novel polyplex-microbubbles were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for systemic circulation and tumor transfection. Branched polyethylenimine (PEI; 25 kDa) was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG; 5 kDa), thiolated and covalently attached to maleimide groups on lipid-coated microbubbles. The PEI-microbubbles demonstrated increasingly positive surface charge and DNA loading capacity with increasing maleimide content. The in vivo ultrasound contrast persistence of PEI-microbubbles was measured in the healthy mouse kidney, and a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model accounting for free and adherent microbubbles was developed to describe the anomalous time-intensity curves. The model suggested that PEI loading dramatically reduced free circulation and increased nonspecific adhesion to the vasculature. However, DNA loading to form polyplex-microbubbles increased circulation in the bloodstream and decreased nonspecific adhesion. PEI-microbubbles coupled to a luciferase bioluminescence reporter plasmid DNA were shown to transfect tumors implanted in the mouse kidney. Site-specific delivery was achieved using ultrasound applied over the tumor area following bolus injection of the DNA/PEI-microbubbles. In vivo imaging showed over 10-fold higher bioluminescence from the tumor region compared to untreated tissue.

{"title": "Calcium signaling in pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells represent a new source of biological material allowing the exploration of signaling phenomena during normal cell development and differentiation. Still, the calcium signaling pathways and intracellular calcium responses to various ligands or stress conditions have not been sufficiently explored as yet in embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells and in their differentiated offspring. This is partly due to the special culturing conditions of these cell types, the rapid morphological and functional changes in heterogeneous cell populations during early differentiation, and methodological problems in cellular calcium measurements. In this paper, we review the currently available data in the literature on calcium signaling in pluripotent stem cells and discuss the potential shortcomings of these studies. Various assay methods are surveyed for obtaining reliable data both in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and in specific, stem cell-derived human tissues. In this paper, we present the modulation of calcium signaling in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and in their derivates; mesenchymal stem cell like (MSCl) cells and cardiac tissues using the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 and confocal microscopy. LPA, trypsin and angiotensin II were effective in inducing calcium signals both in HUES9 and MSCl cells. Histamine and thrombin induced calcium signal exclusively in the MSCl cells, while ATP was effective only in HUES9 cells. There was no calcium signal evoked by GABA, even at relatively high concentrations. In stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes a rapid increase in the beating rate and an increase of the calcium signal peaks could be observed after the addition of adrenaline, while verapamil led to a strong decrease in cellular calcium and stopped spontaneous contractions in a relaxed state.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular endocrinology", "date": "2011-09-29", "authors": ["\u00c1gotaAp\u00e1ti", "KatalinP\u00e1szty", "ZsuzsaErdei", "Korn\u00e9liaSzeb\u00e9nyi", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3Homolya", "Bal\u00e1zsSarkadi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mce.2011.08.038"}

Here we present the first characterisation of host immune responses to CMS assessed by microarray transcriptome profiling.\nUnvaccinated farmed Atlantic salmon post-smolts were infected by intraperitoneal injection of PMCV and developed cardiac pathology consistent with CMS. From analysis of heart samples at several time points and different tissues at early and clinical stages by oligonucleotide microarrays (SIQ2.0 chip), six gene sets representing a broad range of immune responses were identified, showing significant temporal and spatial regulation. Histopathological examination of cardiac tissue showed myocardial lesions from 6 weeks post infection (wpi) that peaked at 8-9 wpi and was followed by a recovery. Viral RNA was detected in all organs from 4 wpi suggesting a broad tissue tropism. High correlation between viral load and cardiac histopathology score suggested that cytopathic effect of infection was a major determinant of the myocardial changes. Strong and systemic induction of antiviral and IFN-dependent genes from 2 wpi that levelled off during infection, was followed by a biphasic activation of pathways for B cells and MHC antigen presentation, both peaking at clinical pathology. This was preceded by a distinct cardiac activation of complement at 6 wpi, suggesting a complement-dependent activation of humoral Ab-responses. Peak of cardiac pathology and viral load coincided with cardiac-specific upregulation of T cell response genes and splenic induction of complement genes. Preceding the reduction in viral load and pathology, these responses were probably important for viral clearance and recovery.\nBy comparative analysis of gene expression, histology and viral load, the temporal and spatial regulation of immune responses were characterised and novel immune genes identified, ultimately leading to a more complete understanding of host-virus responses and pathology and protection in Atlantic salmon during CMS.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2011-09-29", "authors": ["GerritTimmerhaus", "AlekseiKrasnov", "P\u00e5lNilsen", "MartaAlarcon", "SergeyAfanasyev", "MaritRode", "HaraldTakle", "Sven MartinJ\u00f8rgensen"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-12-459\n10.1136/vr.146.17.500\n10.1016/j.cbd.2010.04.006\n10.1038/nri2413\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80020-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011487\n10.1186/1743-422X-7-309\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2009.01047.x\n10.1111/j.1365-3083.2008.02201.x\n10.1016/j.fsi.2007.01.005\n10.1016/j.fsi.2006.11.011\n10.1016/j.fsi.2005.01.010\n10.1128/JVI.76.16.8040-8049.2002\n10.1016/j.febslet.2010.02.041\n10.1186/1471-2164-9-37\n10.1128/JVI.01650-07\n10.1038/nature05732\n10.1093/molbev/msp074\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104619\n10.1016/j.micinf.2005.02.001\n10.1016/S0145-305X(01)00038-6\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2010.00919.x\n10.1038/nri2802\n10.1016/j.autrev.2008.07.044\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.1998.tb01264.x\n10.1016/j.fsi.2009.06.007\n10.1016/j.fsi.2005.04.004\n10.4049/jimmunol.0900038\n10.1016/S0168-1702(99)00063-5\n10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.06.032\n10.1038/ng1201-365\n10.1186/1471-2164-9-299\n10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.01876.x\n10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797\n10.1093/nar/29.9.e45\n10.1007/s10126-005-5164-4"}

Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD-1; CD39) which converts the proinflammatory molecules ATP or ADP to AMP is a key regulator of purinergic modulation. However, the salutary effects of transgenic over expression of ENTPD-1 on myocardial response to ischemic injury have not been tested to date. Therefore we hypothesized that ENTPD-1 over expression affords myocardial protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury via specific cell signaling pathways. ENTPD-1 transgenic mice, which over express human ENTPDase-1, and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to either ex vivo or in vivo ischemia-reperfusion injury. Infarct size, inflammatory cell infiltrate and intracellular signaling molecule activation were evaluated. Infarct size was significantly reduced in ENTPD-1 versus WT hearts in both ex vivo and in vivo studies. Following ischemia-reperfusion injury, ENTPD-1 cardiac tissues demonstrated an increase in the phosphorylation of the cellular signaling molecule extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2). Resistance to myocardial injury was abrogated by treatment with a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-SPT or the more selective A(2B) adenosine receptor antagonist, MRS 1754, but not the A(1) selective antagonists, DPCPX.

These results suggest that transgenic ENTPDase-1 expression preferentially conveys myocardial protection from ischemic injury via adenosine A(2B) receptor engagement and associated phosphorylation of the cellular protective signaling molecules, Akt, ERK 1/2 and GSK-3\u03b2 that prevents detrimental opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2011-09-24", "authors": ["MingCai", "Zachary MHuttinger", "HengHe", "WeizhiZhang", "FengLi", "Lauren AGoodman", "Debra GWheeler", "Lawrence JDruhan", "Jay LZweier", "Karen MDwyer", "GuanglongHe", "Anthony J Fd'Apice", "Simon CRobson", "Peter JCowan", "Richard JGumina"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.09.003"}

This study aimed to characterize the cellular microRNA profile involved in the development of congenital heart malformation, through the investigation of single ventricle (SV) defects. Comprehensive miRNA profiling in human fetal SV cardiac tissue was performed by deep sequencing. Differential expression of 48 miRNAs was revealed by sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection (SOLiD) analysis. Of these, 38 were down-regulated and 10 were up-regulated in differentiated SV cardiac tissue, compared to control cardiac tissue. This was confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Predicted target genes of the 48 differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed by gene ontology and categorized according to cellular process, regulation of biological process and metabolic process.

This study was designed to understand adaptive mechanisms involved in intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in cardiomyocytes from the mammalian hibernator, ground squirrel, compared to rat. Electrophysiological and confocal imaging experiments showed that the voltage-dependence of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) was shifted to higher potentials in ventricular myocytes from ground squirrels vs. rats. The elevated threshold of I(Ca) did not compromise the Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release, because a higher depolarization rate and a longer duration of action potential compensated the voltage shift of I(Ca). Both the caffeine-sensitive and caffeine-resistant components of cytosolic Ca(2+) removal were more rapid in ground squirrels. Ca(2+) sparks in ground squirrels exhibited larger amplitude/size and much lower frequency than in rats. Due to the high I(Ca) threshold, low SR Ca(2+) leak and rapid cytosolic Ca(2+) clearance, heart cells from ground squirrels exhibited better capability in maintaining intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis than those from rats and other nonhibernating mammals. These findings not only reveal adaptive mechanisms of hibernation, but also provide novel strategies against Ca(2+) overload-related heart diseases.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-09-22", "authors": ["Xiao-ChenLi", "LingWei", "Guang-QinZhang", "Zai-LingBai", "Ying-YingHu", "PengZhou", "Shu-HuaBai", "ZhenChai", "Edward GLakatta", "Xue-MeiHao", "Shi-QiangWang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0024787"}
{"title": "Evolution of spiral and scroll waves of excitation in a mathematical model of ischaemic border zone.", "abstract": "Abnormal electrical activity from the boundaries of ischemic cardiac tissue is recognized as one of the major causes in generation of ischemia-reperfusion arrhythmias. Here we present theoretical analysis of the waves of electrical activity that can rise on the boundary of cardiac cell network upon its recovery from ischaemia-like conditions. The main factors included in our analysis are macroscopic gradients of the cell-to-cell coupling and cell excitability and microscopic heterogeneity of individual cells. The interplay between these factors allows one to explain how spirals form, drift together with the moving boundary, get transiently pinned to local inhomogeneities, and finally penetrate into the bulk of the well-coupled tissue where they reach macroscopic scale. The asymptotic theory of the drift of spiral and scroll waves based on response functions provides explanation of the drifts involved in this mechanism, with the exception of effects due to the discreteness of cardiac tissue. In particular, this asymptotic theory allows an extrapolation of 2D events into 3D, which has shown that cells within the border zone can give rise to 3D analogues of spirals, the scroll waves. When and if such scroll waves escape into a better coupled tissue, they are likely to collapse due to the positive filament tension. However, our simulations have shown that such collapse of newly generated scrolls is not inevitable and that under certain conditions filament tension becomes negative, leading to scroll filaments to expand and multiply leading to a fibrillation-like state within small areas of cardiac tissue.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-09-22", "authors": ["Vadim NBiktashev", "Irina VBiktasheva", "Narine ASarvazyan"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0024388"}

Besides contractile function, the stiffness of tissue engineered constructs is crucial to generate transplantable tissue surrogates with sufficient mechanical stability to withstand the high pressure present in the heart. Although several collagen cross-linking techniques have proven to be efficient in stabilizing biomaterials, they cannot be applied to cardiac tissue engineering, as cell death occurs in the treated area. Here, we present a novel method using femtosecond (fs) laser pulses to increase the stiffness of collagen-based tissue constructs without impairing cell viability.

One day post-irradiation, stress-strain measurements revealed increased tissue stiffness by around 40% being dependent on the fibroblast content in the tissue. At the same time, cells remained viable and fully functional as demonstrated by fluorescence imaging of cardiomyocyte mitochondrial activity and preservation of active contraction force.

Reduced blood flow to heart tissue leads to decreased heart function and symptoms of heart failure. Therapies to improve heart function in chronic coronary artery disease are important to identify. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are an important therapy for prevention of coronary artery disease, but also have non-cholesterol lowering effects. Our prior work showed that pravastatin improves contractile function in the chronically ischemic heart in pigs. Endothelial progenitor cells are a potential source of new blood vessels in ischemic tissues. While statins are known to increase the number of early outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells, their effects on late outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells (LOEPCs) and capillary density in ischemic heart tissue are not known. We hypothesized that statins exert positive effects on the mobilization and growth of late outgrowth EPCs, and capillary density in ischemic heart tissue.\nWe determined the effects of statins on the mobilization and growth of late outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells from pigs. We also determined the density of capillaries in myocardial tissue in pigs with chronic myocardial ischemia with or without treatment with pravastatin. Pravastatin therapy resulted in greater than two-fold increase in CD31+ LOEPCs versus untreated animals. Addition of pravastatin or simvastatin to blood mononuclear cells increased the number of LOEPCs greater than three fold in culture. Finally, in animals with chronic myocardial ischemia, pravastatin increased capillary density 46%.\nStatins promote the derivation, mobilization, and clonal growth of LOEPCs. Pravastatin therapy in vivo increases myocardial capillary density in chronically ischemic myocardium, providing an in vivo correlate for the effects of statins on LOEPC growth in vitro.

Compared to normal-weight controls, starved, but not obese rats had significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3) in the blood. When compared to normally fed animals, the hearts of starved and obese animals expressed higher levels of mRNAs encoding proinflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, IL-12, iNOS), while mRNA levels of the anti-inflammatory TGF-\u03b2 remained unchanged. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ghrelin (1 \u03bcg/day) for five consecutive days significantly reduced TNF, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in the blood of starved rats, as well as TNF, IL-17 and IL-12p40 mRNA expression in the hearts of obese rats. Conversely, ICV ghrelin increased the levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 mRNA in the heart tissue of food-restricted animals. This was associated with an increase of immunosuppressive ACTH/corticosterone production in starved animals and a decrease of the immunostimulatory adipokine leptin both in food-restricted and high-fat groups. Ghrelin activated the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus and inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the hearts of obese, but not starved rats.

At present diseases are diagnosed by detection of pathogens and clinical symptoms. Identification of genes involved in early responses to viruses is important for better knowledge of antiviral defence and development of diagnostic tools. The aim of this study was to search for gene markers common for viral infections in Atlantic salmon based on microarray analyses of a wide range of samples. Gene expression profiles from fish and cell cultures infected with different viruses and treated with the synthetic double-stranded RNA poly(I:C) were compared in order to identify virus responsive genes (VRG). The list of VRG defined in this study contained 117 genes with known or unidentified functions. Several genes, including the most highly ranked one (receptor transporting protein), had not been previously reported to be involved in antiviral defence. VRG were characterized by a rapid induction and low tissue specificity, and their expression levels were related to the viral load. Immunofluorescence analyses of proteins encoded by VRG in cardiac tissue of salmon with the viral disease cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) revealed a common expression pattern. In head kidney leukocytes VRG showed comparable or equal responses to CpG and poly(I:C), which mimic respectively bacterial DNA and viral RNA. Most VRG showed highly correlated expression with interferon-a (IFNa). Sequence comparison of salmon VRG with those from other species gave an understanding of the evolution of these genes, which showed a remarkably rapid sequence divergence in comparison with the entire proteome. VRG emerged both before and after separation of teleosts and tetrapods, and among genes found exclusively in fish species there were members of several multigene families: tripartite motif proteins, gig1- and gig2-like proteins. Several VRG, including genes with unknown functions and orthologs to mammalian RNA helicase RIG-I and chemokine C-X-C type 10, were present in cyprinid and salmonid fish but not in the phylogenetically advanced orders, suggesting that they have been lost in the evolution of Teleostei.

In summary, this study demonstrated the feasibility and sensitivity of [(18)F]FEAU PET/CT imaging for long-term, in-vivo monitoring (up to 5 months) of the fate of intramyocardially injected sr39HSV1-tk-MSC cells.

In this project we applied Laser-Induced-Forward-Transfer (LIFT) cell printing technique and prepared a cardiac patch seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human MSC (hMSC) in a defined pattern for cardiac regeneration. We seeded HUVEC and hMSC in a defined pattern on a Polyester urethane urea (PEUU) cardiac patch. On control patches an equal amount of cells was randomly seeded without LIFT. Patches were cultivated in\u00a0vitro or transplanted in\u00a0vivo to the infarcted zone of rat hearts after LAD-ligation. Cardiac performance was measured by left ventricular catheterization 8 weeks post infarction. Thereafter hearts were perfused with fluorescein tomato lectin for the assessment of functional blood vessels and stored for histology analyses. We demonstrated that LIFT-derived cell seeding pattern definitely modified growth characteristics of co-cultured HUVEC and hMSC leading to increased vessel formation and found significant functional improvement of infarcted hearts following transplantation of a LIFT-tissue engineered cardiac patch. Further, we could show enhanced capillary density and integration of human cells into the functionally connected vessels of murine vascular system.

We aimed to explore whether the cardioprotective effect of IMD is mediated by inhibiting myocardial endoplasmic reticulum (sarcoplasmic reticulum) stress (ERS). In vitro, IMD(1-53) (10(-9), 10(-8), and 10(-7)\u00a0mol/l) directly inhibited the upregulation of ERS markers such as glucose-regulated protein 78, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein, and caspase-12 induced by the ERS inducers tunicamycin (Tm, 10\u00a0mg/ml) or dithiothreitol (DTT, 2\u00a0mmol/l) in cardiac tissue. IMD(1-53) also inhibited Tm- or DTT-induced upregulation of cleaved activating transcription factor 6 and 4. These inhibitory effects of IMD(1-53) were abolished by the IMD receptor antagonist IMD(17-47) (10(-6)\u00a0mol/l) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10\u00a0\u03bcmol/l).

{"title": "Metformin protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity: involvement of the adiponectin cardiac system.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin has cardiotoxic effects that limit its clinical benefit in cancer patients. Metformin exerts cardioprotective actions via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increases the expression of adiponectin and its receptors (adipoR1 and adipoR2) in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, but its effect on cardiac tissue is still unknown. This work aimed to study whether metformin exerts any protective action against the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin and whether the cardiac system of adiponectin is involved in any such action. The addition of doxorubicin (5\u03bcM) to adult mouse cardiomyocytes (HL-1 cell line) induced apoptosis, which was characterized by a loss of cell viability, activation of caspases, and fragmentation of the genetic material. Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Pretreatment with metformin (4mM, 24h) provided protection against doxorubicin-induced damage. This pretreatment significantly increased cell viability, attenuated the activation of caspases and the fragmentation of genetic material, and restored the antioxidant activity. In addition, metformin up-regulated the expression of adiponectin and its receptors, adipoR1 and adipoR2, in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, silencing either adipoR1 or adipoR2 with siRNA inhibited the AMPK activation and the protective effects of metformin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that metformin protects cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced damage and that the cardiac adiponectin system plays an important role in this protective action.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2011-09-13", "authors": ["Mari CAsensio-L\u00f3pez", "AntonioLax", "Domingo APascual-Figal", "MarianoVald\u00e9s", "Jes\u00fasS\u00e1nchez-M\u00e1s"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.08.015"}

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has emerged as a non-invasive tool to assess cardiac tissue characteristics. There is scarce data available on CMR in patients with Chagas' disease.\nTo describe CMR findings in patients with Chagas' disease living in a non-endemic area focusing on differentiation from other cardiomyopathies and relation with clinical status.\nSixty-seven Chagas' disease patients divided into 3 groups-group 1 (indeterminate form: positive serology without ECG or 2D-echocardiographic abnormalities; N = 27), group 2 (ECG abnormalities of Chagas' disease but normal 2D-echocardiography; N = 19), and group 3 (regional wall motion abnormalities, LV end-diastolic diameter >55 mm or LV ejection fraction <50% on echocardiography; N = 21)--were studied. The presence of wall motion abnormalities and delayed enhancement (DE) by CMR was more frequent in the inferolateral and apical segments. DE distribution in the myocardial wall was heterogeneous (subendocardial 26.8%, midwall 14.0%, subepicardial 22.6%, and transmural 36.0% of total segments with DE) and related to larger cardiac chambers and worse systolic function.\nPattern of DE in Chagas' disease may mimic that of both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies, with especial predilection for the apical and inferolateral segments of the left ventricle.

However, tissue engineering methodologies to assemble cardiac progenitors into aligned, 3-dimensional (3D) myocardial tissues capable of physiologically relevant electrical conduction and force generation are lacking. In this study, we introduced 3D cell alignment cues in a fibrin-based hydrogel matrix to engineer highly functional cardiac tissues from genetically purified mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiovascular progenitors (CVPs). Procedures for CM and CVP derivation, purification, and functional differentiation in monolayer cultures were first optimized to yield robust intercellular coupling and maximize velocity of action potential propagation. A versatile soft-lithography technique was then applied to reproducibly fabricate engineered cardiac tissues with controllable size and 3D architecture. While purified CMs assembled into a functional 3D syncytium only when supplemented with supporting non-myocytes, purified CVPs differentiated into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells, and autonomously supported the formation of functional cardiac tissues. After a total culture time similar to period of mouse embryonic development (21 days), the engineered cardiac tissues exhibited unprecedented levels of 3D organization and functional differentiation characteristic of native neonatal myocardium, including: 1) dense, uniformly aligned, highly differentiated and electromechanically coupled cardiomyocytes, 2) rapid action potential conduction with velocities between 22 and 25 cm/s, and 3) significant contractile forces of up to 2 mN.

{"title": "Use of human stem cell derived cardiomyocytes to examine sunitinib mediated cardiotoxicity and electrophysiological alterations.", "abstract": "Sunitinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stroma tumor, is associated with clinical cardiac toxicity. Although the precise mechanism of sunitinib cardiotoxicity is not known, both the key metabolic energy regulator, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and ribosomal S 6 kinase (RSK) have been hypothesized as causative, albeit based on rodent models. To study the mechanism of sunitinib-mediated cardiotoxicity in a human model, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) having electrophysiological and contractile properties of native cardiac tissue were investigated. Sunitinib was cardiotoxic in a dose-dependent manner with an IC\u2085\u2080 in the low micromolar range, observed by a loss of cellular ATP, an increase in oxidized glutathione, and induction of apoptosis in iPSC-CMs. Pretreatment of iPSC-CMs with AMPK activators AICAR or metformin, increased the phosphorylation of pAMPK-T172 and pACC-S79, but only marginally attenuated sunitinib mediated cell death. Furthermore, additional inhibitors of AMPK were not directly cytotoxic to iPSC-CMs up to 250 \u03bcM concentrations. Inhibition of RSK with a highly specific, irreversible, small molecule inhibitor (RSK-FMK-MEA) did not induce cytotoxicity in iPSC-CMs below 250 \u03bcM. Extensive electrophysiological analysis of sunitinib and RSK-FMK-MEA mediated conduction effects were performed. Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of AMPK and RSK are not a major component of sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. Although the exact mechanism of cardiotoxicity of sunitinib is not known, it is likely due to inhibition of multiple kinases simultaneously.

In the present study, we compared the cardioprotective effect of mildronate (100 mg/kg) and a combination of mildronate and L-carnitine (100 + 100 mg/kg) administered for 14 days with respect to the observed changes in l-carnitine level and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I)-dependent fatty acid metabolism in the heart tissues. Concentrations of L-carnitine and its precursor \u03b3-butyrobetaine (GBB) were measured by ultraperformance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, mitochondrial respiration, activity of CPT-I, and expression of CPT-IA/B messenger RNA (mRNA) were measured. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Administration of mildronate induced a 69% decrease in L-carnitine concentration and a 6-fold increase in GBB concentration in the heart tissue as well as a 27% decrease in CPT-I-dependent mitochondrial respiration on palmitoyl-coenzyme A. In addition, mildronate treatment induced a significant reduction in infarct size and also diminished the ischemia-induced respiration stimulation by exogenous cytochrome c. Treatment with a combination had no significant impact on L-carnitine concentration, CPT-I-dependent mitochondrial respiration, and infarct size.

In the present study, the protective effects of salvianolic acids (SA), notoginsengnosides (NG) and combination of SA and NG (CSN) against rat cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury were checked and the protein expression profiles of heart tissues were examined to search their possible protein targets.\nThe cardioprotective effects of SA, NG and CSN were checked in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) by temporarily occluding coronary artery for 20 min followed by reperfusion. Rats were grouped into sham-operation group, IR group, IR+SA group, IR+NG group and IR+CSN group. The plasma creatine kinase (CK) activities were measured using commercial kit and the percentages of infarcted area in total ventricle tissue were calculated after nitroblue-tetrazolium (N-BT) staining of heart tissue slices. Two-dimensional protein electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to check the protein expression profiles of heart tissues. Then, proteins differentially expressed between IR group and sham-operation group were identified using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS/MS). The regulative effects of SA, NG and CSN on these IR-related proteins were analyzed.\nTreatments including SA, NG and CSN all showed cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury and CSN exhibited to be the best. Eighteen proteins involved in IR injury were found. These proteins are involved in pathways including energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, muscle contraction, heat shock stress, cell survival and proliferation. The regulation of these proteins by SA, NG or CSN suggested possible protein targets in their cardioprotective effects.\nSA and NG showed both similarity and difference in their protein targets involved in cardioprotective effects.

{"title": "Corin-deficient W-sh mice poorly tolerate increased cardiac afterload.", "abstract": "C57BL/6-Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice are generally regarded as a mast cell-deficient model, as they lack the necessary kit receptor for mast cell development. Further characterization of this strain, however, indicates that C57BL/6-Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice also have a disruption in the Corin gene. Corin is a transmembrane serine protease critical for processing atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from pro-ANP through proteolytic cleavage. Pro-ANP is produced, stored and released by cardiac myocytes in response to atrial stretch and the stress generated by increased afterload such as increased ventricular pressure from aortic stenosis or myocardial infarction. ANP inhibits the effects of the renin-angiotensin system to preserve homeostasis under conditions of increased hemodynamic load, and changes in the level of its activating enzyme Corin have been observed during the progression to heart failure. Here, we investigate the effect of increased hemodynamic load on Corin-deficient C57BL/6-Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice. Ten-week old male mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction for 8 weeks and were monitored for changes in cardiac structure and function by echocardiography. Hearts were collected 8 weeks after surgery for molecular and histological analyses. Corin-deficient C57BL/6-Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice developed rapidly progressive and substantial left ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, and markedly impaired cardiac function during the 8 weeks after surgery, compared to wildtype mice. Concomitant with this we observed increased levels of ANP transcript, but a lack of prepro-ANP or pro-ANP protein in heart tissue extracted from Corin-deficient mice. Surprisingly, fibrosis was not increased in Corin-deficient mice when compared to wildtype mice. These data indicate that Corin's involvement in ANP processing is a key element in the heart's response to increased hemodynamic load.

Cells were infused 48\u00a0h after induction of MI and mice assessed 24\u00a0h later (72\u00a0h after MI) for bone marrow (BM), circulating and cardiac tissue-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. We showed that in the presence of either MSC type, overall macrophage/monocyte levels were reduced, including pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophages, while the proportion of alternatively activated M2-type macrophages was significantly increased in the circulation and heart but not the BM. Moreover, we found decreased expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, increased IL-10 expression and fewer apoptotic cardiomyocytes without changes in angiogenesis in the infarct area. Fractional shortening was enhanced 2\u00a0weeks after cell infusion but was similar to medium controls 16\u00a0weeks after MI. In vitro studies showed that BM MSCs increased the frequency of alternatively activated monocytes/macrophages, in part by MSC-mediated secretion of IL-10. Our data suggest a new mechanism for MSC-mediated enhancement of cardiac function, possibly via an IL-10 mediated switch from infiltration of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory macrophages at the infarct site.

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in industrialized countries and is expected to become a global epidemic within the twenty-first century. MI, the main cause of heart failure, leads to a loss of cardiac tissue impairment of left ventricular function. The damaged left ventricle undergoes progressive 'remodelling' and chamber dilation, with myocyte slippage and fibroblast proliferation. Repair of diseased myocardium with in vitro-engineered cardiac muscle patch/injectable biopolymers with cells may become a viable option for heart failure patients. These events reflect an apparent lack of effective intrinsic mechanism for myocardial repair and regeneration. Motivated by the desire to develop minimally invasive procedures, the last 10 years observed growing efforts to develop injectable biomaterials with and without cells to treat cardiac failure. Biomaterials evaluated include alginate, fibrin, collagen, chitosan, self-assembling peptides, biopolymers and a range of synthetic hydrogels. The ultimate goal in therapeutic cardiac tissue engineering is to generate biocompatible, non-immunogenic heart muscle with morphological and functional properties similar to natural myocardium to repair MI.

{"title": "Evaluation of homogenization techniques for the preparation of mouse tissue samples to support drug discovery.", "abstract": "In early drug-discovery research, understanding the tissue distribution of drug at the site of action can help to predict the toxicity, efficacy and exposure level of the drug. The bottleneck of tissue analysis by LC-MS/MS is the time-consuming homogenization step.\nBoth mechanical and enzymatic techniques for mouse tissue homogenization were evaluated, which included bead beater, polytron and enzymatic digestion. Brain, bone marrow, kidney, spleen and liver tissues can be homogenized effectively using the bead beater alone. Lung and heart tissues were best treated with collagenase first and then homogenized by the bead beater.\nHomogenization conditions for seven mouse tissues have been evaluated and optimized. These findings will expedite the preparation of tissue samples for analysis.", "journal": "Bioanalysis", "date": "2011-09-09", "authors": ["XiaorongLiang", "SavitaUbhayakar", "Bianca MLiederer", "BrianDean", "AnnRan-Ran Qin", "SheerinShahidi-Latham", "YuzhongDeng"], "doi": "10.4155/bio.11.181"}
{"title": "Imaging heart development using high-resolution episcopic microscopy.", "abstract": "Development of the heart in vertebrate embryos is a complex process in which the organ is continually remodelled as chambers are formed, valves sculpted and connections established to the developing vascular system. Investigating the genetic programmes driving these changes and the environmental factors that may influence them is critical for our understanding of congenital heart disease. A recurrent challenge in this work is how to integrate studies as diverse as those of cardiac gene function and regulation with an appreciation of the localised interactions between cardiac tissues not to mention the manner in which both may be affected by cardiac function itself.

{"title": "Design and characterization of a fluorescent ghrelin analog for imaging the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a.", "abstract": "Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide hormone produced in the stomach. It binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a), a class A G-protein-coupled receptor. In the present study, we describe the design, synthesis and characterization of a truncated, 18-amino acid analog of ghrelin conjugated to a fluorescent molecule, fluorocein isothiocyanate (FITC), through the addition of a lysine at its C terminus ([Dpr(octanoyl)(3), Lys(fluorescein)(19)]ghrelin(1-19)). Receptor binding affinity of this novel fluorescein-ghrelin(1-18) was similar to that of wild-type ghrelin and a synthetic GHS-R1a ligand, hexarelin. Live cell imaging in CHO/GHS-R1a cells demonstrated cell surface receptor labeling and internalization, and agonist activity of fluorescein-ghrelin(1-18) was confirmed by increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. We also show that GHS-R1a protein is expressed primarily in the heart when compared to all other organs, suggesting high receptor density in the left ventricle. Finally, we demonstrate that fluorescein-ghrelin(1-18) binds specifically to heart tissue in situ, and its binding is displaced by both wt ghrelin and hexarelin. We have therefore developed a novel imaging probe, fluorescein-ghrelin(1-18), that can be used to image GHS-R1a in situ, for the purposes of investigating mechanisms of receptor trafficking or pharmacological agents that target GHS-R1a.", "journal": "Regulatory peptides", "date": "2011-09-07", "authors": ["RebeccaMcGirr", "Mark SMcFarland", "JillianMcTavish", "Leonard GLuyt", "SavitaDhanvantari"], "doi": "10.1016/j.regpep.2011.08.011"}
{"title": "Myocardial injury after ischemia-reperfusion in mice deficient in Akt2 is associated with increased cardiac macrophage density.", "abstract": "Akt2 protein kinase has been shown to promote cell migration and actin polymerization in several cell types, including macrophages. Because migrating macrophages constitute an important inflammatory response after myocardial ischemia, we determined cardiac macrophage expression after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and cryo-injury in mice lacking Akt2 (Akt2-KO). At 7 days post-I/R, Akt2-KO cardiac tissues showed an increase in immunohistochemical staining for macrophage markers (Galectin 3 and F4/80) compared with wild-type (WT) mice, indicating macrophage density was increased in the injured Akt2-KO myocardium. This change was time dependent because macrophage density was similar between WT and Akt2-KO myocardium at 3 days post-I/R, but by 7 and 14 days post-I/R, macrophage density was significantly increased in Akt2-KO myocardium. Concomitantly, infarct size was larger and cardiac function was reduced in Akt2-KO mice subjected to I/R. However, when cryo-infarction produced similar infarct sizes in the anterior wall in both WT and Akt2-KO mice, macrophage density remained higher in Akt2-KO mouse myocardium, suggesting Akt2 regulates myocardial macrophage density independent of infarct size. Consistently, bone marrow from Akt2-KO mice enhanced myocardial macrophage density in both C57/B6 WT and Akt2-KO recipient mice. Finally, reciprocal ex-vivo coculturing of macrophages and cardiac myocytes showed that activated Akt2-KO peritoneal macrophages had reduced mobility and adhesion when compared with WT littermate controls. Thus, although Akt-2 KO mice did not affect the initial inflammation response after injury and Akt2 deficiency has been shown to impair cell migration or motility in macrophages, our data suggested a novel mechanism in which increasing retention of Akt2-KO macrophages resulted in increasing cardiac Akt2-KO macrophage density in the myocardial space.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

In this study we compared the structural and biological features of collagen (C-RGD) or gelatin (G-FOAM)-based bioconstructs, seeded with human adult cardiac progenitor cells in the form of cardiospheres (CSps). The different morphology between C-RGD (fibrous ball-of-thread-like) and G-FOAM (trabecular sponge-like) was evidenced by SEM analysis and X-ray micro-tomography, and was reflected by their different mechanical characteristics. Seeded cells were viable and proliferating after 1 week in culture, and a reduced expression of cell-stress markers versus standard CSp culture was detected by realtime PCR. Cell engraftment inside the scaffolds was assessed by SEM microscopy and histology, evidencing more relevant cell migration and production of extracellular matrix in C-RGD versus G-FOAM. Immunofluorescence and realtime PCR analysis showed down-regulation of vascular and stemness markers, while early-to-late cardiac markers were consistently and significantly upregulated in G-FOAM and C-RGD compared to standard CSps culture, suggesting selective commitment towards cardiomyocytes.

In chronic viral infections, this cell subset has effector memory phenotype and displays antigen specificity. No previous studies of double positive T cells in parasite infections have been carried out.\nSeventeen chronic chagasic patients (7 asymptomatic and 10 symptomatic) and 24 non-infected donors, including 12 healthy and 12 with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy donors were analyzed. Peripheral blood was stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, HLA-DR and CD38, and lymphocytes for intracellular perforin. Antigen specificity was assessed using HLA*A2 tetramers loaded with T. cruzi K1 or influenza virus epitopes. Surface expression of CD107 and intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production were determined in K1-specific DP T cells from 11 chagasic donors. Heart tissue from a chronic chagasic patient was stained for both CD8 and CD4 by immunochemistry. Chagasic patients showed higher frequencies of DP T cells (2.1% \u00b1 0.9) compared with healthy (1.1% \u00b1 0.5) and non-chagasic cardiomyopathy (1.2% \u00b1 0.4) donors. DP T cells from Chagasic patients also expressed more HLA-DR, CD38 and perforin and had higher frequencies of T. cruzi K1-specific cells. IFN-\u03b3 production in K1-specific cells was higher in asymptomatic patients after polyclonal stimulation, while these cells tended to degranulate more in symptomatic donors. Immunochemistry revealed that double positive T cells infiltrate the cardiac tissue of a chagasic donor.\nChagasic patients have higher percentages of circulating double positive T cells expressing activation markers, potential effector molecules and greater class I antigenic specificity against T. cruzi.

{"title": "Perilipin 5, a lipid droplet-associated protein, provides physical and metabolic linkage to mitochondria.", "abstract": "Maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis is crucial to oxidative tissues, and it becomes compromised in obesity. Lipid droplets (LD) play a central role in lipid homeostasis by mediating fatty acid (FA) storage in the form of triglyceride, thereby lowering intracellular levels of lipids that mediate cellular lipotoxicity. LDs and mitochondria have interconnected functions, and anecdotal evidence suggests they physically interact. However, the mechanisms of interaction have not been identified. Perilipins are LD-scaffolding proteins and potential candidates to play a role in their interaction with mitochondria. We examined the contribution of LD perilipin composition to the physical and metabolic interactions between LD and mitochondria using multiple techniques: confocal imaging, electron microscopy (EM), and lipid storage and utilization measurements. Using neonatal cardiomyocytes, reconstituted cell culture models, and rodent heart tissues, we found that perilipin 5 (Plin5) recruits mitochondria to the LD surface through a C-terminal region. Compared with control cells, Plin5-expressing cells show decreased LD hydrolysis, decreased palmitate \u03b2-oxidation, and increased palmitate incorporation into triglycerides in basal conditions, whereas in stimulated conditions, LD hydrolysis inhibition is lifted and FA released for \u03b2-oxidation. These results suggest that Plin5 regulates oxidative LD hydrolysis and controls local FA flux to protect mitochondria against excessive exposure to FA during physiological stress.", "journal": "Journal of lipid research", "date": "2011-09-03", "authors": ["HongWang", "UrmillaSreenivasan", "HongHu", "AndrewSaladino", "Brian MPolster", "Linda MLund", "Da-WeiGong", "William CStanley", "CaroleSztalryd"], "doi": "10.1194/jlr.M017939"}

Hemodynamics, cardiovascular hypertrophy, angiotensin II (Ang II) concentrations, ACE and ACE2 activity were determined. Cardiac-tissue ACE and ACE2 expression were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Compared with sham-operated rats, systolic BPV and diastolic BPV increased and baroreflex sensitivity decreased significantly in SAD rats. SAD rats presented with obvious cardiovascular hypertrophy characterized by increased ratio of left ventricle weight to body weight and aortic weight to the length of aorta. There was no difference in plasma Ang II concentration between sham-operated and SAD rats. The cardiac and aortic ACE expression, aortic ACE2 expression and ACE activity were elevated in SAD rats. There was no significant difference in cardiac ACE2 expressions between sham-operated and SAD rats.

However, current cardiac devices, including newly developed catheter robots, are unable to accurately track and interact with the fast moving cardiac tissue without applying potentially damaging forces. This paper examines the challenges of implementing force control on a flexible robotic catheter. In particular, catheter friction and backlash must be compensated when controlling tissue interaction forces. Force controller designs are introduced and evaluated experimentally in a number of configurations. The controllers are based on the inner position loop force control approach where the position trajectory is adjusted to achieve a desired force on the target. Friction and backlash compensation improved force tracking up to 86% with residual RMS errors of 0.11 N while following a prerecorded cardiac tissue trajectory with accelerations of up to 3800 mm/s(2).

Rarely, severe hypokalemia may result in rhabdomyolysis. Other manifestations of severe hypokalemia include alteration of cardiac tissue excitability and conduction. Hypokalemia can produce electrocardiographic changes such as U waves, T-wave flattening, and arrhythmias, especially if the patient is taking digoxin. Common causes of hypokalemia include extrarenal potassium losses (vomiting and diarrhea) and renal potassium losses (eg, hyperaldosteronism, renal tubular acidosis, severe hyperglycemia, potassium-depleting diuretics) as well as hypokalemia due to potassium shifts (eg, insulin administration, catecholamine excess, familial periodic hypokalemic paralysis, thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis).

Little is known about the role of impaired oxidative phosphorylation in the progression of the disease, since previous studies of mitochondrial injuries are restricted to end-stage chronic heart failure. The present study aimed at evaluating the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of human heart failure. We measured the control of oxidative phosphorylation with high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized myocardial fibres from donor hearts (controls), and patients with no or mild heart failure but presenting with heart disease, or chronic heart failure due to dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy. The capacity of the phosphorylation system exerted a strong limitation on oxidative phosphorylation in the human heart, estimated at 121 pmol O(2)s(-1)mg(-1) in the healthy left ventricle. In heart disease, a specific defect of the phosphorylation system, Complex I-linked respiration, and mass-specific fatty acid oxidation were identified. These early defects were also significant in chronic heart failure, where the capacities of the oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer systems per cardiac tissue mass were decreased with all tested substrate combinations, suggesting a decline of mitochondrial density. Oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer system capacities were higher in ventricles compared to atria, but the impaired mitochondrial quality was identical in the four cardiac chambers of chronic heart failure patients. Coupling was preserved in heart disease and chronic heart failure, in contrast to the mitochondrial dysfunction observed after prolonged cold storage of cardiac tissue. Mitochondrial defects in the phosphorylation system, Complex I respiration and mass-specific fatty acid oxidation occurred early in the development of heart failure.

Maintenance of a three-dimensional tissue architecture is key to myocardial function in vivo, and a variety of studies hint that provision of topological cues within scaffolds can facilitate the engineering of functional myocardial tissue by promoting this architecture. To explore this possibility in an isolated and well-defined fashion, we have designed scaffolds of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with microtopographic pillars (\"micropegs\") to provide cells with defined structures with which to interact in three dimensions. We show that these surfaces permit HL-1 cardiomyocytes to grow, form myofibrillar structures and cell-cell adhesions, and beat spontaneously. Additionally, the cells and their nuclei interact with the full length of the micropegs, indicating that the micropegs promote a three-dimensional cytoarchitecture in the context of a two-dimensional scaffold. We also show that the number of cells interacting with a micropeg can be controlled by manipulating incubation time, micropeg spatial arrangement, or micropeg diameter. Western blots reveal that the expression of the junctional markers N-cadherin and connexin 43 is upregulated in the presence of specific arrangements of micropegs, suggesting that micropegs can enhance cardiomyocyte function.

Optimization of the derivatization protocol is described. This procedure enables analysis of the derivatives using on-line solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase liquid chromatography in combination with sensitive positive-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

However, sodium influx generates not only the upstroke of V(m), but also the downstroke of the extracellular potentials V(e) including epicardial surface potentials V(es). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of the maximal downstroke of V(es) (|dV(es)/dt (min)|) as a global index of electrical activation, based on the relationship of dV(m)/dt(max) to I(Na). To fulfill this purpose, we examined |dV(es)/dt(min)| experimentally using isolated perfused mouse hearts and computationally using a 3-D cardiac tissue bidomain model. In experimental studies, a custom-made cylindrical \"cage\" array with 64 electrodes was slipped over mouse hearts to measure V(es) during hyperkalemia, ischemia, and hypoxia, which are conditions that decrease I(Na). Values of |dV(es)/dt(min)| from each electrode were normalized (|dV(es)/dt (min)|(n)) and averaged (|dV(es)/dt(min)|(na)). Results showed that |dV(es)/dt(min)|(na) decreased during hyperkalemia by 28, 59, and 79% at 8, 10, and 12\u2009mM [K(+)](o), respectively. |dV(es)/dt(min)| also decreased by 54 and 84% 20 min after the onset of ischemia and hypoxia, respectively. In computational studies, |dV(es)/dt(min)| was compared to dV(m)/dt(max) at different levels of the maximum sodium conductance G(Na), extracellular potassium ion concentration [K(+)](o), and intracellular sodium ion concentration [Na(+)](i), which all influence levels of I(Na). Changes in |dV(es)/dt(min)|(n) were similar to dV(m)/dt (max) during alterations of G(Na), [K(+)](o), and [Na(+)](i).

{"title": "Probe Reports from the NIH Molecular Libraries Program", "abstract": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets that serves to influence heart rate, coronary artery caliber, endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity and lymphocyte recirculation through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. S1P3 receptor couples promiscuously to Gi, Gq, and G12/13 proteins, and its tissue distribution is widespread. Bradycardia and hypertension are clearly associated with S1P3 activation and its expression patterns in cardiac tissue. S1P3 on dendritic cells has been identified as a major exacerbating factor for mortality during sepsis by playing a role in the critical linkage of inflammation and coagulation pathways downstream of the thrombin cascade. Understanding the contributions of the individual S1P receptors has been limited by the unavailability of selective modulators for the 5 receptor subtypes. In the pilot phase of the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN), The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) reported four low micromolar agonist probes for S1P3: ML003, ML004, ML005 and ML006. The current report describes the development of ML249, a submicromolar allosteric agonist probe for S1P3. ML249 resulted from high-throughput screening using a cell-based assay employing a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3 receptor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct, and the G\u03b116 pathway coupling protein, followed by medicinal chemistry efforts. ML249 activates S1P3 receptor with an EC50 of 72.3 nM\u2013132 nM, and is inactive as an agonist against other members of the receptor family S1P1 (EC50 >10 \u03bcM), S1P2 (EC50 >50 \u03bcM), S1P4 (EC50 >50 \u03bcM), and S1P5 (EC50 >25 \u03bcM). Evidence is presented showing that ML249 is an allosteric agonist; it does not compete with physiological ligand S1P for binding to S1P3. In addition, ML249 is nontoxic to U2OS cells, with a CC50 >10 \u03bcM. ML249 was submitted to Ricerca Biosciences, LLC for target profiling against a panel of receptors, transporters, and ion channels; the data suggest that compound ML249 is generally inactive against a broad array of off-targets and does not likely exert unwanted effects. ML249 is the first submicromolar, completely selective S1P3 receptor agonist to be identified, and as an allosteric agonist promises to facilitate determination of key receptor interactions that would not otherwise be possible.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2010", "authors": ["MiguelGuerrero", "RamuluPoddutoori", "FernandoPinacho-Crisostomo", "Marie-ThereseSchaeffer", "Steven JBrown", "TimothySpicer", "PeterChase", "JillFerguson", "EdwardRoberts", "GermanaSanna", "PeterHodder", "HughRosen"], "doi": null}

The present study tested the hypothesis that maternal hypoxia results in reprogramming of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression patterns and fibrillar collagen matrix in the developing heart. Pregnant rats were treated with normoxia or hypoxia (10.5% O(2)) from day 15 to 21 of gestation. Hearts were isolated from 21-day fetuses (E21) and postnatal day 7 pups (PD7). Maternal hypoxia caused a decrease in the body weight of both E21 and PD7. The heart-to-body weight ratio was increased in E21 but not in PD7. Left ventricular myocardium wall thickness and cardiomyocyte proliferation were significantly decreased in both fetal and neonatal hearts. Hypoxia had no effect on fibrillar collagen content in the fetal heart, but significantly increased the collagen content in the neonatal heart. Western blotting revealed that maternal hypoxia significantly increased collagen I, but not collagen III, levels in the neonatal heart. Maternal hypoxia decreased MMP-1 but increased MMP-13 and membrane type (MT)1-MMP in the fetal heart. In the neonatal heart, MMP-1 and MMP-13 were significantly increased. Active MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and activities were not altered in either fetal or neonatal hearts. Hypoxia significantly increased tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3 and TIMP-4 in both fetal and neonatal hearts. In contrast, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were not affected. The results demonstrate that in utero hypoxia reprograms the expression patterns of MMPs and TIMPs and causes cardiac tissue remodeling with the increased collagen deposition in the developing heart.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We have shown earlier that LPS-induced signals in macrophages are mediated by aldose reductase (AR). Here we have investigated the role of AR in LPS-induced release of AA metabolites and their modulation using a potent pharmacological inhibitor, fidarestat, and AR siRNA ablation in RAW264.7 macrophages and AR-knockout mouse peritoneal macrophages and heart tissue. Inhibition or genetic ablation of AR prevented the LPS-induced synthesis and release of AA metabolites such as PGE2, TXB, PGI2, and LTBs in macrophages. LPS-induced activation of cPLA2 was also prevented by AR inhibition. Similarly, AR inhibition also prevented the calcium ionophore A23187-induced cPLA2 and LTB4 in macrophages. Further, AR inhibition by fidarestat prevented the expression of AA-metabolizing enzymes such as COX-2 and LOX-5 in RAW264.7 cells and AR-knockout mouse-derived peritoneal macrophages. LPS-induced expression of AA-metabolizing enzymes and their catalyzed metabolic products was significantly lower in peritoneal macrophages and heart tissue from AR-knockout mice. LPS-induced activation of redox-sensitive signaling intermediates such as MAPKs, transcription factor NF-\u03baB, and EGR-1, a transcriptional regulator of mPGES-1, which in collaboration with COX-2 leads to the production of PGE2, was also significantly prevented by AR inhibition. Taken together, our results indicate that AR mediates LPS-induced inflammation by regulating the AA-metabolic pathway and thus provide a novel role for AR inhibition in preventing inflammatory complications such as sepsis.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2011-08-23", "authors": ["MohammadShoeb", "Umesh C SYadav", "Satish KSrivastava", "Kota VRamana"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.07.024"}

Anterior descending coronary arteries of Sprague-Dawley rats were ligated, and MI was confirmed by morphologic and physiologic methods. Rats that underwent surgery without ligation served as the control group. We analyzed the expression of Sdc1 mRNA by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and that of Sdc1 protein by western blot in heart tissue from the MI border and compared it to the expression of soluble Sdc1 in serum. The myocardial levels of expression of Sdc1 mRNA and protein were very low in the sham group but increased significantly in the MI group (P<0.01). The expression of myocardial Sdc1 reached a peak at day 3 and declined gradually thereafter, although the levels at 14 days remained significantly higher than those in the sham group.

For anthracyclines, the clinically most relevant adverse effect is cardiotoxicity. The mechanisms involved are poorly understood and putative cardioprotectants are controversially discussed. Here, we show that the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin protects rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts from doxorubicin in vitro. Protection by lovastatin is related to inhibition of the Ras-homologous GTPase Rac1. It rests on a reduced formation of DNA double-strand breaks, resulting from the inhibition of topoisomerase II by doxorubicin. Doxorubicin transport and reactive oxygen species are not involved. Protection by lovastatin was confirmed in vivo. In mice, lovastatin mitigated acute doxorubicin-induced heart and liver damage as indicated by reduced mRNA levels of the pro-fibrotic cytokine connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Lovastatin also protected from doxorubicin-provoked subacute cardiac damage as shown by lowered mRNA levels of CTGF and atrial natriuretic peptide. Increase in the serum concentration of troponin I and cardiac fibrosis following doxorubicin treatment were also reduced by lovastatin. Whereas protecting the heart from harmful doxorubicin effects, lovastatin augmented its anticancer efficacy in a mouse xenograft model with human sarcoma cells.

However, functionality of optogenetic tools has not been fully explored outside neuroscience, and a nonviral, nonembryogenesis-based strategy for optogenetics has not been shown before.\nWe demonstrate the utility of optogenetics to cardiac muscle by a tandem cell unit (TCU) strategy, in which nonexcitable cells carry exogenous light-sensitive ion channels, and, when electrically coupled to cardiomyocytes, produce optically excitable heart tissue. A stable channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2)-expressing cell line was developed, characterized, and used as a cell delivery system. The TCU strategy was validated in vitro in cell pairs with adult canine myocytes (for a wide range of coupling strengths) and in cardiac syncytium with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. For the first time, we combined optical excitation and optical imaging to capture light-triggered muscle contractions and high-resolution propagation maps of light-triggered electric waves, found to be quantitatively indistinguishable from electrically triggered waves.\nOur results demonstrate feasibility to control excitation and contraction in cardiac muscle by light, using the TCU approach. Optical pacing in this case uses less energy, offers superior spatiotemporal control and remote access and can serve not only as an elegant tool in arrhythmia research but may form the basis for a new generation of light-driven cardiac pacemakers and muscle actuators.

In this study, we treated infected CBA mice with cromolyn, an MC stabilizer, and observed much greater parasitemia and interferon-\u03b3 levels, higher mortality, myocarditis, and cardiac damage. Although these data show that MCs are important in controlling acute infection, we observed MC apoptosis in the cardiac tissue and peritoneal cavity of untreated mice. In the heart, pericardial mucosal MC die, perhaps because of reduced amounts of local stem cell factor. Using RT-PCR in purified cardiac MCs, we observed that infection induced transcription of P2X(7) receptor and Fas, two molecules reportedly involved in cell death and inflammatory regulation. In gld/gld mice (FasL(-/-)), apoptosis of cardiac, but not peritoneal, MCs was decreased. Conversely, infection of P2X(7)(-/-) mice led to reduced peritoneal, but not cardiac, MC death.

{"title": "Adaptive mechanisms to compensate for overnutrition-induced cardiovascular abnormalities.", "abstract": "In conditions of overnutrition, cardiac cells must cope with a multitude of extracellular signals generated by changes in nutrient load (glucose, amino acids, and lipids) and the hormonal milieu [increased insulin (INS), ANG II, and adverse cytokine/adipokine profile]. Herein, we review the diverse compensatory/adaptive mechanisms that counter the deleterious effects of excess nutrients and growth factors. We largely focus the discussion on evidence obtained from Zucker obese (ZO) and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, which are useful models to evaluate adaptive and maladaptive metabolic, structural, and functional cardiac remodeling. One adaptive mechanism present in the INS-resistant ZO, but absent in the diabetic ZDF heart, involves an interaction between the nutrient sensor kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and ANG II-type 2 receptor (AT2R). Recent evidence supports a cardioprotective role for the AT2R; for example, suppression of AT2R activation interferes with antihypertrophic/antifibrotic effects of AT1R blockade, and AT2R agonism improves cardiac structure and function. We propose a scenario, whereby mTORC1-signaling-mediated increase in AT2R expression in the INS-resistant ZO heart is a cardioprotective adaptation to overnutrition. In contrast to the ZO rat, heart tissues of ZDF rats do not show activation of mTORC1. We posit that such a lack of activation of the mTOR\u2194AT2R integrative pathway in cardiac tissue under conditions of obesity-induced diabetes may be a metabolic switch associated with INS deficiency and clinical diabetes.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The consequences of its inactivation in adult mice, and of the ensuing activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), have been explored mainly in a tissue-specific manner. This mid-gestation lethality can be also circumvented by using a floxed Vhl allele in combination with an ubiquitous tamoxifen-inducible recombinase Cre-ER(T2). Here, we characterize a widespread reduction in Vhl gene expression in Vhl(floxed)-UBC-Cre-ER(T2) adult mice after dietary tamoxifen administration, a convenient route of administration that has yet to be fully characterized for global gene inactivation. Vhl gene inactivation rapidly resulted in a marked splenomegaly and skin erythema, accompanied by renal and hepatic induction of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene, indicative of the in vivo activation of the oxygen sensing HIF pathway. We show that acute Vhl gene inactivation also induced Epo gene expression in the heart, revealing cardiac tissue to be an extra-renal source of EPO. Indeed, primary cardiomyocytes and HL-1 cardiac cells both induce Epo gene expression when exposed to low O(2) tension in a HIF-dependent manner. Thus, as well as demonstrating the potential of dietary tamoxifen administration for gene inactivation studies in UBC-Cre-ER(T2) mouse lines, this data provides evidence of a cardiac oxygen-sensing VHL/HIF/EPO pathway in adult mice.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-08-04", "authors": ["MartaMir\u00f3-Murillo", "AinaraElorza", "In\u00e9sSoro-Arn\u00e1iz", "LucasAlbacete-Albacete", "AngelOrdo\u00f1ez", "EduardoBalsa", "AliciaVara-Vega", "SilviaV\u00e1zquez", "EstherFuertes", "CarmenFern\u00e1ndez-Criado", "Manuel OLand\u00e1zuri", "Juli\u00e1nAragon\u00e9s"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0022589"}

With progressive disease, most patients succumb to death from respiratory or heart failure, or both. However, the mechanisms, especially those governing cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in DMD, remain less understood. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) are a group of extracellular matrix proteases involved in tissue remodeling in both physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Previous studies have shown that MMP-9 exacerbates myopathy in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. However, the role and the mechanisms of action of MMP-9 in cardiac tissue and the biochemical mechanisms leading to increased levels of MMP-9 in mdx mice remain unknown. Our results demonstrate that the levels of MMP-9 are increased in the heart of mdx mice. Genetic ablation of MMP-9 attenuated cardiac injury, left ventricle dilation, and fibrosis in 1-y-old mdx mice. Echocardiography measurements showed improved heart function in Mmp9-deficient mdx mice. Deletion of the Mmp9 gene diminished the activation of ERK1/2 and Akt kinase in the heart of mdx mice. Ablation of MMP-9 also suppressed the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-12 in the heart of mdx mice. Finally, our experiments have revealed that osteopontin, an important immunomodulator, contributes to the increased amounts of MMP-9 in cardiac and skeletal muscle of mdx mice. This study provides a novel mechanism for development of cardiac dysfunction and suggests that MMP-9 and OPN are important therapeutic targets to mitigating cardiac abnormalities in patients with DMD.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2011-08-04", "authors": ["SaurabhDahiya", "SrikanthGivvimani", "ShephaliBhatnagar", "NatiaQipshidze", "Suresh CTyagi", "AshokKumar"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.1101342"}

Although we previously developed bioengineered myocardium using cell sheet-based tissue engineering technologies, the issue of appropriate cell sources remained unresolved. In the present study, we created cell sheets of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived cardiomyocytes after expansion in three-dimensional stirred suspension cultures. Serial treatment of the suspension cultures with noggin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor significantly increased the number of cardiomyocytes by more than fourfold compared with untreated cultures. After drug selection for ES cells expressing the neomycin-resistance gene under the control of the \u03b1-myosin heavy chain promoter, almost all of the cells showed spontaneous beating and expressed several cardiac contractive proteins in a fine striated pattern. When ES-derived cardiomyocytes alone were seeded onto temperature-responsive culture dishes, cell sheets were not created, whereas cocultures with cardiac fibroblasts promoted cell sheet formation. The cardiomyocytes in the cell sheets beat spontaneously and synchronously, and expressed connexin 43 at the edge of adjacent cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, when the extracellular action potential was recorded, unidirectional action potential propagation was observed. The present findings suggest that stirred suspension cultures with appropriate growth factors are capable of producing cardiomyocytes effectively and easily, and that ES-derived cardiac cell sheets may be a promising tool for the development of bioengineered myocardium.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-08-03", "authors": ["KatsuhisaMatsuura", "ShinakoMasuda", "YujiHaraguchi", "NorikoYasuda", "TatsuyaShimizu", "NobuhisaHagiwara", "Peter WZandstra", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.042"}

Myocarditis, observed in the acute and chronic phases of the disease, is characterized by a mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate. We previously identified a myeloid cell population in the inflammatory heart infiltrate of infected mice that expressed arginase I. In this study, we purified CD11b(+) myeloid cells from the heart and analyzed their phenotype and function. Those CD11b(+) cells were \u223c70% Ly6G(-)Ly6C(+) and 25% Ly6G(+)Ly6C(+). Moreover, purified CD11b(+)Ly6G(-) cells, but not Ly6G(+) cells, showed a predominant monocytic phenotype, expressed arginase I and inducible NO synthase, and suppressed anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Ab-induced T cell proliferation in vitro by an NO-dependent mechanism, activity that best defines myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Contrarily, CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) cells, but not CD11b(+)Ly6G(-) cells, expressed S100A8 and S100A9, proteins known to promote recruitment and differentiation of MDSCs. Together, our results suggest that inducible NO synthase/arginase I-expressing CD11b(+)Ly6G(-) myeloid cells in the hearts of T. cruzi-infected mice are MDSCs. Finally, we found plasma l-arginine depletion in the acute phase of infection that was coincident in time with the appearance of MDSCs, suggesting that in vivo arginase I could be contributing to l-arginine depletion and systemic immunosuppression. Notably, l-arginine supplementation decreased heart tissue parasite load, suggesting that sustained arginase expression through the acute infection is detrimental for the host.

Endothelial expression of thrombomodulin (TM), a key constituent of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, is markedly suppressed in VGs after implantation and contributes to local thrombus formation. While stretch-induced paracrine release of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is known to negatively regulate TM expression in heart tissue, its role in regulating TM expression in VGs remains unknown.\nChanges in relative mRNA expression of major TGF-\u03b2 isoforms were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in cultured human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells (HSVSMCs) subjected to cyclic stretch. To determine the effects of paracrine release of TGF-\u03b2 on endothelial TM mRNA expression, human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVECs) were co-cultured with stretched HSVSMCs in the presence of 1D11, a pan-neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 antibody, or 13C4, an isotype-control antibody. Groups of rabbits were then administered 1D11 or 13C4 and underwent interpositional grafting of jugular vein segments into the carotid circulation. The effect of TGF-\u03b2 inhibition on TM gene expression was measured by qPCR; protein C activating capacity and local thrombus formation were measured by in situ chromogenic substrate assays; and VG remodeling was assessed by digital morphometry.\nCyclic stretch induced TGF-\u03b2(1) expression in HSVSMCs by 1.9 \u00b1 0.2-fold (P < .001) without significant change in the expressions of TGF-\u03b2(2) and TGF-\u03b2(3). Paracrine release of TGF-\u03b2(1) by stretched HSVSMCs inhibited TM expression in stationary HSVECs placed in co-culture by 57 \u00b1 12% (P = .03), an effect that was abolished in the presence of 1D11. Similarly, TGF-\u03b2(1) was the predominant isoform induced in rabbit VGs 7 days after implantation (3.5 \u00b1 0.4-fold induction; P < .001). TGF-\u03b2(1) protein expression localized predominantly to the developing neointima and coincided with marked suppression of endothelial TM expression (16% \u00b1 2% of vein controls; P < .03), a reduction in situ activated protein C (APC)-generating capacity (53% \u00b1 9% of vein controls; P = .001) and increased local thrombus formation (3.7 \u00b1 0.8-fold increase over vein controls; P < .01). External stenting of VGs to limit vessel distension significantly reduced TGF-\u03b2(1) induction and TM downregulation. Systemic administration of 1D11 also effectively prevented TM downregulation, preserved APC-generating capacity, and reduced local thrombus in rabbit VGs without observable effect on neointima formation and other morphometric parameters 6 weeks after implantation.\nTM downregulation in VGs is mediated by paracrine release of TGF-\u03b2(1) caused by pressure-induced vessel stretch.

{"title": "Hemoglobin vesicle improves recovery of cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion by attenuating oxidative stress in isolated rat hearts.", "abstract": "Hemoglobin vesicle (HbV) could be a useful blood substitute in emergency medicine. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of HbV on cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) ex vivo. Isolated rat hearts were perfused according to the Langendorff method. An ischemia-reperfusion group (n = 6) was subjected to 25 minutes of global ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion. HbV (hemoglobin, 0.33 g/dL) was perfused before ischemia-reperfusion for 10 minutes (HbV group, n = 6). Hemodynamics were monitored, and tissue glutathione contents were measured. The redox state of reactive thiols in cardiac tissues was assessed by the biotinylated iodoacetamide labeling method. Left ventricular developed pressure was significantly recovered in the HbV group after 30 minutes of reperfusion (56.3 \u00b1 2.8 mm Hg vs. ischemia-reperfusion group 27.0 \u00b1 8.0 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Hemodynamic changes induced by HbV were similar to those observed when N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester was perfused for 10 minutes before ischemia-reperfusion (L-NAME group). The oxidized glutathione contents of cardiac tissues significantly decreased, and biotinylated iodoacetamide labeling of thiols was maintained in both the HbV and the L-NAME groups. HbV improved the recovery of cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion in isolated rat hearts.

Neospora caninum is a protozoan parasite of animals whose life cycle is very similar to T. gondii but uses canids as definitive hosts. Small rodents play an important role in the life cycle of T. gondii , and a few findings indicated that they may be natural intermediate hosts for N. caninum . The present study was aimed at identifying infections by T. gondii and N. caninum in urban rodents. Infections by T. gondii were quantified using isolation of the parasite by bioassay in mice; molecular methods were also used for both parasites. Overall, 217 rodents were captured. Brain and heart tissues of all rodents were bioassayed in mice for the detection of T. gondii infection. Brain and heart tissues of 121 rodents had the DNA extracted for molecular analysis. Toxoplasma gondii was isolated by bioassay from a single rodent. From the 121 rodents tested for the presence of T. gondii DNA, 2 animals were positive. In contrast, DNA of N. caninum was not detected in any of the samples.

{"title": "Video evaluation of the kinematics and dynamics of the beating cardiac syncytium: an alternative to the Langendorff method.", "abstract": "Many important observations and discoveries in heart physiology have been made possible using the isolated heart method of Langendorff. Nevertheless, the Langendorff method has some limitations and disadvantages such as the vulnerability of the excised heart to contusions and injuries, the probability of preconditioning during instrumentation, the possibility of inducing tissue edema, and high oxidative stress, leading to the deterioration of the contractile function. To avoid these drawbacks associated with the use of a whole heart, we alternatively used beating mouse cardiac syncytia cultured in vitro in order to assess possible ergotropic, chronotropic, and inotropic effects of drugs. To achieve this aim, we developed a method based on image processing analysis to evaluate the kinematics and the dynamics of the drug-stimulated beating syncytia starting from the video recording of their contraction movement. In this manner, in comparison with the physiological no-drug condition, we observed progressive positive ergotropic, positive chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects of 10 \u00b5M isoproterenol (\u00df-adrenergic agonist) and early positive ergotropic, negative chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects of 10 \u00b5M phenylephrine (alpha-adrenergic agonist), followed by a late phase with negative ergotropic, positive chronotropic, and negative inotropic trends. Our method permitted a systematic study of in vitro beating syncytia, producing results consistent with previous works. Consequently, it could be used in in vitro studies of beating cardiac patches, as an alternative to Langendorff's heart in biochemical and pharmacological studies, and especially when the Langendorff technique is inapplicable (e.g., in studies about human cardiac syncytium in physiological and pathological conditions, patient-tailored therapeutics, and syncytium models derived from induced pluripotent/embryonic stem cells with genetic mutations). Furthermore, the method could be helpful in heart tissue engineering and bioartificial heart research to \"engineer the heart piece by piece.\" In particular, the proposed method could be useful in the identification of a suitable cell source, in the development and testing of \"smart\" biomaterials, and in the design and use of novel bioreactors and microperfusion systems.", "journal": "The International journal of artificial organs", "date": "2011-07-26", "authors": ["LorenzoFassina", "AntonioDi Grazia", "FabioNaro", "LuciaMonaco", "Maria Gabriella CusellaDe Angelis", "GiovanniMagenes"], "doi": "10.5301/IJAO.2011.8510"}

Heart failure is one cause of SAP patient death. Intermedin (IMD) is a potent endogenous cardio-protective substance. Administration of exogenous IMD showed beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the myocardial damage in SAP and to determine the therapeutic potential of IMD for SAP. Using an SAP rat model, we examined endogenous IMD expression following SAP induction, and determined the effect of IMD on myocardial function, histological morphology, apoptosis-related gene expression, and prognosis. Our results indicated that the cardiac function and histological structure were significantly disrupted in SAP rats. Infusion of exogenous IMD significantly preserved cardiac function and ameliorated myocardial damage. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) revealed that myocardial apoptosis was extensively present in SAP rats, and IMD infusion led to increased expression of the prosurvival factor Bcl-2, but decreased pro-apoptotic factors Bax and caspase-3. In addition, IMD infusion also reversed the change of IMD receptor systems in SAP rat heart tissue. Furthermore, we found that IMD infusion greatly decreased mortality of SAP rats.

Hypoxia also occurs in microvascular disease and cardiac hypertrophy, and is thought to be a prime determinant of the progression to heart failure, as well as the driving force for compensatory angiogenesis. The non-invasive delineation and quantification of hypoxia in cardiac tissue therefore has the potential to be an invaluable experimental, diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for applications in cardiology. However, at this time there are no validated methodologies sufficiently sensitive or reliable for clinical use. PET imaging provides real-time spatial information on the biodistribution of injected radiolabeled tracer molecules. Its inherent high sensitivity allows quantitative imaging of these tracers, even when injected at sub-pharmacological (\u2265pM) concentrations, allowing the non-invasive investigation of biological systems without perturbing them. PET is therefore an attractive approach for the delineation and quantification of cardiac hypoxia and ischemia. In this review we discuss the key concepts which must be considered when imaging hypoxia in the heart. We summarize the PET tracers which are currently available, and we look forward to the next generation of hypoxia-specific PET imaging agents currently being developed.

Recently, electrospinning has gained huge momentum with greater accessibility of fabrication of composite, controlled and oriented nanofibers with sufficient porosity required for effective tissue regeneration. Current developments include the fabrication of nanofibrous scaffolds which can provide chemical, mechanical and biological signals to respond to the environmental stimuli. These nanofibers are fabricated by simple coating, blending of polymers/bioactive molecules or by surface modification methods. For obtaining optimized surface functionality, with specially designed architectures for the nanofibers (multi-layered, core-shell, aligned), electrospinning process has been modified and simultaneous 'electrospin-electrospraying' process is one of the most lately introduced technique in this perspective. Properties such as porosity, biodegradation and mechanical properties of composite electrospun nanofibers along with their utilization for nerve, cardiac, bone, skin, vascular and cartilage tissue engineering are discussed in this review. In order to locally deliver electrical stimulus and provide a physical template for cell proliferations, and to gain an external control on the level and duration of stimulation, electrically conducting polymeric nanofibers are also fabricated by electrospinning. Electrospun polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PAN) based scaffolds are the most extensively studied composite substrates for nerve and cardiac tissue engineering with or without electrical stimulations, and are discussed here.

S100A1, a positive inotropic regulator of myocardial contractility, becomes depleted in failing cardiomyocytes in humans and animals, and myocardial-targeted S100A1 gene transfer rescues cardiac contractile function by restoring sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca(2+)) handling in acutely and chronically failing hearts in small animal models. We induced heart failure in domestic pigs by balloon occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, resulting in myocardial infarction. After 2 weeks, when the pigs displayed significant left ventricular contractile dysfunction, we administered, by retrograde coronary venous delivery, AAV serotype 9 (AAV9)-S100A1 to the left ventricular, non-infarcted myocardium. AAV9-luciferase and saline treatment served as control. At 14 weeks, both control groups showed significantly decreased myocardial S100A1 protein expression along with progressive deterioration of cardiac performance and left ventricular remodeling. AAV9-S100A1 treatment prevented and reversed these functional and structural changes by restoring cardiac S100A1 protein levels. S100A1 treatment normalized cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) cycling, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling, and energy homeostasis.

{"title": "Enhanced repolarization capacity: new potential antiarrhythmic strategy based on HERG channel activation.", "abstract": "The delayed rectifier potassium current (I(K)) is the major outward current responsible for ventricular repolarization in cardiac tissues. Based on kinetic properties and drug sensitivity it is composed of a slow (I(Ks)) and a rapid (I(Kr)) component, the latter is mediated by hERG channels. Suppression of IKr is the common mechanism of action of all class III antiarrhythmics, causing prolongation of the refractory period. However, lengthening of repolarization - either by a pathological factor or due to a pharmacological intervention - threatens with an increased risk of EAD generation and the concomitant sudden cardiac death. Therefore, a new potential anti-arrhythmic strategy, based on augmentation of the repolarization reserve, has been emerged. Recently a new class of compounds has been introduced as activators of the hERG channel. In this article we systematically review the chemical structures found to enhance IKr. Since the majority of previous experiments were performed in expression systems or in rodent cardiac preparations (neither is relevant to the human heart), in the second part of this article we present some results obtained with NS1643, the best examined hERG activator, in canine ventricular cardiomyocytes. This preparation is believed to have electrophysiological parameters most resembling those of human. NS1643 shortened the duration of canine ventricular action potential and was shown to interact with several transmembrane ion currents, including I(Ca), I(Kr), I(Ks), and I(to). However, the action potential shortening effect of NS1643 is likely related to inhibition of ICa, in addition to the enhancement of IKr.

Insulin, given alone, or in combination with E2, decreased plasma glucose level at all time points, but did not influence FFA level, while E2 treatment itself did not change glucose and FFA concentration. Insulin increased PM GLUT4 and GLUT1 content 30 and 40\u2009min after treatment and the increases were partially accompanied by decrease in transporter LDM content. E2 increased PM content and decreased LDM content only of GLUT4 at 30\u2009min. Insulin generally, and E2 at 20\u2009min increased CD36 content in PM fraction. Both hormones decreased CD36 LDM content 20\u2009min after administration.

Here, we investigated the effect of short- and long-term insulin administration on mitochondrial function in peripheral tissues of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic rats. In addition, the in vitro effect of methylglyoxal (MG), advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and human diabetic plasma on mitochondrial activity was investigated in skeletal muscle and liver mitochondria and in rat skin primary fibroblasts. Hyperglycemic STZ rats showed tissue-specific patterns of energy deficiency, evidenced by reduced activities of complexes I, II and/or IV after 30 days of hyperglycemia in heart, skeletal muscle and liver; moreover, cardiac tissue was found to be the most sensitive to the diabetic condition, since energy metabolism was impaired after 10 days of the hyperglycemia. Insulin-induced tight glycemic control was effective in protecting against the hyperglycemia-induced inhibition of mitochondrial enzyme activities. Furthermore, the long-term hormone replacement (30 days) also increased these activities in kidney from STZ-treated animals, where the hyperglycemic state did not modify the electron transport activity. Results from in vitro experiments indicate that mitochondrial impairment could result from oxidative stress-induced accumulation of MG and/or AGEs. Further investigations demonstrated that human plasma AGE accumulation elicits reduced mitochondrial function in skin fibroblast. These data suggest that persistent hyperglycemia results in tissue-specific patterns of energy deficiency and that early and continuous insulin therapy is necessary to maintain proper mitochondrial metabolism.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2011-07-20", "authors": ["Aline PertileRemor", "Filipe Jos\u00e9de Matos", "KarinaGhisoni", "Thiago Lenoirda Silva", "GreiciEidt", "Mar\u00edliaB\u00farigo", "Andreza Fabrode Bem", "Paulo C\u00e9sar LockSilveira", "Andr\u00e9sde Le\u00f3n", "Maria CeciliaSanchez", "AlexandreHohl", "VivianeGlaser", "Carlos-AlbertoGon\u00e7alves", "Andr\u00e9Quincozes-Santos", "RafaelBorba Rosa", "AlexandraLatini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.06.017"}
{"title": "The role of photon scattering in voltage-calcium fluorescent recordings of ventricular fibrillation.", "abstract": "Recent optical mapping studies of cardiac tissue suggest that membrane voltage (V(m)) and intracellular calcium concentrations (Ca) become dissociated during ventricular fibrillation (VF), generating a proarrhythmic substrate. However, experimental methods used in these studies may accentuate measured dissociation due to differences in fluorescent emission wavelengths of optical voltage/calcium (V(opt)/Ca(opt)) signals. Here, we simulate dual voltage-calcium optical mapping experiments using a monodomain-Luo-Rudy ventricular-tissue model coupled to a photon-diffusion model. Dissociation of both electrical, V(m)/Ca, and optical, V(opt)/Ca(opt), signals is quantified by calculating mutual information (MI) for VF and rapid pacing protocols. We find that photon scattering decreases MI of V(opt)/Ca(opt) signals by 23% compared to unscattered V(m)/Ca signals during VF. Scattering effects are amplified by increasing wavelength separation between fluorescent voltage/calcium signals and respective measurement-location misalignment. In contrast, photon scattering does not affect MI during rapid pacing, but high calcium dye affinity can decrease MI by attenuating alternans in Ca(opt) but not in V(opt). We conclude that some dissociation exists between voltage and calcium at the cellular level during VF, but MI differences are amplified by current optical mapping methods.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2011-07-20", "authors": ["Martin JBishop", "AlexanderRowley", "BlancaRodriguez", "GernotPlank", "David JGavaghan", "GilBub"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2011.06.012"}

{"title": "Effects of boundaries and geometry on the spatial distribution of action potential duration in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Increased dispersion of action potential duration across cardiac tissue has long been considered an important substrate for the development of most electrical arrhythmias. Although this dispersion has been studied previously by characterizing the static intrinsic gradients in cellular electrophysiology and dynamical gradients generated by fast pacing, few studies have concentrated on dispersions generated solely by structural effects. Here we show how boundaries and geometry can produce spatially dependent changes in action potential duration (APD) in homogeneous and isotropic tissue, where all the cells have the same APD in the absence of diffusion. Electrotonic currents due to coupling within the tissue and at the tissue boundaries can generate dispersion, and the profile of this dispersion can change dramatically depending on tissue size and shape, action potential morphology, tissue dimensionality, and stimulus frequency and location. The dispersion generated by pure geometrical effects can be on the order of tens of milliseconds, enough under certain conditions to produce conduction blocks and initiate reentrant waves.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2011-07-19", "authors": ["Elizabeth MCherry", "Flavio HFenton"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.06.039"}

This study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of ellagic acid on the levels of cardiac troponin-T, lysosomal enzymes, and membrane bound ATPases along with the role of pro inflammatory cytokine. Male albino Wistar rats were pretreated with ellagic acid (7.5 and 15 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 10 days. After the pretreatment period isoproterenol (100mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected to rats twice at an interval of 24h. The protective effects of pretreatment with ellagic acid were measured by biochemical analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Evidence of myocardial infarction in isoproterenol induced rats included significant increase in the serum level of cardiac troponin-T and decreased levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in heart tissue homogenate .The pretreatment with ellagic acid restored the levels of cardiac markers in the serum and heart tissue homogenates. The activities of lysosomal enzymes (\u03b2-d-glucuronidase, \u03b2-N-acetyl glucosaminidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, cathepsin-d and acid phosphatase) were increased significantly in the serum and heart tissue of isoproterenol-induced rats. The activity of Na(+)/K(+)ATPase declined while the activities of Ca(2+)ATPase and Mg(2+)ATPase were increased significantly in the heart of isoproterenol-induced rats. Pretreatment with ellagic acid restored the activities of lysosomal enzymes and membrane bound ATPases. The higher expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 in the isoproterenol-induced rats were controlled by the pretreatment with ellagic acid. Our results imply that oral pretreatment with ellagic acid protects the heart lysosomal membrane against isoproterenol-induced cardiac damage.

In the absence of a better strategy, strong, globally resetting electrical shocks remain the only reliable treatment for cardiac fibrillation. Here we establish the relationship between the response of the tissue to an electric field and the spatial distribution of heterogeneities in the scale-free coronary vascular structure. We show that in response to a pulsed electric field, E, these heterogeneities serve as nucleation sites for the generation of intramural electrical waves with a source density \u03c1(E) and a characteristic time, \u03c4, for tissue depolarization that obeys the power law \u03c4\u2009\u221d\u2009E(\u03b1). These intramural wave sources permit targeting of electrical turbulence near the cores of the vortices of electrical activity that drive complex fibrillatory dynamics. We show in vitro that simultaneous and direct access to multiple vortex cores results in rapid synchronization of cardiac tissue and therefore, efficient termination of fibrillation. Using this control strategy, we demonstrate low-energy termination of fibrillation in vivo.

We systematically analyzed 36 clinical human heart tissue samples and identified phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as a candidate biomarker for CHF.

Here, we have generated and assessed a bispecific antibody heterodimer designed to improve the retention of bone-marrow-derived multipotent stromal cells (BMMSC) in cardiac tissue damaged by myocardial infarction. The heterodimer comprises an anti-human CD90 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 5E10) and an anti-myosin light chain 1 (MLC1) mAb (clone MLM508) covalently cross-linked by a bis-arylhydrazone. We modified the anti-CD90 antibody with a pegylated-4-formylbenzamide moiety to a molar substitution ratio (MSR) of 2.6 and the anti-MLC1 antibody with a 6-hydrazinonicotinamide moiety to a MSR of 0.9. The covalent modifications had no significant deleterious effect on mAb epitope binding. Furthermore, the binding of anti-CD90 antibody to BMMSCs did not prevent their differentiation into adipo-, chondro-, or osteogenic lineages. Modified antibodies were combined under mild conditions (room temperature, pH 6, 1 h) in the presence of a catalyst (aniline) to allow for rapid generation of the covalent bis-arylhydrazone, which was monitored at A(354). We evaluated epitope immunoreactivity for each mAb in the construct. Flow cytometry demonstrated binding of the bispecific construct to BMMSCs that was competed by free anti-CD90 mAb, verifying that modification and cross-linking were not detrimental to the anti-CD90 complementarity-determining region. Similarly, ELISA-based assays demonstrated bispecific antibody binding to plastic-immobilized recombinant MLC1. Excess anti-MLC1 mAb competed for bispecific antibody binding. Finally, the anti-CD90 \u00d7 anti-MLC1 bispecific antibody construct induced BMMSC adhesion to plastic-immobilized MLC1 that was resistant to shear stress, as measured in parallel-plate flow chamber assays.

A strong relationship between CT(max) and hematocrit (r(2) = 0.76) suggests that the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood may partially dictate acute lethal temperature.

Therefore we have characterized in three- five- and ten-month old mice i) the weight of different white adipose pads, heart and liver, ii) lipid content in these tissues/organs, and iii) responsiveness to acute leptin, measured in terms of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase B (Akt). In this study we have detected that leptin-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation appears to be preserved in cardiac tissue even in 10-month old animals but not in adipose tissue and liver of five- and ten-month old mice, respectively. Nevertheless, leptin increased pAkt content in the liver of these mice. In a parallel study we have analyzed the functionality of leptin signalling pathways in 10-month old obese mice and we have observed that the STAT3 pathway appears to be only operative in the heart whereas the Akt pathway remains functional both in heart and liver. Nevertheless, hepatic lipids increased almost 300% compared to age-matched lean controls.

{"title": "Adult human heart slices are a multicellular system suitable for electrophysiological and pharmacological studies.", "abstract": "Electrophysiological and pharmacological data from the human heart are limited due to the absence of simple but representative experimental model systems of human myocardium. The aim of this study was to establish and characterise adult human myocardial slices from small patients' heart biopsies as a simple, reproducible and relevant preparation suitable for the study of human cardiac tissue at the multicellular level. Vibratome-cut myocardial slices were prepared from left ventricular biopsies obtained from end-stage heart failure patients undergoing heart transplant or ventricular assist device implantation, and from hearts of normal dogs. Multiple slices were prepared from each biopsy. Regular contractility was observed at a range of stimulation frequencies (0.1-2 Hz), and stable electrical activity, monitored using multi-electrode arrays (MEA), was maintained for at least 8 h from slice preparation. ATP/ADP and phosphocreatine/creatine ratios were comparable to intact organ values, and morphology and gap junction distribution were representative of native myocardium. MEA recordings showed that field potential duration (FPD) and conduction velocity (CV) in human and dog slices were similar to the values previously reported for papillary muscles, ventricular wedges and whole hearts.

Some flavonoids which possess high affinity to iron can be used as iron chelators for curing iron overload diseases such as haemochromatosis. In this article, the effects of baicalin and quercetin on different mouse tissues (liver, kidney and heart) afflicted with iron overload-induced injury were studied. It was found that after administration of 500 mg kg\u207b\u00b9 iron dextran for 45 days, the degree of oxidative injury in the three organs was different. When iron dextran-induced iron-overloaded mice were fed a diet containing baicalin or quercetin (1% w/w), both flavonoids showed significant effects in suppressing iron overload-induced injury. The efficiencies of both flavonoids on different tissues varied. Both flavonoids caused a significant decrease of iron content in liver and kidney tissues but not in the heart, whereas the flavonoids were more efficient in inhibiting the increase of carbonyl content and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels in heart tissues. The results indicate that the protective effects of baicalin and quercetin on different tissues of iron-overloaded mice are different.", "journal": "Natural product research", "date": "2011-07-12", "authors": ["YanZhang", "ZhonghongGao", "JiaqinLiu", "ZhihongXu"], "doi": "10.1080/14786419.2010.495070"}

E3 ligase Nrdp1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cell apoptosis, inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may contribute to heart failure. However, the role of Nrdp1 in DOX-induced cardiac injury remains to be determined.\nWe examined the effect of Nrdp1 overexpression with DOX treatment in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and mouse heart tissue. Cardiomyocytes were infected with adenovirus containing GFP (Ad-GFP), Nrdp1 wild-type (Ad-Nrdp1) or the dominant-negative form of Nrdp1 (Ad-Dn-Nrdp1), then treated with DOX for 24 hr. DOX treatment increased cell death and apoptosis, with Ad-Nrdp1 infection enhancing these actions but Ad-Dn-Nrdp1 infection attenuating these effects. Furthermore, 5 days after a single injection of DOX (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), Nrdp1 transgenic mice (TG) showed decreased cardiac function and increased apoptosis, autophagy and oxidative stress as compared with wild-type (WT) mice (P<0.01). Survival rate was significantly lower in Nrdp1 TG mice than in WT mice 10 days after DOX injection (P<0.01).\nThese results were associated with decreased activation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways. Nrdp1 may be a key mediator in the development of cardiac dysfunction after DOX treatment and associated with inhibition of Akt, ERK1/2 and STAT3.

Because several studies have suggested that changes in mitochondrial function and morphology may contribute to AF, we developed a novel proteomic workflow focused on the identification of differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins in AF patients. Right human atrial tissue was collected from 20 patients, 10 with and 10 without AF, and the tissue was subjected to hydrostatic pressure cycling-based lysis followed by label-free mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of mitochondrial enriched isolates. Approximately 5% of the 700 proteins identified by MS analysis were differentially expressed between the AF and non-AF samples. We chose four differentially abundant proteins for further verification using reverse phase protein microarray analysis based on their known importance in energy production and regulatory association with atrial ion channels: four and a half LIM, destrin, heat shock protein 2, and chaperonin-containing TCP1. These initial study results provide evidence that a workflow to identify AF-related proteins that combines a powerful upfront tissue cell lysis with high resolution MS for discovery and protein array technology for verification may be an effective strategy for discovering candidate markers in highly fibrous tissue samples.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2011-07-09", "authors": ["MaryamGoudarzi", "Mark MRoss", "WeidongZhou", "AmyVan Meter", "JianghongDeng", "Lisa MMartin", "ChidimaMartin", "LanceLiotta", "EmanuelPetricoin", "NivAd"], "doi": "10.1021/pr200108m"}
{"title": "Sensing the cardiac environment: exploiting cues for regeneration.", "abstract": "Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies indicate that certain exogenous stem cells and biomaterials can preserve cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction. Regarding stem cells, a growing body of data suggests that the short-term positive outcomes are mainly attributed to paracrine signaling mechanisms. The release of such factors is due to the cell's ability to sense cardiac environmentally derived cues, though the exact feedback loops are still poorly understood. However, given the limited engraftment and survival of transplanted cells in the ischemic environment, the long-term clinical benefits of these therapies have not yet been realized. To overcome this, the long-term controlled delivery of bioactive factors using biomaterials is a promising approach. A major challenge has been the ability to develop timely and spatially controlled gradients of different cues, pivotal for the development and regeneration of tissues. In addition, given the complexity of the remodeling process after myocardial infarction, multiple factors may be required at distinct disease stages to maximize therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, novel smart materials that can sense the surrounding environment and generate cues through on demand mechanisms will be of major importance in the translation of these promising advanced therapies.

GNE knock out (GNE KO) mice are embryonically lethal at day E8.5. Although the role of GNE in the sialic pathway has been well established as well as the importance of sialylation in many diverse biological pathways, less is known about the involvement of GNE in muscle development. To address this issue we have studied the role of GNE during in vitro embryogenesis by comparing the developmental profile in culture of embryonic stem cells (ES) from wild type and from GNE KO E3.5 mice embryos, during 45 days. Neuronal cells appeared rarely in GNE KO ES cultures and did not reach an advanced differentiated stage. Although primary cardiac cells appeared at the same time in both normal and GNE KO ES cultures, GNE KO cardiac cells degraded very soon and their beating capacity decayed rapidly. Furthermore very rare skeletal muscle committed cells were detected in the GNE KO ES cultures at any stage of differentiation, as assessed by analysis of the expression of either Pax7, MyoD and MyHC markers. Beyond the supporting evidence that GNE plays an important role in neuronal cell and brain development, these results show that GNE is strongly involved in cardiac tissue and skeletal muscle early survival and organization. These findings could open new avenues in the understanding of muscle function mechanisms in health and in disease.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-07-07", "authors": ["IritMilman Krentsis", "IlanSela", "RachelEiges", "V\u00e9roniqueBlanchard", "MarkusBerger", "MichalBecker Cohen", "StellaMitrani-Rosenbaum"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0021389"}

CNP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-B mRNA expression were examined by RT-PCR in the H9c2 rat cardiac myoblast cell line, in neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as control.

The results showed that cardiac cells as well as endothelial cells were able to produce CNP. Unlike cardiomyocytes, as expected, in endothelial cells expression of BNP was not detected. NPR-B mRNA expression was found in both cell types. Production of CNP in the heart muscle cells at protein level was confirmed by radioimmunological determination (H9c2: CNP=0.86 \u00b1 0.083 pg/mg) and by immunocytochemistry studies.

The HL ligand acts as a monobasic tridentate ONS donor in all metal complexes, and coordinated through the phenolic OH, azomethine nitrogen and thione sulfur. Electronic spectra with magnetic moments suggested varieties of geometries around the central metal atoms. Thermal gravimetric analysis indicates that the complexes are stable up to 300\u00b0C, and release the uncoordinated and/or coordinated H(2)O/solvent molecules, which is accompanied by a color change.

The dynamics of the hybrid model are comparable to those of a spatially distributed tissue model with LR-I compartments.

Therefore, we hypothesize that (1) increased SDF-1 production will be observed in female hearts compared with male hearts in response to I/R, which is attributable to the effect of estrogen; and that (2) estrogen receptor (ER)\u03b1, not ER\u03b2 mediates estrogen-contributed SDF-1 expression in female hearts after I/R.\nHeart tissue subjected to I/R injury was assessed for myocardial expression of SDF-1 (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and SDF-1 receptor-CXCR4 (Western blot). Groups were as follows: Rat hearts from adult male, female, ovariectomized female (OVX F), and male and OVX F supplemented with chronic 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), and mouse hearts from adult male and female wild-type, ER\u03b1 knockout (ER\u03b1KO) and ER\u03b2KO.\nI/R significantly increased myocardial SDF-1 expression in both genders. Higher levels of SDF-1 existed in female hearts after I/R compared with males. Depletion of endogenous estrogen by ovariectomy reduced cardiac SDF-1 production in females after I/R. E2 supplementation significantly restored SDF-1 expression in OVX F and males compared with their counterparts. Notably, ablation of ER\u03b1, not ER\u03b2, markedly decreased SDF-1 production in females after I/R. Unlike SDF-1, cardiac CXCR4 expression was not affected by gender, sex hormone, or ERs in the ischemic heart.\nOur study represents the first evidence that female hearts exhibit higher levels of SDF-1 expression compared with males after acute I/R. This increased myocardial SDF-1 production in females is partly owing to effect of estrogen through ER\u03b1, but not ER\u03b2.", "journal": "Surgery", "date": "2011-07-02", "authors": ["ChunyanHuang", "HongmeiGu", "YuWang", "MeijingWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.surg.2011.05.010"}
{"title": "Drug-induced cardiac mitochondrial toxicity and protection: from doxorubicin to carvedilol.", "abstract": "Mitochondria have long been involved in several cellular processes beyond its role in energy production. The importance of this organelle for cardiac tissue homeostasis has been greatly investigated and its impairment can lead to cell death and consequent organ failure. Several compounds have been described in the literature as having direct effects on cardiac mitochondria which can provide a mechanistic explanation for their toxicological or pharmacological effects. The present review describes one classic example of drug-induced cardiac mitochondrial toxicity and another case of drug-induced mitochondrial protection. For the former, we present the case for doxorubicin, an anticancer agent whose treatment is associated with a cumulative and dose-dependent cardiomyopathy with a mitochondrial etiology. Following this, we present the case of carvedilol, a \u03b2-blocker with intrinsic antioxidant activity, which has been described to protect cardiac mitochondria from oxidative injury. The final part of the review integrates information from the previous chapters, demonstrating how carvedilol can contribute to reduce doxorubicin toxicity on cardiac mitochondria. The two referred examples result in important take-home messages: a) drug-induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction is an important contributor for drug-associated organ failure, b) protection of mitochondrial function is involved in the beneficial impact of some clinically-used drugs and c) a more accurate prediction of toxic vs. beneficial effects should be an important component of drug development by the pharmaceutical industry.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2011-07-02", "authors": ["Gon\u00e7alo CPereira", "Ana MSilva", "C\u00e1tia VDiogo", "Filipa SCarvalho", "PedroMonteiro", "Paulo JOliveira"], "doi": "10.2174/138161211796904812"}

The role of periostin in CRI-induced LVH is unknown.\nRats were 5/6-nephrectomized (NX), and after 15 weeks of disease progression high-calcium, high-phosphate or paricalcitol treatment was given for 12 weeks. Cardiac tissue and blood samples were taken to study periostin gene expression and to determine factors contributing to its reactivation, respectively. Left ventricular (LV) periostin expression was also examined in response to angiotensin II or arginine(8)-vasopressin (AVP)-induced pressure overload and in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\nCRI resulted in a 6.5-fold increase in LV periostin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Positive extracellular immunostaining for periostin was detected in areas of infiltrated inflammatory cells and fibrotic lesions. There was a significant correlation between LV periostin mRNA levels and plasma biomarkers of impaired kidney function, LVH, fibrogenesis-related proteins osteopontin and osteoactivin, and anti-calcific matrix Gla protein. Moreover, LV periostin gene expression in CRI correlated positively with systolic blood pressure (BP) and was activated rapidly in response to angiotensin II or AVP infusions.\nPeriostin is involved in fibrotic cardiac remodelling in CRI.

{"title": "Reorganized PKA-AKAP associations in the failing human heart.", "abstract": "Here we reveal that the characterization of large-scale re-arrangements of signaling scaffolds induced by heart failure can serve as a novel concept to identify more specific therapeutic targets. In the mammalian heart, the cAMP pathway, with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in a central role, acts directly downstream of adrenergic receptors to mediate cardiac contractility and rhythm. Heart failure, characterized by severe alterations in adrenergic stimulation is, amongst other interventions, often treated with \u03b2-blockers. Contrasting results, however, have shown both beneficial and detrimental effects of decreased cAMP levels in failing hearts. We hypothesize that the origin of this behavior lies in the complex spatiotemporal organization of the regulatory subunit of PKA (PKA-R), which associates tightly with various A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) to specifically localize PKA's activity. Using chemical proteomics directly applied to human patient and control heart tissue we demonstrate that the association profile of PKA-R with several AKAPs is severely altered in the failing heart, for instance effecting the interaction between PKA and the novel AKAP SPHKAP was 6-fold upregulated upon failing heart conditions. Also a significant increase in captured cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) was observed. The observed altered profiles can already explain many aspects of the aberrant cAMP-response in the failing human heart, validating that this dataset may provide a resource for several novel, more specific, treatment options.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the antioxidant effects and the potential related mechanisms of fasudil, a selective ROCK inhibitor, in high-cholesterol diet (HCD)-induced hypercholesterolemic rats. 2. Hypercholesterolemia was induced in rats by feeding with a HCD for 4 weeks. Starting from day 15, physiological saline (1 mL/100 g) or ROCK inhibitor, fasudil (10 or 30 mg/kg), was injected intraperitoneally for another 14 days. 3. The results showed that fasudil significantly suppressed ROCK activity, potently elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, as well as the concentration of nitric oxide in the serum and cardiac tissue. In addition, fasudil notably suppressed the extent of lipid peroxidation and attenuated the histopathological changes in the heart and liver of hypercholesterolemic rats. 4.

{"title": "Up-regulation of the cardiac lipid metabolism at the onset of heart failure.", "abstract": "Chronic pressure overload and atherosclerosis are primary etiologic factors for cardiac hypertrophy and failure. However, mechanisms underlying the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure are incompletely understood. We analyzed the development of heart failure in mice with chronic pressure overload induced by aortic constriction and compared the results with aged apolipoprotein E-deficient mice suffering from advanced atherosclerosis. We combined cardiac function analysis by echocardiography and invasive hemodynamics with a comprehensive microarray gene expression study (GSE25765-8). The microarray data showed that the onset of heart failure induced by pressure overload or advanced atherosclerosis was accompanied by a strong up-regulation of key lipid metabolizing enzymes involved in fat synthesis, storage and oxidation. Cardiac lipid overload may be involved in the progression of heart failure by enhancing cardiomyocyte death. Up-regulation of the cardiac lipid metabolism was related to oxygen and ATP depletion of failing hearts because anti-ischemic treatment with ranolazine normalized the cardiac lipid metabolism and improved cardiac function. Vice versa, inhibition of cellular respiration and ATP generation by mild thiol-blocking with cystamine triggered the cardiac lipid metabolism and caused signs of heart failure. Cardiac tissue specimens of patients with heart failure also showed high protein levels of key fat metabolizing enzymes as well as lipid accumulation. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that up-regulation of the cardiac lipid metabolism and myocardial lipid overload are underlying the development of heart failure.", "journal": "Cardiovascular & hematological agents in medicinal chemistry", "date": "2011-06-30", "authors": ["SaidAbdalla", "XuebinFu", "Sherif SElzahwy", "KristinKlaetschke", "ThomasStreichert", "UrsulaQuitterer"], "doi": "10.2174/187152511797037583"}
{"title": "Injectable acellular hydrogels for cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Injectable hydrogels are being developed as potential translatable materials to influence the cascade of events that occur after myocardial infarction. These hydrogels, consisting of both synthetic and natural materials, form through numerous chemical crosslinking and assembly mechanisms and can be used as bulking agents or for the delivery of biological molecules. Specifically, a range of materials are being applied that alter the resulting mechanical and biological signals after infarction and have shown success in reducing stresses in the myocardium and limiting the resulting adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Additionally, the delivery of molecules from injectable hydrogels can influence cellular processes such as apoptosis and angiogenesis in cardiac tissue or can be used to recruit stem cells for repair. There is still considerable work to be performed to elucidate the mechanisms of these injectable hydrogels and to optimize their various properties (e.g., mechanics and degradation profiles). Furthermore, although the experimental findings completed to date in small animals are promising, future work needs to focus on the use of large animal models in clinically relevant scenarios. Interest in this therapeutic approach is high due to the potential for developing percutaneous therapies to limit LV remodeling and to prevent the onset of congestive heart failure that occurs with loss of global LV function.

Although there have been numerous attempts at defining such 'hypertrophy', the present paper delineates the reasons as to why current definitions of cardiac hypertrophy remain unsatisfying. Based on a brief review of the underlying pathophysiology and tissue and cellular events driving myocardial remodelling with or without changes in heart dimensions, as well as current techniques to detect such changes, we propose to restrict the use of the currently popular term 'hypertrophy' to cardiac myocytes that may or may not accompany the more complex tissue rearrangements leading to changes in shape or size of the ventricles, more broadly referred to as 'remodelling'. We also discuss the great potential of genetically modified (mouse) models as tools to define the molecular pathways leading to the different forms of left ventricle remodelling. Finally, we present an algorithm for the stepwise assessment of myocardial phenotypes applicable to animal models using well-established imaging techniques and propose a list of parameters most suited for a critical evaluation of such pathophysiological phenomena in mouse models.

{"title": "Considerations for the use of cellular electrophysiology models within cardiac tissue simulations.", "abstract": "The use of mathematical models to study cardiac electrophysiology has a long history, and numerous cellular scale models are now available, covering a range of species and cell types. Their use to study emergent properties in tissue is also widespread, typically using the monodomain or bidomain equations coupled to one or more cell models. Despite the relative maturity of this field, little has been written looking in detail at the interface between the cellular and tissue-level models. Mathematically this is relatively straightforward and well-defined. There are however many details and potential inconsistencies that need to be addressed, in order to ensure correct operation of a cellular model within a tissue simulation. This paper will describe these issues and how to address them. Simply having models available in a common format such as CellML is still of limited utility, with significant manual effort being required to integrate these models within a tissue simulation. We will thus also discuss the facilities available for automating this in a consistent fashion within Chaste, our robust and high-performance cardiac electrophysiology simulator. It will be seen that a common theme arising is the need to go beyond a representation of the model mathematics in a standard language, to include additional semantic information required in determining the model's interface, and hence to enhance interoperability.

CBD-VEGF/collagen group could effectively induce more cells to penetrate into the collagen membrane after 4 weeks and promote more vascularization in infarcted myocardium after 12 weeks compared with the other two control groups. Echocardiography and hemodynamic studies both show cardiac function improvement in the CBD-VEGF/collagen group. These results reveal that implantation of CBD-VEGF collagen membrane patch into the infarcted myocardium could effectively improve left ventricle cardiac function and increase the vascular density.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Guided orientation of cardiomyocytes on electrospun aligned nanofibers for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering (TE) is one of the most promising strategies to reconstruct the infarct myocardium and the major challenge involves producing a bioactive scaffold with anisotropic properties that assist in cell guidance to mimic the heart tissue. In this study, random and aligned poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)/gelatin (PG) composite nanofibrous scaffolds were electrospun to structurally mimic the oriented extracellular matrix (ECM). Morphological, chemical and mechanical properties of the electrospun PG nanofibers were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and tensile measurements. Results indicated that PG nanofibrous scaffolds possessed smaller fiber diameters (239 \u00b1 37 nm for random fibers and 269 \u00b1 33 nm for aligned fibers), increased hydrophilicity, and lower stiffness compared to electrospun PCL nanofibers. The aligned PG nanofibers showed anisotropic wetting characteristics and mechanical properties, which closely match the requirements of native cardiac anisotropy. Rabbit cardiomyocytes were cultured on electrospun random and aligned nanofibers to assess the biocompatibility of scaffolds, together with its potential for cell guidance. The SEM and immunocytochemical analysis showed that the aligned PG scaffold greatly promoted cell attachment and alignment because of the biological components and ordered topography of the scaffolds. Moreover, we concluded that the aligned PG nanofibrous scaffolds could be more promising substrates suitable for the regeneration of infarct myocardium and other cardiac defects.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "An abundant, truncated human sulfonylurea receptor 1 splice variant has prodiabetic properties and impairs sulfonylurea action.", "abstract": "An alternatively spliced form of human sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1 mRNA lacking exon 2 (SUR1\u03942) has been identified. The omission of exon 2 caused a frame shift and an immediate stop codon in exon 3 leading to translation of a 5.6-kDa peptide that comprises the N-terminal extracellular domain and the first transmembrane helix of SUR1. Based on a weak first splice acceptor site in the human SUR1 gene (ABCC8), RT-PCR revealed a concurrent expression of SUR1\u03942 and SUR1. The SUR1\u03942/(SUR1\u00a0+\u00a0SUR1\u03942) mRNA ratio differed between tissues, and was lowest in pancreas (46%), highest in heart (88%) and negatively correlated with alternative splice factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2) expression. In COS-7 cells triple transfected with SUR1\u03942/SUR1/Kir6.2, the SUR1\u03942 peptide co-immunoprecipitated with Kir6.2, thereby displacing two of four SUR1 subunits on the cell surface. The ATP sensitivity of these hybrid ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)) channels was reduced by about sixfold, as shown with single-channel recordings. RINm5f rat insulinoma cells, which genuinely express SUR1 but not SUR1\u03942, exhibited a strongly increased K(ATP) channel current upon transfection with SUR1\u03942. This led to inhibition of glucose-induced depolarization, calcium flux, insulin release and glibenclamide action. A non-mutagenic SNP on nucleotide position 333 (Pro69Pro) added another exonic splicing enhancer sequence detected by ASF/SF2, reduced relative abundance of SUR1\u03942 and slightly protected from non-insulin dependent diabetes in homozygotic individuals. Thus, SUR1\u03942 represents an endogenous K(ATP)-channel modulator with prodiabetic properties in islet cells.

{"title": "SPARC regulates collagen interaction with cardiac fibroblast cell surfaces.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue from mice that do not express secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) have reduced amounts of insoluble collagen content at baseline and in response to pressure overload hypertrophy compared with wild-type (WT) mice. However, the cellular mechanism by which SPARC affects myocardial collagen is not clearly defined. Although expression of SPARC by cardiac myocytes has been detected in vitro, immunohistochemistry of hearts demonstrated SPARC staining primarily associated with interstitial fibroblastic cells. Primary cardiac fibroblasts isolated from SPARC-null and WT mice were assayed for collagen I synthesis by [(3)H]proline incorporation into procollagen and by immunoblot analysis of procollagen processing. Bacterial collagenase was used to discern intracellular from extracellular forms of collagen I. Increased amounts of collagen I were found associated with SPARC-null versus WT cells, and the proportion of total collagen I detected on SPARC-null fibroblasts without propeptides [collagen-\u03b1(1)(I)] was higher than in WT cells. In addition, the amount of total collagen sensitive to collagenase digestion (extracellular) was greater in SPARC-null cells than in WT cells, indicating an increase in cell surface-associated collagen in the absence of SPARC. Furthermore, higher levels of collagen type V, a fibrillar collagen implicated in collagen fibril initiation, were found in SPARC-null fibroblasts. The absence of SPARC did not result in significant differences in proliferation or in decreased production of procollagen I by cardiac fibroblasts. We conclude that SPARC regulates collagen in the heart by modulating procollagen processing and interactions with fibroblast cell surfaces. These results are consistent with decreased levels of interstitial collagen in the hearts of SPARC-null mice being due primarily to inefficient collagen deposition into the extracellular matrix rather than to differences in collagen production.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Previous studies reported that surface topography and substrate rigidity provide biomechanical cues to modulate cellular responses such as alignment, migration and differentiation.

Nanogrooved substrates (450nm in groove/ridge width; 100 or 350nm in depth) made of polystyrene and polyurethane were prepared by imprinting from polydimethylsiloxane molds. The morphology and orientation of cardiomyocytes attached to the substrates were found to be influenced mainly by the nanogrooved structures, while the contractile function of the cells was regulated by the coupled effect of surface topography and substrate stiffness. The distribution of intracellular structural proteins such as vinculin and F-actin showed that the surface topography and substrate stiffness regulated the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion complexes, and consequently the contractile behavior of the cardiomyocytes. The beating rates of the cultured cardiomyocytes were dependent on both the surface topography and the substrate stiffness.

Cardiac toxicity was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (20 mg/kg). Eugenol treatment (5 mg/kg/day, orally) was started 2 days before doxorubicin administration and continued for five consecutive days. Eugenol significantly reduced the elevated serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and restored the electrocardiographic disturbances resulted from doxorubicin administration. Also, eugenol reversed doxorubicin-induced deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms, decreased lipid peroxidation and attenuated the elevations in cytosolic Ca(2+) and nitric oxide levels in cardiac tissue. In addition, doxorubicin-induced cardiac tissue damage observed by histopathological examination was markedly ameliorated with eugenol. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that eugenol prevented the doxorubicin-induced activation of caspase-3 in cardiomyocytes. The cardioprotective effect afforded by eugenol was not significantly inhibited by prior administration of capsazepine, the transient potential vanilloid receptor-1 antagonist.

Here, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on cardiac fibroblast and myofibroblast viability and studied the molecular cell death mechanism triggered by simvastatin in both cell types.\nRat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were treated with simvastatin (0.1-10\u03bcM) up to 72h.

Cardiomyogenic differentiation was determined by immunocytochemical analysis of expression of cardiomyocyte markers and patch clamping recording of the action potential.\nA cardiomyocyte-like morphology and the expression of \u03b1-actinin and myosin heavy chain (MHC) proteins can be observed in both CMCM culturing or CMCM+S1P culturing groups after 5 days' culturing, however, only the cells in CMCM+S1P culture condition present cardiomyocyte-like action potential and voltage gated currents. A new approach was used to form PIPAAm based temperature-responsive culture surfaces and this successfully produced cell sheets from HUMSCs derived cardiomyocytes.\nThis study for the first time demonstrates that S1P potentiates differentiation of HUMSCs towards functional cardiomyocytes under the designated culture conditions. Our engineered cell sheets may provide a potential for clinically applicable myocardial tissues should promote cardiac tissue engineering research.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical science", "date": "2011-06-08", "authors": ["ZhenqiangZhao", "ZhibinChen", "XiuboZhao", "FangPan", "MeihuaCai", "TanWang", "HengguiZhang", "Jian RLu", "MingLei"], "doi": "10.1186/1423-0127-18-37\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0417\n10.1002/jcb.22193\n10.1371/journal.pone.0003336\n10.1089/scd.2008.0063\n10.1089/scd.2009.0023\n10.1096/fj.08-128900\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.01.051\n10.1021/bm050840b\n10.1093/jmcb/mjq011\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00110-8"}

OTC (100 mg per kg\u207b\u00b9 body weight) was orally administered to fish for 14 days. A significant elevation in the level of malondialdehyde, as an index of lipid peroxidation, and reductions in antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) and low molecular weight antioxidant (reduced glutathione) levels were observed in the blood, liver, kidney, spleen, and heart tissues of OTC-treated fish. OTC also had a suppressive effect on specific and non-specific immune system parameters, such as leucocyte counts, oxidative radical production (nitrobluetetrazolium activity), total plasma protein and immunoglobulin levels, and phagocytic activity. Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and simultaneous treatment with propolis (50 mg per kg\u207b\u00b9 body weight, orally) attenuated the OTC-induced oxidative stress by significantly decreasing the levels of malondialdehyde in tissues. In addition, propolis significantly increased the level of reduced glutathione and the catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities. Upon the administration of propolis, the suppressed immune system parameters were significantly increased in fish treated with OTC.

We investigated the protective effects of N-acetylcysteine on mitochondrial dysfunction in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats. Rats were pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (10 mg/kg) orally daily for 14 days. After pretreatment, rats were induced myocardial infarction by isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) at an interval of 24 h for 2 days. Lipid peroxidation products, antioxidants, lipids, mitochondrial marker enzymes and calcium in the mitochondrial heart were determined. Transmission electron microscopic and in vitro studies were also done. Isoproterenol treatment caused significant increase in mitochondrial lipid peroxides and lipids except phospholipids with significant decrease in mitochondrial antioxidants. Significant decreased activities of marker enzymes and significant increased calcium were observed in mitochondria of myocardial infarcted rats. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine showed significant protective effects on all the biochemical parameters and preserved the integrity of heart tissue and restored normal mitochondrial function in myocardial infarcted rats. Transmission electron microscopic findings on the structure of the heart mitochondria confirmed the protective effects and in vitro study also confirmed the antioxidant potential of NAC. The possible mechanism for the improved cardiac mitochondrial function might be due to scavenging free radicals, improving the antioxidant and mitochondrial marker enzymes, maintaining GSH levels, lipids and Ca(2+) levels by its antioxidant effect.

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of aqueous extract (AE) of Pimpinella tirupatiensis (Pt) tuberous root on cardiac oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in non-diabetic and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by a single administration of STZ (40 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p). AE (750 mg/kg/b.w./day) and glibenclamide (GLB) (20 mg/kg/b.w./day) were administrated orally by intra oral gastric tube for 30 days. After 4 weeks of hyperglycaemia the enzymatic and non-enzymatic factors were measured in cardiac tissue of diabetic and control groups. Xanthine oxidase activity (XOD), Uric acid (UA) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were significantly (p<0.01) elevated by 48, 48 and 50% respectively and the contents of glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid (AA) were significantly (p<0.01) diminished by 45 and 42% respectively in diabetic rats when compared to normal. Treatment with AE and GLB normalized the content of UA, GSH, AA, MDA and the activity of XOD. No significant changes were observed in control rats treated with AE. This data suggests that hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress in the heart, but the oxidative stress defense mechanisms in the heart tissue are fairly efficacious against oxidative injury by the treatment with AE and GLB.

The post-translational modifications (PTMs) and alternative splicing of cTnT may represent important regulatory mechanisms of cardiac contractility. However, a complete characterization of PTMs and alternatively spliced isoforms in cTnT present in vivo is lacking. Top-down protein mass spectrometry (MS) analyzes whole proteins, thus providing a global view of all types of modifications, including PTMs and sequence variants, simultaneously in one spectrum without a priori knowledge. In this study, we applied an integrated immunoaffinity chromatography and top-down MS approach to comprehensively characterize PTMs and alternatively spliced isoforms of cTnT purified from healthy human and wild-type mouse heart tissue. High-resolution Fourier transform MS revealed that human cTnT (hcTnT) and mouse cTnT (mcTnT) have similar phosphorylation patterns, whereas higher molecular heterogeneity was observed for mcTnT than hcTnT. Further MS/MS fragmentation of monophosphorylated hcTnT and mcTnT by electron capture dissociation and collisionally activated dissociation unambiguously identified Ser1 as the conserved in vivo phosphorylation site. In contrast, we identified a single spliced isoform for hcTnT but three alternatively spliced isoforms for mcTnT. Moreover, we observed distinct proteolytic degradation products for hcTnT and mcTnT.

Sunitinib also impacts IRE1, an endoplasmic reticulum protein involved in the unfolded protein response that is closely related to RNase L. Here, we report that sunitinib is a potent inhibitor of both RNase L and PKR with IC(50) values of 1.4 and 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition, flavonol activators of IRE1 inhibited RNase L. Sunitinib treatment of wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in about a 12-fold increase in encephalomyocarditis virus titers. However, sunitinib had no effect on encephalomyocarditis virus growth in cells lacking both PKR and RNase L. Furthermore, oral delivery of sunitinib in WT mice resulted in 10-fold higher viral titers in heart tissues while suppressing by about 2-fold the IFN-\u03b2 levels. In contrast, sunitinib had no effect on viral titers in mice deficient in both RNase L and PKR. Also, sunitinib reduced mean survival times from 12 to 6 days in virus-infected WT mice while having no effect on survival of mice lacking both RNase L and PKR.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), LIM-only adaptor PINCH-1, and \u03b1-parvin are essential components of focal adhesions (FAs), which are highly expressed in the heart. ILK binds tightly to PINCH-1 and \u03b1-parvin, which regulates FA assembly and promotes cell survival via the activation of the kinase Akt. Mice lacking ILK, PINCH or \u03b1-parvin have been shown to develop severe defects in the heart, suggesting that these proteins play a critical role in heart function. Utilizing failing human heart tissues (dilated cardiomyopathy, DCM), we found a 2.27-fold (p<0.001) enhanced expression of PINCH, 4 fold for \u03b1-parvin, and 10.5 fold (p<0.001) for ILK as compared to non-failing (NF) counterparts. No significant enhancements were found for the PINCH isoform PINCH-2 and parvin isoform \u03b2-parvin. Using a co-immunoprecipitation method, we also found that the PINCH-1-ILK-\u03b1-parvin (PIP) complex and Akt activation were significantly up-regulated. These observations were further corroborated with the mouse myocardial infarction (MI) and transaortic constriction (TAC) model. Thymosin beta4 (T\u03b24), an effective cell penetrating peptide for treating MI, was found to further enhance the level of PIP components and Akt activation, while substantially suppressing NF-\u03baB activation and collagen expression--the hallmarks of cardiac fibrosis. In the presence of an Akt inhibitor, wortmannin, we show that T\u03b24 had a decreased effect in protecting the heart from MI. These data suggest that the PIP complex and activation of Akt play critical roles in HF development. T\u03b24 treatment likely improves cardiac function by enhancing PIP mediated Akt activation and suppressing NF-\u03baB activation and collagen-mediated fibrosis.

{"title": "Restoring the physiology of vitamin D receptor activation and the concept of selectivity.", "abstract": "Abnormalities of bone mineral parameters (calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone) are nearly always present in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These typically consist of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, abnormalities of vitamin D metabolism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and are now defined as CKD mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD). Currently, emerging evidence indicates that deficiencies in vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation play crucial roles in adversely affecting the cardiovascular health of CKD patients. VDRs are not restricted to skeletal tissue, but are instead widely expressed throughout the body at several sites, such as in cardiac tissue, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, renal tissue, and cells of the immune system. Restoring the physiology and modulation of VDR activator levels results in correlative regulatory effects on mineral homeostasis, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and vascular calcification, as well as a number of other endpoints in cardiac and renal pathology. Among the compounds available for treatment of CKD-MBD, paricalcitol is a selective VDR activator. The term 'selective' refers to paricalcitol being more selective in affecting VDR pathways in the parathyroid gland compared with bone and intestine. As such, paricalcitol's selectivity allows for a wider therapeutic window with effects beyond parathyroid hormone control and mineral management, and may explain, in part, the increased survival advantage with paricalcitol treatment.", "journal": "Contributions to nephrology", "date": "2011-06-01", "authors": ["MarioCozzolino", "IreneBrenna", "ElisaVolpi", "PaolaCiceri", "FlorjanMehmeti", "DanieleCusi"], "doi": "10.1159/000327166"}

The data sets are then used to define a parameter space of these ratios, which is studied by considering the correlation coefficients between different epicardial potential distributions.

However, insufficient cell migration into the scaffolds used and inflammatory reactions due to scaffold biodegradation remain as issues to be addressed. Engineered heart tissue (EHT) grafts fabricated by means of a cell encapsulation technique provide cells with a tissue-like environment, thereby potentially enhancing cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation, and tissue regeneration. This paper presents a study on the fabrication and characterization of EHT grafts from novel alginate/collagen composite microbeads by means of cell encapsulation. Specifically, the microbeads were fabricated from alginate and collagen by barium ion cross-linking, with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes encapsulated in the composite microbeads during the fabrication of the EHT grafts. To evaluate the suitablity of these EHT grafts for heart muscle repair, the growth of cardiac cells in the microbeads was examined by means of confocal microscopy and staining with DAPI and F-actin. The EHT grafts were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and the contractile function of the EHT grafts monitored using a digital video camera at different time points. The results show the proliferation of cardiac cells in the microbeads and formation of interconnected multilayer heart-like tissues, the presence of well-organized and dense cell structures, the presence of intercalated discs and spaced Z lines, and the spontaneous synchronized contractility of EHT grafts (at a rate of 20-30 beats min(-1) after two weeks in culture).

We investigated FoxP1 interaction with Nfat3 (Nfatc4) and their effects on transcription of hypertrophy-associated genes in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. FoxP1-Nfat3 complexes were visualized using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis. Calcineurin activation induced FoxP1-Nfat3 BiFC complex formation. Amino acid substitutions in the predicted interaction interface inhibited it. FoxP1 repressed hypertrophy-associated genes (Myh7, Rcan1, Cx43, Anf, and Bnp) and counteracted their activation by constitutively nuclear Nfat3 (cnNfat3). In contrast, FoxP1 activated genes that maintain normal heart functions (Myh6 and p57Kip2) and cnNfat3 counteracted their activation by FoxP1. Amino acid substitutions in FoxP1 or cnNfat3 that inhibited their interaction abrogated the activation of hypertrophy-associated gene transcription by cnNfat3 and the repression of these genes by FoxP1. FoxP1 and Nfat3 co-occupied the promoter regions of hypertrophy-associated genes in neonatal and adult heart tissue.

The effects of BYHWD on hemorheological disorders and energy metabolism in CHD with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome are still unclear.\nTo investigate whether the ameliorative effects of BYHWD on CHD rats with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome are associated with the regulation of hemorheological disorders and energy metabolism.\nThe rats were lavaged with 25.68, 12.84 and 6.42 g/kg BYHWD (g weight of mixed crude drugs/kg body weight), respectively, once a day for 21 days. The body weight, exhaustive swimming time and tongue characters were observed and recorded. The whole blood viscosity and plasma viscosity were determined by hematology analyzer. The level of fibrinogen (Fbg) in plasma was determined by using Fbg assay kit. The platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphatase was measured by semi-automatic whole blood platelet analyzer. The level of blood glucose (BG) was determined by LifeScan. The activity of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in heart tissues was detected by spectrophotometer.\nBYHWD improved the exterior signs of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome in rats with CHD, including the body weight, exhaustive swimming time and tongue quality. The whole blood viscosity in rats treated with 25.68 g/kg BYHWD decreased at the shear rate of 10s(-1) (P<0.05) and the plasma viscosity decreased in rats treated with 25.68 and 12.84 g/kg BYHWD (P<0.05).

Adult male mice underwent 30 min of coronary artery ligation followed by reperfusion and were randomly assigned to receive clinical-grade AAT or albumin at reperfusion. Infarct size was evaluated after 1 and 7 days. Caspase-1 activity was measured in homogenates of heart tissue.

The effect of AAT on caspase-1 activity was determined in cultures of mouse HL-1 cardiomyocytes stimulated with LPS and triggered with nigericin or when HL-1 cells were exposed to simulated ischemia. AAT-treated mice had significantly smaller infarct sizes (-30% day 1 and -55% day 7) compared with mice treated with albumin.

The apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide L-4F is a putative anti-diabetic drug, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proprieties and improves endothelial function. In obese mice L-4F increases adiponectin levels, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing visceral adiposity. We hypothesized that the pleiotropic actions of L-4F can prevent heart and coronary dysfunction in a mouse model of genetically induced Type II diabetes. We treated db/db mice with either L-4F or vehicle for 8 weeks. Trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed; thereafter, isolated hearts were subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (IR). Glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1) were measured in plasma and HO-1, pAMPK, peNOS, iNOS, adiponectin, and superoxide in cardiac tissue. In db/db mice L-4F decreased accumulation of subcutaneous and total fat, and increased insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels while lowering inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.05). L-4F normalized in vivo left ventricular (LV) function of db/db mice, increasing (P < 0.05) fractional shortening and decreasing (P < 0.05) LV dimensions. In I/R experiments, L-4F prevented coronary microvascular resistance from increasing and LV function from deteriorating in the db/db mice. These changes were associated with increased cardiac expression of HO-1, pAMPK, peNOS, and adiponectin and decreased levels of superoxide and iNOS (P < 0.01). In the present study we showed that L-4F prevented myocardial and coronary functional abnormalities in db/db mice.

Furthermore, cyclic stress conditioning markedly increases cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (2.2-fold) and proliferation rates (21%) versus unconditioned constructs. Addition of endothelial cells enhances cardiomyocyte proliferation under all stress conditions (14% to 19%), and addition of stromal supporting cells enhances formation of vessel-like structures by \u224810-fold. Furthermore, these optimized human cardiac tissue constructs generate Starling curves, increasing their active force in response to increased resting length. When transplanted onto hearts of athymic rats, the human myocardium survives and forms grafts closely apposed to host myocardium. The grafts contain human microvessels that are perfused by the host coronary circulation.\nOur results indicate that both mechanical load and vascular cell coculture control cardiomyocyte proliferation, and that mechanical load further controls the hypertrophy and architecture of engineered human myocardium.

The properties of these materials are determined by the size and morphology, thus creating a fascinating line in their physicochemical properties. Polyaniline nanotubes (PANINTs) are one of the most promising nanobiomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering applications due to their electroactive properties. The biocompatibility and low hydrophilic properties of PANINTs can be improved by their functionalization with the highly hydrophilic polyglycerol dendrimers (PGLDs). Hydrophilicity plays a fundamental role in tissue regeneration and fundamental forces that govern the process of cell adhesion and proliferation. In this work, the biocompatible properties and cardiomyocyte proliferation onto PANINTs modified by PGLD are described. PGLDs were immobilized onto PANINTs via surface-initiated anionic ring-opening polymerization of glycidol. The microstructure and morphology of PGLD-PANINTs was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The cardiac cell growth on the PGLD-PANINTs was investigated. The PGLD-coated PANINTs showed noncytotoxic effects to Chinese hamster ovary cells. It was observed that the application of microcurrent stimulates the differentiation of cardiac cells cultured on PGLD-PANINTs scaffolds.

{"title": "A model of the physiological basis of a multivariate phenotype that is mediated by Ca(2+) signaling and controlled by ryanodine receptor composition.", "abstract": "Calcium-signals occur in a wide variety of tissue types - from skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle to pancreatic and brain tissues. Ca(2+) signals regulate diverse processes including muscle contraction, hormone secretion, neural communication and gene expression. Together these different tissues and processes form the basis of a multivariate trait. Calcium signals are characterized by Ca(2+) transients, which are sharp increases in Ca(2+) concentration over a short period of time. In this paper we derive and analyze a model of Ca(2+) transients for skeletal muscle, neurons and cardiac tissue based on underlying biophysical principles. Tissue differentiation in our model and in nature comes about by varying the ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel composition of tissues. In vertebrates, there are typically three types of RyR channels (labeled RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 in mammals and \u03b1-RyR, cardiac-RyR and \u03b2-RyR in birds, amphibians and fish). Different compositions of these three RyR channels generate different Ca(2+) transient properties. There are four Ca(2+) transient properties that we measure: maximum amplitude, duration, half duration (D(50)) and integrated concentration. In agreement with experimental work, our results find that the addition of RyR3 amplifies Ca(2+) transients in skeletal muscle.

The underlying genetic mechanism of HC has eluded researchers for decades. To further identify the potential molecular-genetic bases of HC, molecular analyses of HC hearts and hearts of age-matched controls were performed. Total RNA and genomic DNA were prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue from 12 cases of HC and 12 age-matched controls. To identify genes differentially expressed in HC, whole genome cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation profiling was performed. TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed changes in RNA expression. DNA copy number changes were measured by TaqMan copy number variant analysis. Analysis of differential gene expression in HC cases identified 2 significantly downregulated gene sets aligned sequentially along the genome. The 1st gene cluster consisted of genes S100A8 , S100A9 , and S100A12 at 1q21.3c, and the 2nd cluster consisted of genes IL1RL1 ( ST2 ), IL18R1 , and IL18RAP at 2q12.1a. Strong decreases in interleukin 33 expression were also observed. Decreases in copy number of the S100A genes were confirmed by TaqMan copy number variant assays. S100A genes are downstream of the p38-MAPK pathway that can be activated by interleukin 33 signaling. These data suggest a model in which the interleukin 33-IL1RL1/p38-MAPK/ S100A8-S100A9 axis is downregulated in HC cardiac tissue and provide several candidate genes on 1q21.3c and 2q12.1a for inherited mutations that may predispose individuals to HC.", "journal": "Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society", "date": "2011-05-19", "authors": ["Bahig MShehata", "MarkBouzyk", "Sarah CShulman", "WeiningTang", "Charlotte KSteelman", "Gigi KDavis", "Carlos SMoreno"], "doi": "10.2350/10-05-0826-OA.1"}

The targets of the altered miRNAs were predicted using the Sanger database. Then, the targets RASA1, RAC1, TGFB3 and COL1A1, related to cardiac hypertrophy or myocardial fibrosis, were selected to analyze the miRNA level by real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR).

Up-regulated (n=10) and down-regulated (n=6) miRNAs were identified in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Target genes (n=192) were pooled from the Sanger database. Among the 192 targets, the mRNA expression of RASA1, RAC1, TGFB3 and COL1A1 was increased in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Thirty one GO functions were enriched in diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Mathematically, these approaches employ Chapman-Kolmogorov equations coupled with partial differential equations. As the scale and complexity of such subcellular and cellular models increases, the balance between efficiency and accuracy of algorithms becomes critical. We have developed a novel two-stage splitting algorithm to address efficiency and accuracy issues arising in such modeling and simulation scenarios.

Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy analysis characterized the microstructure, chemistry, and crystallinity of the materials of interest to this study. The results show that PLGA:CNF materials are conductive and that the conductivity increases as greater amounts of CNF are added to PLGA, from 0 S m(-1) for pure PLGA (100:0 wt.%) to 5.5\u00d710(-3) S m(-1) for pure CNF (0:100 wt.%). The results also indicate that cardiomyocyte density increases with greater amounts of CNF in PLGA (up to 25:75 wt.% PLGA:CNF) for up to 5 days.

Development of a murine ECT would provide access to many existing models of cardiac disease and open the possibility of performing targeted genetic manipulation with the ability to directly assess contractile and molecular variables.\nTo generate, characterize, and validate mouse ECT with a physiologically relevant model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nWe generated mechanically integrated ECT using isolated neonatal mouse cardiac cells derived from both wild-type and myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C)-null mouse hearts. The murine ECTs produced consistent contractile forces that followed the Frank-Starling law and accepted physiological pacing. cMyBP-C-null ECTs showed characteristic acceleration of contraction kinetics. Adenovirus-mediated expression of human cMyBP-C in murine cMyBP-C-null ECT restored contractile properties to levels indistinguishable from those of wild-type ECT. Importantly, the cardiomyocytes used to construct the cMyBP-C(-/-) ECT had yet to undergo the significant hypertrophic remodeling that occurs in vivo. Thus, this murine ECT model reveals a contractile phenotype that is specific to the genetic mutation rather than to secondary remodeling events.\nData presented here show mouse ECT to be an efficient and cost-effective platform to study the primary effects of genetic manipulation on cardiac contractile function.

{"title": "Mitochondriocentric pathway to cardiomyocyte necrosis in aldosteronism: cardioprotective responses to carvedilol and nebivolol.", "abstract": "Foci of fibrosis, footprints of cardiomyocyte necrosis, are scattered throughout the failing myocardium and are a major component to its pathologic remodeling. Understanding pathogenic mechanisms contributing to hormone-mediated necrosis is therefore fundamental to developing cardioprotective strategies. In this context, a mitochondriocentric signal-transducer-effector pathway to necrosis is emerging. Our first objective, using cardiomyocytes and subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) harvested from rats receiving a 4-week aldosterone/salt treatment (ALDOST), was to identify the major components of this pathway. Second, to validate this pathway, we used mitochondria-targeted pharmaceutical interventions as cardioprotective strategies using 4-week cotreatment with either carvedilol (Carv) or nebivolol (Nebiv). Compared with controls, we found the 4-week ALDOST to be accompanied by elevated cardiomyocyte free [Ca(2+)]i and SSM free [Ca(2+)]m; increased H(2)O(2) production and 8-isoprostane in SSM, cardiac tissue, and plasma; and enhanced opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and myocardial scarring. Increments in the antioxidant capacity augmented by increased cytosolic free [Zn(2+)]i were overwhelmed. Cotreatment with either Carv or Nebiv attenuated [Ca(2+)]i and [Ca(2+)]m overloading, prevented oxidative stress, and reduced mPTP opening while augmenting [Zn(2+)]i and conferring cardioprotection. Thus, major components of the mitochondriocentric signal-transducer-effector pathway to cardiomyocyte necrosis seen with ALDOST include intracellular Ca overloading coupled to oxidative stress and mPTP opening.

Adenylate kinase (AK) and associated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) constitute a major metabolic signaling axis, yet the role of this system in guiding differentiation and lineage specification remains undefined.\nCardiac stem cell differentiation is the earliest event in organogenesis, and a suitable model of developmental bioenergetics. Molecular profiling of embryonic stem cells during cardiogenesis revealed here a distinct expression pattern of adenylate kinase and AMPK genes that encode the AK-AMP-AMPK metabolic surveillance axis. Cardiac differentiation upregulated cytosolic AK1 isoform, doubled AMP-generating adenylate kinase activity, and increased AMP/ATP ratio. At cell cycle initiation, AK1 translocated into the nucleus and associated with centromeres during energy-consuming metaphase. Concomitantly, the cardiac AMP-signal receptor AMPK\u03b12 was upregulated and redistributed to the nuclear compartment as signaling-competent phosphorylated p-AMPK\u03b1(Thr172).

The anti-neoplastic activity is accounted for by PS incorporation into cell membranes, resulting in the interference of membrane functionality. The similarity between the PS cholesterol-lowering and anti-neoplastic effective doses deserves attention on the possible adverse effects even in non-neoplastic cells. To date, few studies have addressed the clarification of this important issue. In the present study, we supplemented primary, non-neoplastic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with two different PS concentrations (3 or 6 \u03bcg/ml), both within the range of human plasma concentration. Cardiac cells were chosen as an experimental model since the heart has been reported as the target organ for subchronic toxicity of PS. Following supplementation, a dose-dependent incorporation of PS and a decrease in cholesterol content were clearly evidenced. PS did not induce apoptosis but caused a reduction in metabolic activity (measured as 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) conversion) and a slowing down of cell growth. The lower MTT conversion and the similar lactate dehydrogenase release could suggest that PS more efficiently target mitochondria than plasma membrane integrity. The replacement of cholesterol by PS could also have caused the observed slowing down of cell growth and the reduction in metabolic activity, which could rely on the PS increase, cholesterol decrease, or both.

Likewise, the 3h postdose BP of each week was significantly greater (p<0.001) than baseline BP only at 400mg/kg. However, when the weekly values were compared among themselves, the difference was not statistically significant and a progressive change in postdose BP had not been observed. On the other hand, predose systolic BP of K400 rats tended to decline at week 3 and significantly decreased (p<0.05) beyond week 4 compared to baseline values, but the decline was not significant for the rest of the doses. Biomarker assessments revealed that whereas levels of total creatine kinase were found to be elevated significantly for K100 (p<0.05), K200 and K400 (p<0.001 in both cases); aspartate aminotransferease was increased in K200 (p<0.01) and K400 (p<0.001) compared to CON rats.

Recent clinical trials have shown controversial results in recovering damaged cardiac tissue. New progress has shown that the underlying mechanisms of cell-based therapy relies more heavily on humoral and paracrine effects rather than on new tissue generation. However, studies have also reported the potential of new endothelial cell generation from BM cells. Thus, efforts have been made to identify cells having higher humoral or therapeutic effects as well as their surface markers.

Nonetheless, the decellularization protocols used to create acellular myocardial scaffolds vary widely throughout the literature. In this study we performed a direct comparison of three previously described protocols while introducing and evaluating a novel, specifically developed fourth protocol, by decellularizing whole rat hearts through software-controlled automatic coronary perfusion. Although all protocols preserved the macroarchitecture of the hearts and all resulting scaffolds could successfully be reseeded with C2C12 myoblasts, assessing their biocompatibility for three-dimensional in vitro studies, we found striking differences concerning the microcomposition of the ECM scaffolds on a histological and biochemical level. While laminin could still be detected in all groups, other crucial ECM components, like elastin and collagen IV, were completely removed by at least one of the protocols. Further, only three protocols maintained a glycosaminoglycan content comparable to native tissue, whereas the remaining DNA content within the ECM varied highly throughout all four tested protocols. This study showed that the degree of acellularity and resulting ECM composition of decellularized myocardial scaffolds strongly differs depending on the decellularization protocol.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Engineering cell platforms for myocardial regeneration.", "abstract": "Various engineered 'cell-platforms' have been reported in recent years for the possible treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) and end-stage heart failure. These engineered platforms rely on two key factors: cells and/or biomaterial scaffolds for the regeneration of the infarcted heart tissue.\nTwo major cell-platform approaches are described and broadly categorized as 'injectable cell platforms' and 'patch-based cell platforms'. The recent advancements in these cell-platforms in terms of their relative successes in-vivo as well as their clinical feasibility are summarized. Natural as well as synthetic scaffolds, with or without the cellular component, are compared with cell based therapy alone. This review focuses on achievements, as well as the gaps that are presently checking any progress towards producing clinically relevant panacea for myocardial regeneration.\nCardiac and induced pluripotent stem cells will probably be the focus of future research. The combined cell-biomaterial scaffold therapy is superior to cell therapy alone. Nevertheless, encouraging pre-clinical successes have limited translation into clinical practice due to limited cell survival post transplantation, inadequate construct thicknesses for human-sized hearts and the traditional use of 'flat (2D) tissue culture' techniques.

{"title": "Development of myocardial constructs using modulus-matched acrylated polypropylene glycol triol substrate and different nonmyocyte cell populations.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering approaches are currently being investigated for the restoration of myocardial function in heart failure patients, most commonly by combining cells with a substrate to form myocardial-like constructs (MCs). The final properties of these constructs are dependant on the characteristics of both the substrate and the cells used for fabrication. To create a construct with the appropriate mechanical properties required for any future therapeutic, we tailored an acrylated polypropylene glycol triol (aPPGT) substrate to the elastic modulus of heart tissue and then investigated the fabrication of MCs. We first assessed the aPPGT substrate alone in vivo, both under normal conditions and in an infarct model in mice, and found that there was a mild foreign body response with good integration of the substrate into the epicardial surface in mice hearts. We next studied the fabrication and properties of MCs by culturing mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes on the aPPGT substrate. To achieve myocardial-like concentrically contractile constructs, cocultures with supportive stromal cells were found to be essential and both mouse heart-derived stromal cells or bone-derived mouse mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells (mMSCs) could be used. These different stromal cell types produced MCs with different properties. The average beating rate of the constructs formed from mouse heart-derived stromal cells was significantly higher those constructs formed using mMSCs. Conversely, the constructs formed using mMSCs had reduced fibrotic extracellular matrix secretion and increased hepatocyte growth factor expression. Both of these mMSC construct properties may enhance integration and therapeutic efficacy of the construct postimplantation on the surface of the infarcted heart. This study thus demonstrates the formation of MCs using mechanically tailored aPPGT substrate and also demonstrates the effects of different stromal cell populations have on the properties of the resultant MCs, both of which are critical for future applications of tissue engineering in heart failure patients.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Use of a hanging weight system for coronary artery occlusion in mice.", "abstract": "Murine studies of acute injury are an area of intense investigation, as knockout mice for different genes are becoming increasingly available. Cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning (IP) remains an area of intense investigation. To further elucidate its molecular basis, the use of knockout mouse studies is particularly important. Despite the fact that previous studies have already successfully performed cardiac ischemia and reperfusion in mice, this model is technically very challenging. Particularly, visual identification of the coronary artery, placement of the suture around the vessel and coronary occlusion by tying off the vessel with a supported knot is technically difficult. In addition, re-opening the knot for intermittent reperfusion of the coronary artery during IP without causing surgical trauma adds additional challenge. Moreover, if the knot is not tied down strong enough, inadvertent reperfusion due to imperfect occlusion of the coronary may affect the results. In fact, this can easily occur due to the movement of the beating heart. Based on potential problems associated with using a knotted coronary occlusion system, we adopted a previously published model of chronic cardiomyopathy based on a hanging weight system for intermittent coronary artery occlusion during IP. In fact, coronary artery occlusion can thus be achieved without having to occlude the coronary by a knot. Moreover, reperfusion of the vessel can be easily achieved by supporting the hanging weights which are in a remote localization from cardiac tissues. We tested this system systematically, including variation of ischemia and reperfusion times, preconditioning regiments, body temperature and genetic backgrounds. In addition to infarct staining, we tested cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as a marker of myocardial infarction in this model. In fact, plasma levels of cTnI correlated with infarct sizes (R2=0.8). Finally, we could show in several studies that this technique yields highly reproducible infarct sizes during murine IP and myocardial infarction. Therefore, this technique may be helpful for researchers who pursue molecular mechanisms involved in cardioprotection by IP using a genetic approach in mice with targeted gene deletion. Further studies on cardiac IP using transgenic mice may consider this technique.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2011-05-05", "authors": ["TobiasEckle", "MichaelKoeppen", "HolgerEltzschig"], "doi": "10.3791/2526"}

It is hypothesized that a selective inhibitor of a specific HDAC class (or an isoform within that class) will provide a favorable therapeutic window for the treatment of heart failure, although the optimal selectivity profile for such a compound remains unknown. Genetic studies have suggested that class I HDACs promote pathological cardiac remodeling, while class IIa HDACs are protective. In contrast, nothing is known about the function or regulation of class IIb HDACs in the heart. We developed assays to quantify catalytic activity of distinct HDAC classes in left and right ventricular cardiac tissue from animal models of hypertensive heart disease. Class I and IIa HDAC activity was elevated in some but not all diseased tissues. In contrast, catalytic activity of the class IIb HDAC, HDAC6, was consistently increased in stressed myocardium, but not in a model of physiologic hypertrophy. HDAC6 catalytic activity was also induced by diverse extracellular stimuli in cultured cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts.

{"title": "Regional increase of extracellular potassium leads to electrical instability and reentry occurrence through the spatial heterogeneity of APD restitution.", "abstract": "The heterogeneities of electrophysiological properties of cardiac tissue are the main factors that control both arrhythmia induction and maintenance. Although the local increase of extracellular potassium ([K(+)](o)) due to coronary occlusion is a well-established metabolic response to acute ischemia, the role of local [K(+)](o) heterogeneity in phase 1a arrhythmias has yet to be determined. In this work, we created local [K(+)](o) heterogeneity and investigated its role in fast pacing response and arrhythmia induction. The left marginal vein of a Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart was cannulated and perfused separately with solutions containing 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mM of K(+). The fluorescence dye was utilized to map the voltage distribution. We tested stimulation rates, starting from 400 ms down to 120 ms, with steps of 5-50 ms. We found that local [K(+)](o) heterogeneity causes action potential (AP) alternans, 2:1 conduction block, and wave breaks. The effect of [K(+)](o) heterogeneity on electrical stability and vulnerability to arrhythmia induction was largest during regional perfusion with 10 mM of K(+). We detected three concurrent dynamics: normally propagating activation when excitation waves spread over tissue perfused with normal K(+), alternating 2:2 rhythm near the border of [K(+)](o) heterogeneity, and 2:1 aperiodicity when propagation was within the high [K(+)](o) area. [K(+)](o) elevation changed the AP duration (APD) restitution and shifted the restitution curve toward longer diastolic intervals and shorter APD.

Treatment of injuries with the carboxyl-terminal peptide was associated with an increase in phosphorylation at serine 368 of the Cx43 carboxyl-terminus. Here, we report that Cx43 peptide treatment of uninjured hearts does not prompt a similar increase in phosphorylation. Moreover, we show that peptide treatment of undisturbed cultured HeLa cells expressing a Cx43 construct also exhibit no changes in Cx43 phosphorylation at serine 368. However, in parallel with the results in vivo, a trend of increasing phosphorylation at serine 368 was observed in Cx43-expressing HeLa cells following scratch wounding of cultured monolayers.

Several genes essential for heart development have been identified. In recent years, there have been a few reports of the high frequency of somatic mutation in the heart tissues of CHD patients. The majority of findings were reported by the same investigators using formalin fixed tissues. In this study, we investigate the possibility of somatic mutation in fresh pathological cardiac tissues.\nWe sequenced all exons and their boundaries of the NKX2-5, GATA4 and HAND1 genes from the right ventricular outflow tract muscle and peripheral blood of 38 unrelated non-syndromic TOF children who had undergone routine surgery. The same group of genes was also sequenced in the peripheral blood of 105 control subjects. We also compared the DNA yield in different tissue storage methods and sequenced 10 formalin fixed specimens.\nSequencing cardiac muscle and peripheral blood from the same patient showed identical findings. The previously reported p.Pro407Gln mutation in GATA4 gene and a novel heterozygous p.Ala58Glu mutation in HAND1 gene were identified in two of the 38 patients, both in the affected cardiac tissues and in the lymphocytes. These mutations were not seen in any control subjects. The formalin fixation rendered less DNA yield than the frozen method, but no artificial mutations were generated.\nOur study shows no evidence of somatic NKX2-5, GATA4 and HAND1 mutations playing a role in the pathogenesis of TOF.

We also measured the effects of lipid, epinephrine, and the combination of the two on bupivacaine content in cardiac tissue.\nHearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats were excised and retrograde-perfused in a nonrecirculating Langendorff preparation.

However, the fluorescence signals, typically, have low SNRs and may be contaminated with motion artifact. In this report, we introduce a new processing approach for fluoresced transmembrane potentials (fTmps) that is based upon a discrete wavelet transform. We show how fTmp signals can be decomposed and reconstructed to form three subsignals that contain signal noise (noise signal), the early depolarization phase of the action potential (rTmp signal), and motion artifact (rMA signal). A coiflet4 wavelet is used for fTmp decomposition and reconstruction of these subsignals. Results using fTmp signals that are contaminated with motion artifact indicate that the approach is a useful processing step to remove baseline drift, reduce noise, and reveal wavefronts. It streamlines the preprocessing of fTmps for the subsequent measurement of activation times and conduction velocities.

Additionally, although tethering these factors provided long-term sequestration, tethering did not stimulate proteoglycan production.\nTethering growth factors to (KLDL)(3) results in long-term delivery, but tethering does not necessarily result in the same bioactivity as soluble delivery, indicating presentation of proteins is vital when considering a delivery strategy.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2011-04-20", "authors": ["Rachel EMiller", "Paul WKopesky", "Alan JGrodzinsky"], "doi": "10.1007/s11999-011-1891-1\n10.1016/1357-2725(96)00056-8\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(19980315)39:4<539::AID-JBM6>3.0.CO;2-K\n10.1006/excr.1993.1033\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.08.027\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.006\n10.1073/pnas.0602877103\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000153847.47301.80\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.09.021\n10.1038/nature02006\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0320\n10.3109/03008208209160269\n10.1302/0301-620X.84B2.11167\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.08.012\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B5.21832\n10.1002/elps.200410070\n10.1371/journal.pone.0000190\n10.1172/JCI25878\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2005.03.023\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.02.023\n10.1002/jbm.a.10168\n10.1016/S0142-9612(98)00203-8\n10.1016/0003-2697(88)90532-5\n10.1073/pnas.142309999\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0158\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0198\n10.1073/pnas.0807506106\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.03.016\n10.1089/ten.2006.0209\n10.1002/1529-0131(200007)43:7<1552::AID-ANR20>3.0.CO;2-W\n10.1073/pnas.0737381100\n10.1038/nbt818\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00196-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.05.061\n10.1002/art.27709\n10.1016/j.joca.2010.09.004\n10.1002/jor.1100170404\n10.1006/abbi.2000.2060\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.718718\n10.1016/j.actbio.2007.12.011\n10.1042/BST0290513\n10.1517/17425247.5.5.543\n10.1016/j.injury.2008.01.034\n10.1016/j.injury.2008.01.036\n10.1096/fj.07-100925\n10.1039/b807155a\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.76\n10.1073/pnas.90.8.3334"}

{"title": "The protective role of arjunolic acid against doxorubicin induced intracellular ROS dependent JNK-p38 and p53-mediated cardiac apoptosis.", "abstract": "In spite of tremendous demand for the development and implementation of effective therapeutic strategies, limitations are still associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Arjunolic acid (AA) has been shown to possess a multitude of biological functions. The purpose of the present study was to explore whether AA plays any protective role against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; and if so, what molecular mechanism it utilizes for its protective action. In rat cardiomyocytes, doxorubicin administration activated the proapoptotic p53, p38 and JNK MAPKs, Bax translocation, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, precipitated mitochondrion mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic signalling and reduced viability of cardiomyocytes. Doxorubicin exposure increases dichlorofluorescein (DCF) intensity corresponding to the intracellular H(2)O(2) generation in myocytes; catalase (CAT) treatment, however, reduced this intensity and preserves cell viability. Intracellular H(2)O(2) thus produced now activates the p38-JNK and p53-mediated pathways. CAT treatment also markedly decreased the doxorubicin-mediated activation of p38 and JNK, suggesting that H(2)O(2) is involved in the activation of MAPKs. Blockage of p53 and p38-JNK by pharmacological inhibitors also suppressed the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis with the concomitant inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. AA treatment ameliorates nearly all of these apoptotic actions of doxorubicin and preserves cell viability. Similarly, rats treated with doxorubicin displayed retarded growth of body and heart as well as elevated apoptotic indices in heart tissue, whereas AA treatment effectively neutralised all these doxorubicin-induced cardiac-abnormalities. Combining all, our results suggest that doxorubicin induces cardiac apoptosis via the activation of JNK-p38 and p53-mediated signalling pathways, where H(2)O(2) acts as the mediators of these pathways.

These are associated with the formation of spiral and scroll waves of electrical activation in cardiac tissue; single spiral and scroll waves are believed to be associated with VT whereas their turbulent analogs are associated with VF. Thus, the study of these waves is an important biophysical problem. We present a systematic study of the combined effects of muscle-fiber rotation and inhomogeneities on scroll-wave dynamics in the TNNP (ten Tusscher Noble Noble Panfilov) model for human cardiac tissue. In particular, we use the three-dimensional TNNP model with fiber rotation and consider both conduction and ionic inhomogeneities. We find that, in addition to displaying a sensitive dependence on the positions, sizes, and types of inhomogeneities, scroll-wave dynamics also depends delicately upon the degree of fiber rotation. We find that the tendency of scroll waves to anchor to cylindrical conduction inhomogeneities increases with the radius of the inhomogeneity. Furthermore, the filament of the scroll wave can exhibit drift or meandering, transmural bending, twisting, and break-up. If the scroll-wave filament exhibits weak meandering, then there is a fine balance between the anchoring of this wave at the inhomogeneity and a disruption of wave-pinning by fiber rotation. If this filament displays strong meandering, then again the anchoring is suppressed by fiber rotation; also, the scroll wave can be eliminated from most of the layers only to be regenerated by a seed wave. Ionic inhomogeneities can also lead to an anchoring of the scroll wave; scroll waves can now enter the region inside an ionic inhomogeneity and can display a coexistence of spatiotemporal chaos and quasi-periodic behavior in different parts of the simulation domain. We discuss the experimental implications of our study.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-04-13", "authors": ["RupamanjariMajumder", "Alok RanjanNayak", "RahulPandit"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0018052"}

During the healing process of inflammation, lymphangiogenesis is essential for reducing tissue edema. One potential responsible candidate for the induction of lymphangiogenesis in the healing process of acute KD is vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D).\nSequential changes in serum VEGF-D levels in patients with acute KD (n = 47) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were investigated. Cross-sectional areas of lymphatic vessels and VEGF-D protein expression were evaluated immunohistochemically in cardiac tissues of patients (n = 6) who died of KD. Regulation of VEGF-D messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cultured fibroblasts was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Serum VEGF-D levels increased after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in patients with acute KD (P < 0.001). In addition, they were significantly lower in patients with coronary artery lesions (CAL) than in those without CAL (P < 0.05). The cross-sectional areas of lymphatic vessels in cardiac tissues were enlarged in patients with acute KD. VEGF-D protein was detected on the endothelium of the enlarged lymphatic vessels. In vitro, tumor necrosis factor- significantly down-regulated VEGF-D mRNA expression in cultured fibroblasts (P = 0.004).\nThis study indicates that the production of VEGF-D increases and is related to lymphangiogenesis in patients with acute KD.

Aim of the study was the comparative analysis of cECM remodelling in tissue samples from right atrial auricle (RAA) and left ventricular septum (LVS). RAA and LVS specimens from 30 patients (17\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AVS; 13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AVS+CAD) were analysed with respect to histological changes and ECM remodelling using PCR based ECM gene expression profiling. Re-expression of ED-A(+) Fn and A1(+) Tn-C was investigated on the mRNA and on the protein level. For immunofluorescence, human recombinant small immunoprotein (SIP) format antibodies were used. There was a positive correlation of the grade of histological changes in RAA and corresponding LVS samples (r\u00a0=\u00a00.695). ECM gene expression levels were higher in LVS compared to RAA. For 24 genes, a corresponding relevant (>2.5-fold) up- or down-regulation in RAA and LVS occurred. Using SIP antibodies, a positive correlation of protein deposition levels in RAA and corresponding LVS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.818) could be shown for ED-A(+) Fn.

Exposure to TCE has been linked to increased risk for congenital heart malformations in both human and animal models. Previous studies showed TCE exposure reduced the expression and function of the ATP-dependent calcium pump, Serca2a, which is important for regulating calcium flux in myocytes and maintaining physiological cardiac function. In this study, we investigated whether TCE reduced Serca2a expression by altering the methylation status of its proximal promoter region. Low doses of TCE exposure (10\u00a0ppb) induced DNA hyper methylation in the Serca2 promoter region in cardiac myoblast cells and rat embryonic cardiac tissue. TCE exposure induced DNA methylation in a region of the Serca2 promoter which is the target for SP1 binding site essential for regulation of Serca2a transcriptional activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation data confirmed that TCE exposure reduced the binding of SP1 to the Serca2 promoter region adjacent to the methylated CpG dimer. Finally, low-dose TCE exposure reduced the concentration of S-adenosyl-methionine in exposed cells and embryos.

{"title": "p53 Regulates oxidative stress-mediated retrograde signaling: a novel mechanism for chemotherapy-induced cardiac injury.", "abstract": "The side effects of cancer therapy on normal tissues limit the success of therapy. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated for numerous chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin (DOX), a potent cancer chemotherapeutic drug. The production of ROS by DOX has been linked to DNA damage, nuclear translocation of p53, and mitochondrial injury; however, the causal relationship and molecular mechanisms underlying these events are unknown. The present study used wild-type (WT) and p53 homozygous knock-out (p53(-/-)) mice to investigate the role of p53 in the crosstalk between mitochondria and nucleus. Injecting mice with DOX (20 mg/kg) causes oxidative stress in cardiac tissue as demonstrated by immunogold analysis of the levels of 4-hydroxy-2'-nonenal (4HNE)-adducted protein, a lipid peroxidation product bound to proteins. 4HNE levels increased in both nuclei and mitochondria of WT DOX-treated mice but only in nuclei of DOX-treated p53((-/-)) mice, implicating a critical role for p53 in causing DOX-induced oxidative stress in mitochondria. The stress-activated protein c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNKs) was activated in response to increased 4HNE in WT mice but not p53((-/-)) mice receiving DOX treatment, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation of HNE and pJNK. The activation of JNK in DOX treated WT mice was accompanied by Bcl-2 dissociation from Beclin in mitochondria and induction of type II cell death (autophagic cell death), as evidenced by an increase in LC3-I/LC-3-II ratio and \u03b3-H2AX, a biomarker for DNA damage. The absence of p53 significantly reduces mitochondrial injury, assessed by quantitative morphology, and decline in cardiac function, assessed by left ventricular ejection fraction and fraction shortening.

{"title": "The zebrafish heart regenerates after cryoinjury-induced myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "In humans, myocardial infarction is characterized by irreversible loss of heart tissue, which becomes replaced with a fibrous scar. By contrast, teleost fish and urodele amphibians are capable of heart regeneration after a partial amputation. However, due to the lack of a suitable infarct model, it is not known how these animals respond to myocardial infarction.\nHere, we have established a heart infarct model in zebrafish using cryoinjury. In contrast to the common method of partial resection, cryoinjury results in massive cell death within 20% of the ventricular wall, similar to that observed in mammalian infarcts. As in mammals, the initial stages of the injury response include thrombosis, accumulation of fibroblasts and collagen deposition. However, at later stages, cardiac cells can enter the cell cycle and invade the infarct area in zebrafish. In the subsequent two months, fibrotic scar tissue is progressively eliminated by cell apoptosis and becomes replaced with a new myocardium, resulting in scarless regeneration. We show that tissue remodeling at the myocardial-infarct border zone is associated with accumulation of Vimentin-positive fibroblasts and with expression of an extracellular matrix protein Tenascin-C. Electrocardiogram analysis demonstrated that the reconstitution of the cardiac muscle leads to the restoration of the heart function.\nWe developed a new cryoinjury model to induce myocardial infarction in zebrafish. Although the initial stages following cryoinjury resemble typical healing in mammals, the zebrafish heart is capable of structural and functional regeneration.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester pretreatment normalized LPS-enhanced activities of serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in cardiac tissue. A significant reduction of the elevated levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) as well as serum and cardiac nitrite/nitrate (NOx) ) was achieved after CAPE pretreatment.

In vivo expression of pCMVe was 10-fold greater than pCMV and pMHC expression and continued over 30 days.

At 4 weeks after plasmid injection, we observed a 35.97 and 32.65% decline in fractional shortening (FS) in control (saline) animals and pMHC-hSDF1 animals, respectively, which was sustained to 8 weeks. In contrast, we observed a significant 24.97% increase in animals injected with the pCMVe-hSDF1 vector. Immunohistochemistry of cardiac tissue revealed a significant increase in vessel density in the hSDF-1-treated animals compared with control animals.

We investigated if treatment with benfotiamine can prevent diabetes-induced production of vasoactive factors and extracellular matrix proteins, and whether such effects are tissue-specific. We also examined whether effects of benfotiamine are mediated through a nuclear mechanism.\n\u2002 Retinal, renal and cardiac tissues from the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were examined after 4\u2003months of follow up. mRNA levels were quantified using real-time RT-PCR. Protein levels were quantified using western blot and ELISA. Cellular expressions of 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, a marker of nuclear DNA damage and Phospho-H2AX were also examined.\n\u2002 Diabetic animals showed hyperglycemia, glucosuria, increased urinary albumin/creatine ratio and loss of bodyweight.

Current multiparametric methods are technically challenging, usually involving multiple sensors and moving parts, which contributes to high logistic and economic thresholds that prevent easy application of the technique.\nThe purpose of this study was to develop a simple, affordable, and effective method for spatially resolved, continuous, simultaneous, and multiparametric optical mapping of the heart, using a single camera.\nWe present a new method to simultaneously monitor multiple parameters using inexpensive off-the-shelf electronic components and no moving parts. The system comprises a single camera, commercially available optical filters, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), integrated via microcontroller-based electronics for frame-accurate illumination of the tissue. For proof of principle, we illustrate measurement of four parameters, suitable for ratiometric mapping of membrane potential (di-4-ANBDQPQ) and intracellular free calcium (fura-2), in an isolated Langendorff-perfused rat heart during sinus rhythm and ectopy, induced by local electrical or mechanical stimulation.\nThe pilot application demonstrates suitability of this imaging approach for heart rhythm research in the isolated heart. In addition, locally induced excitation, whether stimulated electrically or mechanically, gives rise to similar ventricular propagation patterns.\nCombining an affordable camera with suitable optical filters and microprocessor-controlled LEDs, single-sensor multiparametric optical mapping can be practically implemented in a simple yet powerful configuration and applied to heart rhythm research. The moderate system complexity and component cost is destined to lower the threshold to broader application of functional imaging and to ease implementation of more complex optical mapping approaches, such as multiparametric panoramic imaging. A proof-of-principle application confirmed that although electrically and mechanically induced excitation occur by different mechanisms, their electrophysiologic consequences downstream from the point of activation are not dissimilar.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2011-04-05", "authors": ["PeterLee", "ChristianBollensdorff", "T AlexanderQuinn", "Joseph PWuskell", "Leslie MLoew", "PeterKohl"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.03.061"}

It is associated with serious dose-limiting cardiotoxicity, which is at least partly caused by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Supplementations with bilberries were effective in reducing oxidative stress in many tissue injuries due their high content of antioxidants. The present study investigated the potential protective effect of bilberry extract against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.\nRats were treated orally with a methanolic extract of bilberry for 10 days. DOX was injected intraperitoneally on day 7. Twenty-four hours after the last bilberry administration, rats were subjected to ECG study. Blood was then withdrawn and cardiac tissues were dissected for assessment of oxidative stress and cardiac tissue injury. Cardiac tissues were also subjected to histopathological examination.\nBilberry extract significantly inhibited DOX-provoked reduced glutathione depletion and accumulation of oxidized glutathione, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls in cardiac tissues. This was accompanied by significant amelioration of reduced cardiac catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities; and increased cardiac myeloperoxidase activity in response to DOX challenge. Pretreatment with bilberry significantly guarded against DOX-induced increase in serum activities of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase and creatine kinase-MB, as well as the level of troponin I. Bilberry alleviated ECG changes in rats treated with DOX and attenuated its pathological changes.\nBilberry protects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.

{"title": "Gender specific aspects of cell death in the cardiovascular system.", "abstract": "It has become apparent over the past few decades that several factors can determine lethal or sublethal alterations of cardiovascular system cell function such as inflammatory reaction products, peptides and hormones. In turn, the loss of cellular components from the blood vessels wall and the heart tissue contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Hence, in the recent years, the efforts of several research groups have specifically been devoted to deeply investigate the implication of the main forms of cell injury, necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy, in the development of cardiac and blood vessel alterations associated with human diseases. Furthermore, several lines of evidence demonstrate that CVD clearly display significant gender differences in terms of onset, progression and outcome. Cardiovascular cells contain functional estrogen and androgen receptors and are targets for sex hormone action, which can influence many physiological and pathological processes, including vascular and myocardial cell homeostasis. However, hormones are important but not unique actors in this issue, further genetic and epigenetic determinants being involved.

We and other groups previously reported that chemokine IP-10 was significantly induced in the heart tissue of CVB3-infected mice and contributed to the migration of massive inflammatory cells into the myocardium, which represents one of the most important mechanisms of viral myocarditis. To evaluate the direct effect of IP-10 on the inflammatory responses in CVB3 myocarditis, herein an IP-10 mutant deprived of chemo-attractant function was introduced into mice to antagonize the endogenous IP-10 activity, and its therapeutic effect on CVB3-induced myocarditis was evaluated.\nThe depletion mutant pIP-10-AT, with an additional methionine after removal of the 5 N-terminal amino acids, was genetically constructed and intramuscularly injected into BALB/c mice after CVB3 infection. Compared with vector or no treatment, pIP-10-AT treatment had significantly reduced heart/body weight ratio and serum CK-MB level, increased survival rate and improved heart histopathology, suggesting an ameliorated myocarditis. This therapeutic effect was not attributable to an enhanced viral clearance, but to a blunted Th1 immune response, as evidenced by significantly decreased splenic CD4(+)/CD8(+)IFN-\u03b3(+) T cell percentages and reduced myocardial Th1 cytokine levels.\nOur findings constitute the first preclinical data indicating that interfering in vivo IP-10 activity could ameliorate CVB3 induced myocarditis.

Despite its efficacy in cancer, clinical usage is limited because of its cardiotoxicity, which has been associated with oxidative stress and apoptosis. Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) have been shown to reduce the oxidative damage and apoptosis. The present study investigated the effects of CORM-2, a fast CO-releaser, against DXR-induced cardiotoxicity in mice using biochemical, histopathological and gene expression approaches. CORM-2 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 10 days and terminated the study on day 11. DXR (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected before 72 h of termination. Mice treated with DXR showed cardiotoxicity as evidenced by elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), caspase-3 and decrease the level of total antioxidant status (TAS) in heart tissues. Pre- and post-treatment with CORM-2 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) elicited significant improvement in CK, LDH, MDA, caspase-3 and TAS levels. Histopathological studies showed that cardiac damage with DXR has been reversed with CORM-2+DXR treatment. There was dramatic decrease in hematological count in DXR-treated mice, which has been improved with CORM-2. Furthermore, there was also elevation of mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor and decrease in inducible-nitric oxide synthase expression upon treatment with CORM-2 that might be linked to cardioprotection.

In this study, reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction, rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and mRNA real-time analysis were performed to characterize the ATGL gene in zebra finch and Java sparrow. Two cDNA of the zebra finch ATGL (zfATGL) gene were 1877 and 1626 bp were obtained; both encoded the same 481 amino acid protein. A 251 bp indel in the 3' UTR led to two variant transcripts.

As in chicken, both the zfATGL gene and its intron 1 were much longer than mammals, which seemed to be one characteristic of ATGL gene in birds. The zfATGL gene was predominantly expressed in abdominal fat, subcutaneous fat, breast muscle, and leg muscle in both male and female.

{"title": "Extensive scar formation and regression during heart regeneration after cryoinjury in zebrafish.", "abstract": "The zebrafish heart has the capacity to regenerate after ventricular resection. Although this regeneration model has proved useful for the elucidation of certain regeneration mechanisms, it is based on the removal of heart tissue rather than its damage. Here, we characterize the cellular response and regenerative capacity of the zebrafish heart after cryoinjury, an alternative procedure that more closely models the pathophysiological process undergone by the human heart after myocardial infarction (MI). Localized damage was induced in 25% of the ventricle by cryocauterization (CC). During the first 24 hours post-injury, CC leads to cardiomyocyte death within the injured area and the near coronary vasculature. Cell death is followed by a rapid proliferative response in endocardium, epicardium and myocardium. During the first 3 weeks post-injury cell debris was cleared and the injured area replaced by a massive scar. The fibrotic tissue was subsequently degraded and replaced by cardiac tissue. Although animals survived CC, their hearts showed nonhomogeneous ventricular contraction and had a thickened ventricular wall, suggesting that regeneration is associated with processes resembling mammalian ventricular remodeling after acute MI. Our results provide the first evidence that, like mammalian hearts, teleost hearts undergo massive fibrosis after cardiac damage. Unlike mammals, however, the fish heart can progressively eliminate the scar and regenerate the lost myocardium, indicating that scar formation is compatible with myocardial regeneration and the existence of endogenous mechanisms of scar regression.

The levels of phospho(p)-PI3kinase and p-Akt were measured in cardiac tissue by use of Western blot analysis.\nBoth p.o. and i.v. administration of miglitol reduced the infarct size, and this effect was greater after p.o. than after i.v. administration under similar plasma miglitol concentrations. The reduction in infarct size induced by p.o. miglitol but not that induced by i.v. miglitol was partially inhibited by treatment with exendin(9-39), a GLP-1 receptor blocker.

{"title": "Heparan sulfate/heparin promotes transthyretin fibrillization through selective binding to a basic motif in the protein.", "abstract": "Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric protein that transports thyroxine and retinol. Tetramer destabilization and misfolding of the released monomers result in TTR aggregation, leading to its deposition as amyloid primarily in the heart and peripheral nervous system. Over 100 mutations of TTR have been linked to familial forms of TTR amyloidosis. Considerable effort has been devoted to the study of TTR aggregation of these mutants, although the majority of TTR-related amyloidosis is represented by sporadic cases due to the aggregation and deposition of the otherwise stable wild-type (WT) protein. Heparan sulfate (HS) has been found as a pertinent component in a number of amyloid deposits, suggesting its participation in amyloidogenesis. This study aimed to investigate possible roles of HS in TTR aggregation. Examination of heart tissue from an elderly cardiomyopathic patient revealed substantial accumulation of HS associated with the TTR amyloid deposits. Studies demonstrated that heparin/HS promoted TTR fibrillization through selective interaction with a basic motif of TTR. The importance of HS for TTR fibrillization was illustrated in a cell model; TTR incubated with WT Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in fibrillization of the protein, but not with HS-deficient cells (pgsD-677). The effect of heparin on TTR fibril formation was further demonstrated in a Drosophila model that overexpresses TTR. Heparin was colocalized with TTR deposits in the head of the flies reared on heparin-supplemented medium, whereas no heparin was detected in the nontreated flies. Heparin of low molecular weight (Klexane) did not demonstrate this effect.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2011-03-23", "authors": ["FredrikNoborn", "PaulO'Callaghan", "ErikHermansson", "XiaoZhang", "John BAncsin", "Ana MDamas", "IngridDacklin", "JennyPresto", "JanJohansson", "Maria JSaraiva", "ErikLundgren", "RobertKisilevsky", "PerWestermark", "Jin-PingLi"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1101194108"}

The differential expression profiles of selected miRNAs (let-7i, miR-27a, miR-150, miR-126, miR-210, and miR-155) were analyzed in mouse brain and heart tissue by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). We identified three miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the brain of PbA-infected CBA mice: let7i, miR-27a, and miR-150. In contrast, no miRNA changes were detected in the heart, an organ with no known pathology during acute malaria. To investigate the involvement of let-7i, miR-27a, and miR-150 in CM-resistant mice, we assessed the expression levels in gamma interferon knockout (IFN-\u03b3(-/-)) mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background. The expression of let-7i, miR-27a, and miR-150 was unchanged in both wild-type (WT) and IFN-\u03b3(-/-) mice following infection.

Nogo-A is well characterized as a potent inhibitor of axonal regeneration and plasticity in the central nervous system, however, the role of Nogo-A in non-nervous tissues is essentially unknown. In this study, Nogo-A expression was shown to be significantly increased in cardiac tissue from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and from patients who have experienced an ischemic event. Nogo-A expression was clearly associated with cardiomyocytes in culture and was localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum. In agreement with the findings from human tissue, Nogo-A expression was significantly increased in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Knockdown of Nogo-A in cardiomyocytes markedly attenuated hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis, as indicated by the significant reduction of DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine translocation, and caspase-3 cleavage, by a mechanism involving the preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential, the inhibition of ROS accumulation, and the improvement of intracellular calcium regulation.

Patients with diabetes show dysfunction of CMs independent of myocardial infarction, indicating that diabetes directly affects CMs. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and developing a diabetic CM test-bed could enable drug screening studies specific to the diabetic heart. Diabetic cardiac conditions were mimicked by cultivating neonatal rat CMs seeded onto collagen scaffolds in normal or high glucose with or without insulin. Our results show that high glucose conditions, which mimic diabetic hearts, display poor electrical properties.

In the current work, we investigated whether cytokine responses in the blood, and antibody responses against recombinant T. gondii GRA1, GRA7, MIC3 proteins and a chimeric antigen EC2 encoding MIC2-MIC3-SAG1, are associated with the infectivity of porcine tissues after experimental infection with T. gondii. Two weeks after experimental infection of conventional 5-week-old seronegative pigs, an IFN-\u03b3 response was detected in the blood, with a kinetic profile that followed the magnitude of the GRA7 antibody response. Antibody responses to GRA1, MIC3 and EC2 were very weak or absent up to 6 weeks post infection. Antibodies against GRA7 occurred in all infected animals and were associated with the presence of the parasite in tissues at euthanasia a few months later, as demonstrated by quantitative real-time PCR and isolation by bio-assay. Remarkably, although brain and heart tissue remained infectious, musculus gastrocnemius and musculus longissimus dorsi were found clear of infectious parasites 6 months after experimental infection. Seropositive response in a GRA7 ELISA indicates a Toxoplasma infection in pigs and is predictive of the presence of infectious cysts in pig heart and brain.

Here, we report the identification of a double-stranded RNA virus likely belonging to the family Totiviridae as the causative agent of the disease. The proposed name of the virus is piscine myocarditis virus (PMCV). On the basis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence, PMCV grouped with Giardia lamblia virus and infectious myonecrosis virus of penaeid shrimp. The genome size of PMCV is 6,688 bp, with three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 likely encodes the major capsid protein, while ORF2 encodes the RdRp, possibly expressed as a fusion protein with the ORF1 product. ORF3 seems to be translated as a separate protein not described for any previous members of the family Totiviridae. Following experimental challenge with cell culture-grown virus, histopathological changes are observed in heart tissue by 6 weeks postchallenge (p.c.), with peak severity by 9 weeks p.c.

Several autoantigens have been identified, including cardiac myosin epitopes, vimentin, and other intracellular proteins. In heart tissue, antigen-driven oligoclonal T cell expansions probably cause the rheumatic heart lesions. These cells are CD4+ and produce inflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha and IFN gamma). IL-4+ cells are found in the myocardium; however, these cells are very scarce in the valve lesions of RHD patients. IL-4 is a Th2-type cytokine and plays a regulatory role in the inflammatory response mediated by Th1 cytokines.

We tested the hypothesis that application of pGz 30 min after return of circulation from CA, as a delayed post-treatment strategy, would improve regional microcirculatory blood flow to vital organs and functional indices of myocardial stunning in pigs.\n8 min of unsupported VF followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation was carried out in twenty anesthetized and paralyzed male swine who were randomized to delayed post-treatment with pGz (dPost) or none (CONT). pGz was begun 30 min after return of circulation along with conventional mechanical ventilation. Hemodynamics, echocardiogram, and regional blood flows were measured as well as biochemical index of cardiac tissue injury.\nAll animals had spontaneous return of circulation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. dPost animals had less myocardial stunning and greater regional blood flows to the heart, brain, kidneys, ileum and stomach than CONT. Post-treatment with pGz blunted the increase in Troponin I produced by CA and resuscitation, and, induced a greater rise in endothelial derived nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and its phosphorylation (p-eNOS).\nDelayed post-treatment with pGz as a therapeutic strategy, protects against early myocardial stunning in VF cardiac arrest by improving microcirculatory blood flow to the heart and also protects other vital organs by this mechanism.", "journal": "Resuscitation", "date": "2011-03-12", "authors": ["Jose AAdams", "ArkadyUryash", "HengWu", "Jorge ABassuk", "VinayNadkarni", "RobertBerg", "VinodJorapur", "PaulKurlansky"], "doi": "10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.02.012"}

{"title": "Determining the in vivo regulation of cardiac pyruvate dehydrogenase based on label flux from hyperpolarised [1-13C]pyruvate.", "abstract": "Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a key regulator of cardiac substrate selection and is regulated by both pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated phosphorylation and feedback inhibition. The extent to which chronic upregulation of PDK protein levels, acutely increased PDK activity and acute feedback inhibition limit PDH flux remains unclear because existing in vitro assessment methods inherently disrupt the regulation of the enzyme complex. We have demonstrated previously that hyperpolarised (13)C-labelled metabolic tracers coupled with MRS can monitor flux through PDH in vivo. The aim of this study was to determine the relative contributions of acute and chronic changes in PDK and PDH activities to in vivo myocardial PDH flux. We examined both fed and fasted rats with either hyperpolarised [1-(13)C]pyruvate alone or hyperpolarised [1-(13)C]pyruvate co-infused with malate [to modulate mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD(+)) and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)/CoA ratios, which alter both PDH activity and flux]. To confirm the metabolic fate of infused malate, we performed in vitro (1)H NMR spectroscopy on cardiac tissue extracts. We observed that, in fed rats, where PDH activity was high, the presence of malate increased PDH flux by 27%, whereas, in the fasted state, malate infusion had no effect on PDH flux. These observations suggest that pyruvate oxidation is limited by feedback inhibition from acetyl-CoA only when PDH activity is high. Therefore, in the case of PDH, and potentially other enzymes, hyperpolarised (13)C MRI can be used to assess noninvasively enzymatic regulation.", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "date": "2011-03-10", "authors": ["Marie ASchroeder", "Helen JAtherton", "Lisa CHeather", "Julian LGriffin", "KieranClarke", "George KRadda", "Damian JTyler"], "doi": "10.1002/nbm.1668"}

Male Wistar rats were treated orally with ellagic acid (7.5 and 15mg/kg) daily for a period of 10 days. After 10 days of pretreatment, isoproterenol (100mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously to rats at an interval of 24h for 2 days to induce myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol administered rats showed significant changes in the electrocardiogram pattern, arterial pressure, and heart rate. Isoproterenol-induced rats also showed significant (P<0.05) increase in the levels of serum troponin-I, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, plasma homocysteine, heart tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid hydro peroxides. The activities/levels of antioxidant system were decreased in isoproterenol-induced rats. The histopathological findings of the myocardial tissue evidenced myocardial damage in isoproterenol induced rats. The oral pretreatment of ellagic acid restored the pathological electrocardiographic patterns, regulated the arterial blood pressures and heart rate in the isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats. The ellagic acid pretreatment significantly reduced the levels of biochemical markers, lipid peroxidation and significantly increased the activities/levels of the antioxidant system in the isoproterenol induced rats.

This report describes examples of coronary vascular disease occurring in transplanted mouse hearts involving isolated, non-H2-determined incompatibilities.\nMice, incompatible in respect of HY, H4, or H60, were selected. For H60, the incompatibility depended on breeding congenic pairs or the introduction of H60 by transgenic methods because the latter method results in more widespread expression. Transplant survival was determined, and the appearance and prevalence of coronary artery vasculopathy (CAV) was established by appropriate histologic methods.\nAdvanced changes of CAV were found at 56 days in transplants involving incompatibilities confined to HY or H4. In both combinations, skin grafts were also rejected. H60 incompatibility does not result in skin graft rejection and only a minority of heart transplants shows evidence of CAV. If heart transplants are preceded by skin grafts bearing both H60 and HY incompatibilities to promote \"help\" in generating immunity, H60 incompatible hearts develop advanced CAV. Heart transplants in all non-MHC categories ostensibly survive in excellent condition throughout this period despite their CAV.\nCAV can develop as a consequence of non-MHC incompatibilities alone and even when antigens are sparsely expressed on cardiac tissue. Presensitization leads to much more severe vascular disease.

{"title": "Optimizing PANi doped electroactive substrates as patches for the regeneration of cardiac muscle.", "abstract": "In scaffold aided regeneration of muscular tissue, composite materials are currently utilized as a temporary substrate to stimulate tissue formation by controlled electrochemical signals as well as continuous mechanical stimulation until the regeneration processes are completed. Among them, composites from the blending of conductive (CPs) and biocompatible polymers are powerfully emerging as a successful strategy for the regeneration of myocardium due to their unique conductive and biological recognition properties able to assure a more efficient electroactive stimulation of cells. Here, different composite substrates made of synthesized polyaniline (sPANi) and polycaprolactone (PCL) were investigated as platforms for cardiac tissue regeneration. Preliminary, a comparative analysis of substrates conductivity performed on casted films endowed with synthesized polyaniline (sPANi) short fibres or blended with emeraldine base polyaniline (EBPANi) allows to study the attitude of charge transport, depending on the conducting filler amount, shape and spatial distribution. In particular, conducibility tests indicated that sPANi short fibres provide a more efficient transfer of electric signal due to the spatial organization of electroactive needle-like phases up to form a percolative network. On the basis of this characterization, sPANi/PCL electrospun membranes have been also optimized to mimic either the morphological and functional features of the cardiac muscle ECM. The presence of sPANi does not relevantly affect the fibre architecture as confirmed by SEM/image analysis investigation which shows a broader distribution of fibres with only a slight reduction of the average fibre diameter from 7.1 to 6.4 \u03bcm. Meanwhile, biological assays--evaluation of cell survival rate by MTT assay and immunostaining of sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin of cardiomyocites-like cells--clearly indicate that conductive signals offered by PANi needles, promote the cardiogenic differentiation of hMSC into cardiomyocite-like cells.

Anesthetized rats were subjected to 45 min of ischemia and 5h of reperfusion. Infarcted area, serum creatine kinase, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity were determined. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was also investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Intravenous administration of DAA-I at 5 min post reperfusion reduced myocardial infarct size by 45.5%, lowered serum creatine kinase activity, decreased myeloperoxidase activity in cardiac tissue, and inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 in cardiac capillary endothelium. The maximum effective dose was 1013 pmol/kg, and the cardioprotective actions of DAA-I were blocked by indomethacin. The data showed that the cardioprotection accorded by DAA-I was the result of its anti-inflammatory actions on early inflammatory processes in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. The anti-inflammatory processes were indomethacin sensitive and probably mediated by prostaglandins.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2011-03-05", "authors": ["QiangWen", "Meng-KwoonSim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.02.014"}

Excessive transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 contributes to a pathologic excess of tissue fibrosis. We investigated the effect of astragaloside IV on myocardial fibrosis in CVB3-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. BALB/c mice were inoculated with CVB3 to induce acute viral myocarditis on day 7 (acute VMC group), monthly for 3 months to induce chronic myocarditis (chronic VMC group), and monthly for 9 months to induce dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM group). The same method was used for the DCM+Astra group as that of the DCM group, but former group was given with astragaloside IV-containing drinking water. Compared to DCM group, astragaloside IV treatment significantly increased the survival rate. Histological findings and the collagen volume fraction showed that astragaloside IV decreased fibrosis in heart tissues. Astragaloside IV decreased the level of the serum carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (PICP) and the ratio of PICP/ N-terminal type I procollagen propeptide (PINP). Ameliorated myocardial fibrosis was consistent with the downregulated expression of TGF-\u03b21 and its downstream pSmad2/3 and Smad4 in the myocardium of the DCM+Astra group compared to the DCM group. The level of type I collagen was lower in the DCM+Astra group than the DCM group. The same effect was found in the in vitro study. These findings showed that astragaloside IV had a potent preventive effect on myocardial fibrosis in CVB3-induced dilated cardiomyopathy that might be due to downregulation of TGF-\u03b21-Smad signaling.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2011-03-05", "authors": ["PingChen", "YeqingXie", "EShen", "Gary GLi", "YongYu", "Cassie BZhang", "YingzhenYang", "YunzengZou", "JunboGe", "RuizhenChen", "HaozhuChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.02.040"}

Recent published reports have contributed to identifying possible cellular therapy approaches to generate new myocardium, involving transcoronary and intramyocardial injection of progenitor cells. However, one of the limiting factors in the overall interpretation of clinical results obtained by cell therapy is represented by the lack of three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution methods for the visualization of the injected cells and their fate within the myocardium. This work shows that X-ray computed microtomography may offer the unique possibility of detecting, with high definition and resolution and in ex vivo conditions, the 3D spatial distribution of rat cardiac progenitor cells, labelled with iron oxide nanoparticles, inside the infarcted rat heart early after injection. The obtained 3D images represent a very innovative progress as compared to experimental two-dimensional (2D) histological analysis, which requires time-consuming energies for image reconstruction in order to provide the overall distribution of rat clonogenic cells within the heart. Through microtomography, we were able to observe in 3D the presence of these cells within damaged cardiac tissue, with important structural details that are difficult to visualize by conventional bidimensional imaging techniques. This new 3D-imaging approach appears to be an important way to investigate the cellular events involved in cardiac regeneration and represents a promising tool for future clinical applications.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-03-02", "authors": ["AlessandraGiuliani", "CaterinaFrati", "AlessandraRossini", "Vladimir SKomlev", "CostanzaLagrasta", "MoniaSavi", "StefanoCavalli", "CarloGaetano", "FedericoQuaini", "AdrianManescu", "FrancoRustichelli"], "doi": "10.1002/term.409"}

{"title": "A mathematical model of spontaneous calcium release in cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "In cardiac myocytes, calcium (Ca) can be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum independently of Ca influx from voltage-dependent membrane channels. This efflux of Ca, referred to as spontaneous Ca release (SCR), is due to Ryanodine receptor fluctuations, which can induce spontaneous Ca sparks, which propagate to form Ca waves. This release of Ca can then induce delayed after-depolarizations (DADs), which can lead to arrhythmogenic-triggered activity in the heart. However, despite its importance, to date there is no mathematical model of SCR that accounts for experimentally observed features of subcellular Ca. In this article, we present an experimentally based model of SCR that reproduces the timing distribution of spontaneous Ca sparks and key features of the propagation of Ca waves emanating from these spontaneous sparks. We have coupled this model to an ionic model for the rabbit ventricular action potential to simulate SCR within several thousand cells in cardiac tissue.

In this study, we used an ionic model of canine ventricular myocytes (CVM) to investigate the effect of calcium release from the sacroplasm reticulum (SR), as well as the effect of L-type calcium current, on cardiac short-term memory. We calculated short-term memory response by testing the time to reach steady-state APD after an abrupt shortening of basic cycling length (BCL) in pacing protocol. Our results indicated that as the release of calcium from SR was gradually prevented, short-term memory response decreased, while the blockade of L-type calcium channel had little effect on short-term memory.

Despite enhanced recruitment of endogenous CPCs, lack of functional improvement in CPCeA-treated hearts demonstrates CPC lineage commitment is essential to the regenerative response.

The aim of our study was to explore the role of the Ub pathway in heart muscle physiology.\nWe treated rats for three days with a pharmacologic dose of dexamethasone (DEXA) 0.5mg/100g body weight (BW). An attempt was also made to counteract the DEXA effect by co-treatment with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; 0.35 mg/100g BW).\nDEXA treatment caused a 7.8% decrease in heart weight compared to control (p<0.05) and also increased heart tissue levels of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 and the 20S proteasome protein. Myofibrillar proteins degraded by the ubiquitin pathway (\u03b1-actin, myoglobin, and troponin 1) were all decreased by DEXA, while ubiquitinated forms of \u03b1-actin were increased. Co-treatment with IGF-1 completely prevented DEXA-induced decrease in heart weight, an effect which was accompanied by decreased heart tissue levels of several ubiquitinated proteins including \u03b1-actin, the 20S proteasome protein, E2-14 kDa mRNA, and C-3 proteasome subunit mRNA, while the levels of non-ubiquinated \u03b1-actin, myoglobin, and troponin 1 were all partially restored.\nThese results demonstrate that DEXA activates the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway in the heart and that IGF-1 efficiently counteracts this effect.

Accordingly, we evaluated SPL inhibition as a strategy for reducing cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. We measured SPL expression and enzyme activity in murine hearts. Basal SPL activity was low in wild-type cardiac tissue but was activated in response to 50 min of ischemia (n = 5, P < 0.01). Hearts of heterozygous SPL knockout mice exhibited reduced SPL activity, elevated S1P levels, smaller infarct size, and increased functional recovery after I/R compared with littermate controls (n = 5, P < 0.01). The small molecule tetrahydroxybutylimidazole (THI) is a Federal Drug Administration-approved food additive that inhibits SPL. When given overnight at 25 mg/l in drinking water, THI raised S1P levels and reduced SPL activity (n = 5, P < 0.01). THI reduced infarct size and enhanced hemodynamic recovery in response to 50 min of ischemia and to 40 min of reperfusion in ex vivo hearts (n = 7, P < .01).

Trypanosoma cruzi group I is associated with chagasic cardiomyopathy in Colombia and other countries in northern South America. However, in southern South America, T cruzi group II predominates and is associated with cardiomyopathy and digestive forms of the disease. The aim of this work was to determine the correlation between the genetic profiles of T cruzi groups circulating in the biological cycle and those present in tissues from patients with Chagas disease. We genotyped T cruzi in 10 heart tissue samples from patients with cardiomyopathy from a highly endemic area of Colombia. The genotyping was performed using nuclear and mitochondrial genes and low-stringency single-specific primer polymerase chain reaction. As expected, the predominant genetic group was T cruzi group I; however, we also detected T cruzi group II. Microsatellite analyses suggested a predominance of monoclonal populations, and sequence alignments showed similarities with Colombian strains.

{"title": "Hierarchical architecture influences calcium dynamics in engineered cardiac muscle.", "abstract": "Changes in myocyte cell shape and tissue structure are concurrent with changes in electromechanical function in both the developing and diseased heart. While the anisotropic architecture of cardiac tissue is known to influence the propagation of the action potential, the influence of tissue architecture and its potential role in regulating excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) are less well defined. We hypothesized that changes in the shape and the orientation of cardiac myocytes induced by spatial arrangement of the extracellular matrix (ECM) affects ECC. To test this hypothesis, we isolated and cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes on various micropatterns of fibronectin where they self-organized into tissues with varying degrees of anisotropy. We then measured the morphological features of these engineered myocardial tissues across several hierarchical dimensions by measuring cellular aspect ratio, myocyte area, nuclear density and the degree of cytoskeletal F-actin alignment. We found that when compared with isotropic tissues, anisotropic tissues have increased cellular aspect ratios, increased nuclear densities, decreased myocyte cell areas and smaller variances in actin alignment. To understand how tissue architecture influences cardiac function, we studied the role of anisotropy on intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) dynamics by characterizing the [Ca(2+)](i)-frequency relationship of electrically paced tissues. When compared with isotropic tissues, anisotropic tissues displayed significant differences in [Ca(2+)](i) transients, decreased diastolic baseline [Ca(2+)](i) levels and greater [Ca(2+)](i) influx per cardiac cycle. These results suggest that ECM cues influence tissue structure at cellular and subcellular levels and regulate ECC.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2011-02-19", "authors": ["TerrencePong", "William JAdams", "Mark-AnthonyBray", "Adam WFeinberg", "Sean PSheehy", "Andreas AWerdich", "Kevin KitParker"], "doi": "10.1258/ebm.2010.010239"}

Our results demonstrated that TPO treatment led to significant improvements of fractional shortening, cardiac output, and morphologic parameters in both models. In the acute-DOX model, microarray and network analyses showed that DOX damage was associated with changes in a large cohort of gene expressions, of which many were inversely regulated by TPO, including modulators of signal transduction, ion transport, anti-apoptosis, protein kinase B/ p42/p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (AKT/ERK) pathways, cell division, and contractile protein/matrix remodelling. Many of these regulations also occurred in chronic-DOX animals, in which TPO treatment reduced morphological damage and cardiomyopathy score, and increased AKT phosphorylation of heart tissues. Thrombopoietin also increased EPC colonies in their bone marrow.\nOur overall data suggest that TPO promotes cardiac protection from acute- and chronic-DOX insults, possibly mediated by multi-factorial mechanisms including AKT- and ERK-associated restoration of regulatory gene activities critical for normal heart function.", "journal": "European journal of heart failure", "date": "2011-02-19", "authors": ["Kathy Yuen-YeeChan", "PingXiang", "LigangZhou", "KarenLi", "Pak-CheungNg", "Chi-ChiuWang", "LeiZhang", "Hai-YanDeng", "Nga-HinPong", "HailuZhao", "Wood-YeeChan", "Rita Yn-TzSung"], "doi": "10.1093/eurjhf/hfr001"}

Better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate cardiac repair should help to improve the clinical outcome of MI patients. Using the reporter mouse line TOPGAL, we show that canonical (\u03b2-catenin-dependent) Wnt signaling is induced 4 days after experimental MI in subepicardial endothelial cells and perivascular smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive (SMA(+)) cells. At 1 week after ischemic injury, a large number of canonical-Wnt-positive cells accumulated in the infarct area during granulation tissue formation. Coincidently with canonical Wnt activation, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was also triggered after MI. Using cell lineage tracing, we show that a significant portion of the canonical-Wnt-marked SMA(+) mesenchymal cells is derived from endothelial cells. Canonical Wnt signaling induces mesenchymal characteristics in cultured endothelial cells, suggesting a direct role in EndMT. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that canonical Wnt activation and EndMT are molecular and cellular responses to MI and that canonical Wnt signaling activity is a characteristic property of EndMT-derived mesenchymal cells that take part in cardiac tissue repair after MI.

{"title": "Toward prediction of the local onset of alternans in the heart.", "abstract": "A beat-to-beat variation in the cardiac action potential duration is a phenomenon known as alternans. Alternans has been linked to ventricular fibrillation, and thus the ability to predict the onset of alternans could be clinically beneficial. Theoretically, it has been proposed that the slope of a restitution curve, which relates the duration of the action potential to the preceding diastolic interval, can predict the onset of alternans. Experimentally, however, this hypothesis has not been consistently proven, mainly because of the intrinsic complexity of the dynamics of cardiac tissue. It was recently shown that the restitution portrait, which combines several restitution curves simultaneously, is associated with the onset of alternans in isolated myocytes. Our main purpose in this study was to determine whether the restitution portrait is correlated with the onset of alternans in the heart, where the dynamics include a spatial complexity. We performed optical mapping experiments in isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts in which alternans was induced by periodic pacing at different frequencies, and identified the local onset of alternans, B(onset). We identified two regions of the heart: the area that exhibited alternans at B(onset) (1:1(alt)) and the area that did not (1:1). We constructed two-dimensional restitution portraits for the epicardial surface of the heart and measured the spatial distribution of three different slopes (the dynamic restitution slope, S(dyn)(RP), and two local S1-S2 slopes, S(12) and S(12)(max)) separately for these two regions. We found that the S(12) and S(12)(max) slopes differed significantly between the 1:1(alt) and 1:1 regions just before the onset of alternans, and S(dyn)(RP) slopes were statistically similar. In addition, we found that the slopes of the dynamic restitution curve S(dyn) were also statistically similar between these two regions. On the other hand, the quantitative values of all slopes were significantly different from the theoretically predicted value of one. These results demonstrate that the slopes measured in the restitution portrait correlate with the onset of alternans in the heart.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2011-02-16", "authors": ["Alexander RCram", "Hrishikesh MRao", "Elena GTolkacheva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2011.01.009"}

TRP channels play a role in mediating Ca(2+) overload in the heart. Calcium-sensing receptors (CaR) are also expressed in rat cardiac tissue and promote the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by Ca(2+) overload. However, data about the link between CaR and TRP channels in rat heart are few. In this study, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to examine the expression of the TRP canonical proteins TRPC1 and TRPC3 in adult and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Laser scan confocal microscopy was used to detect intracellular [Ca(2+)](i) levels in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes. The results showed that, in adult rat cardiomyocytes, the depletion of Ca(2+) stores in the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) by thapsigargin induced a transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in the absence of [Ca(2+)](o) and the subsequent restoration of [Ca(2+)](o) sustained the increased [Ca(2+)](i) for a few minutes, whereas, the persisting elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) was reduced in the presence of the TRPC inhibitor SKF96365. The stimulation of CaR by its activator gadolinium chloride (GdCl(3)) or spermine also resulted in the same effect and the duration of [Ca(2+)](i) increase was also shortened in the absence of [Ca(2+)](o).

Previously, we and others have shown that E3 ligase-mediated protein turnover plays a critical role in cardiac injury. In this study, we sought to determine the role of a newly identified E3 ligase, neuregulin receptor degradation protein-1 (Nrdp1), on cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. I/R injury markedly upregulated Nrdp1 expression in heart tissue. To elucidate the role of Nrdp1 in I/R-induced cardiac injury, neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with adenoviral constructs expressing wild-type, dominant-negative Nrdp1 genes. Increased Nrdp1 expression enhanced I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation as compared with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) control; these effects were attenuated by overexpression of a dominant-negative Nrdp1 (C34S/H36Q). Furthermore, cardiac-specific Nrdp1 overexpression in vivo in mouse significantly increased infarct size, the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei and inflammatory cells, as well as mortality, as compared with wild-type mice after I/R injury. The mechanisms underlying these effects were associated with the downregulation of an Nrdp1 substrate, ErbB3, accompanied by suppression of its downstream targets AKT, ERK1/2, and activation of p38 and JNK1/2.

In the present study, CCAP resulted in a dose-dependent increase in heart rate and hemolymph flow velocity, or cardiac output, in B. extradentatum. In contrast, CCAP led to a significant increase in stroke volume and cardiac output in L. migratoria without modifying heart rate or aortic contraction frequency. Hemolymph flow through the excurrent ostia of L. migratoria, small openings or valves on the posterior aorta and anterior heart, was inhibited with increasing concentrations of CCAP, with complete inhibition seen at 10(-7) M CCAP. In the locust, CCAP increases the volume of hemolymph in the dorsal vessel by the synchronous closing of the excurrent ostia, resulting in more forceful heart contractions and increased stroke volume and cardiac output, without modifying heart rate through a physiological mechanism analogous to the Frank-Starling mechanism in vertebrates.

Male rats were administered doxorubicin. Hearts were collected 3 weeks after the last dose of doxorubicin and were analyzed. Doxorubicin administration retarded the growth of the body and the heart and caused injury in the cardiac tissue because of increased oxidative stress. Similar experiments with doxorubicin showed reduced cell viability, increased ROS generation, intracellular Ca(2+) and DNA fragmentation, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic cell death in primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Signal transduction studies showed that doxorubicin increased p53, JNK, p38 and NF\u03baB phosphorylation; decreased the levels of phospho ERK and Akt; disturbed the Bcl-2 family protein balance; activated caspase 12, caspase 9 and caspase 3; and induced cleavage of the PARP protein. However, taurine treatment or cardiomyocyte incubation with taurine suppressed all of the adverse effects of doxorubicin. Studies with several inhibitors, including PS-1145 (an IKK inhibitor), SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3-K/Akt inhibitor), demonstrated that the mechanism of taurine-induced cardio protection involves activation of specific survival signals and PI3-K/Akt as well as the inhibition of p53, JNK, p38 and NF\u03baB.

Histopathological lesions typical of pancreas disease were observed with all subtypes, and virus was re-isolated from serum of cohabitant fish in each case. Using a virus neutralization (VN) test neutralizing salmonid alphavirus (SAV) subtype 1 strain F93-125, VN antibodies were detected in all challenge groups, consistent with serological cross-reactivity between these subtypes. Using real-time RT-PCR, SAV RNA was detected in heart tissue from 2 to 3 weeks post-challenge (wpc) in all cohabitant groups excluding controls. The results obtained suggested differences in the dynamics of infection between strains of SAV and potentially between subtypes. Results for SAV subtypes 1 and 3 suggested essentially synchronous infection of cohabitant fish. These two study groups also had the highest virus load in heart tissue as measured by quantitative RT-PCR and also had the most extensive histopathological changes. In contrast, results for SAV subtypes 2 and 6 strains were consistent with asynchronous infection in the cohabitant fish and were characterized by slow spread, low virus loads and mild histopathological changes. The SAV subtype 4 and 5 strains occupied an intermediate position in this regard. Despite the use of concentration procedures, it was not possible to detect SAV RNA in water samples from selected study tanks. However, testing of faeces from the SAV subtypes 1, 3 and 6 challenge groups found positive signals in each beginning at 1-3 wpc and remaining detectable for a further 2-3 weeks. Parallel testing of mucus samples found these became positive at 2-3 wpc and remained positive for a further 1-3 weeks.

Furthermore, this review examines the main approaches to creating engineered cardiac tissue with synthetic scaffolds, natural scaffolds, or no exogenous scaffold (i.e., \"scaffold free\"). The choice of scaffold and cells ultimately depends on the goals of the therapy, so the review considers how congenital heart defects define the design parameters for cardiac tissue engineering needed for surgical repair in pediatric cardiac patients.", "journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "date": "2011-02-05", "authors": ["Kareen LKreutziger", "Charles EMurry"], "doi": "10.1007/s00246-011-9888-9\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.1110.223917"}

This study aims to evaluate Simvastatin on the inflammatory response and heart functionality using dogs infected with Y strain of T. cruzi. Animals were treated daily with Simvastatin (20 mg) for 6 months and submitted to clinical and immunopathological evaluations. Simvastatin reduced heart expression and serum levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) but not interleukin-10 (IL-10), possibly favoring blood parasitism but reducing inflammation and fibrosis in the left ventricle and right atrium. Simvastatin also ameliorated ejection fraction, diastolic diameter, and mass index of the left ventricle 6 months after infection.

{"title": "The mechanical coupling of adult marrow stromal stem cells during cardiac regeneration assessed in a 2-D co-culture model.", "abstract": "Postnatal cardiomyocytes undergo terminal differentiation and a restricted number of human cardiomyocytes retain the ability to divide and regenerate in response to ischemic injury. However, whether these neo-cardiomyocytes are derived from endogenous population of resident cardiac stem cells or from the exogenous double assurance population of resident bone marrow-derived stem cells that populate the damaged myocardium is unresolved and under intense investigation. The vital challenge is to ameliorate and/or regenerate the damaged myocardium. This can be achieved by stimulating proliferation of native quiescent cardiomyocytes and/or cardiac stem cell, or by recruiting exogenous autologous or allogeneic cells such as fetal or embryonic cardiomyocyte progenitors or bone marrow-derived stromal stem cells. The prerequisites are that these neo-cardiomyocytes must have the ability to integrate well within the native myocardium and must exhibit functional synchronization. Adult bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have been shown to differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, BMSCs may potentially play an essential role in cardiac repair and regeneration, but this concept requires further validation. In this report, we have provided compelling evidence that functioning cardiac tissue can be generated by the interaction of multipotent BMSCs with embryonic cardiac myocytes (ECMs) in two-dimensional (2-D) co-cultures. The differentiating BMSCs were induced to undergo cardiomyogenic differentiation pathway and were able to express unequivocal electromechanical coupling and functional synchronization with ECMs. Our 2-D co-culture system provides a useful in vitro model to elucidate various molecular mechanisms underpinning the integration and orderly maturation and differentiation of BMSCs into neo-cardiomyocytes during myocardial repair and regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-02-04", "authors": ["Mani TValarmathi", "John WFuseler", "Richard LGoodwin", "Jeffrey MDavis", "Jay DPotts"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.012"}

The present study assessed the effects of \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cardiac fibrosis.\nWe assessed left ventricular fibrosis and pathology in mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction after the consumption of a fish oil or a control diet. In control mice, 4 weeks of transverse aortic constriction induced significant cardiac dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac fibroblast activation (proliferation and transformation into myofibroblasts). Dietary supplementation with fish oil prevented transverse aortic constriction-induced cardiac dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis and blocked cardiac fibroblast activation. In heart tissue, transverse aortic constriction increased active transforming growth factor-\u03b21 levels and phosphorylation of Smad2. In isolated adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 induced cardiac fibroblast transformation, proliferation, and collagen synthesis. Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid increased cyclic GMP levels and blocked cardiac fibroblast transformation, proliferation, and collagen synthesis.

In the present study, to address the hypothesis that somatic mutations are important in isolated CHDs, we analyzed the GATA4 and NKX2.5 genes in the fresh-frozen pathologic cardiac tissue specimen and corresponding non-diseased tissue obtained from a series of 62 CHD patients, including 35 patients with cardiac septal defects and 27 with other cardiac anomalies. We identified one variant and two common polymorphisms in the NKX2.5 gene, and six variants and two common polymorphisms in the GATA4 gene. All identified variants were seen in both the fresh-frozen pathologic cardiac tissue and the corresponding non-diseased tissue, which indicates that they all were constitutional variants.

Rats were closely monitored for survival rate analysis. Rats from each group were sacrificed on days 3, 7 and 28 postoperation.\nThe results showed that chronic continuous BNP infusion achieved similar effects to enalapril therapy, as evidenced by improved survival rate within the 28-day observation period compared with MI group rats; this effect was closely associated with preserved cardiac geometry and performance. The treatment combination did not offer extra benefits in terms of survival rate. Both BNP and enalapril therapy produced higher heart tissue concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and lower expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. These benefits were associated with lower phosphorylation levels of NF-\u03baB subunits I\u03baB\u03b1, p50 and p65.

The current study demonstrated the possibility of cardiac mitochondrial injury in prenatal PFOS-exposed weaned rat heart. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at doses of 0.1, 0.6 and 2.0 mg/kg/d and 0.05% Tween 80 as control by gavage from gestation days 2-21. The dams were allowed to give nature delivery and then heart tissues from weaned (postnatal day 21) offspring rats were analyzed for mitochondrial injury through ultrastructure observation by electron microscope, global gene expression profile by microarray, as well as related mRNA and proteins expression levels by quantitative PCR and western blot. Ultrastructural analysis revealed significant vacuolization and inner membrane injury occurred at the mitochondria of heart tissues from 2.0 mg/kg/d dosage group. Meanwhile, the global gene expression profile showed significant difference in level of some mRNA expression associated with mitochondrial function at 2.0 mg/kg/d dosage group, compared to the control. Furthermore, dose-response trends for the expression of selected genes were analyzed by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. The selected genes were mainly focused on those encoding for proteins involved in energy production, control of ion levels, and maintenance of heart function. The down-regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthetase (ATP5E, ATP5I and ATP5O) implicated a decrease in energy supply. This was accompanied by down-regulation of gene transcripts involved in energy consumption such as ion transporting ATPase (ATP1A3 and ATP2B2) and inner membrane protein synthesis (SLC25A3, SLC25A4, SLC25A10, SLC25A29). The up-regulation of gene transcripts encoding for uncoupling proteins (UCP1 and UCP3), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), was probably a protective process to maintain heart function.

Besides, hearts of 8-week-old rats were stimulated with the endogenous TLR4 ligand heparansulfate (HS); the proinflammatory mRNA pattern was assessed (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1).

Cardiac TLR4 distribution was investigated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Blood pressure (BP) and heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW) were elevated in SHR. Constitutive TLR4 expression was augmented in adolescent and adult, but not young SHR compared with WKY. TLR4 staining was pronounced in cardiomyocytes. HS entailed an aggravated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA response in cardiac tissue, which was significantly pronounced in SHR. Ramipril (10 mg kg(-1) per day) reduced BP, HW/BW and TLR4 expression in SHR. L-NAME also augmented TLR4 expression in WKY. Ramipril (1 mg kg(-1) per day) lowered BP but TLR4 expression remained unaffected. High-dose ramipril (10 mg kg(-1) per day) however decreased TLR4 expression. Starting from adolescence SHR demonstrated enhanced cardiac TLR4 expression. TLR4 was also upregulated in L-NAME induced hypertension. Thus, enhanced TLR4 expression might be linked to the development and maintenance of hypertension.

Plakoglobin is a component of both desmosomes and adherens junctions located at the intercalated disc (ICD) of cardiomyocytes, where it functions to link cadherins to the cytoskeleton. In addition, plakoglobin functions as a signaling protein via its ability to modulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. To investigate the role of plakoglobin in ARVC, we generated an inducible cardiorestricted knockout (CKO) of the plakoglobin gene in mice. Plakoglobin CKO mice exhibited progressive loss of cardiac myocytes, extensive inflammatory infiltration, fibrous tissue replacement, and cardiac dysfunction similar to those of ARVC patients. Desmosomal proteins from the ICD were decreased, consistent with altered desmosome ultrastructure in plakoglobin CKO hearts. Despite gap junction remodeling, plakoglobin CKO hearts were refractory to induced arrhythmias.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal ion channel function and sudden cardiac death. Here we report the development of a patient/disease-specific human iPSC line from a patient with type-2 LQTS (which is due to the A614V missense mutation in the KCNH2 gene). The generated iPSCs were coaxed to differentiate into the cardiac lineage. Detailed whole-cell patch-clamp and extracellular multielectrode recordings revealed significant prolongation of the action-potential duration in LQTS human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (the characteristic LQTS phenotype) when compared to healthy control cells. Voltage-clamp studies confirmed that this action-potential-duration prolongation stems from a significant reduction of the cardiac potassium current I(Kr). Importantly, LQTS-derived cells also showed marked arrhythmogenicity, characterized by early-after depolarizations and triggered arrhythmias. We then used the LQTS human iPSC-derived cardiac-tissue model to evaluate the potency of existing and novel pharmacological agents that may either aggravate (potassium-channel blockers) or ameliorate (calcium-channel blockers, K(ATP)-channel openers and late sodium-channel blockers) the disease phenotype. Our study illustrates the ability of human iPSC technology to model the abnormal functional phenotype of an inherited cardiac disorder and to identify potential new therapeutic agents. As such, it represents a promising paradigm to study disease mechanisms, optimize patient care (personalized medicine), and aid in the development of new therapies.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2011-01-18", "authors": ["IlanitItzhaki", "LeonidMaizels", "IritHuber", "LimorZwi-Dantsis", "OrenCaspi", "AaronWinterstern", "OrenFeldman", "AmiraGepstein", "GilArbel", "HaimHammerman", "MontherBoulos", "LiorGepstein"], "doi": "10.1038/nature09747"}

Whereas C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice showed only mild myocarditis, including normal survival postinfection with coxsackievirus group B serotype 3 (CVB3), infection of TRIF(-/-) mice led to the induction of cardiac remodeling, severe heart failure, and 100% mortality (p < 0.0001). These mice showed markedly reduced virus control in cardiac tissues and cardiomyocytes. This was accompained with dynamic cardiac cytokine activation in the heart, including a suppression of the antiviral cytokine IFN-\u03b2 in the early viremic phase. TRIF(-/-) myocytes displayed a TLR4-dependent suppression of IFN-\u03b2, and pharmacological treatment of CVB3-infected TRIF(-/-) mice with murine IFN-\u03b2 led to improved virus control and reduced cardiac inflammation. Additionally, this treatment within the viremic phase of myocarditis showed a significant long-term outcome indexed by reduced mortality (20 versus 100%; p < 0.001).

DFP has been shown to remove myocardial iron effectively. Curcuminoids (CUR) can chelate plasma NTBI, inhibit lipid peroxidation and alleviate cardiac autonomic imbalance.

Concentrations of plasma NTBI and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using HPLC techniques. Heart iron concentration was determined based on atomic absorption spectrophotometry and Perl's staining methods. Short-term electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded with AD Instruments Power Lab, and heart rate variability (HRV) was evaluated using MATLAB 7.0 program. Fe diet increased levels of NTBI and MDA in plasma, nonheme iron and iron deposit in heart tissue significantly, and depressed the HRV, which the levels were higher in the BKO mice than the WT mice. CUR and DFP treatments lowered plasma NTBI as well as MDA concentrations (p <0.05), heart iron accumulation effectively, and also improved the HRV in the treated mice.

We hypothesized that decreased blood pressure by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) would improve the function and architecture of coronary microvessels, in association with decreased inflammation and fibrosis.\nThree groups of pigs were studied: normal, HTN, and HTN+PTRA. After 6 weeks of renovascular HTN, induced by placing a local-irritant coil in the renal artery, pigs underwent PTRA or sham. Four weeks later multidetector-computed tomography (CT) was used to assess systolic, diastolic, and microvascular function, and responses to adenosine. Microvascular architecture, oxygen sensors, inflammation, and fibrosis were then explored in cardiac tissue.\nPTRA successfully decreased blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy. Basal fractional vascular volume (FVV) was similar among the groups, but its response to adenosine was significantly attenuated in HTN, whereas microvascular permeability (MP) and response to adenosine were greater than normal. Both were restored by PTRA. These were accompanied by increased myocardial expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, inflammation, and microvascular remodeling, including increased density of epicardial microvessels (20-200 \u00b5m), as well as cardiac diastolic dysfunction, all of which improved by reversal of HTN.

Many of its derivatives have pharmacological effects, including inhibition of cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in cardiac tissue; sedative-hypnotic profiles; anticonvulsant, analgesic, antithermic, and anti-inflammatory activities; and anxiolytic, antimicrobial, and proapoptotic effects. Carbamates derived from isatin have a vasorelaxant profile. This study investigated the activity of 2 novel 2-hydroxyacetophenone derivatives of isatin (named MB101 and MB130) on the contractility of rat aorta and papillary muscles. Both compounds induced a concentration-dependent relaxation (5-100 \u03bcM) in the endothelium-intact aorta that was abolished by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, significantly prevented vasodilatation of 100 \u03bcM MB101. In contrast, atropine caused no significant alteration in MB130-induced vasorelaxation. Naloxone, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, completely prevented the relaxing effect of MB101 and MB130 at all concentrations. In papillary muscles, only MB130 induced a significant depression, and this contractile response was not altered by propranolol and atropine. Both the compounds reduced systolic and diastolic pressures in a dose-dependent manner in anesthetized rats. The 2-hydroxyacetophenones produced direct effects on vascular tonus through either muscarinic or opioid pathways. MB130 produced cardiac depression by opioid receptors and bradykinin because pretreatment HOE140 or with naloxone, an antagonist of type-2, bradykinin were able to partially block the decrease in twitch amplitude in papillary muscles induced by MB130.

In this study, we have attempted to enrich autologous stem cells at the wound site through a stem-cell-capturing collagen scaffold by conjugating with a stem cell specific antibody. Sca-1 is a common surface marker of hematopoietic, cardiac and skeletal muscle stem cells. Due to the interaction of antibody and antigen, Sca-1 positive cells could be enriched to the functional collagen scaffold both in vitro and in vivo.

Cardiac tissues containing amyloid deposits composed of either transthyretin (TTR) or Ig light chain from nine patients with amyloidotic CMP were examined for the presence of CLU using immunohistochemical techniques. CLU staining coincided with the extracellular myocardial amyloid deposits in tissues from patients with familial TTR, senile systemic, and Ig light chain amyloidosis. The association of CLU with cardiac amyloid deposits was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. Serum concentrations of CLU were measured in familial TTR, senile systemic, and Ig light chain amyloidosis patient groups and compared with both age-matched healthy controls and with patients with CMP unrelated to amyloid disease.

Downregulation of JPH2 expression in a model of cardiac hypertrophy was recently associated with defective coupling between plasmalemmal L-type Ca(2+) channels and sarcoplasmic reticular ryanodine receptors. However, it remains unclear whether JPH2 expression is altered in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In addition, the effects of downregulation of JPH2 expression on intracellular Ca(2+) handling are presently poorly understood. We sought to determine whether loss of JPH2 expression is noted among patients with HCM and whether expression silencing might perturb Ca(2+) handling in a prohypertrophic manner.\nJPH2 expression was reduced in flash-frozen human cardiac tissue procured from patients with HCM compared with ostensibly healthy traumatic death victims. Partial silencing of JPH2 expression in HL-1 cells by a small interfering RNA probe targeted to murine JPH2 mRNA (shJPH2) resulted in myocyte hypertrophy and increased expression of known markers of cardiac hypertrophy. Whereas expression levels of major Ca(2+)-handling proteins were unchanged, shJPH2 cells demonstrated depressed maximal Ca(2+) transient amplitudes that were insensitive to L-type Ca(2+) channel activation with JPH2 knockdown. Further, reduced caffeine-triggered sarcoplasmic reticulum store Ca(2+) levels were observed with potentially increased total Ca(2+) stores. Spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations were elicited at a higher extracellular [Ca(2+)] and with decreased frequency in JPH2 knockdown cells.\nOur results show that JPH2 levels are reduced in patients with HCM.

EUK-8 (25mg/kg/day), a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic, was administered to H/M-SOD2(-/-) mice for four weeks beginning at 8 weeks of age.

While cardiac function was unchanged in these experimental mice, the end-diastolic dimension in H/M-SOD2(-/-) mice was notably dilated and could be significantly reduced by EUK-8 treatment. At the end of the study, no shortening of telomere length was observed in heart tissues from all mice tested, but telomerase activity was decreased in heart tissue from H/M-SOD2(-/-) mice compared to control mice. Protein expression for telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomere repeat binding factor 2 was also downregulated in H/M-SOD2(-/-) heart tissue as was expression of phospho-Akt, insulin-like growth factor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

Here, the authors show that NDRG2, mainly localized in cardiomyocyte cytoplasm, was significantly reduced in myocardial tissue after acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Meanwhile, c-Myc was up-regulated following acute I/R injury, and the expression of c-Myc was significantly inversely correlated with that of NDRG2. In addition, overexpression of c-Myc in primary cultured cardiomyocyte repressed NDRG2 expression. Furthermore, the increase of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was correlated with the decrease of NDRG2 protein during the acute phase of reperfusion. These data suggested for the first time that I/R injury-induced up-regulation of pro-apoptotic c-Myc expression may contribute to the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic NDRG2.

CTT is a traditional method used for whole breast radiotherapy and includes standard wedged tangents (two opposed wedged tangential photon beams). The IMRT technique has been widely used for many treatment sites, allowing both improved sparing of normal tissues and more conformal dose distributions. IMRT is a new technique for whole breast radiotherapy. IMRT is used to improve conformity and homogeneity and used to reduce OAR doses.\nThirty patients with left-sided breast carcinoma were treated between 2005 and 2008 using 6, 18 or mixed 6/18 MV photons for primary breast irradiation following breast conserving surgery (BCS).

{"title": "Identification of a lactate-quinone oxidoreductase in Staphylococcus aureus that is essential for virulence.", "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen commonly infecting nearly every host tissue. The ability of S. aureus to resist innate immunity is critical to its success as a pathogen, including its propensity to grow in the presence of host nitric oxide (NO\u00b7). Upon exogenous NO\u00b7 exposure, S. aureus immediately excretes copious amounts of L-lactate to maintain redox balance. However, after prolonged NO\u00b7-exposure, S. aureus reassimilates L-lactate specifically and in this work, we identify the enzyme responsible for this L-lactate-consumption as a L-lactate-quinone oxidoreductase (Lqo, SACOL2623). Originally annotated as Mqo2 and thought to oxidize malate, we show that this enzyme exhibits no affinity for malate but reacts specifically with L-lactate (K(M)\u2009=\u2009\u223c330\u2009\u03bcM). In addition to its requirement for reassimilation of L-lactate during NO\u00b7-stress, Lqo is also critical to respiratory growth on L-lactate as a sole carbon source. Moreover, \u0394lqo mutants exhibit attenuation in a murine model of sepsis, particularly in their ability to cause myocarditis. Interestingly, this cardiac-specific attenuation is completely abrogated in mice unable to synthesize inflammatory NO\u00b7 (iNOS(-/-)). We demonstrate that S. aureus NO\u00b7-resistance is highly dependent on the availability of a glycolytic carbon sources. However, S. aureus can utilize the combination of peptides and L-lactate as carbon sources during NO\u00b7-stress in an Lqo-dependent fashion. Murine cardiac tissue has markedly high levels of L-lactate in comparison to renal or hepatic tissue consistent with the NO\u00b7-dependent requirement for Lqo in S. aureus myocarditis. Thus, Lqo provides S. aureus with yet another means of replicating in the presence of host NO\u00b7.", "journal": "Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology", "date": "2011-01-01", "authors": ["James RFuller", "Nicholas PVitko", "Ellen FPerkowski", "EricScott", "DalKhatri", "Jeffrey SSpontak", "Lance RThurlow", "Anthony RRichardson"], "doi": "10.3389/fcimb.2011.00019\n10.1016/S0378-1097(97)00116-X\n10.1086/320184\n10.1038/nrmicro1289\n10.1128/JB.01846-07\n10.1016/0002-9343(77)90150-4\n10.1001/jama.298.15.1763\n10.1007/s00239-001-0088-8\n10.1128/JCM.02601-10\n10.2143/AC.64.3.2038013\n10.1086/507637\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05290.x\n10.1126/science.1155207\n10.1016/j.chom.2011.06.004\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1000451\n10.1007/s10517-010-1075-0\n10.1128/IAI.70.11.6373-6382.2002\n10.3109/00016489109131365\n10.4049/jimmunol.1002794\n10.1111/j.1574-6968.1995.tb07549.x\n10.2741/953\n10.3109/00365549209062462\n10.1073/pnas.0610827104"}

Since lovastatin is used worldwide as a cholesterol lowering drug, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the antioxidant property of lovastatin against H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress in rats. Four study groups of rats of four animals each were treated with DMSO (control), H(2)O(2) (OS), lovastatin (L) and H(2)O(2) + lovastatin (OSL). On the 15th day the animals were sacrificed, and the liver and heart tissues were analyzed for oxidative stress biomarkers and anti-oxidant enzymes. Results of the OSL-group showed a reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in liver (42.7%) and heart tissue (8%) compared with the control group. An increase was observed in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase (34.6% in liver and 33.3% in heart) and glutathione peroxidase (50.5% in liver and 34.7% in heart). A commensurate increase in the activity of G6PDH was observed indicating an enhanced requirement of NADPH. The ratio GSH:GSSG in liver (1.05) and heart (0.84) was satisfactorily regulated compared to the control group (1.01 in liver and 0.93 in heart).

Not surprisingly our results show that different tissue handling strategies have the potential to produce a wide variation in the phosphorylation and proteolysis of selected contractile proteins. However this was not uniform: phosphorylation of troponin I (TnI) and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) varied significantly depending on approach whereas changes in desmin and myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) were relatively unaffected. Moreover, some strategies increased whereas others reduced TnI phosphorylation, suggesting a dynamic balance between kinase and phosphatase activities.

Levels of renalase, a recently discovered oxidase that metabolizes catecholamines, are decreased in CKD. Here we show that renalase deficiency in a mouse knockout model causes increased plasma catecholamine levels and hypertension. Plasma blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and aldosterone were unaffected. However, knockout mice had normal systolic function and mild ventricular hypertrophy but tolerated cardiac ischemia poorly and developed myocardial necrosis threefold more severe than that found in wild-type mice. Treatment with recombinant renalase completely rescued the cardiac phenotype. To gain insight into the mechanisms mediating this cardioprotective effect, we tested if gene deletion affected nitrate and glutathione metabolism, but found no differences between hearts of knockout and wild-type mice. The ratio of oxidized (NAD) to reduced (NADH) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in cardiac tissue, however, was significantly decreased in the hearts of renalase knockout mice, as was plasma NADH oxidase activity. In vitro studies confirmed that renalase metabolizes NADH and catecholamines.

A pyroglutamate helix B surface peptide (pHBP), recently engineered to include only a part of the EPO molecule that does not bind to EPO receptor and thus, is not erythropoietic, retains tissue protective properties of EPO. Here we compared the ability of pHBP and EPO to protect cardiac myocytes from oxidative stress in vitro and cardiac tissue from ischemic damage in vivo. HBP, similar to EPO, increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) threshold for induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition by 40%. In an experimental model of myocardial infarction induced by permanent ligation of a coronary artery in rats, a single bolus injection of 60 \u03bcg/kg of pHBP immediately after coronary ligation, similar to EPO, reduced apoptosis in the myocardial area at risk, examined 24 h later, by 80% and inflammation by 34%. Myocardial infarction (MI) measured 24 h after coronary ligation was similarly reduced by 50% in both pHBP- and EPO-treated rats. Two wks after surgery, left ventricular remodeling (ventricular dilation) and functional decline (fall in ejection fraction) assessed by echocardiography were significantly and similarly attenuated in pHBP- and EPO-treated rats, and MI size was reduced by 25%. The effect was retained during the 6-wk follow-up. A single bolus injection of pHBP immediately after coronary ligation was effective in reduction of MI size in a dose as low as 1 \u03bcg/kg, but was ineffective at a 60 \u03bcg/kg dose if administered 24 h after MI induction.

{"title": "Mild hypothermia as a cardioprotective approach for acute myocardial infarction: laboratory to clinical application.", "abstract": "In many animal models, mild therapeutic hypothermia is a powerful intervention, reducing myocardial infarct size, reducing the no-reflow phenomenon, and improving healing after infarction. Cooling in these models has been produced by various means including whole-body hypothermia, synchronized hypothermic coronary venous retro-perfusion, heat exchangers, and regional hypothermia targeting the heart alone. However, in humans, the most widely used techniques are surface cooling and cooling by endovascular heat-exchange catheters. The reduction in temperature necessary to produce cardioprotection is mild (32-34\u00b0C), appears to have no detrimental effects on left ventricular function or regional myocardial blood flow, and may improve microvascular reflow to previously ischemic heart tissue. It has been shown in experimental and clinical studies that for therapeutic hypothermia to be effective it must be (1) initiated as early as possible after the onset of ischemia and (2) initiated before reperfusion. This may require initiation of hypothermia in the ambulance, well before mechanical reperfusion occurs. The mechanisms of protection produced by hypothermia have yet to be conclusively determined but may include a decrease in tissue metabolic rate, preservation of high energy phosphates, a reduction in tissue apoptosis or induction of heat shock proteins.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics", "date": "2010-12-15", "authors": ["Sharon LHale", "Robert AKloner"], "doi": "10.1177/1074248410387280"}
{"title": "Differential antioxidant protection in tissues from marine mammals with distinct diving capacities. Shallow/short vs. deep/long divers.", "abstract": "The diving response in marine mammals results in bradycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction, with blood flow redistributing preferentially to nervous and cardiac tissues. Therefore, some tissues are rendered ischemic during a dive; with the first breath after a dive, blood flow to all tissues is reestablished. In terrestrial mammals, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increases in response to ischemia/reperfusion and oxidative damage can occur. The capacity of marine mammals to tolerate repeated ischemia/reperfusion cycles associated with diving appears to be due to an enhanced antioxidant system. However, it is not known if diving depth and/or duration elicit differences in tissue capacity to produce ROS and antioxidant defenses in marine mammals. The objective of this study was to analyze ROS production, antioxidant defenses and oxidative damage in marine mammal species that perform shallow/short vs. deep/long dives. We measured production of superoxide radical (O(2)(\u2022-)), oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, activity of antioxidant enzymes, and glutathione levels in tissues from shallow/short divers (Tursiops truncatus) and deep/long divers (Kogia spp.). We found that differences between the diving capacity of dolphins and Kogia spp. are reflected in O(2)(\u2022-) production and antioxidant levels. These differences suggest that shallow/short and deep/long divers have distinct mechanisms to successfully maintain redox balance.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "Iron chelation with salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone protects against catecholamine autoxidation and cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Elevated catecholamine levels are known to induce damage of the cardiac tissue. This catecholamine cardiotoxicity may stem from their ability to undergo oxidative conversion to aminochromes and concomitant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cardiomyocytes via the iron-catalyzed Fenton-type reaction. This suggests the possibility of cardioprotection by iron chelation. Our in vitro experiments have demonstrated a spontaneous decrease in the concentration of the catecholamines epinephrine and isoprenaline during their 24-h preincubation in buffered solution as well as their gradual conversion to oxidation products. These changes were significantly augmented by addition of iron ions and reduced by the iron-chelating agent salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH). Oxidized catecholamines were shown to form complexes with iron that had significant redox activity, which could be suppressed by SIH. Experiments using the H9c2 cardiomyoblast cell line revealed higher cytotoxicity of oxidized catecholamines than of the parent compounds, apparently through the induction of caspase-independent cell death, whereas co-incubation of cells with SIH was able to significantly preserve cell viability. A significant increase in intracellular ROS formation was observed after the incubation of cells with catecholamine oxidation products; this could be significantly reduced by SIH. In contrast, parent catecholamines did not increase, but rather decreased, cellular ROS production. Hence, our results demonstrate an important role for redox-active iron in catecholamine autoxidation and subsequent toxicity. The iron chelator SIH has shown considerable potential to protect cardiac cells by both inhibition of deleterious catecholamine oxidation to reactive intermediates and prevention of ROS-mediated cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2010-12-15", "authors": ["Pavl\u00ednaHa\u0161kov\u00e1", "PetraKova\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1", "LucieKoubkov\u00e1", "AnnaV\u00e1vrov\u00e1", "Eli\u0161kaMackov\u00e1", "Tom\u00e1\u0161Sim\u016fnek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.12.004"}

The evidence is based on the following facts (a) isolated kinase fraction from human failing heart tissues contained PKC\u03b4 that phosphorylated HDAC5 Ser\u2082\u2085\u2089 peptide and no significant activity was found for the unbound fraction after they were immunoprecipitated with PKC\u03b4 specific antibody; (b) specific inhibitors for PKC\u03b4 inhibited kinase activity from isolated fraction and recombinant human PKC\u03b4 with similar IC\u2085\u2080 values; (c) recombinant human PKC\u03b4 can directly phosphorylate full length Ser\u2082\u2085\u2089 HDAC5 protein and HDAC5 Ser\u2082\u2085\u2089 peptide.

{"title": "Molecular characterization of the MuRF genes in rainbow trout: Potential role in muscle degradation.", "abstract": "Muscle growth is determined primarily by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. When rates of protein synthesis are similar between individuals, protein degradation is critical in explaining differences in growth efficiency. Studies in mammals showed that muscle atrophy results from increased protein breakdown, and is associated with activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, including induction of the muscle-specific ubiquitin protein ligase, MuRF1. Animals lacking MuRF1 are resistant to muscle atrophy. In fish, little is known about the role of the proteasome/MuRF pathway in muscle degradation. The objectives of this study were to: 1) clone and characterize MuRF genes in rainbow trout; and 2) determine expression of MuRF genes in association with starvation- and vitellogenesis-induced muscle atrophy in rainbow trout. We have identified full-length cDNA sequences for three MuRF genes (MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3). These genes encode proteins with typical MuRF structural domains, including a RING-finger, a B-box and a Leucine-rich coiled-coil domain. RT-PCR analysis showed that MuRF genes are predominantly expressed in muscle and heart tissues. Real time PCR analysis revealed that expression of all MuRF genes is up-regulated during starvation and MuRF3 is up-regulated in vitellogenesis-associated muscle degradation. These results suggest that MuRF genes have an important role in fish muscle protein degradation. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential use of MuRF genes as tools to monitor fish muscle growth and degradation.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "A novel miniaturized multimodal bioreactor for continuous in situ assessment of bioartificial cardiac tissue during stimulation and maturation.", "abstract": "Stem cell-based cardiac tissue engineering is a promising approach for regenerative therapy of the injured heart. At present, the small number of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes that can be obtained using current culture and enrichment techniques represents one of the key limitations for the development of functional bioartificial cardiac tissue (BCT). We have addressed this problem by construction of a novel bioreactor with functional features of larger systems that enables the generation and in situ monitoring of miniaturized BCTs. BCTs were generated from rat cardiomyocytes to demonstrate advantages and usefulness of the bioreactor. Tissues showed spontaneous, synchronized contractions with cell orientation along the axis of strain. Cyclic stretch induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, demonstrated by a shift of myosin heavy chain expression from the alpha to beta isoform, together with elevated levels of atrial natriuretic factor. Stretch led to a moderate increase in systolic force (1.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009mN vs. 0.96\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009mN in controls), with significantly higher forces observed after \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation with noradrenalin (2.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u2009mN). Combined mechanical and \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation had no synergistic effect. This study demonstrates for the first time that mechanical stimulation and direct real-time contraction force measurement can be combined into a single multimodal bioreactor system, including electrical stimulation of excitable tissue, perfusion of the culture chamber, and the possibility of (fluorescence) microscopic assessment during continuous cultivation.

Here, we examine Raldh2(-/-) and Rxra(-/-) mouse embryos to investigate the role of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in this developmental process. The heart phenotypes of Raldh2 and Rxra mutants are very similar and are characterized by a prominent defect in ventricular compact zone growth. Although RA activity is completely lost in Raldh2(-/-) epicardium and the adjacent myocardium, RA activity is not lost in Rxra(-/-) hearts, suggesting that RA signaling in the epicardium/myocardium is not required for myocardial compact zone formation. We explored the possibility that RA-mediated target gene transcription in non-cardiac tissues is required for this process. We found that hepatic expression of erythropoietin (EPO), a secreted factor implicated in myocardial expansion, is dependent on both Raldh2 and Rxra. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies support Epo as a direct target of RA signaling in embryonic liver. Treatment of an epicardial cell line with EPO, but not RA, upregulates Igf2. Furthermore, both Raldh2(-/-) and Rxra(-/-) hearts exhibit downregulation of Igf2 mRNA in the epicardium. EPO treatment of cultured Raldh2(-/-) hearts restores epicardial Igf2 expression and rescues ventricular cardiomyocyte proliferation. We propose a new model for the mechanism of RA-mediated myocardial expansion in which RA directly induces hepatic Epo resulting in activation of epicardial Igf2 that stimulates compact zone growth.

Hypertension (HT) increases the incidence of cardiac events, but its effect on cardiac adaptation to coexisting coronary artery stenosis (CAS) is unclear. We hypothesized that concurrent HT modulates microvascular function in chronic CAS and aggravates microvascular remodeling and myocardial injury. Four groups of pigs (n=6 each) were studied: normal, CAS, HT, and CAS+HT. CAS and HT were induced by placing local irritant coils in the left circumflex coronary artery and renal artery, respectively. Six weeks later multidetector computerized tomography (CT) was used to assess systolic and diastolic function, microvascular permeability, myocardial perfusion, and responses to adenosine in the \"area at risk.\" Microvascular architecture, inflammation, and fibrosis were then explored in cardiac tissue. Basal myocardial perfusion was similarly decreased in CAS and CAS+HT, but its response to adenosine was significantly more attenuated in CAS. Microvascular permeability in CAS+HT was greater than in CAS and was accompanied by amplified myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and microvascular remodeling, as well as cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction. On the other hand, compared with normal, micro-CT-derived microvascular (20-200 \u03bcm) transmural density decreased in CAS but not in HT or CAS+HT. We conclude that the coexistence of early renovascular HT exacerbated myocardial fibrosis and vascular remodeling distal to CAS.

The percentage of total liver lipids was about 32% lower and serum triglyceride levels were 71% higher in the O-BMS group compared to the O-Ctrl group.

Although genetic deletion of all ERK1/2 from the mouse heart did not block the cardiac hypertrophic response per se, meaning that the heart still increased in weight with both aging and pathological stress stimulation, it did dramatically alter how the heart grew. For example, adult myocytes from hearts of Erk1(-/-) Erk2(fl/fl-Cre) mice showed preferential eccentric growth (lengthening), whereas myocytes from Mek1 transgenic hearts showed concentric growth (width increase). Isolated adult myocytes acutely inhibited for ERK1/2 signaling by adenoviral gene transfer showed spontaneous lengthening, whereas infection with an activated Mek1 adenovirus promoted constitutive ERK1/2 signaling and increased myocyte thickness.

This sensor is designed to detect, in future applications, the spiking activity of neurons or muscle cells. This procedure is based on the well-known capability that a magnetic MEMS device can be used to sense a small magnetic flux density. In this work, an electronic neuron (FitzHugh-Nagumo) is used to generate controlled spike-like magnetic fields. We show that the magnetic flux density generated by the hardware of this neuron can be detected with a new MEMS magnetic field sensor. This microdevice has a compact resonant structure (700\u2009\u00d7\u2009600\u2009\u00d7\u20095 \u03bcm) integrated by an array of silicon beams and p-type piezoresistive sensing elements, which need an easy fabrication process. The proposed microsensor has a resolution of 80 nT, a sensitivity of 1.2 V.T(-1), a resonant frequency of 13.87 kHz, low power consumption (2.05 mW), quality factor of 93 at atmospheric pressure, and requires a simple signal processing circuit. The importance of our study is twofold. First, because the artificial neuron can generate well-controlled magnetic flux density, we suggest it could be used to analyze the resolution and performance of different magnetic field sensors intended for neurobiological applications. Second, the introduced MEMS magnetic field sensor may be used as a prototype to develop new high-resolution biomedical microdevices to sense magnetic fields from cardiac tissue, nerves, spinal cord, or the brain.", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2010-11-30", "authors": ["Jesus ATapia", "Agustin LHerrera-May", "Pedro JGarc\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez", "JaimeMartinez-Castillo", "EduardFigueras", "AmiraFlores", "El\u00edasManjarrez"], "doi": "10.1007/s10544-010-9494-2"}

Herein, we explored the possible role of a combination of two matrix-attached peptides, the adhesion peptide G(4)RGDY and heparin-binding peptide G(4)SPPRRARVTY (HBP) in cardiac tissue regeneration. Neonatal rat cardiac cells were seeded into unmodified, single peptide or double peptide-attached alginate scaffolds, all having the same physical features of porosity, hydrogel forming and matrix stiffness. The cardiac tissue developed in the HBP/RGD-attached scaffolds revealed the best features of a functional muscle tissue, as judged by all studied parameters, i.e., immunostaining of cardiac cell markers, histology, western blot of protein expressions and metabolic activity. By day 7, well-developed myocardial fibers were observed in these cell constructs. At 14 days the HBP/RGD-attached constructs presented an isotropic myofiber arrangement, while no such arrangement was seen in the other constructs. The expression levels of \u03b1-actinin, N-cadherin and Connexin-43, showing preservation and an increase in Connexin-43 expression (Cx-43) with time, further supported the formation a contractile muscle tissue in the HBP/RGD-attached scaffolds.

{"title": "Variation in amount of wild-type transthyretin in different fibril and tissue types in ATTR amyloidosis.", "abstract": "Familial transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is caused by a mutation in the TTR gene, although wild-type (wt) TTR is also incorporated into the amyloid fibrils. Liver transplantation (LT) is the prevailing treatment of the disease and is performed in order to eliminate the mutant TTR from plasma. The outcome of the procedure is varied; especially problematic is a progressive cardiomyopathy seen in some patients, presumably caused by continued incorporation of wtTTR. What determines the discrepancy in outcome is not clear. We have previously shown that two structurally distinct amyloid fibrils (with or without fragmented ATTR) are found among ATTRV30M patients. In this study, we investigated the proportion of wtATTR in cardiac and adipose amyloid from patients having either fibril type. It was found that cardiac amyloid more easily incorporates wtTTR than adipose amyloid, offering a potential explanation for the vulnerability of cardiac tissue for continued amyloidosis after LT. In cardiac tissue, fibrils with fragmented ATTR contained a higher wt proportion than fibrils without, suggesting that continued incorporation of wtTTR after LT, perhaps, can take place more easily in these patients. In adipose tissue, a rapid increase in wt proportion after LT indicates that a rather fast turnover of the deposits must occur. A difference in wt proportion between the fibril types was seen post-LT but not pre-LT, possibly caused by differences in turnover rate. Conclusively, this study further establishes the basic dissimilarities between the two fibril types and demonstrates that their role in LT outcome needs to be further investigated.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2010-11-26", "authors": ["ElisabetIhse", "Ole BSuhr", "UlfHellman", "PerWestermark"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-010-0695-1\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.3203\n10.1002/lt.21395\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181ea15d4\n10.1073/pnas.87.7.2843\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01173.x\n10.1080/13506120701460923\n10.1002/path.1759\n10.1073/pnas.80.2.539\n10.1080/13506120600877003\n10.1002/path.2411\n10.1111/j.1399-0004.1991.tb03085.x\n10.1097/01.TP.0000092307.98347.CB\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2007.01969.x\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2006.01585.x\n10.1080/13506120701614032\n10.1097/00007890-199707150-00014\n10.1097/00007890-199807270-00016\n10.1097/00007890-200203150-00015\n10.1097/01.md.0000232559.22098.c3\n10.1080/13506120701461368\n10.2169/internalmedicine.47.1399\n10.1016/S0076-6879(99)09007-2\n10.1016/j.acthis.2006.03.011\n10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2\n10.1038/labinvest.3700124\n10.1016/j.jns.2009.07.028\n10.1073/pnas.81.3.694\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.095\n10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb02468.x\n10.1016/j.jmb.2005.09.100"}

As heparin cofactor II (HCII) inhibits the action of tissue thrombin in the cardiovascular system, it is possible that HCII counteracts the development of cardiac remodeling. We investigated the relationships between plasma HCII activity and surrogate markers of cardiac geometry, including left atrial volume index (LAVI), relative wall thickness (RWT) and left ventricular mass index, and deceleration time (DcT) and the ratio of peak E velocity to early diastolic mitral annulus velocity (E/e' ratio) as surrogate markers of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction measured using echocardiography in 304 Japanese elderly individuals without systolic heart failure (169 men and 135 women; mean age: 65.4 \u00b1 11.8 years). Mean plasma HCII activity in all participants was 95.8 \u00b1 17.0% and there was no difference between the mean plasma HCII activities in males and females. Multiple regression analysis revealed that there were significant inverse relationships between plasma HCII activity and LAVI (coefficient: -0.2302, P<0.001), between HCII activity and RWT (coefficient: -0.0007, P<0.05), between HCII activity and DcT (coefficient: -0.5189, P<0.05) and between HCII activity and E/e' ratio (coefficient: -0.0558, P<0.01).

{"title": "Perspectives in microvascular fluid handling: does the distribution of coagulation factors in human myocardium comply with plasma extravasation in venular coronary segments?", "abstract": "Heterogeneity of vascular permeability has been suggested for the coronary system. Whereas arteriolar and capillary segments are tight, plasma proteins pass readily into the interstitial space at venular sites. Fittingly, lymphatic fluid is able to coagulate. However, heart tissue contains high concentrations of tissue factor, presumably enabling bleeding to be stopped immediately in this vital organ. The distribution of pro- and anti-coagulatively active factors in human heart tissue has now been determined in relation to the types of microvessels.\nSamples of healthy explanted hearts and dilated cardiomyopathic hearts were immunohistochemically stained. Albumin was found throughout the interstitial space. Tissue factor was packed tightly around arterioles and capillaries, whereas the tissue surrounding venules and small veins was practically free of this starter of coagulation. Thrombomodulin was present at the luminal surface of all vessel segments and especially at venular endothelial cell junctions. Its product, the anticoagulant protein C, appeared only at discrete extravascular sites, mainly next to capillaries. These distribution patterns were basically identical in the healthy and diseased hearts, suggesting a general principle.\nVenular extravasation of plasma proteins probably would not bring prothrombin into intimate contact with tissue factor, avoiding interstitial coagulation in the absence of injury. Generation of activated protein C via thrombomodulin is favored in the vicinity of venular gaps, should thrombin occur inside coronary vessels. This regionalization of distribution supports the proposed physiological heterogeneity of the vascular barrier and complies with the passage of plasma proteins into the lymphatic system of the heart.", "journal": "Journal of vascular research", "date": "2010-11-23", "authors": ["MatthiasJacob", "DanielChappell", "MechthildStoeckelhuber", "UlrichWelsch", "MarkusRehm", "DirkBruegger", "IngoKaczmarek", "PeterConzen", "Bernhard FBecker"], "doi": "10.1159/000318795"}

E-4031 (an I(Kr) blocker) combined with reduced extracellular K ([K(+)](o)) and Mg ([Mg(2+)](o)) prolonged action potential duration heterogeneously and induced phase 2 and phase 3 EADs. Whereas phase 2 EADs were Ca(i)-dependent, phase 3 EADs were not. The origins of 47 triggered activity episodes were attributed to phase 2 EADs in 12 episodes (26%) and phase 3 EADs in 35 episodes (74%). When phase 2 EADs accompanied phase 3 EADs, they accentuated action potential duration heterogeneity, creating a large V(m) gradient across the boundary between long and short action potential duration regions from which triggered activity emerged. The amplitude of phase 3 EADs correlated with the V(m) gradient (r=0.898, P<0.001). Computer simulation studies showed that coupling of cells with heterogeneous repolarization could extrinsically generate phase 3 EADs via electrotonic current flow. Alternatively, reduced I(K1) caused by low [K(+)](o) could generate intrinsic phase 3 EADs capable of inducing triggered activity at the boundary zone.\nPhase 3 EADs can be extrinsic as the result of electrotonic current across steep repolarization gradients or intrinsic as the result of low I(K1) and do not require spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release.

Hexokinase (HK)II is a HK isoform that is expressed in the heart and can bind to the mitochondrial outer membrane.\nWe sought to define how HKII and its binding to mitochondria play a role in cardiac response and remodeling after I/R.\nWe first showed that HKII levels and its binding to mitochondria are reduced 2 days after I/R.

At baseline, HKII(+/)\u207b mice have normal cardiac function; however, they display lower systolic function after I/R compared to wild-type animals. The mechanism appears to be through an increase in cardiomyocyte death and fibrosis and a reduction in angiogenesis; the latter is through a decrease in hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent pathway signaling in cardiomyocytes. HKII mitochondrial binding is also critical for cardiomyocyte survival, because its displacement in tissue culture with a synthetic peptide increases cell death. Our results also suggest that HKII may be important for the remodeling of the viable cardiac tissue because its modulation in vitro alters cellular energy levels, O\u2082 consumption, and contractility.\nThese results suggest that reduction in HKII levels causes altered remodeling of the heart in I/R by increasing cell death and fibrosis and reducing angiogenesis and that mitochondrial binding is needed for protection of cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2010-11-13", "authors": ["RongxueWu", "Kirsten MSmeele", "EugeneWyatt", "YoshihikoIchikawa", "OttoEerbeek", "LinSun", "KusumChawla", "Markus WHollmann", "VarunNagpal", "SamiHeikkinen", "MarkkuLaakso", "KentaroJujo", "J AndrewWasserstrom", "Coert JZuurbier", "HosseinArdehali"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223115"}

Using this method, we studied the distribution of tyrosine phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (PY-STAT3) in LV tissue of animals treated with the \u03b2-agonist dobutamine. Upon treatment, PY-STAT3 increased 30.2\u00b18.5-fold in total homogenates, but only 6.9\u00b12.1-fold (n=4, P=0.03) in nuclear protein extracts. Of all PY-STAT3 formed, only a minor fraction appeared in the nuclear fraction. This simple and reproducible protocol yielded nuclear protein extracts that were highly enriched in nuclear proteins with almost complete removal of cytosolic and myofilament proteins. This nuclear protein extraction protocol is therefore well-suited for nuclear proteome analysis of frozen heart tissue collected in biobanks.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2010-11-10", "authors": ["Diederik W DKuster", "DaphneMerkus", "Huub J JJorna", "Dick H WDekkers", "Dirk JDuncker", "Adrie J MVerhoeven"], "doi": "10.1007/s13105-010-0059-x"}

Rats received daily treatment of either distilled water (4 ml/kg) or LBP (200mg/kg) for 10 days and then followed by an intravenous injection at day 7 of either saline (10 ml/kg) or DOX (10 mg/kg). DOX induced significantly myocardial damage in rats, which were characterized as conduction abnormalities, decreased heart-to-body weight ratio, increased serum CK, and myofibrillar disarrangement. DOX treatment also increased MDA and decreased SOD and GSH-Px activity in cardiac tissues. Pretreatment with LBP significantly reduced DOX-induced oxidative injury in cardiac tissue, suggesting by the fact that LBP significantly attenuated DOX-induced cardiac myofibrillar disarrangement and LBP was effective in decreasing the levels of serum CK and thus improving conduction abnormalities caused by DOX. LBP treatment significantly increased SOD and GSH-Px activity and decreased the MDA level of heart tissues damaged by DOX exposure in rats. Furthermore, the cytotoxic study showed that LBP protect against cytotoxicity of DOX in cardiac myoblasts H9c2 but dose not attenuate the anti-tumor activity of DOX. In summary, our evidence indicates that LBP elicited a typical protective effect on DOX-induced acute cardiotoxicity via suppressing oxidative stress.", "journal": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "date": "2010-11-09", "authors": ["Yan-FeiXin", "Li-LiWan", "Jin-LiangPeng", "ChengGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fct.2010.10.028"}

Therefore, advancing and developing novel cardiac tissue repair and replacement therapeutics have great implications to our health sciences and well-being.

A unique advantage of jet-based approaches is the possibility to handle living cells with a matrix for cell distribution and deposition in suspension, either as single or heterogeneous cell populations. Our previous studies on bio-electrospraying of cardiac cells have shown great promise. Here, we show for the first time the ability to bio-electrospray the three major cell types of the myocardium, both independently and simultaneously, for forming a fully functional cardiac tissue. Several samples are characterized in vitro and found to be indistinguishable in comparison to controls.

{"title": "In vivo and in vitro assessment of the role of glutathione antioxidant system in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "The clinical usefulness of anthracycline antineoplastic drugs is limited by their cardiotoxicity. Its mechanisms have not been fully understood, although the induction of oxidative stress is widely believed to play the principal role. Glutathione is the dominant cellular antioxidant, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) together with glutathione reductase (GR) constitutes the major enzymatic system protecting the cardiac cells from oxidative damage. Therefore, this study aimed to assess their roles in anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Ten-week intravenous administration of daunorubicin (DAU, 3\u00a0mg/kg weekly) to rabbits induced heart failure, which was evident from decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and release of cardiac troponins to circulation. However, no significant changes in either total or oxidized glutathione contents or GR activity were detected in left ventricular tissue of DAU-treated rabbits when compared with control animals. GPx activity in the cardiac tissue significantly increased. In H9c2 rat cardiac cells, 24-h DAU exposure (0.1-10\u00a0\u03bcM) induced significant dose-dependent toxicity. Cellular content of reduced glutathione was insignificantly decreased, oxidized glutathione and GR activity were unaffected, and GPx activity was significantly increased. Neither buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, glutathione biosynthesis inhibitor) nor 2-oxo-4-thiazolidine-carboxylic acid (OTC, glutathione biosynthetic precursor) had significant effects on DAU cytotoxicity. This contrasted with model oxidative injury induced by hydrogen peroxide, which cytotoxicity was increased by BSO and decreased by OTC.

Its presence has been putatively linked to the onset of cardiac reentry, which is a precursor to ventricular fibrillation. Previous studies have shown that closed-loop alternans control techniques that apply a succession of externally administered cycle perturbations at a single site provide limited spatially-extended alternans elimination in sufficiently large cardiac substrates. However, detailed experimental investigations into the spatial dynamics of alternans control have been restricted to Purkinje fiber studies. A complete understanding of alternans control in the more clinically relevant ventricular tissue is needed. In this paper, we study the spatial dynamics of alternans and alternans control in arterially perfused canine right ventricular preparations using an optical mapping system capable of high-resolution fluorescence imaging. Specifically, we quantify the spatial efficacy of alternans control along 2.5 cm of tissue, focusing on differences in spatial control between different subregions of tissue. We demonstrate effective control of spatially-extended alternans up to 2.0 cm, with control efficacy attenuating as a function of distance.

In vitro, VEGF enhanced the growth of endothelial and bone marrow cells seeded onto scaffolds. In vivo, High VEGF patches had greater blood vessel density (p < 0.01) than control at Day 7 and 28 due to increased cell recruitment and proliferation (p < 0.05 vs. control). At Day 28, VEGF-treated patches were significantly thicker (p < 0.05) than control, and thickness correlated positively with neovascularization (r = 0.67, p = 0.023).

However, their ability to participate in cardiovascular tissue restoration has not been elucidated yet. We employed a novel coculture system to investigate whether human EPCs have the capacity to integrate into living and ischaemic cardiac tissue, and participate to neovascularization. EPCs were cocultured with either living or ischaemic murine embryonic ventricular slices, in the presence or absence of a pro-angiogenic growth factor cocktail consisting of VEGF, IGF-1, EGF and bFGF. Tracking of EPCs within the cocultures was performed by cell transfection with green fluorescent protein or by immunostaining performed with anti-human vWF, CD31, nuclei and mitochondria antibodies. EPCs generated vascular tube-like structures in direct contact with the living ventricular slices. Furthermore, the pro-angiogenic growth factor cocktail reduced significantly tubes formation. Coculture of EPCs with the living ventricular slices in a transwell system did not lead to vascular tube-like structures formation, demonstrating that the direct contact is necessary and that the soluble factors secreted by the living slices were not sufficient for their induction. No vascular tubes were formed when EPCs were cocultured with ischaemic ventricular slices, even in the presence of the pro-angiogenic cocktail. In conclusion, EPCs form vascular tube-like structures in contact with living cardiac tissue and the direct cell-to-cell interaction is a prerequisite for their induction.

{"title": "Mitochondria-targeted cardioprotection in aldosteronism.", "abstract": "Chronic aldosterone/salt treatment (ALDOST) is accompanied by an adverse structural remodeling of myocardium that includes multiple foci of microscopic scarring representing morphologic footprints of cardiomyocyte necrosis. Our previous studies suggested that signal-transducer-effector pathway leading to necrotic cell death during ALDOST includes intramitochondrial Ca overloading, together with an induction of oxidative stress and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). To further validate this concept, we hypothesized that mitochondria-targeted interventions will prove to be cardioprotective. Accordingly, 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats receiving 4 weeks ALDOST were cotreated with either quercetin, a flavonoid with mitochondrial antioxidant properties, or cyclosporine A (CsA), an mPTP inhibitor, and compared with ALDOST alone or untreated, age/sex-matched controls. We monitored mitochondrial free Ca and biomarkers of oxidative stress, including 8-isoprostane and H2O2 production; mPTP opening; total Ca in cardiac tissue; and collagen volume fraction to quantify replacement fibrosis, a biomarker of cardiomyocyte necrosis, and employed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay to address apoptosis in coronal sections of ventricular myocardium. Compared with controls, at 4 weeks ALDOST we found a marked increase in mitochondrial H2O2 production and 8-isoprostane levels, an increased propensity for mPTP opening, and greater concentrations of mitochondrial free [Ca]m and total tissue Ca, coupled with a 5-fold rise in collagen volume fraction without any terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-based evidence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Each of these pathophysiologic responses to ALDOST was prevented by quercetin or cyclosporine A cotreatment.

The dysfunction of this timing system can result in cardiac pathology. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is crucial for circadian rhythms in a number of biological processes including SCN electrical activity and wheel running behavior. Anatomic evidence indicates that SCN neurons expressing VIP are well positioned to drive circadian regulation of cardiac function through interactions with the autonomic centers. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that loss of VIP would result in circadian deficits in heart rate (HR) and clock gene expression in cardiac tissue. We implanted radiotelemetry devices into VIP-deficient mice and wild-type (WT) controls and continuously recorded HR, body temperature, and cage activity in freely moving mice. Under light-dark conditions, VIP-deficient mice displayed weak rhythms in HR, body temperature, and cage activity, with onsets that were advanced in phase compared with WT mice. Similarly, clock gene expression in cardiac tissue was rhythmic but phase advanced in mutant mice. In constant darkness, the normal circadian rhythms in HR were lost in VIP-deficient mice; however, most mutant mice continued to exhibit circadian rhythms of body temperature with shortened free-running period. The loss of VIP altered, but did not abolish, autonomic regulation of HR. Analysis of the echocardiograms did not find any evidence for a loss of cardiac function in VIP-deficient mice, and the size of the hearts did not differ between genotypes.

{"title": "Iron-induced cardiac damage: role of apoptosis and deferasirox intervention.", "abstract": "Excess cardiac iron levels are associated with cardiac damage and can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Here, we hypothesize that elevations in tissue iron can activate caspase-dependent signaling, which leads to increased cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis, and that these alterations can be attenuated by iron chelation. Using an iron-overloaded gerbil model, we show that increased cardiac iron is associated with reduced activation of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308), diminished phosphorylation of the proapoptotic regulator Bad (Ser136), and an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. These iron-overload-induced alterations in Akt/Bad phosphorylation and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were coupled with increased activation of the downstream caspase-9 (40/38- and 17-kDa fragments) and apoptosis executioner caspase-3 (19- and 17-kDa fragments), which were accompanied by evidence of elevated cytoskeletal \u03b1-fodrin cleavage (150- and 120-kDa fragments), discontinuity of myocardial membrane dystrophin immunoreactivity, increases in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells (nucleic DNA fragmentation), and cardiac fibrosis.

The presence of a T cell-rich mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and the relative scarcity of parasites in the heart suggested that chronic inflammation secondary to the autoimmune recognition of cardiac proteins could be a major pathogenetic mechanism. Sera from CCC patients crossreactively recognize cardiac myosin and T. cruzi protein B13. T cell clones elicited from peripheral blood with T. cruzi B13 protein or its peptides could crossreactively recognize epitopes from cardiac myosin heavy chain. Likewise, CD4+ T cell clones infiltrating CCC myocardium crossreactively recognize cardiac myosin and T. cruzi protein B13, and intralesional T cell lines produce the inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. Conversely, IFN-\u03b3-induced genes and chemokines were found to be upregulated in CCC heart samples, and IFN-\u03b3 is able to induce cardiomyocyte expression of atrial natriuretic factor, a key member of the hypertrophy/heart failure signature.

The founder animals were created by microinjection and identified by PCR with specific primers for the EGFP sequence. The copy number of the transgene was quantified by real-time PCR using genomic DNA from blood cells. mRNA expression of EGFP-hRyR2-R4497C was quantified using RT-PCR with specific primers for the RyR2 and EGFP sequence.

{"title": "Middle age aggravates myocardial ischemia through surprising upholding of complex II activity, oxidative stress, and reduced coronary perfusion.", "abstract": "Aging compromises restoration of the cardiac mechanical function during reperfusion. We hypothesized that this was due to an ampler release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study aimed at characterising ex vivo the mitochondrial ROS release during reperfusion in isolated perfused hearts of middle-aged rats. Causes and consequences on myocardial function of the observed changes were then evaluated. The hearts of rats aged 10- or 52-week old were subjected to global ischemia followed by reperfusion. Mechanical function was monitored throughout the entire procedure. Activities of the respiratory chain complexes and the ratio of aconitase to fumarase activities were determined before ischemia and at the end of reperfusion. H(2)O(2) release was also evaluated in isolated mitochondria. During ischemia, middle-aged hearts displayed a delayed contracture, suggesting a maintained ATP production but also an increased metabolic proton production. Restoration of the mechanical function during reperfusion was however reduced in the middle-aged hearts, due to lower recovery of the coronary flow associated with higher mitochondrial oxidative stress indicated by the aconitase to fumarase ratio in the cardiac tissues. Surprisingly, activity of the respiratory chain complex II was better maintained in the hearts of middle-aged animals, probably because of an enhanced preservation of its membrane lipid environment. This can explain the higher mitochondrial oxidative stress observed in these conditions, since cardiac mitochondria produce much more H(2)O(2) when they oxidize FADH(2)-linked substrates than when they use NADH-linked substrates. In conclusion, the lower restoration of the cardiac mechanical activity during reperfusion in the middle-aged hearts was due to an impaired recovery of the coronary flow and an insufficient oxygen supply. The deterioration of the coronary perfusion was explained by an increased mitochondrial ROS release related to the preservation of complex II activity during reperfusion.", "journal": "Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)", "date": "2010-09-30", "authors": ["EvangeliaMourmoura", "MarieLeguen", "Herv\u00e9Dubouchaud", "KarineCouturier", "DamienVitiello", "Jean-LucLafond", "MelanieRichardson", "XavierLeverve", "LucDemaison"], "doi": "10.1007/s11357-010-9186-0\n10.1016/S0022-5223(96)70421-X\n10.1016/S0531-5565(99)00031-5\n10.1074/jbc.M310329200\n10.1016/S0014-2999(01)01417-0\n10.1016/j.exger.2004.06.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.01071.2006\n10.1016/j.mad.2004.11.001\n10.1074/jbc.M702294200\n10.1074/jbc.M802691200\n10.1074/jbc.M805403200\n10.1006/jsre.2001.6324\n10.1023/A:1011934603667\n10.1021/bi00839a041\n10.1006/abbi.1999.1508\n10.1073/pnas.91.25.12248\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00253-3\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0710\n10.1023/A:1015251212039\n10.1089/rej.2007.0609\n10.1016/S0047-6374(01)00242-1\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.12.020\n10.1080/10715760500315118\n10.1016/0009-8981(94)90270-4\n10.1373/clinchem.2005.050146\n10.1038/sj.ijo.0803779\n10.1002/0470868694.ch15\n10.1016/S0047-6374(00)00253-0\n10.1016/j.abb.2003.09.046\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2008.05.444\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1273\n10.1006/abbi.2000.2066\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.03.007\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2007.00271.x\n10.1007/s002280050589\n10.1016/0167-4943(96)00700-5\n10.1159/000063396\n10.1016/S1010-7940(03)00022-8\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.02.020\n10.1161/01.RES.0000109416.56608.64\n10.1007/s10863-006-9016-3\n10.1016/0047-6374(96)01732-0\n10.1093/cvr/cvm062\n10.1023/A:1007074330569\n10.1016/j.exger.2008.04.017\n10.1097/00000542-200403000-00019\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0533\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00256-9\n10.1016/S0022-5223(96)70194-0\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.12.012\n10.1007/s11095-007-9334-0\n10.1074/jbc.M601320200\n10.1016/j.exger.2003.08.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.09.014\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2008.03.025\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00351-1\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00409-6\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.02.061\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2006.04.029"}

Cultures of neonatal mouse ventricular cardiac myocytes (nMCM) were subjected to two distinct acute stress protocols; incubations with either endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or toxic cytokine, IL-1\u03b2. Myocyte injury was assessed in intracellular Ca(2+) signaling assays in fluo-3-loaded nMCMs that were imaged with high temporal resolution by fluorescent microscopy. Following LPS or IL-1\u03b2 treatment there was profound myocyte injury, manifest by chaotic [Ca(2+)](i) handling, quantified as a 3- to 5-fold increase in spontaneous [Ca(2+)](i) transients. Antibody neutralization experiments reveal such damage is mediated in part by interleukin-18 and not by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Importantly, normal [Ca(2+)](i) signaling was preserved when cardiomyocytes were co-cultured with hMSCs. Since normal [Ca(2+)](i) handling was maintained in transwell cultures, where nMCMs and hMSCs were separated by a permeable membrane, a protective paracrine signaling cascade is operable. hMSCs provoke a genetic reprogramming of cardiomyocytes. LPS provokes release of TNF\u03b1 from nMCMs which is blocked by hMSCs grown in co- or transwell cultures. Consistent with cytokine release, flow cytometry analyses reveal that hMSCs also block the LPS- and IL-1\u03b2-dependent activation of cardiac transcription factor, NF-\u03baB. Importantly, hMSC-conditioned medium restores normal Ca(2+) signaling in LPS- and IL-1\u03b2-damaged nMCMs. These results reveal new evidence that hMSCs elicit protective and reparative effects on cardiac tissue through molecular reprogramming of the cardiac myocytes themselves. Thus these studies provide novel new insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic benefit of hMSCs in the setting of heart failure.

We find that in infarcted heart, regions distant from the site of infarct are similar to healthy tissue in composition (mostly myocytes, very little collagen) and organization (densely packed myocytes), but infarct regions are characterized by sparse myocytes and high collagen content indicative of scar tissue formation. Stem cell treated hearts, in contrast, show regions of intertwined myocytes and collagen throughout the infarct, suggesting reduced tissue damage.

In order to mediate repair, stem cells need to replace injured tissue by differentiating into specialized cardiac cell lineages and/or manipulating the cell and molecular mechanisms governing repair. Despite early reports describing engraftment and successful regeneration of cardiac tissue in animal models of heart failure, these events appear to be infrequent and yield too few new cardiomyocytes to account for the degree of improved cardiac function observed. Instead, mounting evidence suggests that stem cell mediated repair takes place via the release of paracrine factors into the surrounding tissue that subsequently direct a number of restorative processes including myocardial protection, neovascularization, cardiac remodeling, and differentiation. The potential for diverse stem cell populations to moderate many of the same processes as well as key paracrine factors and molecular pathways involved in stem cell-mediated cardiac repair will be discussed in this review.

Therefore, improvements in the discrete formulation of the problem, which decrease computational and/or memory demands are highly desirable. In this study, we propose a novel technique for computing shape functions of finite elements (FEs). The technique generates macro FEs (MFEs) based on the local decomposition of elements into tetrahedral subelements with linear shape functions. Such an approach necessitates the direct use of hybrid meshes (HMs) composed of different types of elements. MFEs are compared to classic standard FEs with respect to accuracy and RAM memory usage under different scenarios of cardiac modeling, including bidomain and monodomain simulations in 2-D and 3-D for simple and complex tissue geometries. In problems with analytical solutions, MFEs displayed the same numerical accuracy of standard linear triangular and tetrahedral elements. In propagation simulations, conduction velocity and activation times agreed very well with those computed with standard FEs. However, MFEs offer a significant decrease in memory requirements.

Rat aortic EC-covered collagen gel modules were transplanted into the omental pouch of allogeneic (outbred) Sprague-Dawley rats with and without immunosuppressive drug treatment (atorvastatin and tacrolimus) for 3-60 days.

The present study was undertaken to explore the possible role of matrix-attached RGD peptide in the engineering of cardiac tissue within macroporous scaffolds. Neonatal rat cardiac cells were seeded into RGD-immobilized or unmodified alginate scaffolds. The immobilized RGD peptide promoted cell adherence to the matrix, prevented cell apoptosis and accelerated cardiac tissue regeneration. Within 6 days, the cardiomyocytes reorganized their myofibrils and reconstructed myofibers composed of multiple cardiomyocytes in a typical myofiber bundle. The nonmyocyte cell population, mainly cardiofibroblasts, benefited greatly from adhering to the RGD-alginate matrix and consequently supported the cardiomyocytes. They often surrounded bundles of cardiac myofibers in a manner similar to that of native cardiac tissue. The benefits of culturing the cardiac cells in RGD-immobilized alginate scaffolds were further substantiated by Western blotting, revealing that the relative expression levels of \u03b1-actinin, N-cadherin and connexin-43 were better maintained in cells cultured within these scaffolds.

In this study, we investigated whether human amniotic fluid-derived stem (hAFS) cells could be a potential source of cells for cardiac cell therapy, by testing the in vitro differentiation capabilities. Undifferentiated hAFS cells express several cardiac genes, including the transcription factor mef2, the gap junction connexin43, and H- and N-cadherin. A 24 h incubation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC) induced hAFS cell differentiation along the cardiac lineage. Evidence for this differentiation included morphological changes, upregulation of cardiac-specific genes (cardiac troponin I and cardiac troponin T) and redistribution of connexin43, as well as downregulation of the stem cell marker SRY-box 2 (sox2). When co-cultured with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCs), hAFS cells formed both mechanical and electrical connections with the NRCs. Dye transfer experiments showed that calcein dye could be transferred from NRCs to hAFS cells through cellular connections. The gap junction connexin43 likely involved in the communication between the two cell types, because 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) could partially block cellular crosstalk.

All phase III randomized trials and systematic reviews evaluating the role and modalities of RT in invasive BC were included, together with some noncontrolled studies if no randomized trials were identified. The quality and clinical relevance of the studies were evaluated to determine the level of evidence.\nThe maximum delay between surgery and RT should \u22648 weeks when chemotherapy (CT) is not indicated. This should not exceed 24 weeks when adjuvant CT is administered. Whole breast RT delivering 50 Gy in 25 fractions followed by a boost of 10-16 Gy remains the standard of care after conservative surgery (CS). In the elderly population, for certain cases presenting comorbidities associated with a limited life expectancy, RT indication (even hypofractioned) and boost delivery may be unnecessary in the light of an unfavourable risk/benefit ratio. RT technique and indications should not vary in case of neoadjuvant CT followed by CS. After total mastectomy, RT should be indicated in N+ and in N- patients with high risk of local recurrence. The experts recommend to initiate tamoxifen at the end of RT, while aromatase inhibitors could be administered either concomitantly or sequentially with RT. There is no consistent data to delay (or suspend) trastuzumab administration during RT. As for all patients, in case of concurrent RT-trastuzumab administration, reduction of cardiac tissues exposure is highly recommended.

NO is a key mediator of parasite killing in mice experimentally infected with T. cruzi, and previous studies have suggested that leukotrienes, such as LTB(4), induces NO synthesis in T. cruzi-infected macrophages and plays a relevant role in the killing of parasite in a NO-dependent manner. We therefore investigated whether leukotrienes would have a similar role in vivo in controlling the parasite burden by regulating NO activity. We have made the striking observation that absence of 5-LO-derived leukotrienes results in increased NO and IL-6 production in the plasma with a concomitant decrease in the expression of iNOS in the cardiac tissue on day 12 after T. cruzi infection.

{"title": "Enhanced protein repair and recycling are not correlated with longevity in 15 vertebrate endotherm species.", "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that longevity is associated with enhanced cellular stress resistance. This observation supports the disposable soma theory of aging, which suggests that the investment made in cellular maintenance will be proportional to selective pressures to extend lifespan. Maintenance of protein homeostasis is a critical component of cellular maintenance and stress resistance. To test the hypothesis that enhanced protein repair and recycling activities underlie longevity, we measured the activities of the 20S/26S proteasome and two protein repair enzymes in liver, heart and brain tissues of 15 different mammalian and avian species with maximum lifespans (MLSP) ranging from 3 to 30\u00a0years. The data set included Snell dwarf mice, in which lifespan is increased by \u223c50% compared to their normal littermates. None of these activities in any of the three tissues correlated positively with MLSP. In liver, 20S/26S proteasome and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activities correlated negatively with body mass. In brain tissue, TrxR was also negatively correlated with body mass.

Transfer of skeletal myoblasts into decompensated hearts has been performed through intramyocardial injection. However, the achievements of both cardiomyocyte differentiation and precise integration of the injected cells into the myocardial wall, in order to augment synchronized contractility and avoid potentially life-threatening alterations in the electrical conduction of the heart, still remain a major target to be pursued. Recently, granulocytes colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) fuelled the interest of researchers for its direct effect on cardiomyocytes, inhibiting both apoptosis and remodelling in the failing heart and protecting from ventricular arrhythmias through the up-regulation of connexin 43 (Cx43). We propose a tissue engineering approach concerning the fabrication of an electrospun cardiac graft functionalized with G-CSF, in order to provide the correct signalling sequence to orientate myoblast differentiation and exert important systemic and local effects, positively modulating the infarction microenvironment. Poly-(L-lactide) electrospun scaffolds were seeded with C2C12 murine skeletal myoblast for 48 hrs. Biological assays demonstrated the induction of Cx43 expression along with morphostructural changes resulting in cell elongation and appearance of cellular junctions resembling the usual cardiomyocyte arrangement at the ultrastructural level.

Recent evidence suggests that statins may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure. The present study was planned to investigate the anti-apoptotic potential of rosuvastatin pretreatment in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.\nSixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: Group-I (vehicle control group), Group-II (pathological Control group), Group-III (rosuvastatin 0.5 mg/kg), Group IV (rosuvastatin 2 mg/kg), Group-V (rosuvastatin 2 mg/kg per se), and Group-VI (carvedilol 1mg/kg). Myocardial apoptosis was detected by caspase-3 assay, DNA gel electrophoresis and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase estimation. The animals were evaluated for various biochemical parameters in serum followed by histopathological studies of heart tissue.\nDoxorubicin treated rats exhibited cardiac dysfunctions as indicated by an increase in systolic, diastolic, mean BP, heart rate and tail blood flow and volume and increased serum LDH, TC, TGs, LDL-C, VLDL-C levels and atherogenic indexes. A marked induction in caspase-3 and Na(+)-K(+) ATPase levels and DNA laddering as revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis was observed in rat myocardium of pathological group. Pretreatment with the test drug, rosuvastatin significantly reduced the increase in hemodynamic parameters, serum LDH, lipid profile and myocardial caspase-3, Na(+)-K(+) ATPase activity as compared to the pathogenic control group. Further, DNA ladder formation was attenuated by rosuvastatin treatment. Histopathological studies further confirm its myocardial salvaging effects.

However, because non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, are taken during the infarction, it becomes critical to know whether the NSAIDs have negative impacts on heart tissue regeneration when using hESCs.\nMass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were used to analyze the functional presence of the elaborate prostanoids' biosynthesis and signaling systems in hESCs. The detected endogenous arachidonic acid (AA) released in the hESC membranes reflects the activity of phospholipase which directly controls the biosyntheses of the prostanoids.\nThe complete inhibition of the endogenous prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) biosynthesis by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, NS398, confirmed that the major prostanoids synthesized in the hESCs are mediated by the COX-2 enzyme. We also found that PGE(2) and the prostacyclin (PGI(2)) metabolite, 6-keto-PGF(1\u03b1), are present in the undifferentiated hESCs.\nThis indicated different cyclooxygenase (COX)-downstream synthases and metabolizing enzymes are involved in the AA products' signaling through the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways.

Recent studies have shown that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has cardioprotective effects. Hence, we aimed to elucidate the potential effects of H2S on HF after MI in rats. The HF model after MI was made by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. HF groups and sham-operated groups of rats were treated with vehicle, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) or PAG (propagylglycine). Equal volumes of saline, 3.136 mg \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 day-1 NaHS or 37.5 mg \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 day-1 PAG, were intraperitoneally injected into rats for 6 weeks after operation. Survival, lung-to-body weight ratio and left ventricular haemodynamic parameters were measured. The protein and gene expression of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 and cytochrome c were analysed by Western blotting and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR). TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling) and EM (electron microscopy) were used to examine apoptosis of heart tissues. NaHS was found to improve the survival and lower the lung-to-body weight ratio. It increased the LVSP (left ventricular systolic pressure) and the maximum rate of pressure and decreased LVEDP (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure). Furthermore, NaHS promoted Bcl-2 protein and mRNA expression and demoted Bax, caspase 3 protein and mRNA expression in HF rats. We also showed that NaHS decreased the leakage of cytochrome c protein from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. Histological observation by TUNEL and EM proved that NaHS inhibited cardiac apoptosis in HF hearts and improved mitochondrial derangements, but that PAG aggravated those indices.

Electron microscopy showed that ultrastructures of the cytoplasm and mitochondria in scallop hearts were badly damaged, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed 32 protein spots that were differentially expressed after exposure to 10 mg/l CdCl\u2082 for 24 h. Of these spots, 8 were upregulated, 16 were downregulated, and 8 showed low expression. Proteins from these spots were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and database searching. The results indicated that these proteins are involved in the regulation of cell structure, transport, signal transduction, and metabolism. Among other things, four proteins-identified as amino acid adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase, and ATPase-were demonstrated to be especially associated with Cd toxicity.

Given that characteristics of dilated cardiomyopathy closely associate with atherosclerosis and are mediated by an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and TIMPs, we hypothesized that PARP-1 gene deletion may protect against HF-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dilatations by altering TIMP-2/MMPs balance in favor of a maintenance of tissue homeostasis.\nHemodynamic parameters determined by echocardiography were similar in ApoE(-/-) mice and PARP-1-deficient ApoE(-/-) mice (DKO) fed a regular diet (RD). However, histological analysis revealed that cardiomyocytes of ApoE(-/-) mice on RD were hypertrophied, displaying an enlarged cell body and nucleus, traits that were absent in DKO animals. HF diet-fed ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited increased interventricular septum, left ventricular (LV) internal dimension, LV volume, and LV mass in addition to a separation of myocardial fibers suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy. PARP-1 gene deletion protected against these degenerative changes. MMP activity was dramatically increased in hearts of ApoE(-/-) mice on HF diet and was accompanied by increased collagen degradation, mast cell degranulation, and increased myocyte cell death. PARP-1 gene knockout was associated with increased TIMP-2 expression antagonizing, as a result, the damaging effects of active MMPs.\nThe present study demonstrates that PARP-1 gene deletion exerts protective effects against HF diet-induced dilated cardiomyopathy by maintaining increased expression of TIMP-2.

On the contrary, no pentraxin 3 was observed in normal heart areas. In early ischemic lesions, pentraxin 3 was localized primarily in granulocytes; in more advanced acute myocardial infarction, pentraxin 3 positivity was found in the interstitium and in the cytoplasm of macrophages and the endothelium, whereas most granulocytes did not express pentraxin 3, presumably as a consequence of degranulation. In infectious myocarditis, pentraxin 3 was present and localized within and around histological lesions, associated with macrophage, endothelial cell, and, more rarely, myocardiocyte and granulocyte positivities.

Conduction velocity restitution is the simplest non-trivial spatially extended problem in excitable media, and in the case of cardiac tissue it is an important tool for prediction of cardiac arrhythmias and fibrillation. An idealized conduction velocity restitution curve requires solving a non-linear eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions, which in the cardiac case is very stiff and calls for the use of asymptotic methods. We compare asymptotics of restitution curves in four examples, two generic excitable media models, and two ionic cardiac models. The generic models include the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo model and its variation by Barkley. They are treated with standard singular perturbation techniques. The ionic models include a simplified \"caricature\" of Noble (J. Physiol. Lond. 160:317-352, 1962) model and Beeler and Reuter (J. Physiol.

Overfeeding significantly enhanced Foxo3a phosphorylation in both ventricles, while protein expression of Akt, Foxo3a, GSK3\u03b2 and caspase-8 as well as phosphorylated Akt and GSK3\u03b2 in either ventricle was unaffected. Overfeeding increased left ventricular mTOR, NFATc3 (both total and phosphorylated) and calcineurin A. GATA4, pGATA4 and ANF expression were unchanged in both ventricles. Collectively, our data suggested that overfeeding during early to mid gestation (D75) leads to morphometric changes without overt pathology which may be related to elevated expression of mTOR, NFATc3, calcineurin A and phosphorylation of Foxo3a, mTOR and NFATc3.", "journal": "The Journal of nutritional biochemistry", "date": "2010-03-02", "authors": ["XiujuanFan", "SubatTurdi", "Stephen PFord", "YinanHua", "Mark JNijland", "MeijunZhu", "Peter WNathanielsz", "JunRen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.11.006"}
{"title": "Inhibitory effect of Ruta graveolens L. on oxidative damage, inflammation and aortic pathology in hypercholesteromic rats.", "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to investigate the efficacy of methanolic extract of Ruta graveolens L. in reducing oxidative damage, inflammation and aortic pathology in hypercholesteremic rats. For the study rats were divided into three groups - control group, hypercholesteremic group and treatment group (20 mg MER/kg/d orally) - and were fed for 90 days. Serum total cholesterol, LDL-C, total WBC count, CRP level, TBARS, atherogenic index, activities of COX, 15 LOX in monocyte and serum myeloperoxidase were increased in cholesterol fed rats. Activities of antioxidant enzymes and the concentration reduced glutathione in liver and heart tissue and serum HDL-C were decreased in cholesterol fed rats. The results showed that level of total cholesterol, LDL-C, atherogenic index was decreased and HDL-C was increased in MER treated rats. Activities of antioxidant enzymes were found to be increased and the activity of MPO, COX and 15 LOX were decreased on supplementation with MER. Concentration of TBARS and total WBC count were decreased and GSH was increased on supplementation with MER. Histopathology of aorta of cholesterol fed rat showed marked alterations whereas the aorta of MER administrated rat showed no significant changes. These results suggested that MER reduces oxidative stress, inflammation and aortic pathology in hypercholesteremic rats. Thus the plant may therefore be useful for therapeutic treatment of clinical conditions associated atherosclerosis.", "journal": "Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie", "date": "2010-02-19", "authors": ["MRatheesh", "G LShyni", "GSindhu", "AHelen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.etp.2010.01.007"}
{"title": "Repair of senescent myocardium by mesenchymal stem cells is dependent on the age of donor mice.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of mortality in aged people. Whether age of donors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) affects its ability to repair the senescent heart tissue is unknown. In the present study, MSCs from young (2 months) and aged (18 months) green fluorescent protein expressing C57BL/6 mice were characterized with p16(INK4a) and \u03b2-gal associated senescence. Myocardial infarction was produced in 18-month-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice transplanted with MSCs from young and aged animals in the border of the infarct region. Expression of p16(INK4a) in MSCs from aged animals was significantly higher (21.5%\u00b1 1.2, P < 0.05) as compared to those from young animals (9.2%\u00b1 2.8). A decline in the tube-forming ability on Matrigel was also observed in aged MSCs as well as down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) compared to young cells. Mice transplanted with young MSCs exhibited significant improvement in their left ventricle (LV) systolic and diastolic function as demonstrated by dp/dt(max) , dp/dt(min) , P(max) . Reduction in the LV fibrotic area was concomitant with neovascularization as demonstrated by CD31 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression. Real-time RT-PCR analysis for VEGF, stromal cell derived factor (SDF-1\u03b1) and GATA binding factor 4 (GATA-4) genes further confirmed the effect of age on MSC differentiation towards cardiac lineages and enhanced angiogenesis. These studies lead to the conclusion that repair potential of MSCs is dependent on the age of donors and the repair of senescent infarcted myocardium requires young healthy MSCs.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["MohsinKhan", "SadiaMohsin", "Shaheen NKhan", "SheikhRiazuddin"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00998.x"}
{"title": "Aspartate and glutamate prevents isoproterenol-induced cardiac toxicity by alleviating oxidative stress in rats.", "abstract": "The protective effect of aspartate and glutamate in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction (MI) was investigated in experimental animals. Male albino wistar rats were pretreated with aspartate [100mg (kg body weight)-1 day-1] or glutamate [100mg (kg body weight)-1 day-1] intraperitoneally for a period of 7 days. Following amino acid treatment, MI was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol [200mg (kg body weight)-1 day-1] for 2 days. After 24h following the last injection, the animals were sacrificed and the biochemical analysis was carried out. The activities of cardiac marker enzymes (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase) were increased significantly (P<0.05) in the serum of MI induced rats as compared to control rats. The levels of glutathione and mitochondrial ATP and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase) were decreased whereas lipid peroxides increased significantly (P<0.05) in the heart of MI induced rats as compared to control rats. However, pretreatment with aspartate or glutamate to MI induced rats significantly (P<0.05) reduced the activities of cardiac marker enzymes and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes as compared to MI induced rats. Aspartate or glutamate pretreatment also increased the levels of glutathione and mitochondrial ATP while decreased the level of lipid peroxides in the cardiac tissue. The overall effects of aspartate and glutamate in reducing the oxidative stress in MI induced rats are similar. There was no significant difference between the control rats and aspartate or glutamate treated control rats. The present study shows that aspartate and glutamate could reduce oxidative stress in MI induced rats.", "journal": "Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie", "date": "2009-12-08", "authors": ["RamalingamSivakumar", "Pon Velayutham AnandhBabu", "Chennam SrinivasuluShyamaladevi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.etp.2009.10.008"}
{"title": "Chemopreventive doses of resveratrol do not produce cardiotoxicity in a rodent model of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most lethal cancers, results in more than one million fatalities worldwide every year. In view of the limited therapeutic alternatives and poor prognosis of liver cancer, preventive control approaches, notably chemoprevention, have been considered to be the best strategy in lowering the present prevalence of the disease. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring antioxidant and antiinflammatory agent found in grapes and red wine, inhibits carcinogenesis with a pleiotropic mode of action. Recently, we have reported that dietary resveratrol significantly prevents chemically-induced liver tumorigenesis in rats. One of the mechanisms of resveratrol-mediated chemoprevention of hepatocarcinogenesis could be related to its antiinflammatory action through hepatic cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibition. Although several COX-2 inhibitors are known to exert chemopreventive efficacy, not all are considered ideal candidates for chemoprevention due to the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the role of resveratrol on cardiac performance during experimental hepatocarcinogenesis initiated with diethylnitrosamine and promoted by phenobarbital. Rats had free access to diet supplemented with resveratrol four weeks before the carcinogen injection and 14 weeks thereafter. The cardiotoxicity of resveratrol was assessed by monitoring the cardiac function using transthoracic echocardiography as well as Western blot analysis of cardiac tissue. Long-term dietary administration of resveratrol dose-dependently suppressed hepatic tumor multiplicity, the principal endpoint for evaluating the chemopreventive potential of a candidate agent. The chemopreventive effects of resveratrol were also reflected in histopathological assessment of hepatic tissues. Resveratrol did not exhibit any cardiotoxicity but rather improved the cardiac function in a dose-responsive fashion. Our results indicate that resveratrol-mediated chemoprevention of rat liver carcinogenesis is devoid of any adverse cardiovascular events. Resveratrol may be developed as a chemopreventive as well as therapeutic drug for human HCC.", "journal": "Investigational new drugs", "date": "2009-10-09", "authors": ["Daniel JLuther", "VahagnOhanyan", "Patricia EShamhart", "Cheryl MHodnichak", "HamayakSisakian", "Tristan DBooth", "J GaryMeszaros", "AnupamBishayee"], "doi": "10.1007/s10637-009-9332-7"}
{"title": "Mitochondrial DNA depletion and fatal infantile hepatic failure due to mutations in the mitochondrial polymerase \u03b3 (POLG) gene: a combined morphological/enzyme histochemical and immunocytochemical/biochemical and molecular genetic study.", "abstract": "Combined morphological, immunocytochemical, biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on skeletal muscle, heart muscle and liver tissue of a 16-months boy with fatal liver failure. The pathological characterization of the tissues revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) that was most pronounced in liver, followed by a less severe, but still significant depletion in skeletal muscle and the heart. The primary cause of the disease was linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the polymerase \u03b3 (POLG) gene (DNA polymerase \u03b3; A467T, K1191N). We present evidence, that compound heterozygous POLG mutations lead to tissue selective impairment of mtDNA replication and thus to a mosaic defect pattern even in the severely affected liver. A variable defect pattern was found in liver, muscle and heart tissue as revealed by biochemical, cytochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization analysis. Functionally, a severe deficiency of cytochrome-c-oxidase (cox) activity was seen in the liver. Although mtDNA depletion was detected in heart and skeletal muscle, there was no cox deficiency in these tissues. Depletion of mtDNA and microdissection of cox-positive or negative areas correlated with the histological pattern in the liver. Interestingly, the mosaic pattern detected for cox-activity and mtDNA copy number fully aligned with the immunohistologically revealed defect pattern using Pol \u03b3, mtSSB- and mtTFA-antibodies, thus substantiating the hypothesis that nuclear encoded proteins located within mitochondria become unstable and are degraded when they are not actively bound to mtDNA. Their disappearance could also aggravate the mtDNA depletion and contribute to the non-homogenous defect pattern.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2009-06-23", "authors": ["JM\u00fcller-H\u00f6cker", "RHorvath", "SSch\u00e4fer", "HHessel", "WM\u00fcller-Felber", "JK\u00fchr", "W CCopeland", "PSeibel"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00819.x"}

MELAS, which is characterised by mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes due to gene mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (adenine-to-guanine transition at nucleotide pair 3243, m.3243A>G), constitutes such a mitochondrial multisystemic disease. Although hypertrophied or dilated cardiomyopathy is quite common in MELAS, there have been no cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-based studies in these patients so far. This case report represents the first case in which comprehensive CMR and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) data were obtained in the same patient with mitochondrial myopathy.
