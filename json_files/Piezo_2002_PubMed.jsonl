The sensing films were not only immobilized easily and reproducibly, but also used to improve the reversibility of the sensor signal. The response characteristics show the response of CA to organic amine attributes to specific interaction between CA[n] (host) and organic amines (guest). The frequency shifts of n-butylamine and iso-butylamine are much larger than tert-butylamine and diethylamine because of shape-selection and hydrogen bonding. Compared to CA[6] and CA[4], CA[8] has highest sensitivity to organic amine due to having more flexibility to accommodate guest molecules. A sensor array with three-layer back-propagation neural network was applied to detect the binary mixture of n-butylamine in the range of 7.14-142 mull(-1) and iso-butylamine in the range of 7.14-57 mull(-1). The optimum values of learning rate (0.15) and momentum term (0.8) were determined by experiment. The best epoch of training was 1098.

QCMs coated with such oligonucleotide probes were exposed to test solutions containing viral RNA for hybridization. Various experimental conditions evaluated were (i) DNA probe coating concentration, (ii) sensitivity and specificity of the probes at different hybridization temperatures, and (iii) effects of incubation temperature on the hybridization time. The specific nucleotide probe-coated QCM-based DNA sensors were able to detect both CymMV and ORSV in quantities as low as approximately 1 ng in purified RNA preparations and 10 ng in the crude sap of infected orchids.

Data were also collected for splash dispersal using tracer dyes in laboratory experiments and the Long Ashton splashmeter in field experiments. Droplets impacting on sensor produce sound waves that are detected by an omnidirectional microphone sealed within an acoustic chamber. An electrical charge, proportional to the sound wave, is produced by the microphone and is converted to a categorical scale and then stored to provide an accumulation of impacts over a specified period of time. Calibration of the sensor was done using single-droplet impacts of known mass and impacting velocity. A linear relationship was shown between the categorical scale and the kinetic energy of impacting droplets (adjusted r(2) = 0.99). The best relationship fitted between splash dispersal from dye cup, and kinetic energy was a second-order polynomial (adjusted r(2) > 0.99). Splash height, recorded by the Long Ashton splashmeter during 41 natural rainfall events, was correlated closely with sensor output (adjusted r(2) = 0.87).

This advice is far from universally honored in practice. In part, this dichotomy between 'accepted wisdom' and actual day-to-day practice may stem from a failure to provide the clinician with a peripheral nerve stimulator that does not require subjective evaluation of evoked responses. For 99% of anesthetists, the train-of-four fade ratio is a parameter that they read about but cannot measure. This need no longer be the case.\nSmall battery operated units are now available that are relatively inexpensive, easy to set up, and provide objective measurement of the train-of-four ratio. Although agreement between the output of these acceleromyographic and piezoelectric sensors with such 'gold standard' technologies as mechanomyography and electromyography is not absolute, it is probably adequate for clinical case management.\nIt is my hope (and I have no financial interest in any of the cited devices) that the present review will encourage further distribution of objective monitors of neuromuscular function.", "journal": "Current opinion in anaesthesiology", "date": "2006-10-05", "authors": ["Aaron FKopman"], "doi": "10.1097/00001503-200208000-00002"}

{"title": "Bubble-induced acoustic micromixing.", "abstract": "A mixing technique based on the principle of bubble-induced acoustic microstreaming was developed. The mixer consists of a piezoelectric disk that is attached to a reaction chamber, which is designed in such a way that a set of air bubbles with desirable size is trapped in the solution. Fluidic experiments showed that air bubbles resting on a solid surface and set into vibration by the sound field generated steady circulatory flows, resulting in global convection flows and thus rapid mixing. The time to fully mix a 22 microL chamber is significantly reduced from hours (for a pure diffusion-based mixing) to tens of seconds. Numerical simulations showed that the induced flowfield and thus degree of mixing strongly depend on bubble positions. Optimal simulated mixing results were obtained for staggered bubble distribution that minimizes the number of internal flow stagnation regions. Immunomagnetic cell capture experiments showed that acoustic microstreaming provided efficient mixing of bacterial cell (Esherichia coli K12) matrix suspended in blood with magnetic capture beads, resulting in highly effective immunomagnetic cell capture. Bacterial viability assay experiments showed that acoustic microstreaming has a relatively low shear strain field since the blood cells and bacteria remained intact after mixing.

The vibrational characteristics of two dry skulls, in comparison to a live human head, were measured in the 2- to 52-kHz range. White noise was played and received through piezoelectric transducers and was Fourier-analyzed. Complex resonances and antiresonances were found in both the dry skulls and the live head and varied with small changes in the position of the transducers. There were also pronounced differences between the skulls. In comparison to the skulls, the live head showed greater attenuation and less prominent resonances and antiresonances, reflecting greater damping. The attenuation of the skulls and the head did not increase consistently with frequency but was dominated by resonances at a variety of frequencies.

Our objective was to define the focal expansion of a new ultrasound generator and to evaluate the extent of tissue ablation under variable generator parameters in an ex vivo model.\nAxial and transversal distribution of ultrasound intensity in the area of the focal point was calculated by needle hydrophone. The extent of tissue necrosis after focused ultrasound was assessed in an ex vivo porcine kidney model applying generator power up to 400 Watt and pulse duration up to 8 s.\nThe measurement of field distribution revealed a physical focal size of 32 x 4 mm. Sharp demarcation between coagulation necrosis and intact tissue was observed in our tissue model. Lesion size was kept under control by variation of both generator power and impulse duration. At a constant impulse duration of 2 s, generator power of 100 W remained below the threshold doses for induction of a reproducible lesion. An increase in power up to 200 W and 400 W, respectively, induced lesions with diameters up to 11.2 x 3 mm. Constant total energy (generator power x impulse duration) led to a larger lesion size under higher generator power.\nIt is possible to induce sharply demarcated, reproducible thermonecrosis, which can be regulated by generator power and impulse duration, by means of a cylindrical piezo element with a paraboloid reflector at a focal distance of 10 cm.

A high efficiency of grooved reflector for plate acoustic waves was theoretically revealed. Experimental results for mass loading and grooved reflections, which have been obtained for an SH0 wave propagating in the Y-X lithium niobate plate, are in a good agreement with the theory. They show a high efficiency of such reflectors and confirm an opportunity of using a model based on equivalent circuit for the analysis of their operation. Investigations indicate that nearly 100% reflection of the SH0 wave in the lithium niobate plate can be obtained with the use of a mass loading reflector containing 10 silver strips of thickness d/h = 0.08 or a grooved reflector containing eight grooves of depth d/h = 0.25.

For imaging experiments, we built a resolution test phantom roughly mimicking the attenuation properties of soft tissue. We used a PC-based experimental system, including custom-designed electronic circuits to acquire the complete set of 128 x 128 RF A-scans from all transmit-receive element combinations. We obtained the pulse-echo frequency response by analyzing the echo signals from wire targets. These echo signals presented an 80% fractional bandwidth around 3 MHz, including the effect of attenuation in the propagating medium.

By using a new truncation procedure, second-order equations for piezoelectric plates with faces in contact with either vacuums or electrodes are extracted from the aforementioned infinite systems of equations, respectively. The second-order equations for plates with or without electrodes are shown to predict accurate dispersion curves by comparing to the corresponding curves from the 3-D equations in a range up to the cut-off frequencies of the first symmetric thickness-stretch and the second symmetric thickness-shear modes without introducing any correction factors. Furthermore, a system of 1-D second-order equations for strips with rectangular cross section is deduced from the 2-D second-order equations by averaging variables across the narrow width of the plate. The present 1-D equations are used to study the extensional vibrations of barium titanate strips of finite length and narrow rectangular cross section.

{"title": "The origin of the piezoelectric effect in pyroelectric crystals.", "abstract": "The physical mechanism of piezoelectricity arising in crystals of all pyroelectric classes is described and discussed in detail. The piezoelectric effect of these crystals is postulated to be a consequence of changes in their spontaneous polarization under the impact of external forces (electric fields, mechanical stresses). This study shows which piezoelectric coefficients do exist in pyroelectric crystals. Both the direct piezoeffect--generation of electric polarization under mechanical stresses--and the inverse piezoeffect--crystal deformations caused by the application of an electric field--are considered. Specifically, the analysis performed suggests that crystals of classes 6, 4, and 3 may lack d14 and d25 piezo modules, the existence of which is, in principle, allowed by the symmetry of the crystals, but which do not actually exist because of the accidental cancellation of requisite \"piezo-generating\" elastic compliance coefficients.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-12-18", "authors": ["Sergey VBogdanov"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2002.1049727"}
{"title": "Direct measurement of human ankle stiffness during quiet standing: the intrinsic mechanical stiffness is insufficient for stability.", "abstract": "During quiet standing the human \"inverted pendulum\" sways irregularly. In previous work where subjects balanced a real inverted pendulum, we investigated what contribution the intrinsic mechanical ankle stiffness makes to achieve stability. Using the results of a plausible model, we suggested that intrinsic ankle stiffness is inadequate for providing stability. Here, using a piezo-electric translator we applied small, unobtrusive mechanical perturbations to the foot while the subject was standing freely. These short duration perturbations had a similar size and velocity to movements which occur naturally during quiet standing, and they produced no evidence of any stretch reflex response in soleus, or gastrocnemius. Direct measurement confirms our earlier conclusion; intrinsic ankle stiffness is not quite sufficient to stabilise the body or pendulum. On average the directly determined intrinsic stiffness is 91 +/- 23 % (mean +/- S.D.) of that necessary to provide minimal stabilisation. The stiffness was substantially constant, increasing only slightly with ankle torque. This stiffness cannot be neurally regulated in quiet standing. Thus we attribute this stiffness to the foot, Achilles' tendon and aponeurosis rather than the activated calf muscle fibres. Our measurements suggest that the triceps surae muscles maintain balance via a spring-like element which is itself too compliant to guarantee stability. The implication is that the brain cannot set ankle stiffness and then ignore the control task because additional modulation of torque is required to maintain balance. We suggest that the triceps surae muscles maintain balance by predictively controlling the proximal offset of the spring-like element in a ballistic-like manner.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2002-12-17", "authors": ["Ian DLoram", "MartinLakie"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2002.025049"}

The reflection-intensity data for LNG and LTG were collected at pressures of up to 22.8 GPa and 16.7 GPa, respectively. Both compounds show anisotropic behaviour under pressure, which is caused by differences in bonding parallel to the a and c directions. The compression of strongly rigid structures leads to increasing internal strains and results, at pressures of 12.4 (3) GPa for LNG and 11.7 (3) GPa for LTG, in a transition to lower symmetry. The compressibilities along the c axis are almost the same for LNG and LTG through the whole investigated pressure range. In contrast, the pressure dependencies of the a axis of these materials are similar only for the initial phase, and the axial compressibilities for the high-pressure polymorphs of LNG and LTG are significantly different to each other. The volume compressibilities of trigonal LNG and LTG (space group P321) are about 0.007 GPa(-1); respective bulk moduli are 145 (3) GPa and 144 (2) GPa.

Using a 50 mm lever, synthesised micromotions with an amplitude of 1 microm could be detected (noise level < 0.2 microm) at static indentation forces ranging from 0.1 to 2 N. Then the galvanometer was mounted on an isometric ankle dynamometer to sense calf-muscle responses (N = 6). In the first protocol, twitch contractions were elicited by electrical stimulation while the indentation force was increased. Twitch amplitudes, twitch contraction times and twitch half-relaxation times were analysed from the surface and contraction responses. With indentation force (0.1-0.5 N), the amplitude of the surface responses increased (+61%), contraction and half-relaxation times, however, were not influenced. The mean twitch contraction time from the surface responses (60 +/- 11 ms) was shorter than that from the contraction responses (115 +/- 7 ms), indicating more fast-contracting fibres under the indented area. In the second protocol, voluntary target contractions were produced, and the surface responses were simultaneously recorded on an accelerometer. After double differentiation of the galvanometer signal, both acceleration MMGs showed a high coincidence in the time and frequency domains. With an indentation force of 2 N applied on the accelerometer, the signal amplitude (-10%) and the mean frequency (-19%) decreased.

Repetitive yields of even the most insoluble peptides were such that the sequences of various peptides from relatively complex mixtures of peptides could be assigned with confidence. Despite the overall success of the sequencing, we occasionally referred to electron density maps, calculated for crystals of the Fab of Yvo IgM, to resolve particular sequences and confirm ambiguous amino acid assignments.

For the experimental concentration range of 0-50 mM, unexpectedly the QCM impedance does not follow the Kanazawa equation, as is usual for bulk newtonian liquids. This behavior indicates the presence of a nanometric sized viscoelastic layer between the piezoelectric crystal and the bulk electrolyte solution. This layer can only be identified as the Gouy-Chapman diffuse double layer (DDL). Its elasticity and viscosity have been estimated by the measurement of R and XL.

{"title": "Design principles of liquid nebulization devices currently in use.", "abstract": "Liquid nebulization is a common method of medical aerosol generation. Nebulizers are of 2 types: jet (or pneumatic) small-volume nebulizer, and ultrasonic nebulizer. Jet nebulizers are based on the venturi principle, whereas ultrasonic nebulizers use the converse piezoelectric effect to convert alternating current to high-frequency acoustic energy. Important variables for both types of nebulizer are treatment time required, particle size produced, and aerosol drug output. There are several advantages to jet nebulization, including that effective use requires only simple, tidal breathing, and that dose modification and dose compounding are possible. Disadvantages include the length of treatment time and equipment size. Design modifications to the constant-output nebulizer have resulted in breath-enhanced, open-vent nebulizers such as the Pari LC Plus and the dosimetric AeroEclipse. Ultrasonic nebulizers generally have a higher output rate than jet nebulizers, but a larger average particle size. Ultrasonic nebulizers can also substantially increase reservoir solution temperature, the opposite of jet nebulizer cooling. Drug concentration in the reservoir does not increase with ultrasonic nebulization, as it does with jet nebulization. Ultrasonic nebulizers have the same advantages as jet nebulizers. Ultrasonic nebulizers are more expensive and fragile than jet nebulizers, may cause drug degradation, and do not nebulize suspensions well.

Six different structural phases have been observed for PZT at ambient pressure, each with different lattice parameters and average electric polarization. It is of significant interest to understand the microscopic origin of the complicated phase diagram and local structure of PZT. Here, using density functional theory calculations, we show that the distortions of the material away from the parent perovskite structure can be predicted from the local arrangement of the Zr and Ti cations. We use the chemical rules obtained from density functional theory to create a phenomenological model to simulate PZT structures.

{"title": "Damping, amplitude, aging tests of stacked transducers for shock wave generation.", "abstract": "New clinical concepts in lithotripsy demand small shock heads. Reducing the size of piezoelectric shock heads will be possible only if the pressure generated at the surface of each transducer can be increased so that the total pressure at the focus remains the same. To solve this problem, different solutions were proposed. For example, it has been demonstrated that piezocomposite material, as opposed to piezoceramic material, allows the generation of a higher surface pressure before breaking, mainly because radial modes are dramatically reduced. In addition, in a previous paper, we showed the feasibility of generating high-pressure pulse waves without increasing the transducer voltage by using sandwiched transducers, which are a stack of two or more transducers. Some discrepancies appeared, however, between the pressure measured at the surface of the front transducer and the arithmetic sum of the pressures generated by each transducer constituting the stack. In fact, development of such stacked transducers capable of generating surface pressures in the range of 2 to 5 MPa is very complex, which may explain why no aging tests have been reported in the literature thus far. In the first part of this paper, we theoretically determine the importance of the electroacoustical coupling between the two transducers on the generated surface pressure. We show that pressure losses due to these electroacoustical couplings are less than 5%. Experimental measurements done on a stacked transducer assembled and tightened in a castor oil-filled tank are in excellent accordance with the theoretical measurements. Using this assembly technique, it was possible to obtain, on average, out of four elements, a pressure of 7.5 MPa for the duration of 4 million shocks, which would allow the treatment of approximately 1000 patients.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-10-31", "authors": ["Jean-PierreSferruzza", "AlainBirer", "Fran\u00e7oiseChavrier", "DominiqueCathignol"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2002.1041087"}

Previous research has shown transdermal delivery of insulin across skin using commercial sonicators operating at 20 kHz with intensities ranging from 12.5 to 225 mW/cm2. The goal of this research was to design and construct a small, lightweight transducer or array that could operate with a similar frequency and intensity range as a commercial sonicator used in previous transdermal ultrasound insulin experiments, but without the weight and mass of a sonicator probe. To obtain this intensity range, a cymbal transducer design was chosen because of its light, compact structure and low resonance frequency in water. To increase the spatial ultrasound field for drug delivery across skin, two arrays, each comprising of four cymbal transducers, were constructed. The first array, designated the standard array, used four cymbals transducer elements in parallel. A second array (named the stack array) used four cymbal transducers that used stacked piezoelectric discs to drive the titanium flextensional caps. Under similar driving conditions, the standard array produced intensities comparable to those achieved using a commercial sonicator.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-10-31", "authors": ["EmilianoMaione", "K KirkShung", "Richard JMeyer", "Jack WHughes", "Robert ENewnham", "Nadine BarrieSmith"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2002.1041084"}

In this study, we have compared the two most common procedures for transferring nuclei to enucleated oocytes--cell fusion (CF) and piezoelectric microinjection (PEM) using different somatic cells--and we have investigated the effect of different activation procedures. Granulosa cells and fibroblasts were grown to confluency or in low serum to induce a quiescent state, while lymphocytes were thawed immediately prior to use. Enucleated oocytes were reconstructed either with CF or PME by 21-23 h postmaturation. For cell fusion, one pulse of 1 kVolt/cm for 30 microsec was used; for PEM, the cell membrane was broken by repeated pipetting and transferred in a 12% PVP solution to facilitate injection. Manipulated oocytes were activated with ionomycin and cycloheximide (CHX) or 6-DMAP (DMAP) and cultured in microdrops of SOF-BSA-AA. On day 7 (day 0: nuclear transfer), embryo development was evaluated and embryos were either transferred fresh or were frozen. More embryos were successfully reconstructed with PEM than CF, but a higher number of reconstructed embryos by CF developed to blastocyst at D + 7. In addition, in both systems more embryos were obtained after activation with DMAP than with CHX. The transfer of 141 embryos to recipients resulted in a pregnancy rate of 50%, and no differences were observed between the source of donor cell, the reconstruction methods, or the activation protocol.

Model-based theoretical analysis using velocity feedback control showed that current piezoelectric actuators provide sufficient force but require lower stiffness for improved low-frequency performance.

To minimize response time, the valve body was designed with minimum dead volume. The result is improved response time and stability with a threefold decrease in actuation latency. Tight valve clearances minimize the steady-state air flow, permitting us to use small resonant-piston pumps to supply pressure and vacuum. To protect the valve from water contamination in the event of a broken pipette, an optical sensor detects water entering the valve and increases pressure rapidly to clear the system. The open-loop time constant for pressure is 2.5 ms for a 100-mmHg step, and the closed-loop settling time is 500-600 micros. Valve actuation latency is 120 micros.

It thus appears that group I mGluRs on SCC hair cells are activated during mechanical stimulation, but are not activated under tonic transmitter release conditions.

One major issue with the use of SMT is its safety, especially with respect to neck manipulation and the risk of stroke in the vertebrobasilar system.\nOur objectives were to quantify the strains and forces sustained by the vertebral artery (VA) in situ during SMT.\nThis was a cadaveric study.\nSix VAs were obtained from 5 unembalmed postrigor cadavers. The cephalad/distal (C0-C1) and caudad/proximal (C6-subclavian artery) loops of the VA were carefully exposed and instrumented with a pair of piezoelectric ultrasonographic crystals. The strains between each crystal pair were recorded during range of motion testing and diagnostic tests and during a variety of SMT procedures. The VA was then dissected free and strained on a materials testing machine until mechanical failure occurred.\nSMT performed on the contralateral side of the cervical spine resulted in an average strain of 6.2% +/- 1.3% to the distal (C0-C1) loop of the VA and a 2.1% +/- 0.4% strain to the proximal (C6) loop. These values were similar to or lower than the strains recorded during diagnostic and range of motion testing. Failure testing demonstrated that the VAs could be stretched to 139% to 162% of their resting length before mechanical failure occurred. Therefore the strains sustained by the VA during SMT represent approximately one ninth of the strain at mechanical failure.\nSMT resulted in strains to the VA that were almost an order of magnitude lower than the strains required to mechanically disrupt it.

Calmegin-deficient mice are almost completely sterile. The cause of the sterility initially was considered to be impaired abilities in sperm/zona pellucida (ZP) and sperm/egg plasma membrane (EPM) binding, and in the ascension of sperm to the oviduct, phenotypes similar to those seen in sperm from fertilin beta-deficient animals. We have developed a new method in which eggs were prepared without any detectable ZP3 on their surfaces by using a piezo-driven micromanipulator. Using these eggs and sperm containing the green fluorescent protein in their acrosomes, which can distinguish acrosome-intact from acrosome-reacted sperm, the binding and fusing abilities of calmegin-deficient sperm were reexamined. Under these conditions, acrosome-reacted sperm retained their ability to bind to and fuse with the EPM. The reduction in EPM binding of sperm from the calmegin(-/-) animals was apparently due to the artifactual binding of large numbers of acrosome-intact sperm from calmegin(+/-) mice to ZP remnants remaining on the EPM prepared with acidic Tyrode's solution. Thus, the sperm defect in calmegin-null animals is not at the level of sperm-EPM binding but rather may involve either sperm-ZP binding and/or sperm transit to the oviduct. Because fertilin beta is absent from calmegin-deficient mice, these results also suggest that the role of fertilin beta in sperm-EPM interaction needs to be reevaluated.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2002-10-12", "authors": ["KazuoYamagata", "TomokoNakanishi", "MasahitoIkawa", "RyouYamaguchi", "Stuart BMoss", "MasaruOkabe"], "doi": null}

However, attempts using high-speed video recordings to demonstrate a tight link between prey capture kinematics and suction pressure have met with limited success. In a study with largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, we adopted a new technique for studying kinematics, sonomicrometry, to transduce the movement of skeletal elements of the head during feeding, and synchronized pressure recordings at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. From the positional relationships of six piezoelectric crystals we monitored the internal movements of the buccal cavity and mouth in both mid-sagittal and transverse planes. We found that peak subambient pressure was reached very early in the kinematic expansion of the buccal cavity, occurring at the time when the rate of percentage change in buccal volume was at its peak. Using multiple regression analyses we were consistently able to account for over 90%, and in the best model 99%, of the variation in buccal pressure among strikes using kinematic variables.

Aliquots of the 8 M urea soluble proteins of each fraction were separated by SDS PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, the membranes were probed with antibodies to vimentin, filensin or phakinin, and analyzed by computer.\nOver the 20 day growth period, the water soluble fraction increased and the most abundant membrane fraction was characterized by a significant increase in its urea insoluble protein and a significant decrease in its urea soluble protein. There were no significant quantitative changes in any of the other fractions. The concentration of each intermediate filament protein was greatest in the cytoskeletal fraction and over the 20 day period, the amount of vimentin associated with this fraction dramatically decreased, and the amounts of filensin and phakinin dramatically increased. Among the membrane fractions, the greatest concentration of each intermediate filament protein was found in the non sedimenting membrane fraction (NSMF) which was the least abundant fraction recovered. Filensin and phakinin associated with the other three major membrane fractions increased over the 20 day growth period, but the level of vimentin did not significantly change.\nThe NSMF may represent a domain of the lens plasma membrane particularly important in interaction between plasma membrane and cytoskeleton and as the membrane-cytoskeleton protein architecture of rat lens changes over the first 20 days of life, the changes are readily detected in the different membrane fractions.", "journal": "Current eye research", "date": "2002-09-27", "authors": ["Charles RickyFleschner"], "doi": "10.1076/ceyr.24.4.296.8415"}
{"title": "Narrowband impedance matching layer for high efficiency thickness mode ultrasonic transducers.", "abstract": "A new matching layer design concept has been proposed for narrowband continuous wave (CW) devices. Analysis has shown that the mechanical impedance of a resonant-type transducer in thickness mode CW operation does not equal its acoustic impedance rhoVs but roughly equals rhoVs/Q, where p is density, Vs is acoustic velocity, and Q is the mechanical quality factor. The value of rhoVs/Q is much lower than the acoustic impedance of water for any transducer material, including lead zirconium titanate (PZT), single crystals, or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). With this new approach, the impedance of the matching layer must also be between water and pVs/Q, but there are few such practical low impedance materials. To realize equivalent low impedance structure, a novel double layer design is presented: a relatively low impedance material (such as polyethylene or polyurethane) on the inside and a relatively high impedance material (such as polyester or metal) on the outside. A high power CW transducer structure was designed and fabricated with PVDF-TrFE (polyvinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene) to operate at 1.4 MHz. The basic quarter wavelength resonator structure is 0.7-mm alumina/0.2-mm piezo-polymer/0.25-mm polyester, and the matching section is 0.2-mm polyurethane and 0.25-mm polyester. A maximum power output of 6 to 9 W/cm2 with conversion efficiency of 30 to 35% was observed. For the transducer without matching section, the observed power was 3 to 4 W/cm2. Mason's model analyses (1) predict that the traditional matching layer is for broadband purposes and reduces output power both for PZT and PVDF-TrFE (2); this new matching scheme can be applied to PZT high power transducer. This high efficiency technique has application in various CW systems, such as Doppler sensors, interferometry, phase-sensitive imaging, or high energy focused beam systems.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-09-27", "authors": ["MinoruToda"], "doi": "10.1109/58.990941"}

There were no serious complications from lithotripsy. Univariate analysis disclosed a statistically significant association between treatment success and patient age as well as prepapillary location of stones. A greater therapeutic effort was necessary in patients with stones located in the tail of the pancreas, 2 or more stones, a stone 12 mm or more in diameter, or who have had a longer duration (>8 years) of the disease. However, with exception of the last parameter, correction for multiple testing of data removed statistical significance.\nExtracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy enhances endoscopic measures for treatment of pancreatic duct stones when mechanical lithotripsy fails.

In this study, to obtain the detailed information of HABPs during cumulus expansion, we examined the expression of HABPs in porcine COCs during in vitro maturation (IVM). After maturation culture, proteins were extracted from porcine COCs and separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After transfer, the membranes were subjected to ligand blotting with biotinylated hyaluronic acid (bHA) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled hyaluronic acid (FITC-HA). Furthermore, the extracted proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analysis to dissect the HABPs. Ligand blotting with FITC-HA could detect HABPs. Using this ligand-blotting method, 13 and 14 bands of HABPs were detected in porcine COCs after 0 and 48 h in culture, respectively. Of these, the level of expression of 85-kDa HABP increased with cumulus expansion during IVM and was newly detected after culture. Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescent analysis confirmed that the 85-kDa HABP corresponded to CD44 and that it existed on/in the membrane of cumulus cells.

In the present study we used a piezo-driven system for ultra-fast solution exchange, analysed the recovery from the fast desensitized state of mouse recombinant adult-type nAChR channels and found no difference to that of embryonic-type channels. By double pulse experiments with application of pulses with a saturating concentration of 1 mm acetylcholine (ACh) with increasing duration of the first pulse and a constant interval between pulses we detected a second slow desensitized state which was entered with a time constant of 2835 ms. Recovery from the slow desensitized state proceeded with a single exponential with a time constant of 16134 ms. The experimental data were interpreted by the addition of a transition from the desensitized state with two bound ACh molecules to a slow desensitized state to the well known circular kinetic scheme of activation and desensitization of nAChR channels.

The flextensional transducer consists of a multilayer stack made of electrostrictive P(VDF-TrFE) polymer films and two flextensional shells fixed at the ends to the multilayer stack. Because of the large transverse strain level achievable in the electrostrictive polymer and the displacement amplification of the flextensional shells, a device of a few millimeters thick and lateral dimension about 30 mm x 25 mm can generate an axial displacement output of more than 1 mm. The unique flextensional configuration and the high elastic energy density of the active polymer also enable the device to offer high-load capability.

Langatate has several attractive acoustical properties, in particular: a measured bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonator quality factor frequency product (Qf) of 16 million, comparable to that of AT cut quartz; high-piezoelectric coupling orientations, up to 0.5% for surface acoustic waves (SAWs), about five times larger than that of ST-X quartz; low power flow angle orientations in the vicinity of high coupling orientations; phase velocities about 20% smaller than those of ST-X quartz, facilitating the production of smaller, lower frequency devices; the existence of pseudo SAW modes for higher frequency applications. In this paper SAW contour plots of the phase velocity (vp), the electromechanical coupling coefficient (K2), the temperature coefficient of delay (TCD), and the power flow angle (PFA), are given showing the orientations in space in which high coupling is obtained, with the corresponding TCD, PFA, and vp characteristics for these orientations. This work reports experimental results on the SAW temperature fractional frequency variation (delta f/fo) and the TCD for several LGT orientations on the plane with Euler angles: (0 degrees, 132 degrees, psi). The temperature behavior has been measured directly on SAW wafers from 10 to 200 degrees C, and the results are compared with numerical predictions using our recently measured temperature coefficients for LGT material constants. This research also has uncovered temperature compensated orientations, which we have experimentally verified with parabolic behavior, turnover temperatures in the 130 to 160 degrees C range, and delta f/fo within 1000 ppm variation from 10 to 260 degrees C, appropriate for higher temperature device applications. Regarding the pseudo surface acoustic waves (PSAWs), results of calculations are presented for both the PSAW and the high velocity PSAW (HVPSAW) for some selected, rotated cuts. This study shows that propagation losses for the PSAWs of about 0.01 dB/wavelength, and phase velocities approximately 20% higher than that of the SAW, exist along specific orientations for the PSAW, thus showing the potential for somewhat higher frequency SAW device applications on this material, if required.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-09-24", "authors": ["Maur\u00edcioPereira da Cunha", "Donald CMalocha", "Eric LAdler", "Kevin JCasey"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2002.1041546"}
{"title": "Very small IF resonator filters using reflection of shear horizontal wave at free edges of substrate.", "abstract": "A shear horizontal (SH) wave has the characteristic of complete reflection at the free edges of a substrate with a large dielectric constant. A conventional surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator filter requires reflectors consisting of numerous grating fingers on both sides of interdigital transducers (IDTs). On the contrary, it is considered that small-sized and low loss resonator filters without reflectors consisting of grating fingers can be realized by exploiting this characteristic of the SH wave or the Bleustein-Gulyaev-Shimizu (BGS) wave. There are two types of resonator filters: transversely coupled and longitudinally coupled. No transversely coupled filters (neither conventional nor edge-reflection) using the SH wave on a single-crystal substrate have been realized until now, because two transverse modes (symmetrical and asymmetrical modes) are not easily coupled. However, the authors have realized small low loss transversely coupled resonator filters in the range of 25 to 52 MHz using edge reflections of the BGS wave on piezoelectric ceramic (PZT: Pb(Zr,Ti)O3) substrates for the first time by developing methods by which the two transverse modes could be coupled. On the other hand, longitudinally coupled resonator filters using edge reflection of the SH or BGS wave always have large spurious responses because of the even modes in the out-of-band range, because the frequencies of even modes do not coincide with the nulls of the frequency spectra of the IDTs. Consequently, longitudinally coupled resonator filters using the edge reflection of the SH wave have not been realized. By developing a method of reducing the spurious responses without increasing of the insertion loss, the authors have realized small low loss longitudinally coupled resonator filters in the range of 40 to 190 MHz using edge reflection of BGS or SH waves on PZT or 36 degrees-rotated-Y X-propagation LiTaO3 substrates for the first time.

A method for elastic constant reconstruction from acoustic microscopy signatures also is presented. The microscopy response is complicated by multiple reflections in the layers and by the anisotropic nature of the material. The model is based on a new, stable recursive stiffness matrix algorithm developed for a multilayered anisotropic medium, which is applied to the interpretation of the time-resolved acoustic microscopy signature. Specific examples are given for unidirectional and multidirectional graphite epoxy composites. It is shown that the fluid load has a significant effect on the leaky surface waves in these composites, increasing surface wave speed above that for the slow transverse wave. This results in its absence from the microscopy signature of the surface wave. The theoretical results are compared with experiments carried out using a line focus PVDF transducer developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Time-resolved acoustic microscopy has been applied to the determination of elastic constants of a unidirectional composite or of one lamina in a cross-ply composite.

A piezoelectric smart panel is basically a plate structure on which piezoelectric patches with electrical shunt circuits are mounted and sound-absorbing material is bonded on the surface of the structure. Sound-absorbing material can absorb the sound transmitted at the midfrequency region effectively while the use of piezoelectric shunt damping can reduce the transmission at resonance frequencies of the panel structure. To be able to reduce the sound transmission at low panel resonance frequencies, piezoelectric damping using the measured electrical impedance model is adopted. A resonant shunt circuit for piezoelectric shunt damping is composed of resistor and inductor in series, and they are determined by maximizing the dissipated energy through the circuit. The transmitted noise-reduction performance of smart panels is tested in an acoustic tunnel. The tunnel is a square cross-sectional tube and a loudspeaker is mounted at one side of the tube as a sound source. Panels are mounted in the middle of the tunnel and the transmitted sound pressure across panels is measured. When an absorbing material is bonded on a single plate, a remarkable transmitted noise reduction in the midfrequency region is observed except for the fundamental resonance frequency of the plate. By enabling the piezoelectric shunt damping, noise reduction is achieved at the resonance frequency as well.

{"title": "Reconstruction of ultrasonic fields by deconvolving the hydrophone aperture effects. I.

It therefore suggests itself to develop methods, which allow ultrasonic fields to be reconstructed from the spatially averaged measurement values with the necessary spatial resolution. In this publication, this task will be treated as an inverse problem. It will be shown by simulations that it is possible with the aid of reconstruction methods to invert the aperture effects of the sensor. Three different reconstruction methods are tested: (1) Wiener's method furnishes the best approximation of the field to be reconstructed in the sense of the minimum mean square error. (2) The power spectral equalization method is based on equalization between the spatial power spectral densities of the field to be reconstructed and that of its estimated value. (3) With the maximum a-posteriori method, the maximum a-posteriori probability density function for the reconstructed field is searched. The results of this paper show that the quality of reconstruction depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the spatial frequency bandwidth of the sound field investigated. Good quality reconstructions were obtained at correlation coefficients larger than 0.995 and an SNR of at least 40 dB. In general, the quality of reconstruction decreases with decreasing SNR and is unacceptable at SNR = 20 dB.

Fixed frequency excitation and self-excitation of torsional motion were implemented.

The amplitude and phase of the torsional motion of the cantilever was measured by a lock-in-amplifier or a rectifier and plotted in x and y as the sample was raster scanned.

Changing contrast was observed as silicon islands oxidized in atmosphere, showing that the imaging technique can detect change in lateral tip mobility due to changes occurring near the surface.

{"title": "Studies on the selective transport of organic compounds by using ionic liquids as novel supported liquid membranes.", "abstract": "The possibility of using room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) in bulk (nonsupported) and supported liquid membranes for the selective transport of organic molecules is demonstrated. A systematic selective transport study, in which 1,4-dioxane, propan-1-ol, butan-1-ol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, morpholine, and methylmorpholine serve as a model seven-component mixture of representative organic compounds, and in which four RTILs based on the 1-n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cation (n-butyl, n-octyl, and n-decyl) are used together with the anions PF(6)(-) or BF(4)(-), immobilized in five different supporting membranes, confirms that the combination of the selected RTILs with the supporting membranes is crucial to achieve good selectivity for a specific solute. The use of the RTIL 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, immobilized in a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, allows an extremely highly selective transport of secondary amines over tertiary amines (up to a 55:1 ratio). The selective transport of a given solute through the RTIL/membrane system results from the high partitioning of the solute to the liquid membrane phase which, in the case of amines, is rationalized mainly by the formation of a preferential substrate/H[bond]C(2) hydrogen bonding to the imidazolium cation.", "journal": "Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2002-08-31", "authors": ["Lu\u00eds CBranco", "Jo\u00e3o GCrespo", "Carlos A MAfonso"], "doi": "10.1002/1521-3765(20020902)8:17<3865::AID-CHEM3865>3.0.CO;2-L"}

To meet the challenge, newly developed techniques for high throughput protein identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and peptide mass fingerprint are needed. Two years ago, a parallel protein digestion process was proposed. It provided a collecting polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane able to be scanned by MALDI. Acquired data were used to recreate a virtual multidimensional image. Voltage used during this protein electroblotting technique was an unusual square wave alternative voltage (SWAV). The goal of the current study is to evaluate quantitatively the efficiency of the SWAV compared with a classical electroblot process on intact proteins. The effect of the pulsed electric field and the buffer composition were compared to a standard continuous transblotting process defined as the gold standard. Combination of the pulsed asymmetric electric field with 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propane-sulfonique acid (CAPS) buffers showed an average 65% increase of protein recovery.

This paper introduces a method for motion artifact cancellation. This method is based on adaptive filtering and takes advantage of piezoelectric motion sensor information to estimate the motion artifact noise. This filter estimates the mapping between motion sensor and EEG space, subtracting the motion-related noise from the raw EEG signal. Due to possible subject motion and changes in electrode impedance, a time-varying mapping of the motion versus EEG is required. We show that this filter is capable of removing both ballistocardiogram and gross motion artifacts, restoring EEG alpha waves (8-13 Hz), and visual evoked potentials (VEPs). This adaptive filter outperforms the simple band-pass filter for alpha detection because it is also capable of reducing noise within the frequency band of interest. In addition, this filter also removes the transient responses normally visible in the EEG window after echo planar image acquisition, observed during interleaved EEG/fMRI recordings. Our adaptive filter approach can be implemented in real-time to allow for continuous monitoring of EEG and fMRI during clinical and cognitive studies.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2002-08-31", "authors": ["GiorgioBonmassar", "Patrick LPurdon", "Iiro PJ\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen", "KeithChiappa", "VictorSolo", "Emery NBrown", "John WBelliveau"], "doi": "10.1006/nimg.2002.1125"}

Immobilization of the antibody on the quartz crystal was examined for different pH, antibody concentration and treatment time. The optimum conditions for anti-HSA immobilization were evaluated by the measurements of the activity of the surface against HSA. The optimum values of pH, antibody concentration and treatment time were found 6.2, 0.15 mg/ml and 2 h, respectively. For detection of HSA into the solution, two methods were used.

{"title": "A novel method of drug delivery for fibrinolysis with Ho:YAG laser-induced liquid jet.", "abstract": "Two of the problems inherent in the treatment of cerebral emboli are the narrow therapeutic time window and the severe side effects of fibrinolytic drugs. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new method of removing a cerebral thrombus more rapidly and with smaller quantities of fibrinolytics. The behaviour of a bubble formed by holmium (Ho):YAG laser irradiation in a capillary tube filled with pure water was observed at various stand-off distances (L; distance between the end of optical fibre and the capillary exit). Subsequently, a liquid-jet generator was created by insertion of an optical fibre (core diameter: 0.6 mm) into a catheter (6 Fr) filled with pure water, and a pulsed Ho:YAG laser (pulse duration time=350 micros, laser energy=230 mJ/pulse) was used to irradiate the optical fibre. The maximum penetration depth, into a gelatin artificial thrombus, of a liquid jet generated with this device was measured for various stand-off distances. Additionally, the phenomenon and the pressure around the catheter exit were captured via shadowgraph and PVDF needle hydrophone, respectively. The laser-induced bubble in the capillary tube grew rapidly in the direction of propagation and generated a liquid jet. The maximum penetration depth of this liquid jet into an artificial thrombus increased in proportion to L and reached a maximum value (9 mm) when L was around 13 mm. A shock wave whose overpressure at a point 4 mm away from the catheter exit exceeded 12 MPa was captured by shadowgraph. It was concluded that Ho:YAG laser irradiation within a water-filled catheter caused liquid jet formation, which could penetrate straight into an artificial thrombus. Hence, this jet is expected to promote fibrinolysis by means of injecting fibrinolytics deeply into the thrombus. After resolving some problems, this system will be applied to an endovascular therapy for cerebral embolisms in the near future.", "journal": "Lasers in medical science", "date": "2002-08-16", "authors": ["THirano", "MKomatsu", "HUenohara", "ATakahashi", "KTakayama", "TYoshimoto"], "doi": "10.1007/s101030200026"}

{"title": "Induction and detection of antibodies to squalene. II. Optimization of the assay for murine antibodies.", "abstract": "An improved high throughput assay for measuring murine antibodies to squalene (SQE) is described. The assay is highly reproducible and sensitive and can detect 80 ng/ml of antibody to SQE. The assay, an ELISA, is similar to our previously described assay in which plates containing PVDF membranes were used [J. Immunol. Methods 245 (2000) 1]. The PVDF plates worked well for detection of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to SQE, but substantial PVDF plate variation was observed, resulting in significant loss of signal and reproducibility between different lots of plates. In the new assay, the PVDF plates were replaced with Costar round bottom 96-well sterile tissue culture plates. These latter plates, which are not normally used for ELISA assay, gave high absorbances for monoclonal antibodies and anti-SQE serum binding to SQE and low absorbances for solvent-treated wells. Other commercially available polystyrene ELISA plates were unsuitable, in that either the background was high or the absorbance for antibodies binding to SQE was low, or both. This change in plate from PVDF to polystyrene allowed the use of an ELISA plate washer, which dramatically increased the throughput rate over the hand-washed PVDF plates. The improved assay also replaced fetal bovine serum (FBS), which contained SQE in lipoproteins, with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the blocker/diluent. Fifteen nanomoles of SQE were selected as the optimal amount of SQE to add to the wells. The binding of monoclonal antibodies and anti-SQE serum was dependent upon both the amount of antibody added to the wells and the amount of SQE added to the wells. Antibody concentration curves were hyperbolic in shape, as seen with most other antibodies. Antibody binding first increased with SQE amount and then reached a plateau around 10 nmol of SQE/well. At high SQE amounts (>75 nmol/well), antibody binding decreased with the amount of SQE added. Using 3H-SQE, the amount of SQE bound to the wells increased linearly, up to 50 nmol of SQE added. Approximately 90% of the added SQE bound to the well. When amounts greater than 100 nmol of SQE were added, the amount of SQE bound to the wells was greatly reduced to approximately 5-10% of the added SQE.

{"title": "Experimental investigation of alternative pre-stress components for a 3-1 connectivity multilayer piezoelectric-polymer composite ultrasonic transducer.", "abstract": "The most popular configuration for piezoelectric-polymer composites has pillars of piezoelectric ceramic supported by a polymer matrix and material with this structure is now widely available commercially. However, it has significant disadvantages for use in multilayer devices for non-mass-loaded operation below approximately 50 kHz. An alternative configuration is therefore reported here, in which interconnected fingers of piezoelectric ceramic surround polymer plates. This can be termed 3-1 connectivity, since the piezoceramic is fully connected in three dimensions and the polymer in only one. The configuration has been found to have significant manufacturing advantages which feed through to enhanced performance compared with practical 1-3 connectivity multilayer devices. For many potential applications, high-power operation is required, and it is unclear if the multilayer structure has sufficient internal strength to maintain its integrity at high strains. Therefore, an investigation has been carried out into alternative pre-stressing component designs. These comprise back and front stainless steel plates of different shapes, connected by a number of stainless steel rods. In this paper, the fundamental performance of a multilayer device is illustrated with electrical impedance and surface displacement measurements in air, without pre-stressing. Then measurements are reported from three different clamping configurations. It is shown that good results can be achieved at spot frequencies with a suitable clamp, but that unsuitable clamps prevent even this, and broadband performance is unlikely to be achieved easily.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2002-08-06", "authors": ["DRobertson", "SCochran"], "doi": "10.1016/s0041-624x(02)00225-1"}

This result cannot be obtained with monolithic PZT ceramics which require voltages larger than 1000 V to produce displacements of the micrometer order at resonance.

Material constant (compliance, losses) variations under large dynamic stress are, at least, one order of magnitude larger than for monolithic ceramics.

Minute cracks perpendicular to a free, flat surface close under compressive stress when width of the crack opening is less than the longitudinal amplitude of the Rayleigh wave. Thereafter, compressive and shear stresses are partially transmitted through the closed cracks, whereas tensile and shear stresses are not transmitted through cracks that remain open. This leads to marked nonlinear ultrasonic response. Calculation was performed for an aluminum block having a surface crack. The transverse component of the Rayleigh wave propagating through the cracks shows distorted waveforms, making the second harmonic amplitude clearly noticeable. In an experiment, the second harmonic component of the leaky Rayleigh wave was detected for a simple crack model consisting of two aluminum blocks, by use of a PVDF line-focused transducer.

Their lowest flexural and torsional resonance frequencies are usually found to be in a range between several kHz and several MHz depending on their exact geometrical shape. When the sensor tip is in a repulsive elastic contact with a sample surface, the local indentation modulus can be determined by the contact resonance technique. Contact resonances in the ultrasonic frequency range can also be used to improve the image contrast in other dynamic techniques as, for example, in the so-called piezo-mode. Here, an alternating electric field is applied between a conducting cantilever and a piezoelectric sample. Via the inverse piezoelectric effect, the sample surface is set into vibration.

This problem is of particular importance in the case of ultrasonic transducers working at a frequency above 1 MHz. Because the possibilities of choosing material with required acoustic impedance are limited (the counted values cannot always be realised and applied in practice) it is necessary to correct the differences between theoretical values and the possibilities of practical application of given acoustic impedances. Such a correction can be done by manipulating other parameters of matching layers (e.g. by changing their thickness). The efficiency of the energy transmission from the piezoceramic transducer through different layers with different thickness enabling a compensation of non-ideal real values by changing their thickness was computer analysed.

The test rig also allowed easy interchange of different prototype flowmetering sections. Times of flight of ultrasonic waves interrogating the gas flow were measured using separate send/receive electrostatic transducer arrangements. Two flowmeter configurations were considered. The first interrogated the flow at 45 degrees in contra-propagating upstream and downstream directions. The second consisted of an up-stream interrogation at 45 degrees to the gas flow and an interrogation made normal to the flow direction. k factors correlating the fluid velocity along the ultrasonic path with the mean fluid velocity in the pipe were calculated using experimental ultrasonic data and anemometer measurements. All transducer configurations were numerically modelled using the computational fluid dynamics software package FLOTRAN (ANSYS Inc.).

We report here, the desorption and fragmentation of poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) telomers in an ion trap mass spectrometer coupled to an ESI source. Protonated and lithiated telomers under collision-induced dissociation resonant excitation show mainly HF losses. Fragmentation of protonated telomers can be rationalized by a double proton-transfer mechanism and that of lithiated and anionic telomers by an ion-dipole mechanism. Both mechanisms predict the formation of a stable aromatic or a linear conjugated species, respectively. For lithiated telomers, we could determine the degree of polymerization (n) from the product ion abundance in MS2 experiments. The nature of the end group plays a substantial role in orienting the fragmentation of the PVDF ions. It is interesting to note that, in MS2 experiments, Li+ and F- act as catalysts in the fragmentation of PVDF telomers.

The critical precipitation concentration of Pb2+, at which the resonant frequency decreased significantly, was estimated to be 4.78 x 10(-4) mol/L. The saturated adherence of the precipitate on the electrode was observed when the concentration of Pb2+ was greater than 7.53 x 10(-2) mol/L. The frequency response was mainly caused by the mass effect of the precipitate adherence to the electrode, rather than the changes in the physico-chemical properties of the contacting liquid. An excess addition of Na2EDTA after the Pb2+-BSA dissolution led to new precipitation, probably due to the formation of an EDTA precipitate in this medium (pH approximately 3). The pH effect on the response of the resonant frequency was analyzed by using the sum of two exponential functions. A larger frequency response occurred at a pH greater than pI. These findings have been reasonably explained.

When metaphase II horse oocytes were injected with either of two dosages of sperm extract and cultured 20 h, similar activation rates (88% vs. 90%) and cleavage rates (49% vs. 46%) were obtained. The successful reconstruction rate of horse oocytes with horse somatic cell donor nuclei after direct injection using the Piezo drill was 82%. Four dosages of sperm extract (containing 59, 176, 293, or 1375 microg/ml protein) and two activation times (1.5-2 vs. 8-10 h after nuclear transfer) were examined. Cleavage and activation (pseudopronucleus formation) rates of oocytes injected with sperm extract containing 59 microg/ml protein were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than any other dosage. The percentage of embryos cleaving with normal nuclei in oocytes injected with the 1375 microg/ml preparation 1.5-2 h after donor injection was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of the 293 microg/ml preparation 8-10 h after donor injection (22 vs. 6%). Embryos developed to a maximum of 10 nuclei. Interspecies nuclear transfer was performed by direct injection of horse nuclei into enucleated bovine oocytes, followed by chemical activation. This resulted in 81% reconstruction (successful injection of the donor cell), 88% cleavage, and 73% cleavage with normal nuclei.

A diagnostic B-mode ultrasonographic transducer is integrated into the source to allow the focus to be located in the target area. The field distribution of the sound pressure was measured in degassed water using a needle hydrophone. An ultrasound-force balance was used to determine the acoustic power. These measurements allowed the spatially averaged sound intensity to be calculated. The morphology and extent of tissue necrosis induced by HIFU was examined on an ex-vivo kidney model.\nThe two-dimensional field distribution resulted in an approximately ellipsoidal focus of 32 x 4 mm (- 6 dB). The spatially maximum averaged sound intensity was 8591 W/cm2 at an electrical power of 400 W. The lesion caused to the ex-vivo kidney at this maximum generator power with a pulse duration of 2 s was a clearly delineated ellipsoidal coagulation necrosis up to 8.8 x 2.3 mm (length x width) and with central liquefied necrosis of 7.9 x 1.9 mm.\nThis newly developed ultrasound generator with a focal length of 10 cm can induce clear necrosis in parenchymal tissue.

Uric acid stones were irradiated in water and the water was assayed for cyanide.\nDuring the early phase of vapor bubble expansion, acoustic transients had minimal effects on calculus fragmentation. Fragmentation occurred due to direct absorption of laser energy transmitted to the calculus through the vapor channel between the sapphire fiber tip and calculus. The forward axial expansion of the bubble occurred more rapidly than the radial expansion. A parallel oriented fiber on the calculus surface produced no fragmentation but generated larger amplitude acoustic transients compared to perpendicular orientation.

The method was used to monitor the binding of an anticancer drug, mitoxantrone (MX), to double-stranded calf-thymus DNA covalently immobilized on the thioglycollic acid-modified gold electrode surface of a quartz crystal. Optimum experimental conditions for the immobilization were established. The DNA-anchored piezoelectric sensor was in contact with MX solution. The time courses of the resonant frequency and the equivalent circuit characteristics of the sensor were also obtained during the study of DNA-drug binding. On the basis of the analysis of the multidimensional information provided by the PQCI technique the observed frequency decrease was mainly ascribed to the increase in the mass of the sensor surface resulting from the binding. The kinetics of the binding process were studied quantitatively by monitoring the frequency change with time and a piezoelectric response model for the binding was derived theoretically.

Binocular eye rotations were measured with magnetic search coils, while linear head position and acceleration were measured with a potentiometer and piezoelectric accelerometer. Subjects viewed targets 200 cm, 50 cm, or 15 cm distant immediately before the unpredictable onset of randomly directed translation in darkness (LVOR) and in light (LVVOR). All subjects maintained ideal vergence of 1.5-2 degrees for the 200-cm target, 6-8 degrees for the 50-cm target, and 21-26 degrees for the 15-cm target, with actual vergences depending on individual interpupillary distances. Search coil recording of angular position of the upper teeth showed head rotation to be negligible (less than 0.5 degrees ) for the first 250 ms after onset of head translation, excluding a role for the angular VOR in the responses studied. The LVOR response to heave translation was an oppositely directed eye rotation occurring after a mean latency of 62+/-3 ms for older and 42+/-3 ms (mean +/- SD) for younger subjects ( P<0.0001). The peak of the latency distribution was 60-100 ms for older and 20-60 ms for younger subjects. During the early interval, 70-80 ms from head motion onset prior to a pursuit contribution or saccades, all subjects had significantly enhanced LVOR with decreasing target distance. In this interval, the LVOR position amplitude of younger subjects was 0.17+/-0.01 degrees, 0.40+/-0.01 degrees, 0.57+/-0.01 degrees (mean +/- SE), respectively, in descending order of target distance. Early sensitivities were significantly reduced for older subjects to 0.07+/-0.01 degrees, 0.23+/-0.01 degrees, 0.40+/-0.01 degrees ( P<0.0001). There was no significant effect of target visibility in either group during the first 110 ms ( P>0.05). Visual-otolith interaction was mainly reflected not by the vestibular slow phase, but by vestibular catch-up saccades (VCUS) in the compensatory direction.

Explanted tissue samples have been investigated for their histological reaction in regard to the inflammatory infiltrate. vascularisation, connective and fat tissue ingrowth. Number of granulocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, lymphocytes and foreign giant body cells have been evaluated to reflect quality of tissue response. The cellular response was grasped by measurement of DNA strand breaks and apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferation (Ki67) and cell stress (HSP70). Analyzing the results confirmed that construction of hernia meshes made of PVDF could be an advantageous alternative to the commonly used materials due to an improved biostability. lowered bending stiffness and a minimum tissue response.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2002-07-09", "authors": ["UKlinge", "BKlosterhalfen", "A POttinger", "KJunge", "VSchumpelick"], "doi": "10.1016/s0142-9612(02)00070-4"}

The system employs a piezoelectric sensor, a low-power operational amplifier, a low-power 8-bit microcomputer and a 512 KB EEPROM. The piezoelectric sensor, whose electrical polarization voltage is produced by mechanical strain, records body movements produced by respiration, heart pulse, walking and running. The high and low frequency components from the recorded body movements are discriminated by high and low pass filters. The high frequency components reflect the body movements produced by cardiac vibrations, walking and running activities. The low frequency components are mainly generated by respiration. The degree of activity is obtained by summing the high frequency components for 1 second. The microcomputer stores the obtained low frequency components and activity to the EEPROM at 0.2 second and 1 second intervals, respectively.

{"title": "Coupling analysis of a matched piezoelectric sensor and actuator pair for vibration control of a smart beam.", "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of the in-plane and out-of-plane coupling of a matched piezoelectric sensor/actuator pair bonded on a beam. Both the sensor and actuator are triangularly shaped polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) transducers and are intended to provide a compact sensor/actuator system for beam vibration control. The measured sensor-actuator frequency response function has shown an unpredicted increase in magnitude with frequency, which was found, to be due to in-plane vibration coupling. An analytical model has been developed to decompose the sensor-actuator response function into an in-plane contribution and an out-of-plane contribution. This in-plane coupling can limit the feedback control gains when a direct velocity feedback control is applied. A method called the j omega s compensation method is proposed to identify the effect of the in-plane vibration coupling at low frequencies. Even after this compensation, however, there was unexpected strong out-of-plane coupling at even modes, which may have been caused by a lack of accuracy in the shaping of the PVDF sensor and actuator. Numerical simulations have confirmed the sensitivity of the matched sensor/actuator pair with shaping errors.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2002-06-27", "authors": ["Young-SupLee", "PaoloGardonio", "Stephen JElliott"], "doi": "10.1121/1.1476921"}

A 60-minute left anterior descending artery occlusion was used to produce anterior wall infarction.

The BSA-coated piezoelectric sensor was in contact with berberine solution. The time courses of the resonant frequency and equivalent circuit parameters of the sensor during the protein-drug binding were simultaneously obtained.

Our aim was to determine whether there are significant differences between human IgG and IgA reactivities to individual H. pylori proteins, and whether patterns of immunoreactivity are sustained across different strains of H. pylori.\nThe total complement of protein from seven strains of H. pylori was resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, which were probed with sera pooled either from H. pylori-infected patients, or noninfected (control) patients. Highly immunoreactive proteins were detected using chromogenic enzyme-antibody conjugates recognising either serum IgG or IgA. These proteins were then characterised by tryptic peptide-mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).\nHighly immunoreactive proteins were detected which were common to all seven strains, and recognised by both immunoglobulin subclasses. The proteins appear to be localised in five groups. Protein analysis established that these groups encompass multiple isoforms of chaperonin HspB (two subgroups); urease beta-subunit UreB; elongation factor EF-Tu; and flagellin FlaA. The pattern of highly immunoreactive proteins was strongly conserved across the seven strains.\nThese results suggest that within a tightly defined region on the H. pylori proteome map there are five groups of proteins that are highly reactive to both IgG and IgA.

These are desirable material properties for both SAW and BAW applications that require low frequency dependence on temperature. This paper examines in detail the LGN characteristics: phase velocity, temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF), electromechanical coupling coefficient, and power flow angle for both singly and doubly rotated plate cuts. Contour plots of these characteristics are constructed, revealing orientation regions where zero TCF and high coupling exist and suggesting potentially interesting cuts for practical BAW device design. Temperature compensated cut regions with coupling coefficients as high as 0.16 are predicted, which is twice the value for AT-cut quartz, along with a temperature compensated cut with cubic behavior around room temperature for one of the sets of material constants used. With such desirable properties, LGN is a promising candidate material for BAW applications requiring low temperature sensitivity with superior bandwidth characteristics due to its values of coupling coefficient larger than quartz. Several other orientations with low TCF and high coupling are also identified.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-06-06", "authors": ["Mauricio Pereirada Cunha", "Eric LAdler", "Donald CMalocha"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2002.1002465"}

These equations are used to study mechanical effects on the thickness-shear (TS), flexural (F), and face-shear (FS) vibrations of an AT-cut quartz plated with two identical electrodes. Dispersion curves are calculated from the present 2-D equations as well as the 3-D equations. The comparison of these curves shows that the agreement is very close for all three frequency branches of TS, F, and FS modes in a range up to the 1.5 times the fundamental TS frequency and for gold and aluminum electrodes with R, the ratio of the mass of the electrodes to that of the plate, equal to 0.05. without introducing any correction factors. In order to assess electrode effects, spectra of omega vs. a/bq (length-to-thickness ratio of the quartz) are computed for plates with gold and aluminum electrodes and different R ratios. And the spectrum of omega vs. R is computed for plates with aluminum electrodes and a given a/bq ratio. For a plate with gold electrodes, the frequencies of predominant TS, F, and FS modes are decreasing as R increases, but the amount of frequency changes for the TS mode is much greater than those for the other two modes.

Closed form solutions are obtained for both free and piezoelectrically forced thickness-shear vibrations of a finite, rectangular AT-cut quartz in contact with a liquid layer of finite thickness.

{"title": "SH wave propagation in piezoelectric coupled plates.", "abstract": "The propagation of shear horizontal (SH) wave in a piezoelectric coupled plate is investigated in this paper. Full account is taken of the piezoelectric coupling effect to the isotropic metal core in the mathematical model. One of the applications of this research is in the damage detection of the host metal structure from the wave propagation signal excited by the piezoelectric layer which is surface bonded on the surface of a metal core. This research is distinct from the previous works on SH propagation in piezoelectric structures because the piezoelectric materials were used as the core structure in the previous studies, and the potential of the studies was mainly on time-delay devices. The dispersive characteristics and the mode shapes of the transverse displacement and the electric potential of the piezoelectric layer are theoretically derived. The results from numerical simulations show that the phase velocity of the plate structure tends to the bulk shear wave velocity of the host metal core at high wavenumber when the shear wave velocity of host plate is larger than that of PZT bonded on it. Furthermore, there are three asymptotic solutions of wave propagation when the shear wave velocity of the host plate is smaller than that of PZT. The mode shape of the electric potential of the piezoelectric layer changes from the quadratic shape at lower wavenumber and with thinner piezoelectric layer to the shape with more zero nodes at higher wavenumber and with thicker piezoelectric layer.

Bovine spermatozoa were injected individually into matured oocytes using a piezo electric actuator. Spermatozoa were \"immobilized\", by scoring their tails immediately before injection, or \"killed\", by repeated freezing and thawing. About 4 h after ICSI, the oocytes with two polar bodies (activated by sperm injection) were selected and treated 5 min with 7% ethanol before further culture. When examined 19-21 h after ICSI, nearly 90% of the oocytes were fertilized normally (two pronuclei and two polar bodies) irrespective of the sperm treatment (immobilization or killing) prior to ICSI, but subsequent preimplantation embryo development was much superior (cleavage 72%: blastocysts 20%) after ICSI with immobilized spermatozoa than by using killed spermatozoa (cleavage 28%; blastocysts 1%). Ethanol activation of bovine oocytes with two polar bodies 4 h after ICSI improved the cleavage (33% versus 72%) and blastocyst (12% versus 20%) rates markedly (P < 0.05).

{"title": "Membranes for biohybrid liver support systems--investigations on hepatocyte attachment, morphology and growth.", "abstract": "The biological properties of four different membranes were studied regarding their possible application in biohybrid liver support systems. Two of them, one made of polyetherimide (PEI), and a second based on polyacrylonitrile-N-vinylpyrollidone co-polymer (P(AN-NVP)), were recently developed in our lab and studied for the first time. Together with pure polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes, the three preparations were characterised as ultra-filtration membranes. Their ability to support cell attachment, morphology, proliferation and function of human hepatoblastoma C3A cells was studied. The role of surface morphology for the interaction with hepatocytes was highlighted using a commercial, moderately wettable polyvinylidendifluoride (PVDF) membrane with micro-filtration properties. Comparative investigations showed strongest interaction of C3A cells with PAN membranes, as the focal adhesion contacts were more expressed and cell growth was also high. However, the functional activity in terms of albumin synthesis was reduced. Very similar results were obtained with the most hydrophobic PEI membrane. In contrast, the most hydrophilic membrane P(AN-NVP) was found to provoke stronger homotypic adhesion (E-cadherin expression) of C3A cells and less substratum attachment (focal adhesions), but enhanced albumin secretion. However, proliferation of C3A cells was lowered. Micro-porous PVDF membrane showed very good initial attachment, but the resulting cell material and cell-cell interaction were relatively poor developed. Among four membranes tested, PEI seems to be the most attractive membrane for biohybrid liver devices, as it provides good surface properties for hepatocytes interaction, but in addition it is highly thermostable, which would permit steam sterilisation. No simple relationship, however, between the wettability of the membranes and their ability to support hepatocyte adhesion and function was found in this study.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2002-05-30", "authors": ["NataliaKrasteva", "UlrikeHarms", "WolfgangAlbrecht", "BarbaraSeifert", "MichaelHopp", "GeorgeAltankov", "ThomasGroth"], "doi": "10.1016/s0142-9612(01)00381-7"}

By peptide-mass fingerprinting after tryptic digestion, the proteins were found to be isoforms of the DMBT1 gene product, with over 30% of the predicted protein covered by the tryptic peptides. By using gradient SDS/agarose/polyacrylamide composite gel electrophoresis and staining for glycosylation, it was shown that the two isoforms were the major high-molecular-mass glycoproteins of >200 kDa in human tear fluid. Western blotting showed that the proteins expressed sialyl-Le(a). After the release of oligosaccharides by reductive beta-elimination from protein blotted on to PVDF membrane, it was revealed by liquid chromatography-MS that the O-linked oligosaccharides were comprised mainly of highly sialylated oligosaccharides with up to 16 monosaccharide units. A majority of the oligosaccharides could be described by the formula dHex(0-->2)NeuAc(1-->)(x)Hex(x)HexNAc(x)(-ol), x=1-6, where Hex stands for hexose, dHex for deoxyhexose, HexNAc for N-acetylhexosamine and NeuAc for N-acetylneuraminate. The number of sialic acids in the formula is less than 5. Interpretation of collision-induced fragmentation tandem MS confirmed the presence of sialic acid and suggested the presence of previously undescribed structures carrying the sialyl-Le(a) epitopes.

Rapid changes in pressure can thus be used to initiate relaxation in pressure; however, this approach is seldom used, because it requires specialized equipment. We have built a microvolume (50 microl) pressure-jump apparatus, powered by a piezoelectric actuator, based on the original design of Clegg and Maxfield [(1976) Rev. Sci. Instrum. 47, 1383-1393]. This equipment can apply pressure changes of +/-20 MPa (maximally) in time periods as short as 80 micros and follow the resulting change in fluorescence signals. The system is relatively simple to use with fast (approx. 1 min) exchange of samples. In the present study, we show that this system can perturb the binding of 2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-ADP to myosin subfragment-1(S1) from skeletal and smooth muscles. The kinetic data are consistent with previous work, and in addition show that, although 2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-ADP binds with a similar affinity to both proteins, the increase in molar volume for the skeletal-muscle S1 binding to ADP is half of that for the smooth-muscle protein.

To test this concept, we developed a novel in vivo method to measure myocardial stress (sigma)-strain (epsilon) relations in normal and hypertrophied mice. LV volume was measured using two pairs of miniature omnidirectional piezoelectric crystals implanted orthogonally in the endocardium and one crystal placed on the anterior free wall to measure instantaneous wall thickness. Highly linear sigma-epsilon relations were obtained in control (n = 7) and hypertrophied mice produced by 7 days of transverse aortic constriction (TAC; n = 13). Administration of dobutamine in control mice significantly increased the load-independent measure of LV contractility, systolic myocardial stiffness. In TAC mice, systolic myocardial stiffness was significantly greater than in control mice (3,156 +/- 1,433 vs. 1,435 +/- 467 g/cm(2), P < 0.01), indicating enhanced myocardial contractility with pressure overload. However, despite the increased systolic performance, both active (time constant of LV pressure decay) and passive (diastolic myocardial stiffness constant) diastolic properties were markedly abnormal in TAC mice compared with control mice. These data suggest that the development of cardiac hypertrophy is associated with a heightened contractile state, perhaps as an early compensatory response to pressure overload.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "A new device for measuring the viscoelastic properties of hydrated matrix gels.", "abstract": "Determinations of the viscoelastic properties of extracellular matrices (ECMs) are becoming increasingly important for accurate predictive modeling of biological systems. Since the interactions of the cells with the ECM and surrounding fluid (e.g., blood, media) each affect cell behavior; it is advantageous to evaluate the ECM's material properties in the presence of the hydrating fluid. Conventional rheometry methods evaluate the bulk material properties of gel materials while displacing the hydrating liquid film. Such systems are therefore nonideal for testing materials such as ECMs, whose properties change with dehydration. The new patent pending, piezoelectrically actuated linear rheometer is designed to eliminate this problem. It uses a single cantilever to apply an oscillating load to the gel and to sense the gel's deflection. Composed of two thin film piezopolymer layers, the cantilever uses one layer as the actuator, and the second piezopolymer layer to measure the lateral movement of its attached probe. The viscoelastic nature of the ECM adds stiffness and damping to the system, resulting in the attenuation and phase shift of the sensor's output voltage. From these parameters, the ECM's shear storage and loss moduli are then determined. Initial tests on the BioMatrix I and type I collagen ECMs reveal that the first prototype of the piezoelectrically actuated linear rheometer is capable of accurately determining the trend and order of magnitude of an ECM's viscoelastic properties.

This was pursued on the hand by using broadband piezo-electric and optical sensors, and on the other hand by means of theoretical simulations. For optically one-dimensional media, where the optical properties depend only on one direction in space, the measurement of a plane wave in the acoustical near field of the sample yielded directly the depth distribution of absorbed energy.

Their PT was measured on a calibrated dynamometer at randomly ordered velocities of 30, 90, and 150 degrees x s(-1). A piezoelectric MMG recording sensor was placed between bipolar surface EMG electrodes (Ag-AgCl) over the VL muscle. Their MP was determined using the dynamometer software.

The stator of the motor presented in this paper consists of a hollow metal cylinder, whose outside surface was flattened on two sides at 90 degrees to each other, on which two rectangular piezoelectric plates were bonded. Because the cylinder has a partially square/partially circular outside surface, the stator has two degenerated bending modes that are orthogonal to each other. A wobbling motion is generated on the cylinder when only one piezoelectric plate is excited at a frequency between the two orthogonal bending modes. A rod through a pair of ferrules was used as the rotor of this motor. The prototype motor, whose stator was 2.4 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length, operated at 69.5 kHz, was experimentally characterized, and a maximum torque of 1.8 mNm was obtained.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-05-07", "authors": ["BurhanettinKoc", "SerraCagatay", "KenjiUchino"], "doi": "10.1109/58.996568"}
{"title": "Efficiency of excitation of piezoceramic transducers at antiresonance frequency.", "abstract": "The efficiency of piezoceramic transducers excited at both the resonance and antiresonance frequency was investigated. Losses in piezoceramics are phenomenologically considered to have three coupled mechanisms: dielectric, mechanical, and piezoelectric losses. Expressions for the resonance and antiresonance quality factors, which ultimately determine transducer efficiency, have been received on the basis of complex material constants for both stiffened and unstiffened vibration modes. Comparison of electric and mechanical fields, thermal and electrical losses of power supply, and their distribution in the transducer volume have been made. For a given constant mechanical displacement of the transducer top, the required electric voltage applied to the transducer at the antiresonance frequency is proportional to the resonance quality factor, but the changes in the intrinsic electric and mechanical field characteristics in the common case are not too essential. The requirements on the piezoceramic parameters, types of transducer vibration, and especially on the factor of piezoelectric losses in a range of physically valid values were established to provide maximal quality factors at the antiresonance frequency.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-05-07", "authors": ["Alex VMezheritsky"], "doi": "10.1109/58.996567"}

{"title": "Detection and characterization of GTP-binding proteins in the chloroplast envelope of spinach (Spinacia oleracea).", "abstract": "Proteins binding guanosine triphosphate (GTP) have emerged as important regulators in several cellular processes in plants. To investigate any role of such proteins in chloroplast functions, we subjected envelope, stroma and thylakoid fractions isolated from spinach chloroplasts to two different GTP-binding assays. With both methods, we detected GTP-specific binding only in the envelope fraction. Two chloroplast envelope proteins with the apparent molecular weights of 30.5 and 33.5 kDa, respectively, bound [alpha-32P]GTP after SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto a PVDF-membrane and renaturation. Both proteins were intrinsic proteins located in the outer chloroplast envelope. Also, when the fractions were incubated with [alpha-32P]GTP, followed by periodate oxidation and borohydride reduction to cross-link GTP to proteins, two proteins in the envelope fraction, of apparent molecular weights of 28 and 39 kDa, appeared to specifically bind GTP. When agents that stimulate heterotrimeric G-proteins, cholera toxin or the mastoparan analogue mas7, were added to isolated chloroplast envelope, the binding of radiolabelled GTP to the 39 kDa protein, a protein of the inner chloroplast envelope, was stimulated, whereas GTP-binding of the 28 kDa protein, a protein of the outer envelope, was unchanged. Mas7 also stimulated synthesis of monogalactosyl diacylglycerol in isolated chloroplast envelope. The occurrence and regulation of GTP-binding proteins in the chloroplast envelope suggests that GTP-binding proteins could be involved in communication with the extraplastidic compartment during chloroplast biogenesis and development.", "journal": "Physiologia plantarum", "date": "2002-05-02", "authors": ["J.

{"title": "Receptive fields and response properties of neurons in the star-nosed mole's somatosensory fovea.", "abstract": "Star-nosed moles have an extraordinary mechanosensory system consisting of 22 densely innervated nasal appendages covered with thousands of sensitive touch domes. A single appendage acts as the fovea and the star is constantly shifted to touch this foveal appendage to objects of interest. Here we investigated the receptive fields on the star and the response properties of 144 neurons in the mole's primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Excitatory receptive fields were defined by recording multiunit activity from the S1 representations of the nasal appendages that form the star, while stimulating the touch domes on the skin surface with a small probe. Receptive fields were among the smallest reported for mammalian glabrous skin, averaging <1 mm(2). The smallest receptive fields were found for the fovea representation, corresponding to its greater cortical magnification. Single units were then isolated, primarily from the representation of the somatosensory fovea, and the skin surface was stimulated with a small probe attached to a piezoelectric wafer controlled by a computer interface. The response properties of neurons and the locations of inhibitory surrounds were evaluated with two complementary approaches. In the first set of experiments, single microelectrodes were used to isolate unit activity in S1, and data were collected for stimulation to different areas of the sensory star. In the second set of experiments, a multi-electrode array (4 electrodes spaced at 200 microm in a linear sequence) was used to simultaneously record from isolated units in different cortical areas representing different parts of the sensory periphery. These experiments revealed a short-latency excitatory discharge to stimulation of the fovea followed by a long-lasting suppression of spontaneous activity. Sixty-one percent of neurons responded with an excitatory OFF response at the end of the stimulus; the remaining 39% of cells did not respond or were inhibited at stimulus offset. Stimulation of areas surrounding the central receptive field often revealed inhibitory surrounds. Forty percent of the neurons that responded to mechanosensory stimulation of the receptive field center were inhibited by stimulation of surrounding areas of skin on the same appendage. In contrast to neurons in rodent barrels, few neurons within a stripe representing an appendage responded to stimulation of neighboring (nonprimary) appendages on the snout. The small receptive fields, short latencies, and inhibitory surrounds are consistent with the star's role in rapidly determining the locations and identities of objects in a complex tactile environment.", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "date": "2002-04-27", "authors": ["Robert N SSachdev", "Kenneth CCatania"], "doi": "10.1152/jn.2002.87.5.2602"}

Also, the method was compatible with preceding immunostaining on the same membrane. Furthermore, an intensifying method for proteins in silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels was developed based on Gallyas' histochemical intensifier. This method was applied to proteins separated by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and visualized by one of several silver-staining methods. Maximal intensification was achieved for the less sensitive but fast acidic silver-staining protocols, but even for the very sensitive alkaline protocols a significant increase in signal to noise ratio was obtained.

Fertilization rate (pronucleus formation and cleavage) at 20 h after injection of spermatozoa was not significantly different between fresh and frozen-thawed sperm groups in either equine or bovine oocytes. Pronucleus formation after injection of spermatozoa into bovine oocytes was significantly higher than that for equine oocytes (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in cleavage rate or average number of nuclei at 96 h between equine oocytes injected with fresh or frozen-thawed spermatozoa. However, embryos developed in vivo for 96 h had a significantly higher number of nuclei in both sperm treatments compared with those cultured in vitro. These results indicate that good activation rates may be obtained after injection of either fresh or frozen-thawed equine spermatozoa without additional activation treatment. Injection of frozen-thawed equine spermatozoa results in similar embryo development to that obtained with fresh equine spermatozoa. In vitro culture of equine zygotes in G1.2 medium results in a similar cleavage rate but reduced number of cells compared with in vivo culture within the oviduct.

{"title": "Sensitive fluorescent detection of protein on nylon membranes.", "abstract": "Detection of antigen immobilized on membranes, as in Western transfers and dot enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), often employ antibody-enzyme conjugates and chemiluminescent or precipitated colored reaction products. Although chemiluminescent markers are sensitive, they are time-consuming because of their required exposure to X-ray film and the presence of background artifacts sometimes limits their use. This report demonstrates that direct fluorescent detection technique using nylon membranes that has higher sensitivity than chemiluminescent methods is easier to perform and has a uniform, low background. An alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody was compared with antibody conjugated to a fluorescent phycobiliprotein (allophycocyanin) for sensitivity in both Western transfers and dot ELISA assays using mouse IgG as the membrane-bound antigen. Direct fluorescent detection of antigen-antibody complexes on positively charged nylon membrane provided better sensitivity and lower background than similar conditions using enzyme amplification and chemiluminescent detection on either nylon or PVDF membranes. Processing time was reduced by the elimination of steps associated with substrate incubation, washing and X-ray film exposures required for chemiluminescence detection. These data support the view that direct fluorescent detection can represent a significant improvement in assay sensitivity and reduction in time compared with more traditional chemiluminescent detection techniques employed in the conduct of Western transfers and dot ELISA studies.", "journal": "Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods", "date": "2002-03-07", "authors": ["AndrewDubitsky", "DamienDeCollibus", "Girolamo AOrtolano"], "doi": "10.1016/s0165-022x(01)00243-3"}

The numbers of naturally occurring enteroviruses recovered by the VIRMETADEN method were significantly higher than those obtained by standard plaque assay. For prefiltration of sewage samples, low protein binding polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes of 0.65 and 5 microm pore size proved to be at least as good as prefilters used previously, both in the volume that could be filtered and in the low virus retention. Regarding decontamination, 0.22 microm pore size PVDF membranes were as good as chloroform treatment. Alternatively, decontamination with 0.05% phenol followed by filtration through 0.65 microm PVDF membrane filters proved to be an excellent method for clarifying and decontaminating the sample prior to enumerating viruses using the VIRMETADEN method. It allows good recovery and greater decontaminated sample volumes. The application of VIRMETADEN to decontaminated raw sewage and secondary effluent gave recoveries of approximately 100% of vaccinal polioviruses seeded in sewage.

We describe a new technique for the identification of peptides covalently modified with the maleimide cross-linker o-phenylenebismaleimide (OPBM). The method can identify labeled peptides without the use of sophisticated instrumentation or radioactive markers and takes advantage of the separating power of RPLC and of the sensitivity of immunoblotting. Chloroplast ATPase F1 was labeled at a single cysteine residue by OPBM and trypsinized. Fractions collected by RPLC were bound to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Despite the small size of the OPBM-labeled peptide (1.84 kDa) it was possible to immobilize it on PVDF by using glutaraldehyde to conjugate the peptide to a larger, unlabeled protein. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the cross-linker N,N',1,5-naphthalenebismaleimide (NBM) cross-react with OPBM. These antibodies detected the presence of OPBM displayed on the PVDF and correctly identified the RPLC fraction containing the OPBM-labeled peptide as verified by both mass spectroscopy and radiolabeling of OPBM. This method could be adapted to detect the presence of linear epitopes recognized by an antibody and is a broadly applicable technique for the immunodetection of peptides.", "journal": "Analytical biochemistry", "date": "2002-03-07", "authors": ["YoavEvron", "Eric AJohnson", "SimeonPinaula", "Richard EMcCarty"], "doi": "10.1006/abio.2001.5538"}

Incubation of MIA PaCa-2 at 45 degrees C for 30 min decreased the cell growth rate and cell viability without causing chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Incubation at 51 degrees C for 30 min suppressed cell growth and again led to death without DNA fragmentation. The cell death was associated with the loss of an intracellular protein of M(r) 17,500 and pI 5.2 on 2-DE gel. This protein was determined to be eukaryotic initiation factor SA (eIF-5A) by microsequencing of the N-terminal region of peptide fragments obtained by cyanogen bromide treatment of the protein blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The sequences detected were QXSALRKNGFVVLKGRP and STSKTGXHGHAKVHLVGID, which were homologous with the sequence of eIF-5A from Gln 20 to Pro 36 and from Ser 43 to Asp 61, respectively. Furthermore, the result of sequencing suggested that the protein was an active form of hypusinated eIF-5A, because Lys 46 could be detected but not Lys 49, which is the site for hypusination.

Non-linear imaging uses the harmonics component, which is generated by tissues or by contrast agents. Different modalities can be used to separate harmonics from fundamental bands from the received signal. New Doppler modes have been developed, whereas grey-scale flow imaging allows the simultaneous imaging of blood flow and tissues. Compounding techniques improve the contrast resolution of tissues and reduce artefacts. If 3D techniques are now currently available, real-time 4D imaging has been recently introduced.

Here we examine whether the motility satisfies the reciprocal relationship, the characteristic of piezoelectricity, by measuring charge displacement induced by stretching the cell with known force. The efficiency of inducing charge displacement was membrane potential dependent. The maximum efficiency of inducing charge displacement by force was approximately 20 fC/nN for 50-microm-long lateral membrane. The efficiency per cell stretching was 0.1 pC/microm. We found that these values are consistent with the reciprocal relationship based on the voltage sensitivity of approximately 20 nm/mV for 50-microm-long cell and force production of 0.1 nN/mV by the cell. We can thus conclude that the membrane motor in the outer hair cell satisfies a necessary condition for piezoelectricity and that the hair cell's piezoelectric coefficient of 20 fC/nN is four orders of magnitude greater than the best man-made material.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2002-02-28", "authors": ["Xiao-xiaDong", "MarkOspeck", "Kuni HIwasa"], "doi": "10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75481-7"}

The two monitors were alternately allocated to the left or right hands of 20 patients. T(1)%, the first twitch of the train-of-four (TOF), and the TOF ratio (T(4)/T(1)) were used for evaluating the neuromuscular block. There was no significant difference in the mean (min) plus minus SD onset time or time to 0.8 TOF ratio recovery measured by the M-NMT (1.5 plus/minus 0.3, 49.4 plus/minus 8.1) compared with MMG (1.8 plus/minus 0.6, 50.9 plus/minus 9.9), respectively. However, the time (min) to 25% T(1) recovery was significantly longer when monitored by the M-NMT (25.6 plus/minus 8) than by the MMG (20.2 plus/minus 6.3). During recovery from neuromuscular block, the difference between the TOF ratios measured by the two monitors showed a bias of -0.031, and the limits of agreement (bias plus/minus 1.96 SD) were -0.281 and +0.22. The M-NMT monitor could determine the time to tracheal intubation as well as full recovery from neuromuscular block, but it lagged behind the MMG in determining the time to rocuronium repeat dose administration.\nCompared with the Relaxometer mechanomyograph, the neuromuscular transmission module could equally indicate time to tracheal intubation and full recovery from 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium neuromuscular block.

This paper investigates the physical effects of having a regular array of actuator and sensor pairs that are connected only by local feedback loops. An array of 4 x 4 force actuators and velocity sensors is first simulated, for which such a decentralized controller can be shown to be unconditionally stable. Significant reductions in both the kinetic energy of the panel and in its radiated sound power can be obtained for an optimal value of feedback gain, although higher values of feedback gain can induce extra resonances in the system and degrade the performance. A more practical transducer pair, consisting of a piezoelectric actuator and velocity sensor, is also investigated and the simulations suggest that a decentralized controller with this arrangement is also stable over a wide range of feedback gains. The resulting reductions in kinetic energy and sound power are not as great as with the force actuators, due to the extra resonances being more prominent and at lower frequencies, but are still worthwhile. This suggests that an array of independent modular systems, each of which included an actuator, a sensor, and a local feedback control loop, could be a simple and robust method of controlling broadband sound transmission when integrated into a panel.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2002-02-28", "authors": ["Stephen JElliott", "PaoloGardonio", "Thomas CSors", "Michael JBrennan"], "doi": "10.1121/1.1433810"}

The imprinted membranes are assembled on piezoelectric Au quartz crystals or Au electrodes via electropolymerization or on the gate surface of an ISFET device by radical polymerization.

While the microgravimetric QCM measurements reflect the swelling of the polymers upon the association of the nucleotides with the recognition sites, the ISFET response is due to the charging of the polymer membrane as a result of the formation of the nucleotide-boronate complex.

{"title": "Effect of partial incision of the zona pellucida by piezo-micromanipulator for in vitro fertilization using frozen-thawed mouse spermatozoa on the developmental rate of embryos transferred at the 2-cell stage.", "abstract": "Cryopreservation of mouse spermatozoa is widely used, although considerable strain differences in fertilization rates using frozen-thawed mouse spermatozoa have been described. The C57BL/6 mouse strain is a very widely used for establishment of transgenic mice, but the fertilization rate associated with the use of cryopreserved C57BL/6 spermatozoa is very low compared with rates for other inbred strains. We have recently solved this difficulty by in vitro fertilization (IVF) in combination with partial zona pellucida dissection (PZD). However, this technique requires culture of fertilized eggs with PZD in vitro up to morula or blastocyst stage before transfer into the uterus because blastomeres are lost after transfer into the oviduct because of the relatively large artificial slit in the zona pellucida. To overcome this problem, we performed a partial zona pellucida incision by using a piezo-micromanipulator (ZIP) for IVF with frozen-thawed mouse spermatozoa. The blunt end of the micropipette touched the surface of the zona pellucida of the oocytes, and piezo pulses were used to incise the zona pellucida while the pipette was moved along by the surface of zona pellucida. The length of the incision was pir/6 microm. When cumulus-free ZIP and PZD oocytes were inseminated with frozen-thawed genetically modified C57BL/6J spermatozoa, the fertilization rates of ZIP and PZD oocytes were 52% and 48%, respectively. After embryo transfer at the 2-cell stage, 18% and 2% of the transferred embryos with ZIP and PZD developed to term, respectively. This difference was significant (P < 0.05). When ZIP and PZD zygotes were cultured to blastocyst stage and subsequently transferred to uterine horns of recipient animals, the difference between ZIP and PZD zygotes for development rate to full term was not significant. Our results indicate that ZIP is an effective alternative technique for IVF using cryopreserved mouse spermatozoa and subsequent embryo transfer.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2002-01-24", "authors": ["YosukeKawase", "TakamitsuIwata", "OtoyaUeda", "NobuoKamada", "TakanoriTachibe", "YukariAoki", "Kou-ichiJishage", "HiroshiSuzuki"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod66.2.381"}
{"title": "Cooling of electrons in a silicon inversion layer.", "abstract": "Low temperature cooling of two-dimensional electrons in silicon-metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors is studied experimentally and found to be more effective than expected from the bulk electron-phonon coupling in silicon. The extracted heat transfer rate to phonons depends cubically on electron temperature, suggesting that piezoelectric coupling, which is absent in bulk silicon, dominates over deformation potential. As a result, at 100 mK, electrons farther than approximately 100 microm from the contacts are mostly cooled by phonons. Using long devices and low excitation voltage we measure electron resistivity down to approximately 100 mK and find that some of the \"metallic\" curves turn insulating below approximately 300 mK.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2002-01-22", "authors": ["OPrus", "MReznikov", "USivan", "VPudalov"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.016801"}
{"title": "Lectin isolation and detection of N-glycoproteins bearing sialic acid and L-fucose residues in human colorectal mucosa and in adenocarcinoma biopsies.", "abstract": "A method to improve the reactivity to specific lectins of N-glycoproteins isolated from human colorectal mucosa and from adenocarcinoma biopsies was developed using a combination of techniques. Total protein extracts were subjected to affinity chromatography, using the immobilised lectin Concanavalin A coupled to Sepharose, by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC). N-glycoprotein enriched fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and incubated with various lectins. Digoxigenin-conjugated SNA I and MAA lectins were used to detect sialic acid residues. Biotin-conjugated UEA I lectin was used to detect L-fucose residues. By this method, lectin-binding N-glycoproteins were found in a broad relative molecular mass (Mr) range (from 47 to 205 kDa). No tissue-specific N-glycoproteins were observed when human colorectal mucosa and adenocarcinoma samples were compared.", "journal": "International journal of oncology", "date": "2002-01-15", "authors": ["AlejandroDe Carlos", "AmadoCaride-Castro", "Vicenta SMartinez-Zorzano", "Mar\u00eda P\u00e1ezDe La Cadena", "Francisco JRodr\u00edguez-Berrocal"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Biocompatibility of anionic collagen matrix as scaffold for bone healing.", "abstract": "The basic approach to the treatment of bone defects involves the use of scaffolds to favor tissue growth. Although several bioscaffolds have been proposed for this purpose, the search for new and enhanced materials continues in an attempt to address the drawbacks of the present ones. Modifying current materials can be a fast and cheap way to develop new ones. Among them, type I collagen allows its structure to be modified using relatively simple techniques. By means of an alkaline treatment, anionic collagen with enhanced piezoelectric properties can be obtained through hydrolysis of carboxyamides groups of asparagine and glutamine residues from collagen in carboxylic. The process applied to a raw source of collagen, bovine pericardium, provided a sponge-like structure, with heterogeneous pore size, and, moreover, the complete removal of interstitial cells. For the evaluation of the biocompatibility of such matrices, they were implanted in surgically created bone defects in rat tibias. Empty defects served as controls. This experimental model allowed a preliminary evaluation of the osteoconductiveness of the matrices. The histological results presented a low inflammatory response and bone formation within a short period of time, similar to that of controls. The low cost of production associated to the biocompatibility and osteoconductivity performance make the anionic collagen matrices promising alternatives for bone defects treatment.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2002-01-05", "authors": ["Lenaldo BRocha", "GilbertoGoissis", "Marcos ARossi"], "doi": "10.1016/s0142-9612(01)00126-0"}
{"title": "Ready-made matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization target plates coated with thin matrix layer for automated sample deposition in high-density array format.", "abstract": "The methodology for ready-made matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) target plates covered with an optimized thin layer consisting of matrix and nitrocellulose has been developed. Piezoelectric microdispensing enabled sample depositions in a high-density array format of 2000 sample depositions on a conventionally sized target plate (45 x 47 mm). The sample depositions were made reproducibly in a fully automated mode by using an in-house developed computer-controlled piezoelectric flow-through microdispenser. Additionally, the piezoelectric technique facilitated significant analyte enrichment that increased the detection sensitivity. The MS signal was obtained rapidly, generally within ten laser pulses. An airbrush device was used to generate a fine spray of matrix and nitrocellulose dissolved in acetone. The acetone evaporated instantly when reaching the target plate leaving the entire surface with a thin and uniform matrix/nitrocellulose coating consisting of very small crystals of matrix embedded in the nitrocellulose. These crystals acted as a seed-layer on subsequent analyte depositions, rendering homogeneous sample spots when using alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as matrix. The relative standard deviation of the signal intensity between spots was (20-30)% (n = 30). The detection sensitivity was improved by restricting the sample spot diameter to 300 microm. The spot size was affected by the deposition rate and the evaporation rate of the dispensed sample volume. Mass spectra of a 25-amol peptide mixture deposition were successfully recorded.", "journal": "Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM", "date": "2001-12-26", "authors": ["TassoMiliotis", "SvenKjellstr\u00f6m", "JohanNilsson", "ThomasLaurell", "Lars-ErikEdholm", "Gy\u00f6rgyMarko-Varga"], "doi": "10.1002/rcm.542"}
{"title": "Quartz tuning fork biosensor.", "abstract": "The use of quartz tuning forks for biosensor applications is investigated. The basis of the sensor is to coat the tuning fork surfaces with specific biomolecules and measure subsequent mass loading from the selective binding of complementary analytes. Two experimental set-ups are evaluated, direct mechanical excitation and self-excitation. Mechanical excitation is achieved by mounting the fork on a piezoelectric plate and it is found that the change in oscillation amplitude on adsorption can be monitored to give the change in mass. However, a major drawback is that the sensitivity is determined by the Q-factor, which varies significantly between different sensors and different experimental arrangements. In self-excitation mode, tuning fork motion is activated and detected by placing the fork within a tuned circuit. Using self-excitation mode, anti-human IgG modified tuning forks can sense the binding of human IgG in the range of 5-100 microg ml(-1). The significance of this study is that quartz tuning forks are routinely made using standard microfabrication process, thus suggesting the possibility of facile microfabrication of arrays of quartz sensors.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2001-12-18", "authors": ["XiaodiSu", "ChangchunDai", "JianZhang", "Sean JO'Shea"], "doi": "10.1016/s0956-5663(01)00249-4"}
{"title": "Self-assembled monolayers as a tunable platform for biosensor applications.", "abstract": "Considerable attention has been drawn during the last two decades to functionalize noble metal surfaces by forming ordered organic films of few nm to several hundred-nm thickness. Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) provides one simple route to functionalize electrode surfaces by organic molecules (both aliphatic and aromatic) containing free anchor groups such as thiols, disulphides, amines, silanes, or acids. The monolayer produced by self-assembly allows tremendous flexibility with respect to several applications depending upon their terminal functionality (hydrophilic or hydrophobic control) or by varying the chain length (distance control). For example, SAM of long chain alkane thiol produces a highly packed and ordered surface, which can provide a membrane like microenvironment, useful for immobilising biological molecules. The high selectivity of biological molecules integrated with an electrochemical, optical or piezoelectric transduction mode of analyte recognition offers great promise to exploit them as efficient and accurate biosensors. It is demonstrated with suitable examples that monolayer design plays a key role in controlling the performance of these SAM based biosensors, irrespective of the immobilisation strategy and sensing mechanism.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2001-12-18", "authors": ["Nirmalya KChaki", "KVijayamohanan"], "doi": "10.1016/s0956-5663(01)00277-9"}
{"title": "Detection of hepatitis B virus by piezoelectric biosensor.", "abstract": "A highly sensitive piezoelectric HBV DNA biosensor has been developed based on the sensitive mass-transducing function of the quartz crystal microbalance and the speciality of nucleic acid hybridization reaction. HBV nucleic acid probe was immobilized onto the gold electrodes of a 9 MHz AT-cut piezoelectric quartz crystal with the polyethyleneimine adhesion, glutaraldehyde cross-linking (PEI-Glu) method or the physical adsorption method. The coated crystal with the PEI-Glu method to immobilized HBV nucleic acid probe showed the better results than the physical adsorption method with respect to sensitivity reproducibility and stability. The frequency shifts of hybridization have better linear relationship with the amount of HBV DNA, when the amount was in range 0.02-0.14 microg/ml.
