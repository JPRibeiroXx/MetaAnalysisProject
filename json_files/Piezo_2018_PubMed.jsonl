Dendrimers bearing a pyrene moiety were selected to play the role of spacers between the graphene surface of the MNPs and the PVDF chains, the pyrene unit being expected to interact with the surface of the MNPs. The pyrene-tagged dendritic spacer 11 decorated with ten acetylenic units was prepared and fully characterized. Azido-functionalized PVDF chains were then grafted onto each branch of the dendrimer using Huisgen's [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. Next, the association of the resulting pyrene-tagged dendritic PVDF 13 with commercially available Co/C MNPs by \u03c0-stacking interactions was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. Evaluated were the stability of the \u03c0-stacking interactions when the temperature increased and the reversibility of the process when the temperature decreased. Also, hybrid MNPs were prepared from pyrene-tagged dendrimers decorated either with acetylenic functions (11) or with PVDF branches (13), and they were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and comparative elemental analysis was carried out with naked MNPs.", "journal": "ChemPlusChem", "date": "2020-01-18", "authors": ["EnriqueFolgado", "MarcGuerre", "NidhalMimouni", "VincentColli\u00e8re", "ChristianBijani", "KathleenMoineau-Chane Ching", "Anne-MarieCaminade", "VincentLadmiral", "BrunoAm\u00e9duri", "ArmelleOuali"], "doi": "10.1002/cplu.201800471"}
{"title": "Viscosity monitoring during hemodiluted blood coagulation using optical coherence elastography.", "abstract": "Rapid and accurate clot diagnostic systems are needed for the assessment of hemodiluted blood coagulation. We develop a real-time optical coherence elastography (OCE) system, which measures the attenuation coefficient of a compressional wave induced by a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) in a drop of blood using optical coherence tomography (OCT), for the determination of viscous properties during the dynamic whole blood coagulation process. Changes in the viscous properties increase the attenuation coefficient of the sample. Consequently, dynamic blood coagulation status can be monitored by relating changes of the attenuation coefficient to clinically relevant coagulation metrics, including the initial coagulation time and the clot formation rate. This system was used to characterize the influence of activator kaolin and the influence of hemodilution with either NaCl 0.9% or hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6% on blood coagulation. The results show that PZT-OCE is sensitive to coagulation abnormalities and is able to characterize blood coagulation status based on viscosity-related attenuation coefficient measurements. PZT-OCE can be used for point-of-care testing for diagnosis of coagulation disorders and monitoring of therapies.", "journal": "IEEE journal of selected topics in quantum electronics : a publication of the IEEE Lasers and Electro-optics Society", "date": "2019-12-21", "authors": ["XiangqunXu", "JiangZhu", "JunxiaoYu", "ZhongpingChen"], "doi": "10.1109/JSTQE.2018.2833455"}

The aim of this study is to determine the intra- and intersession reliability of the new PVDF nasal sensor measurement of unilateral and combined nasal parameters in a group of healthy subjects. Two identical nasal sensors: for right nostril (RN) and left nostril (LN) were designed using piezoelectric natured PVDF films. Twenty subjects were studied. To evaluate the repeatability, total three sets of PVDF sensor measurements were recorded, two sets were taken 5\u00a0min apart during same session without repositioning the PVDF nasal sensors and two more sets were taken during 1\u00a0h apart successively, by repositioning the PVDF nasal sensor. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of PVDF sensor measurements for intra- and intersession showed a high and greater repeatability over time for all the combined (mean) and unilateral (RN and LN) values. In both healthy and patients, ICC values for both intra- and intersession measurements were\u2009\u2265\u20090.80 confirming strong reliability and also almost all of the coefficients of variation for the same parameters were low (below 10%).

Herein, by using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we reveal that this failure stems from the loss of connectivity between the silicon (or its agglomerates), graphite, and PVDF binder because of the mechanical stresses experienced during battery cycling. More importantly, we reveal for the first time that the PVDF binder undergoes chemical decomposition during the cycling of not only the composite but also the Si-only or even graphite-only electrodes despite the excellent battery performance of the latter. Through X-ray photoemission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques, LiF was identified as the predominant decomposition product. We show that the distribution of LiF in the electrodes due to the differences in the interactions between PVDF and either Si or graphite could correlate with the performance of the battery.

{"title": "Electrospun Piezoelectric Polymer Nanofiber Layers for Enabling in Situ Measurement in High-Performance Composite Laminates.", "abstract": "This article highlights the effects from composite manufacturing parameters on fiber-reinforced composite laminates modified with layers of piezoelectric thermoplastic nanofibers and a conductive electrode layer. Such modifications have been used for enabling in situ deformation measurement in high-performance aerospace and renewable energy composites. Procedures for manufacturing high-performance composites are well-known and standardized. However, this does not imply that modifications via addition of functional layers (e.g., piezoelectric nanofibers) while following the same manufacturing procedures can lead to a successful multifunctional composite structure (e.g., for enabling in situ measurement). This article challenges success of internal embedment of piezoelectric nanofibers in standard manufacturing of high-performance composites via relying on composite process specifications and parameters only. It highlights that the process parameters must be revised for manufacturing of multifunctional composites. Several methods have been used to lay up and manufacture composites such as electrospinning the thermoplastic nanofibers, processing an inter digital electrode (IDE) made by conductive epoxy-graphene resin, and prepreg autoclave manufacturing aerospace grade laminates. The purpose of fabrication of IDE was to use a resin type (HexFlow RTM6) for the conductive layer similar to that used for the composite. Thereby, material mismatch is avoided and the structural integrity is sustained via mitigation of downgrading effects on the interlaminar properties. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy analyses have been carried out in the material characterization phase. Pulsed thermography and ultrasonic C-scanning were used for the localization of conductive resin embedded within the composite laminates.

Additionally, its stability, possible formation, elastic, and electronic properties were analyzed, and for comparison purpose, the porous graphene and graphenylene nanotubes were studied. From the elastic properties study, it was found that IGP-BNNTs exhibited a higher rigidity because of the influence of the superficial porous area, as compared to PBNNTs.

Electrically powered non-ferromagnetic motors based on piezoelectric elements have shown to be well suited for MRI robots. However, even avoiding ferrous materials, the high metal content on commercially available motors still cause distortions to the magnetic fields. We construct semi-custom piezoelectric actuators wherein the quantity of conductive material is minimized and demonstrate that the distortion issues can be partly addressed through substituting several of these components for plastic equivalents, while maintaining motor functionality. Distortion was measured by assessing the RMS change in position of 49 centroid points in a 12.5mm square grid of a gelatin-filled phantom. The metal motor caused a distortion of up to 4.91mm versus 0.55mm for the plastic motor. An additional SNR drop between motor off and motor spinning of approximately 20% was not statistically different for metal versus plastic (p=0.36).", "journal": "International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition : [proceedings].

{"title": "Wearable energy harvesters generating electricity from low-frequency human limb movement.", "abstract": "A wearable energy harvester technology is developed for generating electricity from the movement of human joints. A micro-electroplated ferromagnetic nickel cantilever is integrated with a piezoelectric element and bonded on a flexible substrate. Based on the magnetic interaction between the magnetized cantilever and a magnet on the substrate, a novel vertical-vibration frequency-up-conversion (FUC) structure is formed to generate stable amounts of electric energy per cycle from the horizontal substrate stretching/rebounding. The two ends of the flexible substrate are attached on both sides of a limb joint to transform joint rotation into substrate stretching. During limb movement, the flexible substrate is horizontally stretched and rebounded, causing the cantilever to vertically release from and return to the magnet, thereby exciting the piezoelectric cantilever into resonant generation. Since the horizontal low-frequency limb movement is perpendicular to the vertical high-frequency resonance, the stretch has little influence on the resonance of the cantilever. Thus the generated energy is always stable within a wide frequency range of limb movements. The performance of the novel harvester is experimentally verified using a stretching/rebounding movement cycle, where the cycle corresponds to the frequency range of 0.5-5.0\u2009Hz. Within one stretching/rebounding movement cycle, the generated electric energy is stable in the approximate range of 0.56-0.69\u2009\u03bcJ for the whole frequency range. Two flexible harvesters are worn on the human elbow and knee for a body kinetic energy harvesting test. Considerable power can always be generated under typical low-frequency limb movements, such as squatting, walking, jogging, and fast running, where the peak-to-peak generated voltages are always approximately 4.0\u2009V.

{"title": "Fabrication and testing of polymer-based capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers for medical imaging.", "abstract": "The ultrasonic transducer industry is dominated by piezoelectric materials. As an emerging alternative, capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) offer wider bandwidth, better integration with electronics, and ease of fabricating large arrays. CMUTs have a sealed cavity between a fixed electrode and a suspended metalized membrane. Manufacturing cost and sensitivity are limiting factors in current CMUTs that depend on the fabrication equipment and, especially, on the materials used. For widespread use of CMUTs, a much lower fabrication cost that uses inexpensive materials, which maintain or improve upon existing sensitivity, is needed. Herein, a new fabrication process is described for polymer-based CMUTs (polyCMUTs) using\u00a0the photopolymer SU-8 and Omnicoat.

Here, we introduce a needle-shaped ultrathin piezoelectric microsystem that can be injected or mounted directly onto conventional biopsy needles and used to distinguish abnormal tissue during the capture of biopsy samples, through quantitative real-time measurements of variations in tissue modulus. Using well-characterized synthetic soft materials, explanted tissues and animal models, we establish experimentally and theoretically the fundamental operating principles of the microsystem, as well as key considerations in materials choices and device designs. Through systematic tests on human livers with cancerous lesions, we demonstrate that the piezoelectric microsystem provides quantitative agreement with magnetic resonance elastography, the clinical gold standard for the measurement of tissue modulus.

{"title": "3D Printing Technologies for Flexible Tactile Sensors toward Wearable Electronics and Electronic Skin.", "abstract": "3D printing has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Over the past three decades, various 3D printing technologies have been developed including photopolymerization-based, materials extrusion-based, sheet lamination-based, binder jetting-based, power bed fusion-based and direct energy deposition-based processes. 3D printing offers unparalleled flexibility and simplicity in the fabrication of highly complex 3D objects. Tactile sensors that emulate human tactile perceptions are used to translate mechanical signals such as force, pressure, strain, shear, torsion, bend, vibration, etc. into electrical signals and play a crucial role toward the realization of wearable electronics and electronic skin. To date, many types of 3D printing technologies have been applied in the manufacturing of various types of tactile sensors including piezoresistive, capacitive and piezoelectric sensors. This review attempts to summarize the current state-of-the-art 3D printing technologies and their applications in tactile sensors for wearable electronics and electronic skin. The applications are categorized into five aspects: 3D-printed molds for microstructuring substrate, electrodes and sensing element; 3D-printed flexible sensor substrate and sensor body for tactile sensors; 3D-printed sensing element; 3D-printed flexible and stretchable electrodes for tactile sensors; and fully 3D-printed tactile sensors.

The tensile strength and modulus were improved to 48 MPa and 1.5 GPa, respectively. The shrinkage of the membrane was only 6.6% at 180 \u00b0C, at which temperature the commercial PE separator melted down. The reinforcement in mechanical and thermal properties is associated with multiple PEI nanofibrils oriented along the fiber axis.

{"title": "Aligned P(VDF-TrFE) Nanofibers for Enhanced Piezoelectric Directional Strain Sensing.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning have drawn increasing levels of attention in the fields of flexible sensors and nanogenerators. However, the directional dependence of piezoelectricity of electrospun nanofibers remains elusive. In this study, the piezoelectric performances of individual nanofibers are characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), while the effects of annealing on \u03b2-phase crystallinities are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The experimental results reveal that the as-spun P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers form higher content of \u03b2-phase compared with spin-coated films, and the content of \u03b2-phase increases by annealing. The annealed P(VDF-TrFE) nanofiber exhibits distinct vertical polarization switching characteristics. The high piezoelectric output in the thickness direction and low piezoelectric output in the longitudinal direction of the nanofiber mats further confirm that the preferential dipole orientation of electrospun P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers is normal to the surface of the substrate. Highly aligned P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers show directional strain sensing ability due to the piezoelectric and mechanical anisotropy.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-04-11", "authors": ["YonggangJiang", "LonglongGong", "XiaoheHu", "YongZhao", "HuaweiChen", "LinFeng", "DeyuanZhang"], "doi": "10.3390/polym10040364\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.059\n10.1002/adma.201104810\n10.1002/adma.200904355\n10.1038/srep07887\n10.1021/nn400848j\n10.3390/s17061220\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.04.016\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.07.006\n10.1021/acsami.5b09502\n10.1002/aenm.201401891\n10.1038/srep32955\n10.1038/ncomms11108\n10.1039/C4TA01720J\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.01.038\n10.1088/0957-4484/27/9/095401\n10.1039/C5NR01746G\n10.1039/C6NR07781A\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.05.047\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.04.008\n10.1021/nn100845b\n10.1039/C4NR01934B\n10.1039/c1jm11445j\n10.1021/nl0602701\n10.1021/nl9040719\n10.1039/C5RA16604G\n10.1039/C5TA00147A\n10.1063/1.4813909\n10.1039/c4ra01452a\n10.1038/ncomms2639\n10.1021/am508812a\n10.1039/C2EE23530G\n10.1002/marc.201100040\n10.1021/acsami.5b10073\n10.1016/0032-3861(82)90151-3\n10.1002/polb.24379\n10.3390/s17040891\n10.1021/acsnano.6b07961\n10.1021/jp4011026\n10.1007/s10854-017-6556-8\n10.1007/s11434-013-5836-9\n10.7567/JJAP.54.021601\n10.1016/S1672-6529(14)60164-5\n10.1121/1.400512\n10.1098/rsif.2011.0690"}
{"title": "Regulating Dielectric and Ferroelectric Properties of Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) with Inner CH=CH Bonds.", "abstract": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) based ferroelectric polymers have attracted considerable attention both academically and industrially due to their tunable ferroelectric properties. By pinning the conformation of the polymer chain and the ferroelectric phase physically or chemically, the ferroelectric behaviors of PVDF based polymers could be finely turned from normal ferroelectric into relaxor ferroelectric, anti-ferroelectric like, and even linear dielectric. Besides high energy electron irradiation and chemical copolymerization with the bulky monomers, in this work, an alternative strategy is presented to regulate the dielectric and ferroelectric performances of PVDF based ferroelectric polymer for the first time. CH=CH bonds with the desired content are inserted by a controlled dehydrofluorination reaction into a poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) copolymer (TrFE refers to trifluoroethylene) synthesized from the hydrogenation of P(VDF-CTFE) (CTFE refers to chlorothrifluoroethylene). The influence of the CH=CH bonds along with the fabrication conditions on the crystallization and ferroelectric relaxation of the resultant copolymers (referred to P(VDF-TrFE-DB)) was carefully characterized and discussed. The nonrotatable CH=CH bonds result in depressed dielectric and ferroelectric performances in the as-cast films by confining the orientation of ferroelectric grains in P(VDF-TrFE). The normal ferroelectric performance of P(VDF-TrFE) is turned into anti-ferroelectric like behavior in the resultant P(VDF-TrFE-DB). The cleavage of CH=CH bonds is responsible for the recovery of the ferroelectric behavior in the annealed samples. Uniaxial stretching favors the alignment of the polymer chain and ferroelectric domains, which may address the further regulated ferroelectric characters in the stretched samples.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-04-11", "authors": ["YananZhang", "ShaoboTan", "JianWang", "XiaoWang", "WeiweiZhu", "ZhichengZhang"], "doi": "10.3390/polym10030339\n10.1143/JJAP.8.975\n10.1063/1.1653624\n10.1143/JJAP.15.2041\n10.1126/science.220.4602.1115\n10.1021/ma0627119\n10.1002/1521-4095(20021104)14:21<1574::AID-ADMA1574>3.0.CO;2-#\n10.1002/adma.201103542\n10.1063/1.1448661\n10.1021/cr800187m\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.09.022\n10.3390/s110504474\n10.1007/BF00719591\n10.1007/BF01739296\n10.1023/A:1004737000016\n10.1016/j.polymer.2005.06.128\n10.1126/science.280.5372.2101\n10.1021/ma020504c\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.11.005\n10.1021/ma102910v\n10.1039/C2TC00431C\n10.1063/1.4886391\n10.1039/C6PY02119K\n10.1021/ja062306x\n10.1016/0032-3950(79)90201-6\n10.1016/j.jfluchem.2007.02.005\n10.1023/B:JMSC.0000044911.64725.b6\n10.1080/00150199508018419\n10.1143/JJAP.33.214\n10.1002/app.23137\n10.1016/0032-3861(87)90478-2\n10.1016/0079-6700(89)90003-8\n10.1016/S0079-6700(00)00044-7\n10.1021/ma901921h\n10.1021/ma00146a024\n10.1039/C5RA22617A\n10.1039/c3ta11484h\n10.1039/C5RA15149J\n10.1016/j.cap.2009.12.015\n10.1143/JPSJ.79.011012\n10.1063/1.327723"}

To explore the benefits of the structure-related Cu(II) adsorption capacity, the fiber diameters of SiO\u2082@PVDF-HFP nanofibrous membranes were changed which also resulted in the change of their porosity. Taking advantage of the constructed multi-structures and efficient fiber morphology regulation which not only changed the PVDF-HFP nanofibrous membrane from hydrophobic to superhydrophilic but also increased the porosity of the membrane, the SiO\u2082@PVDF-HFP nanofibrous membrane with a smaller diameter and a larger porosity exhibits higher Cu(II) adsorption capacity. The adsorption amount was approximate to 21.9 mg per gram of the membrane, which was higher than that of membranes with larger fiber diameter (smaller porosity) and the smooth one. Furthermore, the model isotherms of Freundlich and Langmuir, as well as the kinetic models of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order were preferred to analyze the adsorption equilibrium data. The Freundlich model and the pseudo-first-order were well fitted to the adsorption experimental data.

In recent years, the literature about orienting PLLA crystals has been promoting new applications for PLLA such as high strength fiberization and piezoelectric properties. This paper presents a new technique to orient the PLLA crystalline through casting under magnetic irradiation. The advantage of this technique is that it is possible to radiate the magnetic field to the PLLA crystalline in an extremely low viscosity environment. Moreover, the heat treatment condition was optimized in order to improve the low crystallinity of casting, and it succeeded in producing a PLLA film with a high degree of orientation and high crystallinity.

Significant improvement in the piezoelectric response of the PVDF membrane was achieved without compromising breathability and flexibility. PVDF is one of the most frequently used piezoelectric polymers due to its high durability and reasonable piezoelectric coefficient values. However, further enhancement of its piezoelectric response is highly desirable for sensor and energy-harvester applications. Previous studies have demonstrated that piezoelectric ceramic and polymer composites can have remarkable piezoelectric properties and flexibility. However, devices made of such composites lack breathability and some present health risks in wearable applications for containing heavy metals. Unlike other piezoelectric ceramics, ZnO is non-toxic material and has been widely used in many applications including cosmetics.

However, the quick polymer crystallization during the quenching process will bring about a dense and thick skin layer and thus decrease permeability markedly. In this paper, a diluent mixture with upper critical solution temperature (UCST) was used to prepare polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane. That is, the separation between diluent (propylene carbonate (PC)) and non-diluent (dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP)) occurred during the quenching process when the temperature of the dope was lower than 110 \u00b0C. The effects of separation between PC and DOTP and the resulting coalescence of DOTP on the PVDF crystallization process, microstructure, and the permeability of the membranes were analyzed. The results showed that the suitable PC/DOTP weight ratio reduced the thickness of the skin layer near the outer surface markedly and resulted in a porous outer surface, and the microstructure evolution process was proposed.

All-optical sound detectors yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio per unit area than piezoelectric detectors and feature wide detection bandwidths that may be more appropriate for optoacoustic applications, enabling several biomedical or industrial applications. Additionally, optical sensing of sound is less sensitive to electromagnetic noise, making it appropriate for a greater spectrum of environments.

However, the full set of the material constants (elastic constants, piezoelectric constants and dielectric constants) of the KNN-CT film have not been reported yet. In this study, all the material constants of a sputter-deposited blanket KNN-CT film were investigated by the resonance responses of MEMS-based piezoelectric resonators and the phase velocities of leaky Lamb waves on a self-suspended membrane.

Presently, this new technology mainly aims at ejecting a low-viscosity medium. Therefore, a device for ejecting high-viscosity molten liquid is designed by analyzing the injection principle of high-viscosity molten liquid. Initially, the cooling mechanism is designed to overcome the defect that the piezoelectric stacks cannot operate in high-temperature conditions. Thereafter, the mathematical model of the liquid velocity in the nozzle is derived, and the factors influencing injection are verified by Fluent. Subsequently, a prototype of the jet printer is fabricated, and the needle velocity is tested by the laser micrometer; the relationship between voltage difference and the needle velocity is also obtained. The experimental results matched the theoretical model well, showing that the voltage difference, needle radius, nozzle diameter, and taper angle are closely related to the injection performance of the 3D jet printer. By using a needle with a radius of 0.4 mm, a nozzle with a diameter of 50 \u03bcm, a taper angle of 90\u00b0, a supply pressure of 0.05 Mpa, and a voltage difference of 98 V, a molten liquid with a viscosity of 8000 cps can be ejected with a minimum average diameter of 275 \u03bcm, and the variation of the droplet diameter is within \u00b13.8%.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2019-02-05", "authors": ["YangYang", "ShoudongGu", "JianfangLiu", "HongyuTian", "QingqingLv"], "doi": "10.3390/mi9110554\n10.1002/adma.201400334\n10.3390/ma11040535\n10.3390/mi6040437\n10.3390/nano8090645\n10.3390/machines6010011\n10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2003.12.004\n10.3390/polym10080922\n10.1016/S0026-2714(03)00192-6\n10.1007/s11431-009-0329-4\n10.1108/EUM0000000006094"}

In addition, many non-natural proteins and peptides presenting amyloidal properties have been used for the fabrication of functional nanomaterials. Similarly, functional metabolite assemblies are also found in nature, demonstrating various physiological roles.

Under Xenon irradiation (300\u202fW), the photocatalytic degradation rate of PVDF/GO/ZnO composite membranes for methylene blue (MB) could reach 86.84%. Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency of the composites membrane for MB was evaluated with different initial concentrations of MB, pH value of the solution, and electron trapping agent-H", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Membrane-type smart metamaterials for multi-modal sound insulation.", "abstract": "Metamaterial provides a promising way to control low-frequency noise, but its narrow bandgap limits its applications. To end this, a membrane-type smart metamaterial with multi-modal sound insulation property is studied. The proposed metamaterial consists of an aluminum membrane bonded with multi-modal resonant piezoelectric resonators. Both simulated and experimental results show that the proposed metamaterial can broaden the locally resonant bandgaps because of the effect of the multi-modal resonance (the percent bandwidths are 0.19 and 0.22 for the lowest mode and higher two modes, respectively). Large multi-modal sound insulations (over 37\u2009dB) are obtained around the designed resonant frequencies in low frequency regime (<2000\u2009Hz) with an ultra-thin thickness (over 1000 times thinner than the acoustic wavelength). It is also demonstrated that the excellent sound insulation property can be tuned by simply adjusting the external circuits instead of modifying the structure itself. The underlying mechanism of the unusual sound insulation of the proposed metamaterial is attributed to the negative effective bending stiffness ", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2019-01-03", "authors": ["XiaodongZhang", "FeiChen", "ZhongshengChen", "GangWang"], "doi": "10.1121/1.5084039"}

That is why the design and control method of soft robotic fish have not been established and they motivate us to make a further study by considering the interaction between flexible structure and surrounding fluid.

Nanocomposite fibres were produced by electrospinning high molecular weight Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-1300 kDa) in the presence of noncovalently functionalised graphene obtained through tip sonication of graphite alcoholic suspensions in the presence of PVP (10 kDa). Bending instability of electrospun jet appears to progressively increase at low graphene concentrations with the result of greater fibre stretching that leads to lower fibre diameter and possibly conformational changes of PVP. Further increase of graphene content seams having the opposite effect leading to greater fibre diameter and Raman spectra similar to the pure PVP electrospun mats. All this has been interpreted on the basis of currently accepted model for bending instability of electrospun jets. The graphene addition does not lower the very high sound absorption coefficient, \u03b1, close to unity, of the electrospun PVP mats in the frequency range 200\u207b800 Hz.

Herein, we efficiently fabricated polyvinylidene fluoride/polyimide (PVDF/PI) side-by-side bicomponent nanofibers based on electrospinning, which resulted in the synergism between PVDF and PI, and eventually obtained the effect of 1 + 1 > 2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize the morphology and chemical structure of nanofibers, indicating that a large number of side-by-side nanofibers were successfully prepared. Further, the thermal stability, mechanical strength, and filtration properties of PVDF/PI were carefully investigated. The results revealed that the bicomponent nanofibers possessed both good mechanical strength and remarkable thermal stability.

The corresponding characterizations of FLG, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy, were carried out. The results of SEM show that the lateral size of as-synthesized FLG is 1\u207b5 \u03bcm. The results of TEM and AFM indicate more than 80% of graphene layers is <10 layers. The most surprising thing is that D/G ratio of graphite and FLG are 0.15 and 0.19, respectively. The result of the similar D/G ratio demonstrates that little structural defects were created via the liquid exfoliation process. Electronic conductivity tests and resistance of composite film, in terms of different contents of graphite/polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and FLG/PVDF, were carried out. Dramatically, the FLG/PVDF composite demonstrates superior performance compared to the graphite/PVDF composite at the same ratio.

{"title": "Mapping intrinsic electromechanical responses at the nanoscale via sequential excitation scanning probe microscopy empowered by deep data.", "abstract": "Ever-increasing hardware capabilities and computation powers have enabled acquisition and analysis of big scientific data at the nanoscale routine, though much of the data acquired often turn out to be redundant, noisy and/or irrelevant to the problems of interest, and it remains nontrivial to draw clear mechanistic insights from pure data analytics. In this work, we use scanning probe microscopy (SPM) as an example to demonstrate deep data methodology for nanosciences, transitioning from brute-force analytics such as data mining, correlation analysis and unsupervised classification to informed and/or targeted causative data analytics built on sound physical understanding. Three key ingredients of such deep data analytics are presented. A sequential excitation scanning probe microscopy (SE-SPM) technique is first developed to acquire high-quality, efficient and physically relevant data, which can be easily implemented on any standard atomic force microscope (AFM). Brute-force physical analysis is then carried out using a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) model, enabling us to derive intrinsic electromechanical coupling of interest. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) is carried out, which not only speeds up the analysis by four orders of magnitude, but also allows a clear physical interpretation of its modes in combination with SHO analysis. A rough piezoelectric material has been probed using such a strategy, enabling us to map its intrinsic electromechanical properties at the nanoscale with high fidelity, where conventional methods fail. The SE in combination with deep data methodology can be easily adapted for other SPM techniques to probe a wide range of functional phenomena at the nanoscale.", "journal": "National science review", "date": "2019-01-01", "authors": ["BoyuanHuang", "Ehsan NasrEsfahani", "JiangyuLi"], "doi": "10.1093/nsr/nwy096"}

Although TKR is common, about 20% of patients report being unhappy with their results. Previous research has pointed to misalignment and loosening as contributing factors to negative outcomes. What is lacking in the field of TKR is a sensory system that can determine the internal loads of the knee in a direct manner. Implant bearings embedded with piezoelectric transducers have already shown promise in providing accurate sensing data. To perform further experimentation, prototype implant bearings that can be accurately and efficiently produced are needed. This work investigates various fabrication processes and possible materials to provide a foundation for developing surrogate biomechanical implants, especially those with integrated smart sensors. In this study, an original knee bearing is scanned and the resulting geometries used to generate prototypes. The prototypes are fabricated using a variety of methods including CNC machining and additive manufacturing. The prototypes are then tested to determine load distribution, active sensor performance, as well as kinematic performance under loading. The results of this study show that FDM printing provides quick and affordable results but is not ideal for rigorous experimentation. SLA printed prototypes are improved in final quality with an increase in fabrication time. Lastly, CNC machined processes are more labor intensive but can provide the best material characteristics.

After extracting the MC governing equations according to Hamilton's principle, the finite element method has been used to discretize the motion equations. The surface topography has been simulated for various roughness forms in the tapping and non-contact modes by considering the effects of the Van der Waals, capillary and contact forces. Also, the experimental results obtained from the glass surface topography have been simulated. The results illustrate that the time delay in higher natural frequencies in the tapping mode is shorter in comparison with the non-contact mode, especially, for the lower natural frequencies. The sensitivity analysis of the natural frequencies, topography depth and time delay have been simulated. Results indicate that the most effective parameter is the MC length.

{"title": "Ethanol-Induced Cervical Sympathetic Ganglion Block Applications for Promoting Canine Inferior Alveolar Nerve Regeneration Using an Artificial Nerve.", "abstract": "Polyglycolic acid collagen (PGA-C) tubes are bio-absorbable nerve tubes filled with collagen of multi-chamber structure, which consist of thin collagen films. Favorable clinical outcomes have been achieved when using these tubes for the treatment of damaged inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). A critical factor for the successful nerve regeneration using PGA-C tubes is blood supply to the surrounding tissue. Cervical sympathetic ganglion block (CSGB) creates a sympathetic blockade in the head and neck region thus increasing blood flow in the area. To ensure an adequate effect, the blockade must be administered with local anesthetics one to two times a day for several consecutive weeks; this poses a challenge when creating animal models for investigating this technique. To address this limitation, we developed an ethanol-induced CSGB in a canine model of long-term increase in blood flow in the orofacial region. We examined whether IAN regeneration via PGA-C tube implantation can be enhanced by this model. Fourteen Beagles were each implanted with a PGA-C tube across a 10-mm gap in the left IAN. The IAN is located within the mandibular canal surrounded by bone, therefore we chose piezoelectric surgery, consisting of ultrasonic waves, for bone processing, in order to minimize the risk of nerve and vessel injury. A good surgical outcome was obtained with this approach. A week after surgery, seven of these dogs were subjected to left CSGB by injection of ethanol. Ethanol-induced CSGB resulted in improved nerve regeneration, suggesting that the increased blood flow effectively promotes nerve regeneration in IAN defects. This canine model can contribute to further research on the long-term effects of CSGB.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2018-12-26", "authors": ["YoshikiShionoya", "KatsuhisaSunada", "GentarouTsujimoto", "KeijiShigeno", "TatsuoNakamura"], "doi": "10.3791/58039"}

A perspective of plastics degradation in soil with a focus on end-of-life options.", "abstract": "'Capable-of-being-shaped' synthetic compounds are prevailing today over horn, bone, leather, wood, stone, metal, glass, or ceramic in products that were previously left to natural materials. Plastic is, in fact, economical, simple, adaptable, and waterproof. Also, it is durable and resilient to natural degradation (although microbial species capable of degrading plastics do exist). In becoming a waste, plastic accumulation adversely affects ecosystems. The majority of plastic debris pollutes waters, accumulating in oceans. And, the behaviour and the quantity of plastic, which has become waste, are rather well documented in the water, in fact. This review collects existing information on plastics in the soil, paying particular attention to both their degradation and possible re-uses. The use of plastics in agriculture is also considered. The discussion is organised according to their resin type and the identification codes used in recycling programs. In addition, options for post-consumer plastics are considered.

Herein, a zwitterionic nanohydrogel-grafted\u00a0\u00a0PVDF (ZNG- g-PVDF) nanofibrous membrane was fabricated via a simple surface activation and amide reaction. By tailoring the parameters for electrospinning, PAA-g-PVDF nanofibrous membranes with interpenetrated nanofibers and microsphere structure were formed, and the membrane surface was endowed with high roughness on the micrometer scale. Combined with the strong hydration ability of the grafted zwitterionic nanohydrogels, the obtained ZNG- g-PVDF nanofibrous membrane exhibited a superhydrophilic property and nearly zero adhesion to crude oil under water. It thus showed an extremely high removal efficiency (\u223c98.7%) for gravity-driven separation of the crude oil-in-water emulsion. Both the water-permeating flux and oil content in the collected filtrate (lower than 13 ppm) showed little change during 10 cycles of the filtration experiment, indicating superior crude oil foulant repellency performance of the ZNG- g-PVDF nanofibrous membrane.

Exhaled breath analysis is a noninvasive and convenient diagnostic method to improve the cure rate of patients. In this study, a self-powered breath analyzer based on polyaniline/polyvinylidene fluoride (PANI/PVDF) piezo-gas-sensing arrays has been developed for potential detection of several internal diseases. The device works by converting exhaled breath energy into piezoelectric gas-sensing signals without any external power sources. The five sensing units in the device have different sensitivities to various gas markers with concentrations ranging from 0 to 600\u00a0ppm. The working principle can be attributed to the coupling of the in-pipe gas-flow-induced piezoelectric effect of PVDF and gas-sensing properties of PANI electrodes.

With the help of electrostatic attraction, uniform GelMA microdroplets measuring about 100 \u03bcm are rapidly printed. Due to the application of lower external forces to separate the droplets, cell damage during printing is negligible, which often happens in piezoelectric or thermal inkjet bioprinting. Different printing states and effects of printing parameters (voltages, gas pressure, nozzle size, etc.) on microdroplet diameter are also investigated. The fundamental properties of low-concentration GelMA microspheres are subsequently studied. The results show that the printed microspheres with 5% w/v GelMA can provide a suitable microenvironment for laden bone marrow stem cells.

Prostaglandin analogs are a mainstay glaucoma therapy. However, conventional eyedroppers deliver 30-50 \u00b5L drops that greatly exceed the physiologic 7-\u00b5L ocular tear film capacity. Eyedropper overdosing floods the eye with excess drug compounds and preservatives, resulting in ocular surface toxicity, periorbitopathy, and other well-characterized ocular side effects. Piezoelectric high-precision microdosing provides targeted delivery that can reduce exposure to both drug and preservatives compared to conventional eyedropper delivery, with the potential to deliver similar biologic effect.\nBoth eyes (N=60) of 30 healthy volunteers received single 8-\u00b5L microdoses of 0.005% latanoprost (0.4 \u00b5g; \u00b5Rx-latanoprost) on the morning of Days 1 and 2 using a high-precision, piezo-print horizontal delivery system. Diurnal IOP was measured before and 2 days after microdosing. Main efficacy outcomes were diurnal IOP change after \u00b5Rx-latanoprost microdosing and accurate microdosing success rates, and the primary safety outcome was adverse event (AE) incidence.\n\u00b5Rx-latanoprost reduced baseline IOP by 26% and 30% at 1 and 2 days postadministration, respectively.

{"title": "Gravitational field flow fractionation: Enhancing the resolution power by using an acoustic force field.", "abstract": "An acoustic field flow fractionation (FFF) device was developed to fractionate a micro-particle mixture on the basis of the particle diameter using an acoustic force field in a carrier liquid flow. In the acoustic FFF channel used in the device, ultrasound waves generated from piezoelectric transducers driven by a sinusoidal signal of 2.02\u202fMhz propagated into the carrier liquid flow and built up a quarter-wavelength ultrasound standing wave field across the channel height. It was experimentally demonstrated that the acoustic field with a pressure node plane at the bottom surface of the channel reduced the thickness of the particle diffusion layer in a stagnant liquid proportional to the applied voltage driving the piezoelectric transducer. In the size-dependent particle separation, the particle mixture flowing through the acoustic FFF channel experienced an acoustic radiation force in the gravitational direction. As a result, suppressing the diffusion of small particles, particles were transported along the bottom surface of the channel with the local velocity of the carrier liquid at the particle center. The developed acoustic FFF device successfully fractionated a fluorescent micro-particle mixture (1, 3, 5, and 10\u202f\u03bcm diameter), whereas the 3 and 5\u202f\u03bcm particles were not fractionated in the FFF device using only the gravitational force field due to the diffusion of 3\u202f\u03bcm particles.", "journal": "Analytica chimica acta", "date": "2018-12-21", "authors": ["Jae YounHwang", "SangyeonYoun", "In-HwanYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aca.2018.09.056"}
{"title": "Design of a Piezoelectric Multilayered Structure for Ultrasound Sensors Using the Equivalent Circuit Method.", "abstract": "This study investigates the electroacoustic behavior of a piezoelectric multilayered structure for ultrasonic sensors using the equivalent circuit method (ECM). We first derived the vertical deflection of the multilayered structure as a function of pressure and voltage using equilibrium equations of the structure. The deflection derived in this work is novel in that it includes the effect of piezoelectricity as well as the external pressure on the radiating surface. Subsequently, the circuit parameters were derived from the vertical deflection. The acoustic characteristics of the structure were then analyzed using the electro-acoustical model of an ultrasonic sensor for in-air application. Using the equivalent circuit, we analyzed the effects of various structural parameters on the acoustic properties of the structure such as resonance frequency, radiated sound pressure, and beam pattern. The validity of the ECM was verified initially by comparing the results with those from the finite element analysis (FEA) of the same structure. Furthermore, experimental testing of an actual ultrasonic sensor was carried out to verify the efficacy of the ECM. The ECM presented in this study can estimate the performance characteristics of a piezoelectric multilayered structure with high rapidity and efficiency.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-12-21", "authors": ["Muhammad ShakeelAfzal", "HayeongShim", "YongraeRoh"], "doi": "10.3390/s18124491\n10.1016/S0924-4247(02)00037-7\n10.1121/1.2785040\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.09.012\n10.7567/JJAP.57.07LG02\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.02.026\n10.1109/JSEN.2009.2021787\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.10.009\n10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2784\n10.1143/JJAP.49.07HD05\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/2/308\n10.1121/1.1912531\n10.1088/0960-1317/10/3/323\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.09.021\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.11.013\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.02.050\n10.1016/j.jsv.2007.05.024\n10.2514/1.19855\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/032001\n10.1007/s00542-002-0277-4\n10.1016/S0924-4247(03)00006-2\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/4/023\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.07.022\n10.1016/0022-460X(93)90342-9\n10.1115/1.2744043\n10.7567/JJAP.57.07LD07\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006725\n10.3390/s18040947\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.05.129\n10.1063/1.4915100\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1907"}

However, the thermal conductivity enhancement of polymer composites is usually at the price of the loss of lightweight, the deterioration of flexibility, and electrical insulation. Here we report advanced polymer nanocomposites containing orientated boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs), which simultaneously exhibit high thermal conductivity enhancement, excellent electrical insulation, and outstanding flexibility. These nanocomposite films can be easily constructed by electrospinning polymer/BNNSs nanocomposite fibers, vertically folding the electrospun nanocomposite fibers and the subsequent pressing. The nanocomposite films exhibit thickness-dependent in-plane thermal conductivity, which can reach 16.3 W/(m\u00b7K) in the 18 \u03bcm thick nanocomposite film with 33 wt % BNNSs. In addition, the nanocomposite films have superior electrically insulating properties compared with the pristine polymer, such as reduced dielectric loss, increased electrical resistivity, and enhanced breakdown strength.

For example, acceleration sensors can be used to detect abnormal floor vibrations, such as large vibrations due to jumping children or unusual vibrations in a house where an elderly person is living alone.

Second, a piezoelectric energy harvester using slab vibration is manufactured to generate electrical power over a threshold. Next, the correlation among harvested energy, floor vibration, and impact noise is studied to check whether harvested energy can be employed as a condition detection threshold.

{"title": "Modeling and Analysis of Upright Piezoelectric Energy Harvester under Aerodynamic Vortex-induced Vibration.", "abstract": "This paper presents an upright piezoelectric energy harvester (UPEH) with cylinder extension along its longitudinal direction. The UPEH can generate energy from low-speed wind by bending deformation produced by vortex-induced vibrations (VIVs). The UPEH has the advantages of less working space and ease of setting up an array over conventional vortex-induced vibration harvesters. The nonlinear distributed modeling method is established based on Euler\u207bBernoulli beam theory and aerodynamic vortex-induced force of the cylinder is obtained by the van der Pol wake oscillator theory. The fluid\u207bsolid\u207belectricity governing coupled equations are derived using Lagrange's equation and solved through Galerkin discretization. The effect of cylinder gravity on the dynamic characteristics of the UPEH is also considered using the energy method. The influences of substrate dimension, piezoelectric dimension, the mass of cylinder extension, and electrical load resistance on the output performance of harvester are studied using the theoretical model. Experiments were carried out and the results were in good agreement with the numerical results.

{"title": "Reflection and refraction of plane waves at the loosely bonded common interface of piezoelectric fibre-reinforced and fibre-reinforced composite media.", "abstract": "The rapid development of the modern age has increased the urge of using composite structures having applications in the realm of various engineering fields. Specifically, fibre-reinforced piezoelectric composites are in the forefront of the present era because of its light weight, great strength and hence improved performance over the piezoelectric materials alone. Therefore, the present paper delves with the problem of reflection and refraction of plane waves when it is incident at the interface of a Piezoelectric Fibre-reinforced Composite (PFRC) medium and Fibre-reinforced Composite (FRC) medium. It is assumed that the media are loosely bonded to each other and are under horizontal initial stresses. It is established that the boundary conditions are satisfied by the set of three coupled waves associated with the PFRC medium (namely quasi-longitudinal wave (qP), quasi-transverse wave (qSV), electrostatic wave (EA)) and two coupled waves associated with the FRC medium (namely quasi-longitudinal wave (qP), quasi-transverse wave (qSV)). The amplitude ratio of reflected and refracted waves are obtained with the aid of suitable boundary conditions at the common interface of the two media. The effect of anisotropy, initial stresses and loose bonding on the amplitude ratio are studied numerically and demonstrated by means of graphs. The effect of anisotropy is also studied on the slowness curves, plotted in slowness surface. Moreover, the relation for energy partition is also derived and it is established that the total normal energy flux balance at the interface is unity.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2018-12-19", "authors": ["AmritaDas", "AbhishekKumar Singh", "PrajnyaParimita Patel", "KshitishCh Mistri", "AmaresChattopadhyay"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2018.11.008"}

Due to the considerable potential of PZT diaphragm transducers in terms of excellent electromechanical coupling properties, low implementation cost and wide-band frequency response, this technique provides a new alternative approach for tool condition monitoring in grinding processes competing with the conventional and expensive indirect sensor monitoring methods. This paper aims at assessing the structural changes caused by wear in single-point dressers during their lifetime, in order to ensure the reliable monitoring of the tool condition during dressing operations. Experimental dressing tests were conducted on aluminum oxide grinding wheels, which are highly relevant for industrial grinding processes. From the results obtained, it was verified that the dresser tip diamond material and the position of the PZT diaphragm transducer mounted on the dressing tool holder have a significant effect on the sensitivity of damage detection. This paper contributes to the realization of an effective monitoring system of dressing operations capable to avoid catastrophic tool failures as the proposed sensing approach can identify different stages of the dressing tool lifetime based on representative damage indices.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-12-19", "authors": ["PedroJunior", "Doriana MD'Addona", "Paulo RAguiar"], "doi": "10.3390/s18124455\n10.3390/s18113866\n10.3390/s16060795\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2797003\n10.1109/TIM.2013.2281576\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2017.04.001\n10.1016/j.cirp.2011.05.003\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.117\n10.1016/j.cirp.2010.05.010\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60503-4\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60184-X\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60758-6\n10.1007/s00170-004-2038-2\n10.1007/s00170-003-1556-7\n10.1504/IJMMM.2009.023110\n10.1016/j.procir.2015.06.050\n10.1016/j.procir.2016.01.001\n10.1177/1045389X09352816\n10.1106/A1HU-23JD-M5AU-ENGW\n10.1080/09349847.2013.848311\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/035008\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.5028/jatm.v7i3.447\n10.3390/s18051591\n10.3390/s17020329\n10.3390/s141019897\n10.3390/s18051521\n10.3390/s18072199\n10.1109/JSEN.2010.2044037\n10.3390/s101211644\n10.3390/s18092766\n10.1088/0957-0233/26/4/045601\n10.1016/j.procir.2017.12.220\n10.1007/s00170-018-2390-2\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2725946\n10.3390/ecsa-4-04896\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.11.031\n10.1177/1045389X17689942\n10.3390/s16081266\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2735858\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2763245\n10.1109/TIM.2017.2731038\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.09.027\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1497\n10.3390/s140101208\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.05.035\n10.3390/s121013617\n10.1109/TIM.2009.2018693\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2352171\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)61463-2\n10.1016/j.nima.2016.06.097\n10.1016/j.diamond.2016.06.004"}

Resonance of a cantilever structure is utilized to extend the straight vibration of a single piezo actuator to the 2D circular vibration of a micropipette. The circular vibration in fluids can generate the whirling flow featured with low pressure in the core area and flow velocity gradient. The low pressure can immobilize the objects nearby and transport them together with the micropipette, and the flow velocity gradient is utilized to form a torque to rotate the immobilized object. Experiments of the microbeads are conducted to evaluate the claimed functions and quantify the key parameters that influence the rotation velocity. The cell spheroid is immobilized and rotated for 3D observation, and by assessing the viability of the cells containing in the spheroid, the proposed method is proved noninvasive to living cells.

{"title": "Miniaturized Robotic End-Effector with Piezoelectric Actuation and Fiber Optic Sensing for Minimally Invasive Cardiac Procedures.", "abstract": "Each year 35,000 cardiac ablation procedures are performed to treat atrial fibrillation through the use of catheter systems. The success rate of this treatment is highly dependent on the force which the catheter applies on the heart wall. If the magnitude of the applied force is much higher than a certain threshold the tissue perforates, whereas if the force is lower than this threshold the lesion size may be too large and is inconsistent. Furthermore, studies have shown large variability in the applied force from trained physicians during treatment, suggesting that physicians are unable to manually regulate the levels of the force at the site of treatment. Current catheter systems do not provide the physicians with active means for contact force control and are only at most aided by visual feedback of the forces measured in situ. This paper discusses a novel design of a robotic end-effector that integrates mechanisms of sensing and actively controlling of the applied forces into a miniaturized compact form. The required specifications for design and integration were derived from the current application under investigation. An off-the-shelf miniature piezoelectric motor was chosen for actuation, and a force sensing solution was developed to meet the specifications. Experimental characterization of the actuator and the force sensor within the integrated setup show compliance with the specifications and pave the way for future experimentation where closed-loop control of the system can be implemented according to the contact force control strategies for the application.", "journal": "IEEE sensors journal", "date": "2018-12-18", "authors": ["EdgarAranda-Michel", "JaehyunYi", "JacksonWirekoh", "NitishKumar", "Cameron NRiviere", "David SSchwartzman", "Yong-LaePark"], "doi": "10.1109/JSEN.2018.2828940"}

{"title": "Development of High-Frequency (>60 MHz) Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) Transducer by Using Asymmetric Electrodes for Improved Beam Profile.", "abstract": "In most commercial single-element intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) transducers, with 20 MHz to 40 MHz center frequencies, a conductive adhesive is used to bond a micro-sized cable for the signal line to the surface of the transducer aperture (<1 mm \u00d7 1 mm size) where ultrasound beam is generated. Therefore, the vibration of the piezoelectric layer is significantly disturbed by the adhesive with the signal line, thereby causing problems, such as reduced sensitivity, shortened penetration depth, and distorted beam profile. This phenomenon becomes more serious as the center frequency of the IVUS transducer is increased, and the aperture size becomes small. Therefore, we propose a novel IVUS acoustic stack employing asymmetric electrodes with conductive and non-conductive backing blocks. The purpose of this study is to verify the extent of performance degradation caused by the adhesive with the signal line, and to demonstrate how much performance degradation can be minimized by the proposed scheme. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulation was conducted, and the results show that -3 dB, -6 dB, and -10 dB penetration depths of the conventional transducer were shortened by 20%, 25%, and 19% respectively, while those of the proposed transducer were reduced only 3%, 4%, and 0% compared with their ideal transducers which have the same effective aperture size. Besides, the proposed transducer improved the -3 dB, -6 dB, and -10 dB penetration depths by 15%, 12%, and 10% respectively, compared with the conventional transducer. We also fabricated a 60 MHz IVUS transducer by using the proposed technique, and high-resolution IVUS B-mode (brightness mode) images were obtained. Thus, the proposed scheme can be one of the potential ways to provide more uniform beam profile resulting in improving the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in IVUS image.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-12-16", "authors": ["Jin HoSung", "Jong SeobJeong"], "doi": "10.3390/s18124414\n10.1109/TITB.2012.2189408\n10.1007/978-3-642-01932-6_12\n10.1016/S0301-5629(99)00096-4\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2085\n10.1136/heart.85.5.567\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2014.10.015\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006679\n10.1088/0031-9155/60/9/3441\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.10.011\n10.1088/0967-3334/17/4/003\n10.1136/hrt.77.5.397\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2008.0164\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563286\n10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1251138\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.670\n10.1038/srep28360\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.12.017\n10.1038/srep28360\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.02.037\n10.1155/2017/9327270\n10.1177/0161734612469511"}

The LUS signal's acoustic frequency content, dependence on sample type, and optical wavelength are observed in the far field. The experiments yield a reference dataset for the design of noncontact LUS imaging systems. Measurements show that the majority of LUS signal energy in biological tissues is within the 0.5 and 3\u00a0MHz frequency bands and the total acoustic energy generated increases with the optical absorption coefficient of water, which governs tissue optical absorption in the infrared range. The experimental results also link tissue surface roughness and acoustic attenuation with limited LUS signal bandwidth in biological tissue. Images constructed using 810-, 1064-, 1550-, and 2000-nm generation laser wavelengths and a contact piezoelectric receiver demonstrates the impact of the generation laser wavelength on image quality.

For ferroelectric materials, the postsynthesis alignment of the dipoles is generally achieved by electric poling procedures. However, there are numerous technically interesting non-ferroelectric piezo-active materials like zinc oxide (ZnO). These materials demand the alignment of their intrinsic dipoles during the fabrication process. Therefore, in situ-poling techniques have to be developed. This study utilizes genetically modified M13 phage templates for the generation of force fields, which directly control the ZnO dipole poling. By genetic modification of M13 phage template, the piezoelectric response of the ZnO/M13 phage hybrid nanowire is doubled compared to the hybrid nanowire based on unmodified M13 wild type (wt) phage templates. Thus, the formation of piezo-active domains consisting of oriented ZnO nanocrystals is directly induced by the genetic modification.

However, they face a problem that only metastable or unstable structures are noncentrosymmetric with piezoelectricity, thus leading to the difficulty in experimental observation. Motivated by the recent advances in the synthesis of 2D group III nitrides, in this paper, for the first time, we study the piezoelectric properties of the 2D group III nitrides (XN, X = Al, Ga, and In) with buckled hexagonal configurations by surface passivation, which are thermodynamically stable. Unlike the previously reported planar graphitic structure, we demonstrate that the hydrogenated 2D nitrides (H-XN-H, X = Al, Ga, and In) exhibit both the in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric effects in their monolayer and multilayer structures under an external strain in the basal plane. We further elucidate the underlying mechanism of the piezoelectricity by analyzing the correlations between the piezoelectric coefficients and their structural, electronic, and chemical properties. In addition, we show that H-F cofunctionalization not only enhances the stability, but also significantly improves the ionic polarization because of the charge redistribution, thus leading to large in-plane piezoelectric coefficients in F-XN-H.

The properties of PEMs often rely on the degree of hydration, and therefore the study of these films in a hydrated state is critical to allow links to be drawn between their characteristics and performance in a particular application. In this work, we detail the development of a novel soft contact cell for studying hydrated PEMs (poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride)) using FTIR microspectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy can interrogate the nature of the polymer film and the hydration water contained therein. In addition to reporting spectra obtained for hydrated films confined at the solid-solid interface, we also report traditional ATR FTIR spectra of the multilayer. The spectra (microspectroscopy and ATR FTIR) reveal that the PEM film build-up proceeds as expected based on the layer-by-layer assembly methodology, with increasing signals from the polymer FTIR peaks with increasing bilayer number.

The humidity-sensitive graphene oxide (GO) film was deposited on the pMUT array with a facile drop-casting method and characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR). With the humidity level ranging from 10% to 90% RH, the sensor exhibited a high sensitivity of 719 Hz/% RH and an extremely high relative sensitivity of 271.1 ppm/% RH. The humidity-sensing results also showed good short-term repeatability and long-term stability, fast response and recovery, and low hysteresis. Moreover, the temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of the present humidity sensor was investigated and it could be easily compensated owing to the pMUT array structure design.

{"title": "Advances in the Structural Health Monitoring of Bridges Using Piezoelectric Transducers.", "abstract": "With the rapid development of the world's transportation infrastructure, many long-span bridges were constructed in recent years, especially in China. However, these bridges are easily subjected to various damages due to dynamic loads (such as wind-, earthquake-, and vehicle-induced vibration) or environmental factors (such as corrosion). Therefore, structural health monitoring (SHM) is vital to guarantee the safety of bridges in their service lives. With its wide frequency response range, fast response, simple preparation process, ease of processing, low cost, and other advantages, the piezoelectric transducer is commonly employed for the SHM of bridges. This paper summarizes the application of piezoelectric materials for the SHM of bridges, including the monitoring of the concrete strength, bolt looseness, steel corrosion, and grouting density.

{"title": "Nonlinear bending deformation of soft electrets and prospects for engineering flexoelectricity and transverse (d", "abstract": "Soft materials that exhibit electromechanical coupling are an important element in the development of soft robotics, flexible and stretchable electronics, energy harvesters, sensor and actuators. Truly soft natural piezoelectrics essentially do not exist and typical dielectric elastomers, predicated on electrostriction and the Maxwell stress effect, exhibit only a one-way electromechanical coupling. Extensive research however has shown that soft electrets i.e. materials with embedded immobile charges and dipoles, can be artificially engineered to exhibit a rather large piezoelectric-like effect. Unfortunately, this piezoelectric effect-large as it may be-is primarily restricted to an electromechanical coupling in the longitudinal direction or what is referred colloquially as the d33 piezoelectric coefficient. In sharp contrast, the transverse piezoelectric property (the so-called d31 coefficient) is rather small. This distinction has profound implications since these soft electrets exhibit negligible electromechanical coupling under bending deformation. As a result, the typically engineered soft electrets are rendered substantively ill-suited for energy harvesting as well as actuation/sensing of flexure motion that plays a critical role in applications like soft robotics. In this work, we analyze nonlinear bending deformation of a soft electret structure and examine the precise conditions that may lead to a strong emergent piezoelectric response under bending. Furthermore, we show that non-uniformly distributed dipoles and charges in the soft electrets lead to an apparent electromechanical response that may be ambiguously and interchangeably interpreted as either transverse piezoelectricity or flexoelectricity. We suggest pragmatic routes to engineer a large transverse piezoelectric (d31) and flexoelectric coefficient in soft electrets. Finally, we show that in an appropriately designed soft electret, even a uniform external electric field can induce curvature in the structure thus enabling its application as a bending actuator.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2018-12-13", "authors": ["Amir HosseinRahmati", "ShengyouYang", "SiegfriedBauer", "PradeepSharma"], "doi": "10.1039/c8sm01664j"}

{"title": "Materials and Designs for Power Supply Systems in Skin-Interfaced Electronics.", "abstract": "Recent advances in materials chemistry and composite materials design establish the foundations for classes of electronics with physical form factors that bridge the gap between soft biological organisms and rigid microsystems technologies. Skin-interfaced platforms of this type have broad utility in continuous clinical-grade monitoring of physiological status, with the potential to significantly lower the cost and increase the efficacy of modern health care. Development of materials and device designs for power supply systems in this context is critically important, and it represents a rapidly expanding focus of research in the chemical sciences. Reformulating conventional technologies into biocompatible platforms and co-integrating them into skin-interfaced systems demand innovative approaches in materials chemistry and engineering. In terms of physical properties, the resulting devices must offer levels of flexibility, stretchability, thickness, and mass density that approach those of the epidermis itself, while maintaining operational characteristics and mechanical durability for practical use outside of a laboratory or hospital. While nearly all commercially available components for energy storage and harvesting are rigid and planar, recent research provides options in devices that are biocompatible not only at the level of the constituent materials but also in terms of the mechanics and geometrical forms, with resulting capabilities for establishing stable, nonirritating, intimate interfaces to the skin for extended periods of time. This Account highlights the range of materials choices and associated device architectures for skin-interfaced power supply systems. The Account begins with an overview of the main design strategies, ranging from one-, two-, and three-dimensional engineered composite structures to active materials that are intrinsically stretchable. The following sections describe a broad collection of devices based on these concepts, starting with batteries and supercapacitors for storage and then photovoltaic, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and thermoelectric devices for harvesting. Representative examples highlight recent advances, with a focus on the relationship between the materials and the performance during deformation. A final section discusses the challenges and opportunities in this area. Continued efforts in fundamental chemical research will be critically important to progress in this emerging field of technology. For example, understanding the mechanisms by which physical deformations affect the intrinsic materials properties and the system-level performance requires further study. The development of stretchable and biocompatible solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity is an example of a specific area of interest for energy storage devices.

In this paper, cation-exchange membranes were prepared with poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) blended with nano-SiO\u2082, nano-Al\u2082O\u2083 and nano-ZnO. Sulfonic acid groups were injected into the membrane prepared by styrene grafting and sulfonation. The methods used for characterizing the prepared membranes were Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical measurements. Membrane performance, such as the ion exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake (WU), transport number, membrane permselectivity, membrane resistance, functional groups, and morphology were also evaluated. The hydrophilia, IEC, and permselectivity of cation-exchange membranes depended on the nanoparticle content of the membrane matrix. High transport property values were obtained, which increased with increasing nano-SiO\u2082/Al\u2082O\u2083/ZnO weight fractions. Finally, the cation-exchange membranes prepared with 1.5% nano-SiO\u2082, 2.0% nano-Al\u2082O\u2083 or 2.0% nano-ZnO all exhibited excellent membrane properties, including membrane permselectivity (PVDF/2% ZnO-g-PSSA membranes, 94.9%), IEC (PVDF/2% Al\u2082O\u2083-g-PSSA membranes, 2.735 mmol\u00b7g", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-12-07", "authors": ["XueminZhang", "JianZhou", "XinZou", "ZhongyuWang", "YunchenChu", "SanfanWang"], "doi": "10.3390/ma11122465\n10.1016/j.memsci.2005.05.002\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.06.045\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.05.023\n10.1039/c0jm04142d\n10.1016/S0376-7388(99)00070-8\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.12.043\n10.2166/wst.2012.464\n10.1039/C8TA09160A\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.09.033\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.12.039\n10.12989/mwt.2016.7.5.417\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.04.004\n10.14478/ace.2015.1008\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014\n10.1016/S0011-9164(02)00469-1\n10.12989/mwt.2015.6.5.351\n10.1038/s41545-018-0009-7\n10.1515/ract-2014-2106\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.056\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.311-313.1818\n10.1039/C7MH01071K\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.08.004\n10.12989/mwt.2017.8.3.225\n10.1021/ie9014205\n10.1002/pi.2970\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.05.032\n10.1016/S0376-7388(01)00695-0\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.043\n10.1016/j.seppur.2012.02.006\n10.1016/j.ssi.2015.02.023\n10.1016/j.ssi.2016.06.006\n10.1016/j.seppur.2010.12.009\n10.12989/mwt.2017.8.3.259\n10.12989/mwt.2016.7.5.377\n10.3390/ma11081368\n10.3390/ma11112221\n10.12989/mwt.2015.6.3.205\n10.3390/ma3125293\n10.3390/ma11101883\n10.3390/ma11091785"}

In this olfactory display, the efficiency of atomization is important in order to avoid smell persistence problems often encountered in human olfactory interfaces. Thus, the SAW device is coated with amorphous Teflon film to change the substrate nature from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. It is also necessary to silanize the piezoelectric substrate surface prior to Teflon coating to enhance the adhesion of the film. A dip coating method was adopted to obtain uniform coating on the substrate. The high-speed solenoid valve was used as micro-dispenser to spout a liquid droplet to the SAW device surface since its accuracy and reproducibility were high. Then, the atomization became easier on the hydrophobic substrate. In this study, the amorphous Teflon coating for minimizing the remaining liquid on the substrate after atomization was studied.

The cantilever can be easily excited for a high and controllable amplitude by the PTE method as compared to the piezoelectric excitation. The 1st and 2nd order flexural vibration amplitudes of the coated cantilever are easily and efficiently excited by the PTE method, mainly due to the bimetallic effect and a high photothermal efficiency.

Although the analysis of the elastic moduli reveals some changes as a function of blend composition and processing time, the weighted relaxation spectra are shown to be more useful in detecting changes. The analysis demonstrates that when PVDF, i.e., the more viscous phase, is the matrix, the blend relaxes cooperatively and only a single relaxation peak is observed. By contrast, blends with highly concentrated morphologies do not fully relax, showing instead an upward increasing trend at longer times. This outcome is attributed to the broad distribution of highly concentrated droplets with a high probability of droplet\u207bdroplet contacts. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) reveals that crystalline segmental motions attributed to the \u03b1-relaxation of PVDF at around 100 \u00b0C are restricted by the highly concentrated morphology of the 50/50 PLA/PVDF blend processed for 10 min.

{"title": "Bowel Sounds Identification and Migrating Motor Complex Detection with Low-Cost Piezoelectric Acoustic Sensing Device.", "abstract": "Interpretation of bowel sounds (BS) provides a convenient and non-invasive technique to aid in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. However, the approach's potential is limited by variation between BS and their irregular occurrence. A short, manual auscultation is sufficient to aid in diagnosis of only a few conditions. A longer recording has the potential to unlock additional understanding of GI physiology and clinical utility. In this paper, a low-cost and straightforward piezoelectric acoustic sensing device was designed and used for long BS recordings. The migrating motor complex (MMC) cycle was detected using this device and the sound index as the biomarker for MMC phases. This cycle of recurring motility is typically measured using expensive and invasive equipment. We also used our recordings to develop an improved categorization system for BS. Five different types of BS were extracted: the single burst, multiple bursts, continuous random sound, harmonic sound, and their combination.

{"title": "Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Using Pressure Pulse Wave Signals.", "abstract": "Pulse transit time (PTT) has received considerable attention for noninvasive cuffless blood pressure measurement. However, this approach is inconvenient to deploy in wearable devices because two sensors are required for collecting two-channel physiological signals, such as electrocardiogram and pulse wave signals. In this study, we investigated the pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals collected from one piezoelectric-induced sensor located at a single site for cuffless blood pressure estimation. Twenty-one features were extracted from PPW that collected from the radial artery, and then a linear regression method was used to develop blood pressure estimation models by using the extracted PPW features. Sixty-five middle-aged and elderly participants were recruited to evaluate the performance of the constructed blood pressure estimation models, with oscillometric technique-based blood pressure as a reference. The experimental results indicated that the mean \u00b1 standard deviation errors for the estimated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were 0.70 \u00b1 7.78 mmHg and 0.83 \u00b1 5.45 mmHg, which achieved a decrease of 1.33 \u00b1 0.37 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 1.14 \u00b1 0.20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, compared with the conventional PTT-based method. The proposed model also demonstrated a high level of robustness in a maximum 60-day follow-up study.

Barium titanate (BaTiO\u2083) is one of the most representative perovskite-structured ferroelectrics intensively studied until now. The pretransitional behavior of BaTiO\u2083 single crystal grown using a solid-state crystal growth (SSCG) method was investigated for the first time and compared to previous results. There is no melting process in the SSCG method, thus the crystal grown using a SSCG method have inherent higher levels of impurity and defect concentrations, which is a good candidate for investigating the effect of crystal quality on the precursor phenomena. The acoustic, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties, as well as birefringence, of the SSCG-grown BaTiO\u2083 were examined over a wide temperature range. Especially, the acoustic phonon behavior was investigated in terms of Brillouin spectroscopy, which is a complementary technique to Raman spectroscopy. The obtained precursor anomalies of the SSCG-grown BaTiO\u2083 in the cubic phase were similar to those of other single crystals, in particular, of high-quality single crystal grown by top-seeded solution growth method. These results clearly indicate that the observed precursor phenomena are common and intrinsic effect irrespective of the crystal quality.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-12-06", "authors": ["Soo HanOh", "Jae-HyeonKo", "Ho-YongLee", "IwonaLazar", "KrystianRoleder"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules23123171\n10.1103/PhysRevB.4.155\n10.1016/0038-1098(68)90571-1\n10.1088/0022-3719/13/19/018\n10.1016/0038-1098(82)91018-3\n10.1143/JJAP.37.5385\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.037601\n10.1103/PhysRevB.71.064107\n10.1080/00150198508221381\n10.1103/PhysRev.177.848\n10.1080/00150199808009173\n10.1103/PhysRevB.26.5904\n10.1103/PhysRevB.77.012102\n10.1103/PhysRevB.38.597\n10.1063/1.2980444\n10.1103/PhysRevB.84.094123\n10.1080/00150190600695743\n10.1016/S0038-1098(99)00492-5\n10.1063/1.3025465\n10.1016/0038-1098(73)90035-5\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4555(199607)27:7<503::AID-JRS986>3.0.CO;2-I\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.247601\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.197401\n10.1080/00150190802438025\n10.1063/1.3384996\n10.1103/PhysRevB.87.014106\n10.1209/0295-5075/26/4/012\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.167402\n10.1016/0038-1098(83)90132-1\n10.1063/1.3464968\n10.1063/1.4823576\n10.1063/1.4905679\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.037601\n10.1103/PhysRevB.79.184111\n10.1016/j.jpcs.2018.02.025\n10.1103/PhysRevB.79.144104\n10.1107/S0021889876011436\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.087602\n10.4191/kcers.2016.53.2.171\n10.1080/00150199208015935\n10.1103/PhysRevB.80.012102\n10.1143/JPSJ.34.997\n10.1103/PhysRevB.6.639\n10.1098/rsta.1979.0106\n10.1143/JJAP.49.07HA01\n10.3390/ma8125452\n10.1007/s10853-005-5915-7\n10.1080/00018737300101379\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.197601\n10.1103/PhysRevB.82.104110\n10.1088/0953-8984/14/21/314\n10.1103/PhysRevB.13.4877\n10.1142/S2010135X1350032X\n10.1080/10584587.2017.1285183\n10.3807/KJOP.2013.24.5.279\n10.1080/15980316.2016.1178669"}

For designing such membranes, the chemistry and morphology of the interfacial domains in contact with the contaminated water need to be adjusted such that a stable water layer, adhering to the surface, prevents oil droplets from wetting the membrane. In this article, we present an approach that relies on the controlled functionalization of the surface of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes; we adjust the surface topography of the membranes and introduce chemical heterogeneity to them. We show that the morphology of the PVDF surface can be altered by adjusting the composition of the nonsolvent bath used for the phase inversion process. Also, we render the surface of the membranes hydrophilic by using an alkaline chemical bath solution.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Mimicry of Flexoelectricity.", "abstract": "The origin of \"giant\" flexoelectricity, orders of magnitude larger than theoretically predicted, yet frequently observed, is under intense scrutiny. There is mounting evidence correlating giant flexoelectriclike effects with parasitic piezoelectricity, but it is not clear how piezoelectricity (polarization generated by strain) manages to imitate flexoelectricity (polarization generated by strain gradient) in typical beam-bending experiments, since in a bent beam the net strain is zero. In addition piezoelectricity changes sign under space inversion but giant flexoelectricity is insensitive to space inversion, seemingly contradicting a piezoelectric origin. Here we show that, if a piezoelectric material has its piezoelectric coefficient asymmetrically distributed across the sample, it will generate a nonzero bending-induced polarization impossible to distinguish from true flexoelectricity even by inverting the sample. The effective flexoelectric coefficient caused by piezoelectricity is functionally identical to, and often larger than, intrinsic flexoelectricity: our calculations show that, for standard perovskite ferroelectrics, even a tiny gradient of piezoelectricity (1% variation of piezoelectric coefficient across 1\u00a0mm) is sufficient to yield a giant effective flexoelectric coefficient of 1\u2009\u2009\u03bcC/m, three orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic expectation value.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2018-12-01", "authors": ["AmirAbdollahi", "Fabi\u00e1nV\u00e1squez-Sancho", "GustauCatalan"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.205502"}

Rhenium tricarbonyl complexes bearing 2,2'-bipyridine (2,2'-bpy) ligands are well-established molecular electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO. Construction of efficient devices for this electrochemical process requires the immobilization of electrocatalysts to electrode surfaces. To integrate Re(2,2'-bpy)(CO)3 fragments into a covalent organic framework (COF), Re(5,5'-diamine-2,2'-bpy)(CO)3Cl (1) was synthesized and electrochemically investigated. Complex 1 is an active and selective electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO with excellent faradaic efficiency (99%). The presence of the amine substituents leads to a destabilization of the \u03c0* orbital of the 5,5'-diamine-2,2'-bpy ligand with respect to the metal center. Therefore, 1 requires more negative potentials (-2.47 V vs. Fc+/0) to reach the doubly reduced catalytically active species. DFT studies were conducted to understand the electronic structure of 1, and support the destabilizing effect of the amine substituents. The Re-2,2'-bpy fragments were successfully integrated into a COF containing 2,2'-bpy moieties (COF-2,2'-bpy) via a post-metallation synthetic route to generate COF-2,2'-bpy-Re. A composite of COF-2,2'-bpy-Re, carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was readily immobilized onto glassy carbon electrodes and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO was observed at -2.8 V vs. Fc0/+, with a faradaic efficiency of 81% for CO production.", "journal": "Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)", "date": "2018-12-01", "authors": ["Damir APopov", "John MLuna", "Nicholas MOrchanian", "RalfHaiges", "Courtney ADownes", "Smaranda CMarinescu"], "doi": "10.1039/c8dt00125a"}

Recently, considerable development of genosensors, which allows dynamic monitoring of hybridization events for HPV-16 and 18, has been a topic of focus by many researchers. In this systematic review, we highlight the route of development of DNA-based genosensory detection methods for diagnosis of high risk of HPV precancer. Biosensor detection methods of HPV-16 and 18 was investigated from 1994 to 2018 using several databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, SID, and Scientific Information Database. Manual search of references of retrieved articles were also performed. A total of 50 studies were reviewed. By analyzing the most recent developed electrochemical biosensors for the identification of HPV, we observed that the sensor platform fabricated by Wang et al. holds the lowest detection limit reported in the literature for the DNA of HPV-16. Up to this date, optical, electrochemical, and piezoelectric systems are the main transducers used in the development of biosensors. Among the most sensitive techniques available to study the biorecognition activity of the sensors, we highlight the biosensors based fluorescent, EIS, and QCM.

The L-shaped beam-mass structure and the piezoelectric bimorph cantilever beam structure was combined to form the wideband piezoelectric energy harvester configuration, which realized effective output at both resonance points. The theoretical model and finite element simulation analysis of the wideband piezoelectric energy harvester were proposed and the parameters were optimized based on that to meet the requirement of the vibration frequency of the engine.

Finally, the review summarizes the future prospects of AuNPs in non-optical biosensors.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-30", "authors": ["PengfeiJiang", "YulinWang", "LanZhao", "ChenyangJi", "DongchuChen", "LiboNie"], "doi": "10.3390/nano8120977\n10.1038/86762\n10.1002/1521-4095(200108)13:15<1197::AID-ADMA1197>3.0.CO;2-4\n10.1021/la001164w\n10.1021/acsomega.8b01072\n10.1039/b500430f\n10.1021/la980557g\n10.1103/RevModPhys.58.533\n10.1038/355761a0\n10.1007/BF03214964\n10.1021/ac9809940\n10.1016/j.aca.2014.01.042\n10.1021/ac050036f\n10.1021/nl903178n\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.3233\n10.1039/b001737j\n10.1016/j.ab.2007.12.035\n10.1039/b105318n\n10.1016/j.bios.2006.02.010\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.11.029\n10.1002/elps.201400597\n10.1021/ac500964s\n10.1021/ac061269p\n10.1007/s11434-007-0529-x\n10.1039/C5CC03568F\n10.3390/s111110785\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.12.007\n10.1021/acsami.5b10026\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.09.063\n10.1039/C4AN01532K\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.12.053\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.08.180\n10.1088/0957-4484/19/49/495502\n10.1039/C6AN01572G\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.10.096\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.09.131\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.03.153\n10.1016/j.talanta.2017.01.054\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.11.070\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.03.014\n10.1016/j.flm.2017.06.004\n10.1007/s00604-017-2135-1\n10.11648/j.jeee.20160402.12\n10.1039/C4AN00922C\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2004.10.059\n10.1002/elps.201000204\n10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00531-X\n10.2116/analsci.23.177\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.12.104\n10.1023/A:1017502630894\n10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00628-9\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.11.098\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.06.138\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/21/215501\n10.1016/j.cap.2010.02.048\n10.1021/ac401599t\n10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.056\n10.1016/j.ab.2018.04.020\n10.1021/ac026212r\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.06.054\n10.1016/j.bios.2007.04.015\n10.1021/la051917k\n10.1021/ac070357m\n10.1038/srep38896\n10.1186/s13036-015-0014-z\n10.1039/b603963d\n10.1021/ac0103221\n10.1016/j.aca.2003.12.067\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b03121\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.06.063\n10.1039/C5CC01439E\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b05150\n10.1021/ja952951w\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.12.048\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.10.038\n10.1016/j.bios.2017.09.038\n10.1016/j.jcis.2017.09.079\n10.1016/j.talanta.2017.08.090\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.11.012\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.02.060\n10.3390/s140915714\n10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.011\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.07.049\n10.1016/j.ab.2016.02.010\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.06.057\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.012\n10.1007/s00604-012-0822-5\n10.1021/ac303142e\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.02.043\n10.1021/ja711278c\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.09.081\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.056\n10.1021/ac0344079\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.07.001\n10.1021/ac8017197\n10.1016/j.bios.2017.11.012\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.11.086\n10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.056\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.07.004\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.10.026\n10.1016/j.talanta.2017.07.042\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.01.014\n10.1039/c3nr05625b\n10.1016/j.elecom.2013.09.018\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.08.092\n10.1007/s00604-017-2566-8\n10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.006\n10.1021/ac504652e\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b05447\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04930\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02342\n10.1039/b008669j\n10.1126/science.281.5383.1647\n10.1149/1.1574806\n10.1002/smll.201502350\n10.1021/acs.iecr.8b00894\n10.1021/acsami.7b17037\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02840\n10.1021/ac052143f\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.01.049\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.09.019\n10.1039/c1an15610a\n10.1021/ac3001435\n10.1016/j.bios.2010.07.038\n10.1016/S0003-2670(02)00670-0\n10.1021/ja0255709\n10.1039/b200555g\n10.1021/la011002f\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.07.057\n10.1021/ac103283p\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.02.134\n10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.018\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.08.037\n10.1021/ac50064a012\n10.1111/j.1751-908X.2004.tb00755.x\n10.1016/0009-2541(90)90145-W\n10.1016/j.chemgeo.2004.06.017\n10.1002/mas.20239\n10.1039/c2ja10319b\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.031\n10.1039/C5TB00223K\n10.1007/s00216-015-8507-7\n10.1016/j.talanta.2017.10.009\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.090\n10.1021/ac402446a\n10.1021/ac050539l\n10.1021/ac0103468\n10.1039/b202306g\n10.1016/j.chroma.2011.02.005\n10.1016/j.sab.2015.01.011\n10.1039/C4JA00026A\n10.1039/C5AN02402A\n10.1039/C5JA00364D\n10.1016/j.talanta.2017.08.007\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.02.072\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.07.073\n10.1016/j.aca.2015.05.011\n10.1021/pr100056w\n10.1016/j.aca.2005.09.021\n10.1016/j.talanta.2003.10.016\n10.1016/j.bpc.2006.05.020\n10.1039/b511705d\n10.3389/fpls.2016.00032\n10.1038/srep40493\n10.1021/acsnano.6b02105\n10.1073/pnas.1713390114\n10.7150/thno.19061\n10.1002/mabi.201600359\n10.1007/s11051-008-9561-2\n10.1021/ac403775a\n10.1002/ange.201006838\n10.1021/acsami.7b11385\n10.1166/nnl.2017.2561\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04927\n10.1166/jbn.2014.1987\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.06.031\n10.1166/jnn.2013.6894\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.07.204\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.07.135\n10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.035\n10.1166/nnl.2017.2416\n10.1021/acsami.5b12833\n10.1166/jnn.2016.12373\n10.1166/jbn.2017.2417\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.11.048"}
{"title": "Model Updating for Nam O Bridge Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm.", "abstract": "Vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) for long-span bridges has become a dominant research topic in recent years. The Nam O Railway Bridge is a large-scale steel truss bridge located on the unique main rail track from the north to the south of Vietnam. An extensive vibration measurement campaign and model updating are extremely necessary to build a reliable model for health condition assessment and operational safety management of the bridge. The experimental measurements are carried out under ambient vibrations using piezoelectric sensors, and a finite element (FE) model is created in MATLAB to represent the physical behavior of the structure. By model updating, the discrepancies between the experimental and the numerical results are minimized. For the success of the model updating, the efficiency of the optimization algorithm is essential. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) are employed to update the unknown model parameters. The result shows that PSO not only provides a better accuracy between the numerical model and measurements, but also reduces the computational cost compared to GA. This study focuses on the stiffness conditions of typical joints of truss structures. According to the results, the assumption of semi-rigid joints (using rotational springs) can most accurately represent the dynamic characteristics of the truss bridge considered.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-30", "authors": ["HTran-Ngoc", "SKhatir", "GDe Roeck", "TBui-Tien", "LNguyen-Ngoc", "MAbdel Wahab"], "doi": "10.3390/s18124131\n10.1007/s12205-017-1107-7\n10.3390/s17071657\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000765\n10.12989/sss.2010.6.4.373\n10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0702(2003)8:3(162)\n10.1007/s11859-008-0117-1\n10.3390/s18093057\n10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0702(2001)6:4(285)\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2010.04.019\n10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000060\n10.1016/j.jsv.2003.10.041\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2009.02.011\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.09.070\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.12.058\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2018.09.032\n10.1155/2016/4910862\n10.1007/s10704-017-0210-6\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.02.012\n10.3390/s18061879\n10.1080/15732479.2011.564635\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000092\n10.2749/101686616X14480232444405\n10.1016/S2095-7564(15)30273-7\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.499\n10.1016/S0263-8231(97)00028-1\n10.3311/pp.ci.2007-1.02\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.10.009\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.09.004\n10.1006/mssp.1999.1249\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2006)132:2(182)\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2005.01.009\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1990)116:10(2599)\n10.1016/j.proeng.2012.09.551\n10.1016/j.crme.2017.11.008\n10.1080/17415977.2017.1347168\n10.1111/mice.12100\n10.1016/j.sepro.2012.04.035\n10.1080/23248378.2016.1179599\n10.3390/en10070992\n10.5755/j01.mech.21.6.12526\n10.1016/j.cam.2004.07.034"}
{"title": "Prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing among women working in the aged care services in Japan.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in women working in the field of aged care in Japan.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted for female employees aged 18-60\u00a0years in aged care facilities in Japan. The analyzed set consisted of 712 participants with complete data. SDB was determined by respiratory disturbance index (RDI), measured using an ambulatory airflow monitor with a polyvinylidene fluoride film sensor to detect nasal and oral airflow overnight at home. Based on the findings of previous studies, RDI 10 was considered equivalent to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 15.\nThe prevalence of moderate-to-severe SDB (RDI\u2009\u2265\u200910) was 22.8%. The mean age was 38.1\u00a0years, and mean sleeping time of participants was 6.1\u00a0h. The median body mass index (BMI) was 22.0. Women with moderate-to-severe SDB (RDI\u2009\u2265\u200910) had a higher age, neck circumference, neck-height ratio, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and increased prevalence of hypertension, short sleepers (amount of sleep on the SDB testing day\u2009<\u20096\u00a0h), and habitual snorers, compared to women with no or mild SDB (RDI\u2009<\u200910).\nOur study found that women working in the aged care services in Japan were heavily burdened by SDB even though they were relatively young and slim. To prevent CVD from developing in the future, programs through which workplaces can help their employees improve their lifestyle, and early diagnosis and treatment of SDB are highly recommended.", "journal": "International archives of occupational and environmental health", "date": "2018-11-30", "authors": ["YukaSuzuki", "AiIkeda", "HirooWada", "KoutatsuMaruyama", "NarihisaMiyachi", "RonaldFilomeno", "YoheiSuzuki", "SatomiIkeda", "YumiHashimoto", "YasunariKoyama", "TakeshiTanigawa"], "doi": "10.1007/s00420-018-1381-9"}
{"title": "Relating Organic Fouling in Membrane Distillation to Intermolecular Adhesion Forces and Interfacial Surface Energies.", "abstract": "This study investigates the fouling mechanisms in membrane distillation, focusing on the impact of foulant type and membrane surface chemistry. Interaction forces between a surface-functionalized particle probe simulating a range of organic foulants and model surfaces, modified with different surface energy materials, were measured by atomic force microscopy. The measured interaction forces were compared to those calculated based on the experimentally determined surface energy components of the particle probe, model surface, and medium (i.e., water). Surfaces with low interfacial energy exhibited high attractive interaction forces with organic foulants, implying a higher fouling potential. In contrast, hydrophilic surfaces (i.e., surfaces with high interfacial energy) showed the lowest attractive forces with all types of foulants. We further performed fouling experiments with alginate, humic acid, and mineral oil in direct contact membrane distillation using polyvinylidene fluoride membranes modified with various materials to control membrane surface energy. The observed fouling behavior was compared to the interaction force data to better understand the underlying fouling mechanisms. A remarkable correlation was obtained between the evaluated interaction force data and the fouling behavior of the membranes with different surface energy. Membranes with low surface energy were fouled by hydrophobic, low surface tension foulants via \"attractive\" and subsequent \"adsorptive\" interaction mechanisms. Furthermore, such membranes have a higher fouling potential than membranes with high or ultralow surface energy.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2018-11-28", "authors": ["ChanheeBoo", "SeungkwanHong", "MenachemElimelech"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.8b05768"}
{"title": "Piezo's membrane footprint and its contribution to mechanosensitivity.", "abstract": "Piezo1 is an ion channel that gates open when mechanical force is applied to a cell membrane, thus allowing cells to detect and respond to mechanical stimulation. Molecular structures of Piezo1 reveal a large ion channel with an unusually curved shape. This study analyzes how such a curved ion channel interacts energetically with the cell membrane. Through membrane mechanical calculations, we show that Piezo1 deforms the membrane shape outside the perimeter of the channel into a curved 'membrane footprint'. This membrane footprint amplifies the sensitivity of Piezo1 to changes in membrane tension, rendering it exquisitely responsive. We assert that the shape of the Piezo channel is an elegant example of molecular form evolved to optimize a specific function, in this case tension sensitivity. Furthermore, the predicted influence of the membrane footprint on Piezo gating is consistent with the demonstrated importance of membrane-cytoskeletal attachments to Piezo gating.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2018-11-28", "authors": ["Christoph AHaselwandter", "RoderickMacKinnon"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.41968\n10.1039/C6SM01481J\n10.1103/PhysRevE.80.031901\n10.1039/C5SM01793A\n10.7554/eLife.07370\n10.1016/S0006-3495(04)74337-4\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/ncomms10366\n10.1209/epl/i2003-00438-4\n10.1103/PhysRevE.69.031903\n10.1140/epje/i2014-14042-1\n10.1007/978-0-8176-8259-0\n10.7554/eLife.33660\n10.1098/rsif.2014.0769\n10.1515/znc-1973-11-1209\n10.1103/PhysRevE.49.4728\n10.1142/p310\n10.1038/nchembio.1558\n10.7554/eLife.12088\n10.1209/0295-5075/117/58001\n10.1038/nature13250\n10.1103/PhysRevE.78.021908\n10.1038/nature00992\n10.1063/1.334447\n10.1038/nature08147\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76295-3\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.258101\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1103/PhysRevA.44.1182\n10.1080/00018739700101488\n10.1085/jgp.113.4.525\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.033\n10.1007/s00424-014-1530-2\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.118103\n10.1103/PhysRevE.57.6988\n10.1529/biophysj.104.047431\n10.1038/ncomms12939\n10.1103/PhysRevE.78.051903\n10.1038/nature25743"}
{"title": "Hand-Driven Gyroscopic Hybrid Nanogenerator for Recharging Portable Devices.", "abstract": "With the rise of portable and wearable electronics, a fast-charging, long-lasting power solution is needed; thus, there are attempts to harvest energy from the ambient environment. Mechanical energy harvesting through piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators (PENG and TENG) is a promising approach due to their light weight, low cost, and high-power density in comparison to other technologies. Both types of generators are capable of charging portable and smart devices on their own by converting mechanical energy into electricity. However, most previous methods have excessive input conditions, such as high rpm and input frequency, that can be only applied with other actuators. Here, a hand-held gyroscopic generator is presented that uses the gyroscopic principle to reach a rotation rate above 8000 rpm with only hand input. The generator comprises a rotating flywheel inside a casing. Both the flywheel and casing have a TENG, and with a hybrid generator, electrical power is produced from rotation, vibration, and centrifugal force during operation. The device shows a consistent open-circuit voltage (", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2018-11-28", "authors": ["JihoonChung", "HyungseokYong", "HaksungMoon", "Quang VanDuong", "Seung TaeChoi", "DongseobKim", "SangminLee"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.201801054"}

This paper presents an analytical approach based on the orthogonal function technique to investigate non-propagating Lamb-like waves in a functionally graded piezoelectric spherical curved plate. The presented approach can transform the set of partial differential equations for the acoustic waves into an eigenvalue problem that can give the generally complex wave numbers and the field profiles. A comparison of the obtained results with the well-known ones in plates is provided. The obtained solutions of the dispersion equation are shown graphically in three dimensional frequency-complex wave number space, which aids in understanding the properties of non-propagating waves better. The properties of the guided wave, including real, purely imaginary, and complex branches in various functionally graded piezoelectric spherical curved plates, are studied. The effects of material piezoelectricity, graded fields, and mechanical and electrical boundary conditions on the dispersion characteristics, are illustrated. The amplitude distributions of displacement and electric potential are also discussed, to analyze the specificities of non-propagating waves.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-28", "authors": ["XiaomingZhang", "ShunliLiang", "XiaomingHan", "ZhiLi"], "doi": "10.3390/ma11122363\n10.1109/58.143172\n10.1121/1.417193\n10.1121/1.2214153\n10.1177/1081286511412281\n10.1016/j.jsv.2011.04.005\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/1/313\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.33-37.707\n10.1016/j.euromechsol.2006.01.007\n10.1007/s00707-012-0612-5\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.05.099\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/6/014\n10.1007/s00707-008-0123-6\n10.1177/1045389X17708047\n10.3813/AAA.918839\n10.1121/1.1907510\n10.1121/1.1391248\n10.1016/j.jsv.2015.10.017\n10.1007/s00419-015-1047-y\n10.1002/zamm.200900294\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.12.006\n10.1121/1.5040140\n10.1016/j.apm.2018.06.053\n10.3390/ma11071186\n10.1063/1.4953847\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.06.068\n10.1115/1.3640661"}

Such nonlinear vibrations have been studied by some researchers; however, the related increase in temperature has not been taken into consideration, because it is a complicated phenomenon. In this study, the mechanism underlying the interaction between nonlinear vibration and temperature increase in a piezoelectric transducer under high-power conditions was clarified. For this purpose, cubic terms of the mechanical strain, the nonlinear transfer matrix method, and the heat conduction equation were combined. Additionally, it is necessary to utilize the distributed parameter model because the temperature increase is not uniform. The calculation results obtained using the measured temperature dependence of material constants verified that the temperature increase significantly degrades the piezoelectric vibration.

The electrospun composite membranes had a three dimension bead-fiber interconnected open structure and a rough membrane surface.

In contrast with the pure PVDF nanofibrous membrane, the stress at break and the elastic modulus of the composite membranes increased by 4.5-16 times and 17.5-37 times, respectively.

{"title": "Time-Dependent Dynamic Behaviors of a Confined Liquid To Achieve Tailored Adhesion Force with Repeated Contacts Revealed by Atomic Force Microscopy.", "abstract": "The adhesion forces between two silica surfaces were measured by using an atomic force microscope with different experimental parameters in air to investigate the dynamic behavior of a confined liquid. Results show that the adhesion force is time-dependent and increases at first sharply and then slightly with dwell time until saturation is reached, with a long equilibrium time. This behavior is well explained by a dynamic meniscus model, in which a liquid bridge grows gradually because of liquid film flow with a large viscosity. Also, the large viscosity was attributed to the formation of orthosilicic acid and subsequent polymerization. With repeated contacts, the liquid bridge changes into two droplets on both surfaces after separation. The liquid in both forms can be controlled to flow into or out of the contact zone by the experimental parameters to achieve tailored adhesion forces. If the liquid of previous contact remains in the contact zone, the adhesion force increases with repeated contacts and then reaches saturation, which can also be explained by the model qualitatively. However, if the liquid droplets vanish before the next contact, the adhesion force usually decreases or remains unchanged. More liquid will be collected with larger contact times. Meanwhile, the droplets remaining on the surfaces get smaller until they vanish without a contact. Moreover, both piezo velocity and scan distance can be used to control the proportion of contact time. In addition, a viscous force should be considered with a large retraction velocity. The changing trend and magnitude of adhesion force depend on the experimental parameters and their coupling effects. The results may facilitate the anti-adhesion design of small-scale silicon-based systems.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2018-11-27", "authors": ["TianmaoLai", "YonggangMeng"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b03164"}

The compact interferometer is constructed by using two separate cores of the MCF, where the fiber end is cleaved in order to generate strong Fresnel reflection, and independent light coupling between the cores of MCF and the single mode fibers (SMFs) is enabled by the fan-in coupler. Vibration gives rise to differential strain variation between cores which results in the modification of phase difference of the interferometer. A narrow linewidth laser is employed, in order to interrogate the phase change induced reflection power variation. Vibration event can be identified and the vibration frequency can be retrieved by processing the measured reflection power with fast Fourier transform (FFT). Broad vibration frequency response range up to 12 kHz (limited by the cut-off frequency of the voltage driver of the vibration source) has been achieved. Performance of the sensor has been shown to be independent of the selection of different core pairs, where the MCF is wound to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT).

Herein, we fabricated a novel composite membrane for excellent anti-oil-fouling performance in MD process by electrospinning polyetherimide (PEI) nanofibers on the hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane surface, followed by cross-linking with ethanediamine (EDA).

{"title": "Experimental Comparison of the Performance of Cutting Bone and Soft Tissue between Piezosurgery and Conventional Rotary Instruments.", "abstract": "Piezosurgery is an innovative technique widely used for osteotomies in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. The surgical technique has been clinically supposed to cut mineralized bone selectively with reducing the risk of damage to adjacent soft tissues. However, none of the previous literature has reported any evidence of scientific experiments to examine performance of the piezoelectric device, i.e. the time required for cutting bone and the effect on soft tissues under the standardized conditions. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that cutting time of the piezoelectric device is longer than that of rotary instruments while the cut surface of bone is smoother and soft tissues are less damaged with piezosurgery under the standardized experimental system. We measured the time for cutting bone and soft tissues of rats with the piezoelectric device and rotary instruments.

{"title": "Gelation of Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride) Solutions in Native and Organically Modified Silica Nanopores.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to highlight the surface and size effects of the nanopores on the thermodynamics and kinetics of gelation. The effects have been probed by applying differential scanning calorimetry to poly(vinylidene fluoride) solutions in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (tetraglyme) and \u03b3-butyrolactone. Nanoconfinement has been accomplished by introducing gels into native and organically modified silica nanopores (4\u207b30 nm). Nanoconfinement has produced two major effects. First, the heat of gelation has decreased three to four times compared to that for the bulk systems. Second, the temperature of gelation has increased by ~40 \u00b0C (tetraglyme based systems) and ~70 \u00b0C (\u03b3-butyrolactone based systems), the increase being stronger in native nanopores. The effects are discussed in terms of acceleration of gelation due to heterogeneous nucleation at the confining surface, and retardation of gelation due to constricted polymer chain mobility in the middle of the pore volume. Calorimetric data have been subjected to isoconversional kinetics analysis. The obtained temperature dependencies of the activation energies of gelation have been interpreted in the frameworks of the nucleation model of Turnbull and Fisher. The results suggest that nanoconfinement leads to a lowering of both the free energy of nucleation and activation energy of diffusion.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-23", "authors": ["AlejandraEspinosa-Dzib", "SergeyVyazovkin"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules23113025\n10.1039/C5CS00199D\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.11.009\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2008.01.002\n10.1016/S0169-409X(01)00245-9\n10.1039/C6CP03339C\n10.1039/C7CS00399D\n10.1146/annurev-biophys-083012-130345\n10.1021/la7032516\n10.1002/adfm.200601191\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2009.10.004\n10.1021/jp068202q\n10.1063/1.5003906\n10.1021/ma00156a012\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b01716\n10.1021/la902070q\n10.1021/la801734x\n10.1039/c2sm25073j\n10.1039/C4CP05715E\n10.1039/b813525h\n10.1002/macp.200800430\n10.1021/jp0759168\n10.1002/mabi.200800214\n10.1002/macp.200800518\n10.1016/j.polymer.2009.06.070\n10.1002/marc.201100748\n10.1039/c2sm25737h\n10.1002/macp.201400029\n10.1016/0032-3861(93)90224-X\n10.1021/la9709150\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1295/polymj.35.798\n10.1007/s00396-015-3542-7\n10.1021/ja00717a050\n10.1016/0032-3861(94)90896-6\n10.1021/je980288w\n10.1021/je990119r\n10.1016/j.jct.2010.09.008\n10.1002/pol.1978.180161009\n10.1063/1.1747055\n10.1016/0032-3861(92)90056-3\n10.1021/jp403910f\n10.1002/macp.201400354\n10.1002/1096-987X(20010130)22:2<178::AID-JCC5>3.0.CO;2-#\n10.1002/marc.201600615\n10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b03860\n10.1002/pol.1979.180171006\n10.1002/pol.1979.180170311\n10.1209/0295-5075/6/8/011\n10.1021/jp993108d\n10.1016/0032-3861(91)90514-J"}

On-line cutting force measurement is key for machining condition monitoring and machined surface quality assurance. This paper presents a novel instrumented working table with integrated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thin-film sensors, thus enabling the dynamic milling force measurement with compact structures. To achieve this, PVDF thin-film sensors are integrated into the working table to sense forces in different directions and the dedicated cutting force decoupling model is derived. A prototype instrumented working table is developed and validated. The validation demonstrates that profiles of the forces measured from the developed instrumented working table prototype and the dynamometer match well.

We evaluated the safety and feasibility of craniotomies using an ultrasonic device that allows the selective cut of mineralized structures, avoiding damages to the vascular, dural, and parenchymal structures.\nWe analyzed a series of 300 patients (age range, 1-81 years; SD \u00b1 15.2) who underwent elective cranial surgery for brain tumors, in which the craniotomy was performed using a piezoelectric device. Pre- and postoperative imaging, clinical notes, and intraoperative details were collected.\nThere were 197 patients (66%) who underwent surgery for supratentorial tumors; the remaining 103 patients (34%) underwent surgery for infratentorial ones. Tumors involved the skull base in 125 cases. Meningiomas, gliomas, and schwannomas represented the most common histotypes. Duraplasty for dural damages was not necessary in all cases; no venous sinuses or parenchymal injuries were reported during bone work. We noted in 13 cases (4.3%) a minor dural tear, requiring only direct sutures. Bone flaps were always intact after craniotomy. No subgaleal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection or CSF leak was recorded. Because of the minimal bone gap, we always achieved correct bone flap ossification. No reabsorption or mobilization of bone flap was noted.\nWe illustrate the feasibility and safety of a piezosurgical cutter to perform craniotomies.

{"title": "Preparation of Highly Porous Polymer Membranes with Hierarchical Porous Structures via Spinodal Decomposition of Mixed Solvents with UCST Phase Behavior.", "abstract": "The predominant method to prepare polymer membranes is based on phase inversion. However, this method always leads to a dense skin with low porosity when normal polymers are used. Using the self-assembly of certain block copolymers, it is possible to prepare uniform pores with high porosity, but the prices of these polymers are too high to be afforded in practical applications. Here, we report a novel strategy to prepare highly porous and asymmetric polymer membranes using the widely used poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as a prototype. The method combines spinodal decomposition with phase inversion utilizing mixed solvents that have the unique upper critical solution temperature phase behavior. The spinodal decomposition generates a thin surface layer containing a high density of relatively uniform pores in the mesoporous range, and the phase inversion generates a thick bulk layer composed of macrovoids; the two types of structures are interconnected, yielding a highly permeable, selective, and mechanically strong porous membrane. The membranes show an order of magnitude higher water permeance than commercial membranes and efficient molecular sieving of macromolecules. Notably, our strategy provides a general toolbox to prepare highly porous membranes from normal polymers. By blending PVDF with cellulose acetate (CA), a highly porous PVDF/CA membrane was prepared and showed similarly high separation performance, but the higher hydrophilicity of CA improved the membrane flux in the presence of proteins.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2018-11-21", "authors": ["Roshni LThankamony", "XiangLi", "XiaolinFan", "GuanSheng", "XinboWang", "ShuyuSun", "XixiangZhang", "ZhipingLai"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.8b16120"}

{"title": "Prestress Monitoring of a Steel Strand in an Anchorage Connection Using Piezoceramic Transducers and Time Reversal Method.", "abstract": "Steel strands are widely used in cable stay or suspension bridges. The safety and stability of steel strands are important issues during their operation period. Steel strand is subjected to various types of prestress loss which loosens the wedge anchorage system, negatively impacting the stability of the structure and even leading to severe accidents. In this paper, the authors propose a time reversal (TR) method to monitor the looseness status of the wedge anchorage system by using stress wave based active sensing. As a commonly used piezoceramic material, Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) with a strong piezoelectric effect is employed. In the proposed active sensing approach, PZT patches are used as sensors and actuators to monitor the steel strand looseness status. One PZT patch is bonded to the steel strand, one PZT patch is bonded to the wedges, and another PZT patch is bonded to the barrel. There are three different interfaces of the wedge anchorage system to monitor the steel strand looseness status. In the first method, the PZT patch on the steel strand is used as an actuator to generate a stress wave and the PZT patch on the wedge is used as a sensor to detect the propagated waves through the wedge anchorage system. In the second method, the PZT patch on the steel strand is used as an actuator to generate a stress wave and the PZT patch on the barrel is used as a sensor to detect the propagated waves through the wedge anchorage system. In the third method, the PZT patch on the wedges is used as an actuator to generate a stress wave and the PZT patches on the barrel is used as a sensor to detect the propagated waves through the wedge anchorage system, of which the looseness will directly impact the stress wave propagation. The TR method is utilized to analyze the transmitted signal between PZT patches through the wedge anchorage system. Compared with the peak values of the TR focused signals, it can be found that the peak value increases as the wedge anchorage system tightness increases. Therefore, the peak value of the TR focused signal can be used to monitor the tightness of the steel strand. In addition, the experimental results demonstrated the time reversal method's reliability, sensitivity and anti-noise property.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-21", "authors": ["XiaoyuZhang", "LiuyuZhang", "LaijunLiu", "LinshengHuo"], "doi": "10.3390/s18114018\n10.1016/j.strusafe.2005.11.002\n10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000909\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2005.05.013\n10.1680/macr.2007.59.2.131\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.01.021\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.11.003\n10.1617/s11527-006-9112-1\n10.13722/j.cnki.jrme.2014.1690\n10.3788/CJL201744.0410001\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.05.015\n10.1016/j.ultras.2008.07.009\n10.1155/2013/249829\n10.1177/1475921703036169\n10.3390/app7080789\n10.3390/app6110341\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.074\n10.1080/15732479.2013.831908\n10.3390/s141019897\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.4.997\n10.1177/147592170200100104\n10.3390/s17071641\n10.3390/ma3125169\n10.1080/19475411.2013.836577\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/2/010\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/003\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.3390/s18093100\n10.3390/s18082489\n10.3390/s18072171\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/105014\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/026\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80c9\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6768\n10.3390/s18051377\n10.1109/58.156174\n10.1088/0266-5611/17/1/201\n10.1016/j.ultras.2009.05.002\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/3/037002\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085015\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055018\n10.1515/eng-2015-0046\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.019\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.1016/j.cscm.2016.03.003\n10.1155/2015/695845\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.01.039\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/087001\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.1.135\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.03.007\n10.1007/s12206-011-1012-9\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2011.12.004\n10.1121/1.3598458\n10.1177/1475921710395815\n10.1063/1.3690043\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/3/035010\n10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00110-X\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2002)15:3(97)\n10.1177/1045389X07077853\n10.1006/jsvi.1998.1612\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/060\n10.1177/1077546310393440\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2008.09.005\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/1/004\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2004.00120.x\n10.1177/1045389X12461080\n10.1117/12.845784\n10.3390/s17102239\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2660301\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/115020\n10.3390/s16122083\n10.3390/s17092001"}

In particular, capacitive accelerometers are the most popular and highly researched due to several advantages like high sensitivity, low noise, low temperature sensitivity, linearity, and small footprint. Accelerometers can be designed to sense acceleration in all the three directions (X, Y, and Z-axis). Single-axis accelerometers are the most common and are often integrated orthogonally and combined as multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDoF) packages for sensing acceleration in the three directions. This type of MDoF increases the overall device footprint and cost. It also causes calibration errors and may require expensive compensations. Another type of MDoF accelerometers is based on monolithic integration and is proving to be effective in solving the footprint and calibration problems. There are mainly two classes of such monolithic MDoF accelerometers, depending on the number of proof masses used. The first class uses multiple proof masses with the main advantage being zero calibration issues. The second class uses a single proof mass, which results in compact device with a reduced noise floor. The latter class, however, suffers from high cross-axis sensitivity. It also requires very innovative layout designs, owing to the complicated mechanical structures and electrical contact placement. The performance complications due to nonlinearity, post fabrication process, and readout electronics affects both classes of accelerometers. In order to effectively compare them, we have used metrics such as sensitivity per unit area and noise-area product. This paper is devoted to an in-depth review of monolithic multi-axis capacitive MEMS accelerometers, including a detailed analysis of recent advancements aimed at solving their problems such as size, noise floor, cross-axis sensitivity, and process aware modeling.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2018-11-21", "authors": ["ZakriyaMohammed", "Ibrahim Abe MElfadel", "MahmoudRasras"], "doi": "10.3390/mi9110602\n10.1109/JSEN.2006.881433\n10.3390/s101210733\n10.3390/mi7010014\n10.1109/4.753678\n10.1109/5.704269\n10.1109/JMEMS.2002.805207\n10.1016/S0924-4247(98)00032-6\n10.1088/0960-1317/8/4/004\n10.1109/84.967374\n10.1016/S0924-4247(97)80006-4\n10.1007/s00542-013-1741-z\n10.1109/LSENS.2017.2756108\n10.1016/0924-4247(90)85062-9\n10.1016/0924-4247(96)01154-5\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.06.033\n10.1016/S0924-4247(98)00295-7\n10.1109/84.896778\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.02.032\n10.1109/JMEMS.2004.839347\n10.1109/JMEMS.2004.832653\n10.1109/84.896777\n10.1109/JMEMS.2015.2451079\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.007\n10.1088/0960-1317/6/4/010\n10.1088/0960-1317/11/1/308\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2017.10.011\n10.1109/TED.2010.2048791\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/5/055019\n10.1109/JMEMS.2012.2205904"}

{"title": "Improved biocompatibility of profiled sutures through lower macrophages adhesion.", "abstract": "The biocompatibility of a textile implant is determined by various parameters, such as material composition and surface chemistry. However, little is known about the influence of geometry of sutures on biocompatibility. To elucidate this factor we focused on geometry-modification resulting in ultrafine polyethylene terephthalate (UFPET) suture and a snowflake like shaped polyvenylidenfluorid (PVDF) suture. Forty-eight rats were divided into two observation periods. In each rat 3 out of 4 sutures (profiled UFPET, snowflake-like profiled PVDF, reference Prolene and Mersilene suture) were randomly placed into the subcutaneous tissue. Rats were euthanized after 7 and 21 days and samples were explanted. Foreign body granuloma was measured and expression of CD68, TUNEL, Ki-67 and Collagen I/III ratio were determined. The profiled (snowflake) suture showed a significantly smaller FBG in comparison to standard sutures (p < 0.001). Both modified sutures showed a significant lower tissue remodeling by Ki-67 and TUNEL expression (p < 0.03). Furthermore, profiled sutures caused a lower inflammatory reaction expressed in a significant lower amount of CD68 positive macrophages after 21 days (p < 0.001). Modifications of suture geometry alter the foreign body granuloma and the inflammatory reaction. Therefore, profiled sutures might be a promising approach to improve biocompatibility of textile mesh prosthesis. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The activity of piezoelectric material dimension and electrical properties can be changed with an applied stress. These variations are translated to a change in the capacitance of the structure. This work takes a close outlook on the use of the capacitance-voltage measurements for the extraction of double piezoelectric thin film material deposited at the two faces of a flexible steel sheet. The piezoelectric thin film materials have been deposited using RF sputtering techniques. Gamry analyzer references 3000 was used to collect the capacitance-voltage measurements from both layers. The developed algorithm extracts directly the piezoelectric coefficients knowing the film thickness, the applied voltage, and the capacitance ratio. The capacitance ratio is the ratio between the capacitances of the film when the applied field in antiparallel and parallel to the polling field direction, respectively.

Here, the MIL-PVDF multifunctional ultrafiltration membrane with ultrahigh MIL loading was demonstrated by a new blending method of predispersion in acetone and thermally induced phase separation. Due to the improved dispersity and restriction of pore size, the MIL-53(Fe) mass loading was as high as approximately 61%. The new membrane showed high performance for methylene blue (MB) removal and maintained high permeability and ultrafiltration efficiency. The characteristics of the membranes were analyzed to explain the above advantages. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional blend ultrafiltration membrane, the 67-MIL-PVDF membrane showed an 9-fold increase in effective treatment volume for more than 75% MB removal. The contribution and efficiency of adsorption and catalytic oxidation were analyzed and explained. The relationship between them was confirmed as being independent, and the reasons for this independence were proposed. Additionally, the mechanism of multifunctional decontamination and permeability by MIL-PVDF membranes was proposed.

While we have not recorded such change-driven components earlier than M100 using electrical stimulation, clear M50 responses were reported using both ON and OFF mechanical stimulation (Onishi et al. in Clin Neurophysiol 121:588-593, 2010). To examine the significance of M50 and M100 in reflecting the detection of somatosensory changes, we recorded these waveforms in 12 healthy subjects (9 males and 3 females) by magnetoencephalography in response to mechanical stimulation from a piezoelectric actuator. Onset and offset (ON and OFF) stimuli were randomly presented with three preceding steady state (PSS) durations (0.5, 1.5 and 3\u00a0s) in one consecutive session. Results revealed that (i) onset and offset somatosensory events elicited clear M50 and M100 components; (ii) M50 and M100 components had distinct origins, with M50 localised to the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (cS1) and M100 to the bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (iS2, cS2); and (iii) the amplitude of M50 in cS1 was independent of the PSS durations, whereas that of M100 in S2 was dependent on the PSS durations for both ON and OFF events. These findings suggest that the M50 amplitude in cS1 reflects the number of activated mechanoreceptors during Onset and Offset, whereas the M100 amplitude in S2 reflects change detection based on sensory memory for Onset and Offset stimuli at least in part. We demonstrated that the M50 in cS1 and M100 in S2 plays different roles in the change detection system in somatosensory modality.", "journal": "Brain topography", "date": "2018-11-18", "authors": ["KoyaYamashiro", "DaisukeSato", "HideakiOnishi", "KazuhiroSugawara", "NaofumiOtsuru", "HikariKirimoto", "ShoNakazawa", "YudaiYamazaki", "HiroshiShirozu", "AtsuoMaruyama"], "doi": "10.1007/s10548-018-0687-y"}

{"title": "On-Chip Tunable Cell Rotation Using Acoustically Oscillating Asymmetrical Microstructures.", "abstract": "The precise rotational manipulation of cells and other micrometer-sized biological samples is critical to many applications in biology, medicine, and agriculture. We describe an acoustic-based, on-chip manipulation method that can achieve tunable cell rotation. In an acoustic field formed by the vibration of a piezoelectric transducer, acoustic streaming was generated using a specially designed, oscillating asymmetrical sidewall shape. We also studied the nature of acoustic streaming generation by numerical simulations, and our simulation results matched well with the experimental results. Trapping and rotation of diatom cells and swine oocytes were coupled using oscillating asymmetrical microstructures with different vibration modes. Finally, we investigated the relationship between the driving voltage and the speed of cell rotation, showing that the rotational rate achieved could be as large as approximately 1800 rpm. Using our device, the rotation rate can be effectively tuned on demand for single-cell studies.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Tooth Aligner for Accelerated Orthodontic Tooth Movement.", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a device that can induce vibration to potentially accelerate the rate of orthodontic tooth movement and thus reduce the duration of the orthodontic treatment. This is accomplished by harmonically exciting a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric actuators to generate vibration and hence generate cyclic loading at 30 Hz. PVDF is a popular piezoelectric polymer because of its high flexibility, biocompatibility, and low cost. Generally, application of cyclic loading (vibration) reverses bone loss, stimulates bone mass, induces cranial growth, and accelerates tooth movement. This reduce the pain experience and discomfort associated with the orthodontic treatment and also enhances the patient compliance with the treatment. Vibration has the advantage of minimal side effects in comparison to medicinal treatments. The device is attached to either a positioner or teeth aligner. The main advantage of this work is that the device can be adjusted and repositioned in a different location of the teeth aligner. We propose one device that incorporates vibration, harmonic function generation, and the housing unit for the battery and processor. Current approaches require an external device, which is relatively cumbersome to the patient. Theoretical analysis based on the distributed parameter model is utilized to justify our claim.

{"title": "Simultaneous Measurement of Swallowing Sound and Mechanomyogram of Submental Muscle with PVDF Film.", "abstract": "The difficulty of swallowing, called dysphagia, causes aspiration pneumonia which is particularly a big health concern in aging society. Therefore, prevention and treatment of dysphagia would contribute to extending healthy-life and QOL of elderly people and decreasing healthcare cost. Conventional reliable methods for evaluating swallowing function require special equipment and are not suitable for long-term monitoring at home or welfare facilities. Therefore, various kinds of quantitative assessment method using biological signals such as swallowing sound, electromyography, and so forth have been proposed as a non-invasive and accessible method. The goal of this study is to realize comprehensive quantitative assessment of swallowing function using multiple biological signals simultaneously measured by a single sensor device. In this study, we propose the use of PolyVinylidene DiFluoride (PVDF) film to measure both mechanomyogram (MMG) signal for evaluating muscle activity and swallowing sound for detecting swallowing sequence. In our previous study, we confirmed PVDF film can detect MMG signal of swallowing-related muscles. We conducted experiments to confirm that PVDF film can detect swallowing sound in this study. The experimental results indicated that swallowing sound can be measured in parallel with MMG signal at the same position by changing frequency band of the signal of PVDF film.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

We used a cutting-edge nanotechnology, electrospinning/netting, to generate a Steiner geometrical poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofiber/nanonet filter for removing airborne particulate matter (PM). Manipulation of surface morphologies by precise control of charged situation enabled the creation of two-dimensional nanonets with Steiner geometry. A significant crystalline phase transition of PVDF from \u03b1-phase to \u03b2-phase was triggered by the dipole orientation and the intermolecular interactions derived from the electrostatic potential analysis. Particularly, the synergy of electrical interaction (ion-dipole and dipole-dipole) and hydrophobic interaction facilitated the formation of Steiner geometric structure during the evolution process of nanonets.

The performance of MD systems is hampered by inorganic scaling, particularly when treating hypersaline industrial wastewaters with high-scaling potential. In this study, we developed a scaling-resistant MD membrane with an engineered \"slippery\" surface for desalination of high-salinity industrial wastewaters at high water recovery. A polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was grafted with silica nanoparticles, followed by coating with fluoroalkylsilane to lower the membrane surface energy. Contact angle measurements revealed the \"slippery\" nature of the modified PVDF membrane. We evaluated the desalination performance of the surface-engineered PVDF membrane in direct contact membrane distillation using a synthetic wastewater with high gypsum scaling potential as well as a brine from a power plant blowdown. Results show that gypsum scaling is substantially delayed on the developed slippery surface. Compared to the pristine PVDF membrane, the modified PVDF membranes exhibited a stable MD performance with reduced scaling potential, demonstrating its potential to achieve high water recovery in treatment of high-salinity industrial wastewaters.

{"title": "Passive guided waves measurements using fiber Bragg gratings sensors.", "abstract": "Guided elastic waves are often studied as an effective solution for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems of plate-like structures thanks to the capacity to propagate on large distances. In typical applications such as monitoring delaminations in aircraft fuselage, a network made of piezoelectric transducer (PZT) is used to emit and receive such waves in the structure. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors on optical fibers are a promising alternative to PZT for guided waves measurements in practical applications due to the capacity for dense multiplexing and robustness with respect to the environment. However, unlike conventional PZT transducers, FBG sensors cannot emit waves. It is demonstrated here that FBG sensors can be used in combination with a passive diffuse noise cross-correlation technique in order to extract the coherent guided waves propagating between two sensors. This could lead to a system using only FBG sensors in the near future. The reconstructed signals can then be analyzed with usual guided waves algorithms, like in active SHM systems, keeping all the advantages of this kind of monitoring in terms of fine diagnosis.

{"title": "Mechanical Fatigue Resistance of Piezoelectric PVDF Polymers.", "abstract": "The fatigue resistance of piezoelectric PVDF has been under question in recent years. While some report that a significant degradation occurs after 10\u2076 cycles of repeated voltage input, others report that the reported degradation originates from the degraded metal electrodes instead of the piezoelectric PVDF itself. Here, we report the piezoelectric response and remnant polarization of PVDF during 10\u2077 cycles of repeated compression and tension, with silver paste-based electrodes to eliminate any electrode effect. After applying repeated tension and compression of 1.8% for 10\u2077 times, we do not observe any notable decrease in the output voltage generated by PVDF layers.

The dimensions of the mechanism were optimized using the grey wolves optimization (GWO) algorithm, aiming to maximize the natural frequencies. Using the optimal parameters, the established models for the mechanical performance evaluation of the flexure stage were verified with the finite-element method.

{"title": "Interrogation Techniques and Interface Circuits for Coil-Coupled Passive Sensors.", "abstract": "Coil-coupled passive sensors can be interrogated without contact, exploiting the magnetic coupling between two coils forming a telemetric proximity link. A primary coil connected to the interface circuit forms the readout unit, while a passive sensor connected to a secondary coil forms the sensor unit. This work is focused on the interrogation of sensor units based on resonance, denoted as resonant sensor units, in which the readout signals are the resonant frequency and, possibly, the quality factor. Specifically, capacitive and electromechanical piezoelectric resonator sensor units are considered. Two interrogation techniques, namely a frequency-domain technique and a time-domain technique, have been analyzed, that are theoretically independent of the coupling between the coils which, in turn, ensure that the sensor readings are not affected by the interrogation distance. However, it is shown that the unavoidable parasitic capacitance in parallel to the readout coil introduces, for both techniques, an undesired dependence of the readings on the interrogation distance. This effect is especially marked for capacitance sensor units. A compensation circuit is innovatively proposed to counteract the effects of the parasitic input capacitance, and advantageously obtain distance-independent readings in real operating conditions. Experimental tests on a coil-coupled capacitance sensor with resonance at 5.45 MHz have shown a deviation within 1.5 kHz, i.e., 300 ppm, for interrogation distances of up to 18 mm. For the same distance range, with a coil-coupled quartz crystal resonator with a mechanical resonant frequency of 4.432 MHz, variations of less than 1.8 Hz, i.e., 0.5 ppm, have been obtained.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2018-11-15", "authors": ["MarcoDemori", "MarcoBa\u00f9", "MarcoFerrari", "VittorioFerrari"], "doi": "10.3390/mi9090449\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/8/085023\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.07.004\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2611677\n10.1109/TIM.2008.928405\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.12.018\n10.1016/j.proeng.2012.09.154\n10.3390/s17092100\n10.1109/TIM.2008.925019\n10.1109/TIM.2016.2647478\n10.1109/84.825772\n10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2456242\n10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2755596\n10.1109/TIM.2011.2122110\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2602298\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2614816\n10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2333747\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.03.009\n10.1109/TIM.2009.2032966\n10.3390/s17061264\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.04.029\n10.1016/j.aeue.2018.05.019\n10.1109/84.982864\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.03.041"}

{"title": "Micro Motion Amplifiers for Compact Out-of-Plane Actuation.", "abstract": "Small-scale, out-of-plane actuators can enable tactile interfaces; however, achieving sufficient actuator force and displacement can require larger actuators. In this work, 2-mm\u00b2 out-of-plane microactuators were created, and were demonstrated to output up to 6.3 \u00b5m of displacement and 16 mN of blocking force at 170 V. The actuators converted in-plane force and displacement from a piezoelectric extensional actuator into out-of-plane force and displacement using robust, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-enabled, half-scissor amplifiers. The microscissors employed two layers of lithographically patterned SU-8 epoxy microstructures, laminated with a thin film of structural polyimide and adhesive to form compact flexural hinges that enabled the actuators' small area. The self-aligned manufacture minimized assembly error and fabrication complexity. The scissor design dominated the actuators' performance, and the effects of varying scissor angle, flexure thickness, and adhesive type were characterized to optimize the actuators' output. Reducing the microscissor angle yielded the highest actuator performance, as it maximized the amplification of the half-scissor's displacement and minimized scissor deformation under externally applied loads. The actuators' simultaneously large displacements and blocking forces for their size were quantified by a high displacement-blocking force product per unit area of up to 50 mN\u00b7\u00b5m/mm\u00b2.

{"title": "Artificial Cochlear Sensory Epithelium with Functions of Outer Hair Cells Mimicked Using Feedback Electrical Stimuli.", "abstract": "We report a novel vibration control technique of an artificial auditory cochlear epithelium that mimics the function of outer hair cells in the organ of Corti. The proposed piezoelectric and trapezoidal membrane not only has the acoustic/electric conversion and frequency selectivity of the previous device developed mainly by one of the authors and colleagues, but also has a function to control local vibration according to sound stimuli. Vibration control is achieved by applying local electrical stimuli to patterned electrodes on an epithelium made using micro-electro-mechanical system technology. By choosing appropriate phase differences between sound and electrical stimuli, it is shown that it is possible to both amplify and dampen membrane vibration, realizing better control of the response of the artificial cochlea. To be more specific, amplification and damping are achieved when the phase difference between the membrane vibration by sound stimuli and electrical stimuli is zero and \u03c0 , respectively. We also demonstrate that the developed control system responds automatically to a change in sound frequency. The proposed technique can be applied to mimic the nonlinear response of the outer hair cells in a cochlea, and to realize a high-quality human auditory system.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2018-11-15", "authors": ["TetsuroTsuji", "AsukaNakayama", "HirokiYamazaki", "SatoyukiKawano"], "doi": "10.3390/mi9060273\n10.1073/pnas.1110036108\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.12.021\n10.1126/science.8456285\n10.1017/S0022215100084607\n10.1177/108471380400800102\n10.1299/jbse.5.229\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/11/115014\n10.1299/jbse.8.198\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/9/095018\n10.3389/fneng.2013.00012\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.08.017\n10.5614/j.eng.technol.sci.2013.45.1.5\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.493.372\n10.1002/adfm.201402270\n10.1038/srep12447\n10.1002/adhm.201700674\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa7236\n10.1073/pnas.1317233111\n10.1038/srep32955\n10.1016/S0924-4247(02)00310-2\n10.1063/1.4948592\n10.1016/j.heares.2015.08.007\n10.1098/rspb.1948.0024\n10.1098/rspb.1948.0025\n10.1007/BF00455222\n10.1121/1.1912485\n10.1073/pnas.94.6.2660\n10.1152/physrev.2001.81.3.1305\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.158101\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.06.049\n10.1088/0034-4885/77/7/076601\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/7/075019\n10.1073/pnas.1120067109\n10.1113/jphysiol.2013.258046\n10.1038/nbt.2394\n10.1137/S0036139999358404\n10.1073/pnas.0710037105"}

Although creep effect can be eliminated by the closed-loop control approach, hysteresis effects need to be compensated and alleviated by hysteresis compensators.

{"title": "Acceleration Sensitivity in Bulk-Extensional Mode, Silicon-Based MEMS Oscillators.", "abstract": "Acceleration sensitivity in silicon bulk-extensional mode oscillators is studied in this work, and a correlation between the resonator alignment to different crystalline planes of silicon and the observed acceleration sensitivity is established. It is shown that the oscillator sensitivity to the applied vibration is significantly lower when the silicon-based lateral-extensional mode resonator is aligned to the <110> plane compared to when the same resonator is aligned to <100>. A finite element model is developed that is capable of predicting the resonance frequency variation when a distributed load (i.e., acceleration) is applied to the resonator. Using this model, the orientation-dependent nature of acceleration sensitivity is confirmed, and the effect of material nonlinearity on the acceleration sensitivity is also verified. A thin-film piezoelectric-on-substrate platform is chosen for the implementation of resonators.

{"title": "Microfluidic Line-Free Mass Sensor Based on an Antibody-Modified Mechanical Resonator.", "abstract": "This research proposes a mass sensor based on mechanical resonance that is free from power supply lines (line-free) and incorporates both microfluidic mechanisms and label-free techniques to improve its sensitivity and reusability. The microfluidic line-free mass sensor comprises a disk-shaped mechanical resonator, a separate piezoelectric element used to excite vibrations in the resonator, and a microfluidic mechanism. Electrical power is used to actuate the piezoelectric element, leaving the resonator free from power lines. The microfluidic mechanism allows for rapid, repeat washings to remove impurities from a sample. The microfluidic line-free mass sensor is designed as a label-free sensor to enable high-throughput by modifying and dissociating an antibody on the resonator. The resonator was fabricated by photolithography and the diameter and thickness were 4 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The line-free mass sensor enabled a high Q-factor and resonance frequency of 7748 MHz and 1.402 MHz, respectively, to be achieved even in liquids, facilitating the analysis of human salivary cortisol. The line-free mass sensor could be used for repeated measurements with the microfluidic mechanism, and the resonator could be fully washed out.

{"title": "Experimental Research on Fluid Coupling Flexible Actuator.", "abstract": "In the field of micromechanics, piezoelectric actuator has attracted great attention for its high-frequency response, high displacement resolution, and high output force. However, its prospect of practical application has been largely limited by the displacement of micrometer. A fluid coupling flexible actuator was proposed, which utilizes resonance to enlarge the output displacement. The actuator uses a piezoelectric oscillator as an excitation source, fluid as the transmission medium and a flexible diaphragm for the displacement output. On the condition that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible, mathematical formulation of the membrane vibration theory has been analyzed. Then, the prototype is made. The displacement is amplified 21 times to 1.106 mm when driving frequency is 127 Hz. The flexible diaphragm appears the largest displacement output when driving frequency is close to one of the system's natural frequency. Then, the points with zero amplitude form a circle on the surface of flexible diaphragm and the movement direction of the flexible diaphragm is opposite on different sides of the circle. In fact, rather than vibrates at the first resonance frequency, the membrane in the essay is vibrating at a certain higher-order resonance frequency. The experimental results are mainly consistent with the theoretical analysis.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2018-11-15", "authors": ["XiangliZeng", "YueWu", "QianjinTu", "JingshiDong", "ZhigangYang", "XinboLi"], "doi": "10.3390/mi9030103\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/9/095003\n10.3390/mi6081066\n10.1063/1.4918621\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.10.026\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.05.005\n10.1109/JMEMS.2002.807471\n10.1002/pi.2744\n10.1109/TMECH.2009.2021651\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.07.002"}

Our previous study has explored the effects of the external resistance on the electromechanical characteristics of the transducer, and obtained some valuable findings. To clearly understand the electromechanical characteristics of the transducer and to guide the device design, in this paper, parametric analysis was performed to reveal the effects of multiple key factors on the electromechanical characteristics. These factors include material parameters of epoxy layers, piezoceramic material types, and locations of piezoceramic rings. In order to better analyze the influence of these factors, a modified theoretical model, in which every layer has different geometric and material parameters, was developed based on the model given in the previous work.

{"title": "Frequency Dependence of Receiving Sensitivity of Ultrasonic Transducers and Acoustic Emission Sensors.", "abstract": "Receiving displacement sensitivities (Rx) of ultrasonic transducers and acoustic emission (AE) sensors are evaluated using sinewave packet excitation method and compared to the corresponding data from pulse excitation method with a particular emphasis on low frequency behavior below 20 kHz, down to 10 Hz. Both methods rely on the determination of transmitter displacement characteristics using a laser interferometric method. Results obtained by two calibration methods are in good agreement, with average spectral differences below 1 dB, indicating that the two calibration methods yield identical receiving sensitivities. At low test frequencies, effects of attenuation increase substantially due to increasing sensor impedance and Rx requires correction in order to evaluate the inherent sensitivity of a sensor, or open-circuit sensitivity. This can differ by more than 20 dB from results that used common preamplifiers with ~10 k\u03a9 input impedance, leading to apparent velocity response below 100 kHz for typical AE sensors. Damped broadband sensors and ultrasonic transducers exhibit inherent velocity response (Type 1) below their main resonance frequency. In sensors with under-damped resonance, a steep sensitivity decrease occurs showing frequency dependence of f\u00b2~f\u2075 (Type 2), while mass-loaded sensors exhibit flat displacement response (Type 0). Such behaviors originate from sensor characteristics that can best be described by the damped harmonic oscillator model. This model accounts for the three typical behaviors. At low frequencies, typically below 1 kHz, receiving sensitivity exhibits another Type 0 behavior of frequency independent Rx. Seven of 12 sensors showed this flat region, while three more appear to approach the Type 0 region. This appears to originate from the quasi-static piezoelectric response of a sensing element. In using impulse method, a minimum pulse duration is necessary to obtain spectral fidelity at low frequencies and an approximate rule is given. Various factors for sensitivity improvement are also discussed.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-15", "authors": ["KanjiOno"], "doi": "10.3390/s18113861\n10.3390/ma9070508\n10.1080/09349847.2017.1375585\n10.1121/1.387763\n10.3390/app8091595\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2015.08.018\n10.1002/2014JB011165\n10.1007/s10921-012-0131-2\n10.1007/s10921-018-0462-8\n10.7567/JJAP.55.022701\n10.1177/1045389X9200300109\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2677304\n10.1121/1.395027\n10.1121/1.1908709\n10.3390/app7100964\n10.3390/ma10111325\n10.1106/A1HU-23JD-M5AU-ENGW\n10.1590/S1678-58782009000400005"}

When targeting the integration of AFMs into vacuum environments (e.g., for enhancing the performance of scanning electron microscopes), a tuneable Q-factor of the resonating AFM cantilever is a key feature to enable high speed measurements with high local resolution. To achieve this goal, in this study an additional mechanical stimulus is applied to the cantilever with respect to the stimulus provided by the macroscopic piezoelectric actuator. This additional stimulus is generated by an aluminum nitride piezoelectric thin film actuator integrated on the cantilever, which is driven by a phase shifted excitation. The Q-factor is determined electrically by the piezoelectric layer in a Wheatstone bridge configuration and optically verified in parallel with a laser Doppler vibrometer. Depending on the measurement technique, the Q-factor is reduced by a factor of about 1.9 (electrically) and 1.6 (optically), thus enabling the damping of MEMS structures with a straight-forward and cheap electronic approach.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-15", "authors": ["MartinFischeneder", "MartinOposich", "MichaelSchneider", "UlrichSchmid"], "doi": "10.3390/s18113842\n10.1021/cr0681041\n10.1021/la403551c\n10.1088/0957-0233/20/9/092001\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.04.048\n10.1109/JMEMS.2017.2778307\n10.1016/j.mee.2015.03.037\n10.1016/j.mee.2014.02.011\n10.1088/0034-4885/74/3/036101\n10.1016/j.mseb.2010.05.026\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/2/025003\n10.1088/0022-3727/31/20/001\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.02.029\n10.1007/s00542-013-1997-3\n10.1063/1.4864310\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2614660\n10.1109/JMEMS.2011.2168809\n10.1016/j.ultramic.2006.06.006\n10.1109/TCST.2014.2303486\n10.1109/TCST.2018.2850338\n10.1063/1.4990451\n10.3390/proceedings1040380\n10.1016/j.mssp.2017.08.010\n10.1007/s00542-013-2003-9\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.10.016\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2707063\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.11.003"}

{"title": "Photoacoustic Energy Sensor for Nanosecond Optical Pulse Measurement.", "abstract": "We demonstrate a photoacoustic sensor capable of measuring high-energy nanosecond optical pulses in terms of temporal width and energy fluence per pulse. This was achieved by using a hybrid combination of a carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane (CNT-PDMS)-based photoacoustic transmitter (i.e., light-to-sound converter) and a piezoelectric receiver (i.e., sound detector). In this photoacoustic energy sensor (PES), input pulsed optical energy is heavily absorbed by the CNT-PDMS composite film and then efficiently converted into an ultrasonic output. The output ultrasonic pulse is then measured and analyzed to retrieve the input optical characteristics. We quantitatively compared the PES performance with that of a commercial thermal energy meter. Due to the efficient energy transduction and sensing mechanism of the hybrid structure, the minimum-measurable pulsed optical energy was significantly lowered, ~157 nJ/cm\u00b2, corresponding to 1/760 of the reference pyroelectric detector. Moreover, despite the limited acoustic frequency bandwidth of the piezoelectric receiver, laser pulse widths over a range of 6\u207b130 ns could be measured with a linear relationship to the ultrasound pulse width of 22\u207b153 ns.

We have modified a venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannula by embedding piezoelectric crystals into each of its 3 blood flow ports.

The aim of this study was to compare identification of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannula ports by B-mode imaging versus the color Doppler marker.

{"title": "ScAlN Thick-Film Ultrasonic Transducer in 40-80 MHz.", "abstract": "A medical ultrasound diagnostic system and an ultrasonic microscope are generally used in the frequency range of 1-20 MHz and 100 MHz-2 GHz, respectively. Ultrasonic transducers in the frequency range of 20-100 MHz are, therefore, not well developed because of less application into ultrasonic imaging or suitable piezoelectric materials with this frequency range. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) is usually used for ultrasonic transducers in the 10-50-MHz ranges. However, their electromechanical coupling coefficient of 4% is not enough for the practical uses. In order to excite the ultrasonic wave in the 20-100 MHz range, a 125-25- -thick piezoelectric film is required when the longitudinal velocity of the material is assumed to be 5000 m/s. However, it is difficult to grow such a thick piezoelectric film without a crack being caused by the internal stress during the dry deposition technique. We achieved a stress-free film growth by employing the unique hot target sputtering technique without heating the substrate. High-efficient 81- ( .5%) and 43-MHz ( %) ultrasonic generation by using the 43- and 90- extremely thick ScAlN (Sc: 39%) films were demonstrated, respectively. We discussed the advantage of ScAlN thick-film transducers by comparing them with the conventional PVDF transducer for the water medium.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2018-11-13", "authors": ["Ko-HeiSano", "ReiKarasawa", "TakahikoYanagitani"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2865791"}
{"title": "Effect of SiO\u2082 Nanoparticles on the Performance of PVdF-HFP/Ionic Liquid Separator for Lithium-Ion Batteries.", "abstract": "Safety concerns related to the use of potentially explosive, liquid organic electrolytes in commercial high-power lithium-ion batteries are constantly rising. One promising alternative is to use thermally stable ionic liquids (ILs) as conductive media, which are however, limited by low ionic conductivity at room temperature. This can be improved by adding fillers, such as silica or alumina nanoparticles (NPs), in the polymer matrix that hosts the IL. To maximize the effect of such NPs, they have to be uniformly dispersed in the matrix while keeping their size as small as possible. In this work, starting from a water dispersion of silica NPs, we present a novel method to incorporate silica NPs at the nanoscale level (<200 nm) into PVdF-HFP polymer clusters, which are then blended with the IL solution and hot-pressed to form separators suitable for battery applications. The effect of different amounts of silica in the polymer matrix on the ionic conductivity and cyclability of the separator is investigated. A membrane containing 10 wt.% of silica (with respect to the polymer) was shown to maximize the performance of the separator, with a room temperature ionic conductivity of of 1.22 mS cm - 1 .

Also, the strain required to resolve the spectra in the two operating types of PL and lasing were systematically analyzed and compared.

{"title": "The Balancing Act in Ferroelectric Transistors: How Hard Can It Be?", "abstract": "For some years now, the ever continuing dimensional scaling has no longer been considered to be sufficient for the realization of advanced CMOS devices. Alternative approaches, such as employing new materials and introducing new device architectures, appear to be the way to go forward. A currently hot approach is to employ ferroelectric materials for obtaining a positive feedback in the gate control of a switch. This work elaborates on two device architectures based on this approach: the negative-capacitance and the piezoelectric field-effect transistor, i.e., the NC-FET (negative-capacitance field-effect transistor), respectively \u03c0 -FET. It briefly describes their operation principle and compares those based on earlier reports. For optimal performance, the adopted ferroelectric material in the NC-FET should have a relatively wide polarization-field loop (i.e., \"hard\" ferroelectric material). Its optimal remnant polarization depends on the NC-FET architecture, although there is some consensus in having a low value for that (e.g., HZO (Hafnium-Zirconate)). \u03c0 -FET is the piezoelectric coefficient, hence its polarization-field loop should be as high as possible (e.g., PZT (lead-zirconate-titanate)). In summary, literature reports indicate that the NC-FET shows better performance in terms of subthreshold swing and on-current. However, since its operation principle is based on a relatively large change in polarization the maximum speed, unlike in a \u03c0 -FET, forms a big issue. Therefore, for future low-power CMOS, a hybrid solution is proposed comprising both device architectures on a chip where hard ferroelectric materials with a high piezocoefficient are used.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2018-11-09", "authors": ["Raymond J EHueting"], "doi": "10.3390/mi9110582\n10.1016/j.mee.2012.01.009\n10.1109/16.372076\n10.1109/55.285389\n10.1109/5.371964\n10.1109/JPROC.2010.2070470\n10.1038/nature10679\n10.1109/TED.2017.2755507\n10.1021/nl071804g\n10.1109/TED.2013.2274817\n10.1088/0034-4885/61/9/002\n10.1063/1.2336999\n10.1063/1.3669527\n10.1080/00018735400101173\n10.1038/nmat4195\n10.1109/LED.2013.2291560\n10.1109/JXCDC.2015.2448414\n10.1109/LED.2015.2501319\n10.1063/1.4943786\n10.1002/pssc.201300280\n10.1063/1.3494533\n10.1109/LED.2018.2842087\n10.1063/1.4983031\n10.1063/1.4704391\n10.1109/LED.2018.2791987\n10.1109/TED.2014.2316164\n10.1063/1.1644917\n10.1109/TED.2016.2586509\n10.1109/TED.2016.2602209\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.800\n10.1063/1.4725503\n10.1038/srep34811\n10.1049/el.2014.3515\n10.7567/JJAP.55.08PB01"}

The contributions to the power dissipation due to nonzero phase angles of the mechanical, electrical, and piezoelectric constants can be separated in the expression for power dissipation density.

Thus, it is problematic to identify any of the three terms with a specific physical domain, electric or mechanical, or to a coupling as is common in the discussion of loss in piezoelectric materials.

{"title": "Enhanced Sensitivity of a Hydrogen Sulfide Sensor Based on Surface Acoustic Waves at Room Temperature.", "abstract": "In this contribution, a new surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based sensor was proposed for sensing hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S) at room temperature (30 \u00b0C), which was composed of a phase discrimination circuit, a SAW-sensing device patterned with delay line, and a triethanolamine (TEA) coating along the SAW propagation path of the sensing device. The TEA was chosen as the sensitive interface for H\u2082S sensing, owing to the high adsorption efficiency by van der Waals' interactions and hydrogen bonds with H\u2082S molecules at room temperature. The adsorption in TEA towards H\u2082S modulates the SAW propagation, and the change in the corresponding phase was converted into voltage signal proportional to H\u2082S concentration was collected as the sensor signal. A SAW delay line patterned on Y-cut quartz substrate with Al metallization was developed photographically, and lower insertion and excellent temperature stability were achieved thanks to the single-phase unidirectional transducers (SPUDTs) and lower cross-sensitivity of the piezoelectric substrate. The synthesized TEA by the reaction of ethylene oxide and ammonia was dropped into the SAW propagation path of the developed SAW device to build the H\u2082S sensor.

{"title": "Development of Nanocomposite-Based Strain Sensor with Piezoelectric and Piezoresistive Properties.", "abstract": "Sensors provide aninterface between mechanical systems and the physical world. With the move towardsIndustry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems, demands for cost-effective sensors are rapidly increasing. Conventional sensors used for monitoring manufacturing processes are often bulky and need complex processes. In this study, a novel high-sensitive nanocomposite-based sensor is developed for measuring strain. The developed sensor is comprised of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a piezoelectric polymer matrix, and embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) nanoparticles creating a conductive network. Exhibiting both piezoelectric and piezoresistive properties, the developed sensors are capable of strain measurement over a wide frequency band, including static and dynamic measurements. The piezoresistive and piezoelectric properties are fused to improve the overall sensitivity and frequency bandwidth of the sensor. To simulate the sensor, a 3D random walk model and a 2D finite element (FE) model are used to predict the electrical resistivity and the piezoelectric characteristics of the sensor, respectively. The developed models are verified with the experimental results. The developed nanocomposite sensors were employed for strain measurement of a cantilever beam under static load, impulse excitation, free and forced vibrations, collecting both piezoelectric and piezoresistive properties measurements. The obtained signals were fused and compared with those of a reference sensor. The results show that the sensor is capable of strain measurement in the range of 0\u207b10 kHz, indicating its effectiveness at measuring both static and high frequency signals which is an important feature of the sensor.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-09", "authors": ["MehdiSanati", "AllenSandwell", "HamidMostaghimi", "Simon SPark"], "doi": "10.3390/s18113789\n10.1016/j.cirp.2016.04.078\n10.1007/s003390050999\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.2941\n10.1016/0008-6223(95)00021-5\n10.1016/S0032-3861(03)00539-1\n10.1021/cr970102g\n10.1016/S0266-3538(01)00094-X\n10.1002/adma.200401649\n10.1007/BF00540785\n10.1016/S0032-3861(97)10188-4\n10.1002/app.1984.070290518\n10.1108/02602280110388315\n10.1177/1045389X06055282\n10.1080/15421400802330861\n10.1021/ma060733p\n10.1021/ma030399m\n10.1016/S0032-3861(03)00073-9\n10.1039/C5RA08388E\n10.1039/c2nr11841f\n10.1088/0022-3727/46/28/285305\n10.1080/00222340902837527\n10.1039/C3RA45134H\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1002/polb.1994.090320509\n10.1177/0892705714533375\n10.1063/1.2819690\n10.1023/B:JMSC.0000034136.11779.96\n10.1088/0957-4484/22/48/485704\n10.2140/jomms.2009.4.887\n10.1109/20.497321\n10.1109/TAC.1969.1099196"}

{"title": "Micromanipulation of Chromosomes in Insect Spermatocytes.", "abstract": "The micromanipulation of chromosomes has been an essential method for illuminating the mechanism for chromosome congression, the spindle checkpoint, and anaphase chromosome movements, and has been key to understanding what controls chromosome movements during a cell division. A skilled biologist can use a micromanipulator to detach chromosomes from the spindle, to reposition chromosomes within the cell, and to apply forces to chromosomes using a small glass needle with a very fine tip. While perturbations can be made to chromosomes using other methods such as optical trapping and other uses of a laser, to date, no other method allows the repositioning of cellular components on the scale of tens to hundreds of microns with little to no damage to the cell. The selection and preparation of appropriate cells for the micromanipulation of chromosomes, specifically describing the preparation of grasshopper and cricket spermatocyte primary cultures for the use in live-cell imaging and micromanipulation, are described here. In addition, we show the construction of a needle to be used for moving chromosomes within the cell, and the use of a joystick-controlled piezoelectric micromanipulator with a glass needle attached to it to reposition chromosomes within dividing cells. A sample result shows the use of a micromanipulator to detach a chromosome from a spindle in a primary spermatocyte and to reposition that chromosome within the cell.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2018-11-06", "authors": ["Nicolas K HLin", "RyderNance", "JaneSzybist", "AlanCheville", "Leocadia VPaliulis"], "doi": "10.3791/57359"}

However, high accuracy micro-dosing (<5 mg) of fine cohesive powder is less trivial and still remains a challenge because it is difficult to eliminate the aggregation phenomena caused by the strong interparticle cohesive forces (in small capillaries). This paper presents a novel micro-dose method of fine cohesive powders via a pulse inertia force system. A piezoelectric actuator is used to provide a high enough pulse inertia force for a tapered glass nozzle and drive powder particles in the nozzle to be discharged from the nozzle orifice with the help of particle self-gravity. The nozzles with outlet diameters in the range of 100\u207b2000 \u00b5m were fabricated via a glass heating process. The \u03b1-lactose monohydrate powder is used as the micro-dosing powder. The influences of the tapered nozzle outlet diameter, amplitude of the applied pulse voltage, and angle of the nozzle axis on micro-dosing mass are researched. The minimum mean dose mass is 0.6 mg for a single pulse inertia force. The coefficient of variation of dose mass, which represents the micro-dosing stability, can be controlled below 5% when the dose mass is relatively small.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2018-11-06", "authors": ["HongchengWang", "TingZhang", "MiaomiaoZhao", "RangrangChen", "LiqunWu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi9020073\n10.3390/mi8010023\n10.3390/mi8050153\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.10.052\n10.1016/j.partic.2016.09.001\n10.1016/j.powtec.2012.03.038\n10.1016/j.powtec.2016.09.080\n10.1016/j.procir.2016.02.197\n10.1016/j.partic.2016.10.001\n10.1080/14786430512331325598\n10.1016/S0921-8831(08)60509-9\n10.1016/j.powtec.2011.08.015\n10.1016/j.ultras.2009.01.003\n10.1088/0022-3727/39/11/020\n10.1016/j.powtec.2007.01.029\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2015.04.037\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.05.033\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.12.029\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.03.130\n10.1016/0032-5910(94)02931-D"}
{"title": "Compensation of Hysteresis on Piezoelectric Actuators Based on Tripartite PI Model.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric ceramic actuators have been widely used in nanopositioning applications owing to their fast response, high stiffness, and ability to generate large forces. However, the existence of nonlinearities such as hysteresis can greatly deteriorate the accuracy of the manipulation, even causing instability of the whole system. In this article, we have explained the causes of hysteresis based on the micropolarization theory and proposed a piezoelectric ceramic deformation speed law. For this, we analyzed the piezoelectric ceramic actuator deformation speed law based on the domain wall theory. Based on this analysis, a three-stage Prandtl\u207bIshlinskii (PI) model (hereafter referred to as tripartite PI model) was designed and implemented. According to the piezoelectric ceramic deformation speed law, this model makes separate local PI models in different parts of piezoelectric ceramics' hysteresis curve. The weighting values and threshold values of the tripartite PI model were obtained through a quadratic programming optimization algorithm. Compared to the classical PI model, the tripartite PI model can describe the asymmetry of hysteresis curves more accurately. A tripartite PI inverse controller, PI inverse controller, and Preisach inverse controller were used to compensate for the piezoelectric ceramic actuator in the experiment. The experimental results show that the inclusion of the PI inverse controller and the Preisach inverse controller improved the tracking performance of the tripartite PI inverse model by more than 80%.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2018-11-06", "authors": ["DongAn", "HaodongLi", "YingXu", "LixiuZhang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi9020044\n10.1088/0957-4484/23/18/185501\n10.1088/0957-4484/21/22/225705\n10.1109/TASE.2012.2205240\n10.1109/MCS.2013.2279473\n10.1115/1.4000158\n10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2007.06.002\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2011.06.001\n10.1109/TIE.2009.2012450\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2015.08.010\n10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2502282\n10.1109/TMECH.2015.2465868\n10.1109/TASE.2007.895008\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.06.001\n10.1115/1.4028055\n10.1016/0304-8853(86)90066-1\n10.1016/j.physa.2017.04.085\n10.1016/j.physb.2015.01.034\n10.1049/el.2015.3138\n10.1016/j.isatra.2012.01.002\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.04.012\n10.1016/j.camwa.2011.12.015\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.09.043\n10.1111/jace.15179\n10.1016/0041-624X(85)90063-0\n10.1103/PhysRev.95.690\n10.1063/1.1722518"}

In this sense, embedded hardware platforms are a promising technology for developing integrated solutions in Structural Health Monitoring. In this paper, design, test, and specifications for a standalone inspection prototype are presented, which take advantage of piezo-diagnostics principle, statistical processing via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and embedded systems. The equipment corresponds to a piezoelectric active system with the capability to detect defects in structures, by using a PCA-based algorithm embedded in the Odroid-U3 ARM Linux platform. The operation of the equipment consists of applying, at one side of the structure, wide guided waves by means of piezoelectric devices operated in actuation mode and to record the wave response in another side of the structure by using the same kind of piezoelectric devices operated in sensor mode. Based on the nominal response of the guide wave (no damages), represented by means of a PCA statistical model, the system can detect damages between the actuated/sensed points through squared prediction error (Q-statistical index). The system performance was evaluated in a pipe test bench where two kinds of damages were studied: first, a mass is added to the pipe surface, and then leaks are provoked to the pipe structure by means of a drill tool. The experiments were conducted on two lab structures: (i) a meter carbon-steel pipe section and (ii) a pipe loop structure. The wave response was recorded between the instrumented points for two conditions: (i) The pipe in nominal conditions, where several repetitions will be applied to build the nominal statistical model and (ii) when damage is caused to the pipe (mass adding or leak). Damage conditions were graphically recognized through the Q-statistic chart. Thus, the feasibility to implement an automated real-time diagnostic system is demonstrated with minimum processing resources and hardware flexibility.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-11-06", "authors": ["JhonatanCamacho", "Andr\u00e9sQuintero", "MagdaRuiz", "RodolfoVillamizar", "LuisMujica"], "doi": "10.3390/s18113730\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.04.003\n10.1155/2013/270927\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/5/055022\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.476-478.1015\n10.4236/jsip.2013.43B031\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.12.005\n10.1016/j.jsv.2007.12.008\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.05.001\n10.1177/1475921710388972\n10.3390/s17122788\n10.1006/jsvi.2001.4041\n10.1007/s13349-013-0060-5\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.713.107"}

Such an elegant method for preparing electrodes provides a facile, cost-effective, and void/cracking-free nanocomposite distribution on the current collector. The highly porous nanoparticles containing pure carbon attach well to the PVDF membrane which results in an increased active surface area of the electrode to 847 m\u00b2/g. The electrochemical analysis shows that the best weight ratio of CMOF-5 to PVDF equals 85:15, 80:20, and 75:25, respectively. The specific capacitance of these samples is 218 F/g, 210 F/g, and 180 F/g, correspondingly. An additional advantage of the electrode prepared from the carbonized MOF-5 is the possibility to synthesis MOF structures from recovered substrates used in its synthesis (distilled N,N-Dimethylformamide DMF and terephthalic acid recovered from polyethylene terephthalate waste).

{"title": "Effect of substrate orientation on local magnetoelectric coupling in bi-layered multiferroic thin films.", "abstract": "In this study we explore the prospect of strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling in CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 bi-layers as a function of different interfacial boundary conditions. Pulsed laser deposition fabricated thin films on Nb:SrTiO3(100) and Nb:SrTiO3(111) single crystal substrates were characterized in terms of their peculiarities related to the structure-property relationship. Despite the homogeneous phase formation in both films, transmission electron microscopy showed that the bi-layers on Nb:SrTiO3(100) exhibit a higher number of crystallographic defects when compared to the films on Nb:SrTiO3(111). This signifies an intrinsic relationship of the defects and the substrate orientation. To analyze the consequences of these defects on the overall magnetoelectric coupling of the bi-layered films, piezoresponse force microscopy was performed in situ with an applied magnetic field. The local magnetic field dependence of the piezoresponse was obtained using principal component analysis. A detailed analysis of this dependence led to a conclusion that the bi-layers on Nb:SrTiO3(111) exhibit better strain-transfer characteristics between the magnetic and the piezoelectric layer than those which were deposited on Nb:SrTiO3(100). These strain transfer characteristics correlate well with the interface quality and the defect concentration.

In our work, the flexible poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite films decorated with anisotropy-shaped Co in flowers or chains were prepared and studied. The results showed that by increasing the Co filler contents, the EC (electrical conductivity), TC (thermal conductivity), and EMI shielding properties of such PVDF/CNT/Co (flowers or chains) flexible films were significantly improved. In contrast, the PVDF/CNT/Co-chain flexible films exhibit higher performance with respect to the EC, TC, and EMI shielding properties. Total shielding of 35.3 and 32.2 dB were, respectively, obtained by the PVDF/CNT/6 wt % Co-chain with an EC of 2.28 S/cm and the PVDF/CNT/6 wt % Co-flower with an EC of 1.94 S/cm at a film thickness of 0.3 mm. Possibly owing to the conductive dissipation, interfacial polarization, magnetic loss, multiple reflections, and scattering of EM waves, such flexible composite films possessed a remarkable absorption-dominated EMI shielding behavior. These new composite films with enhanced TC are easily able to transform microwave energy into Joule heating systems, making themselves greatly potential for effective EMI shielding as well as rapid heat dissipation.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2018-11-02", "authors": ["XipingLi", "ShuipingZeng", "ShijuE", "LuyangLiang", "ZhongyiBai", "YuanyuanZhou", "BiaoZhao", "RuiZhang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.8b14733"}

However, one important requirement limits their wide application: the refractive index of the upper superstrate must be equal to or larger than that of the optical waveguide core. To overcome this disadvantage, an optical waveguide tactile sensor using graphene is proposed and its operational feasibility was validated experimentally. The pressure-dependent lateral deformation of the low-index prism-like microstructure on an elastomer superstrate has a key role in optically measuring the mechanical pressure. By mechanically varying the lateral deformation area, the waveguide core-graphene-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) interface area was adjusted and the amount of light absorption by graphene became tunable, even when the refractive index of the superstrate was lower than that of the waveguide core. The dynamic response of the sensor was accurately matched to the repeated pressing and release time of the pressure, and exhibited a real-time response to multi-stepped mechanical pressing and releasing using a piezoelectric motor.

Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been intensively studied for information security. However, silicon PUFs are vulnerable to hazards such as modeling and side-channel attacks. Here we demonstrate a magnetic analogue PUF based on perpendicularly magnetized Ta/CoFeB/MgO heterostructures. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy originates from the CoFeB/MgO interface, which is sensitive to the subnanometer variation of MgO thickness within a certain range (0.6-1.3 nm). When the MgO layer is thinned, a thickness variation resulting from ion milling nonuniformity induces unclonable random distributions of eas y-axis magnetization orientations in heterostructures. The analogue PUF can provide a much larger key size than a conventional binary-bit counterpart. Moreover, after the thinning process, the unique eas y-axis magnetization orientation in each single device was formed, which can avoid setting random states to realize low power consumption and high-density integration. This magnetic PUF is a promising innovative primitive for secret key generation and storage with high security in the IoT era.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2018-10-27", "authors": ["HuimingChen", "MinSong", "ZheGuo", "RuofanLi", "QimingZou", "ShijiangLuo", "ShuaiZhang", "QiangLuo", "JeongminHong", "LongYou"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b03338"}

Piezoelectric composite materials within a spinal interbody cage to produce power in response to physiological lumbar loads have recently been investigated. A piezoelectric macro-fiber composite spinal interbody generated sufficient power to stimulate bone growth in a pilot ovine study, despite fabrication challenges. The objective of the present study was to electromechanically evaluate three new piezoelectric disc composites, 15-disc insert, seven-disc insert, and seven-disc Compliant Layer Adaptive Composite Stack (CLACS) insert, within a spinal interbody, and validate their use for electrical stimulation and promoting bone growth. All implants were electromechanically assessed under cyclic loads of 1000 N at 2 Hz, representing physiological lumbar loading. All three configurations produced at least as much power as the piezoelectric macro-fiber composites, validating the use of piezoelectric discs for this application.

The BLIHS films selectively displayed iridescent structural color derived from Bragg diffraction of OALIS, whereas the color states transform to noniridescent color because of Q-AALIS just by rotating the sample. Furthermore, the patterning process could be realized by using the spray-coating method on the BILIS films as quasiamorphous array layers.

Hot-melt screw extrusion of PVDF with 5 wt % of montmorillonite (AR \u2248 12) or fluoromica (AR \u2248 27) resulted in formation of phase-separated blends. Replacing the clays with their organoclay derivatives, organomontmorillonite or organofluoromica, resulted in the corresponding intercalated nanocomposites. The organoclays induced formation of polar \u03b2- and \u03b3-polymorphs of PVDF in contrast to the \u03b1-polymorph, which dominates in the pure PVDF and the PVDF/clay blends. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance revealed that the content of the \u03b1-phase in the nanocomposites was never higher than 7% of the total crystalline phase, whereas the \u03b2/\u03b3 mass ratio was close to 1:2, irrespective of the AR or crystallization conditions. X-ray diffraction showed that the oriented particles with a larger AR caused orientation of the polar lamellar crystals of PVDF. In the presence of the organofluoromica, PVDF formed a chevron-like lamellar nanostructure, where the polymer chains are extended along the extrusion direction, whereas the lamellar crystals were slanted from normal to the extrusion direction.

An increase in \u03b2-phase crystallinity is noticed for the PVDF/Fe-ZnO nanocomposite when compared to PVDF/ZnO at the same filler concentration. Specifically, at 1 wt%, the relative crystallinity of the composite containing Fe-ZnO calculated from FTIR is 48.1%, while for ZnO, it is 40.9%. A dielectric constant of 96 is reached for PVDF/Fe-ZnO at 2 wt%, in addition to a peak to peak output piezoelectric voltage of 2.4 V. This is several times higher than that observed for PVDF/ZnO nanocomposites and those fabricated without \u03b3-irradiation (1.1 V). Piezoelectric voltage generation is also observed during the stretching, bending and rolling vibrational movements of the sample, indicating its possible use in flexible electronic devices. The observed superior performance of the PVDF/Fe-ZnO system is attributed to the influence of the star like morphology and dispersion of Fe-ZnO, and the enhanced filler-polymer interaction and crosslink formation by the \u03b3-irradiation process.

How tumor cells sense and regulate tissue mechanics is largely unknown. Here, we show that mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo regulates mitosis and tissue stiffness of Drosophila gliomas, but not non-transformed brains. PIEZO1 is overexpressed in aggressive human\u00a0gliomas and its expression inversely correlates with patient survival. Deleting PIEZO1 suppresses the growth of glioblastoma stem cells, inhibits tumor development, and prolongs mouse survival. Focal mechanical force activates prominent PIEZO1-dependent currents from glioma cell processes, but not soma. PIEZO1 localizes at focal adhesions to activate integrin-FAK signaling, regulate extracellular matrix, and reinforce tissue stiffening. In turn, a stiffer mechanical microenvironment elevates PIEZO1 expression to promote glioma aggression. Therefore, glioma cells are mechanosensory in a PIEZO1-dependent manner, and targeting PIEZO1 represents a strategy to break the reciprocal, disease-aggravating feedforward circuit between tumor cell mechanotransduction and the aberrant tissue mechanics.

A novel actuator based on piezo-electric transduction (PZTA), part of a subcutaneous bone conduction hearing aid device, was sequentially implanted on three locations: 1) Immediately posterior to pinna; 2) 50-60\u202fmm posterior to pinna, approximately the same distance as between the BAHA (bone anchored hearing aid) location and the ear canal, but the same horizontal level as location 1; 3) the traditional BAHA location. Using a single point 3-dimensional laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) system, three types of motion measurements were performed at the cochlear promontory for each stimulation location: 1) ipsilateral side, 2) contralateral side, 3) measurements 1 and 2 were repeated after mastoidectomy on the ipsilateral side.\nOn average, stimulation at locations 1 and 2 show a trend for higher promontory motion relative to location 3 (BAHA location) above 1\u202fkHz.

Based on the linear relationship between the TOF of a guided wave and temperature, analyses show that the TOF of the baseline signal can be compensated by the temperature measurement of the inspected materials without estimating the temperature compensation parameters. The inversion is based on the optimization of the TOF misfit function between the inspected and compensated baseline TOFs of the guided waves, and is applied by the elastic net penalty approach to perform thickness change mapping in a structural health monitoring (SHM) application. Experiments that are conducted in isotropic plates by piezoelectric sensors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We integrated piezo-bending actuators in a 24-well system for the generation of strip-like rat and human EHT attached to hollow, elastic silicone posts.

{"title": "Accurate Needle Localization Using Two-Dimensional Power Doppler and B-Mode Ultrasound Image Analyses: A Feasibility Study.", "abstract": "Curvilinear ultrasound transducers are commonly used in various needle insertion interventions, but localizing the needle in curvilinear ultrasound images is usually challenging. In this paper, a new method is proposed to localize the needle in curvilinear ultrasound images by exciting the needle using a piezoelectric buzzer and imaging the excited needle using a curvilinear ultrasound transducer to acquire a power Doppler image and a B-mode image. The needle-induced Doppler responses that appear in the power Doppler image are analyzed to estimate the needle axis initially and identify the candidate regions that are expected to include the needle.

Because bone is a piezoelectric material, mechanical strain that is generated by chewing force on bone adjacent to the dental root produces electrical charges. Relative variations in the EF sum values with distance of nodes from the centerline of the root was observed for both cases and studied for two different boundary voltage conditions. Simulation and analysis were performed using the commercial finite-element analysis package ANSYS14. The detailed convergence analysis validated the effectiveness and accuracy of finite-element simulations. Before and after implantation, a significant variation in generation of electric charges at adjacent bone of the dental root was observed.

Their presence and functional role in the enteric nervous system is still not known. We hypothesize that they play a role in mechanotransduction in enteric neurons. Our aims are to quantify the presence of both Piezo1 and 2 in enteric neurons throughout the gastrointestinal tract using immunohistochemistry and analyze their function(s) using neuroimaging techniques and pharmacological investigations. In order to perform a systematic and comparative study, we performed our experiments in gastrointestinal tissue from guinea pigs, mice and humans. Piezo1 (20-70%) is expressed by both enteric neuronal cell bodies and fibers in the myenteric and submucosal plexi of all the species investigated. Generally, Piezo1 expressing somata are more numerous in the submucosal plexus (50-80%) than in the myenteric plexus (15-35%) apart from the stomach where Piezo1 is expressed in up to 60% of cell bodies. Myenteric Piezo1 neurons mainly (60-100%) but not exclusively, also express nitric oxide synthase, a minority express choline acetyltransferase. In the submucosal plexus, Piezo1 neurons co-express vasoactive intestinal peptide (40-90%). Conversely, expression of Piezo2 is extremely rare in the somata of enteric neurons and is present in few neurites. In functional experiments, 38-76% of the mechanosensitive neurons expressed Piezo1 channels. Statistical analysis showed a positive significant correlation between mechanosensitive and Piezo1 positive neurons. However, pharmacological experiments using an activator and an inhibitor of Piezo channels did not demonstrate changes in mechanotransduction.

{"title": "Adaptive Feedforward Compensating Self-Sensing Method for Active Flutter Suppression.", "abstract": "A single piezoelectric patch can be used as both a sensor and an actuator by means of the self-sensing piezoelectric actuator, and the function of self-sensing shows several advantages in many application fields. However, some problems exist in practical application. First, a capacitance bridge circuit is set up to realize the function of self-sensing, but the precise matching of the capacitance of the bridge circuit is hard to obtain due to the standardization of electric components and variations of environmental conditions. Second, a local strain is induced by the self-sensing actuator that is not related to the global vibration of the structure, which would affect the performance of applications, especially in active vibration control. The above problems can be tackled by the feedforward compensation method that is proposed in this paper. A configured piezoelectric self-sensing circuit is improved by a feedforward compensation tunnel, and a gain of compensation voltage is adjusted by the time domain and frequency domain's steepest descent algorithms to alleviate the capacitance mismatching and local strain problems. The effectiveness of the method is verified in the experiment of the active vibration control in a wind tunnel, and the control performance of compensated self-sensing actuation is compared to the performance with capacitance mismatching and local strain.

{"title": "Analysis of Errors in the Estimation of Impact Positions in Plate-Like Structure through the Triangulation Formula by Piezoelectric Sensors Monitoring.", "abstract": "The structural health monitoring (SHM) of critical structures is a complex task that involves the use of different sensors that are also aimed at the identification of the location of the impact point using ultrasonic sensors. For the evaluation of the impact position, reference is often made to the well-known triangulation method. This method requires the estimation of the differential time of arrival (DToA) and the group velocity of the Lamb waves propagating into a plate-like structure: the uncertainty of these two parameters is taken into consideration as main cause of localization error. The work proposes a simple laboratory procedure based on a set-up with a pair of sensors that are symmetrically placed with respect to the impact point, to estimate the uncertainty of the DToA and the propagation velocity estimates. According to a theoretical analysis of the error for the impact position, the experimental uncertainties of DToA and the propagation velocity are used to estimate the overall limit of the SHM system for the impact positioning. Because the error for the DToA estimate depends also on the adopted signal processing, three common methods are selected and compared: the threshold, the correlation method, and a likelihood algorithm. Finally, the analysis of the positioning error using multisensory configuration is reported as useful for the design of the SHM system.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-10-17", "authors": ["EugenioMarino-Merlo", "AndreaBulletti", "PietroGiannelli", "MarcoCalzolai", "LorenzoCapineri"], "doi": "10.3390/s18103426\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.01.020\n10.1177/1475921707081979\n10.1177/1045389X10372003\n10.3390/s18072218\n10.1177/1475921717750047\n10.1016/0029-1021(76)90027-X\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2016.11.003\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.08.013\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.10.007\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2000.tb01175.x\n10.1088/1361-665X/aab19e\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.06.009\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/3/035021\n10.1177/1475921704041866\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.01.017\n10.3390/s17102270\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.01.023\n10.1121/1.402348\n10.1121/1.1911582\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.01.011\n10.1177/1475921716672206"}

{"title": "Influence of Schizophrenia-Associated Gene Egr3 on Sleep Behavior and Circadian Rhythms in Mice.", "abstract": "Up to 80% of people meeting DSM-IV definitions for schizophrenia will exhibit difficulties with sleep, along with a breakdown in circadian entrainment and rhythmicity. The changes to the sleep and circadian systems in this population are thought to be interdependent, as evidenced by the frequent use of the combined term \"sleep and circadian rhythm disruption\" or \"SCRD\" to describe their occurrence. To understand links between sleep and circadian problems in the schizophrenia population, we analyzed the duration and rhythmicity of sleep behavior in mice lacking function of the immediate early gene early growth response 3 ( Egr3). EGR3 has been associated with schizophrenia risk in humans, and Egr3-deficient (-/-) mice display various features of schizophrenia that are responsive to antipsychotic treatment. While Egr3-/- mice slept less than their wildtype (WT) littermates, they showed no evidence of circadian disorganization; in fact, circadian rhythms of activity were more robust in these mice compared with WT, as measured by time series analysis and the relative amplitude index of Van Someren's suite of non-parametric circadian rhythm analyses. Differences in circadian robustness were maintained when the animals were transferred to several weeks of housing under constant darkness or constant light. Together, our results suggest that Egr3-/- mice retain control over the circadian timekeeping of sleep and wake, while showing impaired sleep. The findings are compatible with those from a surprising array of mouse models of schizophrenia and raise the possibility that SCRD may be 2 separate disorders in the schizophrenia population requiring different treatment strategies.", "journal": "Journal of biological rhythms", "date": "2018-10-16", "authors": ["Amanda MMaple", "Rachel KRowe", "JonathanLifshitz", "FabianFernandez", "Amelia LGallitano"], "doi": "10.1177/0748730418803802"}

{"title": "Review on Electromechanical Coupling Properties of Biomaterials.", "abstract": "Electromechanical coupling properties of biological materials, especially cellulose from plant cell walls and proteins from animals, are of great interest for applications in biocompatible sensors and actuators and ecofriendly energy harvesters. On the basis of their anisotropic nanostructures, cellulose and fibrous proteins such as collagen, silk, keratin, etc. are expected to be piezoelectric; however, this property does not necessarily translate to cellulose- or protein-containing bulk materials. In fact, the values of piezoelectric coefficients reported for cellulose and proteins in the literature vary over several orders of magnitude, which raises the question of whether these are truly intrinsic piezoelectric properties of biological materials or whether they are obscured with other electromechanical coupling processes such as electrostriction, flexoelectricity, electrochemical transport, or electrostatic deformation. This critical question about intrinsic and extrinsic electromechanical coupling mechanisms is reviewed in this article. The origin of piezoelectricity of cellulose and collagen (the most widely studied protein for piezoelectricity) is discussed based on their molecular structures. Key requirements to construct macroscopic piezoelectric biocomposites are addressed in terms of packing orders or arrangements of polar domains in composites. On the basis of this structural argument, truly piezoelectric responses of macroscopic materials fabricated with or containing cellulose and collagen are found to be extremely difficult to observe or quantify; most values reported in the literature as piezoelectric coefficients of such materials appear to originate from other electromechanical coupling mechanisms. Clarifying these mechanisms is important to properly design electromechanical devices using biobased materials.", "journal": "ACS applied bio materials", "date": "2018-10-15", "authors": ["InseokChae", "Chang KyuJeong", "ZoubeidaOunaies", "Seong HKim"], "doi": "10.1021/acsabm.8b00309"}

The films were characterized by SEM, hardness test, UV-Vis, photothermal beam deflection spectroscopy, and IR spectroscopy, while photocatalytic activity was measured by the fluorescence-based method of the terephthalic acid probe and wetting by contact angle measurements. Films containing 10 mol.% of Zr showed the best compromise regarding photocatalytic activity and mechanical stability while from substrates point of view PVC performed the best, followed by PMMA, D1, and D2.

{"title": "Stochastic Polarization Instability in PbTiO_{3}.", "abstract": "Although discussions of structural phase transitions in prototypical ferroelectric systems with the perovskite structure, such as BaTiO_{3} and PbTiO_{3}, started almost seventy years ago, an atomic-level description of the polar characteristics as a function of temperature, pressure, and composition remains topical. Here we provide a novel quantitative description of the temperature-driven local structural correlations in PbTiO_{3} via the development of characteristic relative cationic shifts. The results give new insights into the phase transition beyond those reliant on the long-range order. The ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition of PbTiO_{3} is realized by the extent of a stochastic polarization instability driven by a progressive misalignment instead of a complete disappearance of the local dipoles, which further suggests that such polarization instability is chemically induced at the morphotropic phase boundary of PbTiO_{3}-based solid solutions with giant piezoelectric effect. As such, our results not only identify the evolving atomistic disorder in a perovskite-based ferroelectric system, but also suggest that polarization instability can serve as a generic fingerprint for phase transitions as well as for better understanding structure-property relationships in PbTiO_{3}-based ferroelectric solid solutions.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2018-10-13", "authors": ["KDatta", "IMargaritescu", "D AKeen", "BMihailova"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.137602"}

{"title": "Force detection, center of pressure tracking, and energy harvesting from a piezoelectric knee implant.", "abstract": "Recent developments in the field of orthopedic materials and procedures have made the total knee replacement (TKR) an option for people who suffer from knee diseases and injuries. One of the ongoing debates in this area involves the correlation of postoperative joint functionality to intraoperative alignment. Due to a lack of in vivo data from the knee joint after surgery, the establishment of a well-quantified alignment method is hindered. In order to obtain information about knee function after the operation, the design of a self-powered instrumented knee implant is proposed in this study. The design consists of a total knee replacement bearing equipped with four piezoelectric transducers distributed in the medial and lateral compartments. The piezoelectric transducers are utilized to measure the total axial force applied on the tibial bearing through the femoral component of the joint, as well as to track the movement in the center of pressure (CoP). In addition, the generated voltage from the piezoelectrics can be harvested and stored to power embedded electronics for further signal conditioning and data transmission purposes. Initially, finite element (FE) analysis is performed on the knee bearing to select the best location of the transducers with regards to sensing the total force and location of the CoP. A series of experimental tests are then performed on a fabricated prototype which aim to investigate the sensing and energy harvesting performance of the device. Piezoelectric force and center of pressure measurements are compared to actual experimental quantities for twelve different relative positions of the femoral component and bearing of the knee implant in order to evaluate the performance of the sensing system.

{"title": "Broadband 1-3 Piezoelectric Composite Transducer Design Using Sierpinski Gasket Fractal Geometry.", "abstract": "Wider operational bandwidth is an important requirement of an ultrasound transducer across many applications. In nature, it can be observed that several hearing organs possess a broad operating bandwidth by having a varying length scales structure. Moreover, conventional 1-3 piezoelectric composite transducers have been widely recognized for their wider bandwidth over their piezoelectric ceramic counterparts. In this paper, a novel 1-3 piezoelectric composite design using a fractal geometry, known as the Sierpinski Gasket (SG), is proposed in order to explore the potential of further extending the operational bandwidth and sensitivity of the transducer. Two equivalent 1-3 piezocomposite designs are compared to this end, one with a conventional periodic parallelepiped-shaped pillar structure and one with the SG fractal geometry, both theoretically, using a finite-element analysis package, and experimentally. The transmit voltage response and open-circuit voltage response are used to illustrate bandwidth improvement from the fractal composite design. Following the simulation results, a 580-kHz single-element transducer, utilizing the proposed SG fractal microstructure, is fabricated using a pillar placement methodology. The performance of the prototyped device is characterized and compared with a conventional 1-3 composite design, as well as with a commercial ultrasound transducer. In the one-way transmission mode, a bandwidth improvement of 27.2% and sensitivity enhancement of 3.8 dB can be found with the SG fractal design compared to an equivalent conventional composite design and up 105.1% bandwidth improvement when compared to the commercial transducer. In the one-way reception mode, the bandwidth improvement for the SG fractal design is 2.5% and 32.9% when compared to the conventional and commercial transducers, respectively.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2018-10-09", "authors": ["HaoyuFang", "ZhenQiu", "Anthony JMulholland", "Richard LO'Leary", "AnthonyGachagan"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2874384"}
{"title": "Fully Differential Piezoelectric Button-Like Mode Disk Resonator for Liquid Phase Sensing.", "abstract": "We present a unique lateral shear resonance mode excited in a microelectromechanical (MEM) disk resonator. We refer to this proposed mode as the button-like (BL) mode. The BL mode has a characteristic lateral strain profile (based on the sum of orthogonal strain components in the plane of fabrication) which resembles a shirt button, hence our choice of name for this mode. The strain profile of the BL mode is highly suited for piezoelectric transduction. Like the more widely reported wine-glass (WG) or elliptical mode, the BL mode offers feedthrough cancellation through fully differential transduction. However, compared to the WG mode, the BL mode possesses a higher coupling coefficient ( [Formula: see text]) and a higher quality ( Q ) factor for the same disk radius. These advantages make the BL mode highly attractive for realizing electrically addressed MEM resonators for liquid-phase sensing. This paper examines various design aspects pertaining to the BL mode: tether geometry, characterization setup, size of disk, and even the effect of the gap around the disk on the Q factor. The highest Q factor measured in water is 410 based on a disk with a radius of [Formula: see text].

{"title": "Comparison of Surgical Outcome after Impacted Third Molar Surgery Using Piezotome and a Conventional Rotary Handpiece.", "abstract": "One of the most commonly performed surgical procedures by oral and maxillofacial surgeons all over the world is the removal of impacted teeth. The most critical and important steps in third molar extraction are bone cutting or osteotomy. Many techniques are used for this purpose including chisels and mallet, rotary instruments, and ultrasonic-based bone cutting instruments. Piezotome is newer and innovative device for osteotomy based on piezoelectric vibrations. Piezotome is considered very efficient in performing osteotomy because of its selective cutting; being inert against soft tissues, including nerves and blood vessels. The aim of this study was to compare the surgical outcome of third molar surgery using conventional handpiece and piezotome with all other criteria remaining same for all the individuals.\nAll patients reporting to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery, Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Mangalore, for impacted mandibular third molar removal were screened. A total of 30 patients with same Pederson difficulty index for bilateral impacted third molar were selected for the study. The study involved the use of piezotome on one side (Side A) and rotary technique (Side B) on the other side for osteotomy on the same patient with an interval of 1 month. Therapeutic management was same for both the sides. Operating time was recorded in each surgery. Patients were examined postoperatively on 1\nThe mean operating time was 48.13 min in piezotome (Side A) and 32.90 min in conventional handpiece (Side B) which was statistically significant (\nOperating time with piezotome was more than that of conventional handpiece, but the postoperative responses such as pain, trismus, and edema were less in piezotome. Hence, despite being a slower procedure, piezotome can be an effective alternative for osteotomy in impacted third molar surgery. We recommend using piezotome for bone cutting and conventional rotary handpiece for tooth sectioning in order to obtain favorable outcomes as well as decreasing the operating time.", "journal": "Contemporary clinical dentistry", "date": "2018-10-09", "authors": ["PritikaSrivastava", "PremalathaShetty", "SameepShetty"], "doi": "10.4103/ccd.ccd_354_18"}

It is shown that with increasing the conductivity of the film at first the parallel resonant frequency does not change, then it decreases in a certain interval and after that remains practically constant. With increasing the width of the gap between the film and the resonator, the resonant frequency increases and reaches the saturation. At that the degree of the total frequency change decreases with decreasing the conductivity of the film. We also investigated the dependence of the maximum value of the real part of the electrical impedance on the film conductivity at the different values of the width of the gap between the film and the resonator. The dependences of the maximum value of the real part of the electrical impedance on the width of the gap between the film and the resonator are also obtained for different values of the film conductivity.

In contrast, nonbonded piezo sensor (NBPS) provides a viable platform to assess the condition of human bones, tissues, and other biomedical subjects using the EMI technique without inflicting pain or irritation to the skin. The name NBPS was coined to emphasize that there was no direct bonding between the PZT patch and the live subject; instead, the PZT patch was bonded to a supporting medium, which maintains the mechanical interaction between the PZT patch and the subject. However, there are several aspects in the analysis of NBPS configuration that cannot be addressed completely through experimental study due to measurement constraints, cost, and time. For example, experimentally changing the density of bone continuously to study the osteoporosis effect is a tedious task warranting large number of specimens. This paper presents a detailed parametric study based on finite element method covering condition monitoring of human bones using the NBPS configuration. It is for the first time that 3D analysis for specimen identification and damage detection in bones using NBPS has been carried out. In addition to the validation of the numerical model against the previously established experimental studies involving bones, quantification of the extent of damage and its localization has been investigated.

In the present work, the abrupt O-polar ZnO/Ga-polar GaN heterointerface was successfully achieved by using high O/Zn ratio flux during the ZnO nucleation growth. Atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field and bright-field transmission electron microscopy observation revealed that this polarity inversion confines within one monolayer by forming the (0001) plane inversion domain boundary (IDB) at the ZnO/GaN heterointerface. Through theoretical calculation and topology analysis, the geometry of this IDB was determined to possess an octahedral Ga atomic layer in the interface, with one O/N layer symmetrically bonded at the tetrahedral site. The computed electronic structure of all considered IDBs revealed a metallic character at the heterointerface. More interestingly, the presence of two-dimensional (2D) hole gas (2DHG) or 2D electron gas (2DEG) is uncovered by investigating the chemical bonding and charge transfer at the heterointerface. This work not only clarifies the polarity control and interfacial configuration of the O-polar ZnO/Ga-polar GaN heterojunction but, more importantly, also gives insight into their further application on heterojunction field-effect transistors as well as hybrid ZnO/GaN optoelectronic devices.

The authors present the application of piezoelectric scalpel for the correction of different chin deformities. The distinctive characteristics of this device allow the authors to avoid or reduce the immediate genioplasty complications.\nFifty-five patients of defective chin have been treated from January 2006 to April 2008. Intraoral genioplasty was performed during the correction of dentofacial dysmorphisms or associated with nasal surgery. The authors used a piezoelectric cutting device to perform different osteotomies and if necessary, interpositional graft was used to stabilize bony segments.\nPiezosurgery has been associated with a fewer number of postoperative complications, especially as regard intraoperative bleeding, nerve injuries (immediate and late), hematomas and seromas, asymmetry (immediate and early). The mean time for completing the complete procedure of genioplasty with piezosurgery was almost the same compared with the saw and drill.\nGenioplasty represents one of the most common ancillary procedures and may be associated with corrective surgery of dentofacial dysmorphisms.

Owing to the high void ratio of the 3D meshed-core structure, the bending stiffness of the cantilever can be lowered. Thus, the deflection of the harvester and the strain in the piezoelectric layer increase. According to vibration tests, the resonance frequency is 15.8% lower and the output power is 68% higher than in the conventional solid-core PVEH. Compared to the solid-core PVEH, the proposed meshed-core PVEH (10\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0280\u00a0\u03bcm) has 1.3 times larger tip deflection and the maximum output power is 24.6\u00a0\u03bcW under resonance condition at 18.7\u00a0Hz and 0.2G acceleration.

Variation of the BTO nanoparticle (NP) content enabled the systematic tuning of the physical parameters that are related to power generation in the composite. The Young's modulus of the PVDF\u207bBTO composite initially increased, and then eventually decreased, with the increasing BTO content, which was probably due to the clustering effect of the high modulus BTO NPs. The dielectric constant of the composite continuously increased as the BaTiO\u2083 content increased. The piezoelectric outputs were greatly enhanced at 10 wt% of BTO, where the Young's modulus was the highest.

This study evaluated the effects of low intensity electric current on the inorganic bovine graft in calvaria defects. Bone defects were performed with piezoelectric system in the calvaria of Wistar rats divided into four groups (n\u2009=\u200924): (C) without grafting and without electrical stimulation; (E) with grafting; (MC) without grafting and submitted to electrical stimulation; (MC\u2009+\u2009E) with grafting and submitted to electrical stimulation. Inflammatory, angiogenic and osteogenic events during bone repair at the 10th, 30th, 60th, and 90th days were considered. Several inflammatory markers demonstrated the efficacy of grafting in reducing inflammation, particularly when subjected to electrical stimulation. Angiogenesis and collagen organization were more evident by electrical stimulation application on the grafts. Moreover, the osteogenic cell differentiation process indicated that the application of microcurrent on grafting modulated the homeostasis of bone remodeling. It is concluded that microcurrent favored the performance of grafts in calvarial rat model. Low-intensity electrical current might improve the osteoconductive property of grafting in bone defects.

{"title": "[Effect of Unloading Knee Brace on Dynamic Parameters of the Stance Phase of Gait in Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis].", "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Knee joint is the most common place where osteoarthritis may occur. A specific therapy is indicated to patients depending on the degree of disability and other signs. The available methods and their clinical value are regularly assessed in systematic reviews and meta-analysis of clinical studies. The evidence of working mechanism of the specific therapeutic intervention is another important part of evaluating its therapy effect. One of the possibilities of knee osteoarthritis conservative treatment is a functional prophylactic knee brace. This type of knee brace is designed to transfer the load away from the affected part of the knee joint in every step. The main goal of this study was to determine the effect of a prophylactic knee brace on dynamic parameters of the stance phase of gait in patients with knee osteoarthritis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The research involved twelve subjects with predominantly unilateral medial knee osteoarthritis of grade 2 and 3. Six patients did not complete the study. Therefore, the data of six persons were processed (average age 68.3 \u00b1 4.4 years, average weight 83 \u00b1 15.9 kg, average height 170.5 \u00b1 11.7 cm). There were two piezoelectric Kistler 9286AA force plates used to determine the reaction forces. In total, six attempts were evaluated - three attempts with the knee brace and three attempts without it. Each subject completed three measurements. The first one took place at the beginning of the research, the second one after three months of using the brace, and the last one took place three months after the brace removal. The data processing methods were accustomed. At the beginning and at the end of the study the patients completed the WOMAC questionnaire and determined the level of their pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS The minimum value (p = 0.020) and the second maximum value (p = 0.035) of vertical reaction force significantly increased on the unaffected limb after a short-term application of a knee brace. There were significant increases found for walking without a brace in the maximum vertical force in the braking phase on the affected limb (p = 0.006) after three months of bracing, followed by similar results in the maximum vertical force in the braking (p = 0.001) as well as the propulsion (p = 0.035) phase on the unaffected side. Furthermore, we observed a significant extension in the overall duration of the stance phase of gait (p = 0.001) on the affected limb. According to the WOMAC and VAS results, three patients experienced subjective conditional improvement, two subjective deterioration and one participant remained unchanged. DISCUSSION The individualized solutions, i.e. their \"adaptation\" to a particular type of knee arthrosis in each patient, is the biggest problem in the treatment of knee arthrosis using a prophylactic brace. Our results confirm the usefulness of modern knee orthosis in terms of motion biomechanics. However, it still remains to be proved that it is possible to use the brace for a long time during the active time of the day and that this use brings about a significant relief from troubles, improving the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS The effect of the orthosis application was reflected in force and time parameters of the vertical and anteroposterior component of the reaction force. The use of a prophylactic knee brace can influence the dynamics of gait. The short-term effect of prophylactic brace use is reflected in an increased load on the unaffected limb. From a long-term point of view, a prolongation of the stance phase in both extremities was observed. However, the positive effect of the knee brace use tended to persist even after the brace removal. There were no significant changes in the subjective assessment of pain, stiffness and function of the knee joint.

In this report, a highly enhanced piezocomposite energy harvester (PCEH) is developed using a three-dimensional electroceramic skeleton by mimicking and reproducing the sea porifera architecture.

{"title": "Multiplexed detection of cancer biomarkers using a microfluidic platform integrating single bead trapping and acoustic mixing techniques.", "abstract": "It is critical to reliably and rapidly detect multiple disease biomarkers in tiny liquid samples with high sensitivity to meet the growing demand for point-of-care diagnostics. This paper reports a microfluidic platform integrating magnetic-based single bead trapping in conjunction with acoustic micromixing for simultaneous detection of multiple cancer biomarkers within minutes. Individual beads retained by permalloy (NiFe81/19) microarray were used to capture biomarkers and facilitate the fluorescence identification. A numerical study indicates that the magnetic force keeping a bead in the trap is proportional to the thickness of the permalloy array and the external magnetic field strength, while inversely proportional to the size of the trap. The acoustic microstreaming activated by a piezo transducer was applied to generate fast-switching flow patterns to minimize the diffusion length scales. The flow at various driving frequencies was experimentally tested to achieve the optimal mixing effect. The flow field of the microstreaming was subsequently described by a mathematical model to understand the flow further. Finally, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were employed as model analytes to demonstrate the capability of the platform for rapid biomarker detection. With the aid of acoustic micromixing, the detection can be finished in 20 minutes. The respective limit of detection of PSA and CEA is 0.028 ng mL-1 (0.8 pM) and 3.1 ng mL-1 (17 pM), which is respectively 1/142 and 1/3 of the cutoff value of PSA and CEA.

Detailed analysis of the formed structures revealed internal organization by the length of the needle-like domains, which ranged from uniform to quasi-periodic and even chaotic modes as a function of distance from the switched region. Comprehensive investigations and numerical simulations allowed to attribute explored phenomena to charge injection during the field application and further switching under the action of electric field induced by injected charges near the tip.

A\u03b2 peptides are amphipathic molecules that can modulate membrane mechanics. Because the mechanosensitive cation channel PIEZO1 is gated by membrane tension and curvature, it prompted us to test the effects of A\u03b2 on PIEZO1. Using precision fluid shear stress as a stimulus, we found that A\u03b2 monomers inhibit PIEZO1 at femtomolar to picomolar concentrations. The A\u03b2 oligomers proved much less potent. The effect of A\u03b2s on Piezo gating did not involve peptide-protein interactions since the D and L enantiomers had similar effects. Incubating a fluorescent derivative of A\u03b2 and a fluorescently tagged PIEZO1, we showed that A\u03b2 can colocalize with PIEZO1, suggesting that they both had an affinity for particular regions of the bilayer. To better understand the PIEZO1 inhibitory effects of A\u03b2, we examined their effect on wound healing. We observed that over-expression of PIEZO1 in HEK293 cells increased cell migration velocity ~10-fold, and both enantiomeric A\u03b2 peptides and GsMTx4 independently inhibited migration, demonstrating involvement of PIEZO1 in cell motility. As part of the motility study we examined the correlation of PIEZO1 function with tension in the cytoskeleton using a genetically encoded fluorescent stress probe.

{"title": "Laparoscopic Bilateral Cervicosacropexy and Vaginosacropexy: New Surgical Treatment Option in Women with Pelvic Organ Prolapse and Urinary Incontinence.", "abstract": "Sacrocolpopexy (SCP) is the gold standard for apical prolapse treatment. However, the technical performance of each SCP is strongly dependent on the surgeon's own discretion and comparison of clinical outcomes with respect to urinary incontinence (UI) is difficult. We developed a comprehensible laparoscopic surgical technique for the treatment of apical prolapse with UI.\nA total of 120 women with UI underwent laparoscopic bilateral SCP for apical prolapse. Thereby, the uterosacral ligaments (USLs) were bilaterally replaced by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) tapes of identical length and shape, which were fixed at defined anatomical landmarks (cervix/vaginal vault and S1).\nThe restoration of apical vaginal support was achieved in 116 patients (97%); restoration failed in the first 4 patients owing to the use of fast-absorbable sutures. Seventy-eight patients (65%) with mixed and urgency UI symptoms before surgery achieved continence. The mean hospitalization was 3 days; no major complications were observed intraoperatively.\nThe advantage of laparoscopic cervicosacropexy (laCESA) and laparoscopic vaginosacropexy (laVASA) lies in the comprehensible surgical technique (clearly defined technique) and the minimal amount of material used (no polypropylenes). The possibility of a short operating time and short hospitalization depicts this laparoscopic bilateral USL replacement as one treatment alternative in patients with apical prolapse suffering from UI.", "journal": "Journal of endourology", "date": "2018-09-25", "authors": ["SokolRexhepi", "EntelaRexhepi", "MartinStumm", "PeterMallmann", "SebastianLudwig"], "doi": "10.1089/end.2018.0474"}
{"title": "Comparison of piezosurgery, percutaneous osteotomy, and endonasal continuous osteotomy techniques with a caprine skull model.", "abstract": "Osteotomy is a crucial step in rhinoplasty, which can have a significant impact on the outcome. In addition to previous percutaneous (external perforating) and endonasal (internal) approaches, piezosurgery has been used in rhinoplasty practice since 2007. This experimental model was planned to compare the three osteotomy techniques.\nThis study was performed on a caprine skull osteotomy model. Three groups were created from 12 animals, namely, endonasal continuous, external perforating, and piezosurgery groups. All the groups were evaluated for bone gaps, comminuted fractures, and nasal mucosa damage.\nThere were no comminuted fractures and mucosal defects in any of the samples in the piezo osteotomy group. The average amount of bone gap at the osteotomy site and the nasal mucosa damage was lower in the piezo group than in the other groups. The time required for the osteotomy was shorter in the endonasal group, similar to that in the external and piezo groups.\nNew techniques are constantly being developed to achieve better results in rhinoplasty. As a natural consequence to technological developments, new devices are being introduced to rhinoplasty practice. Piezo is one such device. We have found that piezo osteotomy has resulted in lower amounts of nasal mucosal damage and comminuted fractures.

We find that the Janus MXY monolayers are semiconductors with a wide range of band gaps ranging from 0.739 to 2.884 eV. We show that TiSO, ZrSO, and HfSO monolayers are promising candidates for photocatalysis because of their suitable band gaps and optimal redox potentials for water splitting, and ZrSeS and HfSeS monolayers are suitable candidates for nanoscale electronics because of their high carrier mobility. We further show that TiSO, ZrSO, and ZrSeO monolayers possess large piezoelectric properties because of the broken inversion symmetry stemmed from the different atomic sizes and electronegativities of the X and Y elements, which are better or comparable to other 2D and bulk piezoelectric materials.

Key design insights and tradeoffs are considered for various parameters including the operating frequency, the transmission depth, the size of the transmitter, the impedance and the aperture efficiency of the miniaturized receiver, and the interface between the receiver and the power recovery chain on the implant. The performance of spherically focused transducers as ultrasonic transmitters is analyzed to study the limits and the tradeoffs. Two optimization methods are presented: \"Focal Peak\" sets the focus of transducers at target depths, and \"Global Maximum\" maximizes the efficiency globally with off-focus operation. The results are also compared to phased array implementations. To investigate the efficiency of implants, miniaturized receivers made from single crystalline piezoelectric material, PMN-PT, are used as they have resonances in the derived optimal carrier frequency range (\u223c1-2 MHz). A methodology to achieve an efficient interface to the power electronics is then provided using an optogenetic stimulator as an example platform. The analytical results are verified through both simulations and measurements. Finally, an example ultrasonic link using a spherical transmitter with a radius of 2\u00a0cm is demonstrated; link efficiencies of 1.93-0.23% are obtained at 6-10\u00a0cm depths with sub-mm receivers for the optogenetic application.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2018-09-21", "authors": ["Ting ChiaChang", "Marcus JWeber", "JayantCharthad", "SpyridonBaltsavias", "AminArbabian"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2871470"}

In this study, polymer and hybrid microcapsules were prepared and used as drug carriers, which are further deposited onto polymer microfiber scaffolds [polycaprolactone (PCL), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), and PHB doping with the conductive polyaniline (PANi) of 2 wt % (PHB-PANi)]. The number of immobilized microcapsules decreased with increase in their \u03b6-potential due to electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged fiber surface, depending on the polymer used for the scaffold's fabrication. Additionally, the immobilization of the capsules in dynamic mechanical conditions at a frequency of 10 Hz resulted in an increase in the number of the capsules on the fibers with increase in the scaffold piezoelectric response in the order PCL < PHB < PHB-PANi, depending on the chemical composition of the capsules. The immobilization of microcapsules loaded with different bioactive molecules onto the scaffold surface enabled multimodal triggering by physical (ultrasound, laser radiation) and biological (enzymatic treatment) stimuli, providing controllable release of the cargo from scaffolds. Importantly, the microcapsules immobilized onto the surface of the scaffolds did not influence the cell growth, viability, and cell proliferation on the scaffolds. Moreover, the attachment of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on the scaffolds revealed that the PHB and PHB-PANi scaffolds promoted adhesion of hMSCs compared to that of the PCL scaffolds. Two bioactive compounds, antibiotic ceftriaxone sodium (CS) and osteogenic factor dexamethasone (DEXA), were chosen to load the microcapsules and demonstrate the antimicrobial properties and osteogenesis of the scaffolds. The modified scaffolds had prolonged release of CS or DEXA, which provided an improved antimicrobial effect, as well as enhanced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of the scaffolds modified with capsules compared to that of individual scaffolds soaked in CS solution or incubated in an osteogenic medium. Thus, the immobilization of microcapsules provides a simple, convenient way to incorporate bioactive compounds onto polymer scaffolds, which makes these multimodal materials suitable for personalized drug therapy and bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2018-09-20", "authors": ["Alexander STimin", "Albert RMuslimov", "Mikhail VZyuzin", "Oleksii OPeltek", "Timofey EKarpov", "Igor SSergeev", "Anna IDotsenko", "Alexander AGoncharenko", "Nikita DYolshin", "ArtemSinelnik", "B\u00e4rbelKrause", "TiloBaumbach", "Maria ASurmeneva", "Roman VChernozem", "Gleb BSukhorukov", "Roman ASurmenev"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.8b09810"}

Both efficient heat transport and superior mechanical properties are of critical significance for high-performance thermal-conductive devices. In this paper, magnetic hexagonal boron nitride (mhBN) with excellent interfacial compatibility is successfully synthesized by dopamine and magnetic co-functionalization, and mhBN-poly(vinylidene fluoride) (mhBN-PVDF) composites with a combination of high thermal conductivity and outstanding mechanical property are achieved due to the integration of excellent interfacial interaction and aligned filler architecture into one material's system. The thermal conductivity increases from 0.35 W/(m K) for the 20 wt % pure BN-PVDF to 0.82 W/(m K) after the dopamine modification and further to 1.43 W/(m K) after alignment. The effective medium approximation model demonstrates that the optimization of mhBN orientation and decrease of thermal resistance are two major factors for the enhancement of thermal conductivity. Moreover, the mhBN-PVDF composites also exhibit excellent tensile strength (168.5 MPa at 15 wt % content) and impact strength (20-30 kJ/m", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2018-09-20", "authors": ["ChunyuDu", "MeiLi", "MinCao", "ShashaSong", "ShichaoFeng", "XipengLi", "HongGuo", "BaoanLi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.8b14154"}
{"title": "PVDF-MWNT interactions control process induced \u03b2-lamellar morphology and orientation in the nanocomposites.", "abstract": "The effect of methylene blue (MB) modified multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) on the nucleation and morphology of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in comparison with the effect of MWNTs was systematically assessed by DSC, 13C NMR, FT-IR, TEM, WAXS and SAXS analysis. TEM analysis of ultra-microtomed samples revealed that MB modification enhanced the dispersibility of MWNTs in PVDF. Further, the nanocomposites were subjected to mechanical rolling and the synergistic effect of processing and fillers on the PVDF morphology (before and after rolling) at different length scales was studied. Both FT-IR and WAXS analyses suggested that mechanical rolling transforms \u03b1-PVDF to \u03b2-PVDF (ca. 88%). TEM and two-dimensional WAXS analyses revealed that the MWNTs and \u03b2-crystallites are oriented preferentially along the rolling direction and the degree of orientation is not influenced by the fillers suggesting that crystallite orientation is fully controlled by mechanical rolling. On the other hand, \u03b2-lamellae showed perpendicular orientation with respect to the rolling direction. Unlike \u03b2-crystallites, the \u03b2-lamellar morphology and orientation are highly governed by the fillers as evident from SAXS analysis. Using MWNTs and the MWNT-MB \u03c0-complex, we demonstrate that the \u03b2-lamellar morphology and degree of orientation are controlled by the extent of interaction of fillers with PVDF. Interestingly, both \u03b2-lamellar morphology and degree of orientation correlate well with the mechanical properties of the rolled PVDF. More specifically, the dynamic storage modulus of the samples in the rolling direction increases with increasing \u03b2-lamellar morphology and degree of orientation. The present work demonstrates that the polymer-filler interaction plays a crucial role in regulating the processed polymer morphology and can be tuned by appropriately modifying the surface of fillers through either covalent or non-covalent interactions.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2018-09-20", "authors": ["Mohan RajMani", "AmanuelGebrekrstos", "GiridharMadras", "PetraP\u00f6tschke", "SuryasarathiBose"], "doi": "10.1039/c8cp03739f"}

The aim of the present study is to assess, with clinical, radiographical, and histological evaluations, the efficacy of piezoelectric devices compared to traditional rotating instruments in the bone harvesting in patients with history of cleft.\nWe have conducted a retrospective analysis on 20 patients with a history of orofacial clefts that were operated on from February 2014 to June 2017. The patients were divided into two groups: Group R in which bone graft was harvested using a burr and Group P in which the bone graft was obtained by a piezoelectric device. After a healing period of 8 months from the grafting procedure, clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed.\nThe use of the piezoelectric devices in bone harvesting allows a slight improvement in the final volume.

In this work, the intelligent surface with electrically triggerable wettability and water/oil adhesion is presented. As a basic material background exhibiting electric field (EF) sensitivity, the piezo-responsive polymethylmethacrylate/polyvinylidenefluoride polymer fibers were used. To expand the available range of water/oil contact angles (CAs) and adhesion, the fibers were grafted with hydrophilic or hydrophobic functional groups using diazonium chemistry. The fiber functionality was evaluated using the static CA and wettability hysteresis measurements (increasing/decreasing drop volume and tilting angles), drops adhesion/repellence and graphite self-cleaning test performed with and without the application of EF. It was found that the proposed method enables tuning the surface wettability in the superhydrophobic/superoleophobic-hydrophilic/oleophilic range and changing of surface properties from low adhesive to high adhesive for water and oil.

{"title": "A Self-Folding Polymer Film Based on Swelling Metal-Organic Frameworks.", "abstract": "Herein, we exploit the well-known swelling behaviour of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to create a self-folding polymer film. Namely, we show that incorporating crystals of the flexible MOF MIL-88A into a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) matrix affords a polymer composite film that undergoes reversible shape transformations upon exposure to polar solvents and vapours. Since the self-folding properties of this film correlate directly with the swelling properties of the MIL-88A crystals, it selectively bends to certain solvents and its degree of folding can be controlled by controlling the relative humidity. Moreover, it shows a shape-memory effect at relative humidity values from 60\u2009% to 90\u2009%. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that these composite films can lift cargo and can be used to assemble 3D structures from 2D patterns.

The work presented here introduces strategies in guided assembly and heterogeneous materials integration as routes to complex, 3D microscale mechanical frameworks that incorporate multiple, independently addressable piezoelectric thin-film actuators for vibratory excitation and precise control.

Herein we design an innovative gas pressure-based biosensing platform for the detection of Kanamycin (Kana) on polyaniline nanowires-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PANI/rGO) framework by using platinum nanozyme-catalyzed gas generation. The signal was amplified by coupling with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) and strand-displacement amplification (SDA). Upon target Kana introduction, the analyte initially triggered a SDA reaction between hairpin DNA1 and hairpin DNA2, and then induced CHA conjugation between magnetic bead-labeled hairpin DNA3 (MB-H3) and platinum nanoparticle-labeled hairpin DNA4 (Pt-H4) to form a three-dimensional network. Numerous platinum nanoparticles (peroxidase-like nanozymes) were carried over with magnetic beads to reduce hydrogen peroxide into oxygen. The as-produced gas compressed PANI/rGO frameworks (modified to polyurethane sponge, used as the piezoelectric materials) in a homemade pressure-tight device, thus causing the increasing current of PANI/rGO sponge thanks to its deformation.

Two experiments were conducted using the PWAS with each of the commercial AE sensors. For each experiment, two AE analyses were performed: (1) the hit-based analysis, (2) the waveform-based analysis. The fatigue loading was synchronized with the AE measurements. This allowed comparing the AE hits due to a particular AE event captured by PWAS and the other sensors. All the sensors showed a very similar pattern of AE hits as observed from the hit-based analysis. The AE waveform-based analysis was used to compare the waveforms and their frequency spectra captured by the three sensors. The commercial PICO showed ringing in the AE signals and showed a weak response in high-frequency region. The commercial S9225 had better signal-to-noise ratio but it also showed a weak response in high-frequency region.

CP6 with a combination of l- and d-\u03b1-amino acids is designed to self-assemble into PNTs with them stacking on top of each other under the constraint of maximizing the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the cyclic peptides. Upon PNT formation, the respective side chains of l- and d-\u03b1-amino acids are aligned in line along the PNTs. The topological arrangement of the anthryl groups being in close proximity in the CP6 PNT is supported by higher photo-excited energy transfer, appearance of the induced Cotton effects, and the promoted photo-dimerization reaction upon PNT formation. AFM observations reveal that PNT bundles with diameters 5-15 nm are dielectric microcrystals having a piezoelectric coefficient of 2-6 pC N-1. Kelvin force microscopy observations show the generation of surface potentials over 100 mV owing to the one-dimensional array of the anthryl groups along PNTs.

We first evaluated the efficacy and reliability of this device for the intraoperative monitoring of eOMNs in two Beagle dogs.

Animal experiments revealed that a 0.4\u00a0mA monopolar electrical stimulation was required to elicit significant responses and that these responses were not inferior to those obtained via the electrooculogram/electromyogram. Significant responses were also detected in preliminary clinical investigations in human patients, following both direct and indirect monopolar electrical stimulation of the oculomotor and abducens nerves, although obtaining responses from the trochlear nerve was difficult.

We measured the sensing signals without any external power, because photoelectric film assists the sensitive operation of the ion channel system.

{"title": "Creating the Coupled Band Gaps in Piezoelectric Composite Plates by Interconnected Electric Impedance.", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the coupled band gaps created by the locking phenomenon between the electric and flexural waves in piezoelectric composite plates. To do that, the distributed piezoelectric materials should be interconnected via a 'global' electric network rather than the respective 'local' impedance. Once the uncoupled electric wave has the same wavelength and opposite group velocity as the uncoupled flexural wave, the desired coupled band gap emerges. The Wave Finite Element Method (WFEM) is used to investigate the evolution of the coupled band gap with respect to propagation direction and electric parameters. Further, the bandwidth and directionality of the coupled band gap are compared with the LR and Bragg gaps. An indicator termed ratio of single wave (RSW) is proposed to determine the effective band gap for a given deformation (electric, flexural, etc.). The features of the coupled band gap are validated by a forced response analysis. We show that the coupled band gap, despite directional, can be much wider than the LR gap with the same overall inductance.

Direct current electrical stimulation has shown success clinically to significantly improve bone healing in these difficult-to-fuse populations. Energy harvesting with piezoelectric material has gained popularity in the last decade, but is challenging at low frequencies due to material properties that limit total power generation at these frequencies. Stacked generators have been used to increase power generation at lower voltage levels but have not been widely explored as a load-bearing biomaterial to provide DC stimulation. To match structural compliance levels and increase efficiency of power generation at low frequencies, the effect of compliant layers between piezoelectric discs was investigated. Compliant Layer Adaptive Composite Stacks (CLACS) were manufactured using five PZT discs connected electrically in parallel and stacked mechanically in series with a layer of low modulus epoxy between each disc. The stacks were encapsulated, keeping PZT and overall volume constant. Each stack was electromechanically tested by varying load, frequency, and resistance. As compliant layer thickness increased, power generation increased significantly across all loads, frequencies, and resistances measured. As expected, increase in frequency significantly increased power output for all groups. Similarly, an increase applied peak-to-peak mechanical load also significantly increased power output. The novel use of CLACS for power generation under load and frequencies experienced by typical orthopedic implants could provide an effective method to harvest energy and provide power without the use of a battery in multiple low frequency applications.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2018-09-11", "authors": ["E DKrech", "E SCadel", "R MBarrett", "E AFriis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.08.027\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.08.020\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.01.007\n10.14444/4029\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e31814b1bc0\n10.1109/58.212557\n10.1080/14786430902915412\n10.1136/annrheumdis-2011-200180\n10.1002/jor.1100030414\n10.1002/jor.1100070309\n10.2106/JBJS.D.02625\n10.1002/jbm.b.33365\n10.1089/acm.2007.5270\n10.1016/j.jotr.2017.04.001\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.11.033\n10.1109/RBME.2018.2799189\n10.1063/1.4900845\n10.3389/fendo.2018.00006\n10.1002/jbm.820140308\n10.1002/jbm.820150114\n10.1109/TMECH.2005.844704\n10.1097/BOT.0b013e31829e6dd0\n10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00248-7\n10.1002/jor.1100060305\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/1/017002\n10.1002/jbm.a.34750\n10.1002/jor.21417\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.04.019"}

Here we describe solid-phase assays, in which pure phospholipids are immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes, PVDF membranes, or microtiter plates.

{"title": "Shear Mode Bulk Acoustic Viscosity Sensor for Blood Coagulation Monitoring in Oral Anticoagulant Therapy.", "abstract": "Frequent monitoring of blood coagulation status is essential for patients receiving treatment with some oral anticoagulant agents. In this paper, we present a microelectromechanical film bulk acoustic resonator for the measurement of blood coagulation parameters. The resonator was made of an aluminum nitride piezoelectric film and operated in thickness shear resonance mode with a frequency of about 2 GHz. The resonant frequency showed a linear relationship with the viscosity of the environmental liquid over the wide range of 1-25 cP, falling within the physiological range of human blood. The coagulation process of human blood was monitored by following the frequency downshift due to the viscosity change. Therefore, the frequency response was used to determine quantitatively three clinically significant parameters being the enzymatic cascade time, the coagulation time and the clot degree. As a practical demonstration, the proposed micro-resonator was applied to monitor coagulation for one month in a patient taking the oral anticoagulant, warfarin, daily. The results measured by the resonator were consistent with those of the standard coagulometer. As a result of the excellent potential for integration, miniaturization and the availability of direct digital signals, the shear mode film bulk acoustic resonator has promising application for clinical and personal coagulation monitoring.", "journal": "Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology", "date": "2018-09-08", "authors": ["ShurenSong", "DaChen", "HongfeiWang", "QiuquanGuo", "WangliYu"], "doi": "10.1166/jnn.2018.16425"}

{"title": "Application of PZT Technology and Clustering Algorithm for Debonding Detection of Steel-UHPC Composite Slabs.", "abstract": "A lightweight composite bridge deck system composed of steel orthotropic deck stiffened with thin Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) layer has been proposed to eliminate fatigue cracks in orthotropic steel decks. The debonding between steel deck and UHPC layer may be introduced during construction and operation phases, which could cause adverse consequences, such as crack-induced water invasion and distinct reduction of the shear resistance. The piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-based technologies are used to detect interfacial debonding defects between the steel deck and the UHPC layer. Both impedance analysis and wave propagation method are employed to extract debonding features of the steel-UHPC composite slab with debonding defect in different sizes and thicknesses. Experimental tests are performed on two steel-UHPC composite slabs and a conventional steel-concrete composite deck. Additionally, an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-k-means clustering algorithm is adopted to obtain debonding patterns based on the feature data set. The laboratory tests demonstrate that the proposed approach provides an effective way to detect interfacial debonding of steel-UHPC composite deck.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-09-08", "authors": ["BanfuYan", "QiqiZou", "YouDong", "XudongShao"], "doi": "10.3390/s18092953\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000348\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000905\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.02.037\n10.1088/0964-1726/7/5/004\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/4/009\n10.1177/1045389X9500600117\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/5/017\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.019\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.06.004\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.09.006\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095003\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/318\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/003\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.06.163\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.05.016\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.07.029\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/035008\n10.12989/sss.2005.1.4.339\n10.1177/1045389X12437888\n10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2000)6:4(153)\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/3/301\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2008.06.007\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085021\n10.1016/j.eswa.2010.11.082\n10.1016/j.asoc.2009.07.001\n10.1016/j.patcog.2008.05.018"}

The piezoelectric transducer converts the RF signal to acoustic waves in the optical fiber over a region including a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The elastic waves in the fiber modulates the FBG geometry and hence the reflected light in the optical fiber. Since the coil is much smaller than the RF wavelength and the signal is transmitted on the dielectric optical fiber, the sensor effectively reduces RF induced heating risk. Proof of concept prototypes of the sensor are implemented using commercially available piezoelectric transducers and optical fibers with FBGs. The prototypes are characterized in a 1.5 T MRI system in comparison with an active tracking marker.\nAcousto-optical sensor shows linear response with flip angle and it can be used to detect signals from multiple coils for potential orientation detection. It has been successfully used to detect the position of a tacking coil in phantom in an imaging experiment.\nAcousto-optical sensing is demonstrated for tracking catheters during interventional MRI.

We describe the filler system in dielectric nanocomposites with a small loading of Au nanorods [NRs] to elucidate the mechanism of interfacial crystallization behavior including the crystallization kinetics, and crystalline morphology and structure, and to investigate the intrinsic causes for concurrent great improvements in the dielectric constant and energy density in the nanocomposite system. Remarkly, at high crystallization temperature, the addition of Au NRs, which are used as heterogeneous nucleators, can reduce the nucleation barrier, resulting in accelerating the crystallization rate. However, the crystallization rate slows down at low temperatures because the addition of Au NRs limited the mobility of poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-CTFE)] chains, and thus enhanced the diffusion barrier. Furthermore, the addition of NRs has a huge impact on the crystalline morphology and structure which changes from large paraelectric \u03b1-phase spherulites with TGTG' conformations into minor ferroelectric \u03b3-phase spherulites with T3GT3G' conformations, and also produces more exogenous interfaces between the lamellar crystals and amorphous regions, resulting in a higher dielectric constant and higher electric energy density in P(VDF-CTFE)/Au NRs nanocomposites.

{"title": "Electroactive biomaterial surface engineering effects on muscle cells differentiation.", "abstract": "Even though skeletal muscle cells can naturally regenerate as a response to insignificant tissue damages, more severe injuries can cause irreversible loss of muscle cells mass and/or function. Until now, cell therapies are not a good approach to treat those injuries. Biomaterials such as poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, can improve muscle regeneration by presenting physical cues to muscle cells that mimic the natural regeneration environment. In this way, the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of PVDF offer new opportunities for skeletal muscle tissue engineering once the piezoelectricity is an electromechanical effect that can be used to provide electrical signals to the cells, upon mechanical solicitations, similar to the ones found in several body tissues. Thus, previous to dynamic experiments, it is important to determine how the surface properties of the material, both in terms of the poling state (positive or negative net surface charge) and of the morphology (films or fibers) influence myoblast differentiation. It was observed that PVDF promotes myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells as evidenced by quantitative analysis of myotube fusion, maturation index, length, diameter and number. Charged surfaces improve the fusion of muscle cells into differentiated myotubes, as demonstrated by fusion and maturation index values higher than the control samples. Finally, the use of random and oriented \u03b2-PVDF electrospun fibers scaffolds has revealed differences in cell morphology. Contrary to the randomly oriented fibers, oriented PVDF electrospun fibers have promoted the alignment of the cells. It is thus demonstrated that the use of this electroactive polymer represents a suitable approach for the development of electroactive microenvironments for effective muscle tissue engineering.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

This allows one to avoid unwanted corrections to the elastic and electric fields in the case of nonlinear modelling of piezoelectric materials, e.g. for piezoelectric heterostructures such as quantum wells or dots. A general transformation formula for second-order piezoelectric coefficients (elastostriction) is derived. As an example, specific transformation formulae for two common crystallographic classes, namely {\\bar 4}3m and 6mm, are presented. The piezoelectric coefficients for GaN and GaAs crystals, as representative cases of these crystal classes, are recalculated and their dependence on the strain measure is demonstrated.

{"title": "Pulse wave response characteristics for thickness and hardness of the cover layer in pulse sensors to measure radial artery pulse.", "abstract": "Piezo-resistive pressure sensors are widely used for measuring pulse waves of the radial artery. Pulse sensors are generally fabricated with a cover layer because pressure sensors without a cover layer are fragile when they come into direct contact with the skin near the radial artery. However, no study has evaluated the dynamic pulse wave response of pulse sensors depending on the thickness and hardness of the cover layer. This study analyzed the dynamic pulse wave response according to the thickness and hardness of the cover layer and suggests an appropriate thickness and hardness for the design of pulse sensors with semiconductor device-based pressure sensors.\nPulse sensors with 6 different cover layers with various thicknesses (0.8\u00a0mm, 1\u00a0mm, 2\u00a0mm) and hardnesses (Shore type A; 30, 43, 49, 71) were fabricated. Experiments for evaluating the dynamic pulse responses of the fabricated sensors were performed using a pulse simulator to transmit the same pulse wave to each of the sensors. To evaluate the dynamic responses of the fabricated pulse sensors, experiments with the pulse sensors were conducted using a simulator that artificially generated a constant pulse wave. The pulse wave simulator consisted of a motorized cam device that generated the artificial radial pulse waveform by adjusting the stroke of the cylindrical air pump and an air tube that conveyed the pulse to the artificial wrist.\nThe amplitude of the measured pulse pressure decreased with increasing thickness and hardness of the cover layer. Normalized waveform analysis showed that the thickness rather than the hardness of the cover layer contributed more to waveform distortion. Analysis of the channel distribution of the pulse sensor with respect to the applied constant dynamic pressure showed that the material of the cover layer had a large effect.\nIn this study, in-line array pulse sensors with various cover layers were fabricated, the dynamic pulse wave responses according to the thickness and the hardness of the cover layer were analyzed, and an appropriate thickness and hardness for the cover layer were suggested.

Forced vibrations of the cylinders with specified potentials on the electroded surfaces and displacement or stress on the boundaries are considered. The exact, linearized, axisymmetric governing equations are used in the analysis. Three series solutions are used, and each term in each series is an exact solution to the exact governing equations of motion. The terms in the series expressions for components of displacement, stress, electric potential, and electrical displacement are products of Bessel and sinusoidal functions and are orthogonal to other terms. Complete sets of functions in the radial and axial directions are formed by terms in the first series and the other two, respectively. It is, therefore, possible to satisfy arbitrary boundary conditions on all surfaces of the hollow piezoelectric cylinder. Numerical results are presented for hollow piezoelectric cylinders of various dimensions.

This requires hydrophones calibrated to a traceable standard. Currently, the upper calibration frequency range available to the user community is limited to 60\u2009MHz. However, high frequencies are increasingly being used for both imaging and therapy necessitating calibration frequencies up to 100 MHz. The precise calibration of hydrophones requires a source of high amplitude, broadband, quasi-planar, and stable ultrasound fields. There are challenges to using conventional piezoelectric sources, and laser generated ultrasound sources offer a promising solution. In this study, various nanocomposites consisting of a bulk polymer matrix and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were fabricated and tested using pulsed laser of a few nanoseconds for their suitability as a source for high frequency calibration of hydrophones. The pressure amplitude and bandwidths were measured using a broadband hydrophone from 27 different nanocomposite sources. The effect of nonlinear propagation of high amplitude laser generated ultrasound on bandwidth and the effect of bandlimited sensitivity response on the deconvolved pressure waveform were numerically investigated.

Negatively-charged electrospun polyacrylic acid (PAA) nanofibers were deposited on electrospun PVDF nanofibers to form a support layer consisted of PVDF and PAA nanofibers. This resulted to a more hydrophilic support compared to the plain PVDF nanofiber support. The PVDF-PAA nanofiber support then underwent a layer-by-layer deposition of polyethylenimine (PEI) and PAA to form a polyelectrolyte layer on the nanofiber surface prior to interfacial polymerization, which forms the selective polyamide layer of TFC membranes. The resultant PVDF-LbL TFC membrane exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity and porosity, without sacrificing mechanical strength. As a result, it showed high pure water permeability and low structural parameter values of 4.12 L m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2018-08-29", "authors": ["Ralph RollyGonzales", "Myoung JunPark", "LeonardTijing", "Dong SukHan", "SherubPhuntsho", "Ho KyongShon"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes8030070\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.05.048\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.07.049\n10.1021/es1002555\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.11.014\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.030\n10.3390/polym5010303\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)82088-8\n10.1016/S0011-9164(00)86003-8\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.05.025\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.02.013\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.05.037\n10.1016/j.coche.2012.07.004\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2015.04.005\n10.1080/19443994.2012.749246\n10.1016/j.cej.2013.12.078\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.06.053\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.12.066\n10.1039/c3ee23349a\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.08.002\n10.1002/adma.201100510\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.12.031\n10.1021/es304215g\n10.1021/es4037012\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.10.042\n10.1016/j.cej.2014.06.076\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.05.043\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.12.037\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.01.040\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.07.020\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.09.022\n10.1016/j.desal.2007.02.080\n10.1039/C3RA43907K\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.07.021\n10.1163/156856187X00283\n10.1021/nn505318v\n10.1021/acsami.5b09945\n10.1038/srep20142\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.10.022\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.11.026\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.01.046\n10.1039/C6RA18153H\n10.1016/j.desal.2018.07.025\n10.1016/j.seppur.2013.08.021"}

A low frequency sound wave device comprising four piezoelectric vibration-type tactile tranducers enclosed in separate 5-cm diameter circular plates, which generate sinusoidal vibratory stimuli at a frequency of 16-160 Hz, was used in this study. Primary outcome measure was pain sensation measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (P-VAS). The secondary outcome measures were pain-related disability measured using the pain disability index (PDI) and quality of life measured using the SF-12.\nAt week 12, significant reductions in pain sensation and pain-related disability were observed, with mean reductions of 3.5 points in P-VAS and 13.5 points in the PDI scores. Sixty-five percent of the participants had a reduction of at least 3 points on the P-VAS score, while 52% participants showed a decrease of at least 10 points in the PDI score. Significant improvement was observed in the SF-12 physical composite score but not the mental composite score.\nThe preliminary findings showed that passive application of low frequency sound wave stimulation therapy through both hands and feet was effective in alleviating pain and improving functional ability in patients with chronic back pain.", "journal": "Journal of back and musculoskeletal rehabilitation", "date": "2018-08-29", "authors": ["EinlyLim", "RenlyLim", "AnwarSuhaimi", "Bee TingChan", "Ahmad Khairi AbdulWahab"], "doi": "10.3233/BMR-171042"}

{"title": "Dynamics of Thin-film Piezoelectric Microactuators with Large Vertical Stroke Subject to Multi-axis Coupling and Fabrication Asymmetries.", "abstract": "The high performance and small size of MEMS based scanners has allowed various optical imaging techniques to be realized in a small form factor. Many such devices are resonant scanners, and thus their linear and nonlinear dynamic behaviors have been studied in the past. Thin-film piezoelectric materials, in contrast, provide sufficient energy density to achieve both large static displacements and high-frequency resonance, but large deformation can in turn influence dynamic scanner behavior. This paper reports on the influence of very large stroke translation of a piezoelectric vertical actuator on its resonant behavior, which may not be otherwise explained fully by common causes of resonance shift such as beam stiffening or nonlinear forcing. To examine the change of structural compliance over the course of scanner motion, a model has been developed that includes internal forces from residual stress and the resultant additional multi-axis coupling among actuator leg structures. Like some preceding vertical scanning micro-actuators, the scanner of this work has four legs, with each leg featuring four serially connected thin-film PZT unimorphs that allow the scanner to generate larger than 400\u03bcm of vertical displacement at 14V", "journal": "Journal of micromechanics and microengineering : structures, devices, and systems", "date": "2018-08-28", "authors": ["JongsooChoi", "ThomasWang", "KennOldham"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6439/aa9d3c"}
{"title": "Pathological missorting of endogenous MAPT/Tau in neurons caused by failure of protein degradation systems.", "abstract": "Missorting of MAPT/Tau represents one of the early signs of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease. The triggers for this are still a matter of debate. Here we investigated the sorting mechanisms of endogenous MAPT in mature primary neurons using microfluidic chambers (MFCs) where cell compartments can be observed separately. Blocking protein degradation pathways with proteasomal or autophagy inhibitors dramatically increased the missorting of MAPT in dendrites on the neuritic side, suggesting that degradation of MAPT in dendrites is a major determinant for the physiological axonal distribution of MAPT. Such missorted dendritic MAPT differed in its phosphorylation pattern from axonal MAPT. By contrast, enhancing autophagy or proteasomal pathways strongly reduced MAPT missorting, thereby confirming the role of protein degradation pathways in the polar distribution of MAPT. Dendritic missorting of MAPT by blocking protein degradation resulted in the loss of spines but not in overall cell toxicity. Inhibition of local protein synthesis in dendrites eliminated the missorting of MAPT, indicating that the accumulation of dendritic MAPT is locally generated. In support of this, a substantial fraction of Mapt/Tau mRNA was detected in dendrites. Taken together, our results indicate that the autophagy and proteasomal pathways play important roles in fine-tuning dendritic MAPT levels and thereby prevent synaptic toxicity caused by MAPT accumulation.

While most soft materials are not all that smart relying on power input of some kind for continuous response, we conceptualize a self-locked thermo-mechano feedback for autonomous motility and energy generation functions. Here, the low-grade heat usually dismissed as 'not useful' is used to fuel a soft thermo-mechano-electrical system to perform perpetual and untethered multimodal locomotions. The innately resilient locomotion synchronizes self-governed and auto-sustained temperature fluctuations and mechanical mobility without external stimulus change, enabling simultaneous harvesting of thermo-mechanical energy at the pyro/piezoelectric mechanistic intersection. The untethered soft material showcases deterministic motions (translational oscillation, directional rolling, and clockwise/anticlockwise rotation), rapid transitions and dynamic responses without needing power input, on the contrary extracting power from ambient.

{"title": "Conformational analysis of replica exchange MD: Temperature-dependent Markov networks for FF amyloid peptides.", "abstract": "Recent molecular modeling methods using Markovian descriptions of conformational states of biomolecular systems have led to powerful analysis frameworks that can accurately describe their complex dynamical behavior. In conjunction with enhanced sampling methods, such as replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), these frameworks allow the systematic and accurate extraction of transition probabilities between the corresponding states, in the case of Markov state models, and of statistically-optimized transition rates, in the case of the corresponding coarse master equations. However, applying automatically such methods to large molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with explicit water molecules, remains limited both by the initial ability to identify good candidates for the underlying Markovian states and by the necessity to do so using good collective variables as reaction coordinates that allow the correct counting of inter-state transitions at various lag times. Here, we show that, in cases when representative molecular conformations can be identified for the corresponding Markovian states, and thus their corresponding collective evolution of atomic positions can be calculated along MD trajectories, one can use them to build a new type of simple collective variable, which can be particularly useful in both the correct state assignment and in the subsequent accurate counting of inter-state transition probabilities. In the case of the ubiquitously used root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, we introduce the relative RMSD (RelRMSD) measure as a good reaction coordinate candidate. We apply this method to the analysis of REMD trajectories of amyloid-forming diphenylalanine (FF) peptides-a system with important nanotechnology and biomedical applications due to its self-assembling and piezoelectric properties-illustrating the use of RelRMSD in extracting its temperature-dependent intrinsic kinetics, without ", "journal": "The Journal of chemical physics", "date": "2018-08-24", "authors": ["BrajeshNarayan", "ColmHerbert", "YeYuan", "Brian JRodriguez", "Bernard RBrooks", "Nicolae-ViorelBuchete"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5027580\n10.1109/n-ssc.2006.4785860\n10.1126/science.1208351\n10.1126/science.290.5498.1903\n10.1021/jacs.7b12191\n10.1007/s00232-015-9802-0\n10.1073/pnas.1201811109\n10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001\n10.1021/jp0761665\n10.1103/physrevx.7.031060\n10.1016/s0009-2614(99)01123-9\n10.1073/pnas.042496899\n10.1063/1.4896513\n10.1063/1.462133\n10.1209/0295-5075/19/6/002\n10.1002/jcc.24430\n10.1103/physreve.77.030902\n10.1021/ja075346p\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.052\n10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b02654\n10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00372\n10.1002/pro.3064\n10.1021/ja200834s\n10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00518\n10.1063/1.5004774\n10.1103/physrevlett.96.238102\n10.1073/pnas.92.19.8926\n10.1063/1.4979058\n10.1021/jp508375q\n10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01004\n10.1137/110858616\n10.1021/ct4009156\n10.1021/ct300878a\n10.1063/1.4811489\n10.1107/s0567739476001873\n10.1002/jcc.20110\n10.1021/nn901327v\n10.1016/j.bpc.2014.08.009\n10.1021/acsami.5b01251\n10.1063/1.3249608\n10.1063/1.4904890\n10.1063/1.4765060\n10.1016/s0022-5193(74)80066-4\n10.1093/nar/gkt383\n10.1073/pnas.1311599110\n10.1002/jcc.20291\n10.1021/ct700301q\n10.1080/00268978800101881\n10.1063/1.446740\n10.1002/jcc.21287\n10.1021/ct300400x\n10.1063/1.445869\n10.1039/b716554d\n10.1016/0263-7855(96)00018-5\n10.1007/bf01012300\n10.1006/jcph.1999.6231\n10.1006/jmbi.2001.4655\n10.1039/b203534k\n10.1021/jp037422q\n10.1021/jp048540w\n10.1021/jp046448u\n10.1137/06065146x\n10.1021/jp900445t\n10.1021/ct200281d\n10.1063/1.4776215\n10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.09.013\n10.1063/1.4959168\n10.1063/1.448118"}

Damages in stator insulation will gradually lead to the failure and breakdown of generator. Due to the advantages of Lamb waves in Structural health monitoring (SHM), in this study, a distributed piezoelectric (PZT) sensor system and hybrid features of the Lamb waves are introduced to identify stator insulation damage of large generator. A hierarchical probability damage-imaging (PDI) algorithm is proposed to tackle the material inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the stator insulation. The proposed method includes three steps: global detection using correlation coefficients, local detection using Time of flight (ToF) along with the amplitude of damage-scattered Lamb wave, and final images fusion. Wavelet Transform was used to extract the ToF of Lamb wave in terms of the time-frequency domain. Finite Element Modeling (FEM) simulation and experimental work were carried out to identify four typical stator insulation damages for validation, including inner void, inner delamination, puncture, and crack.

X-ray analysis suggests that CNT can act as a template and direct the chain orientation of P(VDF-TrFE) crystals. In the presence of CNTs, the molecular chain axis ( c axis) of the \u03b2-phase crystal is oriented parallel to the long axis of CNTs. Moreover, we find that this templating effect did not cause a polymorph transition. For P(VDF-TrFE)/CNT composites, the crystallinity of P(VDF-TrFE) is slightly decreased. The orientation of the c axis induced by the templating effect of CNTs has a significant impact on the ferroelectric behavior of P(VDF-TrFE).

However, binders, as an important component of energy-storage devices, are yet to receive similar attention. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been the dominant binder in the battery industry for decades despite several well-recognized drawbacks, i.e., limited binding strength due to the lack of chemical bonds with electroactive materials, insufficient mechanical properties, and low electronic and lithium-ion conductivities. The limited binding function cannot meet inherent demands of emerging electrode materials with high capacities such as silicon anodes and sulfur cathodes. To address these concerns, in this review we divide the binding between active materials and binders into two major mechanisms: mechanical interlocking and interfacial binding forces. We review existing and emerging binders, binding technology used in energy-storage devices (including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors), and state-of-the-art mechanical characterization and computational methods for binder research. Finally, we propose prospective next-generation binders for energy-storage devices from the molecular level to the macro level.

However, the disadvantages of conventional orthodontics are the time consumed for the treatment (18-24 months), root resorption, and formation of fenestrations and dehiscence. Periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO) is a surgical technique resulting in increased alveolar bone width, shorter treatment time, increase posttreatment stability, and decrease amount of apical root resorption.\nThe aim of the study is to compare the treatment time, root resorption, bone density, and presence/absence of fenestrations and dehiscence after PAOO with surgical bur and PAOO with piezocision.\nForty participants with bimaxillary protrusion undergoing orthodontic treatment were randomly selected and divided into two groups. Group I: 20 participants selected for PAOO with surgical bur and Group II: 20 participants selected for PAOO with piezocision. Patients were recalled at baseline 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and evaluated for treatment time and bone density, root resorption, and detection of fenestration and dehiscence using cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT).\nParticipants in Group I had less treatment time compared to Group II. Rate of retraction was 7.07 mm/20.81 weeks and 5.99 mm/28.48 weeks in Group I and Group II, respectively. CBCT showed a statistically significant increase in bone density in both groups, 12 months after the surgery. Root resorption was negligible in Group I (0.34 mm) and in Group II (0.51 mm).

In the Mach-Zehnder interferometry system we established, the measurement and reference arms are tagged with sharp negative pulses caused by the pulsed ultrasound passing through them. The difference in optical path between the two parallel beams is twice the flight distance of the ultrasonic waves. The span between the two negative pulses reflects the time interval. At the same time, the distance between the two arms can be measured precisely using the femtosecond laser interferometry. Consequently, the time interval and the distance can be used to measure the sound velocity. The experimental results show that, the uncertainty of the sound speed measurement can achieve 0.03m/s@1482m/s in pure water and 0.029m/s@1527m/s in seawater, respectively, compared with the commercial sound velocity profiler (SVP).

In this work, fluorescence excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor framework-clustering analysis was used to investigate the membrane fouling during the filtration process of humic acid (HA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution by polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Interestingly, the interaction between BSA and HA in the membrane fouling process was observed, and was further confirmed by infrared microspectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopic analysis. In addition, the HA-induced membrane fouling was observed to be initially relieved, but became aggravated when a certain amount of BSA was added. Furthermore, with such an integrated approach, the OH groups in HA and amide bands in BSA were found to be mainly responsible for the membrane fouling and the HA-BSA interaction was mainly caused by the encapsulation of BSA with HA. This work develops a new method for probing membrane fouling and demonstrates the interaction between membrane foulants and its roles in membrane fouling process.

Our results reveal a major mechanism to resolve one important but largely unresolved issue: the experimentally measured flexoelectric effect is typically orders of magnitude larger than the theoretically predicted value in ferroelectrics.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2018-08-18", "authors": ["XiaotongZhang", "QiPan", "DongxiaTian", "WanfengZhou", "PanChen", "HaifengZhang", "BaojinChu"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.057602"}

Te is multifunctional, e.g., semiconducting, photoconductive, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, etc., for applications in electronics, sensors, optoelectronics, and energy devices.

Much less is known about 2D Te nanostructures, their processing schemes, and their material properties. This review focuses on the synthesis and morphology control of emerging 2D tellurene and summarizes the latest developments in understanding the fundamental properties of monolayer and few-layer tellurene, as well as the recent advances in demonstrating prototypical tellurene devices.

Moreover, the control bandwidth is also reduced by the nonlinearity. In this paper, we fabricated a three-unit pint-sized unimorph DM with strain gauges integrated on the actuators as a feedback layer for the first time. An experimental platform was built and utilized to test each electrode's strain signal. Testing results show that, under quasi-static condition, the hysteresis curve of the mirror's central displacement is corrected and the hysteresis rate could be reduced from 11% to less than 2% by adopting the strain feedback signal. More specifically, the DM's initial surface, Zernike defocus, together with spherical aberration can also be corrected by this method, and the correction accuracy is improved more than 20% compared to the open-loop state. By introducing a closed-loop control the gaps of the DMs under open loop are supplied. This demonstrates that adding a strain feedback layer is promising to enhance the performance of a unimorph DM.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2018-08-18", "authors": ["ZhanbinFan", "YifanDai", "ChaoliangGuan", "GuipengTie", "ChaoQi", "YaoyuZhong"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.57.006102"}

Combining a PZT and optical fiber features, a theoretical FFTS modeling is established. We systematically deduced the main causes of spectral errors and the factors of the instrumental resolution, then designed a new FFTS system and provided real-time compensation methods for spectral errors. We creatively employed two Mach-Zehnder interferometers by winding the sensing arms of the two on the same PZT cylinder to realize the dual optical path experiencing the same and simultaneous phase modulation. A processing circuit is designed to achieve selective sampling of the test interferogram, avoiding the spectral artifacts generated by the PZT phase discontinuities. The narrow line width of the reference spectrum is obtained at the same time for real-time calibration of spectral shift resulting from dispersion and other phase errors. By the comparison of the original interferogram and spectrum with those after compensation, the experiments validated that the system design could effectively compensate for the spectral errors caused by PZT and optical fiber physical limitations.

{"title": "Characterization of an amplified piezoelectric actuator for multiple-reference optical coherence tomography.", "abstract": "The characterization of an amplified piezoelectric actuator (APA) as a new axial scanning method for multiple-reference optical coherence tomography (MR-OCT) is described. MR-OCT is a compact optical imaging device based on a recirculating reference-arm-scanning optical delay using a partial mirror that can enhance the imaging depth range by more than 10 times the reference mirror's scanning amplitude. The scanning amplitude of the used APA was varied between 30\u00a0\u03bcm and 250\u00a0\u03bcm, depending on the scanning frequency of between 0.8\u00a0kHz and 1.2\u00a0kHz. A silver-coated miniature mirror was attached to the APA via ultraviolet-cured optical adhesive, and the light source was a super-luminescent diode with 1310\u00a0nm center wavelength and 56\u00a0nm bandwidth. The sensitivity was measured with and without the partial mirror in the reference delay line as a function of scan speed, frequency, and range, therefore providing results for MR-OCT and TD-OCT modes. It was found that the APA provides more than twice the mechanical scanning range compared to other opto-mechanic actuators, but results indicate degradation of signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity at larger imaging depths. In conjunction with MR-OCT, the scan range of maximum 200\u00a0\u03bcm can be enhanced up to 1-1.5\u00a0mm by using a reduced amount of orders of reflections, which could be of interest to increase sensitivity in the future.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2018-08-18", "authors": ["SeanO'Gorman", "KaiNeuhaus", "SergeyAlexandrov", "JoshHogan", "CarolWilson", "PaulMcNamara", "MartinLeahy"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.57.00E142"}

Inspired by the facilitated molecular transports by the potentials, an enhanced drug release strategy driven by mechanical disturbances that widely exist in medical treatment processes is proposed. This strategy is enabled by a functional material comprised of multilayers of dendrimers as the drug reservoir, which are built on a piezoelectric-dielectric flexible film with reduced graphene oxide fillers. The generated voltages are higher and last longer than that in regular piezoelectric films. Photochemical crosslinking leads to a stable drug matrix which is even sustained in electric fields and high ionic strengths. The device enhances releases of positively, negatively, and zwitterionically charged molecules in response to mechanical stimuli and supports high cell viabilities. An illustrative application is demonstrated by preparing the material on the surface of a gastric lavage tube. The results show that the release of antiemetic drug increased by 200% within 60 min in response to forces mimicking human swallowing.

Using an ovine animal model, the magnitude of valvular perturbations are first measured using an array of sonomicrometry crystals implanted around the tricuspid valve. These measurements were then used to estimate the levels of electrical energy that could be harvested using a simplified piezoelectric suture model. These results were revalidated across seven different animals, before and after valvular regurgitation was induced. Our study shows that power harvested from different annular planes of the tricuspid valve (before and after regurgitation) could range from nano-watts to milli-watts, with the maximum power harvested from the leaflet plane.

Such a dynamically induced patterning lattice is shown to allow for the active positioning of the neurons and subsequent guided neurite outgrowth, thus finally overcoming the limitations of static approaches. After thorough characterization of the resulting tunable potential landscape, we successfully demonstrate cell adhesion and even growth of the such positioned cells within the well-defined pressure nodes. We demonstrate neuron growth at predetermined positions and observe a subsequent neurite outgrowth, even being correlated with the artificial potential landscape.

However, for small excitations, the cantilever may not be able to overcome the magnetic repulsive force but vibrate at one of its two equilibrium positions with reduced amplitude. This work introduces a method of increasing the range of excitations over which the operation remains bistable. This is achieved by spring loading one of the magnets, previously on a fixed support, allowing motion in one dimension only, toward and away from the cantilever in the horizontal plane. Configured so, as the cantilever moves toward this magnet, the repulsion due to the cantilever-mounted magnet pushes the spring-loaded magnet away, increasing distance, and thus, reducing magnetic force between them, required to be overcome by external excitations for bistable operation. Similarly, as the cantilever moves away, the spring pushes the magnet closer to the cantilever-mounted magnet, increasing vibration amplitude. Thus, the spring introduces a negative feedback which favors bistable operation over an increased range of excitations. This completely mechanical method requires no additional energy cost. Peak power gains of up to 90 and a decrease in excitation voltage of up to 60% were observed over the fixed magnet.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2018-08-15", "authors": ["Kanishka AmanSingh", "MadhavPathak", "Robert JWeber", "RatneshKumar"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2864998"}

{"title": "Wave Electromechanical Coupling Factor for the Guided Waves in Piezoelectric Composites.", "abstract": "A novel metrics termed the 'wave electromechanical coupling factor' (WEMCF) is proposed in this paper, to quantify the coupling strength between the mechanical and electric fields during the passage of a wave in piezoelectric composites. Two definitions of WEMCF are proposed, leading to a frequency formula and two energy formulas for the calculation of such a factor. The frequency formula is naturally consistent with the conventional modal electromechanical coupling factor (MEMCF) but the implementation is difficult. The energy formulas do not need the complicated wave matching required in the frequency formula, therefore are suitable for computing. We demonstrated that the WEMCF based on the energy formula is consistent with the MEMCF, provided that an appropriate indicator is chosen for the electric energy. In this way, both the theoretical closure and the computational feasibility are achieved. A numerical tool based on the wave and finite element method (WFEM) is developed to implement the energy formulas, and it allows the calculation of WEMCF for complex one-dimensional piezoelectric composites. A reduced model is proposed to accelerate the computing of the wave modes and the energies. The analytical findings and the reduced model are numerically validated against two piezoelectric composites with different complexity. Eventually an application is given, concerning the use of the shunted piezoelectric composite for vibration isolation. A strong correlation among the WEMCF, the geometric parameters and the energy transmission loss are observed. These results confirm that the proposed WEMCF captures the physics of the electromechanical coupling phenomenon associated with the guided waves, and can be used to understand, evaluate and design the piezoelectric composites for a variety of applications.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-08-15", "authors": ["YuFan", "ManuelCollet", "MohamedIchchou", "OlivierBareille", "LinLi"], "doi": "10.3390/ma11081406\n10.1063/1.2188588\n10.1063/1.3258496\n10.1063/1.3067231\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/1/015008\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/12/125003\n10.1016/j.jsv.2012.03.002\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.07.008\n10.1006/jsvi.1994.1150\n10.1016/j.jsv.2005.06.030\n10.1177/1045389X08097902\n10.1177/1045389X14536006\n10.1016/j.jsv.2012.11.005\n10.1016/j.jsv.2014.10.026\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2011.11.005\n10.1002/stc.203\n10.1177/146442070421800204\n10.3390/ma10010071\n10.3390/ma10111325\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.08.013\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.05.182\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/055032\n10.1109/58.393106\n10.1016/S0022-460X(75)80228-8\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2017.11.015\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.05.014\n10.1016/j.jsv.2008.05.026\n10.1142/S1758825115500180\n10.1007/s00466-014-1033-1\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.06.005\n10.1016/j.cja.2016.12.011\n10.1016/S0045-7949(99)00151-0\n10.1016/0022-460X(73)90064-3"}

{"title": "Bionic Single-Electrode Electronic Skin Unit Based on Piezoelectric Nanogenerator.", "abstract": "Moravec's paradox shows that low-level sensorimotor skills are more difficult than high-level reasoning in artificial intelligence and robotics. So simplifying every sensing unit on electronic skin is critical for endowing intelligent robots with tactile and temperature sense. The human nervous system is characterized by efficient single-electrode signal transmission, ensuring the efficiency and reliability of information transmission under big data conditions. In this work, we report a sensor based on a single-electrode piezoelectric nanogenerator (SPENG) by electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers that can realize steady-state sensing of pressure integrating cold/heat sensing on a single unit. Piezoelectric signals appear as square wave signals, and the thermal-sensing signals appear as pulse signals. Therefore, the two signals can be acquired by a single unit simultaneously. The SPENG overcomes the shortcoming of electronic skins based on a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (STENG), which can sense only dynamic movement and cannot sense temperature variations. The new sensor configuration uses a capacitor instead of the STENG's ground wire as a potential reference, allowing it to be used for truly autonomous robots.

For the purpose of visualizing specific structures or measuring functional responses of micron-sized biological samples, a higher frequency ultrasound is needed to obtain a decent spatial resolution while it lowers the signal-to-noise ratio, the difference in decibels between the signal level and the background noise level, due to the higher attenuation coefficient. In order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, conventional approach was to increase the transmit voltage level. However, it may cause damaging the extremely thin piezoelectric material in the ultrahigh frequency range. In this paper, we present a novel design of ultrahigh frequency (\u2264600 MHz) frontend system capable of performing pseudo Golay coded excitation by configuring four independently operating pulse generators in parallel and the consecutive delayed transmission from each channel.

{"title": "Ultrasound visualization of sacrocolpopexy polyvinylidene fluoride meshes containing paramagnetic Fe particles compared with polypropylene mesh.", "abstract": "Paramagnetic Fe particles can be added during synthetic mesh production to allow visibility on magnetic resonance imaging. Our aim was to evaluate whether transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) allows visualization, measurement, and characterization of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF mesh) containing Fe particles compared with regular polypropylene (PP) meshes used for sacrocolpopexy.\nWomen up to 1.5\u00a0years after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy who were implanted with a PP or PVDF mesh underwent clinical examination and 2D, 3D, and 4D TPUS. Acquired volumes were analyzed offline for mesh position at rest and maximal Valsalva and for mesh dimensions and characteristics, with the operator blinded to group assignment. The two groups were compared.\nThere were 17 women in the PP and 25 in the PVDF mesh group, without differences in baseline demographics. None had significant prolapse, recurrence, symptoms, or complications. On TPUS, mesh was visible in all patients both caudally (perineal) and cranially but was more echogenic in the PVDF mesh group. Mesh length from distal to proximal that was visible on TPUS was longer for PVDF mesh, for both anterior and posterior vaginal arms (all P\u2009<\u20090.05), and for mesh above the vaginal apex (P\u2009=\u20090.002). The inferior aspects of the mesh showed areas of double mesh layers, suggesting folding in 80% of women in both groups, without symptoms.\nPVDF mesh permits clearer visualization and is seen over a longer stretch on TPUS, with longer visible mesh arms. The latter can be due to differences in operative technique, presence of microparticles, implant textile structure, or patient characteristics.", "journal": "International urogynecology journal", "date": "2018-08-08", "authors": ["Vered HEisenberg", "GeertjeCallewaert", "NikhilSindhwani", "SusanneHousmans", "Dominiquevan Schoubroeck", "LiorLowenstein", "JanDeprest"], "doi": "10.1007/s00192-018-3728-x"}

This configuration is well suited for vertically emitting devices, but not for planar photonic circuits because of the poorly controlled orientation of the transition dipoles in the growth plane. Here we show that the quantization axis of gallium arsenide dots can be flipped into the growth plane via moderate in-plane uniaxial stress. By using piezoelectric strain-actuators featuring strain amplification, we study the evolution of the selection rules and excitonic fine structure in a regime, in which quantum confinement can be regarded as a perturbation compared to strain in determining the symmetry-properties of the system.

We evaluated its amphiphobicity via contact angles which were observed by DI water, canola oil and organic solutions as mimicking for oleophobicity. Surface modifications by FGi particles on the surface of membranes was introduced with PDMS binder which brought bifunctionality of amphiphobicity to enhance hydrophobicity and oleophobicity.

In order to use the wrinkling patterns for these applications, it is necessary to precisely control the formation and geometry of the wrinkles. In this paper, we investigate the localized wrinkling of a stiff film/compliant substrate system subjected to a thrust force with a controllable micro-probe. A thin Au film is deposited onto a thick PDMS substrate attached to a glass to form the stiff film/compliant substrate system. And a micro-probe is controlled by a piezoelectric microrobotic system to exert a point force onto the stiff film/compliant substrate to demonstrate the evolution of the localized wrinkles. The experiments show that the film will wrinkle into orthoradial morphology spontaneously when it is deformed in the vertical direction, and then it will wrinkle into arcuate morphology with deformation in the horizontal direction. Since the compressive stress and tensile stress of the film are generated simultaneously, the evolution of the arcuate wrinkles is always accompanied by some radial cracks. The morphological characteristic, formation mechanism and dynamic evolution of the arcuate wrinkles are demonstrated and discussed in detail.", "journal": "The European physical journal.

A piezoelectric microphone was placed inside the exhaust of a conical top spray fluidized bed. Spherical 1000\u202f\u03bcm pellets were coated while recording acoustic emissions. Fluidization air temperature was adjusted between trials as a controlled variable to determine if pellet drying rate could be extracted from the data. During each trial, pellets became damp as the coating solution was applied. Drying stages were used to remove moisture whereby pellet fluidization continued without spraying. The moving standard deviation of the acoustic emissions increased by approximately 40\u202fmV during each 2-min coating stage. The emissions then decreased during drying. This decrease was at a rate proportional to pellet drying independently measured at each controlled temperature. The overall coating-drying emissions profile was similar for trials using either sugar or Acryl-EZE\u00ae coating solutions.

{"title": "A novel strategy to develop antifouling and antibacterial conductive Cu/polydopamine/polyvinylidene fluoride membranes for water treatment.", "abstract": "Membrane fouling problem impedes widespread application of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for water treatment. This study proposed a novel strategy to endow hydrophobic PVDF ultrafiltration (UF) membrane with good antifouling and antibacterial activity. The novel strategy includes 3 steps: polydopamine (PDA) modification, Ag catalytic activation and electroless Cu plating. Via this strategy, copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) were in situ immobilized on PVDF membrane. The adhesive PDA layer not only facilitated to firm attachment of CuNPs, but also increased surface hydrophilicity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed successful immobilization of CuNPs, which improved surface hydrophilicity and absolution value of negative zeta potential as compared with the pristine PVDF membrane. Meanwhile, the modified Cu/PDA/PVDF membrane had relatively high conductivity, significantly improving antifouling performance when 0.30\u202fV\u202fcm", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2018-07-29", "authors": ["RenjieLi", "YantingWu", "LiguoShen", "JianrongChen", "HongjunLin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2018.07.090"}
{"title": "Neurosensory Disturbances After Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy Using Piezoelectric Surgery: A Systematic Review.", "abstract": "The objective of the present systematic review was to test the hypothesis of no difference in neurosensory disturbances (NSDs) after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) with piezoelectric surgery compared with conventional techniques.\nA PubMed (Medline), Embase Library, and Cochrane Library search in combination with a manual search of relevant journals was conducted from January 2000 to November 2017. Randomized controlled trials and controlled trials in humans were considered. Primary outcome measures (assessment of neuro-sensitivity by subjective and objective evaluations) and secondary outcome measures (NSD risk factors, patient-reported outcome measures, complications, operating time, and intraoperative bleeding) were considered.\nThe search provided 241 studies of which 5 eligible studies were included. Meta-analysis was not possible because of considerable heterogeneity. Two studies were characterized by a moderate risk of bias and 3 were characterized by a high risk of bias. Piezoelectric surgery substantially decreased NSDs as evaluated by subjective tests. NSD after BSSO varied from 1.8 to 23.0% with piezoelectric surgery and from 7.3 to 52.0% with conventional techniques after 2 to 12\u00a0months. Furthermore, piezoelectric surgery seemed to considerably decrease the frequency of intraoperative bleeding in bimaxillary procedures and decrease the risk of an unfavorable split of the mandible and macroscopic damage of the inferior alveolar nerve.\nThe hypothesis of no difference in NSD after BSSO with piezoelectric surgery compared with conventional techniques could be neither confirmed nor rejected owing to insufficient knowledge. However, piezoelectric surgery seems to decrease the risk of NSDs after BSSO compared with conventional techniques. Long-term randomized controlled trials comparing the 2 treatment modalities by standardized subjective and objective electrophysiologic tests are needed before one treatment modality can be considered superior to another.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2018-07-29", "authors": ["KristianRude", "PeterSvensson", "ThomasStarch-Jensen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2018.06.029"}
{"title": "Hairpin DNA-AuNPs as molecular binding elements for the detection of volatile organic compounds.", "abstract": "Hairpin DNA (hpDNA) loops were used for the first time as molecular binding elements in gas analysis. The hpDNA loops sequences of unpaired bases were studied in-silico to evaluate the binding versus four chemical classes (alcohols, aldehydes, esters and ketones) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The virtual binding score trend was correlated to the oligonucleotide size and increased of about 25% from tetramer to hexamer. Two tetramer and pentamer and three hexamer loops were selected to test the recognition ability of the DNA motif. The selection was carried out trying to maximize differences among chemical classes in order to evaluate the ability of the sensors to work as an array. All oligonucleotides showed similar trends with best binding scores for alcohols followed by esters, aldehydes and ketones. The seven ssDNA loops (CCAG, TTCT, CCCGA, TAAGT, ATAATC, CATGTC and CTGCAA) were then extended with the same double helix stem of four base pair DNA (GAAG to 5' end and CTTC to 3' end) and covalently bound to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using a thiol spacer attached to 5' end of the hpDNA. HpDNA-AuNPs were deposited onto 20\u202fMHz quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) to form the gas piezoelectric sensors. An estimation of relative binding affinities was obtained using different amounts of eight VOCs (ethanol, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, 1-pentanol, octanal, nonanal, ethyl acetate, ethyl octanoate, and butane-2,3-dione) representative of the four chemical classes. In agreement with the predicted simulation, hexamer DNA loops improved by two orders of magnitude the binding affinity highlighting the key role of the hpDNA loop size. Using the sensors as an array a clear discrimination of VOCs on the basis of molecular weight and functional groups was achieved, analyzing the experimental with principal components analysis (PCA) demonstrating that HpDNA is a promising molecular binding element for analysis of VOCs.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2018-07-29", "authors": ["MarcelloMascini", "SaraGaggiotti", "FlavioDella Pelle", "JosephWang", "Jos\u00e9 MPingarr\u00f3n", "DarioCompagnone"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2018.07.028"}

{"title": "Energy-efficient switching of nanomagnets for computing: straintronics and other methodologies.", "abstract": "The need for increasingly powerful computing hardware has spawned many ideas stipulating, primarily, the replacement of traditional transistors with alternate 'switches' that dissipate miniscule amounts of energy when they switch and provide additional functionality that are beneficial for information processing. An interesting idea that has emerged recently is the notion of using two-phase (piezoelectric/magnetostrictive) multiferroic nanomagnets with bistable (or multi-stable) magnetization states to encode digital information (bits), and switching the magnetization between these states with small voltages (that strain the nanomagnets) to carry out digital information processing. The switching delay is \u223c1 ns and the energy dissipated in the switching operation can be few to tens of aJ, which is comparable to, or smaller than, the energy dissipated in switching a modern-day transistor. Unlike a transistor, a nanomagnet is 'non-volatile', so a nanomagnetic processing unit can store the result of a computation locally without refresh cycles, thereby allowing it to double as both logic and memory. These dual-role elements promise new, robust, energy-efficient, high-speed computing and signal processing architectures (usually non-Boolean and often non-von-Neumann) that can be more powerful, architecturally superior (fewer circuit elements needed to implement a given function) and sometimes faster than their traditional transistor-based counterparts. This topical review covers the important advances in computing and information processing with nanomagnets, with emphasis on strain-switched multiferroic nanomagnets acting as non-volatile and energy-efficient switches-a field known as 'straintronics'.

Besides, the electronic nose was more sensitive than the electronic tongue to the ripening process, with large differences between samples after 7 and 21 days, while the electronic tongue was only sensitive to the initial maturation stages, with large difference between freshly prepared cheese and with seven days of maturation.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-07-26", "authors": ["Nuno I PValente", "AlisaRudnitskaya", "Jo\u00e3o A B POliveira", "M Teresa S RGomes", "Elvira M MGaspar"], "doi": "10.3390/s18082415\n10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00112-5\n10.1051/lait:2000105\n10.1051/lait:1989632\n10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(79)83405-0\n10.1051/lait:2000134\n10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.07.023\n10.1016/S0958-6946(03)00005-0\n10.1016/S0958-6946(03)00006-2\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.05.126\n10.1109/ICSENS.2010.5690762\n10.1016/S0925-4005(03)00395-2\n10.3390/s120201422\n10.1016/j.snb.2005.05.003\n10.1088/0957-0233/17/6/014\n10.1016/j.talanta.2008.03.051\n10.1016/j.snb.2008.09.025\n10.1016/j.snb.2008.10.045\n10.1007/s00216-003-2299-x\n10.3168/jds.2017-13820\n10.1002/jsfa.6933\n10.1016/j.talanta.2005.03.006\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.11.071\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.03.047\n10.3390/s18020519\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.03.115\n10.1016/0013-4686(85)85005-2\n10.1016/S0166-526X(03)80115-0\n10.1093/chromsci/38.7.270\n10.1002/jms.606\n10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.04.024\n10.1007/s00217-017-2945-8\n10.1016/j.snb.2005.11.069"}
{"title": "Implantable Energy-Harvesting Devices.", "abstract": "The sustainable operation of implanted medical devices is essential for healthcare applications. However, limited battery capacity is a key challenge for most implantable medical electronics (IMEs). The human body abounds with mechanical and chemical energy, such as the heartbeat, breathing, blood circulation, and the oxidation-reduction of glucose. Harvesting energy from the human body is a possible approach for powering IMEs. Many new methods for developing in vivo energy harvesters (IVEHs) have been proposed for powering IMEs. In this context energy harvesters based on the piezoelectric effect, triboelectric effect, automatic wristwatch devices, biofuel cells, endocochlear potential, and light, with an emphasis on fabrication, energy output, power management, durability, animal experiments, evaluation criteria, and typical applications are discussed. Importantly, the IVEHs that are discussed, are actually implanted into living things.

Furthermore, the morphology of the scaffolds plays also an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The present work reports on poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), a biocompatible, biodegradable, and piezoelectric biopolymer that has been processed in different morphologies, including films, fibers, microspheres, and 3D scaffolds. The corresponding magnetically active PHBV-based composites were also produced. The effect of the morphology on physico-chemical, thermal, magnetic, and mechanical properties of pristine and composite samples was evaluated, as well as their cytotoxicity. It was observed that the morphology does not strongly affect the properties of the pristine samples but the introduction of cobalt ferrites induces changes in the degree of crystallinity that could affect the applicability of prepared biomaterials. Young's modulus is dependent of the morphology and also increases with the addition of cobalt ferrites.

{"title": "Smart Injectable Self-Setting Monetite Based Bioceramics for Orthopedic Applications.", "abstract": "The present study is the first of its kind dealing with the development of a specific bioceramic which qualifies as a potential material in hard-tissue replacements. Specifically, we report the synthesis and evaluation of smart injectable calcium phosphate bone cement (CPC) which we believe will be suitable for various kinds of orthopedic and spinal-fusion applications. The smart nature of this next generation orthopedic implant is attained by incorporating piezoelectric barium titanate (BT) particles into monetite-based (dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, DCPA) CPC composition. The main goal is to take advantage of the piezoelectric properties of BT, as electromechanical effect plays a vital role in fracture healing at the defect site and bone integration with the implant. Furthermore, radiopacity of BT would help in easy detection of the CPC presence at the fracture site during surgery. Results reveal that BT addition favors important properties of bone cement such as good compressive strength, injectability, bioactivity, biocompatibility, and even washout resistance. Most importantly, the self-setting nature of the bone cements are not compromised with BT incorporation.

{"title": "Nanoconfinement-Induced \u03b2-Phase Formation Inside Poly(vinylidene fluoride)-Based Block Copolymers.", "abstract": "The electroactive properties of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) are a direct consequence of its crystalline phases. Although poorly understood, nanostructuring PVDF in confined geometries can drastically change its crystallization behavior. Therefore, we synthesized a variety of PVDF-based triblock copolymers to gain a better understanding of the melt crystallization and explore how crystallization is affected by the morphology and chemical nature of the amorphous block. Differential scanning calorimetry, small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy gave us excellent insights into the morphology and the corresponding crystalline phases. We find that crystallization of PVDF inside spherical nanodomains occurs via a homogeneous nucleation mechanism leading to a large undercooling and the formation of the thermodynamically favorable ferroelectric \u03b2-phase. On the contrary, when confined crystallization occurs inside a lamellar morphology, or in the case of breakout crystallization, a heterogeneous nucleation process leads to the formation of the nonferroelectric \u03b1-phase. Furthermore, favorable melt interactions between both blocks induce crystallization into the polar \u03b3-phase at moderate cooling rates.", "journal": "ACS macro letters", "date": "2018-07-24", "authors": ["Niels LMeereboer", "IvanTerzi\u0107", "SarahSaidi", "DanielHermida Merino", "KatjaLoos"], "doi": "10.1021/acsmacrolett.8b00418\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2017.04.004\n10.1021/ma301460h\n10.1080/00150199308008624\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2015.07.018\n10.1002/polb.23553\n10.1002/polb.22375\n10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b11178\n10.1021/ma500249p\n10.1021/ma011521p\n10.1021/ma012026w\n10.1557/mrs2005.249\n10.1063/1.882522\n10.1021/ja210548e\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2015.10.007\n10.1021/ma011824j\n10.1039/c3py01560b\n10.1039/C8PY00742J\n10.1107/S0909049597013484\n10.1107/S002188980300400X\n10.1021/ma800452y\n10.1021/jp306410j\n10.1515/epoly-2013-0119\n10.1002/pol.1980.180180412\n10.1002/polb.1994.090320509\n10.1166/jnn.2014.9272\n10.1063/1.334302\n10.1002/pol.1977.130151207\n10.1021/ma0200118\n10.1021/ma010552h\n10.1021/ma702691c\n10.1021/jp204513w\n10.1016/j.micromeso.2012.05.019"}

They exhibit stronger piezoelectric properties than bulk GaN. This phenomena may be crucial for applications of NWs and makes their study highly important. We report on an investigation of the structure evolution of a single GaN NW under an applied voltage bias along polar [0001] crystallographic direction until its mechanical break. The structural changes were investigated using coherent X-ray Bragg diffraction. The three-dimensional (3D) intensity distributions of the NWs without metal contacts, with contacts, and under applied voltage bias in opposite polar directions were analyzed. Coherent X-ray Bragg diffraction revealed the presence of significant bending of the NWs already after metal contacts deposition, which was increased at applied voltage bias. Employing analytical simulations based on elasticity theory and a finite element method (FEM) approach, we developed a 3D model of the NW bending under applied voltage. From this model and our experimental data, we determined the piezoelectric constant of the GaN NW to be about 7.7 pm/V in [0001] crystallographic direction. The ultimate tensile strength of the GaN NW was obtained to be about 1.22 GPa.

Alkali thiophosphates are investigated as ion conductors for solid electrolytes, and transition-metal thiophosphates are explored as a new class of ferroelectric materials. For the latter, a representative copper indium thiophosphate is ferrielectric at room temperature and, despite low polarization, exhibits giant negative electrostrictive coefficients. Here, we reveal that ionic conductivity in this material enables localized extraction of Cu ions from the lattice with a biased scanning probe microscopy tip, which is surprisingly reversible. The ionic conduction is tracked through local volume changes with a scanning probe microscopy tip providing a current-free probing technique, which can be explored for other thiophosphates of interest. Nearly 90 nm-tall crystallites can be formed and erased reversibly on the surface of this material as a result of ionic motion, the size of which can be sensitively controlled by both magnitude and frequency of the electric field, as well as the ambient temperature.

All scaffolds characterized morphologically by using SEM, TGF\u03b2 release profiling as well as biocompatibility by using SEM and MTT assays. Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) was isolated and characterized immediately and the differentiation of SMC was investigated when cultured on the surface of the scaffolds and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) as a control of gene and protein expression levels.

{"title": "Analysis and Experimental Validation of a Piezoelectric Harvester with Enhanced Frequency Bandwidth.", "abstract": "The use of a single bimorph as a harmonic oscillator aimed at harvesting vibrational energy is not effective due to its inherent narrow frequency bandwidth stemming from the need to adjust the natural frequency of the harvester to the platform excitation frequencies. Therefore, the present research focuses on the development, manufacturing, and testing of an advanced system based on three bimorphs, capable of adjusting their natural frequencies using tip end masses, and interconnected by springs, thus enlarging the system's bandwidth. An analytical model was developed for three bimorphs interconnected by two springs with three end masses. The model can predict the output generated voltage from each bimorph, and then the total output power is measured on a given outside resistor as a function of the material properties, the geometric dimensions of the vibrating beams, the end-masses, and the spring constants. The analytical model was then compared with data in the literature, yielding a good correlation. To further increase the reliability of the model, a test set-up was designed and manufactured that included three bimorphs with three end-masses connected by two springs. The system was excited using a shaker, and the output voltage was measured for each bimorph for various configurations. Then, the analytical model was tuned based on the test results by introducing two factors, the quality and the stiffness factors, and the predictions of the calibrated analytical model were compared with the experimental results, yielding a good correlation. The calibrated analytical model was then used to perform a comprehensive parametric investigation for two and three bimorphs systems, in which the influences of various parameters-like spring constant, mass value, thickness, and width and length of the bimorph and the substrate beam-on the output generated power were investigated. The main conclusion from this parametric investigation was that by correctly choosing the geometric sizes of the cantilevers, the adequate tip end masses, and the ratio between constants of the springs, the frequency bandwidth is expanded yielding a higher harvested power.

Further, a critical comparison between those membranes and other separator membranes is presented, as well as the future trends on this area.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2018-07-22", "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o CBarbosa", "Jos\u00e9 PDias", "SenentxuLanceros-M\u00e9ndez", "Carlos MCosta"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes8030045\n10.1016/0378-7753(94)02059-C\n10.1016/j.addma.2018.03.012\n10.1021/ja3091438\n10.1021/acscentsci.7b00288\n10.1002/slct.201701028\n10.1021/cr020738u\n10.1039/c3ra40732b\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.06.046\n10.1016/j.radphyschem.2016.12.002\n10.1007/s10008-016-3284-6\n10.1039/C7RA02681A\n10.1039/C6RA21089A\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.09.130\n10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.042\n10.1002/app.43707\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.08.087\n10.1039/C2TA00126H\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.02.050\n10.1038/nprot.2017.157\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1002/polb.23692\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2014.09.012\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.03.044\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.141\n10.1016/j.electacta.2013.11.155\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.027\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b00085\n10.1002/aenm.201300647\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.04.034\n10.1149/07001.0127ecst\n10.1007/s10118-016-1860-y\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.07.033\n10.1039/C5RA08717A\n10.1039/C5TA03349G\n10.1016/j.ssi.2016.05.020\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09227\n10.1002/cphc.201400065\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.05.010\n10.1016/j.electacta.2014.01.162\n10.1038/srep06007\n10.1039/C6TA02472F\n10.1007/s10008-014-2501-4\n10.1002/ppap.201500145\n10.1002/app.41036\n10.1016/j.electacta.2014.12.005\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.01.016\n10.1088/0022-3727/48/24/245304\n10.1016/j.electacta.2017.05.154\n10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.087\n10.1007/s10008-014-2412-4\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.072\n10.1002/adfm.201701768\n10.1007/s11581-016-1891-y\n10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60188-1\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.049\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.201\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.106\n10.1557/opl.2015.556\n10.1039/C4CP00624K\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.01.222\n10.1039/C5RA03769G\n10.1007/s10800-015-0895-z\n10.1021/acsami.6b09601\n10.1021/am505807k\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.07.048\n10.1016/j.electacta.2016.08.020\n10.1016/j.electacta.2017.11.191\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2016.02.015\n10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00122\n10.1016/j.ssi.2017.08.017\n10.1002/app.44473\n10.1039/C4TA02151G\n10.1002/pola.28153\n10.1039/C7TA03301J\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.01.022\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.079\n10.1039/C5TA02781K\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.01.006\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.09.004\n10.1039/C7TA05145J\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.078\n10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.016\n10.1016/j.ensm.2017.12.019\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.01.052\n10.1002/adfm.201500758\n10.1007/s10008-016-3466-2\n10.1039/C6RA15062D\n10.1007/s10008-016-3268-6\n10.1016/j.ensm.2017.05.014\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.09.125\n10.3390/ma9020075\n10.1016/j.matlet.2014.06.163\n10.1039/C4RA07994A\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.07.058\n10.1149/2.0421506jes\n10.1007/s11581-013-1030-y\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.01.102\n10.1016/j.electacta.2014.04.100\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.11.007\n10.1016/j.electacta.2016.08.039\n10.1039/C6NJ01786J\n10.1115/1.4034030\n10.1039/C6TA08404D\n10.1039/C6RA19168A\n10.1038/srep45390\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.03.188\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.026\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.058\n10.1007/s10008-016-3444-8\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.01.149\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.058\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.095\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.016\n10.1016/j.polymer.2016.11.008\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.12.025\n10.1007/s11581-017-2083-0\n10.1016/j.electacta.2013.11.076\n10.1016/j.electacta.2013.12.077\n10.1149/07301.0075ecst\n10.1149/2.0651701jes\n10.1021/acsami.7b06303\n10.1038/srep36977\n10.1007/s10570-014-0296-1\n10.1016/j.electacta.2013.10.183\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.645-646.1201\n10.1149/2.0631713jes\n10.1016/j.ssi.2015.08.003\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b00032\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.02.010\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2017.03.012\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2013.12.002\n10.1149/2.0261506jes\n10.1039/C5CC04424C\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.077\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.050"}
{"title": "Rapid Wave Velocity Measurement by Brillouin Scattering Using Coherent Phonons Induced by ScAlN Piezoelectric Thin-Film Transducer.", "abstract": "It is difficult to perform 2-D imaging of elastic properties using the Brillouin scattering technique because the weak thermal phonon signal in the sample leads to low measurement accuracy and long measurement times. To improve the phonon signal, we artificially induced acoustic phonons using a ScAlN thin-film piezoelectric transducer, which has a giant piezoelectricity. The film was grown using RF magnetron sputtering of a ScAl alloy target on a silica glass bar sample. Using a microwave probe, the electric power applied to the film was 1 mW at 875 MHz. We obtained the enhancement of the Brillouin scattering signal in the silica glass bar sample due to the induced phonons. Compared with and without the induced phonons from the ScAlN film transducer, the peak intensity improved by nearly 3 orders of magnitude. This technique can significantly shorten the time required for the Brillouin scattering measurements.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2018-07-22", "authors": ["MasahikoKawabe", "ShinjiTakayanagi", "HayatoIchihashi", "MasashiSuzuki", "TakahikoYanagitani", "MamiMatsukawa"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2854710"}
{"title": "Enhanced temperature stability in the R-T phase boundary with dominating intrinsic contribution.", "abstract": "In this study, 0.96KNNSx-0.01SZ-0.03BNZ ceramics (x = 0-0.08) were used as examples to illustrate the effects of phase boundaries on strain property and temperature stability. The addition of Sb5+ resulted in a rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) phase boundary at x = 0.05-0.07, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectra. In the R-T region, an improved piezoelectric constant (d33 = 390-440 pC N-1) and high unipolar strain (Suni = 0.14-0.15%) were observed due to the dominating intrinsic contribution. More importantly, a favorable temperature stability of Suni was observed in the ceramics with x = 0.05; for example, there was a slight variation of +5% to -13% when the temperature was increased from 20 \u00b0C to 180 \u00b0C. Through systematic investigations of composition and temperature-dependent strain, methods to improve Suni and consolidate its temperature stability in KNN-based ceramics were subsequently suggested. We believe that this study can promote the understanding and design of KNN-based ceramics with high strain and favorable temperature stability.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2018-07-22", "authors": ["XiangLv", "JiagangWu", "JianguoZhu", "DingquanXiao"], "doi": "10.1039/c8cp02891e"}
{"title": "Printable nanocomposites of polymers and silver nanoparticles for antibacterial devices produced by DoD technology.", "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are known for their efficient bactericidal activity and are widely used in industry. This study aims to produce printable antibacterial devices by drop-on-demand (DoD) inkjet technology, using Ag-NPs as the active part in complex printable fluids. The synthesis of this active part is described using two methods to obtain monodisperse NPs: chemical and microwave irradiation. The synthesized NPs were characterized by UV-VIS, STEM, TEM, DLS and XRD. Two printable fluids were produced based: one with Ag-NPs and a second one, a polymeric nanocomposite, using silver nanoparticles and polyvinyl butyral (Ag-NPs/PVB). Cellulose acetate was used as a flexible substrate. The ecotoxicity analysis of fluids and substrate was performed with Artemia franciscana nauplii. Optimized electric pulse waveforms for drop formation of the functional fluids were obtained for the piezoelectric-based DoD printing. Activity of printed antibacterial devices was evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer method with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The results show that the printed device with Ag-NP fluids evidenced a bacterial inhibition. An important advantage in using the DoD process is the possibility of printing, layer by layer or side by side, more than one active principle, allowing an interleaved or simultaneous release of silver NP and other molecules of interest as for example with a second functional fluid to ensure effectiveness of Ag activity.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2018-07-20", "authors": ["NicoleBarrera", "LizethGuerrero", "AlexisDebut", "PetrusSanta-Cruz"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0200918\n10.3389/fmicb.2010.00134\n10.3201/eid2106.150212\n10.1039/c6bm00688d\n10.1080/15287394.2017.1376727\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b01936\n10.2147/IJN.S35347\n10.1371/journal.pone.0084983\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2008.09.002\n10.3109/1040841X.2014.912200\n10.1007/s11051-017-3973-9\n10.1007/s11356-015-5668-z\n10.1080/10408398.2016.1237468\n10.1208/s12249-015-0348-3\n10.1038/s41565-017-0013-y\n10.1006/eesa.2001.2059\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.09.021\n10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.06.008\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.09.021\n10.1155/2014/256919\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.12.026"}
{"title": "Tunable WSe", "abstract": "Due to the absence of bond fracture and atomic reconstruction under strain, vdWs structures hold great promise in flexible electronic/optoelectronic applications. Besides all-2D heterojunctions, the dangling-bond-free surfaces of 2D materials also enable vdWs interaction with other materials of different dimensionalities, forming mixed-dimensional vdWs heterostructures. Such structures allow a much broader selection of materials and may provide a promising approach to compensate for the intrinsic weakness of 2D crystals before realizing their full potential. In this study, we present the fabrication of a WSe2-CdS mixed-dimensional vdWs p-n heterojunction for flexible photodetection. A strain-tunable vdWs interface was demonstrated and the photoresponse was dramatically enhanced with the piezo-phototronic effect. The photocurrent can be increased by \u223c110% under a compressive strain of -0.73% and the corresponding photoresponsivity reaches up to 33.4 A W-1. The enhancement originates from realigned local energy-band tilting at the WSe2-CdS interface by strain-induced piezopolarization, which promotes the transport process of photoexcited carriers. Our work provides a new route to a tunable vdWs interface other than with electrostatic gating, which may inspire the development of novel flexible vdWs optoelectronics.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2018-07-20", "authors": ["PeiLin", "LaipanZhu", "DingLi", "LiangXu", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1039/c8nr04376k"}

Furthermore, we reported an atomization rate measurement experiment that eliminated the atomization caused by a pressure increase, and demonstrated that a change in the volume of a micro-tapered hole could produce atomization. The experimental results indicate that, under the same voltage, the forward atomization rate is much higher than the reverse atomization rate and that the atomization rate increases with the micro-tapered hole volume. The experimental results show that the atomization of the micro-tapered aperture atomizer is caused by its pumping effect.

{"title": "Multi-Scale Stress Wave Simulation for Aggregates Segregation Detection of Concrete Core in Circular CFST Coupled with PZT Patches.", "abstract": "In this study, the numerical investigation of the detectability of concrete aggregate segregation in circular concrete-filled steel tubulars (CCFST) based on piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) measurement is performed. The stress wave propagation in the concrete core of circular CCFST excited with a surface-mounted PZT actuator is studied with multi-scale and multi-physical field coupling analysis. The piezoelectric effect of PZT patches and its coupling effect with CFSTs are considered. Numerical concrete modeling technology is employed to construct the concrete core composed of randomly distributed aggregates with and without aggregate segregation at different levels, mortar, and an interfacial transition zone (ITZ). The effects of the random distribution of elliptical aggregates, aggregate segregation, and the existence of ITZ in the concrete core on the wave fields in the cross-section and the corresponding voltage response of the embedded PZT sensor are discussed. An evaluation index based on wavelet packet analysis on the output voltage response is defined, and its sensitivity to concrete aggregate segregation is systematically investigated. The multi-scale and multi-physics coupling simulation results indicate that concrete aggregate segregation in the concrete core of CFST members can be efficiently detected based on the stress wave measurement with a PZT sensor.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-07-19", "authors": ["HongbingChen", "BinXu", "YilungMo", "TianminZhou"], "doi": "10.3390/ma11071223\n10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2016.14\n10.1007/978-90-481-9664-7_10\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.05.052\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2012.06.017\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.06.050\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000632\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.07.029\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2017.05.040\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.10.002\n10.12989/sss.2017.19.2.181\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.01.041\n10.1063/1.1306239\n10.3151/jact.6.171\n10.3390/s16122083\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2002)128:2(172)\n10.1016/0020-7225(96)00019-5\n10.1063/1.350958\n10.1016/S0958-9465(99)00016-5\n10.1016/S0045-7949(98)00177-1\n10.1016/j.finel.2005.11.008\n10.1016/S0950-0618(02)00096-X\n10.12989/sem.2005.19.5.519\n10.1177/1056789513516028\n10.1109/41.847906"}

In this study, we developed an electrochemical IL 8 biosensor by modification with a conductive composite including Super P, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and star polymer (SPGMA) of disposable ITO electrode surface. The Super P carbon black as carbonaceous material had a high conductivity and was used for the enhancement of electron transfer between electrode surface and electrolyte. Anti-IL 8 antibodies were utilized as biorecognition molecules and bound to epoxy groups of star polymer covalently. The chemical characterization of antibody immobilization on this composite was performed by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The characterizations of stepwise modification of this immunosensor were performed by electrochemical techniques such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Single Frequency Impedance (SFI); and morphological techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Several variables that affect the immunosensor performance were optimized. Under optimum conditions, a wide linear range 0.01-3\u202fpg/mL and low detection limit 3.3 fg/mL were obtained. Super P-star polymer composite modified immunosensor was easy, sensitive, cheap and reliable analytical method for IL 8 detection.

{"title": "Nonlinear effect of carrier drift on the performance of an n-type ZnO nanowire nanogenerator by coupling piezoelectric effect and semiconduction.", "abstract": "In piezoelectric semiconductors, electric fields drive carriers into motion/redistribution, and in turn the carrier motion/redistribution has an opposite effect on the electric field itself. Thus, carrier drift in a piezoelectric semiconducting structure is essentially nonlinear unless the induced fluctuation of carrier concentration is very small. In this paper, the nonlinear governing equation of carrier concentration was established by coupling both piezoelectric effect and semiconduction. A nonlinear carrier-drift effect on the performance of a ZnO nanogenerator was investigated in detail and it was elucidated that carrier motion/redistribution occurs in the ZnO nanowire (ZNW) cross section while there is no carrier motion in the axial direction. At the same time, we noted that the amplitude of boundary electric charge grows with increasing deformation, but the peaks of boundary electric charge do not appear at the cross-section endpoints. Thus, in order to effectively improve the performance of the ZNW nanogenerator, the effect of electrode configuration on the piezoelectric potential difference and output power was analyzed in detail. The electrode size for the optimal performance of a ZnO nanowire generator was proposed.

First, we derive the two basic equations concerning the Airy stress function and electric potential function. By expanding the unknown Airy stress function and electric potential function with respect to three perturbation parameters, the two basic equations were decoupled, thus obtaining the corresponding multi-parameter perturbation solution under boundary conditions. From the solution obtained, we can see clearly how the piezoelectric effects influence the behavior of the functionally graded piezoelectric cantilever beam. Based on a numerical example, the variations of the elastic stresses and displacements as well as the electric displacements of the cantilever beam under different gradient exponents were shown. The results indicate that if the pure functionally graded cantilever beam without a piezoelectric effect is regarded as an unperturbed system, the functionally graded piezoelectric cantilever beam can be looked upon as a perturbed system, thus opening the possibilities for perturbation solving.

It has been reported to have various pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities. However, the underlying mechanisms of myricetin on osteogenic differentiation remain unknown in human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). In this study, we investigated the ability of myricetin to increase osteogenic differentiation and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Myricetin significantly increased cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and alizarin red-mineralization activity in hPDLSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, myricetin dose-dependently increased osteogenic-related mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, it enhanced osteogenesis by up-regulating bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), which induced the expression of BMP receptor type IB, Smad-1/5/9. It also enhanced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Smads. We confirmed that the treatment of myricetin increased phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin which is related to osteogenesis. In our studies, myricetin-induced increment of ALP activity was decreased by ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580), and Smad 1/5/9 (LDN193189) inhibitors. ERK and p38 inhibitors showed the greatest inhibition among the four kinds of inhibitors.

An ionic polymer-metal composite membrane in the protonated form was prepared by casting a composite blend of sulfonated poly(1,4-phenylene ether-ether-sulfone), polyvinylidene fluoride and sulfonated graphene oxide onto a plating of platinum metal as the electrode. The degree of sulfonation of poly(1,4-phenylene ether-ether-sulfone) was characterized using ion-exchange capacity measurements. Energy dispersive X-ray and transmittance electron microscopy analyses were carried out to analyze the chemical composition and detailed structure. Deposition of the platinum electrode and the surface morphology of the proposed ionic polymer-metal composite actuator were assessed using scanning electron microscopy analysis. The electrical properties were measured using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and proton conductivity. These measurements confirmed the better actuation performance of the fabricated ionic polymer-metal composite actuator compared to other expensive ionic polymer-based actuators, in terms of its high ion-exchange capacity, good proton conductivity, high current density and large bending deflection.

{"title": "HapTable: An Interactive Tabletop Providing Online Haptic Feedback for Touch Gestures.", "abstract": "We present HapTable; a multi-modal interactive tabletop that allows users to interact with digital images and objects through natural touch gestures, and receive visual and haptic feedback accordingly. In our system, hand pose is registered by an infrared camera and hand gestures are classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. To display a rich set of haptic effects for both static and dynamic gestures, we integrated electromechanical and electrostatic actuation techniques effectively on tabletop surface of HapTable, which is a surface capacitive touch screen. We attached four piezo patches to the edges of tabletop to display vibrotactile feedback for static gestures. For this purpose, the vibration response of the tabletop, in the form of frequency response functions (FRFs), was obtained by a laser Doppler vibrometer for 84 grid points on its surface. Using these FRFs, it is possible to display localized vibrotactile feedback on the surface for static gestures. For dynamic gestures, we utilize the electrostatic actuation technique to modulate the frictional forces between finger skin and tabletop surface by applying voltage to its conductive layer. To our knowledge, this hybrid haptic technology is one of a kind and has not been implemented or tested on a tabletop. It opens up new avenues for gesture-based haptic interaction not only on tabletop surfaces but also on touch surfaces used in mobile devices with potential applications in data visualization, user interfaces, games, entertainment, and education. Here, we present two examples of such applications, one for static and one for dynamic gestures, along with detailed user studies. In the first one, user detects the direction of a virtual flow, such as that of wind or water, by putting their hand on the tabletop surface and feeling a vibrotactile stimulus traveling underneath it. In the second example, user rotates a virtual knob on the tabletop surface to select an item from a menu while feeling the knob's detents and resistance to rotation in the form of frictional haptic feedback.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics", "date": "2018-07-14", "authors": ["Senem EzgiEmgin", "AmirrezaAghakhani", "T MetinSezgin", "CagatayBasdogan"], "doi": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2855154"}

For such systems, due to the particular environmental conditions and working medium, the research on the mechanical and structural properties at every scale (from macroscopic to nanoscopic), and the control of the system dynamics and induced effects become very difficult tasks. For such purposes in submerged systems, piezoelectric patches (PZTp), which are light, small and economic, have been proved to be a very good solution. PZTp have been recently used as sensors/actuators for applications such as modal analysis, active sound and vibration control, energy harvesting and atomic force microscopes in submerged systems. As a consequence, in these applications, newly developed transducers based on PZTp have become the most used ones, which has improved the state of the art and methods used in these fields.

Electrons are accelerated from the high-voltage electrode of the ceramic piezoelectric transformer toward the grounded target, where they emit bremsstrahlung and characteristic X-ray radiation in the target material. The returning of the charge to the high-voltage electrode is provided due to electrons emitted from a filament installed in the vicinity of the target. It was found that the X-ray yield increases linearly at increasing of the pressure of the residual gas in the chamber within two orders of magnitude up to about 10 mTorr, when the gas discharge around of the piezoelectric transformer arises.

Full dispersion relations and wave mode shapes are vital to understanding dynamic behaviors of structures made of FGPPM. In this paper, an analytic method based on polynomial expansions is proposed to investigate the complex-valued dispersion and the evanescent Lamb wave in FGPPM plates. Comparisons with other related studies are conducted to validate the correctness of the presented method. Characteristics of the guided wave, including propagating modes and evanescent modes, in various FGPPM plates are studied, and three-dimensional full dispersion and attenuation curves are plotted to gain a deeper insight into the nature of the evanescent wave. The influences of the gradient variation on the dispersion and the magneto-electromechanical coupling factor are illustrated. The displacement amplitude and electric potential and magnetic potential distributions are also discussed in detail.

{"title": "Impact Monitoring for Aircraft Smart Composite Skins Based on a Lightweight Sensor Network and Characteristic Digital Sequences.", "abstract": "Due to the growing use of composite materials in aircraft structures, Aircraft Smart Composite Skins (ASCSs) which have the capability of impact monitoring for large-scale composite structures need to be developed. However, the impact of an aircraft composite structure is a random transient event that needs to be monitored on-line continuously. Therefore, the sensor network of an ASCS and the corresponding impact monitoring system which needs to be installed on the aircraft as an on-board device must meet the requirements of light weight, low power consumption and high reliability. To achieve this point, an Impact Region Monitor (IRM) based on piezoelectric sensors and guided wave has been proposed and developed. It converts the impact response signals output from piezoelectric sensors into Characteristic Digital Sequences (CDSs), and then uses a simple but efficient impact region localization algorithm to achieve impact monitoring with light weight and low power consumption. However, due to the large number of sensors of ASCS, the realization of lightweight sensor network is still a key problem to realize an applicable ASCS for on-line and continuous impact monitoring. In this paper, three kinds of lightweight piezoelectric sensor networks including continuous series sensor network, continuous parallel sensor network and continuous heterogeneous sensor network are proposed. They can greatly reduce the lead wires of the piezoelectric sensors of ASCS and they can also greatly reduce the monitoring channels of the IRM. Furthermore, the impact region localization methods, which are based on the CDSs and the lightweight sensor networks, are proposed as well so that the lightweight sensor networks can be applied to on-line and continuous impact monitoring of ASCS with a large number of piezoelectric sensors. The lightweight piezoelectric sensor networks and the corresponding impact region localization methods are validated on the composite wing box of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The accuracy rate of impact region localization is higher than 92%.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-07-13", "authors": ["LeiQiu", "XiaoleiDeng", "ShenfangYuan", "YongAnHuang", "YuanqiangRen"], "doi": "10.3390/s18072218\n10.1126/science.1261689\n10.3390/s16010055\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2010.05.003\n10.1002/mawe.201400375\n10.3390/s17112677\n10.1016/j.msea.2005.08.064\n10.1016/S0034-3617(10)70212-5\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.09.034\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2009.11.004\n10.2514/1.34895\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/105014\n10.1177/1475921710395815\n10.1177/1475921712449508\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/10/105025\n10.1080/15732479.2013.878732\n10.3390/s150716536\n10.3390/s17102270\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa63e1\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa7254\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.12.005\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.02.032\n10.1109/TIM.2014.2362417\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.07.011\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035018\n10.1109/TIM.2013.2247491\n10.3390/s131013356\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2006.01.010\n10.1177/1475921707081971\n10.1109/TIE.2016.2598529\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/7/075032\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.07.048\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/5/005\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2010.06.002\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2011.07.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.04.016\n10.1177/1045389X14545389"}

Preliminary sensitivity experiments show that high-quality mass spectra of acetaminophen can be obtained by consuming 100 femtomoles of the target. The dual spray of VSSI was also demonstrated by performing in-droplet denaturation of ubiquitin.

Employment of electrical signals in modulating cell proliferation and differentiation inspires us to use the electroactive polymers to achieve electrical stimulation for repairing impaired tissues. Electroactive polymers have found numerous applications in biomedicine due to their capability in effectively delivering electrical signals to the seeded cells, such as biosensing, tissue regeneration, drug delivery, and biomedical implants. Here we will summarize the electrical characteristics of electroactive polymers, which enables them to electrically influence cellular function and behavior, including conducting polymers, piezoelectric polymers, and polyelectrolyte gels.

{"title": "Piezoelectric effects on the resonance frequencies of boron nitride nanosheets.", "abstract": "By using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find in this work that due to the piezoelectric characteristic of boron nitride (BN) nanosheets their resonance frequencies can be efficiently tuned by applying an external electric field. This finding suggests that BN nanosheet can be treated as a good building block for designing novel piezoelectrically tunable two-dimensional nanoresonators. As BN nanosheets possess an inversely stacked structure, the applied electric field has different effects on the resonance frequency of BN nanosheets with odd and even layers. The influence of piezoelectric effect on the vibration behaviours observed in MD simulations is found to significantly deviate from the prediction of the conventional Euler-Bernoulli beam model (EBM), since the EBM cannot account for the weak van der Waals interaction between neighbouring layers in BN nanosheets. To take into account the interlayer interaction in the mathematical modelling of the piezoelectric effect on the vibration of BN nanosheets, we propose here a novel multiple beam model (MBM), which can account for both interlayer stretching and shearing deformations. The MBM result is found to be in a good agreement with the MD result without any additional parameters fitting, which indicates that the present MBM can be treated as a more precise theoretical model in the future study of the vibration properties of BN nanosheets.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2018-07-07", "authors": ["JinZhang", "JianliZhou"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/aad1b5"}

{"title": "Force induced piezoelectric effect of polyvinylidene fluoride and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene nanofibrous scaffolds.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride and its co-polymer with trifluoroethylene are promising biomaterials for supporting nerve regeneration processes because of their proven biocompatibility and piezoelectric properties that could stimulate cell ingrowth due to electrical activity upon mechanical deformation. This study reports the piezoelectric effect of electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride scaffolds in response to mechanical loading. An impact test machine was used to evaluate the generation of electrical voltage upon application of an impact load. Scaffolds were produced via electrospinning from polyvinylidene fluoride and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene with concentrations of 10-20\u2009wt% dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetone (6:4). The structural and thermal properties of scaffolds were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry, respectively. The piezoelectric response of the scaffolds was induced using a custom-made manual impact press machine. Impact forces between 0.4 and 14\u2009N were applied. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry results demonstrated the piezoelectric effect of the electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene scaffolds. All the scaffolds exhibited a piezoelectric polar beta-phase formation. Their thermal enthalpies were higher than the value of the initial materials and exhibited a better tendency of crystallization. The electrospun scaffolds exhibited piezoelectric responses in form of voltage by applying impact load. Polyvinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene scaffolds showed higher values in the range of 6-30\u2009V as compared to pure polyvinylidene fluoride.

{"title": "An Analytical Temperature-Dependent Design Model for Contour-Mode MEMS Resonators and Oscillators Verified by Measurements.", "abstract": "The importance of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) for radio-frequency (RF) applications is rapidly growing. In RF mobile-communication systems, MEMS-based circuits enable a compact implementation, low power consumption and high RF performance, e.g., bulk-acoustic wave filters with low insertion loss and low noise or fast and reliable MEMS switches. However, the cross-hierarchical modelling of micro-electronic and micro-electromechanical constituents together in one multi-physical design process is still not as established as the design of integrated micro-electronic circuits, such as operational amplifiers. To close the gap between micro-electronics and micro-electromechanics, this paper presents an analytical approach towards the linear top-down design of MEMS resonators, based on their electrical specification, by the solution of the mechanical wave equation. In view of the central importance of thermal effects for the performance and stability of MEMS-based RF circuits, the temperature dependence was included in the model; the aim was to study the variations of the RF parameters of the resonators and to enable a temperature dependent MEMS oscillator simulation. The variations of the resonator parameters with respect to the ambient temperature were then verified by RF measurements in a vacuum chamber at temperatures between &minus;35 \u2218C and 85 \u2218C. The systematic body of data revealed temperature coefficients of the resonant frequency between &minus;26 ppm/K and &minus;20 ppm/K, which are in good agreement with other data from the literature. Based on the MEMS resonator model derived, a MEMS oscillator was designed, simulated, and measured in a vacuum chamber yielding a measured temperature coefficient of the oscillation frequency of &minus;26.3 ppm/K. The difference of the temperature coefficients of frequency of oscillator and resonator turned out to be mainly influenced by the limited ", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-07-06", "authors": ["JohannesStegner", "SebastianGropp", "DmitryPodoskin", "UweStehr", "MartinHoffmann", "Matthias AHein"], "doi": "10.3390/s18072159\n10.1088/0960-1317/17/3/030\n10.1088/1674-4926/37/10/101001\n10.1109/TED.2013.2295613\n10.12720/joace.2.2.191-194\n10.1109/TED.2017.2708129\n10.3390/mi7090160\n10.1007/BF02644859\n10.1088/0960-1317/26/6/065012\n10.1109/PROC.1966.4682"}

Different from most postmodification methods, herein, we propose one single-step unidirectional segregation strategy to fabricate a polymeric Janus membrane with extremely opposite wetting surfaces showing almost a 150\u00b0 contact angle difference for the first time. We achieved the unidirectional segregation of the hydrophilic copolymer poly(vinylpyrrolidone-vinyltriethoxysilane) in a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane during phase separation. A glycerol coating on the nonwoven fabric support locally limited the phase separation on the bottom surface, blocked the segregation of hydrophilic copolymer, and promoted the segregation to the top surface. Working collaboratively with the asymmetric micro-/nanostructure on both surfaces, the resulting Janus membrane exhibited a superhydrophilic top surface and a superhydrophobic bottom surface. The Janus PVDF membrane showed switchable separation performance and high separation efficiency for both oil-in-water emulsions and water-in-oil emulsions because of its anisotropic wettability compared with solely hydrophobic or hydrophilic PVDF membranes.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2018-07-04", "authors": ["TiantianLi", "FuLiu", "ShaofeiZhang", "HaiboLin", "JianqiangWang", "Chuyang YTang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.8b08278"}

Based on these sensing approaches, examples of bioanalytical applications are presented for toxic gas detection, cell membrane interactions, label-free biomolecular assays, anticancer drug evaluation, complement activation-related multiprotein membrane attack complexes, and daily biodiagnosis, which are partially supported by data analysis, such as machine learning and principal component analysis.", "journal": "Chemistry, an Asian journal", "date": "2018-07-01", "authors": ["Joshua AJackman", "Nam-JoonCho", "MichihiroNishikawa", "GenkiYoshikawa", "TaizoMori", "Lok KumarShrestha", "KatsuhikoAriga"], "doi": "10.1002/asia.201800935"}

{"title": "The use of laser assisted hatching of frozen/thawed embryos versus laser assisted hatching of fresh embryos in human intracytoplasmic sperm injection.", "abstract": "Cryopreservation of human embryos has become an essential part of assisted reproduction. It limits the number of embryo transferred while supernumerary embryos can be transferred in subsequent cycles, however, it is associated with zonal hardening, which lowers the success rate in the majority of (ICSI) centres, associated with decreased implantation rate and clinical pregnancy rates. Assisted hatching has been used to induce microdissection of the zona pellucida. Many techniques have been used, such as mechanical, chemical, piezo and laser techniques.\nTo compare the efficacy of laser assisted hatching of vitrified embryos and fresh embryos with regards to implantation rate and clinical pregnancy rate.\nProspective randomised study.\nOne hundred twenty women with fresh embryos scheduled for (ICSI) were randomised in two groups; laser assisted hatching (LAH) group (test group), containing 60 women and the other is (non LAH) (control group). Second group with 120 women with frozen embryos were randomised in (LAH group) and (non LAH group). On the day of embryo transfer, 1.48\u2009\u03bcm Infrared Diode laser, class 1\u2009M, was used in test group to induce zonal microdissection, the quality and safety of embryos is assessed morphologically after hatching.

{"title": "Surface acoustic waves in one-dimensional piezoelectric-metallic phononic crystal: Effect of a cap layer.", "abstract": "We study the propagation of transverse acoustic waves associated with the surface of a semi-infinite superlattice (SL) composed of piezoelectric-metallic layers and capped with a piezoelectric layer. We present closed-form expressions for localized surface waves, the so-called Bleustein-Gulyaev (BG) waves depending on whether the cap layer is open-circuited or short-circuited. These expressions are obtained by means of the Green's function method which enables to deduce also the densities of states. These theoretical results are illustrated by a few numerical applications to SLs made of piezoelectric layers of hexagonal symmetry belonging to the 6\u202fmm class such as PZT4 and ZnO in contact with metallic layers such as Fe, Al, Au, Cu and boron-doped-diamond. We demonstrate a rule about the existence of surface modes when considering two complementary semi-infinite SLs obtained by the cleavage of an infinite SL along a plane parallel to the piezoelectric layers. Indeed, when the surface layers are open-circuited, one obtains one surface mode per gap, this mode is associated with one of the two complementary SLs. However, when the surface layers are short-circuited, this rule is not fulfilled and one can obtain zero, one or two modes inside each gap of the two complementary SLs depending on the position of the plane where the cleavage is produced. We show that in addition to the BG surface waves localized at the surface of the cap layer, there may exist true guided waves and pseudo-guided waves (i.e. leaky waves) induced by the cap layer either inside the gaps or inside the bands of the SL respectively. Also, we highlight the possibility of existence of interface modes between the SL and a cap layer as well as an interaction between these modes and the BG surface mode when both modes fall in the same band gaps of the SL. The strength of the interaction depends on the width of the cap layer. Finally, we show that the electromechanical coupling coefficient (ECC) is very sensitive to the cap layer thickness, in particular we calculate and discuss the behavior of the ECC as a function of the adlayer thickness for the low velocity surface modes of the SL which exhibit the highest ECC values. The effect of the nature of the metallic layers inside the SL on the ECC is also investigated.

The proposed scheme here greatly extends the application of the optimum frequency in comparison to the existing studies. The mechanical quality factor of an ultrasonic motor is initially derived to describe the loss, which further is also in proportion to the temperature rise. The optimum frequency from the loss reduction viewpoint is then obtained, at which frequency the ultrasonic motor maintains the minimum loss and subsequently the minimum temperature rise. The optimum-frequency tracking scheme is subsequently constructed. Experiments are carried out to verify the existence of the optimum frequency and the reduction of the temperature-rise under the applied voltages in the general form, whose amplitudes and phase difference are all adjustable. The results have inferred that the optimum frequency still exists even though the applied voltages are in the general form, at which frequency the temperature-rise is obviously reduced in the absence of any external cooling equipment. The optimum frequency of the ultrasonic motor now gets closer to the industrial applications, especially when the applications require the velocity adjustment in a wide range.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2018-06-25", "authors": ["WeijiaShi", "HuiZhao", "BoZhao", "XueQi", "WeishanChen", "JiubinTan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2018.06.003"}

{"title": "Single-Input and Multiple-Output Surface Acoustic Wave Sensing for Damage Quantification in Piezoelectric Sensors.", "abstract": "The main aim of the paper is damage detection at the microscale in the anisotropic piezoelectric sensors using surface acoustic waves (SAWs). A novel technique based on the single input and multiple output of Rayleigh waves is proposed to detect the microscale cracks/flaws in the sensor. A convex-shaped interdigital transducer is fabricated for excitation of divergent SAWs in the sensor. An angularly shaped interdigital transducer (IDT) is fabricated at 0 degrees and \u00b120 degrees for sensing the convex shape evolution of SAWs. A precalibrated damage was introduced in the piezoelectric sensor material using a micro-indenter in the direction perpendicular to the pointing direction of the SAW. Damage detection algorithms based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and principal component analysis (PCA) are implemented to quantify the evolution of damage in piezoelectric sensor material. The evolution of the damage was quantified using a proposed condition indicator (CI) based on normalized Euclidean norm of the change in principal angles, corresponding to pristine and damaged states.

In this paper, a novel micromanipulation method named &ldquo;Hydrodynamic Tweezers&rdquo; using the vortex induced by oscillating a single piezoelectric actuator is introduced. The piezoelectric actuator is set between a micropipette and a copper beam. Oscillating the actuator at a certain frequency causes the resonance of the copper beam and extend 1D straight oscillation of the piezoelectric actuator to 2D circular oscillation of the micropipette, which induces a micro vortex after putting the micropipette into fluid. The induced vortex featuring low pressure in its core area can trap the object nearby. A robotic micromanipulator is utilized to transport the trapped objects together with the micropipette. Experiments of trapping and transportation microbeads are carried out to characterize the key parameters. The results show that the trapping force can be controlled by adjusting peak-peak voltage of the sinusoidal voltage input into the piezoelectric actuator.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-06-23", "authors": ["XiaomingLiu", "QingShi", "YuqingLin", "MasaruKojima", "YasushiMae", "QiangHuang", "ToshioFukuda", "TatsuoArai"], "doi": "10.3390/s18072002\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2010.03.002\n10.3390/s151229872\n10.3390/mi5030681\n10.1109/TRO.2016.2623337\n10.1063/1.3631662\n10.1063/1.4746247\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/7/075009\n10.1109/TMECH.2008.2011986\n10.1007/s10544-015-0001-7\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.24.156\n10.1126/science.3547653\n10.1039/B913587A\n10.1016/0005-2736(92)90028-K\n10.1016/0304-4165(93)90056-E\n10.1121/1.400907\n10.1039/C6LC01142J\n10.1021/ac203002z\n10.1039/c3lc51134k\n10.1073/pnas.0606625104"}

Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is used as the polymer matrix due to its high breakdown strength, e.g. 600-700 kV mm-1. As a result, the permittivity and breakdown electric field reach 53 at 1 kHz and 550 kV mm-1, respectively. Therefore, the nanocomposites achieve a higher discharge energy density of 12.4 J cm-3 with excellent cycle stability, which is the highest among nanocomposites based on a nanowire array as a filler in a PVDF matrix.

{"title": "Piezoelectricity in WSe", "abstract": "A two-dimensional heterostructure of WSe2/MoS2 atomic layers has unique piezoelectric characteristics which depend on the number of atomic layers, stacking type and interlayer interaction size. The van der Waals heterostructure of p- and n-type TMDC atomic layers with different work functions forms a type-II staggered gap alignment. The large band offset of the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum between p-type WSe2 and n-type MoS2 atomic layers leads to large electric polarization and piezoelectricity. The output voltages for a MoS2/WSe2 partial vertical heterostructure with a size of 3.0 nm \u00d7 1.5 nm were 0.137 V and 0.183 V under 4% and 8% tensile strains, respectively. The output voltage of an AB-stacking MoS2/WSe2 heterostructure was larger than that of an AA-stacking heterostructure under 4% tensile strain due to the contribution of intrinsic piezoelectricity and symmetric out-of-plane conditions. The AB-stacking has a lower formation energy and better structural stability compared to AA-stacking. The large output voltage of nanoscale partial or full vertical heterostructures of 2D WSe2/MoS2 atomic layers in addition to the increased output voltage through the series connection of multiple nanoscale piezoelectric devices will enable the realization of nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) with TMDC heterostructure atomic layers.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2018-06-22", "authors": ["ShengYu", "QuintonRice", "BagherTabibi", "QiliangLi", "Felix JaetaeSeo"], "doi": "10.1039/c8nr04394a"}
{"title": "Collision and annihilation of nonlinear sound waves and action potentials in interfaces.", "abstract": "Nerve impulses, previously proposed as manifestations of nonlinear acoustic pulses localized at the plasma membrane, can annihilate upon collision. However, whether annihilation of acoustic waves at interfaces takes place is unclear. We previously showed the propagation of nonlinear sound waves that propagate as solitary waves above a threshold (super-threshold) excitation in a lipid monolayer near a phase transition. Here we investigate the interaction of these waves. Sound waves were excited mechanically via a piezo cantilever in a lipid monolayer at the air-water interface and their amplitude is reported before and after a collision. The compression amplitude was observed via F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer between donor and acceptor dyes, measured at fixed points along the propagation path in the lipid monolayer. We provide direct experimental evidence for the annihilation of two super-threshold interfacial pulses upon head-on collision in a lipid monolayer and conclude that sound waves propagating in a lipid interface can interact linearly, nonlinearly, or annihilate upon collision depending on the state of the system. Thus we show that the main characteristics of nerve impulses, i.e. solitary character, velocity, couplings, all-or-none behaviour, threshold and even annihilation are also demonstrated by nonlinear sound waves in a lipid monolayer, where they follow directly from the thermodynamic principles applied to an interface. As these principles are equally unavoidable in a nerve membrane, our observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical basis of action potentials and the observed nonlinear-pules is identical.", "journal": "Journal of the Royal Society, Interface", "date": "2018-06-22", "authors": ["ShamitShrivastava", "Kevin HKang", "Matthias FSchneider"], "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2017.0803\n10.1007/BF00368736\n10.1007/BF00396549\n10.1002/andp.19103381612\n10.1051/jphys:01978003903030100\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.11.1617\n10.1038/srep22874\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.198103\n10.1016/0040-6090(86)90225-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067524\n10.1103/PhysRevE.86.061909\n10.1098/rsif.2014.0098\n10.1103/PhysRevE.91.012715\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.983\n10.1103/RevModPhys.61.75\n10.1063/1.2205916\n10.1038/nphys3135\n10.1038/nphys486\n10.1152/jn.1998.79.5.2809\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-01-00010.1998\n10.1016/0006-3002(49)90121-3\n10.1073/pnas.0503823102\n10.1103/PhysRevFluids.2.114804\n10.1103/PhysRevX.4.031047\n10.1140/epje/i2011-11057-0\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.09.020\n10.1038/s41598-017-01849-3\n10.1073/pnas.75.4.2040\n10.5061/dryad.f06d9k2"}

{"title": "Numerical emulation of Thru-Reflection-Line calibration for the de-embedding of Surface Acoustic Wave devices.", "abstract": "In this contribution, a rigorous numerical calibration is proposed to characterize the excitation of propagating mechanical waves by interdigitated transducers (IDTs). The transition from IDT terminals to phonon waveguides is modeled by means of a general circuit representation that makes use of Scattering Matrix (SM) formalism. In particular, the three-step calibration approach called the Thru-Reflection-Line (TRL), that is a well-established technique in microwave engineering, has been successfully applied to emulate typical experimental conditions. The proposed procedure is suitable for the synthesis/optimization of surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) based devices: the TRL calibration allows to extract/de-embed the acoustic component, namely resonator or filter, from the outer IDT structure, regardless of complexity and size of the letter. We report, as a result, the hybrid scattering parameters of the IDT transition to a mechanical waveguide formed by a phononic crystal patterned on a piezoelectric AlN membrane, where the effect of a discontinuity from periodic to uniform mechanical waveguide is also characterized. In addition, to ensure the correctness of our numerical calculations, the proposed method has been validated by independent calculations.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2018-06-20", "authors": ["DMencarelli", "BDjafari-Rouhani", "YPennec", "APitanti", "SZanotto", "MStocchi", "LPierantoni"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-27511-0\n10.1038/srep02140\n10.1038/srep33380\n10.1038/srep21980\n10.1038/srep45864\n10.1016/j.protcy.2017.04.032\n10.1021/ac00052a008\n10.1016/j.phpro.2015.08.194\n10.1039/c2lc40396j\n10.1109/58.393122\n10.1109/58.248230\n10.1109/58.265821\n10.1109/T-UFFC.1986.26832\n10.1016/j.proeng.2013.09.104\n10.1103/PhysRevA.92.013836\n10.1109/LAWP.2017.2683940\n10.1109/TMTT.2013.2265683\n10.1109/TMTT.2012.2193136"}

Most of the previous microfluidic particle separation techniques have used sheath flows to achieve efficient sample focusing. The sheath flow dilutes the analyte and requires additional microchannels and accurate flow control. We demonstrated a tilted-angle traveling surface acoustic wave (taTSAW)-based sheathless focusing and separation of particles in a continuous flow. The proposed device consists of a piezoelectric substrate with a pair of interdigitated transducers (IDTs) deposited at two different angles relative to the flow direction. A Y-shaped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel having one inlet and two outlet ports was positioned on top of the IDTs such that the acoustic energy coupling into the fluid was maximized and wave attenuation by the PDMS walls was minimized. The two IDTs independently produced high-frequency taTSAWs, which propagated at \u00b130\u00b0 with respect to the flow direction and imparted a direct acoustic radiation force onto the target particles. A sample mixture of 4.8 and 3.2 \u03bcm particles was focused and then separated by the actuation of the IDTs at 194 and 136 MHz frequencies, respectively, without using an additional sheath flow.

Our goal was to investigate the damage mechanism of hydrostatic pressure associated with mass effect and the cooperative effect of hydrostatic pressure plus hemoglobin on neural injuries. Loading hydrostatic pressure on neurons and injecting agarose gel in the right striatum of rats was performed to establish the in vitro and vivo ICH models, respectively. The elevated hydrostatic pressure associated with ICH suppressed neurons and neural tissues viability, and disturbed the axons and dendrites in vitro and vivo. Moreover, hydrostatic pressure could upregulate the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and BAX, and downregulate Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Meanwhile, the toxicity of hemoglobin would be enhanced when conducted with hydrostatic pressure together. Furthermore, the exclusive hydrostatic pressure could upregulate the Piezo-2 expression, which reached a plateau at 8\u2009h after ICH. And hemoglobin increased Piezo-2 expression significantly in vivo, and that was also promoted significantly by the elevated volume of Gel in the cooperative groups.

In this regard, c-axis GaN nanowires were grown on GaN substrate using the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) technique by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. Further, Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was coated on nanowire-arrays then PDMS matrix embedded with GaN nanowire-arrays was transferred on Si-rubber substrate. The piezoelectric performance of nanowire-based flexible PNG was measured, while the device was actuated using a cyclic stretching-releasing agitation mechanism that was driven by a linear motor. The piezoelectric output was measured as a function of actuation frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 10 Hz and a linear tendency was observed for piezoelectric output current, while the output voltages remained constant. A maximum of piezoelectric open circuit voltages and short circuit current were measured 15.4 V and 85.6 nA, respectively. In order to evaluate the feasibility of our flexible PNG for real application, a long term stability test was performed for 20,000 cycles and the device performance was degraded by less than 18%. The underlying reason for the high piezoelectric output was attributed to the reduced free carriers inside nanowires due to surface Fermi-level pinning and insulating metal-dielectric-semiconductor interface, respectively; the former reduced the free carrier screening radially while latter reduced longitudinally. The flexibility and the high aspect ratio of GaN nanowire were the responsible factors for higher stability.

Further, conventional subtractive manufacturing processes for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) relatively limit device structure to two dimensions and require post-processing steps for interface with microfluidics. Thus, the objective of this work is to create an additive manufacturing approach for fabrication of 3D microfluidic-based MEMS devices that enables 3D configurations of electromechanical systems and simultaneous integration of microfluidics. Here, we demonstrate the ability to fabricate microfluidic-based acoustofluidic devices that contain orthogonal out-of-plane piezoelectric sensors and actuators using additive manufacturing. The devices were fabricated using a microextrusion 3D printing system that contained integrated pick-and-place functionality. Additively assembled materials and components included 3D printed epoxy, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), silver nanoparticles, and eutectic gallium-indium as well as robotically embedded piezoelectric chips (lead zirconate titanate (PZT)). Electrical impedance spectroscopy and finite element modeling studies showed the embedded PZT chips exhibited multiple resonant modes of varying mode shape over the 0-20 MHz frequency range. Flow visualization studies using neutrally buoyant particles (diameter = 0.8-70 \u03bcm) confirmed the 3D printed devices generated bulk acoustic waves (BAWs) capable of size-selective manipulation, trapping, and separation of suspended particles in droplets and microchannels. Flow visualization studies in a continuous flow format showed suspended particles could be moved toward or away from the walls of microfluidic channels based on selective actuation of in-plane or out-of-plane PZT chips.

After signal detection and acquisition, quantification of the resulting bands is achieved using densitometry software. Results are normalized against controls and housekeeping proteins (e.g., GAPDH, beta-actin and tubulin), which are constitutively expressed proteins that maintain cell viability.

There are three ways for them to impact on the optical process in various materials. They can act as external perturbations, such as ferroelectric gating and piezoelectric strain, to tune the optical properties of the materials and devices. Second, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity as innate attributes may exist in some optoelectronic materials, which can couple with other functional features (e.g., semiconductor transport, photoexcitation, and photovoltaics) in the materials giving rise to unprecedented device characteristics. The last way is artificially introducing optical functionalities into ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials and devices, which provides an opportunity for investigating the intriguing interplay between the parameters (e.g., electric field, temperature, and strain) and the introduced optical properties. Here, the tuning strategies, fundamental mechanisms, and recent progress in ferroelectric and piezoelectric effects modulating the optical properties of a wide spectrum of materials, including lanthanide-doped phosphors, quantum dots, 2D materials, wurtzite-type semiconductors, and hybrid perovskites, are presented.

{"title": "A PVDF-Based Sensor for Internal Stress Monitoring of a Concrete-Filled Steel Tubular (CFST) Column Subject to Impact Loads.", "abstract": "Impact loads can have major adverse effects on the safety of civil engineering structures, such as concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns. The study of mechanical behavior and stress analysis of CFST columns under impact loads is very important to ensure their safety against such loads. At present, the internal stress monitoring of the concrete cores CFST columns under impact loads is still a very challenging subject. In this paper, a PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) piezoelectric smart sensor was developed and successfully applied to the monitoring of the internal stress of the concrete core of a CFST column under impact loads. The smart sensor consists of a PVDF piezoelectric film sandwiched between two thin steel plates through epoxy. The protection not only prevents the PVDF film from impact damages but also ensures insulation and waterproofing. The smart sensors were embedded into the circular concrete-filled steel tube specimen during concrete pouring. The specimen was tested against impact loads, and testing data were collected.

{"title": "Coupling of PZT Thin Films with Bimetallic Strip Heat Engines for Thermal Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "A thermal energy harvester based on a double transduction mechanism and which converts thermal energy into electrical energy by means of piezoelectric membranes and bimetals, has previously been developed and widely presented in the literature In such a device, the thermo-mechanical conversion is ensured by a bimetal whereas the electro-mechanical conversion is generated by a piezoelectric ceramic. However, it has been shown that only 19% of the mechanical energy delivered by the bimetal during its snap is converted into electrical energy. To extract more energy from the bimetallic strip and to increase the transduction efficiency, a new way to couple piezoelectric materials with bimetals has thus been explored through direct deposition of piezoelectric layers on bimetals. This paper consequently presents an alternative way to harvest heat, based on piezoelectric bimetallic strip heat engines and presents a proof of concept of such a system. In this light, different PZT (Lead zirconate titanate) thin films were synthesized directly on aluminium foils and were attached to the bimetals using conductive epoxy. The fabrication process of each sample is presented herein as well as the experimental tests carried out on the devices. Throughout this study, different thicknesses of the piezoelectric layers and substrates were tested to determine the most powerful configuration.

The results showed that the Biopac system measured consistently and significantly lower PWV values than the Complior system, for all positions. Correlation values and Bland-Altman plots showed that despite the difference in PWV magnitudes obtained by the two systems the measurements did agree well.

{"title": "An Evaluation System for the Contact Electrification of a Single Microparticle Using Microelectromechanical-Based Actuated Tweezers.", "abstract": "The image quality of laser and multi-function printers that make use of electrophotography depends on the amount of surface charge generated by contact electrification on the toner particles. However, because it has been impossible to experimentally evaluate such amounts under controlled contact conditions using macroscopic measurements, theoretical elucidation of the contact electrification mechanism has not progressed sufficiently. In the present study, we have developed a system to experimentally evaluate the contact electrification of a single particle using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanotweezers (microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based actuated tweezers). This system performs, in succession, (i) a contact test that makes use of the nanotweezers and three piezoelectric stages, and (ii) an image force measurement using the AFM cantilever.

The development of solid- or quasi-solid-state electrolytes for thermocells could address the possible leakage problems of liquid electrolytes and make this technology more applicable for wearable devices. Here, we report the gelation of an organic-solvent-based electrolyte system containing a redox couple for application in thermocell technologies. The effect of gelation of the liquid electrolyte, comprising a cobalt bipyridyl redox couple dissolved in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN), on the performance of thermocells was investigated. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) (PVDF-HFP) were used for gelation of the electrolyte, and the influence of the different polymers on the mechanical properties was studied. The Seebeck coefficient and diffusivity of the cobalt redox couple were measured in both liquid and gelled electrolytes, and the effect of gelation on the thermocell performance is reported.

In this paper, a novel machine learning technology based on Learning-based Cell Injection Control (LCIC) approach is demonstrated for effective DOD printing control while eliminating satellite droplets automatically. The LCIC approach includes a specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation model of piezoelectric DOD print-head considering inverse piezoelectric effect, which is used instead of repetitive experiments to collect data, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network trained by simulation data based on artificial neural network algorithm, using the well-known classification performance of MLP to optimize DOD printing parameters automatically. The test accuracy of the LCIC method was 90%. With the validation of LCIC method by experiments, satellite droplets from piezoelectric DOD printing are reduced significantly, improving the printing efficiency drastically to satisfy requirements of manufacturing precision for printing complex artificial tissues.

{"title": "Two-degrees-of-freedom piezo-driven fast steering mirror with cross-axis decoupling capability.", "abstract": "Because mechanical cross coupling between its axes would lead to degradation of the scanning precision of a piezo-driven fast steering mirror (PFSM), a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DoF) PFSM with a cross-axis decoupling capability, in which 2-DoF flexure hinges are used, is proposed in this work. The overall structure of the proposed PFSM is first introduced and then both static and dynamic models are established analytically; in addition, the decoupling mechanism is described in detail and the low dynamic cross coupling ratios that occur between the two DoFs are shown. Because of the decoupling property of the PFSM, the 2-DoF motion is treated as a combination of two independent one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) motions and two independent proportional-integral-derivative controllers are thus used separately in the control of the two DoFs. Based on this control strategy, experiments involving both 1-DoF trajectory tracking and 2-DoF trajectory tracking are implemented. The test results show that the proposed PFSM can achieve the tilt range of \u00b17 mrad for both axes with the low coupling ratios that are less than 2% (-34 dB), and the bandwidths of both axes are higher than 810 Hz; in addition, the maximal tracking full scale range errors for 1-DoF trajectory tracking and 2-DoF trajectory tracking are less than 0.2% and 1%, respectively, where the larger error of 2-DoF trajectory tracking is mainly caused by the remaining cross coupling between axes.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2018-06-06", "authors": ["ShubaoShao", "ZhengTian", "SiyangSong", "MinglongXu"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5001966"}

{"title": "Advanced readout methods for superheated emulsion detectors.", "abstract": "Superheated emulsions develop visible vapor bubbles when exposed to ionizing radiation. They consist in droplets of a metastable liquid, emulsified in an inert matrix. The formation of a bubble cavity is accompanied by sound waves. Evaporated bubbles also exhibit a lower refractive index, compared to the inert gel matrix. These two physical phenomena have been exploited to count the number of evaporated bubbles and thus measure the interacting radiation flux. Systems based on piezoelectric transducers have been traditionally used to acquire the acoustic (pressure) signals generated by bubble evaporation. Such systems can operate at ambient noise levels exceeding 100 dB; however, they are affected by a significant dead time (>10 ms). An optical readout technique relying on the scattering of light by neutron-induced bubbles has been recently improved in order to minimize measurement dead time and ambient noise sensitivity. Beams of infra-red light from light-emitting diode (LED) sources cross the active area of the detector and are deflected by evaporated bubbles. The scattered light correlates with bubble density. Planar photodiodes are affixed along the detector length in optimized positions, allowing the detection of scattered light from the bubbles and minimizing the detection of direct light from the LEDs. A low-noise signal-conditioning stage has been designed and realized to amplify the current induced in the photodiodes by scattered light and to subtract the background signal due to intrinsic scattering within the detector matrix. The proposed amplification architecture maximizes the measurement signal-to-noise ratio, yielding a readout uncertainty of 6% (\u00b11 SD), with 1000 evaporated bubbles in a detector active volume of 150 ml (6 cm detector diameter). In this work, we prove that the intensity of scattered light also relates to the bubble size, which can be controlled by applying an external pressure to the detector emulsion. This effect can be exploited during the readout procedure to minimize shadowing effects between bubbles, which become severe when the latter are several thousands. The detector we used in this work is based on superheated C-318 (octafluorocyclobutane), emulsified in 100 \u03bcm \u00b1 10% (1 SD) diameter drops in an inert matrix of approximately 150 ml.

Near complete orexin neurodegeneration depletes orexin-A from the cerebrospinal fluid and produces Na-1. The pathophysiology of Na-2 is less understood but has been hypothesized to be due to less extensive loss of orexin neurotransmission. The orexin-tTA; TetO diphtheria toxin A mouse allows conditional control over the extent and timing of orexin neurodegeneration. To evaluate partial ablation of the orexin field as a model of Na-2, orexin-A positive cell counts and sleep/wake phenotypes (determined by piezoelectric monitoring) were correlated within individual mice after different protocols of diet-controlled neurodegeneration. Partial ablations that began during the first 8 days of study were 14% larger than partial ablations induced during the last 8 days of study, 6 weeks later and prior to sacrifice of all mice, suggesting orexin-A positive cell death continued despite the resumption of conditions intended to keep orexin neurons intact. Sleep/wake of mice with 71.0% orexin-A positive cell loss, initiated at the beginning of study, resembled that of orexin-intact controls more than mice with near complete neurodegeneration. Conversely, mice with 56.6% orexin-A positive cell loss, created at the end of study, had sleep/wake phenotypes that were similar to those of mice with near complete orexin-A positive cell loss.

The full papers were evaluated in detail and categorized as articles on a minimally invasive surgical approach (n=4), endoscopically assisted orthognathic procedures (n=17), or the use of a piezoelectric device in orthognathic surgery (n=25); two articles were each included in two categories. Although a small incision and minimal dissection is the basic principle of a minimally invasive technique, most articles (90.9%) reported the endoscope and piezoelectric instrument as important tools in minimally invasive orthognathic surgery. Evidence from available studies suggests that patients undergoing minimally invasive orthognathic surgery have less morbidity and make a faster recovery.

{"title": "An active-system approach for eliminating the wolf note on a cello.", "abstract": "Wolf notes are generally undesirable sounds that occur in string instruments, particularly in cellos. State-of-the-art passive wolf note eliminators affect the whole cello sound and can become ineffective when environmental conditions and, therefore, the cello's structural properties change. In this paper, an approach is presented that uses smart materials to eliminate the wolf note with little effects to the cello's sound. Based on preliminary measurements, a mathematical model of the cello for generating the wolf note and for developing a wolf note elimination controller is set up. The controller consists of a wolf detection criterion that triggers a velocity feedback controller to actively induce damping into the cello's body whenever a wolf note is detected. The controller setup is experimentally validated by an implementation on a test cello. The velocity feedback to induce the active damping is implemented by means of a piezoelectric patch actuator attached to the cello's body. Both the results of the mathematical model and the results of the experimental investigation show a good performance in eliminating the wolf note on a cello.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2018-06-03", "authors": ["PhilippNeubauer", "JohannesTschesche", "JoachimB\u00f6s", "TobiasMelz", "HolgerHanselka"], "doi": "10.1121/1.5037467"}
{"title": "Design and optimization of piezoelectric unimorph beams with distributed excitation.", "abstract": "A method is presented to design an optimal unimorph beam that flexes and generates voltage in response to a distributed load acting over its length using an analytical model. The objective is to design a beam that resonates at a specified frequency at which there is a peak in the excitation. The associated open-circuit voltage sensitivity and gain bandwidth product are functions to be maximized. For specific boundary conditions and pairs of materials, the dimensional ratio of the thickness of the piezoelectric layer to the square of the length of the beam is chosen such that the beam resonates at the specified frequency. The two optimum values of the dimensionless ratio of the thicknesses of the elastic and piezoelectric layers associated with the maximum values of the two functions of interest are determined through a simple one-dimensional search. Figures of merit and numerical results are used to show the effect of boundary conditions and properties of materials on the functions of interest. All beams with the optimum ratio of thicknesses are equally good and the dimensions of a beam for a specific application are to be chosen by considering principles of design for manufacture and the external electronic circuit.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2018-06-03", "authors": ["Minu APillai", "D DEbenezer", "EzhilarasiDeenadayalan"], "doi": "10.1121/1.5034465"}
{"title": "Tuning the synchronization of a network of weakly coupled self-oscillating gels via capacitors.", "abstract": "We consider a network of coupled oscillating units, where each unit comprises a self-oscillating polymer gel undergoing the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction and an overlaying piezoelectric (PZ) cantilever. Through chemo-mechano-electrical coupling, the oscillations of the networked BZ-PZ units achieve in-phase or anti-phase synchronization, enabling, for example, the storage of information within the system. Herein, we develop numerical and computational models to show that the introduction of capacitors into the BZ-PZ system enhances the dynamical behavior of the oscillating network by yielding additional stable synchronization modes. We specifically show that the capacitors lead to a redistribution of charge in the system and alteration of the force that the PZ cantilevers apply to the underlying gel. Hence, the capacitors modify the strength of the coupling between the oscillators in the network. We utilize a linear stability analysis to determine the phase behavior of BZ-PZ networks encompassing different capacitances, force polarities, and number of units and then verify our findings with numerical simulations. Thus, through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we determine the impact of the capacitors on the existence of the synchronization modes, their stability, and the rate of synchronization within these complex dynamical systems. The findings from our study can be used to design robotic materials that harness the materials' intrinsic, responsive properties to perform such functions as sensing, actuation, and information storage.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2018-06-03", "authors": ["YanFang", "Victor VYashin", "Samuel JDickerson", "Anna CBalazs"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5026589"}

{"title": "Lithium Niobate Phononic Crystals for Tailoring Performance of RF Laterally Vibrating Devices.", "abstract": "This paper reports the first demonstration of phononic crystals (PnCs) in suspended lithium niobate thin films, which exhibit band gaps for tailoring the performance of laterally vibrating devices. Transmission and reflection properties of lithium niobate PnCs for both shear-horizontal (SH0) and length-extensional (S0) modes have been investigated and subsequently explored in two applications. In the first case, PnC-embedded delay lines were designed for filtering with stopbands, while in the second case, PnC-bounded resonators were implemented for spurious mode suppression. Equivalent circuit models incorporating acoustic scattering parameters of the designed PnCs and Mason's model of the transducers have been built for each application. Benchmarked to reference devices without PnCs, the measured PnCs embedded in delay lines show 20-dB attenuation in the stopbands and less than 2-dB loss in the passbands for the SH0 mode, and 30-dB attenuation in the stopbands and less than 10-dB loss in the passbands for the S0 mode. The fabricated piezoelectric PnC-bounded resonator has shown a quality factor of 434 at 142.7 MHz with undesired spurious modes significantly suppressed.

Two kinds of typical phase separated morphologies are prepared: interfabrillar (70/30 PBA/PVDF) and interlamellar (50/50 PBA/PVDF) morphologies. After melt recrystallization at 10 \u00b0C, \u03b2-PBA crystals are obtained. The thermal expansion, phase transition and melting behavior of \u03b2 crystals highly depend on the phase separated morphology. The \u03b2 crystals show the highest melting temperature and \u03b2-to-\u03b1 phase transition temperature in 70% PBA, which is caused by the thick lamellae of PBA and/or the lower surface energy of chain folding, while the \u03b2 crystals show the lowest melting temperature and \u03b2-to-\u03b1 phase transition temperature in 50% PBA, which is caused by the thinner lamellae of PBA. An unexpectedly high melting temperature of \u03b1 crystals transited from \u03b2 crystals observed in 50% PBA due to the lamellar thickening occuring in the heating process. The different phase separated morphologies lead to different lamellae thicknesses and surface energies of chain folding which consequently alter the stability of the crystals.

It is important to determine the strain relaxation in these structures for device design and better prediction of device characteristics and performance. We have determined the strain relaxation in InGaN/GaN nanowalls from quantum confinement and exciton binding energy dependent photoluminescence peak. We have further determined the strain relaxation as a function of nanowall dimension. With a decrease in nanowall dimension, the lateral quantum confinement and exciton binding energy increase and the InGaN layer becomes partially strain relaxed which decreases the piezoelectric polarization field. The reduced polarization field decreases quantum confined Stark effect along the c-axis and increases electron-hole wave-function overlap which further increases the exciton binding energy. The strong dependency of the exciton binding energy on strain is used to determine the strain relaxation in these nanostructures. An analytical model based on fractional dimension for GaN/InGaN/GaN heterostructures along with self-consistent simulation of Schrodinger and Poisson equations are used to theoretically correlate them.

In order to eliminate the step loss and increase the step size when an external load is applied, the power-function-shape driving signal was used to actuate the rotary motor. According to the step characteristics under this driving signal, two motion modes were observed and defined, namely the stick-shoot motion mode and the stick-slip-shoot motion mode. The former motion mode can realize a large step size while the later one cannot due to the slipping during the rising phase. After analyzing the results from the numerical simulation and the experiment study, it was found that the motion performance of the motor is closely related to the preload and the base number of the driving signal rather than the size of SPAs, which means the motor can be further downsized according to its actual requirements.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-05-31", "authors": ["BoZhang", "FangxinChen", "HaiyangLi", "ZhijiangDu", "LiningSun", "WeiDong"], "doi": "10.3390/ma11060918\n10.1049/mnl.2011.0477\n10.1109/TRO.2013.2288800\n10.1109/JMEMS.2003.823236\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2015.04.016\n10.1063/1.1139566\n10.1016/S0736-5845(02)00065-0\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2004.09.049\n10.1109/TMECH.2008.2006756\n10.1063/1.4960838\n10.1063/1.1143290\n10.1007/s00170-011-3827-z\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.10.015\n10.1007/s00419-014-0940-0"}

The determination of corrosion layer thickness below \u223c100\u202f\u00b5m has been demonstrated by both methods, in comparison with X-CT and SEM. With electron microscopic examination, it is found that with multilayer corrosion structure formed over a prolonged corrosion time, the ultrasonic NDT methods can only reliably reveal outer corrosion layer thickness because of the resulting acoustic contrast among the multiple layers due to their respective different mechanical parameters. A time-frequency signal analysis algorithm is employed to effectively enhance the high frequency ultrasonic signal contrast for the piezoelectric pulse-echo method.

A piezoelectric wafer emits a broadband excitation, linear chirp signal to generate guided waves in the plate. The propagating waves are measured at discrete locations along the lines for one-dimensional laser Doppler vibrometer (1-D LDV). Measurements are first Fourier transformed into either wavenumber-time k-t domain or space-frequency x-\u03c9 domain.

Other experiments on a thicker aluminum plate for higher modes and a composite plate are analyzed by MP method.

{"title": "High Piezoelectric Conversion Properties of Axial InGaN/GaN Nanowires.", "abstract": "We demonstrate for the first time the efficient mechanical-electrical conversion properties of InGaN/GaN nanowires (NWs). Using an atomic force microscope equipped with a modified Resiscope module, we analyse the piezoelectric energy generation of GaN NWs and demonstrate an important enhancement when integrating in their volume a thick In-rich InGaN insertion. The piezoelectric response of InGaN/GaN NWs can be tuned as a function of the InGaN insertion thickness and position in the NW volume. The energy harvesting is favoured by the presence of a PtSi/GaN Schottky diode which allows to efficiently collect the piezo-charges generated by InGaN/GaN NWs. Average output voltages up to 330 \u00b1 70 mV and a maximum value of 470 mV per NW has been measured for nanostructures integrating 70 nm-thick InGaN insertion capped with a thin GaN top layer.

Current research is focused on novel strategies relating to the electrode array, aiming to improve the neuronal health and spatial selectivity, and reduce the power consumption. Future design iterations will most likely improve the neuronal health by reducing insertion trauma, minimizing the inflammatory pathway that follows electrode insertion or through the use of neurotrophins or stem cells. Improvements in spatial selectivity and in speech recognition in difficult listening environments can be achieved through changes in the electrode/neural interface. Designing an array that brings the electrodes closer to neural tissue, or changing the method of stimulation with current steering or even optical or piezoelectric stimulation are discussed. Increasing the MRI compatibility is an important consideration, and devices allowing remote programming have a huge impact on worldwide provision. Technology exists to realize the elusive goal of a fully implantable cochlear implant, allowing continuous and invisible hearing.

{"title": "Phosphotriesterase-Magnetic Nanoparticle Bioconjugates with Improved Enzyme Activity in a Biocatalytic Membrane Reactor.", "abstract": "The need to find alternative bioremediation solutions for organophosphate degradation pushed the research to develop technologies based on organophosphate degrading enzymes, such as phosphotriesterase. The use of free phosphotriesterase poses limits in terms of enzyme reuse, stability, and process development. The heterogenization of enzyme on a support and their use in bioreactors implemented by membranes seems a suitable strategy, thanks to the ability of membranes to compartmentalize, to govern mass transfer, and to provide a microenvironment with tuned physicochemical and structural properties. Usually, hydrophilic membranes are used since they easily guarantee the presence of water molecules needed for the enzyme catalytic activity. However, hydrophobic materials exhibit a larger shelf life and are preferred for the construction of filters and masks. Therefore, in this work, hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) porous membranes were used to develop biocatalytic membrane reactors (BMR). The phosphotriesterase-like lactonase (PLL) enzyme ( SsoPox triple mutant from S. solfataricus) endowed with thermostable phosphotriesterase activity was used as model biocatalyst. The enzyme was covalently bound directly to the PVDF hydrophobic membrane or it was bound to magnetic nanoparticles and then positioned on the hydrophobic membrane surface by means of an external magnetic field. Investigation of kinetic properties of the two BMRs and the influence of immobilized enzyme amount revealed that the performance of the BMR was mostly dependent on the amount of enzyme and its distribution on the immobilization support. Magnetic nanocomposite mediated immobilization showed a much better performance, with an observed specific activity higher than 90% compared to grafting of the enzyme on the membrane. Even though the present work focused on phosphotriesterase, it can be easily translated to other classes of enzymes and related applications.", "journal": "Bioconjugate chemistry", "date": "2018-05-25", "authors": ["Abaynesh YihdegoGebreyohannes", "RosalindaMazzei", "Mohamed YahiaMarei Abdelrahim", "GiuseppeVitola", "ElenaPorzio", "GiuseppeManco", "MihailBarboiu", "LidiettaGiorno"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00214"}

{"title": "The Influence of Shape on the Output Potential of ZnO Nanostructures: Sensitivity to Parallel versus Perpendicular Forces.", "abstract": "With the consistent shrinking of devices, micro-systems are, nowadays, widely used in areas such as biomedics, electronics, automobiles, and measurement devices. As devices shrunk, so too did their energy consumptions, opening the way for the use of nanogenerators (NGs) as power sources. In particular, to harvest energy from an object's motion (mechanical vibrations, torsional forces, or pressure), present NGs are mainly composed of piezoelectric materials in which, upon an applied compressive or strain force, an electrical field is produced that can be used to power a device. The focus of this work is to simulate the piezoelectric effect in different ZnO nanostructures to optimize the output potential generated by a nanodevice. In these simulations, cylindrical nanowires, nanomushrooms, and nanotrees were created, and the influence of the nanostructures' shape on the output potential was studied as a function of applied parallel and perpendicular forces. The obtained results demonstrated that the output potential is linearly proportional to the applied force and that perpendicular forces are more efficient in all structures. However, nanotrees were found to have an increased sensitivity to parallel applied forces, which resulted in a large enhancement of the output efficiency. These results could then open a new path to increase the efficiency of piezoelectric nanogenerators.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-05-24", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9Cardoso", "Filipe FOliveira", "Mariana PProenca", "Jo\u00e3oVentura"], "doi": "10.3390/nano8050354\n10.1002/adfm.201401998\n10.1002/adma.201500121\n10.1021/nl3003039\n10.1021/nn402477h\n10.1039/C3EE43987A\n10.1038/nmat2090\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.01.020\n10.1021/nn404614z\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.09.038\n10.1021/acsnano.7b05203\n10.1126/science.1124005\n10.1021/nl8027813\n10.1021/nl100812k\n10.1002/adma.201102067\n10.1002/adfm.201302157\n10.1002/pssa.201431625\n10.1038/nnano.2010.46\n10.1088/0034-4885/72/12/126501\n10.1016/j.matchar.2011.11.017\n10.1016/j.jphotochem.2010.02.004\n10.1039/c3nr34013a\n10.1021/jp035562u\n10.1155/2014/609262\n10.1063/1.354152\n10.1007/s10853-016-9850-6\n10.1002/pssr.201307187\n10.1109/TNANO.2014.2319097\n10.1039/C4RA09163A\n10.1166/jnn.2016.10729\n10.3390/nano7120430\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.02.071\n10.1007/s12274-009-9063-2\n10.1002/adma.201103727\n10.1021/nl071310j\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/11/115024\n10.1088/0957-4484/22/26/265712\n10.1063/1.3462468\n10.1021/nl104004d\n10.1063/1.3125449\n10.1021/nl803547f\n10.1002/adma.200601162"}

The diode was constructed on top of a piezoelectric LiNbO3 substrate and composed of p-type black phosphorus (BP) and n-type molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) flakes that partly overlapped with each other. This layout facilitated the applied SAWs to rapidly drive carriers out of the depletion region. In this structural design, SAWs promoted the separation of photogenerated carriers, and thus greatly increased the photocurrent. The measured photocurrent for the device with SAWs was about 103 times higher than that of the device without SAWs. The device using SAWs showed a photoresponsivity as high as 2.17 A W-1 at the wavelength of 582 nm. This excellent performance was attributed to the SAWs suppressing electron-hole recombination in the device under light illumination.

However, their direct crystallization from the melt state represents a challenging task that has never been addressed using melt-state processes. The use of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is herein investigated to promote the PVDF polar \u03b2-phase using melt-blending and extrusion-calendering technologies. The presence of the \u03b2-phase is here confirmed by ATR-FTIR and WAXS experiments with blends at a PMMA content as low as 5 wt%. The key role of PMMA for the \u03b2-phase crystallization from the melt state was unambiguously highlighted with the help of Flash DSC experiments in non-isothermal cooling mode from the melt state. PMMA is able to efficiently shift the \u03b1-to-\u03b2 crystal transition to lower cooling rates (>100-200 \u00b0C s-1), making the achievement of the PVDF polar \u03b2-phase for these blends compatible with conventional processing tools. A crystal phase diagram is proposed for the PVDF/PMMA blends to highlight the dual effects of both PMMA and cooling rate on the PVDF crystallization during melt-processing. Ferroelectric properties were even observed for the blends containing PMMA up to 10 wt% with the highest remanent polarization obtained at 5 wt% PMMA. After 10 wt% PMMA, a progressive transition from ferroelectric to pseudo-linear dielectric behavior is observed more likely due to the presence of PMMA in the interlamellar amorphous phase of the polar PVDF spherulites as shown by SAXS experiments.

The piezoelectric property of 2D ZnO works on mechanical strain, which disrupts the structure of ZnO leading to the failure of the device. For a pyroelectric nanogenerator, the temperature difference can be triggered by an external light source, which does not disrupt the ZnO structure and also avoids the need for physical bending/pressing, as in the case of a piezoelectric nanogenerator. This work represents the first demonstration of the fabrication of a flexible 2D ZnO/Gr pyro-phototronic diode where the pyro-potential generated in the 2D ZnO due to the near infrared (NIR) illumination adds to or subtracts from the built-in electric field of the heterojunction and modulates the depletion region of the heterojunction thereby enabling bias-free operation. Furthermore, the variation in the depletion width of the heterojunction was utilized as a variable capacitor in the frequency modulator, wherein, with the increasing intensity, the frequency of oscillations increased from 9.8 to 10.42 MHz.

The equivalence of 5 and 10years was respectively selected as the time of aging. The physicochemical evolutions of membrane aging are characterized on the base of morphology analysis, chemical components, permeation ability and mechanical properties. The aging of NIPS-PVDF membrane led to the elimination of surface hydrophilic additives, while NaOH focused on the dehydrofluorination process resulting in the formation of conjugated chains of polyene on the skeleton structure. The chemical components of the surface of TIPS-PVDF membrane were removed continuously during the aging processes of both NaClO and NaOH, which was caused by the saponification of surface additives and the chain scissions of skeleton structure, but without producing any obvious conjugated chains of polyene. All the aging processes led to the increase of contact angle and the decrease of mechanical properties, and the permeability was reduced first and increased later due to the enlargement of surface membrane pores and membrane block.

The conventional model for the radiation force used in the SSAW-based applications is developed in plane standing waves, which fails to predict the movement of the cylinder in the SSAW. Our revised model reveals that, in the direction normal to the piezoelectric substrate on which the SSAW is generated, acoustic radiation force can be large enough to drive the cylinder even in the long-wavelength limit. Furthermore, the force in this direction can not only push the cylinder away, but also pull it back toward the substrate. In the direction parallel to the substrate, the equilibrium positions for particles can be actively tuned by changing Rayleigh angle. As an example considered in the paper, with the reduction of Rayleigh angle the equilibrium positions for steel cylinders in water change from pressure nodes to pressure antinodes. The model can thus be used in the design of SSAWs for particle manipulations.", "journal": "Physical review.

Thirty patients participated in this randomized clinical trial and received two implants in posterior mandible in bone of the same quality. All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon. Implant stability amounts were measured by resonance frequency analysis using the Osstell Mentor device and are reported in the format of implant stability quotient (ISQ) values at baseline and 90 and 150 days after surgery. All implants were well osseointegrated. Differences in ISQ levels were statistically significant in the piezosurgery group at all time intervals, whereas those in the conventional drill group were not significant as analyzed by analysis of variance. The significance of differences between the two groups in each time interval was assessed with Student's t test. In the second interval (90 days), there were statistically significant differences in ISQ levels between the two groups at the buccal, lingual side of implants and mean of two measurements, but at baseline and 150 days, there were no significant differences between these techniques. The early increase of ISQ values in piezoelectric sites shows that piezosurgery is a less traumatic bone osteotomy method with a shorter inflammatory phase and little resorption compared with sites prepared by conventional drilling. ISQ values of up to 60-65 at the time of insertion of the implant predict a good prognosis for immediate implant loading. In this study, the ISQ values were almost always higher than this, offering the safe condition for immediate or early loading protocols after the piezoelectric method of implant site osteotomy. These results may increase predictability of immediate-loading procedure in oral implantology.", "journal": "Journal of long-term effects of medical implants", "date": "2018-05-19", "authors": ["SaraSoheilifar", "MohsenBidgoli", "EhsanHoushyar", "MaryamFarhadian", "AliGhamari"], "doi": "10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.2018020398"}

{"title": "Damage Evaluation of Concrete Column under Impact Load Using a Piezoelectric-Based EMI Technique.", "abstract": "One of the major causes of damage to column-supported concrete structures, such as bridges and highways, are collisions from moving vehicles, such as cars and ships. It is essential to quantify the collision damage of the column so that appropriate actions can be taken to prevent catastrophic events. A widely used method to assess structural damage is through the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) damage index established by the collected data; however, the RMSD index does not truly provide quantitative information about the structure. Conversely, the damage volume ratio that can only be obtained via simulation provides better detail about the level of damage in a structure. Furthermore, as simulation can also provide the RMSD index relating to that particular damage volume ratio, the empirically obtained RMSD index can thus be related to the structural damage degree through comparison of the empirically obtained RMSD index to numerically-obtained RMSD. Thus, this paper presents a novel method in which the impact-induced damage to a structure is simulated in order to obtain the relationship between the damage volume ratio to the RMSD index, and the relationship can be used to predict the true damage degree by comparison to the empirical RMSD index. In this paper, the collision damage of a bridge column by moving vehicles was simulated by using a concrete beam model subjected to continuous impact loadings by a freefalling steel ball. The variation in admittance signals measured by the surface attached lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patches was used to establish the RMSD index. The results demonstrate that the RMSD index and the damage ratio of concrete have a linear relationship for the particular simulation model.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-05-19", "authors": ["ShuliFan", "ShaoyuZhao", "BaoxinQi", "QingzhaoKong"], "doi": "10.3390/s18051591\n10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2007.12.005\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2012.03.026\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.11.011\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/6/065026\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1007/s11340-006-8734-0\n10.1080/09349847.2013.848311\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.148\n10.1177/1045389X13498317\n10.3390/s16091451\n10.3390/s100505193\n10.1155/2013/932568\n10.1080/15732479.2013.831908\n10.1515/eng-2015-0046\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.1016/j.cscm.2016.03.003\n10.1117/12.316923\n10.1299/jsmea.42.249\n10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2000)6:4(153)\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/3/301\n10.1177/1475921717703053\n10.1177/1045389X9500600117\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.074\n10.1177/104538901320560355\n10.3390/s141019897\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095011\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/4/012\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/006\n10.1088/0964-1726/9/4/317\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/4/026\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.12.173\n10.3390/s8010327\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.02.094\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.019\n10.1115/1.2930387\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.1155/2013/218026\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.08.013\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/014\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2012.01.012\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2007)20:1(53)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2007)20:1(63)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2008)21:1(35)\n10.1016/0020-7683(89)90050-4\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9845(199809)27:9<937::AID-EQE764>3.0.CO;2-5"}

The maximum peak voltage of a fiber-based harvester prepared using this approach was 0.056 V. Because the fibers and films were non-toxic biological materials displaying excellent piezoelectric characteristics, we deposited them on glass substrates coated with indium tin oxide to observe their effects on the proliferation of cells. The negative charge of PMLG decreased the proliferation of mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3); indeed, decreasing the interspacing between the fibers slightly decreased the proliferation of these cells.

The main feature of the ShFM system is usage of a piezoelectric bimorph sensor, which has the ability of self-excitation and detection. Moreover, the shear force magnitude as a function of the spring constant of the sensor and setpoint is obtained, which indicates that operation modes can be switched between imaging and manipulation through designing the spring constant before experiment and changing the setpoint during manipulation process, respectively.

{"title": "A Feasibility Study on Timber Damage Detection Using Piezoceramic-Transducer-Enabled Active Sensing.", "abstract": "In recent years, piezoelectric-based transducers and technologies have made significant progress towards structural health monitoring and damage evaluation for various metal and concrete structures. Timber is still commonly used as a construction material in practical engineering; however, there is a lack of research on the health monitoring of timber-based structures using piezoelectric-based transducers and methods. This paper conducts a feasibility study on timber damage detection using surface-mounted piezoelectric patches, which enable the stress-wave-based active sensing approach. Typical damage modes in timber frame structures, such as surface cracks and holes, were investigated in this study. In the active sensing approach, one piezoceramic transducer is used as an actuator to generate stress waves, which propagate along the surface of the timber structure, and other piezoceramic transducers function as sensors to detect the propagating stress waves. Defects, such as a crack or a hole, induce additional attenuation to the propagating stress wave. Based on this attenuation, the proposed method can detect the defects using the wavelet-packet-based damage index, demonstrating its implementation potential for real-time timber damage detection.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-05-16", "authors": ["JichengZhang", "YongshuiHuang", "YuZheng"], "doi": "10.3390/s18051563\n10.3390/rs8110935\n10.3390/app7080789\n10.3390/s100505193\n10.3390/s17071641\n10.3390/ma3125169\n10.1016/j.jsv.2013.09.033\n10.3390/s141019897\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2001)127:4(418)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2001)127:4(426)\n10.1007/s10086-005-0769-9\n10.1007/s10086-006-0881-5\n10.1007/s10086-005-0783-y\n10.1007/BF00831348\n10.1007/s100860300022\n10.1007/BF03027066\n10.3390/s16101765\n10.1007/s00226-010-0357-z\n10.1016/S0963-8695(97)00039-X\n10.1617/s11527-013-0095-4\n10.3390/app6100298\n10.1177/1045389X14566525\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2302893\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/11/115019\n10.1155/2015/821395\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/1/004\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2002)15:3(97)\n10.1177/1077546307078752\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.04.020\n10.1177/1045389X12461080\n10.3390/s140304755\n10.1177/1045389X14536010\n10.3390/s17122796\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.569-570.805\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/018\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/6/065002\n10.1155/2015/695845\n10.3390/s17092001\n10.3390/s16081343\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/087001\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80bc\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80ef\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/3/037002\n10.3390/s17081812\n10.3390/app6110320\n10.3390/s17020250\n10.3390/s17040776\n10.3390/s17112467\n10.3390/app7040362\n10.3390/app6110341\n10.1080/19475411.2015.1089525\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/020\n10.1177/1475921715591876\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2007)133:8(1080)\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/2/310\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/085025\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2624799\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2691540\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085021\n10.1002/adma.201702308\n10.1063/1.4976803\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2002)128:10(1354)\n10.1080/19475411.2013.836577\n10.1016/j.marstruc.2015.10.003\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2660301"}

Less is known about the piezoelectric properties of its building blocks, in particular but not limited to, proline and hydroxyproline. Spurred by the recent upsurge of interest in piezoelectricity in organic crystals including our own report of unprecedentedly high piezoelectricity in amino acid glycine, we predict and measure the piezoelectric properties of collagen subcomponents in single crystalline forms and the collagen-like alanine-hydroxyproline-glycine trimer peptide. We map the modulation of piezoelectric charge constants in collagen building blocks as the crystal symmetry is lowered and the molecule size increases, finding strong evidence for amino acid-level barcoding of collagen piezoelectricity that can in turn be tuned using very simple chemistry. The simple addition of an -OH group can increase piezoelectric constants by up to two orders of magnitude (d25 = 25 \u00b1 5 pC N-1) as measured in Y-cut hydroxyproline crystals. The value is similar to that obtained from thermoelectrically poled commercial polyvinylidene di fluoride (PVDF) films.

Reports published by WHO indicate that in 2017 about 6.3 million people progressed to TB and 53 million TB patients died from 2000 to 2016. Therefore, early diagnosis of the disease is of great importance for global health care programs. Common diagnostics like the traditional PPD test and antibody-assisted assays suffer the lack of sensitivity, long processing time and cumbersome post-test proceedings. These shortcomings restrict their use and encourage innovations in TB diagnostics. In recent years, the biosensor concept opened up new horizons in sensitive and fast detection of the disease, reducing the interval time between sampling and diagnostic result. Among new diagnostics, label-free nano-biosensors are highly promising for sensitive and accessible detection of tuberculosis.

In the paper, a variant of the so-called Transfer Impedance (TI) approach to SHM is followed. Signal characteristics, called the Damage Indices (DIs), were proposed for data presentation and analysis. The idea underlying the definition of DIs was to maintain most of the information carried by the voltage induced on PZT sensors by elastic waves. In particular, the DIs proposed in the paper should be sensitive to all types of damage which can influence the amplitude or the phase of the voltage induced on the sensor. Properties of the proposed DIs were investigated experimentally using a GFRP composite panel equipped with PZT networks attached to its surface and embedded into its internal structure. Repeatability and stability of DI indications under controlled conditions were verified in tests. Also, some performance indicators for surface-attached and structure-embedded sensors were obtained. The DIs' behavior was dependent mostly on the presence of a simulated damage in the structure. Anisotropy of mechanical properties of the specimen, geometrical properties of PZT network as well as, to some extent, the technology of sensor integration with the structure were irrelevant for damage indication.

{"title": "Enhanced damage imaging of a metallic plate using matching pursuit algorithm with multiple wavepaths.", "abstract": "Waveforms received by sensors resulting from multiple wavepaths overlap and are hard to interpret. Because of this difficulty, they are usually intentionally ignored, thereby only the first arrival of wave mode being used for damage localization. This article proposes an imaging algorithm for damage localization by incorporating multiple wavepaths using piezoelectric wafers affixed on a metallic plate. Matching pursuit (MP) algorithm to enhance image quality is adopted for separating each wave packet individually. MP algorithm is an adaptive time-frequency signal decomposition technique that matches the best-fit elementary atom functions from an overcomplete dictionary. This study proposes a new dictionary composed of atom functions that constitute possible wave packets propagated by an excitation of Hann-windowed toneburst. The proposed dictionary converges faster and separates individual wave packets more accurately than typical Gaussian based dictionaries. Simulated studies first confirm the performance of MP algorithm with the proposed dictionary in comparison with those using conventional non-adaptive time-frequency analysis as well as MP with heuristic Gaussian-based dictionaries. The results of this study validate the proposed algorithm that multiple wavepaths can localize the damage with three to four piezoelectric wafers versus typical approaches employing only primary scattered waves.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2018-05-12", "authors": ["Ho-WukKim", "Fuh-GwoYuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2018.01.014"}

Here, a superhydrophilic PVDF membrane (PVDF@PDA-GSH) was fabricated using a facile, versatile, mussel-inspired method. The pristine PVDF membrane was coated with dopamine under mild alkaline conditions by a dip-coating method, followed by addition of glutathione (GSH) via a simple reaction. GSH was successfully coated onto the membrane surface and confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Hierarchical surface structure and superhydrophilicity were examined by scanning electron microscopy and contact angle, respectively, giving the PVDF@PDA-GSH membrane excellent wettability and antifouling ability. The water flux of PVDF@PDA-GSH was several-fold higher than conventional filtration membranes, and the oil rejection ratio was nearly 99%. The PVDF@PDA-GSH membrane also showed favorable reusability because the flux recovery ratio (FRR) remained above 90% after five cycles.

In the network, the configuration of the nanotubes is various. A carbon nanotube may be curled or straight, and it may be parallel or crossed to another. As a result, carbon nanotube-based composites exhibit integrated characteristics of inductor, capacitor and resistor. In this work, it is hypothesised that carbon nanotube-based composites all adhere to a RLC interior circuit. To verify the hypothesis, three different composites, viz multi-walled carbon nanotube/polyvinylidene fluoride (MWCNT/PVDF), multi-walled carbon nanotube/epoxy (MWCNT/EP), multi-walled carbon nanotube/polydimethylsiloxane (MWCNT/PDMS) were fabricated and tested. The resistances and the dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) of the materials were measured in direct and alternating currents. The measurement shows that the value of tan\u03b4 is highly affected by the volume fraction of MWCNT in the composites. The experimental results prove that the proposed RLC equivalent circuit model can fully describe the electrical properties of the MWCNT network in nanocomposites. The RLC model provides a new route to detect the inductance and capacitance of carbon nanotubes.

Transient analyses were accomplished by ANSYS software to simulate the motion trajectory of the driving foot and to find the response characteristics. A prototype was manufactured to verify the mechanism and to test the mechanical characteristics. A minimum resolution of 0.095 &mu;rad and a maximum torque of 49 N&middot;mm were achieved by the prototype, and the output speed was varied by changing the driving voltage and working frequency.

For surface acoustic wave devices, microelectromechanical/nanoelectromechanical systems, and phononic crystals, tailoring the spatial variation of material properties such as piezoelectric and elastic tensors may bring significant improvements to the system performance. Due to the much slower speed of sound than speed of light in solids, it is desirable to study various electroacoustic behaviors at the mesoscopic length scale. In this work, we demonstrate the interferometric imaging of electromechanical power transduction in ferroelectric lithium niobate domain structures by microwave impedance microscopy. In sharp contrast to the traditional standing-wave patterns caused by the superposition of counterpropagating waves, the constructive and destructive fringes in microwave dissipation images exhibit an intriguing one-wavelength periodicity. We show that such unusual interference patterns, which are fundamentally different from the acoustic displacement fields, stem from the nonlocal interaction between electric fields and elastic waves. The results are corroborated by numerical simulations taking into account the sign reversal of piezoelectric tensor in oppositely polarized domains.

In order to overcome this problem, an optical fiber Sagnac interferometer system is proposed for partial discharge ultrasound detection. Optical fiber sensing and time-frequency analysis of the ultrasonic signals excited by the piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer is realized for the first time. The effective frequency band of the Sagnac interferometer system was up to 175 kHz with the help of a designed 10 kV partial discharge simulator device. Using the cumulative histogram method, the characteristic ultrasonic frequency band of the partial discharges was between 28.9 kHz and 57.6 kHz for this optical fiber partial discharge detection system.

The transducers are, respectively, structures utilizing top and bottom electrodes (TBEs) and interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). While the theory is well developed for the TBE beam, governing equations for the bending of the piezoelectric beams with IDEs are far less developed. We improve on this by deriving the governing equation for the IDE beam with an arbitrary number of layers and with coupling consistently included. In addition, we introduce a phenomenological quadratic form for the nonuniform field that lets us derive a deflection formula with nontrivial effects of the field accounted for. The theory is applied to derive deflection formulas for both cantilever and clamped-clamped beams. All analytic results are validated with numerical simulations. From the analytic models, two different figures of merit (FOMs) are derived. We show that these FOMs are the same for cantilevers and doubly clamped beams. The analysis indicates the optimal transducer length for clamped-clamped beams and gives a criterion that can be used to determine which design concept ( or ) gives the largest deflection.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2018-05-08", "authors": ["Cuong HNguyen", "UlrikHanke", "EinarHalvorsen"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2808239"}

In this study, a porous lead zirconate titanate (PZT) membrane is presented that enables in situ ultrasound generation by the application of an alternating voltage (AV) to mitigate fouling during oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion separation. We expect that this method is much more cost-effective because it is more direct, avoiding buildup of fouling and the need to take the membrane offline. Because the PZT membrane is hydrophilic, its underwater surface is oleophobic so that the accumulated oil droplets will have little affinity and hence can be removed easily by in situ-generated US. The effect of the in situ US generation on membrane fouling was investigated through variation in the excitation AV and its frequency, O/W emulsion pH, emulsified oil concentration, crossflow velocity, and transmembrane pressure. The results indicated that the in situ US generation resulted in a substantial decrease of fouling during the filtration process of O/W emulsions, whereas the membrane flux was maintained closely at its initial value.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2018-05-08", "authors": ["HengyangMao", "MinghuiQiu", "JiaweiBu", "XianfuChen", "HenkVerweij", "YiqunFan"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.8b03951"}

{"title": "Surface potential-governed cellular osteogenic differentiation on ferroelectric polyvinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene films.", "abstract": "Surface potential of biomaterials can dramatically influence cellular osteogenic differentiation. In this work, a wide range of surface potential on ferroelectric polyvinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) films was designed to get insight into the interfacial interaction of cell-charged surface. The P(VDF-TrFE) films poled by contact electric poling at various electric fields obtained well stabilized surface potential, with wide range from -3 to 915\u202fmV. The osteogenic differentiation level of cells cultured on the films was strongly dependent on surface potential and reached the optimum at 391\u202fmV in this system. Binding specificity assay indicated that surface potential could effectively govern the binding state of the adsorbed fibronectin (FN) with integrin. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation further revealed that surface potential brought a significant difference in the relative distance between RGD and synergy PHSRN sites of adsorbed FN, resulting in a distinct integrin-FN binding state. These results suggest that the full binding of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 with both RGD and PHSRN sites of FN possesses a strong ability to activate osteogenic signaling pathway. This work sheds light on the underlying mechanism of osteogenic differentiation behavior on charged material surfaces, and also provides a guidance for designing a reasonable charged surface to enhance osteogenic differentiation.\nThe ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) films with steady and a wide range of surface potential were designed to understand underlying mechanism of cell-charged surface interaction. The results showed that the charged surface well favored upregulation of osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, and more importantly, a highest level occurred on the film with a moderate surface potential. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the surface potential could govern fibronectin conformation and then the integrin-fibronectin binding. We propose that a full binding state of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 with fibronectin induces effective activation of integrin-mediated FAK/ERK signaling pathway to upregulate cellular osteogenic differentiation.

{"title": "Frequency-dependent shear properties of annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus by magnetic resonance elastography.", "abstract": "Aging and degeneration are associated with changes in mechanical properties in the intervertebral disc, generating interest in the establishment of mechanical properties as early biomarkers for the degenerative cascade. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) of the intervertebral disc is usually limited to the nucleus pulposus, as the annulus fibrosus is stiffer and less hydrated. The objective of this work was to adapt high-frequency needle MRE to the characterization of the shear modulus of both the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus. Bovine intervertebral discs were removed from fresh oxtails and characterized by needle MRE. The needle was inserted in the center of the disc and vibrations were generated by an amplified piezoelectric actuator. MRE acquisitions were performed on a 4.7-T small-animal MR scanner using a spin echo sequence with sinusoidal motion encoding gradients. Acquisitions were repeated over a frequency range of 1000-1800\u00a0Hz. The local frequency estimation inversion algorithm was used to compute the shear modulus. Stiffness maps allowed the visualization of the soft nucleus pulposus surrounded by the stiffer annulus fibrosus surrounded by the homogeneous gel. A significant difference in shear modulus between the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus, and an increase in the shear modulus with excitation frequency, were observed, in agreement with the literature. This study demonstrates that global characterization of both the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc is possible with needle MRE using a preclinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. MRE can be a powerful method for the mapping of the complex properties of the intervertebral disc.

Various polymorphs with unusual properties are routinely synthesized by compression under positive pressure. However, changing a material's structure by applying tension under negative pressure is much more difficult. We show how negative-pressure polymorphs can be synthesized by mixing materials with different crystal structures-a general approach that should be applicable to many materials. Theoretical calculations suggest that it costs less energy to mix low-density structures than high-density structures, due to less competition for space between the atoms. Proof-of-concept experiments confirm that mixing two different high-density forms of MnSe and MnTe stabilizes a Mn(Se,Te) alloy with a low-density wurtzite structure. This Mn(Se,Te) negative-pressure polymorph has 2\u00d7 to 4\u00d7 lower electron effective mass compared to MnSe and MnTe parent compounds and has a piezoelectric response that none of the parent compounds have. This example shows how heterostructural alloying can lead to negative-pressure polymorphs with useful properties-materials that are otherwise nearly impossible to make.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2018-05-05", "authors": ["SebastianSiol", "AaronHolder", "JamesSteffes", "Laura TSchelhas", "Kevin HStone", "LaurenGarten", "John DPerkins", "Philip AParilla", "Michael FToney", "Bryan DHuey", "WilliamTumas", "StephanLany", "AndriyZakutayev"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.aaq1442"}

{"title": "Injection locking of optomechanical oscillators via acoustic waves.", "abstract": "Injection locking is an effective technique for synchronization of oscillator networks and controlling the phase and frequency of individual oscillators. As such, exploring new mechanisms for injection locking of emerging oscillators is important for their usage in various systems. Here, we present the first demonstration of injection locking of a radiation pressure driven optomechanical oscillator (OMO) via acoustic waves. As opposed to previously reported techniques (based on pump modulation or direct application of a modulated electrostatic force), injection locking of OMO via acoustic waves does not require optical power modulation or physical contact with the OMO and it can be easily implemented on various platforms to lock different types of OMOs independent of their size and structure. Using this approach we have locked the phase and frequency of two distinct modes of a microtoroidal silica OMO to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). We have characterized the behavior of the injection locked OMO with three acoustic excitation configurations and showed that even without proper acoustic impedance, matching the OMO can be locked to the PZT and tuned over 17 kHz with only -30 dBm of RF power fed to the PZT. The high efficiency, simplicity, and scalability of the proposed approach paves the road toward a new class of photonic systems that rely on synchronization of several OMOs to a single or multiple RF oscillators with applications in optical communication, metrology, and sensing. Beyond its practical applications, injection locking via acoustic waves can be used in fundamental studies in quantum optomechanics where thermal and optical isolation of the OMO are critical.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2018-05-03", "authors": ["KeHuang", "ManiHossein-Zadeh"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.26.008275"}

Longer pulse duration conditions yielded significant increase in transgene expression relative to sham with local maxima between 20\u202fJ and 100\u202fJ energy curves. A similar set of 17 conditions (n\u202f=\u202f4/cond.) was tested in mice using pulse durations spanning 18\u202f\u03bcs-22\u202fms and PNPs spanning 0.5-2.5\u202fMPa. We observed local maxima located between 1\u202fJ and 10\u202fJ energy curves in treated mice. Of these, several low pressure conditions showed a decrease in ALT and AST levels while maintaining better or comparable expression to our positive control, indicating a clear benefit to allow for effective transfection with minimized tissue damage versus the high-intensity control. Our data indicates that it is possible to eliminate the requirement of high PNPs by prolonging pulse durations for effective UMGD in vitro and in vivo, circumventing the peak power density limitations imposed by piezo-materials used in US transducers. Overall, these results demonstrate the advancement of UMGD technology for achieving efficient gene transfer and potential scalability to larger animal models and human application.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2018-04-28", "authors": ["Dominic MTran", "JamesHarrang", "ShuxianSong", "JeremyChen", "Bryn MSmith", "Carol HMiao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.012"}

{"title": "Broadband graphene-based photoacoustic microscopy with high sensitivity.", "abstract": "Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) enables the measurement of properties associated with optical absorption within tissues and complements sophisticated technologies employing optical microscopy. An inadequate frequency response as determined by a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer results, however, in poor depth resolution and inaccurate measurements of the coefficients of optical absorption. We developed a PAM system configured as an attenuated total reflectance sensor with a ten-layer graphene film sandwiched between a prism and water (the coupling medium) for photoacoustic (PA) wave detection. Transients of the PA pressure cause perturbations in the refractive index of the water thereby changing the polarization-dependent absorption of the graphene film. The signal in PA detection involves recording the difference in the temporal-varying reflectance intensity between the two orthogonally polarized probe beams. The graphene-based sensor has an estimated noise-equivalent-pressure sensitivity of \u223c550 Pa over an approximately linear pressure response from 11.0 kPa to 55.0 kPa. Moreover, it enables a much broader PA bandwidth detection of up to \u223c150 MHz, primarily dominated by a highly localized evanescent field. From the strong optical absorption of inherent hemoglobin, in vivo label-free PAM imaging provided a three-dimensional viewing of the microvasculature of a mouse ear.

The activity of Na,K-ATPase depends on the redox status of the cell, decreasing with oxidative stress and hypoxia. Previously, we have shown that the key role in the redox sensitivity of Na,K-ATPase is played by the regulatory glutathionylation of cysteine residues of the catalytic alpha subunit, which leads to the inhibition of the enzyme. In this study, the effect of reducing agents (DTT, ME, TCEP) on the level of glutathionylation of the alpha subunit of Na,K-ATPase from rabbit kidneys and the enzyme activity has been evaluated. We have found that the reducing agents partially deglutathionylate the protein, which leads to its activation. It was impossible to completely remove glutathionylation from the native rabbit kidney protein. The treatment of a partially denatured protein on the PVDF membrane with reducing agents (TCEP, NaBH4) also does not lead to the complete deglutathionylation of the protein. The obtained data indicate that Na,K-ATPase isolated from rabbit kidneys has both regulatory and basal glutathionylation, which appears to play an important role in the redox regulation of the function of Na, K-ATPase in mammalian tissues.", "journal": "Molekuliarnaia biologiia", "date": "2018-04-27", "authors": ["E ADergousova", "I YuPetrushanko", "E AKlimanova", "V AMitkevich", "R HZiganshin", "O DLopina", "A AMakarov"], "doi": "10.7868/S002689841802012X"}

In this study, the influence of laminating pressure on the properties of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers/laminate was investigated. Heat-press lamination was carried out at three different pressures, and the surface morphologies of the multilayer nanofibrous membranes were observed under an optical microscope. In addition, air permeability, water filtration, and contact angle experiments were performed to examine the effect of laminating pressure on the breathability, water permeability and surface wettability of multilayer nanofibrous membranes. A bursting strength test was developed and applied to measure the maximum bursting pressure of the nanofibers from the laminated surface. A water filtration test was performed using a cross-flow unit.

During each PZT diaphragm vibration cycle, the junction connecting the inlet and outlet channels with the nozzle jet permits consistencies in fluidic momentum and resistances in order to facilitate complete fluidic path throughout the system, in the absence of any physical valves.

{"title": "The Application of an Ultrasound Tomography Algorithm in a Novel Ring 3D Ultrasound Imaging System.", "abstract": "Currently, breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women all over the world. A novel 3D breast ultrasound imaging ring system using the linear array transducer is proposed to decrease costs, reduce processing difficulties, and improve patient comfort as compared to modern day breast screening systems. The 1 &times; 128 Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (PMUT) linear array is placed 90 degrees cross-vertically. The transducer surrounds the mammary gland, which allows for non-contact detection. Once the experimental platform is built, the breast model is placed through the electric rotary table opening and into a water tank that is at a constant temperature of 32 &deg;C. The electric rotary table performs a 360&deg; scan either automatically or mechanically. Pulse echo signals are captured through a circular scanning method at discrete angles. Subsequently, an ultrasonic tomography algorithm is designed, and a horizontal slice imaging is realized. The experimental results indicate that the preliminary detection of mass is realized by using this ring system. Circular scanning imaging is obtained by using a rotatable linear array instead of a cylindrical array, which allows the size and location of the mass to be recognized. The resolution of breast imaging is improved through the adjustment of the angle interval (>0.05&deg;) and multiple slices are gained through different transducer array elements (1 &times; 128).

{"title": "The flexoelectric effect in Al-doped hafnium oxide.", "abstract": "After the successful introduction as a replacement for the SiO2 gate dielectric in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, HfO2 is currently one of the most studied binary oxide systems with ubiquitous applications in nanoelectronics. For years, the interest of microelectronic downscaling has focused on tuning the dielectric constant of HfO2, particularly for monoclinic and tetragonal phases. Recently, M\u00fcller et al. showed the occurrence of ferroelectricity in orthorhombic HfO2 obtained by doping with Si, Y or Al which can alter the centrosymmetric atomic structure of the elemental binary oxide. Ferroelectric HfO2 is characterized by a permanent electric dipole that can be reversed through the application of an external voltage. As all ferroelectrics, a strong coupling between the polarization and the deformation exists, a property which has allowed the development of piezoelectric sensors and actuators. However, ferroelectrics also show a coupling between the electrical polarization and the deformation gradient, defined as flexoelectricity. In essence, the free charge inside the material redistributes in response to strain gradients, inducing a net non-zero dipole moment, eventually reaching polarization reversal by the sole application of a mechanical stress. Here we show the flexoelectric effect in Al-doped hafnium oxide, using the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) to maximize the strain gradient at the nanometre scale. Our analysis indicates that pure mechanical force can be used for the local polarization control of sub-100 nm domains. Due to the full compatibility of HfO2 in the modern CMOS process, the discovery of flexoelectricity in hafnia paves the way for (1) nanoscopic memory bits that can be written mechanically and read electrically, (2) tip-induced reprogrammable ferroelectric-based logic and (3) electromechanical transducers.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2018-04-25", "authors": ["UmbertoCelano", "MihaelaPopovici", "KarineFlorent", "SimoneLavizzari", "PaolaFavia", "KrisPaulussen", "HugoBender", "Lucadi Piazza", "JanVan Houdt", "WilfriedVandervorst"], "doi": "10.1039/c8nr00618k"}

Thus, the micro-fiber-composite microgripper had a larger displacement-volume ratio (i.e., the ratio of the output displacement to the volume of the microgripper) than that of a traditional piezoelectric one. Moreover, to regulate both the gripper position and the gripping force simultaneously, a hybrid position/force control scheme using fuzzy sliding mode control and the proportional-integral controller was developed. In particular, the fuzzy sliding mode control was used to achieve the precision position control under the influence of the system disturbances and uncertainties, and the proportional-integral controller was used to guarantee the force control accuracy of the microgripper.

This paper presents the results of our experimental studies confirming the occurrence of a surface piezoelectric effect in multi-walled CNTs under a non-uniform strain. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrated the piezoelectric response of multi-walled CNTs under compression and bending. The current generated by deforming an individual CNT was shown to be &minus;24 nA. The value of the surface potential at the top of the bundle of strained CNTs varied from 268 mV to &minus;110 mV, depending on strain type and magnitude. We showed that the maximum values of the current and the surface potential can be achieved when longitudinal strain predominates in a CNT. However, increasing the bending strain of CNTs does not lead to a significant increase in current and surface potential, due to the mutual compensation of piezoelectric charges concentrated on the CNT side walls.

{"title": "A continuous control mode with improved imaging rate for scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM).", "abstract": "Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), one kind of scanning probe microscopy technique, featuring the advantage of non-contact imaging of sample surfaces in three dimensions with high resolution, has been widely applied in characterizations of sample topography, especially for soft materials. However, the time consuming imaging process of SICM restricts its further applications, such as in characterization of dynamic change of sample surface. In this work, a fast control mode of SICM, named as a continuous control mode, has been developed. In this mode, the SICM probe (i.e., pipette) is controlled by speed instructions in the axial direction of pipette (Z axis), and the pipette position is determined by the position sensor. Compared to the conventional piezo control mode of SICM (i.e., the stepwise control mode), in which the pipette is controlled by the position instructions and moves step by step, the continuous control mode can perform the continuous movement of the pipette in Z axis and overcome the time consuming problem caused by the repeated acceleration and deceleration of the pipette during the stepwise mode. Moreover, the imaging resolution in Z axis is not restricted by the pipette movement step and the imaging rate in the continuous control mode can be significantly enhanced without losing imaging quality. The approach speed of pipette in the continuous control mode can reach at 300\u202fnm/ms, which is much faster than that in the stepwise mode. The surfaces of the soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) samples with three different patterns, the hard metal grating sample and the cardiac fibroblasts as the biological sample demo were comparably scanned by SICM using the continuous control mode and the stepwise approach mode, respectively. The obtained SICM images of the sample topography prove that the continuous control mode can not only reduce the imaging deviation, but also efficiently improve the scanning rate of SICM. Furthermore, the continuous control mode can reconstruct the sample topography more stably compared to the stepwise control mode. The continuous control mode developed in this work can provide an efficient and reliable control strategy for improving the imaging performance of SICM system, and therefore can be potentially applied in dynamic characterizations of various samples in material science, biology and chemistry fields.", "journal": "Ultramicroscopy", "date": "2018-04-25", "authors": ["JianZhuang", "YangbohanJiao", "ZeqingLi", "JinxinLang", "FeiLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.04.009"}

Epitaxy can offer a route for maximizing the degree of crystallinity with the effective orientation of the crystals with respect to the electric field.

Herein, the epitaxial growth of PVDF-TrFE crystals on a single-crystalline organic semiconductor rubrene grown via physical vapor deposition is presented. The epitaxy results in polymer crystals globally ordered with specific crystal orientations dictated by the epitaxial relation between the polymer and rubrene crystal. The lattice matching between the c-axis of PVDF-TrFE crystals and the (210) plane of orthorhombic rubrene crystals develops two degenerate crystal orientations of the PVDF-TrFE crystalline lamellae aligned nearly perpendicular to each other.

However, the technology to power implantable devices still has some remaining challenges. This work presents a transparent self-powered pyroelectric generator driven by near infrared radiation for wireless powering of electronics. The pyroelectric device uses a highly conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS, formed as an electrode without the use of a complex transferring process. Due to the good match between the surface energy of the PEDOT electrode and PVDF, when combined with PVDF the resulting PEDOT/PVDF/PEDOT device possesses a highly adherent interface. The influence of the PEDOT thickness on the output voltage of the device has been investigated according to the difference in its infrared transmittance and absorbance. In addition, in order to enhance the output voltage while reducing the device temperature, a laminated pyroelectric generator, in which each cell is composed of a PEDOT/PVDF/PEDOT sandwich, was further developed taking advantage of the high infrared transmittance of PEDOT and PVDF. The proposed laminated pyroelectric device could generate up to 23.4 V with six laminated cells, an enhancement of approximately 212% compared to a single cell, which could directly light up an LCD and was applied for nerve stimulation of the sciatic nerve of a frog, indicating that the proposed self-powered device could be a candidate for implantable medical electronics.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2018-04-23", "authors": ["WeitaoJiang", "TingtingZhao", "HongzhongLiu", "RuiJia", "DongNiu", "BangdaoChen", "YongshengShi", "LeiYin", "BinghengLu"], "doi": "10.1039/c8ra00491a\n10.1002/adfm.201303196\n10.1038/496159a\n10.1260/2040-2295.1.2.169\n10.1053/apmr.2001.25910\n10.1152/physrev.1978.58.2.461\n10.1097/01.MLG.0000157695.07536.D2\n10.1073/pnas.1317233111\n10.1038/nbt.3038\n10.1038/nm.3341\n10.1021/ja211714w\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.10.040\n10.1002/adma.201402064\n10.1063/1.3679102\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.037\n10.1073/pnas.1403002111\n10.1038/srep24946\n10.1038/86684\n10.1021/nn304872n\n10.1002/adma.201104797\n10.1002/adfm.201502752\n10.1080/19475411.2013.872207\n10.1002/aenm.201401891\n10.1002/jbm.820291209\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.12.038\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.11.134\n10.1039/C5NR09290F\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.02.128\n10.1016/j.solmat.2012.09.005\n10.1021/acsnano.5b04042\n10.1088/0034-4885/49/12/002\n10.1016/0022-3913(83)90174-9\n10.1073/pnas.2232479100\n10.1113/jphysiol.1979.sp012771"}

{"title": "Detection of Dimethyl Methylphosphonate (DMMP) Using Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS).", "abstract": "The detection and monitoring of colorless and odorless chemical warfare agents (CWAs) has become important due to the increasing threat of terrorist activities. To enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of CWAs a number of sensing materials have been developed, including the widely used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). However, PVDF is limited by its low sensitivity and selectivity for many CWAs. In this study, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) was used as a sensing material for dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) a simulant of sarin nerve gas. Sensitivity, selectivity, and reusability were investigated with an AT-cut 5 MHz quartz crystal microbalance. At room temperature, POSS exhibited a strong response for DMMP vapor at different concentrations from 20 ppm to 120 ppm leading to fast chemical adsorption and desorption. To investigate selectivity the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) ethanol, water, toluene, ACN, methanol, and n-hexane were tested at a fixed flow rate. Targeted VOCs showed lower responses than DMMP as measured with a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor, demonstrating the high selectivity of the method. POSS can be considered a potentially useful material for sensing nerve simulants.", "journal": "Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology", "date": "2018-04-22", "authors": ["Young-JunLee", "Jong-GyuKim", "Joo-HyungKim", "JaesookYun", "Won JunJang"], "doi": "10.1166/jnn.2018.15698"}

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that PDMS was coated uniformly on the surface of porous PVDF substrate, and the PDMS separation layer was dense with a thickness of 1.7 \u00b5m. Additionally, it was found that with increasing feed temperature, the total flux of the composite membrane increased, whereas the separation factor decreased. As the feed flow velocity increased, the total flux and separation factor increased. Besides, the permeate vapor was condensed by a two-stage fractional condenser maintained at different temperatures. The effects of the condensation conditions on fractions of ethanol-water vapor were studied to concentrate ethanol in product.

When topically administered, this water rich in sodium and chloride penetrates the skin where it is able to modify cellular osmotic pressure and stimulate nerve receptors in the skin via cell membrane ion channels known as \"Piezo\" proteins. We describe several models of cutaneous adsorption/desorption and penetration of dissolved ions in mineral waters through the skin (osmosis and cell volume mechanisms in keratinocytes) and examine the role of these resources in stimulating cutaneous nerve receptors. The actions of salt mineral waters are mediated by a mechanism conditioned by the concentration and quality of their salts involving cellular osmosis-mediated activation/inhibition of cell apoptotic or necrotic processes.

Here we report that the bulk photovoltaic effect, which is free from the thermodynamic Shockley-Queisser limit but usually manifested only in noncentrosymmetric (piezoelectric or ferroelectric) materials, can be realized in any semiconductor, including silicon, by mediation of flexoelectric effect. We used either an atomic force microscope or a micrometer-scale indentation system to introduce strain gradients, thus creating very large photovoltaic currents from centrosymmetric single crystals of strontium titanate, titanium dioxide, and silicon. This strain gradient-induced bulk photovoltaic effect, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic effect, functions in the absence of a p-n junction.

{"title": "Piezoelectric materials as stimulatory biomedical materials and scaffolds for bone repair.", "abstract": "The process of bone repair and regeneration requires multiple physiological cues including biochemical, electrical and mechanical - that act together to ensure functional recovery. Myriad materials have been explored as bioactive scaffolds to deliver these cues locally to the damage site, amongst these piezoelectric materials have demonstrated significant potential for tissue engineering and regeneration, especially for bone repair. Piezoelectric materials have been widely explored for power generation and harvesting, structural health monitoring, and use in biomedical devices. They have the ability to deform with physiological movements and consequently deliver electrical stimulation to cells or damaged tissue without the need of an external power source. Bone itself is piezoelectric and the charges/potentials it generates in response to mechanical activity are capable of enhancing bone growth. Piezoelectric materials are capable of stimulating the physiological electrical microenvironment, and can play a vital role to stimulate regeneration and repair. This review gives an overview of the association of piezoelectric effect with bone repair, and focuses on state-of-the-art piezoelectric materials (polymers, ceramics and their composites), the fabrication routes to produce piezoelectric scaffolds, and their application in bone repair. Important characteristics of these materials from the perspective of bone tissue engineering are highlighted. Promising upcoming strategies and new piezoelectric materials for this application are presented.\nElectrical stimulation/electrical microenvironment are known effect the process of bone regeneration by altering the cellular response and are crucial in maintaining tissue functionality. Piezoelectric materials, owing to their capability of generating charges/potentials in response to mechanical deformations, have displayed great potential for fabricating smart stimulatory scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. The growing interest of the scientific community and compelling results of the published research articles has been the motivation of this review article. This article summarizes the significant progress in the field with a focus on the fabrication aspects of piezoelectric materials.

Among them, rs6584389 A>C was significantly associated with PAD defined by decreased ankle-brachial index (ABI). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the rs6584389 variant is also associated with the earlier stages of atherosclerosis assessed by intima-media thickness (IMT) or pulse-wave velocity (PWV) in clinically asymptomatic subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), a group of patients with a high cardiovascular risk.\nIn total, 111 patients with T2DM (56 females, 55 males) with a mean age 63.0 \u00b1 9.1 years were consecutively included in the study. IMT was measured by ultrasound using 7 MHz linear transducer. PWV was measured using a piezoelectric method. Genotyping for rs6584389 was performed by PCR-HRMA method.\nThe carriers of the risk C-allele of rs6584389 variant had significantly higher mean left-side IMT (AA: 0.67 \u00b1 0.12, AC 0.77 \u00b1 0.21, CC 0.78 \u00b1 0.22 mm; p = 0.04).

For the latter, comprehensive studies involving scattering, thermodynamics, and modeling are typically required. We present a new approach to data mining multiple realizations of collective dynamics, measured through piezoelectric relaxation studies, to identify the onset of a structural phase transition in nanometer-scale volumes, that is, the probed volume of an atomic force microscope tip. Machine learning is used to analyze the multidimensional data sets describing relaxation to voltage and thermal stimuli, producing the temperature-bias phase diagram for a relaxor crystal without the need to measure (or know) the order parameter. The suitability of the approach to determine the phase diagram is shown with simulations based on a two-dimensional Ising model.

In this work, atmospheric-solid-analysis-probe (ASAP) high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used as a new tool for the molecular characterization of various fluorinated polymers, including polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and fluorinated copolymers containing PVDF and chlorotrifluoroethylene (KEL-F 800) or PVDF and hexafluoropropylene (Viton A and Tecnoflon). The major peaks of the observed distributions were assigned compositions, but the high number of species required the use of an alternative method to treat such complex data. Kendrick-mass defects (KMD) were calculated on the basis of the \"common-to-all\" vinylidene difluoride repeating unit. By plotting the KMD as a function of the nominal Kendrick masses (NKM), specific patterns based on homologous series emerged. Kendrick maps were therefore drawn to simplify the mass spectra and provide confident peak assignments through homologous-series recognition. A specific fingerprint for each polymer has been identified, and the ability to discern the four species present in a blend through KMD analysis was demonstrated.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2018-04-19", "authors": ["GabrielGaiffe", "Richard BCole", "SabrinaLacpatia", "Maxime CBridoux"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b05116"}

These inkjet printers use an array of micro fluidic pumps, nozzles based on piezoelectric actuation, to dispense individual picoliter volume ink droplets at high speed. In this paper, we show that individual pumps in desktop printers can be accessed to dispense droplets on demand. Access was obtained using the printer's command language programming. A detailed description of the access procedure is discussed. Droplets were printed on a paper as it rolled underneath the printhead, and with a minor hardware modification, they were also printed on a glass substrate. With this access, individual droplets were deposited, the smallest having an average diameter of 62 \u03bcm with a standard deviation of 6.9 \u03bcm, with a volume of \u223c4 pL. From the intended position, the droplets had a standard deviation of 5.4 \u03bcm and 8.4 \u03bcm in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively.

Thus, the removal of coordinated solvent has been viewed as an essential step that needs to be performed prior to the use of the MOFs in the above applications. To date, a thermal method that is normally performed by applying heat and vacuum has been the most commonly employed activation method despite its negative influence on the structural integrity of the MOFs. In this report, we demonstrate that commonly inert trichloromethane (TCM) can activate OCSs; the TCM treatment process serves as an alternative chemical route to activation that does not require the external thermal energy. On the basis of the Raman study, we suggest a possible mechanism for the chemical activation process where TCM may weakly coordinate to the OCSs and then spontaneously dissociate. In addition, we prove that the chemical activation behavior is substantially boosted when a small amount of external heat energy (55 \u00b0C, 2.6 meV) is supplied during the TCM treatment. Using an HKUST-1-polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mixed matrix (MM), we also demonstrate that this chemical activation strategy is a safe way to activate thermally deformable MOF-polymer mixed matrices.", "journal": "Inorganic chemistry", "date": "2018-04-18", "authors": ["Jae SunChoi", "JinheeBae", "Eun JiLee", "Nak CheonJeong"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00267"}

Here, we demonstrate a high-resolution, high-speed and cost-effective fabrication method, named coaxial focused electrohydrodynamic jet printing, to print functional nanostructures. A coaxial needle was designed and developed; a functional ink and high viscosity liquid are applied in the inner and outer needle, respectively. Under optimised conditions, a stable coaxial jet is formed; then, the electrical shearing force and electrical field induce viscous shearing force and internal pressure that are jointly applied on the inner functional ink, focusing the inner jet on the nanoscale. Using this stable coaxial jet with a nano-jet inside it, nanostructures with highly aligned nanowire arrays, nano-freebeams and nano-cantilever beams down to the scale of 40 nm were directly printed.

Additionally, ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are ideal materials to reduce infection.

{"title": "Adaptive nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller for micro/nanopositioning systems driven by linear piezoelectric ceramic motors.", "abstract": "In the field of nanotechnology, there is a growing demand to provide precision control and manipulation of devices with the ability to interact with complex and unstructured environments at micro/nano-scale. As a result, ultrahigh-precision positioning stages have been turned into a key requirement of nanotechnology. In this paper, linear piezoelectric ceramic motors (LPCMs) are adopted to drive micro/nanopositioning stages since they have the ability to achieve high precision in addition to being versatile to be implemented over a wide range of applications. In the establishment of a control scheme for such manipulation systems, the presence of friction, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances prevent the systems from providing the desired positioning accuracy. The work in this paper focuses on the development of a control framework that addresses these issues as it uses the nonsingular terminal sliding mode technique for the precise position tracking problem of an LPCM-driven positioning stage with friction, uncertain parameters, and external disturbances. The developed control algorithm exhibits the following two attractive features. First, upper bounds of system uncertainties/perturbations are adaptively estimated in the proposed controller; thus, prior knowledge about uncertainty/disturbance bounds is not necessary. Second, the discontinuous signum function is transferred to the time derivative of the control input and the continuous control signal is obtained after integration; consequently, the chattering phenomenon, which presents a major handicap to the implementation of conventional sliding mode control in real applications, is alleviated without deteriorating the robustness of the system. The stability of the controlled system is analyzed, and the convergence of the position tracking error to zero is analytically proven. The proposed control strategy is experimentally validated and compared to the existing control approaches.", "journal": "ISA transactions", "date": "2018-04-18", "authors": ["AlirezaSafa", "Reza YazdanpanahAbdolmalaki", "SaeedShafiee", "BehzadSadeghi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isatra.2018.03.027"}

This sensor can be used to receive acoustic emission signals in the passive damage detection methods and other types of ultrasonic signals propagating in the active damage detection methods, such as guided wave-based methods. The sensitivity of an ultrasonic fiber sensor based on the Mach&ndash;Zehnder interferometer mainly depends on the length of the sensing optical fiber; therefore, the proposed sensor achieves the maximum possible sensitivity by wrapping an optical fiber on a hollow cylinder with a base. The deformation of the optical fiber is produced by the displacement field of guided waves in the hollow cylinder. The sensor was first analyzed using the finite element method, which demonstrated its basic sensing capacity, and the simulation signals have the same characteristics in the frequency domain as the excitation signal. Subsequently, the primary investigations were conducted via a series of experiments. The sensor was used to detect guided wave signals excited by a piezoelectric wafer in an aluminum plate, and subsequently it was tested on a reinforced concrete beam, which produced acoustic emission signals via impact loading and crack extension when it was loaded to failure. The signals obtained from a piezoelectric acoustic emission sensor were used for comparison, and the results indicated that the proposed 3D fiber optic sensor can detect ultrasonic signals in the specific frequency response range.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-04-17", "authors": ["ChengmingLan", "WensongZhou", "YawenXie"], "doi": "10.3390/s18041218\n10.1121/1.384175\n10.1109/58.143172\n10.1016/0041-624X(96)00024-8\n10.1177/1475921715602546\n10.1177/1475921715623359\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/10/105022\n10.1088/1361-665X/26/2/025017\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.1177/1475921705055233\n10.1177/1475921705057973\n10.1121/1.411391\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2010.03.004\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/064\n10.1177/1045389X10385486\n10.1046/j.1475-1305.2003.00070.x\n10.1016/S1359-8368(00)00044-5\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.10.037\n10.1088/0957-0233/27/10/104001\n10.1139/l06-131\n10.1364/AO.16.001761\n10.1109/58.741426\n10.1109/58.56491\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2007.01.040\n10.1109/58.842045\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.02.018\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/3/007\n10.1016/j.yofte.2009.01.003\n10.12989/sss.2016.18.3.471\n10.1364/AO.18.001445\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.05.004\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.11.099\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.10.014"}

{"title": "A Novel Well Drill Assisted with High-Frequency Vibration Using the Bending Mode.", "abstract": "It is important for companies to increase the efficiency of drilling as well as prolong the lifetime of the drilling tool. Since some previous investigations indicated that a superposition of well drilling with an additional vibration increases the drilling efficiency, this paper introduces a novel well drill which is assisted with additional vibrations by means of piezoelectric sandwich bending vibration transducer. The proposed drill uses bending vibrations in two different directions to from an elliptical trajectory movement, which can help the drill to break the surface of hard material more efficiently and clean away the lithic fragments more easily. The proposed well drill with bending vibration transducer is designed to have a resonance frequency of the first bending vibration mode of about 1779 Hz. The motion equation of the particle on the edge of the drill bit is developed and analyzed. The vibration trajectory of the particle on the edge of the drill bit is calculated by using finite element method. A prototype of the proposed drill using bending vibrations is fabricated and tested to verify the aim of drilling efficiency increase. The feed speed of the vibration assisted drilling is tested to be about 0.296 mm/s when the excitation voltage of the transducer is 300 V, while this speed decreases to about 0.195 mm/s when no vibration is added. This comparison shows that the feed speed of the vibration assisted drilling is about 52% higher than that of the normal drilling, which means the proposed drill has a better efficiency and it is important to consider vibration superimposition in well drilling. In addition, the surface of the drill hole gained by the vibration assisted drilling is smoother than that of the normal drilling, which makes the clearance easier.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-04-12", "authors": ["XindaQi", "WeishanChen", "YingxiangLiu", "XintianTang", "ShengjunShi"], "doi": "10.3390/s18041167\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2016.09.012\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2003.12.151\n10.2478/v10267-012-0046-x\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2014.11.008\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.233.297\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2011.05.007\n10.1134/S106273914705011X\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.05.006\n10.1007/s10832-007-9132-4\n10.1002/zamm.201300217\n10.1016/j.procir.2012.04.061\n10.1109/TMECH.2018.2790923\n10.1109/TIE.2012.2233691\n10.1109/TIE.2018.2798627\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)61531-5\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8091595\n10.1016/j.jsv.2003.12.045"}

However, discovering robust biomarkers requires the analysis of large numbers of samples to appropriately represent interindividual variability. To address this analytical challenge, we established a high-throughput and cost-effective proteomics workflow for accurate and comprehensive proteomics at an analytical depth applicable for clinical studies. For validation, we processed 1 \u03bcL each from 62 plasma samples in 96-well plates and analyzed the product by quantitative data-independent acquisition liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; the data were queried using feature quantification with Spectronaut. To show the applicability of our workflow to serum, we analyzed a unique set of samples from 48 chronic pancreatitis patients, pre and post total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) surgery. We identified 16 serum proteins with statistically significant abundance alterations, which represent a molecular signature distinct from that of chronic pancreatitis. In summary, we established a cost-efficient high-throughput workflow for comprehensive proteomics using PVDF-membrane-based digestion that is robust, automatable, and applicable to small plasma and serum volumes, e.g., finger stick. Application of this plasma/serum proteomics workflow resulted in the first mapping of the molecular implications of TPIAT on the serum proteome.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2018-04-12", "authors": ["Tue BjergBennike", "Melena DBellin", "YueXuan", "AllanStensballe", "Frederik TrierM\u00f8ller", "Gregory JBeilman", "OferLevy", "ZobeidaCruz-Monserrate", "VibekeAndersen", "JudithSteen", "Darwin LConwell", "HannoSteen"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00111"}
{"title": "Lower blastocyst quality after conventional vs. Piezo ICSI in the horse reflects delayed sperm component remodeling and oocyte activation.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effects of conventional and Piezo-driven ICSI on blastocyst development, and on sperm component remodeling and oocyte activation, in an equine model.\nIn vitro-matured equine oocytes underwent conventional (Conv) or Piezo ICSI, the latter utilizing fluorocarbon ballast. Blastocyst development was compared between treatments to validate the model. Then, oocytes were fixed at 0, 6, or 18\u00a0h after injection, and stained for the sperm tail, acrosome, oocyte cortical granules, and chromatin. These parameters were compared between injection techniques and between sham-injected and sperm-injected oocytes among time periods.\nBlastocyst rates were 39 and 40%. The nucleus number was lower, and the nuclear fragmentation rate was higher, in blastocysts produced by Conv. Cortical granule loss started at 0H after both sperm and sham injection. The acrosome was present at 0H in both ICSI treatments, and persisted to 18H in significantly more Conv than Piezo oocytes (72 vs. 21%). Sperm head area was unchanged at 6H in Conv but significantly increased at this time in Piezo; correspondingly, at 6H significantly more Conv than Piezo oocytes remained at MII (80 vs. 9.5%). Sham injection did not induce significant meiotic resumption.\nThese data show that Piezo ICSI is associated with more rapid sperm component remodeling and oocyte meiotic resumption after sperm injection than is conventional ICSI, and with higher embryo quality at the blastocyst stage. This suggests that there is value in exploring the Piezo technique, utilized with a non-toxic fluorocarbon ballast, for use in clinical human ICSI.", "journal": "Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics", "date": "2018-04-11", "authors": ["R MSalgado", "J GBrom-de-Luna", "H LResende", "H SCanesin", "KatrinHinrichs"], "doi": "10.1007/s10815-018-1174-9\n10.1016/S0015-0282(16)57737-1\n10.1530/REP-17-0357\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.09.008\n10.1093/humrep/dew082\n10.1210/jcem.82.3.3785\n10.1095/biolreprod52.4.709\n10.1093/humrep/16.1.148\n10.1530/rep.1.0680\n10.1007/s10815-016-0709-1\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a135760\n10.1073/pnas.0608183103\n10.1262/jrd.20216\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.05.007\n10.1093/humrep/14.2.448\n10.1159/000052965\n10.1007/s10815-015-0597-9\n10.1016/S0093-691X(03)00133-X\n10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.01018.x\n10.1007/s10815-013-0113-z\n10.2460/javma.241.8.1070\n10.1016/j.jevs.2013.10.129\n10.1095/biolreprod.104.036012\n10.1016/j.anireprosci.2006.10.011\n10.1071/RD08210\n10.1111/evj.12159\n10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01814.x\n10.1111/and.12273\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.04.079\n10.1095/biolreprod.102.012823\n10.1530/REP-11-0217\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.09.011\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.09.025\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.01.013\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.01.064\n10.1186/1477-7827-12-99\n10.1002/mrd.1080360409\n10.1530/jrf.0.0810127\n10.1017/S1431927617012740\n10.29252/ijrm.15.5.257\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.12.063\n10.1093/humrep/deg511\n10.1093/humrep/15.12.2610\n10.1093/humrep/17.10.2657\n10.1071/R97028\n10.1093/humrep/13.suppl_1.107\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a019473\n10.1095/biolreprod37.2.453\n10.2741/Abbott\n10.1186/1477-7827-9-149\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2016.07.005\n10.1530/jrf.0.1010713\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.07.025\n10.1095/biolreprod.110.089466\n10.1071/RD08115\n10.1095/biolreprod67.1.256"}

However, these materials usually have poor electromechanical coupling coefficients that are not ideal for actuation.

To explore the smart structure further and apply it to more complex structures, some problems are critical to be concerned. Among them, delamination due to the high stress is an important issue since its serious effect on the strength and stiffness of the composite structure.\nIn this investigation, a piezoelectric layer is embedded into the host structure to form a sandwich composite structure. The piezoelectric layer is subjected to an electric voltage, yielding the bending effect on the sandwich composite structure. A theoretical model based on the Euler beam theory and interfacial continuity is presented to determine the stresses of the sandwich composite beam caused by the piezoelectric layer.\nThe influences of the embedded depth and Young's modulus of the piezoelectric layer on the stress distribution of the sandwich composite beam are investigated through a parametric study. The analytical solutions are verified by the finite element method. Good agreement is achieved between the present approach and the finite element method.\nNumerical analysis indicates that the maximum tensile stresses in the top and bottom layers are decreasing with the increase of the embedded depth, while the maximum compressive stress in the lead zirconate titanate layer is increasing with the increase of the embedded depth.

Due to the unique dependence of Hb S polymerization on cellular Hb S concentration, cell dehydration promotes polymerization and sickling. In double heterozygosis for Hb S and C (SC disease) dehydration is the determining factor in disease pathophysiology. Three major ion transport pathways are involved in sickle cell dehydration: the K-Cl cotransport (KCC), the Gardos channel (KCNN4) and Psickle, the polymerization induced membrane permeability, most likely mediated by the mechano-sensitive ion channel PIEZO1. Each of these pathways exhibit unique characteristics in regulation by oxygen tension, intracellular and extracellular environment, and functional expression in reticulocytes and mature red cells. The unique dependence of K-Cl cotransport on intracellular Mg and the abnormal reduction of erythrocyte Mg content in SS and SC cells had led to clinical studies assessing the effect of oral Mg supplementation. Inhibition of Gardos channel by clotrimazole and senicapoc has led to Phase 1,2,3 trials in patients with sickle cell disease.

However, it could cause testicular damage related with oxidative stress and testosterone synthesis disorder. Studies reported that grape seed procyanidins extract (GSPE) could improve CIS induced-testes lesion via scavenging free radicals in animals, although its mechanisms were unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to explore the antagonistic mechanisms of GSPE on CIS-induced testes lesion. Rats were treated with 10\u00a0mg/kg by weight CIS by intraperitoneal injection singly on the 11th day, and different doses of GSPE were administrated via intragastric gavage for 15\u00a0days consecutively. The results showed that GSPE improved the pathological changes of testicular tissue, and the decreased concentrations of testosterone in serum induced by CIS. GSPE inhibited CIS-induced oxidative/nitrative stress, as well as increased the mRNA and protein levels of testosterone synthetase in rat testes. In conclusion, the main protection exerted by GSPE on CIS-induced testicular toxicity is related to its effects including suppressing oxidative/nitrative stress and up-regulating expression of testosterone synthetase.\nCIS: Cisplatin; GSPE: grape seed procyanidins extract; LH: luteinizing hormone; FSH: follicle-stimulating hormone; STAR: steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; CYP11A1: P450 side chain cleavage enzyme; HSD3B1: 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; CYP17A1: 17\u03b1-hydroxylase; HSD17B: 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; O2", "journal": "Systems biology in reproductive medicine", "date": "2018-04-04", "authors": ["MinminTian", "FangfangLiu", "HanLiu", "QiongZhang", "LeiLi", "XiangboHou", "JianxinZhao", "ShengLi", "XuhongChang", "YingbiaoSun"], "doi": "10.1080/19396368.2018.1450460"}

{"title": "Relative Ability of Wedge-Coupled Piezoelectric and Meander Coil EMAT Probes to Generate Single-Mode Lamb Waves.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic guided waves are used extensively when checking for defects in petrochemical and other industries and are mostly generated using piezoelectric transducers on an angled wedge or electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) in different configurations. Low-frequency inspection allows for long-distance propagation, but it is best suited for detecting relatively large defects, while at higher frequencies, the presence of multiple wave modes limit defect detectability, so achieving practical single Lamb mode excitation via careful transduction is very beneficial. This paper investigates the relative ability of angled piezoelectric and meander coil EMAT probes to produce single-mode transduction in the medium (~1-5 MHz-mm) and high (>5 MHz-mm) frequency-thickness regions of the dispersion curves. The nature of each transducer is studied analytically by simulating the corresponding surface forces, followed by the use of a Fourier transform in time and space (2-D fast Fourier transform) to highlight the excitation region in the wavenumber-frequency space. With angled wedge excitation there is a linear relationship between the excitation frequency and the wavenumber which means that the excitation tends to track typical dispersion curves, allowing for easier pure mode generation. In contrast, the EMAT controls frequency and wavenumber separately which makes it more difficult to generate a pure mode when dispersion curves are close together; however, by narrowing the frequency bandwidth via a large number of cycles in the excitation signal, pure mode generation via an EMAT was shown to be possible even in areas of closely spaced modes. As example cases, analytical results, backed up by experiments, showed that signals dominated by the A0 mode at 1.5 MHz-mm and also the A1 mode at 18 MHz-mm can be generated with both angled piezoelectric and EMAT probes.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2018-04-04", "authors": ["PouyanKhalili", "PeterCawley"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2800296"}

{"title": "New design for inertial piezoelectric motors.", "abstract": "We have designed, implemented, and tested a novel inertial piezoelectric motor (IPM) that is the first IPM to have controllable total friction force, which means that it sticks with large total friction forces and slips with severely reduced total friction forces. This allows the IPM to work with greater robustness and produce a larger output force at a lower threshold voltage while also providing higher rigidity. This is a new IPM design that means that the total friction force can be dramatically reduced or even canceled where necessary by pushing the clamping points at the ends of a piezoelectric tube that contains the sliding shaft inside it in the opposite directions during piezoelectric deformation. Therefore, when the shaft is propelled forward by another exterior piezoelectric tube, the inner piezoelectric tube can deform to reduce the total friction force acting on the shaft instantly and cause more effective stepping movement of the shaft. While our new IPM requires the addition of another piezoelectric tube, which leads to an increase in volume of 120% when compared with traditional IPMs, the average step size has increased by more than 400% and the threshold voltage has decreased by more than 50 V. The improvement in performance is far more significant than the increase in volume. This enhanced performance will allow the proposed IPM to work under large load conditions where a simple and powerful piezoelectric motor is needed.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2018-04-02", "authors": ["LigeLiu", "WeifengGe", "WenjieMeng", "YubinHou", "JingZhang", "QingyouLu"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5008471"}
{"title": "Active nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials using a switching controller.", "abstract": "A class of active acoustic diodes and metamaterials is developed to control the flow and distribution of acoustic energy in acoustic cavities and systems. Such development departs radically from the currently available approaches where the non-reciprocities are generated by hard-wired designs, favoring one transmission direction which is dictated by the arrangement of the hardware and hence it cannot be reversed, or without the presentation of rigorous control theory analysis. The proposed active nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterial (ANAM) cell consists of a one-dimensional acoustic cavity provided with active flexible boundaries. These boundaries are made from piezoelectric bimorphs interacting with the cavity to monitor the pressures of the propagating acoustic waves. The outer layers of the bimorphs provide the necessary control actions by direct application of the appropriate control voltage on each layer or by proper connection of nonlinearly activated shunted networks of switching resistors. The control of the switching is carried out using a Switching Mode Control (SMC) strategy. In this strategy, a lumped-parameter model of the ANAM cell is developed to predict the nonreciprocal characteristics of the cell by proper selection of the slope of the switching surfaces. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the merits of the proposed SMC.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2018-04-02", "authors": ["AmrBaz"], "doi": "10.1121/1.5026510"}

{"title": "Remarkably Enhanced Room-Temperature Hydrogen Sensing of SnO\u2082 Nanoflowers via Vacuum Annealing Treatment.", "abstract": "In this work, SnO\u2082 nanoflowers synthesized by a hydrothermal method were employed as hydrogen sensing materials. The as-synthesized SnO\u2082 nanoflowers consisted of cuboid-like SnO\u2082 nanorods with tetragonal structures. A great increase in the relative content of surface-adsorbed oxygen was observed after the vacuum annealing treatment, and this increase could have been due to the increase in surface oxygen vacancies serving as preferential adsorption sites for oxygen species. Annealing treatment resulted in an 8% increase in the specific surface area of the samples. Moreover, the conductivity of the sensors decreased after the annealing treatment, which should be attributed to the increase in electron scattering around the defects and the compensated donor behavior of the oxygen vacancies due to the surface oxygen adsorption. The hydrogen sensors of the annealed samples, compared to those of the unannealed samples, exhibited a much higher sensitivity and faster response rate. The sensor response factor and response rate increased from 27.1% to 80.2% and 0.34%/s to 1.15%/s, respectively. This remarkable enhancement in sensing performance induced by the annealing treatment could be attributed to the larger specific surface areas and higher amount of surface-adsorbed oxygen, which provides a greater reaction space for hydrogen. Moreover, the sensors with annealed SnO\u2082 nanoflowers also exhibited high selectivity towards hydrogen against CH\u2084, CO, and ethanol.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-03-24", "authors": ["GaoLiu", "ZhaoWang", "ZihuiChen", "ShulinYang", "XingxingFu", "RuiHuang", "XiaokangLi", "JuanXiong", "YongmingHu", "HaoshuangGu"], "doi": "10.3390/s18040949\n10.1126/science.aaa1579\n10.1016/j.snb.2004.11.068\n10.1002/adma.201503825\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.04.070\n10.1021/cr800339k\n10.3390/s120505517\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.06.066\n10.1021/acsami.5b01858\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.116\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.07.200\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.06.141\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.04.020\n10.1016/0925-4005(94)01546-T\n10.1021/nl050082v\n10.1186/s11671-017-2152-3\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.03.043\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.054\n10.1016/S0925-4005(97)00326-2\n10.1016/j.proeng.2016.11.202\n10.1039/b504094a\n10.1021/am3028553\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.124\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.12.166\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.03.274\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.066\n10.1016/S0925-4005(00)00564-5"}

The detection of pathogen is one of the most important parts of the process of diagnosis. Having a series of advantages, such as rapid response, high sensitivity, ease of use, and low cost, biosensors have received much attention and been studied deeply. Moreover, relying on its characteristics of small size, real time, and multiple analyses, biosensors have developed rapidly and used widely and are expected to be applied for microbiological detection in order to meet higher accuracy required by clinical diagnosis. The main goal of this contribution is not to simply collect and list all papers related to pathogen detection based on biosensors published recently, but to discuss critically the development and application of many kinds of biosensors such as electrochemical (amperometric, impedimetric, potentiometric, and conductometric), optical (fluorescent, fibre optic and surface plasmon resonance), and piezoelectric (quartz crystal microbalances and atomic force microscopy) biosensors in pathogen detection as well as the comparisons with the existing clinical detection methods (traditional culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction, and mass spectrometry).", "journal": "European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology", "date": "2018-03-24", "authors": ["YingChen", "ZhenzhenWang", "YingxunLiu", "XinWang", "YingLi", "PingMa", "BingGu", "HongchunLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s10096-018-3230-x"}
{"title": "An Equivalent Circuit of Longitudinal Vibration for a Piezoelectric Structure with Losses.", "abstract": "Equivalent circuits of piezoelectric structures such as bimorphs and unimorphs conventionally focus on the bending vibration modes. However, the longitudinal vibration modes are rarely considered even though they also play a remarkable role in piezoelectric devices. Losses, especially elastic loss in the metal substrate, are also generally neglected, which leads to discrepancies compared with experiments. In this paper, a novel equivalent circuit with four kinds of losses is proposed for a beamlike piezoelectric structure under the longitudinal vibration mode. This structure consists of a slender beam as the metal substrate, and a piezoelectric patch which covers a partial length of the beam. In this approach, first, complex numbers are used to deal with four kinds of losses-elastic loss in the metal substrate, and piezoelectric, dielectric, and elastic losses in the piezoelectric patch. Next in this approach, based on Mason's model, a new equivalent circuit is developed. Using MATLAB, impedance curves of this structure are simulated by the equivalent circuit method. Experiments are conducted and good agreements are revealed between experiments and equivalent circuit results. It is indicated that the introduction of four losses in an equivalent circuit can increase the result accuracy considerably.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-03-23", "authors": ["TaoYuan", "ChaodongLi", "PingqingFan"], "doi": "10.3390/s18040947\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.07.010\n10.3390/s130505826\n10.3390/s130506089\n10.1109/58.949732\n10.1109/TMAG.2014.2323362\n10.1063/1.356410\n10.1109/TAU.1971.1162159\n10.1121/1.399508\n10.1177/1045389X09351757\n10.12989/sss.2014.14.2.247\n10.1143/JJAP.31.3073\n10.1088/0964-1726/6/5/014\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00439-8\n10.1143/JJAP.41.7139\n10.1007/s11434-008-0304-7\n10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1244741\n10.1109/T-SU.1967.29405\n10.1142/S2010135X11000033\n10.1109/TUFFC.2006.185\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.12.026\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.10.050\n10.1063/1.4971340\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/095005\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/3/035001\n10.1016/j.jsv.2015.06.042"}

In this work, a quartz crystal balance (QCM) immunosensor was developed for the detection of human tau protein in buffer and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), through both direct and sandwich assays. Starting from a conventional immuno-based sandwich strategy, two monoclonal antibodies recognizing different epitopes of tau protein were used, achieving a detection limit for the direct assay in nanomolar range both in HBES-EP and aCSF. Afterward, for exploring alternative specific receptors as secondary recognition elements for tau protein biosensing, we tested tubulin and compared its behavior to a conventional secondary antibody in the sandwich assay. Tau-tubulin binding has shown an extended working range coupled to a signal improvement in comparison with the conventional secondary antibody-based approach, showing a dose-response trend at lower tau concentration than is usually investigated and closer to the physiological levels in the reference matrix for protein tau biomarker.

The technology has bestowed most of its benefits on enhancing crop productivity with two main traits currently dominating the market: insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant crops. Despite their rapid and vast adoption by farmers worldwide, GMOs have generated heated debates, especially in European countries (EU), driven mostly by consumers concerned about safety of transgenic foods and about the potential impact on the environment. The need to monitor and to verify the presence and the amount of GMOs in agricultural crops and in food products has generated interest in analytical methods for sensitive, accurate, rapid, and cheap detection of these products.

The effects of mixed diluent are discussed in detail in term of morphology, mean pore size, selective wettability, etc. The results show that the membrane structure changes from spherulitic to bicontinuous with the change of DBP/DOP ratio. It is also found that the degree of crystallization decreases with the decrease of DBP/DOP ratio in mixed diluent. When liquid-liquid (L-L) phase separation precedes solid-liquid (S-L) phase separation, the obtained membranes have outstanding hydrophobicity and lipophilicity, excellent mechanical property. Additionally, the PVDF-HFP hybrid membranes are prepared with silica (SiO\u2082) particles and the effect of SiO\u2082 content on structure and properties is discussed. It is found that the PVDF-HFP hybrid membrane with 2 wt % SiO\u2082 (M3-S2) has better properties and higher filtration rate and separation efficiency for surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil emulsion separation.

{"title": "Determination of the sonic properties of a Nigerian quartz for ultrasonic transducer.", "abstract": "There is abundant quartz deposit in Nigeria which has been used for export and building purposes. However, its electrical and piezoelectric properties have not been studied. Thus, whether it can be used as raw material for the indigenous electric industries is unknown to date.\nThis study aims to characterize the piezoelectric properties of smoky quartz for ultrasonic transducer and determine its sonic properties.\nIn the research approach, the raw quartz was cut into six crystals of rectangular shape using a universal cutter. The crystals were purified with a 100\u200aml hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid solution under a temperature of 250\u00b0C in a furnace. The sizes, weights, and capacitance of crystals were determined using the standard measuring instruments. The resonance method was used for the determination of the frequency of minimum and maximum impedance of the crystals. The piezoelectric constants of the crystals were derived using the standard formula for determination of piezoelectric constants.\nThe results show that the sonic properties represented by the piezoelectric charge constant (d31) and the piezoelectric voltage constant (g31) values are 2.52\u00a0(\u00b11.075)\u00a0\u00d710-8c/m2 and 1030.6114\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0250.89v/m2 respectively.\nThe present study has characterized Nigerian quartz for its piezoelectric properties and found that it was suitable for use in the construction of ultrasonic transducers.", "journal": "Journal of X-ray science and technology", "date": "2018-03-23", "authors": ["Uchechukwu INwadike", "Kenneth KAgwu", "Charles UEze", "DukeKani", "GregoryAgu", "EmmanuelEnwereuzo", "MikeObika", "EffiongUmoh", "EmmanuelUfomba"], "doi": "10.3233/XST-17340"}
{"title": "The Effect of Vibration Characteristics on the Atomization Rate in a Micro-Tapered Aperture Atomizer.", "abstract": "Because little is known about the atomization theory of a micro-tapered aperture atomizer, we investigated the vibration characteristics of this type of atomizer. The atomization mechanism of a micro-tapered aperture atomizer was described, and the atomization rate equation was deduced. As observed via microscopy, the angle of the micro-tapered aperture changes with the applied voltage, which proved the existence of a dynamic cone angle. The forward and reverse atomization rates were measured at various voltages, and the influence of the micro-tapered aperture and its variation on the atomization rate was characterized. The resonance frequency of the piezoelectric vibrator was obtained using a laser vibrometer, and the atomization rates were measured at each resonance frequency. From experiments, we found that the atomization rates at the first five resonance frequencies increased as the working frequency increased. At the fifth resonance frequency (121.1 kHz), the atomization rate was maximized (0.561 mL/min), and at the sixth resonance frequency (148.3 kHz), the atomization rate decreased significantly (0.198 mL/min). The experimental results show that the vibration characteristics of the piezoelectric vibrator have a relatively strong impact on the atomization rate.

Vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) is considered a promising solution because of its various advantages. However, low-surface-tension species in produced water can easily deposit on the membrane surface and cause severe fouling or wetting problems. To solve the problems, an omniphobic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) hollow-fiber membrane has been developed via silica nanoparticle deposition followed by a Teflon AF 2400 coating in this study. The resultant membrane shows good repellency toward various liquids with different surface tensions and chemistries, including water, ethylene glycol (EG), cooking oil, and ethanol. It also exhibits stable performance in 7 h VMD tests with a feed solution containing up to 0.6 mM of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In addition, the effects of surface energy and surface morphology as well as nanoparticle size on membrane omniphobicity have been systematically investigated.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the molecular interaction between ShcD and RET in human neuroblastoma cells and study the functional impact of this interaction. We were able to show that ShcD immunoprecipitated with RET from SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cell lysates upon GDNF treatment. This result was validated by ShcD-RET co-localization, which was visualized using a fluorescence microscope. ShcD-RET coexpression promoted ShcD and RET endosomal localization, resulting in unexpected inhibition of the downstream ERK and AKT pathways. Interestingly, ShcD-RET association reduced the viability and migration of SK-N-AS cells. Although ShcD was previously shown to trigger melanoma cell migration and tumorigenesis, our data showed an opposite role for ShcD in neuroblastoma SK-N-AS cells via its association with RET in GDNF-treated cells.

{"title": "Piezo High Accuracy Surgical Osteal Removal (PHASOR): A Technique for Improved Cranial Window Surgery in Mice.", "abstract": "Multiphoton microscopy has been widely adapted for imaging neurons in vivo. Repeated imaging requires implantation of a cranial window or repeated thinning of the skull. Cranial window surgery is typically performed with a high speed rotary drill, and many investigators find it challenging to prevent the drill from damaging the delicate dura and blood vessels. Extensive training and practice is required to remove the bone without damage to underlying tissue and thus cranial window surgery can be difficult, time consuming, and produce tissue damage. Piezoelectric surgery, which is extensively used for maxillofacial and dental surgery, utilizes ultrasonic vibrations to remove bone without damaging soft tissues. We have developed a method applying piezoelectric surgery to improve cranial window surgery in mice in preparation for multiphoton imaging. Comparisons within our lab find that the method requires less surgery time and has a lower average rate of complications due to dural bleeding than cranial window surgery with a rotary drill.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2018-03-20", "authors": ["Samuel DClark", "RachelMikofsky", "JacquelineLawson", "DavidSulzer"], "doi": "10.3791/56172"}

{"title": "Induced clustering of Escherichia coli by acoustic fields.", "abstract": "Brownian or self-propelled particles in aqueous suspensions can be trapped by acoustic fields generated by piezoelectric transducers usually at frequencies in the megahertz. The obtained confinement allows the study of rich collective behaviours like clustering or spreading dynamics in microgravity-like conditions. The acoustic field induces the levitation of self-propelled particles and provides secondary lateral forces to capture them at nodal planes. Here, we give a step forward in the field of confined active matter, reporting levitation experiments of bacterial suspensions of Escherichia coli. Clustering of living bacteria is monitored as a function of time, where different behaviours are clearly distinguished. Upon the removal of the acoustic signal, bacteria rapidly spread, impelled by their own swimming. Nevertheless, long periods of confinement result in irreversible bacteria entanglements that could act as seeds for levitating bacterial aggregates.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2018-03-20", "authors": ["Salom\u00e9Guti\u00e9rrez-Ramos", "MauricioHoyos", "J CRuiz-Su\u00e1rez"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-22960-z\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226\n10.1103/RevModPhys.85.1143\n10.1021/acsnano.6b01344\n10.1038/ncomms10694\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.218304\n10.1126/science.1230020\n10.1038/nature12673\n10.1038/239500a0\n10.1126/science.153.3737.708\n10.1038/245380a0\n10.1073/pnas.121171698\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-122414-034606\n10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601\n10.1529/biophysj.105.069401\n10.1017/jfm.2012.101\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.038102\n10.1073/pnas.1001651107\n10.1146/annurev.micro.57.030502.091014\n10.1039/c3ib40130h\n10.1088/1367-2630/17/3/033017\n10.1073/pnas.1300321110\n10.1126/science.aan5706\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.258101\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.018301\n10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031214-014710\n10.1103/PhysRevE.95.012601\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.028103\n10.1038/nature07593\n10.1128/AEM.02265-07\n10.1021/la026798c\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2004.04.075\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2009.02.010"}

The microstructures and multiferroic properties were investigated. Good ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and ferromagnetic properties and giant magnetoelectric effects are achieved for the heterostructure films, which is ascribed to the depression of the clamped effect from the hard substrate for such pseudo 1-3 structures and the multi-interface coupling between the large magnetostrictive coefficient of FeGa micron-scale discs and the high piezoelectric coefficient of the circle surrounding the Bi5Ti3FeO15 matrices. Such a strong interface strain coupling between the micron discs and the inhomogeneously multiferroic matrices induces obvious magnetoelectric coupling behaviors.

Here we show that, in addition to mechanical stimuli, PIEZO channels are also powerfully modulated by voltage and can even switch to a purely voltage-gated mode. Mutations that cause human diseases, such as xerocytosis, profoundly shift voltage sensitivity of PIEZO1 channels toward the resting membrane potential and strongly promote voltage gating. Voltage modulation may be explained by the presence of an inactivation gate in the pore, the opening of which is promoted by outward permeation. Older invertebrate (fly) and vertebrate (fish) PIEZO proteins are also voltage sensitive, but voltage gating is a much more prominent feature of these older channels. We propose that the voltage sensitivity of PIEZO channels is a deep property co-opted to add a regulatory mechanism for PIEZO activation in widely different cellular contexts.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2018-03-17", "authors": ["MirkoMoroni", "M RocioServin-Vences", "RalucaFleischer", "OscarS\u00e1nchez-Carranza", "Gary RLewin"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-03502-7\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1038/ncomms9329\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1111/cge.12850\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.1038/nn.4162\n10.1038/nature20793\n10.1073/pnas.1414298111\n10.7554/eLife.21074\n10.1038/nature10999\n10.1038/nature21407\n10.1038/nn.4394\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.1038/ncomms10366\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.033\n10.1038/nature15247\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.079\n10.1038/ncomms12939\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.120\n10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.046\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.039\n10.1038/nn.4454\n10.1038/ncomms4520\n10.1038/87434\n10.1007/s00249-008-0318-8\n10.1006/bbrc.2002.6674\n10.1073/pnas.84.8.2297\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.002\n10.1126/science.1077945\n10.1074/jbc.M110.204610\n10.4161/chan.21064\n10.4161/chan.21050\n10.1182/blood-2013-02-482489\n10.1073/pnas.1219777110\n10.1038/ncomms9085\n10.1016/j.bcmd.2013.07.015\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422253\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.07.019\n10.1038/nature13250\n10.1016/j.neulet.2014.05.055\n10.7554/eLife.07369\n10.1038/nature10801\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.175059\n10.1007/978-3-642-45106-5_10\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.07.014\n10.1073/pnas.1320768111\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.040\n10.1007/BF01869476\n10.3109/00365519709057819\n10.1085/jgp.20028553\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15954-0\n10.1038/353752a0\n10.1038/nature07620\n10.1038/nature01581"}

In each patient, bone blocks were harvested in the retromolar area within the external oblique ridge of the mandible. Using a randomized protocol, bone blocks were harvested with the MicroSaw and Piezosurgery either from the right or the left side. Clinical outcome parameters were the comparison of osteotomy time; volume of block graft; and clinical determination of intraoperative complications such as hemorrhage, nerve injury, pain, swelling, and healing of the donor site.\nThe mean osteotomy time for harvesting including luxating a bone block was 5.63 (\u00b1 1.37) minutes using the MicroSaw and 16.47 (\u00b1 2.74) minutes using Piezosurgery (P < .05).

{"title": "Comparative Study on the Cutting Effectiveness and Heat Generation of Rotary Instruments Versus Piezoelectric Surgery Tips Using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Thermal Analysis.", "abstract": "The search for optimizing rehabilitation results with the use of osseointegrated implants has led oral surgeons to look for other technologies that can provide better predictability for treatments; however, effectiveness must be considered as well. This study aimed to compare temperature variation during preparation of implant surgical beds using conventional rotary implant burs versus ultrasonic tips and to study perforation effectiveness by analyzing the functional wear of both systems and the influence of such wear on the overheating of cortical bone.\nThis evaluation was made using thermocouples placed in fresh bovine cortical bone (femur) and connected to a data collector so that the recorded temperatures could provide the thermal behavior of both systems after repeated use of the burs and piezoelectric tips, to compare the wear and the loss of cutting efficiency. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to compare the topography of both systems' perforations. Biostatistics assays were performed comparing both techniques as well.\nThe collected data and images showed that the wear of the burs and tips did not significantly influence the temperature variation, and the greatest variation occurred in the piezoelectric system for preparations of 13-mm depth. The SEM images show a different surface topography between both systems. While the burs cut the bone, showing a smooth surface, the piezoelectric tips condense the bone and present a rough surface.\nThe use of either rotatory burs or piezoelectric tips generates a temperature that does not affect the tissue healing. Burs create a smooth surface, and piezoelectric tips show a more rough and condensed bone surface. The wear of both systems does not have a relevant increase in temperature after the preparation of 30 surgical beds.", "journal": "The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants", "date": "2018-03-14", "authors": ["KenjiFugito Junior", "Arthur RodriguezCortes", "Ricardode Carvalho Destro", "MarceloYoshimoto"], "doi": "10.11607/jomi.5806"}
{"title": "The piezoelectric gating effect in a thin bent membrane with a two-dimensional electron gas.", "abstract": "Thin suspended nanostructures with a two-dimensional electron gas can be used as nanoelectromechanical systems in which electron transport is piezoelectrically coupled to mechanical motion and vibrations. Apart from practical applications, these systems are interesting for studying electron transport under unusual conditions, namely, in the presence of additional mechanical degrees of freedom. In the present paper, we analyze the influence of the bending on the density of a gated two-dimensional electron gas contained in a suspended membrane using the Thomas-Fermi approach and the model of pure electrostatic screening. We show that a small bending is analogous to a small change in gate voltages. Our calculations demonstrate that the density change is most prominent near the edges of the conductive channel created by negatively biased gates. When moving away from these edges, the bending-induced density change rapidly decays. We propose several methods to increase the magnitude of the effect, with the largest benefit obtained from coverage of the conductive channel with an additional grounded gate. It is shown that, for a conductive channel under a bare surface, the largest effect can be achieved if the two-dimensional electron gas is placed near the middle of the membrane thickness, despite the bending-induced strain is zero there.", "journal": "Journal of physics.

Routinely used instruments, such as the Kerrison rongeur and high-speed drill, can result in potentially serious complications, such as dural injury and thermal and mechanical damage to neurovascular structures. We adopted piezoelectric bone surgery, which permits a selective cut of mineralized tissues, to perform posterior procedures on the thoracic spine, where the relationship between bone and the spinal cord is critical. The aim of this article was to evaluate the use of piezoelectric surgery for performing dorsal spine laminectomy and laminoplasty.\nThe Mectron piezosurgery device was developed for cutting bone with microvibrations that are created by the piezoelectric effect. This instrument allows a safe and precise bone cut, and it is characterized by no heat generation, thus avoiding thermal injury to bone and soft tissues. We used this device to perform 8 laminoplasties for tumors of the dorsal spine and 2 laminectomies for thoracic spinal stenosis in 10 patients.\nThere were no procedure-related intraoperative complications, such as dural injury or damage to neural structures.\nThe piezoelectric device showed excellent results in terms of safety and precise bone cutting properties when performing posterior surgical procedures in the dorsal spine, where thermal injury produced by the conventionally used drill may damage the spinal cord closer to bony elements.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2018-03-14", "authors": ["AndreaFranzini", "FedericoLegnani", "ElenaBeretta", "FrancescoPrada", "FrancescoDiMeco", "SergioVisintini", "AngeloFranzini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2018.03.026"}

With recent advances in identifying their topological structure and the discovery of the agonist Yoda1 as well as the specific inhibitor GsMTx4, it is now possible to study the mechanisms by which Piezo channels are involved in physiological and pathophysiological processes. During embryonic cardiovascular development, Piezo1 senses shear stress and promotes vasculature growth. In adult mice, Piezo1 mediates the release of nitric oxide and ATP from endothelial cells to regulate blood pressure. Piezo channels also play a crucial role in cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis by exquisite mechanical force sensing. Piezo channels are also abundantly expressed in lung tissues. As the lung is exposed to complex pulmonary hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics, cells in the lung, such as microvascular endothelial cells, bear mechanical forces from blood flow shear, pulsatile strain, static pressure, and cyclic stretch due to respiratory movement. These mechanical stimuli are involved in a serial of physiological function and pathophysiological processes of the lung, many of which Piezo channels may be the key player.

High bone temperature, above the critical 10\u00b0C threshold, may impair osseointegration, particularly around dense cortical bone.

Local characterization of field emission is performed inside a scanning electron microscope chamber with piezo-controlled tungsten tips working as the anode and the cathode. We demonstrate that an electric field of ~ 200 V / \u03bc m is able to extract current from the flat part of MoS 2 bilayers, which can therefore be conveniently exploited for field emission applications even in low field enhancement configurations.

{"title": "GaN/NbN epitaxial semiconductor/superconductor heterostructures.", "abstract": "Epitaxy is a process by which a thin layer of one crystal is deposited in an ordered fashion onto a substrate crystal. The direct epitaxial growth of semiconductor heterostructures on top of crystalline superconductors has proved challenging. Here, however, we report the successful use of molecular beam epitaxy to grow and integrate niobium nitride (NbN)-based superconductors with the wide-bandgap family of semiconductors-silicon carbide, gallium nitride (GaN) and aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN). We apply molecular beam epitaxy to grow an AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructure directly on top of an ultrathin crystalline NbN superconductor. The resulting high-mobility, two-dimensional electron gas in the semiconductor exhibits quantum oscillations, and thus enables a semiconductor transistor-an electronic gain element-to be grown and fabricated directly on a crystalline superconductor. Using the epitaxial superconductor as the source load of the transistor, we observe in the transistor output characteristics a negative differential resistance-a feature often used in amplifiers and oscillators. Our demonstration of the direct epitaxial growth of high-quality semiconductor heterostructures and devices on crystalline nitride superconductors opens up the possibility of combining the macroscopic quantum effects of superconductors with the electronic, photonic and piezoelectric properties of the group III/nitride semiconductor family.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2018-03-09", "authors": ["RusenYan", "GuruKhalsa", "SureshVishwanath", "YimoHan", "JohnWright", "SergeiRouvimov", "D ScottKatzer", "NeerajNepal", "Brian PDowney", "David AMuller", "Huili GXing", "David JMeyer", "DebdeepJena"], "doi": "10.1038/nature25768"}
{"title": "Unexpectedly high piezoelectricity of Sm-doped lead zirconate titanate in the Curie point region.", "abstract": "Large piezoelectric coefficients in polycrystalline lead zirconate titanate (PZT) are traditionally achieved through compositional design using a combination of chemical substitution with a donor dopant and adjustment of the zirconium to titanium compositional ratio to meet the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). In this work, a different route to large piezoelectricity is demonstrated. Results reveal unexpectedly high piezoelectric coefficients at elevated temperatures and compositions far from the MPB. At temperatures near the Curie point, doping with 2 at% Sm results in exceptionally large piezoelectric coefficients of up to 915\u2009pm/V. This value is approximately twice those of other donor dopants (e.g., 477\u2009pm/V for Nb and 435\u2009pm/V for La). Structural changes during the phase transitions of Sm-doped PZT show a pseudo-cubic phase forming \u224850\u2009\u00b0C below the Curie temperature. Possible origins of these effects are discussed and the high piezoelectricity is posited to be due to extrinsic effects. The enhancement of the mechanism at elevated temperatures is attributed to the coexistence of tetragonal and pseudo-cubic phases, which enables strain accommodation during electromechanical deformation and interphase boundary motion. This work provides insight into possible routes for designing high performance piezoelectrics which are alternatives to traditional methods relying on MPB compositions.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2018-03-09", "authors": ["Shruti BSeshadri", "Michelle MNolan", "GoknurTutuncu", "Jennifer SForrester", "EvaSapper", "GiovanniEsteves", "TorstenGranzow", "Pam AThomas", "Juan CNino", "TadejRojac", "Jacob LJones"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-22566-5\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1999.tb01840.x\n10.1143/JPSJ.7.5\n10.1143/JPSJ.7.12\n10.1016/S0041-624X(02)00436-5\n10.1103/PhysRevB.63.014103\n10.1557/JMR.2002.0126\n10.1007/s10832-007-9068-8\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04848.x\n10.1063/1.3664393\n10.1088/0022-3727/39/24/029\n10.1107/S0021889887086199\n10.1063/1.123756\n10.1103/PhysRevB.75.184117\n10.1063/1.3437399\n10.1063/1.3660253\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1998.tb02389.x\n10.1063/1.1566478\n10.1121/1.402938\n10.1063/1.1504488\n10.1107/S0567739476001551\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04240.x\n10.1063/1.355874\n10.1063/1.4789903\n10.1016/j.actamat.2016.12.037\n10.1063/1.4870934\n10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00017-4\n10.1103/PhysRevB.86.024104\n10.1038/nature06459\n10.1038/nmat1485\n10.1063/1.4959820\n10.1063/1.4870506\n10.1063/1.3191666\n10.1063/1.3479479\n10.1103/PhysRevB.75.184117\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.195503\n10.1063/1.347616\n10.1121/1.403659\n10.1107/S0021889898006001"}

The film is simply a highly porous composite material that was prepared using a piezoelectric polymer and ZnS luminescent powders. The highly effective mechanoluminescence capabilities stem from both the film's porous structure and the strong interactions between poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and ZnS particles. The porous film's sensitivity helps the conversion of mechanical disturbances into electrical energies and induces the electroluminescence of ZnS particles. The particle-film interactions induced a high \u03b2-phase, which is the most effective piezoelectric phase, in the PVDF-HFP film. Similar to polymeric materials, the composite film is highly processable and can be written into arbitrary shapes or patterns using a pipette or stamping techniques.

Total PVDF content, copolymer content, and mixed-solvent have a positive effect on mechanical properties. The addition of copolymer increased the hydrophobicity when the total PVDF content was 20%.

{"title": "Double wedge prism based beam deflector for precise laser beam steering.", "abstract": "Aiming to increase laser beam pointing stability required in interferometric measurements, we designed a laser beam deflector intended for active laser beam stabilization systems. The design is based on two wedge-prisms: the deflecting wedge driven by a tilting piezo-platform and the fixed wedge to compensate initial beam deflection. Our design allows linear beam steering, independently in the horizontal or vertical direction, with resolution of less than 1 \u03bcrad in a range of more than 100 \u03bcrad, and no initial deflection of the beam. Moreover, the ratio of the output beam deflection angle and the wedge tilt angle is less than 0.1; therefore, the noise influence is significantly reduced in comparison to standard mirror-based deflectors. The theoretical analyses support the designing process and can serve as a guide to wedge-prism selection.

{"title": "Novel instrument for characterizing comprehensive physical properties under multi-mechanical loads and multi-physical field coupling conditions.", "abstract": "Functional materials represented by ferromagnetics and ferroelectrics are widely used in advanced sensor and precision actuation due to their special characterization under coupling interactions of complex loads and external physical fields. However, the conventional devices for material characterization can only provide a limited type of loads and physical fields and cannot simulate the actual service conditions of materials. A multi-field coupling instrument for characterization has been designed and implemented to overcome this barrier and measure the comprehensive physical properties under complex service conditions. The testing forms include tension, compression, bending, torsion, and fatigue in mechanical loads, as well as different external physical fields, including electric, magnetic, and thermal fields. In order to offer a variety of information to reveal mechanical damage or deformation forms, a series of measurement methods at the microscale are integrated with the instrument including an indentation unit and in situ microimaging module. Finally, several coupling experiments which cover all the loading and measurement functions of the instrument have been implemented. The results illustrate the functions and characteristics of the instrument and then reveal the variety in mechanical and electromagnetic properties of the piezoelectric transducer ceramic, TbDyFe alloy, and carbon fiber reinforced polymer under coupling conditions.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2018-03-03", "authors": ["ChangyiLiu", "HongweiZhao", "ZhichaoMa", "YuansenQiao", "KunHong", "ZhuangRen", "JianhaiZhang", "YongmaoPei", "LuquanRen"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5009152"}

{"title": "Numerical Study and Optimisation of a Novel Single-Element Dual-Frequency Ultrasound Transducer.", "abstract": "A dual-frequency ultrasound transducer (DFUT) is usually preferred for its numerous advantageous applications, especially in biomedical imaging and sensing. However, most of DFUTs are based on the combination of fundamental and harmonic operations, or integration of multiple different single-frequency ultrasound transducers, hindering perfect beam alignment and acoustic impedance matching. A novel single-element DFUT has been proposed in this paper. A small piezoelectric membrane is used as the high-frequency ultrasound transducer, which is stacked on a large non-piezoelectric elastic membrane with a groove used as the low-frequency capacitive ultrasound transducer. Such a capacitive-piezoelectric hybrid structure is theoretically analysed in details, based on the electrostatic attraction force and converse piezoelectric effect. Both the low and high resonance frequencies are independently derived, with a maximum deviation of less than 4% from the finite element simulations. Besides, a lumped-parameter equivalent circuit model of combining both the capacitive and piezoelectric ultrasound transducers was also described. Based on our dual-frequency structure design, a high-to-low frequency ratio of about 2 to more than 20 could be achieved, with easy and independent controllability of two frequencies, and the high-frequency operation shows at least an order-of-magnitude displacement sensitivity improvement compared with the conventional harmonic operations.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-03-03", "authors": ["ChangheSun", "SenlinJiang", "YufeiLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/s18030703\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.02.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.03.004\n10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2620381\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2010.07.005\n10.3390/s141120825\n10.1088/0031-9155/53/14/014\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006887\n10.1088/0031-9155/61/7/2926\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1534\n10.1049/el.2015.3831\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2008.08.009\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2752229\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2383\n10.3390/s16122170\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006725\n10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2358991\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006553\n10.1109/JMEMS.2015.2472958\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563270\n10.1109/16.43810\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.01.054\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.09.007\n10.1016/S0045-7949(99)00217-5\n10.1109/58.677612\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.11.018\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/1/015012"}

That being said, however, the functional moieties of GO could be used for membrane surface modification, while ensuring simultaneous removal and recycling of industrial organic dyes. Herein, we present a versatile porous structured polyvinylidene fluoride-graphene oxide (PVdF-GO) nanofibrous membranes (NFMs), prepared by using simple and straightforward electrospinning approach for selective separation and filtration. The GO nanosheets were distributed homogeneously throughout the PVdF nanofiber, regulating the surface morphology and performance of PVdF-GO NFM. The PVdF-GO NFMs possesses high mechanical strength and surface free energy (SFE), consequently resulting high permeation and filtration efficiency as compared to PVdF NFM. The selectivity (99%) toward positively charged dyes based on electrostatic attraction, while maintaining rejection (100%) for negatively charged dye from mixed solutions highlight the role of GO in PVdF-GO NFM, owing to uniform pores and negatively charged surface. In addition, the actual efficiency of NFMs could be recovered easily up to three consecutive filtration cycles by regeneration, thereby assuring high stability. The high permeation, purification and filtration efficiency, good stability and recycling of PVdF-GO NFMs are promising for use in practical water purification and applications, particularly for selective filtration and recycling of dyes.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2018-03-01", "authors": ["AbdulGhaffar", "LinaZhang", "XiaoyingZhu", "BaoliangChen"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.7b06081"}

{"title": "Scanning Electron Microscopy Evaluation of Root Surfaces After Instrumentation With Two Piezoelectric Devices.", "abstract": "Scanning electron microscopy evaluation of root surfaces after ultrasonic instrumentation was performed with 2 different metallic tips on piezoelectric devices. Fresh extracted teeth were collected for experimental observation and randomly divided into 2 groups: Test Group, where the root surfaces were treated using an iron, rough, double nano-structural coated (T-Black), corindone-treated tip, and Control Group where the root surfaces were treated with a conventional iron smooth tip. A scanning electronic microscope analysis was performed and the surface roughness and the amount of residual debris were evaluated. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed. Twenty specimens were analyzed, 10 per group and a total of 21.4\u200a\u00d7\u200a10\u200a\u03bcm has been observed. On treated area percentage of debris after ultrasonic scaling in Test Group was 1.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.8%, while in Control Group it was 5.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.3%. Within the limits of the study, it seems that the efficacy of the novel iron, rough, double nano-structural coated (T-Black), corindone-treated structure tip showed greater performance in terms of root surface debridement than the conventional iron smooth tip. The possibility to use a single tool (ultrasonic device with a specific tip) for the root planing procedure within the nonsurgical mechanical therapy may represent a significant advantage for the clinicians.

The key aspect of those systems is the possibility to control magnetization via an electric field, relying on the magneto-elastic coupling at the interface between the piezoelectric and the ferromagnetic components. Accordingly, a direct measurement of both the electrically induced magnetic behavior and of the piezo-strain driving such behavior is crucial for better understanding and further developing these materials systems.

{"title": "Role of Reversible Phase Transformation for Strong Piezoelectric Performance at the Morphotropic Phase Boundary.", "abstract": "A functional material with coexisting energetically equivalent phases often exhibits extraordinary properties such as piezoelectricity, ferromagnetism, and ferroelasticity, which is simultaneously accompanied by field-driven reversible phase transformation. The study on the interplay between such phase transformation and the performance is of great importance. Here, we have experimentally revealed the important role of field-driven reversible phase transformation in achieving enhanced electromechanical properties using in\u00a0situ high-energy synchrotron x-ray diffraction combined with 2D geometry scattering technology, which can establish a comprehensive picture of piezoelectric-related microstructural evolution. High-throughput experiments on various Pb/Bi-based perovskite piezoelectric systems suggest that reversible phase transformation can be triggered by an electric field at the morphotropic phase boundary and the piezoelectric performance is highly related to the tendency of electric-field-driven phase transformation. A strong tendency of phase transformation driven by an electric field generates peak piezoelectric response. Further, phase-field modeling reveals that the polarization alignment and the piezoelectric response can be much enhanced by the electric-field-driven phase transformation.

However, sawing has been associated with bone breakthrough and necrosis problems. In this paper, a novel elliptical vibration assisted OOS was designed to achieve a low cutting force under the condition of deepening cut depth and reducing cutting speed, based on the analysis of brittle fractures of the bone and elliptical vibration assisted cutting kinematics. The elliptical vibration was generated using two parallel stacked piezoelectric actuators assembled with the fixture. In order to reduce the large cutting forces due to the large cutting depth, a series of experiments was also conducted to investigate the influence of processing parameters on cutting forces. It was demonstrated that cutting forces are significantly reduced by increasing the vibration frequency and vibration amplitude, and decreasing the sawing speed in the current design. The new design could minimize the cutting forces during sawing and allow surgeons to have better control over the sawing process.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2018-02-25", "authors": ["LimingShu", "NaohikoSugita", "MasayaOshima", "MamoruMitsuishi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2018.02.005"}

Unlike the conventional phase retrieval method, the proposed method locks the data page and the corresponding phase-retrieval interference beam together at the same location with a sequential recording process, which eliminates piezoelectric elements, phase shift arrays and extra interference beams, making the system more compact and phase retrieval easier. To evaluate our proposed phase modulation method, we recorded and then recovered data pages with multilevel phase modulation using two spatial light modulators experimentally. For 4-level, 8-level, and 16-level phase modulation, we achieved the bit error rate (BER) of 0.3%, 1.5% and 6.6% respectively. To further improve data storage density, an orthogonal reference encoding multiplexing method at the same position of medium is also proposed and validated experimentally.

{"title": "Self-Powered Temperature-Mapping Sensors Based on Thermo-Magneto-Electric Generator.", "abstract": "We demonstrate a thermo-magneto-electric generator (TMEG) based on second-order phase transition of soft magnetic materials that provides a promising pathway for scavenging low-grade heat. It takes advantage of the cyclic magnetic forces of attraction and repulsion arising through ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition to create mechanical vibrations that are converted into electricity through piezoelectric benders. To enhance the mechanical vibration frequency and thereby the output power of the TMEG, we utilize the nonlinear behavior of piezoelectric cantilevers and enhanced thermal transport through silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) applied on the surface of a soft magnet. This results in large enhancement of the oscillation frequency reaching up to 9 Hz (300% higher compared with that of the prior literature). Optimization of the piezoelectric beam and Ag NP distribution resulted in the realization of nonlinear TMEGs that can generate a high output power of 80 \u03bcW across the load resistance of 0.91 M\u03a9, which is 2200% higher compared with that of the linear TMEG. Using a nonlinear TMEG, we fabricated and evaluated self-powered temperature-mapping sensors for monitoring the thermal variations across the surface.

{"title": "Gentamicin-Releasing Mesoporous ZnO Structures.", "abstract": "Among metal oxides, zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the most attractive materials thanks to its biocompatible and biodegradable properties along with the existence of various morphologies featuring piezoelectric, semiconducting and photocatalytic activities. All of these structures were successfully prepared and tested for numerous applications, including optoelectronics, sensors and biomedical ones. In the last case, biocompatible ZnO nanomaterials positively influenced cells growth and tissue regeneration as well, promoting wound healing and new bone formation. Despite showing high surface areas, ZnO morphologies generally lack an intrinsic mesoporous structure, strongly limiting the investigation of the corresponding drug loading and release properties. Within this scope, this study focuses on the adsorption and release properties of high surface area, mesoporous ZnO structures using gentamicin sulfate (GS), a well known antibiotic against bacterial infections especially in orthopedics. The particular ZnO morphology was achieved starting from sputtered porous zinc layers, finally converted into ZnO by thermal oxidation. By taking advantage of this mesoporous framework, GS was successfully adsorbed within the ZnO matrix and the kinetic release profile evaluated for up to seven days. The adsorption of GS was successfully demonstrated, with a maximum amount of 263 mg effectively loaded per gram of active material. Then, fast kinetic release was obtained in vitro by simple diffusion mechanism, thus opening further possibilities of smart pore and surface engineering to improve the controlled delivery.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-02-23", "authors": ["MarcoLaurenti", "ValentinaCauda"], "doi": "10.3390/ma11020314\n10.1007/s00339-007-3942-8\n10.1109/ULTSYM.1985.198559\n10.1002/admi.201500494\n10.3390/nano7110374\n10.1021/es800036n\n10.1039/C4CP05857G\n10.1039/C6RA17319E\n10.1088/0957-4484/26/21/215704\n10.1007/s00339-014-8453-9\n10.1016/S0022-0248(01)01509-3\n10.1021/nl035198a\n10.1039/C7TB02229H\n10.1016/j.energy.2013.12.025\n10.1117/12.2254872\n10.1002/admi.201700161\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.02.010\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.030\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.07.314\n10.1007/s11664-017-5491-z\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.06.094\n10.1080/1536383X.2015.1013187\n10.1088/1361-6641/aa6bde\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.12.178\n10.5772/56941\n10.1002/chem.201204429\n10.1002/adma.201501594\n10.1002/pssa.201600142\n10.1117/12.899408\n10.1088/0957-4484/21/40/405503\n10.1038/srep29763\n10.1007/s00216-017-0204-2\n10.1117/12.923194\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.01.099\n10.1007/s11434-013-5714-5\n10.1080/00032719.2013.865198\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.535-537.2450\n10.1049/mnl.2011.0310\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.12.015\n10.3390/s120302787\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.041\n10.1039/C5RA15787K\n10.1002/adma.201605048\n10.1002/adma.201002255\n10.1016/j.msec.2011.11.001\n10.1039/c2nr32369a\n10.1039/C5TC02635K\n10.1021/cm402592t\n10.1021/acsami.6b04933\n10.1021/ja200328s\n10.1002/anie.201300431\n10.1007/s11051-013-1505-9\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.05.052\n10.1039/C4TB00416G\n10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02358\n10.1002/adhm.201100033\n10.1039/c2cp42705b\n10.1002/app.35426\n10.1039/c0jm00022a"}

{"title": "Structure and mechanogating mechanism of the Piezo1 channel.", "abstract": "The mechanosensitive Piezo channels function as key eukaryotic mechanotransducers. However, their structures and mechanogating mechanisms remain unknown. Here we determine the three-bladed, propeller-like electron cryo-microscopy structure of mouse Piezo1 and functionally reveal its mechanotransduction components. Despite the lack of sequence repetition, we identify nine repetitive units consisting of four transmembrane helices each-which we term transmembrane helical units (THUs)-which assemble into a highly curved blade-like structure. The last transmembrane helix encloses a hydrophobic pore, followed by three intracellular fenestration sites and side portals that contain pore-property-determining residues. The central region forms a 90\u2009\u00c5-long intracellular beam-like structure, which undergoes a lever-like motion to connect THUs to the pore via the interfaces of the C-terminal domain, the anchor-resembling domain and the outer helix. Deleting extracellular loops in the distal THUs or mutating single residues in the beam impairs the mechanical activation of Piezo1. Overall, Piezo1 possesses a unique 38-transmembrane-helix topology and designated mechanotransduction components, which enable a lever-like mechanogating mechanism.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2018-02-23", "authors": ["QianchengZhao", "HengZhou", "ShaopengChi", "YanfengWang", "JianhuaWang", "JieGeng", "KunWu", "WenhaoLiu", "TingxinZhang", "Meng-QiuDong", "JiaweiWang", "XuemingLi", "BailongXiao"], "doi": "10.1038/nature25743"}

{"title": "Performance and Fouling Study of Asymmetric PVDF Membrane Applied in the Concentration of Organic Fertilizer by Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD).", "abstract": "This study proposes using membrane distillation (MD) as an alternative to the conventional multi-stage flushing (MSF) process to concentrate a semi-product of organic fertilizer. By applying a unique asymmetric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, which was specifically designed for MD applications using a nonsolvent thermally induced phase separation (NTIPS) method, the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) performance was investigated in terms of its sustainability in permeation flux, fouling resistance, and anti-wetting properties. It was found that the permeation flux increased with increasing flow rate, while the top-surface facing feed mode was the preferred orientation to achieve 25% higher flux than the bottom-surface facing feed mode. Compared to the commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane, the asymmetric PVDF membrane exhibited excellent anti-fouling and sustainable flux, with less than 8% flux decline in a 15 h continuous operation, i.e., flux decreased slightly and was maintained as high as 74 kg\u00b7m-2\u00b7h-1 at 70 \u00b0C. Meanwhile, the lost flux was easily recovered by clean water rinsing. Overall 2.6 times concentration factor was achieved in 15 h MD operation, with 63.4% water being removed from the fertilizer sample. Further concentration could be achieved to reach the desired industrial standard of 5x concentration factor.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2018-02-22", "authors": ["YanfeiLiu", "TonghuXiao", "ChenghuanBao", "JifeiZhang", "XingYang"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes8010009\n10.1016/j.biortech.2007.02.046\n10.1016/j.rser.2012.12.064\n10.1016/j.desal.2006.12.009\n10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2003.08.003\n10.1016/j.desal.2010.09.001\n10.1016/j.cis.2010.09.005\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.10.028\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.06.006\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.08.002\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.01.003\n10.1080/19443994.2012.714725\n10.1016/j.memsci.2003.09.006\n10.1016/j.watres.2010.05.050\n10.1016/S0011-9164(02)00266-7\n10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.04.021\n10.1016/j.desal.2006.03.421\n10.1016/j.cej.2017.07.104\n10.1016/j.desal.2007.01.200\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.02.023\n10.1021/ie0003436\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.09.042\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.08.001\n10.1016/j.ifset.2017.08.002\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.03.017\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.06.040\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.03.014\n10.1016/j.seppur.2017.03.035\n10.1016/j.watres.2011.08.012\n10.1016/S0376-7388(98)00196-3\n10.1016/j.desal.2005.10.015\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.03.081\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.12.033\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.04.002\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.03.043\n10.1016/0011-9164(89)80010-4\n10.3390/membranes6040047\n10.1016/S0011-9164(02)01070-6\n10.1016/j.memsci.2005.10.028\n10.1016/S0376-7388(02)00603-8\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.05.040\n10.1016/j.desal.2007.05.019\n10.1016/j.desal.2005.06.047"}

{"title": "Theoretical study of the effect of piezoelectric bone matrix on transient fluid flow in the osteonal lacunocanaliculae.", "abstract": "A new theoretical generation mechanism of the transient streaming potential considering variations in the surface potential on the wall in a lacunocanalicular system, is proposed based on the assumption of the piezoelectric bone matrix. To obtain the streaming potential analytically, a modified transient charge density equation is proposed. An osteon is modeled as a piezoelectric solid phase having fluid-filled cavities (lacunae) connected by channels (canaliculae) to obtain the pressure gradients in the canaliculae and the electric boundary conditions on the canalicular walls. In addition, this study focused on modeling of the negatively charged glycocalyx that fills the annular fluid space between the osteocytic process and the canalicular wall. It is assumed that the annular fluid space of the canaliculi can be represented as a two-layer configuration for flow through a gap (between the tips of the glycocalyx and the canalicular wall) overlaying the porous glycocalyx. The transient streaming potential and bone fluid flow affected by the generated total potential are analyzed using the one-dimensional lacunocanalicular fluid path, which is surrounded by the piezoelectric bone matrix. A significant increase in the streaming potential is predicted for the case with piezoelectricity. The peak streaming potential value with the piezoelectricity is found to be up to 58.8% greater compared with that without piezoelectricity. The electroviscous effect due to the total electric potential gradients on the fluid velocities in the canaliculi is negligible. These findings imply that the piezoelectric effect caused by deformation of the bone matrix should be considered for prediction of the streaming potential in the lacunocanaliculae. \u00a9 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

{"title": "A dual-mode hemispherical sparse array for 3D passive acoustic mapping and skull localization within a clinical MRI guided focused ultrasound device.", "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated that passive acoustic imaging may be used alongside MRI for monitoring of focused ultrasound therapy. However, past implementations have generally made use of either linear arrays originally designed for diagnostic imaging or custom narrowband arrays specific to in-house therapeutic transducer designs, neither of which is fully compatible with clinical MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) devices. Here we have designed an array which is suitable for use within an FDA-approved MR-guided transcranial focused ultrasound device, within the bore of a 3 Tesla clinical MRI scanner. The array is constructed from 5\u2009\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u20090.4\u2009mm piezoceramic disc elements arranged in pseudorandom fashion on a low-profile laser-cut acrylic frame designed to fit between the therapeutic elements of a 230\u2009kHz InSightec ExAblate 4000 transducer. By exploiting thickness and radial resonance modes of the piezo discs the array is capable of both B-mode imaging at 5 MHz for skull localization, as well as passive reception at the second harmonic of the therapy array for detection of cavitation and 3D passive acoustic imaging. In active mode, the array was able to perform B-mode imaging of a human skull, showing the outer skull surface with good qualitative agreement with MR imaging. Extension to 3D showed the array was able to locate the skull within\u2009\u2009\u00b12\u2009mm/2\u00b0 of reference points derived from MRI, which could potentially allow registration of a patient to the therapy system without the expense of real-time MRI. In passive mode, the array was able to resolve a point source in 3D within a\u2009\u2009\u00b110\u2009mm region about each axis from the focus, detect cavitation (SNR ~ 12 dB) at burst lengths from 10 cycles to continuous wave, and produce 3D acoustic maps in a flow phantom.

{"title": "Facile fabrication of polyurethane-based graphene foam/lead zirconate titanate/polydimethylsiloxane composites with good damping performance.", "abstract": "In modern society, much more noise and vibration are produced in traffic and industrial systems, which is harmful to human health, equipment safety and the environment, therefore damping materials are becoming increasingly important. A piezoelectric damping composite could broaden the damping temperature range and enhance the damping loss factor simultaneously by introducing a dissipation route of mechanical to electrical to heat energy. In this paper, a novel piezo-damping polyurethane-based graphene foam (PGF)/PZT/PDMS composite (PGPP) was facilely fabricated using a one-step vacuum-assisted filling method. Using three-dimensional graphene foam as a conductive phase, and due to its three-dimensional network structure, the PGPP composite can reach the percolation threshold with a dramatically reduced amount of RGO sheets. The effects of PZT content and frequency on the damping properties of the PGPP composites were investigated, and the results show that the storage modulus, loss modulus and loss factor of the PGPPs are all greatly enhanced compared to those of the PDMS matrix.

Laparoscopic approaches have become the option in elective surgery because it has less morbidity and requires a shorter stay. Several laparoscopic techniques have been employed, but there is no gold standard technique for this kind of hernia. We report, in this study, our experience with intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair.\nFifteen patients underwent elective surgery for SH between 2008 and 2015 in a Short-Stay Surgical Unit. Laparoscopic IPOM technique was performed in all patients. The technique, epidemiological data, operative findings, hospital stay, morbidity, and follow-up are presented.\nFifteen patients (8 males) with a median age of 57 years were operated on. They commonly presented an abdominal mass in the flank (73.3%). Computed tomography was necessary in 4 patients to complete preoperative diagnosis. The mean operating time was 43 minutes. No closure of the defect was associated and we employed expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-coated and polyvinylidene fluoride-coated polypropylene meshes. There were no postoperative complications and early discharge was possible in all cases. No recurrences or complications related to the mesh have been detected so far, with a median follow-up of 4 years (1-8).\nOur experience shows IPOM laparoscopic SH repair is a safe and effective technique with advantages that allow us to recommend it as the most advisable for SH treatment in Short-Stay Surgical Units.

When a given MOP was soluble in the precursor solutions, the resulting MMMs were thin, flexible, and homogeneous based on microscopy and SEM imaging. Analogous MMM formation using either insoluble MOPs or the inherent insoluble MOF-5 showed a higher degree of phase separation and inhomogeneity. Even when a MOP was not fully soluble, a significant particle size decrease was observed in contrast to the MOF-5 materials wherein the crystallites remained largely intact. This is a consequence of solubilizing the MOP fillers into the polymer solvent. The crystallinity and thermal stabilities of the MMMs were compared to pure PVDF using powder X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry, indicating that the incorporation of MOPs both decreased overall crystallinity as well as increased thermal stability.

{"title": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(3-methylthiophene) core-shell nanocomposites with improved structural and electronic properties of the conducting polymer component.", "abstract": "We report significant improvements in the structure and electronic properties of a poly(3-alkylthiophene) representative, namely poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MT), when it is synthesized in the presence of submicron electroactive poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) particles. The applied template oxidative synthesis leads to the formation of the PVDF/P3MT composite consisting of core-shell particles. The shells are constituted with a monolayer of 20-40 nm nanoparticles of the doped P3MT (P3MT-Cl) precipitated at the surface of the spherical PVDF cores. This morphology differs strongly from the hierarchical one of the neat P3MT synthesized without PVDF particles. In the latter case, 20-60 nm P3MT nanoparticles form \u223c200 nm aggregates, which, in turn, are arranged in a few micrometer agglomerates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that compared to the neat polymer, doped P3MT in the shells of the composite is characterized with higher effective conjugation length, regioregularity of the molecular structure, improved intrachain packing order and lower bipolaron/polaron ratio. These features of the PVDF/P3MT composite strongly suggest applicability of this material in various electronic devices. As a proof of concept, we report on an improved sensing performance of the PVDF/P3MT-Cl composite compared with the neat P3MT-Cl in detection of several volatile organic compounds known as markers for some diseases and toxic substances. We have discovered that the maximal improvement in the sensor response magnitude corresponds to the case when the values of the analyte electronegativity and polythiophene work function are close. We associate this behavior with a higher surface dipole component of the work function of the PVDF/P3MT-Cl composite compared to that of the neat conducting polymer.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2018-02-16", "authors": ["Nikolay AOgurtsov", "Valery NBliznyuk", "Andrii VMamykin", "Oleksandr LKukla", "Yuri PPiryatinski", "Alexander APud"], "doi": "10.1039/c7cp07604e"}

{"title": "Ultrasound Cyclo Plasty in Eyes with Glaucoma.", "abstract": "Glaucoma is a chronic disease caused by the progressive degeneration of the optical nerve fibers, resulting in decreased visual field that can lead to severe visual impairment, and eventually blindness. This manuscript describes a simple, surgeon-friendly, non-incisional technique, named Ultrasound Cyclo Plasty (UCP), for reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients. The technique determines a selective coagulation necrosis of the ciliary body; in addition, the stimulation of supra-choroidal and trans-scleral portions of the uveo-scleral outflow pathway has been recently proposed. UCP shows several technical improvements in ultrasound technology compared to previous techniques, providing more precise focusing on the target zone. The procedure is performed in the operating room under peribulbar anesthesia. Briefly, the coupling cone is put in contact with the eye and the ring probe, that contains six piezoelectric transducers which produce the ultrasound beams, is inserted inside it. Their proper centering over the ocular surface represents a crucial step for the correct targeting of the ciliary body. Sterile balanced salt solution is used to fill the empty spaces to ensure ultrasound acoustic propagation. Surgical treatment consists in the sequential automatic activation of each of the six transducers, for a total duration of less than 3 min. The patient leaves the hospital 1 h after the procedure with the treated eye patched. In the present study, 10 patients with open-angle glaucoma were followed-up during at least 12 months after the procedure. IOP was reduced at each interval compared to pre-operative, as well as the number of hypotensive medications. Twenty percent of patients did not respond to the treatment, and needed subsequent surgery to better control IOP. Treatment tolerability was good, with no cases of hypotony or phthisis. The UCP procedure is simpler, faster, safer, and less invasive than traditional cyclodestructive procedures with similar results in reducing IOP.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2018-02-15", "authors": ["GiuseppeGiannaccare", "StefanoSebastiani", "Emilio CCampos"], "doi": "10.3791/56192"}

In the first step, the electrospun silver nitrate (AgNO3)/PVDF membranes were prepared and the influence of the AgNO3 content on the electrospinning process was studied. According to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results, when the electrospinning solution contained AgNO3 in the range between 3 to 7 wt.%, the nanofiber morphologies can be obtained. In the second step, the electrospun AgNO3/PVDF membranes were reduced by sodium borohydride to form the nanofibrous Ag/PVDF composite membranes. The resultant composite membranes were characterized by SEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier-transform infrared. The XRD, XPS, and EDS characterizations proved the existence of Ag in the nanofibrous Ag/PVDF composite membranes. The crystallinity degree of PVDF for composite membranes declined with the increase in Ag content. More importantly, the nanofibrous Ag/PVDF composite membranes had obviously higher Rosseland extinction coefficients and lower thermal radiative conductivities in comparison with electrospun PVDF membrane, which demonstrates that such composite membranes with high porosity, low density, and good water vapor permeability are promising thermal insulating materials to block the heat transfer resulting from thermal radiation.

The BCZT powder was calcined at the temperature ranging from 700 to 1000 \u00b0C. Green bodies were sintered at various temperatures (1200-1450 \u00b0C). The X-ray diffraction patterns showed only non-crystalline phase of as-burnt powder. For the calcined powders, XRD patterns showed that the amount of crystalline, perovskite phase increased with increasing calcination temperature. The crystalline particles have a spherical shape and the size in the range of 25-35 nm.

{"title": "On compressible and piezo-viscous flow in thin porous media.", "abstract": "In this paper, we study flow through thin porous media as in, e.g. seals or fractures. It is often useful to know the permeability of such systems. In the context of incompressible and iso-viscous fluids, the permeability is the constant of proportionality relating the total flow through the media to the pressure drop. In this work, we show that it is also relevant to define a constant permeability when compressible and/or piezo-viscous fluids are considered. More precisely, we show that the corresponding nonlinear equation describing the flow of any compressible and piezo-viscous fluid can be transformed into a single linear equation. Indeed, this linear equation is the same as the one describing the flow of an incompressible and iso-viscous fluid. By this transformation, the total flow can be expressed as the product of the permeability and a nonlinear function of pressure, which represents a generalized pressure drop.", "journal": "Proceedings.

{"title": "A technical review and evaluation of implantable sensors for hearing devices.", "abstract": "Most commercially available cochlear implants and hearing aids use microphones as sensors for capturing the external sound field. These microphones are in general located in an external element, which is also responsible for processing the sound signal. However, the presence of the external element is the cause of several problems such as discomfort, impossibility of being used during physical activities and sleeping, and social stigma. These limitations have driven studies with the goal of developing totally implantable hearing devices, and the design of an implantable sensor has been one of the main challenges to be overcome. Different designs of implantable sensors can be found in the literature and in some commercial implantable hearing aids, including different transduction mechanisms (capacitive, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, etc), configurations microphones, accelerometers, force sensor, etc) and locations (subcutaneous or middle ear). In this work, a detailed technical review of such designs is presented and a general classification is proposed. The technical characteristics of each sensors are presented and discussed in view of the main requirements for an implantable sensor for hearing devices, including sensitivity, internal noise, frequency bandwidth and energy consumption. The feasibility of implantation of each sensor is also evaluated and compared.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2018-02-13", "authors": ["DiegoCalero", "StephanPaul", "Andr\u00e9Gesing", "FabioAlves", "J\u00falio ACordioli"], "doi": "10.1186/s12938-018-0454-z\n10.1243/09544119JEIM365\n10.1016/j.otc.2014.08.004\n10.4322/rbeb.2013.039\n10.1097/AUD.0b013e31803150f4\n10.1016/j.otc.2011.09.002\n10.1016/S0030-6665(05)70340-6\n10.1097/MAO.0b013e31814b242f\n10.1016/j.otohns.2007.03.012\n10.1049/el.2013.1350\n10.1186/1475-925X-11-10\n10.1097/00129492-200309000-00016\n10.1016/j.otohns.2004.05.027\n10.1007/s10544-007-9072-4\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.876648\n10.1109/JSSC.2014.2355822\n10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2032267\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2013.03.012\n10.3390/s140814356\n10.1371/journal.pone.0110636\n10.1055/s-0033-1363463\n10.1080/14670100.2017.1371974\n10.1121/1.1763601\n10.1109/RBME.2008.2008250\n10.3766/jaaa.16.2.4\n10.1121/1.1423926\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2195782\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.06.009\n10.1016/j.aanat.2007.06.002\n10.1007/s10162-007-0103-x\n10.3109/00016481003671244\n10.1587/elex.8.215\n10.1016/S0030-6665(05)70343-1\n10.1177/0194599811401709\n10.1016/j.heares.2012.12.001\n10.1002/lary.23618\n10.5369/JSST.2012.21.2.144\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00007-8\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.02.001\n10.1088/0960-1317/13/5/315\n10.1088/0960-1317/15/7/022\n10.1038/srep29957\n10.1088/0957-0233/20/9/092001\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2640447\n10.1080/00016489.2016.1201590\n10.1121/1.2817358\n10.1106/8BFB-GC8P-XQ47-YCQ0"}
{"title": "Inkjet printing and electrical characterisation of DNA-templated cadmium sulphide nanowires.", "abstract": "Cadmium sulphide can be templated on \u03bb-DNA molecules to form an aqueous dispersion of CdS/\u03bb-DNA nanowires. Subsequent addition of ethylene glycol to 50% v/v is sufficient to formulate an ink suitable for printing using piezoelectric drop-on-demand technology. Printed droplet arrays show a coffee-ring morphology of individual deposits by fluorescence and Raman microscopy, but upon increasing the number of layers of printed material by repeated printing over each droplet, the dry deposit approaches closer to a disc shape. It is also possible to print parallel tracks by reducing the droplet separation in the array until neighbouring droplets overlap before they dry. The droplets coalesce to form a strip of width roughly equal to the diameter of the droplets. Evaporation-driven capillary flow sends the nanowires to the edges of the strip and when dry they form parallel tracks of CdS/\u03bb-DNA nanowire bundles. Both droplets and tracks were printed onto Pt-on-glass interdigitated microelectrodes (10 \u03bcm width, 10 \u03bcm gap). The current-voltage characteristics of these two-terminal devices were approximately ohmic, but with some hysteresis. The conductance increased with temperature as a simple activated process with activation energies of 0.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 eV (tracks) and 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 eV (droplets).

The detection strategy is based on monitoring the changes in optical properties of PT associated with its conformational changes upon interaction with an aptamer in the presence and in the absence of 8-OHdG. Fluorometric and colorimetric monitoring revealed linear responses for 8-OHdG concentrations between 50 pM and 500 nM (\u223c14 pg/mL to 140 ng/mL), with limits of detection of \u223c300 pM and\u00a0 \u223c350 pM, respectively\u00a0for ( n = 3).

{"title": "Mechanical regulation of stem-cell differentiation by the stretch-activated Piezo channel.", "abstract": "Somatic stem cells constantly adjust their self-renewal and lineage commitment by integrating various environmental cues to maintain tissue homeostasis. Although numerous chemical and biological signals have been identified that regulate stem-cell behaviour, whether stem cells can directly sense mechanical signals in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that mechanical stress regulates stem-cell differentiation in the adult Drosophila midgut through the stretch-activated ion channel Piezo. We find that Piezo is specifically expressed in previously unidentified enteroendocrine precursor cells, which have reduced proliferation ability and are destined to become enteroendocrine cells. Loss of Piezo activity reduces the generation of enteroendocrine cells in the adult midgut. In addition, ectopic expression of Piezo in all stem cells triggers both cell proliferation and enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Both the Piezo mutant and overexpression phenotypes can be rescued by manipulation of cytosolic Ca", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2018-02-08", "authors": ["LiHe", "GuangweiSi", "JiuhongHuang", "Aravinthan D TSamuel", "NorbertPerrimon"], "doi": "10.1038/nature25744\n10.1038/nrm.2017.108\n10.1038/nature04371\n10.1038/nature04333\n10.1242/dmm.024232\n10.1146/annurev-genet-111212-133343\n10.1038/nature10801\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1007/s00424-014-1578-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0130969\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.04.001\n10.1038/nmeth.1356\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.10.016\n10.1126/science.1136606\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00380.x\n10.1073/pnas.1507309112\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1038/nature21407\n10.1038/nature16170\n10.1126/science.aab0988\n10.15252/embj.201695622\n10.1038/cddis.2015.413\n10.1016/j.ccr.2013.01.015\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.08.052\n10.1016/j.coph.2013.09.012\n10.1016/j.gep.2010.08.005\n10.1242/dev.123208\n10.7554/eLife.22441\n10.1002/dvg.20661\n10.1242/dev.060483\n10.1007/s00441-008-0708-3\n10.1126/scisignal.aab3729\n10.1101/pdb.prot090779\n10.1016/B978-0-12-801185-0.00019-2\n10.1073/pnas.1318481110\n10.1038/nmeth.2836\n10.1126/science.1208592\n10.1007/978-1-4939-3480-5_12\n10.1016/j.neuron.2012.08.039\n10.1038/nature12354"}

The dependencies of the distribution of a mechanical displacement and electrical potential over the plate thickness for electrically open and electrically shorted plates have been plotted.

The use of microscopy methods and the measurement of liver-specific functions optimized the model for best cell performances and also proved the superiority of the 3-D LO2 model when compared with the traditional monolayer model. Toxicity tests were conducted using the newly constructed model, finding that four dental castings coated with silver nanoparticles were toxic to human hepatocytes after cell viability assays. In general, the toxicity of both the castings and the coated silver nanoparticles aggravated as time increased, yet the nanoparticles attenuated the general toxicity by preventing metal ion release, especially at high concentrations.", "journal": "Journal of Zhejiang University.

{"title": "All-optical microscope autofocus based on an electrically tunable lens and a totally internally reflected IR laser.", "abstract": "Microscopic imaging at high spatial-temporal resolution over long time scales (minutes to hours) requires rapid and precise stabilization of the microscope focus. Conventional and commercial autofocus systems are largely based on piezoelectric stages or mechanical objective actuators. Objective to sample distance is either measured by image analysis approaches or by hardware modules measuring the intensity of reflected infrared light. We propose here a truly all-optical microscope autofocus taking advantage of an electrically tunable lens and a totally internally reflected infrared probe beam. We implement a feedback-loop based on the lateral position of a totally internally reflected infrared laser on a quadrant photodetector, as an indicator of the relative defocus.

{"title": "Flexible Piezoelectric Sensor-Based Gait Recognition.", "abstract": "Most motion recognition research has required tight-fitting suits for precise sensing. However, tight-suit systems have difficulty adapting to real applications, because people normally wear loose clothes. In this paper, we propose a gait recognition system with flexible piezoelectric sensors in loose clothing. The gait recognition system does not directly sense lower-body angles. It does, however, detect the transition between standing and walking. Specifically, we use the signals from the flexible sensors attached to the knee and hip parts on loose pants. We detect the periodic motion component using the discrete time Fourier series from the signal during walking. We adapt the gait detection method to a real-time patient motion and posture monitoring system. In the monitoring system, the gait recognition operates well. Finally, we test the gait recognition system with 10 subjects, for which the proposed system successfully detects walking with a success rate over 93 %.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-02-07", "authors": ["YoungsuCha", "HojoonKim", "DoikKim"], "doi": "10.3390/s18020468\n10.1109/SURV.2012.110112.00192\n10.3390/s150922089\n10.1007/s12652-015-0328-1\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2010.03.007\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2006.09.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030903\n10.1126/scirobotics.aah4416\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2007.10.010\n10.1109/10.605434\n10.1016/S0747-5632(99)00037-0\n10.1109/JSEN.2004.823671\n10.1109/TBME.2005.851475\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2014.02.006\n10.1063/1.324445\n10.1177/1045389X10366317\n10.3390/s16071045\n10.1177/1045389X08099604\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/1/015017\n10.3390/s17030584\n10.1186/1743-0003-8-22\n10.3390/s16040524\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.07.031"}
{"title": "Modeling Electronic Skin Response to Normal Distributed Force.", "abstract": "The reference electronic skin is a sensor array based on PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) piezoelectric polymers, coupled to a rigid substrate and covered by an elastomer layer. It is first evaluated how a distributed normal force (Hertzian distribution) is transmitted to an extended PVDF sensor through the elastomer layer. A simplified approach based on Boussinesq's half-space assumption is used to get a qualitative picture and extensive FEM simulations allow determination of the quantitative response for the actual finite elastomer layer. The ultimate use of the present model is to estimate the electrical sensor output from a measure of a basic mechanical action at the skin surface. However this requires that the PVDF piezoelectric coefficient be known a-priori. This was not the case in the present investigation. However, the numerical model has been used to fit experimental data from a real skin prototype and to estimate the sensor piezoelectric coefficient. It turned out that this value depends on the preload and decreases as a result of PVDF aging and fatigue. This framework contains all the fundamental ingredients of a fully predictive model, suggesting a number of future developments potentially useful for skin design and validation of the fabrication technology.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-02-07", "authors": ["LuciaSeminara"], "doi": "10.3390/s18020459\n10.1038/ncomms6747\n10.1002/adma.201302240\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.02.051\n10.1002/adfm.201404365\n10.1007/s12369-013-0223-x\n10.1016/j.robot.2015.07.015\n10.1109/TRO.2009.2033627\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.02.038\n10.1016/0928-4931(93)90006-O\n10.1109/70.238278\n10.1109/70.554353\n10.1177/027836499000900301\n10.1177/027836498500400304\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.04.001\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.02.001\n10.1142/S0218126613500667\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.05.004\n10.1016/S0020-7225(00)00043-4"}

Acoustic sensors were placed on the patella and medial tibial plateau (two accelerometers) as well as on the lateral tibial plateau (a piezoelectric disk) to measure the structure-borne noise in 59 asymptomatic knees and 40 knees with osteoarthritis. After semi-automatic segmentation of the acoustic signals, frequency features were generated for the extension as well as the flexion phase. We propose simple and robust features based on relative high-frequency components. The normalized nature of these frequency features makes them insusceptible to influences on the signal gain, such as attenuation by fat tissue and variance in acoustic coupling. We analyzed their ability to serve as classification features for detection of knee osteoarthritis, including the effect of normalization and the effect of combining frequency features of all three sensors. The features permitted a distinction between asymptomatic and non-healthy knees. Using machine learning with a linear support vector machine, a classification specificity of approximately 0.8 at a sensitivity of 0.75 could be achieved.

We observe a substantial change in the micellar structure during and after exposure to ultrasonic irradiation. We also observe a time-dependent relaxation to the equilibrium values of the unperturbed system. The strength of the perturbation of the structure factor depends systematically on the duration of sonication. The relaxation behavior can be well reproduced after multiple times of sonication. Accumulation of the recorded intensities of the different sonication cycles improves the signal-to-noise ratio and permits reaching very short relaxation times. In addition, we present SANS data for the micellar form factor on alkyl-poly (ethylene oxide) surfactant molecules irradiated by ultrasound.

{"title": "High-Throughput Acoustofluidic Self-Assembly of Colloidal Crystals.", "abstract": "Colloidal crystals are encountered in a variety of energy-harvesting applications, where they serve as waveguides or filters for electromagnetic and electro-optic energy. Techniques such as electric or magnetic assembly are used to assemble colloidal crystals, but are limited by crystal size, yield, and throughput. This article demonstrates the continuous, high-throughput assembly of two-dimensional (2D)-colloidal crystals in an acoustofluidic flow cell. The device is fabricated using off-the-shelf components and does not require a clean-room access. An experimental state diagram shows how the fluid flow rate and voltage applied to the piezoelectric element in our device can tune the crystal microstructure. Highly ordered colloidal crystals are continuously assembled in less than a minute with a throughput yield of several hundred particles per minute using this device. The acoustically assembled ordered 2D crystals are immobilized using a UV-curable resin and extracted as ordered polymer-particle fibers, demonstrating the ability of using acoustic fields to assemble ordered structures embedded in bulk materials. Particle tracking is used to construct the cross-channel particle distribution to understand the effect of acoustic compression on colloidal crystal assembly. Microparticle image velocimetry data is compared to a theoretical transport model to quantify the effect fluid flow and acoustic trapping has on the colloidal crystal ensemble.", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2018-02-02", "authors": ["MeghanaAkella", "Jaime JJu\u00e1rez"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.7b01862\n10.1109/TADVP.2003.817971\n10.1002/1521-4095(200103)13:6<409::AID-ADMA409>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1002/1616-3028(200104)11:2<95::AID-ADFM95>3.0.CO;2-O\n10.1038/35104718\n10.1038/nature08173\n10.1021/nl050469y\n10.1002/adma.19950070907\n10.1080/01442350050034180\n10.1023/A:1009998114205\n10.1039/C1SM06414B\n10.1063/1.3241081\n10.1021/la500178b\n10.1209/0295-5075/77/68004\n10.1016/j.mattod.2013.04.008\n10.1038/nature07237\n10.1021/la5009939\n10.1039/C5SM02348C\n10.1073/pnas.1323048111\n10.1002/adma.201500462\n10.1063/1.4891171\n10.1039/c2lc40692f\n10.1021/nn502107a\n10.1002/adfm.201200400\n10.1016/j.jcis.2010.11.023\n10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b05935\n10.1038/ncomms9661\n10.1021/ac200963n\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.01.001\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/2/02LT01\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.02.013\n10.1002/cyto.a.20205\n10.1021/acsnano.6b06784\n10.1073/pnas.1506272112\n10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.076\n10.1021/ac702249a\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2005.12.028\n10.1021/acsami.6b10895\n10.1002/1521-4095(20020916)14:18<1284::AID-ADMA1284>3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1039/b920376a\n10.1021/la501511s\n10.1021/la051490h\n10.1063/1.1476745\n10.1103/PhysRevB.19.2457\n10.1016/0009-2509(67)80048-4\n10.1021/la00077a038\n10.1121/1.4939737\n10.1039/c2lc40203c\n10.1007/BF02737895\n10.5334/jors.bl\n10.1007/BF00384623"}

{"title": "Focused ultrasound in neurosurgery: a historical perspective.", "abstract": "Focused ultrasound (FUS) has been under investigation for neurosurgical applications since the 1940s. Early experiments demonstrated ultrasound as an effective tool for the creation of intracranial lesions; however, they were limited by the need for craniotomy to avoid trajectory damage and wave distortion by the skull, and they also lacked effective techniques for monitoring. Since then, the development and hemispheric distribution of phased arrays has resolved the issue of the skull and allowed for a completely transcranial procedure. Similarly, advances in MR technology have allowed for the real-time guidance of FUS procedures using MR thermometry. MR-guided FUS (MRgFUS) has primarily been investigated for its thermal lesioning capabilities and was recently approved for use in essential tremor. In this capacity, the use of MRgFUS is being investigated for other ablative indications in functional neurosurgery and neurooncology. Other applications of MRgFUS that are under active investigation include opening of the blood-brain barrier to facilitate delivery of therapeutic agents, neuromodulation, and thrombolysis.

{"title": "Evolution of Structural and Optical Properties of ZnO Nanorods Grown on Vacuum Annealed Seed Crystallites.", "abstract": "In this study, the ambient condition for the as-coated seed layer (SL) annealing at 350 \u00b0C is varied from air or nitrogen to vacuum to examine the evolution of structural and optical properties of ZnO nanorods (NRs). The NR crystals of high surface density (~240 rods/\u03bcm\u00b2) and aspect ratio (~20.3) show greatly enhanced (002) degree of orientation and crystalline quality, when grown on the SLs annealed in vacuum, compared to those annealed in air or nitrogen ambient. This is due to the vacuum-annealed SL crystals of a highly preferred orientation toward (002) and large grain sizes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also reveals that the highest O/Zn atomic ratio of 0.89 is obtained in the case of vacuum-annealed SL crystals, which is due to the effective desorption of hydroxyl groups and other contaminants adsorbed on the surface formed during aqueous solution-based growth process. Near band edge emission (ultra violet range of 360-400 nm) of the vacuum-annealed SLs is also enhanced by 44% and 33% as compared to those annealed in air and nitrogen ambient, respectively, in photoluminescence with significant suppression of visible light emission associated with deep level transition. Due to this improvement of SL optical crystalline quality, the NR crystals grown on the vacuum-annealed SLs produce ~3 times higher ultra violet emission intensity than the other samples. In summary, it is shown that the ZnO NRs preferentially grow along the wurtzite c-axis direction, thereby producing the high crystalline quality of nanostructures when they grow on the vacuum-annealed SLs of high crystalline quality with minimized impurities and excellent preferred orientation. The ZnO nanostructures of high crystalline quality achieved in this study can be utilized for a wide range of potential device applications such as laser diodes, light-emitting diodes, piezoelectric transducers and generators, gas sensors, and ultraviolet detectors.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-01-27", "authors": ["WaqarKhan", "FasihullahKhan", "Hafiz Muhammad SalmanAjmal", "Noor UlHuda", "Ji HyunKim", "Sam-DongKim"], "doi": "10.3390/nano8020068\n10.1007/s00339-009-5086-5\n10.1021/jp405557b\n10.1002/pssa.200983706\n10.1016/j.mssp.2017.04.031\n10.1016/j.mssp.2016.01.004\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/15/155603\n10.1021/jp010026s\n10.1002/adma.200290015\n10.1016/S0040-6090(00)00746-X\n10.1016/j.spmi.2007.04.010\n10.1063/1.1512829\n10.1016/j.tsf.2015.11.040\n10.1002/adma.200390108\n10.1016/j.tsf.2007.06.124\n10.1016/j.cap.2015.12.004\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.117\n10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2007.05.023\n10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2006.08.028\n10.1016/S0040-6090(02)00977-X\n10.1002/admi.201601064\n10.1016/j.jpcs.2017.07.017\n10.1039/C5RA02631H\n10.1021/jp063239w\n10.1016/j.spmi.2013.10.012\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.10.071\n10.1039/C7CP01606A\n10.1021/jp5027509\n10.3390/ma3042643\n10.7567/JJAP.54.06FG05\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.08.118\n10.1088/2043-6254/aa7223"}

We present a novel approach of performing laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy that differs from previously described methods [1,2]; it is shorter, simpler, and reduces possible complications. Key differences include the mesh type, site of attachment, and dissection of the peritoneum while creating the possibility of future vaginal delivery after pregnancy. Our simplified technique uses a polyvinylidene fluoride mesh woven with a square weave secured to the posterior aspect of the cervix under a layer of visceral peritoneum. Because there is no longitudinal give of the mesh, unlike polypropylene meshes with a diamond weave, a wrap method [2] is not required. No dissection of the broad ligament and bladder is needed, eliminating the risk of bladder perforation and anterior mesh erosion with fewer adhesions and simplifying hysterectomy if required in the future. We also uniquely \"tunnel\" the peritoneum, reducing the size of defect for suture closure, and reperitonize the mesh. Previous methods restrict cervical dilatation and require women to have cesarean sections. The method described in the video allows women to deliver vaginally and, in the event of late miscarriage, avoid the need for hysterotomy.

{"title": "Tactile-Sensing Based on Flexible PVDF Nanofibers via Electrospinning: A Review.", "abstract": "The flexible tactile sensor has attracted widespread attention because of its great flexibility, high sensitivity, and large workable range. It can be integrated into clothing, electronic skin, or mounted on to human skin. Various nanostructured materials and nanocomposites with high flexibility and electrical performance have been widely utilized as functional materials in flexible tactile sensors. Polymer nanomaterials, representing the most promising materials, especially polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), PVDF co-polymer and their nanocomposites with ultra-sensitivity, high deformability, outstanding chemical resistance, high thermal stability and low permittivity, can meet the flexibility requirements for dynamic tactile sensing in wearable electronics. Electrospinning has been recognized as an excellent straightforward and versatile technique for preparing nanofiber materials. This review will present a brief overview of the recent advances in PVDF nanofibers by electrospinning for flexible tactile sensor applications. PVDF, PVDF co-polymers and their nanocomposites have been successfully formed as ultrafine nanofibers, even as randomly oriented PVDF nanofibers by electrospinning. These nanofibers used as the functional layers in flexible tactile sensors have been reviewed briefly in this paper. The \u03b2-phase content, which is the strongest polar moment contributing to piezoelectric properties among all the crystalline phases of PVDF, can be improved by adjusting the technical parameters in electrospun PVDF process. The piezoelectric properties and the sensibility for the pressure sensor are improved greatly when the PVDF fibers become more oriented. The tactile performance of PVDF composite nanofibers can be further promoted by doping with nanofillers and nanoclay. Electrospun P(VDF-TrFE) nanofiber mats used for the 3D pressure sensor achieved excellent sensitivity, even at 0.1 Pa. The most significant enhancement is that the aligned electrospun core-shell P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers exhibited almost 40 times higher sensitivity than that of pressure sensor based on thin-film PVDF.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-01-25", "authors": ["XiaomeiWang", "FazheSun", "GuangchaoYin", "YutingWang", "BoLiu", "MingdongDong"], "doi": "10.3390/s18020330\n10.1021/nn403838y\n10.1002/adma.201505124\n10.1016/S0957-4158(98)00045-2\n10.1016/j.mser.2017.02.001\n10.1039/C6TC04269D\n10.1002/adma.201501408\n10.1002/adma.201402574\n10.1109/JPROC.2009.2013612\n10.1038/nnano.2006.53\n10.1021/nl802367t\n10.1038/ncomms4132\n10.1038/nnano.2011.184\n10.1002/adma.201303041\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b01505\n10.1021/am5069936\n10.1016/j.carbon.2015.02.039\n10.1002/adma.201304742\n10.1504/IJNM.2015.075239\n10.3390/s140305296\n10.1016/j.polymer.2005.07.106\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2009.11.005\n10.1016/j.polymer.2015.11.030\n10.1038/ncomms2832\n10.1109/JMEMS.2007.896716\n10.1109/TRO.2009.2033627\n10.1007/s40843-016-0128-8\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1238723\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/4/045009\n10.3390/polym9020033\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.05.027\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2337115\n10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00178-7\n10.1039/c3ee24230g\n10.1038/ncomms2639\n10.1002/adma.200400719\n10.1002/adfm.200900591\n10.1088/0957-4484/17/14/R01\n10.1002/mame.201200290\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.02.002\n10.3390/ma7020906\n10.1063/1.1408260\n10.1063/1.373532\n10.1063/1.2975834\n10.1021/nl0602701\n10.1039/c3nr04329k\n10.1016/S0032-3861(02)00275-6\n10.1016/0304-3886(95)00041-8\n10.1002/mame.200800224\n10.1088/1468-6996/12/1/013002\n10.1016/j.msec.2012.04.060\n10.1002/adma.200700171\n10.1016/j.polymer.2007.07.023\n10.1016/0261-3069(84)90003-7\n10.1126/science.220.4602.1115\n10.1002/polb.1991.090291012\n10.1016/S0142-9418(03)00003-5\n10.1002/1097-0126(200101)50:1<10::AID-PI614>3.0.CO;2-W\n10.1126/science.1234855\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2004.12.040\n10.1002/polb.23146\n10.1080/1539445X.2010.495630\n10.1080/00222340902837527\n10.1016/j.tca.2007.05.023\n10.1016/S0032-3861(01)00064-7\n10.1021/jp3043494\n10.1021/jp3038768\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.11.014\n10.1116/1.3043476\n10.1002/pi.4339\n10.1039/c2nr11555g\n10.1021/am3018652\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.01.007\n10.3390/ma6072642\n10.1021/la034234i\n10.1021/ja048648p\n10.1021/jp073102l\n10.1002/adma.200306355\n10.1002/polb.10223\n10.1021/jp4011026\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1002/marc.200700544\n10.1108/02602280110388315\n10.1002/adma.201104365\n10.1016/j.robot.2005.09.019\n10.1039/c2jm33877g\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.11.036\n10.1016/j.ijplas.2008.09.008\n10.1080/00150199908230298\n10.1039/c3cp54083a\n10.1016/j.orgel.2017.07.035\n10.1088/0957-4484/24/40/405401\n10.1021/am1002525\n10.3390/s140609889\n10.1039/C4RA01058B\n10.1016/j.mseb.2013.10.003\n10.1021/ja065043f\n10.1016/j.synthmet.2014.09.013\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.151\n10.1126/science.1127798\n10.1039/c1ee02241e\n10.1021/am508812a\n10.1021/acsami.6b07833\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2015.05.001\n10.1063/1.1358847\n10.3390/membranes4020243\n10.1002/marc.201100040\n10.1038/srep36409\n10.1002/mame.201200218\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.053\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2344052"}

The side walls of the nanochannels are grafted with polystyrene using the free radicals created during irradiation.

Traditional external gate voltage usually needs a power supply, which can easily bring about background noise or lead to a short circuit in measurement, especially for nanoscale spintronic devices. Here, we present a study on the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in a ZnO/P3HT nanowire array structure with the device excited under oblique incidence. We demonstrate that a strong Rashba SOC is induced by the structure inversion asymmetry of the ZnO/P3HT heterointerface. We show that the Rashba SOC can be effectively tuned by inner-crystal piezo-potential created inside the ZnO nanowires instead of an externally applied voltage. The piezo-potential can not only ensure the stability of future spin-devices under a static pressure or strain but also work without the need of extra energy; hence this room-temperature generation and piezotronic effect control of spin photocurrent demonstrate a potential application in large-scale flexible spintronics in piezoelectric nanowire systems.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2018-01-23", "authors": ["LaipanZhu", "YanZhang", "PeiLin", "YingWang", "LeijingYang", "LiboChen", "LongfeiWang", "BaodongChen", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.7b08618"}

In addition to the multilayer assembly, microbead-based electrodes were integrated with the nanofiber mats to deliver a complexed compression and tension force excitation to the piezoelectric layers. A vacuum-packing process was performed to attain a tight and well-organized assembly of the device components even though the total thickness was several millimeters. The integrated piezoelectric device exhibited a maximum voltage and current of 10.4 V and 2.3 \u03bcA, respectively. Furthermore, the robust integrity of the device components could provide high-precision sensitivity to perceive small pressures down to approximately 100 Pa while retaining a linear input-output relationship.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2018-01-23", "authors": ["Young WonKim", "Han BitLee", "Si MoYeon", "JeanhoPark", "Hye JinLee", "JonghunYoon", "Suk HeePark"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b18259"}

Here, the modulation of electrostatic potential barriers at tailored ZnO bicrystal interfaces by stress-induced piezoelectric polarization is reported. Specimen design by epitaxial solid-state transformation allows for both optimal polarization vector alignment and tailoring of defect states at a semiconductor-semiconductor interface. Both quantities are probed by transmission electron microscopy. Consequently, uniaxial compressive stress affords a complete reduction of the potential barrier height at interfaces with head-to-head orientation of the piezoelectric polarization vectors and an increase in potential barrier height at interfaces with tail-to-tail orientation.

{"title": "The Dynamic Performance of Flexural Ultrasonic Transducers.", "abstract": "Flexural ultrasonic transducers are principally used as proximity sensors and for industrial metrology. Their operation relies on a piezoelectric ceramic to generate a flexing of a metallic membrane, which delivers the ultrasound signal. The performance of flexural ultrasonic transducers has been largely limited to excitation through a short voltage burst signal at a designated mechanical resonance frequency. However, a steady-state amplitude response is not generated instantaneously in a flexural ultrasonic transducer from a drive excitation signal, and differences in the drive characteristics between transmitting and receiving transducers can affect the measured response. This research investigates the dynamic performance of flexural ultrasonic transducers using acoustic microphone measurements and laser Doppler vibrometry, supported by a detailed mechanical analog model, in a process which has not before been applied to the flexural ultrasonic transducer. These techniques are employed to gain insights into the physics of their vibration behaviour, vital for the optimisation of industrial ultrasound systems.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-01-19", "authors": ["AndrewFeeney", "LeiKang", "GeorgeRowlands", "SteveDixon"], "doi": "10.3390/s18010270\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.03.017\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.03.007\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.02.006\n10.1109/JSEN.2011.2157490\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2284\n10.1016/S0041-624X(02)00162-2\n10.1063/1.4909508\n10.3390/s16091363\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.09.018\n10.1063/1.4984239\n10.1109/LSENS.2017.2779183"}
{"title": "Peri-Elastodynamic Simulations of Guided Ultrasonic Waves in Plate-Like Structure with Surface Mounted PZT.", "abstract": "Peridynamic based elastodynamic computation tool named Peri-elastodynamics is proposed herein to simulate the three-dimensional (3D) Lamb wave modes in materials for the first time. Peri-elastodynamics is a nonlocal meshless approach which is a scale-independent generalized technique to visualize the acoustic and ultrasonic waves in plate-like structure, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and nanodevices for their respective characterization. In this article, the characteristics of the fundamental Lamb wave modes are simulated in a sample plate-like structure. Lamb wave modes are generated using a surface mounted piezoelectric (PZT) transducer which is actuated from the top surface. The proposed generalized Peri-elastodynamics method is not only capable of simulating two dimensional (2D) in plane wave under plane strain condition formulated previously but also capable of accurately simulating the out of plane Symmetric and Antisymmetric Lamb wave modes in plate like structures in 3D. For structural health monitoring (SHM) of plate-like structures and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of MEMS devices, it is necessary to simulate the 3D wave-damage interaction scenarios and visualize the different wave features due to damages. Hence, in addition, to simulating the guided ultrasonic wave modes in pristine material, Lamb waves were also simulated in a damaged plate. The accuracy of the proposed technique is verified by comparing the modes generated in the plate and the mode shapes across the thickness of the plate with theoretical wave analysis.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-01-19", "authors": ["SubirPatra", "HossainAhmed", "SouravBanerjee"], "doi": "10.3390/s18010274\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/2/310\n10.3390/ma10121436\n10.2514/1.27046\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/003\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/7/075001\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/6/037\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/095018\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/1/015015\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6664\n10.1016/S0963-8695(98)00045-0\n10.1121/1.415396\n10.1088/0022-3727/29/1/024\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2004.03.005\n10.1016/j.wavemoti.2015.08.005\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/085022\n10.1016/j.ultras.2011.08.003\n10.1016/j.ultras.2007.02.003\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/3/035014\n10.1115/1.4037545\n10.1016/j.jsv.2008.04.028\n10.1016/S0022-5096(99)00029-0\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2004.11.026\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.04.015\n10.1063/1.4864863\n10.1007/s10704-010-9442-4\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.11.003\n10.1115/1.4037515\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2017.04.022\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2008)21:3(187)\n10.1177/1045389X05050106\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.05.007\n10.1016/j.ultras.2010.11.011"}
{"title": "Flexoelectricity in Bones.", "abstract": "Bones generate electricity under pressure, and this electromechanical behavior is thought to be essential for bone's self-repair and remodeling properties. The origin of this response is attributed to the piezoelectricity of collagen, which is the main structural protein of bones. In theory, however, any material can also generate voltages in response to strain gradients, thanks to the property known as flexoelectricity. In this work, the flexoelectricity of bone and pure bone mineral (hydroxyapatite) are measured and found to be of the same order of magnitude; the quantitative similarity suggests that hydroxyapatite flexoelectricity is the main source of bending-induced polarization in cortical bone. In addition, the measured flexoelectric coefficients are used to calculate the (flexo)electric fields generated by cracks in bone mineral. The results indicate that crack-generated flexoelectricity is theoretically large enough to induce osteocyte apoptosis and thus initiate the crack-healing process, suggesting a central role of flexoelectricity in bone repair and remodeling.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2018-01-19", "authors": ["FabianVasquez-Sancho", "AmirAbdollahi", "DraganDamjanovic", "GustauCatalan"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201705316"}

{"title": "Neuromorphic Vibrotactile Stimulation of Fingertips for Encoding Object Stiffness in Telepresence Sensory Substitution and Augmentation Applications.", "abstract": "We present a tactile telepresence system for real-time transmission of information about object stiffness to the human fingertips. Experimental tests were performed across two laboratories (Italy and Ireland). In the Italian laboratory, a mechatronic sensing platform indented different rubber samples. Information about rubber stiffness was converted into on-off events using a neuronal spiking model and sent to a vibrotactile glove in the Irish laboratory. Participants discriminated the variation of the stiffness of stimuli according to a two-alternative forced choice protocol. Stiffness discrimination was based on the variation of the temporal pattern of spikes generated during the indentation of the rubber samples. The results suggest that vibrotactile stimulation can effectively simulate surface stiffness when using neuronal spiking models to trigger vibrations in the haptic interface. Specifically, fractional variations of stiffness down to 0.67 were significantly discriminated with the developed neuromorphic haptic interface. This is a performance comparable, though slightly worse, to the threshold obtained in a benchmark experiment evaluating the same set of stimuli naturally with the own hand.

{"title": "Biodegradable Piezoelectric Force Sensor.", "abstract": "Measuring vital physiological pressures is important for monitoring health status, preventing the buildup of dangerous internal forces in impaired organs, and enabling novel approaches of using mechanical stimulation for tissue regeneration. Pressure sensors are often required to be implanted and directly integrated with native soft biological systems. Therefore, the devices should be flexible and at the same time biodegradable to avoid invasive removal surgery that can damage directly interfaced tissues. Despite recent achievements in degradable electronic devices, there is still a tremendous need to develop a force sensor which only relies on safe medical materials and requires no complex fabrication process to provide accurate information on important biophysiological forces. Here, we present a strategy for material processing, electromechanical analysis, device fabrication, and assessment of a piezoelectric Poly-l-lactide (PLLA) polymer to create a biodegradable, biocompatible piezoelectric force sensor, which only employs medical materials used commonly in Food and Drug Administration-approved implants, for the monitoring of biological forces. We show the sensor can precisely measure pressures in a wide range of 0-18 kPa and sustain a reliable performance for a period of 4 d in an aqueous environment. We also demonstrate this PLLA piezoelectric sensor can be implanted inside the abdominal cavity of a mouse to monitor the pressure of diaphragmatic contraction. This piezoelectric sensor offers an appealing alternative to present biodegradable electronic devices for the monitoring of intraorgan pressures. The sensor can be integrated with tissues and organs, forming self-sensing bionic systems to enable many exciting applications in regenerative medicine, drug delivery, and medical devices.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2018-01-18", "authors": ["Eli JCurry", "KaiKe", "Meysam TChorsi", "Kinga SWrobel", "Albert NMiller", "AviPatel", "InsooKim", "JianlinFeng", "LixiaYue", "QianWu", "Chia-LingKuo", "Kevin W-HLo", "Cato TLaurencin", "HoreaIlies", "Prashant KPurohit", "Thanh DNguyen"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1710874115"}

This geometry provides an efficient control of the wire orientation and an additive contribution of the individual piezoelectric signals. The device output voltage and efficiency are studied by finite element calculations for compression mechanical loading as a function of the wire geometrical growth parameters (length and density). We demonstrate that the voltage output level and sensitivity increases as a function of the wire length and that a conical shape is not mandatory for potential generation as it was the case for horizontally assembled devices. The optimal design to improve the overall device response is also optimized in terms of wire positioning inside PDMS, wire density, and total device thickness.

{"title": "Acoustic Transducers as Passive Cooperative Targets for Wireless Sensing of the Sub-Surface World: Challenges of Probing with Ground Penetrating RADAR.", "abstract": "Passive wireless transducers are used as sensors, probed by a RADAR system. A simple way to separate the returning signal from the clutter is to delay the response, so that the clutter decays before the echoes are received. This can be achieved by introducing a fixed delay in the sensor design. Acoustic wave transducers are ideally suited as cooperative targets for passive, wireless sensing. The incoming electromagnetic pulse is converted into an acoustic wave, propagated on the sensor substrate surface, and reflected as an electromagnetic echo. According to a known law, the acoustic wave propagation velocity depends on the physical quantity under investigation, which is then measured as an echo delay. Both conversions between electromagnetic and acoustic waves are based on the piezoelectric property of the substrate of which the sensor is made. Investigating underground sensing, we address the problems of using GPR (Ground-Penetrating RADAR) for probing cooperative targets. The GPR is a good candidate for this application because it provides an electromagnetic source and receiver, as well as echo recording tools. Instead of designing dedicated electronics, we choose a commercially available, reliable and rugged instrument. The measurement range depends on parameters like antenna radiation pattern, radio spectrum matching between GPR and the target, antenna-sensor impedance matching and the transfer function of the target. We demonstrate measurements at depths ranging from centimeters to circa 1 m in a sandbox. In our application, clutter rejection requires delays between the emitted pulse and echoes to be longer than in the regular use of the GPR for geophysical measurements. This delay, and the accuracy needed for sensing, challenge the GPR internal time base. In the GPR units we used, the drift turns out to be incompatible with the targeted application. The available documentation of other models and brands suggests that this is a rather general limitation. We solved the problem by replacing the analog ramp generator defining the time base with a fully digital solution, whose time accuracy and stability relies on a quartz oscillator. The resulting stability is acceptable for sub-surface cooperative sensor measurement.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-01-18", "authors": ["Jean-MichelFriedt", "GillesMartin", "GwenhaelGoavec-M\u00e9rou", "DavidRabus", "S\u00e9bastienAlzuaga", "LiliaArapan", "MarianneSagnard", "\u00c9mileCarry"], "doi": "10.3390/s18010246\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2005.09.005\n10.1190/1.1443679\n10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2171920\n10.1029/RS011i004p00383\n10.1007/BF02481655\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2285722\n10.1115/1.3269083\n10.1007/s11069-012-0487-8\n10.3389/fbuil.2017.00036\n10.1080/10286608.2013.820278\n10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.06.011\n10.1109/JRPROC.1948.226245\n10.1109/MMM.2010.938571\n10.3390/s17020265\n10.1109/JSEN.2009.2027407\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.04.017\n10.1109/41.915404\n10.1109/36.718649\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1462\n10.1109/TAP.1986.1143848\n10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125964\n10.2528/PIER08011804\n10.1109/8.210122\n10.1016/j.cpc.2016.08.020\n10.1111/j.1365-2478.1989.tb02221.x\n10.1109/TIM.2012.2190330\n10.1190/1.1440525\n10.1109/LGRS.2017.2681901"}

{"title": "Microfluidic flow switching ", "abstract": "We propose an acoustic flow switching device that utilizes high-frequency surface acoustic waves (SAWs) produced by a slanted-finger interdigitated transducer. As the acoustic field induced by the SAWs was attenuated in the fluid, it produced an acoustic streaming flow in the form of a pair of symmetrical microvortices, which induced flow switching between two fluid streams in a controlled manner. The microfluidic device was composed of a piezoelectric substrate attached to a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel having an H-shaped junction that connected two fluid streams in the middle. The two immiscible fluids, separated by the PDMS wall, flowed in parallel, briefly came in contact at the junction, and separated again into the downstream microchannels. The acoustic streaming flow induced by the SAWs rotated the fluid streams within the microchannel cross-section, thereby altering the respective positions of the two fluids and directing them into the opposite flow paths. The characteristics of the flow switching mechanism were investigated by tuning the input voltage and the flowrates. On-demand acoustic flow switching was successfully achieved without additional moving parts inside the microchannel.

Measurements were taken from the biceps during slow and fast elbow flexion with and without strong grip, during different weight lifting and from the gastrocnemius during treadmill marching at speeds of 4 and of 10 kph.

Increasing contraction intensity increase significantly both EMG and Piezo signals. Higher contractions velocity increased Piezo signal. Opposite linear relation was found between the average maximal EMG envelope amplitudes and the average maximal Piezo peaks with increasing loads.

{"title": "Static and dynamic electro-optical properties of liquid crystals mediated by ferroelectric polymer films.", "abstract": "This paper reports the electro-optical properties of high resistivity nematic liquid crystals sandwiched between ferroelectric polymer films. Interactions between liquid crystals and the film result in a series of interesting optical and electro-optical features. For example, the visualization of ferroelectric domains by means of liquid crystals has been known for decades. However, here we demonstrate that liquid crystals can also reveal the fractal dimension of multi-domain poly(vinylidene fluoride)-based films. Unidirectionally rubbed films made of poly(vinylidene fluoride)-based (PVDF) materials align liquid crystals (LC) homogeneously, with the pretilt angle on the order of 1-2 degrees. This property was implemented in the design of hybrid cells composed of liquid crystals sandwiched between PVDF-based films. The designed PVDF|LC|PVDF cells exhibit tunable electro-optical performance originating from the presence of the PVDF-based films. More specifically, (i) the threshold voltage characterizing the transition of liquid crystals from a planar to a homeotropic state can be tuned by varying the film thickness, and (ii) total fall time (turn-off time) can be controlled by varying the frequency and amplitude of the driving voltage. This frequency dependence of the fall time is strongly pronounced at a relatively high voltage applied across the cell. In the low frequency regime, an increase in the turn-off time can be approximated as a linear function of the applied electric field. An electric-field induced polarization of the PVDF-based films is considered a major reason leading to the afore-mentioned amplitude and frequency dependence of the switching time.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2018-01-09", "authors": ["Y AGarbovskiy", "D REvans", "P PBanerjee", "A VGlushchenko"], "doi": "10.1039/c7ra12443k\n10.1063/1.1654919\n10.1080/00150197808237230\n10.1080/00150198008008470\n10.1016/S0038-1098(97)10221-6\n10.1140/epje/i2006-10037-9\n10.1080/00150198208260665\n10.1080/00150198908216777\n10.1080/00150198908018085\n10.1080/00150198908217573\n10.1143/JPSJ.61.3786\n10.1080/07315179308204249\n10.1080/00150199308008276\n10.1080/00150199308008281\n10.1063/1.361262\n10.1080/00150199708228335\n10.1080/00150190008228448\n10.1063/1.1365417\n10.1063/1.121609\n10.1039/A807684G\n10.1080/026782999205056\n10.1080/10584580108012802\n10.1080/10587250108029925\n10.1080/02678290410001729769\n10.1080/15421400590957143\n10.1889/1.2770858\n10.1109/JDT.2007.913944\n10.1080/02678292.2015.1044578\n10.1149/2.0181602jss\n10.1088/0022-3727/43/1/015401\n10.1080/02678292.2016.1185174\n10.1080/01411598908206863\n10.1109/TDMR.2005.860818\n10.3390/cryst5040501\n10.1103/PhysRevB.84.024105\n10.1063/1.323928\n10.1364/OE.14.005365\n10.1080/01411594.2016.1277722\n10.1002/app.40994\n10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00188\n10.1063/1.3691825\n10.1038/srep04772\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.027602\n10.1021/nl200221z\n10.1063/1.4890412\n10.1127/0935-1221/2013/0025-2252\n10.1088/0022-3727/32/14/201"}

The collected water across the water column was then analyzed for bacterial diversity (culturable and functional bacterial diversity), various environmental parameters (pH, TDS, turbidity, density, salinity, inorganic phosphate, BOD, DO, COD, and total nitrogen), zoo, and phytoplankton to confirm the efficacy of the DDWS. The sampler-appended membrane could concentrate diversified bacteria from different seawater depths. Further, the bacterial diversity study, environmental parameters, and zoo and phytoplankton study showed a marked variance across different depths. The results thus obtained supported that the newly designed DDWS could successfully sample contamination-free water from various depths in seawater. The invented water sampler is easy to construct and operate, and the collected contamination-free water volume (3.5 L) suffices the requirement for the analyses of major water parameters entailed for different marine environmental studies.", "journal": "The Analyst", "date": "2018-01-09", "authors": ["SwetaBinod Kumar", "HardikTrivedi", "Narshibhai RameshbhaiBaraiya", "SoumyaHaldar"], "doi": "10.1039/c7an01528c"}

{"title": "Fabrication and characterization of highly porous barium titanate based scaffold coated by Gel/HA nanocomposite with high piezoelectric coefficient for bone tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "It is well established that the piezoelectric effect plays an important physiological role in bone growth, remodeling and fracture healing. Barium titanate, as a well-known piezoelectric ceramic, is especially an attractive material as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications. In this regard, we tried to fabricate a highly porous barium titanate based scaffolds by foam replication method and polarize them by applying an external electric field. In order to enhance the mechanical and biological properties, polarized/non-polarized scaffolds were coated with gelatin and nanostructured HA and characterized for their morphologies, porosities, piezoelectric and mechanical properties. The results showed that the compressive strength and piezoelectric coefficient of porous scaffolds increased with the increase of sintering temperature. After being coated with Gel/HA nanocomposite, the interconnected porous structure and pore size of the scaffolds almost remain unchanged while the Gel/nHA-coated scaffolds exhibited enhanced compressive strength and elastic modulus compared with the uncoated samples. Also, the effect of polarizing and coating of optimal scaffolds on adhesion, viability, and proliferation of the MG63 osteoblast-like cell line was evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and MTT assay. The cell culture experiments revealed that developed scaffolds had good biocompatibility and cells were able to adhere, proliferate and migrate into pores of the scaffolds. Furthermore, cell density was significantly higher in the coated scaffolds at all tested time-points.

Furthermore, this feature was applied as a reversible write/erase of fingerprint pattern through the press-stimulus and solvent-induced effect, together with the changes of morphology/optical signal.

In particular, the large importance of the piezoelectric effect in the polar direction in the photostriction of ferroelectric materials is stressed. Similarly, the occurrence of low-symmetry phases in lead titanate thin films under tensile strain is demonstrated to result in large elasto-optic constants. In addition, first-principle calculations allow to gain microscopic knowledge of subtle effects, for instance in the case of photostriction, where the deformation potential effect in directions perpendicular to the polar axis is shown to be almost as significant as the piezoelectric effect.

Customized macro fiber composite actuators were designed to achieve yaw control across a range of sideslip angles by inducing 3D curvature as a result of bending-twisting coupling, a well-known phenomenon in classical fiber composite theory. This allows for yaw control, pitch control, and limited air break control. The structural response of the customized actuators was determined numerically using both a piezoelectric and an equivalent thermal model in order to optimize the fiber direction to allow for maximized deflection in both the vertical and lateral directions. In total, three control configurations were tested experimentally: symmetric deflection for pitch control, single-sided deflection for yaw control, and antisymmetric deflection for air brake control. A Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes fluid simulation was also developed to compare with the experimental results for the unactuated baseline configuration. The actuator was shown to provide better yaw control than traditional split aileron methods, remain effective in larger sideslip angles, and provide directional yaw stability when unactuated. Furthermore, it was shown to provide adequate pitch control in sideslip in addition to limited air brake capabilities.

Treatment is surgical and consists of careful exeresis and curettage of the adjacent tissue. In recent years, piezoelectric surgery has been used to treat bone pathologies in the maxillofacial area, orthopedic surgery, and neurosurgery.

Moreover, under these assumptions, the relation can also be reversed: from the desired PSF the required profile deformation can be computed analytically, avoiding the use of trial-and-error search codes. However, the computation has been so far limited to geometric optics, which entailed some limitations: for example, mirror diffraction effects and the size of the coherent X-ray source were not considered. In this paper, the beam-shaping formalism in the framework of physical optics is reviewed, in the limit of small light wavelengths and in the case of Gaussian intensity wavefronts. Some examples of shaped profiles are also shown, aiming at turning a Gaussian intensity distribution into a top-hat one, and checks of the shaping performances computing the at-wavelength PSF by means of the WISE code are made.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2017-12-23", "authors": ["DSpiga"], "doi": "10.1107/S1600577517014035"}

This technical note illustrates an alternative intracranial approach that was used in combination with the techniques of piezoelectric surgery, neuroendoscopy, and neuronavigation for safe and effective removal in a difficult pediatric case of recurrent PBC. The third recurrence of a PBC in a 14-year-old girl was diagnosed by CT and MRI. A retrosigmoid approach gave access to the petrous apex, allowing for the safe and complete removal of the lesion and decompression of the facial nerve and internal carotid artery. The intraoperative implementation of piezoelectric surgery, neuronavigation, neuroendoscopy, and neuromonitoring ensured better intraoperative visualization, safer bone removal, and preservation of nerve function, facilitating a macroscopically total resection of the pathology without additional neurological damage of the adjacent tissues. Cholesteatoma extension could be clearly verified by intraoperative neuronavigation. Neuroendoscopy and piezoelectric surgery provided good support in the safe bone removal in close vicinity to neurovascular structures and in full vision inside the cholesteatoma cavity beyond the line of sight of the microscope. Hearing and facial nerve function could be preserved. The presented intracranial retrosigmoid approach combined with multiple intraoperative assisting techniques proved to be effective for the safe and complete removal of recurrent PBC, providing excellent intraoperative visualization and the possibility of preserving cranial nerve function.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

Here, we present a transparent, flexible, and self-powered multistage sensation matrix based on piezoelectric nanogenerators constructed in a crossbar design. Each sensor cell in the matrix comprises a layer of piezoelectric polymer sandwiched between two graphene electrodes. The simple lamination design allows sequential multistage sensation in one sensing cell, including compressive/tensile strain and detaching/releasing area. Further structure engineering on PDMS substrate allows the sensor cell to be highly sensitive to the applied pressures, representing the minimum sensing pressure below 800 Pa. As the basic combinations of compressive/tensile strains or detaching/releasing represent individual output signals, the proposed multistage sensors are capable of decoding to distinguish external complex motions.

{"title": "Assessing Infant Carriage Systems: Ground Reaction Force Implications for Gait of the Caregiver.", "abstract": "Objective To assess the acute alterations of anterior infant carriage systems on the ground reaction force experienced during over-ground walking. Background Previous research has identified the alterations in posture and gait associated with an increased anterior load (external or internal); however, the forces applied to the system due to the altered posture during over-ground walking have not been established. Method Thirteen mixed gender participants completed 45 over-ground walking trials at a self-selected pace under three loaded conditions (unloaded, semi-structured carrier 9.9 kg, and structured carrier 9.9 kg). Each trial consisted of a 15-m walkway, centered around a piezoelectric force platform sampling at 1,200 Hz. Differences were assessed between loaded and unloaded conditions and across carriers using paired samples t tests and repeated measures ANOVA. Results Additional load increased all ground reaction force parameters; however, the magnitude of force changes was influenced by carrier structure. The structured carrier displayed increased force magnitudes, a reduction in the time to vertical maximum heel contact, and an increased duration of the flat foot phase in walking gait. Conclusion Evidence suggests that the acute application of anterior infant carriers alters both kinetic and temporal measures of walking gait. Importantly, these changes appear to be governed not solely by the additional mass but also by the structure of the carrier.

{"title": "On-demand acoustic droplet splitting and steering in a disposable microfluidic chip.", "abstract": "On-chip droplet splitting is one of the fundamental droplet-based microfluidic unit operations to control droplet volume after production and increase operational capability, flexibility, and throughput. Various droplet splitting methods have been proposed, and among them the acoustic droplet splitting method is promising because of its label-free operation without any physical or thermal damage to droplets. Previous acoustic droplet splitting methods faced several limitations: first, they employed a cross-type acoustofluidic device that precluded multichannel droplet splitting; second, they required irreversible bonding between a piezoelectric substrate and a microfluidic chip, such that the fluidic chip was not replaceable. Here, we present a parallel-type acoustofluidic device with a disposable microfluidic chip to address the limitations of previous acoustic droplet splitting devices. In the proposed device, an acoustic field is applied in the direction opposite to the flow direction to achieve multichannel droplet splitting and steering. A disposable polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic chip is employed in the developed device, thereby removing the need for permanent bonding and improving the flexibility of the droplet microfluidic device. We experimentally demonstrated on-demand acoustic droplet bi-splitting and steering with precise control over the droplet splitting ratio, and we investigated the underlying physical mechanisms of droplet splitting and steering based on Laplace pressure and ray acoustics analyses, respectively. We also demonstrated droplet tri-splitting to prove the feasibility of multichannel droplet splitting.

The lack of inversion symmetry of wurtzite crystal structures and the lattice mismatch at heterointerfaces cause large polarization fields with contributions from both spontaneous polarization and piezoelectric polarization, which in turn results in obvious quantum confined stark effect. It is possible to alleviate this effect if the local electrostatic fields and band alignment induced charge redistribution can be quantitatively determined across the heterostructures. In this Concept, the applications of electron holography to investigate semiconductor LEDs are summarized. Following the off-axis electron holography scheme, the GaN-based LED heterostructures including InGaN/GaN-based quantum wells, other GaN-based quantum wells, and other forms of GaN-based LED materials are discussed, focusing on the local potential drops, polarization fields, and charge distributions. Moreover, GaAs-based LED heterostructures are briefly discussed.

Finite element (FE) models of the brain have been crucial for understanding concussion and for developing injury mitigation systems; however, the experimental brain deformation data currently used to validate these models are limited. The objective of this study was to develop a methodology for the investigation of in situ three-dimensional brain deformation during pure rotational loading of the head, using sonomicrometry. Sonomicrometry uses ultrasonic pulses to measure the dynamic distances between piezoelectric crystals implanted in any sound-transmitting media. A human cadaveric head-neck specimen was acquired 14\u2009h postmortem and was instrumented with an array of 32 small sonomicrometry crystals embedded in the head: 24 crystals were implanted in the brain, and 8 were fixed to the inner skull. A dynamic rotation was then applied to the head using a closed-loop controlled test device. Four pulses with different severity levels were applied around three orthogonal anatomical axes of rotation. A repeated test of the highest severity rotation was conducted in each axis to assess repeatability. All tests were completed within 56\u2009h postmortem. Overall, the combined experimental and sonomicrometry methods were demonstrated to reliably and repeatedly capture three-dimensional dynamic deformation of an intact human brain. These methods provide a framework for using sonomicrometry to acquire multidimensional experimental data required for FE model development and validation, and will lend insight into the deformations sustained by the brain during impact.", "journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "date": "2017-11-29", "authors": ["AhmedAlshareef", "J SebastianGiudice", "JasonForman", "Robert SSalzar", "Matthew BPanzer"], "doi": "10.1089/neu.2017.5362"}

In this study, antibody against TNF\u03b1 was immobilized on Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) sensor and the same was made on magnetic particles. Human TNF\u03b1 was measured in a way of interaction with QCM surface and then the particles were applied. The assay exerted sufficient limit of detection equal to 1.62pg/ml and it also fully correlated with standard ELISA tests. No interference by interleukin 6 or albumin was observed. Long term stability of the immunosensors lasting for at least three months was found. The immunosensors appears to be readily for practical performance and it would be an alternative to the standard ELISA especially when diagnoses made in field, homecare conditions or conditions of small hospitals as an emergency test.", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2017-11-16", "authors": ["MiroslavPohanka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.talanta.2017.10.031"}

While, lower Ra value (average asperity height) aluminum samples were more susceptible to surface deformation and scratches from coupling the transducer to the sample, the same could not be observed for steel samples. Results demonstrate a large variation in nonlinearity parameter for aluminum (\u223c35%) compared to steel (\u223c2%) between two consecutive experiments, suggesting flattening of asperities after the first experiment. Experiments were also performed with 3 different setup configurations; (1) receiver and transmitter on rough sides, (2) receiver on smooth and transmitter on rough side and (3) receiver on rough and transmitter on smooth side. Results show that least variation in the measured nonlinearity parameter was observed when the receiver was placed on the smooth side, and a 10% variation was observed between the three setup configurations.

Two methods for determining the elongation direction of macrozones in titanium alloys, using the anisotropic spatial coherence of the backscattered field, are presented. Both methods use a phased array attached on a rotative holder that records the array response matrix at several angles. Two titanium alloys were investigated: TA6V and Ti17. TA6V exhibited a strong macrozone elongation, whereas Ti17 macrozones were found equiaxial. The first method is based on the measurement of backscattered intensity in function of the probe angle relative to the macrozones elongation direction. An angular dependence of backscattered intensity is observed in presence of elongated scatterers, and their elongation direction is collinear with the probe direction corresponding to a minimal intensity. This variability is linked to both piezoelectric shape and the backscattered field spatial properties. The second method is based on the measurement of the relative proportion of single to multiple scattering in a diffusive media, using a simplified version of the single scattering filter developed in Aubry and Derode (2009). It allows the measurement of the level of multiple scattering: both titanium alloys exhibited strong multiple scattering.

The Integral Resonant Control (IRC) utilizes this unique property to add substantial damping to the dominant resonant mode by the use of a simple integrator implemented in closed loop. IRC used in conjunction with an integral tracking scheme, effectively reduces positioning errors introduced by modelling inaccuracies or parameter uncertainties. Over the past few years, successful application of the IRC control technique to nanopositioning systems has demonstrated performance robustness, easy tunability and versatility. The main drawback has been the relatively small positioning bandwidth achievable. This paper proposes a fractional order implementation of the classical integral tracking scheme employed in tandem with the IRC scheme to deliver damping and tracking. The fractional order integrator introduces an additional design parameter which allows desired pole-placement, resulting in superior closed loop bandwidth.

SN detection is important to monitor SN objectively and to improve the diagnostic sensitivity of sleep-disordered breathing. In this study, an automatic snore detection method using an electromechanical film transducer (Emfit) signal is presented. Representative polysomnographs of normal breathing and SN periods from 30 subjects were selected. Individual SN events were identified using source separation applying nonnegative matrix factorization deconvolution. The algorithm was evaluated using manual annotation of the polysomnographic recordings. According to our results, the sensitivity, and the positive predictive value of the developed method to reveal snoring from the Emfit signal were 82.81% and 86.29%, respectively. Compared to other approaches, our method adapts to the individual spectral snoring profile of the subject rather than matching a particular spectral profile, estimates the snoring intensity, and obtains the specific spectral profile of the snores in the epoch. Additionally, no training is necessary. This study suggests that it is possible to detect individual SN events with Emfit mattress, which can be used as a contactless alternative to more conventional methods such as piezo-snore sensors or microphones.", "journal": "IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics", "date": "2017-09-30", "authors": ["Jose MariaPerez-Macias", "MirjaTenhunen", "AlpoVarri", "Sari-LeenaHimanen", "JariViik", "Jose MariaPerez-Macias", "MirjaTenhunen", "AlpoVarri", "Sari-LeenaHimanen", "JariViik"], "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2017.2757530"}
{"title": "Unambiguous Identification and Visualization of an Acoustically Active Catheter by Ultrasound Imaging in Real Time: Theory, Algorithm, and Phantom Experiments.", "abstract": "Ultrasound-guided biopsies and minimally invasive procedures have been used in numerous medical applications, including catheter guidance. The biggest challenge for catheter guidance by ultrasound lies in distinguishing the catheter from neighboring tissue, as well as the ability to differentiate the catheter body from its tip.\nIn our previous work, we introduced a functional prototype of an acoustically active catheter, in which a miniature piezoelectric crystal allowed accurate localization of the catheter tip by pulsed wave (PW) Doppler imaging and Doppler spectrogram. In this paper, the theory behind the symmetric Doppler shift due to the interaction of ultrasound wave with a vibrating piezoelectric crystal is explained. The theory is validated in an experimental continuous flow phantom setup. A novel algorithm, symmetric frequency detection algorithm, is presented for identification and visualization of the catheter tip in real time along with B-mode and PW Doppler.\nThe catheter tip is identified with a distinct color differentiable from common Doppler colors with a frame rate varying from 22 to 50\u00a0Hz. The catheter tip can be visualized in a small region of 2.4 mm in the elevational direction.\nThe algorithm can be implemented in most clinical ultrasound machines with minor additions to the PW Doppler processing algorithm. The algorithm is optimized to be robust for a variety of blood flow velocities and is shown to perform well when the signal from the blood is on par in amplitude with the catheter signal.\nUnambiguous and distinct visualization of catheter tip facilitates real-time tracking of the catheter and aids minimally invasive procedures.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2017-09-28", "authors": ["ViksitKumar", "RichardLiu", "Randall RKinnick", "AdrianaGregory", "AzraAlizad", "MarekBelohlavek", "MostafaFatemi"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2017.2749245"}
{"title": "Contact atomic force microscopy using piezoresistive cantilevers in load force modulation mode.", "abstract": "Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) encompasses several techniques for imaging of the physical and chemical material properties at nanoscale. The scanning process is based on the detection of the deflection of the cantilever, which is caused by near field interactions, while the tip runs over the sample's surface. The variety of deflection detection methods including optical, piezoresistive, piezoelectric technologies has been developed and applied depending on the measurement mode and measurement environment. There are many advantages (compactness, vacuum compatibility, etc.) of the piezoresistive detection method, which makes it very attractive for almost all SPM experiments. Due to the technological limitations the stiffness of the piezoresistive beams is usually higher than the stiffness of the cantilever detected using optical methods. This is the basic constraint for the application of the piezoresistive beams in contact mode (CM) atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations performed at low load forces (usually less than 20\u00a0nN). Drift of the deflection signal, which is related to thermal fluctuations of the measurement setup, causes that the microscope controller compensates the fluctuations instead of compensating the strength of tip-surface interactions. Therefore, it is quite difficult to keep near field interaction precisely at the setpoint level during the whole scanning process. This can lead to either damage of the cantilever's tip and material surface or loosing the contact with the investigated sample and making the measurement unreliable. For these reasons, load force modulation (LoFM) scanning mode, in which the interaction at the tip is precisely controlled at every point of the sample surface, is proposed to enable precise AFM surface investigations using the piezoresistive cantilevers. In this article we describe the developed measurement algorithm as well as proposed and introduced hardware and software solutions. The results of the experiments confirm strong reduction of the AFM entire setup drift. The results demonstrating contactless tip lateral movements are presented.

The ability to rapidly detect the presence of foodborne pathogens is a vital component of any strategy towards establishing a safe and secure food supply chain. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses capable of infecting and replicating within bacteria in a strain-specific manner. The ubiquitous and selective nature of phages makes them ideal for the detection and biocontrol of bacteria. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop and test a phage-based paper dipstick biosensor for the detection of various foodborne pathogens in food matrices. The first step was to identify the best method for immobilizing phages on paper such that their biological activity (infectivity) was preserved. It was found that piezoelectric inkjet printing resulted in lower loss of phage infectivity when compared with other printing methods (namely gravure and blade coating) and that ColorLok paper was ideally suited to create functional sensors. The phage-based bioactive papers developed with use of piezoelectric inkjet printing actively lysed their target bacteria and retained this antibacterial activity for up to 1 week when stored at room temperature and 80% relative humidity. These bioactive paper strips in combination with quantitative real-time PCR were used for quantitative determination of target bacteria in broth and food matrices. A phage dipstick was used to capture and infect Escherichia coli O157:H7, E. coli O45:H2, and Salmonella Newport in spinach, ground beef and chicken homogenates, respectively, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the progeny phages. A detection limit of 10-50 colony-forming units per millilitre was demonstrated with a total assay time of 8 h, which was the duration of a typical work shift in an industrial setting. This detection method is rapid and cost-effective, and may potentially be applied to a broad range of bacterial foodborne pathogens.

Bone also processes electromechanical properties, such as piezoelectricity and streaming potentials, which termed as stress generated potentials. Furthermore, the electrostrictive effect and flexoelectric effect can also affect electromechanical properties of the bone. In the present work, time responses of bending deflections of bone cantilever in an external electric field are measured experimentally to investigate bone's electromechanical behavior. It is found that, when subjected to a square waveform electric field, a bone cantilever specimen begins to bend and its deflection increases gradually to a peak value. Then, the deflection begins to decrease gradually during the period of constant voltage. To analyze the reasons of the bending response of bone, additional experiments were performed. Experimental results obtained show the following two features. The first one is that the electric polarization, induced in bone by an electric field, is due to the Maxwell-Wagner polarization mechanism that the polarization rate is relatively slow, which leads to the electric field force acted on a bone specimen increase gradually and then its bending deflections increase gradually. The second one is that the flexoelectric polarization effect that resists the electric force to decrease and then leads to the bending deflection of a bone cantilever decrease gradually. It is concluded that the first aspect refers to the organic collagens decreasing the electric polarization rate of the bone, and the second one to the inorganic component influencing the bone's polarization intensity.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2017-09-20", "authors": ["HuiminKang", "ZhendeHou", "Qing-HuaQin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.09.017"}

Finite element analyses are performed in order to derive fundamental guidelines for the actuator layout aiming at maximal mechanical stimuli. Further analyses aim at investigating how the actuator position inside the cochlea influences the basilar membrane oscillation profile. While actuator layout guidelines leading to maximized acoustic stimuli could be derived, some of these guidelines are of complementary nature suggesting that further studies under realistic boundary conditions must be performed. Actuator positioning inside the cochlea is shown to have a significant influence on the resulting auditory impression of the patient.

When ultrasonic inspection is used experimentally to investigate the presence of defects in composite materials, the microscopic defect geometry may cause signal characteristics that are difficult to interpret. Hence, modeling of this interaction is key to improve our understanding and way of interpreting the acquired ultrasonic signals. To model the true interaction of the ultrasonic wave field with such defect structures as pores, cracks or delamination, a realistic three dimensional geometry reconstruction is required. We present a 3D-image based reconstruction process which converts computed tomography data in adequate surface representations ready to be embedded for processing with finite element methods. Subsequent modeling using these geometries uses a multi-scale and multi-physics simulation approach which results in quantitative A-Scan ultrasonic signals which can be directly compared with experimental signals. Therefore, besides the properties of the composite material, a full transducer implementation, piezoelectric conversion and simultaneous modeling of the attached circuit is applied. Comparison between simulated and experimental signals provides very good agreement in electrical voltage amplitude and the signal arrival time and thus validates the proposed modeling approach.

In order to explore ways of the propagation of such vibrations, the authors developed the FEM model of the array of piezoelectric transducers designed for calculations in COMSOL Multiphysics software. Simulations of activating individual transducers and calculated electrical voltages appearing on transducers unstimulated intentionally, were performed in the time domain in order to assess the propagation velocity of different vibration modes through the construction elements. On this basis, conclusions were drawn in terms of the participation of various construction parts of the array of piezoelectric transducers in the process of creating the mechanical crosstalk. The elaborated FEM model allowed also to examine the ways aimed at reducing the transmission of mechanical crosstalk vibrations through the components of the array.

Piezo drill devices leverage lateral and axial vibration of the micropipette to accomplish ZP penetration with greatly reduced oocyte deformation. However, existing piezo drills all rely on a large lateral micropipette vibration amplitude ( 20 ) and a small axial vibration amplitude (0.1 ). The very large lateral vibration amplitude has been deemed to be necessary for ZP penetration although it also induces larger oocyte deformation and more oocyte damage. This paper reports on a new piezo drill device that uses a flexure guidance mechanism and a systematically designed pulse train with an appropriate base frequency. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that a small lateral vibration amplitude (e.g., 2 ) and an axial vibration amplitude as large as 1.2 were achieved.

After 8\u00a0weeks, six pigs underwent MRI evaluation with and without pneumoperitoneum to assess the visibility and elasticity of the mesh. Finally, pigs were euthanized and abdominal walls were explanted for histological and immunohistochemical assessment. The degree of adhesion formation was documented.\nLaparoscopic implantation of elastic TPU meshes in IPOM position was feasible and safe in a minipig model. Mesh position could be precisely visualized and assessed with and without pneumoperitoneum using MRI after 8\u00a0weeks. Elastic TPU meshes showed a significantly higher surface increase under pneumoperitoneum in comparison to PVDF. Immunohistochemically, the amount of CD45-positive cells was significantly lower and the Collagen I/III ratio was significantly higher in TPU meshes after 8\u00a0weeks. There were no differences regarding adhesion formation between study groups.\nThe TPU mesh preserves its elastic properties in IPOM position in a porcine model after 8\u00a0weeks. Immunohistochemistry indicates superior biocompatibility regarding CD45-positive cells and Collagen I/III ratio in comparison to PVDF meshes with a similar structure.", "journal": "Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research", "date": "2017-06-09", "authors": ["ALambertz", "L C Lvan den Hil", "ACiritsis", "REickhoff", "N AKraemer", "N DBouvy", "AM\u00fcllen", "UKlinge", "U PNeumann", "C DKlink"], "doi": "10.1080/08941939.2017.1301599"}

{"title": "A Method for Collecting Single Cell Suspensions Using an Ultrasonic Pump.", "abstract": "The presence of cell aggregates in cell suspensions may reduce cell culture efficiency because they can induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation. To avoid this problem, this study proposes a novel method for collecting single cell suspensions from culture chambers for subculture using an ultrasonic pump driven by the squeeze film effect. First, we developed a cell culture device consisting of a cell culture substrate with a piezoelectric ceramic disk glued to the back, so that we can elicit resonance vibration of the substrate. A glass pipe is then placed vertically against the cell culture substrate with a slight gap (corresponding to cell diameter) between the pipe and the substrate. By exciting an out-of-plane resonance vibration of the cell culture substrate, we can collect a cell suspension from the cell culture chamber. Since the gap distance between the glass pipe and the cell culture substrate corresponds to cell diameter, the collected cell suspension only contains single cells. We evaluated the capability of the developed cell suspension pumping system and the proliferation of the collected cells with C2C12 myoblast cells. The ratio of single cells in the cell suspension was improved by up to 9.6% compared with that of suspensions collected by the control method (traditional pipetting). Moreover, after cultivating the collected cells for 72 hr, the cells collected by our method proliferated 13.6% more than those collected by the control method. These results suggest that the proposed method has great potential for improving the cultivation efficiency of adhesive cell culture.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2017-05-04", "authors": ["MisaNakao", "YutaKurashina", "ChikahiroImashiro", "KenjiroTakemura"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2017.2699291"}

Inhibition of these currents increases contractility in canine atrial myocytes and goat atria. We investigated the effect of vernakalant on early repolarization and contractility in normal and electrically remodelled atria.\nGoats were implanted a pressure catheter, piezoelectric crystals, and electrodes to obtain atrial contractility and effective refractory period (ERP). The active component in pressure distance loops was used to compute the atrial work index (AWI). Experiments were performed in normal and electrically remodelled atria at clinically relevant plasma levels of vernakalant. As a positive control, the Ito/IKur blocker AVE0118 was investigated. Monophasic action potentials were recorded in anaesthetized goats and in explanted hearts to determine changes in action potential morphology. Vernakalant did not affect atrial work loops during sinus rhythm. Likewise vernakalant did not increase atrial fractional shortening or AWI during pacing with fixed heart rate and AV-delay. In contrast, AVE0118 did increase AWI, with a positive force frequency relation. Both in normal and remodelled atria, vernakalant strongly increased ERP but did not prolong early repolarization.\nIn goat atria, vernakalant does not have an atrial positive inotropic effect and does not affect early repolarization. At high rates vernakalant may even have a negative inotropic effect.", "journal": "Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "date": "2017-04-28", "authors": ["Arnevan Hunnik", "HusseinNasrallah", "Dennis HLau", "MarionKuiper", "SanderVerheule", "UlrichSchotten"], "doi": "10.1093/europace/eux025"}

{"title": "Electromechanical Coupling Factor of Breast Tissue as a Biomarker for Breast Cancer.", "abstract": "This research aims to validate a new biomarker of breast cancer by introducing electromechanical coupling factor of breast tissue samples as a possible additional indicator of breast cancer. Since collagen fibril exhibits a structural organization that gives rise to a piezoelectric effect, the difference in collagen density between normal and cancerous tissue can be captured by identifying the corresponding electromechanical coupling factor.\nThe design of a portable diagnostic tool and a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based biochip, which is integrated with a piezoresistive sensing layer for measuring the reaction force as well as a microheater for temperature control, is introduced. To verify that electromechanical coupling factor can be used as a biomarker for breast cancer, the piezoelectric model for breast tissue is described with preliminary experimental results on five sets of normal and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples in the 25-45 temperature range.\nWhile the stiffness of breast tissues can be captured as a representative mechanical signature which allows one to discriminate among tissue types especially in the higher strain region, the electromechanical coupling factor shows more distinct differences between the normal and IDC groups over the entire strain region than the mechanical signature. From the two-sample -test, the electromechanical coupling factor under compression shows statistically significant differences ( 0.0039) between the two groups.\nThe increase in collagen density in breast tissue is an objective and reproducible characteristic of breast cancer. Although characterization of mechanical tissue property has been shown to be useful for differentiating cancerous tissue from normal tissue, using a single parameter may not be sufficient for practical usage due to inherent variation among biological samples. The portable breast cancer diagnostic tool reported in this manuscript shows the feasibility of measuring multiple parameters of breast tissue allowing for practical application.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2017-04-25", "authors": ["KihanPark", "WenjinChen", "Marina AChekmareva", "David JForan", "Jaydev PDesai"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2017.2695103"}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the properties and configuration changes as mesh deformation and mesh shrinkage of a soft mesh implant compared with a conventional stiff mesh implant in vitro and in a porcine model.\nTensile tests and digital image correlation were used to determine the textile porosity for both mesh types in vitro. A group of three pigs each were treated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visible conventional stiff polyvinylidene fluoride meshes (PVDF) or with soft thermoplastic polyurethane meshes (TPU) (FEG Textiltechnik mbH, Aachen, Germany), respectively. MRI was performed with a pneumoperitoneum at a pressure of 0 and 15 mmHg, which resulted in bulging of the abdomen. The mesh-induced signal voids were semiautomatically segmented and the mesh areas were determined. With the deformations assessed in both mesh types at both pressure conditions, the porosity change of the meshes after 8 weeks of ingrowth was calculated as an indicator of preserved elastic properties. The explanted specimens were examined histologically for the maturity of the scar (collagen I/III ratio).\nIn TPU, the in vitro porosity increased constantly, in PVDF, a loss of porosity was observed under mild stresses. In vivo, the mean mesh areas of TPU were 206.8 cm\nThe elastic properties of TPU mesh implants result in improved tissue integration compared to conventional PVDF meshes, and they adapt more efficiently to the abdominal wall. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Single, simultaneous and sequential applications of ultrasonic frequencies for the elimination of ibuprofen in water.", "abstract": "The study is about the assessment of single and multi-frequency operations for the overall degradation of a widely consumed analgesic pharmaceutical-ibuprofen (IBP). The selected frequencies were in the range of 20-1130kHz emissions coming from probes, baths and piezo-electric transducers attached to plate-type devices. Multi-frequency operations were applied either simultaneously as \"duals\", or sequentially at fixed time intervals; and the total reaction time in all operations was 30-min. The work also covers evaluation of the effect of zero-valent iron (ZVI) on the efficiency of the degradation process and the performance of the reaction systems. It was found that low-frequency probe type devices especially at 20kHz were ineffective when applied singly and without ZVI, and relatively more effective in combined-frequency operations in the presence of ZVI. The power efficiencies of the reactors and/or reaction systems showed that 20-kHz probe was considerably more energy intensive than all others, and was therefore not used in multi-frequency operations. The most efficient reactor in terms of power consumption was the bath (200kHz), which however provided insufficient mineralization of the test chemical. The highest percentage of TOC decay (37%) was obtained in a dual-frequency operation (40/572kHz) with ZVI, in which the energy consumption was neither low nor exceptionally too high. A sequential operation (40+200kHz) in that respect was more efficient, because it required much less energy for a similar TOC decay performance (30%). In general, the degradation of IBP increased with increased power consumption, which in turn reduced the sonochemical yield. The study also showed that advanced Fenton reactions with ZVI were faster in the presence of ultrasound, and the metal was very effective in improving the performance of low-frequency operations.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2017-02-27", "authors": ["AsuZiylan-Yavas", "Nilsun HInce"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2017.01.032"}
{"title": "Preservation of root cementum: a comparative evaluation of power-driven versus hand instruments.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of three distinct periodontal treatment methods in comparison with hand instrumentation on residual cementum of periodontal diseased teeth. Cementum can influence the activities of periodontal cells and may play an important regulatory role in periodontal treatment. The ideal method for periodontal therapy involves removal of biofilm, calculus and endotoxin while preserving root cementum.\nForty-eight caries free, single-rooted teeth in patients diagnosed with severe chronic periodontitis were treated using four different methods prior to extraction. The teeth were instrumented subgingivally at one approximal site either by hand curettes (HC), piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers (U), piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers following air polishing (U + AP) or air polishing (AP) alone. Following extraction of teeth, instrumented and non-instrumented sites were analysed with a dissecting microscope and SEM for measurement of the amount of and surface characteristics of residual cementum.\nThe percentage of coronal cementum remaining following subgingival instrumentation was 84% for U, 80% for U + AP, 94% for AP and 65% for HC. Although subgingival instrumentation of apical portions of the cementum demonstrated 6% less retained cementum in comparison with coronal portions, the amount of retained cementum with AP was still significantly greater than with HC. SEM results found the smoothest root surfaces were produced by the HC followed by the AP, while root surfaces instrumented by U or U + AP presented grooves and scratches.\nThis study demonstrated that AP was superior to U devices in preserving cementum, whereas HC were the most effective instruments in removing cementum.", "journal": "International journal of dental hygiene", "date": "2016-11-20", "authors": ["EBozbay", "FDominici", "A YGokbuget", "SCintan", "LGuida", "M SAydin", "AMariotti", "APilloni"], "doi": "10.1111/idh.12249"}
